## Graduate Life Only for the "Nerdcore" Grad student raps to his own beat 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Calling all geeks: ever thought you could bust a
rhyme like MC Hammer, if oniy you had some
thing to rap about? With a new music movement
called "nerdcore,' you can finally put down that Rubik's
Cube and start spittin' game like Ice Cube.
In fact, Dan Maynes-Aminzade, a fifth year Ph.D. can
didate in Computer Science, is doing just that.
"There's a long history of rap music dealing with
nerdy topics," said Maynes-Aminzade. "It just hasn't
been considered a musical genre until recently. Look
back to songs by Weird A 1 Yankovic, like it's All About
the Pentiums.' Even the Beastie Boys are a little bit nerdy
sometimes."
Maynes-Aminzade has been committed to making his
own rap music for several years now.
"I've always enjoyed rap and hip-hop," he said. "In
high school, I wished I could be as cool as these rappers I
saw on TV. My friends and I used to get together and
make rap songs about nerdy topics, like how good our
math team was. Then we all went off to college and real
ized how horrible our songs were."
But two years ago. when Maynes-Aminzade heard fel
low nerdcore rapper "MC Plus+," he decided to produce
his own work under the alias of "Monzy."

Last year, one of his songs was
filmed for the documentary "Nerd-

core for Life." Now posted on
Youtube, the video — in which t
he performs outside the Gates I
Computer Science building —

has received over 200.CXX) hits.
"Since I started doing nerd
core again, the genre has real- /
ly blossomed." he said. /
"There's lots more atten- /

tion on it.Two documen
taries about the

genre are cur
rently being
made."
Though the
popularity of his
music continues
to grow,
Maynes-Am
inzade main-

tains that the music he writes is
purely for himself and a small
group of friends — rather than
for a profit.
"As for the commercial via
bility of nerdcore in general, it's
unlikely for real nerdcore to

have mainstream commer
cial success," he said. "Weird
