# How TO DATE A GRAD STUDENT IN THREE MINUTES
## A 						sketchy (under)grad goes looking for love 
### MARISSA MILLER DESK EDITOR 
a just don't think it's a good idea," she told
me over the phone. "What if you meet
Prince Charming? You'd begin your
whole relationship with a lie."
"Oh Mom. come on," 1 laughed. "The man of my
dreams isn't going to be a grad student. I promise. 1
have nothing to worry about."
The thing about my mother, though — and she'll
tell you this herself — is that she's always right.
But let me start from the beginning.
In an attempt to play muse to our regular columnist,
Navin, I signed him up for speed dating. I filled out an
application, submitted his email address, and then —
increase your chance of acceptance, said the site, bring
a friend! — I signed myself up. too.
"How do you spend your free time," asked the ap
plication.
"Making lists of why I hate my life?" suggested Nav.
"Making...others...laugh," I typed.
A week later, Nav told me he couldn't go; his broth
er was in town.That's how I became karma's plaything,
and how I found myself, biking through the rain, to
ward a part of campus where I'd vowed never to set
foot.
Yes, I — the sketchy undergrad — attended Rains
Speed Dating, and 1 lived to tell about it. And I think
maybe, just maybe, I enjoyed it.

Dressing the part had been a challenge.
"You have to look hot. but not too hot," my room
mate told me. "Remember, you're going as a grad stu
dent."

"Dress like you're going on a first

date," advised Nav.
"I've never been on a first
date," I said. "All-girls'
school, remember?"
"Well then, like you're

going clubbing," he

added impatiently.
"Never done that either," I said. "Twenty-one to-"
"Twenty-one to drink." Nav finished. "God, I hate
this bloody country."
I'd rehearsed my story on the way over. First year,
master's student. Classics. Grew up in rural Maryland;
undergrad at Georgetown. My life as a grad student,
based loosely on real events.
The event's organizers pointed me toward an arm
chair in the corner, and — with the jingle of a bell —
the dating began. In their allotted three minutes, some

of my dates spoke passionately
about their studies; others de-

scribed their favorite restau
rants, or a club in the city.
'ITiere was the Musicology I
student, a playful flirt who J
teased me mercilessly, and I

the French Canadian, who ■
had the whole room ■
wrapped around his finger.
I even met a Texan who
shared my love for Santorini,
sushi, and jazz.

"To tell you the
truth," confessed A
Date 15, taking AI
his seat across
from nie,
"You're the

first one I noticed. Hie redhead in the red dress? Kind
of intimidating."
...the first thing I'd noticed about him? He was tall;
most male grad students are.
And, hey — contrary to what you may've heard —
they're not bad looking, either. I counted several cuties
in the crowd; one. an Ed school student, was downright
gorgeous.
Grad students are a little awkward, but they're also
smart, funny, and endearingly sweet. Now, every time 1
catch a glimpse of a bike helmet, my heart leaps a little.
I'll be honest — I might be grad-crazy.
The next day, an email arrived with my speed dating
matches. I'd wanted to put down a "yes" for everyone.

but I tried to eliminate the oldest ones. To my sur
prise. almost two-thirds had chosen me back, includ
, ing some of the studliest in the group. But when 1
I realized that two of my favorites —an adorable
I EE co-term, and the Mechanical Engineer with an
unforgettable smile — hadn't put me on their lists,
my heart sank.

Just then, my phone rang. It was my mother.
"Oh honey" she said, when she'd heard what hap
pened. "Rejection always hurts."

'But," I started,"They were-"
"Rejection always hurts." she re
k peated."Even when it comes from a grad
student."
