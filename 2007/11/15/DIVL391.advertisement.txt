WELCOME BACK TO
THE PEDESTRIAN
ZONE!
Bg Bill Larson, Pedestrian Zone Supervisor
I am happy to report that you have returned to an even safer Pedestrian
Zone with the addition of the two traffic circles and sidewalks on Lasuen
Mall and White Plaza. We ask that bicycles, vehicles, and carts follow the
correct route around these circles, and pedestrians use the sidewalks, to
avoid accidents and ensure the safety of all who share this pedestrian
mall.
We would also like to remind bicyclists to NOT ride or park their bicycles
in the arcades such as those located at the Main Quad, Old Union, and
Green Library. The Department of Public Safety may soon begin im
pounding or locking in place bicycles that are parked in violation of this
restriction. When this phase of enforcement begins, the bicycle owner
will be required to pay a fee to recover a bicycle that has been impound
ed or locked by the Department of Public Safety. In addition to the fee,
the bicycle will need to be licensed before it can be released in accor
dance with Santa Clara County Ordinance Section 85-19. Also, the op
eration of a skateboard, in-line skate, roller skate, or similar device in an
arcade is prohibited under Santa Clara County Ordinance, Sections 85-
30 and 85-33.
In closing, the Department of Public Safety, Parking & Transportation
Services, and the University Administration THANK YOU for your con
tinued cooperation and contribution to the success of the Pedestrian
Zone policy now in its second year.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the policy, please
feel free to email Bill Larson at: william.larson@stanford.edu
Have a GREAT and SAFE year!
