TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT HOW YOU RECYCLE.
THEN TAKE THE PLEDGE.
Recycling has come a long way since its inception. Now, we have program across the
country to recycle paper, plastic, aluminum, cell phones and even computers, as well as
a wealth of consumer goods made out of recycled content. All of which prompts us to
ask, are you recycling the old way, or the new way?
Twenty years ago, only one curbside recycling program existed in all of the United
States. Today, there are more than 10,000 curbside programs across the nation.
While this is a huge step, there are easy ways we can all do more.
In honor of America Recycles Day on November 15th, we ask that you make it a
priority to step up your recycling efforts this year. Start by taking our pledge arid then
send the link to a friend. Follow up with a visit to AmericaßecyclesDay.org to get tips
on how you can improve recycling in your home and community. Because when you
recycle, it all comes back to you. /
