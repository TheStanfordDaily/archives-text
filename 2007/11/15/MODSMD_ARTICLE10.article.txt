## Don't KNOW DORMMATES? Date Them Manz set-up game sparks friendship 
### CHELSEA MA 
Sarah Macway's idea of a nice date in
volves a romantic dinner off campus
with some friendly conversation. After
filling out a survey last week, she found
one, minus the romance.

"We went out for sushi in Palo Alto at
a place called Miyake," she said. "It was
n't super romantic, but it went great. You
could say it was a friendly date rather
than a mushy date."
Macway' 10 and her date, Jett Fein '09,
were participants in the Manz Dating
Game. Far from being shady, the game, in
its second year, has no further aim other
than to give Manzanita residents the
chance to branch out and get to know
more of their fellow dormmates.
"Manz has a reputation for being less
social than other parts of the campus."
said Eric Lin '09. a Kimball RA who
thought up the event."The dating game is
not really meant to match people up, but
rather just for people to meet each
other."
Residents who wanted to take part in
the game simply filled out a survey on
their interests and preferences, and
whether they wanted random hookups,
relationships, friendship or nothing at all.

Most students settled with

friendship.

"1 thought it would be a good
way to meet people because the
dorm isn't as social as it was last
year," Macway said. "I'm not dating any
one. so I wasn't opposed to it. but I wasn't
looking for anything out of it either."
That's not to say that nobody had ulte
rior motives.
"There are quite a few requests for
hookups." Lin said. "You'd be surprised."
Once participants were matched, they
had a little over a week to go on their
dates. Couples were encouraged to do
the unusual-say. kite flying or flower
picking-while keeping the budget under
$20.
Tracy Chou '09 and Tony Wu '10 kept
it sweet and simple with a picnic outside
of the Cantor Arts Center.
"Tony went to Safeway and bought a
picnic basket, flowers, sparkling cider,
fruit, cheese and bread," Chou said. "He

origi
nally wanted to go to
Half Moon Bay, but he
couldn't find a car."
Chou chose to participate because she
felt that the social scene made it hard to
approach new people. Alas, she already
knew Wu from work.
"So I guess I didn't really get to meet
someone new," she said."But it was good,
especially since it was a stressful week
end with midterms and projects. It was
nice being forced to take a few hours off
from coding."
Wu. who was set up by his roommate,
agreed.
"It was fun," he said. "I had a really
good time, so I guess I would do it again
next year."
This year, 78 of the 400 or so Manzani
ta residents participated in the game. It's
not quite as popular asToyon's, which has

been around
longer, but it's a
noticeable in
crease from last year.

"You really have to push people to do
itsaid Lin."l think we did a pretty good
job of advertising because we really try to
emphasize that it's not awkward — it's
fun."
Couples submitted two or three
photos to be judged for creativity. The
winners received $20 to $30 gift certifi
cates.
And though they have yet to find their
soulmates, participants can at least say
that they made a new acquaintance, if not
a new friend.
"The game really helps the atmos
phere of Manz," Lin said. "It's just a good
way for us to build a community."
