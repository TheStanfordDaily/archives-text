Top safety car models triple
over last year
WASHINGTON (AP) - The number of new
cars considered the safest by the insurance indus
try nearly tripled in the past year, helped by au
tomakers' push to make certain safety equipment
more widely available.
Ford Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. had the
most vehicles on the Insurance Institute for High
way Safety's annual list of the safest cars for the
2008 model year. Thirty-four vehicles received the
top safety pick designation for 2008, compared
with 13 vehicles from the 2007 model year.
Striking stagehands, producers
return to negotiations
NLW YORK (AP) - Striking stagehands and
Broadway producers are going back to the bargain
ing table, less than a week before the start of the lu
crative Thanksgiving holiday weekend when most
plays and musicals experience a box-office bonanza.
Negotiations will resume this weekend "at an

undisclosed place and time," the International Al
liance of Theatrical Stage Employees and the
League of American Theatres said Wednesday.
"No comment from either organization will he is
sued until further notice," both sides said in a joint
statement.
Was there pressure to return to the talks before
Thanksgiving, when the city is filled with visitors
here for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and
the start of the Christmas shopping season?
"It was a factor," said Norman Samnick, an en
tertainment lawyer who specializes in labor rela
tions for Bryan Cave LLP. "It doesn't surprise me
that this is happening. What the end-all will be, I
have no idea. But somebody is going to give a lit
tle; somebody is going to take a little."
Clinton comes out against
licenses for illegal immigrants
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Wednesday came out against granting
driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, after weeks
of pressure in the presidential race to take a posi
tion on a now-failed ID plan from her home state
governor.
Clinton has faced criticism from candidates in

both parties for her noncommittal answers on
New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's attempt to allow il
legal immigrants in his state to receive driver's li
censes. Spitzer abandoned the effort Wednesday.
"I support Governor Spitzer's decision today to
withdraw his proposal," Clinton said in a state
ment. "As president, 1 will not support driver's li
censes for undocumented people and will press for
comprehensive immigration reform that deals with
all of the issues around illegal immigration includ
ing border security and fixing our broken system."
Clinton stumbled when asked about the issue
during a Democratic debate two weeks ago, and
her new position comes the day before another de
bate where opponents are expected to raise the
issue again.
Rival campaigns made clear they were not let
ting go of the issue.
"When it takes two weeks and six different po
sitions to answer one question on immigration, it's
easier to understand why the Clinton campaign
would rather plant their questions than answer
them," said Barack Obama spokesman Bill Bur
ton, referring to the Clinton campaign's admission
that aides had staged a question for her at an lowa
event.
Colleen Flanagan, a spokesman for Chris
Dodd. called Clinton's position "flip-flopping
cubed. She was for it before she was against it, be
fore she was for it, before she was against it."
