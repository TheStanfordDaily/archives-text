Prof. Patrick Geary delivered a lec
ture to a packed Pigott Hall last night
on "Modern European Nationalism
and the Fight to Control the Past."
Geary stressed the danger of using
medieval history to justify the cre
ation of nation-states in the 19th cen
tury' and today.
"I am astounded at the size of the
turnout," Geary told a crowd of stu
dents, faculty and community mem
bers â€” including many seated in
aisles and on stairs and tables. "1 am
not the new professor at the Hoover
Institute, that's someone else," he
continued, drawing laughs with a jab
at the controversial appointment of
former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld as a distinguished visiting
fellow at Stanford's think tank.
The lecture was the first in a new
series called "Medieval Matters,"
sponsored by Stanford Continuing
Studies, the Serum Seminar and the
Stanford Program in Medieval Stud
ies.
Introducing Geary, History Prof.
Philippe Buc stressed the importance
of medieval history, if only to prevent
its misuse.
"Far from being an exotic, sunken
and forever lost world, the Middle
Ages still have lessons for the pres

ent," Buc said.
"Ilie Middle Ages are back,"
Geary responded, "and that's not
necessarily a good thing, not even for
medievalists."
Geary said that historically-fu
elled nationalism remains a danger
ous factor in European politics even
today. The creation of "pseudo-histo
ries" by ethnic groups attempting to
forge states creates a climate of revi
sionism. He cited the example of the
Basque kingdom, which straddled
present-day Spain and France under
King Sancho 111 at the beginning of
the 11th century.
"The implication is clear." Geary
said of nationalists who cite this his
torical precedent. "The Basque soci
ety was an autonomous polity in the
11th century, and it should be again."
Geary, who is the author of sever
al books on medieval history includ
ing "The Myth of Nations: The Me
dieval Origins of Europe," argued
that the creation of ethnic and na
tional histories to justify the creation
and consolidation of states took off
in the 19th century. German histori
ans and philologists, or historical lin
guists, pioneered the field, but it soon
spread across Europe.
"Those were the good old days
of the 19th century, when chairs for
medieval history were established,"
he said to laughter. "Most of the
medieval history chairs in France
were endowed after 1870. when
French people realized they had
lost the Franco-Prussian War be
cause the Germans were better
philologists."
According to Geary, though, these
nationalist constructions were exag

gerated, leading to a racist view of
history that fueled hatred and con
flict. '
"It's more important to think of
what our sources talk about as 'peo
ples' as constitutional rather than bi
ological units," he said.
According to Geary, tribal alle
giances were malleable even in the
Middle Ages.
"Goths could become Huns, and
then again Goths," Geary explained.
"Romans could become Franks."
Geary also cast doubt on the use
of medieval history for seemingly
positive ideological ends. The idea of
"Europe" as an organic whole with a
unified past has been used to demon
strate that the European Union has
historical antecedents, he said.
Although the European Union's
creation has helped maintain peace
among the nations of that continent,
Geary warned that the use of histor
ical rhetoric may solidify a European
identity, with negative results.
"There is a danger that 'Euro
pean' may be defined as a new na
tion, a new people, to be opposed to
a non-European other," he said.
Even if the European historical
myth is benevolent, Geary said, it re
mains untrue.
"1 believe in Europe, but 1 have to
be fair," he said. "And as a historian
who is skeptical of national manipu
lation of the past to create division in
the present. I also have to be con
cerned about international manipu
lation of the past to create unity in the
present."
