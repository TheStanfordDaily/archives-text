## Speaker slams global warming Researcher argues warming is due to cyclical heating and cooling

•'Man has made global warming a myth/' claimed
1 loover Institution research fellow Siegfried Fred Singer
during yesterday's talk titled "Is global warming a
myth?" The event, which was put on by The Stanford Re
view as part of its weekly luncheon series, offered an al
ternative view to common arguments about global
warming.
The former space scientist and government scientific
administrator, who is co-author of the bestselling book,
"Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years."
claimed that observed warming is produced by the sun
and that "human contribution is negligible." Singer's re
search suggests that for the past million years, the Earth
has gone through warming and cooling phrases that have
lasted about 1,500 years each. He writes that these phas
es are in no way correlated with carbon dioxide levels.
Singer passed out sugar cookies with "Every 1,500
Years" written in frosting before he began his talk.
Hie speaker explained that the recent warming the
Earth has experienced is not dangerous and is not some
thing humans could alter. Global warming activists such
as A 1 Gore, Singer chided, are hyping the problem. He
said that such activists have not come close to demon
strating that human-generated greenhouse gases are
contributing to global warming.
Singer also criticized a back-to-nature mentality.
"Nature is not good and cuddly," he said. "It is harsh

and it will kill you."
"If we have a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emis
sions by 80 percent," he added, "that means we will have
to drive and use our air-conditioning systems only one
day out of the week.The real danger is our loss of liberty,
our loss of freedom."
If politicians truly wanted to make a change to affect
energy use. Singer said, they would have to increase taxes
on gasoline, which would decrease use of vehicles. I le be
lieves that such taxes would hit people of low income the
hardest.
The speaker claimed that many businesses, such as the
wind farm industry, are making money off the global
warming hype. Singer said that it is essential to convince
the proponents of global warming that what they are
doing is counterproductive and will not make any differ
ence to the climate.
"We have students for sustainable development
marching in D.C.," he said. "How do we talk to people
like that? Somehow we have to convince the powers that
be that this is useless."
"If [they] think changing light bulbs in California is
going to make a difference and reduce carbon dioxide
levels, they don't have their heads on right," he added,
"especially when China is building a coal plant every
week."
Paul Craft "09, an editor at Hie Stanford Review, said
he appreciated the speaker's unconventional views.
"He made an interesting argument — the nature of
science is to have a debate about the evidence," Craft
said. "Therefore, I think it's healthy to have dissenting
opinions regardless of where you stand of the issue."
