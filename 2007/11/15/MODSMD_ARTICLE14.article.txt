## Editorial Board Rankings and grades 
### 
The number crunchers at the US. News
& World Report consistently list Stan
ford among the top five American uni
versities. As a result, our merit as students
and individuals is invariably linked to the
questionable calculus of these rankings.
Some of us take the time to rail against the
rankings. We may dive into the formulas and
notice that perhaps factors such as alumni
contributions are not the best indicators of
education quality. We can single out heavily
influential factors such the perceived rela
tive prestige of a university as both subjec
tive and problematically self-reinforcing.
The New York Times reported that "the
quantitative precision of the purely academ
ic ratings, especially at the tippy top, can
seem arbitrary â€” absurd, almost. When
Caltech surged from No. 9 to No. 1 in the
2000 edition of U.S. News & World Report's
'"best national universities" list, it was
thanks to a change in the scoring formula ...
not to any meaningful improvement." I low
ever, criticize as we may. the fact remains
that our lives have been, and will be. partial
ly shaped and influenced by the sometimes
arbitrary, sometimes absurd scoring formu
las of rating wizards like those at U.S. News
& World Report.
Ratings wizards are merchants of pres
tige. By choosing the elements that factor
into their formulas, they exercise profound
influence on how we value educational or
ganizations. This becomes dangerous when
readers don't actively seek to understand
the concrete factors that determine our
fuzzy notions of prestige. Because ratings
can also affect the way that these organiza
tions actually act, it is doubly important for
individuals to be aware of the metrics by
which things are judged. When ratings be
come powerful, institutions are stripped
down to the skeleton of the statisticians'
score card instead of the flesh and nerves
that experts in a given field know to be sub
stance of that organization. Knotty and
complex questions are reduced to combina
tions of numerically quantifiable factors.
Building a Better Legal Profession is a
national grassroots movement of law stu
dents who hope to create market pressures
that will stimulate workplace reform in the
nation's largest private law firms. Although
the students of Stanford Law School who
spearheaded this movement are a force to

be reckoned with, in the litigious environ
ment of modern America, anyone who takes
on the task of reforming "big law" is taking
on Goliath. So what was the weapon of
choice for this organization's struggle to im
prove diversity, increase pro bono work and
restore a sliver of humanity to the lives of
entry-level corporate lawyers? The group
created a simple system of arranging avail
able online data about firms. They ranked
the firms against one another based on fac
tors such as diversity, and then graded each
firm with a letter A through F. Copy, paste
and rank. It seems like a simple formula.and
it is. yet it has won Building a Better Legal
Profession press and praise across the na
tion. Creating a grading system that ranks
law firms based on something other than
profits is a neat way of capitalizing on Amer
ica's passion for rankings while changing
traditional paradigms of prestige.
Ratings systems pressure the scrutinized
organizations to focus on the factors that ap
pear on the score card. The Bush adminis
tration's No Child Left Behind Act has long
been criticized for ranking schools based on
standardized testing. The effect of this poli
cy, many educators argued, was that as
money was pumped into drilling students
for tests, the depth and quality of education
suffered. Organizations distribute their re
sources to improve the factors that they are
rated on. ITiis illustrated how ratings levy
the prestige that they bestow to effectively
influence organizational decision making.
In considering the prestige of universi
ties, schools, corporations and the litany of
other things that we like to put in numerical
order and slap a grade onto, the ratings con
sumer should be aware of the assumptions
that underlie the information they are con
suming. If one doesn't believe that high
alumni giving rates or the size of a universi
ty's endowment correlates with the quality
of education at a given university, perhaps
one should be cautious about accepting rat
ings calculated based on such factors. Simi
larly, if one does not believe that profit mar
gins for partners are the best measures of a
private law firm, then perhaps one should
think twice about using profit-based metrics
to choose a prestigious place of work.

hands. Building a Better Legal Pro
fession has picked a powerful tool
for reforming the legal profession.
By building a report card for firms
based on quality-of-life factors, this
group puts quality of life back on the
map of factors that should be ac
counted for when firms are com
pared against one another. Revamp
ing ratings is a time-consuming proj
ect, and not something that we can
all accomplish with ease. However,
stopping short of implementing bet
ter and more relevant rating sys
tems, the best that we can do as con
sumers is to be wary of the assump
tions about quality and worth that
underlie every rating system.
