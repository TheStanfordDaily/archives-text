## Get some cute in your life 
### 
Ever feel lonely? Unloved? How
about the opposite — having a sur
plus of love that you could give out?
These states of mind hit us pretty often, so
it's important to have benefactors of love as
well as objects of affection. But the humans,
drugs, food, homework and devices that
typically fulfill these functions are unreli
able and unsatisfactory at best. Face it: your
significant other will and has cheated on
you, your friends don't understand you,
homework is absent several months out of
the year, and drugs ... well, let's leave drugs
out of this.
The only things that can reliably fill your
love needs are cute animals. With hearts of
gold, no ulterior motives and constant com
panionship. cute animals can put out as
much love as they take in. Can you honest
ly say that you receive as many warm nuz
zles or let out as many squeals of joy with a
human as opposed to a cute little puppy?
Aside from increasing personal happiness,
cute animals help keep society strong. Case
in point is Japan: They have cute animals or
depictions of them everywhere: subways,
sidewalks, anime, food, school books ... And
the result? One of the most cohesive, paci
fist and orderly societies in the world. The
abundance of cute animals works so well
that when people get angry or sad in Japan,
they tend to take it out on themselves, not
others, thus the high rate of suicide and low
rate of homicide.
What exactly constitutes a cute animal?
Check out Cute Overload.com, the world's
leading authority on cuteness. It features
pictures from a wide variety of very cute
creatures, organized by animal as well as
other categories, like inter-species loving or
"C'ats'n' Racks."CuteOverload has revolu
tionized the way we think about cuteness by
creating the "Rules of Cuteness," which at
tempt to catalog what exactly creates cute
ness. Also worth noting is
StuffOnMyCat.com. where people send in
photos of random stuff — such as dolls,
clothing, other animals or Flava Flav alarm
clocks — piled on top of their cats. You'd be
surprised at the feline's level of tolerance,
and the combination of a cute creature and
funny situations always leaves you with a
smile.
I'd like to shift the focus to the cute crea
tures themselves, but not your standard cat

or dog — more like amazingly cute crea
tures that are off the beaten track. I want to
introduce a few exotic creatures that epito
mize cute and that, if a part of your life,
make you wholly satisfied like no other
thing in this world could.
Hedgehogs: Although I have warm feel
ings for all hedgehogs, it's specifically the
small African Pygmy hedgehog that has
stolen my heart. Their cuteness stems from
a variety of things. One is their tiny, aesthet
ic, well-defined features — hedgehogs are
far more beautiful than any other small ro
dent. They have this never-ending look of
inquisitiveness that is decidedly cute. And
perhaps because they are covered with
spikes, making you work harder to get to
their cuteness, you end up appreciating
their non-spiky features that much more.
(By the way, you can still hold hedgehogs,
spikes and all.)
Owl Monkeys: I was watching a docu
mentary about these researchers from MIT,
Duke and SUNY who pulled off an amaz
ing feat: training a monkey to control a ro
botic arm simply by its brain activity, via
electrodes placed directly in its brain. Al
though it was a scientific breakthrough, I
was struck by how incredibly cute the owl
monkey was — a kind, friendly-looking
thing with big eyes, like an owl. Look it up
on Google Images or email me for a picture
to truly understand its cuteness. It would be
a heart-wrenching battle if I had to choose
between an owl monkey or a hedgehog to
keep as a pet.
Sloths: I need to qualify my decision to
talk about sloths by admitting that yes, they
are not the cutest things in the world. How
ever, I include them because they are the
friendliest-looking. If you had to rank ani
mals on how comfortable you would feel
walking up to them and starting a conversa
tion, sloths would rank first. Probably be
cause of the perpetual smile they have on
