## Biofuels policy: California leads, candidates fail 
### 
Changing the fuel we put in our cars can
help us in three ways. First, about a quar
ter of greenhouse gas emissions in the
United States comes from cars burning gaso
line, and the United States accounts for 45 per
cent of the world's total carbon emissions from
cars. The carbon in fossil fuel gasoline is re
leased into the atmosphere when burned, re
sulting in climate change.
Second, generating alternatives to fossil
fuels reduces the geopolitical leverage of coun
tries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and
Venezuela, and promotes the development of
more diverse economies and more representa
tive regimes in these countries. Seventy percent
of our domestic oil consumption is due to cars.
Third, the money we are not sending to Iran
can be invested in the American heartland —
perhaps the first economic good news rural
America has had in five decades.
But how we approach this problem will de
termine how effectively biofuels meet these
objectives — carbon reduction, a geopolitical
shift and rural economic development. Poorly
designed policies will be expensive, produce lit
tle change in greenhouse gas pollution, and will
give money to established business interests
rather than small farmers.
The main ethanol candidate crop in the
United States is corn. Corn is an unfortunate
replacement for sugar cane, the main crop used
in ethanol programs abroad. Corn can produce
around 40f) gallons of ethanol per acre, com
pared to 650 for sugar. Corn also requires large
amounts of fossil fuel-based fertilizers to be

grown commercially, meaning that large
amounts of oil are being used to produce this
fuel. Currently in the United States, for every
10 gallons of gasoline replaced by corn ethanol,
about eight gallons of gasoline are burned.
Corn also requires large amounts of pesticides
to grow, producing harmful environmental im
pacts.
A more promising technology is cellulosic
ethanol, which makes ethanol from cellulose
instead of starch. Cellulose accounts for much
of the substance of plant matter, but is more dif
ficult to distill into ethanol. There are a few
commercial plants producing cellulosic
ethanol. but it is still in its infancy. Construction
began this month on a 1 (K) million-gallon-per
year plant in the United States, the first of its
size.
Because cellulosic ethanol can be made
from any plant matter, it does not require di
verting croplands. There is no added fertilizer
needed for a refinery running on agricultural
waste, meaning that the ten gallons of ethanol
are produced from basically zero fossil fuels.
Cellulosic ethanol can also be produced from
fast-growing plants such as switchgrass, which

does not require much fertilizer or pesticide
and can he grown in marginal soils.
How can government policy he used to pro
mote hiofuels? In general, the government is
better suited to setting goals than to finding in
novative ways to meet those goals. When can
didates promote corn ethanol through subsi
dies, they create a federally-dependent indus
try — one that will quickly learn that it easier
to make money by lobbying than through hon
est work. Proponents of subsidies claim that
they will help get the industry off the ground
and then be eliminated, but in fact farm subsi
dies have only grown since they have been in
troduced. In addition, about three-quarters of
subsidies goto large businesses instead of small
farmers.
Instead of picking winners and losers, the
government should set a standard and let the
market take care of the rest. By setting a stan
dard — such as a 10 percent carbon reduction
for auto fuels by 2020 — farmers, refiners, dis
tributors, vendors, automakers, researchers and
investors all know that there will be a market
for carbon-efficient fuels. Different firms and
technologies can then compete to create the
most cost-effective solution — which may be
starch or cellulose, EIO or EB5. hydrogen and
electric cars, or some new technology that has
not yet been developed.
This is exactly the approach Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger has taken with the Low Car
bon Fuel Standard, the worlds first carbon

standard for transportation fuels. His
program also allows providers to buy
and sell fuel carbon credits, so pro
ducers who exceed the standard will

be able to take their innovations to
the bank.
Unfortunately, this impressive,
gold-standard public policy is not
being adopted on the national stage.
Scrambling for votes in lowa, none of
the presidential contenders have fol
lowed Schwarzenegger's lead. Obama
and Clinton's plans rely heavily on
per-gallon subsidies for ethanol and

various dollar giveaways to install
ethanol pumps and refineries. Given
the fertilizer costs, these plans are just
wasting foreign oil. Adopting
Schwarzenegger's standards would be
a better approach.
