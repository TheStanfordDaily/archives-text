## Debating anything but Rumsfeld 
### 
Eight yeas,five nays and two abstentions.
It was a fitting end on Ihesday night, as
the Undergraduate Senate's oft-tabled
Donald Rumsfeld bill failed by two votes to
whispers of "it passed."
The bill stated, in short, that Rumsfeld s
was a questionable appointment. It argued
that his fellowship at Hoover would hurt
Stanford's reputation by association. It didn't
ask senators to judge Rumsfeld's actions. It
asked them to say he was unpopular and con
troversial. Since when. I might ask from the
wings of a packed hall debating a seemingly
separate bill, do we oppose academic ap
pointments because they are scary?
Welcome to politics, some might say You

have to make compromises.
I've been here for over four years, and I
doubt you could find a group of 6,(KH) people
more turned on by the idea of compromise.
But this wasn'i compromise or even "wa
tering down": this was confusion and fear.
Let's get back to a petition, frequently
cited, that 4.(KK) people from Stanford DID
sign: "We view the appointment as funda
mentally incompatible with the ethical values
of truthfulness, tolerance, disinterested en
quiry, respect for national and international
laws, and care for the opinions, property and
lives of others to which Stanford is inalienably
committed."
There's a real statement There's a voice I

can agree with.
The undergraduate senators I heard argue
against the hill said that their body was ap
proaching a "slippery' slope;" that the Senate
"isn't the right venue;" that the Rumsfeld de
hate "distracted" from their important work
on campus.
For a moment, one opposing senator ques
tioned why we should oppose someone he
cause he is politically controversial. Yet he did
so with a smirk, interested more in cornering
his opposition than in the content of his ques
tion. The moment was soon gone, and then it
was hack to "is this our role?"
