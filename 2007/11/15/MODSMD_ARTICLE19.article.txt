## Debating anything but Rumsfeld 
### 
Eight yeas,five nays and two abstentions.
It was a fitting end on Ihesday night, as
the Undergraduate Senate's oft-tabled
Donald Rumsfeld bill failed by two votes to
whispers of "it passed."
The bill stated, in short, that Rumsfeld s
was a questionable appointment. It argued
that his fellowship at Hoover would hurt
Stanford's reputation by association. It didn't
ask senators to judge Rumsfeld's actions. It
asked them to say he was unpopular and con
troversial. Since when. I might ask from the
wings of a packed hall debating a seemingly
separate bill, do we oppose academic ap
pointments because they are scary?
Welcome to politics, some might say You

have to make compromises.
I've been here for over four years, and I
doubt you could find a group of 6,(KH) people
more turned on by the idea of compromise.
But this wasn'i compromise or even "wa
tering down": this was confusion and fear.
Let's get back to a petition, frequently
cited, that 4.(KK) people from Stanford DID
sign: "We view the appointment as funda
mentally incompatible with the ethical values
of truthfulness, tolerance, disinterested en
quiry, respect for national and international
laws, and care for the opinions, property and
lives of others to which Stanford is inalienably
committed."
There's a real statement There's a voice I

can agree with.
The undergraduate senators I heard argue
against the hill said that their body was ap
proaching a "slippery' slope;" that the Senate
"isn't the right venue;" that the Rumsfeld de
hate "distracted" from their important work
on campus.
For a moment, one opposing senator ques
tioned why we should oppose someone he
cause he is politically controversial. Yet he did
so with a smirk, interested more in cornering
his opposition than in the content of his ques
tion. The moment was soon gone, and then it
was hack to "is this our role?"
A few minutes later, 1 heard an
impassioned speech about why, yes,
of course the Senate could oppose
Rumsfeld. After all, what body is
there other than the ASSU Under
graduate Senate to represent the
voice of undergraduates at Stanford?
Unfortunately, though, the Senate
reflected Stanford's undergraduate

population perfectly. Yes, Stanford
undergrads oppose Rumsfeld, when
they give him any thought. Yes, Stan
ford students have deep moral be
liefs about politics. But students don't
know where to channel these pas
sionate thoughts. No one knows the
right "venue" to express his or her be
liefs. Every one is wrong — email
lists, rallies, sections, debates, lectures,
the Undergraduate Senate — you're
either wasting people's time or
you're being naive.
So we're confined to our hallway
discussions, and by then we've been

practicing our impressive and impar
tial voices for so long that we are ter
rified to say what we believe. So now
allow me to do so: I believe that Stan
ford is trying to constrain you. 1 be
lieve that the school's administra
tion. many of your professors, and a
large number of your friends are
scared to hear you speak your mind.
Next time you think twice about
what to say and where to say it. think
again.
