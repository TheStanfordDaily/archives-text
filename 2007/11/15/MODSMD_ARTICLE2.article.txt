## Barriers block int'l students GSC hears talk on restrictive visa policies 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, re
minded the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) last night that some inter
national students may face delays or
denials regarding their student visas.
The University has lost some stu
dents due to federal immigration
regulations, he said.
Currently, international students
are refused under Section 214(h) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act
if they are unable to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of a consular officer
that they have sufficiently strong and
long-term family,social and econom
ic ties outside the United States.
When students do not provide such
information, they are required to re
turn home, Pearson said.
He added that U.S. intelligence
agencies are performing security
checks — which are not issued or
done by the University — on some
graduate international students de
pending on their country of origin or
research subject.
"If you are an international stu
dent doing research in the US. who is
coming from countries such as Iran.
Pakistan. Syria, Cuba, North Korea
or any country predominantly Mus
lim." Pearson said,"you are probably
going to have a security check."
