## Barriers block int'l students GSC hears talk on restrictive visa policies 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, re
minded the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) last night that some inter
national students may face delays or
denials regarding their student visas.
The University has lost some stu
dents due to federal immigration
regulations, he said.
Currently, international students
are refused under Section 214(h) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act
if they are unable to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of a consular officer
that they have sufficiently strong and
long-term family,social and econom
ic ties outside the United States.
When students do not provide such
information, they are required to re
turn home, Pearson said.
He added that U.S. intelligence
agencies are performing security
checks — which are not issued or
done by the University — on some
graduate international students de
pending on their country of origin or
research subject.
"If you are an international stu
dent doing research in the US. who is
coming from countries such as Iran.
Pakistan. Syria, Cuba, North Korea
or any country predominantly Mus
lim." Pearson said,"you are probably
going to have a security check."
Stanford itself does not issue a
background security check.
"Our goal is to help the students,"
Pearson said. "We are just told if a
student has been cleared or not."
While the majority of back
ground checks are done quickly,
some may take months. According to
Pearson, there is no guarantee that a
visa will be issued after a back
ground check.
All universities in the United
States are required by law to report
electronically to U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement if an in
ternational student changes his ad
dress, name or major. Universities
must also report if a visa extension is
needed or if a student is graduating
early.
Pearson explained that this
process is done through the Student
and Exchange Visitor Information
System (SEVIS), a computer net
work set up by the United States
government that tracks information
on non-immigrant students.

"We don't send anything through
SEVIS without checking first with
the student, who needs to under
stand what it means if we send such
information." Pearson said.
According to Pearson, Bechtel
gets approximately 150 alerts in any
given day. ()lten. these alerts are sim
ply due to a student's change of ad
dress.
Bechtel sends emails and notifi
cations to international students, re
minding them of their obligations.
But if, for example, a student does
not enroll before the University's
deadlines, Stanford is required by
law to terminate his or her student
status.
Pearson said the number of stu
dents who are terminated is usually
low.
"In the past four years we have
only terminated 10 students who
didn't enroll," Pearson said.
Alex Ene, an aeronautic and as
tronautic engineering doctoral stu
dent candidate, asked what would
happen if by mistake, a student were
to mistakenly appear as not being
enrolled. In the past, there have been
problems with the Stanford billing
process and holds have been issued
on students' accounts when in actu

ality. they have already paid. Ene
said.
Pearson replied that the Bechtel
International Center always double
checks with a student before report
ing him through SEVIS.
"We don't do anything without
informing the student first." he said.
While the University doesn't
want international students worry
ing about their stay. Pearson encour
aged them to be informed.
1 le also reminded the GSC to dis
seminate the information that inter
national students should not work
without authorization.
"Official regulations state that
while you may work on campus, like
in the bookstore, you can't start a
business in your dorm room." Pear
son said.
Pearson also reminded the coun
cil that, when it comes to travel and
re-entry to the United States, stu
dents and scholars on F-l and J-l
visas who travel overseas for a con
ference or for family or academic
reasons should know that there may
be a lengthy delay in returning to the
United States.
