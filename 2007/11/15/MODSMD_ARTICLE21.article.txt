GAME NOUS: Stanford is 3-0 going into tonight's game,
its best start to the season in four years. Tonight marks
Northwestern's first game of the year. The Cardinal pre
vailed in last year's matchup, coming away with a hard
fought 58-53 decision at Maples Pavilion.

"It's a good start for us." coach Trent
Johnson said to ESPN.com. "The thing that
impressed me with this group this weekend,
regardless of who we're playing we're play
ing with energy right now. We kept playing
hard."
Although the game will be played on the
road, the Wildcats might not provide more of
a challenge than Stanford's previous oppo
nents. Northwestern has been a perennial
doormat when it comes to Big Ten basket
ball. and they showed few signs of change in
a scrappy eight-point exhibition victory over
Division-11l University of Chicago.
The Wildcats are also a very young team,
featuring only one senior. They started three
freshmen in their preseason opener: forward
Nikola Baran, point guard Michael "Juice"
Thompson and guard/forward Mike Capoc
ci. Rounding out the team's starting five in
the exhibition game were junior guard Ster
ling Williams and guard/forward Jeff Ryan.
Despite their inexperience, the freshmen
may be a bright spot for the Wildcats. Capoc
ci led the team with IS points and nine re
bounds against Chicago. Thompson also
chipped in with 14 points and five assists.
"Early on. I think our veterans are going
to have to lead us in scoring and how you go
about stuff," Northwestern coach Bill Car
mody told ESPN.com. "But I really like our
two freshmen. As far as goals and stuff, we're
still trying to figure it out, to tell you the
truth."

Other notable Wildcat players are senior
transfer Jason Okrzesik and junior guard
Craig Moore. Okrzesik had 15 points in the
Wildcats' exhibition victory while Moore
was the second-leading scorer on last year's
team, averaging 8.1 points per game.
Northwestern will also be without the aid
of one if its best players, sophomore forward
Kevin Coble, who is on a leave of absence
from the team while his mother undergoes
cancer treatment. Coble led the Wildcats last
year with 13.4 points and 5.2 rebounds per
game.
On paper. Northwestern is overmatched

by the Cardinal. The Wildcats have a meager
frontline; Baran is the team's tallest player,
checking in at 6 feet 7 inches. Coach Bill Car
mody will have a hard time countering the
Stanford frontline — despite the fact that
Stanford is still without star big man Brook
Lopez, who will miss six more games due to
academic ineligibility, 6-foot-8-inch
Lawrence Hill and seven-footer Robin
Lopez will give the Wildcats all they can han
dle and more.
The Cardinal also outmatch Northwestern
on the perimeter with the shooting of junior
guard Anthony Goods and the ball-handling

of point guards Mitch Johnson and Drew
Shiller. Sophomore wing Landry I ields may
provide a boost off the bench ii the team is
cold from the floor.
At 3-0. the Cardinal is off to its best start
since the 2003-2004 season, in which the
squad was ranked No. 1 in the country and
was a top seed in the NCAA tournament.
Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time
in Welsh-Ryan Arena.The game will be tele
vised on the Big Ten Network, but will be
broadcast locally on KN is 1120 AM.
