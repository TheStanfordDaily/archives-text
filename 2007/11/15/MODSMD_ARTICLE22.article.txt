### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim team will trav
el to Southern California tomorrow for the
three-day DC-Irvine sponsored Nike Cup
Invite held from Nov. 15-17. The meet will
take place at the Belmont Olympic Plaza in
Long Beach, a facility with a history of elite
swimming. The Cardinal has won the event
four years in a row.
Also competing during the weekend will
be the dive team: the men will compete at
the Purdue Invitational running from Nov.
16-18 in West Lafayette, Ind.
The Nike Cup features 17 teams from all
NCAA divisions, including some stiff Divi
sion I competition: Brigham Young. IJC-
Irvine. Air Force. Pacific. UC Davis and Cal
State Northridge will all be competing
against the Cardinal. D-II UC-San Diego
and D-II I IJC'-Santa Cruz will represent
their respective divisions.

Going into the meet. No. 3 Stanford has
racked up two victories so far on the year:
wins over LSU (139-123) and Washington
(132-82).
"Team goals are fairly simple, as they are
quite similar year after year," explained sen
ior Danny Beal. "Win NCAAs (our main
competition will he Texas. Auburn and Ari
zona) and win our 27th consecutive Pac-1()
title. In order to accomplish those things,
we've also set a team goal of having every
single person drop time in every event at
NCAAs.
"Auburn did that last year and walked
away with a victory." he continued. "Our
team is talented enough that if everyone
swims their goal times, we'll win. The team
that walks off the deck with the trophy is the
one that can get the most swimmers swim
ming their best times."
Depth and consistently improving times
will be key for Stanford to achieve their
goals this season. Stanford h;is a particular-

captain Nate Cass, freshman John Criste,
senior F.gan Gans, junior captain Paul Korn

points in the 1(H)- and 2(X)-vard hreaststroke
for Stanford at each meet.
Cass and Kornfeld both scored
for the Card at NCAA champi

stroke, with a 2-3 finish in the latter.
Stanford coach Skip Kenney is in
his 29th season coaching the Cardi

team chemistry in a largely individ

"As always, the most important
part of finding success at the end of
the season is
derived from the atmosphere that
we create at the pool within the
team environment," said Zaich.
The Stanford divers will be a big
part of the team's success this year,
especially in dual meets where their
platform events can score crucial
points for the team. Junior diver
Dwight Dumais,an NCAA qualifier
last year, leads a talented field con
sisting of freshman Brent
Eichenseer, senior Nathan Kim and
junior Casey Weston, who are
coached by Dr. Rick Schavone, one
of the premier diving instructors in
the nation.
This will be a big weekend for
Stanford, as the mid-season races
start heating up after several months
of intense training. After the week
end's action, the Cardinal will be off
until the end of the month when it
competes at the Texas Invite held in
Austin, Texas.
