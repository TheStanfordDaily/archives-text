team

ship" during the Cardinal's 27- 1 ) loss to Washing
ton on Nov. 3.
"Him and I talked through things." llarbaugh
told the San Jose Mercury News.
"From the beginning, that's a matter for the
team and Richard and myself," he continued.
"Like anybody on the team, what's required of
Richard is no more or no less than anybody else
in terms of the standard of play that we're looking
for and the attitude and the behavior."
Sherman has been the Cardinal's best offensive
player this year, totaling b4(i receiving yards on 38
receptions with four touchdowns.

The standout receiver won't have a chance to
get back on the field this weekend, however; the
Cardinal has a bye week before it faces Notre
Dame at home on Nov. 24.

son was sidelined for the year after
tearing her ACL in the season open

2008 recruiting class and the skill
and depth that they will bring to our
program," VanDerveer told
GoStanford.com. "Lindy La
Rocque is a tremendous three-point
shooter with range who will help
open up i>ui offense. Sarah Boothe

possesses excellent back-to-the
ixisket moves and a strong physical
presence. Grace Mashore is an ex
cellent passer and shooter, and will
make the point position more com
petitive. We expect all to contribute
immediately."
