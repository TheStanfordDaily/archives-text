## Out with offensive mascots 
### 
It was a tragic death.Thousands of
people gathered tearfully to see
their hero for the final time, and
thousands more who were unable to.
attend had him in their thoughts.
ITiey knew the death was coming,
and had tried their utmost to pre
vent it — but even though the man
had lived a long life, they were not
ready to let him go.
So it might surprise you, after
reading this overly dramatic open
ing paragraph, that the dying man in
question wasn't even a real person: it
was Chief Illiniwek. mascot of the
University of Illinois Fighting Illini.
The Chief danced for the last
time in February of this year at a U
of 1 basketball game. His death came
as a result of the NCAA effectively
banning the use of all "hostile and
abusive" Native American imagery
by its member schools. However,
there is still quite a bit of controver
sy surrounding teams using Native
American mascots and logos, partic
ularly around pro teams like the
Cleveland Indians of the MLB and
the Washington Redskins of the
NFL. (Can you imagine a team
named the Whiteskins or the Black
skins? Didn't think so.)
Now this is all very interesting,
but what does it have to do with
Stanford? Interestingly, we were not
always the Stanford Cardinal. From
1930 to 1972. we were actually the
Stanford Indians. This was very sur
prising to me when I found out.
How could Stanford — a school
that prides itself on diversity and tol
erance, a school where cultural
events and groups abound — have
had such an ostensibly intolerant
mascot for so long?
I suppose, though, that it is better
to consider that we did away with
the mascot on our own, decades be
fore the NCAA imposed the ban,
rather than dwell on the fact that we
had an offensive mascot for 42 years.
Even more impressive, the move
ment to do away with the Indian was
student-initiated.
In 1972, a group of 55 Native
American Stanford students
brought the "insult" the mascot car
ried to the attention of then-Presi
dent Richard Lyman. The ASSU
Senate voted 18-4 to drop the Indian
mascot, and Lyman agreed. In fact,
to this day we still do not have an of
ficial mascot.This is more than made
up for, though, by the fact that we
have the coolest unofficial mascot in
the land — who doesn't love the
Tree?
Our lovable tree aside, the ques
tion remains: how could a bunch of
college students recognize that their
mascot was offensive four decades
ago. yet the businessmen who run
professional sports teams like the
Redskins still haven't changed their
mascots?
One issue is tradition. In many
cases, fans have spent their entire
lives rooting for their favorite teams.
Of course, changing a team's nick
name does not make the team any
different, nor does it negate all of the
team's past accomplishments while
using the old name. However, this
sentimental aspect still persists; see
the first paragraph of this column for
proof.
Another claim is that Indian mas
cots can be used to honor Native
Americans.This may be true in some
cases, but certainly not all.
Let's take Chief Wahoo, the
Cleveland Indians' grinning Native
American symbol. If he's honoring
Native Americans, there must be an
alternate definition for the word
"honor" that includes both carica
turing and domesticating. Unfortu
nately. I haven't gotten the memo on
that one yet.
Overall, there is not much we can
do about this.There have been many
protests and lots of publicity sur
rounding teams using Native Amer
ican imagery, but the pro leagues do
not seem to have any intention of
creating an NCAA-like ban. Indi
vidually. owners will have to realize
that tradition only means so much.
Actually, you might even find
more success with a new nickname
— looking at the list of recent Direc
tor's Cup winners over the last
decade, it seems like it's worked out
all right for us.
