service for Amazon.com. He spoke
about his experiences with customer
service in the talk, which was hosted

he said. "It everything works well,
then there is no need to expand the
customer service department, and
one could even reduce or close de
partments."

field, regardless of the institution
they are from."
"The Valley and businesses are so
broad and diverse," said Cindy

cater to a broad spectrum of people.
It is about imparting teachable skills
