# Flyers target bike parking violators
## Student patrol assists DPS in citing Pedestrian Zone infractions 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Most students know that hikes, skateboards
and rollerhlades are prohibited in the Pedestri
an Zone, hut may not realize that parking their

bikes in the Zone can warrant a police citation.
Since initiating a no-wheels policy in the Main
Quad arcades in August 2006, the Stanford Po
lice — teaming up with a group of hired students
— has been putting warning flyers on hikes
parked under the arcades.
Bill Larson, a services administrator at the
Department of Public Safety (DPS), is spear
heading the Student Special Events Patrol
(SSEP). line program, new this year, offers stu
dents jobs starting at $12 per hour to help DPS

enforce parking and event security on campus.
"All we do is put flyers on the bicycles that are
parked in violation of policy, such as in the ar
cadc," Larson said. "On an average business day,
we flyer about 10 to 15 bikes.
"Overall there has been a considerable com
pliance and acceptance of the parking policies,"
he added. "There has been no significant increase
or decrease in the number of parking violations."


The Department of Public Safety (DPS) is cracking down on bikes parked in improper areas by attaching warning flyers to such bikes. The Student
Special Events Patrol, formed by the DPS this year, assists with the flyering efforts. The Pedestrian Zone prohibits bikes, skateboards and rollerblades.
Sonic students who have received
this warning complain that a lack of
hike racks is the reason for parking
infractions.
However. Carolyn llelmke, the
bicycle program coordinator at
Parking and Transportation Sci vices
(P&TS), insisted that there are
enough bike racks on campus.
"In the majority of cases students
are not willing to walk the extra 25 or

50 feet to the nearest hike rack." she
said. "People expect the racks to he
right next to the entrance of a build
ing. hut that's not feasible with build
ings that hold 500 students."
Helnike discouraged students
from blocking entrances or locking
their bikes to handicap rails.
"When students lock their bikes
to the handicap rails, which is espe
cially common in MoMo, many dis
abled students can't use the rail to
move around," she said. "Students
should simply consider walking a lit
tle bit to a rack."
In addition to putting flyers on il
legally parked bikes. SSI • P hands out

flyers to people biking through the
arcades. But not everyone is cited.
' I've ridden through the Main
Quad arcades multiple times and
never been cited "said Kelly Bonney-
Ache'l l."I guess it's [hit-or-miss]."
Other students were surprised
that DPS is enforcing the parking
policies.
"I knew that there were places
you can't park, but 1 didn't know that
they actually enforced it." said Jeff
Pidlaoan '11. "There's a big gap be
tween rules and enforcement."
