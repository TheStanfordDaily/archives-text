# Flyers target bike parking violators
## Student patrol assists DPS in citing Pedestrian Zone infractions 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Most students know that hikes, skateboards
and rollerhlades are prohibited in the Pedestri
an Zone, hut may not realize that parking their

bikes in the Zone can warrant a police citation.
Since initiating a no-wheels policy in the Main
Quad arcades in August 2006, the Stanford Po
lice — teaming up with a group of hired students
— has been putting warning flyers on hikes
parked under the arcades.
Bill Larson, a services administrator at the
Department of Public Safety (DPS), is spear
heading the Student Special Events Patrol
(SSEP). line program, new this year, offers stu
dents jobs starting at $12 per hour to help DPS

enforce parking and event security on campus.
"All we do is put flyers on the bicycles that are
parked in violation of policy, such as in the ar
cadc," Larson said. "On an average business day,
we flyer about 10 to 15 bikes.
"Overall there has been a considerable com
pliance and acceptance of the parking policies,"
he added. "There has been no significant increase
or decrease in the number of parking violations."


The Department of Public Safety (DPS) is cracking down on bikes parked in improper areas by attaching warning flyers to such bikes. The Student
Special Events Patrol, formed by the DPS this year, assists with the flyering efforts. The Pedestrian Zone prohibits bikes, skateboards and rollerblades.
