# Judicial Charter expands
## New amendment gives Board on Judicial Affairs off-campus jurisdiction 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Criminal offenses committed tiff
campus may no longer be out of the
jurisdiction of the University. Two
pending amendments to Stanford's
Student Judicial Charter could sig
nificantly expand the control of the
Board on Judicial Affairs, as well as
the statute of limitations on violent
crimes.
While on-campus offenses cur
rently fall under the authority of the
Board, the first proposed amend
ment would add a clause to the Char
ter's introduction that would expand
the Board's jurisdiction to include
some events that occur off the Farm.
The amendment specifically states
that, "University judicial policy ap
plies year-round to all on-campus ac
tivities, and to any acts that threaten
the safety and integrity of the Uni
versity community regardless of
where such acts occur."
Education Prof. Eamonn C'allan,
former co-chair of the Board on Judi
cial Affairs, says that without this
amendment, Stanford is paralyzed in
dealing with matters that occur away
from campus.
"Someone who commits assault
on University Avenue would not be
in our jurisdiction," Callan said. "If it
happened on Palm Drive, however,it
would be."
He stressed, however, that the
amendment was created to address
major off-campus offenses, not
minor infractions.
"If you get drunk and trash your
bedroom on campus, you're in trou
ble," Callan continued. "But, if you
get drunk and trash your bedroom in
New Jersey." the incident is unlikely
to reach the Board.
Graduate Life Office Assistant
Dean Laurette Beeson. a former ju
dicial advisor in the Office of Judicial
Affairs, added that the amendment
is in line with the Fundamental Stan
dard. which has been the guiding
principle of conduct at Stanford
since 18%.
"The Fundamental Standard de
scribes expectations for students' be
havior 'within and without the Uni
versity,"' Beeson wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Yet, the previous juris
diction only governed misconduct
that occurred on campus or in associ
ation with a Stanford event off-cam
pus."
Some faculty were concerned by
the amendment's vague language
when it was presented at last week's
Faculty Senate meeting for approval.
Beeson recognized these con
cerns but defended the statement.
"While I understand the impor
tance of spelling out expectations."
she said. "I have also come to appre
ciate the value of the expansive lan
guage of the Fundamental Standard
and to a lesser extent the Honor

Code.There is in fact a danger in try
ing to be too specific because it does
not leave room for the unanticipated
behaviors and/or changes in social
norms and things like technology."
At last week's Faculty Senate
meeting. History Prof. Albert Ca
marillo supported the amendment
and said that he trusted the judg
ment of the Judicial Panel members.
"I'm not so troubled by the lan
guage knowing that the process of
review is very [strong]." he said.
A second proposal to the Board
would further expand the statute of
limitations for certain violent crimes.
The current Charter states that
charges must be filed within six
months after alleged misconduct oc
curred or was reasonably discov
ered. The amended Charter would
read: "In cases involving alleged sex
ual assault, dating/domestic vio
lence. sexual harassment, stalking, a
hate crime, or physical assault ... a
charge [must be] filed no more than
two years after the alleged miscon
duct occurred. If compelling new ev
idence becomes available after these
stated times, a case may be charged
since a Panel maintains the ultimate
authority to dismiss or allow a case."
Beeson stressed that though she
would encourage a student to come
forward as soon as possible, it is
often difficult for a victim to deal
with trauma within a six-month time
frame.
"The subcommittee's goal was to
reduce barriers to reporting," she
said. "[We] believed it was critical to
give a survivor additional time to
both recover from the trauma and to
carefully consider their options with
out losing the ability to file a com
plaint with Judicial Affairs."

The addition to the Charter is
closer to the standard of California's
statute of limitations. State law re
quires that charges must he filed
within six years for non-aggravated
rape. There is no statute of limita
tions on aggravated rape.
"My interpretation is that we've
given victims a second option." said
Faculty Senator Gilbert Chu. profes
sor of medicine and biochemistry.
"Rather than just having a choice of
pressing criminal charges, they can
go through the [campus judicial]
process."
Ilie amendment was influenced
by the input of the Sexual Violence
Advisory Board. The Advisory
Board, which Beeson co-chairs,
formed a joint subcommittee with
the Board on Judicial Affairs to for
mulate the recommendations.
The amendments are part of a
broader initiative to cut down on vi
olent crime led by the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs, the Sexual Vio
lence Advisory Board and the Stan
ford Partnership to End Violence
Against Women, which received a
grant from the Department of Jus
tice.
The ASSU and Graduate Student
Council both unanimously passed
the two amendments last spring
when they were first introduced.
They finally reached the floor of the
Faculty Senate last week, where both
passed despite contention over the
vagueness of the first amendment.
ITie amendments have been for
warded to the office of President
John Hennessy, where they must re
ceive final approval.
