## Zipcar service coming to Farm Rental agency to begin providing cars within month for $35 annual fee 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Zipcar, the car-sharing agency that covers approxi
mately 70 universities nationwide, will begin service at
Stanford within the next month, according to Adam Bro
phy, company director of operations for university mar
kets.
"We are going to start with a few cars in the very near
future," Brophy said. "It's sort of a soft launch, with a
major launch after students return from their holiday
breaks."
The company, which was formed in 1999 after its
founders were inspired by a car-sharing service in Berlin,
currently serves tens of thousands of clients nationwide. In
2003, the company began expanding to college campuses.
"We know from experience that this [service] does
work on university campuses," Brophy said.
The process of reserving a Zipcar is fairly simple. Stu
dents register with the service online, after which they be
come "Zipsters.' They can then reserve a Zipcar online or
by phone whenever a car is available on campus. A Zipster
need only wave his or her "Zipcard" to the car's wind
shield during the reservation time in order to unlock the
vehicle.
According to Angus Davol, transportation demand
management coordinator for the University, specific de
tails regarding car selection and locations have not yet
been determined.
"We don't know many details yet," Davol said. "I know
that [Stanford] tried car sharing a couple of year ago. Re
cently we put out a request for proposals, and a number of
companies put out bids. Zipcar was
the winner."
According to Brophy, Stanford
Zipsters will pay a $35 annual fee,
plus an hourly driving rate starting
at $8, depending on the Zipcar used.
Fuel and basic insurance are includ
ed in the cost. Zipsters must have a
valid driver's license that is at least a
year old and consent to a driving
record check, which cannot include
any serious violations.
Universities register with the
program for free, but must provide
parking spots and basic mainte
nance such as oil changes and clean
ing. 'Hie company also provides 24-
hour roadside assistance.
Zipcar touts the environmental

advantages associated with car shar
ing.
"Car sharing as a concept is a very
environmentally-friendly alterna
tive." Brophy said. "Each one of our
cars takes approximately 20 cars off
the road, so that helps reduce total
mileage and the effects of green
house gases."
Zipcars on other college campus
es include Honda Civics, Volkswa
gen Jettas and fleets of hybrid and
electric cars. I lowever, both Brophy
and Davol said details were unclear
regarding the car types that will be
available at Stanford.
Student reactions to car sharing
were varied.
"As a freshman the only time I
ever felt concerned with not having a
car was going on shopping runs," said
Barry Burns '09. "My entire social
life was located on campus. I think
something that would be more use
ful would be making the Shopping

Express more accessible or some
thing of that nature."
Vasant Ramachandran '11 was
open to the concept of car sharing.
"1 would definitely consider using
[Zipcar], primarily because it's
somewhat difficult to get off campus
without a car." he said."lt's impracti
cal to have a car freshman year, and
you basically need a car to get any
where out of the bubble."
"1 think it's a great way to get
around if you ever need to go to Palo
Alto or Redwood City," agreed Nick
Murray 4 11. "It would be a great way
to get around without riding your
bike."
Murray did have one concern,
though.
"1 would just be worried about
safety. 1 hope students don't drive
those cars drunk."
