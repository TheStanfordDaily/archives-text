# TAKING ON TEAM USA
## No. 5 Stanford to face world's best tonight 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For one night only, Stanford is going
pro.
The No. 5 Cardinal will face off against
the USA Basketball Senior Women's Na
tional Team in an exhibition game tonight.
Maples Pavilion is the last stop on an
eight-game college tour for USA Basket
ball. The team, comprised entirely of
WNBA players, is undefeated on their trip.
Iliey've beaten five top-25 teams, includ
ing the top three teams in the country: No.
1 Tennessee, No. 2 Connecticut and No. 3
Maryland.
For one of the few times this year. Stan
ford will be the underdog, facing perhaps
the best professional women's squad in the
world.
Team USA is anchored by center Lisa
Leslie, arguably the best female basketball
player, ever. She is a three-time Olympic
gold medalist and has led Team USA
throughout its eight-game tour against the
best collegiate teams in the country. A USC
alumna, she has been the MVP of the
WNBA three times.
However, Leslie missed the entire 2007
WNBA season due to pregnancy, and her
participation in the college tour was in
doubt until just a few days before its start.
With the 2(X)8 Beijing Olympics quickly
approaching. Leslie needed a way to shake
off the dust that comes with a long absence
from the game; this college trip has provid-

Ed that.
"I am excited to get hack on the court."
Leslie told USABasketball.com. "I feel I
have a long way to go to get ready for the
Olympics but this will give me a chance to
get moving in that direction."
Leslie is joined in the starting lineup by
former Connecticut star Diana Taurasi. In

GAME NOTES Team USA features some of the best
women basketball players in the world: Lisa Leslie,
Diana Taunasi and Sue Bird are the starting lineup's
biggest names The USA Basketball team is currently
on a collegiate tour of sorts, playing eight of the best
schools from around the country; the team has yet to
lose and has won most games in dominating fashion
The game is an exhibition, leaving the Cardinal's 2 0
record unscathed regardless of the outcome

Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen has been a big part of the Cardinal's early
season success. Pedersen and the rest of her teammates will need a spirited
effort when they take the court tonight against the USA Basketball team.
her first four WNBA seasons,Taurasi
has already established herself as one
of the premier guards in the league.
An elite scorer. Taurasi had a game
high 28 points against top-ranked Ten
nessee on Nov. 4.
Rounding out the USA Basketball
starting lineup are guard Sue Bird —
Taurasi's teammate at Connecticut —
and forwards Taj McWilliams-
I ranklin, an excellent defender and
shot blocker, and Seimone Augustus,
another efficient scorer.
Jamie Carey, a former Cardinal, is a
reserve for Team USA. Carey was the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 1999,
but injuries derailed her career shortly
after. She sat out two seasons, before
transferring to Texas, where she re
vived her career.
While injured, Carey became a fan
favorite for her constant support of
her teammates. Carey told USABas
ketball.com. "It's always fun to go to
Stanford. It's where my heart first was
and I'll always feel like I'm a part of
the Cardinal family."
Stanford will certainly have its
hands full with Carey and her team
mates. But while the USA Basketball
lineup is daunting, it is not invincible
— the team needed a comeback to
beat unranked USC, and the Trojans
aren't nearly as talented as the Cardi
nal.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins, a
preseason All-American and member
el the 2007-2008 USA Basketball Na
tional Team, will lead Stanford. She —
along with sophomore forward Jayne

Appel and freshman forward Kayla
Pedersen — was Instrumental in the
Cardinal's 60-58 victory over then-No.
3 Rutgers on Sunday. The Cardinal
star contributed 19 points, including
two game-sealing free throws with
under a second left.
Both Pedersen and Appel had
double-doubles against the Scarlet
Knights: in just her third college game,
Pedersen posted 15 points and 16 re
bounds, and Appel went for 18 and 13.
Ibese impressive statistics are in
part a result of Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer's insistence on free throw
shooting and rebounding in practice.
Oddly enough, the first time Stanford
and USA Basketball met, in 1995,
VanDerveer was on leave from the
Cardinal while coaching Team USA.
In order to keep pace with USA
Basketball, the Cardinal will have to
control the boards and score at an
above-average rate, in addition to
playing tough defense. Pedersen and
Appel will be tasked with covering
Leslie, a daunting prospect for the
freshman, who has yet to make de
fense one of her strong suits.The soph
omore forward will be severely tested
by Leslie's athleticism and skill.
But Stanford has a good base to
work off of: they held a talented Rut
gers team to 28.6 percent shooting in
the second half on Sunday, and. last
Friday, held Yale scoreless for the first
four minutes of their game.
