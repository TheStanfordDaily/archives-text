# TAKING ON TEAM USA
## No. 5 Stanford to face world's best tonight 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For one night only, Stanford is going
pro.
The No. 5 Cardinal will face off against
the USA Basketball Senior Women's Na
tional Team in an exhibition game tonight.
Maples Pavilion is the last stop on an
eight-game college tour for USA Basket
ball. The team, comprised entirely of
WNBA players, is undefeated on their trip.
Iliey've beaten five top-25 teams, includ
ing the top three teams in the country: No.
1 Tennessee, No. 2 Connecticut and No. 3
Maryland.
For one of the few times this year. Stan
ford will be the underdog, facing perhaps
the best professional women's squad in the
world.
Team USA is anchored by center Lisa
Leslie, arguably the best female basketball
player, ever. She is a three-time Olympic
gold medalist and has led Team USA
throughout its eight-game tour against the
best collegiate teams in the country. A USC
alumna, she has been the MVP of the
WNBA three times.
However, Leslie missed the entire 2007
WNBA season due to pregnancy, and her
participation in the college tour was in
doubt until just a few days before its start.
With the 2(X)8 Beijing Olympics quickly
approaching. Leslie needed a way to shake
off the dust that comes with a long absence
from the game; this college trip has provid-

Ed that.
"I am excited to get hack on the court."
Leslie told USABasketball.com. "I feel I
have a long way to go to get ready for the
Olympics but this will give me a chance to
get moving in that direction."
Leslie is joined in the starting lineup by
former Connecticut star Diana Taurasi. In

season success. Pedersen and the rest of her teammates will need a spirited
effort when they take the court tonight against the USA Basketball team.
