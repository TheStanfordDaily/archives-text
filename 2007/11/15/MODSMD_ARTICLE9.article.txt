November 14,1980: Graduat
ing seniors give low grades to
teaching
An overwhelming majority of
1980 graduating senior gave a high
rating to the quality of their under
graduate education at Stanford, ac
cording to an annual survey dis
cussed at yesterday's faculty Senate
meeting. The report revealed
strengths in training students for
graduate and professional schools
but had somewhat less favorable sta
tistics for the quality of teaching and
academic advising here.
The survey is an annual attempt
by the office of the vice provost and
dean of undergraduate studies to ob
tain a perspective on Stanford educa
tion through the responses of each
year's graduating seniors. This year,
709 seniors, 43 percent of the gradu
ating class. participated in the survey.
Seniors assess program
The four-part questionnaire first
dealt with senior assessment of the
undergraduate program, including
their experience with Stanford facul
ty and staff.
In this portion of the survey, 92
percent called their overall educa
tion "good" or "excellent" while 65
percent rated their liberal arts educa

tion equally high. Sixty-seven per
cent of the seniors felt their training
for graduate or professional school
was good to excellent, while an al
most equal percentage remarked fa
vorably on the quality of courses
within their favor.
While almost all seniors were im
pressed by the faculty as scholars and
researchers, only 56 percent rated
them highly as teachers, a role which
the respondents saw as very impor
tant. Academic advisers fared worse
as only one quarter of the seniors
were pleased with their advisor dur
ing their undeclared years. Advisors
for majors received a somewhat
higher, but still low, rating.
Computers not viewed as important
Another part of the survey asked
seniors to evaluate their abilities in a
wide range of educational fields. The
majority gave moderate to high as
sessments of their individual capabil
ities.
Eighty-one percent of the respon
dents felt they had a good or excel
lent ability to write clear English
prose, a skill the seniors rated as most
valuable.
At the other end. an understand
ing of non-western cultures and the
use of computers were topics in
which most seniors felt least educat
ed. But they also saw knowledge of
these topics as least important.
