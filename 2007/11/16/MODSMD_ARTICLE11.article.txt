November 16,1978:
Rules on rivalry set
As the Big Game draws near, rep
resentatives from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley are searching for ways to
maintain some decorum in the tradi
tional rivalry. In a meeting at Berke
ley this week, representatives estab
lished some ground rules for the
hands, the rooters and most impor
tant, the handling of the Axe.
ITie item discussed most thor
oughly was the Axe. A symbol of the
Berkeley-Stanford rivalry since
18W. the Axe now belongs to Stan
ford. winner by a 21-3 margin in last
year's Big Game. During this week
end's game, it will be chained to Stan
ford yell leaders to avoid the possi
bility of it being stolen, according to
Doug Greenfield, a yell leader here.
Greenfield said he wants to ex
change the Axe in a "civilized way"
â€” if only to save the life of the yell
leader attached to it at the game's
end. At the conclusion of last year's
game, the Stanford team tri
umphantly carried the chained yell
leaders around with the Axe.
