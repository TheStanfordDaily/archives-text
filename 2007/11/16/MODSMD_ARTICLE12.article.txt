# Saving seabirds with dish soap, water
## 
### KT MERTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last week's spill poured nearly
60,000 gallons of oil into the San Francis
co Bay, emergency response teams
called for "qualified" volunteers to assist
in coastal cleanup efforts. However,
many volunteers hoping to participate in
wildlife cleanup programs were instead
stationed at gift shops and information
hotlines, freeing trained staff for the
tricky and intensive business of de-oil
ing.
Not just anyone, it seems, is qualified
to scrub a seabird with Dawn.
Northern California's primary
agency for oil-related wildlife rescue is
the Oiled Wildlife Care Network
(OWCN), based at the University of
California at Davis. The OWCN has so
phisticated response mechanisms for
oil spills and even owns a custom-made
mobile response unit for cleaning and
transporting sensitive wildlife.

While all marine animals are af-

fected by an oil spill, it is incred-

ibly difficult to catch and

clean every one. Some
marine mammals.

such as the sea
otter, are actual- .
ly more likely to

suffer negative effects from
human handling than from the oil
itself.

Post-spill rescue operations

tend to focus on the species most im
pacted by oil contact and most likely to
survive treatment.
In northern California, this means
seabirds. Even a small amount of oil can
be a major problem because it causes
matted feathers, loss of insulation and,
eventually, hypothermia. Even worse, a
seabird will try to clean itself by preen
ing, but will only succeed in ingesting oil
and becoming dehydrated.
So how do you save ocean birds
splashed with the sticky stuff? First, you
have to catch them. It takes at least two
able-bodied OWCN staff, equipped with
nets and a large supply of patience, to
capture one oiled bird.
The next step is to make sure the bird
is healthy enough to endure the clean
ing process. After a thorough physical

examination, each bird is fed a

"rescue cocktail" of water,
high-nutrient fluids (Pedi-

alyte is commonly used), laxatives
to encourage oil excretion and a
stomach soother such as Pepto-
Bismol. It can take hours before a
i veterinarian determines that a
I seabird is stable enough to be
cleaned.

Wildlife cleaning facilities con-

sist of rooms filled with endless rows

of plastic tubs. Each is filled with a solu
tion of water heated to bird body tem
perature and Dawn — nothing is more

effective at getting the grease out than
dishwashing soap.
Trained staff members or volunteers
wash oiled birds in successive tubs, mov
ing the animal each time the water be
comes dark and oily. Cleaning just one
bird can take hundreds of gallons of
water and several hours.
At the end of the wash cycle, birds are
thoroughly dried with the same kind of
air-blowers used in pet grooming salons.
Because the cleaning process re
moves not only petroleum but also natu
ral oils that help seabirds float, every res
cued bird is held for up to 10 days.
Spending this much time on dry land al
lows birds to gain weight and fully recov
er important feather qualities like buoy
ancy, waterproofing and insulation.
Birds are often banded prior to re
lease, which has helped researchers to
evaluate the effectiveness of post-spill
cleaning techniques.
Waterfowl-like ducks and Canada
geese respond well to de-oiling —
cleaned birds have similar annual sur
vival rates to birds that have never been
oiled. Other studies have found that pel
icans and some common seabirds have
much lower survival rates after cleaning
and release.
So far, bird survival appears to de
pend as much on the bird as on its treat
ment. Luckily, this news hasn't discour
aged the nearly 3(X) OWCN staff and
