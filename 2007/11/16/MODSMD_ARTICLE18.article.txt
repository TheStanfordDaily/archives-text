## Foster care worker describes system's troubles Norwood calls for greater state support, programs 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
In honor of National Hunger and
I lomelessncss Awareness Week. Amanda
Norwood, housing advocate for Youth and
Family Enrichment Services (YFES),
spoke last night to a group of about 20
Stanford students on the problems of
housing foster youth before and after
emancipation.
Students Taking on Poverty (STOP)
hosted the event, titled "After Foster Care:
A Look Into the Lives of I lomeless Youth
in San Mateo County."
"We try to put on events and programs
and campus awareness campaigns that in
crease knowledge about a whole variety of
issues that relate to poverty in the U.S.,"said
STOP co-president Debbie Warshawsky
"OS. adding that foster care "is so often over
looked and neglected as a social issue."
Supported by a two-year funding grant
from the state. YFES provides housing ad

vocacy services for any youth previously or
currently in San Mateo's foster care sys
tem.
"Housing is extremely expensive in the
Bay Area and most of these kids work at
minimum wage jobs," Norwood said. "It's
nearly impossible for them to do it on their
own."
She added that the consequences of
homelessness for foster youth are far
reaching and perpetual.
"Not having affordable housing can
mess up other aspects of their lives like
school and work," she said. "Essentially,
they are living in a state of continual
chaos."
For those who are ready to live on their
own. Norwood said she assisted clients all
throughout the housing process.
"1 explain what leases are, how to pre
pare for meetings with their landlords and
basic advocacy," she said. "Lots of land
lords don't want to rent to 18-year-olds and
prefer the 40-year-old with a good credit
history. They aren't supposed to discrimi
nate. but they do. and 1 make sure that my
clients' voices are heard."
She said, however, that most of the
youth are not ready for the responsibilities

that go along with taking care of them
selves.
"We want them to make the most inde
pendent decision, but a lot of these young
adults coming out of the system aren't as
equipped as they think they are to live in
dependently," Norwood said. "We show
them what other options they have."
Many of the better options are transi
tional programs, which house foster youth
in groups of 10. She said, however, that the
turnover rate can be problematic and liv
ing conditions are usually crowded.
Among other issues, Norwood men
tioned that many of the youth do not have
adequate knowledge about finances and
contracts that are required to live on one's
own.
"Independent living is so much." she
said."lt's not just about getting a paycheck
or frying an egg. There are so many more
skills that these youth need, but do not
have."
She said that there needs to be more ac
countability within the state to create pro
grams that teach the youngsters about nec
essary life skills.
"You can say'teach kids budgeting.' but
what does that really mean? And how is it

implemented?" Norwood asked. "There
need to he state mandates that tell us how
to better handle these issues."
Alyssa Battistoni 'OS. STOP co-presi
dent, said she was happy with the student
turnout.
"I thought it was really informative
about an issue that is overlooked to a large
extent." Battistoni said. "The statistics
Amanda mentioned are just stunning, and
I am glad Stanford students want to be in
formed about this."
The week's events conclude today
when a group of STOP members will trav
el to the Opportunity Center, a compre
hensive homeless shelter that provides
services such as transitional housing and
medical care in Palo Alto. Students will
provide two computer-training sessions to
help the foster youth create email address
es and find tools to search for jobs online.
"Everything we do," Warshawsky said,
"is to try to increase access to information
for low-income communities that enable
them to fight for an improvement in their
quality of life."
