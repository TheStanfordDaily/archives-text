## Editorial Board Imagining a longer Thanksgiving... 
### 
The week-long Thanksgiving is gener
ally beloved amongst Stanford stu
dents, especially those (Class of '08
and older) who remember the days before
its institution. It justifies airfare for students
from far away heading home and provides a
more restful break before the end of the
quarter. These few days off are much more
meaningful when appended to the begin
ning of Thanksgiving than they were at the
end of the summer.
Some schools on the quarter system take
the logic of the last clause even further —
instead of having a few weeks between
Thanksgiving break and Christmas break,
the term begins a few weeks earlier in Sep
tember and ends completely before
Thanksgiving. Imagine (please) if Stanford
operated on this schedule. As unpleasant as
the thought of addition may be on the Fri
day before a week-long vacation, do the
math: 1 week of Thanksgiving + 3 weeks be
tween Turkey Day and Christmas Break + 3
weeks of Winter Break = 7 weeks straight of
vacation. At that length, winter would prac
tically be summer.
The University has reasons not to adopt
such a schedule — valid reasons related to
aspects of campus life such as summer term
classes. Sophomore College, residence
arrangements, overseas seminars and more.
Most of the schools that currently use the
system are small liberal arts schools rather
than large research universities.
The scheduling problems, however, need
not be insurmountable. Most internships
conclude at the end of August, if not earlier.

including on-campus summer programs
like Summer Research College. Overseas
seminars and Sophomore College could
happen at the beginning of Winter Break in
stead of the minimal space between Sum
mer and Autumn Ouarters.
Such a long break may not even be what
the student body wants. The upside of being
able to get a job over the holidays is tem
pered by the possibility of getting a job over
the holidays. Seven weeks is a long time to
head home, whether you are fresh out of the
fights of high school or an elderly senior too
big for that much time with parents. None of
your high-school friends will be around
then to break the monotony, either.
Of course, the awkward three-week peri
od when even,' other student has headed
back to school already would just be shifted
from September to early December. Plus,
after years of having class on Veterans Day
and Columbus Day. just because our univer
sity is committed to teaching us rather than
giving us every miscellaneous day off. imag
ine your satisfaction as you tell your once
smug friends from less education-oriented
institutions that you have seven solid weeks
off in the winter.
Rearranging the fall quarter schedule to
allow a continuous break from Thanksgiv
ing through New Year's may not make sense
for the University or even for its students.
Despite all of the sensible reasons against it.
many students still may be wishing deep
down that this was the last day of finals in
stead of the last deep breath before the aca
demic mavhem beeins.
