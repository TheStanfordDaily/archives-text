## Team USA crushes Cardinal No. 5 women no match for notional team, fall 97-62 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's basketball team
might be one of the best college squads in the
country, but the U.S. national team played on an
entirely different level last night, thrashing Stan
ford 97-62 in an exhibition game at Maples Pavil
ion.
Guard Sue Bird scored l l ) points for the na
tional team to lead all scorers. Stanford's leading
scorer was freshman forward Kayla Pedersen.
who went 4-for-9 for 11 points. Pedersen also
grabbed nine boards to lead the Cardinal in that
category. Junior forward Jillian Harmon and
sophomore center Jayne Appel followed up with
10 points each.
The Cardinal (2-0) never led against Team
USA, which compiled a perfect 8-0 record dur
ing its college tour, beating the likes of No. 1 Ten
nessee and No. 2 Connecticut along with Stan
ford. The win over Stanford was the USA's
biggest margin of victory on the tour.
"1 guess we were doing our civic duty." Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer deadpanned after
the game.
Stanford fought hard in the first period, but
Team USA put the game on ice early in the sec
ond half, running all over a tired-looking Cardi
nal squad and stretching its lead to3o points with
12 minutes left before cruising through the rest
of the game. Stanford committed five turnovers
in the first four minutes of the second half, allow
ing the national team to quickly build its advan
tage.
VanDerveer acknowledged that her team
could not keep up with the high speed of the
game.
"They shot extremely well, and they play at a
pace that our team is not used to," the veteran
coach said.
Team USA led 45-30 at halftime behind 13
points each from its pair of ex-UConn guards.
Bird and Diana Taurasi. Stanford fell behind
early and trailed by 11 with nine minutes left in
the first half as Team USA came out shooting
53.7 percent from the field.
The Cardinal made a spirited
comeback attempt, though, scoring
eight points in a row — four of them
from Harmon — to narrow the
score to 25-22 with six and a half
minutes before the interval.
I he USA women continued to
make open shots, however, and the
lofty margin was soon restored
thanks to six points from Taurasi.
four from former LSU star Seimone
Augustus and a pair of three-point
ers from Bird before halftime.
I he game was also a homecoming
lor ex-Stanford guard Jamie Carey,
who spent three injury-riddled years
at Stanford in the early portion of
this decade before transferring and
finishing her college career at Texas.
Despite the lopsided loss, Van-
Derveer was sure that the experi
ence would improve Stanford all
over the court and especially on the
inside.
"No matter who [the posts] play
against now, they should be confi
dent." Van 1 )erveer said.
Stanford will get an immediate
chance to test that theory with its
busy lhanksgiving week schedule.
I"he ( aidinal will first head to Utah
before jetting off to the U.S. Virgin
Islands next week to take part in the
Paradise Jam tournament.
Stanford will play Connecticut
and Old Dominion in the prelimi
nary round of the tournament. Con
necticut is the second top-three op
ponent that the Cardinal will meet in
November. Stanford beat then-No. 3
Rutgers last weekend.
The Huskies (2-0) have been led
by highly-touted freshman Maya
Moore thus far. Moore has scored 2h
points per game in blowout wins
over Stonybrook and 1 loly Cross.
Last year's quartet of double-digit
scorers Renee Montgomery, Tina
Charles, Charde Houston and
Kalana Greene — are all back for
the loaded 1 luskies.
Old Dominion (2-0) has also won
its first games of the season behind
sophomore forward Jessica Canady
and the early leading scorer and jun
ior Shahida Williams, who leads the
team in rebounding. The Monarchs
are outside the national rankings but
received votes in the latest Associat
ed Press poll.
No. 10 Duke headlines the other
half of the Paradise Jam bracket. De
pending on its finish in the round
robin stage, the Cardinal will play ei
ther the Blue Devils, Purdue,or Tem
ple in the third and final game of the
tournament.

over the court and especially on the
