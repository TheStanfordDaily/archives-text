# Burning Down the House
## The
						unbearable priced-ness of being 
### 
I don't object to Don Rumsfeld coming
here because he would damage the Stan
ford brand. I don't even think he would.
But I think the outcry and the indignation is
all just a cop-out, an easy dodge that fakes
moral outrage while hiding behind pragma
tism. It reveals something troubling about
the way we see ourselves as students and as
people. It says. "We are products of this cor
poration called Stanford, and we are for sale.
We would like the price to be high."
Good thing the ASSU bill condemning
Rumsfeld as a brand-ruiner just failed. Its
implication was that we didn't want the for
mer Secretary because he's just too unpopu
lar for us to hang out with. It's not cool to be
Rumsfeld these days.
Remember freshman orientation, when
we introduced ourselves by endorsing cer
tain products? We talked about our favorite
music: we put movie and band posters on
our walls, lliis is the stuff of getting to know
each other. Who is cool? I low to sort?
Marshall McLuhan, maybe the best
known media scholar of the 20th century, fa
mously declared, "The medium is the mes
sage." I le meant that when we transfer infor
mation back and forth, the act and method of
transferring it can be far more important
than the content itself. "The content of a
medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried
by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the
mind." The "how" matters more than the
"what." It's not notable that I endorse Bob
Dylan where you endorse Regina Spektor,
that 1 wear American Apparel or that you
wear Abercrombie. Rather, what's interest
ing is how both our lives are so thoroughly
permeated by the act of endorsement.
That branding governs identity is no new
insight. But commodification's advance into
the deepest corners of the way we think,
identify and operate as human beings is as
pernicious as it is relentless. As a Marxist
might say, it is no accident that the prime lo
cation of presented identity for us — the
Facebook profile — is essentially a laundry
list of the things that we spend money on:
books, movies, music, booze. Even the other
sections are often just venues for us to send
cultural signals; that line from"The Big
Lebowski" speaks loud and clear.
It's called conspicuous consumption.
There's a book about it, appropriately titled
"Conspicuous Consumption," by Thorstein
Veblen.The idea is that the character of our
consumption is used to let others know pre
cisely where we stand in society. Vcblen was
mainly interested in the habits of the
wealthy, but the theory applies just as well to
college students sending up flares with their
Facebook profiles.
Facebook hasn't been particularly guilti
er than any of the other countless, faceless
culprits in implementing the commodifica

tion of fucking everything. But Mark
Zuckerberg has definitely noticed, and he's
trying to cash in. Facebook wants to take
those products we've chosen as the pillars of
our online personalities and put them into
our friends' news feeds: "Gabe likes Bob
Dylan. Click here to buy the latest album.
'Modern Times.'" And there I'd be,grinning,
bearded and goofy, next to the "Buy now!"
link. Or something to that effect. Committed
to privacy, of course, they plan to let users
disable this function, which is worth some
thing.
What I mainly resent, though, is the idea,
even if I get to opt out. It acknowledges how
blurry the line is between personality and
taste and looks to exploit it. Facebook is set
ting out to turn social networks into niche
markets, to make the ineffable bonds of
friendship and affection legible to corporate
peddlers and glib hawkers of marketing
snake-oil. I'm looking at you. Malcolm
Gladwell.
To quote Margaret Thatcher, "No. No.
No." Death to the salesman. Enough of this
implacably rational madness. It's time to
defy the ever-grasping tentacles of brand.
No more posters for bands and movies on
the walls. I vaguely remember a version of
myself identifiable by more than the various
things of which 1 am a money-spending fan.
I don't give a damn about having a brand
name famous commencement speaker.
Let's have someone who actually has some
thing to say instead. And I don't oppose the
Don Rumsfeld appointment because he's
bad for Stanford's brand and reputation, but
because the man iscomplicit in unspeakable
crimes.
I'm all for music and books and movies,
and I'm all for spending money on them. I
think they're great. But when we pay too
much attention to what we buy and sell, we
start to lose track of the line between the
products we like and the people we are. We
become packaged. When we can't or won't
tell the moral difference between "bad for
our reputation" and "war criminal in our
home," there's a problem. At least we know
the name of the illness being diagnosed: It's
called selling out.

Gabe isn t into bunting books, but if you
wrote to him at gwinant@stanford.edu and
made him pick one, he might go with "The
lipping Point."
