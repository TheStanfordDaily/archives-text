## The 						word of Generation Y: awkward 
### 
Her presentation was awkward. His run
in with the ex at the post office was so
awkward. When she didn't say "hi"
back: more awkward
It seems that every interaction, or at least
the one worth retelling to friends, is awkward.
It has become the word of our generation, the
word to describe any and all less-than-perfect
situations.
Friends actually fill blank moments in con
versations with, "awwkkkkwaaaard," or just
say, half-jokingly, half-seriously, "so, this is
awkward." There is the awkward turtle hand
motion and the extra awkward turtle — it's
stranded upside down on its shell. There is an
awkward cow. an awkward monkey, an awk
ward moose. I've seen the American sign lan
guage sign for awkward added into conversa
tions-both thumbs, index and ring fingers are
held out-stretched as hands bob up and down
opposite one another. It is. well, a rather won
derfully awkward sign for awkward.
Apparently, here at Stanford, we do things
awkwardly, there are large amounts of awk
wardness and, generally, most things are awk
wardish (all real words, 112 your i.)
So what is our obsession with acknowledg
ing all things ungainly and inelegant? Why do
we preface stories with just how incredibly,
painfully uncomfortable they are? Why do
we relish those whoppers of awkward mo
ments?
I think a large part of it is as vulnerable and
generally wide-eyed late-teen, early-twenty
somethings, we are all terrified of being
judged — of not being interesting enough,
mature enough, pretty enough or smart
enough. When we are then in situations where
judgment is being passed, either on ourselves

or onto others, we internally cringe at how
these assessments affect the situation. We are
hyper-aware of the implications and the
power of tone and body language. As shifts
and changes in status come to bear, we lump
all of these lesser comfortable interactions
into one awkward pile.
Take the awkwardest of all conversations,
the impromptu run-in with your ex. It's all
about judgment and power balance. Does he
still like me? Was she overly friendly? Was he
flirting? Does she already have another
boyfriend? Is he over it? Am I over it? And ..
. has he been working out?
Ex-meetings are strange for many reasons
— it makes you think about why it ended
badly, why it started, how goddamn cute they
are. But I think a large part of its strangeness is
because both parties are passing blatant judg
ment. And they both know it.There is nothing
that makes you more self-conscious than
knowing that a once-intimate-someone will
soon pass a verdict on your circumstances di
rectly after your meeting.
Even in less intensely awkward interac
tions — the long pause in a conversation
when eyes hit the floor and hands become fas
cinating or when a so-so joke is met with si
lence — mini-judgments are being made by
the minute. You're a bad conversationalist.

you really aren't that funny. The judgment is
made, the power shifts, the turtle swims.
1 think that is why we preface stories of in
teractions so frequently with warnings of awk
wardness — it is a disclaimer against our own
social clumsiness. Our awareness of the awk
wardness is the mighty shield we put up
against it. We might be getting reviewed and
assessed by our peers, but. god help us, we
know it.
I am not sure we ever become less sensi
tized to relationship dynamics as we grow
older — as it is I'm clinging to all the dynam
ics I understand — but 1 think we become less
agonizingly self-conscious of what others are
thinking about us. (Or, at least, so I hope.)
Who cares if someone thinks your pun was
stupid? You weren't auditioning for SNL,you
were saying whatever stupid shiznit came to
the top of your head. And, goddamit, you
thought it was kind of clever.
I guess getting-older-me can and should
embrace that confident perspective now. So
what if a friend's left hand starts to move over
his right and his thumbs start to rotate
around? So what if his turtle starts swimming
in my awkward waters? As long as my words
and my actions pass my own judgment,
swarms of hand-animals shouldn't matter.
After all. I'm the judge who really matters.
So here's to meeting the person you
weren't dying to meet, to having the conversa
tion you'd rather have avoided. I'll be telling
(bad) jokes until the (awkward) cows come
home.

If you think facing Katie in person is too awk
ward, why not email her at kttaylor@
