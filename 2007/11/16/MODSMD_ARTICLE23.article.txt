Students slam Singer
To the Editor:
Yesterday's article. "Speaker slams global
warming," brought attention to Fred Singer,
a global warming skeptic invited this week to
speak both by the Stanford Review and Stan
ford in Government. Singer's claim that car
bon dioxide is not correlated with tempera
ture is one of many that flies in the face of
current published scientific research. litis in
cludes findings by the US. National Acade
my of Sciences and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),comprised
of thousands of research scientists, supported
by a l(X)-country consensus and awarded the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize.
Singer also uses visceral personal attacks
("they don't have their heads on right") and
does not cite any specific peer-reviewed scien
tific publications to support his radical claims
— a basic violation of the scientific process. His
negativism in bashing student activism and in
suggesting that energy efficiency here will not
affect Chinese energy policy ignores realities
in social and economic systems. These all call
into question the academic value of hosting
him on our campus, especially without offering
a climate scientist's rebuttal. Additionally,
inviting Singer to speak at Stanford on this
topic lends him undeserved credibility.
Though naysayers will always exist, global
climate change is particularly dangerous to
dismiss with highly questionable reasoning
and suspect sources. Biology Prof. Stephen
Schneider often makes the analogy that peo
ple normally buy insurance to avert relative
ly miniscule risks, while the potential risk for
severe impacts from global climate change is
known to be much greater. It logically fol
lows that we should insure the sustainability
of our planet, where stakes are much higher
for all of humanity. Delaying the develop
ment and implementation of sustainable in
novations is actually the greater danger to
"liberty." "freedom" and our future.
Clearly a letter to the editor does not pro
vide ample opportunity to thoroughly ad
dress every inaccuracy .Singer proliferates. If
Stanford wishes to host scientifically dissent
ing views in the future, speakers' integrity
should be strictly scrutinized before lending
them Stanford's own credibility.

A Grad Student's View
To the Editor:
It's my third year here and I am still won
dering how I became part of a social under
class, a body of people not considered as either
interesting, sociable or capable of human
emotion by over 3,(XX) undergraduates. I, too,
attended Rains Speed Dating in the hopes of
obtaining a few dates, and, at worst, a few sto
ries to tell my friends. On the whole I was sat
isfied— until I read Marissa Miller's Nov. 14
article ["How to date a grad student in three
minutes"]. My umbrage doesn't come from
being rejected (Marissa was actually a 'no' on
my list), but from her thinly veiled scorn for
graduate students. Her article is nothing but a
backhanded compliment.
Marissa does say a few good things about
us — some of us are "cuties," or even "gor
geous." Apparently we're also "smart, funny
and endearingly sweet." No shit, Sherlock,
we're people, too. However, we are told she
was quite sure "the man of [her] dreams isn't
going to be a grad student." Apparently,
Marissa was surprised that 1) some of us re
jected her and 2) it hurt. It must be surprising
to an attractive woman to be rejected by a few
people she apparently views as desperate. I'm
sorry if that's a little harsh, but time and again
I have seen articles in The Daily about the
sketchiness and social awkwardness of gradu
ate students. Even articles, like Marissa's, that
say, "They're not so bad," are laced with dis
dain. I don't know why we're written off.
If I had written Marissa down as a 'yes',
she'd not have a single date from me. She ac
cepted everyone except the "oldest ones."
Was she interested in the article, her own ego,
or me? She lied to get in to speed dating and
proceeded to misrepresent herself to 20 men.
And now the story appears in a public forum.
I give her kudos for a nice bit of investigative
journalism. But in the end, we are all people.
I'm sorry you're hurt because a few others
and I rejected you. Marissa. But imagine how
those who didn't now feel.

Ron Paul is NOT Insane
To the Editor:
I can't blame Stuart Baimel too much for
his Nov. 14 column ("Ron Paul is insane"].
When I was a student at Stanford. I would

have been too busy to do what I've done re
cently: attend political events like the lowa
Straw Poll, read broadly and examine con
gressional records.
Had he done so, Mr. Baimel would have
quickly realized that Paul's supporters are
not limited to the Internet, as he and other
detractors would have you believe. Nor are
we "disaffected young white males wanting
to stick it to the Man."
My perspective is more than that of a
U.S. citizen who's had the benefit of a Stan
ford education; it is that of a veteran. Serv
ing as an infantry officer, first in
Afghanistan, then in Iraq, has broadened
my view on the elephants in the room ig
nored by Baimel's column.
Baimel's concern that Paul is "content
to let ... wars of aggression and human
rights violations occur abroad," is a distor
tion of Paul's stance that the President
lacks the constitutional authority to go to
war without Congressional approval. It is
also comical in light of OUR war of aggres
sion, to which Baimel turns a blind eye. I
guess we don't all have the benefit of hav
ing seen it up close.
My oath of commissioning included a
pledge to "support and defend the Constitu
tion of the United States against all enemies
foreign and domestic." It's no coincidence
that Paul gets more support from current and
former members of the military than any
other candidate.
Like most of Paul's detractors, Baimel ig
nores the erosion of our Constitutional rights
under this Presidency's rapidly expanding
powers. The next president, whoever s/he is,
will inherit these expanded powers, and no
presidential candidate besides Paul has ex
pressed an interest in doing anything besides
wielding them.
It must take very selective perception by
Mr. Baimel to see Paul's views as a "contra
dictory hodgepodge." There is no more con
sistent. principled congressmen. A Wall
Street Journal editorial said "Ron Paul has a
record of philosophical consistency un
matched in recent Congressional history."
I can't imagine what my time in Iraq had
to do with defending the Constitution. My
support of Paul has everything to do with it.
rhere is nothing "fringe" about a consistent,
constitutional approach to government.
