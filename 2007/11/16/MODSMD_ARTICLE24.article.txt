## Girard hopes to finish on top Senior looking for second title in Stanford career 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Franci Girard of the women's volleyball
team has a lot to look forward to: Studying in
Beijing, graduating in Beijing and a job offer in
New York City.
But first things first for the senior middle
blocker. Girard is looking to keep her eyes on
the prize — bringing home her second NCAA
title for Stanford in the upcoming month.
One of the team captains this year. Girard
was a starter on the team that beat Minnesota
to take home the 2004 Championship and was
on the court for last year's final-match loss to
Nebraska.
"Of course, I'll never forget the feeling ol
winning the Pinal Four my freshman year," she
said. "But I also know what it feels like not to
win. 1 think that has been where a lot of my pas
sion comes from this year."
She and senior teammate Bryn Kehoe, the
Cardinal's setter, added one accomplishment
that had so far eluded them when Stanford beat
Washington in Seattle last week — the first
such victory in their collegiate careers.
"I am really proud of us." Girard said. "I
think that we knew how much was at stake, l or
me and Bryn.it has been a long journey and we
have gone up there every year and not had it
turn out the way we wanted it to.so it felt real
ly, really good."
After hosting Arizona and Arizona State
this weekend, the Cardinal will face No. 6Cal in
the final Pac-10 match of the season. Though
the Cardinal will likely host in the first round of
playoffs and is a pre-selected Regional host,
that match is officially the last home game ol
the season and thus Senior Night.
"I think I am still in denial," Girard said. "I
feel like a senior at times, but 1 don't feel like it
should be my last year. It's sad and I know I'm
going to be a mess on Senior Night."
Girard has come a long way since first step
ping on the court in 2004. A four-year starter,
she is currently fourth on the team with IS3
kills, and her hitting percentage of .334 ranks
seventh in the Pac-10. She recorded a career
best 15 kills earlier this year against Minnesota
and is having her best offensive season yet at
Stanford.
"One thing that [head coach] John |Dun-
ning) always tells me is 'When you do some
thing. do it with a purpose.'" she said. "I think
especially my freshman and sophomore year, 1

would just go up to hit, and in college you can't
do that because everybody is too good. I think
I have learned how to see the block and think
in midair to decide what the best shot is. And
everything I do now is with a purpose."
She carries that same mentality into work
ing with her sorority. Delta SigmaTheta. where
she has recently helped organize a fashion
show to raise awareness of women's issues
worldwide and a clothing drive for the victims
of the fires in southern California.
"It's something I take a lot of pride in," she
said.
An International Relations major. Girard is
also looking forward to spending her spring
quarter abroad at Stanford's campus in China
and already has a job offer for next year from
Goldman-Sachs.
"I don't know if I am going to take that yet."
she s;iid. "I really want to play overseas as well,
so I have a lot of exciting opportunities fur next
year to choose from."
For now, though, the priority is getting three
more wins in conference and carrying that mo
mentum into the NCAA Tournament.
"I think that we are at the point in the sea
son where teams know us. they know our ten
dencies." she said. "Every game is just a dog
fight — everybody is really going for it and re
ally wants it. Arizona State is in a situation
where they need to win to get into the tourna
ment.so they will be going hard. I think that ba
sically we need to focus on our serving and
passing and just execute."
The Cardinal (24-2, 13-2) swept both
schools on a swing through Arizona last month.
Against the Sun Devils (15-12,7-7), junior out
side hitter ('ynthia Barboza had 15 kills to lead
eight players hitting .400 or better — Girard
had a kill on each of her seven swings on the
night. Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wohad 11 kills and hit .455 m Stanford's 3-0 vic
tory over the Wildcats (13-14,3-11).
Hie Sun Devils bounced back from a loss to
Washington to beat Arizona last weekend.
Freshman Sarah Reaves is ASI J's top hitter —
and missed the last match against Stanford with
an injury while libero Sydney Donahue an
chors the defense with a conference-leading
6.16 digs per game, ninth-best in the nation.
The Wildcats arrive at Maples mired in a
two-game losing streak after dropping the in
state rivalry match to ASI J and then falling in a
non-conference match against Colorado State.
Randv ( ioodenough leads the Arizona offense

with 354 kills and Dominique Lamb is second
in the conference in blocking with 1.51 per
game.
1 rcshman outside hitter Alix Klineman had
a career-high 22 kills in Stanford's 3-1 win over
Cal (20-6. 10-5) in the Pac 10 season opener.
Cal won the first game of the match before the
( ardinal came back to win three straight.
Cal lost to No. 4 Washington in four games
last weekend, but had won their previous four
matches and have only two losses in their last
12. Outside hitters liana Cutura and Angie
Pressey each have over 3(H) kills on the season
and I lien ()rchard's 1.65 blocks per game is the

best in the Pac-10.
So does the Cardinal have what it takes to
beat Cal and make a run at another champi
onship?
"Absolutely," Girard said. "We definitely
have the talent and we definitely have the
focus. We are motivated and I think we have
some great leaders — not just the seniors but
from all the classes — and we have stepped up
in tough situations. 1 have complete faith in
every single person that steps on the court."

Cal (20-6. 10-5) in the Pac 10 season opener.
Cal won the first game of the match before the
( ardinal came back to win three straight.
Cal lost to No. 4 Washington in four games
last weekend, but had won their previous four
matches and have only two losses in their last
12. Outside hitters liana Cutura and Angie
Pressey each have over 3(H) kills on the season
and I lien ()rchard's 1.65 blocks per game is the

best in the Pac-10.
So does the Cardinal have what it takes to
beat Cal and make a run at another champi
onship?
"Absolutely," Girard said. "We definitely
have the talent and we definitely have the
focus. We are motivated and I think we have
some great leaders — not just the seniors but
from all the classes — and we have stepped up
in tough situations. 1 have complete faith in
every single person that steps on the court."

Senior Franci Girard is in her fourth year starting for the Cardinal and has notched 1 83 kills on
the year while hitting at a clip of .334. Girard is gunning for her second national title at Stanford.
Franci Girard of the women's volleyball
team has a lot to look forward to: Studying in
Beijing, graduating in Beijing and a job offer in
New York City.
But first things first for the senior middle
blocker. Girard is looking to keep her eyes on
the prize — bringing home her second NCAA
title for Stanford in the upcoming month.
One of the team captains this year. Girard
was a starter on the team that beat Minnesota
to take home the 2004 Championship and was
on the court for last year's final-match loss to
Nebraska.
"Of course, I'll never forget the feeling ol
winning the Pinal Four my freshman year," she
said. "But I also know what it feels like not to
win. 1 think that has been where a lot of my pas
sion comes from this year."
She and senior teammate Bryn Kehoe, the
Cardinal's setter, added one accomplishment
that had so far eluded them when Stanford beat
Washington in Seattle last week — the first
such victory in their collegiate careers.
"I am really proud of us." Girard said. "I
think that we knew how much was at stake, l or
me and Bryn.it has been a long journey and we
have gone up there every year and not had it
turn out the way we wanted it to.so it felt real
ly, really good."
After hosting Arizona and Arizona State
this weekend, the Cardinal will face No. 6Cal in
the final Pac-10 match of the season. Though
the Cardinal will likely host in the first round of
playoffs and is a pre-selected Regional host,
that match is officially the last home game ol
the season and thus Senior Night.
"I think I am still in denial," Girard said. "I
feel like a senior at times, but 1 don't feel like it
should be my last year. It's sad and I know I'm
going to be a mess on Senior Night."
Girard has come a long way since first step
ping on the court in 2004. A four-year starter,
she is currently fourth on the team with IS3
kills, and her hitting percentage of .334 ranks
seventh in the Pac-10. She recorded a career
best 15 kills earlier this year against Minnesota
and is having her best offensive season yet at
Stanford.
"One thing that [head coach] John |Dun-
ning) always tells me is 'When you do some
thing. do it with a purpose.'" she said. "I think
especially my freshman and sophomore year, 1

would just go up to hit, and in college you can't
do that because everybody is too good. I think
I have learned how to see the block and think
in midair to decide what the best shot is. And
everything I do now is with a purpose."
She carries that same mentality into work
ing with her sorority. Delta SigmaTheta. where
she has recently helped organize a fashion
show to raise awareness of women's issues
worldwide and a clothing drive for the victims
of the fires in southern California.
"It's something I take a lot of pride in," she
said.
An International Relations major. Girard is
also looking forward to spending her spring
quarter abroad at Stanford's campus in China
and already has a job offer for next year from
Goldman-Sachs.
"I don't know if I am going to take that yet."
she s;iid. "I really want to play overseas as well,
so I have a lot of exciting opportunities fur next
year to choose from."
For now, though, the priority is getting three
more wins in conference and carrying that mo
mentum into the NCAA Tournament.
"I think that we are at the point in the sea
son where teams know us. they know our ten
dencies." she said. "Every game is just a dog
fight — everybody is really going for it and re
ally wants it. Arizona State is in a situation
where they need to win to get into the tourna
ment.so they will be going hard. I think that ba
sically we need to focus on our serving and
passing and just execute."
The Cardinal (24-2, 13-2) swept both
schools on a swing through Arizona last month.
Against the Sun Devils (15-12,7-7), junior out
side hitter ('ynthia Barboza had 15 kills to lead
eight players hitting .400 or better — Girard
had a kill on each of her seven swings on the
night. Junior middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wohad 11 kills and hit .455 m Stanford's 3-0 vic
tory over the Wildcats (13-14,3-11).
Hie Sun Devils bounced back from a loss to
Washington to beat Arizona last weekend.
Freshman Sarah Reaves is ASI J's top hitter —
and missed the last match against Stanford with
an injury while libero Sydney Donahue an
chors the defense with a conference-leading
6.16 digs per game, ninth-best in the nation.
The Wildcats arrive at Maples mired in a
two-game losing streak after dropping the in
state rivalry match to ASI J and then falling in a
non-conference match against Colorado State.
Randv ( ioodenough leads the Arizona offense

with 354 kills and Dominique Lamb is second
in the conference in blocking with 1.51 per
game.
