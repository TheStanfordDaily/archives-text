to lesser opponents in recent
weeks — including a scoreless

top of the tournament bracket
based on a season full of strong
victories.
Stanford won five games
against teams that finished the
season with a top 25 ranking in
the National Soccer Coaches As
sociation of America poll, defeat
ing Virginia, Notre Dame, Cali
fornia. Missouri and Connecticut
this year. Only two ranked teams,
UCLA and I JSC. tied or heat the
Cardinal this season.
Stanford definitely has the
pedigree to make a deep run in
the tournament. In addition to the
squad's quality wins, the Cardinal re
turns every contributor from last sea
son's NCAA run.The team made the
Sweet 16 before being eliminated by
Clemson on penalty kicks.
Sophomore forward Kelley
O'l lara and freshman forward Chris
ten Press come into this year's tour
ney as Stanford's go-to players.
O'Hara leads the Cardinal in both
scoring categories, with eight goals
and five assists, while Press has
scored three goals in the last three

games, improving her season tallies
to six goals and five assists.

not record a loss in three NCAA
games last year, but she could not
make up for the missed Stanford
penalty kicks in the shootout against
Clemson.
Sacramento State (12-3-5) ended
its regular season on a high note, win
ning four straight games in the Big
Sky Conference tournament to cap
ture the league title and an automat
ic berth in the NCAA tournament.
The I lornets have four players with

racked up 14 goals and seven assists
on the season.
1 lornets goalkeeper Mandy Tro
jan has 11 wins and nine shutouts this
season, with a .071 goals-against av
erage.

to State on the year, although the
Cardinal has seen both potential sec
ond-round opponents. Stanford
faced off against Santa Clara and Cal
on consecutive weekends in October,
outshooting Santa Clara 26-5 in a
scoreless tie before beating up on the
Golden Bears in a 4-2 win.
