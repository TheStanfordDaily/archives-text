## Weekend warriors 
### 
It's that time of the year again: Fall
sports are ending their regular sea
sons and the quest for national ti
tles is beginning. Die excitement and
quality of NCAA Tournament play is
unrivaled in the sports world, and this
year should be no different.
The Cardinal has five fall sports
teams in the hunt for NCAA titles and
some begin their journeys this week
end. The stakes are as high as they've
ever been. It's one-and-done now, and
you can sure bet no team wants to go
home empty-handed.
Now on to the winners and losers
for the upcoming weekend of college
sports.
Winner: Stanford Women's Soccer
After grabbing a top-four regional
seed in the NCAA tournament, the
Stanford women's soccer team hosts
the first and second rounds today and
Sunday, respectively. The Cardinal
women finished with an outstanding
record of 14-2-4 overall and 5-1-3 in
Pac-10 play.They will face Sacramento
State today and a win will advance
them to play the winner of the Cal-
Santa Clara game.
Stanford is looking to avenge last
year's dramatic loss to Clemson in the
round of 16. where the Cardinal played
well but could not put any shots in the
net and lost on penalty kicks.The ladies
have something to prove this year, and
they should be able to go through the
weekend undefeated.
Seniors Shari Summers and Rachel
Buehler are in the home stretch of
their Stanford careers and will do their
best to make sure it doesn't end until
they are the last team standing.
Loser: Ohio State
Just a week ago, this game looked
like it would be one of the biggest con
tests of the season. But with both
Michigan and Ohio State losing last
Saturday, this game suddenly has far
fewer BCS implications than once
thought.The Big Ten title, however, re
mains still up for grabs.
Michigan has lost two in a row in
this epic rivalry game, including two
years ago when Ohio State came back
late to win in the final two minutes.
Even though Michigan has struggled
in a few games this year, Lloyd Carr's
squad is still capable of beating the
Buckeyes. If running back Mike Hart is
healthy for the Wolverines and they
are pumped up enough for the game,
then the edge goes to Michigan, who is
trying to salvage their season after
their stunning loss to Appalachian
State in season's opening weekend.
The only question is this: Will a win on
Saturday save Lloyd Carr's job?
Winner: Stanford Cross Country
Stanford Women's Cross Country
has been on top of the NCAA ranks
throughout the entire season.The Car
dinal earned a Pac-10 championship,
and last weekend they won the NCAA
Western Regionals in dominating
fashion. But it all comes down to Mon
day in Terre Haute. Indiana as the
Stanford women seek their third con
secutive NCAA Championship.
There should be no stopping these
ladies, as seniors Teresa McWalters
and Arianna Lambie are among the
top runners in the country and should
record top-10 finishes. Look for the
women's cross country team to cap
ture the first NCAA championship of
the year for Stanford and its third
straight title.
Loser: California
Stanford men's soccer plays host to
rival Cal in the regular season finale for
both teams on Saturday night. The
Bears have already wrapped up the
