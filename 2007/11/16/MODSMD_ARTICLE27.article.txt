## Cardinal looking to kick back 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Big Game fever has hit Stan
ford's campus and not just for the
football team. At 7 p.m. on Satur
day. Stanford men's soccer takes on
hated rival Cal in its final game of
the regular season. While most of
the student body is heading home,
the team plans to defend its home
field in the final game of Pacific-10
Conference play.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro felt
assured that the team will rally, de
spite the fact that the Bears have al
ready won the Pac-10 outright.
"It's never tough to get up for a
game against Cal." Shapiro said.
"F.ven though we probably won't
make the playoffs and they have al

ready clinched the league title, both
teams will play as if this game
means everything. I also think we
match up well with Cal. especially
on our home field."
Stanford (6-6-5, 3-4-2 Pac-10)
lost last weekend's road games at
Oregon State and Washington,
which will likely exclude them from
postseason play. No. 20 Cal (11 -4-2,
6-2-1 Pac-10) had better luck, beat
ing the Huskies 1-0 before tying
OSU 0-0.
Although the Cardinal lost its
first meeting with the Bears 1-0 on
Oct. 20. Stanford's tough defense
kept Cal's leading scorers — senior
Javier Ayala-I till (3 goals, 5 assists)
and freshman Andrew Wiedeman
(6 goals. 4 assists) — off of the stat
sheet as Cal's only goal came off

the foot of junior Pat Marion.
Coach Bret Simon hopes that a
similar effort will lead to better re
sults on Saturday.
"Keeping Javier Ayala-Hill and
Andrew Wiedeman under control
is easier said than done," he said.
"Each played a good game at
Berkeley ... earlier in the fall even
though neither scored a goal. We
certainly will pay attention to them
and try to limit their success."
Defender Scott Rolkan went
further, noting Stanford's confi
dence that the team will do more
than just keep up with the Bears.
"Despite our records, the team
stats show we are very well
matched," Bolkan said. "1 think we
believe we actually have a better
team than they do, which is why it's
so important that we go out and
prove this to everyone."
The squads' statistics do indeed
indicate a close match-up as the
teams are tied with 22 goals apiece
this season and rank first and second
in number of goals allowed in the
Pac-10. Because Stanford and Cal

play similar styles, Simon knows that
the Cardinal will need to work espe
cially hard to get on the board.
"I do expect the game will be
very even," Simon said. "I think the
game will have a good offensive
flow. But each team has quality goal
keepers and strong defenders, so it
won't be easy to score."
Bolkan agreed that just creating
opportunities won't be enough; the
Card struggled to finish such
chances this weekend, out-shooting
Washington and Oregon State but
ultimately losing both matches.
"I think we'll definitely put a lot
of pressure on them early," Bolkan

commented. "We always play well at
home — we haven't lost a Pac-10
game here yet — and I'm confident
our offense will produce a lot of dan
gerous opportunities. From there,
it's only a matter of putting the ball
in the back of the net."
Beyond specific on-field goals,
each Stanford player held one re
sounding focus: Beat Cal.
As an underclassman, sopho
more Michael Strickland hopes to
secure a win for the outgoing sen
iors.
"We are looking to win and pum
mel our rivals," Strickland said. "We
would love to win for the seniors and

send them out on a semi-high note.
We work hard at practice and look
to finish the season above 500."
Bolkan, along with the other sen
iors, wants a win against Cal to finish
his time at Stanford.
"The fact that this will he our last
game as seniors raises the stakes so
much more," he said. "All of us
would love to end our college ca
reers with a win over Cal, and that
will he a huge motivation going into
the game. After that, we have our
whole lives to be nostalgic."
