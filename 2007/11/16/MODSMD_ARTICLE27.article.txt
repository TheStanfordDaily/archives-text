## Cardinal looking to kick back 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Big Game fever has hit Stan
ford's campus and not just for the
football team. At 7 p.m. on Satur
day. Stanford men's soccer takes on
hated rival Cal in its final game of
the regular season. While most of
the student body is heading home,
the team plans to defend its home
field in the final game of Pacific-10
Conference play.
Senior forward Dan Shapiro felt
assured that the team will rally, de
spite the fact that the Bears have al
ready won the Pac-10 outright.
"It's never tough to get up for a
game against Cal." Shapiro said.
"F.ven though we probably won't

and freshman Andrew Wiedeman
(6 goals. 4 assists) — off of the stat
sheet as Cal's only goal came off

the foot of junior Pat Marion.
Coach Bret Simon hopes that a
similar effort will lead to better re
sults on Saturday.
"Keeping Javier Ayala-Hill and
Andrew Wiedeman under control
is easier said than done," he said.
"Each played a good game at
Berkeley ... earlier in the fall even
though neither scored a goal. We
certainly will pay attention to them
and try to limit their success."
Defender Scott Rolkan went
further, noting Stanford's confi
dence that the team will do more
than just keep up with the Bears.
"Despite our records, the team
stats show we are very well
