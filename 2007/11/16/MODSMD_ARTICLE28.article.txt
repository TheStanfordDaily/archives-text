# Women's Basketball Candice Wiggins
## Wiggins measures up to praise 
### BY HALEY MURPHY 
Mens basketball coach Trent Johnson intro
duced her as "arguably the best player Tara
VanDerveer has ever coached" at the men's
tip-off event. VanDerveer prefers words like
"fantastic" or "spectacular."
Talking heads and sportscasters across America, such as
ESPN.com s Graham 1 lays, hail her as "the best all-around,
inch-for-inch player in the country." But on the campus of
Stanford University, Candice Wiggins receives surprisingly
little public recognition.
The relative anonymity of one of Stanford's best female
guards of all time is surprising, though it doesn't seem to both
er the 5-foot-11 (and a half) player from San Diego. When
Stanford suffered a stunning second-round loss against Flori
da State in last season's NCAA Tournament, Wiggins quiet
ly took it in stride, heading back to t he gym to prepare for this,
her senior year.
"The ending of last year absolutely motivated me to
change." Wiggins said. "Last April 1 had the opportunity to
speak to Armintie Price from Ole Miss (an All-American last
season), and she told me about how Ole Miss went from hav
ing a losing season two seasons ago to going to the Elite 8 last
season. (SheJ was very honest about how their team turned
everything around: hard work. It was simple."
Luckily, working hard is one of the things Wiggins does
best. VanDerveer highlighted athleticism, competitiveness
and intelligence as qualities that set Wiggins apart, though
she knows that the phenom is more than a sum of her parts.
"There is something really special [about her]." Van
DerVeer said. "| But.] it's hard to put your finger on: it's a lot
of intangible things. She's very unselfish and she really under
stands ... that basketball's a team sport."
Wiggins proved her dedication to this team mentality
throughout the 2(X)(v()7 season, when she was not only
plagued by several minor injuries — including a recurring
hamstring strain — but also asked to play the point guard po
sition after both Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and JJ Hones were
taken out of the mix with knee injuries.
In true Wiggins fashion, she rallied away from her pre
ferred shooting guard spot and still managed to place second
on the team in assists (%). She led the Pac-10 in three-point
ers (82) and ranked third in the conference with a 3.3 assist
to-turnover ratio. Wiggins also led the team in scoring (If). 1 )
ppg) for the third consecutive season.

llic same kind of success has surfaced already in the Car
dinal's 2-0 start to the season. Wiggins led the team with
points against then-No. 3 Rutgers, and she dropped two foal
shots with less than a second on the clock to secure a 60-58
win.
"1 knew 1 had the opportunity to end the game right then
and there," she said "Free throws are extremely mental,so it's
just about going to the line and exuding confidence and being
relaxed."
In such situations. Wiggins draws on the confidence that
developed under the careful prodding of skilled teammates
and coaches at Stanford. With Hones and Gold-Onwude
back alongside junior Jillian Harmon, freshman Kayla Ped
ersen and sophomore Jayne Appel in the front court, the
quality of surrounding players remains top-notch. With a
strong supporting cast behind her, Wiggins hopes to continue
her maturation as an all-around player.
"1 think the biggest improvement of my game since I've
been here is versatility as a guard," she said. "[l'm] able to
take my player off the dribble but also knock down my
perimeter shot. [But] the most important thing for me to do
is to not force shots and to let the offense come to me. There
will be times [ when) 1 have to be aggressive and look to score,
but 1 also have great teammates who can take some of the of
fensive scoring load off me."
Coach VanDerveer also looks to correct the few remain
ingflawsin the National Player of the Year contender's game.
"She always wants to improve, and 1 think that's how she's
always been; that's all she knows," VanDerveer said. "I [still]
always want to challenge Candice to improve. I think she
could be a better defender. 1 think she could be a more effi
cient scorer. There are things that she can do better, and I
know she wants to have an outstanding senior year for her
team."
Wiggins, though, is well aware that the season only moves
one game at a time and is trying not to look too far into the
future.
"Right now 1 am just working hard to enjoy every second
of the season, whether it be practice or games," she said, 'it
goes by fast and the sense of urgency really kicks in your last
year. 1 am so excited about this team and all my energy is fo
cused on helping us develop into a Final Four team. The op
portunities that may come up in the future will be there, but
instead of lm>king ahead I'm really trying to work one day at
a time."
