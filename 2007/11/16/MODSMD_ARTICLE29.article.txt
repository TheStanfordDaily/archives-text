## Triumphing over Turnovers 
### BY PATRICK FITZGERALD 
When UC-Santa Barbara got physical in
the opening minutes of last Sunday's
contest, Stanford did not panic.The Car
dinal had been there before.
Much was made about Stanford's inability to handle
the ball under pressure last season, when Louisville ha
rassed the Cardinal with a full-court press that put Stan
ford away 78-58 in the opening round of the NCAA Tour
nament. The Cardinal committed 21 turnovers in that
contest, succumbing to a flurry of traps and steals cour
tesy of Rick Pitino's squad.
That was last season, however, and what a difference
eight months can make.
"I don't think pressure gets to us now," senior forward
Fred Washington said after No. 20 Stanford disposed of
Santa Barbara last weekend. "We work on it all the time.
We come with a little experience."
Call it the x-factor.This season it is firmly in Stanford's
favor.
Washington should know. This is his fifth year on the
Farm, having received an extra year of eligibility after
only appearing in six games in 2005-06. J le is one of three
seniors on a roster that leans heavily on upperclassmen,
with four juniors in the fold as well.
The Cardinal is also the only team in the Pac-10 to re
turn all five starters this season, although it will have to
wait for Brook Lopez to return from academic ineligibil
ity to enjoy that advantage in full.
While last year's team was far from perfect, Stanford
is hoping that it can learn from a taking a few knocks in
seasons past.
"Last year sometimes we were fooled," Washington
said of the defensive traps and pressure schemes often
successfully employed by the opposing squad. "This year
we're always going to respond."
Through three games, Stanford is averaging 14.67
turnovers a game, nearly identical to last season's aver
age of 14.8. Assists are up, however, from 14.83 to 17.67.
And on-the-court chemistry does not always show up in
the box score.
Has experience been a factor in the Cardinal's domi
nant 3-0 start?
"Oh yeah, without a doubt," said senior forward and
team co-captain Taj Finger. Knowing what to expect from
your teammates is invaluable, he said, as is developing a
familiarity and comfort zone on the court.
Experience is often overlooked by national pundits
and talking heads, however, which leads to the "lack of re
spect" Stanford gets from the national media. Finger said,
shaking his head after hearing an ESPN sportscaster pre
dict that Stanford and Cal would be the only teams in the
Pac-10 not to make the NCAA tournament.
Meanwhile, the hype and national attention go to

schools like USC, where much ballyhooed freshman O.J.
Mayo scored 32 points as the then-No. 18 Trojans suf
fered an embarrassing %-81 defeat to tiny Mercer. The
upset made headlines nationwide but surprised few in the
Stanford program, who privately point out that the
Trojans lost their top three scorers from last season.
Stanford suffered no such surprises during its debut,
outscoring its opponents by a 37.7-point margin. In years
past, the Cardinal would often struggle to put inferior
teams away early on. But this season? So far, so good.
"No question, it's an experienced group: Guys have
been here three, four years," head coach Trent Johnson
said. "It's reassuring to me that their approach to the
game and approach to practice has been good. As long as
we continue to do those things we're going to be fine."
In terms of that approach to practice and games, John
son said this year's team is "the best [he's] seen" during
his time on the Farm. Johnson was assistant coach at Stan
ford when the Cardinal made an appearance in the Final
Four onee and the Sweet Sixteen twice, so ii is safe to say
he thinks this year's squad is headed in the right direc
tion.
"They're good players," he said, before adding a dose
of self-depreciating humor. "I'm sure not a good coach, I
can tell you that."
