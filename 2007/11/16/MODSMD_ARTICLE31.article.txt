## 
### 
Leave it to Stanford to have not
only one of the world's top super
computers but also one of greenest.
Bio-X2, a supercomputer cluster
at the James H. Clark Center, is
ranked No. 73 on TOPsoo's list of the
world's fastest supercomputers. The
30th edition of the TOPSOO survey
was released on Nov. 12 and ana
lyzed by a group at Virginia Tech for
its own list, the Greensoo. Bio-X2
ranked No. 6 on the green list based
on its computational power per watt
of energy used.
According to Clark Cent rand
Bio-X IT Manager Tanya Raschke,
Bio-X2 — which studies "problems
ranging in scale from sub-molecular
to organismal and everything in be
tween"— garnered the high rank
ing because of the use of Intel Quad
core Xeon processors in its Dell
Poweredge servers.
