## TAKE JING HOME TONIGHT 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION RECLUSES 
When the laundry isn't done and papers
aren't written, you can't dress up and you
can't go out. The only logical thing to do is dig
out the famed Ugly Holiday Sweater, order
Chinese food and sulk.
Janet's Ugly Holiday
Sweater is a Christmas
themed one. Although we
are admittedly closer to
Thanksgiving than to Xmas,
one can't really afford to be
choosy about one's Ugly
Holiday Sweater. You
take what you can
get, which in Janet's
case is a man-sized red
sweater emblazoned
with Santa Gaus. who

is yelling "Ho! Ho! Ho!" This is possibly a
comment on Janet.
Ruth's sweater is a Thanksgiving-themed
one, which features a pilgrim smoking a pipe.
We don't know what's in the pipe. But the pil
grim does have a bell on his hat. Both of our
Holiday Sweaters are comfy. We don them,
plus sweatpants. We buckle down to our Mil
ton papers. We call up Jing Jing Szechwan &
Hunan Gourmet, mostly because they'll de
liver to the Stanford campus. We order.
Before we describe our Hating In adven
ture, let's take a brief look at the Eating Out
side of this equation. We've both been to Jing
Jing before (on Emerson Street in Palo Alto)
and have found it to be both prolific and
spicy. The menu is extensive and treatise-like,
so there is no dearth of choice. Jing Jing is a
typical American Chinese restaurant — the
sort of place that serves bastardized versions
of Chinese dishes without shame and with a
significant amount of grease. This is
fine, this is comforting — this is Amer
ica. You should also know that Jing
Jing doesn't bill itself as "The
Hottest Place in Town" for noth
ing. Watch out for menu items
with tiny chili peppers next to
them; you might be interested in
exploring the "Mild" versions of
these dishes.
Although we were fairly excited
about eating at Jing Jing (excited
enough to return), we were wary
about ordering in. After all, endless
fuck-ups can occur in the delivery
process: mistaken addresses, incorrect
dishes, leaking hot sauce, an odd number
of chopsticks... One must really have one's
shit together in order to run a satisfactory de
livery service. And the good news is that Jing
Jing does deliver well, which is excellent
for these writers who are tired of en-
gaging in endlessly irritating ne
gotiations with Pizza My
Being tied to
you. Gentle Reader, by
bonds of trust and mutual es
teem. we arc obligated to acknowledge
that delivery food is un petit pen shameful.
It's not rra/gourmandizing. For one, it brings

up a number of questions, such as Why are
you too lazy to put on some real pants and get
on a bloody Marguerite? or Why can't you
just be normal like the rest of us and subsist
on Ramen and powdered hot chocolate eaten
straight out of the packet? The practice of or
dering in is, while admittedly kind of wonder
ful, inescapably slovenly and indulgent,
which is why you have to do it in your most
shameful of shameful garments: the Holiday
Sweater. And so we placed our order via
phone (one may pay by credit card over the
phone) and sat eagerly in wait, adjusting our
sweaters.
The food arrived in a timely fashion, about
30 minutes post-order, and was delivered di
rectly to our second-floor double without
confusing phone calls about Where exactly
are you. and what is a Durand? The food was
hot, spill-free and neatly packaged, with
plates and utensils thoughtfully included for
the kitchen-less undergraduate. We hurried
ly unpacked our choices — pork dumplings,
broccoli with garlic sauce and orange chicken
— and made quick work of our meal, drop
ping the occasional unexpected morsel of
chicken on our Holiday Sweaters.
Jing Jing is nothing if not dependable. The
quality of the food is consistent and decent, if
not stellar. The pork dumplings, for example,
are like Ruth: they're not great, but they're
not terrible. They consist of strangely cohe
sive lumps of somewhat-flavorful, blandly
textured pork bundled tightly into dough
pockets. The point is, they're warm, some
what tasty, they come with an interesting
sauce, and they're comforting. Which is real
ly what one is looking for when one is wearing
an Ugly Holiday Sweater and trying to write
about John fucking Milton.
If you're big on appetizers, other items
worth investigation include the egg rolls and
the hot & sour soup (served hot, not cold).
Moving on to our veg: the broccoli with garlic
sauce is one of those items for which the
"Mild" option might be appropriate. You
know that face cats make when they vomit
and ihey're really surprised and they cough
and sputter? Well that's the face Ruth makes
when she eats this broccoli — the dish is ini
tially surprising, though eventually delicious.
Which is not to suggest that cat vomit is even

tually delicious, hut merely that it shares that
clement of initial surprise.
The orange peel chicken was the standout
of our sad little late-night dinner. Although
the chicken is listed on the "Hot & Spicy"
menu, this listing is a patent lie. The chicken
is neither hot nor spicy, unless one is in pos
session of a truly weak palate. This chicken,
which some of you American-Chinese-food
connoisseurs may also know as General Tso's
Chicken, is a must-have dish at JingJing. Un
like the potstickcrs, it is not merely accept
able, but excellent. The chicken comes in
manageable, bite-sized pieces which contain
just the right ratio of chicken to fried-surface
and are covered in an intriguing orange
sauce, the ingredients of which we do not care
to know, lest they ruin our love of this superb
dish.
Other especially tempting entrees include
mu-shu pork, sweet & sour pork, Mongolian
beef and any of the chow meins. Although
Jing Jing offers so many meat dishes, their
meat is of a consistently high quality, so you
need not worry about venturing into the
dustier corners of the menu. The cold soups
and straight-up vegetable dishes are, howev
er, generally less interesting than the rest of
the menu, and Jing Jing is consequently not
very vegetarian-friendly. Sorry. But it isshar
ing-friendly. so make sure you have a friend
with whom to share your late-night snacks,
because this food at its most enjoyable when
you can order several dishes and pass them
around.
Although this meal was slightly more ex
pensive than a pizza (entrees are around $9
each). Jing Jing is appetizing comfort food,
and who can put a price on that? It has the ad
ditional benefit of convincing Ruth that she is
part of a Woody Allen studio-apartment din
ner scene, in which Mia Farrow is very cute
and ambles around with chopsticks, dropping
lo mein on the floor. It's a pity Mia didn't
wear more Ugly Holiday Sweaters.
Jing Jing delivers dinner from 4:30 - 9:30 on
weekdays and 4:30 - 9:30 on weekends. For
