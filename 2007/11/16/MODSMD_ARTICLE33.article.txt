## Don't sweat holiday gift shopping 
### BY KELLY PETERSON INTERMISSION PERSONAL SHOPPER 
After Thanksgiving dinner. I know
that some of us will he thinking about
more than the massive amounts of food
we ate as we drift off into a tryptophan-in
duced stupor — we'll be thinking about
the post-Thanksgiving sales. Yes, it's that
time of year — holiday shopping is upon
us once again. But instead of braving the
cold and the hoards of middle-aged
women eager to save $3 on DVDs at Wal-
Mart. take a peek at the following gift
suggestions for friends and random rela
tives galore — all from the comfort of
your own Internet connection and guar
anteed to yield better gift purchases than
an ugly sweater.
For Dad:
The perfect gifts for father figures are
the kind that they would really love but
would never get themselves. My dad has
everything he needs, but he probably
doesn't realize how much he'd enjoy
something like a Monogrammed Steak
Brand ($39.95. williamssonoma.com) for
summer grilling or a men's shaving kit
from Burt's Bees. ($3O, burtsbees.com).
Totally unnecessary, yes, but sure to be
appreciated.

For Mom:
A set of teas
from Teavana is

a fairly easy and
inexpensive

gift that any
mom would

enjoy. My fa
vorite is a
blend of
Ma t 6

Vana and
Rooi
bos

Chai
(about

$10 for 4
ounces)

that serves as
the perfect

breakfast blend.
Also on my radar

was a set of hugging salt and pepper shak
ers. $25 from the MoMA Design Store —
surprisingly sleek, and just cutesy enough
to appeal to her softer side.
For Boyfriend:
Oh. boyfriend. It's always difficult to
find the right balance between personal
and easy, thoughtful but not cloyingly
sentimental. Urban Outfitter books —
like "Bathroom Graffiti," $14.95 ur
banoutfitters.com — might strike just
that chord. Another idea, since you're not
likely to be with your Stanford boyfriend
at Christmastime, would be to organize a
wine-and-cheese picnic outing before
hand at a nearby park. It's relatively inex
pensive and thoughtful and fun for you
both.
For Girlfriend:
Girlfriends, on the other hand, aren't
likely to be freaked out by gifts that reveal
affection. Jewelry is always a great op-

tion. Check out anthropologie.com

or refinery29shops.com for stuff

that's off the beaten path.

American Apparel and J.

Crew also have adorable

knit hat and scarf

combos

that
would be
perfect for the
upcoming win
ter weather.
For Brother or Best
Guy Friend:
If vour non-ro-

mantic male companion

enjoys ping pong half as much as he
does beer pong, he'll get a kick out of the
"Hit Me With Your Best Shot!" ping
pong paddle set, $25 at fredflare.com.
The paddles themselves say "Fire
Away!" — classic. Another idea: If he
doesn't already have a set of speakers,
fashionation.com has a set of super-com
pact desk speakers for only $14.95.
For Sister or Best Girl Friend:
Note to all my girl friends: This is what
1 want. The "Mary-Kate" brown PVC
satchel is described on fredflare.com as
"almost big enough to hold our fave
Olsen!" — but I'd be pleased to have it
just to schlep books back and forth from
the library. I'm also pretty obsessed with
the set of four Egawari Rice Bowls, only
$17.50 at pearlriver.com. Makes for a
very stylish bowl of cereal.
For Little Cousins/Nephews/Siblings:

While my four-month
old nephew might

not appreciate
th e

humor of
a Fortune Tee onesie,
sporting slogans like "Treats will come to
those who behave" or "A nap is in my fu
ture," 1 think his parents will. They also
come in kid's and adult's t-shirts — only
$14 at fortuneteeshirt.com.
For Anyone and Everyone:
If all else fails, you might consider get
ting that random relative or picky best
friend a trashy, juicy and/or enjoyable
book — not of the I HUM variety. Go to
the "Beach Reads" section of Border's or
pick up any John Grisham novel, and
time how long it takes for him or her to
get hooked. A personalized photo album,
with photos included, always makes a
meaningful (and inexpensive) gift, per
fect for friends from home or long-dis
tance significant others. And finally, if
you're buying for someone you don't
know very well, an iTunes gift card is sure
to please.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, if this list
doesn't help you out. I wish you the best
of luck in surviving the overcrowded
malls. 1, on the other hand, will (cough)

hopefully (cough) be very pleased

with my new Mary-Kate

satchel, if I manage to force
this article upon enough

of my girl friends.
