### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION SARTORIAL SATIRIST 
"The Holiday Sweater"
Constituency: Your grandma; your kinder
garten teacher; second-graders who like horses

Notes: The holiday sweater is a peculiarly
American invention, and, as such, it tends to have a
very Protestant, patriotic bent — few Rosh
Hashanah or Boxing Day sweaters are to be seen

in neighborhood novelty stores. The more popu
lar choices are Christmas (featuring snowmen,
Santa, reindeer, wrapped gifts), Easter (rabbits.

eggs), Halloween (pumpkins, witches), the
fourth of July (red, white and blue, stars, fire
crackers) and Columbus Day (syphilis). The
Holiday Sweater is worn once a year, unless
the wearer is insane or very cold.

The Cardigan"

Constituent"}': Jimmy Carter; Mr. Rogers; James Thomas Bru-

denell, the 7th Earl of Cardigan
Notes: The cardigan is a comforting presence, especially when glimpsed
on national television. It immediately brings to mind family entertainment
and proper energy usage. It's also good for hiding prison tats.
"The Argyle"
Constituency: Richie Cunningham; British children; golfers; this one
guy you knew in high school
Notes: This distinctive diagonal checkerboard pattern originated as the
tartan of Clan Campbell in Argyll and, like an infectious disease, quickly
spread to the socks and sweaters of early golfers. It didn't catch on among
the general population until the 19505, when officers in the field began using
it as an instrument of torture.

"The Cosby"
Constituency: Bill Cosby
Notes: Bill Cosby wears this.
"The Old-Time College Letter Sweater"
Constituency: Mabel; Georgie; Louetta; Orville; Vergil; Myra
Notes: Baaaaaaatle-ax
Get an ax
Bal-ax
Get-nax
Who, who? The U.!
Hooroo!
Boola boola boola!

The Upper-Crust East Coast Trust Fund Yacht Club Squash Players

Cable-Knit Pullover"

Constituency: Upper-crust East Coast trust fund

yacht club squash players

Notes: It is a well-known fact

that playing more than two tra

ditionally white, prep-school sports — say
lacrosse, racquetball and crew — will cause you to

spontaneously blip out and rematerialize on a
schooner discussing silverware with John Kerry.
Both of you will be wearing pullovers.

" The '40s Pin-Up"

Constituency: Lima Turner; Jane Russell;
women with shockingly conical breasts

Notes: The glamorous "Sweater Girl'
phenomenon is an artifact of a bygone cul
tural era that is now nothing more than a
dim memory — a backward time when
actresses and, indeed, women in general /

were valued not for their skill or intelli
gence but rather their supple, volup
tuous breasts, damp with perspiration,
or maybe oiled and gleaming, but in
any case really, really hot. i

"The Sweater Vest"
Constituency: Douche bags;

those with torsos but no arms
Notes: In every state except
for New Jersey and Maryland, it
is legal to run over someone
wearing a sweater vest. Woody
Allen is the one exception to this

rule. Nobody touches Woody Allen.

"The Sweater Sleeves"
Constituency: Those with arms but no torsos
Notes: This is not a real thing.
"The Turtleneck"
Constituency: Beatniks; the Frcnch; Captain Haddock
Notes: Traditionally black and accompanied by a beret, sunglasses and
bongos, the turtleneck was, in fact, largely shunned by both real beats and
real Franks, who preferred to demonstrate their cultural allegiances
through oral sex and rampant heroin usage.
"The Countertrend"
Constituency: hip youth; trendy scamps; deck rapscallions; Evo Morales
Notes: Always having to stir up trouble and be rebellious, the younger
generation has taken up knitting and shopping for vintage clothes in an at
tempt to look "different" and express "individuality." Little do they know
that they are mere pawns in the hands of Big Yarn.
"The Metaphor"
Constituency: Weezer
Notes: Definitely stuck in my head.
