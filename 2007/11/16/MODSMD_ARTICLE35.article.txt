### BETSY WALLS INTERMISSION SEASONAL SPIRIT 
The holidays are a time of year uniquely lull of potential for time-wast
ing. You could choreograph a salacious dance with three of your friends
to "Jingle Bell Rock," but if you're not Lindsay Lohan in "Mean Girls,"
wouldn't you rather get festive in a more traditional way? If you feel like
your holiday season could use a few good shots of merry and a helping of
happy, try some of these classic activities.
Idea: Make decorations yourself
Remember the days when you could pin sequins onto a Styrofoam ball
and call it art? Reminisce no more — the holidays offer a perfect excuse
to embrace your inner kindergartener.
For Thanksgiving, fashion a paper turkey by tracing the outline of
your hand on a piece of paper and cutting it out, accessorizing with beak,
eyes, etc. Freshmen, try this one <jt home over Thanksgiving break and
watch your parents' eyes pop out of their heads when you tell them this is
what you've been learning at Stanford!
The later part of the holiday season has even greater opportunity for
arts and crafts of the elementary school variety. Paper (either I HUM or
PWR) chains can serve as garland on a tree or around a dorm room, and

popcorn strings arc easy if you've got a needle, thread and the willpow-

er not to cat all the popcorn. You can

make a plastic wreath by bending the
bottom part of a wire hanger into a cir-

wi cle and tying plain (non-Ziploc) plas-
I tic sandwich baggies around it —
LOTS of plastic baggies. There is also
the Holy Grail of easy Christmas decora
tions: the paper snowflake, which also for-

tunately works

fee through January as
r well, given its generic
"winter" quality. You

Hanging all of your hand
\ made creations is a must. You
get extra points if you deck the
halls while singing "Deck the
\ Halls," complete with the
correct number of fa's and
' la's.

Secret tip: When making

paper snowflakes, don't just fold a square a few
times. Cut out a paper circle first, then fold it and
make fearlessly large cuts along the folds.

Idea: Watch seasonal movies
A "( harlie Brown Christmas" overflows with iconic moments, includ
ing the beautifieation of the spindly Christmas tree due to some love and
attention from the children. If you've never seen it. watch it; if you have,
watch it again.
"Elf features Will Ferrell in a role that, remarkably, does not gain half
its humor from the character's sexism. The movie is a charming story of
the incongruity impossibility of childlike wonder in modern soci
ety. If you're looking for a truly old-school kid's movie, the ciaymation
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," featuring Burl Ives,cannot be beat.
Christmas movies are not all targeted at children, though. "White
Christmas,"a classic musical set in the post-war era, bursts with so much
singing and dancing talent, you'll be able to reminisce right along with
Grandma and Grandpa at dinner about the good old days of Hollywood.
"Love Actually" is a more contemporary choice, with the different love
interactions of many interconnected storylines weaving together a des
perately real and improbably uplifting tale.

If you don't feel like a feature-length film, the holidays always have an

excess of football to watch at any time: Thanksgiving week has con
ference championships and Winter Break is packed full of bowl j
games. There's nothing to take your mind off grades like kicking I
back and zoning out in front of the Startup.com Questionably-1
Themed-Name Bowl Game.

Sitcoms will be in good seasonal form as well. Watch the new I

episodes for some guaranteed gift-giving and party-related plot I

twists. You can also re-experience old favorites like the episode of I

"The Office" in which Michael brings an iPod to the gift swap and I

sulks at receiving a pot holder from Phyllis (Season 2. Episode 10) I
or the episode of Friends when Ross inexplicably dresses up as a I

"Holiday Armadillo" to explain Hanukkah to his son (Season 7.1
Episode 10).

Idea: Make festive treats

Everyone hates fruitcake, though most people have
probably never even tasted one. Don't attempt it.i
Some other holiday specialties, though delicious, are I
best left to the experienced boulanger, the Yule log or '
buche tie Noel being a good example of what to buy
rather than bake.

Remember that the trick of making a holiday goodie is to

give the most banal things a.soupam or spirit. Replace the chocolate
chips in a batch of cookies with red-and-green or blue-and-white M&Ms
— or even just throw some food coloring in scrambled eggs before you
serve them — but do something.
Secret tip: If you're genuinely lazy or culinarily challenged, "Stuff face
with holiday treats" is a simpler variant of this suggestion.
Idea: Drink holiday beverages
Festive limes call for festive measures, and nothing is more appropri
ate than an appropriate beverage. Throw medical caution to the wind and
make real eggnog, complete with risk of salmonella, or else smugly sip the
i 111 l



imitation version secure in relative
bacterial safety — just be sure to
sprinkle cinnamon on top.
Even sunny Stanford gets
nippy on winter nights, and the

steaming warmth of a winter drink is the perfect antidote to the chills. Hot
cocoa stirred with a candy cane is adorably yummy; hot cider also hits the spot
whether it is made by boiling real apples and cinnamon sticks or comes from

a paper packet of powder

For those who imbibe, you can turn these tasty drinks
into tasty grown-up drinks easily — just add a little

brandy, rum and vodka to the eggnog, pepper
mint Schnapps or Bailey's to the hot cocoa, and
put the hard back in cider (unless you barely
even know 'er. of course). Any of these will
taste unbelievably delicious after a long rut of
overpriced Cosmos or frat-provided beer.

If you've decked out your dorm with paper

accents, cooked up some fantastic sugar
based items, and prepared a kettleful of
cocoa, it sounds like you're all ready for the
next idea-

Idea: Throw a holiday party
At last, vou have somewhere
J i
to wear your sweater! In addi
tion to the consumption of food
and drink, have some merriment
making activities. Caroling is a fine
choice: refer to it as wassailing if
vou secrctlv wish vou lived in the

18th

century. Don't forget to

hang a little mistletoe over the door
— it's a historically established fact
that no one standing under a sprig
of a parasitical plant will resist suc
cumbing to a smooch.

Idea: (live presents
This self-explanatory part of the holiday season makes even the most
diehard atheist retailers rejoice and has a surprisingly important effect on the
national economy. Even il you eschew crass commercialism, you can still
make a little something for the people who matter in your life to let them
know you appreciate them. Don't forget to wrap them!
Secret tip: Be creative and eco-conscious by using recycled materials to
wrap presents. Old copies of Intermission look artsy when wrapped neatly
around a box and topped with some ribbon.
Idea: Check out local decorations and events

Both small towns and big cities will have events such as pa

rades or a big Christmas tree lighting —
experience the merriment without

doing any of the work. Somewhere,
two neighbors have taken an inno
cent Christmas lights rivalry too

ar; find this place and marvel at
the attraction of the lights or.
at least, at the sheer wattage
being used. Wander through

the downtown area of the
nearest city and window-shop

the most interesting displays.
Check the paper for free concerts

happening around the holidays.
Take your mom and little brother

and get points from Santa.
Secret tip: The übiquity ol

Christmas displays makes this the eas-

iest idea of the bunch. The real chal
lenge exists in avoiding such displays,
which is practically impossible if you leave

your house between November 1 and Jan
uary 8.

Idea: Combine some of the above...

cutting out paper snowflakes while watching "White Christmas" is almost

This suggestion comes with a warning

cutting out paper snowflakes while watching "White Christmas" is almost
dangerously festive.

The holidays are a time of year uniquely lull of potential for time-wast
ing. You could choreograph a salacious dance with three of your friends
to "Jingle Bell Rock," but if you're not Lindsay Lohan in "Mean Girls,"
wouldn't you rather get festive in a more traditional way? If you feel like
your holiday season could use a few good shots of merry and a helping of
happy, try some of these classic activities.
Idea: Make decorations yourself
Remember the days when you could pin sequins onto a Styrofoam ball
and call it art? Reminisce no more — the holidays offer a perfect excuse
to embrace your inner kindergartener.
For Thanksgiving, fashion a paper turkey by tracing the outline of
your hand on a piece of paper and cutting it out, accessorizing with beak,
eyes, etc. Freshmen, try this one <jt home over Thanksgiving break and
watch your parents' eyes pop out of their heads when you tell them this is
what you've been learning at Stanford!
The later part of the holiday season has even greater opportunity for
arts and crafts of the elementary school variety. Paper (either I HUM or
PWR) chains can serve as garland on a tree or around a dorm room, and

popcorn strings arc easy if you've got a needle, thread and the willpow-

er not to cat all the popcorn. You can

make a plastic wreath by bending the

Hanging all of your hand

correct number of fa's and

Secret tip: When making

paper snowflakes, don't just fold a square a few
times. Cut out a paper circle first, then fold it and
make fearlessly large cuts along the folds.

Idea: Watch seasonal movies
A "( harlie Brown Christmas" overflows with iconic moments, includ
ing the beautifieation of the spindly Christmas tree due to some love and
attention from the children. If you've never seen it. watch it; if you have,
watch it again.
"Elf features Will Ferrell in a role that, remarkably, does not gain half
its humor from the character's sexism. The movie is a charming story of
the incongruity impossibility of childlike wonder in modern soci
ety. If you're looking for a truly old-school kid's movie, the ciaymation
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," featuring Burl Ives,cannot be beat.
Christmas movies are not all targeted at children, though. "White
Christmas,"a classic musical set in the post-war era, bursts with so much
singing and dancing talent, you'll be able to reminisce right along with
Grandma and Grandpa at dinner about the good old days of Hollywood.
"Love Actually" is a more contemporary choice, with the different love
interactions of many interconnected storylines weaving together a des
perately real and improbably uplifting tale.

If you don't feel like a feature-length film, the holidays always have an

excess of football to watch at any time: Thanksgiving week has con
ference championships and Winter Break is packed full of bowl j
games. There's nothing to take your mind off grades like kicking I
back and zoning out in front of the Startup.com Questionably-1
Themed-Name Bowl Game.

Sitcoms will be in good seasonal form as well. Watch the new I

episodes for some guaranteed gift-giving and party-related plot I

twists. You can also re-experience old favorites like the episode of I

"The Office" in which Michael brings an iPod to the gift swap and I

sulks at receiving a pot holder from Phyllis (Season 2. Episode 10) I
or the episode of Friends when Ross inexplicably dresses up as a I

"Holiday Armadillo" to explain Hanukkah to his son (Season 7.1
Episode 10).

Idea: Make festive treats

Everyone hates fruitcake, though most people have
probably never even tasted one. Don't attempt it.i
Some other holiday specialties, though delicious, are I
best left to the experienced boulanger, the Yule log or '
buche tie Noel being a good example of what to buy
rather than bake.

Remember that the trick of making a holiday goodie is to

give the most banal things a.soupam or spirit. Replace the chocolate
chips in a batch of cookies with red-and-green or blue-and-white M&Ms
— or even just throw some food coloring in scrambled eggs before you
serve them — but do something.
Secret tip: If you're genuinely lazy or culinarily challenged, "Stuff face
with holiday treats" is a simpler variant of this suggestion.
Idea: Drink holiday beverages
Festive limes call for festive measures, and nothing is more appropri
ate than an appropriate beverage. Throw medical caution to the wind and
make real eggnog, complete with risk of salmonella, or else smugly sip the
i 111 l



imitation version secure in relative
bacterial safety — just be sure to
sprinkle cinnamon on top.
Even sunny Stanford gets
nippy on winter nights, and the

steaming warmth of a winter drink is the perfect antidote to the chills. Hot
cocoa stirred with a candy cane is adorably yummy; hot cider also hits the spot
whether it is made by boiling real apples and cinnamon sticks or comes from

a paper packet of powder

For those who imbibe, you can turn these tasty drinks
into tasty grown-up drinks easily — just add a little

brandy, rum and vodka to the eggnog, pepper
mint Schnapps or Bailey's to the hot cocoa, and
put the hard back in cider (unless you barely
even know 'er. of course). Any of these will
taste unbelievably delicious after a long rut of
overpriced Cosmos or frat-provided beer.

If you've decked out your dorm with paper

accents, cooked up some fantastic sugar
based items, and prepared a kettleful of
cocoa, it sounds like you're all ready for the
next idea-

Idea: Throw a holiday party
At last, vou have somewhere

century. Don't forget to

hang a little mistletoe over the door
— it's a historically established fact
that no one standing under a sprig
of a parasitical plant will resist suc
cumbing to a smooch.

Idea: (live presents
This self-explanatory part of the holiday season makes even the most
diehard atheist retailers rejoice and has a surprisingly important effect on the
national economy. Even il you eschew crass commercialism, you can still

know you appreciate them. Don't forget to wrap them!
