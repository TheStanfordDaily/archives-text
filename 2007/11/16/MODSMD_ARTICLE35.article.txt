### BETSY WALLS INTERMISSION SEASONAL SPIRIT 
The holidays are a time of year uniquely lull of potential for time-wast
ing. You could choreograph a salacious dance with three of your friends
to "Jingle Bell Rock," but if you're not Lindsay Lohan in "Mean Girls,"
wouldn't you rather get festive in a more traditional way? If you feel like
your holiday season could use a few good shots of merry and a helping of
happy, try some of these classic activities.
Idea: Make decorations yourself
Remember the days when you could pin sequins onto a Styrofoam ball
and call it art? Reminisce no more — the holidays offer a perfect excuse
to embrace your inner kindergartener.
For Thanksgiving, fashion a paper turkey by tracing the outline of
your hand on a piece of paper and cutting it out, accessorizing with beak,
eyes, etc. Freshmen, try this one <jt home over Thanksgiving break and
watch your parents' eyes pop out of their heads when you tell them this is
what you've been learning at Stanford!
The later part of the holiday season has even greater opportunity for
arts and crafts of the elementary school variety. Paper (either I HUM or
PWR) chains can serve as garland on a tree or around a dorm room, and

popcorn strings arc easy if you've got a needle, thread and the willpow-

er not to cat all the popcorn. You can

make a plastic wreath by bending the
bottom part of a wire hanger into a cir-

wi cle and tying plain (non-Ziploc) plas-
I tic sandwich baggies around it —
LOTS of plastic baggies. There is also
the Holy Grail of easy Christmas decora
tions: the paper snowflake, which also for-

tunately works

fee through January as
r well, given its generic
"winter" quality. You

snowflakes much easier
than it was when you were
seven.
Hanging all of your hand
\ made creations is a must. You
get extra points if you deck the
halls while singing "Deck the
\ Halls," complete with the
correct number of fa's and
' la's.

Secret tip: When making

paper snowflakes, don't just fold a square a few
times. Cut out a paper circle first, then fold it and
make fearlessly large cuts along the folds.

Idea: Watch seasonal movies
A "( harlie Brown Christmas" overflows with iconic moments, includ
ing the beautifieation of the spindly Christmas tree due to some love and
attention from the children. If you've never seen it. watch it; if you have,
watch it again.
"Elf features Will Ferrell in a role that, remarkably, does not gain half
its humor from the character's sexism. The movie is a charming story of
the incongruity impossibility of childlike wonder in modern soci
ety. If you're looking for a truly old-school kid's movie, the ciaymation
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," featuring Burl Ives,cannot be beat.
Christmas movies are not all targeted at children, though. "White
Christmas,"a classic musical set in the post-war era, bursts with so much
singing and dancing talent, you'll be able to reminisce right along with
Grandma and Grandpa at dinner about the good old days of Hollywood.
"Love Actually" is a more contemporary choice, with the different love
interactions of many interconnected storylines weaving together a des
perately real and improbably uplifting tale.

If you don't feel like a feature-length film, the holidays always have an

excess of football to watch at any time: Thanksgiving week has con
ference championships and Winter Break is packed full of bowl j
games. There's nothing to take your mind off grades like kicking I
back and zoning out in front of the Startup.com Questionably-1
Themed-Name Bowl Game.

Sitcoms will be in good seasonal form as well. Watch the new I

episodes for some guaranteed gift-giving and party-related plot I

twists. You can also re-experience old favorites like the episode of I

"The Office" in which Michael brings an iPod to the gift swap and I

sulks at receiving a pot holder from Phyllis (Season 2. Episode 10) I
or the episode of Friends when Ross inexplicably dresses up as a I

"Holiday Armadillo" to explain Hanukkah to his son (Season 7.1
Episode 10).

Idea: Make festive treats

Everyone hates fruitcake, though most people have
probably never even tasted one. Don't attempt it.i
Some other holiday specialties, though delicious, are I
best left to the experienced boulanger, the Yule log or '
buche tie Noel being a good example of what to buy
rather than bake.

Remember that the trick of making a holiday goodie is to

give the most banal things a.soupam or spirit. Replace the chocolate
chips in a batch of cookies with red-and-green or blue-and-white M&Ms
— or even just throw some food coloring in scrambled eggs before you
serve them — but do something.
Secret tip: If you're genuinely lazy or culinarily challenged, "Stuff face
with holiday treats" is a simpler variant of this suggestion.
Idea: Drink holiday beverages
Festive limes call for festive measures, and nothing is more appropri
ate than an appropriate beverage. Throw medical caution to the wind and
make real eggnog, complete with risk of salmonella, or else smugly sip the
