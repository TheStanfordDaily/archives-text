## Scratch your musical itch 
### PAUL CRAFT KZSU JOLLY DISC JOCKEY 
The holiday season brings so many great sensations: the
warmth of a fire, the taste of hot cocoa, the smell of fresh cook
ies. But it also brings a downside: itchiness. Every November
ushers in a tidal wave of bright green sweaters and wool com
forters. In other words, it brings severe discomfort and gener
al unpleasantness. But this year can be different. We can rise
up against itchiness, and, instead, embrace our itch to live! We
can embrace our itch to be free! Our itch to sing out loud! Our
itch to dance uninhibitedly in public while shouting at people
as they walk by! Well, maybe we should skip the last idea.
Anyway, the point is this: while we may have negative hol
iday-related itches, we also have positive sorts of itches —
passions, urges, desires. Let's embrace our itches, our pas-

sions. and our spontaneous whims through music! Here
is a quick list of itches you might have, and the songs that

will scratch them:

The itch to dance about the house:

"Each Year (RAC Remix)" — Ra Ra Riot

This song is all emotional tension, mixing the sweet with
sour. Ra Ra Riot's original song was a 10-fi tangle of drums
and harmonics. The remix, though, adds significant heft to the
bass, uses the occasional laser noise and spins the drums into
a sputtering twirl. The result is a melancholy melody on top of

a killer dance groove. Sort of like the Junior Boys, ex-

cept with more bounce. It's a rare but beautiful

combination.

"I Am Not Going to Teach Your Boyfriend to

Dance with You" — Black Kids

While this band might have a stupid and only par-

tially accurate name, their song has all the right moves. ( Yeah,
I just used that pun. Deal with it.) Their debut E.P. is a high
energy mix of dance and new wave. The band manages to
squeeze muscular and memorable hooks out of well-worn ter
ritory. Black Kids build the tune around synths that sound like
horns, guitar echo and some of the strangest lyrics of the year.
Lead singer Reggie Youngblood — a man — sings,
"You/You are the girl/ That I've been dreaming of/Ever since
I was a little girl." Whatever you say, man. Though with a
catchy bassline and plenty of tambourine, he could say just
about anything and I'd listen.
The itch to be a German pre-teen girl:
Tokio Hotel
Tokio Hotel rocks... according to millions of German kids.
This band is a sensation across the pond. This is what emo has
come to: a bunch of well-scrubbed teens playing catchy but

generic and overwrought tunes about love. Tokio

Hotel, however, takes this movement to

a new level. They are the boy

band of emo. It's a
group of four 18-
year-olds keepin' it
real with Gods
mack guitars and
Simple Plan emo
tions. Most dis
turbingly, the lead
singer looks like
Icdusa after shopping
Hot Topic. He has a

big puff of skunk-striped hair and delicate features that look
like Avril Lavigne. Wait, is that Avril? The same music... the
same style... the same pretty features... Oh, whatever, it's too
close to call.
The iteh to contemplate your existence in a dimly-lit room:
"if Not Now Whenever" — The Books
The Books combine ambient instrumental and "found
sound" for atmospheric and cerebral effect. The Books select
small bits of audio, isolate them from their original source (a
movie, a television program, etc.) and create a new musical
context. The instrumental — cello, banjo, guitar and other
instruments — are minimalist and serve primarily to create a
mood, much like a movie soundtrack. The sound clips, mean
while, arc random and out-of-context, enhancing the mood

but containing no literal meaning. In this partic
ular song, "If Not Now Whenever," The Books

mix instruinentals, a bit of
breathy singing, and a flurry of
random clips. At one point, a
clip from an old movie says, "A

curse is a curse!" Then another

voice, "If you work hard someday,

my boy... you might become... women!"

Later, a voice says,"I can't find the books,
they must be in La Jolla," and somebody
responds "I worked for 46 hours...in a

row." Listening to The Books is like hav-

ing a dream: the individual elements
don't really make sense, but the overall

affect is still riveting.

The itch to take an epic nighttime car ride:

"Don't Save Us from the Flames" — MB3
This band records widescreen songs lush
with emotion. "Don't Save us From the
Flames" is the ultimate example. As soon you as
you press play, the drums kick in and so does the
epicness. The verse, then, builds tension
through minimalism. Backed only by repetitive
piano notes, MB3 sings in a hushed voice. It's
like a taut wire that suddenly snaps, bringing
forth a mesmerizing melody and a female voice
calling, "Tiinnnaaaaa." Seriously, if you're dri
ving fast at night, thinking about life, this is the
song for you.
The itch to chill out on the grass in the Califor
nia sun:
"West Coast" — Coconut Records
This is an earnest love letter to a special
someone and, as the title suggests, the
West Coast. If only "The 0.C." hadn't
been cancelled, they might have included
this on a soundtrack. Like any good Cali
fomia-themed song, this tune is heavily in
debted to The Beach Boys' harmonies and
written by Jason Schwartzman. That's
right: the former member of Phantom
Planet (The 0.C.-theme song band) and
star of Rushmore has some musical chops.
Like his other band, this piano line is pret
ty stellar, as is the space rock sound effect
that punctuates the song occasionally. The

final stretch is like a church choir belting out an anthem
to the gods of sunshine and surf.
The itch to be super British:
"Diamonds in the Dark" — Mystery Jets
They'rcj ust so quirky! Originating from the Eel Pie Island in Eng
land this band revels in their eccentricities—sort of like the British in
general. For instance, the drummer Ls the son of the guitarist. Also, the
lead singer was just 12 when the band started. This particular song se
lection is all over the place. It wafts softly in on piano then develops
into a chunky slice of Britpop. The Jets mournfully relive memories
of relationship bliss: meeting at the gates of the schoolyard (so
British), dreaming of living together on some quaint street (Delancy
Street), then regretfully drifting apart to "no-man's land." Sigh It's all
so dreamily British.
