### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION CONSCIENTIOUS CUDDLER 
A friend of Roxy's has found herself in a quandary.
She's seeing a funny, smart fella whose bed-side savvy
leaves her in shock and awe. Unfortunately, they haven't
had the sexual history conversation, she's not on the Pill
and three condoms have broken over the last few weeks.
Uh-oh is right.
This week, inspired by this friend, Roxy tackles the
technicals behind having responsible sex. The big points?
Harder said than done. And not to be done while hard.
First stop: getting over the "Arc you clean? Good, let's
bone" paradigm. Roxy knows that asking about your
partner's sexual health rates right up there with Dick Ch
eney on the Sexy Scale, but it's a conversation that's got to
happen — and should happen before the pants are off.
Once you're kicking off your skivvies, it's too late. 1
don't care what people argue, having an earnest conver
sation about sexual history and STD status isn't going to
happen between third base and home. Using sloshball as

a metaphor for sex. treat second base

as a pause-point. (Freshmen, ask

your RA to explain.) It's a lot eas
ier to be honest and thorough be
fore you get lost in the momen
tum of the moment.

But how to bring up the
topic and avoid awk-

wardness? Roxy

;
knows that it can
be really hard to
spit out the
words and get
the convo
rolling. I advise
to just embrace
the interperson
al discomfort.

r Some example
phrases to try are:
"Hold on a minute.

112 I feel sort of awk
ward bringing this up,
but when was the last
time that you were

tested for STDs? What were the results?" or "1 feel em
barrassed about this, but before things go any further, I

should let you know that I have HPV."
Only a true scoundrel would deceive you.

On the inverse, if you have an STD and

lie about it, your partner is very
likely to discover the truth even- 1
tually — and to be really pissed off
when that happens.

As an aside, Roxy actually is a
strong advocate of going to Vaden to-

gether to get tested and sharing your re
ports with each other. But she does real
ize that in the world of one-time hook-ups,

a 2 a.m. stop at Vaden on the way from 680
to Mirrielees isn't gonna happen. So just do
the best you can to get the information that

you need. "
Once you've opened the conversation, good
questions to ask are: How many partners have

you had? Did any of them have STDs, to your y
knowledge? Are you on any kind of birth control?
The point of all of this is to make sure that you

feel informed and comfortable, so there are no
"wrong" questions. Roxy recommcnds thinking of

things that you would like to know about your partners *
when you are bored in lecture or biking home or doing
something else that is completely unrelated to sex. This

way, you'll be prepared for the moment.
Moving on, let's assume that you've talked to your
mate, you feel comfortable with their responses, and
you've decided to slide into home. Two big points should
ALWAYS be covered.
Point 1: Use a condom/non-permeable barrier, even if
you're not having "traditional" intercourse. Roxy knew a
girl back home who'd have anal sex when there wasn't a
condom on hand. And that girl got herpes (which is sad).
And then she gave it to her partner's brother (which is
funny). Also, dental dams are damn worthless — they
just don't conduct heat very well. If you're going to go that
route, Saran Wrap is the way to go. (Thank you for the tip.
"The Guide to Getting It On"!)
Point 2: Make sure that you follow proper condom applica
tion. This means that you have checked the expiration date, not
put it on inside-out, pinched your finger over the reservoir tip
to keep air bubbles out and left a bit of rcxim at the head end so
that his soldiers aren't part of a forced evacuation. There has
been no double-bagging, which hurts more than it helps, in
many ways. And make sure that no one is using oil-based lube
or lotion, both of which eat through latex like gremlins.
OK, kids. Have fun at home over Thanksgiving, good
luck finding some hometown tail and remember to
be responsible!
