# CARDINAL RULE
## Stanford seeks dominion over Notre Dame 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After being bounced from bowl con
tention last week against Washington State,
Stanford football will look to refocus on a
pair of key rivalry games after a bye this
weekend.
But as students begin streaming back to
campus next weekend. Notre Dame will ar
rive for a showdown on Nov. 24. looking to
salvage an utterly disastrous season.
In his third season at the helm of the tra
ditional national powerhouse from South
Bend, Ind.,coach Charlie Weis' Notre Dame
squad has collapsed in epic fashion, going 1-
9 in what will be the school's worst finish
since at least 1963, when the Irish went 2-7.
Given the team's historic level of futility this
year, it's safe to say Irish eyes are no longer
smiling.

Notre Dame will he desperately looking
to get back on track this weekend against
Duke before traveling to Stanford to close
out its season.
"We've been there, you know, having a
struggling season like that, and 1 know their
backs [are] against the wall," said fifth year
senior wideout Mark Bradford. "Having a
season like that you're trying to scratch and
fight and do everything [you] can to win, and
we're the same way right now. So you're
going to see two teams [next Saturday] giv
ing it all they got."
As for Stanford's motivation following
the loss to the Cougars, which ensured yet
another losing season for the Cardinal, it
shouldn't be too hard for Jim Harbaugh's
team to get fired up for a final stretch that in
cludes a match-up with the Irish and a battle
for the Stanford Axe with rival Cal.
"It probably helps that it's probably two

of the most hated teams coming in here,"
said junior running back Anthony Kimble.
"That's definitely going to help the emotion
level."
And as for the bye week separating the
Cardinal from its post-Thanksgiving battle
for pride with the Irish, there are plenty on
Stanford's roster grateful for the chance to
heal.
"1 think [the bye-week] will help us most
ly by getting some guys healthy who are
banged up." Bradford said."Other than that,
this is a time where we can get plays in and
go back to the fundamentals and just shore
up the things that we know we can do."
Kimble, sixth-year senior center Tim Mat
tran, senior cornerback Nick Sanchez and
redshirt sophomore linebacker Clinton Sny
der should all be ready to go against Notre

NOTES: The Cardinal will have an extra week of
practice to gear up for the Fighting Irish, who
take on Duke tomorrow. Stanford has been un
able to topple Notre Dame since 2001, when
Kenneth Tolon rushed for 133 yards with a 7.4
yards per carry average and Stanford's pass de
fense held the Irish to just two completions. True
freshman Jimmy Clausen would appear likely to
start at quarterback next Saturday for Notre
Dame.

Dame after missing time in recent
weeks. Kimble's return in particular
could help to bolster a rushing attack
that has had to lean on freshmen like
fifth-stringer Tyrone McGraw and
converted cornerback Corey Gate
wood in recent weeks.
The Cardinal could also get soph
omore receiver Richard Sherman
back for next Saturday. Sherman
was forced to sit out the contest
against Washington State after he
was suspended by Harbaugh for a
televised sideline blow-up against
the Huskies two weeks ago. Al
though the talented wideout prac
ticed this week, Harbaugh stopped
short of confirming whether or not
Sherman would play against the
Irish.
"From the beginning, that's a
matter for the team and Richard
and myself," the Stanford coach told
the San Jose Mercury News. "Like
anybody on the team, what's re
quired of Richard is no more or no
less than anybody else in terms of
the standard of play that we're look
ing for and the attitude and the be
havior."
The Irish have struggled in all
phases of the game in 2007, and have
been outscored by an average of
17.6 points per game. Perhaps most
glaringly, though, on the ground,
Notre Dame has managed a paltry
1.6 yards per carry.Their opponents,
in contrast, are enjoying a robust
mark of 4.4.
Still, Kimble was adamant that
the Cardinal would be foolish to
take the Irish lightly.
"Notre Dame's always going to
be Notre Dame," Kimble said.
"They've had some shortcomings
this year, some almost games. But
they still have some great personnel
— they just haven't made it work
this year. So they're still a team
that's very capable of coming out
and putting up a good showing —
we've just got to come out, perform
and make plays when we have the
chance to."
Kickoff is scheduled for 12:30
p.m. PST on Nov. 24. The game will
be nationally televised on ESPN 2.
