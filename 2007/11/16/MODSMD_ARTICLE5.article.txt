ways know it's going to be hard.That's one thing that
is always consistent," said junior guard Anthony
Goods. "They put a run on us in the second half after
we got up. It was a tough game."

Sophomore center Robin Lopez added sizeable contributions at both ends of the court last night at Northwestern, chiming in with
16 points, five blocked shots and seven rebounds. But Cardinal coach Trent Johnson believes Lopez still has room to improve
"Let's don't get on the Robin
Lopez fan club," coach Trent Johnson
said. "His footwork looked good
today, but I've seen him for a year and
half and he's got a long way to go. I'd
like to see him be consistent from start
to finish."
"Last year I blocked quite a few
shots and I actually haven't had that
many come at me this year. You never
know," Lopez added. "Northwestern
was just really aggressive and there
were just a lot more opportunities."
The Cardinal utilized its huge size
advantage against the Wildcats. De
spite the fact that junior forward
Lawrence Hill left the game with 18:09
remaining after suffering a sprained
left ankle, Stanford still dominated the
boards 45-24.
Freshman point guard Michael
Thompson led Northwestern with 16
points, all in the second half.
"In the second half he just came
alive," Northwestern coach Bill Car

mody said of his freshman guard. "We
have to get the ball in his hands more
and let him make plays."
The seven-foot Lopez, who
demonstrated clever footwork in the
paint against Northwestern, will look
to continue dominating inside against
Siena. The Saints do not have a player
over 6-foot-9 on their roster.
Siena is a familiar non-conference
opponent for Stanford; the Cardinal is
2-1 against the Saints all time. John
son's squad beat Siena 92-72 in its sea
son opener last season, a game in
which Anthony Goods scored 30
points on a career-high seven three
pointers.
The Saints (1-2) are coming off an
88-66 victory over Dickinson in which
they forced 13 steals and 22 turnovers,
resulting in 26 points.
The Cardinal may be shorthanded
when they take on the Saints — Hill's
status for Saturday's game is currently
unknown.Tip-off for the Siena game is
set for 10:00 a.m. PST.
