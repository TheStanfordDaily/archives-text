## Levy probes Pakistan French journalist discusses involvement in Pearl's death 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
French journalist and philosopher
Bernard-Henri Levy, author of "Who Killed
Daniel Pearl?" spoke at Kresge Auditorium
last night for the second annual Daniel Pearl
Memorial Lecture. Levy spoke of his personal
investigation into Pearl's Feb. 1,2(K)2 murder
in Pakistan, as well as the changing role of pol
itics and religion in the current global arena.
Dipping into controversy at times. Levy ad
dressed the criticisms of his work, in particular
those regarding Pakistan.
"With the recent events in Pakistan and in
the global world," Levy said."l think the is
sues have been more than confirmed by the
actuality."
A bestselling author in Europe, Levy's
main arguments for the evening rested on the
belief that America's attitudes toward Al
Qaeda and Islamic radicalism were mis
aligned and that the Pakistani government
was indirectly linked to the murder of Pearl, a
Wall Street Journal reporter who was behead
ed in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.
"I strongly feel that America is making a
foolish mistake with the Iraq War." he said."lt
is based on a lie, and they went in without any
future planning. Ihe place where there are
weapons of mass destruction and the ideology
that goes with it — the fire to the weapons —
is not Iraq, but Pakistan.
"Iraq is not the place where the war should
have been launched," Levy added. "All efforts
should be concentrated on Pakistan."
Levy gave numerous examples for his ar
gument that the Pakistani government was in

explicably linked with Islamic terrorists.
"[Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf is
a sharp, intelligent individual who is playing
with the naivety of France's, Europe's and
America's diplomacy," he said.
Levy said Musharraf handed over Abu
Zubaydah. a high-ranking Al Qaeda official,
to the United States in 2002 shortly before a
series of vital negotiations between the U.S.
and Pakistan.
"Musharraf is sitting on a stock of terrorists
and we can compare him to the way traders
handle the stock exchange," he said. "He can
put a terrorist in the channel — in the Ameri
can, political, post 9/11 market — at his will."
Levy also argued that the jihadist threat in
Pakistan is not limited to tribal and remote
areas — places where Musharraf does not
have control.
"In my experience, unfortunately the red
areas are not at the margins, but at the very
center," Levy said."Terrorists and jihadists are
like fish in water in Islamabad and in Karachi
itself."
Levy justified his statement by citing his ex
perience in a Karachi madrasa, one which he
said was visited bv Pearl's murderer. Omar

Sheikh, and Osama bin Laden.
Levy also spoke on the philosophy of fun
damentalism, fascism and colonialism. He ar
gued that fundamentalism did not address the
problem of terrorism.
"I hypothesize as a philosopher that we
move from the concept of fundamentalism to
the concept of fascism and fasc-Islamism,"
Levy said.
"You can read the Our'an as much as you
want, but you will not find the nihilistic view of
life, love of martyrdom and hatred for Western
society that the terrorists preach," he added.
"However, the Our'an is different from the
other holy books in the sense that [it| is based
on conquest and the religion of state. Yet that
does not explain the jihadist philosophy."
Levy also said he was in favor of spreading
democracy to countries that lack it. In re
sponse to his critics who warn of the dangers
of spreading Western ideals toother countries,
I.evy brought up colonialism and slavery.
"Colonialists supported the defeat of uni
versality." he said. "They supported the idea of
many different kinds or species of people, with
many different cultures and values. It was only
the anti-colonialists that led the universality

movement. Their argument was that all hu
mans were on the same level and thus should
be treated equally."
Though his words were often controversial.
Levy said in an interview with The Daily that
he hoped his remarks and writings would not
cause race-related crimes.
"The majority of Pakistanis and Arabs I
have met in the U.S. do not have any problems
with democracy and the idea of change," Levy
added. "It is only those who hold irrational
views that I have a problem with. It has noth
ing to do with race or ethnicity, and 1 strongly
hope that it does not encourage race-related
crimes."
A number of attendees spoke apprecia
tively of the intellectual nature of Levy's lec
ture, which offered a different perspective on
terrorism.
"1 think it was a great lecture" said San
Jose resident Aaron Khan. "Very eye-open
ing."
Others, however, disagreed with Levy and
his arguments.
"The talk was borderline racist," said Jeff

democracy to countries that lack it. In re
sponse to his critics who warn of the dangers
of spreading Western ideals toother countries,

"Colonialists supported the defeat of uni
versality." he said. "They supported the idea of
many different kinds or species of people, with
many different cultures and values. It was only
the anti-colonialists that led the universality

movement. Their argument was that all hu
mans were on the same level and thus should
be treated equally."
Though his words were often controversial.
Levy said in an interview with The Daily that
he hoped his remarks and writings would not
cause race-related crimes.
"The majority of Pakistanis and Arabs I
have met in the U.S. do not have any problems

hope that it does not encourage race-related
crimes."

"The direct attacks on Musharraf
and Pakistan were unnecessary,"
agreed Thomas Dußois, also from
Palo Alto. "It breeds hatred and neg
atively affects race relations. While I
understand that this is a sensitive

issue, perhaps Levy should have
been more sensitive in his discus
sion."
The event was sponsored by the
