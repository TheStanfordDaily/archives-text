## Developers unveil plans for luxury hotel on Univ. land 
### NICOLE PERLROTH 
After years of planning and community
outreach, Stanford and Dallas-based Rose
wood Hotels and Resorts unveiled the sign last
night for a brand new nearby property: Ibe
Rosewood Sand Hill Hotel, which will be lo
cated near the intersection of Sand Hill Road
and Interstate 280.
While there are no flashing "vacancy" lights
to be seen yet. yesterday's unveiling marked
the 21-acre site of the 121-room luxury hotel
and spa. which is to include five extended-stay
villas, a restaurant, health spa and over 8.000
square feet of meeting space.
Bob Reidy, Stanford's vice president of
land, buildings and real estate, joined Rose
wood president John Scott and Menlo Park
Mayor Kelly Fergusson in showcasing the site
to a group of local Menlo Park residents as well

as Stanford and Rosewood officials.
"Stanford has long been interested in pro
viding top-tier accommodations to the many
visitors to the University and to the region."
Reidy said. "We couldn't be more pleased to
have Rosewood as a partner in developing and
managing Rosewood Sand I lill"
Ilie luxury hotel and spa, which lies just one
mile west of campus, will cater primarily to the
Sand I lill venture capital market and is expect
ed to deliver significant economic returns to
both the University and the city of Menlo Park.
" Ilie hotel benefits everyone." said Melody
Pagee, a member of Menlo Park's Planning
Commission. "Stanford will benefit from its
lease rate and Menlo Park will benefit from the
hotel occupancy tax revenue, which is expect
ed to be significant."
Ilie city of Menlo Park levies a 10 percent
occupancy tax on hotel rooms. At that rate, a

hotel of Rosewood's high-end caliber and size
is estimated to generate approximately $1.3
million dollars annually for the city's general
fund.
Despite the clear boon to city coffers, some
local residents expressed initial concerns that
the hotel would increase traffic congestion and
impose an eye-sore on what was previously
open space.
But according to former Menlo Park City
Councilwoman Mickie Winkler, those issues
have since been put to bed in the hotel's care
ful planning and design.
"The community is very supportive of the
final design, and 1 actually think the traffic will
improve as a result [of the hotel]," Winkler
said, alluding to a new plan that will alter the
off-ramp connecting Interstate 280 and com
muter-heavy Sand Hill Road in order to miti
gate congestion.

Scott emphasized that community concerns
figured prominently into Rosewood s decision
to use local. Palo Alto-based developer HKS
Mill Glazier Studios for the hotel's building
and design.
"Each of our hotels has a strong sense of
place," Scott said. "Our goal in developing a
low-rise, campus-style design was to incorpo
rate the beautiful natural landscape that sur
rounds campus and is so much a part of the
Stanford experience.
"We were sensitive to involving the com
munity," he added. "We asked local residents.
What is it you want out of this project?" Over
whelmingly, their reply is now, 'When can we
start eating at your restaurant?' Now, the an
swer is 'soon enough.'"
