## FLiCKs changes leadership Dec. 2 return still expected for tradition 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
Fans of throwing paper airplanes at
movie stars are keeping their fingers
crossed for FLiCKs. After experienc
ing organizational and technical trou
ble earlier this quarter, the movie
screening organization faces yet an
other obstacle.
Ongoing sound system issues
caused the weekly program to cancel
its November screenings following a
problematic showing of " r llie Bourne
Ultimatum" on Oct. 14. As the pro
gram attempts to meet its stated goal
of a Dec. 2 re-launch, one that would
coincide with Big Game weekend, it
will also be handling a change in lead
ership.
Citing excessive time demands and
a need to focus on schoolwork,
FLiC Ks director Mathew Crichton 10
announced that he will be stepping
down at the end of this quarter. Filling
Crichton's position will be current as
sociate director Kyle Evaldez '09.
"1 was spending four to six hours a
day [on FLiCKs] some days early in
the quarter," said Crichton, who an
nounced his decision to FLiCKs man
agement last week. "After four weeks,
that's a lot of time."
Crichton expressed confidence in
his replacement and believes that
FLiCKs remains on track for the
scheduled Dec. 2 return.
"I've been training Kyle since he
got on, helping teach him how FLiCKs
works," Crichton said. "He knows his
stuff."
FLiCKs marketing executive Lau
ren Rosas '09 has also been involved in
planning the re-launch and agrees that
Evaldez will steer the program in the
right direction.
"The transition from the current
director to the new director should be
pretty smooth," she said. "Matt and
Kyle have been working very closely
this quarter, so I'm pretty confident
that Kyle is well-trained for the job."
Evaldez himself said the news that
Crichton would be leaving came as a
surprise, but he feels prepared and
hopes to get FLiCKs back to normal
by Winter Quarter.
"I just want FLiCKs to be stable,"
he said."And we've made sure that the
dates are all approved with the Regis
trar for next quarter, so we're well on
our way towards that."
On the agenda for stabilizing the
program is resolving the broken
sound system in Memorial Auditori
um.
"It's tough to find people experi
enced with the system â€” it's been
around so long," Crichton said. "I'm
not sure that anyone on campus
knows how the whole system works."
Adding to FLiCKs' trouble was
the issue of paying for inspections and
repairs to the new system, as well as
scheduling difficulties related to space
and time needs for theatrical produc
tions.
Weeks before his exit, though,
Crichton added that FLiCKs will
need more than just repairs: if it is to
succeed in future quarters, he said,
the program will need innovation as
well.
"1 believe that we should consider
changing the traditional time for
screenings from Sunday to Friday,"
he said. "We did a big student survey,
and we found a lot of support for the
idea. If you move one or both of the
Sunday showings to Friday, FLiCKs
could be positioned as an option for
people who don't want to go to a frat

party.
Crichton also expressed hope for an
improved integration of FLiCKs into
the student body.
"I really want to have FLiCKs
work with, rather than against, other
film and arts groups on campus," he
said. "That's something 1 really hope
can happen for the program if we can
get the Registrar to improve its
scheduling process and get more co
operation.
"FLiCKs is important to the stu
dent body as a whole," Crichton
added. "I'd love to see the student
community get involved and make it
as good a program as it can be."
Both Crichton and Evaldez un
derstand the importance of keeping
the 50-year tradition of FLiCKs alive
and the work it will take to make this
happen.
"It's nerve-wracking to be thrown
in there," Fvaldez said. "But whatev
er I can do to help, I'll do it,and I'll be
excited. I love FLiCKs."
