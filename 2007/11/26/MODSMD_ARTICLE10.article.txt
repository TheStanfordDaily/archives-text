# From the army to the Farm
## Students describe mandatory military service experiences 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA 
Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to serve in the army
right after high school? Ask some
of the students on campus! Students
from countries such as Singapore and Is
rael served in the army for their countries
before coming to Stanford for their un
dergraduate education.
Israel has a universal draft — national
military service is compulsory for Jewish
men and women over the age of 18. As
for Singapore, all men who have reached
18 years of age need to enlist in the army
and are not allowed to defer for educa
tional reasons.
Singaporean men and Israeli women
spend two years in the army, while Israeli
men complete three years of service.
Most students who come to Stanford
after the army take a few months off be
fore college, as the transition requires a
change in focus from military duties to
academics.
Students said that the culture shock
did not come from switching from the
army to college, but rather from the cul
tural differences they experienced upon
living in a new country.
Orly Deri, who now serves on the Hil
lel staff, served in the Israeli Defense
Forces for three years. She was a soldier
and later a commander in a unit that was
responsible for training the infantry re
serve units.
Deri said that her military service was

"a crucial part of [her] development as an
Israeli citizen and as a person." Not only
did she spend time studying about Israeli
history in the army, but she also learned
to be mature, responsible and independ
ent.
"In the army I learned how to use all
hours of the day, so when I was a student
it was easy for me to plan my time cor
rectly and accomplish all that I had set
out to do," she said. "Military service
teaches you to establish deeper relation
ships. and this is something that extends
beyond the service itself and into life af
terwards."
Deri added that compulsory military
service is critical for the survival of a
country like Israel, which is surrounded
by enemies.
Like Deri, Atalya Ben-Haim '11 felt
her time in the army helped her become
more mature and form deep, meaningful
relationships.
Ben-I I aim took two years off between
her service and Stanford. ITius. she did
not feel her experience at Stanford was
particularly impacted by her time in the
army.
"Even though I had to serve from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m.. I had a lot of choice in what
I wanted to pursue during my service, as
long as I completed certain required
tasks," Ben-I laim said, adding that these
choices are comparable to the choices
she has at Stanford.

She said she finds her ex
perience at Stanford similar
to the army. In the army,
Ben-Haim said, she met peo-

ple with different socioeco
nomic backgrounds from all

over Israel, and at Stanford,
she has met people from all
over the world.

A student who served in the

Singapore Armed Forces before
coming to Stanford said his tran
sition was pretty smooth "be-

cause Stanford is such a

great place."
The student, who
wished to remain
anonymous because of
the secretive nature of
Singaporean military
service, said his army
schedule was very
strictly regimented,
and authorities were '
particular about
punctuality and disci
pline.
"In comparison,
Stanford is like a holi
day resort!" he said.
"You get to do what you
want when you want."
