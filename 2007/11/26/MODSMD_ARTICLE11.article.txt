# Exhibit explores political, sexual power
## Intermission presents 
### NICOLE DEMBY 
From the time of Manifest Des
tiny and Indian removal to our
current military endeavors
overseas, American power has pene
trated regions and peoples all over
the world. Culturally, we have
spread our McDonald's seed to the
far reaches of the globe. The new ex
hibit by Justine Lai 'OH, "Join or
Die," a series of paintings in which
Lai depicts herself having sex with
various American presidents, raises
an interesting question: what are the

implications of seeing the man who
wields the world's largest
metaphorical cock in the act of
using his real one?
A glance at the narrative of
American history demonstrates to
what extent this country mytholo
gizes its forefathers, those impecca
bly moral men in tights who made
this great nation into the flawless
beacon of capitalism and democracy
it is today. II your education was any
thing like mine, by high school you
were fortunate enough to have some
half-crazy red-diaper baby history
teacher who takes it upon himself to
systematically undo all the lies
you've been told about American
history.
All of a sudden, you're faced with
the shocking truth: These gods, these
declaration-signers and cherry tree
choppers and slavery-haters, were
real human beings. If they commit
ted sexual indiscretions, if they had
personal biases, if they did things
more to suit private interests than to
satisfy any rhetoric about truth, lib
erty and freedom, then they must
have pissed and shat — and even
fucked — just like the rest of us.
flie connection between sexual
power and political power has been
unambiguous throughout history.
For example, King Solomon had
I.fKK) wives from all different na
tions as a diplomatic strategy, and re
searchers have found that eight per

cent of men in

Asia are de-

scended from
Genghis
Khan.

Yet the
feelings in
voked by
Lai's work
suggest that
in the United
States, this

relationship is

not quite so
simple. The title
of the exhibit.

"Join or Die,"
refers to the

Benjamin
Franklin cartoon

painted on the
wall of the

gallery. The
cartoon

depicts a serpent, chopped and seg
mented into different pieces, signify
ing the separate colonies Franklin
believed needed to band together to
face the threat of the French and the
Native Americans. The phallic
image also serves as a wonderful
double entendre, suggesting that the
effect of seeing an image of the
Commander-in-Chief in the midst of
having sex is actually emasculating.
Lai's work makes this paradox ex
plicit. and. in doing so, reveals some
thing profound about the personali

ty of this country.

neous obses

striking aspect of
the paintings is
their incredible
sense of intima
cy. Lai lovingly

renders the
flesh of her
figures, in
cluding her

own. Large, dy
namic splotches of purple and pink
capture the act of sex in a way that is
more beautiful than it is crude. Lai's
treatment of these moments actual
ly serves to animate its presidential
subjects more than any staid portrait
in history books. When Washington
grabs 1 .ai's ass. the suppleness of her
flesh is so palpable and his face is so
sweet that, despite its ridiculous
premise, the moment feels entirely
plausible. The way the images are
painted makes a concept that could
have been one-dimensional nu
anced and complex.
The implications of an Asian-
American young woman painting
herself having sex with the white,
gray-haired presidents of the United
States begs very human questions in
addition to the most obvious politi
cal ones. That said, the sexual dy
namics in the images carry in

evitable political implications. What
is interesting is that the paintings use
race and gender in a way that actual
ly empowers Lai. Sexually. Lai is
often on top or being pleasured. In
one particularly strong painting, she
gazes directly at the viewer and
seems to dare him or her to judge
her. She's not necessarily fully in
control in the images, yet the rela
tionship between her and her lovers
is definitely not as clear as that of
dominated and doniinator. The
equal opportunity sex Lai depicts
suggests egalitarianism in bed that
has been lacking culturally and po
litically for most (if not all) of Amer
ican history.
Racially, the bigoted notion that
all Asians look the same is reversed
here as the sequential images of
America's first presidents suggest
that maybe it's all dead white men
who look the same. It is a tribute to
the work,however, that many differ
ent. often contradictory messages
can be gleaned from the paintings. It
is hard to create art that avoids over
simplifying the issues touched on in
"Join or Die." In contrast to the ele
gant ambiguity of the political and
cultural content of the work, the

statement, seem somewhat naOve.

namic splotches of purple and pink
capture the act of sex in a way that is
more beautiful than it is crude. Lai's
treatment of these moments actual
ly serves to animate its presidential
subjects more than any staid portrait
in history books. When Washington
grabs 1 .ai's ass. the suppleness of her
flesh is so palpable and his face is so
sweet that, despite its ridiculous
premise, the moment feels entirely
plausible. The way the images are
painted makes a concept that could
have been one-dimensional nu
anced and complex.
The implications of an Asian-
American young woman painting
herself having sex with the white,
gray-haired presidents of the United
States begs very human questions in
addition to the most obvious politi
cal ones. That said, the sexual dy
namics in the images carry in

evitable political implications. What
is interesting is that the paintings use
race and gender in a way that actual
ly empowers Lai. Sexually. Lai is
often on top or being pleasured. In
one particularly strong painting, she
gazes directly at the viewer and
seems to dare him or her to judge
her. She's not necessarily fully in
control in the images, yet the rela
tionship between her and her lovers
is definitely not as clear as that of
dominated and doniinator. The
equal opportunity sex Lai depicts
suggests egalitarianism in bed that
has been lacking culturally and po
litically for most (if not all) of Amer
ican history.
Racially, the bigoted notion that
all Asians look the same is reversed
here as the sequential images of
America's first presidents suggest
that maybe it's all dead white men
who look the same. It is a tribute to
the work,however, that many differ
ent. often contradictory messages
can be gleaned from the paintings. It
is hard to create art that avoids over
simplifying the issues touched on in
"Join or Die." In contrast to the ele
gant ambiguity of the political and
cultural content of the work, the
artist's apprehensions about expos
ing herself, expressed in her artist
statement, seem somewhat naOve.
more the concern of Lai the student
than the artist.The work transcends
the realm of shock-value student art
and renders questions of gratuitous
exhibitionism or opportunism irrel
evant.
The exhibit will be shown in the
subgallery (the Art Gallery base
ment) through Nov. 28.
