## Electric cars roll out 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law alumnus Miles Rubin has
amassed enough money as a lawyer and business
leader to retire more than comfortably, but the 78-
year-old multi-millionaire has delayed retirement
to pursue his dream of changing the world â€” one
automobile at a time.
Rubin B.A. '50. J.D. '52, who amassed his for
tune as a lawyer, a businessman trading Chinese
products and director of several companies,
founded Miles Automotive Group (MAG) in 2004
with the goal of reducing carbon emissions and
pollution by building electric-powered cars.
He sees the electric car, a long-held dream
among environmentalists and the fuel-conscious,
as an important part of a solution to the world's
dependence on gasoline.
"We have to do something now to save the en
vironment and improve political and economic
problems related to petrol," Rubin said. "I hope
the time hasn't passed by to make a dramatic
change on how we handle our transportation
problems throughout the world. The electric car
can and will be an important part of the future."
Rubin explained that his interest in electric ve
hicles stemmed from his involvement in the ener
gy crisis in the l l )70s, when he worked with actor
Paul Newman to lobby Congress for support for
electric cars.
"When the price of gasoline went down, people
and the federal government lost interest," Rubin
said. "Their good intentions just drifted away with
the wind."
Three decades later. Rubin is pursuing his

dream. He said he has
spent well over $25 million

of his personal fortune on

MAG's research and development

The effort has already met with limited success.
MAG has sold low-speed electric vehicles, which
can charge from any wall outlet, to a number of in-

stitutions, including UCLA and NASA.
"Especially in fleet markets, there is a large
usage of internal combustion vehicles doing roles
that can easily be done by electric vehicles," Rubin
said. "Many universities pledge to become carbon
neutral and have signed sustainability pledges but
are still using low mileage, internal combustion ve
hicles and spew hydrocarbons out on their own
campuses."
Rubin's alma mater has also purchased one of
his creations.
"The Miles car has been a great addition for
us." said Frank Brucato, senior associate dean of
administration at the Law School. "One of the
great features of the car is the versatility. It meets
all of our needs. Unlike some we have had in the
past, it looks more like a car and has doors and
locks, which are needed."
But Rubin's ambitions do not stop with selling
low-speed electric vehicles to institutional fleets.
He also plans to roll out a highway-speed electric
car in 200 1 ). which he hopes will primarily target
the consumer market.
Electric vehicles produce zero emissions, re
ducing their drivers' carbon footprint. However,
they are not entirely carbon-neutral since the pro
duction of electricity still affects the environment.
"Eighty-five to 90 percent of all electricity
could be produced cleanly if an emphasis lis

such as wind, nuclear The s,an,ord Daily
and solar power," Rubin said. "Apart from that,
there is also the option of burning coal more clean
ly. Examples would include carbon sequestration
and carbon capture methods."
I le added that even if no action is taken to pro
duce cleaner electricity, electric vehicles still pro
duce less pollution than internal combustion vehi
cle's.
Although MAG is a pioneer in the electric ve
hicle industry, Rubin explained that he does not
mind competition and wants other vehicle manu
facturers to take note of his efforts.
"Nothing would make me happier than major
car companies switching a large part of their prod
ucts to all electric," he said. "If they do. 1 will feel
like 1 have completed my goal."
Rubin's philanthropic vision extends beyond
electric vehicles. Along with his wife, Nancy, he
founded and funds the Law School's Loan Repay
ment Assistance Program (LRAP) to encourage
more students to go into the public service sector.
Under the program, graduates receive loan repay
ment assistance for up to 10 years based on their
income and the number of years they remain in
public interest law. For those graduates who re-
