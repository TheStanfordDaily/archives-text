## New search engine for scientific papers 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
In the world of online scientific research, Web
giants Google and Wikipedia may not be ideal
places to begin, according to Helen Josephine, head
librarian of the Engineering 1 library. Josephine is
trying to spread the word about Scitopia.org, a new
federated search engine that gathers its informa
tion from more than three million scholarly and
government documents.
"The main feature that makes [Scitopia] unique
is that it searches a very focused set of documents

from professional societies," Josephine said.
A search by keyword can pull results from any
number of the 15 scientific societies that participate
with Scitopia. The chronological range for materi
als searched extends from 1874 to the present.
The remaining content searched by Scitopia in
cludes patents from U.S., Japanese and European
patent offices, as well as documents from the U.S.
Department of Energy.
"It's quite an interesting package of informa
tion," Josephine said. "Since it searches across
many disciplines at the same time, it helps students
find thinus that are being discovered or talked

about in other fields that they might not necessari
ly think about."
The librarian noted that because the University
is licensed with many of the societies searched
through Scitopia, students can avoid the pay-per
view option that arises when viewing certain docu
ments. By using Scitopia via a Stanford I.P. address,
access to most documents is unimpeded.
Josephine also said that Stanford was quick in li
censing with the professional societies through Sci
topia.
"We're kind of an early adopter of
it," she said. "We're one of the first
schools to really try to roll it out."
The site, which was launched in
June, offers both a simple and ad
vanced search interface. The former
provides a single basic search window
that searches by keyword, and the lat
ter a choice of multiple search fields
such as title, author, abstract and affili
ation.

Despite Scitopia's utility,outside re
views of the site did turn up some
shortcomings.
In a review published by The
Charleston Advisor last month. Yale
University librarian Joseph Murphy
gave Scitopia a composite score of 3.25
stars out of a possible five.
"The lack of further Advanced
Search options, assumedly stemming
from the complexities of federated
searching, weakens my satisfaction
with the search interface," Murphy
wrote in the review.
I ie also pointed out that the site
omits important scholarly societies, in
cluding the American Astronomical

Society, the American Chemical Soci
ety, the American Mathematical Soci
ety and the Royal Society of Chem
istry.
Overall, however. Murphy re
mained optimistic.
"Despite the weaknesses men
tioned in this [review], it is a tool many
institutions will find useful if they do
not desire comprehensive searching of
the literature." he said. "The respon
siveness of Scitopia's creators gives
reason to believe that it will continue to
be improved."
