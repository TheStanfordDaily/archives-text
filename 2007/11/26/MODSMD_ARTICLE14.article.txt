## New search engine for scientific papers 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
In the world of online scientific research, Web
giants Google and Wikipedia may not be ideal
places to begin, according to Helen Josephine, head
librarian of the Engineering 1 library. Josephine is
trying to spread the word about Scitopia.org, a new
federated search engine that gathers its informa
tion from more than three million scholarly and
government documents.
"The main feature that makes [Scitopia] unique
is that it searches a very focused set of documents

from professional societies," Josephine said.
A search by keyword can pull results from any
number of the 15 scientific societies that participate
with Scitopia. The chronological range for materi
als searched extends from 1874 to the present.
The remaining content searched by Scitopia in
cludes patents from U.S., Japanese and European
patent offices, as well as documents from the U.S.
Department of Energy.
"It's quite an interesting package of informa
tion," Josephine said. "Since it searches across
many disciplines at the same time, it helps students
find thinus that are being discovered or talked

about in other fields that they might not necessari
ly think about."
The librarian noted that because the University
is licensed with many of the societies searched
through Scitopia, students can avoid the pay-per
view option that arises when viewing certain docu
ments. By using Scitopia via a Stanford I.P. address,
access to most documents is unimpeded.
Josephine also said that Stanford was quick in li
censing with the professional societies through Sci
topia.
