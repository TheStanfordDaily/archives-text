## Editorial Board Going with the grain: Free Rice, free conscience, freedom from hunger 
### 
A curious, new, and thoroughly addic
tive game has seized the nation.
Somehow, this one is all of the above,
as well as educational and dedicated to a
good cause. Freeßice (www.freerice.com) is
a vocabulary-building game that asks users
to define words, but with each correct defi
nition.the United Nation's World Food Pro
gramme donates 10 grains of rice to feed the
starving. Hie cost of the rice is borne by the
major brand-name advertisers — Toshiba.
Radisson. Liz Claiborne and i'lunes. to
name a few — who pledge to pay for the
amount of rice generated by the game's
users.
The game features a word with four def
initions listed below. Clicking on the correct
definition adds a few grains of rice to the
graphic of a howl on the right of the screen.
The words range from the elementary to the
recherche, and the program automatically
adjusts its difficulty to challenge your vo
cabulary. Small ads at the bottom of the
screen fund the rice donations, and a page
keeps track of each day's total grain count
and the overall total raised.
Launched on Oct. 7, Freeßice is the
brainchild of John Breen. a computer pro
grammer from Bloomington, Ind., and the
creator of thehungersite.com and
Poverty.com. Breen entered all of the 10,000
definitions himself, reputedly after watching
his son study for the SAT.
What a perfect situation. Or, as
Freeßice would have it. a paradisiacal
one. What do half of the country's high
schoolers spend their time on anyway?
Studying for the SAT — namely, cram
ming vocabulary lor the daunting verbal
section. Most students here, perhaps, de
voted themselves to this exercise with
equal parts vigor and nausea.
It takes roughly 20.000 grains of rice to
provide the necessary calories to sustain an
adult for a single day. Disregarding the ap
proximately three-second delay to refresh
words, a single student could feed one per
son for one day with only 33 hours and 20
minutes of studying. That might seem like a

lot. but it's a safe assumption that there are
plenty of neurotic high school students who
devote even more time than that in attempts
to boost their verbal scores.
But Freeßice is for everyone, not just
those cramming for a meaningless test. It re
ally is fun and addictive, and building vocab
ulary while indirectly helping alleviate
hunger is as fulfilling as a bowl of rice is to a
hungry child. About 25,000 people, mostly
children, die of hunger every day. As of Nov.
24. a month and a half after Freeßice was
launched. 3.664.079.450 grains had been do
nated/limit's enough to feed nearly 185.000
adults for a day.
Some clever users have utilized their
programming skills to write 24-hour scripts
that automatically play Freeßice,greatly in
creasing the amount of rice donated. The
latest generation boasts dictionary databas
es and word dumps that remember correct
definitions and. therefore, become continu
ally "smarter.'"lliese"ricebots" are current
ly still permitted and can feed an estimated
eight people per day.
C liven the corporate sponsorships, some
have debated the legitimacy of the program
and questioned whether the whole thing is a
money-making scam, since the site's Cost
Per Action ads most likely bring in signifi
cant profits.The Web site does state that the
site makes no money off of Freeßice. One
blogger calculated that at 10 grains per click,
29.000 grains of rice per pound and good
rice costing 70 cents, Freeßice donates
somewhere around 20 cents for every 1.000
clicks. Nonetheless, the UN's World Food
Programme Web site proudly acknowledges
its connection to Freeßice.
As well it should. Freeßice is the very
kind of technologically innovative and so
cially conscientious endeavor that Stanford
students have long sought. Breen profits
while improving the world, and his entre
preneurship and ingenuity deserve our re
spect and reward. So put down this newspa
per and put those stratospheric verbal SAT
scores to work — it's time to save the world,
one grain at a time!
