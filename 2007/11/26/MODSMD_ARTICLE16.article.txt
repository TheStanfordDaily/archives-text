# Students Illustrated
## Facing faith 
### 
One of the first things I noticed about
Jane was her warmth. As we sat in the
RA training room together dis
cussing topics ranging from roommate con
flicts to eating disorders, 1 could tell that not
only did she care about these problems, but
she cared about the people behind these is
sues. I not to know Jane better, and I learned
that her warmth ;ind care for others define
her; they encompass not only her residents
and friends, but also a passionate love for
Ciod and her religion.
Jane's religious experience at Stanford
has been a happy one. Upon arrival, she
quickly found a religious community in the
Stanford student group for members of the
Church of Latter-Day Saints. Her friends
speak up for her when facing conflicts be
tween college culture and the practices of
the LDS. Without uttering a word, beer and
shots are replaced with milk, and R-rated
movies are bypassed in favor of films
deemed less inappropriate by the Motion
Picture Association of America.
Although she was happy, during her
sophomore year Jane felt she was straying
from her longstanding dedication to spiritu
al growth due to the frenetic and often dis
tracting Stanford lifestyle. As a very direct
solution, Jane opted tospend her junior year
at Brigham Young University to refocus her
energies on personal and spiritual develop
ment.
Jane isn't alone in questioning the role of
her faith upon entering college. Many of my
friends experienced either a phase of reli
gious confusion or abandoned their previ
ously held beliefs while transitioning to col
lege life.
Stanford's unique residential structure
adds to the difficulty of maintaining reli
gious steadfastness. Many people begin and
practice within the confines of their family
and their home. However, as all freshmen
are forced to live in dormitories, students
are forced to maintain their faith independ
ently of their family. Some students face the
possibility of sharing a room with a room
mate holding differing beliefs. While Jane's
roommate experience was positive and
they learned from each other, I remember a
mismatched pairing in my own freshman
dorm. One girl was outspokenly offended
by her roommate's Catholic paraphernalia
(whether it was used to decorate, practice
or maybe just to make herself feel at
home).
Integrating religious community into

the larger Stanford environment also pres
ents a challenge. In my own dorm, when a
student requested to use the lounge for a
Bible study, as a staff we had to debate
about whether or not the other residents
would feel comfortable with their public
space being used for the discussion of be
liefs that were not their own. Conversely,
we also had to ensure that the requesting
student still felt comfortable with her faith
while in her new home. Because of these
reasons, and possibly others, Jane acknowl
edges the difficulty of finding spaces for re
ligious activity, including the Latter-Day
Saints Students Association's weekly meet
ings (although she is thankful for Casa Za
pata's generosity).
Creating an inclusive and comfortable
residence also brings dormitory religious re
cruiting into question. My resident staff had
to request that religious groups stop going
door-to-door to recruit believers because
some students expressed discomfort. How
ever, no one complained when Dance
Marathon recruited door-to-door. The dif
ference between these two types of recruit
ment may seem extremely apparent to some
readers, but it needs to be acknowledged
that these groups are both student-run or
ganizations sanctioned by the OSA and
must abide by the same rules. However,
since one organization supports organized
religion and the other supports saving the
lives of children in Africa from AIDS, the
two are treated very differently.
Itie discomfort some students feel re
garding religious recruiting on their
doorstep may be a gut reaction to past neg
ative experiences involving differences of
spirituality. I myself am wary of those wish
ing to spread their faith because of times
when I was told I was going to Hell because
I hadn't accepted Jesus Christ as my per
sonal savior. However, after talking to
Jane, I realize that my discomfort stems
from my reaction toward the person carry
ing the message, rather than the message it-


Laura
Holmes
self. She acknowledges that there
are many people, of all religions,
who attempt to win converts sim
ply for the thrill of debate and
proving that their philosophy is
more correct. Jane's own message
of faith remains one that reflects
who she is: She shares her faith out
of care and love. When she sees her
friends upset, she offers her own
experience as an avenue to provide
happiness and strength in order to
help. Both motivations may drive
the religious recruiting that walks
the halls at Stanford, but under
standing the individuals and their
motives for sharing their beliefs is
necessary in order for religion to
reside comfortably on any campus.
After spending a year away
from Stanford. Jane returned from
BYU with a renewed sense of her
religious strength. And although
Jane recognizes the challenges that
Stanford life poses to her religious
convictions, Jane is happy because
she knows that if she wants to
make her religion a part of her life,
she will.
