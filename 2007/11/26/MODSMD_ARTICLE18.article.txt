## Web comments embarrass The Daily 
### 
When 1 read an interesting or
provocative article in The Daily, I
often head to the paper's Web site
to check out the comments posted online by
Web readers. Reading the comments can
help give a sense of where students stand on
divisive issues. Often, they present important
perspectives or facts not mentioned in the
story
Unfortunately, though, the current com
ment system has serious and inexcusable
flaws. Far too many of the comments are
patently offensive and inappropriate. Some
are nothing more than spam. There are few
mechanisms in place to prevent posters from
misrepresenting themselves or presenting in
correct facts. Even many of the less egregious
comments contribute little or nothing.
Viewers can comment on any article that
appears on The Daily's Web site. To post a
comment, all that is required is a name and
an email address, which can be easily faked
(the name is published along with the com
ment, but the email address is not). Posters
are instructed to "keep discussion civil, and
refrain from using profanity, personal at
tacks, potentially libelous language, or hate
speech." But The Daily declares that that it is
"not responsible for monitoring the board or
removing comments that could be in viola
tion of the policy." Once the comment is sub
mitted, it is published immediately and auto
matically on the Web site, below the article.
Next to every comment published on the

Web site are buttons for viewers to report the
comment as either spam or offensive. If an
item gets flagged 10 times in either category,
an email is sent to the appropriate managing
editor, who then determines whether the
comment should be removed, "veering on
the side of maintaining discourse," says Web
Editor James Hohmann '09. (Hohmann
points out that removing one comment after
the fact can be difficult, since a whole thread
of responses often depends on it.) Each
section follows its own rules for comments.
News Editor Julie Klein '09 says she moni
tors the Web site herself in addition to the
alerts. Opinions Editors In Ho Lee '09 and
Gerry Shih '08 say they tend to let comments
stay.
The result of this decentralized and ad hoc
system, which errs on the side of keeping
comments online and relies on comments
being removed after the fact, is that many ob
jectionable comments remain online. For ex
ample, in the last few weeks, comments ap
peared calling a Rhodes Scholarship winner
an "unappreciative prick" and threatening
him physically; an article about bike safety
received comments that are ads for porn
sites; and an op-ed about Donald Rumsfeld's
Hoover Institution appointment incited
comments with gratuitous sexual language.
All of these comments remained online for
days.
According to Hohmann, The Daily has
discussed various solutions for improving the

comment system — including requiring
users to register, requiring commenters to be
from the Stanford network and putting com
ments on a separate Web page instead of
below the article. For now, r lTie Daily has
stuck with its current system.
This is the wrong approach. The com
ments do reflect on The Daily, so The Daily
has an obligation to take responsibility for
them. Just because the paper has the power
to allow these flame wars on its Web site
doesn't mean that it should. (Hohmann notes
that The Daily reduces its liability to lawsuits
about the comments by not policing them
carefully. 1 don't think this is a reasonable
justification;The Daily shouldn't let anything
appear on its Web site that it isn't willing to
defend.)
The sad reality is that anonymity on the
Internet leads some people to post inappro
priate comments. Given the challenge of
policing comments after they appear and the
damage they might do even if they appear
only briefly before being removed, the best
solution is for The Daily to moderate com
ments — that is, only to publish those com
ments that have been approved by a desig
nated Daily staff member. When a com
menter includes his real name and is a public
figure — for example, a Stanford administra
tor quoted in the story clarifying his com
ments — he should be contacted immediate-
ly to confirm his identity. This way,
readers can know that when they see
a comment from Dean of Freshmen
and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-
Haims '89 (who has both posted her
self and been impersonated in Daily
Web site comments), it's really from
her. In our digital age, with Stanford
students up at all hours checking
their email, designating several
staffers to be responsible for moder
ating the site doesn't seem too un
reasonable.
Such a system is apparently feasi
ble.The Yale Daily News recently in
troduced a moderated commenting
feature on its Web site. According to
Andrew Mangino, the paper's edi
tor-in-chief, this system has worked
well; several editors manage to mod
erate all comments, usually with a
turnaround time of less than an hour.
Furthermore, the moderated system
has dissuaded people from bother
ing to submit inappropriate com
ments: only about 1 0 percent of com
ments have been rejected, Mangino
says.
With such a system, there is still a
challenge of figuring out what stan
dard comments should be judged by.
One approach, which is what the ed
itors at Yale's paper seem to be fol
lowing, is to allow most civil com
ments. This system would be fine and
would rid The Daily of its current
embarrassing comments.
A second approach would entail
a different philosophical perspec
tive. Instead of seeing the comments
as an open (though civil) free-for-all.
The Daily could instead treat these
pages as a digital extension of the
newspaper itself. The comments
would be like letters to the editor —
and would be held to the same high

standard.The difference is that there
would he no space limitations, and
the much quicker turnaround would
allow an extensive back-and-forth to
take place on the day of publication.
Such a system would encourage a
higher level of discourse, which The
Daily's readers are certainly capable
of, and could carry over to the print
edition by encouraging more letters
to the editor. Indeed, an online com
ment page could include an option to
submit a copy of the comment for
consideration in the print edition.
Either approach would encour
age a more civil system of comment
ing. This, in turn, might encourage
comments from readers who are cur
rently hesitant to post, having seen
the ad hominem attacks posters face
in the current system. The result
would be a system that better cap
tures the views of the Stanford com
munity. Ibis is important: People do
indeed look at Daily comments as a
measure of campus thought. This
summer, for example, an article in
The New York Times about Con
doleezza Rice referred to the "veri
table stream of vitriol" that ap
peared as comments to an article
about her on The Daily's Web site. I
wonder whether the Times reporter
was aware that vitriol isn't that un
usual in The Daily's comments.
Such a change would require a
significant overhaul of The Daily's
Web site. As Hohmann points out,
the primary focus of The Daily staff
is on the paper itself, not its Web site,
and so it should be. It's fine if it takes
awhile for The Daily to come up with
a good solution for allowing com
ments. The status quo, however, is an
embarrassment. As a temporary
measure. The Daily should remove
its commenting system.
The Daily should strive for high
discourse. If an online comment sys
tem can encourage that, it's a good
thing. But if it detracts from this mis
sion, it debases The Daily. Even if the

Web is the medium of the future, in
their current form comments are not
worth the damage they do to The
Daily's reputation.
