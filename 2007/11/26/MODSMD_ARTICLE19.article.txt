# NAT-URAL PHILOSOPHY
## A 						world without grades 
### 
As Nat Hillard awoke one morning
from uneasy dreams, he found that
the world felt a bit different.The test
he took only several days ago sat on his
dresser. I ie had picked it up the previous
evening, but he hadn't looked at the grade
yet.
Rolling over to face it, however, he found
that the paper had no evidence of a grade at
all.There was a red circle.but there was noth
ing in it. The point tallies were simply miss
ing.
"Surely, this is a mistake!" he yelled, ter
ror in his voice. He quickly logged onto
Coursework, only to find a notice:The Land
of Stanfordia will no longer issue grades.
And just then, Nat heard a knock on the
door. It was a professor, a man he didn't
know but had surely seen many times before.
ITie man was crying, his head buried in his
hands. "The balloons!" he cried. "Our grade
balloons! How will we inflate them? All the
grades are gone from Stanfordia!"
A crash interrupted his lament. A student
in the background, wearing a Stanford
sweatshirt, had flipped over a car and was
busy pouring lighter fluid over it. She had a
crazed look in her eye. She threw the match
down on the lighter fluid and the blazing con
tour of a bright "A+" erupted on the pave
ment."With nograde on my test, I have noth
ing to argue with the professor over," she
yelled. "I know I got at least an A, but how
will 1 know if 1 got an A+?!"
She walked over to the professor that had
just knocked on Nat's door and proceeded to

ask him a series of questions about the mate
rial on the test. His only answers were a few
pitifully muffled cries.
Looking around him, Nat saw a large
crowd of people, all in a similar state of panic.
Running wildly, smashing things and hitting
each other, this mob was clearly distressed. A
few amongst the mob were wearing 1950s
style letter jackets. The original letters had
been torn off. and they had been replaced
with single, shining "As". When prompted,
one of the jacket-wearers responded. "My
status is on the line! My beautiful status! The
one I earned in high school!"
Another gathering had formed around a
burning trash can across the street, and ap
proaching this crowd, Nat saw that it was
largely comprised of administrators. Dean
Julie was in the process of gnawing a human
leg, and Richard Shaw had grown a thick
coat of stubble. He was rattling a tin cup with
a single coin in it, and his clearly shaking
hands held a sign that read "will evaluate for
food."
It seemed that wherever Nat went in Stan
fordia, there was chaos. Meyer Library was
filled with pale, crawling creatures, strands of

mucous dangling from their barely closed
lips. Students, who appeared to have no idea
what to do with themselves, were hanging
limply from every conceivable surface, and
some were drawing tic-tac-toe squares on the
side of Tresidder.
Phones all over campus were ringing off
the hook, the cries of angry and anxious par
ents echoing from the other end of the
mouthpiece. "No grades? How will we love
you?" screamed one particularly adamant
parent.
Over the next few weeks. Nat saw his for
merly pristine campus Utopia degenerate
into pure anarchy. But in the heart of the
mire, in the heat of the lootings and the burn
ings, he saw something beautiful arise. Sud
denly.students stopped their raging and their
mobbing and started to make art — beauti
ful, simple art. inspired by a creativity that
was born when liberated from evaluation.
The students started more engaging, inter
esting conversations that didn't center
around letters and numbers but around
ideas.
And just as Stanfordia truly became a
forum for the exchange of ideas. Nat was jolt
ed awake by a splash of cold reality He
sighed, rolled over to face the circled number
written above the test on his dresser and
started another day of his life.

Nat considered titling this column " Top 10 rea
sons to excuse laziness as a product of some
one else's doing" hut scrapped it. Speak to him
