Cardinal finished in first place with 145 points ahead of Ore
gon (177) and Florida State (236), which came in second and
third, respectively.
"1 was proud of what 1 did," Lambie said." 1 was going into
it trying to score as low as I could, and 1 was happy 1 could do
that.
"It's hard to put into words." she added. "I'm absolutely
thrilled."

The members of Stanford's national championship cross country team celebrate their third title in as many years during last Monday's NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Ind. The team was led by its trio of star seniors Teresa McWalters, Arianna Lambie and Lauren Centrowitz.
The title was Lambie's fourth at Stanford
the Cardinal also won in 2003, 2005 and
2006 — and the fifth-year senior was not
alone in her efforts. Senior team captain Lau
ren Centrowitz finished second for Stanford
with a time of 20:59.3 while junior Katie Har
rington wasn't far behind in third at 21:06.5.
Freshman Alex Gits (21:12.4) was the fourth
Cardinal finisher and senior Teresa McWal
ters (21:16.0), who collapsed just before the
finish line,rounded out the scoring efforts for
Stanford.
"I think the team's performance was real
ly spectacular." assistant coach David Vidal
said. "Winning two years before makes you
a marked team; you're a target when you've
already won twice. That adds a lot of pres
sure and puts a lot of accountability on the

athletes to come through. They put it all to
gether so well. It's just so amazing how these
girls can come together when it counts, on
the day of the national championship."
In particular, Vidal praised the efforts of
the true freshman Gits, who came up big for
the Cardinal during the season's stretch run.
"It's hard to expect a freshman to race at
the national titles," he said. "She did more
than race, she finished in fourth. Everyone
came through...it was more than we could
have expected, even."
In a startling conclusion to the champi
onship race. McWalters — who won the
NCAA West Regional on Nov. 10 and was
named West Regional Runner of the Year
— collapsed about 10 meters before finish
line.

"I don't recall any of it actually." said
McWalters, who said she was exhausted by
the end of the race. "I just started unraveling.
I basically had nothing left. All I knew is that
I just had to finish."
Despite falling before the finish line, the
senior was able to pick herself up and finish
the race, coming in fifth place for Stanford
and 62nd overall.
The Cardinal men also competed in Indi
ana last Monday but did not have as much
success as the women. Led by seniors Nef
talem Araia and Russell Brown, who fin
ished in 50th and 51 st place, respectively, the
men came in 19th place. The Cardinal's 451
points put them well behind first-place Ore
gon, which finished with 85 points.
Lambie could not contain her pride in de

scribing what the third straight title meant to
her and to Stanford.
"The way we look at it is that we're part of
a legacy" she explained. "Stanford has had
amazing teams and runners in the past, and
we feel kind of a responsibility to carry on
that legacy. To win three in a row solidified
that. It just makes us proud to be part of that
line of history."
"When I was a freshman putting on the
Stanford uniform, it gave me chills. McWal
ters added."Now, I've been a part of building
that legacy and making it even greater than it
was. and I think all of us feel that. It's pretty
special."
