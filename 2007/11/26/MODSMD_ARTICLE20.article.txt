Preventing prejudice in reporting
sexual violence
To the editor:
I first would like to compliment the fine
work of Emma Trotter and The Stanford
Daily on the recent article regarding sexual
assault campus data ("Rise in reported rapes
due to new resources," Nov. 14). The article
was accurate, informative and well written.
Unfortunately, the same could not be said
of the first response to the article on The
Daily's Web site. I feel the need to respond to
that posting s propagation of harmful myths
about false reporting.

The posting states, "studies have shown
that 40 to 50 percent (very conservative esti
mate... I believe the actual number is much
higher) of rape allegations turn out to be
false. Please refer to Purdue Prof. Kanin's
study which found that 41 percent of rape al
legations in a nine-year study were false."
Prof. Kanin's study was examined in the
article "False Allegations of Rape: A Cri
tique of Kanin" by Dr. David Lisak in the
September/October 2007 issue of the Sexual
Assault Report. Dr. Lisak is an associate pro
fessor of psychology and director of the
Men's Sexual TVauma Research Project at
the University of Massachusetts. Boston. Dr.

Lisak says that "Kanin's 1994 article on false
allegations is a provocative opinion piece,
but it is not a scientific study of the issue of
false reporting of rape. It certainly should
never he used to assert a scientific founda
tion for the frequency of false allegations."
He makes the point that Kanin "simply
reiterates the opinions of the police officers
who concluded that the cases in question
were 'false allegations. " After citing an In
ternational Association of Chiefs of Police
manual (Investigating Sexual Assaults,
www.theiacp.org/documents/pdfs/RCD/In-
vestigatingSexualAssaultsPaper.pdf
, p. 13), which states that polygraph
tests for sexual assault victims are
contradicted in the investigation
process and that their use is "based
on the misperception that a signifi
cant percentage of sexual assault re
ports are false." Lisak then observes
that "It is noteworthy that the police
department from which Kanin de
rived his data used or threatened to
use the polygraph in every case...The
fact that it was the standard proce
dure of this department provides a
window on the biases of the officers
who conducted the rape investiga
tions, biases that were then echoed in
Kanin's unchallenged reporting of
their findings."

For a discussion of false rape alle
gations which recognizes that the
topic is complex (as opposed to the
poster's straightforward uppercase
explanation that "MANY WOMEN
DO. IN FACT. FLAT OUT LIE"),
see "Successfully Investigating Ac
quaintance Sexual Assault: A Na
tional Training Manual for Law En
forcement," developed by the Na
tional Center for Women and Polic
ing (www.mincava.umn.edu/docu
ments/acquaintsa/participant/alle-
gations.doc).
After a discussion of several ways
that a sexual assault case may end up
incorrectly classified as unfounded,
the authors conclude, "Perhaps the
most tragic consequence of routine
ly unfounding sexual assault cases,
however, is that it fuels the myth that
a high percentage of cases are deter
mined to be false... By improperly re
porting cases as unfounded to the
FBI —and then having many mem

bers of society confuse 'unfounded
cases' with 'false allegations' —
these inaccurate statistics create the
sense that a higher percentage of
sexual assault cases is deemed to be
false compared with other types of
cases." The authors also note that
"The idea that women lie about
rape... has devastating consequences
for victims when they seek support
from friends, family, social services
and the criminal justice system."
Allowing the expression of this
kind of harmful prejudice to stand
unchallenged would be a disservice
to the entire campus community.The
original article in The Daily says.
"Campus groups have taken steps to
take the stigma out of reporting sex
ual violence." Let's give them our
heartfelt support.
