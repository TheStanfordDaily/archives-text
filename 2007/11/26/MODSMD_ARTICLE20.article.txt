Preventing prejudice in reporting
sexual violence
To the editor:
I first would like to compliment the fine
work of Emma Trotter and The Stanford
Daily on the recent article regarding sexual
assault campus data ("Rise in reported rapes
due to new resources," Nov. 14). The article
was accurate, informative and well written.

Prof. Kanin's study was examined in the
article "False Allegations of Rape: A Cri

Men's Sexual TVauma Research Project at
the University of Massachusetts. Boston. Dr.

Lisak says that "Kanin's 1994 article on false
allegations is a provocative opinion piece,
but it is not a scientific study of the issue of
false reporting of rape. It certainly should
never he used to assert a scientific founda
tion for the frequency of false allegations."
He makes the point that Kanin "simply
reiterates the opinions of the police officers
who concluded that the cases in question
were 'false allegations. " After citing an In
