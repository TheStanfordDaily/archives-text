## Cal fans sink to a new low 
### 
At Saturday night's thrilling
five-set victory by the Stan
ford women's volleyball
team over Cal at Maples Pavilion,
several Cal fans sank to a new low
— before the first ball was even
served. In what appears to be a new
Cal tradition, the Cal student fans in
attendance disrupted the solo per
formance of the national anthem no
fewer than three times. First, they
disrupted the line "O say. can you
see" by shouting in unison "UC!" an
apparent reference to UC-Berke
ley.Then, they disrupted "And rock
ets' red glare" by shouting "blue"
over the word "red," contrasting the
school colors of Stanford and
Berkeley. Finally, they interrupted
the line "and the home of the brave"
by yelling "Bears!" over the word
"brave," an apparent reference to
Cal's perennially annoying mascot.
Being a graduate of both Stan
ford (B.S. 1997) and Cal (J.D. 2003),
I'd like to think that 1 come to the
Stanford vs. Cal debate with more
impartiality than the average rabid
Stanford or Cal fan. In fact, at the
risk of being labeled a heretic by the
readers of The Daily. 1 often cheer
for Cal athletic teams (when they

are not facing Stanford, of course).
With all that said. 1 was appalled,
disgusted and shocked by the con
certed efforts of Cal students to dis
rupt the singing of our (both Stan
ford and Cal's) national anthem. It
showed an utter lack of class. But,
while I feel justified in being ap
palled and disgusted. 1 should not
have been shocked: I laving no class
is the modus operendi for the vast
majority of Cal fans (but. to be fair,
not all Cal fans).
Because 1 grew up around (and
thus became accustomed to) the vit
riol of Cal fans, I did not realize how
classless they truly were until 1 saw
Stanford's women's volleyball team
play at the University of Texas last
December. The small Stanford fan
contingent was a tiny patch of Car
dinal red in a sea of UT burnt or
ange. The UT fans cheered on their
team relentlessly and tried to dis
rupt the Stanford squad every
chance they got. But they did all this
with the utmost of class, with fideli
ty to the true spirit of competitive
collegiate athletics. After Stanford
won the amazing four set match,
various UT fans congratulated our
team on a great performance. Con

trast this southern hospitality with
the typical behavior of Cal fans. I'm
sure that 1 am not the only Stanford
fan who has a story about being
treated poorly by Cal students while
visiting the Cal campus for our Big
Game.
As Big Game Week begins. 1
have messages for both Cal and
Stanford fans.
Cal Fans: Please get over your
Stanford inferiority complex! Cal
has a great academic and athletic
history. Be proud of that. Quit trying
to define yourselves in terms of your
opposition to Stanford (as you do
when you replace "red" with "blue"
in the national anthem!). You are
Cal, not Anti-Stanford. And please
do not disrespect our national an
them!
Stanford Fans: Please conduct
yourself with class and dignity! Do
not stoop to the level of Saturday
night's Cal fans. Be a gracious Big
Game host and show Cal fans some
Stanford I lospitality when they visit
Stanford Stadium this year for the
Big Game.
