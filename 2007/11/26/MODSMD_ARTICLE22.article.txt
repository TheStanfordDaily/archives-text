### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anthony Goods regained his shooting touch and the Cardi
nal responded to its first loss of the season with two home wins,
capped by Saturday night's convincing 73-53 victory over Col
orado State.
Goods, the junior guard, scored 15 points, andjunior forward
Lawrence I lill added 15 points and eight rebounds to lead Stan
ford (6-1) against the Rams. Goods had shot 2-for-16 in his pre
vious two outings but bounced back with a 6-for-13 perform
ance that included seven straight points for the Cardinal in the
first half.
"I put up a lot of shots in practice and started to get my con
fidence," Goods said.

"Sometimes you can
shoot yourself out of it.
But you have to give it
to the hot hand and try
not to force it too
much."
Stanford kept Col
orado State cold on of
fense, holding the
Rams (3-2) under 37
percent shooting from
the field. Colorado
State shot 7-for-27 in
the first half, as the Car
dinal took a 34-15 lead
at the intermission.
"I thought our guys
did a very, very good
job defensively," coach
Trent Johnson said.
"Going from one
group to another
group, the intensity
didn't slack off."
Guard Willis Gard
ner was one of the few
bright spots for Col
orado State, scoring 14
points mostly off of
dribble penetration.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is now 6-1 on the
year. During last Tuesday's 72-61 win
against Yale, Robin Lopez and Lawrence Hill
both set career high point totals; Lopez had
24 points and 12 rebounds while Hill had
25 points. Stanford will finish the quarter
with tomorrow's game against Sacramento
State and Sunday's match-up against Col
orado. After that, the team will not have a
game for over two weeks.

After falling into a speed trap at Siena, Stanford slowed
down the pace Saturday night and took care of the ball well,
committing only five turnovers.
"We can always get a three, but we need to keep teams in the
half court," Johnson said. "Go inside out. physical, strong and
use our advantages to our advantage."
Goods agreed.
"We got sped up against Siena," he said. "We have to slow
down and pass to the open man.Thread the needle."
Goods did just that during a first half run, hitting a streaking
Robin Lopez for a perfect alley-oop that brought a relatively
quiet Maples Pavilion to its feet.
"That was just part of our offense," Goods said of the play,
which he said was a spontaneous decision. "We just made eye
contact."
