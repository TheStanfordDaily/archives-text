## Instant replay a no brainer 
### 
The United States hosts Russia in the Davis Cup
finals next week in Portland, Ore. After much
negotiation between the Davis Cup governing
body, the ITF and the USTA, the finals will incorpo
rate a new rule: players will have an unlimited number
of opportunities to challenge line calls through
"Hawk-Eye," or electronic replay.
Under the normal rules, players are allotted two
challenges per set, with an additional one in case of a
tie-break. Players only use up a challenge if they are
found to be wrong; they may challenge however many
times they wish as long as they are determined to be
correct.
Hawk-Eye was implemented as an officiating aid
following a number of bad line calls in the highly con
troversial 2004 U.S. Open match between Serena
Williams and Jennifer Capriati. To justify the cost of
such a system — which entered in the six-digits range
— Hawk-Eye had to provide both sporting value and
entertainment value. To satisfy the latter, it was imple
mented with guidelines similar to those under the
NFL's instant replay system.
There are obvious reasons for allotting only a lim
ited number of challenges in both tennis and football.
With only a few challenges per game, players or coach
es must be extremely selective as to which calls they
call into question.The calls usually end up being those
late in the set on set point or mid-fourth quarter with a
three-point deficit — amounting to quite a bit of a
spectacle and quite a bit of entertainment for the spec
tators.
Additionally, the system must account for the fear
that players would abuse an unlimited number of chal
lenges, bringing every call into question and disrupting
and delaying matches.
But this seems to be a much greater risk in football
than it is in tennis. In football, the red flag brings the
play "upstairs," where an officiating crew and the head
referee view the play from a number of different cam
era angles and. based on that, uphold or overturn the
call on the field. In contrast, in tennis, the Hawk-Eye
camera system projects the exact position of the ball as
it hits the court onto a large screen, and. based on that,
the umpire upholds or overturns the call on the court.
Not only does the Hawk-Eye system require signif
icantly less time, it requires virtually no deliberation or
judgment. Cameras indicate whether the ball was out
or in; there are no ifs or buts about it.
Furthermore, the Hawk-Eye system has already
been implemented once before, in the 2006 Davis Cup
Finals. Players called an average of 3.6 challenges per
set, little more than the 2+l challenges per set they are
allotted under the normal rules.This is not actually sur
prising; players often cannot see the far baseline to
judge calls because they are often moving after shots
or their lines of vision are blocked by the net. Tennis
players are simply not inclined to challenge the vast
majority of shots due to the very nature of the game.
Furthermore, there are a number of benefits to al
lowing unlimited challenges. Such a rule would pre
vent a situation in which a clearly incorrect call is made
at a crucial point in a game, but a player cannot chal
lenge the call because he has already used up his allot
ted challenges. It would also remove the pressure on
players to decide when to use a challenge.
In the 2007 Masters Cup, for ex
ample, Roger Federer could have
had double break point against
David Ferrer in the opening game. At
15-30, he hit a forehand that just
clipped the line, but was called out.
He hesitated and eventually decided
against a challenge because he had
already used one earlier in the game
and did not want to risk playing with
out any challenges.
Unlimited challenges, therefore,
prevent bad calls from slipping
through. It allows the Hawk-Eye sys
tem to do what it was intended to do
— ensure correct calls and fair play.
