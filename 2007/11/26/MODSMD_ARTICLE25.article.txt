spectable.
The Old Dominion game started off
much better for Stanford — Appel
blocked ODU's first shot and then made a
lay-up at the other end to open the scoring.
But the Monarchs locked the Cardinal
into a tight battle for the rest of the half,
and the teams traded leads until junior for
ward Jillian Harmon, who scored 16 points
off the bench, hit a jumper with 1:27 until
the break. From that point on, Stanford
would not trail again.

Sophomore forward Jayne Appel bullies her way past a Temple defender in the Cardinal's 63-54 win
yesterday. Stanford was down 1 7 at half-time before outscoring the Owls by 26 in the second half.
Cardinal rode out the Monarchs'
pressure from there to secure vic
tory and a spot in yesterday's third
place game against Temple.
Stanford's poor early game
form against Connecticut was on
display again versus Temple. The
Owls climbed all over the Cardinal
early, before a three-point play and
a jumper from Harmon brought
Stanford close again. With the
game tied at 12, Temple went on a
25-6 run over the next 12 minutes,
and Stanford went into the half
down big again, 39-22.
This time, though, the Cardinal
was able to claw its way back into
the game. Stanford took the lead
back before Temple scored another
point, starting the second half with
a 19-0 run. The Owls recovered to
go ahead again, but Wiggins hit six
free throws and a jumper to give
Stanford the lead again at 48-47,
and the Cardinal held on for the
final seven minutes.
Stanford returns to the court on
Wednesday to play its first home
game of the season, against San
Francisco at 7 p.m.
