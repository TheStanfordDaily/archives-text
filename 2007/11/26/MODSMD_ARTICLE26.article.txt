# Soccer falls in Sweet 16
## Card loses in third round for second year in a row 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
For the second straight year, the No. 5
Stanford women's soccer team just could not
make it happen in the Sweet 16. The Cardi
nal was bounced from the NCAA Tourna
ment's third round after losing 2-0 to No. 24
Connecticut at home last Friday.
Stanford (15-3-5) advanced to the second
weekend of play by walloping Sacramento
State 7-0 in the first round before edging
archrival Cal on penalty kicks after a 1-1
draw two days later.
But the supply of goals went dry by the
time the I luskiescame to town. Just like last
year's Sweet 16 defeat — a shootout loss to
Clemson that was also at home — Stanford
out-shot its opponent but could not ripple
the back of the net with any of its 12 shots
(five on goal). Sophomore forward kelley
O'l lara nearly opened the scoring with less
than 15 minutes to go in the first half, forcing
a tough save from Connecticut goalie
Stephanie Labbe. but the period ended
knotted at zero.
Stanford's fortune went sour just five
minutes into the second half. One of the Car
dinal's major problems this season has been
turnovers on its own side of the pitch, and
that issue reared its head at the worst time.
Huskies midfielder Meghan Schnur picked
off the ball from Stanford and hit Meghan
Cunningham near the goal. Cunningham
beat senior goalkeeper Erica Holland to
give the I luskies a 1-0 lead they would never
relinquish.
The Cardinal pushed forward to try to
find an equalizer but met with firm resist
ance from the Connecticut back line before
the I luskies iced the game with just over 20
minutes left.
Hie parallels between last year's and this
year's Sweet 16 exits are many. Once again.
Stanford dominated the game offensively
and defensively — I lolland was forced into
only one save — but could not convert when
it needed to.
Goals were not hard to come by the pre
vious weekend during opening round play.
Hie Cardinal roared into postseason play
with guns blazing, needing all of M seconds
to find the back of the net. Freshman for
ward Christen Press hit the first of two goals
on a swerving shot just after the kickoff, and
O'l lara gave Stanford a 2-0 lead just seven
minutes later, turning in a cross from fellow
sophomore forward Ali Riley.
The match calmed down a bit from that
point, but Stanford went on to add goals
