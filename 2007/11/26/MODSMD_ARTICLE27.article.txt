### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After 29 matches and 27 wins, the Stanford
women's volleyball team is ready to make a run

all season. When the NCAA tournament
bracket was announced last night on ESPNU,
the Cardinal was the first team named — the
top seed in the nation ahead of No. 2 Nebraska.
No. 3 Penn State and No. 4 Texas.
"1 think this is the best national tournament
ever," head coach John Dunning said. "There
are a lot of really good teams all over the coun
try — the top four teams are all very talented.'
The Cardinal, who won the outright Pac-10
title with its victory over No. 10 Cal on Friday
night, will host a subregional bracket featuring
Santa Clara. Minnesota and Sacramento State
this weekend.
Stanford is also hosting the Regional com

according to the current seeding — will com
pete for a spot in the 112 inal Four in Sacramento.
Stanford has already faced, and beaten, sev
eral of the teams in the region, including Min
nesota, Ohio and Cal Poly in the preseason.The
team defeated UCLA and Oregon in confer
ence play.
"I think it worked out well for us in that sev
eral of the teams we might end up facing are
teams that we have played before," Dunning
said."l think our team is pretty good at zeroing
in on somebody and adjusting once we have
played them."
The Cardinal's first opponent will be Santa
Clara, the West Coast Conference champion.
The Broncos ended Stanford's postseason in
the second round in Maples in 2005 but have
struggled with injuries this season.
Setter Crystal Matich was recently named
WCC Player of the Year and has led Santa
Clara to a 19-11 overall record and 11 -3 in con
ference. Brittany Lowe is the Broncos' top hit
ter, with 405 kills on the season.
Stanford visited Minnesota — its opponent

regular season at 18-12.
Freshman Brooke Dieter spearheads the
Minnesota attack while Jessy Jones anchors the
front-row defense — she ranks in the top 10 na
tionally in blocks per game.
