Visiting Law Prof. Barbara Ol
shansky J.D/85 encouraged listeners
to stand up to human rights viola
tions at the U.S. detention center in
Cuba's Guantanamo Bay at a book
reading Tuesday afternoon.
Olshansky. who is teaching clinics
in civil rights and looks to start a civil
rights major at the Law School, read
and discussed selections from her
newest book,"Democracy Detained:
Secret Unconstitutional Practices in
the U.S. War on Terror," in front of
about 30 law students, staff and com
munity members in the Robert
Crown Law Library.
One of the most renowned public
interest lawyers in the country, Ol
shansky scored her biggest legal vic
tory in the 2004 Supreme Court deci
sion Shafiq Rasul. et al., Petitioners v.
George W. Rush, when the Court
ruled that detainees at Guantanamo
Bay could challenge their incarcera
tion in federal court.
During Tuesday's reading, Ol
shanksy expressed opposition to
politicians "who seek unchecked
power to pursue their global "War on
Terror' and who express a chilling
disregard for human rights and the
rule of law in that pursuit."
She said that the Bush adminis
tration is undermining its own moral
credibility, making "the U.S. less safe
by committing humanitarian and
human rights violations in the name
of national security."
Citing the example of terrorist ac
complice Jose Padilla, an American
citizen who was imprisoned for more
than three years without hearing or
trial, Olshanksy warned of the immi
nent loss of Americans'civil liberties.
"The government's unprecedent
ed action poses a grave threat to the
constitutional rights of all American
citizens," Olshansky said.

Until recently, she said, the names
of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay
were unavailable to even the lawyers
attempting to represent them, weak
ening the detainees' cases because it
was much more difficult to sue in the
names of all the prisoners than in in
dividual cases. It was not until the As
sociated Press sued the Department
of Defense in 2(M)5 under the Free
dom of Information Act that the pris
oners' names and statuses were de
classified.
"It is an astounding thing that our
administration has annihilated the
writ of habeas corpus," Olshansky
said, referring to the right to trial en
shrined in the U.S. Constitution.
The speaker discussed the treat
ment of children, some as young as
seven, in U.S. detainment facilities.
"Among those seized and sent [to
Guantanamo] were children, juve
nile detainees, who. depending on
their age. were housed in a separate
prison called Camp Iguana or with
adult detainees," she said.
She quoted Amnesty Internation
al regarding the case of a 13-year-old
boy, Mohammed Ismail Agha, who
was seized in Afghanistan, held for a
year without trial and "subjected to
solitary confinement and sleep dep
rivation techniques in the same man
ner as adult detainees."
While Rasul v. Bush was a sub
stantial improvement for Guan
tanamo detainees, Olshansky said
that she continues to pressure the
Bush administration to enforce pris
oners' rights and abide by the Gene
va Convention.
"Following the Rasul decision, the
detainees are now allowed to chal
lenge their detention in court." she
told The Daily, "but once the trial
starts, they are prohibited from
opening their mouths."
Olshansky urged attendees to
help raise awareness of the civil
rights issues surrounding the War on
Terror.
"People have to go to any group
that they have any affinity with and
say, 'What are we going to do about

this?'" she said.
While acknowledging that there
are many obstacles ahead for the
protection of civil rights, Olshansky
said she was more optimistic than
when she arrived at Stanford three
months ago.
"What I have seen since I arrived
on campus is a strong willingness to
act," she said.
Sarah Wilson, reference librarian
and archivist at the Law Library, said
she found the event a moving call for
civil action.
"She presented a serious topic in
a graceful and engaging way," Wilson
wrote in an email to'lTie Daily. "De
spite all she's seen in her work on be
half of the detainees, she remains op
timistic that if people take action,jus
tice for "political prisoners' can be
had."
