# Three win Rhodes
## Stanford ties Univ. of Chicago for most American Scholarship winners 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Three current and former Stanford students were among the 32
American winners of 2(K)8 Rhodes Scholarships, the Rhodes Trust
announced in a Nov. 17 press release.
Laurel Gabler "06. Scott Thompson '06 and Aaron Polhamus '08
are the three Stanford students who will join 29 other Americans
at Oxford University in England next fall.
Gabler, Thompson and Polhamus follow in the footsteps of
Stanford's four Rhodes winners last year. Including this year's
three recipients, Stanford has had a total of 93 Rhodes Scholars
since 1905.
Stanford's three winners this year equaled the three recipients
from the University of Chicago for the most American honorees
from any individual school. Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, the
University of Georgia and tiny St. Olaf College in Northfield.
Minn.,each had two American recipients, while 16 other schools —
including Yale. Mil'. I ISC and UC-Berkeley — each had one U.S.
Rhodes Scholar. A third Harvard student won the award as a
Kenyan native, and a third Princeton student won as a Canadian.
Polhamus. who transferred to Stanford from Western Washing
ton University last year, used a Stanford major grant to study rural
microfinance in Peru over the summer. 1 le said he plans to use his
time at Oxford to study "the development of financial infrastruc
ture and private investment as means of supporting economic
growth in poor countries."
The public policy major described his reaction to winning the
award in an email to The Daily.
"I thought I would suddenly feel the weight of years of struggle
and hard work come washing over me in a groundswell of emo
tion," Polhamus said. "1 did not experience the anticipated eupho
ria. however, but rather a deep, calm satisfaction, similar to the
physical sensation of being relieved of a very heavy burden.
"For me, winning the Rhodes is the culmination of a seven-vear
process that has taken me from being
an at-risk student on his way to drop
ping out of school to a spiritually and
academically transformed young
man with a clear vision for his future,"
he added. "The emotion may still hit
me once I actually get some sleep, but,
for now, I have the satisfaction of a
voice inside saying'you've arrived.'"
Polhamus said that during his
short time at Stanford, the Universi
ty's "leading contribution to my edu
cation so far has been in the area of
learning to do research and be a self
initiated learner."
A political science and psychology
double major, Thompson is the only
one of Stanford's 2008 Rhodes recip
ients to spend his entire college ca
reer at the University. Thompson
works for Teach for America in New
York City, and he plans to study social
policy and social work at Oxford.
The 2006 graduate said he was
shocked to learn that he had won the
coveted award and that its effect has
hardly sunk in. even a week after the
announcement.
"1 think my jaw might have actual
ly dropped when they announced it,"
Thompson said in an email to The
Daily. "The other finalists were an in
credibly bright and talented group of
people, and after spending a couple of
days with them through the interview
process, 1 really wasn't expecting to
win the award."
Thompson said his Oxford plans
sprang directly from his experiences
teaching underprivileged youths in
New York City.
"As a Teach for America teacher
in the South Bronx, I've seen first

hand all of the obstacles that my stu
dents face on a daily basis," he said.
"The Oxford program will help me to
develop expertise in evaluating and
implementing research-based solu
tions to these social problems."
Thompson also credited Stanford
with helping him form lasting rela
tionships with professors and peers.
He said these relationships were cru
cial to his success in the Rhodes
process.
"Stanford provided me with an in
credible opportunity to develop close
relationships with professors, and
these relationships have provided me
with a great deal of support and guid
ance both during my time at Stanford
and after graduation," he said." In ad
dition, spending four years interact
ing with such a remarkable group of
peers — both in and out of the class
room — played a major role in devel
oping my ability to think on my feet,
as well as to see issues from multiple
perspectives."
Thompson said he envisions using
his research to formulate "practical
solutions to the problems faced by
children and families in low-income
communities" and added that he will
likely attend law school after the
Rhodes in an effort to bolster his pol
icy-making skills.
Gabler. who transferred to Stan
ford in 2004 from Maine's Colby Col
lege. is now a Luce Scholar in Thai
land. according to her biography on
the Rhodes Web site. Gabler, a psy
chology major at Stanford, has done
public health work in South America
and Africa and plans to study global
health science at Oxford.
Rhodes Scholarships — created
in 1902 by the will of British diamond
magnate and philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes — offer students from
around the globe the opportunity to
study the subject of their choice at

Oxford for two or three years with all
expenses paid.
The award recognizes more than
just academic achievement, as dictat
ed by Rhodes in his will. Applicants
are judged on a number of criteria, in
cluding "literary and scholastic at
tainments; energy to use one's ta'ents
to the lull, as exemplified by fondness
for and success in sports; truth,
courage, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak, kind
liness, unselfishness and fellowship;
and moral force of character and in
stincts to lead, and to take an interest
in one's fellow beings."
Despite the mandate set forth in
Rhodes' will, however, athletic
achievement is not considered as vital
to an applicant's chances today as it
was 100 years ago. None of Stanford's
recipients this year was involved in a
varsity sport at the University
l"his year's 32 Americans winners
were chosen from a national pool of
764 applicants from 294 different col
leges and universities and will repre
sent nearly 40 percent of the approxi
mately 85 total Rhodes Scholars in
2008.
In the U.S., two recipients are cho
sen from each of 16 geographical dis
tricts, and American applicants may
apply for the prestigious award either
from the state in which they are legal
residents or the state where they at
tended college.
None of Stanford's winners this
year applied from California's Dis
trict 16. Both Gabler and Thompson
applied from District 3, which repre
sents New York, while Polhamus ap
plied from District 15. which includes
Washington, the Stanford senior's
home state, as well as Alaska, \ lawaii,
Oregon, Utah and Idaho.

Thompson said he envisions using
his research to formulate "practical
solutions to the problems faced by
children and families in low-income
communities" and added that he will
likely attend law school after the
Rhodes in an effort to bolster his pol

Rhodes Scholarships — created
in 1902 by the will of British diamond
magnate and philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes — offer students from
around the globe the opportunity to
study the subject of their choice at

Oxford for two or three years with all
expenses paid.
The award recognizes more than
just academic achievement, as dictat
ed by Rhodes in his will. Applicants
are judged on a number of criteria, in
cluding "literary and scholastic at
tainments; energy to use one's ta'ents
to the lull, as exemplified by fondness
for and success in sports; truth,
courage, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak, kind
liness, unselfishness and fellowship;
and moral force of character and in
stincts to lead, and to take an interest
in one's fellow beings."
Despite the mandate set forth in
Rhodes' will, however, athletic
achievement is not considered as vital
to an applicant's chances today as it
was 100 years ago. None of Stanford's
recipients this year was involved in a
varsity sport at the University
l"his year's 32 Americans winners
were chosen from a national pool of
764 applicants from 294 different col
leges and universities and will repre
sent nearly 40 percent of the approxi
mately 85 total Rhodes Scholars in
2008.
In the U.S., two recipients are cho
sen from each of 16 geographical dis
tricts, and American applicants may
apply for the prestigious award either
from the state in which they are legal
residents or the state where they at
tended college.
None of Stanford's winners this
year applied from California's Dis
trict 16. Both Gabler and Thompson
applied from District 3, which repre
sents New York, while Polhamus ap
plied from District 15. which includes
Washington, the Stanford senior's
home state, as well as Alaska, \ lawaii,
Oregon, Utah and Idaho.

Three current and former Stanford students were among the 32
American winners of 2(K)8 Rhodes Scholarships, the Rhodes Trust
announced in a Nov. 17 press release.
Laurel Gabler "06. Scott Thompson '06 and Aaron Polhamus '08
are the three Stanford students who will join 29 other Americans
at Oxford University in England next fall.
Gabler, Thompson and Polhamus follow in the footsteps of
Stanford's four Rhodes winners last year. Including this year's
three recipients, Stanford has had a total of 93 Rhodes Scholars
since 1905.
Stanford's three winners this year equaled the three recipients
from the University of Chicago for the most American honorees
from any individual school. Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, the
University of Georgia and tiny St. Olaf College in Northfield.
Minn.,each had two American recipients, while 16 other schools —
including Yale. Mil'. I ISC and UC-Berkeley — each had one U.S.
Rhodes Scholar. A third Harvard student won the award as a
Kenyan native, and a third Princeton student won as a Canadian.
Polhamus. who transferred to Stanford from Western Washing
ton University last year, used a Stanford major grant to study rural
microfinance in Peru over the summer. 1 le said he plans to use his
time at Oxford to study "the development of financial infrastruc
ture and private investment as means of supporting economic
growth in poor countries."
The public policy major described his reaction to winning the
award in an email to The Daily.
"I thought I would suddenly feel the weight of years of struggle
and hard work come washing over me in a groundswell of emo
tion," Polhamus said. "1 did not experience the anticipated eupho
ria. however, but rather a deep, calm satisfaction, similar to the
physical sensation of being relieved of a very heavy burden.
"For me, winning the Rhodes is the culmination of a seven-vear
process that has taken me from being
an at-risk student on his way to drop
ping out of school to a spiritually and
academically transformed young
man with a clear vision for his future,"
he added. "The emotion may still hit
me once I actually get some sleep, but,
for now, I have the satisfaction of a
voice inside saying'you've arrived.'"
Polhamus said that during his
short time at Stanford, the Universi
ty's "leading contribution to my edu
cation so far has been in the area of
learning to do research and be a self
initiated learner."
A political science and psychology
double major, Thompson is the only
one of Stanford's 2008 Rhodes recip
ients to spend his entire college ca
reer at the University. Thompson
works for Teach for America in New
York City, and he plans to study social
policy and social work at Oxford.
The 2006 graduate said he was
shocked to learn that he had won the
coveted award and that its effect has
hardly sunk in. even a week after the
announcement.
"1 think my jaw might have actual
ly dropped when they announced it,"
Thompson said in an email to The
Daily. "The other finalists were an in
credibly bright and talented group of
people, and after spending a couple of
days with them through the interview
process, 1 really wasn't expecting to
win the award."
Thompson said his Oxford plans
sprang directly from his experiences
teaching underprivileged youths in
New York City.
"As a Teach for America teacher
in the South Bronx, I've seen first

hand all of the obstacles that my stu
dents face on a daily basis," he said.
"The Oxford program will help me to
develop expertise in evaluating and
implementing research-based solu
tions to these social problems."
Thompson also credited Stanford
with helping him form lasting rela
tionships with professors and peers.
He said these relationships were cru
cial to his success in the Rhodes
process.
"Stanford provided me with an in
credible opportunity to develop close
relationships with professors, and
these relationships have provided me
with a great deal of support and guid
ance both during my time at Stanford
and after graduation," he said." In ad
dition, spending four years interact
ing with such a remarkable group of
peers — both in and out of the class
room — played a major role in devel
oping my ability to think on my feet,
as well as to see issues from multiple
perspectives."
