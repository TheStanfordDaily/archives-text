## No luck for Cardinal Stanford unable to capitalize on opportunities in loss to Notre Dame 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's tough luck at home continued on Satur
day against Notre Dame, as the Cardinal offense failed
to convert in the red zone in the team's 21-14 loss to the
Irish. Senior kicker Derek Belch missed four field
goals while drops by wideouts Evan Moore and
Richard Sherman on Stanford's last two plays of the
game sealed the loss for the Cardinal.
Stanford (3-8, 2-6 Pac-10) fell to the equally lowly
Irish (3-9) in a game marred by penalties, turnovers and
miscues by both teams throughout. Still, the Cardinal
found itself in a first-and-goal situation at Notre Dame's
10 yard-line in the contest's final minute with a chance to
tie the game at 21. Senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander,
filling in for injured sophomore Tavita Pritchard, threw
two straight would-be touchdown strikes to senior
Moore and sophomore Sherman, but neither was
caught, and the Irish came away with the win.
Coach Jim Harbaugh did not address print media
following the game, leaving his players to describe the
ugly outcome to an uglier game on their own.
"It wasagreat pass,and I didn't make the play when
it mattered," Moore said of his chance to tie the game
on Stanford's final drive. "[lt was| right in my hands,
great pass, dropped."
Belch, who has been consistent most of the year, was
at a loss for words in describing the worst kicking game
of his collegiate career.
"I'm just dumbfounded, to be honest with you," he
said. "If you'd told me I was going to go 0-4 in a game,
I don't care how long the kicks are, I can't think of any
comparison to that at all."
