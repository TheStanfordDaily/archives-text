## No luck for Cardinal Stanford unable to capitalize on opportunities in loss to Notre Dame 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's tough luck at home continued on Satur
day against Notre Dame, as the Cardinal offense failed
to convert in the red zone in the team's 21-14 loss to the
Irish. Senior kicker Derek Belch missed four field
goals while drops by wideouts Evan Moore and
Richard Sherman on Stanford's last two plays of the
game sealed the loss for the Cardinal.
Stanford (3-8, 2-6 Pac-10) fell to the equally lowly
Irish (3-9) in a game marred by penalties, turnovers and
miscues by both teams throughout. Still, the Cardinal
found itself in a first-and-goal situation at Notre Dame's
10 yard-line in the contest's final minute with a chance to
tie the game at 21. Senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander,
filling in for injured sophomore Tavita Pritchard, threw
two straight would-be touchdown strikes to senior
Moore and sophomore Sherman, but neither was
caught, and the Irish came away with the win.
Coach Jim Harbaugh did not address print media
following the game, leaving his players to describe the
ugly outcome to an uglier game on their own.
"It wasagreat pass,and I didn't make the play when
it mattered," Moore said of his chance to tie the game
on Stanford's final drive. "[lt was| right in my hands,
great pass, dropped."
Belch, who has been consistent most of the year, was
at a loss for words in describing the worst kicking game
of his collegiate career.
"I'm just dumbfounded, to be honest with you," he
said. "If you'd told me I was going to go 0-4 in a game,
I don't care how long the kicks are, I can't think of any
comparison to that at all."
TTie Cardinal defense again had issues
stopping the run, as Notre Dame's Robert
Hughes rushed for 136 yards on IS carries.
Hughes keyed what turned out to be Notre
Dame's game-winning drive in the fourth
quarter with four straight rushes for 55 yards
and a touchdown, including a long run of 44
that carried the Irish to Stanford's 8-yard line.
Prior to Notre Dame's decisive drive, how
ever. the Cardinal defense played its way out
of difficult situations again and again, notch
ing four turnovers and five sacks on the day.
But a Pritchard interception inside Stanford's
own 20-yard line led to an easy score for the
Fighting Irish and helped Charlie Weis' squad
make it to the half with the score tied at 14.
"I thought the defense really gave us a
chance today" Moore said. "I felt like Notre
Dame was basically saying,' Mere you go, try
to win it.' and we didn't take it, we didn't even
|make] a nice run at it."
Offensively, Jim Harbaugh's Cardinal
seemed to have difficulty finding its rhythm all
game long, a task that became all the more dif
ficult when Pritchard had to leave the game
after taking a brutal clothesline shot to the
head at the end of a 19-yard scramble late in
the third quarter.
Ostrander took over under center for the
Cardinal offense and went 5-for-9 for 50yards,
but he had to come out himself for parts of two
drives in the fourth quarter when a hit to his
elbow left him unable to properly grip the
football. Despite early struggles, however.Os
trander appeared to give the Cardinal a
chance to win. completing two straight passes
on Stanford's final drive before the drops by
Moore and Sherman.
Senior receiver Mark Bradford and junior
running back Anthony Kimble also put up
solid efforts in the Cardinal loss Bradford was
the only Stanford player to catch more than
one pass, hauling in seven for 111 yards, while
Kimble carried 20 times for a healthy four
yards-per-carry average and a pair of touch
