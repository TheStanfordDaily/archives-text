## Big Game ticket crunch expected New, smaller stadium is virtually sold out 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to ensure home field ad
vantage for Saturday's Big Game, the
Stanford Athletics Department has ex
panded the Red Zone student section
by 1,400 seats.
The move comes as University offi
cials adjust to increased demand for
tickets in the renovated Stanford Stadi
um and a new program granting free ad
mission to undergraduate and graduate

students.
"Cal's undergraduate population is
four times the size of Stanford's, so when
we travel there we're really outnum
bered." said Danny Arbeiter'OS.a mem
ber of the Axe Committee. "We try to
avoid that in our stadium."
But as the University works to boost
student attendance, general admission
to the stadium has seen a ticket crunch.
This year's Big Game is the first in the
new $100 million dollar Stanford Stadi
um. which was completed in fall 2006
and is smaller in seating capacity â€”
down about 35.000 from the old stadi
um's capacity of 85.000.
Almost 8.000 students signed up for
free tickets in the Red Zone, said Bob

Carruesco. assistant athletic director for
marketing, which led the Athletic De
partment to increase the student section
from 3.000 to 4.4(H) seats. The expanded
section will begin at around the 40-yard
line and wrap around the adjacent south
end zone, where the Band will be relo
cated.
Season ticket holders in the affected
sections have been moved to "compara
ble seats." Carruesco said.
The Athletics Department debuted a
new points system this season to handle
increased demand for Big Game tickets.
Students get one point for each game at
tended, and students with two or more

Students, shown here at the Sept. 1 home game against UCLA, are expected to fill an expanded student section at Big Game
this Saturday. A new policy gives preferential admission to students who have attended previous football games.
