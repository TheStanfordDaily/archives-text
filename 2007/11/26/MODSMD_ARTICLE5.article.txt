## Big Game ticket crunch expected New, smaller stadium is virtually sold out 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to ensure home field ad
vantage for Saturday's Big Game, the
Stanford Athletics Department has ex
panded the Red Zone student section
by 1,400 seats.
The move comes as University offi
cials adjust to increased demand for
tickets in the renovated Stanford Stadi
um and a new program granting free ad
mission to undergraduate and graduate

students.
"Cal's undergraduate population is
four times the size of Stanford's, so when
we travel there we're really outnum
bered." said Danny Arbeiter'OS.a mem
ber of the Axe Committee. "We try to
avoid that in our stadium."
But as the University works to boost
student attendance, general admission
to the stadium has seen a ticket crunch.
This year's Big Game is the first in the
new $100 million dollar Stanford Stadi
um. which was completed in fall 2006
and is smaller in seating capacity —
down about 35.000 from the old stadi
um's capacity of 85.000.
Almost 8.000 students signed up for
free tickets in the Red Zone, said Bob

Carruesco. assistant athletic director for
marketing, which led the Athletic De
partment to increase the student section
from 3.000 to 4.4(H) seats. The expanded
section will begin at around the 40-yard
line and wrap around the adjacent south
end zone, where the Band will be relo
cated.
Season ticket holders in the affected
sections have been moved to "compara
ble seats." Carruesco said.
The Athletics Department debuted a
new points system this season to handle
increased demand for Big Game tickets.
Students get one point for each game at
tended, and students with two or more

points will receive priority entrance
to Big Game. Students who signed up
for the Red Zone prior to a summer
cutoff date received an extra bonus
point,so"anyone who has shown any
interest in football should be able to
come and get in," Arbeiter said.
The Red Zone will also open up
to any student regardless of points 45
minutes prior to kickoff, Arbeiter
added.
"Students are encouraged to get
there early," he said."lt's going to be
a free-for-all."
Big Game attendance averaged
around 60.000 in the old stadium,
which allowed plenty of room for
student overflow.The biggest student
section for a Big Game was just
under 5,000 in the late 19905.
"I think this will be the biggest
crowd [in the new stadium]," Car
ruesco said, adding that the game "is,
for all intents and purposes, sold
out."
While Stanford has worked to en
sure as many of its own students as
possible can attend Big Game, the
smaller size of the new Stanford Sta

dium has left many Cal fans without
tickets. Historically, the Big Game
draws over 40.000 Berkeley faithful,
but Stanford has reserved only about
15,000 tickets for Cal, the same num
ber the University typically reserves
for visiting teams. A third of those
tickets will go to students and the Cal
band.
The ticket scramble has led hun
dreds of Cal fans to buy Stanford sea
son ticket packages, with ticket plans
that include a Big Game ticket.
"Yeah, it's difficult for Cal [with
the smaller stadium]," Carruesco
said. "They used to have as much
room as they wanted, but now there's
much greater demand."
Demand has not skyrocketed
however: as of press time tickets
were available at popular Web sites
like Stub Hub or Craigslist at or
below face value. Stanford is on a
five-game losing streak and Cal has
lost five of its last six games. While
the rivalry is always a big draw, tick
ets would have been even scarcer if
the teams had continued to win. Car
ruesco said.
"But that's a good headache to
have," he said. "God only knows we
need more of that."
