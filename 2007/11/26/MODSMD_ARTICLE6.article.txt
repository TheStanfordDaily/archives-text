## Meeting covers gender-blind housing plans Students call for policy change in University dorms 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
More than 20 students packed into a room
with ;i dozen chairs at a Nov. 17 meeting to
discuss gender-neutral housing, and I lousing
officials opened a sliding glass door to allow
students to spill onto the Student Housing
Central Office's front porch.
"We mobilized a lot of people who really
care," said Katherine Roubos 07. a student
who has been fighting for gender-neutral
housing for several years.
Gender-neutral — or gender-blind
housing refers to the idea that students should
have the freedom to room with whomever
they want, regardless of gender. Currently,
males and females at Stanford can only be
roommates in cooperative houses, where the
University turns a blind eye to cross-gender
living arrangements, or in couples' housing in
Escondido Village.
Students pushing for gender-neutral
housing think that all students should be able
to room with whomever they choose in all
types of residences.
"This has been an issue for many years, but
there's never been an organized, united group
of students working on it." said Nabill ldnsi
'09, another gender-blind housing advocate.
The situation changed last spring when
Housing officials and about eight students
organized into an official committee. After
the committee held a sparsely attended
meeting in October, Roubos, Idrisi
and others galvanized support
from a broader group of students.
A "genderblind taskforce" email
list was created, and 20 students
were interested enough to come to
the committee's second meeting
this month.
Housing officials seemed sur
prised by the large turnout but re
ceptive to student input.
"No one has to convince any
I lousing official that this is an issue
we need to address," said Chief
I lousing Officer Rodger Whitney.
He said that since Stanford ex
panded its non-discrimination poli
cy this fall to include gender identi
ty. the University is required to
meet the needs of its transgender
students — who would often prefer
to live with someone of the gender
they identify as rather than some
one of their birth sex. Housing offi
cials currently work with students
who declare themselves as trans
gender to find acceptable living

arrangements.
Whitney said that Housing offi
cials originally thought accommo
dating transgender students could
he separated from implementing
gender-neutral housing for the en
tire Stanford population. But stu
dents at the meeting disagreed.
Roubos read an impassioned let
ter from a transgender Stanford
alum, who wrote that requiring a
student to identify as transgender to
obtain gender-neutral housing "is
like asking a Jewish person to wear
a Star of David armband to eat
Kosher food."
Another transgender student,
who was present at the meeting,
broke down in tears as she de
scribed her experience.
"1 had to contact someone in the
Housing office and basically out
myself as a trans person," she said.
The student input seemed to
make an impression on Whitney.
"We have to do better than that
by a long shot." he said.
The meeting was scheduled to
end after one hour, but Whitney
cancelled his lunchtime commit
ment to spend a second hour talking
to students.
Whitney said that providing gen

der-neutral accommodations is a
big issue for housing officials at
many universities.
"Everybody's talking about
this," he said, adding that Stanford
wants to be pro-active in con
fronting the issue. "1 think this is a
trend that is going to accelerate, and
I would rather not limp along."
Whitney proposed several op
tions for gender-neutral accommo
dations, including allowing oppo
site-sex roommate pairing in resi
dences' in-house draws, setting up
gender-neutral housing in a few
residences as a pilot program or
making broader adjustments to the
Draw system as a whole. He said it
was unlikely that any changes
would be in place for next year's
housing arrangements.
"1 don't think it's something you
do with a snap of the fingers," Whit
ney said. "We want to do it right."
Idrisi agreed but said he was still
frustrated with the slow pace of
change.
"Now it's a matter of moving
from talk to action and details," he
said.
