"If you don't have a car, you've
had it." said David Hughes, a junior
who is living off campus this quarter.
"And once you're on campus, there's
really no home to go to between
classes, unless you consider the li
brary your 'home.'"
Last spring, about 820 undergrad
uate students were evicted from on
campus housing by the University
draw. More than 4(H) students still
live off-campus, either renting entire
houses with friends, sharing apart
ments, or leasing single rooms. Their
new addresses extend from Palo
Alto to Mountain View, and result in
an average commute distance of five
miles.
Christine Douglas, a senior who
rents a room in Palo Alto, outlined
the inconveniences she has encoun
tered since moving off-campus: "The
University assumes everyone evict
ed from the housing system has
money because if you need to stay
late on campus, you must own a car.
Since I don't. I leave campus on my
bike before dark. For that reason,
dinner with the I Jniversity food serv
ice is out. And. because 1 can't cook
in my room. I generally eat at Encina
Commons about 4:45 — not exactly
a pleasant routine."
