# Mideast peace talks open with optimism

WASHINGTON (AP) —
After months of frantic diplomacy,
top officials from more than 40 na
tions converge on this historic state
capital Tuesday for what President
Bush hopes will be the launch of
the first Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks in seven years.
Buffeted by skepticism over
prospects the Annapolis Confer
ence can set the stage for the cre
ation of a Palestinian state by the
end of Bush's second term, his ad
ministration has downplayed ex
pectations for major break
throughs but insists the exercise is
not futile.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders
have already said they want to con
clude a bargain within the 14
months that Bush has left in office.
The two sides were unable to
frame a blueprint for the talks be
fore they came to the United
States, and negotiations over the
text were expected to continue
into Tuesday.
At an evening dinner at the
State Department for members of
some 50 delegations invited to the
talks. Bush toasted the effort and
told the guests: "We've come to
gether this week because we share
a common goal: two democratic
states, Israel and Palestine, living
side-by-side in peace and security."
Bush earlier emerged from an
Oval Office meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Hhud Olmert. say
ing he was optimistic.
Next, he met with Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas, who
stressed the need to address issues
of Palestinian statehood, sticking
points that have doomed previous
peace efforts.
At the dinner, host Condoleez
za Rice, the secretary of state, sat
between Olmert and Abbas. Bush
stopped by briefly to share a toast
with the participants, and clinked
glasses with Abbas and Olmert.
They raised their iced tea; for
Bush, it was water. No alcohol was
served out of respect for Muslim
tradition.
Earlier, Olmert said that inter
national support — from Bush
and also, presumably, from the

Arab nations that will attend the
conference — could make this ef
fort succeed where others have
failed.
"This time, it's different be
cause we are going to have a lot of
participation in what 1 hope will
launch a serious process negotia
tion between us and the Palestini
ans," Olmert said. He was referring
to the talks expected to begin in
earnest after this week's IJ.S.-host
ed meetings.
The agreement that was shap
ing up. as Palestinian official Yass
er Abed Rabbo described it. is a
starting point for negotiations and
sketches only vague bargaining
terms. The big questions that have
doomed previous peace efforts
would come later.
The document was to include a
formal announcement of the re
newal of peace talks. Abed Rabbo
said. It will set a target of conclud
ing negotiations before Bush
leaves office in January 2009. And
it commits the two sides to resolv
ing the key issues that divide
them.
Chief Palestinian negotiator
Ahmed Qureia said after an after
noon meeting with Rice, Israeli
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and
others that details of the document
had not been finalized. "Our ef
forts are still going on to reach this
document," he said.
A member of the Palestinian
delegation, speaking on condition
on anonymity, said three main ob
stacles have emerged:
All sides have agreed that two
states should be established, but
the Palestinians have objected to
referring to Israel as a "Jewish
state." TT»e Palestinians and their
Arab backers are concerned that a
specific reference to a Jewish state
would prejudice the right of Pales
tinians who claim a right to return
to land they once owned inside Is
rael.
American and Israeli officials
are resisting Palestinian efforts to
include language about "ending
the occupation that started in
1967," a reference to disputed Jew
ish settlements in the West Bank.

When the presi
dent says,'l am
fully backing this
effort, I will use
every resource,'
how can you not
be confident?"
PRINCE SAUD AL
FAISAL,
Saudi Arabian
foreign minister

The West Bank would form the
hulk of an eventual Palestinian
state and the two sides must decide
which settlements would remain a
part of Israel.
The Palestinians want the docu
ment to set a one-year timetable
for reaching a resolution. The Is
raelis do not want this, and the
Americans are open the idea.
The Palestinian question un
derlies numerous other conflicts
and grievances in the Middle East,
and has scattered hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians across
several Arab states. The Palestini
ans are unlikely to strike any bar
gain that their Arab backers and
neighbors do not support, so the
Annapolis conference is meant to
make Arabs what one administra
tion official called "ground-floor
investors" in the new round of
talks
Saudia Arabia, linchpin of Arab
support for the new peace push,
said it agreed to attend after re
ceiving assurances that the Bush
administration would remain en
ergetic after the talks begin, and in
tervene with its own ideas if neces
sary.
"When the president says I am
fully backing this effort. I will use
every resource ... how can you not
be confident?" asked the king
dom's foreign minister. Prince
Saud al-Faisal.
