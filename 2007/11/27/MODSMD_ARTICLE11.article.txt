# Governor's plan to mandate health insurance faces problems with cost
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — To
bring about universal coverage in
California, Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger says people must
start thinking about health insurance
the way they do auto insurance - as a
responsibility everyone must shoul
der.
In January, Schwarzenegger pro
posed a plan requiring all Californi
ans to have health coverage, promis
ing to spread the cost among individ
uals. businesses, hospitals, insurers
and the government.
But a look at how mandatory in
surance has fared elsewhere, from
Switzerland to Massachusetts, shows
it will not be easy to put into practice
in California.
The reason is mainly the cost.
Health care is a lot cheaper in
countries that have succeeded at im
posing mandates. The average Dutch
resident paid half what a typical
American spent in 2005. while the
average in Switzerland was 70 per
cent.
"If premiums were half the cost in
California, it would be a lot easier to
get everyone covered." said Larry
Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser
Family Foundation, a nonpartisan
health think-tank based in Menlo
Park.
Massachusetts passed a mandato
ry insurance law last year, but high
costs are forcing the state to let more
than 10 percent of the uninsured off
the hook because they can't afford
the premiums.
Experts say medical inflation
means the gap between what most
people can pay and what health care
truly costs is getting wider every
year.
That's why California unions
have been so suspicious of compul
sory insurance and have pushed De

mocrats to demand higher subsidies
for the nearly 5 million residents who
have no insurance on any given day.
Half those people live on less than
twice the federal poverty level, about
$20,000 for a single person and
$41,000 for a family of four -
nowhere near enough to afford the
cost of comprehensive health cover
age.
Employers spend on average
$4,500 a year to insure a single per
son and $12,100 for a family of four.
"If you really are going to make
insurance affordable for all of the
Californians who are uninsured,
given these demographics, it's an ex
pensive proposition," said Marian
Mulkey, an analyst with the Califor
nia Health Care Foundation.
Schwarzenegger's plan has been
pegged at $14 billion a year, and
some experts say the real cost will be
even higher.
Democrats are nervous about
making it mandatory and Republi
cans reject the whole idea of expand
ing government's role in health care.
Even if legislators agree to a deal
with Schwarzenegger, voters would
have to approve new funding for the
plan.

Europeans are more inclined to
tax themselves to fund public pro
grams. A third of the Swiss receive
government subsidies for health cov
erage, as do two-thirds of the Dutch.
Requiring everyone to get a poli
cy spreads the risk across a larger
group.
European countries take this very
seriously. Swiss authorities make
sure everyone has insurance, assign
ing policies to the uninsured, along
with penalties— debt collectors
chase people until they pay.
"There's a cultural tradition of peo
ple feeling that they must have insur
ance, and you're letting your friends
and your neighbors down if you don't,"
said Robert Blendon, a Harvard pro
fessor of health policy. "The idea that
you would go to the doctor or hospital
and tell them you don't have insur
ance, it's unacceptable."
Even before the Swiss made in
surance mandatory a decade ago, 97
percent of the population had a poli
cy. It's now 99 percent.
In the United States, just 85 per
cent had insurance in the latest cen
sus, and just 81 percent of Californi
ans. In Massachusetts, it was 90 per
cent.
