## Editorial Board Victory for science

Embryonic stem cell research has been
highly controversial. Proponents urge
the support of research, citing possi
ble future breakthroughs in medicine. Stem
cells have the ability to generate almost all
cell types in the human body, and thus could
replace diseased, damaged, or dying cells.
11k- findings from stem cell research could
save countless lives and help us learn more
about the nature of diseases. Opponents
lament that in order to save lives in the fu
ture. embryos must be sacrificed now. Em
bryonic stem cells are derived from blasto
cysts. which under normal circumstances
would develop into fetuses but are de
stroyed when harvested for stem cells. But
this moral quandary appears to have been
rendered irrelevant.
A new procedure has changed the field
of stem cell research. Labeled "nuclear re
programming," genes are inserted into fi
broblast skin cells, causing them to lose
their specialization. They imitate stem cells
in the sense that they are in a "pluripotent
state." and can transform into any of 220
cell types found in the human body. This
procedure should pacify those who oppose
embryonic stem cell research on the basis of
harvesting from embryos. Once nuclear re
programming is fully understood, major
roadblocks to progress would disappear.
I Jsing the new technique, researchers in the
U.S. could utilize federal funds and facili
ties, easing dependency on state and private
fundraising.
While the resolution of ethical issues sur
rounding stem cell research is significant
and relieving, it is not the most consequen
tial contribution from the two labs that con
ducted nuclear reprogramming testing in
the U.S. and Japan. Using skin cells to devel
op stem cell lines increases the scientific ca
pability of researchers to experiment and
eventually remedy human suffering. Fibrob
last skin cells are easy to obtain and grow in
culture. Adult cells can be obtained from a
skin biopsy using a method no more painful

than a blood draw.The new technique is sim
pler and more precisely controlled than the
prevailing method using stem cells from em
bryos. The Japanese team used just four
gene-controlling proteins to induce the skin
cells to behave pluripotently.
In addition, pluripotent cells produced
using nuclear reprogramming are patient
specific. They have the exact same genetic
material as their prospective hosts and thus
would not be rejected by the immune sys
tem. This aspect is crucial for one possible
use of stem cell technology — regenerative
tissue transplanting. The new technique is a
huge advance in stem cell science; efforts to
produce such a cell for humans have been
thwarted thus far. although the search is as
siduously conducted. Readers may remem
ber that in 2(K)6 it was discovered that the
South Korean biomedical scientist Hwang
Woo-Suk falsified claims of creating cloned
human embryonic stem cells. If nuclear re
programming can eventually be mastered
and deemed safe, the search will cease.
Nuclear reprogramming has already
achieved spectacular feats. Researchers
used the transformed skin cells to produce
human brain and heart tissue. Cells induced
to form heart tissue started beating in the
laboratory after 12 days.
Stem cell research has arrived at a new
crossroads. While relevant in the US. to re
search institutions such as Stanford, the end
of the ethical debate is secondary to the new
scientific potential of stem cell research. Nu
clear reprogramming will allow scientists to
easily furbish stem cells, which could result
in organ replacements without the fear of
rejection and the cure to such diseases as
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Scientists,now
able to focus on their specialty, may find an
other debate on their hands: who should re
ceive federal funding to advance this highly
promising new generation of stem cell re
search? Stanford, with its resources and
human capital, appears well poised and as
likely a recipient as any.
