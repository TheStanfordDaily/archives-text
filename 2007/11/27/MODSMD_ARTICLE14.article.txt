# Fish out of Water
## Go-go queen 
### 
Oh. the holidays. Most families like to
use Thanksgiving as a time to sit
around the table and say how thank
ful they are for one another. My family likes
to use the holiday as a time to make fun of
me. and ridicule my illustrious childhood
acting career.
Hey. I'm always game for a little self
deprecation. But some memories are sa
cred. I specially ones that involve having
your llollvwood-bound hopes and dreams
demolished by the onslaught of braces at
age 13.
When it accidentally happens to come
out that I was a child star in, say, cocktail
conversations, classroom icebreakers, job
interviews and Daily columns, I'll casually
mention that 1 may have been on Sesame
Street, and been just a "Parent Trap" call
back or two away from being, you know,
Lindsay Lohan.
A recent Thanksgiving dinner conversa
tion regarding the release of the earliest
Sesame Street episodes on DVD would
have been a perfect time for such anecdotes
to likewise casually emerge. Unfortunately,
for my mother and sister, it also represent
ed the perfect time to mock my singing and
dancing talents, and marvel at how I ever
made it onto the Sesame Street 25th An
niversary Special in the first place.
As 1 watched the table of friends and
kindhearted strangers, whom I had been
planning to wow. explode into merciless
laughter. I decided to put my star power to
the test once and for all that weekend.
While perhaps delusional, I did realize
that my rusty acting and tap dancing skills
could never measure up to their past glory
after such a long and tortured eight-year
hiatus. There was only one remaining op
tion: to test my inherent stage power in the
raw.
And so. 1 found myself Saturday after
noon heading downtown to Manhattan's
School of Burlesque to see if I could hold
my own in a class called, ahem. "Go-Go
Moves for Go-Go Gals."
Although I'm a fan of any situation that
makes wearing tall boots with short skirts
socially acceptable, I also felt like the in
structor Angie was someone who could re
ally relate to my youthful brush with fame.
()ne of the "World Famous Pontani Sisters,"
according to her online bio, Angie had
made a name for herself in the burlesque
scene before she was even old enough to
enter a nightclub.

Having nabbed Coney Island's Miss Cy
clone 2007, Angie was faring in the business
a bit better than I, but I figured she still
might be sympathetic to my plight. And, you
know, help me resurrect my childhood act
ing career as an adult go-go dancer or some
thing.
Arriving at the class that day, I was re
lieved to see that the competition didn't
look too fierce. Wearing street clothes and
sneakers, none of the students looked any
better off than I did, so I figured my talent
was in the clear.
Angie began the lesson walking us
through basic moves like the "Sammy
Davis, Jr." and the "Stoplight" — moves
that looked and felt pretty easy until 1 actu
ally caught a glance of myself in the stage
mirror, and saw what I was doing.
While no one in the class looked that
good, I looked like one of those grooms-to
be who have to be dragged to six weeks of
dancing classes just to get the vaguest hint of
rhythm and coordination. 1 thought back on
every time I had ever danced in public, and
shuddered.
By the time we moved on to learning a
full-on. choreographed dance called the
"Kitty Cat", I was feeling pretty self-con
scious about my 'skillz.' Bui after practicing
to the song "Do the Kitty Cat" a few times, I
found myself getting into all the tail-shaking
and claw-scratching my uncoordinated
body could muster.
Saturday afternoon may have been the
last day I ever decide to dance in public.
But there are still some things that I'm
grateful for this Thanksgiving. Hey, I may
be a horrible singer, actor, and go-go
dancer. But if at this point I've avoided co
caine. multiple rehab stints, and a rivalry
with Hilary Duff, maybe missing out on all
those Us Weekly covers wasn't such a
tragedy after all.
