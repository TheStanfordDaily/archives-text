## Law school admissions: Secrets from the inside 
### 
Hi. I'm Vishnu Sridharan. You may re
member me from such columns as
"Has Anyone Seen My Cell Phone?
It's Grey and Says Verizon on It."and "Ath
letic, Funny ABCD Looking for Athletic.
Funny ABCD: Mirrors Welcome."
Today. I'm here to talk about a topic that
I'm sure is on a number of your minds, espe
cially with law school application deadlines
rapidly approaching: how to get into Stan
ford Law School. If the topic isn't on your
minds, it should be. because you probably
don't have the commitment to isolation and
irrelevancy that it takes to be a Ph.D. student,
and your MCAT scores are likely too low to
get into a 'Top 10" med school, which is all
your fragile ego can tolerate. (For those of
you thinking about an M.B.A.,don't fret, one
comes in the mail every Thursday along with
Safeway coupons — the coupons being the

more useful).
Luckily for you, as someone who once
was and still is in your shoes — I'm a public
interest lawyer, my shoes are in tatters — I
can tell you the four key factors to getting
into SLS:
l.The I S AT.
Contrary to the advice that the Kaplanites
or Reviewers from Princetonia might give, 1
think the key to owning the LSAT is focusing

on form over substance. When all is said and
done, certain letter combinations are more
likely to be correct than others. No-brainers
include 'ACE', which is how you're trying
perform on the test,'AßE'. America's most
beloved lawyer-president, and, since you're
trying to get into law school. 'AA' will be
clutch. Ones to avoid: 'EEC', for its ono
matopoeic similarity to "EEK!", 'CAD',
which, as OED tells us. means 'A fellow of
low vulgar manners and behavior', and. of
course,'BAD'. (BTW. if you have 'OED' on
your answer sheet, you have more serious
problems that I can address).
2. The Personal Statement.
Keep it short.
For best effect 1 would leave it at that, but


Vishnu
Sridharan
since I get paid by the word, I'll elab
orate. The people who review your
application have thousands of es
says to read, and you don't want to
bore them like everyone else will.To
really stick out from the pack, I sug
gest limiting your personal state
ment to one sentence; if you have a
lot to say, you can use a colon and
parentheses. For instance, one of the
best personal statements I've come
across read simply:"! taste great and
I'm less filling (that's what she said):
Maybe I'm born with it, maybe it's
Maybelline."
3. Letters of Recommendation.
You're right in thinking that your
recommendations usually don't

mean anything to those reviewing
your file,and that they will most like
ly be set on fire m order to more eas
ily light larger things on fire. I*hat
being said, in cases of tie-breakers
between two applicants, reviewers
are known to whip these out and see
whose is longer, so be prepared.
I think the best way to get a mem
orable recommendation is to have
either your mom or that kid you bul
lied in grade school write it. Moms
are good because nothing says
'something that the reviewer won't
get from the rest of your application'
like that story about the time you
self-defecated in your youth-soccer
league match and kept running while
it trickled down your leg and every
one thought it was mud until you
slide-tackled that kid and he fell
face-first onto your fecal-mud legs.
Priceless!
If at all possible, though, I'd go
with a recommendation from the kid

you physically abused and robbed in
elementary school. 1 mean, what
could better show that you have the
qualities to make a good lawyer?
4. Stop riding your hikes in the SLS
arcade!
We have cameras, and we're wire
tapping your phone. While you're at
it, get out of our library. You may
have always wanted to visit France,
but I doubt you'll enjoy it as much
when it's just a short layover on your
SLS-sponsored trip to Ethiopia for
some 'enhanced interrogation'.
So, that's the high and low of the
application process. Have you been
listening, you lovely law school aspi
rants? Are you in yet?
That's what she said. (BTW, 1
was.)

If you are, in fact, not in yet, let Vishnu
know ut vishnus@stanford.eilu, and
he'll see what he can do.
