## Law school admissions: Secrets from the inside 
### 
Hi. I'm Vishnu Sridharan. You may re
member me from such columns as
"Has Anyone Seen My Cell Phone?
It's Grey and Says Verizon on It."and "Ath
letic, Funny ABCD Looking for Athletic.
Funny ABCD: Mirrors Welcome."
Today. I'm here to talk about a topic that
I'm sure is on a number of your minds, espe
cially with law school application deadlines
rapidly approaching: how to get into Stan
ford Law School. If the topic isn't on your
minds, it should be. because you probably
don't have the commitment to isolation and
irrelevancy that it takes to be a Ph.D. student,
and your MCAT scores are likely too low to
get into a 'Top 10" med school, which is all
your fragile ego can tolerate. (For those of
you thinking about an M.B.A.,don't fret, one
comes in the mail every Thursday along with
Safeway coupons — the coupons being the

more useful).
Luckily for you, as someone who once
was and still is in your shoes — I'm a public
interest lawyer, my shoes are in tatters — I
can tell you the four key factors to getting
into SLS:
l.The I S AT.
Contrary to the advice that the Kaplanites
or Reviewers from Princetonia might give, 1
think the key to owning the LSAT is focusing

on form over substance. When all is said and
done, certain letter combinations are more
likely to be correct than others. No-brainers
include 'ACE', which is how you're trying
perform on the test,'AßE'. America's most
beloved lawyer-president, and, since you're
trying to get into law school. 'AA' will be
clutch. Ones to avoid: 'EEC', for its ono
matopoeic similarity to "EEK!", 'CAD',
which, as OED tells us. means 'A fellow of
low vulgar manners and behavior', and. of
course,'BAD'. (BTW. if you have 'OED' on
your answer sheet, you have more serious
problems that I can address).
2. The Personal Statement.
Keep it short.
For best effect 1 would leave it at that, but
