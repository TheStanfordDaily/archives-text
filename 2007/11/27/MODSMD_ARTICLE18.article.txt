## Menu labeling: Too much information? 
### 
The holiday season is a notorious har
binger of expanding waistlines and
skyrocketing blood sugar levels, often
resulting in New Year's resolutions and new
(or renewed) gym memberships. America's
weight problem has long been a public health
concern, and New York City Health Com
missioner Thomas Frieden is taking decisive
measures to lower the obesity rate. Having
tasted success with the passage of a ban on
the use of trans fats in New York City restau
rants that spread nationwide, Frieden has set
his sights on enforcing restaurant menus in
dicating caloric content.
According to the New York City Depart
ment of Health. Frieden's proposal would
mandate restaurants with 15 or more chains
nationwide to list caloric content on their
menu boards.This measure is a revision of an
earlier proposal which garnered a lawsuit

from the New York State Restaurant Associ
ation and was vetoed by a federal judge. SB
120, a similar menu-labeling bill for Califor
nia. was vetoed in October by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
In a recent interview segment of "60
Minutes." Frieden staunchly defended
menu labeling as an important first step to
helping consumers make healthy meal
choices and combating the problem of obe
sity. Frieden is convinced that caloric infor
mation will clear up rampant misconcep
tions in separating the choices that only
seem healthy from those that are actually
healthy. He cited an example in which a cus
tomer at Subway might choose a tuna sand
wich over a preferred roast beef sandwich
under the impression that tuna is healthier,
when in reality the roast beef is lower in
calories.

Frieden's proposal would he of great util
ity to many fast food patrons — whether
they are on a strict diet regimen or simply
seeking a healthy lunch option. As noted by
Frieden, while several fast food chains have
already made this information available to
the public, it is not practical to access a Web
site to obtain this nutritional information.
Furthermore, he hopes mandated calorie
counting will encourage restaurants to
reevaluate their meal items and consider
healthier ingredients.
However, while menu labeling would pro
vide a very convenient location for calorie in
formation, such an in-your-face display
would result in a very poor dining experience
for patrons who are unconcerned with calo
rie counts. The meal choices of such con-
sumers are not likely to be changed
by nutritional information and most,
if not all consumers, do have a rough
idea of what is and isn't healthy as ar
ticulated by Richard Berman in
"Americans Should Still Have a
Right to Guilt Free Eating."
As the New York State Restau
rant Association pointed out in its
lawsuit, the proposal unfairly targets
fast food chains that have voluntari
ly provided such nutritional infor
mation under the premise that they
should post this information on their
menu boards since they have already
done the calculations. Delis and Chi
nese restaurants are among those
untouched by the measure. If the
goal is to empower customers to
make informed meal decisions, why
restrict regulations to restaurant
chains? Why not regulate all restau
rants? The New York Department of
Health reports that the measure

would only apply to 10 percent of
New York restaurants. As opponents
such as Herman point out, Ameri
cans can consume just as many un
healthy calories in a plate of chow
mein as a Big Mac.
Thus, with a diverse consumer
base, legislation should attempt to
better accommodate diners from all
regions of the health-conscious
spectrum. For example, sit-down
restaurants could print menus with
and without caloric information and
ask patrons which menu they would
prefer. Fast food venues, valued for
their expediency,could provide such
information on-site, in the form of
easily accessible posters or conven
ient pamphlets and make sure that
patrons are aware that such infor
mation is available. This way, those
who wunt to know how many grams
of fat they will be consuming can
easily access the information, while
those who prefer to eat "guilt-free"
need not be burdened by ominous
calorie figures or the guilt of indul
gence.
Which eateries will be the next
targets of menu labeling? College

dining halls? Hospital cafeterias? In
these situations, it would be incredi
bly difficult to compute the caloric
value of each dish, as menus change
daily. If menu labeling were imple
mented in such cases, culinary diver
sity would have to be sacrificed at
dining locations where variety is
most valued.
Ultimately, public health comes
down to more than healthy eating
choices. The public needs to be re
minded of the necessity of a healthy
lifestyle which includes exercise,
portion control and good lifestyle
decisions.
Frieden's goal of making restau
rant nutritional information more
accessible to the public will undoubt
edly help health-conscious con
sumers make more informed deci
sions. Nevertheless, his proposal
should be less intrusive to those who
want to enjoy a guiltless McFlurry at
the end of a long day.
