## Menu labeling: Too much information? 
### 
The holiday season is a notorious har
binger of expanding waistlines and
skyrocketing blood sugar levels, often
resulting in New Year's resolutions and new
(or renewed) gym memberships. America's
weight problem has long been a public health
concern, and New York City Health Com
missioner Thomas Frieden is taking decisive
measures to lower the obesity rate. Having
tasted success with the passage of a ban on
the use of trans fats in New York City restau
rants that spread nationwide, Frieden has set
his sights on enforcing restaurant menus in
dicating caloric content.
According to the New York City Depart
ment of Health. Frieden's proposal would
mandate restaurants with 15 or more chains
nationwide to list caloric content on their
menu boards.This measure is a revision of an
earlier proposal which garnered a lawsuit

from the New York State Restaurant Associ
ation and was vetoed by a federal judge. SB
120, a similar menu-labeling bill for Califor
nia. was vetoed in October by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
In a recent interview segment of "60
Minutes." Frieden staunchly defended
menu labeling as an important first step to
helping consumers make healthy meal
choices and combating the problem of obe
sity. Frieden is convinced that caloric infor
mation will clear up rampant misconcep
tions in separating the choices that only
seem healthy from those that are actually
healthy. He cited an example in which a cus
tomer at Subway might choose a tuna sand
wich over a preferred roast beef sandwich
under the impression that tuna is healthier,
when in reality the roast beef is lower in
calories.

Frieden's proposal would he of great util
ity to many fast food patrons â€” whether
they are on a strict diet regimen or simply
seeking a healthy lunch option. As noted by
Frieden, while several fast food chains have
already made this information available to
the public, it is not practical to access a Web
site to obtain this nutritional information.
Furthermore, he hopes mandated calorie
counting will encourage restaurants to
reevaluate their meal items and consider
healthier ingredients.
However, while menu labeling would pro
vide a very convenient location for calorie in
formation, such an in-your-face display
would result in a very poor dining experience
for patrons who are unconcerned with calo
rie counts. The meal choices of such con-
