## HORNET HOOPLA Stanford hosts Sac State tonight 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford basketball will look to get back to its open
ing-weekend dominance when Sacramento State visits
Maples Pavilion tonight at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal (6-1) started off the season well, sweep
ing the Basketball Travelers Classic convincingly, beating
Harvard. Northwestern State and UC-Santa Barbara by
an average of 34 points. The team climbed to No. 20 na
tionally and gave its fans reason to think a squad that re
turned every scholarship player from last year's NCAA
team was ready to take the next step.
But the next 16 days were not as kind to Stanford.
Ugly 11-point wins against undermanned Northwestern
and Yale sandwiched the true heartbreaker: a 79-67 loss
at Siena. ITiough Siena has a sub-200 RPI (which will
cause the NCAA committee to judge the loss harshly at
the end of the season), the Saints are a perennial postsea
son contender with solid fundamentals, and a 10 a.m. PST
tip in Albany. N.Y..some 3.000 miles away from the Farm
was brutal. So the concern isn't as much that Stanford
lost, but how it happened: the team looked lethargic and
played complacently, settling for 31 three-point attempts
on offense and drawing only three free throw attempts.
Still, Stanford rebounded with a 73-53 win over Col
orado State on Saturday, when sophomore center Robin
Lopez had the most dominant game of his Cardinal ca
reer. He looks more comfortable this year than during a
freshman season that saw foul trouble too often outshine
his suffocating post defense — he even drained his only
three-point try of the season on Saturday.
Junior Lawrence Hill, a first team All-Pac-10 forward
last year, has also come on strong after a slow start: he
now averages 10 points per game on 52 percent shooting,
behind only Robin Lopez (12 points, seven rebounds)
and junior guard Anthony Goods (13 points). Sopho
more wing Landry Fields (nine points, 40 percent from
beyond the arc) is developing into a complementary

GiUE NOTES: The men's basketball team will be looking for its seventh
win of the season and third in a row tonight against Sacramento State.
The Cardinal's only loss of 2007 came last week against Siena, and
the team is the heavy favorite in tonight's contest. So far in the presea
son, Anthony Goods and Robin Lopez are averaging 12.5 and 12 .3
points per game, respectively, and Lawrence Hill is also averaging dou
ble-digit scoring with 10.2 per game.

Junior Lawrence Hill is averaging over 10 points per game this season, one
of three Stanford players in double digits. The Cardinal hosts a struggling
Sacramento State team tonight whose only win is over NCCAA Simpson.
perimeter threat to Goods, though
he will need to continue to improve
defensively.
Coach Trent Johnson's first three
Stanford teams all kicked off their
seasons sluggishly, so he must be
feeling good about the 6-1 mark. It's
his best start on the Farm, and soph
omore Brook Lopez, the team's
likely NBA lottery pick, is still
watching from the sidelines due to
academic ineligibility,
Sacramento State, meanwhile,
did down Simpson University beau
tifully, 104-71. two weeks ago. Of
course. Redding. Calif.-based Simp
son University is in the NCCAA
the National Christian Collegiate
Athletic Association. Against Divi
sion I-A foes, however, the Hornets

(1-5) have had less success. They're
winless. with no more than 65 points
in any contest.
Such is life for the Big Sky team
that finished 10-19 last year, which
also has visits to Oregon and Mar
quette on its preseason schedule
They get a guaranteed paycheck, the
big school gets a near-guaranteed
win. If Sacramento State is to make
a run though, guards Loren l.eath
(19 points per game) and Vinnie
McCihee. Jr. (II points, six assists)
will have to play the games of their
lives.
The tallest Hornet tops out at 6-
foot-B,so Stanford should he able to
take advantage of that by pounding
it inside,waiting for the double team
and then kicking it out for open
threes. In any case, the Cardinal
should have little trouble against the
I lornets tonight.
