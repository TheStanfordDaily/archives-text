Alter a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) shat
ters on the floor, some students may choose to clean
up the shards and throw them in the trash. But ac
cording to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and California law,all fluorescent lamps and
tubes are considered hazardous waste when dis
carded because they contain mercury.
For the first time this year. Student 1 lousing, in
conjunction with Residential Education and Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford, distributed over
7,(XX) CFLs to Stanford students and affiliates in an
effort to promote energy conservation. Each CFL
bulb given to students contains about five mil
ligrams of mercury.

Student Housing has taken certain measures to
educate dorm staff in order to comply with Califor
nia state law and promote safe disposal of CFLs.
"We have given all dorm housing front desks
cleaning instructions and Ziploc bags in case of bro
ken CFL bulbs,"said Sustainability and Utilities Co
ordinator of Student Housing Nik Kaestner. "Also,
we will be running more ads in The Daily later as an
ongoing effort to remind people of safe disposal."
