## Energy-efficient bulbs necessitate mindful clean-up Broken CFLs leak mercury, caution urged 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Alter a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) shat
ters on the floor, some students may choose to clean
up the shards and throw them in the trash. But ac
cording to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and California law,all fluorescent lamps and
tubes are considered hazardous waste when dis
carded because they contain mercury.
For the first time this year. Student 1 lousing, in
conjunction with Residential Education and Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford, distributed over
7,(XX) CFLs to Stanford students and affiliates in an
effort to promote energy conservation. Each CFL
bulb given to students contains about five mil
ligrams of mercury.

Student Housing has taken certain measures to
educate dorm staff in order to comply with Califor
nia state law and promote safe disposal of CFLs.
"We have given all dorm housing front desks
cleaning instructions and Ziploc bags in case of bro
ken CFL bulbs,"said Sustainability and Utilities Co
ordinator of Student Housing Nik Kaestner. "Also,
we will be running more ads in The Daily later as an
ongoing effort to remind people of safe disposal."

dents for a Sustainable Stanford that coordinated

the distribution of CFLs. also distrib
uted flyers to all of its Green Campus
Representatives containing informa
tion about the safe disposal of broken
CFLs.
Yost House Representative
Rachel Friedman '08 said that she
passed this critical information on to
students.
"1 tried to warn every person
whom I gave a bulb to about the mer
cury disposal procedure," she said.
In the cases of dorms without
Green Campus Representatives, the
Resident Assistants (R As) passed out
and recorded the number of students
who received CFLs.
"The RAs should have the right
information as well." said Kevan
Christensen MO, the director of the
Green Living Council."It doesn't re
quire a professional to get rid of the
mercury. If students are uncertain
how to handle the broken bulb, they
should contact the dorm housing
front desk."
So what should you do if you break
a CFL bulb in your room?
According to the EPA's Energy
Star, one should ventilate the room
for 15 minutes or more, use gloves to
carefully scoop up the fragments with
stiff paper.place them in a sealed plas
tic bag and give the bag to the housing
front desk. Avoid vacuuming if possi
ble, but if vacuuming is necessary,
then remove the vacuum bag after the
fact and place the debris in a sealed
plastic bag as well.
