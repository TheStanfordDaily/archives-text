Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actual
strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they could
beat the team below them.
Rank Last Week Comment
1. Ohio State 3 Power Poll takes a one-week break for Thanksgiving and
guess who's back on top.
2. LSI) 2 They say every team has an Achilles' heel. Apparently the
Tigers' is triple overtime.
3. West Virginia 12 Rodriguez knows style points count as 'Eers run it up
against Connecticut in a major way.
4. USC 8 My two least favorite schools in the country are USC and
Notre Dame. But folks, USC is back.
5. Georgia 10 Moreno, Stafford made it rain on a good Georgia Tech D.'
BCS at-lorge for country's most balanced 'o.'
6. Virginia Tech 7 End of the season, and what do you know? ACC's best team
is going to play for the title.
7. Oklahoma 4 Ditto. Everyone jumped ship too quickly after early stum
bles from USC, West Virginia, Georgia, Sooners.
8. Missouri 5 I'm Missouri on Missouri: show me Saturday. My guess-.
Oklahoma clobbers the Tigers. Daniel for Heisman!
9. Florida 9 Tebow's hand is broken, but Florida says he should be okay
for bowl game. Might cost him the Heisman though.
10. Arizona State 11 Did anyone really expect anything different (lots of points,
comfortable USC 'W') against the Trojans?
11. Kansas 6 Here's BCS at-large number two. Three is Arizona State and
four is Hawaii.
12. Boston College 16 Matt Ryan has one last hurrah at the Heisman. Virginia
Tech needs to rush more than three, unlike last time.
13. Illinois 18 Could take that final BCS slot from ASU, depending on pol
itics. Zook shedding his label as an awful coach?
14. Wisconsin 13 Struggled with Minnesota, but another ho-hum 9-3 sea
son for the Cheeseheads. See Clemson.
15. Texas 15 Under 20 minutes of possession in Texas A&M loss! Ugly,
ugly season for Mack Brown, and no VY to save him.
16. Hawaii 23 Top son the islands, top 50 off it. Washington's visit this
week now for all the BCS marbles.
17. Tennessee 17 Whew. Four overtimes later, SEC title game here we come.
What's with the SEC and multiple overtimes?
18. Oregon 1 A healthy Dixon (or even Leaf) would have beaten UCLA,
no problem. Instead, it's another USC Rose Bowl.
19. Clemson 19 What a quiet 9-3 season. Beat no ranked teams, and high
est-profile win probably Florida State in opener.
20. Auburn NR Saban compared 'Bama's loss to UL-Monroe to 9/11 and
Pearl Harbor. What's the Auburn loss metaphor?
21. Boise State 25 Showed up well enough on the islands, plus they get bonus
points for last year's Fiesta Bowl.
22. Cincinnati 20 Think they showed Connecticut, nation, who the key play
er was in the Big East. BCS for Bearcats?
23. Virginia 21 Dream season runs out of gas in season's biggest game.
24. Arkansas NR Houston Nutt, Phil Fulmer and Lloyd Cam three men who
do less with more.
25. NR 9-2 overall, but the nation's only undefeated team in-con
ference, save for Hawaii and Troy.
