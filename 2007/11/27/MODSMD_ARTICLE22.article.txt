11/20 vs. Hawaii W6-1 SjjHtl?
GAME NOTES: Over Thanksgiving break, the Stanford men's tennis
team closed out its fall season with a win over an undermanned
Hawaii squad which had to forfeit two matches. The Cardinal
now enters its two-month offseason before starting up again in
January at the Sherwood Cup.

The Stanford men's tennis team enjoyed a holiday
in Hawaii highlighted by an impressive non-confer
ence victory over the University of Hawaii last Tues
day. The Cardinal traveled over 2,(MX) miles to Hawaii
on Nov. 17 and played the Warriors last TUesday in
Maui at the Wailea Tennis Club. The team won 6-1
and ended its fall season on a positive note.
"I thought the match went well " assistant coach
Brandon Coupe said, who traveled with the team in
the place of absent head coach John Whitlinger. "It
was a tough day with conditions not ideal for great
tennis. It was windy and the courts were not laid out
like traditional college courts [where the courts are
situated right next to each other).
"Days like that are more of a mental battle and I
thought we did well mentally in the
match and the guys fought hard. It
was a good start to the season."
Hawaii had only five players el
igible to play, which meant they for
feited No. 6 singles and No. 3 dou
bles. Stanford only had to win one
doubles match to secure the dou
bles point, and junior Matt Bruch
and freshman Alex Clayton did just
that. The duo defeated Sasha
Heinemann and Andreas Weber, 8-
5. Junior Blake Muller and fresh
man Ted Kelly, who had only been
defeated once this fall in doubles,
dropped a tough decision to
Spence Mendoza and Jeff Fitch, 9-
8.
In singles action, Clayton,
Muller. Kelly and sophomore
Richard Wire all won their matches
in straight sets. Bruch dropped his
match at the No. 1 singles spot to
Weber in three sets, 6-3,4-6,4-6.
At No. 4 singles, Muller was
more fortunate, blanking Mendoza
6-0,6-0.
"I got out to a good start and I
didn't want to let him back in the
match," Muller said.
In addition to playing Hawaii,
the team taught clinics all week at
Maui's Wailea Tennis Club. Coupe
pointed out that in addition to
helping others with their game,
teaching helps the players realize
aspects of their game that they can
work on and improve.
Overall, the team enjoyed its
week in tropical paradise.
"The trip was a really good
time," Muller said. "We got to hit
with alumni and had a lot of free
time. It was also fun to bond togeth
er before the season starts."
Stanford also got some good
news over the break in terms of re
cruiting. Ryan Thacher. the top
ranked recruit in the nation, and
Bradley Klahn.the fifth-ranked re
cruit, both signed with Stanford

and will join the squad next year.
"We're very excited to have [the
guys] join our program," head
coach John Whitlinger told
GoStanford.com. "They will both
have an immediate impact on our
team [next year]."
The team has now concluded its

fall season and will be off for over a
month. The Cardinal's quest to re
turn to the NCAA Championships
begins in January with the Sher
wood Cup.
