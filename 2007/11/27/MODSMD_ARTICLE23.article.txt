## Michigan fans set an example 
### 
Igrew up a Michigan football fan,
idolizing stars such as Braylon Ed
wards, Charles Woodson and
Lamarr Woodley. This year, when I was
offered the chance to go to Ann Arbor
to see Michigan play its archrival, Ohio
State, 1 jumped at the opportunity.
The game itself was a wash. It was
one of the most poorly played football
games I have ever seen — each pass
seemed to either slip from a receiver's
hand or sail over his head. Michigan's
best player, by far, was its punter. The
Wolverines lost the game more than the
Buckeyes won it. The final score was an
ugly 14-3.
The beauty of the weekend, though,
was the atmosphere before the game it
self. In their equivalent of Big Game
week. Michigan students tailgated for
days beforehand, the culmination of the
festivities coming on Saturday morning.
I was awoken at 6:30 a.m.. the crack
of dawn. At Michigan. "Saturday morn
ing is the best night of the week."
I headed over to a friend's apartment,
passing people who had adorned them
selves with all types of body art. Fans
had shaved their hair into the Michigan
"M" and the shape of the Wolverines'
helmet design. Their entire bodies were
painted blue and maize.
The game was declared a "Maize-
Out," so all fans were instructed to wear
gold shirts to the game. Lacking cloth
ing of that color. 1 headed out to find a
street vendor. 1 bought a shirt that said,
"Buck the Fuckeyes." It wasn't even
close to the most vulgar —or most
clever — T-shirt available.
We headed down South State Street,
a mix between The Row and White
Plaza. Fraternity after fraternity opened
their doors, blasting as much music as
they could, as loudly as they could.
Brothers played football on the lawns.
Every time Buckeye fans passed a
house, they were booed mercilessly
When a female Michigan fan was seen
holding hands with a Buckeye support
er — a sin worse than a Montague walk
ing arm-and-arm with a Capulet — one
particularly inebriated fellow implored
her to dump the "inbred, illiterate
loser."
We went to AEPi. where the broth
ers had taken two gutted cars, painted
them red and white (Ohio State's col
ors) and flipped them over. ITiey spent
their morning jumping on top of them.
But the mood was more pro-Michi
gan than anti-Ohio State. Everywhere
we went, cheers of "Hail to the Victors,"
Michigan's fight song, broke out. Stu
dents discussed current strategy, pro
gram history and future prospects.
Alums offered hot dogs to strangers,
knowing that, above all on this day, they
were connected through Michigan foot
ball. The most diehard fans camped out
in the cold for two nights to be on Col
lege Gameday. ESPN's college football
talk show.
We walked toward the stadium.stop
ping to watch the band's drum line per
form. Cheerleaders did impromptu rou
tines in the street. Eventually, the crowd
turned toward the Big House, Michigan
Stadium, where their beloved Wolver
ines awaited. We entered the student
section, 50,000 people strong.The atten
dance for the day was a hair under
112.000 — as big as a decent-sized
army. When the team entered, the sound
that arose was nothing short of deafen
ing. These gridiron heroes were heading
into a contest they were expected to
lose, but they had an entire stadium be
hind them.
Even as the game degenerated into a
comedy of errors, and the temperature
dropped to below freezing and a mix
ture of rain and hail fell from the sky, not
one person moved. These were their
Wolverines, and they would stand with
them until the final whistle.
Our own Big Game now approaches
—my first — and while I'm hopeful,
I'm not sure what to expect. Attendance
at football games is lacking, but it is ap
parently better than in past years. The
Athletic Department has expanded the
Red Zone to accommodate more stu
dents. And as 1 returned to campus yes
terday. "Go Stanford" and "Beat Cal"
signs abounded.
But the atmosphere around football
games has never been like it was at
Michigan and other schools around the
country.
This is. of course, to be expected —
Michigan is a perennial powerhouse
and one of the top football schools in
the country. But for this game — our
biggest — perhaps we can emulate
them.
When our Cardinal enters the field
this Saturday, let's have the entire Stan
ford community — not just the football
diehards — behind them.
Let's paint ourselves Cardinal red
and lose our voices in cheer. Let's stand,
students with alumni,fans with fans,and
back our team. Let us be a true 12th
man; let us be a difference-maker.

Wyndam Makowsky is a frcslinmn who
