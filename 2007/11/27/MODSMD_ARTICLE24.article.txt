# Soccer beats Cal, but no tourney
## Men upset Bears in season finale, but are not chosen for postseason 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Realistically, Stanford men's soccer team
knew that its Nov. 17 match with No. 20 Califor
nia would likely be its season finale. But, that
didn't stop the Cardinal (7-6-5. 4-4-2 Pacific
-10) from believing it was a premature ending.
In capturing a 1-0 victory over the Golden
Bears (11-5-2, 6-3-1 Pac-10) just before
Thanksgiving break, Stanford also claimed
part of a three-way tie for second place in the
Pacific-10 Conference. Despite the team's win
over Cal, they were not invited to compete in
the NCAA's playoffs.
Looking back on early ties with No. 3 Santa
Clara and No. 13 UC-Santa Barbara, the team's
inclusion in the NCAA College Cup could be
persuasively argued, despite its overall record.
Instead. Stanford was passed over by the selec
tion committee in favor of Cal, UCLA (8-8-3,
4-4-2 Pac-10) and Washington (8-7-4,3-4-3 Pac
-10).
"We are a little disappointed at not being in
the playoffs," head coach Bret Simon said. "The
nature of men's Division I soccer is that the
teams are very even... so anything can happen
in almost any game. That leaves you with the
feeling that on your best days you can beat any
opponent, which in turn makes you wish we
were still competing."
Stanford proved its ability to battle the best
throughout the season, as it managed at least
one win against each of the conference's other
three top teams. Saturday's meeting with the
Bears demonstrated the Cardinal's capabilities
once again.
"The final game versus Cal was typical of
our Pac-10 games this year," Simon said." 11 was
very even and extremely competitive. Both
teams had several opportunities that could
have led to goals."
In the first half, Stanford notched seven
shots to Cal's five.The Cardinal was led by Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year Bobby Warshaw's
three attempts, but he was unable to find the
net. Sophomore keeper John Moore, mean
while, thwarted shots on goal by two of Cal's
leading scorers, freshman Andrew Wiedeman
and senior Javier Ayala-Hill.

The Bears took six more shots in the open
ing 15 minutes of the second period, but in the
62nd minute, it was Stanford who finally took
the lead. Redshirt senior Kyle Hency found
sophomore Thiago Sa Freire, who capitalized
on the opportunity by hitting the top left corner
for his first goal of the season.
All-Pac-10 senior Scott Bolkan noted the
teamwork that led to Sa Freire's score.
"In both halves. 1 think we kept possession of
the ball in their half very well," Bolkan said.
"With all the skill we have in our attacking play
ers, we knew if we kept it up throughout the
game we'd get some dangerous chances. Kyle
did some great work to set up the opportunity
and Thiago saw his chance and finished it."
Simon similarly saluted both Hency's assist and
Sa Freire's execution of the game's only goal.
"The game winner from Thiago was really
the result of a great build-up and Kyle I lency's
strong position in front of the Cal goal," he said.
"[Hency] laid off a beautiful ball for Thiagoand
he struck a perfect shot."
Equally deserving of recognition, though,
was the defense's ability to shut down Wiede
man and Ayala-I fill, who combined for a fruit
less nine shots. Ayala-I lill posted two of those
shots in a last-ditch effort in the match's closing
minutes.
Bolkan said Stanford's defensive success
came from locking down around the 18-yard
box.
"Our defense was able to stay compact near
our 18. and it forced them to take shots from
well outside our box," he said. "Then, the times
that they did manage to slip through the cracks,
we always had [ Moore] in goal to come up with
some very big saves."
Bolkan and the other seniors thought of the
Cal game as a fitting, if bittersweet, end to their
Stanford careers.
"It's unfortunate we had another over-.500
season and a second-place finish in the Pac-10,
and we didn't make the tournament," Bolkan
said. "But, as my last game for Stanford. 1
couldn't ask for a better ending. 1 wish I could
come back and play another year, though. The
team will be very good for several years to
come."
Simon and the underclassmen are already
looking toward this bright future, as they begin
off-season training today

Cal's potent attack in a 1-0 win last week. Even so, Stanford did not make the NCAA draw.
