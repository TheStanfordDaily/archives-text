## Power outage on Row shows strength of emergency response 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
When a tree limb broke and fell
across wires feeding Slavianskii
Dom's (Slav Dom) house supply
panel on Nov. 13, the resulting power
outage affected the house operations
of both Slav Dom and the neighbor
ing Row house 717 Dolores (717).
Around noon, the broken tree
limb pulled down the "electrical
overhead supply drop," which in turn
pulled the wires from Slav Dom's
house electricity supply panel, ac
cording to Assistant Director of Stu
dent Housing for Maintenance Phil
Resell. As a result, both the panel and
related wiring were damaged.
A 717 resident immediately re
ported the power outage to Student
I lousing, and Housing staff members
were on hand within 10 minutes.
I lowever, power was not restored to
Slav Dom for another five hours, at
which point Housing staff utilized a
mobile generator reserved for the
President's house.
"PG&E [Pacific Gas and Electric
Company] was called immediately
when Student I lousing was notified
that there was a loss of power," Resch
said. "717 Dolores was also affected.
PG&E was able to repair 717 very
quickly, but additional work needed
to be done at the Slav Dom electrical
panel before power could be turned
back on."
Due to the loss of power, Slav
Dom's daily house operations were
affected on both Nov. 13 and Nov. 14.
"Since the power was out on Tues
day. and then the workers turned off
the generator during the day on
Wednesday to work on the wires, our
cook was not able to prepare meals,"
said Vaughan Tuohy "08, Slav Dom's
kitchen manager. "As a result we had
to order out for two days. All in all it
worked out fine, but the only concern
is if we will be compensated for the

meals we had to order in."
Though Stanford has several mo
bile campus generators in addition to
the one reserved for the President's
house. Associate Director of Student
Housing for Operations Imogen
Hinds said that the University would
implement its emergency plan in the
event of a more extensive power out
age.
"We have other campus mobile
generators that could have been used
if that one [reserved for the Presi
dent's house] was not available," she
said."lf a severe and extensive power
outage were to occur we would more
than likely look to using other facili
ties to help support the food and
housing needs. We would use the
University Emergency plan proto
col."
Executive Director of Student
Housing and Chief Housing Officer
Rodger Whitney emphasized that
Housing acts on emergency situa
tions as quickly as possible.
"We react as soon as we are aware
of the issue, and work to manage the
situation to the best that can be done
under the circumstances," he said.
Though both PG&E and the Car
dinal CoGen facility have alarms in
place to report if service is interrupt
ed, Resch said that residents and
Housing staff usually report a prob
lem if they are in the building.
Overall. Tuohy was satisfied with
the way 1 lousing handled the power
outage at Slav Dom.
"I think [Student Housing) dealt
with it pretty well, though I would
have preferred if PG&E did not turn
off power during the day on Wednes
day." he said. "Generally these things
are slower than you want it to be. but
[ I lousing] was good about it and told
us what was going on each step of the
process."
