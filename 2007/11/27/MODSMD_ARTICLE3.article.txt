# Gov't acts on file sharing
## Congressional bill threatens funding cut for non-compliant schools 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Buried deep within the more than 700
pages of the proposed "College Opportu
nity And Affordability Act of 2007" are
twelve lines of text that would require all
colleges to actively protect their networks
against illegal file sharing.
According to the bill, currently in the
House of Representatives, universities
would be required to not only provide de
terrents, but also offer "alternatives" to
campus copyright violations.
"We very much support the language
in the bill," said Angela Martinez, the vice
president of corporate communications
for the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA). The MPAA's music
counterpart, the Recording Industry As
sociation of America (RIAA). was un
available for comment.
In the academic world, however, the
bill has sparked considerable debate.
In a letter addressed to Congress, the

higher education members from the Joint
Committee of the Higher Education and
Entertainment Communities vehemently
opposed the bill and its implication that a
university's failure to comply would re
sult in a loss of federal financial aid. Signa
tories included Stanford's President John
Hennessy,the Chancellor of the Universi
ty of Maryland, the President of Pennsyl
vania State University and the legal coun
sel of Yale University
"Such an extraordinarily inappropri
ate and punitive outcome would result in
all students on that campus losing their
federal financial aid," they wrote in the
letter, stating that this would include
funding such as "Pell Grants and student
loans that are essential to their ability to
attend college, advance their education
and acquire the skills necessary to com
pete in the 21st-century economy."
"Loss of financial aid for all students in
a university because a few students are il
legally file sharing copyrighted material is
a draconian penalty," said Debra

Zumwalt. the vice president of Stanford's
General Counsel.
The MPAA disputes this, however,
and sent a document to The Daily hoping
to clarify its position on key points of the
bill.The document states that the act does
not directly threaten the financial aid eli
gibility of any institutions.
"Institutions of higher education must
report to the Secretary [of Education] on
a number of issues annually, at the risk of
monetary penalties or additional reviews
for non-compliance," the MPAA wrote in
the document. "[The act] simply adds an
anti-piracy plan to this list of require
ments. [There are] many opportunities to
correct the violation before ANY action
is taken with regard to Title IV [financial
aid] eligibility."
The bill would also require the enter
tainment industry to prepare for the Sec
retary of Education a list of top offenders
in order to take action against them. Ac-
cording to such a list produced by the
MPAA last year, Stanford was the
24th worst offender in the U.S. out of
25 ranked schools.
"We want to work together with
colleges to do everything possible to
stem this hemorrhaging of illegal
downloading and explore legal alter
natives to downloads students want
in a way that is convenient, easy, ac
cessible and, above all, legal," said
Stewart McLaurin, the executive vice
president of education for the
MPAA.
In terms of legal alternatives to
downloading movies, for instance.
Green Library's Media Microtext
Center contains approximately 9,000
DVDs and 18,000 VHS tapes, all of
which can be borrowed free of charge
with an SUID card.
There are many routes the enter
tainment industry can take to prose
cute illegal peer-to-peer (P2P) file
sharing. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) allows the
entertainment industry to legally
take action against those who violate
copyright law. According to Stan
ford's DMCA policy, students are
given three DMCA warnings before
the University acts against them.
However, Zumwalt pointed out
that students should not rely heavily
on this policy because they can also
be sued directly by copyright hold
ers. She explained that in 2007, the
recording industry — through the
RIA A — demanded money from 19
Stanford Internet users for unlawful
file sharing either through lawsuits
or pre-litigation settlement de
mands. In August, seven Stanford
students were sued for illegally up
loading music. Students who have
been subjected to these demands ei

ther pay thousands of dollars to set
tle or defend themselves and risk
substantial liability.
"Just last week we received a 'dis
covery hold' request for an IP ad
dress with a notice that the recording
artists are in the process of bringing
an action against that individual
Zumwalt added. "Students should
not rely on the fact that they will get
a 'warning' to stop file sharing before
they find themselves named as a de
fendant in a civil lawsuit."
McLaurin said the MPAA does
not sue individual students as a mat
ter of course, since it is not part of its
overall strategy, but nonetheless dis
agreed with Stanford's DMCA poli
cy of giving a student three warnings
before taking punitive action.
"If we condone illegal behavior
as academic intuitions even once,
then what concerns me is the mes
sage that we are giving our future
leaders," McLaurin said. "We want
to work proactively with academic
associations and, when necessary,
with Congress and state legislators
to create a better framework and a
better way of preventing this illegal
activity from happening."
One issue raised in the letter by
the higher education members was
the problem of differentiating be
tween legal and illegal files across a
P2P network and implementing a
technology-based deterrent. They
wrote that this demand is unreason
able because "adequate versions" of
the required technology "do not yet
exist," according to technology ex
perts.
"The problem with the legislation
is that it could be interpreted to at
tack the technology, not the prob
lem," Zumwalt said. "[P2P file shar

ing] can be used for lawful purposes
and there is no technological deter
rent that we are aware of that can
distinguish between lawful and un
lawful use."
The MPAA disagreed with this
both in writing and in interviews
with The Daily.
" There are many commercial
technologies, presently available
and tested that filter copyrighted
material," McLaurin said. "Our in
dustry gives these companies the fin
gerprints for copyrighted material to
be filtered out by the program. This
ensures that only very specific mate
rial is filtered and makes it possible
to have legitimate P2P activity."
Even though enforcement of ille
gal file sharing has caused many stu
dents to reconsider their actions,
others remain undeterred.
"It is just a matter of conven
ience," said one senior who was
granted anonymity out of fear of
prosecution. "Sometimes 1 don't
have the time to buy music,and 1 end
up downloading it.There are numer
ous ways of encrypting your data
traffic on the network so that it is im
possible to determine if one is file
sharing."
Zumwalt said that students
should pay more attention to the
law.
"I am surprised that some stu
dents continue to ignore their legal
obligations and the potential ad
verse consequences to themselves,"
she said. "They should know better.
Now their illegal behavior could en
danger the financial aid of innocent
students."

in order to take action against them. Ac-
cording to such a list produced by the
MPAA last year, Stanford was the
24th worst offender in the U.S. out of
25 ranked schools.
"We want to work together with
colleges to do everything possible to
stem this hemorrhaging of illegal
downloading and explore legal alter
natives to downloads students want
in a way that is convenient, easy, ac
cessible and, above all, legal," said
Stewart McLaurin, the executive vice
president of education for the
MPAA.
In terms of legal alternatives to
downloading movies, for instance.
Green Library's Media Microtext
Center contains approximately 9,000
DVDs and 18,000 VHS tapes, all of
which can be borrowed free of charge
with an SUID card.
There are many routes the enter
tainment industry can take to prose
cute illegal peer-to-peer (P2P) file
sharing. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) allows the
entertainment industry to legally
take action against those who violate
copyright law. According to Stan
ford's DMCA policy, students are
given three DMCA warnings before
the University acts against them.
However, Zumwalt pointed out
that students should not rely heavily
on this policy because they can also
be sued directly by copyright hold
ers. She explained that in 2007, the
recording industry — through the
RIA A — demanded money from 19
Stanford Internet users for unlawful
file sharing either through lawsuits
or pre-litigation settlement de
mands. In August, seven Stanford
students were sued for illegally up
loading music. Students who have
been subjected to these demands ei

ther pay thousands of dollars to set
tle or defend themselves and risk
substantial liability.
"Just last week we received a 'dis
covery hold' request for an IP ad
dress with a notice that the recording
artists are in the process of bringing
an action against that individual
Zumwalt added. "Students should
not rely on the fact that they will get
a 'warning' to stop file sharing before
they find themselves named as a de
fendant in a civil lawsuit."
McLaurin said the MPAA does
not sue individual students as a mat
ter of course, since it is not part of its
overall strategy, but nonetheless dis
agreed with Stanford's DMCA poli
cy of giving a student three warnings
before taking punitive action.
"If we condone illegal behavior
as academic intuitions even once,
then what concerns me is the mes
sage that we are giving our future
leaders," McLaurin said. "We want
to work proactively with academic
associations and, when necessary,
with Congress and state legislators
to create a better framework and a
better way of preventing this illegal
activity from happening."
One issue raised in the letter by
the higher education members was
the problem of differentiating be
tween legal and illegal files across a
P2P network and implementing a
technology-based deterrent. They
wrote that this demand is unreason
able because "adequate versions" of
the required technology "do not yet
exist," according to technology ex
perts.
"The problem with the legislation
is that it could be interpreted to at
tack the technology, not the prob
lem," Zumwalt said. "[P2P file shar

ing] can be used for lawful purposes
and there is no technological deter
rent that we are aware of that can
distinguish between lawful and un
lawful use."
The MPAA disagreed with this
both in writing and in interviews
with The Daily.
" There are many commercial
technologies, presently available
and tested that filter copyrighted
material," McLaurin said. "Our in
dustry gives these companies the fin
gerprints for copyrighted material to
be filtered out by the program. This
ensures that only very specific mate
rial is filtered and makes it possible
to have legitimate P2P activity."
Even though enforcement of ille
gal file sharing has caused many stu
dents to reconsider their actions,
others remain undeterred.
"It is just a matter of conven
ience," said one senior who was
granted anonymity out of fear of
prosecution. "Sometimes 1 don't
have the time to buy music,and 1 end
up downloading it.There are numer
ous ways of encrypting your data
traffic on the network so that it is im
possible to determine if one is file
sharing."
Zumwalt said that students
should pay more attention to the
law.
"I am surprised that some stu
dents continue to ignore their legal
obligations and the potential ad
verse consequences to themselves,"
she said. "They should know better.
Now their illegal behavior could en
danger the financial aid of innocent
students."

Buried deep within the more than 700
pages of the proposed "College Opportu
nity And Affordability Act of 2007" are
twelve lines of text that would require all
colleges to actively protect their networks
against illegal file sharing.
According to the bill, currently in the
House of Representatives, universities
would be required to not only provide de
terrents, but also offer "alternatives" to
campus copyright violations.
"We very much support the language
in the bill," said Angela Martinez, the vice
president of corporate communications
for the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA). The MPAA's music
counterpart, the Recording Industry As
sociation of America (RIAA). was un
available for comment.
In the academic world, however, the
bill has sparked considerable debate.
In a letter addressed to Congress, the

higher education members from the Joint
Committee of the Higher Education and
Entertainment Communities vehemently
opposed the bill and its implication that a
university's failure to comply would re
sult in a loss of federal financial aid. Signa
tories included Stanford's President John
Hennessy,the Chancellor of the Universi
ty of Maryland, the President of Pennsyl
vania State University and the legal coun
sel of Yale University
"Such an extraordinarily inappropri
ate and punitive outcome would result in
all students on that campus losing their
federal financial aid," they wrote in the
letter, stating that this would include
funding such as "Pell Grants and student
loans that are essential to their ability to
attend college, advance their education
and acquire the skills necessary to com
pete in the 21st-century economy."
"Loss of financial aid for all students in
a university because a few students are il
legally file sharing copyrighted material is
a draconian penalty," said Debra

Zumwalt. the vice president of Stanford's
General Counsel.
The MPAA disputes this, however,
and sent a document to The Daily hoping
to clarify its position on key points of the
bill.The document states that the act does
not directly threaten the financial aid eli
gibility of any institutions.
"Institutions of higher education must
report to the Secretary [of Education] on
a number of issues annually, at the risk of
monetary penalties or additional reviews
for non-compliance," the MPAA wrote in
the document. "[The act] simply adds an
anti-piracy plan to this list of require
ments. [There are] many opportunities to
correct the violation before ANY action
is taken with regard to Title IV [financial
aid] eligibility."
The bill would also require the enter
tainment industry to prepare for the Sec
retary of Education a list of top offenders
in order to take action against them. Ac-
cording to such a list produced by the
MPAA last year, Stanford was the
24th worst offender in the U.S. out of
25 ranked schools.
