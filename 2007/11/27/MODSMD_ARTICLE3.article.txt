# Gov't acts on file sharing
## Congressional bill threatens funding cut for non-compliant schools 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Buried deep within the more than 700
pages of the proposed "College Opportu
nity And Affordability Act of 2007" are
twelve lines of text that would require all
colleges to actively protect their networks
against illegal file sharing.
According to the bill, currently in the
House of Representatives, universities
would be required to not only provide de
terrents, but also offer "alternatives" to
campus copyright violations.
"We very much support the language
in the bill," said Angela Martinez, the vice
president of corporate communications
for the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA). The MPAA's music
counterpart, the Recording Industry As
sociation of America (RIAA). was un
available for comment.
In the academic world, however, the
bill has sparked considerable debate.
In a letter addressed to Congress, the

higher education members from the Joint
Committee of the Higher Education and
Entertainment Communities vehemently
opposed the bill and its implication that a
university's failure to comply would re
sult in a loss of federal financial aid. Signa
tories included Stanford's President John
Hennessy,the Chancellor of the Universi
ty of Maryland, the President of Pennsyl
vania State University and the legal coun
sel of Yale University
"Such an extraordinarily inappropri
ate and punitive outcome would result in
all students on that campus losing their
federal financial aid," they wrote in the
letter, stating that this would include
funding such as "Pell Grants and student
loans that are essential to their ability to
attend college, advance their education
and acquire the skills necessary to com
pete in the 21st-century economy."
"Loss of financial aid for all students in
a university because a few students are il
legally file sharing copyrighted material is
a draconian penalty," said Debra

Zumwalt. the vice president of Stanford's
General Counsel.
The MPAA disputes this, however,
and sent a document to The Daily hoping
to clarify its position on key points of the
bill.The document states that the act does
not directly threaten the financial aid eli
gibility of any institutions.
"Institutions of higher education must
report to the Secretary [of Education] on
a number of issues annually, at the risk of
monetary penalties or additional reviews
for non-compliance," the MPAA wrote in
the document. "[The act] simply adds an
anti-piracy plan to this list of require
ments. [There are] many opportunities to
correct the violation before ANY action
is taken with regard to Title IV [financial
aid] eligibility."
The bill would also require the enter
tainment industry to prepare for the Sec
retary of Education a list of top offenders
in order to take action against them. Ac-
