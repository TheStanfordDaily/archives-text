## Fifth year of medical education recommended Med. School says extra time adds learning, reduces stress 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
I"he path to becoming a doctor is already
a lengthy process, but the School of Medicine
is now actively encouraging students to de
vote a fifth year to medical training. The ad

ditional year of study would supplement pre
clinical and post-clinical programs, the dual
two-year focuses that form the basis of med
ical school.
"The bread and butter of what you need
to become a doctor will still take four years ,"
said Charles Prober, senior associate dean (if
medical education. "But we want students
well-placed to not only become the best doc
tors. but to acquire additional skills to pre
pare them for future leadership positions,
and the fifth year can be very helpful for that.

The additional year works well with the
medical school's cornerstone program of
scholarly concentrations. These courses of
study, mandatory for every student and
roughly equivalent to an undergraduate
major, have a heavy research component,
which the fifth year could accommodate.
"The program provides tools that then
allow students to capitalize as they go on
past medical school, and maybe even be
come leaders in their area," Prober said.
"But there's a concern that a scholarly con

centration and an M.I), is too stressful for
four years, and there's no chance to enjoy the
process."
"We want students to stop and smell the
roses," he added.
David Craig, a first-year medical student,
agreed that an extra year of medical school
could be beneficial.
"A lot of people use the fifth year as a way
to do scholarly concentrations and find it
useful for that," he said.
Although the Medical School ad
ministration encourages students to
consider the "Flexible Five-Year
Plan," the policy is not mandatory.
Prober acknowledged that some
students may come in with advanced
degrees or at an older age.
"An extra year may not be right
for them," he said. "That's fine, and
we want to still have students who
anticipate graduating in four years."
The administration also wants to
avoid discouraging applicants who
are not comfortable with the idea of
five years of study.
"Students entering medical
school who have come [from) socio
economically deprived backgrounds
or from various underrepresented
minorities may view medical school
as simply a route to becoming a doc
tor in the traditional sense," Medical
School Dean Philip Pizzo wrote in
an email to The Daily. "As such, they
may not view a school that empha
sizes academic training as compati
ble with their own personal goals.
"And yet," he added, "as they get
into the school and begin to experi

ence new vistas, their plans may
change and previously undiscovered
career paths may become more at
tractive."
Above all, administrators hope
that the option of the fifth year will
only provide benefits to medical stu
dents, helping them to appreciate
the academic experience of medical
study.
"Medical education involves life
time learning," Pizzo said. "It is best
to view this phase of the process as
the beginning, not the end."
"I'd hate for this to be misper
ceived as more pressure: more things
to do, more things to do better."
Prober said. "The reason to do this,
of course, is to lower stress."
The idea of a fifth year is already
becoming a standard part of student
culture on campus.
"The fifth year is certainly a de
stressing experience," Craig said.
First-year medical student
Jonathan Kleinman agreed.
"It's behind the times to force
four years," he said. "The fact that it's
supported by the administration to
stay for five years is great."
"It's a good thing," Kleinman
added, "and I think most of my class
is going to be here for five years."
