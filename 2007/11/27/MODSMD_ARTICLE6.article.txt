## Madrid program set to open Twice too many applicants shows center's need, appeal 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As winter quarter approaches, the Bing
Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) is
preparing to launch its all-new program in
Madrid, the University's first program of
fered in Spain since its Salamanca program
closed during the 1990-91 academic year.
According to BOSP Director Norman
Naimark, a professor of I astern European
studies, the Madrid program is ready to re
ceive its first group of students.
"We are very happy about the progress
of the program," he wrote in an email toThe
Daily. "We have hired a first-rate, highly ex
perienced director. Prof. Santiago Tejerina-
Canal, who was professor of Spanish, chair
of the Spanish Department at Hamilton
[College in Clinton, N.Y.] and director of a
very successful Hamilton program in
Madrid for a number of years."
Naimark added that Michael Predmore,
a professor of Spanish and Portugese, and
Herb Klein, professor of history and Latin-
American studies, have signed on to serve
as professors-in-residence for the winter
and spring quarters, respectively.
Located on the campus of the Interna
tional Institute in Madrid, the BOSP pro
gram will offer Stanford students the oppor
tunity to take courses ranging from Iberian
studies and Spanish literature to economics
and political science, while immersing
themselves in the culture and atmosphere
of Spain's capital city.
For the program's opening quarter, the
number of applications (77) was more than
twice the number of slots available (35),
making the demand for the program greater
than that of any other overseas location.
Naimark credits the high demand to long
standing student desire for a study-abroad
program in Spain.
"There is a lot of pent-up student de
mand for a program in Spain," Naimark
said. "We expect that the high numbers of
applicants to available spots will normalize
over the course of a couple of years. We
don't like to turn down that many appli
cants."
