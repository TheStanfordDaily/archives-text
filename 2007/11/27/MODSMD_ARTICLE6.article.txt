## Madrid program set to open Twice too many applicants shows center's need, appeal 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As winter quarter approaches, the Bing
Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) is
preparing to launch its all-new program in
Madrid, the University's first program of
fered in Spain since its Salamanca program
closed during the 1990-91 academic year.
According to BOSP Director Norman
Naimark, a professor of I astern European
studies, the Madrid program is ready to re
ceive its first group of students.
"We are very happy about the progress
of the program," he wrote in an email toThe
Daily. "We have hired a first-rate, highly ex
perienced director. Prof. Santiago Tejerina-
Canal, who was professor of Spanish, chair
of the Spanish Department at Hamilton
[College in Clinton, N.Y.] and director of a
very successful Hamilton program in
Madrid for a number of years."
Naimark added that Michael Predmore,
a professor of Spanish and Portugese, and
Herb Klein, professor of history and Latin-
American studies, have signed on to serve
as professors-in-residence for the winter
and spring quarters, respectively.
Located on the campus of the Interna
tional Institute in Madrid, the BOSP pro
gram will offer Stanford students the oppor
tunity to take courses ranging from Iberian
studies and Spanish literature to economics
and political science, while immersing
themselves in the culture and atmosphere
of Spain's capital city.
For the program's opening quarter, the
number of applications (77) was more than
twice the number of slots available (35),
making the demand for the program greater
than that of any other overseas location.
Naimark credits the high demand to long
standing student desire for a study-abroad
program in Spain.
"There is a lot of pent-up student de
mand for a program in Spain," Naimark
said. "We expect that the high numbers of
applicants to available spots will normalize
over the course of a couple of years. We
don't like to turn down that many appli
cants."
Naimark has been working to
develop a BOSP program in Spain
since he first became director of the
program two years ago. While con
structing the program and finding
an appropriate staff were difficult,
coordinating the plans with Spanish
authorities added another layer of
complexity.
"Dealing with the Spanish bu
reaucracy is not easy," Naimark
said. "There are a number of chal
lenges getting legal status in Spain,
but those have been overcome."
This winter's participants will be
seen as a "pioneer group," Naimark
said. He said BOSP administrators
will examine the experiences of this
first group closely in an effort to en
sure the long-term success of the
program.
"There was, of course, a program
in Salamanca quite a number of
years ago." Naimark said. "It closed
in part because of the perception of
the program's narrowness of
"We have to meet student and fac
ulty needs for an intellectually ex
citing, academically viable and
meaningful overseas studies pro
gram in Spain." he added."This first
group of students — and faculty —

will help us understand whether we
are doing that and what we can do
better."
Although the BOSP program in
Santiago. Chile gives students a
chance to immerse themselves in a
Spanish-speaking environment,
BOSP has not offered even a sum
mer seminar in Spain in recent
years, much less a quarter-long pro
gram.
"I decided to study in Madrid
this winter because I have been
waiting for Stanford to open a pro
gram in Spain ever since I came
here," Alison Buki '08 wrote in an
email to The Daily. "I'm a senior
now so I'm glad I'll have the oppor
tunity to study abroad in the
Madrid program."
For other students, Spain is sim
ply the location that can best satisfy
and enhance their particular inter
ests.
"When I heard Stanford in
Madrid was opening, 1 thought it
would be a great opportunity for me
to finish studying in Spain as 1 have
always wanted to," Marina Scannell
'08 wrote in an email to The Daily.
"I'm also a flamenco dancer, which
is why I am so enthusiastic about
spending so much time in Spain and
learning about the culture, the lan
guage and so forth."
