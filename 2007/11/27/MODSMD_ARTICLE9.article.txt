## Nobel photo, global warming reunite rivals 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Talk about an
inconvenient truth. Al Gore finally won his
place in the Oval Office on Monday) — right
next to George W. Bush. Forever linked by the
closest and craziest presidential race in histo
ry the two men were reunited by of all things.
White House tradition.
Gore was among the 2007 Nobel Prize
winners who were invited in for a photo and
some chatter with the president; Gore got the
recognition for his work on global warming.
The two men stood next to other, sharing
uncomfortable grins for photographers and
reporters, who were quickly ushered in and
out.
"Familiar faces," the former vice president
said of the media. Bush, still smiling, added
nothing.
The two also had a 40-minute meeting in
the Oval Office, part of Bush's effort to show
some outreach to his longtime rival.
Bush aides said it was private and would
not comment on it.
Gore, trailed by the press as he left the
White House very publicly on foot, allowed
that he and Bush spent the whole time talking
about global warming.
"He was very gracious in setting up the
meeting and it was a very good and substan
tive conversation," Gore said."And that's all I
want to say about it."
Gore's presence added unlikely buzz to a
photo op that normally would have been
buried by Bush's Mideast peace forays. It is
not like these two cross paths much. They
have not met privately since then-President
elect Bush paid a visit) — short, and not that
sweet) — to Gore's residence in December

2000.
That was hack when the acrimony was
fresh, in a country still in disbelief over an
election that seemed never-ending. Ultimate
ly. the U.S. Supreme Court certified Bush's
537-vote victory margin over Gore in Florida
to settle the outcome.
Since then. Gore has not shied away from
criticizing Bush; his latest book, "The Assault
on Reason," is a relentless attack against the
administration. And the White House's re
sponse when Gore won the Nobel Prize was
less than giddy.
Never mind all that.
"I know that this president does not har
bor any resentments," White 1 louse press sec
retary Dana Perino said. "Never has."
Indeed, the White House tried to make
clear that Bush was hosting Gore not out of
obligation, but genuine interest.
Bush personally invited Gore. The White
House changed its original date to accommo
date Gore. And then there was the private
Bush-Gore meeting.too.
When it was over, the scene took a bit of
turn for the weird.
Gore said he didn't want to comment. But
with the media waiting for him. Gore and his
wife. Tipper, walked out along Pennsylvania
Avenue and up 17th Street, toward his nearby
office - even though the White House is adept
at helping people slip away unnoticed if they
want.
The media horde followed the Gores for sev
eral minutes. When a veteran reporter asked
Gore if he missed all the attention, he adeptly
turned the question around. "When you leave
this beat." he said,"l'm gonna ask you."
