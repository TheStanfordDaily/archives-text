"As an interconnected global institution, Stanford
University believes that we have the responsibility to
make sure that products affiliated to our name are man
ufactured in working conditions up to the standard that
we embraced," President John 1 lennessy said in his open
ing speech to last night's panel discussion on "Global
Competitiveness: Economics, Ethics, and the Global
Labor Force" held at the Bishop Auditorium in the Grad
uate School of Business (GSB).
The discussion — moderated by Joshua Cohen, direc
tor of the Program on Global Justice at the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI) for International Studies and pro
fessor of political science, philosophy and law - focused
on the global push to improve the working environment,
mainly in the textile industry.The panel discussed the im
plication of such efforts for Stanford, which gives out li
censes to manufacture its branded apparel.
Political Science Prof. David Brady, who is also a sen
ior fellow at the Hoover Institution.FSl and the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Research (SlEPR),started
the discussion with an introduction to the setbacks that
anti-sweat shop movements have faced since their con
ception.
"Without a legal framework, it is very difficult for
NGOs [non-governmental organizations] to enforce the
appropriate standard," he said. "And because of poverty,
workers in these countries are forced to accept the job
that has no safety measures."
Despite these difficulties, anti-sweat shop movements
have made significant progress in their pursuit. Brandy
said that international surveys have shown that compa
nies like Nike and Adidas have implemented measures to
improve the working conditions in their subcontracting
factories.
"What matters is not the size of all the protests but the
size of the media coverage of these protests," said GSB
Prof. Hayagreeva Rao. "The consumers react to what is
on the news, and the next day not only will there be a boy
cott of the products but also the stock market will be hit."
Rao added that the activists have managed to use
these tactics and transform this social moral issue into a
risk issue to the companies. This offers an incentive to
companies like Nike, Adidas and Gap to improve their
workers' working conditions.
But Ethics in Society Prof. Debra Satz warned the au
dience to think hard about the potential conflict between
the good intention and the negative consequences that

these movements may pose to the workers in developing
countries, especially the loss of jobs.
However, she concluded that these problems should
not deter people from pushing for what they believe in.
"We don't know enough about the world to determine
what works and what does not work." she said. "Some
times what the economists think cannot work may in fact
become the very thins that changes the world."

" [ VVe must 1 make sure that
products affiliated with our
name are manufactured in
working conditions up to the
standard that we embraced."

JOHN HENNESSY,

Scott Nova, executive director of Workers Rights
Consortium —an organization that involves 175 col
leges and universities (including Stanford) across the U.S.
— said the I Jniversity has a lot of power over the manu
facturers of its branded apparel.
"One of the things that the University can do." he said,
"is to put down in the licensing agreements with the man
ufacturers the standard of working conditions that it
wants the manufacturers to embrace."
Among the attendees at last night's panel were mem
bers of the Sweat-Free Stanford Coalition.
They had a very interesting point on how consumers
can be a factor in the anti-sweat shop movement." said
Theresa /hen' (W. a member of the coalition. "We will go
back and rethink our strategy to influence more on the
demand side, instead of directing [our efforts] at the eco
nomic market which we cannot really control."
