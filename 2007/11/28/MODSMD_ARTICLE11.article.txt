## EDITORIAL BOARD Rekindling FLiCKS 
### 
I n recent weeks, technical difficulties and
low turnout have threatened the future
of our long-established Sunday night
movie tradition. FLiCKS. Although its pop
ularity remains low among upperclassmen.
many students believe that the beloved 80-
year-old Stanford tradition is worth saving.
With the program's long-awaited return on
Dec. 2 nearly upon us, there are still a hand
ful of issues that have yet to be resolved in
efforts to revitalize FLiCKS.
The most crucial issue is the timing.
While FLiCKS' customary scheduling at 7
p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sunday ostensibly pro
vides a study break opportunity, the timing
is a deterrent to many. There are many stu
dents who would enjoy catching the latest
release — like "Transformers" or "Super
bad" — but are too busy dealing with all the
work they left to the last few hours of the
weekend. Sunday night is a time for home
work. not Hollywood, and FLiCKS would
do well to reschedule their screenings for an
earlier time on the weekend, ideally Friday.
Outgoing FLiCKS director Mathew
Crichton 10 noted that he. too, believes Fri
day nights would be a more advantageous
time for FLiCKS and that survey results
show a great deal of support for the move

Moving the screenings to Friday would like

turnout — not only would FLiCKS not have
to compete with the Sunday night home
work crunch, it would also provide an alter
native to Friday night frat parties.
But according to FLiCKS' new director
Kyle Evaldez '09. changing the time would
create other problems.

In addition to changing the timing of
FLiCKS, the organization would do well to

for tickets. Evaldez says that funding for the
organization was less stable under that sys

us explain:

does more to ensure that students will want
their money's worth and show up. Selling
ticket packages for a month at a time, for in

FLiCKS shouldn't continue to re

Friday would do much to rejuvenate the
flickering film program. Evaldez agrees.The
FLiCKS committee is "definitely playing
around with the idea of possibly having
screenings on another night," he said, "on
top of our usual Sunday screenings."
In addition to changing the timing of
FLiCKS, the organization would do well to
reinstate its past policy of charging students
for tickets. Evaldez says that funding for the
organization was less stable under that sys
tem. but making the program free to stu
dents may actually reduce attendance by re
moving the incentive for students to go. Let
us explain:
Paying ahead of time for tickets, even if it
effects a short term decrease in interest,
does more to ensure that students will want
their money's worth and show up. Selling
ticket packages for a month at a time, for in
stance, would further guarantee student
turnout. If you've already shelled out $3 or
$5 (a sum significantly less than what it
would cost you to see "I Now Pronounce
You Chuck and Larry' at Shoreline), you're

much more likely to head to

ready paid a lee. I hat's not to say
FLiCKS shouldn't continue to re
ceive some baseline funding, but
charging a pittance lor tickets could
provide the necessary incentive to
boost attendance.
And if you're going to be
charged, why not have a say in what's
being shown? The I I iCKS Website
(I l.iC'kS.stanlord.edu) currently
welcomes student suggestions for In
ture showings, and even encourages
submissions of hilarious You Tube
videos to be shown before the lea

tlire film. While the organization is
clearly open to student feedback,
they might consider implementing a
more formal and available input sys
tem in the future, like showing four
movie titles at the start of the film
and having students text their pref
erences a la Cardinal promos at
sporting events, or utilizing Face
book as a more accessible mecha
nism for receiving student input. If
all else fails, write suggestions on the
paper provided at the 10 p.m. screen
ing and let it fly.
The suggestions need not even be
limited to blockbuster hits. Organiz
ers have said they're committed to
showing a diverse lineup of films, so
send in suggestions for black and
white classics, indie films, "The
Rocky Horror Picture Show," or
whatever tickles your fancy. Pro
moting a wider variety of films could
enhance student interest and
turnout.
FLiCKS has been at the Farm
since 1937, according to Stanford
Magazine.To put that in perspective,
in 1937, the top-grossing movie in
the U.S. was the original "Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs," and
the ()scar for Best Actor and Actress
went to Spencer Tracy and Luise
Rainer.
FLiCKS has been a part of Stan
ford for a long time, but it's caught
now in a maelstrom of student apa
thy and technical and organizational
problems. FLiCKS should explore
and implement innovative methods
to recapture student interest,lest our
venerable film program flicker and
die.
