## EDITORIAL BOARD Rekindling FLiCKS 
### 
I n recent weeks, technical difficulties and
low turnout have threatened the future
of our long-established Sunday night
movie tradition. FLiCKS. Although its pop
ularity remains low among upperclassmen.
many students believe that the beloved 80-
year-old Stanford tradition is worth saving.
With the program's long-awaited return on
Dec. 2 nearly upon us, there are still a hand
ful of issues that have yet to be resolved in
efforts to revitalize FLiCKS.
The most crucial issue is the timing.
While FLiCKS' customary scheduling at 7
p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sunday ostensibly pro
vides a study break opportunity, the timing
is a deterrent to many. There are many stu
dents who would enjoy catching the latest
release — like "Transformers" or "Super
bad" — but are too busy dealing with all the
work they left to the last few hours of the
weekend. Sunday night is a time for home
work. not Hollywood, and FLiCKS would
do well to reschedule their screenings for an
earlier time on the weekend, ideally Friday.
Outgoing FLiCKS director Mathew
Crichton 10 noted that he. too, believes Fri
day nights would be a more advantageous
time for FLiCKS and that survey results
show a great deal of support for the move
["FLiCKS changes leadership." Nov. 16],
Moving the screenings to Friday would like
ly induce a dramatic spike in student
turnout — not only would FLiCKS not have
to compete with the Sunday night home
work crunch, it would also provide an alter
native to Friday night frat parties.
But according to FLiCKS' new director
Kyle Evaldez '09. changing the time would
create other problems.
"Logistically, Sunday nights are easier to
book with regards to reserving space, since
most big events usually happen either dur

ing weekday nights or on Saturday nights,"
he said.
Ihe Stanford Lively Arts schedule re
veals that there are several events — such
as the kronos Quartet and the Merce
C 'unningham Dance company on successive
Fridays in January — that would certainly
conflict with a Friday night FLiCKS.
If Memorial Auditorium is oversched
uled on Friday nights and attendance con
tinues to remain low, an alternative could he
moving FLiCKS to the smaller but less uti
lized Cubberley Auditorium, where "Wrist
cutters" was shown earlier in the year. How
ever it is accomplished, moving FLiCKS to
Friday would do much to rejuvenate the
flickering film program. Evaldez agrees.The
FLiCKS committee is "definitely playing
around with the idea of possibly having
screenings on another night," he said, "on
top of our usual Sunday screenings."
In addition to changing the timing of
FLiCKS, the organization would do well to
reinstate its past policy of charging students
for tickets. Evaldez says that funding for the
organization was less stable under that sys
tem. but making the program free to stu
dents may actually reduce attendance by re
moving the incentive for students to go. Let
us explain:
Paying ahead of time for tickets, even if it
effects a short term decrease in interest,
does more to ensure that students will want
their money's worth and show up. Selling
ticket packages for a month at a time, for in
stance, would further guarantee student
turnout. If you've already shelled out $3 or
$5 (a sum significantly less than what it
would cost you to see "I Now Pronounce
You Chuck and Larry' at Shoreline), you're
