# THE 						LOWLY INTERNS
## Considering the American Warrior 
### 
I don't know about where you grew up,
hut nie. I grew up in a very non-military
community.
I say non-military because I don't mean
anti-military.The folks in my town certainly
weren't the type to burn flags against the
military,but our lives definitely had very lit
tle to do with military matters. Before this
year. I could count the number of service
men and women I ever knew on two hands.
My own lack of interaction with the
armed forces is partly due to my family
background. My parents are both Indian im
migrants whose lives have been devoted to
successfully establishing themselves here.
They upheld peace, equanimity, and Good
Samaritanism as key virtues to guide a
moral life. With a strong emphasis on nonvi
olence. 1 know of no relative or family
friend, close or distant, who has been in the
military.
Beyond my own family, the community
in which I was raised reinforced that separa
tion from the military. It was a relatively af
fluent, predominantly white suburban re
gion north of Chicago where the military
was basically unheard of. When rare individ
uals joined the military, people were
shocked.There existed the notion that join
ing the military was tantamount to getting
your tombstone engraved: you were in for
an early death. A sympathetic swell of com
munal pity would How for the mother of an
enlisted individual. Parents shuddered to
think that their child might sign up as well.
You can imagine, then, my complete ig
norance of the military. It was not until my
internship here in I).C that I finally began to
fill a much-neglected gap in my academic
and cultural knowledge.
I work at the Center for a New American
Security (www.cnas.org). We're a national
security and defense think tank, and we
have many projects relating to the Defense
Department. Even within our small group
of about 30, there are three currently serving
Military Fellows, four former military em
ployees, anil three former Deputy Assistant
Secretaries of Defense.
Now, I by no means have a comprehen
sive understanding of the military, but being
in this environment daily has filled in some
deep gaps. Prior to joining CN AS, I couldn't
have listed off the different military services.
Now. I can at least speak briefly on topics
ranging from the defense budget to special
operations forces to Mine Resistant Am
bush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Now. I've
even personally heard both the ( hairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Comman
dant of the Marine Corps spe;ik.
More importantly, I finally have experi
enced some interaction with servicemen

and women. I understand a little more
about spending your life, or even just a few
years, immersed in a Service. 1 understand a
little more about having to move every cou
ple years and about the demand that poses
on the wives and husbands and children. I
understand a little more about the wide
world of the military, with institutions rang
ing from training facilities to universities. I
understand a little more about how our mil
itary can be immensely strong, deeply frag
ile. and constantly needed all at the same
time.
And it's suddenly dawning on me that we
must live in a dangerous place if someone
like me, who supposedly studies national se
curity and American foreign policy, has
gone through life thinking that the military
is A) A vaguely immoral, albeit necessary,
institution of our nation, and B) Only of
marginal importance to fully comprehend
ing our nation's diplomatic history.
We should be wary of this attitude. The
knee-jerk instinct among many college stu
dents and much of the academic elite is to as
sume that anything military is inherently a
bad idea. 'Hint's an ignorant and self-crip
pling attitude that can grievously injure our
country's civil-military relations. We should
try to reach the day when normal, everyday
parents can look at individuals in military
service as paragons for their own children
and exemplars for the community. If future
civilian leaders of the world do not interact
with the military and do not form an accu
rate conceptualization of the military, we will
simply be setting ourselves up for pitfalls.
There is and there always will be a need
for an American military. As long as that's
true, the size and public favorability of our
military will shift. I hope, however, that com
ing generations of Americans have a better
understanding of the military than I did. A
more informed public is one that is better
aware of the abilities and limitations of our
military and one that can exercise better
oversight over our leaders.
