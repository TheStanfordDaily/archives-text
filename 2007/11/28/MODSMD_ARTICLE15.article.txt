# Stu's Views
## Some of Ron Paul's supporters are also insane 
### 
My last column ["Ron Paul Is Insane,"
Nov. 14J attracted an astounding
amount of online comments: more
than 1,000.
After reading through most of the com
ments, — some of them vicious, many of
them vitriolic — the 100-plus e-mails and the
dozens of IMs, I realized that my last column
was a mistake. Ron Paul is still nuts. But that's
not the real problem. It's his supporters — or
at least, the fanatical ones — who are truly
insane.The kind of invective, accusations and
abuse directed at me. which have been simi
larly directed at others who have challenged
Paul's supremacy on the Internet, only
strengthens Paul's image as a fringe candi
date propped up by a small group of fanatical
supporters typing away at blogs containing
the words "Liberty" and "Constitution."The
Internet has united Paul's supporters all over
the country in a way that would have been
impossible 15 years ago and provided an
ironclad echo chamber that reinforces the
belief that no one in their right mind could
disagree with Paul's views.
I predicted in my last column that the
Paultards would comment-bomb me like
mad, a prediction that was more accurate
than even I imagined. The amount of com
ments surprised — and scared me.
It is impossible to categorize all the com

ments; there are just too many to sort
through. But some key points emerged.They
attacked me from various angles: some ac
cused me of being a neoconservative, and
some accused me of being a socialist. 1 am
neither. I do believe in globalization, though
some accused me as if it was a bad thing. It's
not. An astounding number said something
like, "RON PAUL IS NOT INSANE:
YOU'RE INSANE!" Some tried to imper
sonate me, with varying degrees of success,
and some made puns on my name, such as the
profound "Is Stu short for Stupid?" And
many were only semi-coherent. Am 1 really
"marinat[ing] in shame?"
At least 99 percent of the comments were
from non-Stanford students. And while the
response was overwhelmingly against my
column, the student response was more
mixed. One student agreed with me. remark
ing: "The man is several tacos short of a fies

ta platter for sure. Several samosas short of
an Indian wedding. You get the idea. Stuart,
great article."
Some others did not, respectfully and rea
sonably. A couple students seemed concerned
about the revolutionary rhetoric of some of
the more extreme Paultards:'Tm afraid of fa
natics who swarm with your zeal gaining
power and demanding (that] the people who
don't agree with you lose their voice, as you
suggest. Say what you want, but you are mak
ing Ron Paul look dangerous." I also made
some of my fellow Daily columnists jealous.
ITiey can barely muster 10 comments,but I —
I can get 1 ,000 and challenge the great Azia
Kim piece of yesteryear! (It's still beating me
with more than 1,700 comments).
There were also a great number of
thoughtful posts lost in the morass of tirades.
Many readers were understandably upset
that I made what they termed an "ad
hominem attack" on their candidate. 1 was
using the term "insane" liberally, not at all in a
clinical sense, and I maintain that Paul's views
lie on the fringe of American society and pol
itics. Even on the comments section, there
was occasionally a debate between the hard
line supporters aggressively attacking me,
and more reasonable types who contended
