Setting the record straight
on file-sharing
To the Editor:
I am concerned that yesterday's Daily ar
ticle [Gov't acts on file sharing] did not cover
Stanford's newly implemented Reconnec
tion Fee: moreover, it could in fact encourage
students to unlawfully file-share based on the
misstatement that the University gives stu
dents "three DMCA warnings before the
University acts against them."
Under the Student DMCA Complaint
Policy (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/legal/
Recent/DMCA_Reconncct_fee Pinal 1007.

pdf), a student in receipt of a first valid copy
right complaint has 48 hours to respond to
the complaint. If no response is received, the
Internet connection is disabled and. after re
dressing the complaint, a student must pay
$ 1 (X) to he reconnected to the Internet. On a
second complaint, a student is immediately
disconnected.
To be reconnected after a second valid
complaint, the student must speak to a Resi
dence Dean about the problems of unlawful
file-sharing and pay a $S(X) reconnection fee.
On a third complaint, the Internet connec
tion is immediately terminated. The student
is referred for disciplinary action at the Of

fice of Judicial Affairs and up to ;i $1 ,(XX) fee
may he imposed.
It is striking that the MPAA did not think
this was an acceptable University policy, espe
cially since Cary Sherman, the President of
the Recording Industry Association of Amer
ica. has publicly commented on the strength
of Stanford's anti-piracy policy. It is important
to set the record straight and for students to
understand that Stanford has a strong policy
in place with real consequences on even a first
complaint of copyright violation.
