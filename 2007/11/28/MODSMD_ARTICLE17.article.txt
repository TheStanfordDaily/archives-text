## WOMEN HOST USF No. 5 Cardinal ready to prove itself after UConn loss 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
I"he No. 5 women's basketball team looks
for its third straight win tonight when it takes
on the University of San Francisco tonight at 7
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
After falling to No. 2 Connecticut last week,
the Cardinal bounced back with wins against
Old Dominion and Temple. However, coach
Tara VanDerveer thinks that hist week's loss to
the Huskies might be beneficial to the team
tonight.
"The best thing honestly might be our loss
to Connecticut."VanDerveer said. "That might
be the same that we learned the most from."

"Every game you play,
whether you win or lose,
impacts your next game
in some way."

— Coach TARA VANDERVEER

However, the Dons (3-3) are coming off a
learning experience of their own. Villanova de
feated USF 73-70 in overtime on Nov. 24. and
VanDerveer expects the San Francisco squad
to arrive fired up as a result.
"Every game you play, whether you win or
lose, impacts your next game in some way," she
said."[USF's loss] will be positive for them be
cause of confidence, jsince] they were so close
against Villanova. Hut I also think...we're a big
team on their schedule, and we're a good rival
for them, so they'll come in very excited and 1
think they'll do very well."
The Dons' excitement will be led by senior
Dominique Carter, who leads the team with
18.7 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. It was
also Carter's buzzer beater that put USF into
overtime on Saturday. Ihe 5-11 small forward
is supported by Necolia Simmons and Lisa
Olden in the frontcourt.each of whom average
more than 9.5 points and 7 rebounds. Ilie back
court. meanwhile, is bolstered by sophomore
I leidi I leintz and junior Shay Rollins. The duo
combined for 29 points against Villanova.

VanDerveer acknowledged San Francisco's
depth in discussing the value of team defense.
"We've played against Carter before," Van-
Derveer explained. "She's a great talent, a
great one-on-one player. Our focus is more of
our team, and one person will guard her. but

our team will have to play team defense. We're
going to count on a great game from a lot of
people, not just one."
One way of doing that will be finding suc
cess inside. Stanford's combination of sopho

GAME NO ITS: The Cardinal is currently ranked N0.5 in the
USA Today/ESPN poll and enters the regular season after
going 2-1 at the Paradise Jam in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Wednesday's game will be the 29th all-time meeting be
tween Stanford and San Francisco. The Cardinal current
ly holds a 13-game winning streak in the series. Stanford
is looking for big performances from forwards Kayla Ped
ersen and Jillian Harmon, both of whom posted double
doubles at the Paradise Jam.

and senior Jillian Harmon gives the Card an
enormous height advantage over the Dons,
whose tallest starter. Olden, stands only 6-2.
But VanDerveer knows that another key
will he Stanford's play around the perimeter.
USF averages 4.5 three-pointers per outing to
the Cardinal's 2.3, so the baekcourt starters —
senior Candice Wiggins, senior Cissy Pierce
and sophomore Rosalyn Gold-Onwude —
will be charged with not only increasing pro
duction from behind the arc. but also defend
ing well outside.
"We're going to have to work really hard
defensively on the perimeter.and then try to go
inside to Jayne and Kayla," VanDerveer com
mented. "But, we [also] need to have better
perimeter scoring. Our three-point scoring is
not where we want it to be. or where we think
it should be...So, we're working on some
tweaks to our offense, [and] we're just putting
the pieces of this year's puzzle together."
However, the puzzle has grown jagged al
ready, as sophomore forward Michelle Harri
son's season ended against Yale, when she tore
her ACL. Sophomore guard Melanie Murphy
will also miss tonight's game—if not more
games — with a knee injury.
VanDerveer knows that their absence will
be felt, but she hopes the home opener with
USF won't require the "miracle finish" that
was seen when Murphy hit a three with .2 sec
onds left to put Stanford into overtime with
Utah on Nov. IS.
"We're definitely glad to be back," Van-
Derveer said emphatically. "We've been road
warriors, and I'm really proud of our team, [of]
how hard everyone has played, and [of] how
well we've done. We had a great trip, but it's a
long time to be away from home, and we were
really ready to come home [to finally! P' a y a
home game."

son's season ended against Yale, when she tore
her ACL. Sophomore guard Melanie Murphy
will also miss tonight's game—if not more
games — with a knee injury.
VanDerveer knows that their absence will
be felt, but she hopes the home opener with
USF won't require the "miracle finish" that
was seen when Murphy hit a three with .2 sec
onds left to put Stanford into overtime with
Utah on Nov. IS.
"We're definitely glad to be back," Van-
Derveer said emphatically. "We've been road
warriors, and I'm really proud of our team, [of]
how hard everyone has played, and [of] how
well we've done. We had a great trip, but it's a
long time to be away from home, and we were
really ready to come home [to finally! P' a y a
home game."
