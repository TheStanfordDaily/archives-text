# Wrestling wins keep coming
## Cardinal dominate San Francisco State 37-10, take eight 10 matches 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Ihis early in its 2<M)7-()K season, Stanford wrestling's
main focus has to be on building towards a strong
stretch run as opposed to evaluating immediate results.
Nevertheless, it would be hard not to be encouraged by
the continued early season success the Cardinal has ex
perienced in a key year for the program.
On Nov. 18, coach Kerry McCoy's squad took part in
the Fullerton Open where they saw plenty of Pac-10
competition for the first time this year. Senior co-cap
tain No. 4 Tanner Gardner, wrestling at 125 pounds,
captured his second straight tournament title following
a top finish at the Central Missouri Open a week prior
to the competition at Fullerton. Gardner pushed his
record on the season to 11 0 with five wins on the day.
"It feels good. I've been runner-up there the past
two years, so it's good to finally pick up a win there."
Gardner said. "It was a good tournament. I got to face
a couple good conference guys, so it was good to face
them I didn't wrestle as well as I would have liked to.
but we did pick up on some areas to improve, and I
think that will be crucial this weekend coming up and
for the rest of the season."
Also impressive at the Fullerton Open were seniors

Phil Doerner. wrestling in the heavyweight class, and
No. K Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds. Doerner finished
fourth, winning five consecutive matches to bounce
back after a second round loss. Zupancic, meanwhile,
rolled through his early round competition before suf
fering a disappointing 5-2 loss against Cal Polys No. 17
Chase Pami in the championship bout to finish second.
With the season still very young, Zupancic was con
fident that the experience against a tough conference
foe would prove helpful down the line.
"I didn't think it was that big of a deal because it's so
early in the season," he said. "But it was good to wrestle
him because I know now that I need to attack a lot more
against him, and anyone in general. So it was definitely
something I can take and learn from, so I was happy in
that regard "
Freshmen Nick Amuchastegui (157 pounds) and
Max Rosefigura (141 pounds) rounded out the Cardi
nal placers at Fullerton.as both finished fourth in their
respective weight classes.
Stanford then rolled to its second dominant dual
meet victory of the season, topping Div. II San Francis
co State 37-10 on Nov. 21. Ihe Cardinal was victorious
in eight of ten matches on the day.
"Well, it (doesn't) have too much bearing because
they 're not Division I,and they're a little down this year
as well, I think," Zupancic said."But it was good to sec
all our guys go out there and wrestle real well. Fven the
guys that lost showed a lot of heart."
Gardner notched his seventh pin of the season to
