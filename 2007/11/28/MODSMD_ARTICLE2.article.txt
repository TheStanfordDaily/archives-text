When Harvard and Princeton gave the axe to
early admissions last year, Stanford might have ex
pected the size of its early application pool to in
crease. A number of elite colleges that offer the same
kind of non-binding "early action" program as Stan

but Stanford is not among them.
4,636 candidates applied for early admission to

Other universities that compete with I larvard and
Princeton for applicants have seen large increases in
early applications this year. According to The Wall

'ITie University of Chicago received 42 percent more
early applications than last year, Georgetown's early

applications increased by 30 percent and MIT is ex

widespread evacuations in parts of Southern Califor

"It's somewhat reckless to speculate as to why we
didn't experience a huge surge in early applications
this year because no one really knows for sure," he
said. "It could have been any number of reasons,

metropolitan market, which occurred just a week be-
