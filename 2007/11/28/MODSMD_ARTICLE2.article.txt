# Early applications stable
## Other selective schools' early application figures on the rise 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
When Harvard and Princeton gave the axe to
early admissions last year, Stanford might have ex
pected the size of its early application pool to in
crease. A number of elite colleges that offer the same
kind of non-binding "early action" program as Stan
ford have indeed experienced a spike in applications,
but Stanford is not among them.
4,636 candidates applied for early admission to

the University last year, according to Director of Ad
mission Shawn Abbott, who declined to give a final
count for this year's early action program due to ex
tensions for Southern California applicants affected
by last month's wildfires. But he said that the number
is not expected to exceed last year's total.
"At this point we're sure that our final total will
crest nearly exactly where we were last year," Abbott
said in an email to Hie Daily.
Other universities that compete with I larvard and
Princeton for applicants have seen large increases in
early applications this year. According to The Wall
Street Journal. Yale received 4,820 early action appli
cations as of Nov. 14, up 36 percent from last year.
'ITie University of Chicago received 42 percent more
early applications than last year, Georgetown's early

applications increased by 30 percent and MIT is ex
pecting a 10 percent increase from its 3.493 early ap
plications last year.
Abbott believes that a number of factors may
have played a role in preventing an increase in Stan
ford's numbers, including the fires that prompted
widespread evacuations in parts of Southern Califor
nia.
"It's somewhat reckless to speculate as to why we
didn't experience a huge surge in early applications
this year because no one really knows for sure," he
said. "It could have been any number of reasons,
ranging from a natural disaster in our second largest
metropolitan market, which occurred just a week be-
fore the application deadline, to the
idea that Harvard's and Princeton's
policy changes just [didn't] drive our
applicants to make any different de
cisions than they would if those two
institutions still had early pro
grams."
Critics of the early admission
program say that the process bene
fits students who attend well-funded
high schools and can afford private
guidance counselors. Harvard and
Princeton announced last year that
thev would abandon their early ad

mission programs in an effort to in
crease access for disadvantaged stu
dents. Most schools have left their
programs in place, and students who
would have applied early to Har
vard or Princeton are now applying
to rival schools to secure spots in the
incoming class as early as possible.
Abbott said he would like to be
lieve that Stanford applicants took
the advice expressed both in the ap
plication and by admission officers,
which urged them not to apply early
to the University unless it was their
first-choice school.
"We beefed up the language in
our application instructions and on
our [Web site] this year, emphasiz
ing this point," Abbott said. "Admis
sion officers were aggressive in mak

ing this 'first-choice' point when
speaking to prospective students on
the road and here on campus. Appli
cants have been strongly discour
aged from using our early program
as a strategy for admission."
Abbott said that the University
does not expect to change any as
pect of its admission process in light
of national trends.
"The bottom line," he said, "[is]
we're thrilled that the same number
of candidates applied to us early this
year. 4.6(H) early action candidates
are more than enough to compete
for the spots we have available in the
( lass of 2012."
