# It's still a "big" game
## 
### 
In a year in which we were crazed
beyond belief here at Stanford
because the Cardinal managed
to win a game against a truly signifi
cant opponent, it's fair to ask just
how big Big Game really is this year.
With Jim Harbaugh's squad gun
ning for just its fourth win of the
year and Jeff Tedford's team look
ing for its seventh after being
ranked No. 2 in the nation at one
point, it's also fair to say that things
could have gone better for both Bay
Area teams this year.
But they didn't. And that's why
Big Game is still exactly that â€” big.
As in significant. As in monumen
tally important.
For the Cardinal, it's a chance to
end the season on a winning note,
but more than that, it could be a val
idation of sorts. A win over the
Bears at home for the team's first
ever conference victory in the new
Stanford Stadium would be a wake
up call to all the faithful alums and
fans still snoozing on this team:
those that are waiting for consisten
cy rather than a single, rollicking
October victory in a stunned Colise
um.
A win would be the Cardinal
telling the world that Stanford's
program is for real, even if this
year's team wasn't. It would be a
sign that the win over USC really
was emblematic of something more,
and not just one of the strangest
aberrations of all time in any sport.
Is it fair that the win hailed as a
signature victory at the start of a
new era of Stanford football has al
ready faded into the recesses of our
collective memories as fans? Proba
bly not.
But that's what happens when
you lose as many winnable games as
Stanford has down the stretch. And
make no mistake that it's happening
as we speak. Every week that goes
by where Cardinal fans wonder
where the offense that scored in the
waning minutes in Los Angeles
went is a week when they wonder
just how real it ever was. Every time
Stanford falls just short, it's more
about how USC lost their perfect
season one October night than how
Stanford regained some measure of
respect.
Especially when so many of the
team's most disappointing losses
have come at home, where all the
newly hopeful local fans saw just
how bad the Cardinal can look
against Washington and just how
close it can come and still fall short
against the abysmal Fighting Irish
last week.
