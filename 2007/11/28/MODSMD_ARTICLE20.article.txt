# It's still a "big" game
## 
### 
In a year in which we were crazed
beyond belief here at Stanford
because the Cardinal managed
to win a game against a truly signifi
cant opponent, it's fair to ask just
how big Big Game really is this year.
With Jim Harbaugh's squad gun
ning for just its fourth win of the
year and Jeff Tedford's team look
ing for its seventh after being
ranked No. 2 in the nation at one
point, it's also fair to say that things
could have gone better for both Bay
Area teams this year.
But they didn't. And that's why
Big Game is still exactly that â€” big.
As in significant. As in monumen
tally important.
For the Cardinal, it's a chance to
end the season on a winning note,
but more than that, it could be a val
idation of sorts. A win over the
Bears at home for the team's first
ever conference victory in the new
Stanford Stadium would be a wake
up call to all the faithful alums and
fans still snoozing on this team:
those that are waiting for consisten
cy rather than a single, rollicking
October victory in a stunned Colise
um.
A win would be the Cardinal
telling the world that Stanford's
program is for real, even if this
year's team wasn't. It would be a
sign that the win over USC really
was emblematic of something more,
and not just one of the strangest
aberrations of all time in any sport.
Is it fair that the win hailed as a
signature victory at the start of a
new era of Stanford football has al
ready faded into the recesses of our
collective memories as fans? Proba
bly not.
But that's what happens when
you lose as many winnable games as
Stanford has down the stretch. And
make no mistake that it's happening
as we speak. Every week that goes
by where Cardinal fans wonder
where the offense that scored in the
waning minutes in Los Angeles
went is a week when they wonder
just how real it ever was. Every time
Stanford falls just short, it's more
about how USC lost their perfect
season one October night than how
Stanford regained some measure of
respect.
Especially when so many of the
team's most disappointing losses
have come at home, where all the
newly hopeful local fans saw just
how bad the Cardinal can look
against Washington and just how
close it can come and still fall short
against the abysmal Fighting Irish
last week.

It says a lot about just how far
the Cardinal have fallen that a win
over the then-No. 2 Trojans isn't
quite enough to make it known for
certain that Stanford is on the way
up. But a win against the hated
Bears for the first time in six years?
Now that would be a statement
worth making.
And as for the Bears? Well, what
better way to forget about a year
that could've been than a bit of
Schadenfreude against the rival
Cardinal? Indeed.for Berkeley,the
game is a must-win if they want to
secure a bowl bid. And missing out
because they couldn't beat Stan
ford? Now that would be enough to
drive any Bears fan over the edge.
So, while the nation turns its eyes
this Saturday to teams like Missouri.

Oklahoma, West Virginia, LSU and
Virginia Tech, it's okay that here in
our own little corner by the Bay. Big
Game is still a big deal. In fact, I'm
sure both coaches and teams would
n't have it any other way.
Because as one squad is about to
find out, there's no better way to
make up for a lot of disappointment
than one win on one Saturday
against a team you love to hate.
Whether that means that liarbaugh
gets to accept the accolades as a
coach on the rise leading a team on
the path to bigger and better things
in 2008. or just that Tedford can as
suage some of the disappointment
Bears fans have to be feeling over
their disappointing season, some
one is going to be significantly less
stressed out this offseason because
Big Game still matters.
