# Bishop ready to leave her mark in final season
## Swimmer one of Cardinal's all-time greats 
### KATHERINE BELL 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving team has a long tradition
of producing some of the best swim
mers in the country. The list includes
Olympic medalists Jenny Thompson
'95, Summer Sanders '94, Tara Kirk
'04 and current head swim coach Lea
Loveless Maurer '94.
In her last year of NCAA compe
tition, senior Brooke Bishop is
poised to join the exclusive list as one
of Stanford swimming's all-time
greats.
The versatile Bishop is a top-five

all-time for the Cardinal in four dif
ferent events: the 50 and 100-yard
freestyles, and the 100 and 200 back
strokes. She has led the team since
her freshman year, when she won the
50 free at the Pac-10 Championships
and led three Stanford relay teams to
the finals at the NCAA Champi
onships. In fact. Bishop was a US Se
nior National champion in the 50-
meter freestyle before even begin
ning her Stanford career.
But Bishop's accomplishments
don't stop there. She has steadily im
proved each season, going on to
break Avery Aquatic Center pool
records, final individually at the
NCAA Championships and be
named the Stanford/Met-Rx Student
Athlete of the Week three times. In
her Stanford career, she is a 12-time
All-American and 4-time Pac-10
champion and is currently in her sec

ond consecutive year as team cap
tain.
According to Bishop, her proud
est moment as a swimmer occurred
this past summer, when she repre
sented both Stanford and Team USA
at the World University Games. Al
though the meet was her first inter
national team experience. Bishop did
not falter in the face of pressure. In
fact, she finished sth in the 50-meter
freestyle, 4th in the 100-meter back
stroke and 2nd in the 400-meter
medley relay along with Stanford
team member sophomore Elaine
Breeden.
Maurer emphasized the indispen
sable role Bishop has played in the
swim team's success over the past
three seasons.
"Brooke has been a big part of
our team," Maurer said. "Swimming
wise, she's our relay person, our

sprint person, our weight-lifting per
son. She believes in what we're
doing. She's a strong presence in the
individual events, and she dramati
cally improves our relays."
Born and raised in nearby Los
Altos, Bishop was always familiar
with Stanford's swimming and diving
tradition. However, it wasn't until
her recruiting trip during her senior
year of high school that she knew
Stanford was the place for her.
"I chose to come to Stanford be
cause of the team atmosphere," said
Bishop. "I really fit in with the team
my senior year in high school, and I
think it's actually gotten better every
single year since then. Everyone on
the team is really happy and support
ive of everyone else, focusing on how
they can help each other succeed."
Although she may have accumu
lated a lengthy list of successes in the

pool, meeting her fellow students has
been one of Bishop's favorite things
about Stanford.
"1 have met so many amazing
people here," she said. "In my fresh
man dorm, not only were there
amazing athletes, but there were
people who had been professional
ballerinas and one guy who had writ
ten and published two children's
books. So it has been a really good
experience to be around people like
that. I don't think 1 would be able to
get that experience at many other
colleges."
Swimming for Stanford is a full
time job in itself, but Bishop epito
mizes the Stanford student athlete,
working hard to succeed in the class
room as well.
"Being a student athlete at Stan
ford takes a lot of time management
and focus, so a lot of times during the
week it's a lot of school work," said
Bishop,a product design major in the
Department of Mechanical Engi
neering. "But product design has
been really fun. I've designed a
whole bunch of different products."
As for after graduation?
"I'm really into the sporting
equipment thing, so maybe I'll do
that when 1 graduate," Bishop re
marked.
According to Maurer, Bishop is a
natural-born leader and role model
for the rest of the team.
"We have a young group, so it's
really nice to have her here," said
Maurer. "In terms of leadership,
she's got a really even disposition but
a fierce competitive fire underneath.
And that's a good balance for our
group. She's able to keep us calm but
hungry, and have a good sense of
humor along the way We wish that
we could have Brooke for another
year."
Even as a Stanford swimming vet
eran. Bishop still appreciates being a
Stanford swimmer.
"1 always feel really proud that I
go to Stanford when people in the
airport ask where we're from," she
said. "That's a really special feeling."

As for after graduation?
"I'm really into the sporting
equipment thing, so maybe I'll do
that when 1 graduate," Bishop re
marked.
According to Maurer, Bishop is a
natural-born leader and role model
for the rest of the team.
"We have a young group, so it's
really nice to have her here," said
Maurer. "In terms of leadership,
she's got a really even disposition but
a fierce competitive fire underneath.
And that's a good balance for our
group. She's able to keep us calm but
hungry, and have a good sense of
humor along the way We wish that
we could have Brooke for another
year."
Even as a Stanford swimming vet
eran. Bishop still appreciates being a
Stanford swimmer.
"1 always feel really proud that I
go to Stanford when people in the
airport ask where we're from," she
said. "That's a really special feeling."
