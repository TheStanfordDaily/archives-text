## Atheist and Christian duel on God's existence Debate touches on reason, morality and the Bible 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Fellowship in Christ at Stanford
(FICS) sponsored a debate last night be
tween an atheist and a Christian apologist in
Tresidder Oak West, meditating on one of the
oldest and most important philosophical
questions: Is there a God?
Representing the atheist viewpoint was
David Fitzgerald,a prominent author and co
ordinator for San Francisco Atheists, while
Chang Yuon of Grace Church in Pleasanton
supported the Christian side. The two de
baters squared-off before a packed audience
of students and visitors from both sides of the
issue, with some cheering for Fitzgerald and
others sporting Bibles in hand and wearing t
shirts warning that only Jesus can save you
from Hell.
The nearly two hour-long debate kicked
off with the sounds of "Eye of the Tiger" by
Survivor. At the onset. Fitzgerald made it
clear that he and Yuon. who have debated
each other before in other venues, do not take
theological arguments personally.
"We are not Jerry Springer guests, we are
not gladiatorial opponents," Fitzgerald said.
"Chang and 1 actually like each other verv

much, we just think the other is completely
wrong."
Throughout the course of their debate,
Fitzgerald and Yuon disagreed fundamental
ly on issues regarding the nature of the uni
verse, the validity of the Bible, the philosoph
ical basis for knowing good and evil, science
and. most importantly, whether it is possible
to prove or disprove the existence of Clod.
Yuon, as a Christian apologist, spoke in
defense of the existence of the Christian God,
and based much of his argument against
Fitzgerald's atheism on the claim that only a
being with omniscient knowledge of the uni
verse could know for certain that God does
not exist.
"For Christians it is not that God is only in
the things we cannot explain, but in all the
things we can explain," Yuon said. "Dave has
to subscribe omniscience to something else.
In order for Dave to be a consistent atheist,
he has to be an inconsistent one."
One point on which Fitzgerald and Yuon
were more or less in agreement was that the
existence of God cannot be proven through
naturalistic reason, a point which Fitzgerald
used to refute God's existence and which
Yuon took as evidence that Fitzgerald had no
rational basis on which to make that claim.
As the focus of the discussion shifted to
wards more specific aspects of the Bible and
Christianity. Fitzgerald stated a long list of in
stances in which the Christian God of the
Bible is portrayed as a barbaric and cruel

"Bronze Age" deity, whose behavior was
more like that of a "drunken, bipolar God."
During the question exchange, Fitzgerald
asked Yuon whether a number of incidents in
the Bible ascribed to God which he found re
pulsive — such as the massacre of the Midi
anites by Moses or Paul's mandate that
women remain silent in church — could be
considered just, to which Yuon responded
that if God ordered it to be done then it was
correct.
Fitzgerald cited "reason" and "compas
sion" as his grounding principles, while Yuon
doubted that Fitzgerald could make any de
finitive moral judgment without an absolute
concept of good and evil.
"Human values are important to us be
cause we are human." Fitzgerald said. "Yes,
everyone has morality around the world, but
not everyone agrees on what is moral."
The responses from the audience through
out the debate were as mixed as the composi
tion of the attendees. While some laughed
openly at Fitzgerald's biblical comparisons,
others reacted with open disapproval.
Following his claim that, "you never see
atheists flying airplanes into buildings or
stoning heretics," one audience member
stood up and shouted."Stalin did! Stalin did!"
Fitzgerald replied that Communism, as he
sees it. is a form of political religion. Later on.
Yuon incited a similar reaction from a mem
ber of the audience, who reacted to his asser
tion that Jesus died only for his followers by

shouting."Jesus died for everyone!"
As the debate coneluded, neither of the
speakers, obviously, had been convinced by
the other's arguments and still remained firm
in their respective convictions. As Fitzgerald
put it,"no matter how well we debate tonight,
the universe is going to keep on going just the
way it always has."
There were mixed reactions among stu
dent attendees as to how well the two men
presented their claims.
Some thought the results were not well
balanced.
"1 am a Catholic, so 1 do believe in God.
but to be honest 1 thought the atheist defi
nitely got the better of the Christian," said
Charlie Capps'lo. who faulted Yuon for bas
ing his arguments too heavily on a Calvinist
doctrine, stating that Yuon "does not speak
for me."
And for others, simply the presence of the
debate on campus was a refreshing change of
pace. Cathy Bonn '11, an agnostic, said she
had a lot of fun listening to the debaters
argue. But this is the first event on campus she
has heard of that has incorporated the atheist
perspective.
"Jokes I've heard about atheist groups are
that you can't have them because at every
meeting everyone would just go, "So, you be
lieve in God vet? No.'"
