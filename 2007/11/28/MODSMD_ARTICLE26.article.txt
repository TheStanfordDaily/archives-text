## Senators discuss '08 plans ASSU takes Rumsfeld talk in new direction 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Senators were greeted by a large
picture of Donald Rumsfeld staring
straight at them as they arrived at last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting, during which senators
tried to wrap up this quarter's main
issues — Rumsfeld included —by
giving an update on committee
progress and discussing upcoming
winter quarter projects.
While some students across cam
pus are upset that the Senate did not
pass a bill officially opposing former
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's ap
pointment to the Hoover Institution
as a distinguished visiting fellow ear
lier this month, the senators them
selves have moved on. ITiey are in
the process of drafting a bill that
would call for a forum with Rums
feld. Stanford students and faculty.
"1 don't think anyone really
walked away feeling really good."
said Tim Ford '10, about the Rums
feld bill. "I was thinking we could do
a town hall sort of event that would
bring Rumsfeld out in front of the
students."
"Many were disappointed with
the outcome of the Rumsfeld bill,"
added Senator Sarah Golabek-
Goldman '10. "By supporting and
helping organize a town hall, the
ASSU will make a tangible effort to
voice student concerns and address
the issue."
Earlier this week, the Senate also
began efforts to increase health
awareness in dining halls. Senators
tested the project in Ricker Dining
by placing heart-healthy symbols
next to certain food dishes, in an ef
fort to help students make more
health-ccnscious decisions.
"In th: next couple weeks, we will
try to gauge students' responses and
see if the symbols are effective and if
they make a difference in the stu
dents' eating patterns," Golabek-
Goldman said. "If this project is a
success,we might have more symbols
for other types of dishes."
Senators also discussed the suc
cess of the ASSU Airport Shuttle
Service, which brought students to
San Francisco and San Jose airports
before Thanksgiving Break at a re
duced rate.The ASSU sold a total of
571 out of a total of 672 available
seats — an 88 percent occupancy
rate. According to ASSU Vice Presi
dent Mondaire Jones '09, ASSU Ex
ecutives are planning to meet with
senators and Graduate Student
Council members to discuss plans for
a winter break shuttle service.
