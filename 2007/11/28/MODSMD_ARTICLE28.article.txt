### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
UCLA History Prof. Saul Friedlander, an expert on
the Holocaust and the Nazi reign, brought to life the
horror of the 1 lolocaust last night in Cubberley Audito
rium. In "Nazi Germany and the Jews" — a talk organ
ized by the Taube Center for Jewish Studies as part of
the European Studies Speaker Series — Friedlander
chronicled the Nazi regime, narrating true life incidents
experienced by the millions of victims of the Holocaust.
Born in Prague in 1932 to German-speaking Jewish
parents, Friedlander lied to France in 1939 and spent the
duration of the war there in hiding after his parents died
at Auschwitz. His autobiography. "When Memory
Comes." explores his life as an undercover student at a
Roman Catholic school during the German occupation,
recording his memories interrupted by death and
tragedy from Prague in the 1930s to France in the 1940s
to Israel in the 19705.
Friedlander's talk highlighted lives like his that were
darkened by anti-Semitism in war-stricken Europe. His

narrative focused on a series of letters that he found in
diaries lost during the period of turmoil, including one
found in a gutter in Auschwitz.
Letters written by distressed Jewish victims high
lighted the Germans' determination to exterminate
Jews as individuals and as a race. German letters, on the
other hand, spoke about how Jews could not write his
tory because they were "less rational" and "more sub
jective" than the Germans.
Johann Strauss *08 said he felt a greater connection
to the topic when he recently discovered his familial ties
to Germany and the Holocaust.The paternal side of his
family fled Germany in 1939 to avoid the Nazi-imposed
oppression.
"This talk was unique in the way that it struck a
chord in me," he said,"recapturing the voices of people
who actually experienced the torture, including my
great grandmother who was sent to a concentration
camp."
Alexander Rafael Gorbis '89 was also impressed by
Friedlander.
"It was an eloquent, heartfelt talk by a man who has
well-studied the sources of the event,"he said. "It also
makes us realize the importance of technology to sup
port such narratives that provide a first-hand account of
history that would otherwise be lost to us forever".
