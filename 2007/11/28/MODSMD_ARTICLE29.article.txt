## Businessman pledges $70M to Oral Roberts 
### JUSTIN JUOZAPAVICIUS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TULSA,OkIa. â€” An Oklahoma
City businessman said Tuesday he
planned to donate $70 million to
debt-ridden Oral Roberts Uni
versity, days after the school's
president stepped down amid ac
cusations that he misspent funds
to support a lavish lifestyle.
Mart Green, founder of the
Christian office and educational
supply store chain Mardel,said he
decided to help after watching
media reports about the school,
which recently revealed it was
more than $50 million in debt. He
never attended the university and
does not know the Roberts fami
ly, he said.
"Let's straighten the ship,"
Green said at a news conference
at the university. "Let's get in
tegrity. Let's get trust built back,
and the financial issues will go
away."
Green said he would immediately
give $8 million, to be followed by
a review of the university's finan
cial records that could take as
long as 90 days. His family must
approve the review before giving
the remaining $62 million, he
said.
Also TUesday, the evangelical
school's regents said they planned
to separate the finances and lead
ership of the university from the
Oral Roberts Evangelistic Asso
ciation and accepted the resigna
tion of university president
Richard Roberts, the son of the
school's founder and namesake.
The Oral Roberts Evangelistic
Association is a nonprofit min
istry that produces television and

radio programs, including "The
Hour of Healing," among its
many outreaches, according to its
Web site.
The university has been under
the ministry since its inception in
1963, an arrangement that critics
say led to co-mingling of funds
and a blurring of leadership roles.
Richard Roberts will remain
chairman of the association and
be allowed to live in his universi
ty-owned home near campus for
the time being, said George Pear
sons, the regents' chairman.
Roberts and his father will re
main "spiritual regents," who can
not vote on university matters.
Richard Roberts' wife, Lindsay
Roberts, stepped down as a re
gent about a month ago, Pearsons
said.
"(Richard) felt like it was im
portant to him to be able to move
out of the way in order for the uni
versity to continue on a more sta
ble path," Pearsons said.
On Friday, Roberts announced
his resignation from the job he has
held since 1993, after a lawsuit ac
cused him of misspending univer
sity funds on extravagances in
cluding shopping sprees, a stable
of horses, and a Bahamas senior
trip on the university jet for one of
his daughters.
In a previous interview with
The Associated Press, Roberts
and his wife denied wrongdoing.
He said the lawsuit amounted to
"intimidation, blackmail and ex
tortion."
Last month. Oral Roberts re
turned from semiretirement in
California to help guide the
school he founded in 1963 while
his son was on temporary leave.
