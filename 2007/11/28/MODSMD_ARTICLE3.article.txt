# Gaieties lights up MemAud
## 
### MARCO HERNANDEZ 
Gaieties, Stanford's annual Big Game Week theatri
cal tradition, will debut tonight at Memorial Auditorium.
"Herbert I loover and the Order of the Bearclaw." put on
by the Ram's Head llieatrieal Society, boasts song and

dance, takes on world

politics and discusses

what it means to be a
Stanford student, all
with Gaieties' signa-

ture risque antics.
While the show un

doubtedly will not be

everyone's cup of tea. Gaieties is for the most part a
crowd-pleaser that shouldn't be missed.
"Order of the Bearclaw" takes a group of Stanford
frosh through an adventure to save Stanford from the
claws of a Machiavellian-yet-inane band ofCal students.
Paul, a Cardinal who has lived on campus far longer than
any grad student to date, leads the Stanford team. Ac
companying him are Molly, a TYpe A premed,TUcker, a
recently-out gay frosh, and Paul's wealthy and gorgeous
ex-girlfriend, Kitty.
Yet again, Cal has a plan to bring forth Stanford's ru
ination. Paul and company must find a way to stop the
Cal squad from bringing Stanford down.
With a cast of 28 actors — and dozens more students
involved in production — "Order of the Bearclaw" de
livers in a way that performances in years past have not.
The final versions of the song and dance numbers are
more polished than in previous years. Past Gaieties left
many with the idea that the show's actors and dancers
did not do either numbers particularly well.
Although the show has no Nathan Lanes or Sandra
Bernhardts, this year's performers up the ante, lbey
demonstrate that not only can they memorize lines and
rudimentary dance routines, but they can also do it in a
way that is convincing. Performers simply deliver a more
natural performance than in years past.
"This year's cast is extremely talented," said Stefan
Vraspir '09. the show's producer. "They can sing and

dance, which allows for Gaieties to
become more of a legitimate prod
uct. People dismissed Gaieties in the
past because cast members were per
haps not particularly good at one or
the other. But this year's cast is just
very talented and can do away with
that idea."
Earlier in the year, the submission
of the Gaieties script to administra
tion officials made headlines. Some
students questioned whether the ad
ministration should meddle with a
student-run production. If the ad
ministrative revisions caused any
changes to the script, it is indis
cernible.
According to Olivia Harewood

09, veteran and show director, the
affair was blown out of proportion.
"We met with other members of
the Stanford community, not just
with the administration," she said.
"By talking to members of the Stan
ford community, we were able to get
points of view from outside the pro
duction. If anything, these meetings
helped to better the show."
The performance, still undergo
ing technical tweaks at the time of
Monday's preview, went by without
major glitches. But attendees might
want to grab a libretto, as the singing
is sometimes overpowered by the
show's own orchestra. Some of the
best jokes in the show lay within the
songs.
Audience members should be
careful to focus on specific parts of
the stage during some of the show's
spoken portions. At times, multiple
mini-stories take place in different

parts of the stage. Some of the side
action is connected to the main plot,
while the rest pokes fun at other as
pects of life as a college student in
general. As entertaining as the mini
stories are, trying to focus on the en
tire stage may cause one to lose track
of the main storyline. Expect cameos
by Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pres
ident John Hennessy, and Dean
Richard Shaw.
"Order of the Bearclaw" is defi
nitely not as Harry Potter-ish as the
title would suggest. However,
though there might not be any flying
brooms, the talented cast does con
jure up a magical performance.
"Herbert Hoover and the Order
of the Bearclaw" rolls into its three
day engagement at Memorial Audi
torium beginning tonight at 8 p.m.
