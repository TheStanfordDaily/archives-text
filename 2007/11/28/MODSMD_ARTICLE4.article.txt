## ASSU Shuttle makes successful run, few kinks Program increases from 20 percent capacity to 88 percent 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many students gave thanks last week for
a shuttle system organized by the ASSIJ
that carried them to nearby airports before
Thanksgiving Break.
ASSU Vice President Mondaire Jones
'09 said the shuttles ran at an occupancy
rate of 88 percent during the two-day oper

ation. with 591 of the 672 available scats
sold. He said that capacity was lower than
planned due to the fact that shuttles were
not able to run on an hourly schedule. But
20 of the shuttle time slots were completely
sold out.
The ASSU voted to reapprove the shut
tle funding for Thanksgiving Break earlier
this month, while the GSC moved to ear
mark $2,706 from the Graduate Student
General Fee Reserve to co-sponsor the
$7,200 shuttle program.The shuttles, which
carried a per-ticket cost of $10. ran to both
San Francisco and San Jose International
Airports on Friday and Saturday of last
week from 5 a m to 6 p.m.

The program has not always been

as popular as it was last week. At
the end of spring quarter last

year, the ASSU launched a
test program that ran

below 20 percent capaci
ty. with only 374 seats
sold out of a total 1,980.
But even with the im-

proved usage rate this year.

a few kinks remained in the program.
Three reported students were left behind
by the shuttles.

ITiat number is down from the
eight to 10 who were passed up dur
ing the June trial run, but it still rais
es concerns in the ASSU about con
tinuing to use Compass Transporta
tion as a shuttle services vendor.
ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08, who used the shuttle himself, ac
knowledged that, though it was a fi
nancial success, the program was far
from flawless.
"1 definitely had to correct some
errors made bv the driver in the

route and stops," he said. "So 1 know
first hand that the service was not
perfect."
Senator Jose Benchimol '08 —
the lone dissenter in last spring's
vote to fund the program — sup
ported the latest incarnation of the
bill, citing smaller busses, higher tick
et prices and more demand from stu
dents as improvements to the pro
gram.
"As it was before, we had to pay
for the service with general fees," he
said. "Now the service is sustainable
and we won't need to [use general
fees next time]."
Due to the general smoothness of
the program's execution and the
high occupancy rate, Benchimol said

he expected that the shuttle pro
gram would continue in the future,
adding that the ASSU is considering
advertising on the shuttles as a way
to offset the costs and lower ticket
prices.
Avula said he was hopeful that
the service would be continued for
the end of this quarter and in the fu
ture, although specific plans for such
a program have not yet been laid.
"1 think the service this break was
very cost-effective,efficient and con
venient for Stanford students,"
Avula said. "I hope it continues to
run in the future."
