## ASSU Shuttle makes successful run, few kinks Program increases from 20 percent capacity to 88 percent 
### LOREN NEWMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many students gave thanks last week for
a shuttle system organized by the ASSIJ
that carried them to nearby airports before
Thanksgiving Break.
ASSU Vice President Mondaire Jones
'09 said the shuttles ran at an occupancy
rate of 88 percent during the two-day oper

ation. with 591 of the 672 available scats
sold. He said that capacity was lower than
planned due to the fact that shuttles were
not able to run on an hourly schedule. But
20 of the shuttle time slots were completely
sold out.
The ASSU voted to reapprove the shut
tle funding for Thanksgiving Break earlier
this month, while the GSC moved to ear
mark $2,706 from the Graduate Student
General Fee Reserve to co-sponsor the
$7,200 shuttle program.The shuttles, which
carried a per-ticket cost of $10. ran to both
San Francisco and San Jose International
Airports on Friday and Saturday of last
week from 5 a m to 6 p.m.

The program has not always been

as popular as it was last week. At
the end of spring quarter last

year, the ASSU launched a
test program that ran

below 20 percent capaci
ty. with only 374 seats
sold out of a total 1,980.
But even with the im-

proved usage rate this year.

a few kinks remained in the program.
Three reported students were left behind
by the shuttles.
