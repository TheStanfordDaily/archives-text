## Men stomp Sacramento St. 84-58 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Led by a 14 point effort from junior guard Anthony Goods
and 13 points from sophomore center Robin I ope/.. Stanford
clobbered lowly Sacramento State 84-58 last night.
"This is a veteran team and we knew what to expect." said
coach Trent Johnson. "They know how to win. and for us to be 7-

1 with one hiccup, so to
speak, is impressive
considering we've
played seven or eight
guys. We put these guys
in different combina
tions. trying to get the
first seven or eight guys
in different situations."
While it must have
been an ideal game
from Johnson's perspec
tive — everyone played
well enough and the
outcome was never in
doubt — it was a listless
one from fans' for those
same reasons. No one
had a truly breakout
game and the 20-point
margin throughout the
contest was too much to

excite and too little to amuse.
"I think everyone knows that we need to clean some things
up," said senior forward Taj Finger, who scored nine points in ten
first-half minutes with a four-inch, 30-pound advantage over
many of his defenders. "Some guys got out of rhythm because we
played some different groups."
I"he Hornets (1-6) may be the worst team Stanford will play
all year, and looked it early on in a half-full Maples Pavilion.
Ibe Cardinal starters pushed Stanford to a 10-3 lead five
minutes in. the second string extended the margin to 25-10 five
minutes later and the 42-25 halftime score signaled that the rout
was on. Nine team blocks and thunderous dunks from Lope/.

Freshman Josh Owens scored six in Stanford's 84-58 victory
over Sacramento State. The Card's leading scorers were junior
guard Anthony Goods and sophomore center Robin Lopez.
freshman forward Josh Owens and senior
forward Fred Washington punctuated peri
ods of quiet in Maples.
The Card claimed a 40-31 edge on the
boards and held the Hornets to 37 percent
(22-of-60) shooting — including an atro
cious 28 percent (9-of-32) in the first half
when the contest could still rightfully be de
scribed as one.
Goods' move to his natural position of
shooting guard (he spelled junior Mitch
Johnson at point in earlier games) may have
helped, allowing him to focus on defense; he
held Leath to just four first-half points on l
of-7 shooting. Goods is shooting 45 percent
this season, a major improvement from the
37 percent figure of his first two years.
Next up on Stanford's schedule is a .Sun
day visit to Colorado (4-2), the team's last
game of the fall quarter. Then, after a two
week respite from games, sophomore for
ward Brook Lopez is expected to return
from academic ineligibility in time for the
Dec. 19 game against Santa Clara (4-1).
After that, the caliber of the Cardinal's op
ponents will jump light years as the team
moves into conference play in the superior
flac 10.
"From here moving forward, our honey
moon is over," Johnson said.
Johnson's certainly right, which is why it
is likely that Brook Lopez may not exactly
have to"play his way back into the rotation."
Experts are claiming this could be the
strongest Pac-10 ever, though early returns
have been mediocre at best.
But whatever Stanford and the league's
ultimate fate, the honeymoon's sure been
nice while it lasted. With a 7-1 record going
into Sunday's game at Colorado, the Cardi
nal just hopes it can drag it out five more
days.
