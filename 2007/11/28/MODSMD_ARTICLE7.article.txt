## GRADUATE LIFE It's all your fault 
### 
Yes, I am normally filled with
self-loathing, but today I prefer
to blame other people for
everything bad in the world. For exam
ple. global warming is clearly the fault
of the Eskimos. Poverty comes from
Tibetan monks. And the trade deficit is
all due to the Freemasons. With this in
mind. I've been trying to figure out
who's to blame for grad school.
In the beginning, my considerable
pondering on this subject led me
nowhere. I paced around for many
days trying to figure out who was out
to get us all. But to no avail: I was
stuck. Until 1 thought of you.
Yes. it's your fault. All of you are
making me and the rest of us miser
able.
(Just to clarify, "you" are the face
less mass that is the undergraduate
population of Leland Stanford Junior
University. "Us" refers to the charm
ing individuals that make up the vari
ous graduate programs.)
Now 1 realize you might think
we've been down this road before.
After all. columns in this space tend to
follow a well-defined cycle: from "grad
school is unpleasant" to "undergrads
irritate me" to "grad school is unpleas
ant." However, think of this piece as
bridging the gap — it's a meta-column
explaining why undergraduates are to
blame for my personal hell.
Life in your mid-twenties (okay,
damn you, late twenties, but let me
dream) really shouldn't be that bad.
In fact, most people seem to enjoy it.
So what makes our lives so different
from theirs?
You. All you young folk with your
shiny, taut skin. With your lithe bodies,
unravaged by the excesses of age. You,
with your youthful exuberance. You
fool us into thinking that the path to
happiness lies in recapturing our
younger days.
Ihe pursuit of days past is both an
easy and tempting mistake to make.
Undergraduate days are fun. We're
"lucky" enough to find ourselves back
in school; surely the obvious way to
make t lie most of it is to run around re
capturing the halcyon days of irre
sponsibility.
Ihe problem is, though, being per
petually young prevents you from
growing up. Moreover, trying to be the
everlasting undergrad leaves you
missing out on those experiences
unique to life as a twenty-something.
C irowing up and moving on can be
an uncomfortable thing. It's pretty dif
ficult to get through any stage of life
without having regrets about missed
opportunities, and the second chances
grad school seems to offer are hard to
ignore. But in life, every opportunity
taken is another one lost.
Socializing has never been one of
mv strong points (I really do dislike
other people), but I make occasional
exceptions. Last Thursday was one. as I
found myself hosting a turducken
based (thank you America, for your
great contribution to the pantheon of
to* kI ) Thanksgiving for a set of assorted
friends from school and elsewhere.
While not necessarily an entirely
grown-up activity, there was some
thing about the setting and the atten
dees that felt far removed from school
and its concerns. As the evening pro
gressed and the food-induced stupor
settled over me, I found myself look
ing around at my guests and realizing
that — without the contamination of
youth — life as an adult might not be
such a bad thing after all.
