## Author urges Stanford to foster political activity

4 mid ongoing criticism of our generation's
/% political apathy, a new hook — co-authored
/ \ hy Josh Corngold. a doctoral candidate in
j education — offers hope. His book,
JL ML. "Preparing Undergraduates for Responsi
ble Political Engagement," written alongside Anne
Colby, Thomas Ehrlich, and Elizabeth Beaumont,
demonstrates that there has been an increase in voter
turnout among young people.
Corngold said that a number of factors have led to
this increase in student political participation.
"There are a lot of issues that affect young people,"
he said. "The Iraq War is something that young people
care a lot about and are interested in. The past few na
tional elections have been extremely close and that in
general generates a lot of interest."
His book gauges the effectiveness of college pro
grams working to increase student political engage-

ment.
But despite these increases in political participation,
Corngold said that overall, students' attitudes toward
politics remain bleak.
"A lot of the survey data reflects that in

the past thirty to forty years,
there's been a sharp down
turn in political participa
tion," he said. "A lot of this
has to do with cynicism
about politics, feeling like
politicians are dishonest,
that government can't be
trusted and that it's ineffec
tive at solving problems. So
it's not just youth who have
shied away from politics;
the population as a whole
is less engaged, although i
youth are particularly /
disengaged." 1
The book explored
methods by which colleges
across the nation have tried to
increase political participation

"We looked at community colleges,small liber
al arts institutions, and some large universities," he
said. "There was one program at the University of
Maryland where students who were interested in
politics came together and lived in the same dorm.
From there, they would learn together, do service
projects together, or invite speakers in their dorm."
Corngold said the book narrowed down five differ
ent approaches that teachers, faculty, and professors
could take in the classroom to get their students in
terested and involved in politics.
"The five 'pedagogies' are: first, political dis
cussion and deliberation; second, political ac
t

tionsand research processes; third, speaker invitations;
fourth, internships or placements which typically goes
by the name of service learning; and fifth, structured re
flection, that is keeping journals and reflecting on in
ternships and readings," he said.

The book also defines three central goals of
political education: civic and political

knowledge and understanding, polit
ical motivation, and practical
skills of democratic participa
tion.

In the past few years
mainstream media corpora
tions such as YouTUbe and
MTV have initiated cam
paigns aimed at increasing
political activity among
youth. Corngold said that
while incorporating media
and the internet in the po
litical process may be ef
fective, blogs and chat
rooms can never replace
face-to-face interaction be
tween politicians and vot
ers.
As for political activism
here at Stanford, Corngold
said, "Stanford is in

better shape than
many campus
es, but

political activity is still low.There's a lot that the campus
can do institutionally to get students more involved in
politics."
