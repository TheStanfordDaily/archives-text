VILLIERS-LE-BEL, France —
Youths rampaged for a third night in
the suburbs north of Paris and vio
lence spread to a southern city late

tain rioters who have burned cars
and buildings and — in an ominous
turn — shot at officers.
Bands of young people set cars on
fire in and around Villiers-le-Bel.the
Paris suburb where the latest trouble
first erupted, and 22 youths were
taken into custody, the regional gov
ernment said. In the southern city of
Toulouse,2o cars were set ablaze, and
fires at two libraries were quickly
brought under control, police said.
Despite the renewed violence.
France's prime minister said the situ
ation was calmer than the two previ
ous nights. About I,(XX) officers pa
trolled trouble spots in and around
Villiers-le-Bel on Tliesday, he said.
ITie government was striving to

keep violence from spreading in
what was shaping up as a stern test
for new President Nicolas Sarkozy.
The unrest showed anger still
smolders in France's poor neighbor
hoods, where many Arabs, blacks
and other minorities live largely iso
lated from the rest of society.
The trigger was the deaths Sun
day of two minority teens when their
motorscooter collided with a police
car in Villiers-le-Bel, a blue-collar
town on Paris' northern edge. Resi
dents claimed the officers left with
out helping the teens.
