## Editorial Board Women's wallets, health suffer under new bill 
### 
The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005,
which came into effect last January,
changed how drug rebates from Med
icaid are calculated, making it much more
expensive for drug companies to offer dis
counts tor many institutions, including col
lege medical facilities and low-income com
munity health centers. It is now precisely the
women who need the most financial help in
affording birth control — college and low
income women in rural areas — who will be
hardest hit as they observe much higher
prices for prescription contraceptives. The
bill was designed to prevent Medicaid abuse,
but its deleterious effect on women's health
nationwide demands the attention of Con
gress.
Reports by colleges and health clinics
across the country suggest that vending rates
of contraceptive products have experienced
significant decline since the law came into ef
fect. According to national media outlets,
students previously paying under $15 a
month for birth control now face the un
pleasant choice of either budgeting over $50
a month or switching to cheaper and less ef
fective methods. The unpleasant reality is
that as colleges experience double or triple
contraceptive price increases, the likelihood
of women switching to cheaper and less ef
fective methods considerably increases.
F.ven here at Stanford, with fairly gener
ous subsidies and excellent health and sexu
al resource programs, we are not sheltered
from the harmful repercussions of this legis
lation. The co-Director of the Sexual I lealth
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC), Jenna
Whiteley '08. said that due to the law. prices
for birth control have almost doubled in
most cases — the Nuvaßing. for example,
rose from $24 to $48. Stanford bought many
types of the pill under the old prices,but once
those run out — which could be as early as
the end of this year — they will increase in
price as well.
Anjali Dixit '09, the other co-director of
SHPRC .discussed the price problem:"! def
initely think that the increased price of birth
control is going to be a burden on a lot of
Stanford students. Even before prices in
creased. many of my friends complained

about how expensive birth control was. With
the price increase up to around $50 or more
per month for some types of birth control,
it's going to be even more of a stretch for stu
dents on tight budgets."
Caroline Kusin. a teaching assistant for
the SHPRC class, elaborated on what could
happen before students turn to other outlets:
"I find it hard to believe that heightened
complications for accessing birth control will
minimize sexual activities among students.
Instead,for those women who do not want to
sign up for Cardinal Care or find the current
prices in Vaden too steep, it may result in stu
dents engaging in sex using solely a condom
or potentially without protection altogeth
er." Although the number of women making
those poor decisions may not be large, the
mere possibility is disturbing.
For those who truly feel financially crip
pled, one alternative is switching to a cheap
er type of birth control. (Nuvaßing is more
expensive than some combination pills, for
example.) There are also state-funded pro
grams at Planned Parenthood and other
community clinics where birth control is
available at heavily subsidized prices or even
for free.
College students and elected officials ral
lied in Manhattan's Washington Square Park
on Nov. 13 to protest the sharp rise in the cost
of birth control. According to news sources,
the protesters, many of whom were college
students in New York City, reportedly called
on Congress to reverse the changes, arguing
"that affordable birth control was a basic
right for all women."
And they are right. But putting aside the
politics of the issue, our lawmakers should
recognize that this bill, having failed at its
original goal of targeting Medicaid abuse,
needs revision. Some Democrats in Con
gress have already acknowledged the nega
tive consequences of the Deficit Reduction
Act. and have launched into critical rhetoric
and attacks on the Republican ideology. We
can only hope that the criticism is motivated
by an examination of the dangerous reality,
not partisan political reflex. Above all. we
hope the rhetoric can be translated into ac
tion before it is too late.
