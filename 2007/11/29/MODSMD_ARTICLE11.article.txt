# Dirty Cal Student
## Your questions on Cal, answered! 
### 
Last week I requested that people send
me, your resident Cal expert, any
questions or comments they have
about their beautiful rival school, in the spir
it of the Big Game. Here is a selection of
some of the questions and comments I re
ceived. with my responses.
It only seems fitting that you are a dirty Cal
student, as that school yields nothing more
than a derelict collection of unwashed
masses.
It's true — we are indeed unwashed.This is
because Cal students, to preserve our exqui
site skin, actually take dust baths, like chin
chillas. Bathing ourselves in fine volcanic
ash, we remove excess oil and moisture from
our skin, while also protecting ourselves
from lice and mites. We eschew the tradi
tional practice of washing not because we
are unclean vermin, but because we care
about the quality of our skin, as washing is
an excessively harsh treatment. Feel the dif
ference for yourself — next time you see
me. rub a finger along an exposed part of my
skin, and experience the silky smooth exte
rior of a Cal student.
What 's the best way to kill a Cal student —
silver bullet to the heart, crucifix to the heart,
or intravenous infection of a highly concen
trated garlic solution?
Direct methods are always good, and a shot
to the heart would most effectively accom
plish this. I would advise against using silver,
however, as it has antimicrobial properties,
thus lessening the chance that your victim in
question will die from an infection if the bul
let doesn't kill them. While Cal students are
vampire-like, and thus have an aversion to
garlic, an injection of the substance may not
deliver a lethal blow, leaving you with an en
raged but flavorful Cal student on your
hands. On full examination. Cal students
tend to be an un-pious lot. so striking them
down with the wrath of G-d may be best. A
crucifix it is!
Which school has more attractive people:
Stanford or Cal?

In absolute numbers, you will probably find
more attractive people at Cal than at Stan
ford. And some argue that Cal students are
objectively hotter — there have been some
articles about how Stanford students have
less sex than other university students, and
maybe it's because you find less people you
want to have sex with =( . But I'm very
pleased with what I see around Stanford
campus, and Stanford students seem to be
more physically fit than Cal students.

Right on, brother.
Why arc Cal students so much more into the
rivalry between the two schools?
1 agree, Cal students generally do take it
more seriously than intended. With all of the
vilifying of Stanford students that takes
place,you would think that y'all are demon
spawn whose presence taints and corrupts
the earth, on par with people convicted of
crimes against humanity. The Rally Com
mittee at Cal is especially bad — some of
those people would probably sacrifice
themselves to the gods if it meant stopping a
Stanford sporting victory.
You know why Cal students put so much
energy into the rivalry? Because they want
some attention. For whatever reason they are
feeling unloved, so do a good deed at this
year's Big Game and give a Cal student a hug.
Which side are von cheering for this year,
Ziv?
ITiis Big Game I'm actually donning red and
cheering Stanford on. This is my current

Shafir
school, so I will show my apprecia
tion. In my heart, 1 do love the Bears,
but the Stanford crowd is much
more pleasant to be around. Why
does there have to be a rivalry, any
ways? Can't we just set our differ
ences aside, look past the color of
our shirts, and engage in some inter
school loving?
