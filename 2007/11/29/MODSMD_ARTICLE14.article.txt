# Little Ms. Modern
## Progressive yuppie angst 
### 
is all yuppie scum," I was
by my well-meaning friends
Vjat MIT when I told them 1 would be
coming here for grad school. Surely this is an
overstatement, but I can see why they would
be suspicious. Compared to you beautiful,
fashionable, disturbingly athletic people, the
population of my alma mater might charita
bly be described as "scrappy." (In fact,
"Scrappy" is the nickname of one of my
aforementioned friends.)
ITiis is partly due to the characteristic dis
regard for social and hygienic conventions
typical of any tech school campus. I lowever,
much of MlT's grittiness should be attrib
uted to its location in Boston, a city original
ly famous for a pack of eighteenth century
hooligans who got drunk, dressed up like
Native Americans, and dumped 45 tons of
tea into the harbor.
I hese days, Boston is best known for its
not-quite-pleasant weather and its not
quite-classy sports fans. You might think it's
all J. Crew WASPs; check out www.mass
hole.com to see why you would be grievous
ly mistaken (or. in other words, wicked re
tahded).
Anyway, while I completely adore MIT.
Boston and grit in general. 1 must admit that
I was excited to relocate to a campus with
minimal precipitation and a palm-tree-to
people ratio rivaling a Club Med. And the
supposed yuppieness of Palo Alto didn't

worry me either, because I have a dirty little
not-so-secret secret: I have a decent bit of
yuppie in me myself.
No, I'm not rich.and no, I don't use a Mac.
but I do embody many other traits of the
progressive yuppie typology: my newspaper
is The New York Times, my grocery store is
Whole Foods, and my knowledge of Western
European geography is extensive. (Or at
least I think it is because I studied abroad for
a few months.)
And like most of you, I'm one of those
crazies who wants to give driver's licenses to
illegal immigrants, make everyone else get
gay married, and fiendishly tarnish the sanc
tity of whatever other comforting traditions
we have left (the death penalty?). It's the
modern way. baby!
So yes. after years of being mocked for
my yuppie-scum ways in Boston, it certainly
is refreshing to finally be amongst my own
out here in the Bay Area. But alas, as this ar
ticle's title suggests, all is not quite well. Liv
ing in the self-affirming land of the Prius has

forced me to confront my progressive yup
piehood's unpleasant underbelly: hypocrisy.
Yes, we yuppie scum are hypocrites. This
is old and obvious news, but 1 wanted to look
at the inconsistencies of yuppiehood as yet
another example of the conflicted nature of
modernity. You see, progressives are like the
political version of modernists, and we are
just as susceptible to the perplexing contra
dictions of modern life. The especially trou
bling problem with us yuppies, however, is
that we generally don't acknowledge any
contradiction at all.
Looking the other way feels good, of
course, and I do my darndest to do just that
when I fork over way too much money for
my orange-infused organic fair trade dark
chocolate. But my sense of irony is becoming
increasingly difficult to ignore, and 1 have to
wonder if my ideology is as rational as 1 pre
tend it is. (Let me ruin the suspense: it's not.)
Tor example, my inner environmentalist
recently confronted my inner multi-cultural
ist about her penchant for rare, imported
foods from faraway lands, a habit which guz
zles an alarming amount of fuel for transport
and which can potentially devastate a local
ecosystem. Mow can I be smug about both
patronizing local farmer's markets and
being a world-citizen consumer when their
interests are directlv at odds?
