MPAA exec clarifies anti-piracy plans
To the Editor:
Ihis letter regards Kamil Dada's article
("Gov't Acts on File Sharing," Nov. 27). I
would like to make a couple of clarifications.
First, as the article noted, many opponents
of the bill that was introduced in Congress
claim that the legislation would put their fed
eral financial aid in jeopardy. We want to be
clear that the intent of this hill is to add an
anti-piracy plan to the list of reporting re
quirements for which universities are already
responsible. A university that was out of
compliance would have many opportunities
to correct a violation before action is taken

regarding funding.
Another important point to clarify per
tains to the Stanford University DMCA noti
fication policy While the article stated that I
"disagreed" with Stanford's new policy, I ac
tually described the policy of "pay to recon
nect" as "innovative and creative." We are
very interested in seeing the results of this
new policy, which took effect for the first time
in fall 2007.
Also.while the MPAA views legal action as
one means of addressing digital piracy, we
work with universities to encourage adoption
of technologies and other solutions that would
diminish the number of DMCA notices re
ceived by each university, therefore reducing

the potential for individual student lawsuits.
I was disappointed to see omitted from
Mr. Dada's article my expression of appreci
ation for the leadership President John Hen
nessy gives through the Joint Committee of
the Higher Education and Entertainment
( ommunities. which focuses on these issues
nationally. While we do not always agree on
how universities can address the challenges
in coping with these issues in their own net
works, Hennessy has an important role in
these matters.
