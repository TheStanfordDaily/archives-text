Their opponents did not: the Dons shot only 32.8 percent on 21-
64 shooting.
San Francisco found much of their success from behind the
arc. nailing 8-21 three-point shots. Junior guard Shay Rollins, the
younger sister of reigning National League MVPJimmy Rollins
of the Philadelphia Phillies, was the game's top scorer with 19
points. Rollins, along with senior forward Dominique Carter
and junior forward Necolia Simmons, who had 12 points each,
led the Dons against Stanford. Simmons also contributed 11 re

Derveer's squad blocked nine shots, including four by sopho
more center Jayne Appel. Stanford's swarming defense pre
vented USF from finding passing lanes, and, on many occasions,
the Dons had to rush their shots as the shot clock ran down.The
