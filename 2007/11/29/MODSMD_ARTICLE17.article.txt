## Stanford rolls into Austin for Texas tourney 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim team will be
heading down to Austin. Texas to face the
Texas Longhorns in the Texas Invitational,
which starts today and concludes on Saturday.
No. 2 Arizona will also be competing in the
meet held at the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas
Swimming Center.
The Cardinal has two wins on the year thus
far, against LSU and Washington.
Stanford is coming off of a particularly im
pressive performance at the Nike Cup Invita
tional last week, in which sophomore Eugene
Godsoe put in a time of I minute. 43.91 sec

onds in the 200-meter hack, one of the best
times in the nation. Although Godsoe was off
of the NCAA qualifying standard, he has es
tablished himself as one of the premier back
strokers in collegiate swimming. Godsoe's de
velopment from his freshman to sophomore
year and his emergence as the team's leading
backstroker after the departure of Hongzhe
Sun last year will help Stanford maintain its
excellence in the category.
Stanford's other backstrokers include
sophomore David Ounford. freshman Josh
Charnin-Aker. and junior Scott Lathrope.
Coach Skip Kenney's team boasts strong
depth in sprint events, led by junior Jason
Dunford, freshmen Austin Staab and Jake

Allen, sophomores Alex Coville, Godsoe and
David Dunford and junior Dan Priestley.
Staah. Allen and the Dunford brothers have so
far been the squad's "A" team for the 2(X) free
relay, as both have proven capable of putting
forth sub-20 second times in relay splits for the
50 free.
"My personal goals for the season include:
under 46 in the 1 (K) fly, a low 19 in the 50 free
and a 42.5 in the 100 free," Jason Dunford said.
"Being a citizen of Kenya, I have already
made my Olympic qualifying standards, so I
hope to final in the Olympics in the 1 (K) fly and
lower my African record (of 51.85) [long
course meters]."

11/18 Purdue Invitational
UP NEXT TEXAS INVITATIONAL
? Austin, Texas
GAME NOTES: The No. 3 Cardinal men will face their sec
ond three day competition in the last two weeks, and will
look to topple highly touted Texas and Arizona in Austin
this weekend. At last year's event, the Wildcats carried the
day handily with 787 total team points, trailed by the Long
horns with 689 in second and Stanford with 543 in third.

Ed by Stanford, as Staab, Jason Dunford, and
senior Daniel Heal each won with times of
43.70,43.82 and 43.84. respectively. The Stan
ford 4(H) relay has not been set officially, as the
Cardinal did not swim the 400 free
relay at the Nike Cup.
"1 want to try my hand as a sprint
er and see if I can nail down a relay
spot on the 4 x 100 free relay," Beal
said. "Technique-wise, I have to
focus on getting in and out of my
walls faster. 1 tend to slow down after
the flags, and in a short course race,
that kind of deceleration can be
fatal."
The Cardinal's real depth has
been in its breaststroke squad. Stan
ford has traditionally been strong in
the breaststroke field regularly put
ting swimmers in the top 8 of the
NCAA Finals. This year, the breast
stroke squad is led by junior captains
Paul Kornfeld and Nate Cass.
Stanford's breaststroke crew also
includes junior Chris Ash, senior
Karl Boehringer, freshman John
C'riste, senior Egan Gans. junior BJ
Johnson, sophomore Brede Kolsrud
and junior Paul Zaich. Zaich and
Cass have made the U.S. national
team, putting up the top six times for
the year in 200 meter breast.

"1 am always looking for ways to
help the team reach and exceed its
potential. Our team goal is for the
whole team to go best times at the
end of the season," Kornfeld said.
"But at this point of the season, the
team is focusing on the little things
that will help us at Pac-lOs and
NCA As like attacking our turns, un
derwaters and hard kicking."
Stanford will face tough competi
tion when it takes to the pool today.
Arizona took first in last year's event
with 787 points, Texas second with
787 and Stanford third with 543
points. The Longhorns have ten re
turning Ail-Americans and big
names in the swimming world with
Matt Lowe, Matt McGinnis, Michael
Klueh and Rickey Berens slated to
compete.
Texas also boasts the U.S. Sum
mer Nationals 100-meter freestyle
champion in sophomore Dave Wal
ters. Arizona sends senior Darian
Townsend, winner of hist year's
NCAA finals in the 200 free, and
also Albert Subirats, winner of both
the 100 fly and 100 back.
Stanford is ranked No. 3 in the na
tion going into the meet.
