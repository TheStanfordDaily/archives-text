## Stanford rolls into Austin for Texas tourney 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim team will be
heading down to Austin. Texas to face the
Texas Longhorns in the Texas Invitational,
which starts today and concludes on Saturday.
No. 2 Arizona will also be competing in the
meet held at the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas
Swimming Center.
The Cardinal has two wins on the year thus
far, against LSU and Washington.
Stanford is coming off of a particularly im
pressive performance at the Nike Cup Invita
tional last week, in which sophomore Eugene
Godsoe put in a time of I minute. 43.91 sec

onds in the 200-meter hack, one of the best
times in the nation. Although Godsoe was off
of the NCAA qualifying standard, he has es
tablished himself as one of the premier back
strokers in collegiate swimming. Godsoe's de
velopment from his freshman to sophomore
year and his emergence as the team's leading
backstroker after the departure of Hongzhe
Sun last year will help Stanford maintain its
excellence in the category.
Stanford's other backstrokers include
sophomore David Ounford. freshman Josh
Charnin-Aker. and junior Scott Lathrope.
Coach Skip Kenney's team boasts strong
depth in sprint events, led by junior Jason
Dunford, freshmen Austin Staab and Jake

Allen, sophomores Alex Coville, Godsoe and
David Dunford and junior Dan Priestley.
Staah. Allen and the Dunford brothers have so
far been the squad's "A" team for the 2(X) free
relay, as both have proven capable of putting
forth sub-20 second times in relay splits for the
50 free.
"My personal goals for the season include:
under 46 in the 1 (K) fly, a low 19 in the 50 free
and a 42.5 in the 100 free," Jason Dunford said.
"Being a citizen of Kenya, I have already
made my Olympic qualifying standards, so I
hope to final in the Olympics in the 1 (K) fly and
lower my African record (of 51.85) [long
course meters]."
