## Shootout gimmick has to go 
### 
1 can't really complain about
going home to Chicago last week
for Thanksgiving Break. I ate a
ton of food, got even more sleep,
saw my high school friends and set
what is likely a world record for
most episodes of "The Office"
watched in one week.
There was, however, one sad note
— the break was the longest stretch
of time I had ever gone without at
tending a Cardinal athletic event.
To make matters worse, my 10
days in Chicago coincided with four
home victories over Cal. FOUR!
Men's and women's soccer,
women's volleyball and men's water
polo all dispatched their counter
parts from the school we love to
hate, in games played right here on
our campus. The water polo game
even went into sudden death over
time, and the women's soccer game
ended on penalty kicks.
And I missed it all. I would have
punched myself if 1 hadn't been too
busy eating turkey.
Although 1 would have loved to
have seen any of the victories, I
think the penalty shootout would
have been the most exciting. Noth
ing against sudden death water
polo, but there is almost nothing
quite as dramatic as a one-on-one
showdown between the shooter and
the keeper, at least in my soccer
crazy mind.
This drama is not free, though.
Sadly, it comes at the cost of almost
every other important aspect of the
"beautiful game" — passing, drib
bling, defending, heading, position
ing ... you name it, shootouts don't
have it. Ending a game on penalty
kicks whittles the entire sport down
to two aspects: the shooting ability
of one player, and the stopping abil
ity of another.
So, almost regrettably, 1 think it's
time to scrap the dramatic, exciting,
climactic penalty shootout.
Almost every other sport plays
out its tied games with unlimited
overtimes. Basketball does not use
free throw contests to decide win
ners. Baseball has never resorted to
home run contests. Football doesn't
bring on the kickers to see who can
kick the longer field goal. The list
goes on.
One other sport that does use a
shootout is ice hockey. Interestingly
though, shootouts are only used in
the NHL's regular season, while in
the playoffs games are decided with
unlimited overtimes. This is almost
the opposite of soccer. In college, as
in pro leagues around the world,
regular season games can end in a
draw. But in tournaments, if a match
is still tied after two overtime peri
ods, it is then decided by what many
have called a "gimmick."
Aside from ignoring many of the
sport's crucial facets, shootouts can
often promote undeserving win
ners (not to say that this was the
case in last weekend's game). Soc
cer is already an immensely frus
trating game. Because of the low
scores, a team can often convinc
ingly outplay their opponent and
still lose. A shootout only further
enables that possibility.
While a shootout does involve
skill, the luck factor is increased. In
many cases it is just guesswork —
pick a side to either shoot at or dive
towards and hope for the best. Be
sides that, a team that is being out
played can just pack it in on defense
during a tied game, knowing that
their chances of victory are much
higher in a shootout.
Taking this into account, the ex
citement of the penalty shootout
must be sacrificed for the actual
game of soccer. Actually, sacrificed
is probably too strong of a word.
I low could sudden death soccer not
be exciting, when every trip down
the pitch could end in a game-win
ning goal? In college,overtimes are
already sudden death (or golden
goal, as they are called). Why not
just play until a goal is scored, no
matter how long it takes, the way
it's done in hockey playoffs?
In many pro tournaments the
two overtimes are not golden goal,
and that's fine, but if the score is
still tied at the end of those two,
why not play a third overtime (and
as many others as necessary) that is
golden goal? These competitions
often have limited substitutions as
well, so I would suggest making the
substitutions unlimited in over
time. to avoid the players getting
too fatigued.
These solutions seem so obvi
ous, yet penalty shootouts still exist.
Yes, shootouts can add some excite
ment and also ensure the matches
don't run too long. But it still seems
to me that the game's rule makers
must have forgotten what their old
coaches no doubt preached, as I
have heard from every soccer
coach (not to mention every bas
ketball. baseball and football coach
as well) 1 have ever had: it's a team
game.
So instead of having games be
won and lost by individuals, let's
have the teams do the deciding.
