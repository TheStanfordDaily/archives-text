## Shootout gimmick has to go 
### 
1 can't really complain about
going home to Chicago last week
for Thanksgiving Break. I ate a
ton of food, got even more sleep,
saw my high school friends and set
what is likely a world record for
most episodes of "The Office"
watched in one week.
There was, however, one sad note
— the break was the longest stretch
of time I had ever gone without at
tending a Cardinal athletic event.
To make matters worse, my 10
days in Chicago coincided with four
home victories over Cal. FOUR!
Men's and women's soccer,
women's volleyball and men's water
polo all dispatched their counter
parts from the school we love to
hate, in games played right here on
our campus. The water polo game
even went into sudden death over
time, and the women's soccer game
ended on penalty kicks.
And I missed it all. I would have
punched myself if 1 hadn't been too
busy eating turkey.
Although 1 would have loved to
have seen any of the victories, I
think the penalty shootout would
have been the most exciting. Noth
ing against sudden death water
polo, but there is almost nothing
quite as dramatic as a one-on-one
showdown between the shooter and
the keeper, at least in my soccer
crazy mind.
This drama is not free, though.
Sadly, it comes at the cost of almost
every other important aspect of the
"beautiful game" — passing, drib
bling, defending, heading, position
ing ... you name it, shootouts don't
have it. Ending a game on penalty
kicks whittles the entire sport down
to two aspects: the shooting ability
of one player, and the stopping abil
ity of another.
So, almost regrettably, 1 think it's
time to scrap the dramatic, exciting,
climactic penalty shootout.
Almost every other sport plays
out its tied games with unlimited
overtimes. Basketball does not use
free throw contests to decide win
ners. Baseball has never resorted to
home run contests. Football doesn't
bring on the kickers to see who can
kick the longer field goal. The list
goes on.
One other sport that does use a
shootout is ice hockey. Interestingly
though, shootouts are only used in
the NHL's regular season, while in
the playoffs games are decided with
unlimited overtimes. This is almost
the opposite of soccer. In college, as
in pro leagues around the world,
regular season games can end in a
draw. But in tournaments, if a match
is still tied after two overtime peri
