## Murphy set to call final Big Game Saturday 
### 
The "Voice of Stanford" will call
his last game this Saturday when the
Cardinal takes on Cal in this year's
much-anticipated Big Game. Bob
Murphy '53, who has been calling
Stanford football games since 1%4,
will retire from his position after this
weekend's game
Murphy's connection to the Uni
versity started as early as it possibly
could have: he was born at Stanford
Hospital and grew up in nearby
Burlingame. He graduated from
Stanford in 1953 after competing as a
pitcher on the baseball team.
Despite his exit from the booth.
Murphy will always be close to the
University.
"My association with Stanford
University and Stanford Athletics
has been one of the most important
aspects of my life," he told CioStan
ford.com. "Even though I've had
other jobs and lived in other parts of
the country. I couldn't describe any
separation from Stanford. It's always
been a part of my life, and I've always
been involved in some way or anoth
er."
Fittingly enough. Murphy's last
game will come against none other
than the rival Golden Bears.
