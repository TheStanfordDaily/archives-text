## Fundamental Standard may limit speech 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
Since 18%. the University's Fundamental Standard has
required Stanford students to show "respect for order, moral
ity. personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
Many colleges place similar expectations on their students
by enacting policies that require students to treat each other
with civility and respect.
But a recent judicial ruling said the California State Univer
sity''s civility policy, when used to discipline students, amounts
to an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, potentially
threatening the ability of campuses across the country to en
force such provisions.
U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil said the CSU system cannot
use its civility standard to punish students for offensive state
ments or conduct if they are not threatening the health or
safety of others, the San Francisco Chronicle reported earlier
this month.The ruling was issued in a case where members of
the College Republicans stomped on two flags bearing the
name of Allah during an anti-terrorism rally at San Francisco
State University.
Lauren Schoenthaler, senior counsel in Stanford's Office
of the General Counsel, asserted that the policies in question
do not exist at Stanford.
"Currently, Stanford does not have any written speech
code or civility policy of the type described in the CSU rul
ing," she said in an email to The Daily.
During the mid-19905, the University faced a court chal
lenge to a written policy, commonly referred to as the Grey
Interpretation, which was ultimately held unconstitutional
on free speech grounds.
Issued by the Student Conduct Legislative Council in
1990, the "Free Expression and Discriminatory Harassment"
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard prohibited "dis
criminatory intimidation by threats of violence" and "person
al vilification of students on the basis of their sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation or national or ethnic
origin," according to Schoenthaler.
Nine Stanford students filed a lawsuit against the Univer
sity in May 1994 alleging the policy placed unfair restrictions
on free speech.
In its February 1995 ruling in Corry u Stanford, the Santa
Clara County Superior Court said the language of the Grey
Interpretation violated California's "Leonard Law," which
Schoenthaler said gives private university students the same
rights to free speech on campus as they have off campus.
In a statement to the Faculty Senate made soon after the
ruling, then-President Gerhard Casper said the Grey Inter
pretation relied on the so-called "fighting words" exception
