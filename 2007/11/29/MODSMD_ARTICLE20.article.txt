# Top-notch field awaits Card

### KATHERINE BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford women's swimming and
diving team will leap back into the pool this
weekend for the three-day University of Texas
Invitational in Austin, Texas. The meet will fea
ture five top-20 teams, including the No. 4 Ari
zona Wildcats.
"I'm expecting that they go fast and I'm ex
pecting them to get some (NCAA qualification)
cuts." Stanford coach Lea Maurer said of her
team. "I think we should come out of it with that
feeling that if we can get [NCAA] cuts here, then
we should score individually [at the NCAA
Championships], which 1 think is kind of what
everybody has wanted. It's still a tough assign
ment. but I think it's a doable one."
Both the Cardinal swimmers and divers have
already faced tough competition this year. The
divers traveled two weeks ago to West Ilafayette,
Ind. for the Purdue Invitational, where they put
forth an excellent showing.
Freshman phenom Meg Hostage was the star
of the show, placing first in the 1-meter and sec
ond in both the 3-meter and platform diving
competitions. Other scorers for the Card includ
ed senior Katie Lampe, who finished fourth in
the 3-meter and sixth in platform, and sopho
more Shana karp, with third place in the plat
form and eighth place in the 3-meter event. The
divers' performances at the Purdue Invite should
give them the confidence to excel at this week
end's event in Austin.

WOMEN'S SWIM AND DIVE
Purdue Invitational
UP NEXT TEXAS INVITATIONAL
1 1 /2 C Austin, Texas
GAMt NOTES' The No. 3 Stanford women's swimming
and diving squad will face a tough field at the Texas ir
vitational this weekend including four other top-20
teams.

Meanwhile, the swimmers recently traveled
to Athens. Ga. to face the No. 1 Georgia Bull
dogs. The meet came down to the last event of the
day — the 400 freestyle relay — in which the
Stanford swimmers were out-touched by a mere
two-tenths of a second.
"It was an exceptionally competitive meet; it
was really close," Maurer said. "We had a chance
to spoil [Georgia's] 59 home dual meet winning
streak, and we came really darn close. I think we
left knowing that we were tired, we had made a
tough travel, and still almost took down a pretty
formidable group."
Although the Cardinal came within millisec
onds of victory, the Bulldogs extended their
home dual meet winning streak to an impressive
60 wins in a row.The Cardinal swimmers will no
doubt be looking to avenge their loss this week
end in Texas.
"I was really excited with the Georgia meet,"

Maurer said."We had a tough travel to make |to
Georgia], and we came upon a team that's been
in the hunt to win [at the NCAA Champi
onships] the last few years. They're definitely a
championship team, and we came within a few
points of them into the final relay
Maurer was confident, though, that despite
suffering the heartbreakingly close loss at the
hands of the Bulldogs, her Cardinal squad would
be all the better for the experience.
"1 think we're hungrier," she said. "Our big
people need to be without any shakes, but we
need help from everybody. Everybody needs to
feel like it's their responsibility to win, and I think
that's what we felt coming out of it [the Georgia
meet]. We had strong performances, but when

you say,' Could I have found five hundredths?
( ould I have found a tenth?" that's not dramati
cally different."
And it is that tantalizing possibility of the vic
tory that almost was which Maurer hopes will
spur her team on to big wins in the future.
" I hat just means we need to sharpen up one
tiny little detail," Maurer said. "We need to he
tougher and we need to want it. We talk about
what's driving your engine — is it a one-cylinder
car or an eight-cylinder car? I think we've gotten
better at feeling like we're swimming for our
selves and our tradition and Stanford and each
other."
