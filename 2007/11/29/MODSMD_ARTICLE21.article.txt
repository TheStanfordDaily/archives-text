### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford Cycling Club
embarks on its next race, the top rid
ers will be on new bikes. At last
night's Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting, the GSC — which
oversees Club Sports finances along
with the ASSIJ Undergraduate Sen
ate— approved the Cycling Club?s
request for a $25,000 loan from the
Club Sports reserve.
Stanford Cycling is the umbrella
organization for the University's
Road and Track Racing Team. Moun
tain Bike Racing Team, recreational
rides and cycling-oriented communi
ty service efforts.
According to Cycling Club mem
ber Sasha Kichey '08, A-category rid
ers — the top level riders going to na
tionals — will be the only club mem
bers riding the new bikes.
In the last decade,according to the
Stanford Cycling Web site, the club
has won three national champi
onships and produced three
Olympians and 18 All-Americans.
"The purpose of buying brand
new bikes is to have a unified look."
said club member Samuel Wilson, a
graduate student in chemistry.
Although the new bikes are worth
$5,500 each. Wilson said that Special
ized. the company sponsoring the cy

cling team, hus agreed to sell the
bikes tor $2,600 each, and the Cycling
Club will resell the bikes at the end of
the season.
"We will resell the bikes within the
Palo Alto Community, since there is a
strong biking culture," he added. "By
the end of next year, we will be re
stocking the $25,000 to the Club
Sports reserve."
The Club Sports reserve account,
which is rarely used, reflects unused
funds that have been rolled over from
the end of each fiscal year. Money
that goes unspent by teams goes back
to the reserve.
According to Wilson, there is cur
rently about $80.(XM) sitting in the re
serve account.
Wilson added that the club has a
two-year contract with Specialized.
Next year, the club plans to buy 2009-
model bikes and resell them again at
the end of the year.
According to Chris Elmore '08. di
rector of Stanford Student Enterpris
es Capital Group, the money request
ed will be granted as a loan.
"Instead of us drafting up a loan
document," he said at last night's
meeting, "we decided that [using the
money from the Club Sports reserve]
was slightly better."
