## Old texts to be available online 
### ROBERT TOEWS 
In collaboration with Cambridge
University, Stanford announced
plans earlier this month to make 538
original medieval and Renaissance
manuscripts available to the public in
an online database.
The collection of manuscripts,
which has been located in the Parker
Library at Cambridge's Corpus
Christi College since the 16th centu
ry. accounts for nearly a quarter of all
existing Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. It
consists of handwritten works writ
ten between the 6th and 16th cen
turies. including such famous texts as
Matthew Paris' "Chronica Maiora"
and works by 14th century English
author Geoffrey Chaucer.
Stanford and Cambridge began
negotiations in 2001. Since spring
2003. approximately two dozen part

time workers on both sides of the At
lantic have been working to digitize
the manuscripts, upload them to the
Web and design the Web site through
which the documents will be made
accessible to the public.
While Cambridge provided the
books themselves, "what (Stanford)
brought to the table was an under
standing of the technological end,
from the digitization process to mak
ing the Web site work in a convenient
and effective way," said Director of
Library Communications Andrew
1 lerkovic.
The Andrew W. Mellon Founda
tion provided the bulk of the funding
for the project, which is expected to
cost over $5 million by the time it is
finished in September 2009. A free
beta version of the site is currently
available online at parkerweb.stan
ford.edu, which features approxi

mutely 50 already-uploaded manu
scripts.
Once the project is completed,
however, a paid subscription — of an
amount yet to be determined — will
be required, although the site will re
main free to those in the Stanford
network.
"For scholars, the Parker Library
has historically been notoriously
difficult to gain access to." said Eng
lish Prof. Jennifer Summit, a faculty
consultant on the project. "Digitiz
ing all the manuscripts will facilitate
the academic world's interaction
with the manuscripts tremendously,
encouraging research and teaching,
as well as basically ensuring their
indestructibility for generations to
come."
