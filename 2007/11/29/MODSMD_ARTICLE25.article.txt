## Historical society wins preservation award 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Stanford Historical Society's
Historic Houses Committee re
ceived the 2007 Governor's Historic
Preservation Award earlier this
month for its efforts to preserve old
homes in the community.
The award — the state's only of
ficial honor for historic preservation
— "recognizes the efforts of the
Stanford Historical Society's His
toric Houses Project to interpret,
and gain recognition for, historic
faculty housing on the Stanford
University campus," according to
Historic Houses Project co-Chair
Marian Leib Adams.
In an email to The Daily, Adams
described the actions taken by the
group to preserve 150 historic
homes in the area.

"Through a series of book-length
publications, and house tours, the
society has documented and cele
brated houses in the San Juan subdi
vision." she said.
The San Juan subdivision is an
old part of campus, where the his
toric homes are mixed in with old
Row houses. Several notable early
20th century architects, including
A.B. Clark, Bakewell & Brown,
Birge Clark and Charles Sumner,
designed the homes.
According to Adams, preserving
the homes is necessary to fulfill the
wishes of University founders Ice
land and Jane Stanford.
"One of Governor and Mrs.
Stanford's founding visions was
that Stanford be a residential com
munity for faculty as well as stu
dents," she said. "Our research fo
cuses on the architectural evolu
tion of the oldest campus houses
(which date back to the late 19th
century) and the histories of their
owners and their place in the
founding and early years of the
University."
Currently, the group, which has
focused its preservation efforts on

houses built between 1892 — the
year after the University opened —
and 1930, is compiling a series of
books about the houses.
"We are working on the fifth
book in the series and probably
have at least two more to write be
fore we have covered all the houses
built before World War II," Adams
said.
ITie third and fourth volumes of
the published books are available
for purchase at the Stanford Book
store and at the Cantor Arts Center
gift shop, and all of the books can be
purchased on the Historical Soci
ety's Web site at http://histsoc.stan
ford.edu/hhouses.shtml.
The group held a house tour in
April 2007. just before National
Preservation Month in May. The
tour, which showcased six of the
houses and grounds, attracted more
than 400 walkers.
Adams is convinced of the im
portance of the work the committee
is doing.
"The houses tell wonderful sto
ries, represent a key value of the
founders and are a vital part of Stan
ford history," she said.
