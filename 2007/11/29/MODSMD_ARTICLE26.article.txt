## Taylor's death a mystery 
### JOSEPH WHITE AP SPORTS WRITER 
ASH BURN. Va. - Sean Tay
lor's father urged the Washington
Redskins to make a playoff push,
while Miami police asked for the
public's help to solve the safety's
death in what they suspect was a
random burglary.
Miami-Dade police director
Robert Parker said Wednesday
there were no indications the
slain 24-year-old was targeted or
knew his assailant.
"There's nothing that indi
cates thus far that there's some
kind of involvement on the vic
tim's part," said Parker, adding it
was "more like a random event."
Police have no suspects in the
fatal shooting.

"We have no reason to think
this was anything other than a
burglary or a robbery involving
an intruder," Parker said.
Police are still investigating,
however, a possible link to a Nov.
17 break-in at Taylor's home, in
which police said someone pried
open a front window, rifled
through drawers and left a
kitchen knife on a bed.
Evidence at Taylor's home in
dicates one or more intruders
barged into the house early Mon
day in an attempted burglary.
Parker said. After a confrontation
inside the home, Taylor was shot
once in the upper leg and died
early Tuesday after losing a
tremendous amount of blood.
Taylor's family has scheduled
a funeral service for Monday.
