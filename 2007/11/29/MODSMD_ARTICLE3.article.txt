## PASU aids Filipino veterans 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Six decades have passed since
more than 200,000 Filipino soldiers
fought for the United States in
World War 11. but the 20.000 who
live in the United States today —
most of whom are U.S. citizens —
are fighting to he recognized as vet
erans. The Pi 1 ipino American
Student Union (PASU) is trying to
help by campaigning for the passage
of two new Congressional bills, col
lectively known as the Filipino Vet
erans Equity Act of 2007.
According to Diana Austria '08,
co-chair of PASU's Issues Commit
tee. many of the surviving Filipino
soldiers who have immigrated to the
United States are living just above
the subsistence line in the Los An
geles and San Francisco areas.
"[They are] barely making by on
Social Security income and living in
places like SROs (Single Room Oc-
cupancy)." Austria said in an email
toThe Daily. "Many are in their 70s
or 80s — and dying. To this day
they still are not recognized as full
U.S. veterans and do not receive
the veterans' benefits they rightful
ly deserve and valiantly fought
for."
l ilipino soldiers were called to
serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in
the Far East after President
Franklin I). Roosevelt issued an ex
ecutive order in 1941. After the
Philippines gained independence
from the U.S. in 1946, Congress
passed the Rescission Act. stating
that the soldiers "shall not be
deemed to be or have been military
or naval forces of the United
States." As a result. Filipino veter
ans did not receive full veteran ben
efits following the war.
Since 1946, laws have been
passed to grant the veterans select

benefits, but the Rescission Act still
holds for the over 20.000 former Fil
ipino soldiers who remain in this
country.
In January of this year, the Fil
ipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007
was introduced through two sister
bills. H.R. 760 and S. 57. by Rep. Bob
Filner (D-Calif.) and Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii). The act aims
"to amend Title 38, United States
Code, to deem certain service in the
organized military forces of the
Government of the Commonwealth
of the Philippines and the Philip
pine Scouts to have been active
service for purposes of benefits
under programs administered by
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs."
"Basically, these bills will recog
nize Filipino World War II veterans
as having been active servicemen in
the war and entitle them to the full
range of veterans' benefits," Austria
said.
Various forms of the two bills
have been introduced during nearly
every Congressional session since
the early 19905, Austria added, hut
have fallen short of the number of

co-sponsors needed to advance
each year.
"The biggest argument against
the bills is probably the financial
cost of providing the veterans' ben
efits," Austria said. "[That argu
ment] is quite weak, given that only
20,000 of the original 250.000 re
main. many of [whom] are dying
every year, and so the cost would be
minimal compared to other govern
ment costs."
For more than five years. PASU
has been involved in the campaign
for equal treatment for Filipino vet
erans. The student group works to
raise awareness about the issue,
both by tabling in White Plaza the
Friday before Veterans Day and by
giving educational presentations.
PASU also works with local organi
zations. such as the San Francisco
Veterans Equity Center and Stu
dent Actions for Veterans Equity, to
educate the public about the two
bills.
The group is currently heading a
letter-writing campaign to encour
age Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.),
who represents the state's District

14. which includes Stanford, to co
sponsor the bills, a move Eshoo has
made in the past but has yet to do
this year.
"We are encouraging all mem
bers of the community to support
the campaign by contacting our
local and home representatives to
co-sponsor the bills," Austria said.
For many members of PASU and
the Stanford community, the issue
of veteran inequity hits close to
home.
"Many PASU members, past and
present, have had grandfathers who
served during World War II and are
faced with the reality of the issue,"
Austria said.
Richard Sajor '11 expressed con
cern for his grandmother, who re
ceives minimal benefits for her de
ceased husband's service during the
war. Sajor said that the benefits she
receives are "not equal to those of
veterans who fought in other wars,"
nor are they "enough to support all
of her living expenses."
