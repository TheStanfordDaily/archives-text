# Fate of East Asia collection unknown
## University and Library administrators engage students at town hall meeting 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM DESK EDITOR 
The impending demolition of Meyer Library has for
months raised concerns regarding the future of Stan
ford's East Asia Library (EAL). At a town hall meeting
last night in Kresge Auditorium, library and University
administrators discussed the future of the 540.000-item
Hast Asia collection with faculty and students. The en
tirety of the collection is currently housed on campus,
in the stacks below Meyer Library and at the two on
campus auxiliary libraries — SAL I and SAL 2.
Asa result of Meyer's demolition,as much as 93 per
cent of the EAL collection could eventually be housed
off campus at the auxiliary storage library in I .ivermore
(SAL 3), according to one plan proposed by library of

ficials. Other potential plans call for 20 or 40 percent of
the collection to remain on campus,though administra
tors stressed throughout the night that as of now, no
final decisions have been made.
"'lTie decision has not been made to move one sin
gle East Asia Library book to Livermore." Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D.'B2 said at last night's meeting.
"By the time Meyer comes down, we will have the abil
ities in place for electronic browsing."
Faculty who work with EAL materials fear that
their research — and Stanford's ability to attract top
graduate students and faculty in the field — will be
hurt if their books are moved to SAL 3.
But library officials say that the future of Meyer, and
of the East Asia collection, is out of their hands.
"We're losing a whole building and its subterranean

storage, we're running out of storage anyways, and
we're growing." said Andrew I lerkovic. director of
communications and development of libraries. "We're
between a rock and a hard place."
At last night's meeting. University Librarian
Michael Keller said the University's libraries are cur
rently at 95 percent capacity and gain some 60.000 new
volumes each year.
Meyer's demolition is in part due to the stipulations
put forth in Stanford's General Use Permit (GUP),
which regulates the agreement of land use between the
University and Santa Clara County.
"The overarching context for this is the GUP. which

limits us to two million gross square
feet," Etchemendy said. "It is a quite
limiting restriction."
''The Provost is on record as op
posing using precious square footage
on campus for stacks facilities; he
supports its use for people, not
things," llerkovic said, adding that
the E AL is also "growing aggressive
ly," and "by percentage basis, the
largest growing library we've got."
Last spring, a group of about
three dozen faculty and alumni
wrote a letter to Etchemendy pro
posing the construction of a new
building to house the EAL.
"There are to be no new library
buildings on campus." Keller said on
Apr. 11 in a written response to the
letter. "President Hennessy and
Provost Etchemendy ... directed me
to incorporate the EAL in existing li
brary structures other than Meyer."
In an interview with The Daily,
I lerkovic stressed that Stanford Li
braries did not have control over the
future <>i the EAL.
"We had long hoped to build an
East Asia Library separate struc
ture," he said. "But an East Asia Li
brary sounds to the administration
like a "warehouse, not people," [refer
ring to] the notion of optimizing our
GUP allocation for people."
After receiving Keller's response
to the letter, East Asian .Studies fac
ulty banded together, according to
History Prof. Thomas Mullaney.
"Michael Keller presented this as
a fait accompli that this was going to
happen," he said in an interview with
The Daily.'Mt was just a matter of dis
position of the East Asia Library —
what percentage will be forced into
Green, what percent would go to
Livermore."
Mullaney added that it happened
without consultation with faculty.
East Asia specialists are con
cerned that moving the books off
campus will hurt their scholarly
work.
"Most people are concerned that
they won't be able to browse books."
said Religious Studies Prof. Carl
Bielefeldt, referring to the fact that
when books are stored in SAL 3,
they will not be viewable by the pub
lic until recalled.
llerkovic agreed that the East
Asia collection requires special at
tention, and said the library is doing
everything it can to accommodate
concerned faculty.
"A lot of staff work is now being
done here to figure out how to fit
within [Green Library] a coherent
East Asia reading room with offices

for staff, with a small Special Collec
tions area and presumably the basic
reference collection [will be) a part
of that," he said. "Tlie question is
what else really belongs on campus
and what else can be put into remote
storage for next day delivery. There
is no hard answer."
East Asia specialists also fear the
collection's relocation will hurt fac
ulty retention and graduate enroll
ment.
"Humanists feel more concerned
about this than social scientists or
natural scientists. They see the li
brary as a laboratory for what they
do." said Steven 1 linton, senior asso
ciate dean in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
References to the "library as the
laboratory" for the humanities were
echoed by numerous professors at
last night's meeting.
The EAL debate comes soon
after UC-Berkeley constructed of a
new building devoted solely to its
East Asia collection, a comparison
not lost on Stanford's East Asian
Studies community.
"They are sacrificing the East
Asia field," Mullaney said. "Stanford
is a Pacific international university,
not one that sends the vast majority
of its Asian library stacks to a non
disclosed location closed to the pub
lic. It's not a wise move."
Some East Asia scholars, howev
er, think the situation is already im
proving, as a full-fledged subcom
mittee of the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries (C-Lib) has
been formed.
"1 speak for a number of col
leagues when I say I'm more hopeful
now than a few weeks ago," said His
tory Prof. Matthew Sommer. who is
one of four East Asia specialists on
the subcommittee."! feel much bet
ter about the situation now."
Sommer was not wholly opti
mistic. however. The Chinese history
professor called his optimism "cau
tious" in an email toThe

Daily, and added
that he was dis
appointed that total

shelf space would be
reduced and that the
administration was
considering moving
any of the EAL collec
tion off-campus.

Herkovic acknowledged that the
presence of an East Asia reading
room would inevitably force the re
location of other library resources.
"An East Asia reading room with
books will naturally displace a whole
number of books already here, per
haps other spaces like dissertation
graduate student or faculty carrels,"
he said. "There will be pain and suf
fering whatever happens."
The questions surrounding the
EAL also raise questions about the
digitization of works — and the will
ingness of humanities as a general
area of study to embrace the trend.
Mullaney called the new engi
neering library's three-phase digiti
zation project — in which books will
be moved to storage only after they
are digitized — "a very logical solu
tion." But he said in the case of the
EAL. there has been a rush job in the
digitization effort.
Other professors in East Asia
echoed Mullaney's qualified support
of digitization in general.
"We are not against digitization,"
Sommer said."We see wonderful po
tential in digitization. We want to be
helped, not hurt by it."
Herkovic acknowledged that
EAL materials are difficult to digi
tize due to the languages' use of non-
Roman characters.
"We're completing a $1 million
project to make Chinese and Japan
ese collections [available] on
Socrates," he said. "We also have an
$800,000 grant from the Mellon
Foundation for that purpose. Chi
nese, Japanese. Korean character
sets — certainly that will have hap-

pened before Meyer Li
brary goes away. The
timing is reasonably

good in that re
gard."
But as of

now, the problems with digitization
go beyond the difficulty in recogniz
ing Chinese, Japanese and Korean
characters. EAL Head Librarian
Dongfang Shao expressed concern
for "multivolume big sets," which in
clude as many as 3.0(H) separate titles
under a single search entry.
If more detailed information is
not placed online before such items
are moved to Livermore, Shao fears
that finding exact matches will be im
possible.
Shao also mentioned that the
EAL is like a second home to the
nearly 1,500 students who hail from
China, Korea, Taiwan. Japan. Singa
pore or Hong Kong.
"On Thanksgiving Day, they
came here," he said, adding that stu
dents read the newspaper in their na
tive tongues in the EAL. reading
room.
"If nothing else, this is a multidi
mensional problem." Hinton said." It
is about more than one building, one
collection. It is about the future of
scholarship. It is not only a short
term challenge, but also a long-term
opportunity."
