# Fate of East Asia collection unknown
## University and Library administrators engage students at town hall meeting 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM DESK EDITOR 
The impending demolition of Meyer Library has for
months raised concerns regarding the future of Stan
ford's East Asia Library (EAL). At a town hall meeting
last night in Kresge Auditorium, library and University
administrators discussed the future of the 540.000-item
Hast Asia collection with faculty and students. The en

in the stacks below Meyer Library and at the two on

Faculty who work with EAL materials fear that
their research — and Stanford's ability to attract top
graduate students and faculty in the field — will be
hurt if their books are moved to SAL 3.
But library officials say that the future of Meyer, and
of the East Asia collection, is out of their hands.
"We're losing a whole building and its subterranean

storage, we're running out of storage anyways, and
we're growing." said Andrew I lerkovic. director of
communications and development of libraries. "We're
between a rock and a hard place."

Michael Keller said the University's libraries are cur

volumes each year.
Meyer's demolition is in part due to the stipulations
put forth in Stanford's General Use Permit (GUP),
which regulates the agreement of land use between the
University and Santa Clara County.

When Meyer Library is torn down, administrators will be forced to relocate the East Asia Library, whose collections are currently located in the stacks below the venerable building.
