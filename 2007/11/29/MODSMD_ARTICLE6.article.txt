## Come together Student groups find massive mailing lists don't equal helping hands, use other tools to build community 
### NATHANIEL EISEN

Many student groups on campus say il docs mem
bership size, that is - though having a large membership
is not wholly positive.
Some, despite boasting massive email have issues
bringing more than 15 people to meetings. I arge member
ship rolls give groups greater ability to crcate change, but
some have had to employ specific techniques to create a
tighter, more personal community.
Intervarsity Christian 112 ellowship, for example, draws
95 to 1 (K) people to worship to sing hymns.
"The hardest part about having a lot of people is it's
harder to get to know people on an
individual level," says Intervarsity
President Mindy Schrag TO.
To better build community and to
provide a space for spiritual explo
ration. Intervarsity also organizes
more intimate, 10- to 20-person Bible
studies by dorm.
Leaders of Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),an um
brella group for the Chicano/Chicana
community, described the difficulties
arising from their own members'
awareness of their size.
"People see us as being so 'large
and influential' that they don't need to
get involved," said co-Chair Bernard
Fraga'OS.
But,he says, there is only a small ac
tive membership.
"Ten to 15 people at meetings is not
enough to do what we want to," he
said.
As leaders of an umbrella organiza
tion. Fraga and his co-Chair Martha
Alvarez '08 noted that groups that
MEChA supports focus on varying
topics like tutoring and healthcare,
making it imperative to find issues that
can bring everyone together.
For other organizations, like the
English as a Second Language (ESI.)
tutoring group Mabla. the main chal
lenge of bringing everyone together is
simply to figure out how to be in the
same place.at the same time,with food.
At the first tutor-training session,
for example,the conference room in El
Ccntro Chicano overflowed with SO
students, with some crowding behind
the speakers.
At the same time, because Mabla
tries to cater to each worker's learning
goals, and has no set curriculum for tu

tors to follow, leaders help out more
than they organize and direct. The
seven group leaders serve as on-site
coordinators to informally check in on
the 40 to 50 student-worker pairs, said
coordinator Mariana Gonzalez'o9.
Regardless of the challenges, group
leaders and members still say they're
glad to have large numbers of people
involved.
Emily Kinney '09 notes the impor
tance of the uplifting communal
prayer experience provided by Inter
varsity's large group worship.
"If the song is about difficulties, if
everyone's singing," she said,"there's a
sense that everyone has needed and
still needs God's help."
At the same time. Kinney feels that
small groups provide a space for per
sonal exploration.
"(The| discussion is useful to think
through your own feelings," she said.
"There's no shame in saying I don't
get what's going on,' or This hits my
ear in this way.'"
MEChA leaders note that their

200-person email list

is a benefit

when it

comes to its advocacy work. Fraga esti
mated that bO to (SO people show up to
larger rallies, making them highly visi
ble events. For example, two years ago.
30 MHChA members lay on the
ground at the Intersection of Death to
protest immigration policy. Six years
ago, 50 protested police brutality.
At I labia. Gonzalez says that the
number of students volunteering en
sures enough diversity to find good
matches of students and workers. It
also allows them to tutor people out
side of the Stanford community, most
ly friends of custodial workers.
In the end. it is when organizations
can overcome the issues that size
brings that they can make a difference.
"One year before, I don't feel sure
in the store, for I don't speak Fnglish,"
said janitor and Habla tutee Silvia
Diaz. "Now I can speak more... I want
to continue with the same support,
[until] I able to speak Fnglish with
every people and I don't want to need
a translator."
