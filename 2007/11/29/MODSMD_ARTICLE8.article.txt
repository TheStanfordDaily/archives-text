## A 						LIFE ON THE AIR 
### LAURA RUMPF 
jf ark C. Lawrence has
i/I served as Chief Execu
tive of KZSU 90.1 FM
" Radio off and on at Stan
ford since his senior year, in 1%7.
Lawrence's "day job" until his 2004
retirement was on Stanford's IT de
partment hut he's continued as one
of the key figures behind the techni
cal operations at the campus station.
A man of rare devotion to radio,
Lawrence sat down with The Daily
to describe exactly what he does for
KZSU and why radio broadcasting
makes him tick.
The Stanford Daily: What exactly
does being a radio station engineer
entail?
Lawrence: First, it entails in
stalling (or supervising installation
of) and maintaining the actual broad
cast equipment — studio consoles,
audio processing equipment,
studio/transmitter link, transmitter,
antenna, etc. Unfortunately today's
FE students aren't much interested
in radio — they're designing comput
er chips, or operating systems — so
the engineering staff has shrunk over
the years.
Beyond the broadcast equipment
my job also entails being the facilities
manager for our studios and trans
mitter building, all of which we built
ourselves over the years. We also in
stalled our own network of under
ground cables to connect remote
broadcast sites such as the stadium,
and to connect the studio to the trans
mitter building in the foothills.That's
a two-mile cable run. So I'm in charge
of fixing everything except the stuff
that Stanford Facilities takes care of.
TSD: What first provoked you to
get involved with radio?
Lawrence: I was building radios
and such when I was 10, and got my
amateur radio license when 1 was in
6th grade. My mother claimed that I
rewired a pair of table lamps when I
was 5; I don't honestly remember... In
high school 1 was building my own
amateur radio transmitters.
So. naturally, when I got here in
1963 1 promptly got involved with the
two radio organizations on campus
KZSU and the ham club. Stanford
Amateur Radio Club. By then I had
discovered that I actually enjoyed
building the equipment more than 1
did operating it, so KZSU was a bet
ter fit: lots of people wanted to oper
ate the equipment, and only a few
wanted to help build it. I was soon de
voting my "radio" energy to KZSU
and let my amateur radio license and
club membership lapse.
TSD: Do you get any say in what
programs KZSU puts on?
Lawrence: Almost none — that's
the Program Director's job. I do get
to throw my two cents worth in, and I
can occasionally get a bit pushy, but
mostly my pushing is in the direction
of more public affairs type program

ming and live coverage of Stanford
events. I don't — and shouldn't
have much influence in the type of
music played. I'm way too old to pick
the music at a college radio station!
TSI): What is your favorite mem
ory from all your time working at
KZSU?
Lawrence: Broadcasting the Grate
ful Dead, live from Frost Amphithe
ater. for two solid days in 1 1 )8<S, and
having their sound man tell me our
broadcast sounded great! I think that
was the last show they ever did in Frost.
TSI): What music/programming
have you personally been most excit
ed to hear on KZSU?
Lawrence: In addition to the Grate
ful Dead. I'd have to say carrying Gor
bachev live from MemAud [in] IWO
was pretty exciting.They were so para
noid about security that they wouldn't
let us operate from our own studios in
the MemAud basement so we wired it
up and than ran our broadcast from
the transmitter building.
Recently we've been running a
show called "What Would Your
Mother Say?" [on] Thursdays [at] 5
p.m. where the students on the panel

talk to the mothers on the panel
about things they wouldn't talk to
their own mothers about. It makes
for some lively discussions.
TSD: Any exciting plans for
KZSU in the near future?
Lawrence: We're actively improv
ing our capabilities for emergency
coverage. We've long been an emer
gency resource for Stanford and Palo
Alto, and we have very reliable emer
gency power sources at both studio
and transmitter. We're now focusing
on improving the coordination with
Stanford and Palo Alto authorities so
we can get better information to our
listeners during emergencies such as
the two recent fires in the foothills.
"Improving coordination" doesn't
sound exciting, but it means getting
good information to our listeners
when they are in an exciting situation,
like an earthquake or fire.
As a note of caution, he added:
"Be sure your emergency kit includes
a battery-powered FM radio." And a
plug:"Tune it to 90.1."
