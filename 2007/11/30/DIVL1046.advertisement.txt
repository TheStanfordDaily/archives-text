Dear Members and Friends of the Stanford and Berkeley Communities:
On December 1, 2007, Cal and Stanford will square off in the 110 th annual Big
Game at Memorial Stadium, an event that has been a Bay Area tradition. Our two
universities share a strong football and academic heritage, as well as a spirited and storied
rivalry.
It is important that the traditional goal of the big Game be reinforced this year: a
spirited competition on the field and an enjoyable experience for those in the stands.
Unfortunately, in past years, the spirit of the Big Game has been dampened by the
irresponsible behavior of some that resulted in fracas and property damage.
Wc again ask this year that you refrain from engaging in "pranks" and other
activities that may draw law enforcement and security personnel and resources away
from responding to more pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big Game should not have to fear for their safety;
therefore, we must emphasize that fans who engage in incidents of field trespass, physical
assault and/or property damage will be ejected from the stadium. Students found
responsible for these types of activities will face disciplinary action at their respective
institutions; such action may include suspension or dismissal.
Please respect more than a century of Big Game tradition and celebrate your
school spirit, pride and sportsmanship in a safe, positive and friendly manner. Enjoy the
game!
Yours sincerely,
John L. Hennessy Robert J. Birgcneau
