### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
A red and white glow emanated from the Old Union
Courtyard last night — not for the ongoing Big Game
Week celebrations, but for another, more serious cause:
Aids Awareness Week 2007.
L.it candles in red paper bags lined the courtyard side
walks as participants at last night's FACE AIDS Com
memoration Vigil named those in Africa who have re
ceived treatment thanks to fundraising efforts. But along
side the red lights for those fighting the disease were ones
in white, remembering the many more who did not receive
treatment and have passed away.
World Aids Day 2007 Coordinator Enumale Agada' 10
described the vigil as a realization of the issues, and specif
ically people, at the heart of the many Aids Awareness
Week activities this year.
I .ast night's commemoration attracted a crowd of over
50 students and featured performances by the Spoken
Word Collective, kuumba and Talisman.
In addition, two speakers addressed the crowd of stu
dents concerned with the worldwide AIDS epidemic.
Bringing it closer to home, however, was academic tech
nology stall member Joseph Kautz.Ten years after finding
out he was HIV-positive, Kautz publicly acknowledged
his personal battle for the first time last night. Describing
the 10-year period as one in which he had yellow caution
tape wrapped around him. Kautz said he no longer want
ed to be a victim of the disease.
"It was amazing to have him come speak and share
something so personal,especially since it was his first time
publicly acknowledging it," Agada said, commending
Kautz's courage in speaking. "I know I at least got really
emotional about it. hearing his experience."
Kautz was joined by Kimeli Naiyomah.a master's stu
dent in Biology. Naiyomah left his home in Kenya,having

known a woman there who lived with
AIDS. When she died of the disease,
Naiyomah adopted her four children.
At last night's vigil, Naiyomah related
the experience, showing how the dis
ease hits home for many in Africa, the
U.S. and other parts of the world.
Agada said this very point was
much of the focus for this week's Aids
Awareness events, whieh included
tabling each day in White Plaza and

an academic forum on Tuesday night.
I"he vigil in particular, especially be
cause of its speakers, brought the
AIDS cause closer to students on the
Stanford campus.
"Often we focus on HIV/A IDS as
something so far away in Africa,"
Agada said. "To have someone here
at Stanford like Joseph Kautz come
forward is a big deal. It brought peo
ple closer to the subject and put a face
on the disease when he spoke."
Aids Awareness Week continues
today with tabling again in White
Plaza as various student cultural or
ganizations represent "AIDS Around
the World."This evening at 6 p.m., the

Stanford African Students Associa
tion will have a "Unity in Brokenness:
Breaking the harsh cycle between
hunger and HIV/AIDS" refugee din
ner at Bechtel International Center.
No official events are planned for
tomorrow, World AIDS Day itself, be
cause of Big Game. I lowever, Sunday
will wrap up the week with a com
memoration concert in Memorial
Church, beginning at 1:30 p.m. There
will also be a 6:30 p.m. remembrance
service hosted by the Office for Reli
gious Life at The CIRCLE in Old
Union.
At the conclusion of this week
end's events, Agada hopes that stu

dents will take away a better under
standing of the AIDS issue and its im
pact on people all around the world
— even right next to them.
"It's a lot closer than we think, and
it's something that people are dealing
with every day," she said. "The person
next to you from an African country,
or anywhere for that matter, may
have a mother, aunt or unele, brother
or sister, etc. living with AIDS. It's a
big problem that's not isolated or dis
tant. Recognizing that is part of just
being a person."
