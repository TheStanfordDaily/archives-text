### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
Tonight, as the Stanford Football team prepares for the
higgest game of the season — its annual Big Game against
Cal — the ASSU and Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) are co
sponsoring what is being called "the biggest party of the
year."
Big Party, also called Big Game Row Block Party, will be
housed at four houses on the lower Row: Columbae, Mars,
Sigma Nu and Casa Italiana;it will last from 10p.m. to 1 a.m.
All students are welcome to come, but each attendee must
present a valid SUID to enter the party.
"The main idea is to add one more thing to Big Game
Week to get everyone excited for the game," said Aaron
Smith 'ON. \\!x>

Game Week Com
mittee. "We figured
that no one is really
having a party
[tonight], so we
should have one. It
will harbor one last
cheer to 'Beat Cal,'
and then everyone
can go to the game
the next day."
While three of
the four participat

tonight's Big Party
are not fraternities,

Alpha will host at
Casa Italiana and

[tonight]. If this
goes really well,

every year.

Columbac, respectively, while the IFC will host the party at
Mars. Sigma Nu members are hosting at their own house.
Columbae will host two hands —Pacha Ma! and Pluto
Gang — and each of the remaining three houses will feature
a live DJ. Individual houses are providing drinks, but only
partygoers issued a specially colored wristband — indicating
that they are over 21 years of age — will receive alcohol.
With valid identification, students can obtain both general
wristbands for entry and the specially colored wristbands for
alcohol at the central SUID station.
The ASSU Executives will be providing security for the
party, which includes 23 uniformed, unarmed personnel
hired from a private security company. Four guards will be
placed in each of the four participating houses, and the re
maining seven guards will be stationed both on the street and
at the central SUID station. I louse guards will ensure that no
alcohol leaves house premises and that partygoers do not ac
cess the upper floors. According to Smith, planning
for tonight's party began as early as the start of the school
year. Kyle Ladewig '08, president of the IFC.said that both he
and Smith have put many hours into organizing the event
since then.
" I would say that each of us has spent at least 30 to 40 hours
of our personal time planning this event." Ladewig said.
Ladewig and Smith said that a
"prototype" Big Party was held be
fore the 2005 Big Game, but only
Mars and Sigma Chi were involved.
The two planners intend to begin a
tradition with tonight's party.
"A lot is riding on |tonight)."
Smith said, if it goes really well, this
will happen every year."
"This is definitely something that
the IFC is looking to do for years to
come," Ladewig added. "We would
hope that next year it would just get
bigger, maybe including Bob,
Xanadu and more sponsors."
Big Party will begin tonight at 10
p.m. on the Row. Ladewig, who said
he is concerned that students will not
bring their SUIDs, stressed that any
one without Stanford identification
will be denied entry.
