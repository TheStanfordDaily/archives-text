## Returning students face housing crunch Over 50 not assigned for winter 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Studying abroad is often one of
the most memorable times in a stu
dent's college experience, but coming
back to campus can be a difficult ad
justment. especially if returning stu
dents find themselves drawn into un
desirable housing or, even worse,
without an assignment.
Last year. Jackie Weiss *08 studied
in Australia fall quarter and came
home to find herself assigned to
Crothers. which is traditionally home
to graduate students.
"After coming back from being
abroad in a very social environment,
being assigned to graduate student
housing made the transition back to
school very lonely." Weiss said.
"Crothers is very quiet; it seemed like
a hotel."
Weiss, however, was one of the
lucky ones; some students returning
from studying abroad fall quarter
have trouble getting a housing assign

ment at all

"There are approximately 50-60
guaranteed undergraduates who
were not assigned on the wait list and
are still seeking housing [for this win
ter]." said Director of Housing As
signments Sue Nunan in an email to
The Daily.
Housing assignments were tight
this fall due to the large number of in
coming freshmen in the Class of 2011.
In winter quarter, however, accom
modations will be even tighter as stu
dents return from abroad.
"There is always an increase in de
mand for housing during winter quar
ter." said Executive Director of Stu
dent Housing Rodger Whitney. "This
is due to the fact that fewer under
graduate students go overseas during
winter quarter."
Surprisingly, however, the hous
ing crunch this winter is not worse
than last year because fewer students
applied for winter quarter housing
this year. Nunan cited the new over
seas program in Madrid opening
next quarter as a potential explana
tion.
Future plans to alleviate the hous
ing crunch include construction of a
large residential complex on East
Campus, a green dorm on the Row
and increased all-freshman housing
within Florence Moore, Stern and
Wilbur Halls.
When asked what students with
unassigned winter quarter housing
should do, Whitney suggested partic
ipating in a walk-in meeting. At such
meetings, students can assume
spaces that become available after
other students refuse their assign
ments, take leaves of absence or
leave Stanford for various reasons.
"There will be two walk-in rounds
before the start of winter quarter on
Dec. 12 and Jan. 3," Whitney said.
"Daily meetings will begin on Jan. 7

and will continue throughout the
first five weeks of the quarter."
However, some assigned students
are not happy with this news. Emily
Gorbaty '09, who could not get hous
ing despite an unpreferred number
of 2011 in last year's draw, mentioned
the inconvenience of the walk-in
dates.
"The walk-in meeting times are
not convenient," Gorbaty said." 1 as
sume most people who need hous
ing are unable to attend these meet
ings and potential proxies are busy
with finals (or no one is on campus
at all)."
Unassigned students who are
seeking housing can also contact the
Community Housing Office, which
help students find rooms or apart
ments in the area.
Whitney emphasized, however,
that "all students who are guaran
teed will receive a housing assign
ment for Winter Quarter." Where
they will live, on the other hand, is yet
to be determined.
