## Farm-made apps popular Facebook class successful With trendy applications

Computer Science (CS) 377W: "Create
Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics
and I .earning on Facebook" meets once per
week for three hours and requires students
to build two Facebook applications in three
person teams. The results have surprised
even the professors; students have churned
out a number of highly successful applica
tions — two of which. "Kiss Me"and "Send
Hotness." have more than one million total
users and are still growing.
"In just about a month since the launch
of our application wc have i>rown to much-


ly 3.5 million total users, with 400.000
users interacting with the application
each day," said Alex Onsager "09, one
of the developers of the Send Hot
ness application. "Based on this met
ric, we are currently ranked among
the top 20 applications on Facebook "
Dave McClure, a lecturer in the
CS Department, teaches the class
with B.J. Fogg '95, director of the Per
suasive Technology Lab. McClure ex
plained the advantages of studying
Facebook on his online blog.
"It's only a short-term experiment
in Internet marketing on social net
works," he wrote. "I can't think of any
other platform/environment, except
perhaps YouTUbe, where you can ac
quire one million users in less than 30
days."
The Send Hotness application al
lows users to vote for their 10 hottest
Facebook friends, while the KissMe
application allows users to send oth
ers a virtual kiss. Unlike many other
Facebook applications, both Send
Hotness and KissMe employ meth
ods to encourage other users to add
the application, such as allowing
friends to affect rankings.
Onsager and Send Hotness team
member Joachim De Lombaert '09

explained how the course aimed to
understand the users' needs and psy
chology and did not solely focus on
the programming and technical as
pects of the production of applica
tions.
"We spent a good deal of time
talking about metrics in class: what
determines 'success'?" De Lombaert
explained. "In the case of Send Hot
ness, we decided to measure its suc
cess primarily on a calculation of the
'viral factor,' which relates directly to
the rate at which the application
grows."
This focus on the viral aspects and
growth rates helped explain the suc
cess of course-produced applications.
"Despite the overwhelming vol
ume of applications on Facebook that
aim to do similar things, we were able
to apply the principles we learned in
class to rise as one of the best imple
mentations of this simple idea," On
sager said.
Chris Mocko '08, one of the devel
opers for KissMe, added that even
though his application started as a
way to kiss people at Full Moon on
the Quad, the majority of users are
not from California, or even the Unit
ed States. The U.S. is only the fourth
largest country in terms of page visits
to the application, behind the U.K.,
Canada and TUrkey, and is likely to
soon be replaced by Hong Kong.
Mocko also explained the signifi
cance of the psychology behind the
application design.
"The name KissMe is simple but
memorable, descriptive and provoca
tive and the application itself is basic
but intuitive to use," he said "Too
many applications out there have
lengthy instructions that bore and
confuse the user and too many ac
tions that force the user to think and

choose."
Fogg, a consulting faculty member
in the CS department, mentioned on
his hlog that he would like to measure
the success of the class by the least
popular application produced — if it
was created by students who were en
gaged in the class and actively trying
to apply the things they were learning
during lecture. According to Mc-
Clure, as it stands, approximately 10
applications built by the class have
achieved over 10,000 installs and be
tween one and 10XXX) active users in
under a month.
Even though both Send Hotness
and KissMe are currently making a
profit from advertisement banners,
the bulk of the money earned is used
to pay for server costs.
"In order to turn KissMe and fu
ture applications into a business, we
are going to have to better optimize
our payout for these advertisements
by seeking out sponsorships from
companies related to KissMe's
theme, such as toothpaste companies
and match-making sites," Mocko
said.
While some may have originally
criticized the course as a waste of stu
dents' time, those enrolled in the class
argue that critics were not looking at
the bigger picture.
"This course has taught me nearly
every skill required to found a start
up company," Mocko said, "from
working with and managing a team of
engineers, to developing a monetiza
tion plan and negotiating with adver
tisers to maximize profits and even in
teracting with venture capitalists to
pitch ideas for funding and obtain
valuable advice."
