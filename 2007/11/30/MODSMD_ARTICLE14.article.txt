## Animated program looks to educate world on AIDS 
### LEAH KARLINS 
Alarmed by the laek of HIV/AIDS awareness
information available toyoung adults in India.sec
ond-year education graduate student Piya Sorcar
M.A.'()ft has developed an animated curriculum
that teaches HIV prevention to students while
avoiding the stigma associated with discussions of
sexual practices.
The project is "a springboard, a way to start
talking about AIDS and get the basics," said Sor

car, who began (lie initiative after reading about
India's potential as the next "hot /.one" for the
AIDS epidemic and the lack of 111V education in
the country's population.
"What's groundbreaking is that she's shown
that we can inform people about AIDS while re
specting the culture." said Communications Prof.
("lilford Nass. an advisor to Sorcar's Ph.D. project.
" Ihat's an enormous accomplishment."
Ihe stigma associated with AIDS prevents
open discussion of the disease in India. Young

adults are one of the most rapidly growing HlV
positive populations in the country, but several
states have banned sex education in schools, re
stricting the availability of HIV/A IDS prevention
information to this vulnerable group. Sorcar's
challenge thus became, "How do wc teach about
taboo subjects without talking about them?"
Drawing heavily on research from the Schools
of I Education and Medicine, as well as departments
of psychology and communication.
Sorcar spent two years designing a
culturally appropriate curriculum.
She talked to students who recently
arrived at Stanford from India to fig
ure out what images maximized the
comfort and effectiveness of their
learning.
The result was Interactive Teach
ing AIDS. an animation-based tutori
al featuring a friendly cartoon doctor
and patient who guide participants
through the biological aspects of
AIDS transmission. The tutorial is
available online and on a CD.
Emeritus Education Prof. Decker
Walker, an advisor to the project, be
lieves it "should make a real impact
on public health education globally."
In tests that Sorcar recently con

ducted in northern India, students
showed significant gains in learning
and retention levels after interacting
with the 20 minute tutorial, and users
overwhelmingly reported liking and
feeling comfortable with the inter
lace.
Nass described the results as "ab
solutely striking."
"ITie fact that she could change
the kids' attitudes, beliefs and behav
iors so much without mentioning
things that are taboo is just remark
able." he said.
Ibe number of students who un
derstood that AIDS could not be
spread through coughing increased
from 65 to 94 percent after using the
tutorial, and the percentage of stu
dents who knew that there is no cure
for AIDS increased from 55 to 93 per
cent.
In addition, there are indications
that the curriculum may have a ripple
effect. One month after being ex
posed to the tutorial, nearly 90 per

cent of students reported sharing in
formation they had learned from the
tutorial with others. Sorcar hopes to
harness this interest from young
adults, who she called "the leaders of
tomorrow."
"I think we need to give young
people some sort of tool they can get
excited about and share with other
people," she said, "so they feel like
part of the initiative."
Sorcar initially conceived the proj
ect in 2(X)5 while working on her mas
ter's thesis for Stanford's Learning
Design & Technology program. She
learned that despite India's rapidly
rising HIV-positive population and
the hundreds of millions of dollars
being poured into prevention efforts,
the majority of Indians lacked basic
knowledge about the disease.
When Sorcar surveyed students in
India and learned that they believed
HIV could be transmitted through
coughing, kissing and contaminated
water, she decided. "We can do bet

ter."
The curriculum currently has two
versions, one for India and one for
other Asian countries. In the works
are versions for countries in Africa
and Latin America, as well as China,
in addition to versions in Hindi and
other Indian languages.
Plans to disseminate the curricu
lum free of charge to schools. NGOs.
government organizations and indi
viduals are underway.
Sorcar hopes to create similar ap
plications for Facebook and Orkut —
a social networking Web site popular
in India — and to make her curricu
lum available from mobile phones.
"I still feel like this is just the be
ginning." she said.
