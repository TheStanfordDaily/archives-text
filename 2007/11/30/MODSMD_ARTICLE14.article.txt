information available toyoung adults in India.sec
ond-year education graduate student Piya Sorcar
M.A.'()ft has developed an animated curriculum
that teaches HIV prevention to students while
avoiding the stigma associated with discussions of
sexual practices.
The project is "a springboard, a way to start
talking about AIDS and get the basics," said Sor

car, who began (lie initiative after reading about
India's potential as the next "hot /.one" for the
AIDS epidemic and the lack of 111V education in
the country's population.
"What's groundbreaking is that she's shown
that we can inform people about AIDS while re
specting the culture." said Communications Prof.
("lilford Nass. an advisor to Sorcar's Ph.D. project.
" Ihat's an enormous accomplishment."
Ihe stigma associated with AIDS prevents
open discussion of the disease in India. Young

adults are one of the most rapidly growing HlV
positive populations in the country, but several
states have banned sex education in schools, re
stricting the availability of HIV/A IDS prevention
information to this vulnerable group. Sorcar's
challenge thus became, "How do wc teach about
taboo subjects without talking about them?"
Drawing heavily on research from the Schools
of I Education and Medicine, as well as departments
