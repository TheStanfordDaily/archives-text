## Editorial Board Amends and amendments 
### 
Stanford's Faculty Senate approved two
proposed amendments to the Judicial
Charter earlier this month. One of
these amendments would "extend off-cam
pus jurisdiction to offenses that 'threaten
the safety and integrity' of the Stanford
community." according to an article pub
lished in the Stanford Report. This change,
effective immediately upon President 1 len
nessy's approval, addresses the disparity be
tween the consequences of committing
crimes within and beyond campus bound
aries. Several administrators believe that
eliminating this disparity corrodes the
weight of Stanford's Fundamental Standard
by creating double standards for the types
of behavior acceptable on and off campus.
Should it come into effect, the implications
of this amendment may be more symbolic
than material, but they nonetheless deserve
student attention.
The proposal to extend off-campus juris
diction to offenses committed within the
Stanford community highlights the dual na
ture of the existing system. Currently, some
crimes committed on campus are dealt with
as internal affairs. Students may have hear
ings before committees composed of facul
ty members, administrators and their peers.
Sentences that are within the University's
capacity to enforce are doled out as penal
ties. Expulsion could be a consequence but
a jail sentence is usually out of the question.
The system is somewhat codified and bu
reaucratic. but it retains the flexibility of a
university's internal judicial process.'The ex
istence of that judicial structure holds a
promise as comforting and welcoming as a
drive down Palm Drive â€” it is a promise of
Privilege. Invulnerability and I ntitlement.
It suggests that as Stanford students, we may
have our pie and eat it. too.
The proposed amendment marks a sig
nificant divergence from the handling of ju
risdictional issues to date as it highlights and
challenges at last the grand tradition of col
legial privilege. From a disciplinarian's
standpoint, the reasoning behind it is (law
less: A crime is a crime no matter where it is

committed and crimes that are serious
enough to "threaten the safety and integri
ty" of the campus community should be met
with the full force of the law. However, a
sterner message lurks behind the cool logic
of maintaining the Fundamental Standard.
The administration is sending a clear mes
sage that students must grow up and face
real world consequences. ITiis amendment
demands a student body that is less enam
ored with its invincibility and more vulnera
ble to legal discipline.
The capacity to take consequences for
one's actions signals maturity and perhaps
that the administration is taking a step in
the right direction by encouraging greater
responsibility. Nevertheless, there are knot
ty questions to be answered. After a long
history of maintaining independent juris
diction over internal matters, why does the
Faculty Senate choose this moment to
change disciplinary policies? Who will de
cide which crimes "'threaten the safety and
integrity' of the Stanford community," and
will those demarcations be enforced with
consistency? Does this amendment mark
the beginning of a slippery slope whereby
the University will defer to the policies of
government entities in other areas where it
currently exercises jurisdiction? Imagine
the uproar if administrators decided to ex
tend local minimum wage laws to campus.
While this example hardly parallels issues
of law enforcement and security, the point
cannot be overlooked.
As Stanford students, we should not see
ourselves as so exceptional that we may es
cape the consequences of our mistakes. We,
too. are citizens in a world that is greater
than our immediate sphere, and learning
about this greater world, after all. is the ob
jective of higher learning. On the other
hand, we must see Stanford for what it truly
is and recognize that the school could be
damaged by a staid, tightened environment.
We should never wholly abandon those ele
ments of our independence, idealism and
flexibility that allow us to be unique yet
grounded, productive yet humble.
