# Burning Down the House
## Sometimes a great notion 
### 
If there's one thing 1 know about Ameri
can politics, it's that Michael Dukakis
destroyed everything he touched. While
his ineptitude during the 1988 presidential
campaign allowed the founding of the dy
nasty of Bush presidencies, and thus contin
ues to haunt us. he did lasting damage to
our democracy in another way as well.
When he accepted the Democratic pres
idential nomination at the convention in
Atlanta. Dukakis famously declared, "This
election isn't about ideology. It's about
competence."
I have an unsettling idea. What if, for
decades now, we've been thinking about
presidential campaigns all wrong? We like
to refract our presidential campaigns
through the lens of competence: Clinton
has it. Obama doesn't. Romney has it. Giu
liani doesn't, Gore had it. Bush didn't, etc.
So let's pause for a moment and ask a
simple question. What is competence?
Quite literally, what is the definition of that
term, as we apply it to presidents? It's a lot
slipperier than it seems.
ITiere's an immediate urge to point to
the catastrophes of the last seven years as
the obvious price of incompetence. We
(sort of) chose an incompetent candidate,
the argument goes, and we got predictable
results: A disastrously managed war. a ru
ined national reputation, a struggling econ
omy and the population of a major Ameri
can city surrendered to a hurricane.
The hard truth, though, is that there is a
factor besides incompetence that can ulti
mately explain all of these calamities. It has
been a matter of ideological choice, not ef
fective management, that has dictated
whether efforts of the federal government
will succeed or fail. The Bush administra
tion did not make a genuine or organized
effort to save New Orleans. The city was
quite literally abandoned to its fate: the de
cision was made years before the hurricane
struck, when FEMA was purposefully gut
ted by officials who dismissed the value of
any bureaucratic agency. Michael Brown
was indeed incompetent, but it's no acci
dent that agencies like FEMA are stocked
with cronies like Brown. Bush and Cheney
were surely under no illusion that the for
mer lawyer for the International Arabian
Horse Association (he resigned in disgrace
from that job too) was qualified to handle

one of the most difficult logistical tasks in
federal government.
Likewise, the morass in Iraq is not the
result of a good idea badly implemented.
Rather, we got where we are today because
of national leadership that adheres to a par
ticular ideological worldview, consisting of
an unwavering belief in the moral Tightness
of projected American power.The adminis
tration. blinded by ideology, was unable to
recognize that not everybody shared their
views of American power, that we would
not. in fact, be welcomed with hugs and
roses. Hence the problem in Iraq wasn't
that they came up with a great idea and pro
ceeded to handle it badly; it was that they
came up with a terrible idea that they were
convinced was great. No amount of compe
tence can compensate for deluded ideolo
gy
Nor is Bush the only president whose
failures are attributable to his ideology
rather than his abilities.The basic ideologi
cal premise of the Clinton presidency, after
all, was that he was a Democrat who was a
little bit less of a Democrat than others.
Clinton campaigned for reelection in
on the promise to be inoffensive. His basic
strategy, termed "triangulation," consisted
of the argument that he had none of the bad
qualities of cither party. It's hardly surpris
ing. then, that while we can remember the
( >(k as boom years, it's hard to point out
many lasting Clinton accomplishments.
TTiere's always a lot of talk about "doing
the job" and "getting it done" in the presi
dential campaign. ITiis begs the question.
"What job. precisely, will you do? What.ex
actly, will you get done?" Running the
country is not like running a corporation or
even like running F r EMA. While a CEO
has only one official job — increasing the
value of his or her corporation — presi
dents create their own missions and re-
