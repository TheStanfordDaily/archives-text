# Oddities and Katie-o-Syncrasies
## We're our own worst judges 
### 
I've started to see, as of late, that I am bad at
seeing myself. My poor self-perceptions
span all sorts of things — most things, actu
ally. 1 thought that essay was well-written. I
supposed my painting's colors were coherent.
I swear I was flirting like crazy. And then you
get a B-, a rough art critique, and a friend who
says she couldn't tell the slightest bit that you
were into that guy
Most puzzling of all. or perhaps most dis
tressing. is that I think I am pretty perceptive.
My comments in peer reviews aren't that far
off from the professors'. I am good at analyz
ing famous works in my art history classes. I'd
like to think I get a majority of social cues. So I
am surprised, again and again, by the way peo
ple view me and the things I do. Just when 1
think I am being obviously sarcastic, someone
will ask. "Wait, really?" I am shocked when
someone tells me 1 touched my hair too much
during a presentation. Or that I should stop
shifting my weight when explaining an improv
game on stage.
Especially in relationships, I am amazed by
the misinterpretations — or lack of any inter
pretation at all — of things I felt were perfect
ly, obviously, painfully clear. Didn't he know

how excited I was to see him? Couldn't he tell
by my tone I was upset? How could he not
have seen how happy I was to go on a second
date?
1 guess that is why relationship counseling
always stresses communication.
Studies in social psychology show that in
social interactions people think they are
being much more transparent than they actu
ally are. We assume everyone gets us.
I guess we are all just self-absorbed little
buggers, who, rather naturally, think our own
thought processes are the most logical. Isn't it
clear what I was doing on page seven when
Sally cries in the grocery store? We assume
others think like us, will respond like us —
they'll get what I'm doing because this is how
they would respond if they were in the same

situation. Why explain the apparent?
Hie paradox is,however,that we in fact are
experts at picking up others' mannerisms and
body language, so we think people will pick
up on ours. After all, I am acutely aware that
Cute-n-Cocky swaggers, Lima Bean has such
slouched shoulders and Blondie raises her
voice at the end of each sentence, even when
it's not a question. 1 can detect the slightest
tone in my mother's voice. I (generally) know
when someone is interested in me.
But here 1 am, Clueless Katie.still unable to
see myself.
1 think it is only occasionally that we view
ourselves as we would someone else. Some
times age does it — I did what as a freshman?
I 've read through pages and pages of my diary,
which belonged to a girl who I sheepishly
admit was once me.
Sometimes seeing images of ourselves
pushes us into a spiraling self-reflection.
Have you ever seen yourself on video and
been utterly astounded it was you? Even
hearing recordings of our own voice is discon
certing. We turn the same unblinking eye with


Katie
Taylor
which we view the world hack onto
ourselves, and suddenly we don't rec
ognize who's there. 1 walk like that? 1
laugh like that? 1 am that? For a flick
ering moment, we are simultaneous
ly the one under scrutiny and passing
it, the judge and the jury. We cringe,
look away It is always a hard blow
when Who We Think We Are finally
meets Who We Are.
But those acute moments of self
critique are often all too fleeting (un
less you are on a reality TV show, or
work at a gas station.) I am all too
rarely pushed to see myself from out
side my ivory tower of self-assessment.
But it is these moments, when we
are forced to confront another per
ception of ourselves, that our fragile,
oft-erroneous self-perception comes
into greater focus. It is then that we
see the sun, not just the shadows
dancing on the cave wall. Even if we
don't agree with the critiques, the
comments from friends and the sur
prise interpretations, at the very least
our awareness of their existence
broadens and informs who we are.
