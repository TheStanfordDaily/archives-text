# Stanford looks to take back the Axe
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For both squads, it has been a long time
coming. And for both Jim 1 larbaugh's
Stanford Cardinal and Jeff Tedford's
Cal Bears, it's probably a game they
wish they were playing under different
circumstances.
This year's Big Game, the 25th since "The
Play" — a crazy, lateral-filled kickoff return
for a touchdown that snatched a win for the
Bears over the John Elway-led Cardinal in
1982 — features a pair of also-rans. For both
Stanford and Cal. the 2007 incarnation of the
annual battle for The Stanford Axe comes at
the close of largely forgettable seasons.
After getting off to a terrific 5-0 start and
being ranked as high as No. 2 in the nation.

the Golden Bears have lost five of their last
six. with their lone win in that span coming by
three points at home against Washington
State. Meanwhile, the Cardinal has failed to
build any real momentum following its 24-23
upset of then-No. 2 DSC in the L. A. Colise
um. losing five of its last six. including last
week's defeat against lowly Notre Dame.
Still, the Bears, at least, are playing for
something beyond the usual bragging rights
Cal needs a win to cement their status in
the hunt for a bowl game berth. A .500 finish
might not be enough to get the Bears into a
bowl game, but 7-5 would almost certainly do
the trick.
"That makes it all the better," senior re
ceiver Mark Bradford said. "Hey. it's just
more icing tin the cake."
The cake that the Cardinal hopes to be

sampling tomorrow is their first taste of a Big
Game victory since 2001 and a rivalry win of
which no current player on the team has ever
been a part.
Bradford himself has come on strong in
recent weeks, and he credits his improved
health with his heightened offensive produc
tion.
"I think it's just a little bit of me getting
healthy at the end of the season and a little bit
of my chemistry with the quarterbacks get
ting better and just me making plays out
there." he said. "Coach is calling my number
a little hit more, and things are just working
out for me."
