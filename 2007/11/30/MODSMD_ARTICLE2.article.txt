# Stanford looks to take back the Axe
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For both squads, it has been a long time
coming. And for both Jim 1 larbaugh's
Stanford Cardinal and Jeff Tedford's
Cal Bears, it's probably a game they
wish they were playing under different
circumstances.
This year's Big Game, the 25th since "The
Play" — a crazy, lateral-filled kickoff return
for a touchdown that snatched a win for the
Bears over the John Elway-led Cardinal in
1982 — features a pair of also-rans. For both
Stanford and Cal. the 2007 incarnation of the
annual battle for The Stanford Axe comes at
the close of largely forgettable seasons.
After getting off to a terrific 5-0 start and
being ranked as high as No. 2 in the nation.

the Golden Bears have lost five of their last
six. with their lone win in that span coming by
three points at home against Washington
State. Meanwhile, the Cardinal has failed to
build any real momentum following its 24-23
upset of then-No. 2 DSC in the L. A. Colise
um. losing five of its last six. including last
week's defeat against lowly Notre Dame.
Still, the Bears, at least, are playing for
something beyond the usual bragging rights
Cal needs a win to cement their status in
the hunt for a bowl game berth. A .500 finish
might not be enough to get the Bears into a
bowl game, but 7-5 would almost certainly do
the trick.
"That makes it all the better," senior re
ceiver Mark Bradford said. "Hey. it's just
more icing tin the cake."
The cake that the Cardinal hopes to be

sampling tomorrow is their first taste of a Big
Game victory since 2001 and a rivalry win of
which no current player on the team has ever
been a part.
Bradford himself has come on strong in
recent weeks, and he credits his improved
health with his heightened offensive produc
tion.
"I think it's just a little bit of me getting
healthy at the end of the season and a little bit
of my chemistry with the quarterbacks get
ting better and just me making plays out
there." he said. "Coach is calling my number
a little hit more, and things are just working
out for me."

(6 5.3-5 Pac 10)

NOTES: The Cardinal look to break a five
game losing streak against Cal. Both teams
have lost five of their last six games. A win for
Stanford would be its first over a Pac 10
opponent in the new Stanford Stadium.
Anthony Kimble who made a big
splash in his return to action last
week with two rushing touchdowns
and 20 carries for 80 yards against the
Irish — could give Stanford a fight
er's chance against Cal. The Bears'
defense has allowed over 26 points
per game in 2007 while giving up an
average of 5.1 yards per play.
The Cardinal defense, on the
other hand, could have its hands full
trying to contain Cal running back
Justin Forsett, who has rushed for
1,373 yards and boasts a five-yards
per-carry average this season while
racking up 13 touchdowns on the
ground. Stanford is ninth in the Pac
-10 in rushing defense and has given
up an average of 174.9 yards on the
ground per game.
Harbaugh has been close
mouthed regarding his quarterback
ing situation, intimating that he will
choose a starter Saturday but that
both senior T.C. Ostrandcr and soph
omore Tavita Pritchard are likely to
see action against the Bears.
Pritchard. who has started for the
Cardinal since its Oct. 6 upset victory

at USC, was forced to leave last
weekend's game against Notre
Dame following a vicious hit to the
head as he scrambled for a 19-yard
gain in the third quarter. Ostrander
filled in admirably for his underclass
counterpart, going 5-for-9 for 50
yards against the Irish and putting a
pair of passes that were dropped into
the hands of his receivers in the end
zone to end Stanford's final drive.
For Ostrander. who entered the
year with high hopes of shining as a
starter in his senior season, tomor
row's game represents a last shot at a
moment in the sun with the Cardinal.
"Honestly,it hasn't gone anything
like 1 expected," he told the San
Francisco Chronicle. "My entire ca
reer in general hasn't gone like 1
wanted. I doubt anybody's has really.
But it's not going to be some total
wash."
Kickoff is scheduled for 4 p.m. to
morrow. and the game will be tele
vised nationally by Versus. The con
test marks Cal's first visit to the new
Stanford Stadium, and a win for the
Cardinal would be its first confer
ence victory at the new venue and
just its second overall since the stadi
um opened last year.
