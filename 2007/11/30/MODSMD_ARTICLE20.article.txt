# Nat-ural Philosophy
## The 						modern boy fragrance industry 
### 
Here lies the Irish Springs, the Doves,
the Ivories, the Dials and the Lever
2(M)()s of the world.They have given
their last shriveled hurrah, their barely use
able bits are clinging together for one final
reprise, they wait to be washed down the
shower drain of our collective conscious
ness.
From humble beginnings in ancient Egypt
as an oily bar used to cleanse woolen textiles,
the soap rose in its lifetime to a position of
global prominence. There was a time when
the bar of soap reigned supreme over a king
dom of clean, sanitized individuals. There
was a time when this solid-state rectangular
prism was synonymous with the defeat of the
germ. Ye;irs of progress in the scientific fields
were personified in the soap bar.
But the bar of soap has died. And its mur
derers are not the usual suspects. It has not
been killed by dirt or the dirty, but by crass.
It was found this morning in a pile of its own

lather, choking out bubbles in the drain of
Branner I tall. And towering above it. laugh
ing maniacally, was a bottle of body wash.

Once a liquid reserved for loofah
sponges in the bathtubs of middle aged
women, body wash has taken over, perfum
ing the armpits of male college students
everywhere. Originally intended to supple
ment the bar of soap, it has quickly taken on
a new role, replacing the bar entirely. Body
wash bottles have been clear from the out
set: This product does not offer any sanitary
benefits. Yet the liquid likely now occupies

half the volume of American colleges'
sewer systems.
The focus has shifted. You don't have to
actually be clean anymore; you just have to
he wearing enough of the right perfume.
And. in fact, no water has to touch your
body at all, what with "body sprays" and
"body lotions" propagating as they arc. A
whole array of "body" products forms the
arsenal of the faux-clean movement. The
mantra seems to go as follows: No matter
the product, the more you apply, the more
you can make up for a lack of genuine clean
liness.
Some might say you can't blame those
who have killed the soap. After all. the prod
ucts that have arisen since the death of the
soap provide additional benefits that soap
never could have. If the advertisements are
any indication, using body wash is a direct


Nat
Hillard
path toward scantily clad and at
tractive women.The ads go as far as
to say that if you use body wash in
an apartment complex, women in
the floors below you will want to
sleep with you so much that they
will pole dance on your drainage
pipes.
Soap could never be that sexy.
Soap was too practical to be sexy. In
our society, for something to be
popular, it really has to do almost
absolutely nothing. And body wash
fits the bill. It doesn't get you clean,
it leaves a scent trail as you exit the
room and it most certainly will not
attract nearly naked women.
The question becomes, how?
How did such a product manage to
outstrip and eventually assassinate
our beloved soap bar? There is one
puppet master here, and it is mar
keting. Before the advent of "Axe"
and its ilk, before the sexy, edgy
black bottles with the screwable

tops and the ribbed edges, there was
Dove, the product marketed nearly
exclusively to pregnant women, ad
vertised by a bird symbolic of peace
and harmony. Before a product that
plays on the insecurities and potent
sexual energy of a pubescent male,
there were words such as "moistur
ize" and "rejuvenate." Today's col
lege demographic could care less
about rejuvenating. Somewhere
along the way, marketing realized
that you could sell more of your
product if you catered to raging
hormones, not birthing mothers.
I conducted a miniature survey.
Out of the nine cubbies for male toi
letries in the bathroom next door to
my room,eight have body wash,and
two have soap.The soaps 1 did find,
my own and someone else's, had
been reduccd to slivers,pitiful shad
ows of their former selves.
The soap bar will be survived by
a wife, children, the washcloth and
cleansing facial tissues.
