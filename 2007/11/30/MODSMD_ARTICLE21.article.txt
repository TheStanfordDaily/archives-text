A bored Ficon 1A student zones out of lecture
and flips open her laptop. She pulls up
Freeßice.com and ponders the definition of
"effusive" while sipping her non-fat soy latte. She
clicks on "gushing" and is CORRECT! She smiles
when the rustic brown bowl on the screen fills up
with 20 grains of rice.
A 45-year old Burmese man shuttles barefoot up
to a World Food Programme food distribution point
in a dense and dirty part of Rangoon. He receives a
25 kg bag of rice to feed him and his family. A man
who once cultivated rice in fields of his own, who has
raised a family, who speaks several languages. 1 le is
thankful that his children's stomachs will be full for a
bit longer but is ashamed at his dependency on hand
outs.
ITie econ daydreamer feels great. I ler mind is ex
panding and she's feeding hungry people — just
look at that bowl filling up! The Burmese man scoops
out some rice and notices the big blue imprint on the
bag: "Gift of LISA." 1 le imagines the lands of plenty
that exist in other parts of the world. Maybe he can't

quite picture the student in her cozy hoodie and air
conditioned classroom but she's the one feeling good
about "feeding" people like him.
A recent Daily editorial ["Going with the grain."
Nov. 26] promoted and praised Freeßice.com for the
new and hugely popular opportunity it has created:
"Play and feed hungry people" as the Web site's side
bar claims. So is this concept as ingenious as addicted
Stanford students are claiming it to be? It's a ques
tion the editorial failed to raise.but one that needs at
tention. Freeßice should certainly not be touted as
"the very innovative and socially conscientious en
deavor that Stanford students have long sought."
If you're clicking away on Freeßice and monitor
ing your vocab level,glancing at the ads at the bottom
and watching those piles of rice build up, then please
consider placing your mouse elsewhere for a couple
clicks. The bottom left button "Where the Rice
Goes" will give you some more in-depth knowledge
about the donations you're making. You can learn
about where WFP delivers rice and where it buys its
rice. I found the most enlightening link to be, "Not

Just Rice" which reveals the should-be-obvious truth
that."The hungry cannot live on rice alone... WFP ra
tions include vegetable oil, pulses, cereal blends,
bread, sugar and salt." The Daily editorial's state
ment, "it takes roughly 20.(HX) grains of rice to pro
vide the necessary calories to sustain an adult for a
single day" lacks genuine awareness of the plight of
hungry people. It treats them as bodies to be fed
as if once their Grains of Rice Quota is met, the prob
lem is solved It is also evident that Freeßice does not
encourage users to gain a deeper understanding of
food aid. Even someone who did enough research
about Freeßice.com to discover "ricebots" missed
the details about food aid and its many complexities.
Complexities. 'ITiat's where the distracted I con
la student and the Burmese man become important
side-by-side portraits. A quick click on the WFP site
reveals a pie chart showing Burma as the largest re
cipient of donated rice. Another click over to the
Wikipedia article on Burma can shed light on win
