## Gumport presents grad diversity project DARE program to recruit diverse fellows 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost of Graduate Edu
cation (VPGE) Patricia Gumport
delivered a presentation about her
office's upcoming goals and initia
tives at yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
Gumport described projects
such as the Diversifying Academia,
Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
Fellows Program, an effort to in
crease diversity in graduate educa
tion.
DARE is a four-year pilot pro
gram that will select three groups of
twelve fellows each.The fellows will
be selected from diverse back
grounds based on a wide range of
factors including race and sexuality.
"We want to diversify the
pipeline," Gumport said. "With
DARE, the fellows can cultivate
their skills and their confidence."
Along with a large amount of
funding, DARE will provide the fel
lows with a mentoring network that
includes senior faculty both within
and outside the fellows' fields. The
program is unique in that the
DARE fellows will, in turn, mentor
undergraduates on careers in aca
demia and plans for graduate
school.
In addition. DARE fellows will
have the opportunity to serve a
one-year assistant professorship.
"An assistant professorship will
give them a better position for the
academic labor market," Gumport
said, noting the experience fellows
will gain in preparing lessons and
teaching.
DARE developed in response to
one of VPGE's distinct priorities
for graduate studies. Gumport said
that a focus on diversity is particu
larly important because the number
of under-represented minorities in

the graduate population has de
creased by 13 percent since 1985. In
comparison, undergraduate minori
ties have increased by 20 percent in
the same time frame.
"The enrollments [of under-rep
resented minorities] mirror the size
of the applicant pools," Gumport
said, indicating that it was impor
tant to appeal to minorities so they
apply to graduate schools at Stan
ford.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 also spoke at last night's meet
ing to report on Wednesday's town
hall discussion on the impending
demolition of Meyer Library and
the relocation of the East Asia Li
brary (EAL). Etchemendy related
that several attendees did not feel
that the proper technology would
be ready for a system of accessing
the EAL, which may be housed off
campus when Meyer is torn down.
Etchemendy said that though he
believed a proper system for recall
ing the books to campus will be in
place by the time the collection is
moved off school grounds, the ob
jection was understandable.
"We might be able to delay the
move up to a decade," Etchemendy
said, noting that Meyer is not up to
current standards for building safe
ty but is still not considered a life
safety hazard.
"This will delay as long as possi
ble the reduction of stack space on
campus," he added.
President John Hennessy also
reported that the members of a task
force to study the effects of increas
ing the size of the freshman class
have been selected. English Prof.
Ramon Saldivar and Board of
Trustees member Jim C'anales will
serve as co-chairs for the task force,
which Hennessy said will debate
concerns including the size of the
increase, financial considerations
and housing issues. Deliberations
are expected to continue into next
fall.
