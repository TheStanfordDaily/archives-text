## Airliner hides prizes around campus 
### NIKHIL JOSHI 
Laura Chau' 11 woke up early yes
terday morning with a mission: to
find free plane tickets. Hidden some
where around campus in a golden en
velope. the tickets were just one of
many prizes in an American Airlines
promotion taking place on college
campuses nationwide.
Chau returned to her dorm with
eight golden envelopes but no jubi
lant smile.
"1 wanted to visit a friend in North
Carolina," she said, "but each of the
envelopes only had $10 coupons."
To promote its new Deal Finder
software, American Airlines enlisted
campus representative Peter Fuilayson
'07 to hide 250 golden envelopes —
each containing either round-trip tick
ets or discount codes worth $50, $20 or
$ 10 — around campus.
The Deal Finder Treasure Hunt is
only one of a number of promotions
that American Airlines will be run
ning at Stanford this year.
"(American Airlines] have identi
fied college students as trend setters,"
Finlayson said. "We will become the
next generation of professionals."
At last Saturday's football game
against Notre Dame. American Air
lines sponsored a field goal contest,
and when Brad Pereira '08 made the
short kick he won two round trip tick

ets to the domestic destination of his
choice. The airline also plans to in
clude a promotion at an upcoming
basketball eame.

$10 is $10;
it's always nice.
PETER FINLAYSON,
American Airlines
campus representative

American's promotions have
given it an enhanced campus pres
ence, but events like the Treasure
Hunt may not be enough to drive stu
dents away from popular low cost
carriers, like Southwest or Jetßlue.
"All of these American promo
tions are great, but 1 will be sticking
with Jetßlue for one reason: it's
cheaper," said Yashraj Narang '11.
As for Chau and her disappoint
ment. Finlayson had some advice.
"$lO is $10; it's always nice." he
said. "Stay alert — there will be a lot
more chances to win later."
