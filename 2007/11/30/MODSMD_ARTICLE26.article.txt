## Basketball braces for Buffs Stanford travels to Boulder to take on guard-heavy Colorado 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford basketball hopes for a festive out
come in its visit to one of the nation's top party
schools, Colorado, this Sunday at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal (7-1) has enjoyed a quick
start against undermanned opponents behind
the inside-outside combination of junior
guard Anthony Goods (13 points per game)
and sophomore center Robin Lopez (12
points per game). Junior forward Lawrence
Hill (10 points per game) has come on strong
too, while Fred Washington, Landry Fields
and starting point guard Mitch Johnson have
been solid contributors,all chipping in at least
seven points a game.
The Buffaloes (5-2) three key players are
guards Richard Roby, Marcus Hall and
Xavier Silas, each of whom average double
figures on better than 40 percent shooting.
The squad's losses are both respectable — to
New Mexico and Wisconsin, and their latest
win, a 60-50 slugfest at Air Force, is downright
impressive. Just ask Stanford, who saw the
Falcons whoop them by 34 last year at Maples.
Roby, Hall and Silas, however, are all
guards who top out at 6-foot-6, so coach Trent
Johnson can force Colorado out of its comfort
zone by going big and deploying Robin Lopez
(7 feet), senior forward Taj Finger (6-foot-8),
Hill (6-foot-8), and Washington (6-foot-5) at
the five through two positions, respectively.
Stanford leads the Pac-10 at a plus-12 re
bound margin per game, and for good reason:
Hill was First-Team All Pac-10 last year,
Robin Lopez is a monster in the post and.
after an up-and-down Stanford career, Finger
has impressed in his senior season by adding
an improved offensive game to his stalwart
defense. The differential in post talent (and
size, with the tallest Colorado upperclassman
measuring in at 6-foot-9) should give Stan
ford the edge coming into Sunday's match-up.
The contest will be Stanford's last that
counts until a Dec. 19 visit from Santa Clara
(an exhibition game against the College of
Idaho will be three days earlier). Grades will
ing, sophomore center Brook Lopez will be
eligible to play against the Broncos. Even so.
expect coach Johnson to gradually work his
top big man into the starting rotation — not
because Lopez isn't in game shape, as he's
looked strong in practice, but to send a mes
sage to his team and, particularly, to his soph
omore star.
Just as in its previous eight contests (and
next four, until the start of Pac-10 play), Stan
ford is facing an overmatched opponent in

GAME NOTES: Colorado is coming off a 60-50 win over
Air Force, who beat the Cardinal by 34 points last year at
Maples Pavilion. This is the last regular season game for
Stanford before sophomore forward Brook Lopez can
become academically eligible again. Junior guard An
thony Goods leads the Cardinal in scoring at 12.8
points per game.

Colorado that, at least on paper, it should
beat.
That's obviously good news for the statis
tics and the teams record, but its effect on the
Cardinal's postseason status is decidedly
murkier. If the Cardinal keeps winning con
sistently. its weak non-conference schedule
ought to be forgiven, especially after the
three-month meat grinder that is the Pac-10
Conference schedule.
But do the math:The loss at Siena will sting
and Santa Clara and Texas Tech a week later
are no sure things. Stanford has built a reputa
tion for struggling on the road under Johnson,
and even the most wildly optimistic of fans
could see the Cardinal finishing sixth or sev
enth in the Pac-10 (the team was picked fifth
in the preseason media poll).
The bottom line is this: Not too many Stan
ford students have this game high on their
radars, with Big Game the day before and fi
nals lingering around the corner. But with a
loss, plenty of folks might be looking back
come Selection Sunday, saying "if only." As
Johnson and his squad would be the first to
tell you. there's little margin for error this
Sunday.
