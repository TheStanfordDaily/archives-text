GAME NOTES: Freshman Hannah Donaghe scored 11
points off the bench in her Cardinal debut on Wednes
day. UC-Davis beat Washington to win the Waikiki
Beach Marriot Classic last week. This is the Aggies first
year as a full member of Division 1.

MVP honors and was named Big West Confer
ence Player of the Week for her efforts, despite
not starting once.
The Aggies are in their first year as official
members of Division I — they played with a
provincial status over the past four years as
they transitioned into Division I.
UC-Davis has a formidable core group of
players to compete with. Senior forward and
starter Heather Bates, along with Harp, was
all-tournament in the Waikiki Classic. Bates
led the Aggies in both scoring and rebounding
last year.
Junior forward Haylee Donaghe — the
older sister of Cardinal freshman guard Han
nah Donaghe — and senior forward Jessica
Campbell, who tallied the I,oooth point of her
career against Portland State, are both scoring
in double figures. I lay lee Donaghe is also a de
fensive force: she and junior guard Kirsten
Commins — both starters — lead the team
with 13 steals each.
UC-Davis can credit its tough defense for
its impressive start: the team has held its oppo
nents to just over 30% shooting on the year.
The offense, though, has been lacking:
Through the first four games, they were only
hitting 42. 1 )% of their shots.
But the Aggies turned it around in the Port
land State game, shooting 58% from the floor,
lliey will need to continue that trend if they
are to compete with the Cardinal, who may be
the toughest opponent they will face all year.
The Cardinal are scoring 75 points per
game and holding opponents to 35.1% shoot
ing. Sophomore center Jayne Appel and senior
guard Candice Wiggins lead both the offensive

and defensive attacks for the Cardi
nal — Appel leads the team with
16.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per
game, while Wiggins is second in
scoring with I4. 1 ) points per game.
Appel has 20 of Stanford's 32 blocks
on the year, and Wiggins leads the
team in steals, with 14.
They are assisted by junior for
ward Jillian Harmon, an occasional
starter and an effective scorer, and a
formidable group of freshman, in
cluding starting forward Kayla Ped
ersen. Sophomore point guard Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude, who has started

every game this year after missing all
of last season with a torn ACI.. is a
steadying influence and an unselfish
floor general.
Stanford, who seemed to perfect
the last break against San Francisco,
will continue to press its up-tempo
style against UC-Davis. The Aggies,
though, are a fairly versatile team,
and they will be able to use a number
of player combinations to try and
contain the Cardinal.
Hut first they'll have to find the
right squad quickly — San Francisco
was able to keep pace with Stanford
throughout the first half on Wednes
day, but by that point, the Dons were
already in a 20-point hole.
