## Cardinal begins NCAAs Top-seeded Stanford to take on Santa Clara in first round 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The top-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team will begin its pursuit of the pro
gram's record seventh NCAA title tonight.
The Cardinal faces Santa Clara — the team
that ended its tournament two years ago —
in tonight's first round, with the winner
playing either Minnesota or Sacramento
State on Saturday.
Pac-10 champion for the second year in
a row. the Cardinal (27-2. 6-2) was named
the top seed in the tournament, despite
being ranked fourth in the last coaches'
poll.The Cardinal has played in the champi
onship match in four of the last six years,
with NCAA titles won in 2001 and 2004. If
neither team is upset. Stanford might just be
headed for a rematch of last year's four
game loss to No. 2 Nebraska when the final
match is played in Sacramento on Decem
ber 15.
Also a host for next week's Regional.
Stanford kicks off the 2(X)7 postseason at
home in tonight's second match.The Bron
cos (18-11. 10-3 West Coast Conference)
started the regular season slow, but came on
strong at the end, claiming a share of the
WCC title and earning the conference's au
tomatic bid.
Stanford has played Santa Clara 25
times — the Broncos' first win came in a
2005 match. The Cardinal played that
match without current junior outside hitter
Cynthia Barboza, however, who had torn
her ACL earlier that year. Further, senior
setter Bryn Kehoe was unable to set
as she recovered from a broken
hand.
The Broncos, on the other hand,
went on to win the Regional and
qualify for the team's first-ever Final
Four. Stanford played Santa Clara
again last year in a preseason tourna
ment, with the Cardinal earning a
sweep.
With Anna Cmaylo. a 2005 Ail-
American middle blocker, missing
the season with an injury, the outside
hitting tandem of Brittany Lowe and
Krista Kelley have taken on the ma
jority ol the Broncos' offensive bur
den. Each is averaging over four kills
per game and Lowe has a team-high
405 on the season.
WCC Player of the Year and 2005
Ail-American setter Crystal Matich
averages over 13 assists per game,
while fellow senior Caroline Walters
anchors the defense at libero.
If the Cardinal wins tonight, the
team will play again tomorrow, tak
ing on the winner of the Minnesota-
Sacramento State match. The Cardi
nal beat the Golden Gophers (18-12,
11-9 Big Fen) in a preseason tourna
ment in September and faced the
Hornets in last year's first round. Be
cause the NCAA attempts to mini
mize travel for teams in the early
rounds of the tournament, the Hor
nets (28-7, 13-3) have seen their sea
son end in Maples three of the last
five years.
In three matches against Min
nesota and seven against Sacramen
to State in the past, Stanford has not
lost to either.

Minnesota was ranked No. 12 in
the preseason poll, but dropped out
of the Top 25 in October.The Golden
Gophers ended the preseason 7-3.
with losses to Stanford, Ohio and
California, and then won their first
five conference matches. After that,
though, the team hit a seven-game
skid, managing only two wins in the
month of October. They come to
Maples having lost to No. 7 Wiscon
sin last week but with five straight
wins before that.
Brook Dieter and Kyla Roehrig
lead the Minnesota offense with 396
and 350 kills, respectively, while Jessy
Jones — the only player still on the
roster from the Minnesota team that
faced Stanford in the 2004 National
Championship match — is a force at
the net with lfrO blocks. Libero Chris
tine Tan will likely pass the 500-dig
mark for the season tonight.
Sacramento State earned a spot in
the postseason by upsetting Portland
State in the Big Sky Conference
Tournament, just a week after losing
to the same team in regular season
play. In her 32nd and final season
with the Hornets, retiring coach
Debby Colberg saw her team win the
conference tournament for the sixth
straight time.
ITiis year's Hornets are led by
Missie Stidham, a senior transfer
who was on the St. Mary's squad that
beat the Cardinal twice in 2004. In
her first season with the team, Stid
ham has 676 kills, 570 digs and 56
aces — all team highs — and was
named Sports Imports/AVC'A Na
tional Player of the Week. Lindsay

Haupt is Sacramento State's top
blocker with 174 on the season and
Rose Burke is the setter.
Minnesota and Sacramento State
will play tonight at 5 p.m. with the
Stanford-Santa Clara match sched
uled to begin at 7:3op.m.The winners
will face off Saturday at 8 p.m. to
compete for a spot in next week's
Stanford Regional.
