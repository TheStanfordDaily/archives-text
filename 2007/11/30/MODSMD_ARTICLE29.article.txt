## It's all about the Axe 
### 
After another long year, the
Axe is back up for grabs in
the 110 th Big Game. One of
the greatest and most historic col
lege football rivalries will reignite
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, fea
turing two teams that have both had
underachieving seasons. But the
past is behind, and for three and a
half hours tomorrow afternoon, no
player will want anything more than
to be holding the Axe up as the final
whistle blows.
After the fifth game of the sea
son, both Cal and Stanford were on
football highs. Cal had just come off
of a huge win at Oregon, was unde
feated and was ranked No. 2 in the
nation. Stanford had just come off
its biggest win in program history, a
24-23 upset over then-No. 2 USC. It
looked as if both teams' seasons
were headed in the right direction.
Cal had its sights set on a Pac-10 and
BCS Championship. Stanford had
its sights set on a turnaround season
and a possible bowl berth.
But the season is twelve games,
not five.
Which brings us to tomorrow's
game, where both the Cardinal (3-8)
and the Golden Bears (6-5) have
lost five out of their last six games
and enter tomorrow's Big Game
with hopes of salvaging seasons that
once seemed so promising.
For Cal, problems started with a
stunning 31-28 loss at home to Ore
gon State (where they could not get
a play off in the waning seconds of
the game) and continued down
ward. For Stanford, it's the move
from the high of all highs (think
"Biggest Upset Ever") to the low of
all lows (46 points over the last four
games, culminating in a loss to lowly
Notre Dame). Both teams have
been underperforming, and both
have one game left to regain their
early season success.
For the past few seasons, this
game has brought more disappoint
ment than satisfaction to the Stan
ford campus. Last year's game,
though one of the Cardinal's best
performances of the year, resulted
in nothing more than a moral victo
ry-
But this isn't last season or any
season in some time. You have to go
back to 2003 to find a year that Cal
entered the Big Game with a
mediocre record (they were 6-6 and
won the game 28-16). For the first
time since then, Cal isn't a heavy fa
vorite.
For the past few seasons, Stan
ford has entered Big Game a sub
stantial underdog and the results
have proven it. This year, though
the Bears are favored, the matchup
on the field will be much more even
(as evident with last year's much
closer-than-expected game). In a
matter of weeks. Big Game has
gone from a seemingly automatic
loss to a great chance for Stanford
to win the Axe back and save an
enigma of a season.
It is also the first Big Game in the
renovated Stanford Stadium and
will feature a smaller, more intense
atmosphere.The stadium will be vir
tually sold out, and, in anticipation
of greater student interest, the Ath
letic Department added an extra
1,400 seats to the Red Zone.
Stanford has no bowl hopes. Cal
may not receive a bowl bid even
with a win. So that leaves just one
thing on the line tomorrow: The
Axe. And in a bitter rivalry game
like this, that is when everything
changes. Past results are thrown out
the door and records suddenly don't
indicate how good or bad the team
is. The teams drop down to equal
levels and it becomes a fight for
bragging rights, pride and, of course,
the Axe. The winner will be
whichever team wants it more.
How bad do we want the Axe?
The Axe is much more than a trophy
for the football team. It is a symbol
of Stanford pride, tradition and ex
cellence. It is a reminder that we are
just one step ahead of Cal. Unfortu
nately, we haven't been reminded of
these things for quite some time. It's
time to bring the Axe back to the
Farm.
For the past five years, Stanford
has had no success against Cal. But a
new coach, a new attitude, a new sta
dium and a new chance to beat the
Bears are all on the table. If we win
tomorrow, the school would be elec
trified.The football season would be
successful.The Axe would be ours.
Tomorrow, it won't matter thai
Stanford beat USC. It won't mattei
that Cal was once the second besl
team in the country. It won't mattei
that Cal has won five straight Bit
Games. It won't matter that Stan
ford is "better" than Cal. All that
matters is the Axe. And everyone
— players, coaches and fans
must do whatever it takes to make
sure that we are the ones holding it
up at the end of the game.
