# Football Mark Bradford
## Veteran leader steps up for Card 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN 
Stanford senior receiver
Mark Bradford has seen a
lot in his five years on the
Farm. Three coaches, four
starting quarterbacks and
more teammates have come and
gone than he can likely count. And.
sadly, four Big Game losses.
But since the 2(M)3 season, when
he started eight games and became
the first freshman to lead the Cardi
nal in receiving yards. Bradford has
accomplished plenty on his own. in
cluding 2.347 receiving yards in 45
games and 14 career touchdowns.
Playing just 12 days after the death
of his father. Bradford's leaping grab
on a fourth-down fade route sealed
the Cardinal's upset for the ages
over then-No. 2 IJSC on Oct. b — a

highlight sure to be repeated for
years to come.
Which makes it hard to believe
that after this Saturday's Big Game,
the senior wideout will have played
his last down for the team he has
made plays for so many times over
the last five years.
"To sum it up. it's bittersweet."
Bradford said. "I'm coming to the
end of my career at Stanford, having
all these ups and downs during the
season. I'm just happy I was able to
come back and enjoy this year with
my fellow teammates and guys that I
came in with. Just to be out there on
the field and be in their company
and enjoy being here and the chem
istry we have on the field. I'm not
going to have this anywhere else."

Bradford shined

Dame last week
end, catcing
seven passes for
11 1 yards. Brad
ford and his
teammates will
look to beat Cal
for the first time
since 2001.
Ed to he his last with the Cardinal,
but after injuring his foot in the sec
ond game of the season, the Los
Angeles native was sidelined for
the remainder of the year and al
lowed to return for a fifth season by
the NCAA.
As senior quarterback T.C. Ostran
der explained, Bradford's presence
on the field has been a true blessing
for the rebuilding Cardinal.
"He's got great hands; he's a
great athlete, an incredible route
runner," Ostrander said. "I've
never seen a guy be so precise and
be able to just beat his man one-on
one as well as Mark has, and he's
been able to do it since he stepped
on campus five years ago.
"1 think the thing about Mark is
he's just so consistent," Ostrander
added. "It helps as a quarterback to
have him out there and know that
he's going to do what he needs to
do on every play."
Bradford's contributions in re
cent weeks, including 12 receptions
for 141 yards against Washington
State and seven catches for 111
yards against Notre Dame last
week, have led the Cardinal
through the air in a pair of close
losses. They are especially impres
sive in light of persistent knee prob
lems that have hindered Bradford
for most of the season.
But with the game on the line
against the Irish last weekend and
Bradford the only Stanford receiv
er to notch more than one recep
tion on the day, a pair of passes to
the back of the end zone, which
could have tied the game for the
Cardinal, went to other targets and
were dropped.
While it's fair to wonder why
Bradford's number wasn't called in
crunch time, that's not something
he's been overly concerned with.
"For me it was more disappoint
ing that the catch [wasn't made],"
Bradford said. "I just wanted the
pass to be completed, no matter if it
goes to me, Evan [Moore] or
Richard [Sherman]. You know,
those guys were open and if they're
open 1 want them to get the ball and
make the catch and I'll celebrate at
the end of the game.
"It's not a matter of 'I want
every ball to come my way,' I just
want the plays to work and the of
fense to move the ball down the
field and score touchdowns."
Still, Bradford's statistics in re
cent weeks have put him back into
the spotlight going into this week
end's showdown with Cal — and
the Cardinal veteran wouldn't have
it any other way because he knows
exactly what's on the line as he clos
es out his Stanford career.
"It means everything," he said.
"Having to live in the Bay Area
these last four and a half years,
never winning that Axe — it's
been excruciating. Going around
Cal fans and knowing guys up
there, every time you see them it's
something else. It's a little bit of
bragging rights and a little bit of
pride. You never want to go out
never having beaten your rival, so
it's something that we're going to
be working hard [for], and it has to
happen this year [for me]. If not
now, then never."
And when that's over, the Cardi
nal's most consistent playmaker at
receiver over the past half-decade
will walk away with plenty of mem
ories of time well spent.
"I wouldn't have had the chance
to meet guys of this caliber any
where else in the country, and that's
something I'm going to cherish.
They're going to be there for me,
I'm going to be there for them and
that's something I'm going to carry

Bradford's contributions in re
cent weeks, including 12 receptions
for 141 yards against Washington
State and seven catches for 111
yards against Notre Dame last
week, have led the Cardinal
through the air in a pair of close
losses. They are especially impres
sive in light of persistent knee prob
lems that have hindered Bradford
for most of the season.
But with the game on the line
against the Irish last weekend and
Bradford the only Stanford receiv
er to notch more than one recep
tion on the day, a pair of passes to
the back of the end zone, which
could have tied the game for the
Cardinal, went to other targets and
were dropped.
While it's fair to wonder why
Bradford's number wasn't called in
crunch time, that's not something
he's been overly concerned with.
"For me it was more disappoint
ing that the catch [wasn't made],"
Bradford said. "I just wanted the
pass to be completed, no matter if it
goes to me, Evan [Moore] or
Richard [Sherman]. You know,
those guys were open and if they're
open 1 want them to get the ball and
make the catch and I'll celebrate at
the end of the game.
"It's not a matter of 'I want
every ball to come my way,' I just
want the plays to work and the of
fense to move the ball down the
field and score touchdowns."
Still, Bradford's statistics in re
cent weeks have put him back into
the spotlight going into this week
end's showdown with Cal — and
the Cardinal veteran wouldn't have
it any other way because he knows
exactly what's on the line as he clos
es out his Stanford career.
"It means everything," he said.
"Having to live in the Bay Area
these last four and a half years,
never winning that Axe — it's
been excruciating. Going around
Cal fans and knowing guys up
there, every time you see them it's
something else. It's a little bit of
bragging rights and a little bit of
pride. You never want to go out
never having beaten your rival, so
it's something that we're going to
be working hard [for], and it has to
happen this year [for me]. If not
now, then never."
And when that's over, the Cardi
nal's most consistent playmaker at
receiver over the past half-decade
will walk away with plenty of mem
ories of time well spent.
"I wouldn't have had the chance
to meet guys of this caliber any
where else in the country, and that's
something I'm going to cherish.
They're going to be there for me,
I'm going to be there for them and
that's something I'm going to carry
with me forever."
