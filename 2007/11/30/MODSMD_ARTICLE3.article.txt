# Football Mark Bradford
## Veteran leader steps up for Card 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN 
Stanford senior receiver
Mark Bradford has seen a
lot in his five years on the
Farm. Three coaches, four
starting quarterbacks and
more teammates have come and
gone than he can likely count. And.
sadly, four Big Game losses.
But since the 2(M)3 season, when
he started eight games and became
the first freshman to lead the Cardi
nal in receiving yards. Bradford has
accomplished plenty on his own. in
cluding 2.347 receiving yards in 45
games and 14 career touchdowns.
Playing just 12 days after the death
of his father. Bradford's leaping grab
on a fourth-down fade route sealed
the Cardinal's upset for the ages
over then-No. 2 IJSC on Oct. b â€” a

highlight sure to be repeated for
years to come.
Which makes it hard to believe
that after this Saturday's Big Game,
the senior wideout will have played
his last down for the team he has
made plays for so many times over
the last five years.
"To sum it up. it's bittersweet."
Bradford said. "I'm coming to the
end of my career at Stanford, having
all these ups and downs during the
season. I'm just happy I was able to
come back and enjoy this year with
my fellow teammates and guys that I
came in with. Just to be out there on
the field and be in their company
and enjoy being here and the chem
istry we have on the field. I'm not
going to have this anywhere else."
