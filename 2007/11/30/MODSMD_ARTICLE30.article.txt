Cal's program has gotten healthier each year Jeff
Tedfoid has been in charge:
2002
Fireworks opened a new era as Cal put 70 points on
Baylor in its hist game ond blew out Michigan State
on the road With talented quarterback Kyle Boiler
turning into one of the confeience's most potent
weapons, the Bears burst onto the Pac 10 scene by
beating Washington for the fitst time in 20 games and
winning their first Big Game over Stanford, 30-7,
since Keith Gilbertson's crew did it in 1994. The Bears
finish 7 - 5, but due to violations committed under H ol -
moe's watch, are burred from postseason competition.
2003
The Bears notch the biggest win in Tedford's tenure by
defeating eventual national champion USC 34-31 in
triple overtime. Cal establishes itself as one of the most
dangeious, well-balanced offensive attacks in the West.
An inconsistent 8-6 season ends on a winning note, with
a 28-16 victory against Stanfoid and an entertaining
52-49 Insight Bowl win ovei Virginia Tech.
2004
Cal rises to a No. 4 national ranking in a 10-2 cam
paign; its only tegular season loss is a barn-burning 23-
17 defeat at top-ranked USC. 41-6 winners against
Stanford, the Bears weie explosive by land and uir and
seemed destined for their first Rose Bowl berth since
1959 until an 11th hour poll scandal sends Texas to
Pasadeno and Cal to the Holiday Bowl. Deflated after the
controversial decision, Col fell in a 45-31 loss to Texas
Tech in that game. The team finishes 9th in the country,
and draft day extends Tedford's quarterback resume
when Aaron Rodgers is selected in the first round by the
Gteen Bay Packers.
2005
A 5 -0 start spins out into an 8-4 finish, ending on a high
note with 35-28 Las Vegas bowl win over BYU.
Turnover-prone quarterback Joe Ayoob is offset by a
great one-two punch at running back ond a ferocious de
fensive line, and the Axe is retained with a punishing 27-
3 win over Stanford. The Bears finish ranked No. 25.

2006
A highly anticipated year sees ESPN college football an
alyst Lee Com pick Cal to win the national champi
onship, but the Bears open with u hurmlatiny 35-18 loss
at Tennessee Tedford's squad runs off eight straight wins
after that, fielding a dramatic trio of receivers and a
strong rushing attack. Cornerback Duymeion Hughes
and running bock Marshawn Lynch both earn Pac 10
Player of the Yeai honors. Col beats Stanford, 26-17, in
the most closely contested Big Game since Stanford's
35-28 win in 2001 capped a seven year Cardinal
streak. USCs late season loss to UCLA combined with
Cal's fifth straight Big Game victory gives the Bears a
share of the Pac 10 championship, and they go on to de
stroy Texas A&M 45-10 in the Holiday Bowl
