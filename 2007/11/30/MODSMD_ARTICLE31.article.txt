# Turning the Bears around
## Cal's Jeff Tedford an example for Stanford's Jim Harbaugh 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tedford's history

If Stanford's much-maligned foot
ball team is looking for inspiration for
rebuilding its program, it should look
no further than the opposite sideline
tomorrow. Cal coach Jeff Tedford has
headed an amazing turnaround of
Golden Bear football, leading a mori
bund program to a 49-25 record and a
share of one Pac-10 title since arriving
at Berkeley in 2002. Like Cardinal
coach Jim Harbaugh, he is a former
quarterback and has embraced the
challenge of taking on a downtrodden
program.
The 46-year old Los Angeles native
fits in at one of the best public univer
sities in the country, citing his belief in
the game of football as not only a
sport, but as an educational opportuni
ty for players.
"Coach Tedford wasn't just a coach,
1 think of him as more like a father fig
ure...he prepares us to be men," line
backer Desmond Bishop said to Cal-
Bears.com

NFL. quarterback Trent Dilfer, the
1993 national leader in passing effi
ciency.
While critics have pointed to the
lack of success of his quarterbacks in
the NFL,Tedford's undeniable skill for
producing great college passers began
with Dilfer, who won a Super Bowl
with the Baltimore Ravens and has
also started in Tampa Bay, Seattle and
San Francisco.
"He's a great leader and great
teacher," Dilfer said of his mentor to
Calßears.com.
Tedford was named offensive coor
dinator at Oregon in 1998, where he
achieved great success. While at Ore
gon, he was frequently cited as a rising
star in college coaching as the Ducks
piled up a 38-10 record and their first
two 10-win seasons. The cycle of quar
terbacks continued: Akili Smith (1998
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year)
and Joey Harrington (All-American
and 2001 Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Year) were both drafted in the first
round of the NFL Draft; A.J. Feeley,
mostly a backup at Oregon, has also
started in the NFL.
After Oregon's win in the 2002 Fi
esta Bowl,Tedford took over at Cal for
Tom Holmoe, who resigned after years
of losing and a 1-10 season in 2001.
Each of Tedford's six seasons with the
Bears have given Cal fans something
to be excited about (see sidebar): From
their first winning season in a decade
to top-five national rankings and a
conference title, it has been an era of
smiles in Berkeley. Tedford's success

After playing quarterback for Fres
no State and in the Canadian Football
League, Tedford began his meteroric
rise in coaching ranks at his alma
mater in 1992, where he tutored future

and coaching prowess have led him to
be mentioned as a candidate for a mul
titude of job openings, both college
and professional.
In fairness to the job facing Har
baugh. Cal, a large public institution, is
certainly a different coaching situation
than Stanford, a private school. Stan
ford's extremely high academic stan
dards and lack of junior-college trans
fers lessen the possibility that a coach
can immediately shape a team to his
liking the way Tedford was able to.
Tedford has received considerable
support from athletic director Sandy
Barbour and an administration con
ducive to big-time football, eager to
garner the attention and pageantry a
successful football program can create.
Stanford has already implemented
one measure to move ahead of the
Bears — stadium improvements. Ted
ford's contract calls for the University
to undertake facilities improvements
to keep the program competitive with
its Pac-10 brethren. These have been
hampered by, among other things,
earthquake safety issues and activists
living in trees to prevent them from
being cleared for the construction of a
new athletic center.
Stanford tore down the 88,000-seat
Stanford Stadium in 2005 and opened
a brand-new 50.000 seat facility nine
months later. Saturday will be the first
Big Game played at Stanford since the
reconstruction.
