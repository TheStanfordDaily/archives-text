## Big Game Guidelines 
### BETSY WALLS INTERMISSION TREE HUGGER 
As its name implies. Big Game is no mere football game — it is THE
game if you're a Stanford student (unless, of course, you're talking about The Game, which is a
different game entirely and unrelated to what's going on in the stadium tomorrow). This is the
one football game that will attract even the most jaded senior, hardened by four losing seasons,
and the most clueless freshman who wouldn't know a defensive end if one sacked him in the
Quad. On this momentous occasion, even at too-cool-to-care (or too-stressed-to-stop) Stanford,
football ignorance earns the shame that it merits all year long. When game time hits, don't be
the sad and confused person who doesn't know the score both metaphorically and literally. In
stead, conduct yourself as a knowledgeable fan and be a source pride for your Cardinal brethren.

Know the basics
All of the information in this section should be common knowledge, but, unfortunately, many
students devote more brain space to things like academics, social issues and career aspirations
than they do to football. Fortunately, there is no need to pick and choose — the brain that got
you in to Stanford can also help you understand the fundamentals of the game, even if no one
will ever confuse you with an ESPN commentator.
Impress the following facts upon your mind and do not forget them: A team scores points in

football by getting the ball into the opposing team's end zone, conve
niently located at the end of the football field. If you run the ball in or
catch a pass while in the end zone, you get a touchdown, which is sue

points. After a touchdown, you get an extra point if you then kick the
ball between the uprights (the big thing standing in the end zone; you
can't miss it) or two if you again run or throw the ball in from a short
distance outside the end zone. You get a field goal if you kick the ball

between the uprights, which gives you three points.
Other worthwhile terminology to remember: Stanford is on offense
when we have the ball and are trying to score, defense when Cal has
the ball and we are trying to get it back. A first down is a good thing,
going "3-and-out" is a bad thing. It's bad if your quarterback gets
sacked, but good if Cal's does.

If all of this is too hard, just use common sense — if a Stan
ford student runs a long way or catches the ball, that's impressive,
right? And it's also a good thing in football.
Your backup plan, should all of your new knowledge evap
orate the moment they scan your SUID at the gate, is to beg
your more informed friends to help you understand what's
going on.

Know your history
You've heard something about an axe? Firstly, THAT
AXE IS OURS. It was conceptualized by a Stanford fan,
who also came up with the most traditional Big Game
cheer to accompany the literal Axe: "Give 'em the axe, the
axe, the axe, give 'em the axe, the axes... Where? Right in
the neck, the neck, the neck..." (and so on). Dirty Cal stu
dents stole the Axe, we rightfully and righteously re-

claimed it. they stole it again, we again triumphed over
their weeniness and so on until it was agreed that who
ever won Big Game could keep the axe. OUR AXE
has been imprisoned on the wrong side of the Bay for
almost five years now. We want it back.
It is also necessary to know about The Hay. If you

know anything about football, you are probably fa
miliar the story, but here it is in a nutshell: At the
end of Big Game in 1982 with only four seconds left
on the clock. Cal managed to lateral (i.e., throw

hori
zontally) the football five times to score a
touchdown and win the game — after the Band had
already rushed the field. This was a less-than-proud moment for
everyone involved, and, unfortunately, visiting teams love to remind us of it by
attempting to replicate it as Notre Dame did at one point during last Saturday's game. We

do not find this funny.
Lastly, know that though we've been down for a few years. Stanford is up overall in the con
test. having won 54, lost 44, and tied 11 Big Games. (Note to the football neophyte: ties are no
longer possible; we go to overtime these days.)
Trivia question: Which U.S. president forgot to bring the ball to the first Big Game? Answer:
The only one who has a tower on campus. Think about it.

Be spirited
Wear a red shirt. This is required. Ideally, this shirt should either be the official Red Zone
shirt or have something insulting about Cal on it, like the ones sold by the Student Store or made
up by enterprising dorms. You get extra credit for wearing some kind of white along with your
red shirt, but then again, the fashion conscious may balk at the idea of white pants after Labor
Day. They are permitted to skip the white. Extra credit for anyone who comes with pom-poms,
foam fingers, mutilated teddy bears. Big Game buttons, any kind of body or face paint, etc.

You must cheer, and you must cheer correctly. Jingle your keys
when we kick off the football but not when Cal kicks. Be quiet when
our team is on offense — this helps them to hear what's going on and
communicate with each other. For the same reason, be loud when Cal
is on offense so they are confused and distraught at the sight of the
roaring red mob in the student section. Be especially loud on Cal's
third downs — yell, stomp, drum your hands on the lovely new red

seats.
Most importantly of all, if the Band starts playing "All Right
Now," bounce around until you hear "5,6,7,8" then jump and shout
"Woo!" Even ProFros halfway through Admit Weekend know how
to do this. You should too.
Big Game offers the special opportunity to take advantage of
Cal-specific cheers. Naturally, you will want to chant "Give 'em the
axe!" with vigor. "Safety school," repeated with the proper ca
dence, is also more than suited for this particular game.

Be classy
While having lots of spirit and school pride is the best part of
college football, even ap fans, students should behave as the intel
ligent and secure individuals that they are. Part of this is remaining
positive about the game no matter what happens. Sure, as red
blooded Card fans, we'd to love see our team win a blow-out game
against those dirty Bears. However, an amazing comeback is
thrilling as well and would get the Card even more highlights on
Sports Center. As Yogi Berra said, "It ain't over 'til it's over."
Until the last second ticks off the clock, the game is still going, and
your responsibility to cheer on your team continues.
Being a classy fan very importantly includes being nice to the
opposing fans and team. This is a fun rivalry, not some uncivi
lized brawl. Applaud when an injured player leaves the field
whether it is a Stanford player or a Cal player. Don't be profane
or obscene toward Cal fans — we already know we're better
than they arc and there is no need to stoop to immature behav
ior. (This advice is not directed at the Band; you guys keep
doing your thing.) Seriously, there is no reason that we should
n't treat Cal fans with respect just because we are playing their
team at football. Love the scholar, hate the school.
Lastly, for the love of all that is Cardinal-

dents stole the Axe, we rightfully and righteously re-

claimed it. they stole it again, we again triumphed over
their weeniness and so on until it was agreed that who
ever won Big Game could keep the axe. OUR AXE
has been imprisoned on the wrong side of the Bay for
almost five years now. We want it back.
It is also necessary to know about The Hay. If you

know anything about football, you are probably fa
miliar the story, but here it is in a nutshell: At the
end of Big Game in 1982 with only four seconds left
on the clock. Cal managed to lateral (i.e., throw

hori
zontally) the football five times to score a
touchdown and win the game — after the Band had
already rushed the field. This was a less-than-proud moment for
everyone involved, and, unfortunately, visiting teams love to remind us of it by
attempting to replicate it as Notre Dame did at one point during last Saturday's game. We

do not find this funny.
Lastly, know that though we've been down for a few years. Stanford is up overall in the con
test. having won 54, lost 44, and tied 11 Big Games. (Note to the football neophyte: ties are no
longer possible; we go to overtime these days.)
Trivia question: Which U.S. president forgot to bring the ball to the first Big Game? Answer:
The only one who has a tower on campus. Think about it.

Be spirited
Wear a red shirt. This is required. Ideally, this shirt should either be the official Red Zone
shirt or have something insulting about Cal on it, like the ones sold by the Student Store or made
up by enterprising dorms. You get extra credit for wearing some kind of white along with your
red shirt, but then again, the fashion conscious may balk at the idea of white pants after Labor
Day. They are permitted to skip the white. Extra credit for anyone who comes with pom-poms,
foam fingers, mutilated teddy bears. Big Game buttons, any kind of body or face paint, etc.

You must cheer, and you must cheer correctly. Jingle your keys
when we kick off the football but not when Cal kicks. Be quiet when
our team is on offense — this helps them to hear what's going on and
communicate with each other. For the same reason, be loud when Cal
is on offense so they are confused and distraught at the sight of the
roaring red mob in the student section. Be especially loud on Cal's
third downs — yell, stomp, drum your hands on the lovely new red

seats.
Most importantly of all, if the Band starts playing "All Right
Now," bounce around until you hear "5,6,7,8" then jump and shout
"Woo!" Even ProFros halfway through Admit Weekend know how
to do this. You should too.
Big Game offers the special opportunity to take advantage of
Cal-specific cheers. Naturally, you will want to chant "Give 'em the
axe!" with vigor. "Safety school," repeated with the proper ca
dence, is also more than suited for this particular game.

Be classy
While having lots of spirit and school pride is the best part of
college football, even ap fans, students should behave as the intel
ligent and secure individuals that they are. Part of this is remaining
positive about the game no matter what happens. Sure, as red
blooded Card fans, we'd to love see our team win a blow-out game
against those dirty Bears. However, an amazing comeback is
thrilling as well and would get the Card even more highlights on
Sports Center. As Yogi Berra said, "It ain't over 'til it's over."
Until the last second ticks off the clock, the game is still going, and
your responsibility to cheer on your team continues.
Being a classy fan very importantly includes being nice to the
opposing fans and team. This is a fun rivalry, not some uncivi
lized brawl. Applaud when an injured player leaves the field
whether it is a Stanford player or a Cal player. Don't be profane
or obscene toward Cal fans — we already know we're better
than they arc and there is no need to stoop to immature behav
ior. (This advice is not directed at the Band; you guys keep
doing your thing.) Seriously, there is no reason that we should
n't treat Cal fans with respect just because we are playing their
team at football. Love the scholar, hate the school.
Lastly, for the love of all that is Cardinal-
Be sure the game is over before you rush the field!
As its name implies. Big Game is no mere football game — it is THE
game if you're a Stanford student (unless, of course, you're talking about The Game, which is a
different game entirely and unrelated to what's going on in the stadium tomorrow). This is the
one football game that will attract even the most jaded senior, hardened by four losing seasons,
and the most clueless freshman who wouldn't know a defensive end if one sacked him in the
Quad. On this momentous occasion, even at too-cool-to-care (or too-stressed-to-stop) Stanford,
football ignorance earns the shame that it merits all year long. When game time hits, don't be
the sad and confused person who doesn't know the score both metaphorically and literally. In
stead, conduct yourself as a knowledgeable fan and be a source pride for your Cardinal brethren.

Know the basics
All of the information in this section should be common knowledge, but, unfortunately, many
students devote more brain space to things like academics, social issues and career aspirations
than they do to football. Fortunately, there is no need to pick and choose — the brain that got
you in to Stanford can also help you understand the fundamentals of the game, even if no one
will ever confuse you with an ESPN commentator.
Impress the following facts upon your mind and do not forget them: A team scores points in

football by getting the ball into the opposing team's end zone, conve
niently located at the end of the football field. If you run the ball in or
catch a pass while in the end zone, you get a touchdown, which is sue

points. After a touchdown, you get an extra point if you then kick the
ball between the uprights (the big thing standing in the end zone; you
can't miss it) or two if you again run or throw the ball in from a short
distance outside the end zone. You get a field goal if you kick the ball

between the uprights, which gives you three points.
Other worthwhile terminology to remember: Stanford is on offense
when we have the ball and are trying to score, defense when Cal has
the ball and we are trying to get it back. A first down is a good thing,
going "3-and-out" is a bad thing. It's bad if your quarterback gets
sacked, but good if Cal's does.

If all of this is too hard, just use common sense — if a Stan
ford student runs a long way or catches the ball, that's impressive,
right? And it's also a good thing in football.
Your backup plan, should all of your new knowledge evap
orate the moment they scan your SUID at the gate, is to beg
your more informed friends to help you understand what's
going on.

Know your history
You've heard something about an axe? Firstly, THAT
AXE IS OURS. It was conceptualized by a Stanford fan,
who also came up with the most traditional Big Game
cheer to accompany the literal Axe: "Give 'em the axe, the
axe, the axe, give 'em the axe, the axes... Where? Right in
the neck, the neck, the neck..." (and so on). Dirty Cal stu
dents stole the Axe, we rightfully and righteously re-

claimed it. they stole it again, we again triumphed over
their weeniness and so on until it was agreed that who
ever won Big Game could keep the axe. OUR AXE
has been imprisoned on the wrong side of the Bay for
