## California Café: Pricey, Dicey 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION TONGUES 
Salutations, gentle diner! 'Tis the week of
the grand collegiate rivalry. Huzzah! We are,
of course, looking forward to the exalted up
coming game in which our beefy, Cardinal
hued male representatives will grapple inti
mately with some other sweaty men as they
hash out our cherished intercollegiate hatred
and toss around the ol' pigskin. Yippee!
In preparation for what we anticipate will
be a good sports-based trouncing of those rap
scallions at Cal. we'll treat to you a good
trouncing of a nominally Cal-related eating
establishment: The California Cafe.
This eatery is rarely frequented by Stan
ford students, and for good reason. It's pricey,
and it's not particularly accessible; it's hidden
in a large barn on Welch road, a block down
from Nordstrom. And to be honest, it's aimed
at the kind of people who shop at Nordstrom:
the charmingly tasteless elderly and their vic
tims (grandchildren and daughters-in-law).
Did we mention that there was soft rock and
jazz playing over the loudspeakers? Because
there was. Ewwwwww. But apparently the
Cafe has not been unsuccessful; it boasts six
nation-wide locations, including one in King
of Prussia. PA. (!)
The interior decor of the restaurant is best
described as Howard-Johnson-meets-alpine
ski-lodge-chic. The HoJo factor is produced
by the Cafe's immaculate hotel-furnishings
aesthetic. There are tidy booths, weirdly floral
fabric patterns, potted plants, liberally scat
tered poinscttias and other additions that re
mind one forcibly of a hotel brunch area. And
10, the Caf«s serves brunch on Saturdays and
Sundays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.! Anyway.
Above the large-ish dining area arches a love
ly, dark raked roof (it is, after all. a converted
barn). The place has room for outdoor and in
door dining, in addition to an event room.
In stark contrast to the straight-laced qual
ity of their decor, the California Cafc serves
up a flirty menu that is alternately enticing

and overpriced

Sure,

our mouths started watering as soon as we
read the "Small Plates" menu, which included
shrimp satay with mango coulis, pork pot
stickers with chili-garlic aioli and salmon
spring rolls. (If that list doesn't make your
mouth water, then we can't help you; you're a
frigid diner. Stop reading. Just stop it.)
But witness how the aforementioned
"Small Plates" list is also unbearably preten
tious. Consider that "shrimp satay with
niango coulis" roughly translates to "shrimp
on a long toothpick with mushed mango," and
that "chili-garlic aioli" simply means "fancy
mayonnaise." We appreciate the highbrow
food vocab, but calling mayonnaise "aioli"
doesn't mean that one can charge $7.75 for the
five pork potstickers that accompanied the
"aioli." Five. We find this abuse of power to be
both repugnant and damaging to our tiny wal
lets.
And speaking of pretension, we should
probably mention that the "Small Plates"
menu is divided into the following categories:
leafy, savory, sassy and lively. "Sassy" in
cludes crab cakes. Oh, those sassy crabs. The
"Main Plates" menu features only three cate
gories: water, fire, and earth & air. These
groups make slightly more sense, as they seem
to indicate where their contents come from.
"Water," for example, includes the seafood
dishes. "Earth & air" features both airborne
critters land-based mammals. "Fire" includes
tofu and pasta. (???)
We should also mention that the main
plates range between $11.95 (for tofu, be
cause who wants that?) and $31 (for filet
mignon, because who doesn't want that?).
Most dishes fall between $20 and $25, and in
explicably pair foods people want and don't
want. More on that soon.
For starters, Janet had the "Warm Cambo
zola," which was essentially a mini-fondue ac
companied by crackers, tomato garnish and
garlic. All this for only $10.50! (Yikes). We
did enjoy it. though; the garlic came in whole
cloves, which was pretty neat. The cheese was
lovely, the crackers were a bit dull, but, all in
all, the idea was clever, and the result was

rather tasty. Ruth ordered the

aforementioned pot-

stickers, which

came in a

\ tiny

frying pan, into which our waiter poured the
aioli at the last minute, producing a dramatic
bout of steam. The waiter blushed and mut
tered, "It's supposed to be theatrical. Like
Benihana." Theatricality aside, the potstick
ers were decent: the soy sauce caramelized
onto the unusually thin dumpling wrapper,
which encompassed the same sort of uniden
tifiable-but-tasty meat filling that Jing Jing
serves up.
We were a little full when the entrees ar-

rived — the appetizers, in keeping with the
California aesthetic, are anxious to please and
of hearty proportions — but we gave the food
the old college try (unlike those wimpy
Berkeley whippersnappers, who are cowards
and girly-men). Janet had the Flat Iron Steak
($24), which came with a "potato brulee"
topped with onion rings, white cheddar and
sour cream. The potato/onion accompani
ment was tasty but artery-stopping. The steak,
which Janet takes medium-rare like any de
cent caveman, was a bit heavily loaded with
peppercorn, but, on the whole, fresh and
pleasantly undercooked.
Ruth pulled from the "Water" menu and
had the ahi tuna on a bed of udon noodles
with mango garnish and veggies ($25), for
which our bashful waiter laid down on the
table a single pair of cheap, disposable chop
sticks. It was anticlimactic. The ahi was as
fresh as the steak, with a light sear around the
periphery so as to minimally damage the fish,
and the mango garnish was tangy without
being cloying. The accompanying noodles,
however, were arranged in a weird salad as
sortment and weighed down the dish. Janet
chimed in with the opinion that they were
"fast-food-quality udon noodles," and Janet
is from Korea, so she probably knows about
Asian things. The whole ahi enterprise was
served on a triangular plate, just to emphasize
the innovative Asian-ness of this dish. Again,
can you see how this appeals to the elderly?
Oh my goodness, Asia! Asian foods! Do they
really eat on triangular plates there? This fish
isn't even cooked! etc.
We then solicited a dessert menu from our
overly friendly waiter and were tempted by a
range of excellent-sounding options, such as

the warm chocolate truffle cake, pumpkin
cheesecake, and green apple crcme brulee.
The dessert choices range between $5 and
$12.50, and the menu also includes teas,
espresso drinks and some lovely sounding al
coholic espresso drinks that we couldn't
order. Bummer.
We were tempted by all of the delicious,
conventional foods that we know to be deli
cious, but when we spotted the Poached Bosc
Pear (served with "caramel balsamic gelato.

sweet balsamic reduction") we knew we had
finally found something daring and danger
ous to test our mettle as real men. Here was a
story we could tell the grandchildren, an
episode to persuade our parents that Palo
Alto was a rollickin' dangerous place.
The pear dish arrived as a fan of sweet
ened. syrup-drenched pear slices topped with
dark brown balsamic reduction, crumbled
peanuts and the mysterious "caramel balsam
ic gelato," which was also drizzled with bal
samic reduction. The dangerous, smoky
sharp flavor of the vinegar still shot through
the reduction, and its übiquity on the plate
made eating dessert a time-consuming, unsat
isfying ordeal — not unlike perennially fol
lowing Stanford's football season with the
hope that someday we'll win more games than
we lose. The caramel balsamic gelato was in
triguingly tangy. but the rest of the unfortu
nate dish left us gulping down water. We can
blame this fiasco on the California Cafe's own
Chef Bob who, as their website tells us,
worked his way up to being Executive Chef by
travailing long and hard as a kitchen lackey
and "Saucier." We do not tell a lie. Ruth, too,
used to be saucier, but childbirth really takes
that out of a woman.
But wait! We're supposed to end on a spir
ited. self-congratulatory note that promotes a
rivalry we care next to nothing about. OK,
what about this: if Cal's American Football
(not to be confused with futbol) team is as ter
rible as the California Cafe's pears-with-bal
samic-reduction, then... we 11... we might lose
by the low double digits. Go team!
