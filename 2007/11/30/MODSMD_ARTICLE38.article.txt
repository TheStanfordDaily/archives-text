## Don't all this winter 
### KASONNI SCALES INTERMISSION BUNDLER 
For those of you not quite brave enough to bare
it all in the cold, winter fashions have enough spice
to keep you hot during the chilly
winter months.

The clothing for (his
winter season offers you a
chance to mix functionality

and creativity for truly in
spired dressing. Yes, staying

warm is the primary goal, but 1
why not add another one?
Why not stand out during the

year's dullest months? The
easiest way to do this is to first
add color.

Grey and black will always
be acceptable during the winter
season, but experimenting with
color makes everything more

fun. Remember finger painting *
as a kid? Possibly the last time 1
some of us dealt with paint. Well,
dig deep and whip out those prima-

ry and secondary color mixing
skills. Jewel tones were hot this sea-

son with labels like Dior, Chanel and
Versace turning out dresses and

coats in shades of purple, green, yel
low, blue and teal. The best way to

approach this trend is to buy a ,
solid-colored coat or dress and '

color-block it with another piece.
Look to Prada for innovative ideas.

Now, since the possibility of your

blending into the landscape of neutrals is gone, let's
get down to the nitty gritty of the season's top styles.
I'll start with shoes and accessories. First up, bright
patterned scarves. Everyone did these: Balenciaga,
Chanel and, of course, Hermes. Some looked like
painter canvases while others were a mix of ikat, Pe
ruvian, African and other ethnic-inspired patterns.
With this accessory, do not be afraid of embellish
ments, like fringe and bold styling, or wearing the
scarf wrapped around your head like a gypsy.
And you definitely can't go without a great pair
of boots. Choose based on your level of tolerance
and temerity. The highest level — stiletto boots!
And there are great options from there on down.
Great styles come with stacked, high and kitten
heels. But my favorites are riding-style boots, which
have very low heels. Ankle boots are another op
tion, best worn with tights and a knee-length (or
shorter) dress. Lastly, Oxford lace-up shoes are
looking very feminine this season. These will defi
nitely make a statement.
As for clothes this season, the possibilities
abound. Depending on your shape and size, choose
from the many silhouettes winter has to offer.
One of my favorites this season is sweater dress
es. Who knew that the sweater could be the most
important item in your outfit? Proenza Schouler,
Michael Kors and Stella McCartney all showed
variations of the sweater dress. To create an hour
glass shape, cinch it at the waist with a belt. For an
k ther easy look, pair an oversized V-neck cardigan

with leggings. When dealing with statement

pieces, simplicity is best and easiest.

Another great look for this sea
son is menswear inspired

clothes. Girls — borrow from
your boyfriends (if they have

good taste), or better yet, get your own pieces.
Wide, slouchy pants are surprisingly sophisticated;
pair these with a crisp, white button-down shirt.
Other handy pieces that can achieve this J^jj

look are vests, tailored jackets and tuxe
do-inspired jackets, pants and tops.

Word to the wise: do not pair too many
of these together to avoid looking
costume-y.

Lastly, a few words on the most
important piece to buy this season
(which has ousted the coat as the key

winter staple) — the jacket! They
came in all sorts of shapes, sizes I
and colors, but a few stand out. J

The blazer, particularly the
schoolboy blazer Balenciaga
sent down the runways, is very
smart. Cropped, double-

breasted arid biker jackets
with lots of details like over
sized buttons, zippers, studs,
military accents and patches
are other great alternatives.
The leather jacket also came
in many great styles, my fa
vorite being a hoodie by the
L.A. based brand
Mike&Chris. To find these
great styles check out stores
like H&M, the Gap and Zara.
