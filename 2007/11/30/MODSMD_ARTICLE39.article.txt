# "Margot" weds awkwardness and honesty

### JEFF TAI INTERMISSION BEST MAN 
In case you haven't noticed, there is a for
mula to most "breakout" indie films. Just pop
in your beloved, Blu-Ray copy of "Little Miss
Sunshine" or Zach Braff s annoyingly popular
"Garden State" and take a peek.

Here's a handy checklist to sec how your
Facebook favorites stack up. Do they have: A)

a lovable cast of archetypal, "non-stereotypi
cal" misfits. B) a hip, diverse soundtrack

chock full of alternative artists — with
bonus points for songs by The Shins, any

generic contemporaries of the aforemen
tioned band, or a British Invasion group

harking from the '60s, or C) a reel-good end
ing laced with just enough melancholy to bam-

boozle you into thinking you just saw a com
plex story? 1 low about all of the above? If so,
you've just seen an indie crossover hit! It's al-

most as easy as baking Pillsbury instant cin
namon rolls.

Nothing's wrong with any movies that fol-

W My point, however, is that if you're
looking for something like the above,

Noah Baumbach's follow-up to his
2005 Sundance darling — "The Squid and
the Whale" — probably isn't for you.

In many ways, Baumbach's latest
film feels like an older sister to his earlier
effort. And for the most part. I think fans
of "The Squid and the Whale" will proba-

bly be satisfied. "Margot at the Wedding"
is a lovingly made movie with Baumbach's
trademark combination of bittersweet

humor, sharp dialogue and complicated char
acters who fumble around, trying to re-estab
lish their crumbling relationships with one an
other.

What elevates ihis film, I think, and
sets it apart from his previous ones, is
Baumbach's daring to take on a
painfully honest, at times unrelenting.

story. Unfortunately,

consider something else.
