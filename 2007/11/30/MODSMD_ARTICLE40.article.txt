# BEARS THAT CAN'T BE BEATEN (UNLIKE CAL!)
## 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION PAPA BEAR 
Ursa Major and Ursa Minor

Bears are not funny. Bears are horrifying. They
are very large, have far more teeth than is strictly
necessary and can ride a unicycle faster than a man.
Their only natural predator is the dirigible. Freed
from this fear by recent downturns in lighter-than
air vehicle futures, they spend their time shambling
about the woods and ripping out the spines of lost
hikers in a protracted act of vengeance against the
California State Lottery Commission. No bear has
ever won the lottery.
Nevertheless, bears' reign of terror, much like
that of Genghis Khan or ABBA, has proved a his
torically significant force. Bears fill our past and,
consequently, our cultural imagination, with their
hazily belligerent eyes, their cutlery-sized claws
and their bewildering tendency to chase us through
the halls of the Library of Congress while singing
Earth, Wind & Fire B-sides until we wake up in a
cold sweat on a couch next to a strange woman with
a name tag reading "Steve." What follows is a list
of the more significant of these terrible creatures.

Fictional Bears

The Three Bears
In his seminal work on

fairy tales "The Uses of
« Enchantment," Freudian

psychologist Bruno

Bettelheim

s u g

gests that the three bears represent puberty,
Goldilocks represents sexual awakening and the
porridge represents the Weimar Republic. And
masturbation.
Fuzzy Wuzzy
The twist ending of this popular children's
rhyme ("Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?) is said
to have inspired the 1995 film "The Usual Sus
pects."
Baloo
Bears don't sing, Mr. Disney.
John Irving's Bears
Bears pop up in at least three of the bestselling
author's novels, joining other recurring elements in
Irving's work such as Phillips-Exeter, prostitutes,
wrestling, racquetball, sexual deviance, amputa
tion, Vienna, car accidents, missing parents and re
lationships with older women. Scholars have re
cently determined that he has, in fact, been pub
lishing the same novel over and over again since
the mid '70s, sometimes not even bothering to
change the name (see "The World According to
Garp," 1978; "The World According to Garp,"
1986; "The World According to Garp," 1989).
The Berenstain Bears
While the Berenstain family was featured in its
own book series and television program, it is per
haps best known for its video game spinoff, "Ex
treme Sports with the Berenstain Bears," rated
"What? Really?" by ign.com and "This can't be a

real thing (it is a real thing)" by Electronic Gamer
Monthly.

Winnie the Pooh
A Bear of Very Little Brain.

I The Exit-Pursuing Bear
A product of one of Shakespeare's greatest

stage directions ("Exit, pursued by a bear," "A
Winter's Tale"), second only in quality to "Ham
let"'s "Everbody [sic] dies."
Factual Bear
Smokey Bear
Rescued from a New Mexico wildfire by forest
rangers, the real-life Smokey was a popular fixture
in the lives of regional National Park workers, well
liked for his sunny disposition, mischievous ways
and pathological hatred of fire. He coexisted hap
pily with a family of four until Hanukkah came
around, at which point he reverted to his natural
savagery and. after tearing the limbs off his care
takers, invested heavily in fire extinguishers.
Owsley "Bear" Stanley
Soundman for the Grateful Dead and producer
of staggering amounts of acid, Owsley was nick
named "Bear" in reference to the iconic "march
ing bear" images he stamped on sheets of LSD.
Also, he ate Bill Kreutzmann.
The Teddy Bear
This popular toy originated from the story of
one of President Theodore Roosevelt's hunting
trips. His friends, having treed a bear, suggested
that Roosevelt shoot the animal. The President re
fused on the grounds that to do so would be un
sportsmanlike, opting instead to kill every Filipino
over the age of ten.
Gummi Bears
Delicious.
The Dancing Bear
A cruel medieval circus archetype (cf. unicy
cling bear), this strangely compelling figure both
appeals to our inherent vindictive need to see the
majestic reduced to the ridiculous. Plus, it's just
plain hilarious. That bear thinks it's people!

Widely recognized by astronomers as the
dumbest constellations, these stars resemble
bears in much the same way that a volleyball net re
sembles "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," which is to
say only in the case of a very painstakingly crafted
and impractical volleyball net.

Albert the Bear, First Margrave of Brandenburg
Best Margrave ever.

Metaphorical Bears

The Russian Bear
One of the more respected cultural mas-

cots — vastly superior to John Bull and
Uncle Sam, and only narrowly edged

out of the top spot by the University of
Delaware Blue Hen.

The Bear Market

Unpopular at cocktail par
ties and social luncheons, the
bear market spends much of its
time at home, playing solitaire
and devaluing the dollar.

The Bear That May or May
Not Shit in the Woods

11V/1 vJilil 111 111V TT Wl/VJO
The subject of an enormous
ly frustrating question that has
inspired any number of ultimate-

ly unsuccessful research efforts. 1
Most scientists have abandoned this
conundrum as a lost cause, instead

devoting their time to examining
whether or not the Pope is Catholic.

The California Golden Bear
Delicious.
