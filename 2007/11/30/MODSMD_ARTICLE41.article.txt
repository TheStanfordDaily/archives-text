## Make finals week bear-able 
### MATT BUSH INTERMISSION CAVE DWELLER 
Ah, December, the month of holiday spirit and celebration
— bat also a big month for class stresses, winter blues and all
too-contagious seasonal sniffles. These last few slim weeks of
the quarter determine over half of our class grades, and, after

nine weeks of studying and study breaks, even our

usual naps and trips to LateNite don't seem all

that exciting. So here are seven solid sugges
tions for ways to relax — and show your

support for Saturday's Big Game —in
these coming weeks. After all, there are

and getting their butts kicked at Big Game.

have extra candy. Or why not make an event out of it — throw
a bonfire at Lake Lag's fire pit, complete with s'mores! And as
an expression of Stanford spirit, buy bear-shaped cookies or
gummy bears and violently bite off each of their heads, one by
one.

2. Go off-campus for coffee or bubble tea. If you need a

quiet, warm place to brainstorm your hnal paper or polish that

problem set with easy access to caffeine, neither a noisy

dorm room nor a no-food-or-drink library will cut it.
Instead, head to downtown Palo Alto where there

are plenty of cafes, complete with requisite yuppies,

businesspeople and tired parents — and thankfully

devoid of students radiating their pre-finals stress.

3. Meditate or relax in your favorite
quiet spot. Find a comfortable spot to sit and ,
clear your mind in MemChu, in the li-

brary or on your dorm balcony or roof
(bonus points if it's raining!). If you're not

the kind to sit still for a long time, perhaps
stretching or calisthenics will do the trick —

just don't start sweating on your textbooks.

4 Surf the Internet. I'm not talking about
the usual sites like Facebook and Wikipedia that
you may already associate with procrastination.
Why not go to a - blog site like Xanga or Live-

long-lost high-school friends or on
line pals. Or look through your

5. Go to bed early.

Even if you have a paper
due

the next day, chances are the paper's going to make a lot more
sense if you work on it after a solid eight or nine hours of sleep.
You'll feel great when you wake up early, and you can finally
meet all the strange people who eat breakfast

the moment the dining halls open at 7:30.

Now that you're awake before your

roommate, you can finally get back at

him or her for always pressing

snooze four or five times before get-1
ting up. If you go to bed before mid
night during this coming Dead Week,

be sure to wear earplugs or, otherwise,
brace yourself for Primal Scream!

6. Plan a cuddle party or massage

party with your hall or your
dorm. Remind everyone how

important Branner Love or

Larkin Love or Co-op Love is while

you're excitedly rubbing the back of that cute girl down
the hall or finally satisfying that odd urge to express a deep

familial appreciation for your roommate. What better than an
innocent way for your dorm to bond and show care for each
other — especially when you start mercilessly tearing each
other down during Secret Snowflake next week.
7. Do something artsy or crafty to show your support for
Stanford or Big Game. Ixarn how to knit and make Cardinal
colored scarves and sweaters for yourself and your friends.
Raid your dorm basement or student centers for sup-

piles to maice Dig signs to noia up at tne uame. ur

ering bear and set them up on the Intersection of

the night.
