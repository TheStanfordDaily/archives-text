## "Atonement" is guiltless 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION CINEMATIC SINNERS 
Salutations, gentle diner! 'Tis the week of
the grand collegiate rivalry. Huzzah! We are,
of course, looking forward to the exalted up
coming game in which our beefy, Cardinal
hued male representatives will grapple inti
mately with some other sweaty men as they
hash out our cherished intercollegiate hatred
and toss around the ol' pigskin. Yippee!
In preparation for what we anticipate will
be a good sports-based trouncing of those rap
scallions at Cal. we'll treat to you a good
trouncing of a nominally Cal-related eating
establishment: The California Cafe.
This eatery is rarely frequented by Stan
lord students, and for good reason. It's pricey,
and it's not particularly accessible; it's hidden
in a large barn on Welch road, a block down
from Nordstrom. And to be honest, it's aimed
at the kind of people who shop at Nordstrom:
the charmingly tasteless elderly and their vic
tims (grandchildren and daughters-in-law).
Did we mention that there was soft rock and
jazz playing over the loudspeakers? Because
there was. Ewwwwww. But apparently the
Cafe has not been unsuccessful; it boasts six
nation-wide locations, including one in King
of Prussia, PA. (!)
The interior decor of the restaurant is best
described as Howard-Johnson-meets-alpine
ski-lodge-chic. The HoJo factor is produced
by the Cafe's immaculate hotel-furnishings
aesthetic. There are tidy

booths, weirdly tloral fabric
' patterns, potted plants, lib-
I orally scattered poinsettias
I and other additions that re-
I mind one forcibly of a hotel
I brunch area. And 10, the
| Cafe serves brunch on Satur-
I days and Sundays from 11

a.m. to 4 p.m.! Anyway. Above
the large-ish dining area arches
a lovely, dark raked roof (it

is. after all, a converted
barn). The place has
room for outdoor and

indoor dining, iti ad
dition to an event
room.
In stark contrast
to the straight-laced
quality of their
decor, the California
Cafe serves up a flir
ty menu that is alter-

Inately enticing and
over-

priced. Sure, our mouths started watering as
soon as we read the "Small Plates" menu,
which included shrimp satay with mango
coulis, pork potstickers with chili-garlic aioli
and salmon spring rolls. (If that list doesn't
make your mouth water, then we can't help
you; you're a frigid diner. Stop reading. Just
stop it.)
But witness how the aforementioned
"Small Plates" list is also unbearably preten
tious. Consider that "shrimp satay with
mango coulis" roughly translates to "shrimp
on a long toothpick with mushed mango," and
that "chili-garlic aioli'' simply means "fancy
mayonnaise." We appreciate the highbrow
food vocab, but calling mayonnaise "aioli"
doesn't mean that one can charge $7.75 for the
five pork potstickers that accompanied the
"aioli." Five. We find this abuse of power to be
both repugnant and damaging to our tiny wal
lets.
And speaking of pretension, we should
probably mention that the "Small Plates"
menu is divided into the following categories:
leafy, savory, sassy and lively. "Sassy" in
cludes crab cakes. Oh, those sassy crabs. The
"Main Plates" menu features only three cate
gories: water, fire, and earth & air. These
groups make slightly more sense, as they seem
to indicate where their contents come from.
"Water," for example, includes the seafood
dishes. "Earth & air" features both airborne
critters land-based mammals. "Fire" includes
tofu and pasta. (???)
We should also mention that the main
plates range between $ 11.95 (for tofu, because
who wants that?) and $31 (for filet mignon,
because who doesn't want that?). Most
dishes fall between $20 and $25, and inex
) plicably pair foods people want and don't
want. More on that soon.

For starters, Janet had the "Warm Cambo
/.01a," which was essentially a mini-fondue

accompanied by crackers, tomato gar
nish and garlic. All this for only $ 10.50!

(Yikes). We did enjoy it. though; the

garlic came in whole cloves,

which was pretty neat.

The cheese was

lovely, the crackers

were a bit dull.

but. all in all,

the idea was

clever, and the

result was rather

tasty. Ruth ordered
the aforementioned

potstickers, which came
in a tiny frying pan, into
which our waiter poured the
aioli at the last minute, pro
ducing a dramatic bout of
steam. The waiter

blushed
and mut
ter e d ,
"It's sup-

posed to be theatrical. Like Benihana." The
atricality aside, the potstickers were decent:
the soy sauce caramelized onto the unusually
thin dumpling wrapper, which encompassed
the same sort of unidentifiable-but-tasty meat
filling that Jing Jingserves up.
We were a little full when the entrees ar
rived — the appetizers, in keeping with the
California aesthetic, are anxious to please and
of hearty proportions — but we gave the food
the old college try (unlike those wimpy Berke
ley whippersnappers. who are cowards and
girly-men). Janet had the Flat Iron Steak
($24), which came with a "potato brulee"
topped with onion rings, white cheddar and
sour cream. The potato/onion accompani
ment was tasty but artery-stopping. The steak,
which Janet takes medium-rare like any de
cent caveman, was a bit heavily loaded with
peppercorn, but. on the whole, fresh and
pleasantly undercooked.
Ruth pulled from the "Water" menu and
had the ahi tuna on a bed of udon noodles with
mango garnish and veggies ($25), for which
our bashful waiter laid down on the table a sin
gle pair of cheap, disposable chopsticks. It was
anticlimactic. The ahi was as fresh as the steak,
with a light sear around the periphery so as to
minimally damage the fish, and the mango
garnish was tangy without being cloying. The
accompanying noodles, however, were
arranged in a weird salad assortment and
weighed down the dish. Janet chimed in with
the opinion that they were "fast-food-quality
udon noodles," and Janet is from Korea, so
she probably knows about Asian things. The
whole ahi enterprise was served on a triangu
lar plate, just to emphasize the innovative
Asian-ness of this dish. Again, can you see
how this appeals to the elderly? Oh my good
ness. Asia! Asian foods! Do they really eat on
triangular plates there? This fish isn't even
cooked! etc.
We then solicited a dessert menu from our
overly friendly waiter and were tempted by a
range of excellent-sounding options, such as
the warm chocolate truffle cake, pumpkin
cheesecake, and green apple creme hrulee.
The dessert choices range between $5 and
$12.50, and the menu also includes teas,
espresso drinks and some lovely sounding al
coholic espresso drinks that we couldn't
order. Bummer.
We were tempted by all of the delicious,
conventional foods that we know to be deli
cious, but when wc spotted the Poached Bosc
Pear (served with "caramel balsamic gelato.
sweet balsamic reduction") we knew we had
finally found something daring and dangerous
to test our mettle as real men. Here was a story
we could tell the grandchildren, an episode to
persuade our parents that Palo Alto was a rol
lickin' dangerous place.
The pear dish arrived as a fan of sweet
ened. syrup-drenched pear slices topped with
dark brown balsamic reduction, crumbled
peanuts and the mysterious "caramel balsam

ic gelato," which was also drizzled with bal
samic reduction. The dangerous, smoky
sharp flavor of the vinegar still shot through
the reduction, and its übiquity 011 the plate
made eating dessert a time-consuming, unsat
isfying ordeal — not unlike perennially fol
lowing Stanford's football season with

the hope that someday we'll win more
games than we lose. The caramel bal
samic gelato was intriguingly tangy, but
the rest of the unfortunate dish left us
gulping down water. We can blame this
fiasco on the California Cafe's own Chef 112
Bob who, as their website

tells us, worked

his way up

to being

Exec-

utive

Chef
by

tra
vail-
i n g
long

and
hard as a

kitchen
lackey and

"Saucier." We

do not tell a lie. Ruth, too, used to
be saucier, but childbirth reallv takes

that out of a woman.
But wait! We're sup-

posed to end on a spirit
ed. self-congratulatory
note that promotes a ri
valry we care next to
nothing about. OK. what
about this: if Cal's Ameri-

can Football (not to be
confused with futbol) team
is as terrible as the Califor
nia Cafe's pears-with-bal-

samic-reduction, then...
we 11... we might lose by the
low double digits. Go team!
