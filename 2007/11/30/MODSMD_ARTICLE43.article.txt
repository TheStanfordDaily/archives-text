## Do Stanford students outscore cal? 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION RANDY REFEREE 
In the spirit of Big Game,

Roxy has devised a little Cal

vs. Stanford competition of

her own. Below are the most

sexy, shocking and downright

uncomfortable stories that she

could gather from friends on ei-

ther side of the Bay. Roxy ab-

solutely promises that these stories

are true, though the names have

been changed. Read, compare and

decide for yourself who the victor is in

the 2007 Cal vs. Stanford Sex Storv

Swap.

Cal: "We had an orgy to settle a debate.

Brandon. Liz, Josh. Cameron and Robin had

spent the evening smoking weed and watching
'Meet Joe Black." During Brad Pitt's sex scene,

Liz commented that she was almost certainly a

better kisser than Brad Pitt. This led to her
demonstrating on her housemates, which led to her

housematees demonstrating on each other, which
led to everyone waking up naked in the living room

the next morning. Says Josh, "I stopped smoking for a
while after that."

Stanford: "Screw my roommate? Check."
After Screw Your Roommate, freshmen roommates
Julie and Rachel realized that they were attracted to each
other's dates, as well as their own. With the help of a
giant jug of Bacardi, the girls mustered up the courage to

suggest to their dates that the proper end to the evening
would be a group bonding activity in their double. What
was intended as a harmless game of spin the bottle
turned into strip poker, turned into dancing naked to
music videos, turned into Julie, Rachel and their two
dates having an orgy. Says Rachel, "I couldn't ride a bike
the next day."

Cal: "I must have been dangling for 30 seconds."
Joanna was hooking up with her boyfriend. James, in his
lofted bed. Suddenly, the door opened, and James'
roommate entered to see Joanna naked, straddling
James. Joanna tried to quickly cover herself up, and fell
out of the bed in the process. Unfortunately, her leg got
caught in the railing. Says Joanna. "So there I am, naked,
dangling from the railing of his bed. I'm in this incredible
pain, but the roommate's not stepping in because he's
this real quiet, shy type, and I think that sight of a dan
gling naked woman may have thrown him. I eventually
just fell to the floor, but I still have a dent in my leg."
Stanford: "And then 1 heard this terrible pop."
Nadima and Issac decided that it was time to try some
thing new in the sack, so Nadima suggested attempting
the Reverse Cowgirl. Things were just beginning to work,
when Nadima moved a bit too sharply. She heard a pop
ping sound and then Issac screaming. Says Nadima, "We
really thought that I had broken it. Turns out, after going
to the emergency room, that I did."

Cal: "1 really had to go, but I didn't want
to leave her."

Evan had a crush on Jennifer for two years, but she hac
been pretty clear that she wasn't interested. That is, un
junior year, when she agreed to go out on a date with
him. Everything went well at dinner, and Jennifer invit
Evan up to her apartment to hang out afterward. Evan
really had to poop, but he didn't want to leave her bath
room smelly or go home early, so he held it in. And hel
it. And held it. Finally, sitting next to Jennifer on the
couch, looking through her photo album together, Eva
pooped himself. Says Evan, "I couldn't believe what hi
happened. I literally jumped up and ran out of her apai
merit. And she totally knew what had happened. She d
n't tell her friends about it, but she definitely never wer
out with me again."
Stanford: "You disgust me. Never contact me."

John was at a dorm party, drunker than he ought to ha
been, when he met a randon

airl. who was also less

than sober. The girl

roommate was ou
