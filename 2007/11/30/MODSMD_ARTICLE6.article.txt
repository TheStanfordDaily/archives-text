## The 						quest for 50,000 words 
### KELLEY FONG PAGE TWO EDITOR 
112 Hari Rai Kaur Khalsa'l 1 pulled an
all-nighter last night trying to meet a
I deadline, it wasn't to finish her
I HUM or PWR papers: She was
i frantically finishing her novel.
Why the rush?
Each November, frenzied writers participate
in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoW
riMo; Web site at www.nanowrimo.org) and are
declared winners if they complete a 50,0(X) word
(approximately 175-page) novel between Nov. 1
and 30. With its emphasis on taking risks and
producing quantity over quality, the challenge
has taken off, gathering more than 100,000 par
ticipants from 70 countries in this, its ninth year.
"November's honestly my favorite month of
the year." Khalsa said. "I love NaNoWriMo so
much because I love writing so much and I love
that NaNoWriMo is a month that I dedicate en
tirely to writing one story."
Eavan Boland, director of Stanford's Cre
ative Writing Program, said she thought
NaNoWriMo was a festive and interesting proj
ect.
"It must be a major distraction for almost
everyone for the month of November!" she
said. "Fifty-thousand words is a pretty big daily
commitment. For writers who want to focus,
who want the discipline and achievement of
deadlines and want to get fit at writing, this is a
really fun thing to do."
Khalsa''s first taste of NaNoWriMo came two
years ago as a senior in high school. Although
the month was already half over by the time she
found out about the challenge, she wrote 30.000
words by Nov. 30 and resolved to succeed the
following year.
Having deferred her admission to Stanford,
Khalsa was a NaNoWriMo winner in her vear

off and "had a blast," planning
and leading writing sessions for
NaNoWriMo participants in the
Santa Fe area.

On Monday, Khalsa was "way be
hind" with almost 30,000 words but
still aiming for 50,000 by the deadline.

"Last year I crossed the finish line
with an all-nighter.a 12,(XX) word night.so
I figure if I can write 12,000 words in one
day, I can do 20,000 in four," she said. "It's
going to be rough, but I will stay up all night
ITiursday night if 1 have to and all through Fri
day."

"Now I'm honestly taking every single spare
minute of free time and using it," she continued.
"If 1 don't get this story out of me right now in
this month it will never be the same. At this
point, what's motivating me is not that 1 want to
finish the month having done 50,(KX) — it's that
1 feel 1 owe it to the story."
Jane Goldsmith'll participated in NaNoW
riMo for the first time last year, reaching 12.000
words before realizing that her story wasn't
going anywhere. Five days before the deadline,
she had another idea and started over.
"It took two all-nighters and I made myself
ill." she recalled. "I brought my laptop to school
every day, wrote during every little break and
submitted it half an hour before midnight on
Nov. 30."
Naturally,she felt moved to participate again
this year.
"It was crazy and hectic, but periods of in
sane activity [are] when I have the most fun."
she said, adding that NaNoWriMo is one of her
favorite periods of the year.
This year. Goldsmith is teaming up with her
best friend to write a joint novel, a story about a
college in a fantasy world.The duo aims to write
100,000 words between them, and. as of TUesday,
they had just broken 33,000 words.
Former Daily columnist Darren Franich "07,
already declared a NaNoWriMo 2007 winner.

said
ittlo Kit

he felt "a little bit
)f trepidation" as November

negan.
"At the beginning, 1 was like, there's no way 1
can do this," he said. "But once 1 got into a real
ly good rhythm with it — crossing 10,000.
20,000,30,000 — it became more tangible."
Franich said he definitely could not have
done NaNoWriMo successfully while at Stan
ford.
"My attention would have wandered too
quickly," he said. "Especially with the quarter
system, it's so easy to get caught up with every
thing else."
Lyndsay Vogel '10 said she had a big idea —
"something brilliant about a stoplight" — at the
beginning of November, but after a slow start,
she decided it was too much for her to take on
this year.
"NaNoWriMo definitely seems like a better
idea in October than it becomes in November,"
she said, pointing out the huge time commit
ment that such an endeavor requires. "Think
one reasonably sized essay per day — some
thing most college students do in a couple days
spaced over several hours."
After succumbing to college applications
halfway to the 50,000 goal last year, Emma
Ziker' 11 figured she would try it again this fall.
"1 gave up after less than a week because
being a freshman in college is a lot of work," she
said.
"Ultimatelv, I became much more interested

1 n

the novel
than in doing

homework," agreed Emily
Finley 4 10." If I spent half the amount

of time on homework that I did on [the
novel] in the first five days, I would probably be
the greatest student ever."
Killeen Hanson '08 successfully did
NaNoWriMo her senior year of high school and
has attempted the feat each year since. As of
Wednesday, her 2007 piece, a story of adventure
on the high seas, had approximately 12,000
words.
Hanson agreed that NaNoWriMo was defi
nitely harder to accomplish while at Stanford.
"People are torn every which way with a
thousand student groups here, a thousand other
commitments and classes," she said, adding that
the dorm environment can be a huge distrac
tion.
Khalsa agreed that although writing her
novel has been smooth, being at Stanford has
been made this her most challenging year so far.
"I thought it was insane doing it with 12 col
lege applications [my senior year of high
school], hut this is really insane. I'm trying to
write a research paper for PWR and write an
IHUM paper and do my astronomy homework
and write a novel on top of that."
With the advantage of living and working
off-campus. Franich set daily word goals, mostly
upping his word count in a local cafe. "General
ly, I was just an unshaven writer over in the cor
ner of the cafe sipping espressos one after an
other."
Working on his novel, he said, meant sacri
fices and a shift in priorities.

"Right when I really knew I was
going to make the 50.(XX) words. I was
out with some friends at a club,"he re
counted"! wasn't really enjoying my
self that much and I realized it was be
cause I really wanted to work on my
novel.This is like 11:30 p.m.. my friend
has paid for this table with lots of free,
very expensive booze and I'm just
like, "Hey guys, I'm going to go to my
house, turn on some music and see if I
can write a couple pages.'"
Franich hit 50,(MX) on Nov. 25, and
his word count stood at 54,448 two

days later.
How did he feel when he hit the
magic number?
"Awesome. Amazing. 1 was just so
completely excited that day that 1 al
lowed myself not to think about it or
worry about it,"he said. "It really felt
like a milestone. And then the very
next day I started writing again. It felt
like 1 'd moved on to the next level. But
in video games, the next level's always
harder."
For Goldsmith, the beginning of
December is marked bv sadness.

"1 finish and then I feel like I'm
looking for the meaning in my life
again "she said.
What's next for these writers?
They spoke unanimously: editing,
with an eye towards possible publica
tion and participation in NaNoW
riMo2(K)B.
"Unless 1 break all my fingers and
can't type," Goldsmith said, "I'm
going to do it every year that 1 can."
