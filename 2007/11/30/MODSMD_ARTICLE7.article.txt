# Students sound off on popular site FreeRice
## 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA 
Finally getting bored of all those Facebook
applications? Lwking for a new way to "waste"
time? Freeßice.com, a Web site launched last
month that enables users to improve vocabulary
while helping end world hunger, has become ex
tremely popular around campus. Students, how
ever, expressed mixed opinions about the value
of the site.
The site selects a random word from the
10,000 words that founder John Breen entered by
hand. If the user chooses the right definition out
of four possible choices, 20 grains of rice —just
increased from 10 grains this past Wednesday —
are donated to the World Food Programme
(WFP),a U.N. agency.The site monitors the user's
vocabulary level, with each correct guess increas
ing the difficulty level (and each incorrect one
lowering it).

You might think 20 grains is a tiny amount. On
Oct. 7. the day the site was launched.B3o grains of
rice were donated — barely enough for a bowl.
As of press time, more than 4.5 trillion grains of
rice have been donated.
Freeßice was started by hunger and poverty
activist John Breen, who hopes that while users
play the game, at least some will click on the link
to his Web site. Poverty.com, to see what needs to
be done to end poverty.
Marcus Williams'o9, who is spearheading the
Society for International Affairs at Stanford's
Kiva, an initiative to reduce poverty, was excited
to see how quickly the site spread across campus.
"I think it is one of many innovations that
merges the Internet directly with poverty allevia
tion," he said. "It seemed like I heard about it one
minute and then, within a day, everyone was toy
ing around with it."
David Kuo '08, co-Director of Stanford Pro

ject on I lunger, said there is much to be appreci
ated in Freeßice.com.
"It is not the only way to combat hunger on
line. but the novel concept and wide appeal are
encouraging," Kuo said. "Not everyone stops to
think about the global impact of hunger but these
sites can impact the millions who play and be the
new way of informing people of the world hunger
problem."
Nevertheless, many students had not heard of
F reeßice.com. Once asked about it, however,
they quickly became addicts.
"The fact that I'm helping feed people in third
world countries while sitting at my computer
matching up big words is more than terrific." said
Miriam Marks'll.
Revti Gupta '09,0n the other hand.did not see
what the big deal was about,adding that there are
better ways to make use of the Internet to raise
awareness.

"The Web site will he quickly forgotten after
the initial hoopla. The vocah exercise gets really
horing and it will take a lot of time to work up a
donation large enough to make a difference to
enough people ." said Gupta.
While David Delgado '11 said he loves
Freeßice because it is challenging and interest
ing, he had just one question.
"Why rice?" he asked."Rice is not very nutri
tious, especially if processed rice is being used!"
Vinney Le' 11 said he thought Freeßice trivi
alizes the problem of world hunger and discon
nects people from the issue.
"Equating a vocabulary game with feeding
hungry people is sad." he said. "It does not get
them engaged in the actual problem; it does not
raise awareness or make people care. Neverthe
less, it is better than nothing."
