### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the fall of 2005, a group of stu
dents emerged from Human Biology
Prof. Anne Firth Murray's sopho
more seminar on international
women's health and human rights
stunned by what they had learned.
Hie students had considered them
selves reasonably well-informed
about the issues but were "blown
away" by how dire the circumstances
are for some women worldwide and
how little attention has been drawn
to the issues.
Then they decided to do some
thing.
Two years later, their efforts are
being realized in a "BIG" way. Regis
tration kicked off this week for the
think√ülG conference on interna
tional women's heath and human
rights, which is set to be the largest
student-run conference in Stanford
history and will take place Feb. 1-3.
Its organizers do not intend for
the conference to preach to the choir.
They are targeting students regard
less of gender or academic back
ground in an effort to raise aware
ness about the issues lacing women
in the developing world and inspire a
generation to take action.
"We want to get everybody in
volved. from the doctor to the diplo
mat to the check-writers of tomor
row," said conference chair Lee
Trope '08.
TTie conference will focus on four
primary issues: Education,
HIV/AIDS among women, repro
ductive health and violence against
women. Each issue will have a
keynote speaker and two panelists,
boasting a who's who of activists in
the field, including Mary Robinson,
former president of Ireland, and
Stephen Lewis, former UN Special
Envoy for AIDS in Africa.
True to its emphasis on student
activism, the conference will also
have a special opportunities fair to
connect students with classes, sum
mer internships or professional ca
reer options that can affect changes
on the issues discussed.
"We really wanted something
tangible for people to walk away
from the conference with." said Mis
han Araujo '08, the conference's fi
nancial manager.
An eye-opening class
The numbers, they said, were
mind-blowing. T\vo million women at
risk of genital mutilation. One-in
three a victim of domestic violence.
