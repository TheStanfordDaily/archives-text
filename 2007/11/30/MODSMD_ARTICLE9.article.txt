## STUDENT GROUPS Students thinkBIG for event Group plans conference on women's health 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the fall of 2005, a group of stu
dents emerged from Human Biology
Prof. Anne Firth Murray's sopho
more seminar on international
women's health and human rights
stunned by what they had learned.
Hie students had considered them
selves reasonably well-informed
about the issues but were "blown
away" by how dire the circumstances
are for some women worldwide and
how little attention has been drawn
to the issues.
Then they decided to do some
thing.
Two years later, their efforts are
being realized in a "BIG" way. Regis
tration kicked off this week for the
thinkßlG conference on interna
tional women's heath and human
rights, which is set to be the largest
student-run conference in Stanford
history and will take place Feb. 1-3.
Its organizers do not intend for
the conference to preach to the choir.
They are targeting students regard
less of gender or academic back
ground in an effort to raise aware
ness about the issues lacing women
in the developing world and inspire a
generation to take action.
"We want to get everybody in
volved. from the doctor to the diplo
mat to the check-writers of tomor
row," said conference chair Lee
Trope '08.
TTie conference will focus on four
primary issues: Education,
HIV/AIDS among women, repro
ductive health and violence against
women. Each issue will have a
keynote speaker and two panelists,
boasting a who's who of activists in
the field, including Mary Robinson,
former president of Ireland, and
Stephen Lewis, former UN Special
Envoy for AIDS in Africa.
True to its emphasis on student
activism, the conference will also
have a special opportunities fair to
connect students with classes, sum
mer internships or professional ca
reer options that can affect changes
on the issues discussed.
"We really wanted something
tangible for people to walk away
from the conference with." said Mis
han Araujo '08, the conference's fi
nancial manager.
An eye-opening class
The numbers, they said, were
mind-blowing. T\vo million women at
risk of genital mutilation. One-in
three a victim of domestic violence.
Sex trafficking. No hope for an edu
cation.
"I'm the kind of person that reads
the newspaper every day, but 1 was
shocked and blown away by what I
learned in class," Trope said. "It
moved me in a way that no class had
ever moved me before."
For Murray, the statistics had
been startling as well. Before she
began teaching her human biology
seminar on women's health, Murray
founded the Global Fund for
Women and was working as a philan
thropist and consultant on health
and human rights. But when she
began researching for her course,she
decided to talk with women all
across the globe and asked firsthand
what the most important issues that
they faced were.
Their answers, she said, were
shocking.
"Before, much of the literature
focused on women as producers of
babies and women as mothers,"

Murray said. "But only recently has
much of the focus shifted from pub
lic to private spaces and individual
rights."
Murray designed her course
around the key issues she gleaned
from her conversations: male birth
preference, poverty, unequal access
to education, food and health care
and violence against women. Also in
cluded was an emphasis on activism,
channeling the outrage from learn
ing about the issues into making pos
itive changes. Along with think BIG,
her course has been the impetus be
hind student organizations like Pro
moting Women's Health and Human
Rights (PWHHR).
'it was upsetting for me that we
could be at Stanford, aware and edu
cated, and not have a grasp on these
issues," Araujo said. "But I realized
you don't have to dedicate your life
to this to make a difference."
Thinking IlKi
The event's organizers are stress
ing that a little change can go a long
way and are aiming to spread their
message as widely as possible.
"It costs a little but has huge
value," Araujo said of funding
women's education.
"It became really clear that this is
something than can be fixed."
Part of spreading that message is
reaching out to the opposite sex. A
conference on women's health is not
always initially inviting to men, ad
mitted marketing director Tessa
Watt *08.
"Would I go to a conference on
men's health?" she asked. "I'm not

so sure. But it's meant for men, too."
"You say it's a conference on
women's international health and
men don't think it applies to them,"
Araujo added. "We're working to
change that."
Critical to that end is understand
ing that women's health affects glob
al health and that educating women
and bringing them into the formal
economy can help developing na
tions move out of the cycle of pover
ty, Araujo explained.
Along with pink and blue t-shirts
as incentives, the group has offered a
pizza party to the dorm with the
highest percentage of participants.
They also have found corporate
sponsors willing to make a $ I () dona
tion to women's heath organizations
for each registered participant.
"It's not just coming to learn, it's
coming to give back," Trope said of
attending the conference.
As the largest student-run confer
ence in Stanford history. thinkßlG
has a budget of $100,000 and aims to
register 500 participants, with capac
ity increasing to 1.000 for bigger
events like the keynote speech,
which will take place in Memorial
Auditorium.
Fundraising has been the most
difficult part of planning the event,
and logistics have been daunting at
times.
"I've learned more about the
University than anything else."
Trope said of the planning process.
But the conference has been
sponsored by a number of offices in
the administration and several aca
demic departments. and the Stanford

brand has been instrumental in se
curing corporate sponsorships,
fundraising director Karen Jacobson
"08 said.
The organizers have been able to
follow the path blazed by past major
projects like Dance Marathon and
FACE AIDS, but according to its
founders. thinkßlG has rewritten
the book on event planning in many
respects.
"Nanci Howe said anyone want
ing to do something like this in the
future is going to have to 'think
small,'" said Trope, who thanked
J lowe and the Office of Student Ac
tivities for helping the group navi
gate through the often-daunting
University bureaucracy.
While they expressed great ex
pectations for thinkßlG, the organ
izers admitted that devoting so much
time, money and energy into a con
ference required a measure of faith
that theirs was the most important
task at hand.
" 11's a hard thing for us on a moral
level," Araujo said. "What else can
be done with that money? That's
something we've had a hard time
with."
"And we hope and know that it's
worth it,"Trope added.
Registration for thinkßlG con
tinues today in White Plaza and is
free for Stanford students, $15 for
other students or seniors and $25 for
the general public. For more infor
mation. visit http://thinkbig.stan
