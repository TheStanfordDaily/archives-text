/ , ,112 ome people see their contribution as being
a fireman, while others may see it as being
a nurse, or a full-time parent, or business
112 ..J entrepreneur. We all have our own vision."
For Savannah Lengsfelder 04, that vision lies in pub
lic policy, which she pursues through her position as a
Legislative Assistant for Africa and global health policy
in the Senate.
"It's not terribly glamorous," she said, mentioning
long days, black suits, cubicles and little recognition. "But
there are perks — C-SPAN appearances, receptions with
celebrities and meetings with world leaders."
Working closely with NGOs. think tanks and lawyers,
she helps draft legislation and authorize and oversee the
use of U.S. funds. And while she can't name-drop on the
record, she's corresponded with African leaders as well as
prominent Cabinet members.
"For years. I'd watch the 'Save the Children' commer
cials or read about Darfur and just feel so helpless," she
said.
"| While at Stanford) I went with Volunteers in Latin
America to a children's shelter in Quito, [Ecuador] and it
just broke my heart. No matter how hard I worked, I was
n't going to make any difference in these children's lives."
That's what motivates Lengsfelder to put in 45 to 55
hours a week drafting relatively obscure policy.
"It's so wonderful when you see something that
you've worked on become law, or when you see U.S. dol
lars saving millions of lives or when a statement you
wrote makes the front page of African newspapers," she
said.
The job involves a delicate dance with the realities of
bureaucracy and politics.
"You're limited by political realities, and I think that's
true of any political position," Lengsfelder said. "This is
the administration that we have — we have to work with
them, and we have to respect their priorities and con
straints. but that doesn't mean we ever stop raising our
own concerns and proposing solutions."
An international relations major with minors in eco
nomics, Latin American studies, Spanish and Por
tuguese. Lengsfelder has been familiar with
Washington. DC.. since her Stanford days. As
a freshman, she fell in love with economics in
Economics Prof. John Taylor's Econ 1 class;
after he was appointed Under Secretary of the
TVeasury, she worked for a quarter at the U.S.
Treasury Department upon his invitation.

Nonetheless, Lengsfelder did not always know that
she would be involved with Africa.
"I thought I was going to work on promoting develop
ment in Latin America, as I had a very Western Hemi
sphere focus until I was 20 years old," she said.
Upon graduation, Lengsfelder was unsure about her
next steps. But she wanted to explore international
human rights law and development policy, and her plans
crystallized when she spent the summer on a Haas Cen
ter fellowship with the Center for Human Rights in Pre
toria, South Africa,
"I didn't know anything about Africa," she said. "But l
Stanford really gives you access to incredible opportu- J
nities and options, so I had mentors who got me smart J
on Africa very quickly. I fell in love with South Africa, m
1 felt like this was a part of the world where the Unit
ed States has a role to play."
Afterwards, Lengsfelder studied international J||
development issues in England for a Masters de- r \
i c ' r 1 : i -* L'

gree before taking a Congressional internship.
"1 was actually quite sure I didn't want to
work on the Hill, but the fellowship was just

six months, so I thought/How bad could i
be?'" she said."But I fell in love with life

on the Hill — I caught the bug.

here — there's incredible energy, so
many opportunities and so many
people who share my objectives,"
she said.
So though Lengsfelder is eager to
go to law school to pursue human
rights law, she's also a bit regretful
about leaving the Hill.
"It would be hard for me not to be
in D.C.,"she said."But there are peo
ple who share these passions and
goals all over the world and in all
walks of life, so I'm not too worried."

Ultimately, Lengsfelder wants to
open a school for underprivileged
girls, a dream she and her sister have
shared since Lengsfelder was four
years old.
"We want to promote diversity
and tolerance by taking advantage of
international cultures and perspec
tives," she said. "We were raised by
more or less stay-at-home parents,
which is the greatest blessing any
child can receive, and we'd like to
create an environment in which girls
can be nurtured and empowered by
strong role models."
She also reflects fondly upon her
Stanford years, which were filled
with fountain hopping. Kappa Alpha
Theta and the predecessor of Habla.

"What Stanford epitomized for
me was the work-play balance, and
that's something 1 don't see in D.C.,"
Lengsfelder said. "1 remember com
ing home from an exam, hopping
into the shower and then putting on
a dress to go to a party. Ilie transi
tions were seamless, whereas now 1
feel like I'm constantly forced to
choose between the two. I have great
memories of late-night study ses
sions and theme parties that were
often on the same night. That really
made the University unique."

Afterwards, Lengsfelder studied international J||

"1 was actually quite sure I didn't want to
work on the Hill, but the fellowship was just

six months, so I thought/How bad could i

The bug?

here — there's incredible energy, so
many opportunities and so many
people who share my objectives,"
she said.
So though Lengsfelder is eager to
go to law school to pursue human
rights law, she's also a bit regretful
about leaving the Hill.
"It would be hard for me not to be
in D.C.,"she said."But there are peo
ple who share these passions and
goals all over the world and in all
walks of life, so I'm not too worried."

Ultimately, Lengsfelder wants to
open a school for underprivileged
girls, a dream she and her sister have
shared since Lengsfelder was four
years old.
"We want to promote diversity
and tolerance by taking advantage of
international cultures and perspec
tives," she said. "We were raised by
more or less stay-at-home parents,
which is the greatest blessing any
child can receive, and we'd like to
create an environment in which girls
can be nurtured and empowered by
strong role models."
She also reflects fondly upon her
Stanford years, which were filled
with fountain hopping. Kappa Alpha
Theta and the predecessor of Habla.

"What Stanford epitomized for
me was the work-play balance, and
that's something 1 don't see in D.C.,"
Lengsfelder said. "1 remember com
ing home from an exam, hopping
into the shower and then putting on
a dress to go to a party. Ilie transi
tions were seamless, whereas now 1
feel like I'm constantly forced to
choose between the two. I have great
memories of late-night study ses
sions and theme parties that were
often on the same night. That really
made the University unique."
Touche. Fellow fountain hoppers:
work on, party on.
