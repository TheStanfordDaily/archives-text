# Kerosene at 30,000 feet?
## Holidays flights not "most wonderful time" for carbon emissions 
### KT MERTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's that most wonderful time of year again, when far-flung
families travel thousands of miles to reunite for the two
biggest American holidays. The Air Transport Association
predicts that over 35 million people, including a substantial
number of undergraduate students, will fly home for the holi
days this December.
Unfortunately, long-distance flights — even for the laud
able motives of merrymaking and family togetherness — can
have serious environmental consequences. Airplanes emit
carbon just as cars do, and in relatively similar amounts: small
cars generate about 0.5 pounds of carbon dioxide per person
per mile, while commercial aircraft produce around 0.6
pounds of CO2 a pop.
But planes also emit nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, soot
and water vapor. When released into the upper atmosphere,
these gases and particles can have a drastically greater warm
ing effect than they would if released from the ground.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from aircraft can deplete ozone
gases, increasing the amount of ultraviolet light that reaches
the Earth's surface, hence affecting climate. Sulfur and soot
particles discharged in midair form contrails, the long white
clouds that frequently mark an airplane's path. Contrails also
affect atmospheric chemistry in a way that leads to cli
mate warming.
It's impossible to separate out just those chemi
cals emitted by airplanes, but the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change estimates that air travel gen
erates approximately 3.5 percent of the radiative forcing
— a measure of climate impact — produced by all human ac
tivities. In addition, aircraft emissions increase nitrogen ox
ides and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by six percent
more than would occur naturally.
Three percent, six percent — these numbers may not
seem like much, but air travel is an area in which one per
son's decision can make a big difference. Choosing an alter
nate mode of transportation — like trains, which typically
run on electricity and diesel — could reduce carbon emis
sions by the amount an SUV generates in a whole month.
The rapidly expanding carbon offset market offers anoth
er alternative. Online services like Atmosfair calculate the
dollar amount required to "offset" the emissions generated by
a particular flight. Air travelers can then use this information
to mitigate their share of anthropogenic emissions.
Investing in tropical forest conservation is a good way for
environmentally conscious flyers to get maximum bang for
their mitigation buck. A recent Science study found that trop
ical forests are capable of storing roughly 30 percent more car
bon than temperate forests, making tropical trees one of the
largest carbon sinks on the planet. (Don't get fooled by "plant
a tree"schemes, though: Tropical forests are a special case, and
trees planted in low-diversity, large-scale plantations will

probably not have the same beneficial effect.)
Some airlines have even gotten in on the mitigation action.
Delta offers passengers the option to offset their emissions by
donating to the Conservation Fund's "Go Zero" program, and
Virgin Blue forwards its passenger mitigation fees to abate
ment projects approved by the Australian Greenhouse Office.
Though fuel economy has improved dramatically over the
years, we can't count on technology to supply an environmen
tally friendly superjet anytime soon. Airline manufacturers
are experimenting with biodiesels but have yet to dis-

cover anything that performs as well as kerosene
in the chilly temperatures at 30,000 feet. For the
near future, at least, frequent tliers can best

soften their emission impact by sharing
some holiday joy with a tropical Christmas
tree.
