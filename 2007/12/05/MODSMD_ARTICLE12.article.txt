## Editorial Board CourseRank will be a long overdue success 
### 
As of yesterday, Stanford students have
entered a new era of course selection.
Gone are the days when students had
only the user-unfriendly Axess Web site or er
ratic advice from whatever upperclassmen
they could find to rely on in making critical
course selection decisions. Now, students can
plan out their weekly schedule, construct a
four-year plan, track their GERs and access
official evaluation information from other
students all in one place: http://courserank.
stanford.edu.
Stanford is finally catching up to its peer
institutions like Harvard and Yale that have
made course evaluation information publicly
available for years. Harvard's famous CUE
guide is perhaps the most established, having
existed for almost 30 years in its present for
mat. Delivered in printed form to undergrad
uates in their dorm rooms and made available
online, the CUE guide offers student rank
ings of difficulty, workload and satisfaction
with each of the courses at the University, as
well as qualitative comments about profes
sors and classes.
Yale has an Online Course Selection ap
plication that has similar information avail
able to its students, accessible in the same
Web site where students officially register for
classes in the upcoming term. These estab
lished and widely consulted sources are bol
stered by high rates of response on student
evaluations at these universities — a recent
Harvard Crimson article pegged Harvard's
response rate at 84 percent and put Yale's in
the mid 90s. Stanford's response rate is simi
larly high ever since the institution of online
evaluations last year, but, until now, the
wealth of information culled from this
process has only been available to professors
and administrators.
The beauty of Courseßank is that its de
velopers, in conjunction with the ASSU, were
able to obtain the quantitative information
from student evaluations to incorporate into
their Web site. Now Stanford students can go
online and see how a certain TA or professor
scored on a very good/good/fair/poor/very
poor continuum regarding all the topics stu
dents are quizzed on in their quarterly evalu

ations. Also provided by the Registrar's office
were composite averages of how many hours
per week students spent working on a class
and what grade they expected to receive.
The administration was unwilling to re
lease the qualitative comments that students
complete as part of the evaluations, hut this
exclusion is not too big a loss, especially con
sidering that students will be able to post their
own comments on Courseßank regarding
classes and professors.
Administrators are understandably con
cerned about the inevitable fraction of com
ments that stop short of informed and in
formative critique of curricula or faculty and
instead stoop to personal insults that include
vulgarities or worse.'lTiis is an obvious source
of anxiety for faculty, but a compromise has
been put in place that should police the site
fairly. Students or faculty surfing the site can
"report" questionable comments that will be
reviewed by the ASSU, and insubstantial
comments and ad hominem attacks will be
deleted.
This system should be a good way for stu
dents with previously few informal channels
of information about courses to have access
to dozens of comments and ratings that can il
luminate their choices. It will also be an easy
to-use way to plan a schedule and avoid those
pesky time conflicts between classes.This site
is a victory not only for eager students who
hunt through the Bulletin for the best classes,
but also for University Registrar Thomas
Black, who said he hopes that, down the line,
even more useful components like syllabi and
major requirements will be included.
It is also a reminder of the limitless pos
sibilities and talents of the Stanford student
population. Courseßank was not built by
professional Web developers hired by the
administration, but by three members of the
class of 2009 who started work on the site in
CS 194, a class mainly intended for seniors
developing software projects. Stanford has
long suffered with the substandard Axess
software, but, as the alma mater of preco
cious software geniuses all over Silicon Val-
