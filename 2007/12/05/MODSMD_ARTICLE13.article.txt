## The
						saner side of the fringe

As Stuart Baimel and Gabe Winant
observed in recent Daily columns
("Ron Paul is insane," Nov. 14;" R
emember. remember every other day of the
year," Nov. 9], stupid people play a distress
ingly prominent role in American electoral
discourse. However you define them, Jon
Stewart and Stephen Colbert each owe a
sizeable chunk of their careers to these id
iots and the cacophonous, pseudo-rational
blather they so ably promulgate. But if
America's political betes noires exist in
numbers large enough to inspire such point
ed satire, have they coalesced around a par
ticular candidate?
According to Baimel, they have. He be
lieves that a small horde of "disaffected
young white males wanting to stick it to the
Man" have misguidedly sold their souls to
the United States of Ron Paul. Across the
country, they angrily wave placards and post
YouTUbe videos in complete ignorance of
the fact that their candidate has gone utter
ly bonkers. Have these yobbish morons
thought at all about the "Ron Paullian
dystopia" they so actively promote? Clearly
not.
Winant offered a similarly dismal diag
nosis. "Caught up in the fun of a political in
surgency." he argues, "the Paul people are
mistaking their own excitement for the sub
stance of a real, broad-based political move
ment." In place of said movement, a radical
izing, libertarian bogeyman has exploited
their self-absorption and brainwashed them
into enlisting in a war against the American
government. Thankfully, however, Winant
understands these poor bastards better than
they understand themselves. "Deep down,"
he declares, "they must know that [Paul's]
message is not a universal one."
These generalized and rather arrogant
psycho-profiles of Paul's supporters wrong
ly and condescendingly equate his libertari
an politics with blind irrationality. While
Baimel and Winant may disagree with
Paul's ideas, they should acknowledge that
intelligent voters can and have produced ra
tional. policy-driven reasons to support
Paul. Other voters may legitimately dispute
these reasons, but the suggestion that Paul's
adherents have altogether neglected their
political homework unfairly trivializes their
views. Indeed, the suggestion that libertari
anism is essentially an uncritical, quasi-psy

chopathic dogma amounts to an intellectu
ally lazy form of political name-calling.
Paul's foreign policy, for example, relies
on more than a vaguely articulated disdain
for all things federal. It centers on the debat
able but thoroughly rational notion that
America's footprint abroad has become
bloated, in Iraq and elsewhere, to the point
of jeopardizing our national interests. Paul
instead imagines a world in which the
American government exercises humble,
constructive and fundamentally limited in
fluence in building global safety and pros
perity Paul is not an isolationist. As he artic
ulated in a 2006 floor speech entitled "Dia
logue Is Key to Dealing with Iran," diplo
macy should serve as the primary means by
which the U.S. pursues its goals abroad.
The guiding principle of Paul's domestic
agenda involves the trite but easily defend
able idea that the federal government
should play as small a role as practically
possible in American society. Paul's stances
on property rights, civil liberties and fiscal
issues fit neatly and logically into this
framework. In Paul's view, some of Wash
ington's most pressing duties include tasks
such as enforcing its nation's borders, up
holding the Constitution and (shocking
though it may sound) promoting sustain
able energy with tax credits.
Safe to say that this brutally reduced
summary of Paul's ideas is at least as
grounded in rationality as, say, Hillary Clin
ton's muddled stance on Iraq. More impor
tantly. however, a number of mainstream
American thinkers have begun picking up
on the rational side of Paul's message. For
example, George F. Will, the bow-tied
Pulitzer prize-winner, quietly and articu
lately praised Paul in his Newsweek col
umn, "The Last Word."
It's obvious, of course, that the Paul cam
paign has enlisted its fair share of kooks. In
spite of the fortune it produced, the Fifth of
November fundraiser may (understand
ably) have damaged libertarianism's image
among mainstream American voters be
yond immediate repair. Moreover, like
many of my fellow Paul-supporters, I don't
personally agree with every aspect of my
candidate's agenda.There remain, however,
two important points that Baimel and
