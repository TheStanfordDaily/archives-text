# Students Illustrated
## Taming technology 
### 
John describes himself as "technology
stressed."At the beginning of this year,
after spending 15 months in a Zambian
refugee camp, John's biggest apprehension
was about his ability to re-immerse himself in
the frantic, digital world of college life. I le re
membered the incessant emails, the Power-
Point slides and the ringing cell phones dur
ing lecture. However, the smiling faces from
his refugee camp (many of whom had never
seen an email, or even knew how to write)
still played on the film reel of his mind.
Knowing their happiness even in the absence
of technology gave John hope that his return
to Stanford could be defined by finding the
right balance of the digital and the off-line.
Arriving back on campus. John discov
ered that student life's inundation with tech
nology had increased during his absence. So
why did John feel uncomfortable? Technolo
gy enables...right?
Instead, day after day. John sat in French
class as slides passed by too quickly for note
taking/'Don't worry about taking notes," the
professor said. "I'll post everything online
after class." Buzzers prone to malfunctions
replaced raised hands in his economics class,
and more students were noticeably disen

gaged (noticeable if one were to stand in the
back of the lecture hall and observe all the
open Facebook and New York Times brows
er windows on laptop screens).
John isn't learning in class anymore, and
he blames technology. In order to pass his
classes. John must interact with the material
he is trying to learn by copiously annotating
textbook margins. Instead of flashing a dia
gram briefly across a screen, he wishes that
professors would spend class time drawing
and explaining the information rather than
deferring students to Coursework after class.
It seems as if technology has allowed pro
fessors to become increasingly disconnected
from their students, and vice versa.
Technology's hindrance to the ideal edu
cational experience is just one example of

the increasing anonymity and separation
caused by our digital world. The corner
store of yesteryear (a location that often
served as an informal community center)
has been replaced by virtual marketplaces
and automated transactions. And people
aren't just distanced from others; they can
even become removed from themselves.
John recalls a recent visit with his high
school librarian who spoke glowingly of her
"digital self" on Second Life, where this
middle-aged woman with generous curves
parades as a skinny blonde perpetually
wearing a pink bikini.
John also notes a disconnect between tech
nology and the awareness of its consumption.
For instance, if a computer is left on idle (let's
just say after watching "An Inconvenient
Truth." for the purpose of illustration),people
rarely think about the coal being burnt to
power that computer while it's inactive. As an
other example, technology has afforded us the
ability to make abundant use of paper cups
and plastic utensils.yet I know I never think of
how many inches of waste I've added to the
local dump due to my careless use of dispos-

able materials at the many Stanford
picnics I've attended. However. John
does think about these things. After
spending more than a year in Africa,
John constantly thinks about every
thing he uses and where it comes
from. The lack of technology at the
refugee camp forced John to feel the
weight of his water as he carried it
from the well and to see his own
garbage in the trash pit in his back
yard. Back in America, I take for
granted my automatic plumbing and
Monday curbside trash pickups.Tech
nological advances have distanced
consumers from their consumption.
Ultimately, this column doesn't
intend to slander technology or di
minish its benefits â€” my intention
is to increase readers' awareness of
how technology affects themselves,
the people around them and the
world at large, in spite of how diffi

cult it may be to think about the big
ger picture. It's much easier to turn
on a light switch than to think about
dams and nuclear power plants, and
it's much easier to create a bad Pow
erPoint slide than it is to think about
how well its viewers may be inter
acting with the material presented.
John assured me that he does not
feel like a victim of technology. He rec
ognizes that technology aids his life,
and the lives of others, in many fantas
tic ways. However, he realizes that
some people can be victimized by
technology through its careless mis
use. In an effort to avoid this, John es
tablishes boundaries on the role that
technology plays in his life. Sometimes
he allows his cell phone battery to sim
ply run down, and when we met for
coffee, he brought his own reusable
mug. And as John's mind continues to
reacclimate to the American lifestyle,
he holds tightly to the lessons of his
Zambian experience.
