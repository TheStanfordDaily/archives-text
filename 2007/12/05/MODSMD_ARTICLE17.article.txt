# The Lowly Interns
## Luck creation 
### 
Disbelief melted into euphoria in our
small TV room in the Stanford in
Washington house. I jealously
watched everyone hack on campus rush the
field and half-listened to the seniors around
me complain that on the only occasion in
their Stanford careers that we win the Big
Game, they are away. But as the Versus
channel (which broadcast the game) started
rolling the credits and we began preparing to
run through downtown D.C. with Stanford
"S"s painted on our chests. I couldn't stop
thinking about luck. There is no better evi
dence that you can make your own luck than
Big Game 2007.
It would be a lie to say the game was pret
ty or that Stanford dominated from start to
finish. Stanford's missed tackles mounted
like the "accidentally" incorrect statistics
that Rudy Guiliani keeps citing in debates
(Zing!). We missed a short field goal and
fumbled when we were within reach of run
ning out the clock. We negated Cal's incom
plete pass on 4th-and-l 1 with 2:15 left in the

game with a silly offsides penalty.
So we missed a lot. but we won because
we were ready to exploit any break.
"You don't deserve anything in Division I
â€” you've got to go get it," senior receiver
Evan Moore told reporters afterward, and it
became apparent that coach Jim Harbaugh's
"enthusiasm unknown to mankind" might
have transferred to his players.
Was it lucky that Cal absolutely wrecked
itself with penalties? Maybe, but we mini
mized our own and made use of the free
yardage. Was it lucky that Nick Sanchez
slipped and fell on his coverage, only to find
an interception plopped in his lap? Maybe.

but Clinton Snyder's pressure on the quar
terback prompted the bad throw, and
Sanchez had the presence to react. Was it
lucky that three very close overhead reviews
went our way? Well, actually, yes. Trust me.
after seeing the replays in MIX those officials
will not be working a BCS game anytime
soon.
The point is that luck doesn't just happen.
E : .ven on the calls that Cal will no doubt gripe
about for ages, we had to make plays to get
to that position (or come close enough that
it looked like we made them). Cal didn't
have the mindset to let themselves get lucky,
and it showed.
In a feat of brilliant cinematography. Ver
sus kept cutting to views of our ever opti
mistic Axe Committee staring down their
Cal counterparts. The two guys from Cal ac
tually in charge of holding the Axe looked
miserable, even when the Bears were down
only one touchdown with most of the fourth
