# The 						Lowly Interns
## Luck creation 
### 
Disbelief melted into euphoria in our
small TV room in the Stanford in
Washington house. I jealously
watched everyone hack on campus rush the
field and half-listened to the seniors around
me complain that on the only occasion in
their Stanford careers that we win the Big
Game, they are away. But as the Versus
channel (which broadcast the game) started
rolling the credits and we began preparing to
run through downtown D.C. with Stanford
"S"s painted on our chests. I couldn't stop
thinking about luck. There is no better evi
dence that you can make your own luck than
Big Game 2007.
It would be a lie to say the game was pret
ty or that Stanford dominated from start to
finish. Stanford's missed tackles mounted
like the "accidentally" incorrect statistics
that Rudy Guiliani keeps citing in debates
(Zing!). We missed a short field goal and
fumbled when we were within reach of run
ning out the clock. We negated Cal's incom
plete pass on 4th-and-l 1 with 2:15 left in the

game with a silly offsides penalty.
So we missed a lot. but we won because
we were ready to exploit any break.
"You don't deserve anything in Division I
â€” you've got to go get it," senior receiver
Evan Moore told reporters afterward, and it
became apparent that coach Jim Harbaugh's
"enthusiasm unknown to mankind" might
have transferred to his players.
Was it lucky that Cal absolutely wrecked
itself with penalties? Maybe, but we mini
mized our own and made use of the free
yardage. Was it lucky that Nick Sanchez
slipped and fell on his coverage, only to find
an interception plopped in his lap? Maybe.

but Clinton Snyder's pressure on the quar
terback prompted the bad throw, and
Sanchez had the presence to react. Was it
lucky that three very close overhead reviews
went our way? Well, actually, yes. Trust me.
after seeing the replays in MIX those officials
will not be working a BCS game anytime
soon.
The point is that luck doesn't just happen.
E : .ven on the calls that Cal will no doubt gripe
about for ages, we had to make plays to get
to that position (or come close enough that
it looked like we made them). Cal didn't
have the mindset to let themselves get lucky,
and it showed.
In a feat of brilliant cinematography. Ver
sus kept cutting to views of our ever opti
mistic Axe Committee staring down their
Cal counterparts. The two guys from Cal ac
tually in charge of holding the Axe looked
miserable, even when the Bears were down
only one touchdown with most of the fourth

quarter remaining. Would 1 still have
had faith if Stanford were down in
that situation? I'd like to think so,
and I'm positive the Axe Committee
would have.
About the same time, another
shot showed a Cal lineman sitting on
the bench with tears in his eyes, and
as far as I could tell he wasn't in
jured. There's nothing wrong with
crying, even if you're a macho foot
ball player, but the game wasn't
even over yet, and far from decided.
And this is where a life lesson can be
repeated. How are you ever going to
succeed if you've already resigned
yourself to failure? Cal was re
signed, and Stanford stayed tough,
even when things weren't going
well.
Karma could also be a factor. An
other visual you missed if you didn't
see the game on Versus was a Cal re

ceiver absolutely decking a camera
man as he ran out of bounds with
about five minutes left. The camera
man was hit so hard he actually
bounced off the ground, but from the
10 or more replays we got to see of
the hit, there was no apology. A Cal
player could have at least helped him
up. Meanwhile, one Versus announc
er decided to let the audience know
during a picturesque view of the
Band (trombone player wearing a
speedo) that "Cal has a band, Stan
ford has kids holding instruments."
Thank you. Versus.That must be why
we call them "The Stanford Kids
Holding Instruments."The unneces
sary jibe, without even mentioning
our Band's unique history of awe
someness (perhaps because there
were so many replays of "The Play")
created a righteous anger that I am
sure transferred somehow across the
country and to our players.
So, did we win Big Game because
we got lucky? Hell no. Thomas Jef
ferson once said, "I'm a firm believ
er in luck, and 1 find the harder 1
work, the more I have of it." Stan

ford football made its own luck, and
those guys, like all our athletes, work
ridiculously hard to play their sport
and keep up in class. Everyone con
tributed. The players who made the
big plays, the backups, the guys who
are injured and even someone like
linebacker Fred Campbell who had
to retire from football after an injury
in the first game of the year.They all
deserve every microsecond of the
resulting glory.
For two sweet games this year,
Stanford Football was a luck creation
machine. Hopefully, next year we ll
stay tougher longer and get to the
bowl game we already have the po
tential to earn. Life, like Big Game
2007, is about seizing the chances that
come your way. You have to be ready
for opportunities, you have to go out
and make them, and you have to be
ready to find the positives.
