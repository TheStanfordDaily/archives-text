# Little Ms. Modern
## The 						no-cell-phone solution 
### 
Back in the reckless days of freshman
year, my (now very responsible)
friend Carly once snipped her cell
phone charger's cord with scissors in a bout
of drunken curiosity. This earned her big
creativity points in the crazy-things-done
while-intoxicated competition, but it also
left her with an inconveniently sobering
problem: cell-phonelessness.
Poor Carly. The panicky situation ensu
ing from a sudden cell phone outage is a fa
miliar experience for many of us: the frantic
mass emails alerting the world of our un
availability. the constant itchiness to check
voicemail through other people's phones,
the grim anguish of text message withdraw
al. And. of course, there is the gradual, sick
ening realization that the tool that would
best remedy our deplorable situation is oh
so-ironically our cell phone itself.
Sometimes, when this happens to me. my
frenzy grows so uncontrollably intense that
it momentarily self-annihilates into a nir
vana-like state of internal reflection. Sud
denly calm (and without incoming text mes
sages to distract me), I find myself contem
plating life's biggest questions. For example,
"How on earth did people survive before
cell phones?"
Or that's how things used to be. But then
last spring, everything changed: 1 started
dating the only 24-year-old left on the plan
et who still doesn't have a cell phone at all!
Mind-blowing, huh? At first, 1 had my
doubts, but soon I found Martijn's refusal to
conform to societal expectations of accessi
bility rugged, exciting and even romantic. 1
wondered how we would manage to find
each other on weekends. Martijn explained
that we would agree on a time and place to
meet, and then each be present at that time
and place. ("So that's what dates are!" I
gushed to my friends.) I wondered how 1
would let him know when 1 had arrived at
his house to visit. Martijn explained that 1
should ring the doorbell.
I was enamored. Our relationship had all
the spontaneity and uncertainty that I'd
been missing out on in my previous cell
phone-glued-to-ear boyfriend experiences.
I didn't need to know what he was doing at
every moment, and he didn't expect me to
be constantly available, either. Sometimes 1
couldn't reach him when I wanted to chat,
but these moments of temporary disap
pointment helped stave off those notorious
ly destructive pangs of clinginess. And they
were more than worth the freedom of un
availability that I was granted in return —
Martijn could call my cell phone from
Skype or a land line, but I was certainly not
obligated to answer.
About a month in. Martijn made a joke
via instant message that startled me:"Well if
you can't find me, you can always call me on
my new cell phone." "!!!!!!" 1 replied, ex
pressing my shock in the eloquent poetry of
Internet shorthand. He was jay-kaying, to
my great relief. "I like that you don't have a
cell phone," I murmured happily into the
chat window."l like that you like that 1 don't
have a cell phone," he cooed back across cy
berspace. (Yes, barf-y, I know.)
I quickly learned, however, that not
everyone liked that Martijn didn't have a
cell phone. Our mutual friends detested the
situation, actually. Martijn's on-the-go un
availability made fluid socializing difficult

and last-minute changes to plans impossi
ble. Additionally, my boyfriend's previous
paramours had apparently expected his
friends and roommates to provide a Marti
jn-messaging service when he couldn't be
reached. These friends and roommates
made it quite clear to me that they did not,
in fact,offer this service. And as soon as they
thought I had some influence, they began
their incessant appeals for me to convert
Martijn to 21st-century connectedness.
I resisted their appeals for the most
part, to the disappointment of everyone
but Martijn. While I empathized with their
frustration (and yes, shared it sometimes),
I admired my boyfriend's conviction too
much to try to persuade him to abandon it.
And through the success of our relation
ship. I had stumbled upon an important
axiom of modern dating that 1 didn't want
to risk flouting: too much communication
is bad.
TTiis axiom might seem like the opposite
of conventional wisdom, which dictates
openness and expressiveness between part
ners for relationship health. I don't disagree
with this advice — much of the fun of dating
derives from forcing one's partner to share
in one's emotional trauma! However, I
think we tend to be over-enthusiastic in our
application of this concept. Because the
modern world makes such an abundance of
communicative venues available, we have
come to expect everyone in a state of con
stant connectedness that becomes superfi
cial in its übiquity. There are countless con
versations, but they all degrade to "What's
up?" "Not much." These interactions offer
little enrichment but can cause plenty of
harm if one such mundane message goes
unanswered.
As communication cheapens in its infi
nite availability, genuine connection ironi
cally becomes more and more difficult. As a
result, the members of our network-ob
sessed society grow increasingly alienated
from each other. And so while it seems
painfully old-fashioned, the no-cell-phone
solution might actually be an astutely mod
ern response to our present predicament of
communication overload.
Rejecting the cell phone requires us to
acknowledge and confront the bewildering
loneliness that results from over-connection
and to shift the focus of how we engage with
our fellow humans from surface breadth to
meaningful depth. Of course, rejecting the
cell phone is also extremely inconvenient.
As long as we're cognizant, however, I don't
think complete rejection is necessary to
make this crucial shift. So good news, Marti
jn: if you do ever feel like getting a cell
phone (and calling me on it), 1 think I could
probably cope.

Caitlin doesn't mind communication over
loud if it's from you, so feel free to email her:
