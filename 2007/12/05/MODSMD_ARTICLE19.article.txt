## If Obama wins Iowa, will the dominos fall? 
### 
Senator Hillary Clinton's aura of in
evitability has begun to wear off.
After leading in national polls by 25
percent in the late summer and early fall,
her poll numbers have begun to drop, and
Senator Barack Obama's have begun to
increase.
Clinton's decline is most readily appar
ent in lowa — her leads in New Hampshire
and South Carolina are still in the double
digits. Polls in lowa have shown her lead,
which was once about seven points, now
dwindling to nothing, as both Obama and
Edwards pull into a statistical dead heat
with her. Some polls have even show
Obama in front. As the nation's first state to
vote (never mind absentee voters in Flori
da, California and elsewhere receiving their
ballots a few days earlier). lowa has consid
erable sway in shaping the rest of the cam
paign. It is true that some wackos—Pat
Buchanan among them — have won lowa
in the past without going on to make waves
in the rest of the campaign. But in this day
and age, with a constant media news cycle,
lowans are now viewed as the kingmakers.
The sight of presidential candidates from
New York City pandering to lowa farmers
wanting to keep ethanol highly and outra
geously subsidized is uniquely American
and strangely important.
I rarely find myself agreeing with Karl

Rove, but his recent statement that Obama
needs to win lowa to win the Democratic
nomination is right. And an lowa victory
may be all he needs to defeat Clinton.
Here's the logic: Clinton is the frontrun
ner nationally and in most states,despite her
high negative ratings and concerns of elec
tability. She will most likely be unable to
shake that image heading into lowa, her
weakest state by far. But if Obama wins
lowa, even by just a single percentage point,
he will monopolize media coverage of the
results. And the media already loves
Obama. despite his inability to gain any real
ground on Clinton over a 10-month span
and really command a knowledge of policy.
Should he actually beat her, they'll go crazy
— as nuts as Ron Paul or Howard Dean
after the 2(X)4 caucuses.

What would happen if Obama squeaks by
Clinton in Iowa? Send your comments to
