There was the homecoming loss
to TCU, which ended when Stan
ford's last-minute drive — led by
sophomore quarterback Tavita
Pritchard fresh off his improbable
triumph over USC — stalled at the
TCU 18-yard line thanks to heavy
pressure from the Horned Frogs' de
fense. And just last week, a pair of
dropped passes in the north endzone
doomed the Cardinal's chances
against Notre Dame.
But against the Golden Bears (6-
6,3-6 Pac-10) on Saturday night, the
roles were finally reversed, as Stan
ford's defense held firm in front of
the north endzone to preserve a
thrilling 20-13 victory in the 110 th
Big Game. Faced with Cal's potential
game-tying drive in the waning mo
ments of the fourth quarter, senior
cornerback Nick Sanchez, playing
his final game on the Farm, picked off
Cal quarterback Nate Longshore's
pass at the Stanford eight-yard line
to seal the Cardinal's first Big Game
victory since 2001, bringing the Stan
ford Axe back to campus for the first
time in six years.
"As a defense, we live for those
moments," sophomore linebacker
Clinton Snyder said of Cal's last gasp
effort. "Just trying to stop that team
that's knocking on the door is the
greatest feeling in the world as a de
fense. That's where you prove how
good you are."
Stanford (4-8.3-6 Pac-10) won its
first conference game at home —
and only its second home game over
all — since the opening of the new
Stanford Stadium last year due. in
large part, to the contributions of
several key seniors who overcame
adversity in their final season on the
Farm to come up huge in their last
collegiate games.
Sanchez, after struggling with in
juries for most of the 2007 campaign,
notched two interceptions, a pass de
fensed and a quarterback hurry. Se
nior wideout Mark Bradford, who

lost his father only days before the
USC upset, was the Cardinal's lead
ing receiver with five catches for 84
yards and a touchdown, making a
spectacular 23-yard sideline grab for
a first down on Stanford's final drive
to help kill the clock.
"1 had no idea if the ball was going
to me," Bradford said of the fateful
play. "I came off the ball the guy was
sitting on the route and I gave him a
good move off the line, [then] I
looked back and 1 saw Tavita's eyes
light up. It's one of those things, me
and him just have a little connection,
have a little chemistry. He just seems
to love to find me in those big times,
crunch times in games."
Fellow senior receiver Evan
Moore, who dropped one of the pass
es in the north endzone against
Notre Dame last week, looked like
his old self with four catches for three
first downs and drew a pass interfer
ence penalty for a fourth. Senior
kicker Derek Belch went 2-3 on field
goal attempts after a dreadful 0-4
showing against the Irish.
And then there was senior quar
terback T.C. Ostrander, who was
named the starter in his last game at
Stanford after an impressive show
ing in relief of Pritchard last week
against Notre Dame. Ostrander lost
his starting job when he suffered a
seizure in the week before the Cardi
nal's Oct. 6 win at USC, an injury
which led to Pritchard's rise to
prominence in the offense. But the
senior signal caller went 16-for-23 for
151 yards and a touchdown against
Cal while splitting time with
Pritchard. and was Stanford's lead
ing passer on the day.
"Right now I'm just elated," Os
trander said in the locker room fol
lowing the win. "I couldn't have
asked for anything better than this, to
go out on this note, to bring the Axe
back to where it belongs. Once
everything slows down. I'll probably
kick back a little bit and think about

the last five years and what they've
meant to me, but for right now I'm on
cloud nine."
The Cardinal defense held firm all
day against the hated Bears, limiting
them to 5-for-17 on third down con
versions and notching three
turnovers and eight tackles for losses
against a veteran Cal offense. Sopho
more linebacker Clinton Snyder,
junior linebacker Pat Maynor and
sophomore safety Bo McNally led
the way defensively for Stanford
with a combined 25 tackles, 6.5 for
loss, between them. Snyder set up
Stanford's first score of the day when
he forced a Longshore fumble and
then fell on the ball at the Bears' 28-
yard line.
In closing their year with a win,
the Stanford seniors were left with a
final brilliant picture of success in
their minds. But for the rest of the
Cardinal, there was hope that the vic
tory could be as much about a bright
future to come as it was about put
ting the recent forgettable seasons
behind them.
"I would say our team has learned
how to win — we won the Big Game,
and this team has knocked down a lot
of hurdles," Stanford coach Jim Har
baugh said of his team's effort fol
lowing the victory. "The thing about
our team is they go into every game
expecting to win. and they were very
confident coming into this game.
They are the ones who have knocked
down those hurdles and that's a great
springboard for us going into next
year."
NOTES:
— Thousands of jubilant students
and fans stormed the field to cele
brate with the victorious Cardinal
players as the game clock expired.The
goal post in the south endzone was
dislodged but not torn down as police
kept a careful eye on the madness.
— "That student section was filled

an hour before the game," Harbaugh
said. "They were loud, they were into
it the entire game, and I found myself
among them at the end in the middle
of the field and they were tremen
dous. It meant a lot."
— As players and coaches gave in
terviews near midfield, cheering stu
dents held the Axe above their heads
and chanted "We got the Axe!" long

after the final whistle blew.
— The Bears' loss in the 110 th Big
Game dropped them to 6-6 on the
year after they lost six of their last
seven games down the stretch.
— Stanford's win was its first against
Cal since 2001, and its first against
Bears' head coach Jeff Tedford in
that same time span.
— Bradford finished his Stanford

career with 169 receptions and 2,431
receiving yards, finishing in Stan
ford's top five for both career stats.
— After winning this year's Big
Game. Stanford now leads the 110-
year old rivalry — the 10th longest in
college football — 55-44-11.
