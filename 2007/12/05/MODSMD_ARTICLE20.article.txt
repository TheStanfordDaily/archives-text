Library addresses
digitization concerns
To the F.ditor:
Your Nov. 29 article ("Fate of Hast Asia
collection unknown") has given rise to
concerns about the nature of our various
digitization efforts. Several comments and
suggestions from faculty imply that "digiti
zation" is equivalent to full text access to
materials regardless of copyright status.
This is not the case, and I would like to em

phasize that Stanford remains committed
to honoring copyright law and the rights of
authors and publishers while at the same
time pursuing opportunities for digital
scholarship.
Thank you for your continuing coverage
of the evolution of library services on this
campus â€” both particular to the East Asia
Library move and to the broader issues of
information access in the digital age.
