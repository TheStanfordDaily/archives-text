# Pleading Inanity
## The 						hole in the wall 
### 
lused to think that my life would be per
fect. at least insofar as partying was con
cerned. if no one could remember any
thing that I couldn't. Last weekend, though, 1
faced the cruel reality that physical conse
quences may remain even if memories never
formed.
It was Sunday mid-afternoon when I first
surveyed the wreckage.
Jeans around ankles. Unidentified puddle
on kitchen floor. Soundtrack to "Hairspray"
playing at full volume.
Temples throbbing and stomach rum
bling, 1 sifted through my amygdala for traces
of what exactly I'd done the previous night.
What I successfully pieced together was that
the night involved a funnel, a gerbil and a
foam Stanford No. 1 hand with index finger
extended, appearing in roughly that order.
For further guidance, I looked to my cell
phone call log/Facebook message inbox,
which is usually the low point of my post
blackout dawns.The questions that confront
ed me were pressing: Why did I call my aun
tie in San Jose at 2 a.m.? What the heck did
we talk about for two minutes and 17 sec
onds'? Why have three people on Facebook,
two of whom I don't recognize and one of
whom is an Australian high-schooler, re
quested that I acknowledge that we are in a
relationship? And did I really use the Super-
Poke application to "Superman" my girl
friend's best friend, toward whom I harbor
untoward sentiments?
Hoping to distract myself, and praying
that my shame had reached its peak, I got
down on my knees to tackle the aforemen
tioned amorphous puddle. It was then that 1

noticed an unmistakable sharp discomfort,
dare I say burning, in my lower abdomen
(Read: lower abdomen). 1 tentatively turned
around and shook it all about, only to have
my earlier suspicions confirmed. Apollo, we
have a problem.
Disclaimer: the rest of this column contains
off-color, explicit and largely (if not entirely)
inaccurate material, so "Caveat Lector."
As is custom whenever I suspect that I
have a STD, I curled up in the fetal position
and cried for a couple of hours. After that
failed to heal what ailed me, I called Dr. Mom,
who, as a pediatrician in Uniontown,Penn. —
one of the nation's leaders in teen pregnan
cies — thankfully has copious experience in
diagnosing and treating copulaic illnesses.
"Mom!" I wailed, "I Superpoked some
one yesterday on Facebook and didn't use
protection!"
Since my mom wasn't exactly in the know
when it came to Facebook terminology
(more of a Linkedln woman herself), I had to
explain to her what I meant. She then ex
plained to me that, in her professional opin
ion, the transmission of STDs via Facebook
was impossible.
"Could happen if you were Linkedln
though!" she quipped. "Get it, Vishnu kutti?
Linkedln, like, to her, or him if that's your

thing. Not funny? I guess you're not in the
mood for joking."
With Superpoking gone as a potential ex
planation, we were left with an even more
disturbing conclusion: something I had done
that I didn't remember had left me with a
nagging pain in my urethra. After explaining
my symptoms to my mom, she had quite a
surprising diagnosis: penile candidiasis.
What is penile candidiasis you ask? Simply
put, it is a male yeast infection. You probably
thought that men could not get yeast in their
vaginas. Well, I promise you, we can. (FYI: Al
though most men who have this fungus are
asymptomatic, if a man has a yeast infection
he can transmit it to his partner and vice
versa, so it is best that both partners refrain
from sexual activity until they are fully
healed.)
As I learned as a young, impressionable
sprout, knowing is half the battle. In my war
against the thrush, however, I'm realizing that
the other half, action, is just as important:
Monistat 7. Even though I still haven't deter
mined the launching point of the Candida in
vasion, I must accept the consequences of
leaving myself exposed to attack. Luckily,
with miconazole nitrate at my side night and
day (for seven days), we will surely triumph.
1 just hope that our post-victory celebra
tion will be tamer than the one last Saturday
night (and hopefully 1 can get the Australian
high-schooler to come, too).
