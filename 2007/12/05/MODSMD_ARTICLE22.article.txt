## Coalition of the unwilling: Why Republicans can't unite around a candidate 
### 
According to Intrade electronic mar
kets, the Democrats have a 62 percent
chance of winning the 2008 election,
while Republicans have a 37 percent chance.
Intrade rates Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huck
abee as more electable, with around a 44 per
cent chance of winning if either is the nomi
nee, compared to Mitt Romney, John Mc-
Cain or Fred Thompson, whose odds of win
ning are in the 30 to 35 percent range. In con
trast, Hillary Clinton's probability of election
is pegged at 66 percent and Obama's at 55
percent if either is the Democratic nominee.
(Online readers: if you think these figures are
wrong, don't waste your insights idly in the
comments box — go make a buck betting
against them on Intrade!)
More striking, though, is that Republicans
don't like any of their losing nominees. This
election isn't an electability/principle trade
off — it's a lose-lose for both. According to
the Dec. 4 AP/Pew poll, in lowa — where
candidates are campaigning hardest and
where the first primary/caucus will be held
on Jan. 3 — twice as many Democrats rate
their field as "Excellent" as Republicans, and
twice as many Republicans as Democrats say
their choices are not good.
Giuliani is heretical to many Republicans
because of his past moderate stances on gays,
abortion and immigration — a large and in
fluential faction of the Republican party has
promised to jump ship if he is the nominee.
Huckabee is anathema because he support
ed bipartisan tax increases to pay for roads,
schools and health care.
Romney has switched sides on both fiscal
and social issues as he pursued different of
fices, and many evangelicals do not regard
him as a Christian. McCain is so strongly sup
portive of the Iraq War that he has expressed
willingness to pay for it — a position that has

outraged anti-tax crusaders; and his past po
sitions on immigration, campaign finance
and the religious right all make Republican
leaders suspicious that he is a statesman
rather than a partisan. Likewise, Fred
Thompson is an unconvincing movement fig
ure — he has taken solidly conservative po
sitions and criticized other candidates, but he
seems listless rather than zealous on the
stump.
Why can't the Republicans find someone
to carry the conservative banner forward?
Well, their ideal candidate would be a tough
guy who reflexively supports war, the death
penalty and water boarding; an evangelical
with reliable positions against abortion and
gay marriage; an anti-tax zealot who would
never, under any circumstances,support a tax
increase; and a leader against immigration
and affirmative action.
In other words (as 1 see it), the Republi
can base is a cobbled-together coalition of
the fearful, the greedy and the intolerant.
Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo are the
two candidates who don't fail as activists on
any of the "three checkboxes" — greed, in
tolerance and fear — and they are running as
fringe candidates. The next time you hear
someone asking why there is no real conser
vative in the race, ask them about Hunter and
Tancredo.
Hunter and Tancredo are fringe candi
dates because few national leaders manage

to be fearful, greedy, intolerant and popular.
The last two leaders who rode a base-vote
surge to national prominence. Newt Gin
grich and George Bush, retired or will retire
in ignominy. The Bush legacy is particularly
illustrative: what Republican candidate can
explain how they will close the Bush deficit
without raising taxes or ending the war?
Republicans are looking for someone
who talks like a fringe candidate and polls
like a serious one. Anybody that seems seri
ous has taken a position the Republican base
is unwilling to overlook; anyone who has
never taken a position against the base is a
fringe candidate. Conservative activists are
the coalition of the unwilling — after being
spoiled on every issue by the Bush adminis
tration, they are unwilling to hold their nose
to support someone who can win. As a result,
they have neither a nose-holding winner nor
a principled loser. They're getting the worst
of both worlds in their nominees — a nose
holding loser.
The longer the primary remains unre
solved, the more the leading Republican can
didates will try to establish themselves as the
fear/greed/intolerance candidate, and the
worse their chances will get. According to In
trade, the odds are around 85 percent that the
Democrats will control the House in 2008
and around 85 percent that they will also
control the Senate.
It looks to be a dismal year for the Re
publicans. Let's hope the Democrats take
this opportunity to offer a clear and honest
alternative, rather that mistaking the Re
publican implosion for a mandate. If not, we
will end up in the same place sooner rather
than later.
