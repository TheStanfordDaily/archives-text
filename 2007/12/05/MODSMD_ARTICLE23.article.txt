£ £ "¥~t' s life's simple pleasures that count."
I Somewhere along the line, my cyni-
JLcal mind decided that this statement
was both patently false and inherently mis
leading.
I realized this following a screening of
Ratatouille. I was in a room full of smiling
people, each discussing the novelty of a talk
ing rat.
"Did you see that part where the rat was
talking and he shouldn't have been because
he's a rat, and rats don't talk?"
"How about that part where we found out
that the title was a pun because the main char
acter is a rat who cooks and also because rata
touille is a traditional French ProvenAal
stewed vegetable dish?"
Their little praise party lasted for about
five minutes, and grumpy old me sat in the
corner and thought about how I could have
better spent the last two hours of my life. I
didn't like the movie. I didn't like the fact that
it was about a rat who could talk. The best
praise I could possibly offer was that Rata
touille wasn't an exact copy of Stuart Little,
given that Stuart was a mouse. The reviews
hailed it as "heartwarming" and "uplifting."
But when Ratatouille ended, my heart was as
cold, if not colder, than it had been when the
movie started.
And it got me thinking, my heart has never
been warmed by a movie. It would take one
hell of a metaphorical heart microwave to
bring it to the status of barely lukewarm.

It's because I won't, and can't, let a movie
do that to me.
In fact, I realized, I can't let a movie do
anything to me that I don't want it to do. I
have to enjoy a movie on my own terms. And
this always amounts to a sort of ironic appre
ciation.
There are two ways to appreciate both life
and movies: you can laugh with them or laugh
at them. And because I'm so smarmy, I'm in
capable of the former. I have to enjoy some
thing at its own expense.
As a consequence, if a movie sets out to do
something, I can't accept it. Horror movies
can't and shouldn't be scary, action movies
shouldn't inspire me to blow things up. and
comedy movies, the one category I might ap
preciate on its own terms, aren't as good as
funny horror movies.
And I'm fairly confident it's not just me. A
sizable post-modern subset of our generation
is incapable of any kind of genuine apprecia
tion for something. Any enjoyment we obtain
from public media has to reflect well upon
ourselves. As a sort of narcissism, laughing at
people (formerly known as bullying) has be

come a high art form.
Add to this mix YouTUbe. Here we find an
entire Web site dedicated to videos we mock,
deride and laugh at. A video can still be funny
in itself, but the best kind of YouTUbe clip is
the kind in which the presenter is having an
unintended effect on his/her audience. And
because of virtual distance, it has become eas
ier to mock without consequences. Anyone
who has ever read the eloquently phrased
comments below a YouTUbe video knows all
about this.
The post-modern era has made a mockery
of intention. You can't set out to do anything
anymore because everyone who enjoys your
movie will be doing so for a different reason.
The best you can do is actually set out to
do the opposite. The most heart-warming
movie I have ever seen is "Requiem for a
Dream," which set out to be one of the most
depressing movies ever made.
I could set out here to mock my own atti
tude, but I think it makes for its own mockery.
Which itself is one of the greatest assets of this
way of thinking: I don't have to answer for
anything.
"Ratatouille," you failed because I could
n't accept you on any other terms than those
you specified. And, ultimately, you failed be
cause our generation is too cynical to enjoy
life's simplest pleasures, unless they're
wrought at someone else's expense.
