### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The organizers of last Friday's Big Party were overwhelm
ingly pleased with the hash's success, especially after months of
tedious planning.
"I, personally, thought the Big Party went fantastically."
said ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 in an email to The
Daily."We had amazing turnout from students, and most people
who I talked to after the event said that they had a great time."
The ASSU not only funded the event — which was hosted
by the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) at Columbae, Mars, Sigma
Nu and Casa Italiana — hut also served as the party's sponsor
ing organization.The ASSU organized security and covered the
costs of the bands and the DJs as well.
The Big Game Week Committee and the IFC also played
crucial roles in planning the event.
Stacie Chan '10. who served as chair of the Big Game Week
Committee, oversaw the hiring of the DJs. obtained approval
from each of the four participating houses and collaborated be
tween the different groups involved in organizing the night.
"An event of this magnitude involved an enormous amount
of planning and coordinating." Chan said in an email to The
Daily. "Getting it approved and working out all the logistics was
incredibly difficult, but. in the end. the party went on successful
ly"
According to organizers, overcapacity was the only problem
that arose during the event.
"In fact, so many students showed up to the party that we
actually had to stop giving out entrance wristbands around mid
night because of concerns with some of the houses being over
capacity," Avula said.
But the night's overall success gave the planners hope that
Big Party will become an annual tradition before Big Game.
"Thanks to the large turn-out and great planning by the
ASSU and IFC, throwing the party next year will definitely be
something on the ASSU's agenda." Chan said.
IFC President Kyle Ladewig "08 was optimistic as well.
"We got a very positive response from students who at
tended the party, and some went so far as to say it was the most
fun party they'd been to at Stanford," Ladewig said in an email
to The Daily. "We hoped that this event would become a Stan
ford tradition, and I think we succeeded in doing so."
Avula said the ASSU plans to hold another block party
on the Row later this year, most likely during spring quarter.
