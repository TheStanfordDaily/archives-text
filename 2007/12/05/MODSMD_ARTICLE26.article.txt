ford has yet another chance to beat Cal
today. For this year's Darfur Fast, Stan
ford will be competing in The Great Fast
Off with UC-Davisand UC-Berkeley to

see which school can recruit the most
fasters. Sponsored by Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND), a stu
dent anti-violence coalition, Darfur Fast
aims to raise awareness and money in
hopes of creating a sense of solidarity
with the oppressed people of Darfur.
At Stanford, participants are in
structed not to eat anything from the
time they wake up this morning until
tonight's "break the fast"event at 6 p.m.
in Tresidder Union. With the money

they save by not eating, fasters are
asked to make a minimum contribution
of $5.
All donations will be matched by an
outside donor and will go to the Darfur
Stoves Project, which aims to give fuel
efficient stoves to people in Darfur.
