## Darfur fast to raise money, awareness Students will compete against UC-Davis, Cal 
### NIKHIL JOSHI 
After Big Game last weekend, Stan
ford has yet another chance to beat Cal
today. For this year's Darfur Fast, Stan
ford will be competing in The Great Fast
Off with UC-Davisand UC-Berkeley to

see which school can recruit the most
fasters. Sponsored by Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND), a stu
dent anti-violence coalition, Darfur Fast
aims to raise awareness and money in
hopes of creating a sense of solidarity
with the oppressed people of Darfur.
At Stanford, participants are in
structed not to eat anything from the
time they wake up this morning until
tonight's "break the fast"event at 6 p.m.
in Tresidder Union. With the money

they save by not eating, fasters are
asked to make a minimum contribution
of $5.
All donations will be matched by an
outside donor and will go to the Darfur
Stoves Project, which aims to give fuel
efficient stoves to people in Darfur.
"Fuel-efficient stoves require less
wood," said event organizer Stephanie
Rodriguez'o9. "Women have to trav
el far distances to get wood, and
when they go to get this wood is
when they are attacked by proxy
militias."
One fuel-efficient stove costs $20,
and with Stanford's matching pro
gram, a $10 donation will be enough
to buy a stove. Stanford STAND
hopes to generate at least $20,000 in

donations today.
Seth Silverman '08, another event
organizer, said that the results of the
fast will go far beyond the actual
money donated.
"[The fast] will create a real sense
of solidarity," he said. "Too often the
people of Darfur are portrayed as
only victims, but the survivors are he
roes and courageous actors. Every
day women leave the camps and face
threat of sexual violence just to gath
er wood to feed the families."
Though this year's iteration of
Darfur Fast has been marketed at
Stanford as a competition with UC-

Davis and UC-Berkeley, Stanford's
comparatively small student popula
tion makes winning the challenge an
uphill battle.
"They are so much bigger than us,
but we are so much better than
them "said Rodriguez.
Silverman said the competition
transcends the rivalry.
"The competition is kind of a
foil," he admitted. "It's really about
rivals coming together for the
greater good."
