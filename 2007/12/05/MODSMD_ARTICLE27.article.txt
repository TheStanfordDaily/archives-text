## VW funds high-tech car facility 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
For a $ 1 million prize-winning ro
botic car like Stanford's "Junior," the
Volkswagen Passat that snagged sec
ond place at the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Urban Challenge
last month, you might expect a
snazzy parking space on campus. It
should come as no surprise, then, that
Junior's home is being upgraded
from a small Quonset hut on Stock
Farm Road to a full-fledged automo
tive research center.
Thanks to a $5.75 million dona
tion by Volkswagen, Junior will be
part of a new Volkswagen Automo
tive Innovation Lab (VAIL) at Stan
ford. The center, for which construc
tion has not yet begun, will also
house a teaching and research pro

gram called Car Lab.
"This is a great and successful
partnership with a first-class univer
sity," said Burkhard Huhnke, execu
tive director of Volkswagen's Elec
tronics Research Laboratory (VW
ERL) in an interview with The Daily.
"[Our aims consist of] creating fu
ture projects focusing on automotive
topics and combining different initia
tives under the umbrella of VAIL to
use the synergy potential â€” one of
the defined goals of the VAIL.This is
a great opportunity for both part
ners."
According to Huhnke, Volkswa
gen's donation covers $2 million to
ward construction costs and $750,(XX)
per year for the following five years
to fund research activities focused on
driver assistance, human-machine
interfacing and the environment.
Car Lab faculty will include Me

chanical Engineering Prof. Chris
Gerdes, Computer Seience and Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Sebastian
Thrun and Communieation Prof.
Clifford Nass, who is also a professor
of computer science and sociology.
Thrun's work focuses on the road
and the environment, while Nass
covers communication between
human and vehicle. Gerdes, who is
involved in vehicle dynamics and
control, will also serve as the lab's di
rector.
' What we are trying to do is to
forge a community at Stanford, [one]
where everyone interested in auto
motive challenges can come together
to meet them," Gerdes said, adding
that the community is open to any
one who wants to actively participate
in radically re-envisioning the future
