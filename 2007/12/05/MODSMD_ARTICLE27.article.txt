## VW funds high-tech car facility 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
For a $ 1 million prize-winning ro
botic car like Stanford's "Junior," the
Volkswagen Passat that snagged sec
ond place at the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Urban Challenge
last month, you might expect a
snazzy parking space on campus. It
should come as no surprise, then, that
Junior's home is being upgraded
from a small Quonset hut on Stock
Farm Road to a full-fledged automo
tive research center.
Thanks to a $5.75 million dona
tion by Volkswagen, Junior will be
part of a new Volkswagen Automo
tive Innovation Lab (VAIL) at Stan
ford. The center, for which construc
tion has not yet begun, will also
house a teaching and research pro

gram called Car Lab.
"This is a great and successful
partnership with a first-class univer
sity," said Burkhard Huhnke, execu
tive director of Volkswagen's Elec
tronics Research Laboratory (VW
ERL) in an interview with The Daily.
"[Our aims consist of] creating fu
ture projects focusing on automotive
topics and combining different initia
tives under the umbrella of VAIL to
use the synergy potential — one of
the defined goals of the VAIL.This is
a great opportunity for both part
ners."
According to Huhnke, Volkswa
gen's donation covers $2 million to
ward construction costs and $750,(XX)
per year for the following five years
to fund research activities focused on
driver assistance, human-machine
interfacing and the environment.
Car Lab faculty will include Me

chanical Engineering Prof. Chris
Gerdes, Computer Seience and Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Sebastian
Thrun and Communieation Prof.
Clifford Nass, who is also a professor
of computer science and sociology.
Thrun's work focuses on the road
and the environment, while Nass
covers communication between
human and vehicle. Gerdes, who is
involved in vehicle dynamics and
control, will also serve as the lab's di
rector.
' What we are trying to do is to
forge a community at Stanford, [one]
where everyone interested in auto
motive challenges can come together
to meet them," Gerdes said, adding
that the community is open to any
one who wants to actively participate
in radically re-envisioning the future
of the automobile and work with
real cars.
"The exciting part of Car Lab is
that we are bringing together people
who build technology with people
who understand the psychology of
technology from both Stanford and
industry,"Nass said."l think it will be
wonderful for my students and me to
be able to interact with people who
are making cars more intelligent and
effective."
The aims of Car Lab are mani
fold. According to Nass, the first is to
make fundamental discoveries in all
aspects of car design, from computer
science to mechanical engineering,
to psychology and communication.
The second is to apply improve
ments to actual cars in the market
place, and the third is to facilitate in
teractions between the University
and the industry.
According to Huhnke. Volkswa
gen views Junior — which it helped
build with Stanford — as a highly
competitive autonomous vehicle.
The company finds Thrun's work to
be strong and their partnership to be
successful. Prior to Junior, Thrun
worked with Volkswagen together
to create another robotic car, Stan
ley, which won DARPA's national
Grand Challenge race in 2005.
"Since Volkswagen has the Elec
tronics Research Laboratory in Palo
Alto, they are not a distant company
but in fact a close neighbor to us,"
Gerdes said. "Housing these activi
ties together will bring campus re
searchers together and lead to inno
vations that are broader than any
one of us could accomplish alone."
There are numerous practical ap
plications to this robotic vehicle re

search. According to Nass, the way to
dramatically improve the perform
ance of automobiles along a number
of dimensions is to make cars
"smarter."
For example, Gerdes explained
that a dramatic reduction in engine
emissions over the last few decades
was only possible due to computer
control; computer-automated pro
duction systems such as stability
control have also been shown to re
duce loss of control accidents by ap
proximately 30 percent.
"What you will see in the near fu
ture are more driver assistance sys
tems that aid the driver in tasks such
as lane keeping, emergency braking
and collision avoidance," Gerdes
said.
In preparing to release technolo
gy to the general public, a master re
search agreement was signed be
tween Stanford and VW-ERL, with
the terms of the agreement varying
depending on individual arrange
ments for intellectual property.
"Generally, if something is devel
oped by Stanford researchers, it is
owned by Stanford," Gerdes ex
plained. "If it is developed jointly, ac
cording to the standards of patent
law, it is owned jointly. Volkswagen's
rights to research that it sponsors are
the same as any other company.
There is no special access being sold
here."
In creating and redesigning auto
motive technology, Car Lab will also
provide students with vital contacts
in the automobile industry and allow
them to develop applicable skills
that are needed in the job market.
"Through this partnership,"
Huhnke said, "we would like to at
tract Stanford graduates to the Volk
swagen family — Bentley, Bugatti,
Lamborghini, VW and Audi."

said.
In preparing to release technolo
gy to the general public, a master re
search agreement was signed be
tween Stanford and VW-ERL, with
the terms of the agreement varying
depending on individual arrange
ments for intellectual property.
"Generally, if something is devel
oped by Stanford researchers, it is
owned by Stanford," Gerdes ex
plained. "If it is developed jointly, ac
cording to the standards of patent
law, it is owned jointly. Volkswagen's
rights to research that it sponsors are
the same as any other company.
There is no special access being sold
here."
In creating and redesigning auto
motive technology, Car Lab will also
provide students with vital contacts
in the automobile industry and allow
them to develop applicable skills
that are needed in the job market.
"Through this partnership,"
Huhnke said, "we would like to at
tract Stanford graduates to the Volk
swagen family — Bentley, Bugatti,
Lamborghini, VW and Audi."
