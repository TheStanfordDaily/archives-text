# Waiting FOR Democracy
## STUDENTS REFLECT ON STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PAKISTAN 
### CHELSEA MA 
Following Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's
coup in early November came a flood of media attention
highlighting civilian violence and crushed hopes for a
democracy. But behind this dismal facade, Muslim stu-

dents on campus are viewing the crisis through a more
complex, even optimistic, lens.
Opinions varied from the very beginning. Why did
Musharraf declare a state of emergency, curtailing the

rights of habeas corpus and the freedom of move
ment, assembly, speech and press?

"Let's be very clear, Musharraf imposed the
emergency in order to sack the judiciary', which
was about to declare his re-election illegal,"
said Ayesha Ali, a graduate student in interna
tional policy studies. "This move was motivated

by his interest in staying in power and getting rid
of activist judges from the Supreme Court."
Ibis is the stance held by the majority of the
public, but the other side is often ignored. In Pak-

istan, there is a militant group — which the U.S.
government believes is linked to Al-Qaeda —
that opposes the country's official army. Mushar
raf claimed that he declared an emergency be-

cause of concerns of a militant movement spread
ing to the capital.
Sohail Razzaq "09, treasurer of the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network (MSAN) and a Pak
istani citizen, recognizes this opposing opinion but
decries the dissolution of constitutional rights.
"Even if we do admit that a civil war might re
quire a state of emergency, this civil war has been
going on for the past six to nine months — why de
clare it now?" Razzaq said. "You cannot curtail civil
liberties; the constitution needs to be restored
A.S.A.P."
Some say that the tie between the U.S. govern
ment and Pakistan, which the Bush administration
views as a key ally in the war on terror, has been
healthy. Others, however, see a connection between
the increased number of suicide bombings and
Pakistan's support of the U.S. There is, nev
ertheless, a consensus among Muslim students at
Stanford that Musharraf has prioritized his inter
national relations above the welfare of his own
country.
"P:iLrivtnn hf»f>n fiohtino thp I I S w:ir (in tpr-

raKistan nas oeen ngnung ineu.s. war on ter
ror on its soil since 2003," Ali said. "As a result,
Pakistan has suffered, its people have suffered J
and national security has suffered. The real is- j
sues, such as economic progress, poverty eradica- I

tion, water and energy problems, have been sidelined."
Razzaq agreed.
"Musharraf has done a good job with the international
community, but what lacks desperately is effort on the do
mestic side," he said."He has not angered the U.S. as much
as he has his own people. He needs to remember that he is
the representative of Pakistan's citizens. Lately, it
seems like that's not the case, and that's —
why the public is angry." •—
It is this —

anger that, some students feel, gives Pakistan hope. Pak
istan has seen glimpses of democracy before. In fact, two
years ago, the press was much freer under Musharraf than
it is today. The challenge is sustaining — not achieving —
democracy. Many say that this is the job of the Pakistani
people.

"1 believe the country' has every potential to rein
state democracy," said Rowza Rumma TO, campus
advocacy chair for MSAN, "although it will have to
work hard staving off corruption from paralyzing
the democratic system, as has been seen in the
past

To Muslim students, one thing is clear: democra
cy is a slow process, not something that can be es
tablished overnight. Clear steps must be made —
mainly, separation of powers, independence of
the Supreme Court, uncensored media and elec-

tions, and. most importantly, executive respon
sibility. Overthrowing dictators won t do the
trick, but consistently keeping an eye on their
actions just might.

"The real road block that Pakistan has
faced in moving toward democracy has been
weak institutions and lack of effective exec
utive accountability," Ali said."Eventually,

[he future of democracy in any society
rests in the hands of the people."
Apathy among the public, to many, is

more harmful than corruption of a
leader. Students agreed that Pakistan's
citizens must demand the freedom to

voice their opinions in order to en
sure democracy. November's
protests, though sad in their vio-

lence, can perhaps be seen as sure
evidence toward increased politi
cal awareness for Pakistani peo
ple.

Razzaq remained hopeful.
"We've seen three
wars, we've seen a military
dictatorship and we've not

only survived, but have
done much better," he
said. "Things seem bleak.

but not all is lost. It's noth
ing the people can't fix."
