## Hypnotist, comedians kick off Dead Week with laughs 
### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many students feel like they're under hyp
nosis as they trudge through Dead Week, but
Monday night in Memorial Auditorium, several
Stanford students actually were hypnotized.
In the first study break of its kind, four co
medians and a hypnotist performed a two-hour
show for an audience of more than 2(X) people.
Organized by the Stanford Comedy Club, the
event featured comedians Tim Babb, Kevin
Avery. Andrew Norelli and kellen Erskine, fol
lowed by Sailesh, who is heralded as The World's
Best Uncensored Hypnotist.
"My girlfriend is great as a person, although
not so much at spelling," said Erskine, who

opened the night."She texted me this morning:
1 had a great night last night.TREVOR.' I think
there was a big typo there."
Bahb kept the jokes coming, as the comedi
ans' routines ranged from race to relationships
to gender.
"My wife's great and she loves being a school
teacher," Bahb said. "A schoolteacher and a co
median getting married — that's got to be the
lowest combined salary of any family in the U.S."
Ihe star of the show was clearly Sailesh. how
ever. who kept about 15 student volunteers hyp
notized for more than an hour.
"It was weird."said Cameron Barnewall'll,
one of the volunteers. "I knew things weren't ac
tually happening when I was hypnotized but it
felt like they were."

Under Sailesh's hypnosis, the volunteers
landed on Mars, saved people on a sinking ship,
spoke in East Indian accents and became pelvic
thrusters and river-dancers on command.
"I didn't know how good I apparently am at
pelvic thrusts," said Caitlin Berka '08. "It was
weird, since you know what you're doing is
bizarre but you can't control it. like the time we
were having sex with the chairs."
Among his other scenarios, Sailesh hosted
a Jerry Springer show where his volunteers
were asked to divulge secrets about their
friends. One volunteer revealed that his friend
had a "thing for his cousin's animals," some
thing he said was just plain wrong, while Berka
said her friend had two vaginas, which thor
oughly amused the audience.

While students were certainly entertained,
Sailesh himself was also thrilled to be on cam
pus.
"It was great performing to such a multicul
tural environment here at Stanford," he said.
"The students were truly appreciative of the
show and the humor, and it reinforced my love
for my profession of 13 years."
Overall,audience members were entertained
throughout the night — despite their initial
questions about the validity of hypnosis.
"I was very skeptical to begin with because I
had never seen a hypnotist before," said Sabine
Bergmann '10. "However, tonight's perform
ance was truly unique and entertaining."
