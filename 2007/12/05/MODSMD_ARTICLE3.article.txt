# New eval site debuts
## Student-launched CourseRank incorporates comment feature 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
Just as students are wrapping up
fall quarter classes and beginning to
think about courses for the winter,
a new course guide Web site has
made its way online.
Launched yesterday, Courseß
ank (http://courserank.Stanford,
edu) is a parallel version of the
course guide system previously re
leased this fall by the ASSU and the
Office of the University Registrar.
While not a competitor to the
Axess site, Courseßank and the
team behind it look to improve
upon the groundwork already set
by the ASSU and the Registrar.
"We are hoping to brand this site
under the ASSU name and ensure
students that it is made completely
for their benefit," said ASSU Presi
dent Hershey Avula '08 in an email
to The Daily. "The new release
should act in some ways as a more
easy to use and centralized virtual
advisor, course planner and course
guide than even the current Axess
Web site, and we are very excited
for this."
Computer science students Ben
jamin Bercovitz '09, Filip Kaliszan
'09 and Henry Liou '09 started
Courseßank last spring as part of a
class project. Working with the Un
dergraduate Senate and the Regis

trar, the trio joined forces with
Stanford Info Lab this fall and were
given access to the same class eval
uations published on Axess.
With this information, the team
established its own site — courser
ank .stanford.edu — in hopes of de
veloping a definitive Stanford
course guide that is both informa
tive and easy to use.
"We wanted to make our site
much more user-friendly than the
Axess one," Kaliszan said. "As
you'll notice, [Courseßank is] very
fast compared to the Axess site,
where pages load pretty slowly. We
focused on making our interface
cleaner, more snappy and also
faster."
Other than easier navigation,
Kaliszan noted that Courseßank
offers more freedom for comments
that are in line with student inter
ests — rather than the professor
centered feedback of much of the
Axess data. Avula added that the
student-written, qualitative com
ments are a marked bonus over
what is available on the current
Axess site.
Other features are also unique
to Courseßank; for example, the
site features a weekly schedule
planner and GKR tracker for users.
In addition, Avula hopes that by
