Green Library holds between 50
and 90 textbooks on course reserve eau.
quarter for students to borrow. But with the help of ad
ministrators, faculty and librarians, a trio of undergrad
uate senators plans to implement a winter quarter pilot
program that will double the number of textbooks
available.
Senator Vang Kou Khang "08 said that there is a
demand to increase the number of reserve textbooks
because many students cannot afford the high cost of
those sold at the Stanford Bookstore.
Senator Sarah Golabek-Goldman '10 got the idea
for the program last year when talking to a friend who
complained about the high prices of many textbooks.
"I le told me that he had to rely on the textbooks
on reserve because the ones in the Bookstore are so as
tronomically expensive for so many students," Go
labek-Goldman said.
Khang. working with Golabek-Goldman and Sen
ator Luukas lives '09. contacted Green librarians.
Bookstore employees and professors from various de
partments to gauge the demand for certain textbooks.
Considerations included student recommendations, li
brary loan records. Bookstore sale records,class enroll
ments and the probability that a new edition will not be
published in the near future.
lives said a final list of the books to be used in the
pilot program will be formulated within the next few
weeks.
Funding for the program will come from the dis
cretionary funds of Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '79.
In an email to The Daily, Bravman said he will com
mit to fund next quarter's program, but at this time he
is not prepared to continue funding the program even
if the pilot is a success.
Nevertheless, Golabek-Goldman said she was
grateful for an "administrator who was receptive to an
idea like this."
"[Bravman] even mentioned that when he was a
student at Stanford, he often relied on textbooks on re

serve," she said.
The senators also hope that with more textbooks
on reserve at Green, students will be able to borrow
books for longer than the three hours currently al
lowed.
"Right now you can only check [textbooks] out for
three hours, which isn't really good when you're trying
to study for an exam," Golabek-Goldman said. "Hope
fully, with more textbooks in the future,students will be
able to check them out for longer periods."
But Khang emphasized that there will be limita
tions to next quarter's program because it is only a trial.
"This is a pilot program, so we're not able to in
crease books for every single class," he said.
Potential difficulties do not end there. If the pilot
program is successful, the library will not have enough
space to expand its reserve area, according to Director
of Library Communications Andrew Herkovic.
"If this turns out to be the best thing that ever hap
pened at Stanford, and there really is a tremendous de
mand for textbooks materials, we would be in real trou
ble." he said. "The reserve area just doesn't have the
physical capacity for presumably multiple copies of
hundreds of courses worth of textbooks."
Herkovic did note, however, that other universi
ties provide textbooks on reserve, and that some are
even required to do so by law.
"Virginia passed a state law a few years ago stat
ing that public universities have to provide textbooks
on course reserves," he said.
lives said that the three senators will be contact
ing universities in Virginia over the holiday break to
learn how their programs work.
Golabek-Goldman said that once the pilot program
is in place, students will be able to submit feedback and
recommendations through the ASSU Web site.
