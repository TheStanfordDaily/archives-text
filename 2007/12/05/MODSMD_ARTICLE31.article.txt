## Prof. has plan to clean up Hunters Point Luthy proposes carbon-centered method of removing pollutants 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of November's San Francisco Bay oil
spill, much media and scientific attention has been given
to the cleanup process. But for Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Richard Luthy, controlling aqueous
contaminants is not a new problem.
For more than two years, Luthy has been spearhead
ing a pilot test, which so far appears to partially mitigate
the environmental damage of industrial chemicals
called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Bay Area
sediment.
"The idea is that by adding activated carbon to sed
iment, you can bind up certain harmful chemicals,"
Luthy said. "The process absorbs the toxic chemicals
and it prevents them from getting into the aquatic food
chain."
PCBs, which the Environmental Protection Agency

has labeled as possible carcinogens, were widely used
before their 1979 ban. But traces of the toxin still haunt
aqueous sediments near former industrial sites like the
naval shipyard by Hunters Point in San Francisco, the
site for Luthy's study.
In the past,some efforts have been made to remove
harmful sediment through dredging, but this process
merely transplants toxic waste,contaminating dumping
sites on land. In fact, Luthy said that dredging the top
layers of sediment may be more harmful than doing
nothing at all. because it risks exposing older layers that
have higher PCB concentrations.
Luthy claimed that his activated carbon method is
not only more cost-effective than dredging, but it more
thoroughly addresses the contamination problem. So
far. tests on four muddy plots, each about "the size of a
large office," have delivered promising results.
"There's been a reduction in aqueous concentra
tion," he said, "the process seems to be working."
His work has found that clams left in mesh cages on
treated sediment had 50 percent less PC B concentra
tion than their counterparts left on untreated sediment.
Luthy's team will be continuing to monitor the site for a
year, and a second test in New York's Grasse River is
currently underway.
"We have demonstrated what is possible," Luthy
said. "What's needed now is a larger field test so that we
can improve our engineering and scientific understand
ing."

Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,
which used potentially cancer
causing chemical PCBs until they
were banned in ] 979, is where
Prof. Richard Luthy hopes to use his
k new cleanup method.
