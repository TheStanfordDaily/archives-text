## ASSU looks to improve shuttle Airport buses to expand service to San Jose 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Airport Shuttle serv
ice ran at 88 percent capacity dur
ing its Thanksgiving Break run, but
ASSU officials hope to improve
the program's efficiency for the up
coming winter break service. ASSU
Executives and Senators met last
Friday to discuss plans for the pro
gram, which included increasing
shuttle availability and route effi
ciency.
For the Thanksgiving run, the
ASSU scheduled hourly shuttles to
San Francisco International Airport
(SFO) and a bus that ran to San Jose
International Airport (SJC) every
hour-and-a-half. The popularity of
the San Jose shuttle last month, how
ever, forced officials to reconsider
the availability of buses bringing stu
dents to SJC.
"We saw that even though there
was one shuttle going to San Jose and
two going to San Francisco, the num
ber of people that use the service to
San Jose is awfully similar to the
number going to San Francisco," said

ASSU Vice President Mondaire
Jones '09. "Adding another shuttle to
San Jose would allow for people who
couldn't use the San Jose shuttle last
time to use it this time around."
Senators also said an additional
SJC shuttle would alleviate the peak
hours ticket crunch that some stu
dent faced before Thanksgiving.
"The most problematic part of the
Thanksgiving shuttle service was
that peak shuttle times sold out so
quickly," said Senator Jonathan Kass
•10.
In addition to increasing the num
ber of shuttles going to San Jose,
ASSU officials plan to begin the win
ter break service on Thursday, Dec.
13 and continue sending buses to
SFO and SJC all day Friday and until
dorms close on Saturday afternoon.
For the winter break run, officials
are working to improve the efficien
cy of student pick-up around cam
pus.
"1 would say that the main issue
was the lack of [drivers'] familiarity
with the route," Jones said. "We find
that to be very surprising."
Drivers were selected by a com
pany that Parking and Transporta
tion Services (P&TS) subcontracted.
Although these drivers were sup
posed to have done trial runs
through campus, ASSU officials said

pick-ups could be more efficient.
"In an ideal situation, we would
really like to have F&TS drivers ac
tually man the vehicles," Jones
added. "The people that work with
P&TS are more familiar with the
routes because they are driving the
Marguerites."
Despite the changes in store for
the winter break service, ticket prices
for the shuttles are likely to remain
the same as they were for Thanksgiv
ing break:slo.
Jones said the ASSU will again
work to gather information about
shuttle usage rates.
"We are very much in an experi
mental phase right now." he said.
"We have worked out a lot of the
kinks, and we are still getting there.
The goal is to come as close to perfec
tion as possible."
"1 think the [Thanksgiving] pro
gram was a definite success," added
Senator Luukas lives '09. "1 was ini
tially among those skeptical of
whether it made sense for the ASSU
to provide a service already available
on the market, but I've been pleased
to see that we're meeting a specific
niche of demand more effectively
than the market previously had."
