In his application to study con
sumer behavior at Stanford more
than 20 years ago, Brian Wansink
wrote that he wanted to learn how to
make people eat more fruits and veg
etables. Now, after being appointed
executive director of the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture's (USDA)
Center for Nutrition Policy and Pro
motion last month. Wansink Ph.D.
"91 will have the chance to put what

he learned at the Farm into practice.
As part of his new job. Wansink
will chair a committee to revise the
food pyramid and put together new
dietary guidelines by 2010.
Wansink. who is the author of
"Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More
Than We Think," said that he will also
be in charge of a healthy eating
index, which determines how much
money is necessary to raise a child
and has implications for everything
from alimony to bankruptcy.
According to Wansink, one of the

most notable differences between
the new guidelines and the old ones
is that, while older pyramids tended
to focus on a one-size-fits-all dietary
regimen, the new guidelines will
"give people latitude but still tell
them exactly how much latitude they
have."
Wansink said that he wanted to
help people focus on making small
changes in their lives that could lead
to a healthier lifestyle.
