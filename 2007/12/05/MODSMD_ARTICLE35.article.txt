## Farm alum to revise food pyramid 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
In his application to study con
sumer behavior at Stanford more
than 20 years ago, Brian Wansink
wrote that he wanted to learn how to
make people eat more fruits and veg
etables. Now, after being appointed
executive director of the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture's (USDA)
Center for Nutrition Policy and Pro
motion last month. Wansink Ph.D.
"91 will have the chance to put what

he learned at the Farm into practice.
As part of his new job. Wansink
will chair a committee to revise the
food pyramid and put together new
dietary guidelines by 2010.
Wansink. who is the author of
"Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More
Than We Think," said that he will also
be in charge of a healthy eating
index, which determines how much
money is necessary to raise a child
and has implications for everything
from alimony to bankruptcy.
According to Wansink, one of the

most notable differences between
the new guidelines and the old ones
is that, while older pyramids tended
to focus on a one-size-fits-all dietary
regimen, the new guidelines will
"give people latitude but still tell
them exactly how much latitude they
have."
Wansink said that he wanted to
help people focus on making small
changes in their lives that could lead
to a healthier lifestyle.
"It's not just saying to people,'you
need to turn your whole life
around,'" he said. "It's about helping
people make small changes in the
right direction which eventually
start piling up and making a real dif
ference."
As executive director, Wansink
said that he also plans to emphasize
the importance of physical exercise
to a healthy lifestyle and to make
sure that more people find out about
the new guidelines.
"The MyPyramid.gov Web site
has been highly successful so far with
over four billion hits," he said. "But I
want to expand even more by focus
ing on partnerships with different in
formation multipliers to get the mes
sage out and get businesses to work
together with us in making people
healthy in a win-win way, where they
can make a profit while promoting
healthy foods."
Wansink said that as part of his
campaign to emphasize the impor
tance of physical exercise, he has
been talking with video game groups
about getting the food pyramid
downloadable on the Nintendo Wii.
The new executive director also
wants to take the food pyramid be
yond domestic borders.
"We've been trying to work on
the idea of exporting nutrition," he
said. "We've been talking to Dubai
and Ukraine about applying the di
etary guidelines in their own coun
tries."
Wansink credited his passion for
food to another, more famous Stan
ford grad.

"He was in the first graduating
class of [1895]," he said. "Another
lowan like myself, Herbert Hoover.
He basically saved Western Europe
after World War 1 because they were
in tremendous starvation, and his
food release programs and logistical
overseeing of Western Europe really
brought them out of the starvation
crisis.
"I have in my office ration books
from that time period to remind me
of how grateful we need to be about
food and that it's a real critical thing
we shouldn't take for granted," he
added.
While at Stanford. Wansink said
that he had a difficult time getting
through his Ph.D. program and that
his professors really helped him
complete his doctoral education.
James Lattin, a marketing profes
sor in the Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB), recalled that Wansink's
educational interests were very
broad.
"Most doctoral students are an
inch wide and a mile deep," Lattin
said. "But 1 remember that Brian re
fused to be pigeonholed. He resisted
that sort of laser-like focus through
out his entire career as a doctoral
student, and 1 think that may be a
risky thing to do, but Brian was just
wired that way."
GSB Prof. Seenu Srinivasan, who
taught Wansink in a class called
"Quantitative Research in Market
ing," recalled a student with a very
uplifting personality.
"He's a very persistent guy, but
he's also a person with an incredibly
positive attitude," Srinivasan said.
"I'm totally delighted to hear of his
appointment."
