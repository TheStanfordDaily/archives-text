## Pedometers spur physical activity Step-counters improve health, study finds 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
The pedometer, a simple and in
expensive step-counting device, sig
nificantly increases daily activity lev
els and even promotes weight loss, ac
cording to a recent study directed by
Dena Bravata, a senior research sci
entist at Stanford's School of Medi
cine.
Bravata and her team of re
searchers analyzed study results from
2,767 people, mostly overweight and
inactive women, who agreed to keep
records of their physical activity
while using a pedometer over an 18-
week period. On average, the study
found that the participants using pe

dometers increased their daily activi
ty by 2,183 steps.
"Just over 2,1(X) steps might nut
sound like that much, but it equates
to a 27 percent increase in physical
activity — which is really astound
ing," said Bravata in a Nov. 20 School
of Medicine news release.
Bravata also observed that most
participants experienced a drop in
systolic blood pressure and a slightly
lower body mass index (BMI) after
using a pedometer for the duration of
the study.
ITiough the study did not formal
ly analyze why a pedometer might
motivate people to increase their
daily activity levels, Crystal Snuth-
Spangler, one of the members of the
research team at Stanford, had a few
suggestions.
"Persons who are successful in
using pedometers to motivate them
to exercise have commented that it is

like "having a buddy' watch them and
make sure they achieve their person
al physical activity goals," she said.
"Using a pedometer daily provides
instant feedback on whether they
achieve their goal and allows them to
alter their behavior by going on a
longer walk, or walking instead of
driving, if they fall short of their
goal."
ITiough the study did not include
any Stanford students or faculty in its
research, free pedometers were dis
tributed to all incoming freshmen as
part of the Freshman Fitness Chal
lenge in September in an effort to es
tablish healthy activity habits in the
Class of 2011."
Several Stanford faculty members
also use pedometers, including Haas
Center Interim Director Jackie
Schmidt-Posner. She found that using
a pedometer provided her with valu
able feedback about her levels of ac

tivity throughout the week.
"When I was home on the week
end 1 ended up easily walking 10,00()
steps just in the course of daily life —
shopping, carrying laundry up and
down stairs, doing things in the yard,
walking the dog," she said. "But at
work, where I perceive myself as
being up and out of my office a lot, I
could find at the end of the day that I
had only walked 2,400 steps.
"It made me think about how I
could add more activity to my day by
taking the stairs instead of an eleva
tor, walking to a farther away place
on campus for lunch, etc.," she added.
Bravata's study was supported by
a grant from the National Institute on
Aging through the Stanford Center
on the Demography and Economics
of Health and Aging.
