## Ribbon Week combats sexual violence 
### EMMA TROTTER DESK EDITOR 
Last week's White Ribbon Campaign to end
violence against women was "a resounding suc
cess," according to members of Men Against Vi
olence (MAV), who distributed 2.000 ribbons
and fliers in five days.
Men and women were both welcome to take
ribbons, but the campaign was aimed at men in
particular.
"While the majority of men don't commit
acts of sexual assault or relationship abuse, most
acts of sexual assault and relationship abuse are
perpetrated by men." said MAV President and
Founder Jesse Wallin'oB. "This unfortunate real
ity necessitates that men must become involved
in the movement to end violence against women
as our gender is primarily responsible for it.even
if we as individual men are not."
The white ribbons symbolize a variety of

ideals. Wallin noted, and their message must be
recognized.
"It is important to remember that these rib
bons, however, are much more than just a piece
of cloth; they are a pledge never to commit,
condone or remain silent about violence
against women," Wallin wrote in an email to
The Daily.
He added that public displaying the ribbons
is vital to the campaign's message.
"As the week progressed, we saw many of
those white ribbon pledges on backpacks and
bags, so we know that many men on campus
have accepted that pledge," he said. "Such pub
lic display is vital because it sends a strong mes
sage to all that sexual assault, relationship abuse
and all forms of violence against women will not
be tolerated by society."
However, Wallin noted that, in the end, the
issue is not about how many ribbons are handed
out or worn.

"The main message of this campaign, ribbon
or not, is that we can all do something to help
end violence against women," he said, "by mak
ing the personal pledge never to commit, con
done or remain silent about violence against
women."
The campaign was established in 1991 in re
sponse to the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique mas
sacre in Canada; on Dec. 6 of that year, 14
women were killed by an anti-feminist gunman.
During the campaign, which traditionally starts
in late November and lasts until Dec. 6, wearing
a white ribbon signifies opposition to such vio
lence against women.
Because Dec. 6 falls smack in the middle of
Dead Week at Stanford this year, MAV —
which was created last spring and consists of a
core group of six to eight men — decided to hold
the event last week instead.
