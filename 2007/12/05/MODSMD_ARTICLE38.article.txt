## Researchers discover aging-linked gene Mice with disabled gene show thicker skin, more cell division 
### VICTOR CRUZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the School of Medicine have
discovered a genetic switch that can turn back the
clock on skin aging. While principal investigator
Howard Chang, a professor of dermatology, cau
tions that the results are thus far true only in mice,
his team's findings could prove to be a ground
breaking advance in understanding aging.
"Aging is a pervasive process in all kingdoms of
life," Charig said. "We can't go back and treat
someone over their lifetime, so we took mice that
lived a normal life, who were already old. We saw
surprising results in two weeks."
Chang and first author Adam Adler, a post
doctoral student in Chang's cancer biology lab,
found that turning off the NF-kB gene created a
genetic cascade which, in a few weeks, resulted in
thicker skin and increased cell division compared
to controls.
"The NF-kB [gene] acts as a master switch,"

Adler said."[lt] reversed many genetic changes in
old tissue."
ITirough a genetic lens, aging looks like a bunch
of genes either turned on or off in specific "gene
expression patterns." Inhibiting NF-kB promoted
a youthful expression pattern once again in the
skin of old mice.
These findings bolster the hypothesis that aging
is genetically regulated and can thus be inhibited,
contradicting the idea of aging as a process of wear
and tear, said Tiara L. A. Kawahara, post-doctoral
student in cancer biology, who looked at the speci
ficity of the NF-kB mechanism.
Though some press sources are heralding the
discovery as something akin to the fountain of
youth, Kawahara and Adler disagreed.
"Because of the importance of the gene in
other body activities," Kawahara said, "we resist
the idea of blocking the gene for the sake of look
ing younger."
Chang agreed, citing the lack of long-term re
search on even the mice models they have studied.
"We are not aware if the effects are long-last
ing. or if it creates permanent bad consequences,"
he said.
According to Chang, another genetic process
might kick in tocompensate for turning off NF-kB.

Still, the fact that a single gene could have such
a substantial effect gives the researchers hope.
"Aging is a complicated process," Chang said.
"But this study shows there are key switches that
we can toggle for therapeutic benefits."
One possibility for application, according to
Kawahara, could help the skin of elderly people
heal faster after surgery — a common problem in
geriatric medicine.
Chang remained realistic about less helpful,
beautification benefits of the study.
"Pharmaceutical companies currently use topi
cal skin creams that block NF-kB," he said. "But,
they are used] for other purposes. Further study
of NF-kß] on humans depends on safe medicines
because all the tools used in the study were on
mice."
Researchers are concerned about the negative
effects of manipulating this gene, which is critical
to development and normal body function. Still,
people are excited.
"We resist recommending blocking the gene
for the sake of looking good," said Kawahara.
"But my mom keeps saying," Adler added,"'let
me know when you have human trials.'"
