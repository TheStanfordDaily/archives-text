That's right. 1 said sousaphone.
The Roots are a hip-hop band with a
tuba player. And that's what makes
them legendary: since their 1987 in
ception in Philadelphia, The Roots
have worked to bend and re-define
what it means to be hip-hop artists.
The fact that they are a band is unusu
al in itself: most rap groups perform
over pre-recorded beats, with a DJ
providing all instrumentation. The
Roots are also constantly redefining
themselves, giving them a range of
sounds from jazz to funk to straight
hip-hop. The group lives on the cut
ting edge of the hip-hop genre, which
has earned them great respect from
those in the know. It has also made
the band members teachers of style
and precedent-setters; in fact, it

would seem that both of last nights
opening acts — student hip-hop
bands "Von" and "Jidenna the Chief
& the Good Knews Band" — consid
er ITie Roots tine of their main influ
ences. Like The Roots, both of the stu
dent bands delivered stellar perform
ances: Von got the audience moving
and excited, while Jidenna the Chief
blended song and rap beautifully.
Unfortunately,The Roots' exper
iments in hip-hop and their intelli
gent lyrics have perhaps prevented
them from becoming as famous as
they might otherwise be. To their
credit. The Roots seemed to under
stand and accept that, especially at
Stanford, much of their music would
go unrecognized. To counteract this.
The Roots tacked on a riff or lyric
from another famous song to nearly
every one of the songs they per
formed. Again showing their genre
bending, collaborative nature, these
bits and pieces ranged from Jay-Z to
Black Sabbath's "Iron Man."
The highlight of the show, in fact,
was a cover performed by Captain
Kirk, ?uestlove and TUba Gooding,
Jr. of Bob Dylan's "Masters of War."
It was not the show's highlight be
cause of the song itself—in fact,
much of the audience had probably

never even heard of it — but be
cause of the performance. Captain
Kirk did his best Jimi Hendrix, play
ing the guitar upside-down and
walking into the audience, and I\iba
Gooding, Jr. high-stepped his sousa
phone around like he was in a funky
marching band. But neither could
compare to ?uestlove: his several
minute-long drum solo, for which he
was alone on the stage, can only be
described as a virtuoso performance.
His hands began to blur as the sound
of his attacks on the bass drum, the
crash cymbal and the tom-toms res
onated throughout the auditorium.
People wept — well, okay, 1 wept, 1
don't know about anybody else.
After "Masters of War,"The Roots
closed their show with their own
songs, including "Seed 2.0," perhaps
their most widely-known song, as
their encore. Their reception was fit
ting given their high-powered per
formance; students and audience
members cheered on The Roots with
the same vigor and intensity they
used to cheer on the Stanford football
team in its Big Game win over Cal.
Which is appropriate, given that both
the Stanford football players and The
Roots turned in truly legendary per
formances Saturday night.
