## CARD BESTS BUFFS Hill and Goods score 15 in 67-43 win over Colorado 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One Hill stood tallest Sunday in the
Mile-High state.
Junior forward Lawrence Hill
recorded his second career double
double (15 points. 10 rebounds), and
fir>t since November 2006, while junior
guard Anthony Goods added 15 points
on five-of-six three-point shooting to
help defeat Colorado last Sunday in
Boulder. Stanford's height in the mid
dle and a hot second-half start helped
the Cardinal finish its best fall quarter
of the Trent Johnson era at 8-1 with a
67-43 dismantling of the Buffaloes.
The Cardinal blew open its 25-22
halftime lead with a 16-4 run in the first
five minutes of the second half. Goods'
three-pointer seven seconds into the
half started the streak, senior forward
Taj Finger's jumper at the 13:34 mark
capped it and every Stanford starter
scored in between, with junior point
guard Mitch Johnson adding a free
throw, sophomore center Robin Lopez
and Hill a jumper. Goods another
three, and senior forward Fred Wash
ington an and-one layup.
Colorado made just one of eight
shots during that fateful stretch, and so
Stanford led 41-26 with 13 minutes left.
The Buffaloes (5-3) never led after 2-0,
and never were able to cut that 15-
point margin to single figures, despite
16 points from guard Marcus Hall and
10 from guard Cory Higgins.
The Buffaloes finished just 7-20
overall and 3-13 in the Big 12 last year
largely due to their inferior size, and it
showed yesterday. Stanford nearly
doubled up Colorado on the glass (37
rebounds to 19) and the Buffaloes'
frontcourt managed only four points to
Stanford's 35. The Cardinal's defense
was therefore free to vacate the paint
against Colorado's four-guard starting
lineup and pressure the perimeter. It
worked, as Colorado shot just 35 per
cent (15-of-43) to Stanford's 48 percent
(24-of-50) en route to the fewest points
Stanford's allowed since an 82-39 win
over Denver last November.
The game also saw the Cardinal
bench shorten in a way that might re
veal interesting insight into the season
to come.
Nearly a dozen players had factored
prominently in early-season blowouts

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 8-1 on the year, the
team's best start in coach Trent Johnson's four
years. The Cardinal will get a boost with the return
of seven-foot big man Brook Lopez against Santa

until an exhibition match-up against the College

Johnson and Robin Lopez, as well as

reintegration of a soon-to-be academi

Making the challenge that much
more poignant is that how well the Car
