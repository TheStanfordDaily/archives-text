## CARD BESTS BUFFS Hill and Goods score 15 in 67-43 win over Colorado 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One Hill stood tallest Sunday in the
Mile-High state.
Junior forward Lawrence Hill
recorded his second career double
double (15 points. 10 rebounds), and
fir>t since November 2006, while junior
guard Anthony Goods added 15 points
on five-of-six three-point shooting to
help defeat Colorado last Sunday in
Boulder. Stanford's height in the mid
dle and a hot second-half start helped
the Cardinal finish its best fall quarter
of the Trent Johnson era at 8-1 with a
67-43 dismantling of the Buffaloes.
The Cardinal blew open its 25-22
halftime lead with a 16-4 run in the first
five minutes of the second half. Goods'
three-pointer seven seconds into the
half started the streak, senior forward
Taj Finger's jumper at the 13:34 mark
capped it and every Stanford starter
scored in between, with junior point
guard Mitch Johnson adding a free
throw, sophomore center Robin Lopez
and Hill a jumper. Goods another
three, and senior forward Fred Wash
ington an and-one layup.
Colorado made just one of eight
shots during that fateful stretch, and so
Stanford led 41-26 with 13 minutes left.
The Buffaloes (5-3) never led after 2-0,
and never were able to cut that 15-
point margin to single figures, despite
16 points from guard Marcus Hall and
10 from guard Cory Higgins.
The Buffaloes finished just 7-20
overall and 3-13 in the Big 12 last year
largely due to their inferior size, and it
showed yesterday. Stanford nearly
doubled up Colorado on the glass (37
rebounds to 19) and the Buffaloes'
frontcourt managed only four points to
Stanford's 35. The Cardinal's defense
was therefore free to vacate the paint
against Colorado's four-guard starting
lineup and pressure the perimeter. It
worked, as Colorado shot just 35 per
cent (15-of-43) to Stanford's 48 percent
(24-of-50) en route to the fewest points
Stanford's allowed since an 82-39 win
over Denver last November.
The game also saw the Cardinal
bench shorten in a way that might re
veal interesting insight into the season
to come.
Nearly a dozen players had factored
prominently in early-season blowouts

Johnson gave only six players more

Johnson and Robin Lopez, as well as

four fouls. In fact, the only other player

Santa Clara team Dec. 19 and the tipoff
of a vicious Pac-10 season just weeks
thereafter.

more poignant is that how well the Car
dinal will respond is still largely a mys

played an incredibly weak schedule to

the Cardinal's RPI, a key metric in
NCAA selection and seeding, was
a decent 80th before yesterday's
win, and should only climb once
the Pac-10 slate brings up the
strength of schedule.
Just as importantly, the team
had its first strong showing on the
road in three tries yesterday, fin
ished its first strong fall in four

tries under Johnson, and Hill, last
season's All-Pac-10 forward and
team MVP, declared once and for
all his early-season slump is a thing
of the past, with his first double
double since an 84-72 win over UC
Davis last Nov. 28.
As it goes into its two-week hia
tus, Stanford is out-rebounding op
ponents by 13 per game and hold
ing them to just 57 points per con
test on 38.3 percent shooting — all
marks are near the top of the Pac
-10 and significantly better than the
team's numbers last year.

One Hill stood tallest Sunday in the
Mile-High state.
Junior forward Lawrence Hill
recorded his second career double
double (15 points. 10 rebounds), and
fir>t since November 2006, while junior
guard Anthony Goods added 15 points
on five-of-six three-point shooting to
help defeat Colorado last Sunday in
Boulder. Stanford's height in the mid
dle and a hot second-half start helped
the Cardinal finish its best fall quarter
of the Trent Johnson era at 8-1 with a
67-43 dismantling of the Buffaloes.
The Cardinal blew open its 25-22
halftime lead with a 16-4 run in the first
five minutes of the second half. Goods'
three-pointer seven seconds into the
half started the streak, senior forward
Taj Finger's jumper at the 13:34 mark
capped it and every Stanford starter
scored in between, with junior point
guard Mitch Johnson adding a free
throw, sophomore center Robin Lopez
and Hill a jumper. Goods another
three, and senior forward Fred Wash
ington an and-one layup.
Colorado made just one of eight
shots during that fateful stretch, and so
Stanford led 41-26 with 13 minutes left.
The Buffaloes (5-3) never led after 2-0,
and never were able to cut that 15-
point margin to single figures, despite
16 points from guard Marcus Hall and
10 from guard Cory Higgins.
The Buffaloes finished just 7-20
overall and 3-13 in the Big 12 last year
largely due to their inferior size, and it
showed yesterday. Stanford nearly
doubled up Colorado on the glass (37
rebounds to 19) and the Buffaloes'
frontcourt managed only four points to
Stanford's 35. The Cardinal's defense
was therefore free to vacate the paint
against Colorado's four-guard starting
lineup and pressure the perimeter. It
worked, as Colorado shot just 35 per
cent (15-of-43) to Stanford's 48 percent
(24-of-50) en route to the fewest points
Stanford's allowed since an 82-39 win
over Denver last November.
The game also saw the Cardinal
bench shorten in a way that might re
veal interesting insight into the season
to come.
Nearly a dozen players had factored
prominently in early-season blowouts

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 8-1 on the year, the
team's best start in coach Trent Johnson's four
years. The Cardinal will get a boost with the return
of seven-foot big man Brook Lopez against Santa
Clara. The team will be on a two-week respite
until an exhibition match-up against the College
of Idaho on Dec. 16.

ketball landscape. But yesterday. Trent
Johnson gave only six players more
than 11 minutes of playing time — the
starters Washington. Hill, Goods, Mitch
Johnson and Robin Lopez, as well as
sixth man Finger, in relief of the whis
tle-prone Lopez, who finished with
four fouls. In fact, the only other player
to attempt more than one shot was jun

guably the team's best pure shooter.

Tuesday that the honeymoon was now

with considerable challenges upcoming
— a two-week break for finals, the
reintegration of a soon-to-be academi
cally eligible Brook Lopez into the
starting lineup, a visit from a tough
Santa Clara team Dec. 19 and the tipoff
of a vicious Pac-10 season just weeks
thereafter.
Making the challenge that much
more poignant is that how well the Car
dinal will respond is still largely a mys
tery. That's because Stanford has
played an incredibly weak schedule to
date, ranked just 226 th of the nation's

341 Division I-A teams before yes
terday's action. On the other hand,
the Cardinal's RPI, a key metric in
NCAA selection and seeding, was
a decent 80th before yesterday's
win, and should only climb once
the Pac-10 slate brings up the
strength of schedule.
Just as importantly, the team
had its first strong showing on the
road in three tries yesterday, fin
ished its first strong fall in four

tries under Johnson, and Hill, last
season's All-Pac-10 forward and
team MVP, declared once and for
all his early-season slump is a thing
of the past, with his first double
double since an 84-72 win over UC
Davis last Nov. 28.
As it goes into its two-week hia
tus, Stanford is out-rebounding op
ponents by 13 per game and hold
ing them to just 57 points per con
test on 38.3 percent shooting — all
marks are near the top of the Pac
-10 and significantly better than the
team's numbers last year.
