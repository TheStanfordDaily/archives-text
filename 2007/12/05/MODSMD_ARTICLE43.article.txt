# STANFORD SLAMS AGGIES
## Stanford women come out on top against UC-Davis 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
A three-pointer by senior guard Cissy
Pierce gave No. 6 Stanford its first lead
against UC-Davis just two and a half min
utes into Sunday's game, and the Cardi
nal never looked back. Stanford (7-1)
snatched a 62-41 victory over the Aggies
(5-1), winning its fourth straight game
since a 66-54 loss to No. 2 Connecticut on
Nov. 22.
Despite committing eight turnovers in
less than nine minutes, the Cardinal man
aged to build a 14-7 lead. Stanford attrib
uted part of this rocky start to Davis" zone
defense, the first of its kind that the Car
dinal have faced this season.
Junior Jillian Harmon complimented
the Aggies' ability to disrupt the usually
seamless backcourt.
"This was our first look at a zone,"
1 larmon said. "They did a good job trap
ping the guards."
Coach Tara VanDerveer and senior
guard Candice Wiggins, though, echoed a
certainty that improvements will come
from this initial exposure.
"We're going to improve because of
them." said VanDerveer."Their zone was
effective and we made too many
turnovers."
"The good thing about zones is that
they give you open shots," Wiggins said.
"Cissy [Pierce] hit the first three, and I hit
a three after that. I think once we got our
outside game going, it gave us confi
dence... Obviously, we had a lot of
turnovers, but once we got everything
under control and got used to their de
fense, we were able to make a lot of pass
es and score off them."
Wiggins' comment was intended to
draw attention to the four three-pointers
hit by starting guards — Wiggins. Pierce,
and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude — before
seven minutes had ticked off the clock, as
well as to the 20 points contributed by her
fellow guards.
But, one could also use it to reference
the offense produced by the senior her
self: Wiggins made five three-pointers on
the day,outmatching Davis' entire squad,
which shot 3-14 from behind the arc. Wig
gins' long-range shooting set her well on
the way to a game-leading points, 4 as
sists. and 3 steals.
The opening scoring spurt from out
side soon gave way to a slightly steadier
pace in which Stanford utilized its size in
