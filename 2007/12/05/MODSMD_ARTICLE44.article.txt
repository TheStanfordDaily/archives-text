# Men's Basketball
## Break is no holiday for hoops 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
While most Stanford students can
look forward to a nice break fol
lowing their finals week, the
men's basketball team isn't so
lucky. For them, the new year
starts now.
With nearly two weeks until their Dec. 19
matchup against Santa Clara, head coach Trent
Johnson is taking the team back to training camp.
The Cardinal has an exhibition game against The
College of Idaho on Dec. 16 to get sharp, but will be
running hard in practice until then.
After the squad's mid-month tune-up, there will
be no margin for error, as the schedule only gets
tougher from here on out. The Pacific-10 Confer
ence is widely projected to provide the toughest
competition in the nation this season, and Stanford
begins its conference schedule at home against sev
enth-ranked UCLA and No. 24 USC the first week
of January.
"It's pretty much back to preseason," senior for
ward Taj Finger said. "We'll be breaking down the
defense, working on all the little things now on of
fense, really just perfecting everything."
. The Cardinal has not been perfect thus far, but
its record is close. The 8-1 start is the best in Trent
Johnson's four years as head coach. And while Stan
ford's schedule to-date has been considered by
some to be unnecessarily weak, its RPI was up to a
respectable 60 as of Tuesday morning. Early season
wins over UC-Santa Barbara and Harvard look
more legitimate now that the Gauchos are 7-1 and
atop the Big West Conference, while the Crimson
upset Michigan last week.
Johnson, for his part, is not one to be satisfied.
He is pushing the team to get comfortable running
the offense inside and not just settling for the jump
shot. Stanford made only 12 of its 31 three-point at
tempts against Siena,eventually losing to the Saints
on the road 79-67 in the only blemish on this young
season so far.
"We've got to work on not set
tling for threes," Finger said, "just
working the ball inside, working the
offense."
Overall, the Cardinal is shooting
the hall well: ,505 from the field and
.419 from three-point range, marks
that stack up third and second, re
spectively, in the Pac-lO.The name of
the game on offense so far this sea
son has been balance. Four different
players have led the team in scoring
over the first nine games, with An
thony Goods leading the team over
all with 13 per night.
The most encouraging develop
ment on the offensive end has been
the emergence of Robin Lopez. The
seven-foot sophomore, who spent
the summer working on his footwork
in the post, has boosted his scoring
average to 11.4 per game, up from 7.5
last season. His play has allowed
Stanford to continue to run the of
fense in the post while they await the
return of his brother. Brook, due
back from academic ineligibility by
the end of the month.
That the team has gotten off to
such a hot start without their best all
around player in Brook Lopez
makes it impressive, despite con
cerns over the strength of schedule.
And unlike last season, when the
team had to work Lopez back into
the lineup slowly after he missed the
first five games recovering from
back surgery, the sophomore star has
been practicing with the team and
should make a seamless transition
back. He'll reportedly come off the
bench to start, but it will be interest
ing to see if Johnson can keep his sec
ond seven-footer off the court for
too long.
"It'll be nice to have Brook back,"
senior forward Fred Washington
said. "It will be nice to have a bigger
body on the boards, and he's a good
low post scorer."
On the defensive end, Johnson
had told his team to crack down on
dribble penetration. There's an ele

ment of pride involved. Finger said,
in one-on-one defense.
"You've got to take it upon your
self and not let your man beat you."
he said.
For Washington, arguably the
team's best one-on-one defender,
there is still plenty to work on. His
lock-down defense on Colorado
guard Richard Roby played a critical
role in Stanford's 67-43 win over the
Buffaloes on Sunday, but Washing
ton said the team's defense still has a

ways to go.
"We still have a couple of let
downs a game that we need to work
on," he said.
According to the numbers, how
ever. the team is doing pretty well.
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 re
bounding margin and defensive field
goal percentage, outrebounding its
opponents by more than 13, on aver
age, and holding them to 38.3 per
cent shooting from the field. In scor
ing differential — one of the most

telling statistics of how well a team is
playing — Stanford again is tops in
the league with a 21.4 margin. Con
ference powerhouses UCLA and
Washington State, however,are close
behind at 19.9 and 19.7, respectively.
"Everyone's been playing well,
buying into defensive concept," Fin
ger said. "Hopefully we can keep it
up."
