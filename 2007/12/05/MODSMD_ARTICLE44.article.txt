# Men's Basketball
## Break is no holiday for hoops 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
While most Stanford students can
look forward to a nice break fol
lowing their finals week, the
men's basketball team isn't so
lucky. For them, the new year
starts now.
With nearly two weeks until their Dec. 19
matchup against Santa Clara, head coach Trent
Johnson is taking the team back to training camp.
The Cardinal has an exhibition game against The
College of Idaho on Dec. 16 to get sharp, but will be
running hard in practice until then.
After the squad's mid-month tune-up, there will
be no margin for error, as the schedule only gets
tougher from here on out. The Pacific-10 Confer
ence is widely projected to provide the toughest
competition in the nation this season, and Stanford
begins its conference schedule at home against sev
enth-ranked UCLA and No. 24 USC the first week
of January.
"It's pretty much back to preseason," senior for
ward Taj Finger said. "We'll be breaking down the
defense, working on all the little things now on of
fense, really just perfecting everything."
. The Cardinal has not been perfect thus far, but
its record is close. The 8-1 start is the best in Trent
Johnson's four years as head coach. And while Stan
ford's schedule to-date has been considered by
some to be unnecessarily weak, its RPI was up to a
respectable 60 as of Tuesday morning. Early season
wins over UC-Santa Barbara and Harvard look
more legitimate now that the Gauchos are 7-1 and
atop the Big West Conference, while the Crimson
upset Michigan last week.
Johnson, for his part, is not one to be satisfied.
He is pushing the team to get comfortable running
the offense inside and not just settling for the jump
shot. Stanford made only 12 of its 31 three-point at
tempts against Siena,eventually losing to the Saints
on the road 79-67 in the only blemish on this young
season so far.
