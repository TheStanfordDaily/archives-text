## Basketball by the numbers 
### SCOTT BLAND 
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball
team sports a 7-1 record heading into the
end of its non-conference schedule. Here
are some other numbers about the Car
dinal to keep in mind when evaluating
the first stage of its season:
3— rhe number of players averaging double
digits in points on the roster, which is the same as
last year. Freshman Kayla Pedersen (11.9 points
per game) has done very well stepping inside and

gins (15.4 ppg) has been her typically prolific self,
and sophomore center Jayne Appel has taken
Brooke Smith's old minutes and run with them,
leading the team with 16.6 points per game.
.238 — The alarmingly-low three-point shoot
ing percentage. For the first few games of the sea
son it looked like Stanford's long-range game
would see a healthy improvement this year, but
things have gone south dramatically since then.
Sophomore point guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
has the best success rate on the team, despite
shooting an anemic .292 from behind the arc. Wig
gins, however, hit 5-of-10 in her most recent game,
rhe Cardinal is hoping she can keep that up and
drag the squad out of its current funk.
5 — The number of those seven wins that have
come away from the friendly confines of Maples
Pavilion. Stanford has done it on the road thus far
this season, starting with a tough trip (and a victo
ry) to last season's national runners-up, Rutgers,
and a ITianksgiving trip to the Virgin Islands, with
a stop to Utah on the way. The Cardinal spent its
first three weeks on the road, which can only help
the team's development going forward.
120/112 — The team's assist-to-turnover ratio
(1.07 for those of you who like decimals). By com-
