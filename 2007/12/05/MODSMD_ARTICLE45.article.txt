## Basketball by the numbers 
### SCOTT BLAND 
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball
team sports a 7-1 record heading into the
end of its non-conference schedule. Here
are some other numbers about the Car
dinal to keep in mind when evaluating
the first stage of its season:
3— rhe number of players averaging double
digits in points on the roster, which is the same as
last year. Freshman Kayla Pedersen (11.9 points
per game) has done very well stepping inside and
contributing in her rookie season. Candice Wig
gins (15.4 ppg) has been her typically prolific self,
and sophomore center Jayne Appel has taken
Brooke Smith's old minutes and run with them,
leading the team with 16.6 points per game.
.238 — The alarmingly-low three-point shoot
ing percentage. For the first few games of the sea
son it looked like Stanford's long-range game
would see a healthy improvement this year, but
things have gone south dramatically since then.
Sophomore point guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
has the best success rate on the team, despite
shooting an anemic .292 from behind the arc. Wig
gins, however, hit 5-of-10 in her most recent game,
rhe Cardinal is hoping she can keep that up and
drag the squad out of its current funk.
5 — The number of those seven wins that have
come away from the friendly confines of Maples
Pavilion. Stanford has done it on the road thus far
this season, starting with a tough trip (and a victo
ry) to last season's national runners-up, Rutgers,
and a ITianksgiving trip to the Virgin Islands, with
a stop to Utah on the way. The Cardinal spent its
first three weeks on the road, which can only help
the team's development going forward.
120/112 — The team's assist-to-turnover ratio
(1.07 for those of you who like decimals). By com-
parison. the Cardinal's A/TO line
last season was 1.21, on a team that
played with freshman point guards
for the entire season. Stanford will
need to take better care of the ball
and make more simple baskets if
the team is to climb into the top tier
of women's college hoops. Granted,
both point guards this season are

coming off of ACL tears, but less
than half the roster is above the
even 1/1 mark.
2 — The number of season-end
ing knee injuries the Cardinal has
suffered already. Forward Michelle
Harrison went down (left ACL)
four minutes into her season in the
first game against Yale, and point
guard Melanie Murphy also tore
her left ACL at the Paradise Jam
tournament over Thanksgiving
break. ACL injuries are basically an
epidemic in women's basketball

right now, and it is a shame to see
players have their seasons robbed
that way. Harrison's injury also
makes Stanford light in the front
court, especially with freshman for
ward Ashley Cimino yet to play this
season due to another injury.
544 — The (staggering) number
of wins head coach Tara Van-
Derveer has on the Stanford side
lines. She will undoubtedly make it
to 550 this season. A more interest
ing question is whether or not Van-
Derveer can pick up career victory

number 700 this year, which would
take a 31-win season. The Cardinal
has at least 26 wins in each of the
last six seasons, so the real issue on
the table is whether or not this is a
team that will return to the late
stages of the NCAA tournament. It
has some issues, but there is so much
talent on this team and VanDerveer
has proven to be such a good coach
that the squad certainly has a
chance.
