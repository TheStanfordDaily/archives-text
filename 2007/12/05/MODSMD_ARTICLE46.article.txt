# Sights set on Sacramento
## Stanford two wins away from third Final Four in four years 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In December 2004, Frunci Girard and
Bryn Kehoe were celebrating a national
championship win over Minnesota.The mid
dle blocker and setter for the top-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball team, now sen
iors, are hoping to see their final season on
the Farm end the same way that their first
did.
Hie pair had their season end early as
sophomores, losing in the second round
when the Cardinal was depleted by injuries,
including a broken hand that prevented
Kehoe from setting. Last year, Stanford re
turned to the Final Four in top form, but lost
a four-game match to Nebraska. A rematch
between the two teams, the top seeds in the
2007 postseason, would be the perfect end to
this season in the minds of the seniors.
The Cardinal had little trouble advancing
to the Sweet Sixteen this past weekend and
will host three teams it has already beaten
this year in this weekend's Stanford Region
al. Stanford beat No. 16 Cal Poly in a presea
son tournament in Maples and recorded two
victories over Oregon and No. 8 UCLA in
the Pac-10, with a sweep and a four-game
win over each.
"You can say you've played a team al
ready in the season, but playoffs brings out
something entirely different in every team,"
junior outside hitter Cynthia Barboza said
after Saturday's win. "Just because we beat
them before doesn't mean really anything."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will be hosting the Stanford
Regional, which also features Cal Poly, UCLA and Ore

last weekend, other top seeds have not fared
so well. No. 6 Washington, No. 7 Wisconsin,
No. 9 Kansas State, No. 11 Hawaii, No. 14
Colorado State and No. 15 Dayton all lost on
Saturday night, leaving one Regional with
only one seeded team.The Stanford Region

AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Foluke Akinradewo improved her nation-leading hitting percentage in Stanford's subregional
wins last weekend. The Cardinal hosts Cal Poly, Oregon and UCLA in this week's Regional.
"(There were] some amazing up
sets." head coach John Dunning said
in a press conference on Saturday.
"It's just a sign of parity in the sport.
There are so many good teams.
[Sacramento State head coach]
Debby Colberg and I were talking
about that before the match.
Women's volleyball is amazing —
the number of good players and the
skill level — all the teams are
good."
Stanford is not short on tradition
— with NCAA titles in 1992, 1994,
19%. 1997,2001 and 2004 — and is
having one of its best seasons in
Dunning's tenure. Coming into the
playoffs, the Cardinal had lost only
twice, the fewest since the 2001
championship season.
If the Cardinal can win twice this
weekend, the team will travel 126
miles to Sacramento's Arco Arena
at the end of finals week for the

third Final Four of Kehoe and Gi
rard's career. ITie winner of the
Stanford Regional will face the win
ner from the Florida Regional in
one semifinal match while the
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Re
gional winners will face off in the
other.
The Florida Regional has all four
seeded teams still in the mix. with
the Elite Eight most likely featuring
No. 4 Texas and No. 5 Southern Cal
ifornia.
No. 3 Penn State is the only seed
ed team left in the Pennsylvania Re
gional — this weekend's upsets
were concentrated on the opposite
side of the bracket from Stanford —
while No. 2 Nebraska will need to
get past Michigan and likely No. 10
California to get to Sacramento.
The next team standing in Stan
ford's way on the road to Sacramen
to is Cal Poly (23-7). The Mustangs,
who beat Xavier and then Purdue in
subregional play, are in the Sweet
Sixteen for the first time since 1985.
Hie Cardinal has played Cal Poly 10
times before, with six wins including
one in September of this year.

Stanford swept that match be
hind 15 kills at a .636 clip by junior
middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo. Kylie Atherstone led the Mus
tangs with 12 kills in that match
and is the offensive leader this sea
son.
Awaiting the winner of the Stan
ford-Cal Poly match will be either
Oregon or UCLA. The conference
foes split their matches in Pac-10
play,each winning at home. Most re
cently, the Ducks swept the Bruins
in Eugene.
Oregon came back from a two
game deficit to upset Kansas State
in Kansas last week. Gorana Mari
cic spearheads the Ducks' attack
and gave the Cardinal some trouble
earlier this season, averaging more
than five kills per game against
Stanford.
The Bruins swept Alabama
A&M and beat Clemson in four
games in their subregional. Ali
Daley and Kaitlin Sather are tied
for the team lead in kills while setter
Nellie Spicer is second only to
Kehoe in assists per game in the
Pac-10.

Regardless of how the season
ends. 2007 will be a season to re
member for the Cardinal, and
Kehoe and Girard will have left
their mark on the program. Kehoe
broke the career assists record ear
lier this season, despite missing
seven matches and not setting in
two more in 2005.With 5,701 assists
to date. Kehoe has surpassed the old
mark by nearly 700 and will have
even more by season's end.
Akinradewo has amassed an
otherworldly .498 hitting percent
age on the season, demolishing the
Pac-10 single season record of .44tS
and closing in on the NCAA record
of .504. Freshman libero Gabi Ailes
has anchored the Cardinal's floor
defense all season and is only 34
blocks shy of the Stanford single
season record set by Kristin
Richards'o7 in 2006.
Stanford will play in Friday
night's second match, scheduled to
begin at 9 p.m. with Saturday's Re
gional final set for 8:30 p.m.
