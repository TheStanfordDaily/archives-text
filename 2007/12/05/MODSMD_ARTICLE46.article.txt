# Sights set on Sacramento
## Stanford two wins away from third Final Four in four years 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In December 2004, Frunci Girard and
Bryn Kehoe were celebrating a national
championship win over Minnesota.The mid
dle blocker and setter for the top-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball team, now sen
iors, are hoping to see their final season on
the Farm end the same way that their first
did.
Hie pair had their season end early as
sophomores, losing in the second round
when the Cardinal was depleted by injuries,
including a broken hand that prevented
Kehoe from setting. Last year, Stanford re
turned to the Final Four in top form, but lost
a four-game match to Nebraska. A rematch
between the two teams, the top seeds in the
2007 postseason, would be the perfect end to
this season in the minds of the seniors.
The Cardinal had little trouble advancing
to the Sweet Sixteen this past weekend and
will host three teams it has already beaten
this year in this weekend's Stanford Region
al. Stanford beat No. 16 Cal Poly in a presea
son tournament in Maples and recorded two
victories over Oregon and No. 8 UCLA in
the Pac-10, with a sweep and a four-game
win over each.
"You can say you've played a team al
ready in the season, but playoffs brings out
something entirely different in every team,"
junior outside hitter Cynthia Barboza said
after Saturday's win. "Just because we beat
them before doesn't mean really anything."

Colorado State and No. 15 Dayton all lost on
Saturday night, leaving one Regional with
