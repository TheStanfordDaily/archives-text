well. Freshman Alix Klineman had a team
high 19 kills on .425 hitting as well as seven
blocks in Stanford's 30-20,30-28,30-27 win.
"1 think the biggest thing for me tonight
was to be patient with myself," Klineman said
of her first NCAA match. "I can get frustrat
ed pretty easily and I just focused on giving
back to my team. I think our team played
pretty well. We had a few hiccups, but for the
most part. I think we executed very well
today."
Stanford built a five-point lead early in the
first game against the Broncos and then saw
it balloon to eight at 15-7 behind kills by three
different hitters. The Cardinal finished the
game with a three point run — a block by
Klineman and junior middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo. another by Akinradewo and
junior right side Erin Waller and a service ace
by senior middle blocker Franci Girard.

at the start of the second game, but Stanford
broke a 10-all tie with a 5-1 run. Santa Clara
did not back off, battling back to tie the game
again at 25. The Cardinal never let the Bron
cos take the lead and put the game away with
an Akinradewo kill.

the third game, Santa Clara came back with
five straight points to take the lead.The Bron
cos stayed ahead by a point or two until
Klineman came alive. Down by a point at 20-
19. Stanford strung together six points in a
row — two kills and three solo blocks by
Klineman and a kill by Akinradewo. Santa
Clara could not bounce back, and Girard
ended the match with a kill.

only eight hitting errors. Brittany Lowe had a
match-high 20 kills for the Broncos.

five. The Broncos' Taylor O'Brien finished
with a match-high 15 digs while freshman

kill to end the 30-11 game.

big thing." coach John Dunning said.
"We've been playing well in game
one. |but| in game two. we some
times let the intensity drop, and I
thought we played great in Game
two. In game three. I think that Sac
State just raised their level and put
pressure on us."
The Hornets came out of the
locker room with renewed intensity
in the third game and made the Car
dinal earn its sweep. The Hornets'
Missie Stidham capped a four-point
run with an ace to take the lead for
the first time in the match at 12-11.
