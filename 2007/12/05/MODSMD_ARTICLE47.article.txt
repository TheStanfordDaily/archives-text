## Sweep to Sweet Sixteen 
### REBECCA HARLOW 
On a night when six seeded teams
were upset, the top-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball
team did not falter after follow
ing a first-round win over Santa
Clara with a victory over Sacramento State
on Saturday night.The pair of sweeps puts the
Cardinal into next week's Stanford Regional,
where the team will host three familiar oppo
nents in Cal Poly, Oregon and No. 8 UCLA.
Sacramento State (29-8) beat Minnesota
(18-13) in the first match Friday to earn a spot
in Saturday's second round and the Cardinal

well. Freshman Alix Klineman had a team
high 19 kills on .425 hitting as well as seven
blocks in Stanford's 30-20,30-28,30-27 win.
"1 think the biggest thing for me tonight
was to be patient with myself," Klineman said
of her first NCAA match. "I can get frustrat
ed pretty easily and I just focused on giving
back to my team. I think our team played
pretty well. We had a few hiccups, but for the
most part. I think we executed very well
today."
Stanford built a five-point lead early in the
first game against the Broncos and then saw
it balloon to eight at 15-7 behind kills by three
different hitters. The Cardinal finished the
game with a three point run — a block by
Klineman and junior middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo. another by Akinradewo and
junior right side Erin Waller and a service ace
by senior middle blocker Franci Girard.

at the start of the second game, but Stanford
broke a 10-all tie with a 5-1 run. Santa Clara
did not back off, battling back to tie the game
again at 25. The Cardinal never let the Bron
cos take the lead and put the game away with
an Akinradewo kill.
After Stanford took an early 11-8 lead in
the third game, Santa Clara came back with
five straight points to take the lead.The Bron
cos stayed ahead by a point or two until
Klineman came alive. Down by a point at 20-

row — two kills and three solo blocks by
Klineman and a kill by Akinradewo. Santa
Clara could not bounce back, and Girard
ended the match with a kill.
