### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
While the Stanford football team
was taking back the Axe on Saturday
evening, the No. 3 Stanford women's
swimming and diving squad was dom
inating the pool in the final day of the
Texas Invitational in Austin, Texas. In
the end, the Cardinal fell short of No.
4 Arizona, who won the meet with 859
points to second place Stanford's 768.
However, the Cardinal swimmers and
divers went out with a bang, winning
the last four events of the meet.
After sophomore Julia Smit
placed second in the 200-yard back
stroke behind Kirsty Coventry, the
2004 Olympic gold medalist in that
event, the Card responded with con
secutive wins from senior Brooke
Bishop in the 100 freestyle, junior
Caroline Bruce in the 200 breast
stroke, sophomore Elaine Breeden in
the 200 butterfly and a team of fresh
man Kate Dwelley, Smit, junior Fiona
O'Donnell-McCarthy and Bishop in
the 400 freestyle relay.
The relay squad of Dwelley, Smith.
O'Donnell-McCarthy and Bishop not
only represented all four classes, but
also broke a long-standing school
record.The previous record was set in
1993 by a relay team including 12-
time Olympic medalist Jenny Thomp
son and current head swim coach and
Olympian, Lea Loveless Maurer.
Maurer commented on the team's
building momentum throughout the
final day, which culminated in the
breaking of her own school record.
"1 am very proud of the team," said
Maurer."We got better every day.and
I know we are leaving this meet with a
lot of things to build on as we contin
ue our charge together for a great
team effort in March [at the NCAA
Championships] and June [at the 2008
Olympic Trials]."
The Stanford divers finished on a
high note as well, led by freshman
Meg Hostage who won the platform
diving event on the final day of the

meet. Hostage and second place fin
isher sophomore Shana Karp were
followed by freshman Hallie Ivester,
senior Katie Lampe and sophomore
Carmen Stellar, who all placed in the
top eight. Hostage also took home a
pair of third place finishes in the one
meter and three-meter diving events.
"Overall I am very pleased with
how the girls performed," Stanford
diving coach Dr. Rick Schavone told
Gostanford.com. "Meg [Hostage]
and Shana [ Karp] did a great job with
their first and second place finishes.
Having four in the top eight [in the
platform], with one being a win, was a
great way to end the meet."
Other events won by the Card in
the three-day meet included the 4(X)
individual medley, in which Sniit
dominated the rest of the field by over
5 seconds,and the 1 (X) butterfly, which
Breeden won with an NCAA auto
matic qualifying time of 52.74.
The wins were no easy feat for the
Cardinal, who competed not only
against Pac-10 foe No. 4 Arizona, but
against other top 20 teams including
No. 16 University ofTexas,No. 17 Ari
zona State and No. 19 Wisconsin.
Breeden, the 200 butterfly champi
on at last season's NCAA Champi
onships, was proud of her teammates'
efforts despite being exhausted from
workouts.
"Overall. I think the team did bet
ter this weekend than anyone expect
ed "said Breeden."We are in the mid
dle of some of the season's hardest
training, and the team was tired going
into the competition. But we swam
some great races and achieved sever
al life-time bests."
As the final competition before
the regular dual meet season begins in
January, the meet served as an early
opportunity to qualify swimmers for
the NCAA Championships in March.
