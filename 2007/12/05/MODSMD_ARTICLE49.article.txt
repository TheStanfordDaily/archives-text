The Stanford men's swim and dive team took
fifth place at the Texas Invitational last week in a
competition held on the University of Texas cam
pus in Austin.
Texas captured the title with 704 points, Ari
zona took second with 610.5 points and Long
horn Aquatics finished third with 393 points.The
Invitational featured several U.S. Olympic team
members in action. For the Cardinal, junior cap
tain Nate Cass is on the national team for the 200
intermedley and 200 breast while junior Paul

Zaich is competing in the 200 breast.
One of the bright spots for the Cardinal was
freshman Brent Lichenseer's continued streak of
solid performances as he finished in second on
the platform event with a score of 314.45.
Fichenseer has placed in the top three at Junior
Olympic Nationals twice and also has interna
tional experience. I le is Stanford's only freshman
diver, complementing junior Dwight Dumais,
senior Nathan Kim. and junior Casey Weston.
Kim earned a fourth place finish with a score of
284.10 for platform.
The big names of college swimming were all in
action at the Texas Invitational including top
ranked Texas. No. 2 Arizona. No. 3 Stanford. No. 6
Tennessee, and No. 25 Southern Methodist. The
competition brings in strong sprint squads, which
are the key to garnering big points on the 4x50
free, 4xloo free, 4x50 medley, and 4xloo medley
relays.

Stanford's top backstroker. sophomore Eu
gene Godsoe, firmly established himself as one of
the nation's premier 100 and 200 backstrokers
last weekend, when he earned fourth place with a
NC AA "B" cut of 1:44.00. Godsoe is also the
starting backstroker for the 4x50 medley and
4xloo medley relays, and swims on the sprint
freestyle events. Josh Charnin-Aker turned in a
preliminary time of 1:49.18 and Scott Lathrope
also swam a 1:52.53.
Stanford's strong 100 free squad turned in
quick times as junior Jason Dunford finished
eleventh with a 43.85, and freshman Austin Staab
followed closely behind with a time of 43.97 in
twelfth place. Senior Daniel Beat, who is trying
his hand at sprinting this year and vying for a
place on the 4xloo free relay, turned in a time of
44.92 during Saturday's morning preliminaries.

"At this point of the season, the
team is focusing on the little things
that will help us at Pac-10 [champi
onships] and NCAA [champi
onships] like attacking our turns, un

derwaters, and hard kicking," Korn
feld explained.
"1 am always looking for ways to
help the team reach and exceed its
potential. Our team goal is for the
whole team to get [its] best times at
the end of the season."
Stanford had five competitors in
the 200 fly as freshman David
Mosko finished in 1:45.92 in fourth
place. Josh Charnin-Aker in 11th
place with a time of 1:48.38, sopho
more Sven llinrichsen in 18th place
at 1:48.98 and Scott Lathrope in 25th

place with his mark of 1:49.95.
Stanford won't be back in action
until next year on Jan. 25 at Avery
Stadium, when it faces Arizona
State. The near two-month layoff
will give the team a good block of
time to train and adjust strokes with
out interrupting meets, until the
spring when they will be tapered,
shaved and swimming towards Pac
-10 championships, which start on
March 5.
