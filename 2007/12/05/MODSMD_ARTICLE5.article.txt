## Hospital expansion plans get initial O.K. Palo Alto consultant approves preliminary construction plans 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
A major hurdle has been cleared in the Stan
ford Medical Center's proposed expansion.
Though Stanford Hospital & Clinics (SHC) is still
negotiating with the city of Palo Alto regarding

the construction process, an outside consultant
has approved the University's initial proposals.
Marlene Berkoff, an experienced architect
hired by the city to evaluate the Hospital's pro
jected expansion, has given initial approval to the
project's logic and appropriateness of size.
"We're very pleased" said Shelley Hebert. ex
ecutive director of public affairs for SHC. "We
think her preliminary findings validate what the
Hospital has proposed."
Berkoff evaluated Stanford's project in a larg
er context.

"I compiled lots of comparable data from re
cent projects that had been built." Berkoff said.
"As well, 1 looked at other projects in the works.
Looking at Stanford's project relative to others. I
was really working on the level of a room-by
room comparison. My investigation showed that
yes. [Stanford plans] were in line with what these
types of projects require."
Stanford seeks to renovate the existing "Hos-
pital Modernization Project" — a
1980s addition that is still referred
to by this name — and Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital. The
Medical Center also aims to con
struct a new main building for SHC
that will replace a structure that
dates back to the 19505.
The size of Stanford's proposed
expansion, totaling 1.3 million
square feet, has raised concerns in
Palo Alto, both in terms of building
height and traffic impact. In her
evaluation, Berkoff paid special at
tention to ensure that the proposed
space requirements were indeed
necessary.
"Having looked at the space pro
gram so far, there's not a lot of fat to
cut, without cutting into the number
of beds or some critical clinical pro
grams," she said. "The things you
would typically look to cut — too
many conference rooms, for in
stance — just aren't there.
"Looking at the property, there
needs to be some rationality in func
tional relevance," Berkoff added.
"Nursing units need to be a certain
size, for instance. Too big and they
don't really work, and smaller you
wind up with a number of beds that

isn't operationally efficient."
From Stanford's perspective,
one of the benefits of the expansion
is addressing current problems of
overcrowding.
"The very highest priority for Stan
ford is to expand the emergency de
partment," Hebert said. "The Hos
pital is the only Level-1 trauma cen
ter between San Francisco and San
Jose, and we're exceeding our ca
pacity to care for people."
Berkoff will continue to assess
the project as Stanford hammers
out the details. The city and Stan
ford Medical Center hope to reach
a development agreement by the
end of 2008.
"Stanford has to present the al
ternatives it explored and explain
why the one they selected is the
best," Berkoff said in an email to
The Daily. "It is my job to look at
those alternatives and assess
whether or not Stanford has realis
tically studied the alternatives and
that their reasons for rejecting them
are valid — from a medical and ar
chitectural planning perspective."
But Berkoff saw a consistent
basis for the project.
"There's a need for an update
and a need for more space," she
said. "If you accept the need, then
the project makes sense."
