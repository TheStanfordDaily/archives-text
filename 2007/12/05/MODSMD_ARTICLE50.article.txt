# Stanford goes out on top
## Big Game caps season with four times '06 win total 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After a jubilant postgame scene subsided
following Stanford's 20-13 Big Game victory
over Cal — the program's first such win
since 2001 —the last players to leave the
locker room were senior receivers Mark
Bradford and Evan Moore and sophomore
quarterback Tavita Pritchard. Perhaps no
three players illustrate better where the Car
dinal have been this season, and where the
team is heading going forward.
Bradford and Moore may be the most no
table of the Cardinal's seniors who played

out their final season with Stanford.The duo,
who went out on a winning note against the
Golden Bears, were part of a truly mystify ing
season for first year head coach Jim Har
baugh. winning games against then-No. 2
USC on the road and Cal at home, but being
thoroughly dominated by the likes of UCLA
and Washington. It all led to a confusing 4-8
finish, that somehow has led coaches, players
and fans alike to believe that good things
may be just around the corner for this Stan
ford team.
It is certainly undeniable that the positive
effects of the win over the Bears were both
immediate and profound.
"It's so special," Harbaugh said. "Just the
great thrill of winning, the thrill of ultimate
victory, getting that Axe back here at Stan
ford. [I'm] very pleased for our players, that's
the thing that gets me the most."
And that's an effect that should be carried

forward into the 2008 season according to
the Cardinal coach who is a rookie no more.
"No question, this definitely helps our
program," Harbaugh said. "It's a statement
on how far our program has come and that
we know how to win and have what it takes
to win."
Aside from the loss of the steady receiv
ing presences of Bradford and Moore, Stan
ford will certainly miss the contributions it
received from the likes of center Tim Mat
tran. defensive end Udeme Udofia, corner
backs Tim Sims and Nick Sanchez, quarter
back T.C. Ostrander, punter Jay Ottovegio,
defensive tackle Chris Horn, kicker Derek
Belch and guard Mikal Brewer, among oth
ers. But it is undeniable that the Cardinal has
plenty of key pieces to the puzzle returning
for 2008.

Senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander started in the Big Game and split time with Tavita Pritchard in the 20-13 win. Ostrander went 1 6-for-23
with 151 passing yards and threw a touchdown pass to Mark Bradford for the first points of the game, in which the Cardinal never trailed.
