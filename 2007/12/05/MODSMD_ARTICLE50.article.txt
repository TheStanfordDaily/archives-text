# Stanford goes out on top
## Big Game caps season with four times '06 win total 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After a jubilant postgame scene subsided
following Stanford's 20-13 Big Game victory
over Cal — the program's first such win
since 2001 —the last players to leave the
locker room were senior receivers Mark
Bradford and Evan Moore and sophomore
quarterback Tavita Pritchard. Perhaps no
three players illustrate better where the Car
dinal have been this season, and where the
team is heading going forward.
Bradford and Moore may be the most no
table of the Cardinal's seniors who played

out their final season with Stanford.The duo,
who went out on a winning note against the
Golden Bears, were part of a truly mystify ing
season for first year head coach Jim Har
baugh. winning games against then-No. 2
USC on the road and Cal at home, but being
thoroughly dominated by the likes of UCLA
and Washington. It all led to a confusing 4-8
finish, that somehow has led coaches, players
and fans alike to believe that good things
may be just around the corner for this Stan
ford team.
It is certainly undeniable that the positive
effects of the win over the Bears were both
immediate and profound.
"It's so special," Harbaugh said. "Just the
great thrill of winning, the thrill of ultimate
victory, getting that Axe back here at Stan
ford. [I'm] very pleased for our players, that's
the thing that gets me the most."
And that's an effect that should be carried

forward into the 2008 season according to
the Cardinal coach who is a rookie no more.
"No question, this definitely helps our
program," Harbaugh said. "It's a statement
on how far our program has come and that
we know how to win and have what it takes
to win."
Aside from the loss of the steady receiv
ing presences of Bradford and Moore, Stan
ford will certainly miss the contributions it
received from the likes of center Tim Mat
tran. defensive end Udeme Udofia, corner
backs Tim Sims and Nick Sanchez, quarter
back T.C. Ostrander, punter Jay Ottovegio,
defensive tackle Chris Horn, kicker Derek
Belch and guard Mikal Brewer, among oth
ers. But it is undeniable that the Cardinal has
plenty of key pieces to the puzzle returning
for 2008.

Senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander started in the Big Game and split time with Tavita Pritchard in the 20-13 win. Ostrander went 1 6-for-23
with 151 passing yards and threw a touchdown pass to Mark Bradford for the first points of the game, in which the Cardinal never trailed.
Left tackle Allen Smith, who
missed much of the 2(X)7 season with
an injury, should return to the team
sometime this summer, and right
guard Alex Fletcher has also decided
to return for his senior season. Along
with center Bert Mcßride, who filled
in admirably for Mattran at times this
year, and right tackle Chris Marinelli,
who was the only Stanford lineman to
start every game for the Cardinal this
season. Harbaugh appears to have a
solid and experienced offensive front
returning to the Farm.
That front will be paving the way
for a talented group of running
backs, including Toby Gerhart. who
will be a sophomore yet again for the
Cardinal after suffering a season
ending injury against San Jose State
early in the year. Stanford's leading
rusher. Anthony Kimble, will also re
turn as a senior, while Stanford's
most dangerous vertical threat in the
passing game — sophomore
Richard Sherman — will be asked to
shoulder more of the load as the of
fense's primary receiver. And. of

course, there is Pritchard. the star of
the USC win, who will be a junior
next year
Given the Cardinal's most recent
success, the prospect of moving for
ward is something Pritchard is very
excited about.
"We'll just use this as a spring
board for those offseason workouts
and the conditioning program and
spring ball." he said. "It's huge get
ting people excited about this team
and what we're capable of. and it's
huge learning how to win a game like
this. We've lost some big ones this
year, won some big ones, and to win a
game like this it's big for us. learning
how to win and carrying that over."
Key playmakers will return for
the defense as well, with the Cardi
nal's most significant losses coming
in the secondary, where the absence
of Nick Sanchez and Tim Sims could
pose a problem matching up with the
dynamic receivers of the Pac-10.
Still, even those who have played
their last down for the Cardinal seem
to be excited about the future of the

program following the crazy highs
and lows of 2007.
"As far as the attitude, it's 100 per
cent different," senior quarterback
T.C. Ostrander told the San Jose
Mercury News. "We have a lot of tal
ent coming back, and I'm expecting
big things."

and senior punter Jay Ottovegio
were all awarded All Pac-10 Second
Team I lonors for their efforts in the
2007 season. Ottovegio finished his
Stanford career with the all-time
Cardinal record for punt yardage
(not necessarily a good thing), while
Fletcher paved the way for Stan
ford's rushing attack in 11 games this
year. Osaisai earned All Pac-10 hon
ors for the second season in a row
thanks to his strong special teams

passing game — sophomore
Richard Sherman — will be asked to
shoulder more of the load as the of
fense's primary receiver. And. of

course, there is Pritchard. the star of
the USC win, who will be a junior
next year
Given the Cardinal's most recent
success, the prospect of moving for
ward is something Pritchard is very
excited about.
"We'll just use this as a spring
board for those offseason workouts
and the conditioning program and
spring ball." he said. "It's huge get
ting people excited about this team
and what we're capable of. and it's
huge learning how to win a game like
this. We've lost some big ones this
year, won some big ones, and to win a
game like this it's big for us. learning
how to win and carrying that over."
Key playmakers will return for
the defense as well, with the Cardi
nal's most significant losses coming
in the secondary, where the absence
of Nick Sanchez and Tim Sims could
pose a problem matching up with the
dynamic receivers of the Pac-10.
Still, even those who have played
their last down for the Cardinal seem
to be excited about the future of the

program following the crazy highs
and lows of 2007.
"As far as the attitude, it's 100 per
cent different," senior quarterback
T.C. Ostrander told the San Jose
Mercury News. "We have a lot of tal
ent coming back, and I'm expecting
big things."

year. Osaisai earned All Pac-10 hon
