Unlike other polls, this one controls for differences in schedule and ranks on actu
al strength. Teams aren't ranked on their win-loss records, but whether they
could beat the team below them.

1. Ohio State 1 Took a lot of flack for ranking Ohio State and LSU 1-2 last week
and...
2. LSU 2 ..for keeping VT, OU, Georgia high after disappointing losses. The
proven-name schools have better talent...
3. USC 4 ...and better players don't always win, but it's a darn good way to
bet. Early BCS guess: Ohio State 24, LSU 17.
4. Georgia 5 Team that got screwed. Humans vault Oklahoma and LSU over
Bulldogs, why again? Oh, because it's not actually...
5. Virginia Tech 6 ...about consistently ranking teams, it's about engineering the de
sired BCS title game, a la last year (Florida was chosen over Michi
gan).
6. Oklahoma 7 VT, OU also got jobbed. The anti-playoff camp's explanations are
jokes — just admit the BCS and bowls are all a money grab.
7. West Virginia 3 The loss of one great player can't cripple 0 defense — that's why
our top six teams all boast solid Ds.
8. Florida 9 Gators take on Wolverines, but I think they would have preferred a
shot at Zook's lllini.
9. Arizona State 10 Year after year, the Holiday is the nation's best non-BCS bowl. Sun
Devils against Texas this year should be no different.
10. Missouri 8 AwholebunchofangryMissouriansowemyinboxanapology.ru
say it again — pick defense and proven teams.
11. Kansas 11 Jayhawks are laughing their tails (feathers?) off after beating out
rival Tigers for last BCS slot, despite head-to-head loss.
12. Boston College 12 Couldn't miss Flutie's smile on ESPN as Ryan's late-season col
lapse preserves his spot as BC's all-time greatest.
13. Illinois 13 One of many Cinderella BCS teams, but look for the big boys (LSU,
VT, Georgia, Oklahoma, USC) to win those bowl games.
14. Wisconsin 14 I know, they were 11-1 last year, but doesn't it seem like Wiscon
sin goes 9-3 or 8-4 every season? Always good, never great.
15. Texas 15 Great week for 'Horns — Franchione resigns from rival Texas
A&M, archrival Sooners miss out on BCS Title Game.
16. Tennessee 17 I believe this now brings Phil Fulmer's record to 1 -14 in games of
significance. Maybe Les Miles could loan him the trucker hat.
17. Clemson 19 With a strong recruiting class coming in and the ACC in a marked
down cycle, maybe Clemson finally peaks in '08.
18. Auburn 20 Plays that Clemson team in my favorite bowl game — the always
exciting, always close Peach Bowl with great commercials.
19. Oregon 18 Probably should drop further after "Cal"ing their final three, but
Oregon State's underrated and Ducks were missing Dixon.
20. Hawaii 16 How do you spot Washington a 21-0 Ist Q lead in the biggest
game of your program's history, only to come back for the W?
21. Boise State 21 Coach Chris Peterson is the hottest mid-major coach in the game
today. Wonder if he jumps to SEC, Michigan or Wazzu?
22. Cincinnati 22 Quietly won nine games this year playing in the Big East.
23. Virginia 23 Other bowl picks: Utah, Memphis, Cincinnati, New Mexico, BYU
(big), Boise State, Purdue, Texas, Boston College, TCU...
24. BYU 25...Oregon State, Wake Forest, Mississippi State, Texas A&M, Al
abama, Cal, Georgia Tech, South Florida, Florida State...
25. Arkansas 24 ... Indiana, Auburn, Wisconsin, Missouri, Texas Tech, Florida, Rut
gers and Tulsa. Let's hope Stanford's on this list next year.
