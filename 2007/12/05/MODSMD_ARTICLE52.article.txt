# Big Game win a true team effort
## Unselfishness characterizes final game of Harbaugh's first season 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SEASON TWO MINUTE DRILL
PLAY OF THE YEAR
Trailing by six on fourtfi and goal, first time starter Tavita Pritchard lofted o fade pass to
the front left corner of the L A. Coliseum's east end zone Mark Bradford separated from the
defender and hauled in the football, lifting the 41 point underdogs to a 24-23 win for ages
against national powerhouse Southern California.
PLAYER OF THE YEAR
Several players to choose from, but for game-in, game out production sophomore line
backer Clinton Snyder gets the nod. He finished the season as the team leader in sacks (8),
forced fumbles (4) and was second in tackles (96) and tackles for loss (14.5). His explo
sive performances playing through a series of shoulder injuries keyed a feiocious attacking
defense under coordinator Scott Shafer.
IT WAS OVER WHEN
The overflowing Red Zone student section flooded the field after the team's first win over
archrival Cal since Tyrone Willinghom was head coach in 2001. It took Stanford three
coaches and six tries to wrest the Axe from the hands of Jeff Tedford's powerful California
program.
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT
Playing with "an enthusiasm unknown to mankind" in the words of head coach Jim Har
bough, Stanford put a team on the field that never quit. New faces were confidently sent
into the ballgame and performed admirably. Multiple coaching staffs noted that film study
showed o team that played 60 minutes of football.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT
Injuries again locked the roster, destroying offensive consistency in games an even moder
otely healthy Stanford might have won. While maddening, the iniuries did give valuable
experience to young players who will be important contributors in future seasons.
UNSUNG HEROES
The punter long snapper combination of Jay Ottovegio and Brent Newhouse were perfect
on the year, with zero bad snaps or blocked punts. They also worked together getting the
ball down for placekicker Derek Belch. Ottovegio graduates as the school's all time leader
in punts and punting yardage
COACH OF THE YEAR
Besides Harbaugh, who confidently assembled a staff and gracefully handled a quarter
back controversy, the work of offensive line coach Chris Dalman deserves commendation.
A Cordinal alumnus who coached at his high school alma mater and in the NFL, Dalman
retooled a shellshocked offensive front into a cohesive, effective unit that was able to per
form with up to three starters out at limes during the season.
KEY STAT
Stanford won four games, an unqualified success coming off of a 111 2006 campaign
THEY SAID IT
"We bow to no man, we bow to no progiam at Stanford University." -Coach Huibaugh in
spring 2007, declining to retract comments he had made regarding the job status of USC
coach Pete Carroll Harbaugh's words proved to be prophetic on Oct. 6 ogainst the Trojans
in Los Angeles.

On the way out the back door of a tailspinning season,
California linebacker Worrell Williams left the press with
a parting shot aimed at the celebrating Stanford team,
who had just beaten the Bears for its first Big Game win in
six years.
"It's not like they're the better team. They're not.
There's no way no how. You guys know that, everybody
knows that," Williams said.
Williams may be half right. The best group of players
didn't win, but the best team — on Saturday, at least —
definitely did.
In the Stanford football office hang a series of motiva
tional banners. One of them shouts a phrase copped from
Jim Harbaugh's college coach, Michigan legend Bo
Schembechler:"The team,the team, the team." It was that
ethos that was on display Saturday from start to finish.
It was difficult to pick a player of the game — not be
cause no one stood out, but because everyone in the game
played well. Stanford let Cal make all the mistakes: turn
ing the ball over three times, going away from a very suc
cessful running game and drawing flags like they were
Christmas bows.
With a mistake-prone performance on tap from the
opponent, Stanford went to work with two weapons;
teamwork and unselfishness.
Unselfishness was Richard Sherman displaying none
of the "throw it to me!" antics that led to a personal foul
against Washington and a subsequent suspension by the
coaching staff. Despite his only catch being wiped off the
board in favor of an accepted defensive penalty, Sherman
could be seen smiling and celebrating with his teammates.
Teamwork was Derek Belch, having missed eight kicks
in the last three games, being sent out for. 1 le nailed two
lead-taking field goals, the second one putting the Cardi
nal ahead for good.
Unselfishness was receiver Evan Moore accepting a
reduced role in Big Game but celebrating as his friend
Mark Bradford racked up timeless highlights.
Unselfishness was Brent Newhouse long-snapping in
anonymity to the school's career leader in punting, help

ing Jay Ottoveggio extend a record his name won't be at
tached to but wouldn't be possible without him.
Teamwork was the defense going back on the field to
snuff out a final Cal drive inside the Stanford 10-yard line.
Nick Sanchez's final career interception made up for Jere
my Stewart's fumble that gave the Bears one more
chance.
Both traits were on display with the two-quarterback
rotation ofT.C. Ostrander and Tavita Pritchard. With the
playcalling taking advantage o their respective skills and
keeping Cal off balance, each threw a touchdown pass in
the ballgame and neither forced plays in an attempt to
outdo the other. The masterful coaching moves wouldn't
have been possible without both players accepting their
limited roles for the good of their 1(X) teammates.
And unselfishness goes all the way to the top; as defen
sive coordinator Scott Shafer flirts with Northern Illinois
about its open head coaching position — possibly open
ing a devastating hole on Stanford's football staff —
Shafer's boss has made it a positive, saying in as many
words that he hopes his staff is of a quality that gets them
that kind of attention.
It all goes back to Schembechler's dictum — no play
er. and no coach, is more important than the team.
California, for its part, went down as a team. It started
before the Bears lost a game, with the underproduction of
early-season I leismanTrophy candidate DeSean Jackson.
The dam broke after their first loss, to Oregon State — at
home no less — after a huge mental mistake by the back
up quarterback deprived Cal of a chance to tie up the
score.
It reached critical mass against Arizona State, when
Jackson lost his cool in the face of an injured Nate Long
shore's inability toget him the ball. It became resigned dis
belief as the Bears flagged out against the bottom of the
Pac-lO.The Stanford animus of the Cal fan base went un
quenched. Now a school known for vehement activism of
the hard left variety is forced into a bowl game sponsored
by the US. military.
Meanwhile, Stanford has an improved four-win season
to build upon, a bumper crop of recruits to reel in, and an
unorthodox split spring practice to undertake next year.
As for Worrell, he might do well to take advice from
the movies: losers whine about their best while Nicholas
Cage went home with the prom queen. On Saturday, Stan
ford went home — with the Axe.

BIG GAME TWO MINUTE DRILL
PLAY OF THE GAME
Defensive bellcow Clinton Snyder got around the edge on Cal's first drive and stripped quarterback Nate
Longshore, recovering the fumble himself at the Cal 28 I.C. Ostrander found Mark Bradford for a touch
down on the next play and the Cardinal never let up
PLAYER OF THE GAME
Cornerback Nick Sanchez Playing in his final gome, the senioi collected another game breaking moment
foi his highlight teel, picking oH two passes in the louith quarter to go with loui tackles, a pass bieakup
anif a quarteiback hurry.
TURNING POINT
A penalty laden three and out sequence for Cal in the thud quarter set Stanford up at the Bears 41. Four
plays later junior tight end Austin Gunder's second career touchdown leception extended the Cardinal's lead
to 20-10, enough breathing room for its hrst Big Game win in six years.
IT WAS OVER WHEN
Mark Bradford's 37-yard tightrope reception was ruled in bounds with less than two minutes remaining
Hod the bang bong play been overturned, Cal would have been in position to get the ball back with a time
out trailing by seven points. Instead, the Bears got one desperation play off before the Cardinal repossessed
the Axe and the students rushed the field
CARDINAL HIGHLIGHT
Senior T.C. Ostrandei and sophomore Tovita Pritchard, rotating continuously ot quarteiback, each threw a
touchdown pass without missing a beat in continuity or leadership. The offensive coaches always knew
when to make the switch and deftly deployed separate packages that took advantage of each quarterback's
skills.
CARDINAL LOWLIGHT
A poorly executed reverse option pass thrown by Bradford was intercepted, a key turnover right after Cal
had tied the game at/.
MOST QUESTIONABLE DECISION
With Longshore hobbling on a leg injury and Col's receivers having o tough time catching the ball with the
game in the balance, Bears running bock Justin forsett — who had rolled up 96 yards on 19 rushes —
got all of teio carries on Cal's last thiee drives forsett entered the gome leading the Pac 10 in rushing and
looked unstoppable in early oction, but didn't touch the ball in a stretch ol 19 game deciding ploys
KEY STAT
Cal was 1 in turnover margin. The Bears lost every game this season in which they gave the ball away more
than their opponent
