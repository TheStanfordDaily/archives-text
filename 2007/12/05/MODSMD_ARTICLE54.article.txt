## Tigers land Willis, Cabrera from Marlins Fish get six-player package that includes Miller, Maybin 
### RONALD BLUM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — One swift move, two
new stars. The Detroit Tigers are loading up for
another run at the World Series, this time with
Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis.
Detroit reached a preliminary agreement
TUesday to acquire Cabrera and Willis from the
Florida Marlins for a package of six players, an
unexpected blockbuster trade that developed
quickly at the winter meetings.
"I'm glad we're in the other division," Red
Sox manager Terry Francona said. "That lineup
just got scary."
In a huge deal that took the spotlight away
from Boston's pursuit of Johan Santana, Florida
gets lefty Andrew Miller, outfielder Cameron
Maybin and four other prospects from theTigers,
a baseball official with knowledge of the talks
said on condition of anonymity because the trade
had not yet been finalized.
The Marlins also receive catcher Mike Rabe
lo and right-handers Burke Badenhop. Eulogio
De La Cruz and Dallas Trahern. The players in
volved must pass physicals for the deal to be
completed.
"It's very serious, but nothing is finalized yet
because some issues need to get worked out,"
Tigers manager Jim Leyland told The Associated
Press.
Cabrera, an All-Star in each of the past four
seasons, would join an imposing lineup that al
ready includes Magglio Ordonez, Gary
Sheffield. Ivan Rodriguez, Curtis Granderson
and Placido Polanco. The Tigers also acquired
shortstop Edgar Renteria.a five-time All-Star, in
a trade with Atlanta this offseason.
Willis, the 2(K)3 NL Rookie of the Year and a
two-time All-Star, is coming off a down year in
which he went 10-15 with a 5.17 LIRA. He would
be part of a solid rotation with Justin Verlander,
Kenny Rogers and Jeremy Bonderman as De
troit tries to reach the World Series again after
losing to St. Louis in 2006.
Florida didn't even approach theTigers until
Tuesday morning. The Marlins told the Tigers
they could have both stars for those six players.

then Detroit called back about two hours later
and agreed, the baseball official said.
"If it does happen, obviously they're getting
two very good players," said Yankees manager
Joe Girardi, who managed the Marlins in 2006.
"Miguel Cabrera is one of the finest hitters in
the game. He can do so many things with a bat,
whether you want him to hit a home run for you,
you want to hit and run, work the count, get on
base. And Dontrelle Willis has been one of the
premier lefties in the National League."
Willis was on vacation when he heard the
news.
"I'm in Mexico right now with my family. I'm
kind of busy," he told the AP.
Detroit had not been considered a contender
for Cabrera or Willis. Both can become free
agents after the 20W season.
Cabrera and Willis were the last players left
from Florida's 2(X)3 championship team. Unable
to secure a new ballpark, the Marlins keep shed
ding players when they are due to earn huge
salaries. Cabrera made $7.4 million this year and
Willis $6.45 million. Both were eligible for arbi
tration and likely to receive raises.
"1 halfway expected one of them to get trad
ed. but not both in the same deal. So it's a little bit
of a shock," Marlins left fielder Josh Willingham
said. "It's deflating."
In return, the Marlins get a pair of highly rated
prospects: Maybin was the l()th pick in the 2005
amateur draft and Miller was selected sixth over
all the following year.
The 24-year-old Cabrera made 23 errors this
season at third base.To make room for him. it ap
pears Detroit could trade third baseman Bran
don Inge or left fielder Marcus Thames. Cabrera
played the outfield in 2004 and 2(X)5.
The Los Angeles Angels had pursued Cabr
era for weeks.The Marlins didn't give the Angels
a last chance.
"The deal they appear to have reached,
they felt was a better lit for them," Angels gen
eral manager Tony Reagins told a pool re
porter.
Boston, meanwhile, was focused on Santana,
Minnesota's two-time Cy Young Award winner.
Finding the price too high, the Yankees ended
their efforts to acquire the 28-year-old left-han
der.
Yankees senior vice president Hank Stein
brenner had set a Monday deadline for an agree
ment with the Twins.
"A deadline is a deadline. It was pretty much

done as of this morning," he said Ibesday. "He's
a fine pitcher, hut there's a lot of things that go
into this.This isn't fantasy baseball."
Boston had offered the Twins packages built
either around pitcher Jon Lester or outfielder Ja
coby Ellsbury.but not both.
"1 know there's a lot of speculation that we're
close to something big," Red Sox general manag
er Theo Epstein said. "Until we reach an agree
ment. then we're not that close."
New York had proposed pitcher Phil Hughes
and center fielder Melky Cabrera. The Ttoins
dropped their demand that pitcher lan Kennedy
be included, but the sides couldn't agree on a
third player.
"To tell you the truth, toward the end. Min
nesota negotiated in good faith.They really did."
Steinbrenner said. "1 have no problem with
them."
I\vins general manager Bill Smith wouldn't
discuss the talks specifically.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — One swift move, two
new stars. The Detroit Tigers are loading up for
another run at the World Series, this time with
Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis.
Detroit reached a preliminary agreement
TUesday to acquire Cabrera and Willis from the
Florida Marlins for a package of six players, an
unexpected blockbuster trade that developed
quickly at the winter meetings.
"I'm glad we're in the other division," Red
Sox manager Terry Francona said. "That lineup
just got scary."
In a huge deal that took the spotlight away
from Boston's pursuit of Johan Santana, Florida
gets lefty Andrew Miller, outfielder Cameron
Maybin and four other prospects from theTigers,
a baseball official with knowledge of the talks
said on condition of anonymity because the trade
had not yet been finalized.
The Marlins also receive catcher Mike Rabe
lo and right-handers Burke Badenhop. Eulogio
De La Cruz and Dallas Trahern. The players in
volved must pass physicals for the deal to be
completed.
"It's very serious, but nothing is finalized yet
because some issues need to get worked out,"
Tigers manager Jim Leyland told The Associated
Press.
Cabrera, an All-Star in each of the past four
seasons, would join an imposing lineup that al
ready includes Magglio Ordonez, Gary
Sheffield. Ivan Rodriguez, Curtis Granderson
and Placido Polanco. The Tigers also acquired
shortstop Edgar Renteria.a five-time All-Star, in
a trade with Atlanta this offseason.
Willis, the 2(K)3 NL Rookie of the Year and a
two-time All-Star, is coming off a down year in
which he went 10-15 with a 5.17 LIRA. He would
be part of a solid rotation with Justin Verlander,
Kenny Rogers and Jeremy Bonderman as De
troit tries to reach the World Series again after
losing to St. Louis in 2006.
Florida didn't even approach theTigers until
Tuesday morning. The Marlins told the Tigers
they could have both stars for those six players.

then Detroit called back about two hours later
and agreed, the baseball official said.
"If it does happen, obviously they're getting
two very good players," said Yankees manager
Joe Girardi, who managed the Marlins in 2006.
"Miguel Cabrera is one of the finest hitters in
the game. He can do so many things with a bat,
whether you want him to hit a home run for you,
you want to hit and run, work the count, get on
base. And Dontrelle Willis has been one of the
premier lefties in the National League."
Willis was on vacation when he heard the
news.
"I'm in Mexico right now with my family. I'm
kind of busy," he told the AP.
Detroit had not been considered a contender
for Cabrera or Willis. Both can become free
agents after the 20W season.
Cabrera and Willis were the last players left
from Florida's 2(X)3 championship team. Unable
to secure a new ballpark, the Marlins keep shed
ding players when they are due to earn huge
salaries. Cabrera made $7.4 million this year and
Willis $6.45 million. Both were eligible for arbi
tration and likely to receive raises.
"1 halfway expected one of them to get trad
ed. but not both in the same deal. So it's a little bit
of a shock," Marlins left fielder Josh Willingham
said. "It's deflating."
In return, the Marlins get a pair of highly rated
prospects: Maybin was the l()th pick in the 2005
amateur draft and Miller was selected sixth over
all the following year.
The 24-year-old Cabrera made 23 errors this
season at third base.To make room for him. it ap
pears Detroit could trade third baseman Bran
don Inge or left fielder Marcus Thames. Cabrera
played the outfield in 2004 and 2(X)5.
The Los Angeles Angels had pursued Cabr
era for weeks.The Marlins didn't give the Angels
a last chance.
"The deal they appear to have reached,
they felt was a better lit for them," Angels gen
eral manager Tony Reagins told a pool re
porter.
Boston, meanwhile, was focused on Santana,
Minnesota's two-time Cy Young Award winner.
Finding the price too high, the Yankees ended
their efforts to acquire the 28-year-old left-han
der.
Yankees senior vice president Hank Stein
brenner had set a Monday deadline for an agree
ment with the Twins.
"A deadline is a deadline. It was pretty much

done as of this morning," he said Ibesday. "He's
a fine pitcher, hut there's a lot of things that go
into this.This isn't fantasy baseball."
Boston had offered the Twins packages built
either around pitcher Jon Lester or outfielder Ja
coby Ellsbury.but not both.
"1 know there's a lot of speculation that we're
close to something big," Red Sox general manag
er Theo Epstein said. "Until we reach an agree
ment. then we're not that close."
New York had proposed pitcher Phil Hughes
and center fielder Melky Cabrera. The Ttoins
dropped their demand that pitcher lan Kennedy
be included, but the sides couldn't agree on a
third player.
"To tell you the truth, toward the end. Min
nesota negotiated in good faith.They really did."
Steinbrenner said. "1 have no problem with
them."
I\vins general manager Bill Smith wouldn't
discuss the talks specifically.
