## Cruisin' campus Cops discuss Stanford policing efforts in RIDE-ALONG PROGRAM 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Lights flashing,siren blazing, we chased after the car
and pulled over the driver. The vehicle had sped
past us and was headed straight into a one-way
street in the wrong direction. Patrol Deputy for the
Department of Public Safety (DPS) A 1 James jumped into
action.
"That was very dangerous," he said afterwards. "We
could have just witnessed a serious head-on collision, but
luckily we didn't.That was an arrestable offense, but 1 only
gave her a citation."
Many students criticize the police force on campus for
being too strict on minor offenses that they consider to be
mere inconveniences. Some, for instance, feel that parking
a bike in the wrong place or biking without a light at night
are silly reasons to get stopped and ticketed. But what is it
really like to be a police officer at Stanford?
The Ride-Along Program allows students to ride in the
passenger seat of a police car and patrol campus with a
deputy. 1 decided to go on a ride to try to uncover some of
the myths and facts firsthand.
"The Ride-Along Program is offered to the Stanford
community to give them greater insight into the pubic safe
ty issues that affect campus," said Melissa Dubois, senior
program manager for the community outreach program of
DPS. "Our goal with all of our community outreach pro
grams is to create a dialogue with the community, maintain
open lines of communication, provide educational materi
als and programs and assist residents in reducing the oppor
tunity for crime."
I was assigned to ride in a large police SUV with James
for a two-and-a-half-hour shift on a TUesday afternoon. As
he introduced himself to me, the first thing 1 noticed was a
large shotgun in the back of the vehicle along with other po
lice equipment. James soon explained the gun's presence.
"We are the police force that will provide the primary,
initial response to any situation," he said."lf there is a situ
ation such as the shootings in Virginia Tech, we will be the
first ones on the scene to deal with it. We provide a service
to the community in the form of general patrol activities
and law enforcement."
So just how many police officers are there? Can we ex
pect them to be hiding around every corner, waiting to tick
et unsuspecting students?
"On the day shift, there are usually three vehicles pa

trolling the area, and during the big party nights there are
usually more," James said."But on the whole, there are not
that many cops on the street. So we want people to be our
ears and eyes. Call us. Get the word out. Utilize us."

When asked why the police feel the need to enforce
certain rules, apart from the fact that they are the law,
James explained that the safety element was a strong
motivation.

"We feel like we have failed if we need to take
individuals to the hospital for injuries that could
have been easily avoided," he said.

Do the police always give students ticket?
for running stop signs? No, James said. What
about biking without a light at night? Not al
ways. There is some discretion involved on

the part of the police officer. Instead of ac
tively clamping down on students, some
times officers can just give individuals
warnings. These warnings are not

recorded and only serve to educate the
individual about the error made.
However, James pointed out that if
an offense is egregious enough, then
the individual will definitely be tick
eted.

"It's about finding the right balance
and determining what to do in each
unique situation," he said.

During the ride, James explained some of
the things a police officer monitors while pa

trolling: smoke, traffic problems and conspicuous indi
viduals who don't appear to belong in residential areas. Of
ficers also usually keep their windows down at all times so
that they can hear sounds on the street as well as any calls
for help.
The police force also deals with the darker side of law
enforcement work. Domestic violence, suicides, mental ill
nesses, assaults and even murders are not unknown to offi
cers at Stanford. James said the last murder he could recall
occurred in the late 19905.
"Stanford is a relatively safe place for your personal
body," he said. "Hut that is not necessarily the case for your
property â€” property theft is rampant on campus."
The patrol also took me to the outskirts of the campus,
to areas where few students venture. The "faculty ghetto,"
as it is affectionately called,contains more than a thousand
homes where faculty and staff members can live. We passed

by
"Hannah

I louse," designed
by Frank Lloyd

Wright; the house of former Secretary of State George
Schultz; and President Hennessy's current residence, the
Lou Henry Hoover House.
"As you can see. the campus is huge," James said. "Sim
ply patrolling around the houses takes over an hour to go
through."
James said that in his 16 years at Stanford, he has become
very familiar with the campus.
"If there is a car on campus that 1 haven't seen before, I will
