December 10,1980:
Cyclists cross country to
fund conservation
Two thousand five-hundred miles
of mountains, deserts, and endless
cornfields - that's what two Stanford
students cycled across this summer
to raise money for student energy
projects.
Sophomores Rich Hefter and
Mike Siegel obtained hundreds of
penny-a-mile pledges totaling more
than $10,000 for their month-long,
pedal-pushing pilgrimage to their
home in Wilmette, Illinois.
According to Hefter, the two de
cided to make the trip last fall.
"Mike is really interested in biking.
He was taking Italian and saw
Breaking Away .When he brought up
the idea last fall, I said, 'OK, let's
go-'"
The two approached Paul Ed
dwards of the Office of Develop
ment ith questions about fundrais
ing procedures.
"I ended up teaching them a
course in fundraising techniques,"
says Edwards. "They learned how to
write grant applications and how to
appeal to organizations to back
them."
The two left campus at the end of
exam week and headed almost im
mediately into the toughest cycling
territory.
"Going over the Sierras was
physically the hardest part of the
trip. But it was near the beginning
and our excitement level was high. It

was a real challenge," said Hefter.
The least enjoyable stretch for
the two cyclists was through the
state of Nebraska. According to
Hefter, lit was hot and humid and
seemed to go on forever.i But
Hefter notes that ithe people there
and all along our trip were great.!
lWe would go into a Dairy Bar
along the way and people at the
counter were not strangers. People
would realize we werenit just your
average motorists,! says Hefter.
Nor was the hospitality they en
countered just friendliness.
iWhen we told them what we
were doing, motel managers and
people we met all along would put us
up a night for free,! says Hefter.
The money will go into a student
project fund providing cash to stu
dent-conceived conservation
projects.
