PHI BETA KAPPA
Seniors: Winter Quarter is your last chance
TO TAKE CLASSES TO QUALIFY FOR PHI BETA KAPPA
A Message from Phi Beta Kappa,
Stanford Chapter
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the
excellence and breadth of their undergraduate scholarly
accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of
California) is open to undergraduates of all majors. To be elected to Phi
Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve academic distinction in
the major as well as in courses across a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about one fifth are chosen in their
junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines define breadth of study as excellence
beyond the major field. To be considered for election, a student must
have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring Quarter,
at least three courses at Stanford in each of the following three major
domains of knowledge: Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math;
and Social Sciences. To be considered for election, students who
transfer in their junior year must have taken at least two courses at
Stanford in two of these major domains and at least one in the third
domain, and must have completed a minimum 75 units of academic
work at Stanford by the end of Winter Quarter.
A grade of"+" or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally
satisfying the "breadth" criterion is not considered a sign of distinction.
Consult page 722 of the Bulletin for full Phi Beta Kappa information.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no
special action is required for students wishing to be considered for
membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal
of students' names from their academic records before consideration.
