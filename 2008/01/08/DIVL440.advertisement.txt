This is a practical introduction to the investigation of archaeological sites: it is a "dig."
While the course will present an overview of the range of research techniques Used by archa- +
eologists, the main focus of effort is on the selection and application of appropriate techni- "
■■■ ques to a real case: the exploration of the ruin of the Men's Gymnasium that collapsedjn the ««
great earthquake of 1 906. Students, working in_ research teams, will develop research ques
tions and design sampling methods to address those questions prior to applying those met- 'VM
hods in the excavation of the ruin. Research topics Way include^ for examplej the Structural
failure of the building, the architectural materials arid finishes, We expression of ideas of > —-
health and hygiene in the building, and the social context of its construction. There is a rich*
archival record for the building which will also be available for investigation.
