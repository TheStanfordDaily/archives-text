J Everyone talks about race and ethnicity, but what are they
really talking about? Going to school and work, renting
an apartment, buying a house, watching television, voting,
listening to music, reading newspapers, attending religious
services, and going to the doctor are all ordinary, everyday
activities that are saturated with widespread assumptions
about race and ethnicity —assumptions that influence who
counts, who to trust, who to care about, who to include,
and why. This multi-disciplinary team-taught course treats
race and ethnicity as historically-derived and institutionalized
ideas and practices that are given tangible and visible form in
the structures of our society, as well as in people's everyday
beliefs and attitudes. It examines race and ethnicity in
the U.S. and abroad and is organized around lectures by
faculty from History, Psychology, English, Sociology, Biology,
Political Science, Drama, Education, Anthropology and other
disciplines. NB: Fulfills GER DB. SocSci and EC. AmerCul.
