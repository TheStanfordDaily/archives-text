## Editorial Board Priming for primaries 
### 
Some have argued in recent years, that the
presidential primaries have become in
creasingly unfair and, more alarmingly,
increasingly detached from true democracy.
Nearly all of us can agree that it is more im
portant to elect a president based on his/her
leadership skills rather than his/her wealth.
For the past decade, however, the primaries
have shifted dramatically forward in the cam
paign cycle and the process has become more
money-centric, thus all but eliminating under
funded dark-horse and underdog candidates,
who may possess the talents and qualities to
be president but lack the funds.
Meanwhile, the voters are also short
changed, as states battle for the earliest pri
maries. While every state's citizens deserve
the personal attention that presidential candi
dates give to voters in key early states like
lowa and New Hampshire, most Americas
will not hear a candidate — Democrat or Re
publican, front-runner or underdog — in per
son this year.
Yet, even as candidates pour seemingly
endless amounts of money into their cam
paigns in a relatively small number of states,
we can sense a kind of democracy at work.
Before voters in electoral giants like New
York and California vote in the Feb. 5 "Super
Tuesday" primaries, voters in states as diverse
as lowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina,
Nevada and Florida will make their choices
— and with the vast amount of attention paid
to the residents of these early primary states,
we can rest assured that these voters will
make relatively well-informed decisions.
One lowan told reporters that he saw a
candidate speak 27 times before last weeks
caucuses. That sort of access — while slightly
overbearing — gives voters the chance to re
ally get to know the candidates and make a
well-educated decision. It is this kind of pro
longed face time in early primary states that
levels the uneven playing field caused by the
often-vast money gap that separates the
prominent candidates from the more obscure
ones.
While Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.)
does not lack funds and his victory in lowa last

week did not come as a surprise to many, the
Republican winner of the Hawkeye State,
Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, was vastly out
spent in lowa by former Massachusetts Gov
ernor Mitt Romney, whom he soundly defeat
ed in the polls. In lowa, money did not buy the
caucuses.
Tonight, the country turns its eyes to New
Hampshire, where Obama and Huckabee
will look to build on their lowa success, while
their rivals will look to capture some momen
tum of their own in the Granite State.
The system's detractors would argue that
lowa and New Hampshire voters are unrep
resentative of the rest of the country. Maybe
they are; but at least they are unrepresenta
tive in different ways and. thus, oddly repre
sentative of Americans as a whole.
lowa is an overwhelmingly white state
with fiercely liberal Democrats and socially
conservative Republicans. New Hampshire
— whose state motto is, famously, "Live Free
or Die" — is a haven for independents who
are rabidly antitax. Another early primary
state. South Carolina, has a higher percentage
of black voters than most other states in the
Union.
Our electoral system has its flaws, to be
sure, but with such an eclectic mix of states in
volved in the early primary season, the Amer
ican people should be comforted to know that
a wide array of voters are making informed
decisions this month.

The Editorial Board would like to remind
readers to stay involved with politics, both
local and national. Californians vote on Feb. 5
and must register to do so by Jan. 22. Califor
nia registration forms as well as absentee bal
lots — for those who wish to vote in their
home states — can be obtained from either
the Stanford Democrats (http://www.stan
forddems.com/register-to-vote or email the
campus director at sbaimel@stanford.edu) or
the Stanford College Republicans (email the
president and campaign relations director at
cjkelm@stanford.edu). Another option for
absentee voters is http://www.sos.ca.gov/elec
tions/elections m.htm.
