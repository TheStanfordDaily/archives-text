# Pleading Inanity
## The
						'L' word, part deux 
### 
I'm sorely conflicted about ringing in the
New Year so quickly with you. dear read
er. On the one hand, my absence from
you has only intensified the fond longing in
my heart; on the other hand. 1 completely
support all of my comedic writing col
leagues who continue their extended vaca
tion with the Writers Guild of America.
riiat being said. 1 must return to the
printed word because I don't want any of my
make-up artists, lighting technicians or
fluffers to lose their jobs. I will, however,
warn you that this column will bear a strik
ing dissimilarity from my previous work,
since I must refrain from presenting "any
portion of written material [that] is custom
arily written by striking writers." And that,
my friends, means no monologues, charac
ters or featured appearances.
What does that leave us with? Just you
and I. Or. is it just you and me? Crap. Help!
l ime to focus. Ok.
I spent my holiday break in the small
rural town of Uniontown, Penn. My parents
moved there just before I left for college. To
add to the isolation of not having any friends
in the area, U-town is in one of the reddest
counties in a state that has been aptly de
scribed as "Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with
Mississippi in the middle."
By the way. if you have trouble remem
bering which states are red and which are
blue, try this jiffy: in red states, very little is
read save TV Guide. In blue states, the
cheese that is on peoples' Lavhosh crackers
(served to them by illegal aliens to whom
they just granted amnesty) is blue — or, as
they would have you spell it — bleu.
Now. in the midst of small town Ameri
cana solitude, 1 sought two outlets for com
pany, each with its own pleasures and pit
falls: books and the boob-tube.
Let's start with the TeeVee. Television is
great because it elucidates how my multi
tudinous maladaptive mannerisms are pre
venting me from realizing my supposed
dreams. In short, it dictates how I need to be
spending my student loans. Last year I was
moved to buy a case of Corona to help me
attract Latina women, Rosetta Stone soft
ware so I can speak Spanish to these Latina
women, and a Cialis prescription for, appar
ently, the option of being ready fast or hav
ing up to 36 hours to relax and take my time.
This year I watched a bit less Univision
(alas, my love for "Amar sin Limites" knows

no hounds), and, while still suffering the sub
conscious trauma of self-imposed withdraw
al, I grew to appreciate how I could also share
TV-happenings with Americans worldwide.
Whenever I found myself at the ol' waterhole
with Joe or Jane, it was a treat to share a light
hearted moment bantering about that
episode of "Deal or No Deal" we both saw
where multi-racial women boldly yelled 'No
Deal!' to that silhouette of a miserly banker,
followed by a 45-minute commercial break
that reminded us to buy that product quick
before the blowout sale ended.
Now, to television's obscure antipode.
What is this "book" 1 speak of, you ask?
Does it bear some relation to the Facebooks
from which you fill your bank of spank? Or
the Starbucks from which you purchase
eggnog lattes and Surawesi coffee?
Short answer: no. To find out what a book
really is, click http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Book (Print readers: you can
scratch-and-sniff the link for the same effect).
Top advantage of books over TV: no
commercials. Plus, after reading for a couple
of hours, my brain feels refined and sophis
ticated. Then again, since it's a thoroughly
solitary act, reading books to combat loneli
ness is like doing coke to combat insomnia.
Just doesn't make much sense.
Man, about here is where my writers
would help me finish in a semi-meaningful
way. I'm exhausted. So many words for one
woman to produce. Pni going to bed.
Ciadsbudlikins! I never finished this?
Here goes nothing.
Books and TV are both viable options to
counter isolation, but each seems to leave
something very important out. Maybe this
year I should try a more obvious remedy for
loneliness: people. That way I could put this
case of Cialis to good use.

If you re up for bantering about that episode
of "Deal or No Deal," email Vishnu at vish
