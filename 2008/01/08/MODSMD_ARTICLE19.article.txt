In defense of the fast and easy
To the Editor:
A few weeks ago, as I read Little Ms.
Modern's latest column ("The no-cell phone
solution," Dec. 5, 2007) on The Stanford
Daily's Web site, scrolling down the screen
with my left hand as I answered text mes
sages with my right, occasionally toggling
screens as my Outlook icon popped up to in
form me I'd been sent a new Facebook mes
sage, I got to thinking. Could Ms. Mueller be
right — could all of these new technologies
allowing me to contact more people more
often more quickly actually be a BAD
thing?
Mueller's column suggests that the ef
fortlessness and frequency with which we
now communicate make us less apprecia
tive of "real" (read: old. sanctified) modes of
contact: the handwritten letter, the land-line
phone call, the all-but-obsolete face-to-face
meeting. It's a nostalgic lament one normal
ly hears from generations who didn't grow
up with instant messaging and cell phones
the way we Gen Vers have. Nonetheless, we
hear this critique all too frequently, and if
prevalence of warning is a true indicator of
the credibility of the threat, then we young
sters are surely doomed to become emo
tionless androids too hurried to pull our
pants up after we pee, let alone ink a letter.
It's true that there is an inherent loss of
forethought that goes into our communica
tion when it becomes so quick and easy. And
I do believe a certain degree of distance is
good for relationships. TTiere is something
intrinsically more romantic about the half
decade long correspondence between CC
and Robbie (of lan McEwan's "Atone
ment") through rain-soaked, crumpled let
ters than there is about my roommate's daily
videophone sessions with her boyfriend
abroad. And if Mr. Darcy could have sent
Elizabeth that explanatory, post marriage
proposal letter via Blackberry rather than
having to deliver it by hand, they never
would have had that exhilaratingly tense
meeting in the woods — and isn't their ro
mance merely a build-up of these unnerving,
sexually charged encounters?
Antiquated modes of communication
certainly have their charm. However, I will
cautiously claim that the modern speed of

communication makes us no less apprecia
tive of more deliberate forms of contact.
What we mourn about the virtual extinction
of the written letter is that, unlike the in
stantaneousness of email, paper letters are
slow, and they are rare. But they have al
ways been rare. The pleasure of receiving
such a letter is by nature derived from its
uncommonness. much as one delights at the
delivery of an unexpected package. Hand
written Christmas cards, letters from camp,
even postcards still have this effect. That
you email your younger sister thrice daily
doesn't make the sparkly purple note she
wrote you in class any less special. And if
email does, in fact, make the written letter
more scarce — well, that makes it even
more exciting. And mightn't the heightened
thrill factor counterbalance, or even trump,
the lesser frequency of receipt?
But what could possibly vindicate that
notorious, dependency-creating evil that is
the cell phone? It's true what Mueller says
that the majority of our conversations have
devolved into some variation of "Hey,
what's up." "Not much." "Ok, cool."
"Peace." We are certainly no longer in an
age when the advent of a long-distance
phone call brings on "Meet Me in St. Louis"
style excitement, when one plans family
mealtimes around scheduled calls and the
brrrringgf*! of a phone's bell can silence a
room. Yet we still know the satisfaction of
those occasional long, roving phone calls.
We still have the Sundays when we pick up
the phone and dial an old friend, and though
we may speak to them while pacing the
backyard or folding laundry, we still sit back
for a moment after we've hung up. replay
some of the conversation in our head, and
luxuriate in the experience.
I concede that this defense of modern
technology is coming from a self-professed
addict — sort of like a smoker asserting that
lung cancer is good for the soul. I've been
known to sleep with my Blackjack beside
my pillow, and I check my Facebook wall
more often than someone blacks out at
Rudy's. But I maintain my claim that in
dulging in a cheap, quick or easy version of
something doesn't make one less apprecia
tive of the real thing when it comes around.
Does a ready appetite for Franzia ruin one's
taste for a Montepulciano Chianti? If so.

Reserve student section for students
To the Editor:
The Stanford men's basketball team put
together an impressive, if unsuccessful, per
formance against the visiting UCLA Bruins
on the evening of Jan. 3. Less impressive was
a shift in University policy that robbed the
team of an essential source of support. As
any serious fan can affirm, home court ad
vantage is critical in basketball, especially at
the college level.Though the men's team had
the privilege of playing in front of a sold-out
stadium, the student section was not the
source of support it usually is.
In my five years as a Sixth Man Club
member I have seen my fair share of games
in which winter break left the student section
quiet and sparsely attended. The issue this
year, however, was not student attendance.
Rather, the issue seems to have been a bit
of petty greed.
Apparently taking advantage of the
chance to pocket a few thousand dollars in
extra ticket sales. Stanford sold hundreds of
seats in the student section to UCLA fans. As
it happened, more Stanford students than
anticipated arrived, creating an unseemly
spectacle in which Stanford Event Staff
shouted at Sixth Man members standing in
the aisles during the game, all the while al
lowing UCLA fans — wearing UCLA shirts
and vocally supporting their team — to re
main in seats already sold to Stanford stu
dents. The insult was rendered more obnox
ious by a UCLA fan sitting in the front row
of the student section, undisturbed, wearing
a blue and gold shirt which proclaimed,
••p.*** Stanford." Sixth Man members, justly
irate, were told to shut up and squish into the
inadequate space left to the students when
they objected.
I hope it is not too much to ask one of the
wealthiest institutions in the country to forgo
the profits from extra ticket sales and reserve
the student section for its rightful owners: the
students.
