## Women upset twice No. 2 Stanford loses back-to-back games to unranked opponents 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team entered last weekend's series
against UCLA and USC as the con
sensus No. 2 team in the nation, and
the owners of a 12-1 record.The Bru
ins and Trojans were both unranked,
with a combined record of 15-13. But
in back-to-back losses, the Cardinal
was outplayed and its offense was
shut down. Stanford dropped to 2-2
in the Pac-1(), which leaves it sitting
in sixth place in the conference
standings.
Against a below-average UCLA
team on Friday, the Cardinal could
not sustain a lead, and lost 69-sb.
Stanford shot a pathetic 29.6 percent
from the floor and only made half of
its shots from the free-throw line.
Star senior guard Candice Wig
gins led the Cardinal with 29 points
— more than half of Stanford's of
fensive output — but on only 11-for
-28 shooting. Freshman forward
Kayla Pedersen was held without a
field goal, and sophomore center
Jayne Appel was the only other play
er to score in double figures. In fact,
just five Cardinal players found the
net in the game.
After falling behind early in the
game, the Cardinal kept pace with
the Bruins in the first half and went
into halftime down only four points.
But as the second half began. UCLA
was finally able to capitalize on Stan
ford's mistakes — the Cardinal
turned the ball over 18 times — to
run its lead into double digits. And al
though Stanford fought back, the
Cardinal could not make up the
deficit.
Freshman guard Darxia Morris
led the Bruins with 20 points on 8-
for-13 shooting. Senior forward
Lindsey Pluimer added 13 points.
Unlike their opponents, the offen
sive load was evenly distributed —
only one UCLA player failed to
score.
Even so, UCLA was hardly domi
nant — Stanford had more re
bounds, blocks and steals than the
Bruins, and UCLA committed 15
turnovers. But this makes the loss all
the more troubling for the Cardinal:
they were unable to beat a sub-par

GAME NOTES: After a pair of disappointing
losses left Stanford 2-2 in conference and
the team fell five spots in the AP poll, the No.
7 Cardinal women will be looking to regain
control in the Roc-10 on Thursday. The
Beavers took two overtimes to beat Anzona
in their first game before losing to then-No

OSU's schedule.
