## Women upset twice No. 2 Stanford loses back-to-back games to unranked opponents 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team entered last weekend's series
against UCLA and USC as the con
sensus No. 2 team in the nation, and
the owners of a 12-1 record.The Bru
ins and Trojans were both unranked,
with a combined record of 15-13. But
in back-to-back losses, the Cardinal
was outplayed and its offense was
shut down. Stanford dropped to 2-2
in the Pac-1(), which leaves it sitting
in sixth place in the conference
standings.
Against a below-average UCLA
team on Friday, the Cardinal could
not sustain a lead, and lost 69-sb.
Stanford shot a pathetic 29.6 percent
from the floor and only made half of
its shots from the free-throw line.
Star senior guard Candice Wig
gins led the Cardinal with 29 points
— more than half of Stanford's of
fensive output — but on only 11-for
-28 shooting. Freshman forward
Kayla Pedersen was held without a
field goal, and sophomore center
Jayne Appel was the only other play
er to score in double figures. In fact,
just five Cardinal players found the
net in the game.
After falling behind early in the
game, the Cardinal kept pace with
the Bruins in the first half and went
into halftime down only four points.
But as the second half began. UCLA
was finally able to capitalize on Stan
ford's mistakes — the Cardinal
turned the ball over 18 times — to
run its lead into double digits. And al
though Stanford fought back, the
Cardinal could not make up the
deficit.
Freshman guard Darxia Morris
led the Bruins with 20 points on 8-
for-13 shooting. Senior forward
Lindsey Pluimer added 13 points.
Unlike their opponents, the offen
sive load was evenly distributed —
only one UCLA player failed to
score.
Even so, UCLA was hardly domi
nant — Stanford had more re
bounds, blocks and steals than the
Bruins, and UCLA committed 15
turnovers. But this makes the loss all
the more troubling for the Cardinal:
they were unable to beat a sub-par

GAME NOTES: After a pair of disappointing
losses left Stanford 2-2 in conference and
the team fell five spots in the AP poll, the No.
7 Cardinal women will be looking to regain
control in the Roc-10 on Thursday. The
Beavers took two overtimes to beat Anzona
in their first game before losing to then-No
24 Arizona State, the first ranked team on
OSU's schedule.
team that played only an average
game.
All was not lost, though. Stanford
had an opportunity to end the road trip
on a high note with a win against USC
on Sunday night. And while the team
played better against the Trojans than
they did against the Bruins, they were
still unable to pull out a victory, losing
a nail-biter 73-72.
Appel, who led Stanford with 22
points and 11 rebounds, hit one of two
free throws with 38 seconds left to put
the Cardinal up 72-71. But the missed
foul shot proved costly, as junior guard
Camille LeNoir put the Trojans on top
73-72 with eight seconds left.
With a decent amount of time left,
the Cardinal put the ball in the hands
of Wiggins, who has made her share of
clutch shots in the past. But this time
Wiggins airballed her shot at the
buzzer, and USC escaped with the vic
tory.
Stanford improved its play against
the Women of Troy, cutting its
turnovers in half from the UCLA
game while dominating the boards.
And while the team shot a respectable
44 percent from the floor, their biggest
star was plagued with shooting prob
lems: Wiggins was only 5-for-15, in
cluding just one of eight from three
point range.
Pedersen was able to regain her
form after scoring only two free throws
against the Bruins and contributed 14
points and eight rebounds. Sophomore
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, who
started the UCLA game, contributed
five points and three assists off the
bench.
USC was led by LeNoir, who, de
spite an injured hip, scored 21 points,
including five three-pointers. The
Women of Troy shot 58 percent from
behind the arc. Sophomore Aarika
Hughes hit two key three-pointers, and
senior guard Allison Jaskowiak —
who effectively guarded Wiggins for
most of the game — hit from behind
the arc to cut a late Stanford lead from
five to two.
This was the first time since the
1993-1994 season that the Cardinal
was swept in Los Angeles, and the
UCLA loss broke a nine-game win
ning streak, dating back to a Nov. 22
loss to top-ranked Connecticut over
Thanksgiving Break.
Stanford is next in action at home
on Thursday against Oregon State and
on Saturday versus Oregon. The
Beavers and Ducks come in with iden
tical 8-6 records.The Cardinal will then
travel to Arizona to face a tough Ari
zona State team over the holiday
weekend.
