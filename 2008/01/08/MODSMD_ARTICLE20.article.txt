## Power outage hits parts of campus 
### NICK PARKER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
An extensive power outage occurred
Friday, Dec. 7 around midnight and last
ed for more than two hours before the
lights came back on at around 2:30 a.m.
Saturday. The outage came at an incon
venient time for many students who were
in the midst of cramming for upcoming fi
nals. SLE students were, in fact, in the
middle of their notorious 24-hour final
when the lights went off.
According to Manager of Stanford's
Emergency Management program Keith
Perry, a malfunctioning Cardinal CoGen
transformer in a "critical location" on
campus caused the blackout.
Stanford's power is supplied by a vari
ety of sources. Stanford Hospitals & Clin
ics (SHC) and some campus residences
receive power directly from the city of
Palo Alto, while the central core of cam
pus gets its power from one of two other

sources: Cardinal CoGen — a General
Electric-owned plant — supplies 60 per
cent of campus power, while the Pacific
Gas & Electric (PG&E) power grid sup
plies the remaining 40 percent.
Perry said the malfunctioning trans
former affected both the CoGen and
PG&E-powered parts of campus.
"A little after midnight, a transformer
associated with CoGen malfunctioned
and took down both the CoGen feed and
the PG&E feed to campus simultaneous
ly," he said. "Normally, the campus has
the ability to be fed from either CoGen
or PG&E, but this particular transformer
was in a critical location and disabled
both sources simultaneously."
Just before 2:30 a.m. Saturday morn
ing — nearly three hours after the black
out began — power was restored to cam
pus by the PG&E power grid. Perry said.
He added that Stanford's Situation
Triage and Assessment Team (STAT) was
activated immediately after the lights

went out. STAT is comprised of a number
of officials who convene during emergen
cies to determine the University's course
of action.
"We set up an emergency center at the
Public Safety facility," Perry said. "Facili
ties Operations set up a center at the high
voltage shop, and they immediately went
to work on the malfunctioning trans
former."
The blackout knocked out nearly all
of the lights on West campus, including
the lower Row. but did not disrupt activi
ty in parts of East campus. Interestingly,
while Wilbur, Stern. Branner.Toyon, and
Crothers Memorial were unaffected by
the outage, other houses on or near Es
condido Road, including Mirrielees,
Manzanita, Escondido Village and Rains
Houses were all dark during the black
out.
Similarly, the lights in Green Li
brary were knocked out but
Meyer's power remained function
al during the spotty outage. Stu
dents looking at Hoover Tower
would have seen the lights in the
top of the iconic building flashing
sporadically for hours.
In parts of Lagunita Court, fire
alarms were blaring nonstop for up
to two hours late Friday and early-
Saturday. The Fire Department ar
rived on the scene and told resi
dents they could re-enter the build
ing despite the fact that the alarms
were still buzzing.
Because SHC receives its power
directly from Palo Alto. Perry said,
the Hospital — which would have
had thousands of patients relying
on electricity-powered life-saving
equipment — was unaffected by
the blackout.
Perry added that because virtu
ally all of the research buildings on
campus are provided with emer
gency generators, the likelihood
that any valuable research was lost
as a result of the blackout is low.
Perry said that there have yet to be
any reports of lost research, but
cautioned that the fact that the
blackout occurred late on a week
end night means that no one will
know the true effects until Monday
morning.
"To the best of our knowledge."
Perry said, "the emergency genera
tors in the research buildings acti
vated properly and saved all the re
search.
"The only impact that we are
aware of at this time," he said, "is
with some of the elevators having to
be reset by an outside contractor."
