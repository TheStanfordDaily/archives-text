### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees approved the con
struction of a new building forThe Daily dur
ing its last meeting of 2007, on Dec. 12.
The Lorry Lokey Stanford Daily Build
ing was approved unanimously by the
Board and tagged with a construction
budget of $3.75 million. Once completed,
the new facility — which will be adjacent to
Old Union — will replace the Storke Pub
lications Building as the central office of
The Daily.
Approval of the new Daily building
comes 10 months after the site and design
concept for the building were approved in

February. The two-story structure will en
compass approximately 5.400 square feet
alongside Panama Mall and Old Union. It
will include workspaces, offices and several
exterior features, along with an elevator that
will provide access to the second floor. In
keeping with the aesthetics of the surround
ing structures, the proposed facade of the
building will include a traditional red clay
tile roof, stucco walls and wood windows.
Julie Yen "07, chief operating officer of
Hie Daily, cited reasons for the newspaper's
move to the center of campus.
"The current space has several design is
sues," she said. "It has endured a lot of wear
and tear and is not a very functional space."
Having approved the construction phase
of the project, the Board expects the building
to be completed by October 2008.
"I don't foresee any major roadblocks,"
Yen said in reference to the construction
process, which is slated to start in mid-Janu

ary.
The new building will be named in honor
of Business Wire founder Lorry Lokey "49, a
former Daily editor who has contributed
considerably to the newspaper through the
funding of journalism grants and scholar
ships.
At the meeting, members of the Board
also took a tour of Old Union and viewed a
presentation by Director of Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws. In addition, the audited finan
cial statement for this year was presented to
the Board and approved by the Committee
on Audit and Compliance.
Administration Services Administrator
Marty Higgins summed up the University's
financial situation.
"It's been another very good year at Stan
ford."
