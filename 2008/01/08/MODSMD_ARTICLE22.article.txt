## First-years go pass-fail Students eschew letter grades, tradition in large numbers 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
In a departure from tradition, record
numbers of first-year law students chose to
take at least one of their first semester cours
es pass-fail this year.
Law students have traditionally found
themselves in a bind when choosing to "3k."
the common term for pass-fail grading. Stu
dents interviewed independently described
the situation repeatedly as a "prisoner's
dilemma," referencing the archetypal prob
lem of decisions made with imperfect infor
mation.
Choosing to be graded pass-fail, whatev
er one's personal reasons, could cause prob
lems if the student is one of only a handful of
students to do so in the law school class.
However, last semester somewhere between
one-third and one-half of first-year students
elected to take a class pass-fail, a fact which
affects the way the action is perceived by
others.
There was this whole issue before where
employers might say it's an oddity," said
first-year law student Chris Wells. "[From
orientation onwards] a lot of us wanted to
make it a real option at the law school."
First-year law student John Kimble draft
ed an open letter about the 3k decision and
sent it to the first-year student email list on
the last day students could choose their
grading basis. Seeing the letter and the ex
citement it generated emboldened students
to take the pass-fail option and also gave the
student body an indication of the move
ment's support.
The day of the grading-basis decision
deadline, "there was a palpable panic in the
library," Kimble said." 1 basically said'l have
done this, and add your name to the list.'
First-year students are notorious for being
cautious and risk-adverse, and this really
seemed like a way to get it out there.The re
sponse was incredible."
In the past there have been about seven
per year," Wells said.referring to the number
of students who take all of their law courses
pass-fail. "To see so many people sign it
made it clear that it was a much larger move
ment this year."
There had been talk all semester, but
people had never really followed through,"

said first-year law student Rachel Marshall.
"When John sent the email, it really added a
sense of urgency."
Kimble's letter hit home with a class that
had struggled against the traditional "forced
curve" model of law-school grading. Even
before classes began, students discussed at
tempting to increase the number of students
who would take the option. As the quarter
continued, students distributed a survey to
gauge interest among the first-year class for
the idea.
Law school students have the option to
take all courses pass-fail only in their first se
mester. After that, they can opt for pass-fail
credit in two courses for the rest of their ca
reer. Choosing to "3k" opens the student to
assessment on a credit, reduced-credit, no
credit scheme, rather than the classic A
through F grading scale.
Students chalked up the dramatic in
crease to a shift in culture among law stu
dents and a shared sentiment that a change
to ingrained "forced curve" traditions was
necessary.
"We're a collegial environment." Wells
said. "When you're here you realize that
what and how you're learning should be co
operative. rather than based on needless
competition."
"Stanford's not about being cutthroat for
the sake of cutthroat," Kimble said.
Choosing to "3k" has not meant an easier
semester for the students who chose such a
route.
"Most pass-fail folks 1 talked to were still
going to study just as hard," said first-year
law student Ben Jackson. "Sure, pass-fail
would allow us to 'get by' with less good
work, but this is a professional school: we're
paying for an education, not just a degree.
The large majority of us left jobs — good
jobs — to go back to school, so you find a
different mindset from undergrad: we're in
trinsically motivated."
With the first-year students past their
opening semester, and the pass-fail decision
behind them, students are looking forward
to the effects of the spike.
"We're all kind of holding our breath to
see how employers react." Jackson said.
"That will factor into how we advise incom
ing students."
"I think it will definitely impact students
making the decision next year." Marshall
said. "They'll know it's been done before."
