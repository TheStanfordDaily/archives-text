### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After losing the first two games of
their NCAA championship match on
Dec. 15 against Penn State, the Stanford
women's volleyball team battled back to
tie the match and force a decisive fifth
game. In the end. though, the Nittany
Lions' attack was too much for the Car

title in school history with the 30-25,30-
26. 23-30, 19-30, 15-8 marathon victory.
Stanford ended its season at 32-3.
"Obviously Penn State is a great
team," head coach John Dunning said in
a postgame press conference. "I'd really
like to congratulate them. I thought they
started the match aggressively. They got
the advantage on us early — I 'm not ex
actly clear at this point what happened.
I'm proud of our team aftergame two to
come back with the effort [that we did]."
Megan Hodge, the Nittany Lions'
star sophomore outside hitter, was
named Most Outstanding Player of the
tournament for her 26-kill performance
in leading Penn State to its first champi
onship since a victory over Stanford in
the 1999 final.
For the Card, junior middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo — a First Team All-
American and the 2007 AVCA National
Player of the Year — made only one hit
ting error and tied freshman phenom
Alix Klineman — a Second Team All-
American outside hitter— with 18 kills
in the final match.
Two Stanford seniors — setter liryn
Kehoe and middle blocker Franci Gi
rard — saw their collegiate careers
come to an end in their third champi
onship match in four years on the Farm.
They leave Stanford with a four-year
record of 119-19.
"They're leaders on our team," Dun
ning said of his seniors. "They're cap
tains on our team, they've been to three
Finals matches in their careers, and
they're just great people. They have
meant a lot to our program and always
will, and 1 am sure they will go on to
great things after this."
Kehoe leaves as the top setter in
Stanford history, with 5,956 career as
sists. She broke her own single-season
record as a senior with 1,742 and is also
in the all-time top 10 in aces and digs.
Girard had her best offensive season
as a senior, with 261 kills and a .317 hit
ting percentage. She came up with key
blocks in both the Cardinal's Regional
Final win over No. 7 UCLA and an
NCAA semifinal victory over No. 3
use.
Penn State, which had not lost since a
five-game thriller against Stanford in
September, had swept every opponent

the NCAA Championship Final last month. Stan

matches, including three of the last four, and has
won six titles, most recently in 2004. The Cardi

California in the semifinal.
The first game of the championship
was a close one, but Penn State scored
four of the last five points in the game to
win,3o-25.
The Nittany Lions built a small lead
part way through the second game and,
though the Cardinal came within two
points several times, the advantage held.
Penn State sealed the 30-26 win with a
block.
Facing a must-win situation in the
third game, Stanford came out firing and
stunned Penn State, which had played
near flawless volleyball the first two
games. Up 15-13 at the midpoint. Kehoe
served three aces in a row as part of a
five-point run that put the game out of
Penn State's reach. The lead never
dropped below four points, as a Penn
State service error gave the Cardinal a
30-23 win.
With an opportunity to tie the match
in the fourth game, the Cardinal pow
ered through the frame, putting down 23
kills without making a single error. Ak

thia Barboza both notched six kills on 10
swings in the game and Girard put each
of her five attempts on the floor. Two
straight ball-handling errors called on

ended the game 30-19 and pushed the
match to the decisive fifth game. The
final marked the first time a champi

Stanford struggled to get a kill. The
Nittany Lions strung together six
points in a row to turn a 4-4 tie into a
10-4 lead and junior right side hitter
Lrin Waller got Stanford's only kill
of the game at 13-8. Hodge finished
out the match with a kill to end the
Cardinal's title hopes.
"You know, it is such a momen
tum oriented game," Dunning said.
"1 think we knocked them on their
heels in game three and they thought
they could recover and didn't in
game four. They just put their heart
out on the floor, they were ready to
start in game five.
"We all know that is what makes
volleyball amazing to watch and
play, because you get to that fifth
game and who knows what is going
to happen. It's just so exciting, they
just did a great job, they grabbed all
the momentum and it's hard to catch
up when you get down three or four
points."

Behind Akinradewo and Kline
man's 18 kills apiece, Barboza fin
ished with 16 and Girard had 10.
Klineman also anchored Stanford in
the hack row with her 15 digs. Bar
boza chipped in 12 and freshman de
fensive specialists Cassidy Lichtman
and Gabi Ailes added 10 each.
Along with her 62 assists. Kehoe
tied a career high with five aces and
led the Cardinal with seven total
blocks. Though the Nittany Lions
were the second-best blocking team
in the nation coming in, Stanford
won the blocking battle 11-8.
Stanford and Penn State are the
only two teams to have participated
in all 27 NCAA Tournaments. Stan
ford also holds the record for most
Final Four appearances (17), title
match appearances (13) and nation
al championships (6).
This was the second straight year
the Cardinal lost in the title game.
Stanford fell to Nebraska 3-1 in last
year's championship.
"I think the goal going into next
season is to win the national champi
onship, as opposed to losing for the
third straight year," Barboza said
after the final. "That would be ideal.

It is just kind of a double whammy.to
lose two back-to-back. [It will give
usj just that much more drive for
next season."
Akinradewo finished the season
with a .499 hitting percentage, a
Stanford and Pac-10 single-season
record, just .005 off the NCAA
record. In December.she was named
one of four finalists for the Honda
Sports Award for Volleyball — the
winner will compete for the title of
Collegiate Woman Athlete of the
Year in the spring.
Also this year, freshman libero
Gabi Ailes broke the single-season
digs record with 533.
Though the 2007 season is over,
several Stanford players are keeping
busy. Akinradewo has already begun
training with the USA National
Team, trying to earn a spot on the
2008 Olympic team. Barboza will
join her in Colorado Springs in
March. Both Klineman and Kehoe
were among 14 players invited to a
National Team tryout which began
yesterday.

Stanford struggled to get a kill. The
Nittany Lions strung together six
points in a row to turn a 4-4 tie into a
10-4 lead and junior right side hitter
Lrin Waller got Stanford's only kill
of the game at 13-8. Hodge finished
out the match with a kill to end the

"You know, it is such a momen

"1 think we knocked them on their
heels in game three and they thought
they could recover and didn't in
game four. They just put their heart
out on the floor, they were ready to
start in game five.
"We all know that is what makes
volleyball amazing to watch and
play, because you get to that fifth
game and who knows what is going
to happen. It's just so exciting, they
just did a great job, they grabbed all
the momentum and it's hard to catch
up when you get down three or four

Klineman also anchored Stanford in
the hack row with her 15 digs. Bar

Along with her 62 assists. Kehoe
tied a career high with five aces and

Stanford and Penn State are the
only two teams to have participated
in all 27 NCAA Tournaments. Stan

Final Four appearances (17), title
match appearances (13) and nation

This was the second straight year
the Cardinal lost in the title game.
Stanford fell to Nebraska 3-1 in last
year's championship.
"I think the goal going into next
season is to win the national champi
onship, as opposed to losing for the
third straight year," Barboza said
after the final. "That would be ideal.

It is just kind of a double whammy.to
lose two back-to-back. [It will give
usj just that much more drive for
next season."
Akinradewo finished the season
with a .499 hitting percentage, a
Stanford and Pac-10 single-season
record, just .005 off the NCAA
record. In December.she was named
one of four finalists for the Honda
Sports Award for Volleyball — the
winner will compete for the title of
Collegiate Woman Athlete of the
Year in the spring.
Also this year, freshman libero
Gabi Ailes broke the single-season
digs record with 533.
Though the 2007 season is over,
several Stanford players are keeping
busy. Akinradewo has already begun
training with the USA National
Team, trying to earn a spot on the
2008 Olympic team. Barboza will

I'm proud of our team aftergame two to
come back with the effort [that we did]."

tains on our team, they've been to three
Finals matches in their careers, and
they're just great people. They have
meant a lot to our program and always
will, and 1 am sure they will go on to
great things after this."
Kehoe leaves as the top setter in
Stanford history, with 5,956 career as
sists. She broke her own single-season
