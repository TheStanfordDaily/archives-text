## Overhaul for broken BCS 
### 
Who knew that the "Greatest Upset Hver" would
have so many howl implications? By heating USC, 24-
23. on Oct. 6, Stanford all hut eliminated the Trojans
from playing in the BCS Championship — a loss to
Oregon later in the year sealed USC's fate.
If the Trojans had stopped the Cardinal on its final
drive and escaped with a narrow victory, they would
likely have finished the year with one loss, and would
almost surely have played Ohio State for the title.
No BCS-conferencc team finished undefeated.and
so Stanford is just one of many spoilers: Oklahoma, for
example, ruined Missouri's championship hopes; Pitts
burgh did the same to West Virginia. This season was
certainly an odd one. and many teams finished in seem
ingly equal standing.
What we were left with is simple: total and absolute
B( S chaos, where, because of an increasingly antiquat
ed system, poor BCS bowl matchups were made. And
we were also left with one of the least memorable bowl
seasons in recent memory.
I won't advocate for a playoff system because
frankly.it's a tired argument and a useless one; the BCS
is not going anywhere. The reason is. of course, money:
The six major conferences — and the TV networks
with which they have deals — have worked hard to gain
their positions of power and wealth. The playoff system
would divide the earnings amongst smaller conferences that
take little or no cut from the current BCS deals.
ITiere is little incentive for the major conferences to cede
their control over the title game and the Rose, Sugar, Fiesta
and Orange Bowls — no matter how bad sports' fans think
the BCS is, they will still watch the major bowls, which
means the conferences will continue to rake in the cash.
But even it the BCS is not disposed of entirely, reforms
can still be made. It has become a necessity. Of the five BCS
bowl games, only one was interesting: Kansas's surprising
win over Virginia Tech.
The Rose Bowl (USC v. Illinois) was a laughable
matchup. Down the stretch, USC was playing arguably the
best football in the country, and Illinois got into a BCS bowl
game only because Ohio State was playing in the title game,
and Big 10 runner-up Michigan had too many losses to be
worthy of a BCS bid. The discrepancy in talent showed —
the Trojans rolled over the Fighting Illini, 49-17.
Georgia, which also played great football down the
stretch, had no problem disposing of a one-dimensional
Hawaii team, while West Virginia had little trouble with Ok
lahoma.
And, except for the beginning, when Ohio State jumped
out to a 10-0 lead, the BCS Championship game was domi
nated by LSU, and rightfully so — most experts gave the
Buckeyes little chance. And for good reason; the Buckeyes
play in the Big 10, which was abnormally weak this year.
Further, they faced unimpressive out-of-conference oppo
nents such as Youngstown State, Akron and Kent State, all
at home.
LSU by contrast, plays in the SEC. by far the toughest
football conference in the country. ITiey fell in triple over
time to SEC opponents in both of their losses. After a slow
start, the LSU defense had no problem with an untested
OSU offense.
In fact, many non-BCS games, such as the Capitol One,
Gator, Outback, Chick-fil-A, Music City, Champs Sports
and the epic Motor City Bowl were infinitely more interest
ing than the Rose Bowl. Sugar Bowl and BCS Champi
onship.
This shouldn't be the case. Yet in the current system,
where conferences have contracts with bowls, it is.The Pac
-10 and Big 10 champions must play in the Rose Bowl unless
one makes the championship game; the ACC is tied to the
Orange Bowl; the SEC has the Sugar Bowl; the Big 12 is in
the Fiesta Bowl; and the Big East, formerly tied to the Or
ange Bowl, floats around.
Here's my solution: drop these affiliations. Pool the
money between the major conferences, so the powers that
be can continue to get their pieces of the pie. USC v. Geor
gia, for example, would be a magnificent game, but it could
never happen under the current alignment. Illinois has no
business being in a BCS game, but is in the Rose Bowl be
cause it plays in the Big 10— Missouri, for example, had a
better record than the Fighting Illini and was a much better
team, but couldn't get a BCS bowl because no conference is
allowed three teams.
While we certainly don't want to see the bowls monopo
lized any more than they already are, we want the best teams
playing in them. While we're at it, let's eliminate the "two
teams per conference" rule too.
Unfortunately, most of this year's BCS bowls featured
bad games when we should and could have seen great ones.
This wild season has exemplified the increasing parity in col
lege football and shown the need to alter the postseason ac
cordingly
