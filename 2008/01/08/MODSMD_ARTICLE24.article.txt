## Overhaul for broken BCS 
### 
Who knew that the "Greatest Upset Hver" would
have so many howl implications? By heating USC, 24-
23. on Oct. 6, Stanford all hut eliminated the Trojans
from playing in the BCS Championship — a loss to
Oregon later in the year sealed USC's fate.
If the Trojans had stopped the Cardinal on its final
drive and escaped with a narrow victory, they would
likely have finished the year with one loss, and would
almost surely have played Ohio State for the title.
No BCS-conferencc team finished undefeated.and
so Stanford is just one of many spoilers: Oklahoma, for
example, ruined Missouri's championship hopes; Pitts
burgh did the same to West Virginia. This season was
certainly an odd one. and many teams finished in seem
ingly equal standing.
What we were left with is simple: total and absolute
B( S chaos, where, because of an increasingly antiquat
ed system, poor BCS bowl matchups were made. And
we were also left with one of the least memorable bowl
seasons in recent memory.
I won't advocate for a playoff system because
frankly.it's a tired argument and a useless one; the BCS
is not going anywhere. The reason is. of course, money:
The six major conferences — and the TV networks
