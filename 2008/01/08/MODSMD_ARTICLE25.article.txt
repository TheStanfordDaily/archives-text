# Pac-10 tough from top to bottom
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After rattling off Stanford's abysmal shooting
numbers from Saturday's ugly 52-46 win over I ISC
Saturday evening, head coach Trent Johnson
sighed and offered a sobering assessment of the
Cardinal's Pac-10 conference schedule.
"I knew the game was going to be tough for us."
Johnson said, always cordial and complimentary
toward the opposition. "Much like the next six
teen."
Stanford split its opening weekend of confer
ence play against fifth-ranked UCLA and then-No.
22 USC, perhaps the only weekend it will face two
ranked opponents until the Pac-10 tournament in
March. Still,the Cardinal stayed right with the Bru
ins before making some key mistakes and missing
shots down the stretch. And Saturday's defensive
display against the Trojans demonstrated that Stan
ford can still win despite poor shooting the Car
dinal were only 27 percent from the field.
"Obviously we want them both, especially at
home," junior forward Lawrence Hill said of his
team's start to the Pac-10 season. "But our mindset
is always on the next game. Losing to UCLA is
tough, but we have a lot of games to go."
It should get easier for the Cardinal from here
on out, but not by much. If one thing is clear about
the Pac-10 this season, it's that the conference is
one of the most competitive in the nation. Six teams
— UCLA. Washington State. Stanford, Arizona.
USC and Oregon — have appeared in the A P top

25 poll so far on the year.
That should change, now that the teams will he
heating each other up on a regular hasis, but this
week Arizona and Cal received votes as well. The
Golden Bears beat I JSC last Thursday, while the
Sun Devils downed then-No. 21 Arizona inTUscon,
a rare feat. Washington gave Washington State a
scare in Seattle, another sign that in the Pac-10, no
team is safe.
"I have never seen it this competitive from one
to 10. Washington coach Lorenzo Romar said on
Pac-10 media day in November. "There have been
times when it has been tough at the top,one to five,
but never this tough from the top to bottom. Please
don't ask me who I would pick to finish in any spot,
because I have no clue."
Ihe conference's top tier still belongs to No. 4
Washington State (13-0. 1-0 Pac-10) and No. 5
UC I, A (14-1.2 -o).Thc Cougars are once again win
ning with defense, leading the conference in points
allowed at just under 50 per game. The Bruins,
meanwhile, have dominated at both ends of the
floor and lead the league with an average 20-point
margin of victory.
After those two. the conference rankings re
main anybody's guess. Arizona (10-4.1 -1) leads the
conference in the RPI ranking, which takes
strength of schedule into account, at No. 12. Injuries
and questions regarding the coaching situation
linger for the Wildcats with longtime head coach
Lute Olson out on a yearlong leave of absence.

Kenny Brown and the Stanford men will have their work cut out for
them in the Pac-10 this year, with three teams in the AP Top 25 and
four more receiving votes. Stanford is No. 23 in the most recent poll.
