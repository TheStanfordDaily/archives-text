# Three-point misses, turnovers hurt Card
## 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
A three-week winter break could not have been
more up-and-down for the No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team.
It was a tale of two halves, one in the last days of
2(X)7 and one in the first days of 2(X)8. The Cardinal
stormed out of the gate after two weeks off for final
exams, demolishing No. 8 Baylor 87-63, a remarkable
accomplishment considering Baylors pedigree and
the reputation of finals for disrupting teams' focus. An
away win at New Mexico followed before Stanford ex-

orcised 10years worth of
demons with its gritty
victory over then-No. 1
Tennessee.
Then, after cake
walks against Washing
ton State and Washing
ton, the new year came
with a pair of road losses
toUCI A and USC.
'ITie last time Stan
ford came away from a
two-game Pac-10 week
end empty-handed was
in 2004. at the hands of
Arizona and Arizona
State. Both opponents
were unranked at the
timp

lime.
There were a lot of
similarities, then, with the recent episode in Los Ange
les. But this particular Stanford team lias its own
unique vulnerabilities that were exploited by two up
and-comers this past weekend.
Stanford has three players averaging more than ten
points per game: senior guard Candice Wiggins (15.2
ppg), sophomore center Jayne Appel (15.7 ppg) and
freshman forward Kayla Pedersen (12.3 ppg). But to a
greater extent than last season, the Cardinal is getting
its offense from only one place: inside the three-point
arc.
Stanford is shooting only .281 from three-point
range this season, a disturbingly low number for any
team, especially a top-ten program — in fact, the Car
dinal is eighth in the Pac-10, ahead of only perennial
losers Washington and Arizona. Wiggins has picked up
her average (.310) a bit since a disastrous start, but no
other starter has a higher three-point percentage than
sophomore point guard Rosalvn Gold-Onwude's .2fW.

That shortcoming reared its head on Sunday, as
Stanford went 3 for-20 in its one-point loss to USC.
Bad shooting nights happen, but this was not just an
aberration for the Cardinal. It had been an accident
waiting to happen all season. It nearly derailed Stan
ford in its double-overtime victory over unranked
I Itah in November (4-for-24). and it certainly caused
trouble last weekend.
ITie season's other major problem brought the Car
dinal down i)ii Friday night despite slightly more re
spectable (vfor-28 three-point shooting. Turnovers
have been tearing the team to pieces this year. Against
I!( I .A. the total was 18 while the team only had nine

assists. For the season,the
Cardinal has a 1.17 as
sist/turnover ratio, the
best of any Pac-10 team,
yet still poorer than last
year's 1.21.
Hiis is perhaps
the Cardinal's biggest
problem. Stanford has a
fine stable of point
guards, but each of them
has torn an ACL in the
last year and a half, with
sophomore Melanie
Murphy out for the sea
son with the most recent
injury.The rust is showing
in the Cardinal's ball
handling.

Still, all is not lost
for Stanford, who is still ranked No. 7 in the nation.
Wiggins has pointed numerous times this season to
what she perceives as much-improved intestinal forti
tude compared to previous teams. It certainly showed
in the close wins over Rutgers and Tennessee, whereas
Stanford fell to the two highest ranked opponents it
played last year, Tennessee and Georgia. Despite obvi
ous and glaring deficiencies, the Cardinal is still win
ning.
Among the marks of a great team is how it reacts to
adversity, and "great team" is a phrase that many were
tossing around after the Tennessee win.The 2(X)6-2007
Stanford Cardinal rebounded from back-to-back loss
es (against the Volunteers and Bulldogs) early last sea
son by ripping off 17 straight wins. Ilus weekend, and
the next, will be critical in determining where this
year's team finishes at the season's end.
