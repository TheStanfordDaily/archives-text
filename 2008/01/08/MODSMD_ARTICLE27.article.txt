## New biography illustrates Condi Rice's life 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A new biography of Condoleezza Rice
shines light on the former Provost's contro
versial tenure at Stanford and reveals that the
Secretary of State may harbor a desire to run
for governor of California in 2010 after she
returns to Palo Alto.
In the book. New York Times reporter
Elisabeth Bumiller chronicles the political
science professor's ascent to the highest ech
elon of power in "Condoleezza Rice: An
American Life," portraying Stanford as im
portant in Rice's formative years.
The 400-page tome, published during
Dead Week in December, includes two chap
ters that narrate Rice's time on the Farm in
more depth than any book yet released,from
her admission as a postdoctoral fellow in 1980
to when she took a leave of absence in 20(X).
In between, she explains how Rice pro
voked enmity among segments of the student
body and faculty, including women and racial
minorities.which prompted a U.S. Department
of Labor inquiry into alleged discrimination at
the University. She briefly addresses some of
the most legendary battles of the 19905, includ
ing the fight over the western culture curricu
lum that led to Introduction to Humanities.
Bumiller argues that Rice seems to have
benefited at various points in her career from
affirmative action. She discusses her appoint
ment as provost, which was controversial
since Rice had not before held any adminis
trative position. Bumiller writes about Rice's
aversion to working through traditional bu
reaucratic channels; the title of the chapter on
Rice's time as Provost is "I don't do commit
tees," a quote from a Faculty Senate meeting.
Most faculty members were surprised
when Rice became the first woman and the
first black Provost in 1993. She was also the

youngest, at 38. While "the darling of the
hoard of trustees," Bumiller writes, "she had
started to antagonize the faculty for a con
frontational style."
University President Gerhard Casper
chose Rice as Provost. She had already made
a name for herself as an expert on the Soviet
Union on the National Security Council staff
under President George H.W. Bush and was
on the selection committee that tapped
Casper.
Rice was extremely loyal to Casper while
she worked for him. Bumiller writes, but her
loyalties shifted after she moved to Washing
ton. When Casper, who still holds four ap
pointments at the University, told an interme
diary that he was interested in becoming the
American ambassador to Germany in 2005,
President Bush was apparently receptive. It
was Rice, according to Bumiller. who "would
not go along because Casper had become a
vocal critic of the Iraq War."
Rice reportedly cited her executive expe
rience of being the University's chief aca
demic and budgetary officer as making her
ready to assume control of the State Depart
ment in 2005.
"(Senior aide] Jim Wilkinson was tired of
hearing about Stanford." she writes. "When
ever he told the new Secretary of State that
she now had a monumental management job
on her hands, it was always the same re
sponse: Stanford this, Stanford that, don't
worry about it, I ran Stanford...Rice kept in
sisting that her battles at Stanford had pro
vided vital experience for her new job."
When she justified her attendance at do
mestic policy meetings on health care at the
White I louse by citing her experience in deal
ing with the issue as Provost, former White
I louse Chief of Staff Andy Card told the au
thor that Rice irritated some in the adminis
tration.

"Your relationship with your thesis adviser is the closest
possible relationship you will ever have with any other
human being except perhaps your parents or spouse,"
Rice said, reflecting on her work to earn a doctorate at
the University of Denver.
Before she earned tenure, Rice was warned by superiors,
including History Prof. David Kennedy '63, "about losing
focus" by doing too much non-academic work. Kennedy
remarked that she seemed unfazed.
While at Stanford, she dated Gene Washington "for
the better part of a year." He had played football for the
Cardinal before going on to the San Francisco 49ers,
and he later held a job as the University's assistant ath
letic director and a commentary job for NBC. They have
stayed close, even after Rice went to Washington.
Rice credited Prof. Sidney Drell, formerly deputy direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, with teach
ing her the physics of nuclear weapons. The lessons, said
Rice, "came in handy as I've had to deal with Iranian en
richment processes."
Several professors at Stanford said Rice earned tenure
in the political science department at least partly out of
consideration for her race. "Rice had published, but not
extensively, and her work was not known for any original
ity or brilliance," Bumiller wrote. "Although the commit-
ITie secretary told Bumiller in one of eight
hour-long interviews for the book that the
training simulations she organized for her
students came in handy when terrorists at
tacked the United States on Sept. 11.2001.
While at Stanford. Rice joined the hoard
of directors of Chevron. Transamerica.
I lewlett Packard and Charles Schwab.
I"he initial connection with Chevron was
made by Hoover Distinguished Fellow

Other interesting tidbits from Elisabeth Bumiller's book on Condoleezza Rice

tees that oversaw tenure decisions deliberated in secret,
as was the practice, the view among many faculty mem
bers looking back was that Rice's good but weighty aca
demic record was overshadowed by the committee's de
sire to keep such a promising young black woman at
Stanford — in short, a clear case of affirmative action."
