# CARD SPLITS
## Stanford men rebound from UCLA loss to beat USC 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
UCLA 76, Stanford 67
Well, at least it should get easier
from here.
Stanford faced perhaps its toughest
opponent of the Pac-10 schedule right
off the bat, starting its conference sea
son against No. 5 UCLA, a team that
has won the last two Pac-10 titles and
been to two straight Final Fours.
A handful of critical mistakes down
the stretch cost No. 23 Stanford (12-2,
1-1 Pac-10) the game, a 76-67 final in
front of a sellout crowd at Maples
Pavilion last Thursday night.
In its conference opener, the No. 23
Cardinal hung tough in the first half
against the Bruins, trailing 35-34 at in
termission. But UCLA (14-1, 2-0)
cranked up the pressure in the second
stanza, while Stanford cracked and lost
its composure.
"In a game like this, when you're
playing against a team this talented,
this experienced, when you have op
portunities to knock down the open
shot and you have opportunities to
make a hustle play and get the stop,you
have to do it," Coach Trent Johnson
said. "And we didn't do it."
Billed as a match up between bruis
ing big men in UCLA freshman Kevin
Love and Stanford sophomores Brook
and Robin Lopez, backcourt play was
instead the key for both teams.
UCLA's trio of Darren Collison.
Josh Shipp and Russell Westbrook
proved too tough for Stanford to han
dle. Westbrook, coming off the bench
for the first time all season, had 15
points and six assists, while Collison,
the speedy junior, added nine points,
four assists and three steals. Shipp
buried the Cardinal from beyond the
arc. making five-of-eight three-point
attempts to finish with a game-high 21
points.
Light of those points came during a
crucial five-minute stretch in the sec
ond half. Up 51-49 with nine minutes to
go. the Bruins went on a 13-4 run and
never looked back. Stanford missed
three layups during that spell, and gave
up four offensive rebounds — includ
ing two off missed free throws.

GAME NOTES. After starting the Pac-10 season
against the conference's top team, Stanford
should have an easier time next weekend, fac
ing unranked Oregon State and Oregon on the
road. The Beavers lost a pair last weekend, los
ing to both Arizona and Arizona State by dou
ble-digit margins.

For the night. UCLA outshot Stan
ford 54 to 41 percent, and sunk nine of
16 three-point attempts. Stanford made
only three of 11 attempts from beyond
the arc,all at the hands of junior Antho
ny Goods, who led the team with 17
points.
"1 thought we met their physicality
at times," Goods said after the game.
"Obviously we'd like to do it for the full
40 minutes, but there were stretches
where we were just as physical as they
were and looked like we'd dominate on
the boards."
Stanford did win the battle of the
boards 35-31. led by Robin Lopez's 12
(eight offensive). But the Bruins' dou
ble teams prevented the Lopez twins
from dominating offensively. Robin
finished with eight points, while Brook,
after scoring just two points in the first
half, finished with 13, shooting just five
for-13.
The Stanford twins were hampered
by the referee's whistle and each fouled
out in the final two minutes.
The Cardinal got within six points
with ;i minute remaining after Collison
missed a free throw and Goods hit a
three-pointer. But Love, known for his
ability to find the open man. made a
brilliant full-court pass to Westbrook
for a breakaway dunk, and Stanford

never got close again.
Stanford 52, USC 46
In a game that Coach Johnson
called a "gut check," the Cardinal on
Saturday faced a USC team fresh off a
disappointing 10 point loss to Cal two
days earlier. Stanford had its own de
feat to rectify, having bowed to No. 5
UCI.A 76-67 the same night.
It wasn't pretty, hut the Cardinal
came out on top of the Trojans, 52-46,
Saturday evening in ;i game marred by
dreadful shooting and myriad
turnovers. Stanford won despite shoot
ing only 27 percent from the field, em
ploying a stalwart defense that forced
23 USC turnovers.
"We found a way, and 1 guess that's
all that matters," Johnson said. "We
didn't have a lot of shots go down, but
guys kept grinding."
On Saturday, senior Fred Washing
ton — starting for the first time in five
games after suffering a knee injury —
was charged with defending USC's her
alded freshman O.J. Mayo. Mayo, who
was averaging 20 points per game, led
the then-No. 22 Trojans (9-5,0-2) with
14 points, but shot just five-for-19 from
the field and committed five turnovers.
"What you've got to do is bother
him," Washington said. "He can shoot
or take it off the dribble. You just have
to try to make him work."
Taj Gibson added 11 points, nine re
bounds and four blocks for the Trojans,
who were held to their lowest point
total of the season.
"As coach said, this is a testament to
our defense," Washington said. "We
should do that every game here on out.
Offense is going to come and go. but
the defense should be there the entire
time."
Saturday, the offense wasn't there
for either team. Stanford's shooting
performance was its worst in nearly
eight years. The Trojans shot slightly
better at 35.7 percent from the field,
but made only two of 12 three-point at
tempts.
Goods led Stanford with 11 points
on three-for-11 shooting from the field,
while junior forward Lawrence Mill
chipped in seven points and 13 re
