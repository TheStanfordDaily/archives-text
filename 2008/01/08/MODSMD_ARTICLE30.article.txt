## UN 						ambassador talks Middle East peace, policy Diplomacy stressed for solving area's problems 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations
Zalmay Khalilzad called the future of the
Middle East "the defining issue of our time" in
a Dec. 7 speech to approximately 220 audi
ence members at the Law School.
"All countries have an interest in establish
ing a stable, lasting peace in the region,"
Khalilzad said in the talk, organized by the
Law School student group Stanford Interna
tional Law Society (SII.S).
Ever-increasing demand for oil, especially
among rising economic powers China and
India, is just one reason for the importance of
Middle East stability, Khalilzad noted. Other
factors include the existence of substantial
Muslim populations in Central Asia, China
and European countries such as France and
the presence of nuclear weapons in Israel and
Pakistan.
"There is a struggle going on for the future
of the region." the Afghan-born ambassador
told attendees as at least three diplomatic se
curity personnel stood guard around the lec
ture room. "This struggle between moderates
and extremists is about what it means to be a
Muslim."
After serving as ambassador to
Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005, Khalilzad —
whose son is a student at the Law School —
headed the American embassy in Baghdad.
He assumed his current position in April 2007.
halilzad.the highest-ranking Muslim in the
Bush Administration, laid out a seven-point
strategy for regional American action in his
forty minute speech which focused "not just
on the immediate issues, but on long-term
strategies."
The points embraced political, military and
economic spheres both in the region and with
in the United States. At home. Khalilzad
called homeland security "an enduring new
mission" which includes both border control
and continued efforts to reduce America's re
liance on Middle East oil.
We have only begun to take advantage of
the benefits from conservation," he said.
ithin the region, Khalilzad highlighted the
importance of diplomacy in resolving region
al tensions, especially the long-festering Is
rael-Palestine issue. He cited France and Ger

many — longtime enemies whose reconcilia
tion after World War 11 inaugurated a new age
of European stability — as an example to em
ulate
He expressed hopes for the peace process
in the wake of the Nov. 2007 meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in An
napolis.
The Annapolis conference was a new be
ginning for the process of achieving the goal
of two countries living side by side," Khalilzad
said.
The ambassador also said the United
States must "respond to Iran's bid for region
al hegemony."
Iran is an historic nation, a major regional
power, and a revolutionary state," which
"views its neighbors as rivals" and its political
religious systems "as models to be exported,"
he said. Even if Iran's nuclear arms program
were inactive, as reported in a national intelli
gence estimate released last month. Khalilzad
warned that the country possesses "enormous
resources in conventional weapons."
According to Khalilzad, the American re
sponse must include continued efforts to hold
Iran to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
and a "willingness to engage" with Iran under
certain circumstances. High-level diplomatic
contact, Khalilzad said, should come only if
Iran agrees to suspend uranium enrichment.
He also called for continued military ac
tion against American enemies, but only with
surgical precision.
We should define the enemy as narrowly as
possible," he said. "We should distinguish be
tween terrorist groups at war with the United
States and those who are hostile to us and our
allies."
Although the crowd filled the lecture hall
to capacity and forced some attendees to
watch Khalilzad on a closed-circuit broadcast
in a nearby room, few undergraduates were
present for the speech.
The low undergraduate turnout reflected
SILS's strategy for publicizing the ambas
sador's visit, which was targeted at the Law
School and research centers like the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies and
the Hoover Institute.
"What we strived to do," said SILS co-pres
ident Eli Sugarman, a second-year law stu
dent, "was advertise the event to groups and
centers on campus with a particular interest in
international relations and foreign policy"
