# SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
## STEP program recognized as top 10 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is widely recognized as one
of the best universities for motivated stu
dents to attend to get an education; re
cently, it was also recognized as one of
the best places to become a future educa
tor.
In November 2007, Edutopia Magazine,
a nonprofit organization profiling the peo
ple and ideas behind innovation in educa
tion, cited the Stanford Teacher Education
Program (STEP) as one of the top ten lead
ing schools of education. The nationally
renowned STEP program leads to a Master
of Arts in Education.
STEP faculty, students, and alumni alike
expressed pride in this achievement.
"1 can't imagine STEP to be anything
but one of the best in the country." said
STEP alumnus Jon Deane '95 M.A. '03,
who is now teaching at Summit Preparato
ry High School in Redwood City.
Edutopia cited STEP'S integration of
theory and practice as the reason for its out
standing program.

"At STEP students spend the whole
year of the program in an actual class
room," said current STEP student Pablo
Aguilera '07.
"Teacher candidates are in the field
from the first week of summer quarter,"
added STEP Director Rachel Lotan.
"Their assignments in STEP are also close
ly linked to their field work."
Another notable area of STEP is its
commitment to motivating education re
form and serving urban students that lack
access to quality education.
"It's important that our graduates learn
the best practices to serve children that
have been traditionally underserved,"
Lotan said, "and many of our graduates
choose to go into schools that are hard to
staff."
During the program STEP students usu
ally work in schools such as Eastside
Preparatory in East Palo Alto, East Palo
Alto Charter School and the June Jordan
School for Equity.
"STEP is focused on creating teacher
leaders," Deane said. "It prepares you to
teach in a heterogeneous classroom and to

teach the whole student."
Current STEP students — often called
"STEPpies" — especially appreciate the
intimate environment and strong support
system in the program.
"All candidates are attached to a coop
erating teacher at a partnering K-12 school,
a supervisor who observes the candidate in
the classroom and gives feedback and a fac
ulty advisor," Lotan said.
In the end, STEP candidates are stu
dents as well as teachers.
"STEP candidates live and work in two
different worlds — the Stanford world and
our teaching world," Aguilera said. "Some
times that can be stressful."
To deal with that stress, students also de
velop strong friendships among them
selves.
"There are only around 67 of us in the
program this year," Aguilera said. "So we
barbeque and go out on weekends togeth
er. There's definitely a big family atmos
phere."
