# Early apps suffer slight decline
## Despite small decrease in applications, early admission standards remain high 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES DESK EDITOR 
Christmas came early for 738 high school seniors who be
came the earliest members of the Class of 2012 when they were
admitted on Dec. 14 to Stanford through the University's early
action admission program.
While the number of early admits (738) represents a slight
decrease from last year (750) and the overall number of early
applications this year (4,551) is also lower than last year's total
(4,644), Dean of Admission Richard Shaw noted that the Uni
versity continues to attract a large and competitive early action
pool.
"The candidates admitted in this first round have distin
guished themselves in an international arena," Shaw said in a
press release. "We are positively thrilled that these students
have designated Stanford as their first choice at this time."
It may seem surprising. however, that more high school sen
iors didn't make Stanford their first choice. This was the first
year that 1 larvard and Princeton did not offer an early decision
option, and peer institutions that retained their early action

programs may have expected to at
tract increased numbers of appli
cants as a result.
In fact. Yale and the University of
Chicago each experienced 30 per
cent increases in early applications,
while Stanford saw a slight decrease.
According to Director of Admis

sion Shawn Abbott, however, the
Yale statistic has a caveat.
"While yes, Yale did experience a
significant increase in early action
numbers this year, it's important to
note that they experienced a signifi
cant drop in applications last year —
S(H) to 1 .(KM) — and are now only re
bounding to where they were be
fore." Abbott said.
He added that it is a "marginal at
best, one to two percent difference of
84 applicants" between this and last
year and that admission to Stanford

remains highly competitive. This
year's early acceptance rate was 16.2
percent — a near replica of last
year's mark.
"1 have to emphasize that our
goal in the admission office is not to
increase the size of our current appli
cant pool," Abbott said. "So while it
may be interesting to some to evalu
ate whether we're up or down by a
few hundred applications each year,
the nearly 24,000 applications we
have received in recent years are
more than enout>h to secure a class of

1,670."
Nadia Arid of Presentation High
School in San Jose plans on being
among those 1.670 students in the
Class of 2012. Stanford had long
been Arid's first choice.
"1 knew for a long time that Stan
ford was my first choice," she said. "I
thought my grades and SAT score
were fine; it was just about putting in
the effort to go for early action."
John Lindsay of Menomonie
I ligh School in Menomonie, Wis. also
had Stanford as his first pick.

"1 definitely like not being forced
to enroll at Stanford like an "early de
cision' program [which Harvard had
previously] would do." Lindsay said.
Of those 4,551 early applicants
who did not receive admission to the
University, 982 were deferred to reg
ular decision and will learn their fate
in early April.
Abbott explained that Stanford
tends to reject a relatively high per
centage of its early applicants and
that deferrals to regular decision are
reserved for highly qualified candi

dates.
"Our philosophy is often chal
lenged. but we feel that it is in the
best interest of our early action can
didates to provide them with a final
decision if at all possible, and not
string them along for another three
months, simply to let them down
easy," he said. "Those candidates
who were deferred are viable con
tenders for admission."
