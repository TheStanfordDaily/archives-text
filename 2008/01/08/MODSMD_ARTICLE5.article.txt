### NICK PARKER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Two Stanford seniors were among the 37 recipients of 2(X)8
Marshall Scholarships, the Marshall Aid Commemoration
Commission announced in a Nov. 30 press release.
Scan Arenson "OS and Priyanka Narayan "08 will join 35 other
Americans as Marshall Scholars next fall.
The prestigious award, which is financed by the British gov
ernment. allows American students the opportunity to study at
any institution in the United Kingdom for two years with all ex
penses paid.
After a rare off-year last year in
which no Stanford students were
awarded Marshall Scholarships,
Arenson and Narayan give Stan
ford two this year, making the Uni
versity one of only three nation
wide to have multiple recipients of
the highly-competitive award.
The United States Naval Acade
my led the way with three winners,
while Yale and Stanford had two
each.The other 30 recipients came
from a wide array of schools, in
cluding Ivy League stalwarts like
I larvard. Princeton and Columbia,
as well as lesser known schools such
as New Mexico State, Virginia Mil
itary Institute and the College of
William and Mary.
Arenson — who plans to study
international health policy and eco
nomics at the London School of
Economics and Political Science —
said he hopes to bridge the gap be
tween European and American
health care.
"I think the U.S. has much to
learn from the experiences of Eu
ropean health care systems be
cause of their tradition of universal
access to care," he said. "I hope to
bring a thorough knowledge and
understanding of these systems
home with me."
The economics and biological
sciences double major described
his reaction to winning the award in
an email to The Daily.
"1 became quite emotional after
hearing the news," Arenson said.
"So many people invested so much
in helping me become a competi
tive applicant, from my professors
and mentors who inspired me to
pursue the field of health policy, to
my friends who helped me prepare
for interviews and gave me confi
dence that 1 could succeed, and my
parents who have always support
ed me.
"1 felt that 1 was representing all
of these people," he added, "and it
was a tremendous feeling to be able
to share the excitement of the
award with them."
Arenson credited his professors
for providing him with a founda
tion in health policy and economics
and his "thoughtful and creative"

peers, who he said helped him de
velop his analytical skills while at
Stanford.
A Sacramento native, Arenson
said he does not yet know what he
wants to do after his two years in
London, but added that he wants to
participate in U.S. health care re
form.
"My specific plans for the future
are not yet well defined," he said,
"hut 1 intend to work in the field of
health economics and policy, and 1
hope that I can in some way con
tribute to improving the efficiency
and equity of the United States
health care system."
Narayan - who will use her schol
arship to study chemistry at the
University of Cambridge and said
she was "pretty shocked and very
excited" to win the award - hails
from Arcadia, Calif. She is a chem
istry major at Stanford, where she
has played violin in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra for four years.
In particular.Narayan said in an
email to The Daily, she plans to
study "protein folding and its role
in amyloid diseases" at Cam
bridge's chemistry department.
She added that she wants to re
turn to the U.S. after completing
her Marshall Scholarship to contin
ue her research.
"1 hope to return to the U.S. and
continue research here and eventu
ally. if luck goes my way. pursue ac
ademic chemistry research at the
nexus of physical and biological
chemistry," Narayan said.
The Marshall Scholarships were
created in 1953 by the British gov
ernment as a token of appreciation
for the financial assistance provided
by the United States under the Mar
shall Plan following World War 11.
