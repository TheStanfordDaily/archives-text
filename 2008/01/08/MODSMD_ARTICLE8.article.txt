MANCHESTER, N.I I. — I ler voice qua
vering, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton strug
gled Monday to avoid a highly damaging sec
ond straight defeat in the Democratic presi
dential race. Republicans John McCain and
Mitt Romney scrapped for success on the eve
of a New Hampshire primary that neither
could afford to lose.
"You're the wave, and I'm riding it," Sen.
Barack Obama, the new Democratic front
runner, told several hundred voters who
cheered him in 40-degree weather after
being turned away from an indoor rally filled
to capacity.
Obama has been drawing large, boister
ous crowds since he won the lowa caucuses
last week, and a spate of preprimary polls
showed him powering to a lead in New
Hampshire, as well.
Clinton runs second in the surveys, with
former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina
third, and the former first lady and her aides
seemed to be bracing for another setback.
At one stop.she appeared to struggle with
her emotions when asked how she copes with
the grind of the campaign — but her words

still had bite."Some of us are ready and some
of us are not," she said in remarks aimed at
Obama. less than four years removed from
the Illinois Legislature.
Opinion polls made the Republican race a
close one between McCain, the Arizona sena
tor seeking to rebound from last summer's near
collapse of his campaign, and Romney, the for
mer governor from next-door Massachusetts.
After sparring over taxes and immigra
tion in weekend debates with McCain and
former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee,
Romney cast himself as the Republican best
able to hold the White House. "I think
Barack Obama would be able to do to John
McCain exactly what he was able to do to the
other senators who were running on the
other side," Romney said as he sped his way
through a half-dozen events on a final full
day of campaigning.
After first declining to predict victory in a
state where he had led in surveys for months,
Romney exuded confidence by the end of the
day. "I'm convinced we're going to win to
morrow." he boasted at a rally for his staff at
the campaign's headquarters. He attributed
the change of heart to KK).(KK) telephone
calls made by his staff.and his performance in
back-to-back nationally televised debates on

Saturday and Sunday.
McCain wasn't nearly as reluctant. "We're
not gonna lose here," he boasted as he set out
on a packed day of campaigning through
seven cities. In a snow-draped setting in
Keene, there seemed little doubt he had Rom
ney in mind when he said voters would reject
negative campaigning."l don't care how many
attack ads you buy on television," he said.
Romney has run several TV commercials
against McCain in New Hampshire, arguing
that the senator's immigration plan would
offer amnesty for illegal immigrants and
painting him as a disloyal Republican for
twice opposing President Bush's tax cuts. Mc-
Cain responded with an ad that includes a
quote from The Concord Monitor that sug
gested Romney was a phony.
Obama won his lowa victory on a promise
of bringing change to Washington, trumping
Clinton's stress on experience. She has strug
gled to find her footing in the days since, at the
same time insisting she is in the race to stay.
Sen. Clinton's aides have urged her to
show more passion and emotion to give vot
ers a sense of her warmer side.
By coincidence or not. she did so as she set
out on a final day in New Hampshire.
"You know, 1 had so many opportunities

from this country. I just don't want to see us fall
backwards," she said at a morning campaign
stop, her tone changing and voice quavering.
Edwards criticized Clinton as ill-suited to
bring about change. "The candidate — De
mocrat or Republican — who's taken the
most money from drug companies is not a
Republican. It's a Democrat and she's in this
race tomorrow morning," he said.
The übiquitous polls suggested that inde
pendents would play a large role in determin
ing the outcome of the Republican race.
Political independents accounted for 41
percent of the vote in the 2000 Republican
primary in the state. McCain carried that
group, 61-19, over George W. Bush, and won
the primary. Bush won the GOP nomination.
Now, eight years later, McCain again
hopes to attract enough independent voters
to defeat Romney.
But Obama's rise presents a challenge
McCain didn't face in 2000.The Illinois sena
tor showed strong appeal among independ
ents in lowa, and preprimary polling in New
Hampshire indicates he is poised to gain sub
stantial backing there, as well.
That left McCain contesting Obama for in
dependents and Romney for Republicans as
he worked to climb back into the race after his

campaign nearly imploded last summer. At
the time, he was struggling to defend the Iraq
war, unpopular with independents, and linked
to an immigration position that drove away
conservatives. In the months since, he has
worked to take the edge off the immigration
issue, and the war has receded as a campaign
concern as U.S. casualties have declined.
Huckabee, the former Arkansas gover
nor, flipped pancakes Monday in a state
known for its maple syrup, and struck a tone
that was both populist and conservative.
"There's a great need in this country to
elect someone who reminds them of the guy
they work with, not the guy who laid them
off," he said in a pitch aimed at independent
voters. Speaking to conservatives, he added.
"I have also heard folks say people in New
Hampshire don't care about issues like fami
ly and the sanctity of life. I'd beg to differ."
He finished first in the lowa caucuses last
week on the strength of support from evan
gelical conservatives, but Tuesday's primary
appears to offer far less prospect of success.
