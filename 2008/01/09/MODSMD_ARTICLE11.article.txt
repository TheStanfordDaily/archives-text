## New class explores ancient religion Popular faiths rooted in Zoroastrianism 
### ROXNA IRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Zoroastrianism, the world's
oldest revealed religion, is the
focus of an introductory course this
quarter taught by Visiting Prof.
Jennifer Rose from the School of
Religion at Claremont Graduate
University. "Introduction to the
Zoroastrian Religion," organized
by the Center for South Asia and a
committee of Zoroastrian commu
nity members, will explore in detail
the origins of the religion, its role in
the Iranian empires and its relation
to Judaism, Christianity,
Manichaeism and Islam.
Zoroastrianism is a significant
but little-known religious and cul
tural tradition that originated in
Iran and became an important in
fluence in modern India. 'Hie
course will highlight how common
religious concepts such as univer
sal judgment and renewal, a savior
figure and paradise all seem to
have been influenced by Zoroas
trian teachings.
Yesterday's first class featured
a small gathering of students, al
lowing for an intimate atmos
phere and close interaction with
Rose. Many students in atten
dance expressed personal interest
in the subject.
Magali Ferare TO, a Compara
tive Studies major, explained her
motive for enrolling in the course.
"I am excited to understand
how Zoroastrianism evolved with
the people and largely influenced
other religions," she said. "This
course provides a historical ap
proach to studying the religion
which has complemented my un
derstanding of other religions."

In the course, students will
delve into Zoroastrianism's later
forms and functions in Iran and
India and its diaspora, working
closely with Rose, who received
her Master's degree in Iranian
Studies from Columbia Universi
ty and has written widely on the
subject of Zoroastrianism. Stu
dents will also study the impact of
the religion on European literati
such as Voltaire, Mozart, Niet
zsche and the romantic poets.
Neekaan Oshidary 4 10 re
vealed a personal tie to the subject
of the class.
"Both my parents are Zoroas
trian so it's great to have a course
at Stanford dedicated to the reli
gion," he said. "Professor Rose is
very passionate about the subject
and so I recommend anyone with
an interest in religion to definitely
shop this class."
Riah Forbes *10. one of the few
Zoroastrians on campus, is im
pressed by the program although
she was unable to fit it into her
schedule this quarter.
"It's great to see that the Uni
versity has taken initiative to de
velop a course about a religion
that has such importance in the
world today," she said."Hopefully,
this course will be well accepted
by the Stanford community and
all the efforts to put it together will
pay off."
The three-unit course, which
fulfills the Humanities GER, will
be held on TUesdays from 1:15
p.m. through 4:05 p.m. in Building
20-21G. The quarter will conclude
with the opportunity to experi
ence Zoroastrianism as a lived re
ality, to hear both lay and priestly
speakers from the local Zoroastri
an community and to observe a
Zoroastrian ritual.
