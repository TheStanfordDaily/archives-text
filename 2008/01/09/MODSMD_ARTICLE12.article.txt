## Editorial Board Cramping our style 
### 
Bluebooks are cramping our style. Lit
erally. Writing intensive, three-hour
handwritten exams inevitably leads
to painful hand cramps, limiting students'
ability to perform well and fully demon
strate what has been learned. Compounding
this problem is the fact that students fre
quently find themselves facing multiple
exams in a short time span — experiences of
two back to back three-hour exams are by
no means rare — and six hours of continu
ous scribbling would surely lead to sore ab
ductor policies, aching joints and substan
dard work. Perhaps it is time for our teach
ing faculty to see that if they really want the
best demonstrated results, they should allow
students to type, rather than handwrite,
their exams.
The advantages of typed exams out
weigh. handily, the disadvantages.The com
puter has been for years now the primary
mode of work in this day and age. Barring
occasions when we draw graphs or write
formulas, students of our generation feel
most comfortable working in a digital envi
ronment. When typing an exam, students
fully utilize the flexibility of word process
ing to outline their responses, restructure,
skip questions and return to them. The
quality of writing is likely more sophisticat
ed than what is produced when one is asked
to handwrite pages and pages (legibly, if
you please) in a limited timeframe.
Some professors already allow students
to type their exams. In small seminars espe
cially, students may be left alone to type, let
ting them write significantly more with
much less throbbing hand pain. At the end
of the exam period,students simply email in
their final exams with a written Honor

Code statement at the bottom. The result is
a more agreeable exam experience for stu
dents and an easier grading experience for
professors.
There are those who might argue that al
lowing students laptops for their finals
would represent too strong a temptation,
tantamount to encouraging unprecedented
levels of cheating. However, Stanford
proudly boasts of its Honor Code: "The fac
ulty on its part manifests its confidence in
the honor of its students by refraining from
proctoring examinations and from taking
unusual and unreasonable precautions to
prevent...dishonesty."
If professors are concerned, there is al
ways the option of blocking Internet access
for the examination room, although stu
dents from potentially reading notes of
fline. Yet students, despite being discour
aged from bringing physical notes to exams
for pre-test studying to eliminate tempta
tion, still cheat. After all. is the siren song of
Google or Wikipedia that much more entic
ing than a complete study guide resting
below one's chair or painstakingly in
scribed along the (sleeve-covered, no
doubt) forearm? While letting students
type their exams on laptops does increase
outlets for cheating, if professors and stu
dents truly believe in their vaunted Honor
Code, they should have nothing to fear.
Unless one is taking ATHLETICS 150:
Total Body Workout, the purpose of exams
is to test for knowledge, not stamina and en
durance. Hand cramps should not prevent a
student from doing his or her best work on
an exam. The only thing left is to go from
digital to digital on our exams — it's the
right thing to do.
