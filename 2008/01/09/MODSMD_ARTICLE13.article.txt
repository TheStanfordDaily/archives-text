# The 						Lowly Interns
## A 						national mandate 
### 
So I have a problem. I've been trying to
convince myself during winter break
that it wasn't really that big of a prob
lem. that it wouldn't matter that much, that
no one would notice ... hopefully.
But 1 knew I was deceiving myself. Like a
skeleton hidden behind all the other skele
tons in the closet, the truth would eventual
ly come out. And I would rather you hear it
from me than from anyone else. O loyal
reader.
Brace yourself.
Okay, so you know how my column was
supposed to be all about my thoughts and
exploits in D.C.? We 11... I'm not exactly in
Washington anymore. In fact, I'm back
home, back on campus. And you know how
this column is titled. "The Lowly Interns?"
Well. I'm not exactly an intern anymore.
And by "not exactly," I mean I'm not.
Look, I know you're upset. I know you
are. But don't worry! It's still me! I still love
you all as much as I did when I was writing
in view of the Washington Monument! I
don't know if I can say the same for Michael
— he kind of hates the world right now be
cause he's living in a basement.
So, henceforth, I shall write as "A Lowly
Student" (the lowly part never really goes
away) writing about "out-of-Washington"
Washington things.
Down to business: I couldn't call myself a
respectable columnist (and perhaps I still
can't) unless I weigh in on the presidential
election. I'll just make one point.. While I
was in D.C., 1 had the opportunity to take a
class on the American Presidency with a
widely published presidential historian
named Robert Dallek. There is one bit of
knowledge that Dallek imparted that seems
especially pertinent to the primaries today.
His lesson was this: In looking at elec
tions across American history, the most
powerful presidents — who also tend to be
the most successful ones — were those who
won their elections with broad support out
side their own party.
Often our candidates focus too deeply on
doing all they can just to win the general
election. It was essentially the Bush-Rove
"50 percent + I" strategy in 2(XK) that elicit
ed the first electoral-popular vote split in
112 years.
There's one problem with this system:
While it can result in victory (George W.
Bush did. of course, win in 2(XX)). it impairs
the winner's power once he actually ascends
to the White House. The other two winners
in American history where there was an
electoral-popular vote split. Benjamin Har
rison and Rutherford B. Hayes, were presi

dents that most people don't remember and
were characterized by relative weakness
once in office. I mean, how many of you ac
tually recognize those names?
I'm not suggesting that a weak margin of
victory creates an inevitably weak presi
dent. Of course, the specific policies a presi
dent tries to support and the political lean
ings of Congress, among other factors, will
also determine his influence and power. A
candidate who wants to win the mandate of
the entire country rather than a particular
subset, however, needs to overtly speak to
his willingness to include all groups.
Whether a candidate is a frontrunner or lag
ging at the bottom of the polls, the message
should still be one of unity and community.
The alternative to at least attempting to
gain a broad and deep support base is ugly.
Let's say — just for the sake of argument —
that there's a candidate who has been the
frontrunner for most of the primary season.
Let's call this candidate Helena Clintonian .
. just for the sake of argument. She may
want to avoid making statements that gen
eralize members of the other party as part of
an "attack machine." Even if such a candi
date goes on to win the White House, I don't
think voters will be particularly willing to lis
ten once she has antagonized half the coun
try.
When our fully theoretical, make-be
lieve, pretend candidate says that she's
ready to lead on Day One, she should in
stead be trying to prove that she'll make a
robust investment in bipartisanship. Rather
than demonizing her political opponents,
she must actually show her willingness to
talk to them, to reason with them.
Until that happens, our Ms. Clintonian
will never be the president this country
needs. While she may win the nomination
and even the presidency itself, if she does,
she'll be looking forward to four years of ad
ministrative agony.

Sagar and Michael Wilkerson co-write " The
Lowly Interns," although it may he high time
for a name change. You can contact either of
