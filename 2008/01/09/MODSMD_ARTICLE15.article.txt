## The 						GOP gets desperate...really desperate 
### 
It is often said that Democrats fall in love
with their nominee, but Republicans fall
in line. Yet for the first time in modern
memory, the Republican Party has had trou
ble picking one. As one scholar has pointed
out, between 1952 and 2004. only one elec
tion (1%4) did not contain a Nixon. Bush or
Dole on the ballot. But this election is unique
and difficult for the Republicans: An unpop
ular president waging an unpopular war and
a party fresh off a roundhouse kick to the
face in the 2006 midterm elections.
The very early frontrunner for the nomi
nation was John McCain, who had evolved
from a maverick in 2(KX) to a steadfast Bush
supporter in 2004. He was thought to be the
pick of the Bush White House and the politi
cal establishment. Then McCain's candidacy
imploded with poor fundraising numbers,
which necessitated that he fire most of his
staff.
Sometime around then. Rudy Giuliani
took over, despite concerns about his pro
choice and pro-gay positions. But his obvious
inability to compete in lowa or New Hamp
shire (he came in sixth in the former and
fourth in the latter) means he has to wait until
Florida three weeks from now to even have a
chance at the nomination.
Fred Thompson had his moment too. lead
ing in the polls as soon as he entered the race
(much later than the other candidates), but
his support began to drop immediately there
after. He was barely able to piece together a
third-place finish in an lowa race uncontest
ed by Giuliani and McCain. Romney then
picked up where Giuliani couldn't, leading in
lowa and New Hampshire polls. But Rorn
ney's attempt to balance business conserva
tives and evangelicals failed, and he finished
second in both lowa and New Hampshire.

Mike Huckabee won lowa but had no chance
in New Hampshire, and seems to alienate
enough people that he'll never gain enough
support in the big Feb. 5 states to have a seri
ous chance.
The inability of any candidate to over
come his flaws and rise to the nomination
poses a serious problem for the Republican
Party. The Democrats are good at picking a
nominee at the last minute and still compet
ing (Bill Clinton didn't win lowa or New
Hampshire),but it is unclear whether the Re
publicans can survive a vicious succession of
primaries and unite in time for the fall cam
paign season. While the Democratic Party
seems to have settled on Barack Obama or
Hillary Clinton as likely nominees, the Re
publican fight will carry on for some time.
This will drain Republicans of resources,
further divide the party into ideological
camps (business types versus evangelicals,
moderates versus hardliners, neoconserva
tives versus paleoconservatives) and likely,
alienate enough voters that a pillar of the
base doesn't turn out. and the Democrats
win.
One of the advantages of the Republicans
in presidential races has been their willing
ness to fall into line. The party establishment
picks a nominee, all of the factions unite be
hind him, and the party moves forward, or

gani7.ed and united, while the Democrats
bicker and procrastinate on picking a nomi
nee. It should also he noted that Republicans
have won five of the last seven presidential
elections.
The conventional wisdom is that the party
is going to have to hold its nose and nominate
John McCain, as he might be the one least
tainted by early-state defeats or. in Giuliani's
case, not even bothering to compete. Mc-
Cain's problem is immigration: He supported
President Bush on comprehensive immigra
tion reform. Huckabec and Romney, mean
while, step all over themselves, trying to
sound as anti-immigrant as possible despite
their ambivalent records. Several of the
fringe candidates such as Duncan Hunter
and Pom lancredo ran as essentially single
issue candidates on immigration. Anything'
even approaching amnesty is anathema to
the party base. McCain is lucky, however, that
the issue has faded from the public con
sciousness (it brought about his decline from
frontrunner to fourth place during the sum
mer).
It's unclear whether McCain would stand
a chance against Obama in a national race,
but he seems to be the OOP's best bet. He
would offer a stark contrast: a principled, ex
perienced senator and veteran, hawkish on
foreign policy, versus the gauzy, fresh-faced
and ambitious Obama. He's been mostly,
though not entirely, consistent in his policy
positions over the years, something that is
strangely important to the American people.
It would be a generational battle that shapes
the political agenda for the decade following
the conclusion of the Bush Administration.
