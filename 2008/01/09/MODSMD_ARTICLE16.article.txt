## MEN SET TO FACE UCLA No. 8 Stanford heads into league opener 2-0 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
With Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) play set to begin this weekend, the
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team finds it
self in an unfamiliar position — undefeated.
The Cardinal took second place in last week
end's Elephant Bar Tournament in Santa Bar
bara. losing the championship match to Cana
da's top-ranked team. Alberta, a non-NCAA
foe. As a result, the loss did not count against
the team's record.
The Cardinal (2-0) will be looking to im
prove on a season which saw the team finish 3-
22 and in 11th place in the MPSF. With six
starters from that team returning — libero
Brian Lindberg was the only player to gradu
ate — and one of the nation's best recruiting
classes, Stanford could surpass its 2007 win
total this weekend.
Senior captain and current MPSF Player of
the Week Matt Ceran anchors the Cardinal of
fense, with a 60-kill performance this past
weekend.
"Right now he is our team leader, and he
leads us on the floor as an outside hitter." head
coach John Kosty said. "He is playing like a
senior and doing exactly what the team needs
him to do."
Sophomore Evan Romero is a powerful
right side hitter who started as a freshman and
was second to Ceran in Santa Barbara.
Romero was the top hitter in 2007 with 332
kills while Ceran was a close second with 322.
The middle blocking tandem of junior
Brandon Williams and sophomore Garrett
Werner also returns, after each hit over .300
and notched at least 65 blocks last year.
Sophomore Kawika Shoji. who set and also
played outside hitter last year, returns as the
quarterback of the team. 1 le tallied more than
1(X) assists in the team's first weekend of ac
tion.
Shoji. Romero, Warner and Fid Howell all
saw significant action as freshmen, thrown
into action from the beginning.
"That was a process we wanted them to go
through," Kosty said of their trial under fire.
"They have learned a lot and are better off for
it.and 1 think they are hungrier to win because
of it."
In the back row. junior Jarod Keller has
been sharing the libero spot with freshman
Jordan Inafuku. while fellow freshman
Spencer McLachlin is starting on the outside.

impact for us," Kosty said."He has moved into
the starting position at outside hitter and has
played very consistently in all the matches he
has played. Me is doing exactly what we need
him to do coming in as a freshman."
Inafuku and McLachlin, one of the top re
cruits in the nation and I iawaii State Player of
the Year, are among six freshmen on the roster
for the Cardinal, making a relatively young
team even younger than last year.The pair are
joined by fellow freshmen outside hitter lan
Connolly and middle blockers Garrett Dobbs,
Max Halvorson and Charley Henrickson.
'Hie last time Stanford had more than four
wins was in 2005, but this year's team has al
ready upset the defending national champion
and broken into the top five in the AVCA poll.
The Cardinal began the season ranked No. 13
— the upset of then-No. 5 UC Irvine bumped
Stanford up in the rankings.
In the preseason MPSF poll, the Cardinal
was picked to finish ninth out of 12 with No. 2
Pepperdine. top-ranked Brigham Young and

No. 4 UCLA at the top of the list.
"I think there are a couple of really good
teams out there this year," Kosty said. "In the
MFSF in particular, it is going to he a battle
from top to bottom. Before league play. BYU
and Pepperdine are one and two. but I think
they are beatable — they are not going to be
as dominant as in the past."
Despite the strength of the MPSF — which
boasts ten of the nation's top 15 teams —
Kosty believes his team has the talent to be in
the mix.
"1 truly do," he said."l think there are prob
ably eight teams in the MPSF who have the
ability [to compete in the conference]. It will
be a really fun battle all the way through the
season."
The Cardinal will begin MPSF play on the
road this weekend,visiting UCLA before a re
match with UC Irvine.
