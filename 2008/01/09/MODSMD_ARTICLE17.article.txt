## 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It's only one week into the season and the
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team is al
ready one victory away from matching its
win total from a year ago. At the UCSB Ele
phant Bar Tournament over the weekend,
the then-No. 13 Cardinal heat No. 8 Cal-State
Northridge and No. 7 UC-lrvine — the de
fending national champion — before losing
to Canadian powerhouse Alberta.
"It was a great all-around weekend," head
coach John Kosty said. "We beat two league
opponents which boosted our confidence
heading into this upcoming weekend, where
we're starting MPSF play."
Stanford claimed second place in the
tournament, a vast improvement from last
year's result — the team did not win a single
match in the 2007 tournament.

MAI CH NOTES: Stanford defeated defending national
champion UC Irvine (1 -1) to reach the championship
game of the UCSB Elephant Bar Tournament. Senior
Matt Ceran led the way for the Cardinal with 19 kills,
sophomore Evan Romero finished with 16 kills and
freshman Spencer McLachlin finished the match with
10 kills. In the championship match, the Cardinal fell
3-1 in against University of Alberta; because Alberta is
not in the NCAA, the match did not count against the
team's official record.

"One of the big changes we have made
from last year to this year is that we are a lit
tle bigger and a little faster and we have a lit
tle bit better ball control," Kosty said. "That
made for a very successful tournament."
Outside hitter Matt Ceran. the lone sen
ior on the roster, and sophomore setter
Kawika Shoji were both named to the All-
Tournament Team on Saturday. Ceran, who
was also named Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) Player of the Week, led
the team in kills in all three matches, finish
ing with 60 on the weekend.
In the first match of the tournament on
Friday, Stanford earned a hard-fought four
game win over Northridge, 30-27, 30-25,28-
30, 32-30. Ceran tallied 19 kills, while fresh
man outside hitter Spencer McLaehlin
chipped in 13. Sophomore opposite Evan
Romero added 12 kills and also notched a
service ace on the final point of the match.
Ceran also had a match-high 18 digs while
freshman libero Jordan Inafuku finished
with 17. Sophomore Kawika Shoji, an All-
Conference selection last year, had 44 assists
and a team-high three aces in the win.
Hie Cardinal's strong finish in the fourth
game was a good sign for a team that strug
gled to finish games last season. In 25 match-
es in 2007, Stanford lost 14 games by
only a two-point margin and eight
more by just th'ee.
Ceran matched his kill tally from
the first match on Friday evening in
the upset of UC Irvine, then ranked
No. 5 in the country. Stanford won
the first two games, 30-21 and 30-28,
but the Anteaters evened the match
with a pair of 30-28 wins.The Cardi
nal took control of the tiebreaking
fifth game, however, winning 15-10.
Behind Ceran. Romero had 16 kills
and McLachlin added 10.
In the tournament's champi
onship match, the Cardinal faced Al
berta, the top-ranked squad in ( ana
da and a team that had already lost
once to Stanford this season. Stan
ford broke Alberta's 24-match win
ning streak against MPSF teams in
the Husky Dino Cup back in Octo
ber.
In Santa Barbara, though. Alber
ta came out on top. winning in four
games, 30-26. 30-23, 21-30. 30-25.
Ceran recorded a match-high 22 kills
and Romero added 16.
"Matt Ceran had a great tourna
ment," Kosty said "1 le had 22 kills
and hit .486 against Alberta —he
had a tremendous match against a
very good opponent."
junior Jarod Keller, who has been
splitting time at libero with freshman
Jordan Inafuku. led all players with
15 digs.
Stanford will get no respite this
week, with more top teams on their
schedule. The Cardinal will begin
MPSF play on the road this week
end, visiting UCLA before a re
match with Irvine.
The team's first home match will
be next Tuesday evening against UC-
San Diego. Two of Stanford's three
wins on the season last year came
against the Tritons.
