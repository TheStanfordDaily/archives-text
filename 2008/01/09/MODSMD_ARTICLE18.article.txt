# It's okay to hate on the Pats
## 
### 
Sometimes in sports, there is rea
son for optimism, even when it's
hard to say exaetly why that rea
son exists. The palpable swing in mo
mentum after a big dunk in basketball
which signals a change in the game
even though your team is still way
down on the scoreboard. The jarring
hit that looks like any other tackle on
the stat sheet but electrifies an entire
team on the field. The walk that, on
the surface, means little but seems to
hint at a general loss of control or
composure by a normally dominant
pitcher.
Little things have a way of becom
ing big things in sports — that's just
the way it is.and while personally, I'm
not superstitious. 1 do worship at the
church of momentum. It's a good
thing really. It keeps us on our toes,
ready for anything, ready for the
turnaround that, while rare, is occa
sionally so forceful it's impossible to
forget.
Think Sox-Yankees in '04. Think
Warriors-Mavs last year, from the
moment you realized Dirk couldn't
do anything.Think Stanford-USC and
the goal line stand at the end of the
first half which made you think that
maybe there really was a chance.
And that's why it's so hard to
admit that, unless Bill Belichick.Tom
Brady and Randy Moss are all ab
ducted by aliens in the coming days,
the Patriots basically have this NFL
season wrapped up.
I generally hate making sports pre
dictions because 1 can usually see the
other side of the argument. But there
really isn't another side here, unless
you're willing to build it from thin air.
1 mean, sure, the Jaguars have a mon
strous defensive line. And sure, they
have the running game to slug it out in
the snow. So. maybe, if they play Sun
day's game in a blizzard so fierce that
Brady can't see any receivers further
than ten yards downfield, the Jaguars
might have a chance.
But any argument against the Pa
triots winning this weekend, or the
one after that,or even the Super Bowl
kind of leaves you feeling like you're
trying a little too hard,doesn't it? Like
you came up with a fantasy just to
hold off the inevitable realization that
this team is going to be crowned the
best ever by national pundits nation
wide in just a few short weeks. And
I'm guessing that unless you're from
New England, that makes you kind of
sick to think about, right?
Well, I'm here to tell you that it's
okay. Sure, you'll be called a "hater"
by some for turning against the fa
vorites and refusing to believe the
hyped-up label of "greatest of all
time" after the fact. But there may

never have been a situation in sports
that has called for being a hater as
much as what we face now in the
NFL.
As football fans, we have only re
cently witnessed the death of the so
called era of parity. You remember —
the days when it was routine to see a
team go from last to first in a matter
of months, not decades. When year
after inexplicable year, we saw
strange new Super Bowl matchups:
Rams vs. Titans. Buccaneers vs.
Raiders and Ravens vs. Giants all
come to mind.
Indeed, parity itself, which had
been the league's goal in introducing
new free agency rules in the late 9()'s.
became somewhat tiresome. What
was called exciting, unpredictable
football by some was lambasted as
league-wide mediocrity by others.
Well, those others shouldn't have
much to complain about now be
cause. more than ever, the NFL has
become a league of haves and have
nots.
Of course there have been dy nas

ties in the past — some of which
probably could rival this Patriots
team. But those dynasties always
seemed to be opposed by others. The
49ers had to deal with the Cowboys,
the Steelers with the Raiders and the
Packers of Vince Lombardi with the
Tom Landry's Cowboys.
Now? It's the Patriots and every
one else.The Indianapolis Colts are a
very, very good team. The Packers
and Cowboys are solid newcomers in
the NFC. And the Jaguars and Giants,
though somewhat one-dimensional,
both do what they do very well in
deed.
But there is only one truly great
team in the league today. And that's
a shame, really, because it has put a
whole new kind of inevitability into
the NFL. Which is why 1 really hope
I see that hit. fumble or long pass on
Saturday which makes me believe
anything can happen once again.
But I doubt it will.
So if you feel the need, don't feel
too bad about "hating on the Patri
ots." It's not their fault no one else
could keep up, but that doesn't mean
we have to like it.
