# It's okay to hate on the Pats
## 
### 
Sometimes in sports, there is rea
son for optimism, even when it's
hard to say exaetly why that rea
son exists. The palpable swing in mo
mentum after a big dunk in basketball
which signals a change in the game
even though your team is still way
down on the scoreboard. The jarring
hit that looks like any other tackle on
the stat sheet but electrifies an entire
team on the field. The walk that, on
the surface, means little but seems to
hint at a general loss of control or
composure by a normally dominant
pitcher.
Little things have a way of becom
ing big things in sports â€” that's just
the way it is.and while personally, I'm
not superstitious. 1 do worship at the
church of momentum. It's a good
thing really. It keeps us on our toes,
ready for anything, ready for the
turnaround that, while rare, is occa
sionally so forceful it's impossible to
forget.
Think Sox-Yankees in '04. Think
Warriors-Mavs last year, from the
moment you realized Dirk couldn't
do anything.Think Stanford-USC and
the goal line stand at the end of the
first half which made you think that
maybe there really was a chance.
And that's why it's so hard to
admit that, unless Bill Belichick.Tom
Brady and Randy Moss are all ab
ducted by aliens in the coming days,
the Patriots basically have this NFL
season wrapped up.
I generally hate making sports pre
dictions because 1 can usually see the
other side of the argument. But there
really isn't another side here, unless
you're willing to build it from thin air.
1 mean, sure, the Jaguars have a mon
strous defensive line. And sure, they
have the running game to slug it out in
the snow. So. maybe, if they play Sun
day's game in a blizzard so fierce that
Brady can't see any receivers further
than ten yards downfield, the Jaguars
might have a chance.
But any argument against the Pa
triots winning this weekend, or the
one after that,or even the Super Bowl
kind of leaves you feeling like you're
trying a little too hard,doesn't it? Like
you came up with a fantasy just to
hold off the inevitable realization that
this team is going to be crowned the
best ever by national pundits nation
wide in just a few short weeks. And
I'm guessing that unless you're from
New England, that makes you kind of
sick to think about, right?
Well, I'm here to tell you that it's
okay. Sure, you'll be called a "hater"
by some for turning against the fa
vorites and refusing to believe the
hyped-up label of "greatest of all
time" after the fact. But there may
