# Winter break wins for Card
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling concluded a
busy winter break schedule Sunday,
sweeping a trio of duals in the
Northeast in dominant fashion. The
strong finish capped a flood of com
petition in which the squad squared
off against five opponents in three
days.
The Cardinal (6-1) downed four
of its opponents over that span in
convincing fashion. The run con
cluded with a sweep on Sunday
over East Stroudsburg. Princeton
and Wagner. East Stroudsburg and
Princeton fell first, by scores of 29-
16 and 32-10, respectively, before
Stanford demolished Wagner in a
shutout. 52-0. Wagner was only able
to stay close in one match, as they
lost nine of ten by at least ten
points.
No. 6 senior Tanner Gardner at
125 pounds pinned all three of his
opponents on the day, and his team
mates largely followed suit as the
Cardinal collected a total of ten pins
against its three opponents. Red
shirt freshman Lucas Espericueta at

GAME NOTES: Stanford will open its Rac-10
season against No. 25 Boise State. The Car
dinal heads into conference action after a
strong winter break showing. Stanford de
feated four of the five opponents it faced in a
three day span over the break.

Miller, 165 pounds, and Jake John
son. 197 pounds, also went 3-0 on the
day to help carry the Cardinal. No.
16 senior Josh Zupancic was unde
feated in his pair of matches.
On Friday, the Cardinal wrestled
another pair of duals and came
away with a split, defeating Drexel
24-12 before falling to Lehigh 21-
16. Highlighting Stanford's win

against Drexcl was Zupancic's vic
tory over fellow All-American, No.
8 Ryan Hluschak, 157 pounds, in a
4-2, overtime decision.The win over
Hluschak was Zupancic's 2()th on
the season and secured an impres
sive fourth straight 20-win season
for the senior. Johnson, Espericueta
and Gardner also came up big for
the Cardinal — all three notched
wins by major decision.
Coach Kerry McCoy's Cardinal
came up just short at Lehigh,
though, losing six of ten matches
against the Mountain Hawks in
Bethlehem. Penn. McCoy worked
as an assistant coach at Lehigh be
fore coming to the Farm two and a
half years ago, and while he just
missed a win on his return to Lee
man- Ihrner Arena, several of his
wrestlers put forth strong showings.
Gardner pinned his opponent at
2:24. while Johnson and Zupancic
each won by decision, 12-10 and 8-2,
respectively. Sophomore Zach
Giesen at 184 pounds rounded out
the Stanford victories against

Gardner (25-1), Zupancic (23-

action due to injury.
