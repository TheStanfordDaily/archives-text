# Top universities revise aid policies
## Some early admits to Class of 2012 express frustration with Stanford aid packages 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
As high school seniors across the
country anxiously watch their mail
boxes during this college admission
season, there is a new worry on their
minds â€” the increasing cost of attend
ing private universities. With the fears
of middle-class families in mind, how
ever, financial aid offices at private in
stitutions are digging a bit deeper into
their pockets to lend a helping hand.
The latest move comes from Har
vard, whose president announced last
month a sweeping overhaul of finan
cial aid policies designed to make the
Cambridge, Mass. school more afford
able for families across the income
spectrum, specifically those designat
ed as middle- and upper-middle-in
come families.
Harvard's new policy, which will go
into effect in the 2008-2009 academic
year, will charge such families 10 per
cent of their family household income
per year and will increase total annual
aid to $120 million from $98 million.
For families earning between $ 120,000
and $180,000, Harvard's new policy

will largely subsidize the school's an
nual cost of moie than $45,600.
In an effort to ease the financial
burden of education here at Stanford,
institutional need-based scholarship
funding was increased 15.2 percent for
the current academic year to $76 mil
lion, up from $66 million last year.
Stanford also reduced the amount of
home equity assessed in aid calcula
tions by capping the amount consid
ered at 1.5 times the family income, re
ducing parent contributions by an av
erage of $2,000 per year.
In comparison. Harvard will no
longer consider home equity in calcu
lating aid, resulting in an average re
duction of $4,000 per year for parents.
Harvard officials have said they do not
want families borrowing against their
homes in order to send students to
their university.
Stanford's Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper said in an email to
The Daily that even without changes,
Stanford's aid program remains
strong.
"I believe our financial aid pro
gram is one of the strongest in the
country and we can all be proud of the

University's commitment to financial
aid," she said.
Cooper also said that "Stanford re
mains strongly committed to its long
standing policy of admitting talented
students regardless of a student's abil
ity to pay," a "need blind" admission
policy reportedly shared by few other
universities in the nation. Harvard in
cluded.
Stanford and Harvard are not the
only private universities to expand fi
nancial aid. Princeton, Yale. Columbia,
UPenn and Duke represent a handful
of other institutions that have recently
increased aid for lower- and middle
class families.
Despite improvements in Stan
ford's financial aid program, many
early admits remain speculative.
"I would like to see more scholar
ships/grants instead of jobs/loans in
terms of financial aid distribution,"
wrote early admit Kyle Wong of
Brooklyn, N.Y. in an email to The
Daily. "Even though Stanford is my
first choice, the smaller the 'discount,'
the more hesitant I am to attend."
Another early admit, Troy Wu, who
is from Memphis, attributed his hesita

tion to accept Stanford's admission
offer to relative differences between
Stanford's aid program and those of
other competitive universities.
"Stanford's does not meet par," Wu
wrote in an email weighing Stanford's
program against those at Harvard and
Yale, if Stanford had [Harvard or
Yale's] plan. I would have committed
to Stanford the day 1 got accepted and
stopped applying to other schools to
compare packages."
Cooper said any changes to Stan
ford's financial aid program will be an
nounced this quarter.
"As we do every year, the Universi
ty is currently reviewing its financial
aid program to consider whether en
hancements can be made that will
make a Stanford education more ac
cessible and affordable," she said.
Currently a luxury' for private uni
versities, independent control of finan
cial aid programs may face external
controls in the future. Members of
Congress have recently shed light on
the fact that tuition has outpaced infla
tion by about three percentage points
for the past quarter-century. Ac
cording to 'ITie New York Times,
Congress is now considering
whether universities should be re
quired to spend a minimum amount
of endowment earnings on student
aid.
Without acknowledging pressure
from Congress, Yale announced
Monday it will increase the ZOOS
ZOO 1 ) spending from its endowment
by 37 percent to $1.15 billion, a por
tion of which will be prioritized for
financial aid. According to The Wall
Street Journal, a similar announce
ment from Harvard closely fol
lowed.
