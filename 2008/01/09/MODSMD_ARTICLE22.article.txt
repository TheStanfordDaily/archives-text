# Gibbs leaves NFL again
## Redskins coach returning to NASCAR 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Joe Gibbs' second NFL retirement was much like
his first. It came as a surprise, and it was all about fami
ly-
On the one-year anniversary of his grandson's diag
nosis with leukemia, and less than a year after one of his
sons left town to return to the family NASCAR team,
Gibbs resigned Tuesday as coach of the Washington
Redskins so that he couid devote more time to what he
called "the most important thing I'm going to leave on
this earth."
The 67-year-old Hall of Fame coach, coming off an
emotional season that included the death of safety
Sean Taylor and a late run into the playoffs, said Red
skins owner Dan Snyder tried to persuade him to stay
on during a conversation that lasted until about 2:30
a.m. Iliesday.
"My family situation being what it is right now, 1 told

him I couldn't make the kind of commitment 1 needed
to make," Gibbs said during a news conference at the
Redskins' practice facility, standing a few feet from the
three silver Super Bowl trophies he won during his first
tenure with the team.
Speaking about his family. Gibbs added: "I felt like
they needed me."
Snyder said he "tried very, very hard" retain Gibbs
as coach.
"This is something none of us wanted to see hap
pen." the owner said.
The news startled players, who left Sunday's final
team meeting certain Gibbs would return for the final
year of his contract. Gibbs signed a five-year. $27.5 mil
lion deal when he returned to coach the Redskins in
2004. having been lured away from his second career as
a NASCAR owner.
"That's part of this business — it's full of surprises."
safety Pierson Prioleau said. "Most of us suspected he
would be back, and he'll definitely be missed."
Gibbs will continue to serve as an adviser to Snvder
but was vague about his new role,
other than to say he would no longer
have an office at Redskins Park be
cause it would place an unfair burden
on the new coach.
"1 think we've got a lot of pieces in
place," Gibbs said. "I personally want
to be a part of that. I want to see it fin
ished. Our fans deserve champi
onships. I want to be a part of seeing
that come to fruition."
Among the candidates to replace
him will be two former head coaches
who have been members of his staff,
Gregg Williams and A 1 Saunders. For
mer Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher
also could be a candidate. The team
will have to interview at least one mi
nority to comply with the NFL's
"Rooney Rule" as it seeks the sixth
coach since Snvder bought the team
in 1999.
Snyder said the process to find a
replacement hadn't started and that

he hasn't spoken to Cowher about the
job. He and Gibbs praised the current
group of assistants and spoke of the
value of continuity following a play
off season, a possible sign that player
favorite Williams could have the in
side track.
"Coach Williams is a great coach,"
said fullback Mike Sellers, one of sev
eral players to endorse the fiery assis
tant hired to run the defense in 2004.
"The players love him. It would be
sad to see him not get it."
When Gibbs retired in 1993. he re
alized his two sons had grown up
without him. Fifteen years later, he
didn't want the same to happen with
the seven people he lovingly calls his
"grandbabies." One of his grandsons,
3-year-old Taylor, undergoes
chemotherapy every few weeks. Also,
his son Coy left his job as an assistant
coach with the Redskins last year to
return to North Carolina and work
with Joe Gibbs Racing.
That left Gibbs alone in Washing
ton. apart from his wife, sons and
grandchildren. He made an overnight
trip to North Carolina on Sunday to
be with his family, interrupting the
postseason routine of meetings that
usually follow the final game of the
season.
"I had real good visits with every
body, and at that point when I started
back to D.C. and got on the plane that
afternoon. I kind of had a real strong

feeling in my heart of what 1 felt like 1
should do," Gibbs said.
Gibbs went 31-36, including 1-2 in
the playoffs, in his second stint with
the Redskins, always maintaining he
intended to fulfill the contract. He
said this season was the toughest of
his career, referring to Taylor's shoot
ing in November, but pointed to his
family as the chief reason for his res
ignation.
"I hate to leave something unfin
ished. 1 made an original commitment
of five years. I felt bad about that."
Gibbs said, his voice occasionally
choking with emotion.
Tuesday's announcement brings
an end to a coaching career in which
Gibbs twice raised the Redskins from
mediocrity into the playoffs. He led
the Redskins to four Super Bowls and
won three NFL championships from
1981-92; he took the team to the post
season in two of his four seasons
when he returned.
"1 give him all the credit for put
ting us in great position for the fu
ture," Snyder said. "He's done a great
job of stabilizing a situation that be
came unstable before, quite frankly."
Even so, Gibbs' last four years
were down-and-up, down-and-up. He
had his two worst seasons as a coach
-6-10 in 2004 and 5-11 in 2006 —
but he also led the Redskins to the
playoffs with late runs in 2005 and
2007.

sad to see him not get it."
When Gibbs retired in 1993. he re
alized his two sons had grown up
without him. Fifteen years later, he
didn't want the same to happen with
the seven people he lovingly calls his
"grandbabies." One of his grandsons,
3-year-old Taylor, undergoes
chemotherapy every few weeks. Also,
his son Coy left his job as an assistant
coach with the Redskins last year to
return to North Carolina and work
with Joe Gibbs Racing.
That left Gibbs alone in Washing
ton. apart from his wife, sons and
grandchildren. He made an overnight
trip to North Carolina on Sunday to
be with his family, interrupting the
postseason routine of meetings that
usually follow the final game of the
season.
"I had real good visits with every
body, and at that point when I started
back to D.C. and got on the plane that
afternoon. I kind of had a real strong

feeling in my heart of what 1 felt like 1
should do," Gibbs said.
Gibbs went 31-36, including 1-2 in
the playoffs, in his second stint with
the Redskins, always maintaining he
intended to fulfill the contract. He
said this season was the toughest of
his career, referring to Taylor's shoot
ing in November, but pointed to his
family as the chief reason for his res
ignation.
"I hate to leave something unfin
ished. 1 made an original commitment
of five years. I felt bad about that."
Gibbs said, his voice occasionally
choking with emotion.
Tuesday's announcement brings
an end to a coaching career in which
Gibbs twice raised the Redskins from
mediocrity into the playoffs. He led
the Redskins to four Super Bowls and
won three NFL championships from
1981-92; he took the team to the post
season in two of his four seasons
when he returned.
"1 give him all the credit for put
ting us in great position for the fu
ture," Snyder said. "He's done a great
job of stabilizing a situation that be
came unstable before, quite frankly."
Even so, Gibbs' last four years
were down-and-up, down-and-up. He
had his two worst seasons as a coach
-6-10 in 2004 and 5-11 in 2006 —
but he also led the Redskins to the
playoffs with late runs in 2005 and
2007.
