## QUALITY CHANGE IN CAMPUS TAP WATER 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Tap water across campus may ap
pear cloudy or milky-white starting
this week due to system maintenance
by the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC), Stanford's
water supplier. The color change is

due to air bubbles and does not
change the quality of the water.
Tracy Ingebrigsten, the environ
mental quality engineer for the Uni
versity's Facilities Operations, ex
plained that the SFPUC performs
maintenance each year in January or
February. Water use is at its lowest
during these months — both by the
University and by other SFPUC
users throughout the region — due
to frequent rain, which makes it un
necessary to water plants as often.
"We anticipate that this will be an
annual event," Ingebrigsten said.

The change in water quality usual
ly lasts for two weeks, she said, though
it could last for up to a month. During
this time, the SFPUC is updating its
system to make it more reliable, so
that in the case of an earthquake
water supply will not be lost.
During this maintenance period,
the University is acquiring water
from a local source. This alternative
water supply requires more exten
sive treatment than the Hetch
I letchy Reservoir, where the SFPUC
water comes from, resulting in the
milky-white air bubbles.
