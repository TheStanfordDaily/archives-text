### RONALD BLUM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK - On his first day as a
Hall of Famer, Goose Gossage tossed
some high, hard ones at Roger
Clemens and Barry Bonds.
"I think that if you did do perform
ance-enhancing drugs, you need to
come clean and put an end to this,"
Gossage said. "Just fess up."
After falling short eight times, Gos
sage received 85.8 percent of the vote
TUesday, easily surpassing the 75 per
cent threshold for baseball's highest
honor and becoming just the fifth re
liever in Cooperstown's bullpen.
Angry that the Steroids Era has
skewed statistics, Gossage said Bonds
and Clemens were in the same situa
tion as far as he was concerned. Both
have been accused of using steroids.
"Now we've got to figure out who's
telling the truth, and 1 think that some
day we will know the truth," Gossage

said.
Gossage said players shouldn't be
afraid of admitting they used perform
ance-enhancing drugs. He cited
Clemens'close friend, Yankees pitcher
Andy Pettitte.
"Pettitte came clean. There's been
other guys that said they did it," Gos
sage said."Life is going to go on."
Mark McGwire, his image in shreds
since telling Congress in 2005 that he
wouldn't talk about the past, received
128 votes from 10-year members of the
Baseball Writers' Association of
America - matching the total from last
year, when he was eligible for the first
time. His percentage was 23.6 percent.
"I don't think this steroid thing is
over by any means. I'm sure that most
of you guys, the writers, don't really
know how to approach this." Gossage
during a BBWAA conference call.
Known for his overpowering fast
ball, fiery temperament and bushy
mustache, the Goose received 466 of

543 votes.
"It was very emotional I'll tell you,
off the charts. I can't describe the feel
ing," he said after learning the news. "I
can't lie.There's been some frustration
and some disappointment."
Jim Rice was passed over yet again
in his next-to-last year on the ballot,
getting 392 votes (72.2 percent), up
from 346 (63.5 percent) last year but 16
short of the 75 percent needed.
"Today's results are obviously a dis
appointment," Rice said in a state
ment."! believe my accomplishments
speak for themselves, and a majority of
the voters seem to agree. It is tough to
come this close, but I remain hopeful
for the 2009 results."
Gossage, who fell short by 21 votes
last year, was on just 33.3 percent of the
ballots when he appeared for the first
time in 2000. He joins Hoyt Wilhelm
(1985), Rollie Fingers (1992), Dennis
Eckersley (2004) and Bruce Sutter
(2006) as the only relievers in the Hall.
