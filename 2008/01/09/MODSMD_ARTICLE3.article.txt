# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Administration responds to CoHo petition 
### LEAH KARLINS 
With the fate of the empty CoHo
space still in limbo, more than 830 stu
dents, alumni and staff members have
signed an electronic petition that sup
ports reopening the CoHo in its original
Tresidder Union location.
The signers' comments make it clear
that for many members of the Stanford
community, the CoHo was much more
than just a coffee house.
"The CoHo was, simply put, a sanctu

ary," Suzan Ahmed '09 wrote in a com
ment on the petition. "Unlike any li
brary, here was a place where students,
professors. TAs, everyone, could study,
chat, listen to music and eat the most de
licious crepes ever."
While several signers voiced appreci
ation for the wide-ranging menu at the
new Old Union eatery, the Axe & Palm,
many bemoaned the loss of a unique
space for the performing arts.
"This was a beautiful place for artists
— we deserve this venue, and the Stan

ford community needs it," wrote Rose
lyn Hallett '08.
Director of Student Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws said that now is the time for
students to express their concerns and
describe what kinds of services they
would like to see in Tresidder.
"We don't want to leave that space
vacant," she said. "Now is the time to
speak up. 1 really encourage people to
email me or come talk to me."
The feedback she receives from
emails and meetings, as well as from the

petition, will in
form decisions
about what to do

with the CoHo
space and how the
two unions will
evolve, Smith-Laws

said.
"As we move for-

ward, we want to make

sure we're not guessing


NARUHIKO CHEE/
The Stanford Daily
what students want," she said. "We
want to get that feedback as quickly
as possible."
Hie petition to re-open the CoHo
was created by Megan Miller'o6, the
arts and student life coordinator for
the Stanford Institute for Creativity
and the Arts (SICA). As a student,
Miller often played with her jazz
combo on the CoHo's stage in addi
tion to actively organizing student
performances and raising the money
to purchase the Col lo's piano.
"When the CoHo closed, it was
kind of a disaster for the arts," said
Miller, whose current position at
SICA involves supporting Stan
ford's numerous arts groups.

"There were just so many differ
ent kinds of things that had a home

at the CoHo: Open Mic nights. Spo
ken Word, live performances," she
said. "There really isn't another
venue that's suitable for that on
campus."
The acoustics of the Axe & Palm
make it unfit for live musical per
formances, according to Evan
Brooks, board president of the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop, which had
sponsored regular performances at
the CoHo since 1972. He explained
that the new eatery's design causes
live music to sound, "boomy, loud,
unintelligible and fatiguing to listen
to," and he compared it to the
acoustics of a high school locker
room.
Miller noted that the Axe & Palm
also lacks a stage or performance
lighting.
The response to Miller's petition
was immediate, and hundreds of sig
natures were gathered in the first
few days.
"It's obvious that the students re

ally care," Miller said.
Many of the comments on the pe
tition mourned the loss of the
CoHo's unique ambiance.
"The CoHo had a special feeling
about it. It had character," wrote
Zachary Gianos "07.
Kendra Allenby "10 wrote that
she missed the CoHo's "dark,
grungy feel," while Lindsey Smith
'10 described its "warm, cozy, re
laxed environment.
"1 don't know any students who
are happy that the CoHo is closed,"
Smith wrote. "There is nothing, ab
solutely nothing like the CoHo any
where else on campus."
Many alumni and staff members
have signed the petition as well, in
cluding Marisa Juarez '05, adminis
trative associate for African and
African American Studies.
"The CoHo's absence has left a
void on this campus that has yet to
be filled," she wrote.
Miller believes that the Axe &

Palm and the CoHo could exist side
by side. She thinks that the Axe &
Palm is "addressing a different set of
needs" than the CoHo used to, with
features that the Col lo lacked includ
ing a jukebox and plasma screen TVs.
"They created a different kind of
venue and then got rid of the alter
native," she said. "The Axe & Palm is
perfect for Trivia Night and I lip Hop
Sushi, but it's not perfect by any
means for live performance."
In response to the possibility of
the Col lo space being used for re
tail, Miller pointed out that the
space is already set up as a perform
ance and coffee house venue.
"If you let that venue slip away,
you're not going to get a new one,"
she said.
