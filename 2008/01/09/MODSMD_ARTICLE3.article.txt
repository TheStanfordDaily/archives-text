# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Administration responds to CoHo petition 
### LEAH KARLINS 
With the fate of the empty CoHo
space still in limbo, more than 830 stu
dents, alumni and staff members have
signed an electronic petition that sup
ports reopening the CoHo in its original
Tresidder Union location.
The signers' comments make it clear
that for many members of the Stanford
community, the CoHo was much more
than just a coffee house.
"The CoHo was, simply put, a sanctu

ary," Suzan Ahmed '09 wrote in a com
ment on the petition. "Unlike any li
brary, here was a place where students,
professors. TAs, everyone, could study,
chat, listen to music and eat the most de
licious crepes ever."
While several signers voiced appreci
ation for the wide-ranging menu at the
new Old Union eatery, the Axe & Palm,
many bemoaned the loss of a unique
space for the performing arts.
"This was a beautiful place for artists
â€” we deserve this venue, and the Stan

ford community needs it," wrote Rose
lyn Hallett '08.
Director of Student Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws said that now is the time for
students to express their concerns and
describe what kinds of services they
would like to see in Tresidder.
"We don't want to leave that space
vacant," she said. "Now is the time to
speak up. 1 really encourage people to
email me or come talk to me."
The feedback she receives from
emails and meetings, as well as from the

petition, will in
form decisions
about what to do

with the CoHo
space and how the
two unions will
evolve, Smith-Laws

said.
"As we move for-

ward, we want to make

sure we're not guessing
