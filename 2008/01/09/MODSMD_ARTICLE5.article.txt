## Textbooks for rent online Students unconvinced of monetary benefit 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Winter quarter starts this week,
which means rain-soaked hike seats,
new courses and sticker shock as stu
dents line up to buy the quarter's ex
pensive textbooks.
Thrifty students now have a new
way to get those textbooks: They can
opt to rent books instead of buying
them.
The Web site Chegg.com was
launched this summer as a Netflix
like textbook-rental company. Stu
dents pay some fraction of the cost of
a new textbook and can keep the
book until the end of the term. A sim
ilar service is offered by
Bookrenter.com.
Stanford students taking the Biol
ogy or Human Biology cores will
need the eighth edition of "Life: the
Science of Biology." A new copy costs
$159.75 from the Stanford Bookstore
or $98.57 from Amazon.com. Rent
ing the book from Chegg will set a
student back $52 for the quarter.
Aayush Phumbrha, co-founder
and vice-president of Chegg. said the
Web site has really taken off.
"We had six times the numbers we
were expecting," Phumbrha said.
"This semester, the only time 1
stepped out and had some fun was on
New Year's Eve because I was spend
ing every day processing orders."
Mariel Bailey '08 said she usually
buys her textbooks used from Ama
zon.com marketplace, but she would
consider renting her textbooks be
cause she rarely hangs on to them
after her classes are over.
"I keep my books until the end of
the year and then I sell them back to
the Bookstore," she explained, ex
pressing frustration with the small
amount of money that she sometimes
gets back.
"One time they offered me 50
cents for a book," she said.
Jessie Gardner 'OS also expressed
frustration with the bookstore's buy
back policy.
"They usually only buy one fifth
of the books I have and they give me
at most 20 percent of what I paid for
them." she said.
Gardner said she usually keeps
only one or two textbooks each year

and sells the rest back to the Stanford
Bookstore. But she said she would
not want to rent her books online be
cause she does not like waiting for
needed texts to arrive in the mail.
Even if she were willing to get books
online, she said re-selling the books
would save her more money than
renting them.
"I could buy a used book online
and then re-sell it online for almost
the same price," she said.
Christine Feigal '08 was also hesi
tant to rent her books online.
"You have more liberty when you
own a book." she said,explaining that
she likes to take notes in her text
books.
Chegg allows limited highlighting
in its textbooks but does not allow

writing.
Like Gardner, Feigal said she
could save more money by re-selling
her textbooks rather than renting
them. She said she has resold text
books for $5 less than what she paid
for them.
"I sell them to freshmen," she ex
plained.
Though different purchasing
methods exist, it is evident that most
students are looking for a way to save
money on textbooks. Phumbrha
hopes the online textbook rental
business can help.
"We should give students what
they want," he said.
