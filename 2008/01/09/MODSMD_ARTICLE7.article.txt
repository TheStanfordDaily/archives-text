## Graduate Life Where you hang your hat 
### 
1 don't have a hat. I don't even really like
hats. They look stupid. But, if I were a
hat wearer, I 'd have to move my collec
tion of headpieces from the grim, grey
beauty of England's green and pleasant
land in order to hang them in California.
The realization that you're more com
fortable away from your family and your
friends is a disquieting one. It makes you
feel... ungrounded.
As I write this. I'm sitting on a plane jud
dering in the turbulence as 1 fly back from
break. I 've been in London for the last three
weeks on my annual pilgrimage. The yearly
trip is usually something to look forward to;
this time, though, from the day I landed, all I
wanted to do was come home. I lome to San
Francisco.
I found myself increasingly lost in Lon
don. Stuff is different. Not just from Califor
nia, but from the way I remember. Every
one's gone and grown up. Iliey're buying
houses, settling down, getting married and
building the Rest ofTheir Lives.
For several years after moving across the
pond, life suddenly seemed emptier. I had
no idea where to go. not enough people to
hang out with, no life to which I belonged.
It's a horrible feeling and the worst thing
about starting graduate school â€” it's mov
ing to college, far away from everything you
know, but without the institutions that
make university life worth living.
Getting past that transplantedness has
been the highlight of the latter part of grad
school. It's been great to recapture that
sense of belonging. Unfortunately, it turns
out finding a new home demands a price:
you lose your old one.
Seeing friends back in the UK was a lot of
fun. We drank, reminisced about times gone
by and caught up. But ... there are barriers
between us that didn't exist before.
1 suspect that part of that lost connection
is an inevitable consequence of age. Grow
ing up and growing apart often come togeth
er. Still, though. I can't help feeling that 60(H)
miles doesn't help.
The worst thing is that it doesn't end
here. I'll be gone from Stanford in a few
months. And since my plans to move across
the bay have been thwarted by a lack of tal
ent (on my part). I've got to say goodbye to
California life. And. I think I may have to re
sign myself to losing a whole new set of
friendships.
