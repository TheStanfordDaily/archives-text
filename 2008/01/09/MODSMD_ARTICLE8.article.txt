### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
According to World Health Or
ganization data, the virus
killed an estimated 2.1 mil
lion people this year. Yet,
despite its lethality, educa
tional programs about diagnosis, trans
mission, and prevention remain limited
in many areas of the world. When it
comes to HIV/AIDS, ignorance is
deadly.
Piya Sorcar, a Ph.D. student in the
school of education, seeks to remedy
this ignorance with an AIDS/HIV cur
riculum designed to transcend cultural
barriers.The curriculum features cartoon
animations that discuss the issue of
HIV/AIDS transmission, infection, and
prevention with virtually no mention of
topics with a sexual nature.
Sorcar's background has played a large
role in motivating her research and develop
ment.
"I was born in Colorado but my family
roots are in West Bengal," said Sorcar. "1
have visited India many times, from child
hood. and my parents always emphasized the
importance of education and using it as a
tool to improve social welfare. As 1 am now
studying technology and education at Stan
ford, 1 am passionate about establishing
India as a model for educational innova
tion."
According to Sorcar, the ignorance sur
rounding HIV/AIDS in her native country
was cultural aversion toward explicitly dis
cussing sexual topics.
"Diseases such as HIV/AIDS that are
transmitted sexually present significant chal
lenges because social stigma often precludes
open discussion, especially in Asian coun
tries," said Sorcar. "In fact, although India
has one of the largest populations of
lIIV/AIDS sufferers, several states have
banned sex education, and with it
HIV/AIDS education."
After receiving funding from Time Warn
er. Sorcar collaborated with a myriad of
Stanford departments as well as the South
Korean Medical Research Information Cen
ter.
"What we often forget is that HIV is a
virus, and we study viruses in biology classes
all the time," she said. "Hence, by bringing
the subject back to the basics — focusing on
biological aspects of the virus — we can dis
cuss it more openly and clearly."
Sorcar specifically decided to use non
threatening. non-sexual cartoon characters
in her educational animations to reduce any
viewer discomfort with openly sexual sub
jects.
"When I originally ran the study in India,

gauged
the com
fort of stu
dents in learn

ing HIV/AIDS
material with various
illustrations," she said

"People were most comfort
able with simple cartoon-like

graphics and actually, the simple graph
ics seem to get the points across just fine. It
was important that individuals learn about
this subject while feeling comfortable."

Whenever it seemed sexuality could not
be avoided, Sorcar watered down openly
sexual topics as much as possible yet still
maintained the meaning behind her mes
sage.
"For instance, when we discuss various
bodily fluids, we show a simple outline of the
human body and used animated boxes to
show where particular fluids come from,"
she said. "In order to connect particular flu
ids to human actions and behaviors, we built
on some ideas from old Bollywood films. For
instance when we are talking about saliva
and kissing, an animated couple comes very
close together and then the camera pans up
a tree and we see two birds kiss instead."
Because sexual education in schools has
been limited, much HIV/AIDS education in
India has been relegated to billboard adver
tisements and 30-second TV spots.
Sorcar said that these two methods of ed
ucation limited HIV/AIDS education to

"For exam
ple, television ads are only delivered to
homes with television sets and electricity,
which lend to be the higher socioeconomic
classes," she said. "Billboard HIV/AIDS
messages are usually expressed in written
text, which limits impact to the 62.5% of the
population that is literate."
Sorcar has tried to extend the reach of her
animated educational program through var
ious platforms.
"We hope to build versions which will
span across many platforms," she said. "Cur
rently, we have versions of the AIDS anima
tion on-line and available on CD-ROMS, for
areas with limited Internet connectivity. Our
next step is to build versions for mobile
phones, which can be disseminated using a
push or pull strategy. We are exploring
whether governments and mobile service
providers would be interested in partnering
with us in order to either make this content
freely available to download or better yet, to
have it be pre-installedon new cell phones or
PDAs."

to introduce her curricu
lum through the Web 2.0.
"We definitely want to

create a Facehook app. perhaps more
than one, and also expand to other social
networks and online distribution channels,"
she said. "In our first large-scale pilot test on
423 young adults in India, we found students
were rapidly seeking and educating others
about HIV/AIDS prevention through their
peer networks, with nearly 90% of them
sharing information they learned from the
tutorial with someone else."
As for other uses for her AIDS/HIV edu
cation curriculum, Sorcar said that she would
expand the educational program so that it
could be used for other diseases as well.
"After developing HIV/AIDS education
modules for multiple countries, we want to
use our research findings to develop preven
tion education on other diseases like malar
ia, tuberculosis etc.," she said. "We are fo
cused on how to best communicate public
health messages while maximizing comfort
and learning. My dissertation work is about
exploring innovative ways to teach about
taboo subjects without talking about them.
HIV/AIDS education in the developing
world is just one example of this."

"For exam
ple, television ads are only delivered to
homes with television sets and electricity,
which lend to be the higher socioeconomic
classes," she said. "Billboard HIV/AIDS
messages are usually expressed in written
text, which limits impact to the 62.5% of the
population that is literate."
Sorcar has tried to extend the reach of her
animated educational program through var
ious platforms.
"We hope to build versions which will
span across many platforms," she said. "Cur
rently, we have versions of the AIDS anima
tion on-line and available on CD-ROMS, for
areas with limited Internet connectivity. Our
next step is to build versions for mobile
phones, which can be disseminated using a
push or pull strategy. We are exploring
whether governments and mobile service
providers would be interested in partnering
with us in order to either make this content
freely available to download or better yet, to
have it be pre-installedon new cell phones or
PDAs."

w Sorcar also aims
to introduce her curricu
lum through the Web 2.0.
"We definitely want to

create a Facehook app. perhaps more
than one, and also expand to other social
networks and online distribution channels,"
she said. "In our first large-scale pilot test on
423 young adults in India, we found students
were rapidly seeking and educating others
about HIV/AIDS prevention through their
peer networks, with nearly 90% of them
sharing information they learned from the
tutorial with someone else."
As for other uses for her AIDS/HIV edu
cation curriculum, Sorcar said that she would
expand the educational program so that it
could be used for other diseases as well.
"After developing HIV/AIDS education
modules for multiple countries, we want to
use our research findings to develop preven
tion education on other diseases like malar
ia, tuberculosis etc.," she said. "We are fo
cused on how to best communicate public
health messages while maximizing comfort
and learning. My dissertation work is about
exploring innovative ways to teach about
taboo subjects without talking about them.
HIV/AIDS education in the developing
world is just one example of this."
