McCain: "we showed the
people of this country what a
real comeback looks like"

NASHUA,N.H.(AP) — John Mc-
Cain rode the Straight Talk Express
straight into first place in New
Hampshire, and hack into the thick
of the race for the Republican pres
idential nomination.
"I hate to use the word kid. hut I
think we showed the people of this
country what a real comeback looks
like." the Arizona senator told ITie
Associated Press in an interview
Tuesday, savoring victory in the
state he won eight years ago during
his first White House bid.
"I'm grateful to the people of
New Hampshire. I'm committed to
keeping this country safe, and we're
going to move on to Michigan and
South Carolina and win the nomina
tion," he added.
It was, indeed, a stunning come
back for the four-term senator who
went from presumed front-runner a
year ago to seemingly finished last
summer after his campaign all but
imploded. McCain not only stayed
alive, but now heads into the next
contest Jan. 15 in Michigan with mo
mentum and the potential to raise
much-need money.
His triumph here sets up a high
stakes rematch with Mitt Romney
in Michigan. McCain won it in 2(MX)
and still has support there; Romney

was reared in the state and is the
son of a former governor. Mike
Huckabec is polling strongly hut is
focusing more on next-up states. No
one else plans to aggressively com
pete in Michigan, where economic
issues will dominate and independ
ents can vote in either party's pri
mary.
From there, McCain is angling
for victory in South Carolina, where
Romney and Huckahee await and
former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thomp
son hopes to stage a rebound of his
own.
McCain, who lost a bitter pri
mary to Bush in 2(KM), lags in polls in
the military-heavy state but hopes
his Vietnam prisoner of war biogra
phy, decades of experience on de
fense issues and staunch support of
the Iraq war will outweigh Republi
cans' deeply held anger about his
position on immigration as well as
their doubts about his loyalty to the
GOP
" Tonight's results will show that
we took a majority of all sections of
the party, and we can do it again,"
McCain told the AP in a telephone
interview from the hotel suite where
he awaited results.
Later. McCain told cheering sup
porters at a victory celebration,
"However this campaign turns out -
and I am more confident tonight
that it will turn out much better than
once expected - I am grateful be
yond expression that I might serve
here a while longer."

Clinton overtakes Obama,
resurrects presidential bid
MANCHESTER. N.H. (AP) —
Hillary Rodham Clinton proved
TUesday that more than one Clinton
can be "the Comeback Kid."
"Over the last week, I listened to
you, and in the process I found my
own voice," Clinton said at a victory
celebration after her win over Barack
Obama. "Now. together, let's give
America the kind of comeback that
New Hampshire has just given me."
Clinton, whose husband used a
second-place finish in New Hamp
shire in 1992 to propel himself to the
White House, had trailed Obama in
recent polling. In the last days,
though, she overhauled her campaign
operation here and took a new tone
to the trail. Aides, meanwhile, execut
ed the long-laid ground game that
even rivals acknowledged was mas
terful.
The New York senator and former
first lady hugged both former Presi
dent Clinton and their daughter.
Chelsea, before taking the podium
and saying, "thank you. thank you so
much" repeatedly. "1 come tonight
with a very, very full heart and I want
especially to thank New Hampshire."
she said. "For all the ups and down of
this campaign, you helped remind
everyone that politics isn't a
game...We came back tonight because
you spoke loudly and clearly."
"Tomorrow, we're going to get up, roll
up our sleeves and keep going," Clin
ton said to enthusiastic applause.
When asked TUesday morning
what she planned to tell supporters
TUesday night. Clinton only offered a

cautious "We'll see."
As her optimistic smile made its
way to polling places and businesses,
record turnout hinted she faced a
more difficult than predicted chal
lenge from Obama. Her husband, the
former president, starting spinning a
loss here and blaming the calendar for
not giving the campaign time to adjust
after lowa.
"The only thing I hate is New
Hampshire should have had the cus
tomary' lOdays after lowa. If they had,
I wouldn't have any doubt about the

outcome of this. It's just hard to over
come the media deluge," Bill Clinton
said in Seabrook, returning to his fre
quent criticism of how reporters have
covered his wife compared to Obama.
"It's just almost impossible to
vote five days after lowa without
being unduly influenced by the
media coverage from lowa. So, you
know, that colored the polls - the
switch in the polls for two days -
and then we've had a three-day
election." Even without the time.it
was enough.

Bush calls confrontation in
Persian Gulf a "provocative
act" by Iran
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush said Iliesday that Iran's
confrontation with the U.S. Navy
ships in the Persian Gulf was a
"provocative act."
"It is a dangerous situation," he
said in a White House news confer
ence. "They should not have done it,
pure and simple...l don't know what
their thinking was. hut I'm telling
you what my thinking was. I think it
was a provocative act."
The top U.S. Navy commander
in the area said an Iranian fleet of
high-speed boats charged at and
threatened to blow up a three-ship
U.S. Navy convoy passing near but
outside Iranian waters on Monday,
as they headed into the Persian
Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.
Hie Iranian fleet "maneuvered
aggressively" and then vanished as
the American ship commanders
were preparing to open fire, said
Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff.
White House press secretary
Dana Perino said the incident was
hardly routine. "It was not normal
behavior," she said. "It was out of
the ordinary. It was reckless."
"It's just another point of refer
ence for people in the region who
are concerned about the behavior of
Iran," Perino said of the skirmish
early Sunday local time. But, she
said that while Iran will be "part of
the discussion" during Bush's trav
els, "it's certainly not the main rea
son for the trip."

Bush calls confrontation in
Persian Gulf a "provocative
act" by Iran
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush said Iliesday that Iran's
confrontation with the U.S. Navy
ships in the Persian Gulf was a
"provocative act."
"It is a dangerous situation," he
said in a White House news confer
ence. "They should not have done it,
pure and simple...l don't know what
their thinking was. hut I'm telling
you what my thinking was. I think it
was a provocative act."
The top U.S. Navy commander
in the area said an Iranian fleet of
high-speed boats charged at and
threatened to blow up a three-ship
U.S. Navy convoy passing near but
outside Iranian waters on Monday,
as they headed into the Persian
Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.
Hie Iranian fleet "maneuvered
aggressively" and then vanished as
the American ship commanders
were preparing to open fire, said
Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff.
White House press secretary
Dana Perino said the incident was
hardly routine. "It was not normal
behavior," she said. "It was out of
the ordinary. It was reckless."
"It's just another point of refer
ence for people in the region who
are concerned about the behavior of
Iran," Perino said of the skirmish
early Sunday local time. But, she
said that while Iran will be "part of
the discussion" during Bush's trav
els, "it's certainly not the main rea
son for the trip."

McCain: "we showed the
people of this country what a
real comeback looks like"

NASHUA,N.H.(AP) — John Mc-
Cain rode the Straight Talk Express
straight into first place in New
Hampshire, and hack into the thick
of the race for the Republican pres
idential nomination.
"I hate to use the word kid. hut I
think we showed the people of this
country what a real comeback looks
like." the Arizona senator told ITie
Associated Press in an interview
Tuesday, savoring victory in the
state he won eight years ago during
his first White House bid.
"I'm grateful to the people of
New Hampshire. I'm committed to
keeping this country safe, and we're
going to move on to Michigan and
South Carolina and win the nomina
tion," he added.
It was, indeed, a stunning come
back for the four-term senator who
went from presumed front-runner a
year ago to seemingly finished last
summer after his campaign all but
imploded. McCain not only stayed
alive, but now heads into the next
contest Jan. 15 in Michigan with mo
mentum and the potential to raise
much-need money.
His triumph here sets up a high
stakes rematch with Mitt Romney
in Michigan. McCain won it in 2(MX)
and still has support there; Romney

was reared in the state and is the
son of a former governor. Mike
Huckabec is polling strongly hut is
focusing more on next-up states. No
one else plans to aggressively com
pete in Michigan, where economic
issues will dominate and independ
ents can vote in either party's pri
mary.
From there, McCain is angling
for victory in South Carolina, where
Romney and Huckahee await and
former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thomp
son hopes to stage a rebound of his
own.
McCain, who lost a bitter pri
mary to Bush in 2(KM), lags in polls in
the military-heavy state but hopes
his Vietnam prisoner of war biogra
phy, decades of experience on de
fense issues and staunch support of
the Iraq war will outweigh Republi
cans' deeply held anger about his
position on immigration as well as
their doubts about his loyalty to the
GOP
" Tonight's results will show that
we took a majority of all sections of
the party, and we can do it again,"
McCain told the AP in a telephone
interview from the hotel suite where
he awaited results.
Later. McCain told cheering sup
porters at a victory celebration,
"However this campaign turns out -
and I am more confident tonight
that it will turn out much better than
once expected - I am grateful be
yond expression that I might serve
here a while longer."

Clinton overtakes Obama,
resurrects presidential bid
MANCHESTER. N.H. (AP) —
Hillary Rodham Clinton proved
TUesday that more than one Clinton
can be "the Comeback Kid."
"Over the last week, I listened to
you, and in the process I found my
own voice," Clinton said at a victory
celebration after her win over Barack
Obama. "Now. together, let's give
America the kind of comeback that
New Hampshire has just given me."
Clinton, whose husband used a
second-place finish in New Hamp
shire in 1992 to propel himself to the
White House, had trailed Obama in
recent polling. In the last days,
though, she overhauled her campaign
operation here and took a new tone
to the trail. Aides, meanwhile, execut
ed the long-laid ground game that
even rivals acknowledged was mas
terful.
The New York senator and former
first lady hugged both former Presi
dent Clinton and their daughter.
