## Stanford chess group takes 11th place 
### BEN STOLL 
Five members of Stanford's chess
team dueled kings at the Pan Ameri
can Intercollegiate Chess Champi
onship over winter break, taking 11th
place in a field of more than 30 teams.
Although the 11 th place finish does
not qualify for a cash prize under the
Championship's rules, Stanford team
members said they were happy to have
fared better than many of their peers
at the Miami Dade College tourna
ment.

"It's great to be in the top third,"
Stanford Chess Club President Chris
Seek said in an email to The Daily,
highlighting the super-competitive na
ture of intercollegiate chess events.
According to Seek, the team was
competitive with the University of
Texas at Dallas, which sent two teams
of five, including several international
masters and grandmasters.
But the Stanford chess club is not
only for those ready to go head-to
head with masters and grandmasters.
Meetings are open to local enthusiasts

as well as Stanford students.
According to Seek, Stanford has
something up its sleeve to counter
even the wiliest of Texas's grandmas
ters: an experienced Romanian coach
who gives free lessons to the club.
Chess club enthusiasts gather out
side Jamba Juice in TYesidder Union
for several hours on Sunday after
noons to practice checkmating each
other.
