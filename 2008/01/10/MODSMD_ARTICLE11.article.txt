## GSC turns down Provost's GO Pass solution 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members unanimously rejected the
Provost's new proposal for funding the
Caltrain GO Pass in 2008 at their first
meeting of winter quarter last night.
The GO Pass program subsidizes
train passes for graduate students who

live off campus, providing them with
unlimited use of the Caltrain. The Of
fice of the Provost agreed to fund the
GO Pass for the 2007 calendar year pro
vided that the Graduate Student Trans
portation Board propose a special fees
measure for last spring's ballot. Since
the bill did not pass, no funding has
been approved by the Provost's Office
for 2008 and beyond.

According to Psychology graduate
student Jessica Cameron, one of the
three leaders of the GO Pass action
committee. Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82 said he would be willing to
impose a mandatory annual $45 fee
on both on-campus and off-campus
graduate students provided that the
GSC approve such a charge.
With this newly proposed meas
ure. graduate students who live on
campus would be paying for a serv
ice they could not use. Cameron
said. Graduate students who live
off-campus would be the only ben
eficiaries of the GO Pass program.

According to the Graduate Student
Transportation Board, as of August
2007, there were approximately 500
regular graduate commuters living
off-campus.
Cameron added that the GO
Pass program is the responsibility
of the University and students who
live off-campus.
Many members of the GSC ex
pressed concern for the future of
the GO Pass program, but avowed
that they would not support the
new initiative proposed by

Etchemendy.
"The GO Pass program has been
denied twice in the referendum and
1 don't think we should impose [a
mandatory fee] on 8.000 graduate
students," said Rhyan Uy, a second
year business school student and
member of the GSC. "We would be
subsidizing around $600 per [off
campus] student and that is simply
too much."
By general consensus, the mem
bers of the GSC agreed that they
did not have the moral authority to

approve the proposed measure and
stated that they will officially deny
a request.
"Fifteen council members do
not have the moral authority of
passing a mandatory fee to all grad
uate students (who will not benefit
from the GO Pass] without even
asking them first," said doctoral
student and GSC member Alex
Ene.
