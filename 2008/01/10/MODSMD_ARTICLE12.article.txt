## Editorial Board Feel Good, Inc.

It's as if we feel apologetic. From day one,
Stanford students know the score. Drive
down Palm Drive, approach the Oval,
stroll beneath the Romanesque sandstone
arches, ogle fellow students' luxury automo
biles on Escondido Road. And how could we
not? Elite higher education is enjoyed by the
cream of society; Stanford is the head on the
foam.
When the student body's physical sur
roundings form this infamous "bubble" and
the intellectual environment turns intensely
recondite — combined with the fact that
some Stanford students come from remark
ably well-off but sheltered backgrounds —
there is danger of ignorance about the real
world, and worse yet. the nauseating apathy
of the privileged.
And so we volunteer.
The onus to volunteer is justifiably
heavy, not only at Stanford but across all in
stitutions of higher education. School ad
ministrations nudge students toward com
munity service. Employers look kindly
upon well-rounded resumes. Teach for
America advertises that its graduates often
land jobs with lucrative firms like McKin
sey and Goldman Sachs. Public service is
universally recognized by high school appli
cants as a "must." A 2003 satire in I"he
Onion (http://www.theonion.com/con
tent/node/38616) described an insufferable
resume-padder apparently trying to get
into Stanford.
The volunteering, perhaps thankfully,
doesn't end upon matriculation, as East Palo
Alto remains one of the most popular ex
tracurricular destinations for students. 'ITie
mantra is familiar: We are enjoying the ben
efits of extraordinary privilege, and it is only
right that we give back. We are uniquely
poised, due to the gift of our talents, and we
should give back to our community. There
are poor, underprivileged people, and we
should give back and help lift them out of
their condition. We are told that we are. after
all, at Stanford, where future leaders and
world changers are groomed, and we need to
dream big things and change big things. Why
not start today with a bit of public service?
Feels good too, doesn't it?
Yet when the reality is examined, our
hubris suddenly seems just as overbearing as

our idealism seems lofty. The truth —as
some organizations in East Palo Alto would
readily admit — is that for all their enthusi
asm and good intentions, Stanford students
often leave very little positive, or sometimes
even a negative, impact. In some cases, stu
dents spend two hours a week with some
children, but leave the program just as real
bonds are formed. As for overseas endeav
ors, isn't it conceivable that a middle-aged
Tanzanian woman, who has lived through
uncountable hardships, might feel a slight
tinge of irony as she watches a fresh-faced, 20
year-old upper-middle class suburban
American student teach her how to better
her life?
As one sees photos of Americans sur
rounded by undernourished but giddy chil
dren.one might think."lf you had just donat
ed the $I.(XX) you spent on your airplane
ticket here, we'd all be much better off for
the next five years." The cynic could suggest
that real capital, in this instance, is worth
much more than enthusiastic labor.
Then why do the organizations continue
taking students? Political Science Prof. Rob
Reich, who teaches the popular course
"Ethics and Politics of Public Service." says
that organizations such as those in East Palo
Alto hope to educate Stanford students
about the less fortunate through a good dose
of exposure, not actually elicit our contribu
tions.The service is, in reality,going in the op
posite direction of what we students would
like to admit.
The Associated Press reported in 2006
that a remarkable 30 percent of American
college students are volunteering, and the
current attitude among America's middle
upper class is commendable. While misguid
ed volunteering is better than no public serv
ice at all. the worry remains that when stu
dents are lulled to believe that a brief service
stint represents genuine work and change,
the original purpose of the education is de
feated and the service is rendered altogether
worthless. The only plus of doing service, in
that case, would be to that qualm that dis
tinctly fuzzy guilt about driving one's BMW
down Escondido Road. And if Stanford stu
dents are to truly realize the change we envi
sion, that would be a moral trap we would do
well to avoid.
