## Ron Paul, Zombie Lord: Quest for the American brain, literally 
### 
Excitement is in the air for the 2008
presidential election. What a lineup of
candidates: Hillary has experience,
Obama promises change, McCain is unwa
vering and Ron Paul is a zombie. Yes, a brain
eating. undead. Thriller-music-video kind of
zombie. I low did a zombie get into politics?
It's a rather fascinating story.
The first thing to know about zombies is
that their top priority is eating brains. Not
just any kind of brains — they have rather
delicate palates.The second thing to know, is
that they can think, plan and generally look
like humans.
It's not exactly certain when Ron Paul
turned into a zombie. However, his zombie
like tendencies became most apparent dur
ing his training in medical school. Ron's most
promising medical career was — you
guessed it — brain surgery. Never before
had a medical student shown such devotion
and skill in handling the brain. But Ron
knew it would be suspicious and off-putting
if he was always found munching on the rem
nants of his surgeries. He knew the I DA
would also disapprove of his unique, albeit
unsanitary, method of physically biting out
brain tumors from afflicted patients.
These brains, however, were unappetiz
ing to Ron Paul. The most important factor
in determining the taste of a brain is the
proper care of the fetus, from inception to
pregnancy to birth. So Ron Paul instead de
cided to become an 08/GYN, helping to de
liver thousands of healthy babies into this
world. And when these children matured
into adults, they would then have exquisitely
tasty brains for consumption Ron Paul took
the premium brain category to a whole new
level — the Kobe beef of brains, if you will.
But Ron wanted to influence the taste
and supply of brains on a wider scale, a na
tional scale. Thus his entry into politics, as a
U.S. Congressman. The most powerful influ
ence over a tasty brain, however, lies in the
presidency of the United States.
And so he here stands, in full zombie glory,
as a candidate in the 2008 presidential race.

Ron's proposed policies scream brain
centered zombie politics. "Gun control?
Control this!" says Ron. flourishing a crude
gesture. "More guns, more deaths, more
brains!" is his slogan of choice. Ron is pro-life
all the way: why take so many potentially suc
culent brains out of the supply chain? In fact,
Ron is so pro-life and pro-gun. he figured out
a way to combine the two, in a twisted, zom
bie way. Remember those sex education
classes back in high school where you were
sometimes handed a condom? Well. Ron en
visions a world where sex education teaches
kids how to have more sex. guns replace con
doms, and the ensuing mayhem of accidental
births and un-accidental homicides would re
sult in a whole lotta of fresh brain.
Don't forget that zombies have refined
tastes. It's not only about the quantity, but
the quality of the brains. And its bona-fide,
American citizen brain that set the standard
of quality for Ron Paul. This informs his pol
icy on immigrants: he doesn't want any. The
taste of their brains simply doesn't make the
cut. Education is also a no-no, since making
people smarter introduces more folds in
their brains, ruining the silky-smooth texture
that zombies so longingly desire.
As voters, it's important to stay informed,
and that means knowing which one of your
presidential candidates is a zombie. Now I'm
not trying to influence your vote — if you
want a zombie in office, more power to you.
At least you can elect someone who appreci
ates you not for your looks, but what's on the
inside — your brain, that is.
