## The 						triathlon primary 
### 
You've heard it a gazillion times: "The
primary calendar this year is terrible."
A lot of what a media personality does
is use the "authoritative analysis voice" to re
peat the entirely obvious. Right now every
body is talking about how horrible the com
pressed 2008 primary calendar is. "Well,
TUcker, given this year's primary calendar,
which is totally out of control, it's possible
that..." as though it's as obvious as "Well
Hicker, the sky. which is blue today..." But de
spite the widespread consensus that this is
obvious, nobody actually bothers to make an
argument about what's bad about it.
Yes. the 2008 primary calendar is indeed
different than in the past. In 2004, lowa and
New 1 lampshire fell at the middle and end of
January, respectively. Feb. 2 saw seven very
small states, with 13 Democratic and six Re
publican contests following throughout the
rest of the month. Only on March 2 and 9 did
big states like California, New York. Texas,
and Florida start committing delegates. In
20(H). the calendar was much the same for the
Republicans; the Democrats' contest was
only slightly more drawn out. Hi is year a
month was effectively cut out of the standard
calendar, with many former start-of-March
states moving their primaries to the begin
ning of February.
Strategically, this means two different
things. One, candidates had more time to de
velop different messages. In 2000 when Mc-
Cain beat Bush's"! am a compassionate con
servative" in New Hampshire. Bush had 18
days to retool his message and find a winning
formula, carrying South Carolina with "John
McCain has an out-of-wedlock black child."
If we don't see that kind of political message

under the new, compressed calendar it does
n't seem like a huge loss to our political sys
tem. But there are legitimate fears. For exam
ple. some are worried that there is an undis
covered fact or message that will absolutely
destroy Republican candidate Mike Uuck
abee. Because the compressed calendar has
allowed him to go from unknown to front
runner so quickly, the GOP may not find out
until it's too late.
The second worry is that a compressed
calendar promotes fundraising and media
buys over retail politics. You can win in lowa
anil New Hampshire with a lot of legwork
even if you're outspent 10 to one. But in a
place like California, New York. Florida, or
Texas, it's just not possible to cover enough
ground to meet a significant fraction of the
voters. In the big states, you communicate
with junk mail, media coverage, and TV and
radio ads. Pundits have worried that this kind
of "national primary" will make it harder for
up-and-comer. dark-horse candidates to
compete — unknowns like Jimmy Carter or
Bill Clinton who won upsets and gradually
turned the momentum of the race over the
course of a lot of hard-fought ground cam
paigns.
On the other hand, retail politics isn't nec
essarily all we want in a candidate. Mitt Rom

ney and Rudy Giuliani, for example, are im
pressive campaigners who nevertheless seem
to alienate every voter they actually meet.
Perhaps they will fare better in big states
where raising money to get on television is a
more important skill than shaking hands at
pancake breakfasts — and who is to say
which process is more relevant in picking a
president?
The pundits seem to be nostalgic for the
"marathon primary" — an endurance con
test with a premium on accumulating a small
advantage in every stage and building mo
mentum to go into the national contest an as
sured winner.
In contrast, 2008 is a "triathlon primary"
— the retail politics running race isn't the de
ciding contest, so candidates can also com
pete on TV, through fund-raising, building
endorsements, and competing for coverage.
Retail-politics states like lowa are still rele
vant. but no longer decisive, and big-media
buy states like California are now relevant —
not instead, hut as well.
So far, the "triathlon primary" seems to be
doing pretty well. It's giving dark-horse can
didates like McCain and Huckabee a chance
to come from behind and upset the establish
ment figures, but it is also giving Giuliani a
chance to blow the dark-horses out of the
water in the later contests with a bigger budg
et and better name recognition, even though
he sat out the early races.
Despite the consensus of 99 percent of the
chattering class, the 2008 primary process
doesn't seem terrible at all.
