Unless you're a Canuck, chances are the sport of
hockey is fairly underappreciated in your home
town. Even in many northern U.S. cities — like
Chicago and Boston — hockey's popularity lags way
behind that of other sports. So it shouldn't be too sur
prising that here at Stanford, it's difficult for the club
ice hockey team to capture a lot of attention.
Until you read that last sentence, you may not
have even been aware that Stanford had a club hock
ey team. Hockey can be a very fast-paced, exciting
sport to watch, and Stanford's club team definitely

plays an exciting brand: in their 13 games so far this
season, an average of over 12 goals have been scored
per game. And while their record currently stands at
4-9. sophomore right wing Jonathan Rich believed
that the team is doing well, considering the small
pool of players they have at their disposal.
Rich argued that since Stanford's enrollment is so
much smaller than other schools in the Pac-8 (basi
cally the Pac-10 without Oregon State and Arizona),
it is very difficult for the team to challenge for the
conference title. Another problem the Cardinal faces
is a lack of exposure on campus.
"A lot of freshmen [who have played hockey be
fore] will come in and not know about the team until

halfway through the season," Rich said.
Which is why the team is now making a push to
gain more exposure around campus. They realize
that being one of the best club teams in the confer
ence is a long-term goal, one which will start with get
ting people's attention on campus.
" ITie hope is to build a stronger program that's
more consistent, so that we're never really worrying
about having enough players for the season," Rich
said.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to keep growing as a club

"Hopefully, we'll be able to
keep growing as a club and
get more recognition [...]"

Sophomore goaltender Otis Chodosh and the Cardinal know it
will be a long road to the top of the Pac-8. But with two games
remaining against archrival Cal, including one at home, the
Cardinal is optimistic that there is still time to raise its on-campus
profile this season.
