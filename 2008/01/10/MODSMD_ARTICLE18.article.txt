### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 5 Stanford women's gymnastics
team will have a chance to gauge its merit right
off the bat — the Cardinal opens up its season
this Sunday when they play host to the three
time defending national champions, the No. 1
Georgia Bulldogs.
"1 am so excited for this season," head coach
Kristen Smyth told GoStanford.com. "There
are many reasons to he optimistic about this
team. We have outstanding leadership, with six
seniors who know what it takes to be successful
at the college level leading the way. We have
valuable experience from last season to build on
with six All Americans returning to a team that
is hungry to get back to the Super Six."
The Cardinal should provide a formidable
challenge for the top-ranked Bulldogs. Stanford
finished last year in third place at the NCAA
Championships, is returning every member of
last year's squad and welcoming three new
freshmen: Shelley Alexander. Danielle Ikoma
and Gretchen O'Henley.The Cardinal is led by
senior Tabitha Yim — who was an NCAA
Champion at the 2007 South Central Regional
— three-time Ail-American junior Nicole
Ourada and sophomore Carly Janiga.
On the bars, the Cardinal will be spearhead
ed by senior Liz Tricase, junior Kelly Fee and
seniors Lauren Elmore and Alex Pintchouk.
Stanford will need top performances from
each and everyone of the team's members to
best the Bulldogs on Sunday. Winners of the last
three national titles, Georgia features junior
Courtney Kupets, senior Katie Heenan, sopho
mores Grace Taylor and Courtney McCool.and
freshman Cassidy McComb.
Aside from Sunday's opening match-up with
Georgia, Stanford is slated to face a tough
schedule: over the course of the year, they will
compete against the nation's best, including
schools like UCLA. Alabama, Nebraska and
lowa State.
"It is a pleasure to host perennial power
house programs like Georgia, Alabama and Ne
braska," Smyth later said to GoStanford.com.
"We will be challenged against these great
teams, early and often and they will be good
measuring sticks for us throughout the year. We
know the competition will be tough, but we are
looking forward to meeting them and hosting
high-level gymnastics in the Bay Area."
Sunday's competition against Georgia is set
for a 2 p.m. start at Burnham Pavilion.
