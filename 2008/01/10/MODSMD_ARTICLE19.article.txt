## USC's Carroll could be a fit for Falcons' coaching vacancy 
### CHARLES ODUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The Atlanta Falcons are inter
ested in Southern California coach
Pete Carroll for their head coach
ing job.
A person familiar with the
team's coaching situation told The
Associated Press on Wednesday
that the Falcons want to speak with
Carroll, who is on vacation in
Hawaii. The person spoke on con
dition of anonymity because the
Falcons have not officially met
with Carroll.
Carroll spoke with USC sports
information director Tim Tessa
lone on Wednesday and told Tessa
lone there are no developments
worthy of comment.
"He reiterated that to me this
morning on the phone," Tessalone

said.
Last week. Carroll told re
porters his name would be men
tioned in speculation for NFL jobs.
Carroll said then he wouldn't fuel
speculation by making comments.
"There's nothing going on, no
reason to even talk about it," Car
roll said last week.
Carroll did not return a mes
sage left on his cell phone Wednes
day.
Falcons owner Arthur Blank is
looking for a coach for the second
straight year. After firing Jim Mora
a year ago. he hired Louisville
coach Bobby Petrino. But Petrino
lasted just 13 games before quitting
to become the coach at Arkansas.
The Falcons finished 4-12, in
cluding a 1-2 mark with interim
coach Emmitt Thomas, in a season
overshadowed by quarterback

Michael Vick's indictment, guilty
plea and sentencing to 23 months
in federal prison for his role in an
interstate dogfighting conspiracy.
Atlanta, also currently looking
for a general manager, might be
willing to offer Carroll control of
player personnel decisions. That
could be enough enticement for
Carroll to talk with Blank or other
team officials.
Former general manager Rich
McKay was offered a two-year ex
tension to remain as president
through 2010.
Philadelphia general manager
Tom Heckert interviewed with
team officials Monday.
The Falcons have interviewed
at least three coaching candidates:
Dallas offensive coordinator Jason
Garrett and two assistant head
coaches, Jim Caldwell of Indi

anapolis and Tony Sparano of the
Cowboys.
The Falcons plan to interview
Jaguars defensive coordinator
Mike Smith and Tennessee defen
sive coordinator Jim Schwartz.
Carroll has experience in the
NFL as a head coach and as an as
sistant in addition to his tremen
dous success at USC.
Carroll, 56, was 6-10 in as coach
of the New York Jets in 1994. He
was 28-23 with a division title and
two playoff appearances as coach
of the New England Patriots from
1997-99.
He is 76-14 with two national
championships in seven seasons at
USC following an 11-2 record and
No. 3 ranking this season. The Tro
jans capped their season with a 49-
17 rout of Illinois in the Rose
Bowl.
