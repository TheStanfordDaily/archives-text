# CARD HITS THE ROAD
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 6 p.m. tonight, Stanford men's
basketball visits, on paper, the least
threatening opponent it will face for
the rest of the season: Oregon State.
Sure. No. 23 Stanford (12-2, 1-1
Pac-10) has struggled offensively of
late, averaging just 59 points over the
last four games, 14 below its season
average. But that's a typical day at
the office for the Beavers (6-7, 0-2
Pac-10), who last topped 65 points
seven games ago, on Dec. 11.
On defense, the match-up is not
even close.The Arizona schools each
topped 70 in a sweep of the Beavers
this past weekend. Meanwhile, four
of Stanford's last six opponents have
failed to score 50.
In terms of momentum. Oregon
State has lost four straight. Its best
win all season came against 5-7 UC-
Davis. Stanford, meanwhile, won its
last outing in a grueling 52-46 deci
sion over Southern California last
Saturday. While the game — and
Stanford's historically low 27 percent
shooting performance — was an
abomination, USC is easily the best
team Stanford has defeated this year.
On the stat sheet, Stanford comes
out way ahead again. While the Car
dinal checks in at No. 35 in the RPI
— the computerized rankings that
factor heavily into NCAA Tourna
ment seedings — the Beavers are
260 th out of the 341 teams in Divi
sion 1. That's the lowest of any BCS
conference school by 34 slots. Losses
to squads like Colorado State, Alas
ka-Fairbanks, Tennessee Tech and
Montana State tend to do that to a
team's resume.
Even so, coach Trent Johnson
reread the paragraph in Coaching
101 where it says to always talk up
your opponent, channeling his inner
Lou Holtz to praise the Beavers in

NOTES: No. 23 Stanford salvaged a split of
its most recent home set a week ago against
its Southern California Pac-10 competition,
falling 76-67 to No. 5 UCLA last Thursday
before winning a truly ugly, 52-46 contest
against USC on Saturday. Luckily for the
Cardinal, it should face a much more
winnable game against Oregon State as
Trent Johnson's squad hopes to regain some
momentum headed into the heart of a diffi
cult conference schedule. The Beavers have
dropped four in a row and the Cardinal has
defeated OSU in 15 of their last 16 meet
ings dating back to 1999.

his Tuesday press conference.
"Any day now,any minute, they're
going to get on a roll," Johnson said.
"Going to Corvallis, we've never had
any success in terms of playing well.
.. .There's some talent on that team
— there's some young talent."
Tossing aside the cliche about
how basketball is decided on the
court, not on paper, Stanford's play

ers are laughably better than Oregon
State's.
Sophomore center Brook Lopez
(16 points, eight rebounds per game)
has a future in the NBA (almost cer
tainly after this season, no less) and is
playing like it, especially on the of
fensive end. Twin seven-foot sopho
more center Robin Lopez could
eventually join his brother on the
NBA stage and is dominant defen
sively (2.4 blocks, six rebounds per
game), though turnovers and foul
trouble have often limited him on the
offensive end (10 points per game).
"When he's playing within the
system, he's playing aggressive and
he's taking things to the basket, he's
going to be fine," Johnson said.
Juniors Anthony Goods (13
points per game) and Lawrence Hill
(nine points, six boards per game)
have had up-and-down seasons, es
pecially Hill, but both are viable
scoring threats. Junior point guard
Mitch Johnson and senior forward
Taj Finger are the team's most im
proved players, and senior forward
Fred Washington remains the team's
best defender.
"It's hard to complain about any
thing when you're 12-2, but seeing
what 1 can do in practice and not
doing it in games is very difficult,"
said Hill, who hopes this weekend
will jump-start him out of a season
long slump. "Creating my shot is
something I can do, but creating a
play that can lead to a good shot or a
pass is something I need to work on.
It's like I haven't Hipped the switch
yet. 1 think it'll be better soon."
For the Beavers, meanwhile, for
ward Marcel Jones (12 points per
game) is perhaps the conference's
most underrated player, Kansas
