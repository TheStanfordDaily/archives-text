## Rice book paints glowing picture 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
A glowing new biography of Condoleezza
Rice paints the former Stanford provost as an in
spirational figure that Christians and conserva
tives should follow by example.
In her fourth year as President George W.
Bush's secretary of state. Rice's legacy is very much
up for debate. "Condi: The Life of a Steel Magno
lia" joins an emerging genre of what might be
called "Condi-Lit." In the last year, top reporters
from the Washington Post, The New York Times
and Newsweek have taken successful whacks at in
depth books on the consequential African-Ameri
can, Republican woman from Alabama.

The 319-page ode to Rice cites no primary
sources. Instead, Brown claims to have read more
than 200,000 pages of "transcripts, interviews, and
original documents."
Brown claims Rice will "quite likely" be a vice
presidential nominee.
"Not only has Condi proven herself as a loyal
member of the Bush team, a skilled diplomats tine
teacher and administrator, a lady of glamour, and a
woman of character and faith, she has the rare and
priceless ability to lead and inspire nations," Brown
concludes. "Of course, she's a black woman too. If
she were elected, it would be a triumph of the prin
ciples on which the nation was founded."
Rice is portrayed as ideal for elected office.
Brown highlights Rice's 1992 speech to the Re
publican National Convention, also noting that
Rice was on the short list to fill Pete Wilson's U.S.
Senate seat when he was elected governor of Cal
ifornia in 1990.
Rehashing Rice's time at Stanford
Two of the 13 chapters in Brown's book are
about Rice's tenure at Stanford. The first, titled
"Professor Rice," focuses on her evolution from
an arms-control fellow in 1980 to a George H.W.
Bush appointee in 1988. The second. "Tackling a
Monstrous Deficit," attempts to put a positive
spin on Rice's controversial tenure as provost.
For her sections on Rice's time on the Farm,
Brown relies heavily on articles from the Univer
sity's News Service, Stanford Magazine (which
she erroneously calls "the school newspaper").
The Daily and previously published profiles in
national publications. There are a handful of miss
ing citations in the endnotes.
Even the book's subtitle, "The Life of a Steel
Magnolia," comes from a story that ran in The
Stanford Report in June 1999, when Prof. Coit
Blacker described his close friend Rice as a steel

magnolia.
"She has a wonderful kind of Southern affect
in the positive sense, a kind of graciousness,"
Blacker said. "But mixed with this is a very steely
inner core. She always knows what she wants and
is extremely disciplined, both at personal and pro
fessional levels."
Attributing her success to faith
Faith, in Brown's view, was pivotal at turning
points in Rice's life. Brown says that Rice's church
attendance during her early years at Stanford was
"sporadic."
"Then a provincial encounter brought Condi
back to church," she explains, noting that Rice
met a man who got her involved with a Baptist
church in Palo Alto.
Rice would soon decide to attend Menlo Park
Presbyterian Church. Bizarrely, Brown identifies
that church as being in Palo Alto. It was there.
Brown writes, that a sermon on the prodigal son
prompted Rice to recommit "herself to the Lord,
not just for Sundays, but for every day."
Creating a legend of Rice
Brown draws parallels between Rice and Rea
gan.
"Besides being often underestimated, they
can take difficult and complex issues and explain
them in language which people understand," she
writes, using the present tense to describe Rea
gan, who died in 2004. "They are both optimists
and visionaries. They are able to share optimism
with others as they paint a picture of what is pos
sible. and this skill they share gives people hope.
Both are strong people of faith who trust in the
providence of God."
