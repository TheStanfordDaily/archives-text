Author Mary Beth Brown, who previously
wrote a bestselling book on Ronald Reagan's
faith, describes herself on the flyleaf of "Condi" as
a former delegate to Republican conventions, a
guest on Fox News and a frequent speaker to
Christian and conservative audiences.
Though the book adds nothing in the way of
meaningful scholarship. Brown's gushing por
trayal serves to demonstrate the continuing pop
ularity of Rice among the president's base. It also
reminds observers why — even though she con
tinues to insist she will return to Stanford in 2009
— Rice may be a formidable politician after Bush
leaves office next January.
A political future?
The book is not slated for release until Jan. 15.
But several copies — selling at the full $26 retail
price — were available near the Stanford Book
store's entrance on Wednesday.
