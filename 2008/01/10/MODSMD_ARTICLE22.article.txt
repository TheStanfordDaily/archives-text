## Software aids creation of digital worlds Computer Science team simplifies 3-D creation

Videogame players have Stanford
researchers to thank for the latest in
novation in 3-D design. Last month,
the Virtual Worlds Group — a re
search group in the Computer Sci
ence department — released a soft
ware program called Dryad that facil
itates the creation of three-dimen
sional trees for use in virtual worlds
and games.
High-quality three-dimensional
content can be found in games such as
World of Warcraft or online social
communities like Second Life. The
process of creating this content is gen
erally extremely difficult.
"There is a very, very tiny commu
nity of people around the world who
are skilled at creating three-dimen
sional objects, and they are the ones
who do it all," said Computer Science
Assistant Prof. Vladlen Koltun. head
of the project."[This] is one of the rea
sons why you don't see three-dimen
sional content on the Web; because
nobody can create it."
The developers of Dryad aim to
make 3-D content creation — specifi

cally. the creation of trees — more ac
cessible to individuals with no special
training. The software allows users to
intuitively "create" trees by visually
navigating to them. Dryad allows the
user to explore a multi-dimensional
design space as if it were a city map.
"What's especially cool about
Dryad is the fact that as users pick out
good trees, their choices are used to
guide the choices of future users," said
Daniel Gibson '09. who worked ex
tensively on the project.
Since not all trees are equally de
sirable. Dryad has a built-in mathe
matical model that leads users toward
trees that have some resemblance to
trees that have proven popular with
other users.
The Dryad program is but the
first of a series of modeling tools the
Virtual Worlds Group plans to cre
ate in order to allow casual users to
design high-quality 3-D content.The
group decided to start with trees
rather than, for instance, houses or
people, because the trees of the real
world have been catalogued and cat
egorized particularly thoroughly by
botanists.
Dryad can be downloaded for
free at http://dryad.stanford.edu.
