## Presidential race remains toss-up 
### DAVID ESPO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Barack Obama dug in Wednesday for
a campaign unlike any other.a woman
and a black man drawing record voter
turnout in an unpredictable race for
the Democratic presidential nomina
tion. John McCain claimed the role of
resident underdog in the Republican
race, despite his big win in the New
Hampshire primary.
Adding to the most wide open
presidential campaign in a half-centu
ry. associates of New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg disclosed he had
authorized polling and voter analysis
in all 50 states in a possible precursor
to an independent candidacy.
Clinton, the former first lady, re
flected on her memorable moment of
emotion the day before she gained her
New Hampshire victory. "Maybe 1
have liberated us to actually let
women be human beings in public"
she said.
Obama saw it differently."We have
to make sure that we take it to them
just like they take it to us," he said. De
spite his defeat, he pocketed the sup
port of two key Nevada unions in ad
vance of that state's Jan. 19 caucuses,
and predicted a win in the South Car
olina primary a week later.
After a grueling, months-long slog
through lowa and New 1 lampshire,
Clinton and Obama face a brief lull in
the calendar, but collide in four weeks
time in primaries and caucuses in 22
states in the equivalent of a nation
wide primary. Former Sen. John Ed
wards vowed to remain in the race de
spite a weak third-place finish in New
Hampshire, but New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson dropped out.
McCain made simultaneous ap
peals to independents and Republi
cans as he campaigned in Michigan for
a victory that could drive former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney
from the race."The Republican estab
lishment has never embraced me in
my entire life. But I think we just
proved that we can get the support of
enough to win an election," he told re
porters on his way to Grand Rapids.
He added he would try to remind
evangelical voters "that my social con
servative record has been consistent
and unchanging."
New Hampshire win or no, he said
in Grand Rapids, "I'm always an un
derdog. I always want to be called an
underdog."
Romney withdrew television ad
vertising in South Carolina and Flori
da, two states with primaries later this
month, despite telling supporters the
race was just getting started and rais
ing $1.5 million during the day for the
campaign for the nomination. "We
feel the best strategy is to focus our
paid messaging in Michigan." said his
spokesman. Kevin Madden.
The former Massachusetts gover
nor's sole victor)' to date was in last
weekend's scarcely contested
Wyoming caucuses.The candidate try
ing to become the nation's first Mor
mon president leads in the early com
petition for national convention dele
gates, but that is cold comfort for a
man who spent millions of his own
money in a failed attempt to sweep the
early contests and establish himself as

the man to beat in the race for the Re
publican nomination.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee's plan to campaign in
Michigan complicated the McCain-
Romney rematch and injected a new
note of uncertainty.
I luckabee. who won the lowa cau
cuses, and McCain have been the
equivalent of a tag-team against Rom
ney. But in Michigan and South Car-

olina, they will be in direct competi
tion. Even so, said Huckabee,"! don't
see us going out there and taking the
gloves off."
The question of nominees aside,
the first contests of the election year
produced far higher turnout among
Democrats than Republicans, a possi
ble sign of trouble for the GOP in the
general election campaign this fall. In
New Hampshire, nearly complete re
turns showed more than 284,(XX) votes
cast in the Democratic race, to 233,000
on the Republican side.
In lowa, an estimated 220.(XX) vot
ers attended Democratic caucuses,
well in excess of the previous record of
124,(XX). Republican caucus-goers to
taled about 114.(XX).
Bloomberg, a second-term mayor
of New York, has repeatedly denied
interest in a White I louse bid. but as
sociates said his decision to gather in
formation on a possible run was made
months ago. I lis spokesman, Stu
Loeser, declined to comment.
Interviews with voters leaving
polling places in New Hampshire
showed that women voters, who sided
with Obama in lowa,powered Clinton
to her upset win in New I lampshire.
They accounted for an unexpectedly
large 57 percent of the turnout, and
she gained 46 percent of their votes, to
34 percent for Obama. She also won
among Democrats, while he outpolled
her among independents.
The same survey also suggested
that economic concerns, apparently
growing nationally as an issue, worked
to Clinton's advantage. She easily de
feated Obama among voters who said
it was their top issue. Obama was pre
ferred by voters who said the war was
their top concern.
Clinton and Obama were basically
tied among voters most concerned
about health care, an issue on which
she has often criticized him.
Increasingly, ready cash was be
coming a factor in both races.
McCain's aides said he had raised
about $1 million in the first eight days
of the election year, and looked for an
increase with the New Hampshire vic
tory on his ledger.
Obama scampaign said the Illinois
senator had taken in more than $X mil
lion and gained 35.000 new donors
since Jan. 1, including $1.5 million on
line since midnight Tliesday. Obama

raised $22.5 million in the last three
months of the year for the primary
election and an extra $ 1 million for the
general election, the campaign said.
Clinton's campaign said she had
raised more than $1 million in Internet
donations in the hours since her pri
mary victory.
She met with advisers in her Wash
ington office, and her only scheduled
public remarks of the day came in a

round of early morning television in

Appearing on Fox. she agreed that
Monday's oft-replayed display of
emotion, when her voice quavered as
she was asked how she dealt with the
grind of the campaign, had made a dif
ference. "Maybe I have liberated us to
actually let women be human beings
in public,"she said." You know, we are.
Let's be that."
Clinton's aides said she would con
tinue to devote time at her campaign
stops to answering questions from vot
ers, something she did not always do in
her losing lowa campaign.

She said she felt good about the
New Hampshire vote because "it gave
me a chance to ... really regain my
footing and to make clear that I'm
going to put all my years of experience
to work on behalf of the people of our
country'."
Edwards, who finished a weak
third in New Hampshire, set up shop
in South Carolina, 'it's the first time
we've had a primary that has a large
African-American population. So I
think it's a place that's a good test for
all three of us" he said. He pitched
himself as a native son.
"I'm not someone who has to have
somebody explain to them what's
happening with the mills closing, jobs
leaving, what's happening with the
school system in South Carolina," Ed
wards said. "You need someone who
understands it personally."
Despite his determination, one
union that backed him in the 2004
campaign, UNITE HERE, cast its lot
with Obama. Its president, Bruce
Raynor, suggested it was time for Ed
wards to leave the stage to Clinton and
Obama. "One could argue that it's not
over until it's over, and of course that
would be true, but it's my judgment
and our judgment that there are only
two realistic candidates for the Demo
cratic nomination at this point," he
said.

Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Barack Obama dug in Wednesday for
a campaign unlike any other.a woman
and a black man drawing record voter
turnout in an unpredictable race for
the Democratic presidential nomina
tion. John McCain claimed the role of
resident underdog in the Republican
race, despite his big win in the New
Hampshire primary.
Adding to the most wide open
presidential campaign in a half-centu
ry. associates of New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg disclosed he had
authorized polling and voter analysis
in all 50 states in a possible precursor
to an independent candidacy.
Clinton, the former first lady, re
flected on her memorable moment of
emotion the day before she gained her
New Hampshire victory. "Maybe 1
have liberated us to actually let
women be human beings in public"
she said.
Obama saw it differently."We have
to make sure that we take it to them
just like they take it to us," he said. De
spite his defeat, he pocketed the sup
port of two key Nevada unions in ad
vance of that state's Jan. 19 caucuses,
and predicted a win in the South Car
olina primary a week later.
After a grueling, months-long slog
through lowa and New 1 lampshire,
Clinton and Obama face a brief lull in
the calendar, but collide in four weeks
time in primaries and caucuses in 22
states in the equivalent of a nation
wide primary. Former Sen. John Ed
wards vowed to remain in the race de
spite a weak third-place finish in New
Hampshire, but New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson dropped out.
McCain made simultaneous ap
peals to independents and Republi
cans as he campaigned in Michigan for
a victory that could drive former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney
from the race."The Republican estab
lishment has never embraced me in
my entire life. But I think we just
proved that we can get the support of
enough to win an election," he told re
porters on his way to Grand Rapids.
He added he would try to remind
evangelical voters "that my social con
servative record has been consistent
and unchanging."
New Hampshire win or no, he said
in Grand Rapids, "I'm always an un
derdog. I always want to be called an
underdog."
Romney withdrew television ad
vertising in South Carolina and Flori
da, two states with primaries later this
month, despite telling supporters the
race was just getting started and rais
ing $1.5 million during the day for the
campaign for the nomination. "We
feel the best strategy is to focus our
paid messaging in Michigan." said his
spokesman. Kevin Madden.
The former Massachusetts gover
nor's sole victor)' to date was in last
weekend's scarcely contested
Wyoming caucuses.The candidate try
ing to become the nation's first Mor
mon president leads in the early com
petition for national convention dele
gates, but that is cold comfort for a
man who spent millions of his own
money in a failed attempt to sweep the
early contests and establish himself as

the man to beat in the race for the Re
publican nomination.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee's plan to campaign in
Michigan complicated the McCain-
Romney rematch and injected a new
note of uncertainty.
I luckabee. who won the lowa cau
cuses, and McCain have been the
equivalent of a tag-team against Rom
ney. But in Michigan and South Car-

olina, they will be in direct competi
tion. Even so, said Huckabee,"! don't
see us going out there and taking the
gloves off."
The question of nominees aside,
the first contests of the election year
produced far higher turnout among
Democrats than Republicans, a possi
ble sign of trouble for the GOP in the
general election campaign this fall. In
New Hampshire, nearly complete re
turns showed more than 284,(XX) votes
cast in the Democratic race, to 233,000
on the Republican side.
In lowa, an estimated 220.(XX) vot
ers attended Democratic caucuses,
well in excess of the previous record of
124,(XX). Republican caucus-goers to
taled about 114.(XX).
Bloomberg, a second-term mayor
of New York, has repeatedly denied
interest in a White I louse bid. but as
sociates said his decision to gather in
formation on a possible run was made
months ago. I lis spokesman, Stu
Loeser, declined to comment.
Interviews with voters leaving
polling places in New Hampshire
showed that women voters, who sided
with Obama in lowa,powered Clinton
to her upset win in New I lampshire.
They accounted for an unexpectedly
large 57 percent of the turnout, and
she gained 46 percent of their votes, to
34 percent for Obama. She also won
among Democrats, while he outpolled
her among independents.
The same survey also suggested
that economic concerns, apparently
growing nationally as an issue, worked
to Clinton's advantage. She easily de
feated Obama among voters who said
it was their top issue. Obama was pre
ferred by voters who said the war was
their top concern.
Clinton and Obama were basically
tied among voters most concerned
about health care, an issue on which
she has often criticized him.
Increasingly, ready cash was be
coming a factor in both races.
McCain's aides said he had raised
about $1 million in the first eight days
of the election year, and looked for an
increase with the New Hampshire vic
tory on his ledger.
Obama scampaign said the Illinois
senator had taken in more than $X mil
lion and gained 35.000 new donors
since Jan. 1, including $1.5 million on
line since midnight Tliesday. Obama

raised $22.5 million in the last three
months of the year for the primary
election and an extra $ 1 million for the
general election, the campaign said.
Clinton's campaign said she had
raised more than $1 million in Internet
donations in the hours since her pri
mary victory.
She met with advisers in her Wash
