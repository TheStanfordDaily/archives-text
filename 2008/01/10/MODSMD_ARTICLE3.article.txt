## Stanford seeks profs. to study race Five-year plan aims for 10 new scholars in CCSRE 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to contribute to Stanford's on
going commitments to faculty diversity and
the study of race and ethnicity, the University
has launched the Faculty Development Ini
tiative (FDI) — a five-year plan to appoint at
least 10 of the top young scholars in the na
tion whose research focuses on ethnicity and
race.
The introduction of the FDI program fol
lows the commitment of Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. "82 last spring to create 10
incremental faculty positions in the Center
for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnic
ity (CCSRE), which now consists of more
than 100 affiliated faculty members from 15
departments and five schools.
The program involves the collaboration of
CCSRE, the Office of the Provost, the Office
of the Dean of Humanities and Sciences and
the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty De
velopment and Diversity,
Special Assistant to the Provost for Facul
ty Diversity and History Prof. Al Camarillo is
ending the initiative. According to Ca
marillo, the FDI program was created
to recognize the achievement of
CCSRE. which is in its second decade,
in addition to further building its facul
ty strengths in the study of race and eth
nicity and contributing to the I Jniversi
ty's efforts to promote diversity among
the faculty.
lhe initiative will be supported by a
gift of $2.5 million, as well as another $2
million in a grant from the Hewlett
Foundation to the Schix>l of Humani
ties and Sciences. Over the next five
years. FDI will create a collaborative
environment in which schools and de
partments will participate in a multifac
eted recruitment and appointment
project to hire junior and senior faculty
in subject areas focusing on issues of
race and ethnicity.
An advisory group that consists of
senior faculty has been appointed by
the Provost and will provide advice and
consultation on the initiative. Members

of the group will identify outstanding
prospects, such as advanced graduate
students finishing their doctoral disser
tations to assistant and newly tenured
associate professors.
"Recruiting faculty prospects is the
easier part of the equation for the FDI,"
Camarillo said. "Actually getting them
to accept offers and to come to Stan
ford is the more difficult part."
He added that the incoming faculty
will be based in their respective depart
ments and affiliated with CCSRE
through their teaching and research.
According to CCSRF and the Of
fice of the Provost, the plan reflects the
University's effort to solidify its stand
ing as the preeminent university in the
nation focusing on the comparative
study of race and ethnicity.
While the initiative is set for five
years, CCSRF. officials were reluctant
to put a definitive deadline on the hir
ing process. Since the initiative is oper
ating in an extremely competitive envi
ronment with a small pool of scholars,
recruiting new faculty will be a timely
process.
