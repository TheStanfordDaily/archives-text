Before last weekend, it had been 14 years
since UCLA and USC had swept Stanford.
But the No. 7 Cardinal's arrival in Los Ange

an uncharacteristic outing against the Bru
ins, in which Tara VanDerveer's squad shot
at just a 29.6 percent clip and committed 18

turnovers. Despite a better showing against
the Trojans, then-No. 2 Stanford's depend

Oregon State (8-6,1-2 Pac-10) on Thursday
and Oregon (8-6, 2-1 Pac-10) on Saturday,
looking to get rid of the bad taste in its collec

"[Coach VanDerveer] was disappointed

NOTES: The No. 7 Cardinal return home tonight after
dropping two straight in Southern California to confer
ence rivals UCLA and USC. The road sweep was the first
Stanford had suffered since the 2003 04 season, and
the pair of losses dropped the Cardinal five spots in the
rankings from their previous perch at No. 2. The Beavers
are coming off of a 69 60, double overtime upset of Ari
zona, and are led by their talented back-court of Fbc-10
leading scorer Ashley Allen, averaging 21.1 points per
game, and Brittney Davis, whose average also impres
sively rests in the double figures at 13.6
