# No. 7 Card looks to rebound vs. OSU
## 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Before last weekend, it had been 14 years
since UCLA and USC had swept Stanford.
But the No. 7 Cardinal's arrival in Los Ange
les on the first weekend of 2008 began with
an uncharacteristic outing against the Bru
ins, in which Tara VanDerveer's squad shot
at just a 29.6 percent clip and committed 18

turnovers. Despite a better showing against
the Trojans, then-No. 2 Stanford's depend
ence on senior guard Candice Wiggins and
sophomore center Jayne Appel led to its
downfall in the final two minutes against
USC.
Now. the Cardinal (12-3.2-2 Pac-10) faces
Oregon State (8-6,1-2 Pac-10) on Thursday
and Oregon (8-6, 2-1 Pac-10) on Saturday,
looking to get rid of the bad taste in its collec

tive mouth.
"[Coach VanDerveer] was disappointed
with our effort the entire weekend," Appel
said. "She definitely knows that we could've
come out of there with two W's, and 1 think
she really just wants us to get back in the
gym. to get back on track, to get refocused.
and to do what's necessary [to get the wins
this weekend]."
Wiggins echoed the need to recalibrate.

especially on the offensive end.
"We had a few days off of practice," Wig

on executing our offense and just making
sure that, with our small margin for error, we
eliminate [mistakes]."

NOTES: The No. 7 Cardinal return home tonight after
dropping two straight in Southern California to confer
ence rivals UCLA and USC. The road sweep was the first
Stanford had suffered since the 2003 04 season, and
the pair of losses dropped the Cardinal five spots in the
rankings from their previous perch at No. 2. The Beavers
are coming off of a 69 60, double overtime upset of Ari
zona, and are led by their talented back-court of Fbc-10
leading scorer Ashley Allen, averaging 21.1 points per
game, and Brittney Davis, whose average also impres
sively rests in the double figures at 13.6

The No. 7 Cardinal women suffered their first two game road sweep in three years last weekend in Southern California, and will look
for the comforts of a home court advantage to help restore their winning ways this weekend against OSU and Oregon.
ble-overtime win against Arizona, though, might
deserve an asterisk. Just six Wildcats suited up for
the match, and only two Arizona players were on
the floor at the end of the contest.
Stanford cannot afford to discount the Beavers,
though, as OSU will come to Maples fired up.
"I think that they'll come in with an attitude,es
pecially with us being their big game," Appel said.
"But we'll be ready to go."
Wiggins agreed, but noted that she and her
teammates were used to having a bullseye on their
backs after dominating the Pac-10 in recent mem
ory.
"A lot of teams bring their A' games against us,
which is good." Wiggins said. "I think it's really
going to be important for us to learn how to have
our 'A' game all the time. We can't just be satisfied
with 'B' and 'C' games, so the biggest thing we'll
focus on is coming out strong every single game we
play."
This will be especially important for the guards,
who face a strong Beavers backcourt in senior Ash
ley Allen and junior Brittany Davis, who combined
for 59 points against Arizona, and are ranked first
and seventh respectively in the conference in scor
ing. Allen and Davis are supported by junior Cedes
Fox-Griffin, who has a conference-best 59 assists.
Wiggins said the Cardinal defense would focus on
shutting down the trio.
"[Allen and Davis are] definitely going to make
us have a defensive mindset in really locking down
their offense," Wiggins said. "But it's a team de
fense, and we're going to rely a lot on our posts for
help for penetration. We're always looking to go in
side, but (this weekend] we'll definitely be going in
side more."
Stanford's interior freshman-sophomore com
bination of Kayla Pedersen and Appel should have
less to worry about in the post than the Stanford
guards. However, junior center Tiffany Ducker
cannot be left unattended as the bigs offer low sup
port. Ducker averages more than five defensive re
bounds per game, and has 17 blocks on the year.
Like Oregon State, the Cardinal will have to
spread out its offense more than it has in the last
few games if it expects to win. Appel and Wiggins
dominate just about every offensive team statistic
for Stanford, and the two combined for all but 10 of
Stanford's points in last week's loss to UCLA. If
the C ardinal want to win this weekend, Pedersen
will also have to contribute in the post.
The Cardinal will look to silence their critics this
weekend and recognize the importance of bounc
ing back.
"I think its good that we'll have a lot more drive
in upcoming games, not that we need it," Appel
said. "1 think Jill [Harmon] said our backs are
against the wall a lot more now. We always know
that we have big targets on our backs in Pac-10
play, but now it's just got to get done."
