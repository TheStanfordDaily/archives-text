## Super battery in works Discovery could increase battery life for iPods, laptops by 10 times 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
It's the end of a long, exhausting day.

The next morning.you check your cell and

Battery life is one of the only limita
tions of widespread electronic use. How
ever, it may no longer be a concern in the
near future: the research of Materials Sci
ences and Engineering Prof. Yi Cui could
significantly elongate battery life.
Cui has been studying the use of silicon
nanowires to increase battery capacity,
perhaps by as much as 10 times. He ex
plained that a laptop that lasts two hours
today may last up to 20 hours if the new
battery research is applied.
Cui's research has implications for
everyday appliances such as iPods, lap
tops, cell phones, electric automobiles and
even medical devices such as pacemakers.
"There are many companies that have
contacted us about our research." said Can
dace Chan, a graduate chemistry student in
Cui's lab. "Tesla Motors is talking to us

about using this technology in their cars."
Cui explained that a simple concept lies
behind his newfound discovery.
"How much energy a battery can store
depends on how many lithium ions can be
stored," he said. "The more lithium ions,
the higher the battery power. Using silicon
nanowire electrodes allows us to store
more lithium ions without increasing the
weight of the battery."
Though silicon has been recognized as
a good and cheap material for batteries, it
has never been applied due to the fact that
it expands upon absorbing lithium.
"My idea," Cui explained, "was to use
nanowires. When nanowires take a lot of
lithium in, they are so small that they don't
break."
If Cui's silicon batteries become com
mercialized, the silicon would replace the
carbon that is currently being used in bat
teries.
"Carbon is already an environmentally
friendly material." he said."But the silicon
battery can help electric cars become
more popular since high energy power is
important for electric automobiles."
But there is still much to be accom
plished both in the laboratory and in the

market.
"We have
a laboratory
prototype so
far," Chan

said. "The next step would be
to commercialize this into
something that can be used in
a laptop or cell phone."
"Research-wise. 1 plan on
pushing towards making this

battery technology
better," Cui said.
"From a practical
standpoint, I'm
thinking about

starting up a company or
working with existing com
panies to push this technol
ogy into commercializa
tion."

Nonetheless,Cui's research has already
received international publicity.
"We've had media from Germany and
China contact us," Chan said. "This is a
very exciting topic of research right now."
