## Winter shuttle sees changes 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The winter break run of the ASSU
airport shuttle operated relatively
smoothly, hut not without a few humps
in the road.
The program, which has grown in
popularity since its inception last spring,
had inadequate resources to handle the
high demand for shuttles during its
Thanksgiving run, and as a result, the
ASSU made a few changes for the win
ter break program in order to handle the
spike in passengers.
"We decided to not only have the
shuttles run more frequently, but also
added another shuttle for our San Jose
airport rounds," said ASSU President
Hershey Avula '08. "In total, we saw this
increase in supply meet the demand rea
sonably well, as the program attracted
818 student users without completely
selling out all the shuttles."
Avula said a few changes were made
to the ASSU Web site instructions as
well. Passengers were encouraged to ar
rive at shuttle pick-up locations at the
time their shuttle first began its run. In
past runs, many passengers arrived at the
location-specific pick-up time suggested
by the ASSU's time schedule.
The ASSU said the winter run result
ed in fewer reported problems than any
other run. Still, two students were denied
entry to the 9 a.m. shuttle to San Irancis
co International Airport by the driver,
who was using seat space for excess pas
senger luggage.
Avula was surprised at the problem
and said the ASSU will be contacting the
shuttle vendor for more information.
Undergraduate Senate Chair Priyan
ka Sharma '09 said the ASSU is looking
to operate the shuttle service at the end
of winter quarter.
"Tentatively speaking, the shuttle will
probably run again for spring break
since we want to consistently provide the
students with a cheap, good service," she
said.
The ASSU is already considering a
few changes for a potential shuttle run
during spring break.
"At this point we are beginning to
take into consideration bringing stu
dents back from the airport as well as
trying to make our service more accom
modating to students," Avula said. "We
are also looking into a more sophisticat
ed ticketing system and instructing the
drivers more thoroughly to ensure that
they do not overlook or miss any stops
with students waiting."
The ASSU will be seeking approval
with the "appropriate legislative bodies"
before committing to a round of airport
shuttles for the end of winter quarter.
