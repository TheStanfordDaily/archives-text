## Fellowship rewards career teachers 
### NIKHIL JOSHI 
In an effort to create a "Rhodes Scholar
ship for teaching," the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation is launch
ing a fellowship program that promises to
attract top students to the teaching profes
sion — and keep them there.
"We're trying to produce teachers who
won't view teaching as episodes in their
lives hut as a career" said Wilson Founda
tion President Arthur Levine.
The program will offer 33 Leonore An
nenberg Teaching Fellowships every year
beginning in 2009, each of which will pro
vide a $30,000 stipend for students at four
top graduate education programs, includ
ing Stanford's Teacher Education Program
(STEP), which was recently recognized as
one of the country's top programs of its
kind.
David Haselkorn, director of the An
nenberg Fellowship Program, said that
Stanford was chosen because of its innova
tive teaching practices and prior work with
high-need Bay Area schools.
Along with granting the fellowships, the
foundation is advocating for a series of im
provements to education programs.
"The Stanford program is a showcase of
good practices, and will be a model for what
happens when changes are made [at other
schools]," Haselkorn said.

The changes will include increased col
laboration with arts and sciences faculty
and a third year of post-graduation mentor
ing for Annenberg fellows, and most impor
tantly, more training time in classrooms
during graduate study, something that
Levine believes to be very important in the
"We hope we can retain
a substantial percantage,
if not 100 percent of the
cohort."

education of young teachers.
"Education schools aren't strong
enough," Levine said. "Students leave
afraid of what will happen to them in the
classroom.They need to get out of the ivory
tower and into schools."
Education Prof. Linda Darling-Ham

mond said that Stanford's emphasis on
classroom experience is one of its biggest
strengths.
"We've been selected as one of the top
teacher education programs in the country
in two recent national reports, including
one by Art Levine, because of our strong
program model which features close rela
tionships with local reform-minded schools
and extensive clinical experience for our
students," she said.
Annenberg Fellows will follow their
classroom-based graduate study program
with three years at a high-need school, dur
ing which they will continue to receive
strong support and mentoring.
"We arc creating a developmental arc
that continues for the first three years of
teaching," Haselkorn said. "It will be a
much stronger developmental arc that will
sustain a full career."
The Wilson Foundation anticipates that
the enhanced preparation and support that
Annenberg Fellows receive will lead them
to become life-long teachers.
"If they are effective in the first three
years, then it is likely that they will want to
stay on as teachers," Haselkorn said. "We
hope we can retain a substantial percent
age, if not 100 percent of the cohort."
The Annenberg Fellowships' focus on
encouraging new teachers to make a career
in the classroom is fundamentally different

from other programs, such as Teach For
America, which sees only roughly half of its
alumni continue as teachers after their two
year commitments are over.
Teach for America's Los Angeles Exec
utive Director Brian Johnson, J.D. 04,
M.B. A '04 said that Teach for America has
very different goals from the Annenberg
program.
"We are building a movement of leaders
to close the achievement gap in America,"
Johnson said. "The problem is, there are not
enough leaders in our society who under
stand the problem."
Instead of creating only life-long teach
ers. Teach for America also hopes to create
CEOs, senators, superintendents and other
leaders who will be in positions where they
are better equipped to eliminate the
achievement gap.
"Teach for America is not a teacher de
velopment program; it's a leadership devel
opment program," Johnson said.
The first Annenberg Fellows will be
named in the spring of 2009 and will begin
their three-year stints in high need schools
in 2010.
"We will look for candidates with strong
academic records and a desire to make a
sustained effort to teach for a career,"
Haselkorn said.
