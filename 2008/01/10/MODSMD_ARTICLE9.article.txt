### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Anthony Bryk,Spencer Chair in Organizational Studies
in the School of Education and the Graduate School of
Business, has been selected as the next president of the
Carnegie Foundation.
Bryk will begin his tenure in August. The 103 year-old
Carnegie Foundation, which focuses on research and policy
related to education, has been led for 11 years by Lee S.
Schulman, who is retiring.
"[Bryk] has a tremendous ability to think and act across
disciplines and to bring together theory and practice," said
David S.Tatel, chairman of the Carnegie Board of Trustees,
in a press release.
Bryk previously helped found the Center for Urban
School Improvement at the University of Chicago, as well as
the Consortium on Chicago School Research. He is best
known as a developer of a statistical technique called hier
archical linear modeling and is also researching the use of
technology in schools.
"We're in a period of extraordinary institutional change
in U.S. education." Bryk told The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation on Tuesday. "The systems that we put in place, large
ly as we turned into the 20th century and into an industrial
economy and a period of urbanization â€” all of those insti
tutions are now being seriously challenged as we aspire to
do much more, for many more students, than ever before,
and to do it with much greater levels of efficiency."
"And sitting in the middle of this is this whale of technol
ogy. which is totally transforming how we live and how we
work," he continued. "The transformation in the context of
schooling may be a little bit slower than in some other insti
tutions, but it seems quite clear that profound changes are
coming here."
