What will it mean to live twice as long as your ancestors?
K> ; '■ .'■ ".. '
In this course students will learn about the implications of longer lives for themselves and for societies.
Myths and misconceptions surround the aging process and societal implications are often blurred by political grandstanding. The objective of
the course is to provide students with an informed grasp of the conceptual issues, empirical findings and current controversies surrounding
longevity. By adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, Professor Rando - a neurologist and biogerontologist - and Professor Carstensen - a
psychologist and life-span developmentalist - and their colleagues associated with the Stanford Center on Longevity will help students
understand new challenges to health care, financial markets, families, work, and politics.
