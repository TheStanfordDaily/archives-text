# The
						"good guys" win
## even for infants

Harry Potter and Voldemort. Bat
man and the Joker. Luke Sky
walker and Darth Vader. Distin
guishing between heroes and
villains might be second nature
to us, but can infants do the same?
Researchers at Yale have found that in
fants as young as six months old can not only
discriminate between the "good guys" and
the "bad guys," but that they overwhelming
ly prefer the good guys. This capacity for so
cial evaluation appears earlier than anyone
had expected, backing the claim that it is an
important biological adaption and thus
hardwired into our DNA.
"We were shocked by the strength of the
responses," said J. kiley Hamlin of Yale Uni
versity's Infant Cognition Center, the lead
researcher of the study. "We thought infants
would be sensitive to the behavior of others,
but didn't anticipate the extent of this."
Nestled on their parents' laps. 12 six
month-old babies and 16 10-month-old ba
bies watched a puppet show in which three
colorful blocks, humanized by large googly
eyes, played the roles of "climber." "helper"
and "hinderer."The babies watched as a yel-

low
triangle
struggled to
climb a green hill

before being either
shouldered up by a "helper"
red square or sent tumbling back

down by an aggressive blue circle. At the end
of the show, the researchers asked the babies
to choose between the square or the circle
from a tray in front of them, and the "helper"
was chosen almost every time.
To determine whether infants made pos-

itive,
negative
or both kinds of

evaluations about the
characters in the play, the
researchers then added to the
„l • : a 4 1"

puppet show an oblivious "neutral
block who climbed the same hill without
ever interacting with the triangle. Then the
infant was made to choose either between
the neutral block and the "helper." or the
neutral block and the "hinderer." The in
fants chose the "helper" over the neutral
block, and the neutral block over the "hin
derer," implying that they are capable of

making both positive and negative evalua
tions.
Previous research shows that adults will
take both behavior and physical features
into account when evaluating another per
son. Until Hamlin's study, researchers
thought that infants could use only physical
features (like attractiveness and race) to in
fluence their preferences at six months. Now
she has shown that infants can use their ob
servations of a character's behavior toward
an unrelated third party to shape their judg
ments.
"This capacity [to assess individuals on
the basis of their behavior toward others]
may serve as the foundation for moral
thought and action, and its early develop
mental emergence supports the view that so
cial evaluation is a biological adaptation,"
Hamlin and her colleagues reported.
Why would we conserve this ability to as
sess people's trustworthiness in our very
genes? Cooperative activities like hunting,
allocation of food and warfare in early tribal
societies would have required that an indi
vidual could distinguish "team players" from
"free riders" to ensure the survival of the en
tire group. And knowing how to evaluate
people is just as important in our society
today, as we make friends, fall in love and
pursue our careers.
But even if we are hardwired with a moral
compass and the capacity to assess other
people's behavior, that doesn't mean that
the ability is there from the beginning. In
stead, our skill and understanding develops
over time, and we see only the first evidence
at six months.
A rudimentary moral system, in which
the infant reacts positively to those who are
kind and negatively to those who are cruel,
constitutes the basis of a more abstract sys
tem that will develop later on. The re
searchers called this ability to assess other
people's behavior and morality by six
months "universal and unlearned" because it
is unlikely that parents could have had
enough time to teach their children to prefer
"helpers" and avoid "hinderers." In fact, pre
liminary research by Hamlin has now found
similar responses in three-month-olds.
"We know that [infants are] very, very so
cial beings from very, very early on," Hamlin
said. She has shown that infants appear to
like characters who help others achieve their
goals and dislike characters who want to stop
others from achieving them. Future research
will further explore the complexity of this so
cial evaluation in infants as well as whether
this capacity can be found in other species.
