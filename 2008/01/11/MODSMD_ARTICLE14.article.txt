# In honest dialogue:
## Group tackles sometimes taboo topic of religion with openness 
### CHELSEA MA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If there's one thing that students
and presidential candidates have in
common, it's the tendency to ap
proach religious topics on tiptoe. For
members of the Fellowship for Reli
gious Encounter (FRE). however,
there is no fear of entering this con
troversial territory.
"During my first year at Stanford,
there wasn't much of an opportunity
to discuss religious issues with other
students, and I felt a certain void
there."Trent Walker *10 said. "When
1 saw that chance in FRE, it seemed
like it was not always going to he a
safe dialogue. Many of our conversa
tions are based on that kind of open
ness and willingness to go scary
places."
FRE. in its second year, is all
about broaching delicate issues. Why
do I believe in the teachings of my
religion? Am I prejudiced toward
other faiths? With only 14 students,
carefully chosen each spring to rep
resent a wide spectrum of beliefs —

even atheists and agnostics — FRE
holds what Dean of Religions Life
Patricia Karlin-Neumann describes
as a unique sense of community that
makes interfaith dialogue among its
members comfortable.
"It is a place of calm in the midst
of very busy schedules and responsi
bilities." Karlin-Neumann said.
"There is a deep respect for one an
other's religious communities and
convictions, especially for some of
the more misunderstood or little
known traditions."
What distinguishes FRE is its
focus on trust as a key to opening up
discussion. At the start of the year,
the students began developing ties
by going on a retreat to Mercy Cen
ter. There, each member walked
through a labyrinth for a moment of
reflection, and brought a sacred ob
ject of personal value to share with
the group.
"People made a lot of very per
sonal comments and did a very mov
ing job of being open with this group
of strangers that we knew we would
eventually get to know intimately,"

Emily Grubert '09 said. "At least for
me, the experience was very much
one of 'well, I'm sure that after this
year, I'll be laughing at the idea that
1 ever didn't know these people, so
why not open up now?"'
They also analyzed a book called
"The Faith Club," a story about a
Muslim. Jew and Christian who get
together post-Sept. 11, using the
book's chapters to raise topics such
as conversion, misunderstandings
about religious communities, and
how to work through these pre
sumptions.
Weekly discussions, held over
meals provided by Center for Inter-
Religious Community. Learning and
Experiences (CIRCLE) Coordina
tor Linda Miller, are filled with hon
esty, reevaluations and answers.
"The consistency is important be
cause it allows you to forge bonds
and know the other students on a
level that you don't get with a lot of
people at Stanford, because every
time you see them you're talking
about some deep issue," said
Michael Petrin '09, who was a mem

ber of FRE last year. "I think trust is
absolutely fundamental to interfaith
dialogue because it engages stu
dents' deepest beliefs and the things
that they hold most dear."
The group also engages in weekly
rotations in which students meet one
on one with each other. Members
often find that these conversations
allow them to break down religious
stereotypes and understand differ
ent beliefs on a fuller scale.
"You begin to realize that you
can't just pin down a religion and say
you understand it by knowing doc
trinal intricacies or historical mo
ments of importance, because reli
gion is a real and living thing," Petrin
said. "It defines who they are; it de
fines family life, community life, the
way they view the world."
One of FRE's goals is to encour
age this type of open dialogue out
side of the program. Last year, mem
bers held a panel during Admit
Weekend to talk about religious life
on campus.They also hosted an exer
cise in the residences called "Where
are your religious edges?"

"There were a series of questions
that asked students to identify them
selves from a religious perspective,"
said Reverend Joanne Sanders. "It
gives people a chance to reveal
something about themselves in
terms of religious ideologies and un
derstandings, ranging from contem
porary issues to the traditions of
their religions."
Members describe FRE as a
space that is certainly very special —
something that has given them a
clearer view of other religions and
their own, all in a familial setting.
They anticipate emerging more
comfortable with bringing up tough
religious issues, and only hope that
others are willing to do so as well.
"We want to share with our
friends, families and religious com
munities what it's like to have direct,
honest encounters with people of
different beliefs," Walker said. "I just
want to give more recognition and
support to that."
