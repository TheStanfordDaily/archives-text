## Editorial Board Shopping for class, online 
### 
As winter quarter begins, students are
confronted, once again, with the
"shopping period."
During this period, most students are
looking for information about potentially in
teresting courses. They want to know
whether the Nobel Prize-winning professor
is also a public speaker, whether that 4:15
p.m. class is interactive enough to prevent
uncontrollable napping, or whether a $150
"required" book will just end up collecting
dust.
In a perfect world.students would be able
to attend an array of courses during this pe
riod at the beginning of each quarter. Natu
rally, classes conflict, forcing students to at
tend parts of lectures or to miss some classes
in order to test out others. After a week of as
sessing professors, weighing assignments
and crafting a workable schedule, students
could then commit to their optimal schedule
and begin the quarter.
If only this were the case. Instead, many
professors choose to start post-introductory
material on the first day of class. Attendance
thus becomes a must, and joining a class a
day or two late means immediately falling
behind. Since many humanities courses are
not recorded, students can't catch up on lec
ture material unless they happen to know a
friend in the class.
How can a student decide between two
classes that take place at the same time with
out being punished? Stanford is a liberal arts
university with an intellectually curious stu
dent body — it is unfair to penalize those
with a broad range of interests for exhibiting
those characteristics which make them out
standing students in the first place.
The faculty, though, is not to blame for at
tempting to fit in subject material at the
onset of the quarter. Many professors try to
squeeze a semester's worth of material into
10 weeks, compounding the often frenzied
pace of the quarter system. The quarter sys
tem itself is a large part of the problem. Short
of reverting back to the semester system,
there is not much wiggle room in the sched
ule to permit an honest-to-goodness shop
ping period without overloading subsequent

lectures with extra material.
Since the shopping period, like Dead
Week, stands more in name than in reality,
many students already use alternative meth
ods to learn about possible ekisses. Some
spam lists asking previously enrolled stu
dents to expound upon their experiences.
Others rely on teachers' reputations —or
even departments' reputations — to make
rough estimates.
If the possibility of a true shopping period
is unattainable, however, a few technological
tools could serve as a sufficient alternative to
skipping classes, running late to others, and
relying on word of mouth. Instead, all profes
sors could be required to post their syllabi
one week before the start of the quarter, al
lowing students to get a sense of what the
class will cover. (Stanford Syllabus [syl
labus. Stanford,
edu] was an attempt to allow students to ac
cess syllabi before classes, but not enough in
structors upload their syllabi for the system
to be effective.)The posted syllabi should in
clude the required textbooks for the course,
which could dissuade or persuade students
to take the class, and would also allow stu
dents to plan their expensive book purchas
es ahead of time.
In addition to syllabi,a previous lecture of
each course should be readily available, so
students can get an idea of a professor's
teaching style, which can often have as large
an impact on a course as the subject materi
al itself. If the course is being taught for the
first time, one of the professor's previous lec
tures could be uploaded, along with a lecture
from a similar course. Or. if the course
changed lecturers, a clip of a lecture by the
new professor along with a clip of a previous
class lecture could be uploaded. Since most
courses in the humanities are not recorded, a
University initiative would be needed in
order to gather the data. Although perhaps
costly, such assistance from the administra
tion would allow a generally improved fit be
tween students and the classes they choose.
