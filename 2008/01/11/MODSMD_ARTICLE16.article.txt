## What good has Guantanamo done? 
### 
I write this piece to all the readers of this
publication and myself as a reminder
and a point of reflection on the past six
years of lawlessness, throughout which our
fear of terrorism has become an excuse to
torture people. Men have been dragged
from their homes and families without com
mitting a single crime. They've been taken
to foreign countries and American deten
tion centers: they've been abused and de
prived of their humanity. But as six years
have passed and not enough has been done
to put an end to the lawlessness, their stories
have started to become forgotten. The sto
ries of horrifying torture techniques, death
threats and solitary confinement are all
seemingly falling on deaf ears.
Six years have passed during which our
detention centers were established on the
premise of "guilty until proven innocent,"
an obvious contradiction to the freedom.

justice and due process that America values
and preserves. Today marks the sixth an
niversary of the American Guantanamo
Bay Detention Center. Six years ago, the
first prisoner was taken to Guantanamo
Bay. Since then, nearly 800 detainees have
been held in Guantanamo Bay, and about
300 of them have not been charged with a
single crime. Only one Guantanamo de
tainee has been convicted by military com
mission and only three others have been
charged for trial by military commission.
Are we safer in our homes, now that these
"dangerous terrorists" are off the streets
and held in 6.5 x 8 ft. cells wearing the infa
mous Guantanamo three-piece suits? Are
we safer now that these men are held with
out a trial, locked up without knowing what
crime they have committed? Are we safer
now that we have violated the hon
ored Geneva conventions and the
standards of decency for the sake of
the War on Terror? And most im
portantly, are we willing to give up
our American principles and ideals
to allow for the continued existence
and operation of Guantanamo Bay?
At least four of the detainees in
Guantanamo were under the age of
18 when taken into custody. In fact,
Mohammed Ismail Agha was taken
into U.S. custody in Afghanistan at
the age of 13 before he was trans
ferred to Guantanamo Bay. Have
we become so paranoid that anyone
who visits Afghanistan regularly is a
dangerous member of al-Qaeda? Or
are we sacrificing lives and giving up
ideals for "the greater good"? To
date, there have been approximate
ly 350 incidents of self-harm in
Guantanamo Bav, and four de

tainees have committed suicide.
How long is it going to take us to re
alize that this is not the answer?
How many more have to commit
suicide? How many more families
are going to be destroyed without
legitimate reason? For how much
longer can this lawlessness contin
ue? Violence begets violence. Tor
ture is not the answer to making the
world a safer place.
After exposure to these facts, the
horrendous accounts of torture, and
the gruesome stories of hunger
strikes and suicide attempts, as an
American citizen, I cannot accept
this in my name. 1 cannot accept the
mental and physical abuse of the
Guantanamo detainees. I cannot ac
cept the disrespect, the inhumanity
and the lawlessness. Terror threats
or not, I cannot accept the existence
of Guantanamo Bay.
