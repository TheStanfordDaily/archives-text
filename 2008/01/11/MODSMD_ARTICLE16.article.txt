## What good has Guantanamo done? 
### 
I write this piece to all the readers of this
publication and myself as a reminder
and a point of reflection on the past six
years of lawlessness, throughout which our
fear of terrorism has become an excuse to
torture people. Men have been dragged
from their homes and families without com
mitting a single crime. They've been taken
to foreign countries and American deten
tion centers: they've been abused and de
prived of their humanity. But as six years
have passed and not enough has been done
to put an end to the lawlessness, their stories
have started to become forgotten. The sto
ries of horrifying torture techniques, death
threats and solitary confinement are all
seemingly falling on deaf ears.
Six years have passed during which our
detention centers were established on the
premise of "guilty until proven innocent,"
an obvious contradiction to the freedom.

justice and due process that America values
and preserves. Today marks the sixth an
niversary of the American Guantanamo
Bay Detention Center. Six years ago, the
first prisoner was taken to Guantanamo
Bay. Since then, nearly 800 detainees have
been held in Guantanamo Bay, and about
300 of them have not been charged with a
single crime. Only one Guantanamo de
tainee has been convicted by military com
mission and only three others have been
charged for trial by military commission.
Are we safer in our homes, now that these
"dangerous terrorists" are off the streets
and held in 6.5 x 8 ft. cells wearing the infa
mous Guantanamo three-piece suits? Are
we safer now that these men are held with
out a trial, locked up without knowing what
crime they have committed? Are we safer
