# Burning Down the House
## Being there 
### 
It's a shame that the lowa caucuses are so
undemocratic, because they're really
charming. What's wrong with them hard
ly needs reiteration: they're overwhelming
ly white.cater to particularistic interests and
are not organized around the democratic
principle of secret voting, so caucus-goers
are open to social pressure. On top of that,
there's good reason to he queasy about any
one, small, arbitrarily appointed and self-se
lected group of people getting so much say
over the presidential election process.
1 was in lowa City on the evening of Jan.
3, and what I saw was pure Americana. It
was Norman Rockwell's territory. Woody
Guthrie's. The caucus site I attended, in a
lecture hall on the campus of the University
of lowa, was overcrowded by the 519 enthu
siastic caucus-goers it attracted — those sin
cere Midwestern folk were thrilled to assert
themselves in the (pseudo) democratic

process. Old ladies everywhere smiled at
me. and I smiled back. A defiant granny-for-
Kucinich sat alone among the Obama sup
porters, waving a "Peace now!" bumper
sticker as if it were a flag. One 7()-something
Dodd supporter told me, unprompted, that
I, as a young person, would probably be glad
to know that she was planning to switch to
Obama in the second round. (Caucus-goers

whose candidates don't reach 15 per
cent in the first round of voting are
allowed to redistribute themselves
to viable candidates).
When the actual process began, it
remained picture-perfect. People
squabbled over the caucus proce
dure. and the rule had to be read
aloud. When some guy named Tom
rose to complain that the first round
had turned up 522 votes, out of 519
voters, the chairwoman admonished.
"Tom, 1 know where you live." Un
prepared. awkward speeches were
made about whether Obama or Ed
wards would be better for taking on
big corporations. Obama supporters
cheerily interrupted the Edwards
speech, and vice versa. All of it was
entirely lacking in irony. In fact, out
side of a New England town hall
meeting, the lowa Democratic cau
cuses have got to be the most earnest
thing in American politics.
1 suspect that's because lowans
think of themselves as having a spe
cial responsibility. Their state has
been doing this for decades. The list
of candidates plucked out from rela
tive obscurity by lowans is long:
George McGovern. Jimmy Carter,
Gary Hart. Pat Robertson, Dick
Gephardt. John Kerry and now Mike
Huckabee. These candidates at least

exceeded the expectations in lowa,
and rolled out of Des Moines with
newfound confidence. You'll note,
however, that of all of them, only
Jimmy Carter made it to the White
House, and he wasn't exactly Abra
ham Lincoln.
The thing to remember about the
early states is that they possess no in
trinsic virtue. For all that lowans talk
to each other earnestly about the
candidates and New Hampshire-ites
glare through their flinty eyes at
their quadrennial visitors, the simple
reason we care is because they get to
go first, and so they see the candi
dates up close.They must, we reason,
be able to examine every crevice of
Mike 1 luckabee's droopy neck skin,
or to check out the deal with John
McCain's left cheek. We cannot do
these things here in California. So we
wait for their prompting.
But what do they learn, looking
so close? What's the political value
of being there in person? There's a
good reason, 1 know, for making the
candidates start out in a smaller
arena — it gives the underdogs a
chance. But, when we look too close
ly at a candidate, we lose perspective
— Hillary's tears, Edwards' haircut
and Huckabee's dangling skin seem
to matter.
Yet this is the logic by which the
whole process works. It's why politi
cal journalism is so relentlessly infu
riating. Listen to the journalists:
They've followed the candidates
around for months,through the lowa

summer and the New Hampshire
winter.They Are There. Listen to the
man-on-the-street interview. He's
met all the candidates, asked them
where they stand on his pet issues.
He Is There.
When my friends found out I had
been there, too, in lowa, actually at a
caucus, they asked me to analyze the
results. What did it mean for Clin
ton's campaign? Why was Edwards
soldiering on? 1 played along, as if 1
had answers. After all. why else
would I have gone to Iowa?
The night ended with a perfect
metaphor: In a lecture hall at the
University of lowa, my phone got no
service. By the time 9:30 rolled
around and the precinct had given
six delegates to Obama and three to
Edwards, the rest of the state had de
cided. 1 had to call a friend in New
Jersey to tell me what had happened.

Gabe's pretty sure there's a pun he
could make about the movie I'm Not
There, "but it escapes him. If you think
of it, let him know at gwinantQstan
