# STUDENT LIFE
## Class looks at healthy dining HumBio 10SI focuses on practical nutrition 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Whether they dine at Wilbur, Late
Nite or the Axe & Palm, students who
want to make healthy eating choices
this quarter can sign up for a new, stu
dent-initiated course.
Humßio 10SI"Practical Nutrition
at Stanford" is an introduction to
general nutrition with a focus on eat
ing healthy meals at Stanford dining
locations.
The course is the brainchild of
Lindsey Merrihew '08, who said her
course would draw on what she's
learned in other human biology class
es.
"I'm condensing some of my fa
vorite nutrition classes at Stanford,"
she said. "At the end of each class,
we'll discuss how what we've just
learned applies to dining at Stan
ford."
Merrihew said students will be
keeping track of their dining experi
ences throughout the quarter, and
they will have the opportunity to
meet with Stanford Dining represen
tatives at the end of the class.
Associate Director of Student
Dining Karen Andrews said that
Stanford Dining's quality-assurance
chef and its dietitian will attend that
class meeting as well.
"We were excited by the opportu
nity to participate," Andrews wrote
in an email to The Daily.

Humßio 10SI will also have guest
lecturers speak about recognizing
good and bad fats, picking effective
fuel for the body and avoiding eating
disorders. Students will discuss
Michael Pollan's book "In Defense
of Food" and give presentations
about nutritional myths in the media.
Merrihew explained that she has
a longstanding interest in food and
nutrition, and she became an unoffi
cial nutritionist to friends in her bal
let company and crew team. Human
Nutrition is her area of concentra
tion within the Human Biology
major, and she explained that lead

ing a student-initiated course is a
way to share what she has learned
over the years.
"When people think of nutrition,
they think of obsessively counting
calories or just being preoccupied
about everything they eat," Merri
hew said. "1 wanted to offer a health
ier perspective."
"Practical Nutrition at Stanford"
is offered on Wednesdays, from 7:15
to 8:30 p.m. in 200-202: space is still
available in the class.
