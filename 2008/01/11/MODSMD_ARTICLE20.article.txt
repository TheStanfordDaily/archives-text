## Time for contemplation 
### 
I visited a Cistercian monastery, in Vina,
C'alif., this past summer. 1 was writing a
story both on their strict monastic life and,
rather amusingly and surprisingly, their bur
geoning winery business.
During an interview with one of the priests,
I asked him for something the average Joe
could take away from the monastic way of life
(without praying seven times a day. vowing to
a life of poverty, or committing to celibacy).
He told me he thought that reflection was
paramount. Silence and solitude, which are
important aspects of the monastery's specific
contemplative order, are worth a lot in every
day life, he said. Even just turning off the radio
when you are driving, he suggested, is a good
way to be alone with your thoughts.
I couldn't think of a time when the radio in
my car had ever been off.
My talk with the priest on the importance
of thinking got me thinking, contemplating,
even. As the end of 2007 morphs into the
sparkling hopefulness of 2008. and as this is
my last column, it seemed a pertinent moment
to ruminate and reflect on the past year — or
last few years, really, since so much of my life
has been bereft of active reflecting.
First, I've learned a lot about biking. Save
yourself a two-inch stripe of wet mud on your
back and get a rear-wheel tire fender. Get

your brakes checked, friggin' yield and don't
make hard turns over a pile of wet leaves.
I've also learned that saying 'hi' and saying
'sorry' are worth a lot. The duck and cover. I
hope-they-didn't-see-me act always ends in
them calling you out on it, or just postponing
the run-in for a later, worse-timed meeting.
Also, a sincere apology is sometimes all I want,
or all I can give. Not an 'OMG, I am sooooo
sorry"; just a plain ol' from the heart 'sorry.'
I've learned a lot about saying'no' and say
ing 'yes.' Saying yes leads to adventures, new
friends, things you never thought could hap
pen. Saying no. however, is what mature,
grown-up people do when they know what
their priorities are, who they are, and what
they actually want. The hardest part of all,
however, is picking between the two.
I've learned that superglue doesn't work
on fabric, that flossing is even better for you
than brushing, and that shots take a while to

kick in. so hold your horses and wait before
you go for the next round.
1 think I've learned that the world is gener
ally a judgmental place. My improv TA once
told me life is 10 percent what you say, 20 how
you say it and 70 percent how you look. Call
me a cynic, hut 1 have only found it to be true.
With close friends, I've learned again and
again that down-home, for-reals honesty real
ly is the best policy. Even the smallest twists of
truth only lead to awkward confrontations or
out-of-control webs of future tiny dishon
esties.
I've learned that even though we all have
to whine from time to time, complaining is
wearisome to listen to and doesn't really ac
complish much of anything.
I've learned to appreciate the proximity of
Stanford. Mirrielees to Narnia really isn't that
far. People drive half an hour, or even an hour,
to work every day. Friends will soon be on the
other side of the country, or the world, not to
mention significant others and family.The five
minute bike-ride — albeit sometimes made in
the rain and the cold — is a luxury of campus
closeness.
I've learned that I generally worry too
much about what other people are thinking.
