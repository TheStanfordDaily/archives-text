## Unelectable 
### 
Google has 80,N(X) hits for "Obama is
too." 1 les described as too young, too
inexperienced, too naive, too idealistic,
too optimistic, too practical, too boring, too
pious, too liberal and too conservative. There
are 62,(XH) hits for "Obama is unelectable."
Hillary, on the other hand, is also unelec
table. So are Edwards, Kucinich and Gravel,
for that matter. Add to the "unelectable" list
McCain, Guliani. Romney, Huckabee.Thomp
son and the whole of the Republican Party in
general.
There is a clear problem here: too many
pundits, not enough substance. Every major
candidate has at one point or another been
called "unelectable." And clearly, at least one
of them will be elected.
The Internet may allow greater access to
the opinions of political experts, but much,
much more than that, it allows larger numbers
of presumptuous idiots have their own soap
boxes ... and any kind of informed political en
vironment is thus suffering. In a grown-up ver
sion of the old "My dad could beat up your
dad" argument from the schoolyard, thou
sands of blog owners have taken to making
vague, unsubstantiated claims about the stu
pidity of the opposition candidate, all in the au
thoritative voice of an overconfident eight

year old.
It is the sheer smug overconfidence of these
blogs that tips me off to the fact that they must
he wrong. In the interest of an ego stroke, or
possibly to increase their visitor count, blog
owners the world over have redefined stan
dard political commentary. Nuance has given
way to fuzzy, meaningless name calling, and
with the media now paying so much attention
to these hlogs, it has polluted our TV screens
and newspapers as well.
Just because you can turn a phrase doesn't
mean your criticism will hold any importance,
or even mean anything. We have had hundreds
of phrases crammed down our throats in this
election â€” Obama is "green behind the ears,"
Clinton is "too cold," Edwards is "thin
skinned." To what extent are any of these de
scriptors really relevant?

Who actually knows what kind of experi
ence is necessary to become president? As far
as I know, none of these candidates has ever
been president before and thus lacks the nec
essary presidential experience in a very literal
sense. Who actually cares if our president is
cold if he. or Hillary, has the credentials? And
what does "thin-skinned" even mean, in the
context of an elected leader?
Furthermore, can any of these criticisms
hold sway in today's complex political ma
chine? Most of a president's decisions are made
by people either outside of the White House
(think tanks) or by those on Capitol Hill (lob
byists and the president's own advisors).
1 can only hope for the sake of our democ
racy that the Stephen Colbert approach does
not prevail in our political discourse. In an ap
pearance on the No Spin Zone with Bill
O'Reilly, Colbert once said, still in character,
"They criticize what you say but they never
give you credit for how loudly you say it." If
these obnoxious and extreme commentators
(who actually bear a striking resemblance to
Mr. Colbert's stage identity) arc allowed to fur
ther propagate their exaggerated sound bites,
we will have an election that will be won on
two to three words.
I can only hope that the average voter has
more discretion than to take everything these


Nat
Hillard
full-time chatterboxes say for grant
ed. They are, after all. paid to spew
opinion, fill a time slot, or meet the
word count of a blog. whether their
analysis is well-reasoned or not.
Of course, political commentary
has a place in our democracy. We
need experts, and their opinions, for
the sake of informed discussion. But
not these kinds of commentators. The
more idiots who go around trumpet
ing "unelectable" like it's some sort of
battle cry, the less we will pay atten
tion to the facts.The more talk of how
your candidate can beat up my candi
date in a fight, the less able we are to
understand the complex political sit
uation of our country.
As I see it. in this race, only one
candidate is unelectable, and that's
Bill Richardson. And that's because
he dropped out yesterday.

Nat Hillard is himself unelectable, but
send him an email anyways, at
nat.hilhmMstanford.edu.
