## CARD REBOUNDS Women cruise past Beavers, 81-45 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
A revitalized Stanford women's basketball team
took the floor last night, trouncing Oregon State, 81-
45. ITie No. 7 Cardinal (13-3) improved to 3-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, bearing no resemblance to the
team that struggled from every corner of the gym just
last week in Los Angeles.
In fact, for much of the contest, the players were
not even the same. Coach Tara VanDerveer reached
deep into the bench during the match-up with the
Beavers (8-7, 1-3

Pac-10), eliciting
Stanford's re
demption from un
likely sources.
Among the nine
scorers for the
Cardinal was
freshman forward
Ashley Cimino,
who played her
first 13 collegiate
minutes. She
scored four points.
VanDerveer
was pleased that
OSU's visit al
lowed so many
players extra time
on the floor.
"We play a
tough schedule,
and it's really im
portant for our
players that don't
play as much to get
valuable game ex
perience," she
said. "I think they
did tonight."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is now 13-3 on the
year and 3-2 in the Pac-10. Center Jayne
Appel had 25 points, a new career high for
the sophomore. Freshman forward Ashley
Cimino got her first collegiate on Thursday,
scoring four points in 13 minutes of action.

Perhaps more valuable, though, was the break it
gave senior guard Candice Wiggins. Wiggins scored
only four points in 14 minutes, her lowest point total
since a road game against the Beavers on Feb. 15,
2007.
"What's nice for us is to be able to rest Candice, so
that in some of the games that we need her to play 40
minutes she'll be able to," VanDerveer said.
I"he usual starters were by no means forgotten:
sophomore center Jayne Appel missed only one shot
all night, and was far and away the game's leading
scorer with 25 points.
"1 don't think (Appel had] a career high [points
total], but it might be her highest percentage." Van-
Derveer said. "Jayne finished really well, and that was
the name of the game: get it to Jayne."
Appel said her added motivation was rooted in last
weekend's results. After missing a free throw that al
lowed USC to take the lead with eight seconds to go,
Appel felt especially responsible for the one-point
loss to the Trojans.
"I took the [loss to USC] personally, so 1 knew I
definitely needed to get it going out here," she said.
VanDerveer believed that the improved perform
ance by the team was far from perfect, however. While

After two shocking losses to UCLA and USC last weekend, Stanford had no trouble in disposing of Oregon State
yesterday. The team looks to improve on its 13-3 record when it faces Oregon tomorrow at Maples Pavilion.
