## Getting over the Hill 
### BY PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
MMost players do not like to talk
about slumps. Wary of distractions,
had press or bad luck, they often
offer the usual platitudes or even
deny that anything is amiss.
Not Lawrence Hill.
The junior forward sat down with reporters
Tuesday and offered a candid appraisal of his sea
son so far. Asked to describe his season. Hill said.
"Bittersweet."
"It's hard to complain about anything when
you're 12-2." he said. "But seeing what I'm able to
do in practice but not in games is bothering me."
The 6-8. 215-pound big man returned for his
third season at the Farm with high hopes. As the
team's leading scorer last season (15.7 points per
game), his No. 15 jersey hangs on the racks in the
Stanford Bookstore. He also tied for the team lead
last season with six rebounds per game, and his
strong shooting percentages (50.9 percent from the
field, 41 percent 3-point) helped vault him to All
Pac-10 recognition.
ITiis year, things are different.
The scoring numbers are down (9.3 points per
game, 42 percnt from the field and 27 percent from
behind the arc) but, as Hill said, it's more than that.
The game feels different now.
As last-year's leading scorer. Hill has been the
focus of many teams' scouting reports and defen
sive attention. He can feel that. too.
"Teams game-plan against me," Hill said. "1
know that now and I feel it in the games, but I'm still
getting the opportunity to do well."
Stanford coach Trent Johnson agreed. The op
portunities are still there, he said.
"There's more attention paid to him, but he's
getting the same shots that he had last year," John
son said."And it's just like I talked to him yesterday,
as long as you're not pressing, as long as you're not
worrying, I don't want you to turn down shots."
Hill admits he has been turning down shots at
times, in an effort to stay in rhythm, or as he says "in
game mode."
"I've never taken a shot I felt couldn't go in," he
said. "I actually hold back.There are lots of shots 1
don't take that I want to."
Part of the problem. Hill said, is his inability to
create outside the system. While teammates Antho
ny Goods and Fred Washington will drive to the
hoop or step up their defense when shots aren't
falling. Hill struggles to contribute when his jumper
is off.
"It's something I can do in spurts but I never fo
cused on that," he said of his teammates' propensi
ty for playmaking.'Tve always been more of a pass-
first guy. But 1 need to put that into
my game. Creating my shot is some
thing 1 can do. hut creating a play
that can lead to a good shot or a pass
is something 1 need to work on."

"Teams game
plan against
me...1 know that
now and I feel it
in the games."

One aspect of Hill's game that has
been consistent with last year is re
hounding. He's third on the team, av
eraging six boards per game, and is
coming off a season-high 13-re
bound effort against USC Saturday,
a game in which he got off to a hot
start.
With Fred Washington in the
starting lineup for defensive purpos
es, Hill came off the bench for the

first time all season but led the Car
dinal with seven points and seven re
bounds in the first half against the
Trojans.
"Then the Lawrence of this year
showed up," Hill said.
He missed all five of his shots in
the second period and did not score
again.
"That's what the difference is
from last year," Hill said. "I would
have hit those shots. Eighty percent
of my shots in that game were wide
open: 1 need to take those."
He's turned to Johnson for ad
vice, and he said he and his coach
have discussed things such as shying
away from contact and not forcing
the shot. Johnson, for his part,said he
is not worried about his forward.
"Lawrence has a tendency where
you can read when things are bother
ing him," Johnson said. "He hasn't
shown any of those tendencies. And
a lot of that is, 'Why should he?'
We've been getting contributions
from everybody."
It's hard to argue with the Cardi
nal's success so far. But Hill knows
that with a tough Pac-10 schedule, he
doesn't have much time to turn
things around.
It won't be long, he said.
"I just haven't flipped the switch
yet this year," Hill said.'T think it will
be better soon because I'm working
harder on being more aggressive."
