GAME NOTES: Stanford is 2-0 on the year despite
losing to the University of Alberta in the finals of the
UCSB/Elephant Bar Tournament - the loss did no*
count as it came against a non-Division I school.
The Cardinal is ranked No. 8 in the country, the
team's best ranking in years. Stanford will face off
for the second time this season against defending
national champion, UC Irvine, on Saturday.

Williams, along with sophomore middle blocker Garrett Werner,

McLachlin is starting at outside hitter and. in the words of head
coach John Kosty,"has already made an impact on the team."
"Spencer is a very good volleyball player and athlete " Kosty
added. "He has shown his ability to compete at the collegiate level
in a relatively short amount of time."

ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Fresh off an upset of last year's national champion, UC Irvine, Stanford volleyball looks to start the MPSF conference schedule on the right foot this weekend.
Muagututia and junior Jamie
Diefenbach led the Bruins in cumu
lative kills and blocks, respectively,
and were named to the All-Tourna
ment Team.
As for UC'-lrvine, the Anteaters
had a rough start to the season,
falling most recently to No. 7 Long
Beach State in a sweep last Saturday.
On Saturday, Stanford and UCI
will meet for the second time this
year.The first resulted in a surprising
Stanford victory — the Cardinal
came out on top in five games: 30-21,
30-28,28-30,28-30,15-10.
"Matt Ceran had a really solid
match against Irvine," Kosty said.
"As a team, we served the ball well
and generated a lot of scoring oppor
tunities."
The key to this weekend's match
es is consistency, Kosty added.
"We've got to play at a consistently
high level throughout everv match.

That's something we're going to con
centrate on because we're still a
young team — at least half the
starters are freshmen or sopho
mores."
'Hie vast majority of the Cardinal
team are indeed underclassmen, but
some of this year's sophomores have
extensive game experience rivaling
that of their upperclassmen counter
parts.
Sophomore setter Kawika Shoji.
Romero and Werner all saw a lot of
game time in their freshman year,
and it seems as though that time is
paying off.
"We have an opportunity to cre
ate a winning season, something that
we haven't been able to do in this
program for a while," Kosty said.
"We just have to play well. We're
playing in one of the most competi
tive leagues in the nation: of 12
teams, 10. including UCLA and
UCI, are ranked. If we want to be
successful, we have to just play well
everv ninht."
