# No. 2 tennis gears for trip to Las Vegas
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Today, the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis team heads to the Las Vegas desert for
the sixth annual Freeman Memorial
Women's Tennis Championships, one of
the final tournaments of the individual
season.
Despite a flurry of injuries in the fall
season and the loss of their No. 1 and 2
players from last year, the Cardinal
women come into this weekend's tourna
ment as the second-ranked team in the na
tion.
Interestingly enough, the rankings ad
ministered by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association came as a shock to head
coach Lele Forood.
"Quite frankly, 1 think we're ranked
too high right now," Forood said. "There's
still a little too much disconnect between
the team and individual rankings. We're
ranked ahead of teams with four to five
players in the top 50 of the individuals
right now and there's no excuse for that."
Stanford is currently ranked behind
defending national champions Georgia
Tech. who received 25 of the 26 first place
votes. No. 3 UCLA garnered the remain
ing ballot, followed by No. 4 University of
Florida and No. 5 University of Georgia.
"The teams to beat are Georgia Tech
and UCLA, who got to the finals and lost
nobody in their lineup from last year, and
I certainly don't see us ahead of either one
as we start the season," Forood said.
But, within a month, the National Team
Indoors will reveal the teams who are
truly at the top.
"In a month's time, we're going to meet

GAME NOTES: Stanford comes into the Freeman Champi
onships ranked No. 2 in the country, behind defending
national champion Georgia Tech. Three members of the
team are currently ranked in singles: junior Jessica
Nguyen (No. 21), sophomore Lindsay Burdette (No. 39)
and freshman Carolyn McVeigh (No. 58). The Cardinal
will start team competition at the end of the month when it
takes on UC Davis in the season opener.

in Madison, Wise, with just about every
body who factors into the top 15 and the
winner will be the number one team ,"
Forood said. "At that point in the middle
of February, the rankings will be accurate
because they will be based on that tourna
ment where everybody plays everybody.
"Not until that point will there be any
true rankings."
In the singles rankings, Stanford was
represented by junior Jessica Nguyen at
21st. She was followed by sophomore
Lindsay Burdette (No. 39) and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh (No. 58).
However, none of the Stanford dou
bles duos cracked the top-5() mark in the
poll.
"It's totally surprising," Forood said.
"But you know, we're still figuring out our
team. We haven't played people together
probably enough to get the results to get
ranked, so this is a chance to try some
other teams and we're going to evaluate

where we're at based on how these
teams work out."
Still, Forood has complete confi
dence in her squad.
"We'll be fine," Forood added.
"We have a really good lineup of
players, but like 1 said, nothing means
anything until the Indoors in a
month."
This weekend, the Cardinal
women will get the chance to earn
their lofty ranking at the highly com
petitive Freeman Championships.
The Championships will feature
elite programs from across the na
tion including top-ranked Georgia
Tech, No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 Florida, No.
8 Southern California. No. 12 North
Carolina, No. l l > Arizona State and
No. 45 Oregon.
At least 13 ranked individuals are
slated to play, nine of which fall in the
top-50 rankings. Leading the way is
No. 7 Kristi Miller of Georgia Tech in
the singles bracket.
Representing Stanford in the sin
gles bracket are seniors Whitney
Deason, Lejla Hodzic and Celia
Durkin. Nguyen and freshmen Jen
nifer Yen and Hilary Barte will also
compete in the singles.
Hie Card will also send three dou

bles teams: the combos of Barte and
Durkin, Deason and Nguyen and
Yen and I iodzic.
"There might be some more
schools from back east coming, so it's
really a good mix of teams and con
ferences," Forood said."lt gives us a
chance to see who some of the new of
people are for some of the schools
that we won't see on our schedules."
Fortunately, Stanford has shown a
penchant for playing in the desert
especially Durkin, who took home
the title two seasons ago.
"We have played very well in Las
Vegas over the years," Forood said.
"Celia hasn't had a chance to play as
much during the fall and I'm hoping
that this is a good chance for her at a
tournament she's had success with in
the past to basically get her season on
track."
Last year, however, freezing
weather conditions halted play after
the first round, leaving the tourna
ment without a champion.
At the end of the month. Stanford
will begin team competition against
UC-Davis. But for now, the Cardinal
women are set on finishing their indi
vidual season strong in the desert.
"We have a lot of people going
who have had good memories at this
tournament in the past and hopeful
ly that'll help them."
