### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Today, the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis team heads to the Las Vegas desert for
the sixth annual Freeman Memorial
Women's Tennis Championships, one of
the final tournaments of the individual
season.
Despite a flurry of injuries in the fall
season and the loss of their No. 1 and 2
players from last year, the Cardinal
women come into this weekend's tourna

Interestingly enough, the rankings ad
ministered by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association came as a shock to head
coach Lele Forood.
"Quite frankly, 1 think we're ranked
too high right now," Forood said. "There's
still a little too much disconnect between
the team and individual rankings. We're
ranked ahead of teams with four to five
players in the top 50 of the individuals
right now and there's no excuse for that."
Stanford is currently ranked behind
defending national champions Georgia
Tech. who received 25 of the 26 first place
votes. No. 3 UCLA garnered the remain
ing ballot, followed by No. 4 University of
Florida and No. 5 University of Georgia.
"The teams to beat are Georgia Tech
and UCLA, who got to the finals and lost
nobody in their lineup from last year, and
I certainly don't see us ahead of either one
as we start the season," Forood said.

Indoors will reveal the teams who are
truly at the top.
"In a month's time, we're going to meet

in Madison, Wise, with just about every
body who factors into the top 15 and the
winner will be the number one team ,"
Forood said. "At that point in the middle
of February, the rankings will be accurate
because they will be based on that tourna
ment where everybody plays everybody.
"Not until that point will there be any
true rankings."
In the singles rankings, Stanford was
represented by junior Jessica Nguyen at
21st. She was followed by sophomore
Lindsay Burdette (No. 39) and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh (No. 58).
However, none of the Stanford dou
bles duos cracked the top-5() mark in the
poll.
"It's totally surprising," Forood said.
"But you know, we're still figuring out our
team. We haven't played people together
