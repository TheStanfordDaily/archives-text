## Stem-cell funding expands $200,000 supplied to further research efforts 
### MICHAEL DING STAFF WRITER 
Ethical questions surrounding
stem cell research might still be a hot
topic of debate across the country
and in Washington, but with a recent
grant of $200,000 to the Stanford In
stitute for Stem Cell Biology and Re
generative Medicine, the Universi
ty's stance on the issue is clear.
"The Department of Medicine
[which supplied the grant] usually
doesn't do this," said Associate Pro
fessor of Medicine Judith Shizuru,
who heads one of the four labs in the
institute that will receive the funding.
"It's really a very strong sort of com
ment on the institution's commit
ment to this field of stem cell biology
and the development of therapies
that can be derived from stem cells."
Shizuru said that the funds would
mainly serve as a platform to achieve
a much larger grant from the Califor
nia Institute for Regenerative Medi
cine (C'IRM).
"The CIRM put out a request for
applications to apply for a bigger
grant, which will go in the summer of
2008."she said."But when you're try
ing to get a team of people together,
you need resources and money to get
your infrastructure together. In my
case, we would use the money from
the Department of Medicine for pre
liminury data."
Stanford's stem cell research in
stitute has already received $41 mil
lion in funding from CIRM, more
than any other institute. Most of the
previous support has gone toward
funding new approaches to stem cell
diagnosis and treatment, emphasiz
ing stem cell biology. Some of the
funding has even gone into investi

gator awards and facility grants.
But Shizuru said that the new
grant, which could be as large as $20
million, explicitly seeks to fund stud
ies leading toward clinical trials.
•'The new money is specifically
for projects that the CIRM would
like to see, where there's a team of
individuals working specifically to
develop a clinical study that will he
performed in the next two to four
years," she said.
Shizuru herself would use the
CIRM funding to study transplanta
tion of pure hematopoietic stem cells
for treatment of the autoimmune

disease known as scleroderma. Stan
ford will be competing with many
other California stem cell research
institutions, including those in the
University of California system, for
the grant.
Other sources of funding for the
University include the National In
stitutes of Health, as well as smaller,
more disease-specific groups, such as
the Leukemia and Lymphoma Soci
ety, the American Cancer Society
and the Diabetes Foundation.
