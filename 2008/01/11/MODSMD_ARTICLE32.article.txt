## Resolutions for Realists 
### ELIZABETH FOX INTERMISSION STAFF SHOOTER 
The New Year is about new beginnings. It's
about making changes, about becoming the
best you that you can be, about improving
yourself, your quality of life, your contribu
tions to society, etc., etc. And it is with all this in
mind that we partake in the hallmark New
Year's activity (and no, it's not getting drunk
and making out at midnight on New Year's
Eve): we make resolutions.
Rarely, if ever, do we keep them. After all,
how can we? If one change is all that it takes to
turn us into a cross between Mother Theresa
and Catherine Zeta Jones, it must be one virtu
ally impossible whopper of a change. But with
a 365-day blank slate staring us in the face, why
not try?
Here at Intermission, we support that kind
of optimism. To you readers we say, "Go forth
and resolve! Make the world a better place,
safer for humans, animals and the weird kid
down the hall who's currently afraid to venture
out of his room."
In fact, in keeping with our own resolution
to be wiser and more benevolent than we al
ready are, we're going to support you in your
venture. What follows is a list of common reso
lutions, along with easy tips and tricks the aver
age college student can employ to fulfill them.
No need to thank us. We already know we're
benevolent.
Exercise more. Be realistic — if you haven't

been to the gym in three
years, are you really going to
start going now? Do you even

know where it is? Instead of
trying to figure it out. just leave
for class five minutes late and
sprint to get there. Better yet, weai

so that everyone thinks you work out.
They'll be too busy sprinting to their
own classes to ask questions.

Quit drinking. This one's actually surprising
ly easy: quit your fraternity. If that doesn't
work, throw out your fake ID, your beer bong
and your shot glasses (unless you choose to use
them as very small flower vases). And if that
still doesn't work, well, try taking a semester off
to join a monastic order in the tundra. At the
very least, it will be something different on
your resume.
jle on time. Setting your watch five minutes
ahead is so yesteryear. Instead, pick classes
that all meet in the same room and move in at
beginning of the quarter (also a good
money saver on the housing front). If you're al
ways there, you're never late, "right? Those
without sleeping bags and hot plates, however,
might run into some trouble. In that case, just
reset everyone else's watches to five minutes
behind.
Lose weight. Let's face it: you gained some
weight at college. They don't call it the Fresh
man Fifteen for nothing. Toddling between
classes while downing calorie-laden pizza and

frappuccinos
is pretty much stan-

dard. But anyone who tells you to move more
and eat less clearly hasn't been to college in a
while. Instead of following his advice, why not
try something a little more tailored to your sit
uation? The dining-hall-only method, for ex
ample, allows you to eat all three squares in one
place. After a few weeks of only Mexican (or
Asian, or Italian) cuisine, you'll be ready to
commit seppuku rather than eat yet another
quesadilla (or dumpling or noodle). Alternate
ly, you could find sustenance only at on-cam
pus eateries and enjoy a forced diet when you
run out of motley (estimated time: five days).
Quit procrastinating. Cut yourself a break.
The fact that you made this resolution by Jan. 1
is already a leap in the right direction. The
super ambitious might try working ahead or
creating a homework schedule, but really, you
have a whole year to figure it all out. What's the
rush?
Get more sleep. Only take lecture classes —
they care about napping in seminars.

Save
money.

Quit school and
save $40,000 right off the
bat. If that's too extreme, save on housing by
pulling an Azia Kim and squatting. Those who
want to save money by making money might
try selling course readers at $20 dollars per
page, thereby undercutting the book store's
price. And of course, you can always "borrow"
your roommate's snacks and toiletries and rent
out her bed when she's away.
Be kinder to others. Dismantle your water
balloon launcher and stop telling tour groups
to "get out while they still can." Also, stop
"borrowing" your roommate's snacks and toi
letries and renting out her bed when she's
away.
