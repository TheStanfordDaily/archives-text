## Get over your guilt 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION GUILTY PLEASURER 
There are things that everyone enjoys that no one wants to discuss, those guilty pleasures
that we all indulge in from time to time. Whether they are guilty pleasures because they are
Q just so childish that you question your maturity, because they have zero intellectual value, or
because you know that they will embarrass your children, it is time to embrace them. There
| are cultural guilty pleasures in which evervone partakes, those moments when

gj something so obviously humorous and embarrassing becomes a craze or

trend. The world is full of gudty pleasures;
d here is a review of some of 2007's most inter-
esting and well-known indulgences.
1. Soulja Boy "Crank that Soulja Boy"

| The lyrics seem to have been words strung togeth-
j er after being pulled out of a hat, and, upon research, so

inappropriate that you can never discuss them with your
u parents or even think about them yourself without disgust (1 <
" suggest everyone look up "Superman" on

d Urbandictionary.com). The dance is essentially a ghetto Irish jig,
I t * e 4.L -A • a. ii • c

~ which results in a performance that is the most embarrassing footage
you will have from your college years. Yet every highly intellectual-

ized, future professional Stanford student was running around fall quarter singing and per
forming the dance. One frat even had every member learn the entire dance for a perfor
mance at special dinner.
2. Stalking Britney Spears
The pictures of Britney Spears's shaved head were everywhere, and no one could look
away. Deep down everyone knew that the scrutiny was making her, if anything, more insane,
and yet no one could stop talking about, analyzing and judging the poor girl. And then there
was the fan video, all over Youtube and in a shining moment of journalism on the morning
news, with a rather androgous boy screaming into the camera that we all need to leave Brit
ney alone. His video actually had the opposite effect of making it just a little bit more amus
ing to make fun of her. As her condition progressed, it became abundantly clear that there
was no hope for her and that maybe she needed a vacation. Or to retire. But no one was going
to let her. There is such a sweet perverse pleasure in watching this former teen idol destroy
herself.
3. "America's Next Top Model"
Every season an über-educated girl is kicked off, generally for being too composed, which
the judges paint as arrogance. This season was no exception: Victoria from Yale was kicked
off for arguing with Twiggy (and her inability to understand why she should "be a cactus").
This is a show that laughs in the face of intellectualism, and yet it Is widely popular with Stan
ford students. It is also a show with high drama, controversy and the occasional bulimia ac
cusation. It is a modeling show where the girl with the best picture probably won't win be
cause she lacks "personality" and the girl who does win is rarely capable of intelligent insight.
And yet it must be watched.
4. The Movie "300"

Freshmen from the class of 2010 could take Ancient Empires, an
IHUM class that somehow managed to get the school to pay for

tickets to a movie that had no historical insight whatsoever. The
fight scenes are cool, the movie itself was visually incredible, but
the dialogue and the portrayal of gender roles and other ethnici-

ties was farfetched. The government of Iran even protested

the film on the grounds that it was racist propaganda.
However, none of these things stopped Stanford stu
dents from quoting the movie, Roble hall from using it
as its theme or my engineering friends from proclaiming

that the movie had "the best sex scene ever." It is one of
those movies that I'm pretty sure the next generation will use
kfor mystery science theater, but I personally have seen it
112 twice.

I Revel in the absurdity of these fine pop culture moments
of 2007. be guilt-free and look forward to Britney Spears's
probable total meltdown in '08.
