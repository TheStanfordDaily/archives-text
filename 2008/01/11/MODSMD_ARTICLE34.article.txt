### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION CUMIN GUZZLER 
Clearly, in recorded history, nobody has ever broken their New Year's resolution to work
out more. And since we'll all be exercising more this year, it's only fair to slip in a few extra
decadent meals to greet 2008. One excellent venue for such indulgence is downtown Moun
tain View's Amber, which is perennially considered to be among the best Indian restaurants
in the Bay Area.
Amber offers a full menu of traditional Indian fare including curries, vegetables and spe
cialties from the Tandoori oven. With prices that are moderate for good Indian food, a meal
at Amber might be a little excessive for any old night, but it's reasonable for when you're
looking to step up from the ordinary.
The signature item on the menu at Amber is the butter chicken, a creamy tomato-based
curry with boneless pieces of tandoori chicken. It is nearly indistinguishable from their chick
en tikka masala but is delicious nevertheless with its rich and moderately spicy flavor.
Perhaps the best value is the $27 prixe fixe dinner menu, which includes a salad, a curry,
two tandoori selections, a vegetable dish, rice, naan bread and dessert. It is easily too much
for one person and could probably feed two, especially with another appetizer as a supple
ment.
The only truly weak part of the menu is the included green salad, which could not have
been more ordinary. It is perfectly edible, but would never be worth ordering a la carte. But
face it, nobody is going to Amber for the salad, and it all gets better from there. The tandoori
chicken, which at many other restaurants is dry, burnt and tasteless, turned out to be tender
and flavorful, while the lamb in the seekh kebab was full of sophisticated seasoning without
being unnecessarily spicy.
The curry included on the menu was chicken do pyaza, which landed on the spectrum
somewhere between a chicken tikka masala and korma, being a little less creamy than the
former with a hint of nutty taste from the latter. Overall, the flavor could have been a little
stronger, but it was still a solid curry. Palak paneer, spinach with Indian cheese, was the veg
etable. Amber's recipe tasted more like spinach and less like cream than at some other
places, which perhaps made it more natural, but less decadent. The menu also included sub
tly spiced saffron rice and naan that was served fresher and less greasy than is frequently the
case.
As if that weren't enough food, the Amber Dinner concludes with dessert and a choice of
coffee or tea. The dessert was a small order of gulab jamun, a spiced cheese fritter served in
a honey-based sauce. It is a somewhat strange dessert for an American palette because it is
not particularly sweet, but Amber pulls it off just as well as anyone else. Finally, the chai tea
was surprisingly tasty considering it wasn't a cup of sugar, as would be the case at Starbucks.
Amber's service seemed inconsistent at times, with some servers who were on their game
and others varying between confused and aloof. Sometimes it wasn't clear who was supposed
to do what, but in the end, they got the job done relatively smoothly. The space has a decid
edly traditional Indian design, which gives the restaurant an authentic feel without making it
seem as if you've been transported to another continent.
It should also be noted that Amber has two other locations. The newer sister restaurant,
located on Santana Row in San Jose, features a much more modern but still classy interior
providing for a more trendy atmosphere. The menu is a hit more creative than the tradition
al side, but the food quality is comparable. But make sure to steer clear of the less expensive
Amber Cafe, which serves shamelessly Americanized bastardizations of Indian fare in an en
vironment which, with minor improvements, would be comparable to a poorly maintained
McDonald's. But aside from the Cafe, Amber provides a moderately priced meal of true
decadence that will awaken all of your taste buds.
