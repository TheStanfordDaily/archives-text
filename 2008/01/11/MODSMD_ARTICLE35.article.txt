### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION TEFLON DOM 
We are all human — which is to say, we all make mistakes. This is why there is
such a thing as Mitch Album, or a hairstyle entitled the "fauxhawk." We acknowl
edge that these things are detrimental to us as a species, that they are sources of
mockery among the lower animals, that if it weren't for their debilitating lack of op
posable thumbs, tree frogs would long ago have usurped our position at the top of
the food chain, and yet we can't, we acknowledge, simply tHrow the baby out with
the fauxhawk. We love that baby too much to abandon it merely due to a poor choice
of hairstyle. The solution, then, is to shave the baby.
These are some of our favorite babies to shave — wrongdoers that, no matter how
much we want to hale them, somehow manage to stay in our good graces. They are
made of Teflon, smiles and Mom's apple pie, all piled on top of a dead hooker buried
just outside Truckee, and we obviously fcan't get enough.
