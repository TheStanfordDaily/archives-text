# Exercise more than just your mind
## 
### CHELSEY LITTLE INTERMISSION JANE FONDA 
So I know we all told ourselves that we were going to really try to
stick with that work-out schedule we set for ourselves, in an I'lTurt to
expel the fat that collects on our tuchuses as we sit lazily about and
cram our brains with the wide array of imperious texts we aTe forced
to consume for our pontificated classes; however, this just isn't going
to happen. We all know it, but the hard thing, as usual for Stanford
students, is to accept this fact. As much as we'd like to be, we're just
not Spiderman, you know? Nevertheless, many of us will try any
ways. And to help you along with this vain attempt, here are eight
more amusing physical activities you might want to partake in:
Number One: Scale the walls of Meyer Library. I "his is an espe
cially plausible activity il'yourhallmate climbed Mount Everest. All
you have to do is cunningly steal some belay equipment from the
gym, scrounge up the moxie and up and up and away you go! And
if you slip, never fear: the bikes parked outside will break your fall.
Number Two: Remember that elevators are for the wussies and
the handicapped (who have every right to use the elevators and
should not be demeaned in any way. fashion or form, honestly and

sincerely) and use the legs you are lucky enough to be able to utilize and run frenetical
ly up the emergency stairs of Hoover Tower, making sure to knock down whomever else
you encounter along the way so you'll have hurdles to jump over on your way back down.
Number Three: My personal favorite — do yoga in front of MemChu. Naked. Both
liberating and spiritually fulfilling. And if you're a little gun shy, so to speak, at least your
heart rate will go up as your mounting embarrassment causes your face and body to turn
the ever so attractive red that adorns the bashful, as well as the skin of really while peo
ple who have just been poked.
Number Four: If you are not among the aquatically challenged, utilize Stanford's ever
so pleasing fountains and swim lap after lap, drenching yourself in the sweet smell of
chlorine. As it is winter, you might gel a mild case of hypothermia, but 110 worries. Noth
ing helps you lose weight like dying.
Number Five: Take a modem dance class. Not only will you work up a sweat, but
you'll get to touch others inappropriately, too. I do not speak from personal experience.
Number Six: Instead of running the dish, run the roundabout o' death at peak traffic
hours and really get your blood pumping. This will also provide the on-lookers with a
nice chance to work out their abs while they laugh their asses off at you as you run in cir
cles, dodging bikers and occasionally being side-swiped in the kidney by their handle
bars.
Number Seven: Duct tape all of your ridiculously cumbersome textbooks to your
back and do those 100 or so push-ups you've been promising yourself might help turn
your girly arms into bulging babe beckoners. It probably won't work, but hey, might as
well use your textbooks for something if you're going to spend all your time exercising
instead of reading.
Number Eight: To satisfy your personal vendetta against Segway riders, every time
you see one, go up to them pantomiming like you have your own imaginary Segway and
challenge them to a race. Then, when they get that smug look on their face as they begin
to contemplate the glory that will finally be theirs as they beat this shmuck who thinks he
can out run a Segway. push them off and run like hell. Don't worry, they wear helmets to
protect their fragile minds, so they shouldn't incur any brain damage.
So go get 'em tiger, and remember, if all your efforts amount to nothing, you can al
ways take the easy way out and get your tummy tucked.
