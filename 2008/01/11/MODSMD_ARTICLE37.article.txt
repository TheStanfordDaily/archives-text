## "JUNO" DELIVERS 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION JUNE BABY 
Sliding in between massive-budgeted and over-hyped big names like "I Am Legend" and "Na
tional Treasure 2," a little indie teen comedy called "Juno" is making the biggest waves at the the
atres this winter. Featuring a superb cast backed by one of the most refreshingly written scripts in re
cent memory, "Juno" delivers a much-needed jolt of energy to an exceedingly stale Hollywood win
ter.
"Juno" follows the exploits and decisions of 16-year-old Juno Mac Guff (Ellen Page) as she dis
covers that her boredom-induced activities with best friend and love interest Paulie Bleeker
(Michael Cera) have led to an unplanned pregnancy. After Juno decides to go through with the preg
nancy and give the child up for adoption, the latter half of the film centers around Juno's interactions
with adoptive parents Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner).
Although the theatrical trailers focused on the relationship between Bleeker and Juno, most like
ly to piggyback on Cera's "Superbad" and "Arrested Development" fame, the movie actually
spends minimal time on Juno's boyfriend and instead is primarily focused on Juno and the Loring
family. While unexpected, this set-piece provides for some really touching and surprisingly real in
teractions that, while seeming to come out of left field, deliver in a believable and poignant manner.
What immediately makes "Juno" stand out from the usual winter schlock that falls into theatres
is the razor sharp dialogue and witty, if not always subtle, humor. Young Juno has a wonderfully
quick tongue and a gleefully politically incorrect mind that never ceases to inspire exceptionally
guilty laughter throughout the film. All the supporting characters sustain a constant barrage of mem
orable one-liners and complementary dialogue that really ups the pace (and the humor) of the film
from start to finish.
Aside from Juno, much of the screen time falls on the Lorings and boyfriend Bleeker. The Lor
ing family provides a very interesting and unexpectedly serious counter-balance to Juno's generally
quirky and upbeat persona. A beautiful and successful young couple, underneath the immaculate
house and smiling faces the Lorings hide a very strained relationship that explores questions of
boundaries, freedoms and life dreams. While fairly heavy subject matter for what most expect to be
a teen comedy, their relationship is never over-the-top and provides a good and often profound lull
in the comedic drive of the film.
On the other hand, Cera plays his familiar and ever-convincing awkward nice guy as boyfriend
Paulie Bleeker, which, although getting a bit repetitive, is still done flawlessly enough to make you
squirm at his cute-yct-painful social handicaps.
The acting, courtesy of the supporting cast, is satisfyingly consistent and pleasant, from Juno's re
married and down-to-earth dad (J.K. Simmons) to her somewhat air-headed yet loyal best friend
Leah (Olivia Thirbly). Cameo appearances from the likes of "The Officers Rainn Wilson (Dwight)
are amusing additions that do nothing but add to the film's unique character.
But truly, "Juno'"s teen stage is absolutely stolen by Page. From start to finish, Page exhibits a
cool and relaxed demeanor that not only makes her character immediately understandable and real,
but also makes her memorable. Despite Juno's quirky and easy-going nature, Page manages to ex
hibit a lot of very palpable and varied emotion during her time on the screen. Yes, there are plenty
of crude jokes, but there is an equal amount snapshots of a teen truly struggling with the dilemma in
which she has found herself.
The production and composition of the film is, not surprisingly, very different from your average
Hollywood film. Directed by Jason Reitmen ("Thank You for Smoking") the camera work and feel
of the movie is as quirky as its leading role. Coupled with a distinctively different soundtrack, the film
seems to try a bit too hard to escape from the status quo, pushing its uniqueness to a level that seems
forced and is at times annoying. Some may find this to be the very appeal of the film, but I found that
it often detracted from the real strong points of the movie, namely the writing and the acting.
However, despite these minor niggles, "Juno" provides a refreshing and satisfying detachment
from what we've come to expect from a teen comedy and the movie industry in general. Page's tal
ented and honest performance truly underscores the all-around solid performances of the cast. Com
bined with the cutting tongue-in-cheek writing of Diablo Cody's magnificent script, "Juno" delivers
on all levels and is truly this winter's best and most deserving surprise.
