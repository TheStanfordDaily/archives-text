## Rock on with your socks on 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION MOLDY PEACH 
The Juno Soundtrack, is, quite appropriately, like the movie
in many ways: off-beat, strange, memorable and. above all,
charming. Both the CD and the movie open with the folksy
song "All I Want Is You," a simply wrought harmonica and
guitar piece sung by Barry Louis Parker, a well-known song
writer and performer of children's music. The effortlessly sim
ple, quaint loye ballad sounds as if it came straight from Uncle
Appalachia Joe, sung on his porch, crocodiles swimming past
in the nearby bayou. As the opening credits of the movie roll,
Juno, played by Ellen Page, downs the dregs of a gallon Sunny
D to make herself pee for a pregnancy test as Parker sings, "If
you were a wink, I'd be a nod/ if you were a seed, well I'd be a
pod/ if you were a floor I'd want to be the rug/ and if you were
a kiss I know I'd be a hug."

The CD combines the folk of Parker with rock songs from
old favorites, like Buddy Holly's sweet 1950's love song
"Dearest" and the British pop/rock band The Kinks's gem of
a song, "A Well Respected Man," and the Beatles-Dylan
esque "All The Young Dudes" by Mott the Hoople. The Vel
vet Underground sing the unusual folk-turned-rock song "I'm
Sticking With You," which starts as a piano and a single, high
and wavering falsetto singing, "I'm sticking with you, because
I'm made out of glue/ anything that you might do, I'm gunna
do too." Slowly, harmonies, guitar, drums are layered as the
song — and the movie, for that matter — build to a full and
moving end.
The CD sprinkles in a handful of contemporary songs to the
folk and old-rock mix, including pieces from the alt-rock band
Sonic Youth, the folksy-blues one-woman band Cat Power
and the indie group Belle and Sebastian.
The new and old folk/rock songs are interspersed with six
tracks from Kimya Dawson, a low-profile, indie/folk/punk

singer, whose sparse guitar backs up her simple,
repeated melodies and oft-peculiar lyrics. Daw
son is also part of the band The Moldy Peaches,
which hasn't produced music since 2004, but
whose perfectly strange

song, "Anyone Else But
You," is featured in the
movie and
then

sung by
Juno's
co-stars

Michael
Cera and
Ellen Page in the

closing scene of the film. (The ac
tors' rendition is included as the last
song on the CD.) In the bizarre but endearingly loving song,
The Peaches sing, "Here is the church and here is the steeple,
we sure are cute for two ugly people/1 don't see what anyone
can see in anyone else, but you."
Juno director Jason Reitman credits Page with shaping the
soundtrack. In a recent interview, he said, "At one point, I
asked Ellen Page before we started shooting, 'What do you
think Juno listens to?' And she said 'The Moldy Peaches."'
Through The Moldy Peaches, ReiUnan learned of Dawson,
whose solo material Reitman also included on the soundtrack.
Aside from recording two short, two-chord instrumentrals for
the soundtrack, Dawson didn't write any music specifically for
the movie. On her blog, she writes, "And when people were
coming up to me telling me I did a great job [on the sound
track] it felt weird because I didn't do a job. I wrote a bunch of
crap when my heart was hurting."
Between Dawson's simple, heartfelt compositions, some
golden oldies, and a dash of current indie-pop-rock, the Juno
Sountrack is of the best types of compilations — one that you
wouldn't and probably couldn't create yourself, one that in
troduces you to new songs, artists and possibly genres. The
Juno Soundtrack is currently the number one selling album
on iTunes, and although it's probably just peculiar enough
not to achieve the fame and übiquity of the "Garden State"
or "O Brother, Where Art Thou" soundtracks, its quirky and
delightful folk-meets-rock-and-does-love feel will hopefully
make it a soundtrack cult classic.
