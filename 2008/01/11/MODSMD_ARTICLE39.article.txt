## Streamline your sex life 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX SPOTTER 
Roxy (and hopefully your sexual
partner/s) loves you the way you are and
thinks you're absolutely perfect. But let's face
it: Even when we think we have the science of
sex down to a well-lubed machine, sometimes
hook-ups don't go perfectly. Yes, even Roxy
has woken up the occasional Sunday morning
beating herself up (ooh! aah!) over what went
wrong the night before. To help you achieve
Sex Deity status in the new year, Roxy shares
her rock-hard-earned experience with a few
common coital contretemps.
You Don't Have a Condom
This is an easy one. Repeat after Roxy: If
you don't have a condom, don't have sex,
dumbass. But Roxy, what if he swears he
doesn't have any STDs? Don't have sex with
out a condom. What if we're both virgins, so
we don't have anything to give to each other?
Don't have sex without a condom. What if I'm
on the pill, so I definitely won't get pregnant?
Don't have sex without a damn condom (al
though kudos to you for rocking the birth con
trol).
There are tons of great things to do with a
ready and willing partner that will not put
your STD- and child-free status in jeopardy:
leave him wanting more with a killer old
school make-out session; show him how you
like to be touched (for next time!) through
mutual masturbation: beat his pants off in
Scrabulous. And always always carry a con
dom next time you think you might be getting
soms. The SHPRC lube'n'tube room might as
come in handy for something.

Something's... Not Quite Right
Ladies, this is a freebie: If you occasionally
get a sudden stabbing sensation every time
your male partner penetrates, put your gyno
on hold for a second — you might just need to
pee. The shape of a woman's reproductive or
gans shifts during arousal, and having a near
full bladder can hurt like hell. Especially if
you're a few red cups in, make sure to pee be
fore hopping in bed (or closet, floor, desk
chair...). Also, if you can possibly generate this
much fluid, always always pee after sex to
lower your risk of urinary tract infections by
flushing cum and bacteria out of the vagina.
After foreplay and penetration, peeing is ba
sically the most important part of sex. (But if
it doesn't reduce sharp pains or burning sensa
tion after sex then, um, get your gyno back off
hold.)
He Won't Fit Into Me!
After he slips on his Trojan, pairs (or trios
or romantic rhombi...) can still have a hard
time getting things started. If his cock is too

big — Roxy likes them big. but
look, you can't fit a whale

into a mailbox — then
three simple words:
lube lube lube.

Apply a water
based lubricant
(Astroglide is the
standard for a rea-

son) and, if the re
cipient is a woman,
'give your tongue a

. cy ■ _ jo —
[workout to make
sure she is sufficiently

aroused so the vagina will fully lubricate itself.
For a hetero pairing, go slowly at the woman's
comfort level, choosing positions that allow
her to control the depth and speed of penetra
tion: woman-on-top and reverse cowgirl are
ideal for this. For both genital and anal sex, try
side-by-side positions where the recipient's
legs are close together, which prevents full
(painful) penetration.
For anal sex, the only way to get more com
fortable is practice. Use fingers or small toys
(Roxy did all her holiday shopping at Good
Vibratioas in San Francisco) to get your part
ner used to the feeling of being penetrated.
Once they're used to it, they will start to relax
and find it pleasurable.
Opposite problem? Penis is too small to
feel good? Roxy says you're just not trying
hard enough: There are tons of positions that
allow deep penetration so you can get the
most out of his (wrapped) package. Doggy
style is great for any pair; a guy and girl should
also try a modified missionary-style, where

the girl rests her ankles on
the guy's shoulder, al-

lowing for extremely

deep penetration.

Maybe He's Just
Not That Into
Me...?
Even though
they seem like
equal and oppo
site problems,
Roxy has noticed

that premature
ejaculation and the

male partner losing an

erection generally have the same results: two
pissed-off, embarrassed people laying back
to-back in bed, scowling at the walls. This is
ridiculous: you're both naked and a few min
utes ago and you were really into each other,
so what's the effin' problem?
The most important thing to do in this situ
ation is also the hardest: Don't be mad at your
partner. Loss of arousal in men and women
can be caused by basically anything: stress,
nervousness, too much alcohol, repressed
childhood memories, whatever. The one
thing it is almost definitely not caused by is
randomly deciding sweaty mid-hook-up that
your partner is a complete troll. So don't take
it as a personal insult. (And premature ejacu
lation? Basically a huge compliment, Roxy
thinks.)
Roxy has always thought it was complete
ly bogus that sex is measured in male orgasms,
anyway. If your partner isn't in the mood or
can't seem to get things together, then what
ever. go on without him (or her) — clear your
mind, rub on a little lube and give yourself the
worship you deserve. If the sound of your pre
orgasmic snuffling turns them on enough to
get them back in the game? Great. If it does
n't? Great. You were out to get some action,
and you did. from a totally hot partner with
whom you should be completely in love: your
self. Plus, you probably won't have to make
yourself wear a condom.
So here's to a great 2008 filled with sweaty
romps and not too many morning-after
WTFs. Master this stuff and, who knows, you
might just end up teaching Roxy a few killer
moves.

doesn't have any STDs? Don't have sex with
out a condom. What if we're both virgins, so
we don't have anything to give to each other?
Don't have sex without a condom. What if I'm
on the pill, so I definitely won't get pregnant?
Don't have sex without a damn condom (al
though kudos to you for rocking the birth con
trol).
There are tons of great things to do with a
ready and willing partner that will not put
your STD- and child-free status in jeopardy:
leave him wanting more with a killer old
school make-out session; show him how you
like to be touched (for next time!) through
mutual masturbation: beat his pants off in
Scrabulous. And always always carry a con
dom next time you think you might be getting
soms. The SHPRC lube'n'tube room might as
come in handy for something.

Something's... Not Quite Right
Ladies, this is a freebie: If you occasionally
get a sudden stabbing sensation every time
your male partner penetrates, put your gyno
on hold for a second — you might just need to
pee. The shape of a woman's reproductive or
gans shifts during arousal, and having a near
full bladder can hurt like hell. Especially if
you're a few red cups in, make sure to pee be
fore hopping in bed (or closet, floor, desk
chair...). Also, if you can possibly generate this
much fluid, always always pee after sex to
lower your risk of urinary tract infections by
flushing cum and bacteria out of the vagina.
After foreplay and penetration, peeing is ba
sically the most important part of sex. (But if
it doesn't reduce sharp pains or burning sensa
tion after sex then, um, get your gyno back off
hold.)
He Won't Fit Into Me!
After he slips on his Trojan, pairs (or trios
or romantic rhombi...) can still have a hard
time getting things started. If his cock is too

big — Roxy likes them big. but
look, you can't fit a whale

into a mailbox — then
three simple words:
lube lube lube.

Apply a water
based lubricant
(Astroglide is the
standard for a rea-

son) and, if the re
cipient is a woman,
'give your tongue a

. cy ■ _ jo —
[workout to make
sure she is sufficiently

aroused so the vagina will fully lubricate itself.
For a hetero pairing, go slowly at the woman's
comfort level, choosing positions that allow
her to control the depth and speed of penetra
tion: woman-on-top and reverse cowgirl are
ideal for this. For both genital and anal sex, try
side-by-side positions where the recipient's
legs are close together, which prevents full
(painful) penetration.
For anal sex, the only way to get more com
fortable is practice. Use fingers or small toys
(Roxy did all her holiday shopping at Good
Vibratioas in San Francisco) to get your part
ner used to the feeling of being penetrated.
Once they're used to it, they will start to relax
and find it pleasurable.
Opposite problem? Penis is too small to
feel good? Roxy says you're just not trying
hard enough: There are tons of positions that
allow deep penetration so you can get the
most out of his (wrapped) package. Doggy
style is great for any pair; a guy and girl should
also try a modified missionary-style, where

the girl rests her ankles on
the guy's shoulder, al-

lowing for extremely

deep penetration.

Maybe He's Just
Not That Into
Me...?
Even though
they seem like
equal and oppo
site problems,
Roxy has noticed

that premature
ejaculation and the

male partner losing an

erection generally have the same results: two
pissed-off, embarrassed people laying back
to-back in bed, scowling at the walls. This is
ridiculous: you're both naked and a few min
utes ago and you were really into each other,
so what's the effin' problem?
The most important thing to do in this situ
ation is also the hardest: Don't be mad at your
partner. Loss of arousal in men and women
can be caused by basically anything: stress,
nervousness, too much alcohol, repressed
childhood memories, whatever. The one
thing it is almost definitely not caused by is
randomly deciding sweaty mid-hook-up that
your partner is a complete troll. So don't take
it as a personal insult. (And premature ejacu
lation? Basically a huge compliment, Roxy
thinks.)
Roxy has always thought it was complete
ly bogus that sex is measured in male orgasms,
anyway. If your partner isn't in the mood or
can't seem to get things together, then what
ever. go on without him (or her) — clear your
mind, rub on a little lube and give yourself the
worship you deserve. If the sound of your pre
orgasmic snuffling turns them on enough to
get them back in the game? Great. If it does
n't? Great. You were out to get some action,
and you did. from a totally hot partner with
whom you should be completely in love: your
self. Plus, you probably won't have to make
yourself wear a condom.
So here's to a great 2008 filled with sweaty
romps and not too many morning-after
WTFs. Master this stuff and, who knows, you
might just end up teaching Roxy a few killer
moves.
