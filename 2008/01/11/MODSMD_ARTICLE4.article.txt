# Prof. sues over medication
## David McKay sues over son's suicide following Prozac purchase from online pharmacy 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Structural Biology Prof. David McKay is
continuing to pursue a wrongful death claim
against the physician and pharmacy groups who
prescribed his son Prozac over the Internet
prior to his suicide.
In August 2005, Stanford freshman John

McKay '08 committed suicide, dying of a combi
nation of alcohol and carbon monoxide poison
ing. At the time of McKay's death, traces of the
antidepressant Prozac were found in his system.
Prozac is one of a number of medications
that carries a "black box" warning from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about its
potential for increasing suicidal thoughts and
behavior. Prior to McKay's death, the online

pharmacy www.usanetrx.com supplied him
with the medication.
Prof. McKay claimed that the online phar
macy acted negligently and illegally in provid
ing his son with the medication. 1 le said that the
pharmacist who wrote the prescription via the
Web site knew nothing about his son's health
history and. in fact, had never seen him prior to
diagnosis.

•The key problem is unscrupulous, profes
sionally negligent Internet physicians who
blindly approve prescriptions for patients they
know nothing about, with no regard for the
risks or consequences, just to make some
quick and easy money," McKay wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Such individuals should
not be allowed to engage in the prac
tice of medicine."
In February 20()6, McKay filed the
civil case with San Francisco Federal
Court against three parties: physician
Christian Hageseth of Fort Collins,
Colo., who wrote the prescription;
pharmacist Frank Gruich of Biloxi,

Miss.; and the pharmacy JRB I lealth
Solutions, which operates out of
Austin, Tex. A summary judgment
has since been given in favor of the
pharmacist on the grounds that the
suicide could not be directly attrib
uted to the Prozac, a judgment which
McKay and his attorneys are consid
ering appealing.
McKay claimed that his primary
concern with this case is drawing at
tention to the issue of online pharma
cies and pharmacists.
"Our main goal is to hold them re

sponsible for their actions," he said,
"with the goal of shutting them down
and bringing attention to the issue of
drugs being prescribed without prop
er diagnosis on the Internet."
As the civil case against the respec
tive parties remains ongoing, a crimi
nal case against I lageseth. whose re
stricted license made it illegal for him
to prescribe the medication to John
McKay, has resulted in Hageseth
being extradited to San Mateo Coun
try and held on a $250,000 hail. On
Dec. 4, Hageseth entered a "not

guilty" plea.
According to McKay, the pharma
cy' was unaware at the time that 1 lage
seth's license was restricted. After
John McKay's death. I lageseth fought
extradition as long as he could, until a
warrant was finally put out for his ar
rest.
"His attorney argued that he
couldn't be tried in California because
everything he did was in Colorado,"
McKay said."lt was ruled that Califor
nia did have jurisdiction over him."
While the circumstances of the

criminal case against Hageseth are
made simpler by the fact that he was
working with a restricted license at the
time of the prescription, the civil law
suit against him and the other two par
ties is much more complicated —
both by the nature of their operation
and an overall ambiguity surrounding
legal issues of this kind.
"One of the facts is there's no ex
plicit law and very few precedents
dealing with the Internet and things of
this sort." McKay said.
He added that the case also be

comes "very complex with jurisdic
tion," given that the defendants reside
in three different states and the case
has been filed in California.
As both the civil and criminal cases
progress. McKay hopes to see law
makers address this issue more close
ly to prevent future incidents.
"It would help to have a set of legal
requirements that are uniform across
state lines," he said.
