straight opponent under 50 points in beating
Oregon State, 66-46, in Corvallis last night.
After escaping with a narrow win over USC
last Saturday despite shooting only 27 percent
from the field, Washington called the ugly win.

backed up those words last night in giv
ing up a meager 46 points for the second
consecutive game.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead
behind the hot shooting of juniors An
thony Goods and Lawrence Hill. The
duo started off 5-for-5 from beyond the
arc as the Cardinal cruised to an early 24-
8 advantage. Oregon State was unable to
whittle the lead below 12 points for the
remainder of the first half and went into
the break facing a 39-20 deficit.
"Going on a run like that to start the
game is always a boost" senior center
Peter Prowitt said.
Although Hill finished with only 13
points on 4-9 shooting, his confidence
and renewed touch bode well for Stan
ford as the squad prepares for the rest of
the daunting Pac-10schedule.'ITie junior
forward, who was selected to the All Pac
-10 team last season, has struggled to
score in his last four games, but he may
have broken out of a slump with his im
pressive first-half performance.
Also key for the Cardinal was junior
point guard Mitch Johnson, who nabbed
four steals last night. Johnson's thievery
stalled Oregon State's attempts to rally
and swung the momentum back in the
Cardinal's favor at various points in the

game.
At times late in the first half, Stanford
tried too hard to force the hall down low.
The team committed 12 turnovers, many
of them on poor entry passes. But the
Cardinal was able to regroup to correct
mistakes and keep the problems from
snowballing.
"We were a little streaky," said soph
omore center Robin Lopez. "But every
time we started to play poorly, we pulled
together as a team anil went on a run."
Lopez finished with eight points and
four rebounds for the Cardinal, while his
brother Brook notched 12 points and
nine boards. Senior forward Taj Finger
also contributed eight rebounds off the
bench for Stanford, five of them offen
sive. Finger is averaging more than one
offensive board every' eight minutes on
the season.
For the third straight game, coach
Trent Johnson made changes in the start
ing lineup. Hill replaced Robin Lopez at
forward and joined Goods, Johnson,
Washington and Brook Lopez in the
starting five.
Arguably the weakest team in a
loaded Pac-1(), the Beavers experienced
a shooting night almost as poor as the
Cardinal's atrocious performance
against USC, connecting on only 30.4

backed up those words last night in giv
ing up a meager 46 points for the second
consecutive game.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead
behind the hot shooting of juniors An
thony Goods and Lawrence Hill. The
duo started off 5-for-5 from beyond the
arc as the Cardinal cruised to an early 24-
8 advantage. Oregon State was unable to
whittle the lead below 12 points for the
remainder of the first half and went into
the break facing a 39-20 deficit.
"Going on a run like that to start the
game is always a boost" senior center
Peter Prowitt said.
Although Hill finished with only 13
points on 4-9 shooting, his confidence
and renewed touch bode well for Stan
ford as the squad prepares for the rest of
the daunting Pac-10schedule.'ITie junior
forward, who was selected to the All Pac
-10 team last season, has struggled to
score in his last four games, but he may
have broken out of a slump with his im
pressive first-half performance.
Also key for the Cardinal was junior
point guard Mitch Johnson, who nabbed
four steals last night. Johnson's thievery
stalled Oregon State's attempts to rally
and swung the momentum back in the
Cardinal's favor at various points in the

game.
At times late in the first half, Stanford
tried too hard to force the hall down low.
The team committed 12 turnovers, many
of them on poor entry passes. But the
Cardinal was able to regroup to correct
