## Further course eval. data released online 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Students looking for the perfect course
load for winter quarter now have a variety of
online sources for information on classes
and professors. At the beginning of this quar
ter, student evaluations available through
Axess and Courseßank allowed more than
3,000 students to make informed decisions
about their classes.
Although course evaluations on Axess
have been available since last year, Jackie
Charonis, assistant vice provost for student
affairs and senior associate for the Universi
ty Registrar, said the site is completely dif
ferent now from its original version last year.
"Essentially,for students,all the informa
tion that is available now wasn't there be
fore," Charonis said. "Fortunately, the
provost made the decision this year to allow

students to see the evaluations by other stu
dents and the quality of their courses and
professors."
However, written student comments
about their instructors have not yet been
published on the site.
"For now. no one has made the decision
to share that information with anyone be
yond that specific instructor," she said. "We
think it is private information from the stu
dents to their respective professors."
Charonis added that the University was
pleased with high student response in evalu
ations last quarter. About 86 percent of stu
dents filled out the online forms in Decem
ber.
The number of students and faculty who
reviewed the site was so overwhelming be
fore winter break that we needed to talk to
our vendor to increase' the number of
people that could log in simultane
ously," she said. "And since this hap
pened for the first time, 1 have to at
tribute it to student involvement."
With so much input given last
quarter and other years, students are
also taking advantage of the tabulat
ed results published three days after
the Dec. Ift deadline for evaluations
on Axess. Many students said that
they found the results to be helpful.
"I liked using it," said Andrew 1 le
'09. "i didn't choose my classes based
on it, but I did feel more secure about
the classes that 1 picked, based on the
information that 1 could see."
Although many students used the
Axess site,some said they felt it could
be improved upon.
"They could have changed the on
line version, instead of using the same
format as the paper version," said
Xavier Gaeta '(J 1 ). "The information
wasn't hard to find, but the site could
have been redesigned in a better
way."
In addition to Axess, students can
also access evaluation results on

Course Rank. Started by three juniors
for a CS 194 project last year, the site,
which also includes user-written com
ments, has expanded from its initial
800 users to over 3.500 users in the
past month.
"The important thing for us was to
get a big mass of users to show that it
was something useful and meaningful
in the world," said co-founder Ftlip
Kaliszan 09.
He said that from the site's launch
in December to the beginning of win
ter quarter, the average daily number
of users was about 4(K). In the last four
days, however, the site has experi
enced increased traffic.
Charonis said that Courseßank
and Axess were not in competition
with each other, but rather in a part
nership.
"They provide important things
for two different groups of people,"
she said. "We are excited what
Courseßank does for students in
giving them choices, and at the same
time Axess provides information to
instructors and meets faculty
needs."
Kaliszan agreed that the Universi
ty has been supportive of the Cours
eßank project since its growth.
"We are providing a nicer inter
face with more functionality with
data that students need to plan their

courses," he said. "For that, the Uni
versity is cooperating and trying to
get their information to us."
Many students appreciated the
additional features Courseßank pro
vides, including advanced planning
and scheduling tools. Others hoped to
see more students participate in class
evaluations.
it would help if more people
joined." said Vincent Wu '09. "When
data like grade-distribution bars are
composed of three people, it is hard to
learn anything about the class."
Charonis and Kaliszan said they
are currently looking into ways to en
hance their respective sites.
"We are always looking for ways
to improve the system because tech
nology constantly provides us with
new opportunities," Charonis said.
Kaliszan said to look forward to
additional Courseßank features in
the near future.
"We have a whole list of new ideas
in our heads," Kaliszan said. "Some
thing a lot of people have requested is
to have a feature that will tell students
what classes they are missing to fulfill
their specific major. We can't make
any promises about that right now,
but we are looking into it."
