## Emissions tied to death Professor finds first direct link, influencing policy 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford scientist Mark Jacobson may
have provided policy makers with the proof
they need to push for more stringent car
bon dioxide emission standards. The civil
and environmental engineering professor
produced the first evidence of a direct link
between carbon emissions and increasing
mortality rotes in the United States.

Carbon dioxide released into the
environment causes air tempera-

ture to increase and adds to air
pollution. According to Ja-

cobson's study, the addi
tional air pollution causcd
by each degree Celsius in
crease in temperature leads
directly to about 1,000 ad
ditional deaths in the
I T-:* « J A

United States and
many more cases of
respiratory illness, in
cluding asthma.

This is the first
study that allows the
scientific community to

- - |
conclude with certainty
that carbon dioxide emis
sions, exclusive of other
global warming agents, are
responsible for chemical and

meteorological changes that increase
human mortality rates.
The political reactions to climate change
in recent years prompted Jacobson to iso
late carbon dioxide emissions in a study.
"Ttoo years ago, I decided to quantify
[carbon dioxide] effect on health in urban
areas because there was a regulatory and
legal issue as to whether carbon dioxide

could be regulated as an air pollutant," Ja
cobson said, "and the answer to this re
quired information on the health effects of
[carbon dioxide]."
"No study had quantified the effects [of
carbon dioxide alone], and to do so was not
possible until the development of a com
puter model that treated air pollution and
climate on both the global and urban scales
simultaneously," Jacobson continued. "The
computer model that I developed at Stan
ford was the first worldwide to be able to do


BECCA DEL MONTE/
The Stanford Daily
this."
One of the important conclusions
of the study showed that air pollu
tion increases most drastically in
places already affected by global
warming. Jacobson noted that Cali
fornia is home to six of the 10 most
polluted cities in the United States
and suffers over 30 percent of the ad
ditional mortality caused by carbon
dioxide emissions, although it con
tains only 12 percent of the U.S. pop
ulation.
Jacobson believes that these facts
justify the efforts California legisla
tors have made in recent years to en
force more stringent carbon emis
sion standards than the federal gov
ernment currently mandates. The
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), under the guidance of Presi
dent George W. Bush, has denied
California's appeal to be exempt
from the national standard.
"Since the EPA decision to deny
California was based in part on the
theory that California does not suf-

fer more than other states due to
global warming, and this contention
is contradicted by the study," Jacob
son said.'i believe the EPA should
correct its decision, as it was based
on a lack of information that is now
available."
The eventual goal of the Califor
nia proposal is to reduce the state's
greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per
cent by the year 2020. Jacobson's dis

covery of a direct link between car
bon dioxide emissions and human
deaths may be instrumental in per
suading the EPA to reconsider Cali
fornia's proposal for carbon emis
sion caps and even to expand the
stringent standards to a national
level.
