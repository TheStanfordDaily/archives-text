## Emissions tied to death Professor finds first direct link, influencing policy 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford scientist Mark Jacobson may
have provided policy makers with the proof
they need to push for more stringent car
bon dioxide emission standards. The civil
and environmental engineering professor
produced the first evidence of a direct link
between carbon emissions and increasing
mortality rotes in the United States.

Carbon dioxide released into the
environment causes air tempera-

ture to increase and adds to air
pollution. According to Ja-

cobson's study, the addi
tional air pollution causcd
by each degree Celsius in
crease in temperature leads
directly to about 1,000 ad
ditional deaths in the
I T-:* Â« J A

United States and
many more cases of
respiratory illness, in
cluding asthma.

This is the first
study that allows the
scientific community to

conclude with certainty
that carbon dioxide emis
sions, exclusive of other
global warming agents, are
responsible for chemical and

meteorological changes that increase
human mortality rates.
The political reactions to climate change
in recent years prompted Jacobson to iso
late carbon dioxide emissions in a study.
"Ttoo years ago, I decided to quantify
[carbon dioxide] effect on health in urban
areas because there was a regulatory and
legal issue as to whether carbon dioxide

could be regulated as an air pollutant," Ja
cobson said, "and the answer to this re
quired information on the health effects of
[carbon dioxide]."
"No study had quantified the effects [of
carbon dioxide alone], and to do so was not
possible until the development of a com
puter model that treated air pollution and
climate on both the global and urban scales
simultaneously," Jacobson continued. "The
computer model that I developed at Stan
ford was the first worldwide to be able to do
