WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
The Stanford Storytelling Project invites all Stanford students,
faculty, staff, alumni, and fellows to submit stories for a new,
weekly radio show and audio-video podcast that showcases the
best of Stanford storytelling. We are particularly interested in
stories of discovery or transformation, stories with a surprising
insight, and stories with heart. All genres of storytelling are
welcome â€”fiction, memoir, documentary, essay, poetry, oral
history, academic inquiry, journalism, even song and sound art.
So if you have a great story to tell, see our submission
guidelines at:
storytelling.stanford.edu
Tune in to the Storytelling Project Mondays at 6pm on 90.1 KZSU
or find us on Stanford iTunes.
The Stanford Storytelling Project is made possible by the generous support of
The Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts, Stanford Continuing
Studies, The Stanford Oral Communication Program,
and the Hume Writing Center.
