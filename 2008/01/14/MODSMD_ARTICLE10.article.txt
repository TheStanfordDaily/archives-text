# Champion of the Chachalaca call
## 
### LUKE HENESY 
Stanford students are generally good at
things. Really good. Forty-one current or for
mer student-athletes competed at the 2004
Summer Olympics, and when the dust settled,
those who at one point rode hikes through the
Quad or stressed about Econ midterms had
brought home 17 medals from the Games.
A full year before students and alumni
found success in Athens, a Piedmont high
school sophomore and future Stanford student
had already been crowned champion of some
thing extraordinary... but quite unconvention
al.
Andrew Meyer '09 had heard about his high
school's nationally-recognized bird calling
competition and entered "on a whim" with his
partner and friend Cullen Reddy.
The annual Piedmont Bird Calling competi
tion was started by biology teacher Leonard
Waxdeck in 1 %3, and grew quickly from a local
event to a nationally recognized competition
when a few of its early winners appeared on the
Johnny Carson Show. The competition in
volves judging in three main areas — first, the
authenticity of the bird call, then the delivery of
it and finally, a short skit about the bird itself.

After making it through a screening process
led by a group of ornithologists — zoologists
who study birds — Meyer and Reddy began
their quest for gold armed with a knowledge
and passion for the call of the Chachalaca.
"The competition is a fixture in Piedmont,
and even though it was a wackv thing to do, I ni

"Even though it was a wacky
thing to do, I'm always up
for trying new things."

always up for trying new things" Meyer said.
"So we entered, were assigned a coach and
worked with him for a couple of months trying
to hone down this one type of call."
But how does a pair of bird calling rookies
train to sound like the Chachalaca?
"Training was interesting — we had to do a

lot of high pitched vocal exercises daily just to
get it right," Meyer said, chuckling.
In the end the practice paid off, and Meyer
and Reddy were victorious. In addition to being
honored with trophies, the pair was rewarded
with an all-expenses-paid week in New York
City arranged by David Lettermans staff, culmi
nating with an appearance on the Late Show.
"They kind of made fun of us but it was a
good time." said Meyer. "They even remem
bered us my senior year [of high school] and
brought us back on the show."
(If you're still skeptical about bird calling, I
suggest checking out Meyer's impression of the
blue-footed booby on the Late Show during his
senior year. Search "Late Show Piedmont Bird
C ailing on You Tube and then click on the first
and only result.)
When asked about whether he intends to
venture further into the world of bird calling,
Meyer announced that he had retired the skill
from his repertoire. His swan song was during
his first IHUM section freshman year.
"Sometimes I still try it for fun when I'm
alone, but it sounds like a bird is dying," he said.
Well, at least he went out on top.
