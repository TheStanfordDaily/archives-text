## ASSU initiative places key texts on reserve 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
More than $3,000 worth of text
books have been placed on two-hour
reserve at Green Library this quarter
as the result of an ASSU initiative
funded by the Office of the Provost.
The effort, which seeks to provide a
low-cost alternative to buying text
books for popular courses, has more
than doubled the number of high
priced texts on reserve for winter
quarter classes â€” from 26 to 55. ac
cording to ASSU Senator Vang Kou
Khang "OS.
"These numbers may not be
much, but it is one step closer to help
ing alleviate the cost of living for stu
dents," Khang said in an email to The
Daily.
The staff of the Stanford Book
store and Green Library worked
with professors in several depart
ments to compile the list of texts to
purchase, which included such vener
able standbys as Prof. John Taylor's
introductory economics text and
first-year Spanish and French books.
More esoteric fare, including "Art
and Experience in Classical Greece"
and "Introduction to Spectroscopy,"
also won shelf space.
Khang and fellow senators Sarah
Golabek-Goldman TO and Luukas
lives '09, who headed the initiative,
encouraged students to provide rec
ommendations for future textbook
purchases on the ASSU Web site at
assu.stanford.edu.
