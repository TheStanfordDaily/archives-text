## Editorial Board New showerheads an unfriendly initiative 
### 
The Green Wave has officially hit cam
pus. From the Green Dorm project to
the distribution of free CFL bulbs at
the start of this year, Stanford is serious
about becoming environmentally savvy.
Generally, the many ways in which Stanford
has slowly decreased its carbon footprint
have been well received.
Upon returning from winter break, how
ever, some students were maddened by the
latest development in Stanford's push for
sustainability. The showerheads of many of
the dorms on campus had been changed to a
lower-flow, more environmentally-friendly
version.
ITiough a laudable step towards cutting
down on Stanford's water use, all students
interviewed from Lagunita and Wilbur
about the new showerheads reiterated the
same basic points: the showers are frustrat
ing and counterproductive, the water barely
comes out hard enough to rinse shampoo
out or warm up a cold bather, and students
often take longer showers to counteract the
low-flow feature. A student in FroSoCo
even went as far as to remove the new addi
tions to the residence's showers.
On a cold winter morning, after taking a
run in sub-40 degree weather or waking
after a short night of sleep, many students
wonder if it is too much to want a warm and

revitalizing shower.
Although much of the Stanford campus
understands and is supportive of the extra
measures needed to help the environment,
such as recycling, using energy efficient
light-bulbs, or turning off appliances during
breaks, the new showerheads come as an es
pecially jarring change. This can be attrib
uted to their less-desirable features, but also
because students did not expect, nor were
they consulted, about the change.
Perhaps if the showerhead installations
had been announced publicly in the weeks
before winter break, portrayed as an impor
tant instrument in the battle to preserve nat
ural resources, the reaction would have
been less fierce. Students perhaps would still
have been annoyed by the inconvenience,
but would more fully understand the bene
fits the new showerheads provided the com
munity at large.
Instead, students were surprised by drib
bling water pressure upon returning to their
dorm showers after break.The student body
was left out in the decision-making process
of a change that will affect most students
every day.That neglect is reflected in one of
the more controversial attempts thus far at
making Stanford greener. And what is more
wasteful than having to undo something
you've already done?
