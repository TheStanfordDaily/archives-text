Lisa overflows with stories from her
childhood. She lights up when de
scribing round-table family meals,
summer campfires, or her embarrassingly
drunk and quirky relatives. On the topic of
her mother, however, this usually loqua
cious girl becomes surprisingly quiet. Sure,
her mother makes regular appearances in
her meandering remembrances, but in no
more detail than a few words exchanged or
inclusion in a list of attendees. 1 never no
ticed Lisa's neglect to mention her mother
until last year. For knowing so much about
the minute details of Lisa's life, 1 was sur
prised when she told me she was taking a
year absence to care for her mother's failing
health.
Sadly, for displaying such loyalty and sup
port for her family, Lisa received little of ei
ther from her fellow Stanford community
members. It's not that Stanford students are
unsympathetic or cold-hearted — Lisa did
n't feel comfortable telling others the some
what distressing reason for her leave of ab
sence. She often left the justification to the
imaginations of her listeners.The cost of her
silence, however, was misunderstanding.
When she would say she was stopping out a
year, she felt other's tacitly (and sometimes
explicitly) labeling her as a lazy burnout.
Although Lisa's acquaintances were un
informed by the truth of the situation, 1 think
the reception of Lisa's news reflects Stan
ford students' general undervaluation of
personal time.
I"hroughout the countless casual conver
sations over the years, I've established my
own Stanford-calibrated scale of time
"value." High upon the scale are internships,
social entrepreneurship. and research. Men
tioning that I'm doing any of the above is re
ceived with smiles and eyebrows arched
with piqued interest. Questions are asked
and congratulations ensue. The middle
range of the scale is filled with life-enriching,
but less quantifiable experiences — includ
ing but not limited to: a solo backpacking
trip through Europe, writing a novel, or vol
unteering to build homes in nations that re
quire at least three vaccinations before ap
proving entry. I find that purely personal
time, such as time spent reconnecting with

family or relaxing one's over-strained psy
che, is generally not considered a valuable
use of time.
For instance, when faced with the possi
bility of doing nothing but spending my win
ter break relaxing with family, 1 didn't even
want to mention my plans to others. When I
did, my own disappointment over my plans
was then reaffirmed by others' reactions to
my agenda: "Oh. c 001... 50... what are you
doing after that?" 1 prepared myself for
being accused of the ultimate sin: wasting
time.
But this break, 1 discovered that my value
system was flawed. I discovered the same
thing that Lisa discovered at home this past
year, that sometimes taking care of oneself
and one's family can be more valuable than
any resume booster or impoverished life
saved. Personal time allows one to take a
look at one's soul, to rekindle mislaid goals,
and to replace doubts with certainty Ulti
mately these can lead towards improved
performance in school, work, and other
"valuable" activities.
Yet Lisa's experience provides an exam
ple that many, including myself, still find it
hard to weigh personal time equally with ac
tivities that possess a more defined metric of
success.
Lisa knows that spending time with her
family was the best choice she could have
made. This past year was rough for her. and
she struggles to articulate exactly what she
learned from the year, she assures me she
has gained "so much." I'm not writing this
column for her. I'm writing this column for
the rest of us who. like me, have lost sight of
the value of making time for ourselves and
the people who surround us.
