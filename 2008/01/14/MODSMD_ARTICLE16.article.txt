## More than inconvenient: sustainability hype 
### 
Hello, can you spare five minutes for the
environment? Me either. And when
those judgmental, guilt-mongering,
sidewalk-prowling little twits corner me with
their clipboards and ask me to do so. 1 want to
flail my arms around and sputter through a
foaming mouth,"l devote my entire god damn
life to the environment!"
But then, of course, I remind myself that
such actions would he childish, melodramatic,
and perhaps a tad hyperbolic, and 1 manage to
restrain my inner zealot. Indeed, 1 am passion
ate about sustainability, and 1 have made a
strong personal and professional dedication to
the cause. Still, I do not. in fact, devote my en
tire god damn life to the environment, and
making a scene about it on Massachusetts Av
enue in Cambridge would not be particularly
effective in achieving my goals, environmental
or otherwise.
And. well, effectiveness is paramount. Arm
flailing and mouth foaming are just a (gasp)
waste of energy if they effect no impact. Hven
worse, such public displays of affectation do
considerable damage in distracting society's

limited collective attention away from legiti
mate endeavors with real results.
Indeed, an unfortunate consequence of the
current public interest in sustainability is that
much of our attention surely is distracted from
substance by its sparkly, jazz-handing cousin:
hype. More than ever, politicians, advertisers,
and advocacy groups are cluing in to the rapid
ly increasing community of people concerned
about the degradation of the earth. I will dare
to cynically suggest, however, that these
overeager salespeople view this phenomenon
more as a potential marketing trend to be ex
ploited than as a genuine problem to be tack
led.
Clorox, for example, recently bought the

beloved Burt's Bees company, maker of my
preferred peppermint flavored (and yes. over
priced) lip balm as well as many other ridicu
lous items, such as lemon poppy seed facial
cleanser. As Burt's Bees is seen as an industry
leader in sustainability, the Ciorox people are
now happily tooting their horns about their
own upcoming greenification.
I'm probably not alone, however, in assum
ing that this will primarily entail slapping some
stock images of bamboo onto plastic bottles
and typesetting product names like "Juniper
Blossom Stain Stick" in a soothing green
scrawl. Sadly, however, I suspect that I am alsp
not alone in my ardent animal attraction to ob
jects packaged in such bamboo imagery and
identified in such verdant scribbles. ("But
Caitlin. it's just marketing!" "Don't be silly!
ITiese pretty pictures of plants guarantee that
this product is endorsed by Mother Nature
herself!")
Alas, 1 face this problem of enviro-hype ii)

my professional and academic life as
well. Constituting 40 to 50 percent of
the overall energy consumption pie,
buildings are actually our nation's
greediest gas-guzzlers (as compared
to transportation and industry).
Therefore, architects and civil engi
neers have a great responsibility and
opportunity to reduce this harmful
impact. In recognition of this urgent
need, the "green building" business
has exploded into the public sphere.
Especially with the recent introduc
tion of LEED, a set of industry stan
dards for environmentally responsi
ble design, there is a palpable frenzy

ripping through the profession to
catch up with this new apparent trend.
Unfortunately, designing buildings
with sustainability in mind is not
something we can afford to treat as a
trend, nor in a state of frenzy. Like my
would-be rabid sidewalk gesticula
tions, this kind of attitude is not only
ineffective, but also harmful through
its power of distraction.
Luckily, we do have the technical
prowess to reduce energy consump
tion in buildings. Enhancing wall and
window insulation to improve ther
mal performance.implementing natu
ral day-lighting and ventilation to re
duce electricity loads, and selecting
more efficient permanent appliances
to conserve energy and water —
these are all reasonable,achievable in
terventions.
However, both the architecture

community and the public often seem
to overlook practical solutions like
these. Many tend to assume that green
architecture consists mainly of grass
planted roofs and bamboo floors. Yep.
there's that bamboo again — and
while it's more meaningful as a floor
ing material because it's a renewable
resource, it's nevertheless still over
hyped — it often requires an imprac
tical amount of fuel to be shipped
from places like Vietnam. In architec
ture, in clothing detergent, and in de
bate on the street alike, it's valuable to
be passionate about being green, but
without clear-headedness and critical
reason, the truly inconvenient truth is
that our enthusiasm will be in vain.
