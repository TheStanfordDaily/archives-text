## Chelsea, reach out to all Stanford sisters 
### 
Of Chelsea Clinton's appearances yesterday,
the event at Pi Beta Phi was open to the largest
number of people. However, only ISC mem
bers were allowed to attend.

Chelsea Clinton chose to speak to me —
not because I 'm a Stanford Democrat,
or in Stanford in Government,because
I'm top in my class or I work at the women's
center. In fact, none of these are even true.
But Chelsea still wanted to talk to me...be
cause I am in a sorority.
I can't help but be puzzled — and a bit
troubled — by this. After all, the famous
Stanford alumna never joined a sorority
here. Neither did her mother (Wellesley
doesn't have them), though her father was a
member of Alpha Phi Omega. Chelsea want
ed to speak to me. and I can't, for the life of
me. figure out why.
The Stanford sorority is hardly a cham
pion of women's rights. Sure, our members
are accomplished, intelligent young
women; most at Stanford are. And yet. we
Greeks devote our considerable talents to
improving relations with fraternities and
our campus image (regular solutions in

clude baking cookies, or attending parties
dressed as slutty nurses, secretaries, or
schoolgirls). Service and scholarship are
simply an afterthought.
Chelsea was not always the polished
young woman she is now, and the media
never let her forget it. Her looks were the
butt of jokes by late night comedians: Rush
Limbaugh once cruelly described her as "the
White House dog." Without her parents —
and without professional stylists — Chelsea
would have been an all too-forgettable Stan
ford student: the frizzy-haired, hand-waving,
over-achieving I HUM girl. What sorority
would ve welcomed her?
But had she rushed, she could have had
her pick of the sororities; every Greek organ

ization would've wanted to claim her as their
own. And yet, she resisted. Why? I can't say
— but I know what I want to believe. I want
to believe that she didn't rush for the same
reason she chose to attend this school: She
wanted to "stand on her own feet," to be her
own person.
Chelsea should not want my vote because
I'm a sorority girl. She should want my vote
because I'm smart, because I care about
women's issues and the future of this country.
Not because I drink pink panty droppers
with frat boys on the weekends.
My sisters in Chi Omega are some of the
most intelligent, driven and passionate
women I've met in my life. I wouldn't trade
their friendship for anything. But these girls
don't just exist in sororities — they exist all
across campus. Open the doors for them, and
they will come. Open the doors for them, and
they will listen.
