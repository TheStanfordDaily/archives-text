## Lab verifies Einstein theory Physicists at Varian drop rubidium atoms into 25-foot-deep pit 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
In a 25-foot pit in the basement of Varian Physics
Building, Stanford researchers are running an experi
ment that could unravel Einstein's most famous theory.
Physics Prof. Mark Kasevich and his lab are testing the
equivalence principle, a central tenet of general relativi
ty
"The equivalence principle says that if 1 take two ob
jects of different mass and I drop them, they will acceler
ate at the same rate, assuming you get rid of air resistance
and messy forces like that," explained Jason Hogan, a
physics doctoral student in the Kasevich lab.
The Apollo astronauts demonstrated the principle in
dramatic fashion by dropping a hammer and a feather on
the moon. With no air to interfere with their falls, the two
objects hit the lunar dust at the same time.
The equivalence principle is an established part of
physics.
"It has been verified to the 13th decimal place," said
Hogan. "Our goal is to push the limits to 15 decimals."
If the equivalence principle breaks down at that level
of precision, there may be serious consequences for the
accepted laws of physics.
"The whole theory of general relativity depends on
the equivalence principle being exactly true, not mostly
true," Hogan explained. "If the equivalence principle is
broken, it means that Einstein's theory would have to be
replaced by something else."
Einstein's theory of general relativity explains gravity
by saying that matter causes space to curve. Physics text
books often give the analogy of a bowling ball on a tram
poline. The heavy bowling ball makes the trampoline sag.
If someone rolls an orange towards the bowling ball, the
orange will fall down into the depression created by the
heavier bowling ball.
Hogan explained why the equivalence principle is re
lated to general relativity. General relativity states that
objects move in paths determined by the curvature of the
space around them regardless of their mass.
To test the equivalence principle at the finest level.
Hogan and fellow grad student David Johnson will meas
ure the acceleration of falling rubidium atoms. The deep
pit in Varian was deemed a perfect place to set up the ex
periment.
"The longer you watch something fall, the better you
can measure its acceleration." Hogan explained.
The Kasevich team started modifying the pit for their
experiment four and a half years ago. But the pit has been
a part of Varian for longer than that, and is the subject of
much physics department lore.
"I've heard rumors from people around campus,"
Hogan said, explaining that the first use of the pit was
magnetically shielding human subjects while sensitive
magnetometers measured their blood flow.

The pit was also used by researchers working on Grav
ity Probe B, a satellite-based mission designed to meas
ure the space-time curvature near Earth.
When the Kasevich lab moved into the room, Hogan
said the pit was covered up with a false floor.
"We saw the blueprints and could see the pit was
there," he said. "We said,' That's awesome, we have to use
it.'"
