## Short on funds, SLAC cuts jobs 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
As a result of congressional budget cuts for the 2(X)8 fis
cal year, the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) has an
nounced the anticipated layoffs of 225 of its 1,650 employ
ees, in addition to financial cutbacks to some of its pro
grams.
Eighty members of the SLAC staff have voluntarily an
nounced their resignations, according to Lee Lyons, the
lab's director of human resources — leaving almost 150
jobs still to be cut. Lyons said the specifics of the additional
layoffs will be announced in February.
In coming months, "the biggest issues will be working
with the staff who are laid off." said Lyons,citing the added
need for job counseling for those leaving and group re
building for those who remain.
The lab had been expecting to change about 100 posi
tions before the budget cut in order to hire employees with
different skill sets for their new project,the Linac Coherent
Light Source (LCLS), Lyons said. The project will be the
world's first hard X-ray free-electron laser.
Despite budget cuts, the LCLS remains fully funded and
on schedule for a late 2(XW opening, according to a SLAC
press release.
Other programs were not so lucky.The $550 billion om
nibus spending package passed by Congress in December
included just $95 million in funding for SLAC — a 20 per
cent reduction from the $120 million expected by lab lead
ership.
One experiment known as the B-factory is now set to
end in early March.seven months earlier than planned.
Also affected are SLAC's new photon science institutes.

the Photon Ultrafast Laser Science and Engineering ( en
ter. which designs experiments for the LCLS and studies
ultra fast atomic-scale processes,and the X-ray Laboratory
for Advanced Materials, which studies the atomic-scale
properties of new materials. Both will have plans for growth
scaled back as a result of the budget shortfalls, according to
the press release.
SI .AC is not the only particle physics lab affected by the
reduced congressional spending package. 'Ihe Fermi Na
tional Accelerator Lab in Batavia, 111. faces similar cuts in
funding and staff. Ihe cuts will impede progress on that
lab's NOvA neutrino project and development of the In
ternational Linear Collider (ILC), a project it shares with
SLAC and other international labs.
The project aims to expand the understanding of matter
in the universe by building two facing linear accelerators
capable of hurling electrons and their anti-particles,
positrons, at each other at a rate just shy of the speed of
light, according to the ILC Web site. The feat "would take
physics to the next level," Lyons said.
But Congress cut this fiscal year's funding for the proj
ect from an anticipated $f>o million to $15 million. Already,
three months into the fiscal year, SLAC has spent a quarter
of their anticipated budget — what has turned out to be
their allotment for the entire year — and had to halt work
on the project.
While work will continue on other projects, the impend
ing threat of job loss will weigh on the minds of many.
"1 think our biggest challenge over the next couple
months," Lyons said,"will be helping people deal with that
uncertainty and anxiety."
