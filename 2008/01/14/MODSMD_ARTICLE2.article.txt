# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Students face cramped conditions Returning from abroad, some are greeted by makeshift dorm rooms 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
Eric Showen '09 was not too thrilled when he found
out he would be living in Crothers Hall this quarter, a dor
mitory across from Stern traditionally reserved for grad
uate students. Returning from a fall quarter spent at Stan
ford in Washington, Showen knew Crothers did not have
a reputation for providing the greatest undergraduate liv
ing experience, and when he actually checked into his
room last week he quickly learned why.
Showen found himself occupying a study room in the
basement that had been converted into a one-room quad.
Pipes hanging from the ceiling prevented Showen and his
three roommates from lofting their beds.The heating sys
tem would not turn off, he said, leaving the room stuffy
within the first few minutes. Several hundred law books
lined the walls, taking up valuable floor space. Cobwebs
and dead spiders hung near a rusty pipe that one occupant
found so appalling he pulled his bed away from the wall.
"It was just absurd," Showen said.
The conversion of the basement study room in
Crothers Hall was the latest manifestation of the Univer
sity's efforts to mitigate a housing crunch that left dozens
of students returning to campus winter quarter unas
signed in the initial stages of the Draw. As a result, the
University assigned undergraduates to graduate resi
dences and dorm common areas converted into "over
flow" sleeping rooms.
Housing students for winter quarter is always a chal
lenge because those who return to campus usually out
number those who go abroad during the winter, said
Housing Assignments Director Sue Nunan in an email to
The Daily. She said the University has been placing un
dergraduates in graduate housing for several years, and
the three common areas converted this quarter into sleep
ing rooms — the basement of 717 Dolores, a library in
EBF and the Crothers study room — have been used in
the past as overflow spaces.
"The housing situation is better this winter than last
year," Nunan said, noting that fewer students applied for
winter quarter housing this year than last. "We were able
to house all guaranteed students earlier this year than last
year."
The University did not upgrade any rooms beyond
their normal occupancy caps, which are determined by a
careful equity review of the square footage and physical
characteristics of the room. Nunan said. Vacancies in some
rooms during the fall were assigned to their full capacity
this quarter. The reopening of Roth, the all-female Row
house that was closed fall quarter due to ongoing renova
tions, further alleviated the housing shortage this quarter.
Of the students who spent fall quarter away from Stan
ford, 289 applied for a housing assignment for winter
quarter and 77 did not initially receive one when the re
sults of the wait list were released in November. Students
