# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Students face cramped conditions Returning from abroad, some are greeted by makeshift dorm rooms 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
Eric Showen '09 was not too thrilled when he found
out he would be living in Crothers Hall this quarter, a dor
mitory across from Stern traditionally reserved for grad
uate students. Returning from a fall quarter spent at Stan
ford in Washington, Showen knew Crothers did not have
a reputation for providing the greatest undergraduate liv
ing experience, and when he actually checked into his
room last week he quickly learned why.
Showen found himself occupying a study room in the
basement that had been converted into a one-room quad.
Pipes hanging from the ceiling prevented Showen and his
three roommates from lofting their beds.The heating sys
tem would not turn off, he said, leaving the room stuffy
within the first few minutes. Several hundred law books
lined the walls, taking up valuable floor space. Cobwebs
and dead spiders hung near a rusty pipe that one occupant
found so appalling he pulled his bed away from the wall.
"It was just absurd," Showen said.
The conversion of the basement study room in
Crothers Hall was the latest manifestation of the Univer
sity's efforts to mitigate a housing crunch that left dozens
of students returning to campus winter quarter unas
signed in the initial stages of the Draw. As a result, the
University assigned undergraduates to graduate resi
dences and dorm common areas converted into "over
flow" sleeping rooms.
Housing students for winter quarter is always a chal
lenge because those who return to campus usually out
number those who go abroad during the winter, said
Housing Assignments Director Sue Nunan in an email to
The Daily. She said the University has been placing un
dergraduates in graduate housing for several years, and
the three common areas converted this quarter into sleep
ing rooms — the basement of 717 Dolores, a library in
EBF and the Crothers study room — have been used in
the past as overflow spaces.
"The housing situation is better this winter than last
year," Nunan said, noting that fewer students applied for
winter quarter housing this year than last. "We were able
to house all guaranteed students earlier this year than last
year."
The University did not upgrade any rooms beyond
their normal occupancy caps, which are determined by a
careful equity review of the square footage and physical
characteristics of the room. Nunan said. Vacancies in some
rooms during the fall were assigned to their full capacity
this quarter. The reopening of Roth, the all-female Row
house that was closed fall quarter due to ongoing renova
tions, further alleviated the housing shortage this quarter.
Of the students who spent fall quarter away from Stan
ford, 289 applied for a housing assignment for winter
quarter and 77 did not initially receive one when the re
sults of the wait list were released in November. Students
attending Stanford-affiliated pro
grams received priority over stu
dents who had gone abroad through
other arrangements.
All undergraduates with guaran
teed housing who applied by the
deadline have received a housing as
signment as of Jan, 7, Nunan said.
The remaining unassigned students
applied after the deadline or have
no guaranteed years left.
But the conversion of dorm com
mon areas into dorm rooms has de
manded a set of readjustments, not
only for residents but staff as well.
Michael Wilkerson '09, who was as
signed to the basement of 717 that
was converted into a one-room
quad, said a facilities worker has had
to enter the room in the early morn
ing to access a storage room near
Wilkerson's bed.
"It's hard to blame them because
of the housing crunch," Wilkerson
said. "But no one should have to live
in a one-room quad because of the
different sleeping schedules and
alarm clocks that go off at different
times, not to mention the privacy is
sues."
Brian Truebe "08, who moved into
the 717 basement after studying
abroad at Oxford, said he had al
ready settled in and did not plan to
apply for reassignment.
"It's not like they put me in the
basement of Crothers," Truebe
deadpanned.
This year, 34 students were as
signed to graduate housing in
Crothers and Crothers Memorial,
five more than the previous year,
Nunan said. She said Crothers was a
housing choice on the winter appli

cation and most students assigned
there selected it as a choice.
Showen said he had not listed
Crothers as one of his housing prefer
ences and had originally been told he
would he living in a triple. When he
moved in. he found out he would
have three roommates instead of two
and be living in what he called "a sub
standard living space that falls below
the normal, standard services you
would expect to get in a dorm room."
Nunan said the space was in
spected by a housing supervisor be
fore it was converted and it met all
health and safety standards. But
Showen said the room did not come
equipped with a telephone and wire
less access was not available. The
two screenless windows in the room
look out onto a rain gutter, making it
difficult to escape the room's high
temperature.
"1 try to remain optimistic,"
Showen said."But if I tried to stay in
that room, it could have an adverse
impact on my personal and academ
ic well-being, it's kind of a depress
ing place."
Residential Education assigned a
Resident Assistant (RA) to
Crothers this year to support under
graduate students, and the housing
office tried to consolidate the under
graduates, where possible, to create
a sense of community.
"It is difficult to predict how a
housing situation will impact a stu
dent's experience," said Josh
Schiller, associate director of Resi
dential Education, in an email to The
Daily. "Some students will find a
particular situation to be positive
while others may find the same situ
ation to be negative."
The RA will work with the pro
fessional staff currently residing in
Crothers and Crothers Memorial to
provide programming and dorm
events to help students make the

best of their residential experience,
Schiller said.
Although most students are
pleased with their current housing
locations, Nunan said, returning stu
dents can request reassignments in
the first five weeks of the quarter or
for the spring, when many vacancies
open up as more students head

abroad. Students who are currently
living in graduate housing or other
overflow spaces will be given priori
ty in reassignment.
Showen said that although Hous
ing has been sympathetic with his
situation, he intends to apply for re
assignment as soon as possible. He
said it has been a major inconven

ience to spend the first two weeks of
the quarter sorting out his housing
situation.
"it's hardly ideal," Showen said.
"But anything compares favorably
to what we have right now."

Crothers as one of his housing prefer
ences and had originally been told he
would he living in a triple. When he
moved in. he found out he would
have three roommates instead of two
and be living in what he called "a sub
standard living space that falls below
the normal, standard services you
would expect to get in a dorm room."
Nunan said the space was in
spected by a housing supervisor be
fore it was converted and it met all
health and safety standards. But
Showen said the room did not come
equipped with a telephone and wire
less access was not available. The
two screenless windows in the room
look out onto a rain gutter, making it
difficult to escape the room's high
temperature.
"1 try to remain optimistic,"
Showen said."But if I tried to stay in
that room, it could have an adverse
impact on my personal and academ
ic well-being, it's kind of a depress
ing place."
Residential Education assigned a
Resident Assistant (RA) to
Crothers this year to support under
graduate students, and the housing
office tried to consolidate the under
graduates, where possible, to create
a sense of community.
"It is difficult to predict how a
housing situation will impact a stu
dent's experience," said Josh
Schiller, associate director of Resi
dential Education, in an email to The
Daily. "Some students will find a
particular situation to be positive
while others may find the same situ
ation to be negative."
The RA will work with the pro
fessional staff currently residing in
Crothers and Crothers Memorial to
provide programming and dorm
events to help students make the

best of their residential experience,
Schiller said.
Although most students are
pleased with their current housing
locations, Nunan said, returning stu
dents can request reassignments in
the first five weeks of the quarter or
for the spring, when many vacancies
open up as more students head

abroad. Students who are currently
living in graduate housing or other
overflow spaces will be given priori
ty in reassignment.
Showen said that although Hous
ing has been sympathetic with his
situation, he intends to apply for re
assignment as soon as possible. He
said it has been a major inconven

ience to spend the first two weeks of
the quarter sorting out his housing
situation.
"it's hardly ideal," Showen said.
"But anything compares favorably
to what we have right now."

Four students returning from fall quarter abroad found themselves squeezed into a study room in the basement of
Crothers Hall, an East Campus residence which traditionally houses graduate students.
Eric Showen '09 was not too thrilled when he found
out he would be living in Crothers Hall this quarter, a dor
mitory across from Stern traditionally reserved for grad
uate students. Returning from a fall quarter spent at Stan
ford in Washington, Showen knew Crothers did not have
a reputation for providing the greatest undergraduate liv
ing experience, and when he actually checked into his
room last week he quickly learned why.
Showen found himself occupying a study room in the
basement that had been converted into a one-room quad.
Pipes hanging from the ceiling prevented Showen and his
three roommates from lofting their beds.The heating sys
tem would not turn off, he said, leaving the room stuffy
within the first few minutes. Several hundred law books
lined the walls, taking up valuable floor space. Cobwebs
and dead spiders hung near a rusty pipe that one occupant
found so appalling he pulled his bed away from the wall.
"It was just absurd," Showen said.
The conversion of the basement study room in
Crothers Hall was the latest manifestation of the Univer
sity's efforts to mitigate a housing crunch that left dozens
of students returning to campus winter quarter unas
signed in the initial stages of the Draw. As a result, the
University assigned undergraduates to graduate resi
dences and dorm common areas converted into "over
flow" sleeping rooms.
Housing students for winter quarter is always a chal
lenge because those who return to campus usually out
number those who go abroad during the winter, said
Housing Assignments Director Sue Nunan in an email to
The Daily. She said the University has been placing un
dergraduates in graduate housing for several years, and
the three common areas converted this quarter into sleep
ing rooms — the basement of 717 Dolores, a library in
EBF and the Crothers study room — have been used in
the past as overflow spaces.
"The housing situation is better this winter than last
year," Nunan said, noting that fewer students applied for
winter quarter housing this year than last. "We were able
to house all guaranteed students earlier this year than last
year."
The University did not upgrade any rooms beyond
their normal occupancy caps, which are determined by a
careful equity review of the square footage and physical
characteristics of the room. Nunan said. Vacancies in some
rooms during the fall were assigned to their full capacity
this quarter. The reopening of Roth, the all-female Row
house that was closed fall quarter due to ongoing renova
tions, further alleviated the housing shortage this quarter.
Of the students who spent fall quarter away from Stan
ford, 289 applied for a housing assignment for winter
quarter and 77 did not initially receive one when the re
sults of the wait list were released in November. Students
attending Stanford-affiliated pro
grams received priority over stu
dents who had gone abroad through
other arrangements.
All undergraduates with guaran
teed housing who applied by the
deadline have received a housing as
signment as of Jan, 7, Nunan said.
The remaining unassigned students
applied after the deadline or have
no guaranteed years left.
But the conversion of dorm com
mon areas into dorm rooms has de
manded a set of readjustments, not
only for residents but staff as well.
Michael Wilkerson '09, who was as
signed to the basement of 717 that
was converted into a one-room
quad, said a facilities worker has had
to enter the room in the early morn
ing to access a storage room near
Wilkerson's bed.
"It's hard to blame them because
of the housing crunch," Wilkerson
said. "But no one should have to live
in a one-room quad because of the
different sleeping schedules and
alarm clocks that go off at different
times, not to mention the privacy is
sues."
Brian Truebe "08, who moved into
the 717 basement after studying
abroad at Oxford, said he had al
ready settled in and did not plan to
apply for reassignment.
"It's not like they put me in the
basement of Crothers," Truebe
deadpanned.
This year, 34 students were as
signed to graduate housing in
Crothers and Crothers Memorial,
five more than the previous year,
Nunan said. She said Crothers was a
housing choice on the winter appli

cation and most students assigned
there selected it as a choice.
Showen said he had not listed
Crothers as one of his housing prefer
ences and had originally been told he
would he living in a triple. When he
moved in. he found out he would
have three roommates instead of two
and be living in what he called "a sub
