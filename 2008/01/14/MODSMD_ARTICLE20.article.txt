Ducks' lead to their largest of the game, 32-22 midway
through the first half.
"In the first half, we were back on our heels," said head
coach Trent Johnson. "Like 1 told the guys — we're better
than that defensively."

handed shots from the baseline to close the first half with
20 points on 8-for-9 shooting. Hie Cardinal entered the
locker room trailing by only one, 41-40.
Stanford stepped up its defense and held the Ducks to
34.6 percent shooting in the second half but shot only 28.6
percent in the frame themselves.
In the final minutes, a series of miscues compounded
the Cardinal's problems. With 4:31 remaining and the Car
dinal trailing 62-60, senior forward Fred Washington
missed two free throws. Brook Lopez, who, at times, strug

gles with poor shot selection, then forced an airball from
the left baseline with six seconds remaining on the shot
clock and Stanford down 65-63 with 33 seconds to play.
When point guard Mitch Johnson lost the ball the next
time down the court, the game — for all intents and pur
poses — was over.

"There were situations [at the end of the game] where
we broke down execution-wise," Johnson said.
However, the Cardinal coach avoided pessimism in the
face of defeat.
