## CARD FALLS SHORT Poor execution down the stretch costs Stanford in 71-66 loss to Ducks 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
The Oregon Ducks had just enough in the tank to eke
out a 71-66 upset over the No. 23 Stanford men's basket
hall team Sunday afternoon at McArthur Court in f:u
gene, Ore.
Stanford (13-3,2-2 Pac-10) hung with the Ducks the en-

tire game despite
horrendous three
point (15.8 percent)
and foul (52 per
cent) shooting.
After the Cardinal
jumped out to an
early 6-0 advantage,
the lead would
change nine times
before Oregon (12-
4. 3-1) ultimately
captured the hard
fought victory.

GAME NOTES; The Cardinal is now 13-3 on the
year and 2-2 in conference after yesterday's
loss to Oregon. Brook Lopez was the heart and
sole for Stanford yesterday, scoring 26 points
on 10-16 shooting. The team figures to drop
out of the nation's top 25; Stanford was ranked
No. 23 before Sunday's loss.

through the Stanford defense for a lay-up to help push the
Ducks' lead to their largest of the game, 32-22 midway
through the first half.
"In the first half, we were back on our heels," said head
coach Trent Johnson. "Like 1 told the guys — we're better
than that defensively."
Sophomore center Brook Lopez, however, put on an
offensive show for the seven NBA scouts in attendance.
Using his height advantage over 6'9" Oregon senior Maar
ty Leunen. Lopez combined dunks and lay-ins with one
handed shots from the baseline to close the first half with
20 points on 8-for-9 shooting. Hie Cardinal entered the
locker room trailing by only one, 41-40.
Stanford stepped up its defense and held the Ducks to
34.6 percent shooting in the second half but shot only 28.6
percent in the frame themselves.
In the final minutes, a series of miscues compounded
the Cardinal's problems. With 4:31 remaining and the Car
dinal trailing 62-60, senior forward Fred Washington
missed two free throws. Brook Lopez, who, at times, strug

gles with poor shot selection, then forced an airball from
the left baseline with six seconds remaining on the shot
clock and Stanford down 65-63 with 33 seconds to play.
When point guard Mitch Johnson lost the ball the next
time down the court, the game — for all intents and pur
poses — was over.

"There were situations [at the end of the game] where
we broke down execution-wise," Johnson said.
However, the Cardinal coach avoided pessimism in the
face of defeat.

Senior forward Taj Finger defends Oregon's Tajuan Porter during Sunday's match-up against the Ducks. Despite 26 points
from sophomore Brook Lopez, Stanford was not able to seal the victory, losing in the game's final minute.
"lt was a good basketball game,"
he said. "A dropped ball here, a
missed free throw there makes all
the difference. Fourteen assists to
eight turnovers — that's the impor
tant statistic. 1 don't dwell on shots.
For the most part, I thought [the
team] did a good job. My only frus
tration is that that makes two games
[lost] in a very tough conference."
Brook Lopez agreed that the
shooting was nothing to worry
about.
"We got a lot of looks we want
ed," he said, "shots we normally hit
and looks in the post."
Although junior guard Anthony
Goods rarely shoots 2-for-13 from
the floor, the team's foul shooting
represents more of a concern. Be
sides Lopez and senior forward Taj
Finger, who combined to go 11-for
-12, Stanford shot 2-for-13 from the
charity stripe. Washington finished
0-for-6 from the line.
While his foul shooting was
weak, Washington's passing was a
highlight. His six assists to zero
turnovers paced Stanford's offen
sive attack. No Stanford player
other than Brook Lopez scored in
double digits, but Taj Finger and
Robin Lopez each contributed nine
points off the bench. Surprisingly, it
was Stanford's shortest starter, jun
ior point guard Mitch Johnson, who
pulled down a game-high nine re
bounds.
Leunen led the Ducks with 16
points on 5-for-13 shooting, while
senior forward Malik Hairston and
Porter both notched 15. Oregon
