# Oregon loss a tough one to swallow
## 
### 
On the surface, Stanford's loss at Ore
gon yesterday doesn't seem too bad.
The Ducks came into the season ranked
No. 12 in the nation after returning four
starters from a team that reached the NCAA's
Elite Eight last year. The Cardinal was visiting
one of the country's most hostile road environ
ments in McArthur Court, and, after all, the
game was tight throughout and Stanford
played well despite its horrendous shooting —
Anthony Goods went 2-for-l 3, and overall, the
team was an atrocious 3-for-19 from three
point range (although poor shot selection may
have had something to do with that).
To sum it up, Stanford played well, but just
couldn't execute when it mattered. But that
might be the most damning thing about Sun
day's loss to the Ducks.
It was one of those "coulda, shoulda, woul
da" games. Brook Lopez looked dominant,
scoring 26 points on 10-for-16 shooting. But
down the stretch, the Cardinal did not execute
in getting the ball to the big man for high-qual
ity looks. With under a minute left and a
chance to tie the game, the team frantically
passed the ball around the perimeter before
Lopez was forced to take an off-balance shot
from an impossible angle — not surprisingly.it
was an airball. And let's not even get into the
team's foul shooting in the game's waning mo
ments.
When it comes down to it, good teams win
games like these. I'm aware that Stanford's
record currently sits at 13-3, but if the Cardinal
wants to cement itself as one of the premier
teams in the Pacific-10 Conference, it has got
to show that it can tough it out in the last few
minutes. The team had a perfect chance to do
just that in Eugene yesterday, but it obviously
came up short.
While the game was not a must-win by any
means, this was a win that Stanford really could
have used. Road wins don't come in easy any

Above the Rim
season in the Pac-10, let alone this
year when the conference may be as
strong as ever.
It was the kind of win that a true
contender — a team destined for a
high seed in the NCAA Tournament
— wins. Instead, the Cardinal may be
headed for another double-digit
tournament seeding if they fail to
close games like these down the
stretch.
The Pac-10 season will be a long
one, however, filled with plenty of ups
and downs. A sweep of the Arizona
schools this weekend will most likely
erase all unpleasant memories from
this last game.That said, Sunday's loss
to Oregon was a game that shouldn't
have got away the way it did.

Around the Pac-10:

— After the first two weeks of play, it
is apparent that the conference title is
UCLA's to lose. The No. 5 Bruins out
classed No. 4 Washington State this
past weekend at Pauley Pavilion, 81-
74, in a game that was not as close as
the final score indicated. After the
Bruins' 14-point win over Washington
two days before. Husky guard Justin
Dentmon said, "They're good, but I
don't think they're the best UCLA
team I've faced." While Dentmon's
assertion may or may not be right, one

thing is clear: the road to the Pac-10
title will once again run through West
wood.
— Arizona State freshman James
Harden has helped turn the Sun Dev
ils from a perennial doormat into a
team that looks to have a decent shot
at an NCAA Tournament bid this
year.The guard from Artesia,Calif. —
who I actually played against in high
school (well. 1 was on the bench for
the whole game, but you get the point)
— dropped 26 points on Arizona,
adding a new name to the "Who's the
best freshman in the Pac-10?" debate.
— USC obviously has no shortage of
star power — think O.J. Mayo. Lil'
Romeo (who's coming in next year as
a freshman) — and talent, but they
may struggle to win games as a cohe
sive unit in the tough Pac-10. The Tro
jans started the conference season 0-
3, and. despite showing flashes of bril
liance in close losses to No. 2 Memphis
and No. 3 Kansas, they're already put
ting themselves in a tenuous position
come Selection Sunday.
— Aside from Washington and Ore
gon State, every Pac-10 team has a le
gitimate shot at making the NCAA
Tournament come March. Although
its unlikely that the conference will
get more than six teams into the tour
ney, this is the year it might happen.
