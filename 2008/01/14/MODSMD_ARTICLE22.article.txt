# Oregon loss a tough one to swallow
## 
### 
On the surface, Stanford's loss at Ore
gon yesterday doesn't seem too bad.
The Ducks came into the season ranked
No. 12 in the nation after returning four
starters from a team that reached the NCAA's
Elite Eight last year. The Cardinal was visiting
one of the country's most hostile road environ
ments in McArthur Court, and, after all, the
game was tight throughout and Stanford
played well despite its horrendous shooting —
Anthony Goods went 2-for-l 3, and overall, the
team was an atrocious 3-for-19 from three
point range (although poor shot selection may
have had something to do with that).
To sum it up, Stanford played well, but just
couldn't execute when it mattered. But that
might be the most damning thing about Sun
day's loss to the Ducks.
It was one of those "coulda, shoulda, woul
da" games. Brook Lopez looked dominant,
scoring 26 points on 10-for-16 shooting. But
down the stretch, the Cardinal did not execute
in getting the ball to the big man for high-qual
ity looks. With under a minute left and a
chance to tie the game, the team frantically
passed the ball around the perimeter before
Lopez was forced to take an off-balance shot
from an impossible angle — not surprisingly.it
was an airball. And let's not even get into the
team's foul shooting in the game's waning mo
ments.
When it comes down to it, good teams win
games like these. I'm aware that Stanford's
record currently sits at 13-3, but if the Cardinal
wants to cement itself as one of the premier
teams in the Pacific-10 Conference, it has got
to show that it can tough it out in the last few
minutes. The team had a perfect chance to do
just that in Eugene yesterday, but it obviously
came up short.
While the game was not a must-win by any
means, this was a win that Stanford really could
have used. Road wins don't come in easy any
