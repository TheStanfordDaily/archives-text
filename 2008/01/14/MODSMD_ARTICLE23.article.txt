## Card looks to be back in step 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team did exactly what it had to the weekend
after its shocking losses at UCLA and USC.
The team scored in all different ways, and
from different sources than usual suspects
sophomore Jayne Appel and senior Candice
Wiggins. Also, the outside shooting started to
look a bit better. Most importantly, the Car
dinal came away with two victories, keeping
its Pac-10 destiny in its own hands.
Appel and Wiggins were the headliners, as
usual, against Oregon State and Oregon. But
it was very comforting to see other double
digit scorers in those games. Senior guard
Cissy Pierce's 10 points against the Beavers
came in increased minutes because of the
lopsided win, but Pierce is a streaky shooter
and that night could get her going for the
next few weeks.
Against Oregon, it was junior Jillian Har
mon and freshman Jeannette Pohlen doing
the damage. When Harmon is on, she adds
great variety to the Stanford offense. She can
hit jumpers from anywhere inside the arc and
causes mismatches with her size and agility.
Pohlen's presence is important given the
Cardinal's three-point shooting woes this
season â€” hopefully, her 3-for-6 effort
against Oregon is a sign that she can become
a dependable option from behind the arc.
All of this adds up to encouraging signs
that Stanford can live up to its preseason
billing and repeat as Pac-10 champions. With
just two losses, the Cardinal can still bring un
defeated (in the Pac-10) California back
down in the standings as the season progress
es. Stanford knows that it may have exhaust
ed its margin for error this season, and, as a
result, the players seem focused and ready to
make up for it.
