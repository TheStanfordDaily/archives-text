This weekend was much better than
last for the Stanford women's basket
ball team.
The No. 7 Cardinal crushed Oregon.
83-49, on Saturday afternoon, two days
after dispatching Oregon State. 81-45,
Thursday evening.The two easy wins —
which were much-needed bounce-back

victories after the Cardinal was swept
by unranked UCLA and USC last week
— came in different fashions, however.
On Thursday, Stanford (14-3, 4-2
Pac-10) pounded the hall inside to soph
omore center Jayne Appel, who led all
scorers 25 points in the win. With Appel
neutralized by foul trouble on Saturday,
however, the Cardinal turned to suffo

Stanford with 20 points against the
Ducks (8-8.2-3 Pac-10).
"We are a great offensive team,"
Wiggins said. "And defense can bring us
lots of energy."
Offensively, the Cardinal shot a blaz

created numerous opportunities in the
transition game.
Another chunk of points came off of
second chances. Junior forward Jillian
Harmon added 15 points for the Cardinal,
one short of her season high, to go with
nine rebounds, five of them on the offen
sive glass. Harmon converted those
missed shots into three lay-ups and a pair
of free throws for Stanford.
"1 see offensive rebounding as a way to
get easy baskets," Harmon said. "In LA.
we weren't as aggressive as we needed to
be. It's my job to crash the boards."
I larmon and Wiggins outscored the en
tire Oregon team until only eight minutes
remained in the game, at which point the
Cardinal's starters had long since been re
moved in favor of the reserves.
Stanford never trailed in the contest
and jumped out to a 10-point lead just 3:06
into the game after a pair of steals and
fast-break scores by sophomore point
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and Wig
gins.
Then the senior All-American took off.
Before the game, Wiggins received the
2007 USA Basketball Female Athlete of
the Year award, and the veteran showed
why she gets the accolades in the middle
part of the first half.

After Oregon and Gold-Onwude trad
ed baskets to make the score 14-4. Wig
gins went on a personal 10-2 run. netting
the Cardinal's next four baskets against
just one from the Ducks.The senior guard
sunk a jumper while drawing contact and
added in a free throw before burying a
three-pointer and two more mid-range
jump shots to inflate Stanford's lead to
24-6.
The Cardinal coasted through the
rest of the first half and headed into the
intermission up 38-22. before bursting
out of the locker room with a 14-3 run to
begin the second stanza. Stanford's
backups started to fill out the lineup at
that point, with all 11 available players
getting in the game and 10 of them reg
istering points.
Freshman guard Jeannette Pohlen was
Stanford's other double-digit scorer on
the day. chipping in 15 points, thanks
mostly to three second-half three-point
ers. Fellow frosh I lannah Donaghe was 2-
for-2 from long range for six points.
Stanford hits the road this week, when
it faces Arizona on Thursday and No. 25
Arizona State on Sunday.
