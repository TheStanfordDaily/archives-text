# Chelsea campaigns at Farm
## Q & A targets college female demographic 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Chelsea Clinton '01 fielded questions
about her mother's presidential bid last
night before an audience of over 100 young
women packed on the floor of the Pi Beta
Phi lounge.
'Phe former first daughter's address fol
lowed a smaller round table discussion at
Old Union. Campaign organizers reached
out to sororities in an effort to target
women, one of I lillary Clinton's "core de
mographics," according to Carolyn
Forstein '10, an associate with the Clinton
campaign in San Francisco and a member
of Stanford Students for Hillary.
"We had to reach out to Hillary support
ers and undecided voters." Forstein said.
"We wanted to keep it pretty small, so we
didn't advertise that Chelsea was coming."
Chelsea Clinton opened the question
and answer session at Pi Phi by recalling her
days as a Stanford undergraduate. The
event was publicized to the five sororities in
the Inter-Sorority Council.
"I'm overcome by nostalgia," Clinton
said."l used to live in ZAP my sophomore
year, so not that far away. Walking here
from the library area was very 7 reminiscent
of late nights."
Chelsea Clinton is taking time off from
her job with Avenue Capital Group, a New
York hedge fund, to promote the campaign

of her mother. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.), for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
"We are just try ing to make my mom's
campaign more accessible to people," she
said. "We want to make sure that young
people feel like the campaign is talking
about issues that you care about and is de
livering its plans and ideas in a way that res
onates with you."
Emily Hawkins, youth director for the
Clinton campaign, asked for a show of
hands from undecided students in the
room. Most attendees raised their hands.
The Democratic presidential primary in
California is on Feb. 5, but many students
registered absentee received their ballots in
the mail last week.
"When I was at Stanford I was constant
ly haranguing my friends to vote.and unfor
tunately so many of them actually didn't
vote,"Clinton said."You don't have that ex
cuse any more in California. Voting actual
ly started a week ago."
She addressed a series of questions
about her mother's campaign stances.
"1 can tell you what my mom said â€”
that she would end the war tomorrow if she
could," Clinton told a student who asked
about troop withdrawals in Iraq.
But she said an immediate withdrawal
was not fully feasible, as many troops have
