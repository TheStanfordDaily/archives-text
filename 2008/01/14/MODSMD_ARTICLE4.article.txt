# Chelsea campaigns at Farm
## Q & A targets college female demographic 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Chelsea Clinton '01 fielded questions
about her mother's presidential bid last
night before an audience of over 100 young
women packed on the floor of the Pi Beta
Phi lounge.
'Phe former first daughter's address fol
lowed a smaller round table discussion at
Old Union. Campaign organizers reached
out to sororities in an effort to target
women, one of I lillary Clinton's "core de
mographics," according to Carolyn
Forstein '10, an associate with the Clinton
campaign in San Francisco and a member
of Stanford Students for Hillary.
"We had to reach out to Hillary support
ers and undecided voters." Forstein said.
"We wanted to keep it pretty small, so we
didn't advertise that Chelsea was coming."
Chelsea Clinton opened the question
and answer session at Pi Phi by recalling her
days as a Stanford undergraduate. The
event was publicized to the five sororities in
the Inter-Sorority Council.
"I'm overcome by nostalgia," Clinton
said."l used to live in ZAP my sophomore
year, so not that far away. Walking here
from the library area was very 7 reminiscent
of late nights."
Chelsea Clinton is taking time off from
her job with Avenue Capital Group, a New
York hedge fund, to promote the campaign

of her mother. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.), for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
"We are just try ing to make my mom's
campaign more accessible to people," she
said. "We want to make sure that young
people feel like the campaign is talking
about issues that you care about and is de
livering its plans and ideas in a way that res
onates with you."
Emily Hawkins, youth director for the
Clinton campaign, asked for a show of
hands from undecided students in the
room. Most attendees raised their hands.
The Democratic presidential primary in
California is on Feb. 5, but many students
registered absentee received their ballots in
the mail last week.
"When I was at Stanford I was constant
ly haranguing my friends to vote.and unfor
tunately so many of them actually didn't
vote,"Clinton said."You don't have that ex
cuse any more in California. Voting actual
ly started a week ago."
She addressed a series of questions
about her mother's campaign stances.
"1 can tell you what my mom said â€”
that she would end the war tomorrow if she
could," Clinton told a student who asked
about troop withdrawals in Iraq.
But she said an immediate withdrawal
was not fully feasible, as many troops have

Chelsea Clinton '01 made a campaign stop at Stanford yesterday evening, taking
questions about her mother's record on healthcare, Iraq and the Darfur genocide
in the Pi Beta Phi lounge. She urged students to vote in California's Feb. 5 primary.
been killed in convoys. She said that
her mother would take 60 days upon
entering office to develop a plan to re
move not only the troops but also
American civilians stationed in Iraq.
"Unfortunately, the Bush adminis
tration has not been planning to end
the war ," she said. "A couple days ago.
President Bush reiterated that he
thinks the troops might be there for 10
years."
Chelsea Clinton also championed
her mother's emphasis on healthcare.
She said that Americans happy with
their current plans could keep them,
but the Congressional plan would be
opened up to the 47 million Americans
who are uninsured and millions more
who feel underinsured.
"[My mother] and Senator [John]
Edwards are committed to universal
healthcare," she said. "Senator
[Barack] Obama [D-11l ] is committed
to what we call 'virtual' universal
healthcare which would make it an op

tion for people to buy into the system.
What my mother argues is that if you
don't mandate that everyone have
healthcare, the healthy people may not
buy into the system, which means that
the average cost of insuring people is a
lot higher."
One student expressed concern
about the Darfur genocide.
"I'm really proud that my mom was
the first Democratic senator to call it a
genocide in May of 2004 and put a lot
of pressure on the Bush administra
tion to recognize it as a genocide,"
Clinton said.
She added that her mother has ad
vocated for a more direct American
role in negotiating a peace agreement,
as well as for pressuring China to stop
buying oil from the Sudan.
The meeting closed with a question
about the buzzword of the 21X)8 presi
dential election: Change.
"It seems like most of the candi
dates in this election have been talking

about how they are the candidate for
change," said Nicky Adamson '09,
president of Pi Beta Phi. "I low do you
think your mom would he the most
well equipped candidate for change?"
Chelsea Clinton defended her
mother's service record, championing
her experience as a lawyer, education
advocate, first lady and senator.
"I know that there is this dichoto
my between change and experience
that I think is really false and actually
find offensive," she said, "because I
think my mom has been an agent for
positive change in people's lives for
longer than I've been alive.
"I think it really matters what peo
ple have done in their lives,"she added.
"I don't know anyone who has done
more for more people, particularly
more young people and more young
women, than nw mom."
