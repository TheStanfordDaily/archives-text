## University sees rising revenues 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ITie University has released its 2007 fiscal year finan
cial results, which saw a nearly 77 percent increase in ex
cess revenues from last year. Total surplus revenues for
2007 totaled nearly $250 million,compared to $141 mil
lion in 2006.
According to Randy Livingston, vice president for
business affairs and chief financial officer, the spike in

University gains can be attributed to unexpected in
creases in several areas of the school's income.
"The excess of revenues over expenses was higher
than in |fiscal year] 2006 largely because current year
gifts and investment income exceeded our budget
plan," Livingston wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Health care revenue flowing to the School of Medicine
from the hospitals was also substantially above budget
plan. Operating expenses were close [to] the budget
plan levels."

With these areas of the budget exceeding expecta
tions, the University may now boast a net profit increase
of more than three-fourths. But even so. Livingston
noted that this increase in no way constitutes a blank
check by which funds could be allocated to wherever
the administration wants.
"Most of the excess of revenues over expenses sits in
restricted funds held by departments and programs
across the University," said Liv
ingston. "The University has over
30,000 different funds that each has
unique restrictions imposed by
donors or based on the source of rev
enues. Very little of the excess is held
centrally with flexibility to use it for
any purpose."

Livingston added that two princi
pal factors — timing differences on
gifts and the cost of facilities and capi
tal equipment — can tend to inflate
revenue statements. As many gifts are
expended over a number of years, they
can bring greater revenue early on and
then more expenses later. And in
terms of facilities and equipment, costs
for these are not. in accounting terms,
listed as "expenses" in statements.
"When we use operating revenue
to fund new facilities and capital
equipment, we'll appear to have an

excess of revenues over current ex
penses," he said.
Yet for the University, this an
nouncement of a substantial in
crease in excess funds may be ill
timed— it coincides directly with
both the yearly admissions process
and announcements by other top
universities, most notably Harvard
and Yale, that they will be dramati
cally increasing their commitments
to financial aid for students.
For the school's 2007 fiscal year fi
nancial report. Harvard reported ex

cess revenues of just over $30 mil
lion. With Stanford not following suit
on the financial aid increase, exactly
where the surplus funds will be put to
use and how that will reflect on the
University remains to be seen.
Livingston said he does not con
sider finances of this sort to be a
means of competition between
schools.
"The excess of revenues over ex
penses is not something that we view
as an important measure of universi
ty performance, and as a result, we

do not track how we compare to
other universities on this measure."
he said.
Olivia Puerta '08 expressed desire to
see some of the excess revenues
committed to better financial aid op
portunities for students.
"I think that's definitely some
thing that should be given considera
tion, and 1 am definitely in support of
greater financial aid." she said.
