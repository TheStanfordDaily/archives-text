January 13,1999: Condi,
ASSU talk policy issues
Provost Condoleezza Rice spoke
to the ASSU Senate last night on the
reasons for her departure from her
post in the spring, saying that she
wished to become reacquainted with
current events in her field.
Rice said that as a result of her
full-time job as provost she has
missed many of the changes in the
world economic and political situa
tions over the past six years. "I'm be
coming a dinosaur in my field," she
said.
Rice said she would take a three
year leave of absence from the
Provost's Office and her professor
ship to spend more time researching
the role that private institutions are
playing in restructuring internation
al economies. She is not sure in what
capacity she will be employed, but
she said she plans to return to Stan
ford after that time.
