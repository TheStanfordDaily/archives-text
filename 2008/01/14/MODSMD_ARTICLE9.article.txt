# Solar system service
## Student group installs solar panelling for low-income families 
### CHELSEA MA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cook, eat and help the impoverished. One new stu
dent organization harnesses the power of the sun
Hie first and only chapter of its kind. Stanford GRID fo
cuses on all things solar, from using solar ovens to make
brownies and cider, to their most intensive project: installing
solar panels on the homes of low-income families.
"It's really good hands-on experience, as you actually get
to be on the roof wiring and putting it together," said GRID

Co-president Lewis Horn 10, who founded the organiza
tion just this year. "Plus, you get that feeling of helping
out the community. It's pretty great."

The group teamed up with GRID Alternatives,a
San Francisco company that spearheaded the ef
fort to assist poorer neighborhoods by replacing

pricey electricity with renewable energy and
energy efficient services. This includes chang
ing light bulbs, distributing hot water blan-

kets and water heaters and installing other
resourceful measures in addition to solar

panels.
"I got involved with GRID because

I heard about GRID Alternatives a
couple of years ago, and found that it
wasn't just an installation company,"
said Megan Kerins, a first-year grad
uate student in Civil and Environ
mental Engineering. "I was amazed

by what they do because of the social implications lof their
work]."
According to Horn, solar systems cost from $14,000 to
$20,000 each. With the help of GRID and GRID Alterna
tives, families can have systems installed for as little as $5,000.
While this may still seem like a big chunk out of their pock
ets. they can save around $ 14.000 to $ 16,000 over the lifetime
of the system.
"The largest part of these families' salaries is spent on
electricity, and at the same time they are the least able to af
ford solar panels," Horn said. "The project is great because it
helps out the people who need solar power the most."
Stanford GRID does
n't plan on
break-

ing away from GRID Alternatives — at least, not anytime
soon. Meeting the costs of independently installing solar pan
els is still a hurdle, hut there are many fundraisers on the
table, including a "Salsa for Solar" dance that students can
anticipate in either late winter or early spring quarter.
"During our meetings we talk about fun fundraisers we
can do. but we have yet to get together as a group to do a
Stanford-only thing," Horn said." You know the organization
Habitat for Humanity? For now. we're kind of like that."
In the meantime,GßlD is working on piquing the curios
ity of other students in solar power, and the group has already
attracted more than 50 members. Last quarter,GßlD held a
training session in Old Union for anyone interested in learn
ing how to install solar panels. About 70 students showed up,
a turnout that suggests growing attention towards renew
able energy and its political, social and environmen
tal effects.

"To see all this interest was a wonderful
surprise," Kerins said. "It's unfortunate that
the country doesn't subsidize solar energy

as much as it does oil. We're very inter
ested in promoting its possibilities,
and hope more students will join."
Horn, too, wants to spread the
awareness.

"We just want to get
people in the Stanford commu
nity to go and learn more
about solar power," he said.
"We're growing a lot, and it d
be great to have more people
who care about these issues of
poverty and energy."
