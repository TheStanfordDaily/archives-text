1937 - 2007
Susan spent her whole lite enjoying California's Ray Area. A fourth generation
San Franciscan, her grandfather's home was in the same physical space that is
now occupied by the SF Opera House, but was destroyed in the 1906 tire and
earthquake. The family moved to their 'summer ranch' in the hills of Menlo
Park, where her father was raised and then attended Stanford University. Her
mother died in childbirth when Susan was an infant, and her father raised
Susan and her brother in Berkeley as a single parent.
Herself a single mother with 3 young boys, Susan triumphed in Palo Alto, rising
from entry-level secretary to become the Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies
and Research at Stanford. She always made space for having fun and enjoyed
playing adult league softball, volleyball and most of all soccer, as well as basking
in California's natural splendors.
Fler spirituality, like everything about Susan, was stubbornly independent,
graceful and uniquely her own. She embraced and interwove the teachings of
Quaker Christianity and Zen Buddhism with her own convictions. She often
remarked that the Lebanese author Khalil Gibran's shimmering work "The
Prophet" was like a Bible to her. Susan's inclusive attitude and trademark
"shoot-from-the-hip" sense of humor and wisdom touched a stunningly diverse
swathe of people. This in part blessed her with a circle of friends more wonder
ful than anyone could wish for. For this she was truly grateful.
She chose to be laid to rest with her brother, parents, grandparents and great
grandparents at the Home of Peace Cemetery, Colma.
Some people find charitable gifts are a helpful way to work through their grief.
Susan volunteered her own time for after-school kids' programs, animal shelters
and hospice programs. These causes would be an appropriate way to honor her
memory.
