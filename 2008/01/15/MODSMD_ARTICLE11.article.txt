### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford University, the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium and the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium Research Insti
tute announced last Wednesday
plans to create the Center for Ocean
Solutions,an organization which will
aim to protect the Earth's oceans. At
the Center, marine biologists will
discuss problems such as overfish
ing, the effects of global warming
and pollution.
Funded by a $25 million gift from
the David and Lucille Packard
Foundation and managed by Stan
ford's Woods Institute for the Envi

ronment, the Center will depart
from the norm in tackling ocean
problems, according to a Stanford
News Service press release.
The Center, which will be located in
Monterey Bay near the Monterey
Bay Aquarium and Stanford's I lop
kins Marine Station, will focus on so
lutions to the problems affecting
world oceans rather than just the
problems themselves.
"The oceans urgently deserve and
require our energy and focused
problem solving, not only for their in
herent value but also because human
populations depend on healthy and
functioning marine systems," said in
terim director Meg Caldwell in a
statement on the Center's Web site.
According to Caldwell, the Cen
ter is "committed to applying our
collective knowledge, experience
and capacity for innovation to ad
dressing the greatest challenges fac
ing our oceans."
