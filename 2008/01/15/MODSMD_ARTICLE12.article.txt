## Editorial Board Redefining financial aid 
### 
On the heels of Harvard's discontinua
tion of its early action policy in 2(X)6.
Princeton and the University of Vir
ginia quickly followed suit, echoing Har
vard's assertion that early admissions caters
to and rewards upper-income students who
often have assertive parents and well-con
nected school counselors. In late 2(X)7, Har
vard shook the college admissions world
once again with a new financial aid policy
that included "middle-class scholarships"
and multi-million dollar increases in finan
cial aid.The generous Harvard package caps
tuition liability at 10 percent of a family's in
come for those making under $180.(XX) a
year and at zero percent for families making
less than $60,000.1 larvard has also led a re
newed commitment to grant aid as opposed
to work-study responsibilities or student
loans.
Harvard's avant-garde financial policies
are challenging other schools, especially its
major academic rivals like Stanford, to
make similar, sizable changes to their aid
packages. It is the opinion of the Editorial
Board that Stanford should welcome this
challenge and rise to the task. As of now. the
financial aid office has announced signifi
cant increases to its financial aid outlays for
next year. Stanford's financial aid. however,
still lags behind.
Harvard is increasingly able to afford
these tuition breaks due to its enormous en
dowment, the largest in the country at $35
billion, which earned nearly $6 billion in in
terest just this past fiscal year. Even a frac
tion of the return on Harvard's investments
can pay the tuition costs for every student at
the Cambridge, Mass. school, allowing the
university to move towards its more liberal
financial aid policy.
In a Jan. 9 front-page article in The Stan
ford Daily. Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper was quoted as saying."l believe our
financial aid program is one of the strongest
in the country and we can all be proud of the
University's commitment to financial aid."

But should Stanford be content with having
a "strong program?"The University was or
ganized in 1891 on five founding principles
as elucidated by the Stanford's â€” one of
those five principles was free tuition. Grant
ed. times have changed (and so has the value
of the dollar) but have they changed all that
much? At the time, the University didn't
need to charge tuition because its endow
ment was so large. Now. the endowment
stands at a little more than $17 billion, the
third largest in the country.
Harvard's new aid packages, which have
been received almost entirely positively, are
likely to lead to some unforeseen conse
quences. If only the richest schools are able
to offer these tantalizing scholarships to
middle class students, the already hectic and
agonizing college admissions process will
most likely become all the more competi
tive. Some students might feel that the only
way to make college affordable for their
families is to attend one of the very selective
private schools that offer middle class schol
arships, ramping up the competition to yet
unhealthier levels.
Currently, there is discussion in Congress
over the alarming and rising costs of college
tuition,even relative to inflation. Some have
speculated that Harvard's adjustment in aid
policy was made in anticipation of eventual
Congressional mandates requiring colleges
to spend a portion of their endowments on
financial aid programs. But as Congress wa
vers to support new financial aid policies, in
the meantime many of Stanford's early ad
mits hesitate to commit to Stanford due to
financial concerns. Why not change Stan
ford's financial aid policy now?
Stanford should be a leader, not a follow
er, in this growing collegiate trend of finan
cial aid. If the day comes when the top pri
vate universities in the United States are ef
fectively free, we should be proud to say that
Stanford made sacrifices and shifted budget
priorities to make our education as afford
able as possible, as soon as it was possible.
