# Pleading Inanity
## Take me home 
### 
Over the past week, I have received a
torrent of angry letters from my
beloved hometown. One prominent
missive from our Mayor/Sheriff/6th-9th
grade teacher read in relevant part:"Vishnu-
Billy-Bob-Jyoshi-Rae, what's this the town
scribe tells me about you foul-mouthing one
of the first places to test-market the Big
Mac. the birthplace of George Marshall?
Have your forgotten your roots? What
would your mother/aunt/my sister say?"
To the dozens of literate residents of
Uniontown to whom I may have caused um
brage. I heartily apologize. In last week'scol
umn. I certainly failed to mention many of
the splendors that have recently graced our
land. For instance, our obsolete Wal-Mart is
being superseded by a Super-Wal-Mart! In
addition, our culinary options are evolving,
shifting from the grungy Denny's and Eat N'
Park to the high-browTGI-Fridays and Ap
plebee's. What's more, just last year we in
stalled a new-fangled traffic light to keep the
sheriff/mayor/teacher's car from colliding
with and injuring both the horse n' buggies
and peasant-led rickshaws that traverse our
stone passageways. (By next year, we hope
to get electricity running to the thang so it'll
look purty for Christmas.)
In all seriousness, though, folks, there's a
lot about my small town that I love. For in
stance, over the break when three inches of
snow fell onto my parents' driveway the
morning after New Year's, the neighbors
came over with their snow-blower to help us
out. They realized that my parents couldn't
clear it on their own and that my mom had to
go to work that day. So as the generous peo
ple they are. they lent a helping hand, know
ing deep down that all my parents could give
them in return was their gratitude (and ex
perimental prescription drugs and clean sy
ringes from my mom's office).
What's more.even I.the infrequent inter
loper in the town that Henry Beeson found
ed on July 4.1776, am always the recipient of
unconditional affection when I visit. l\vo
years ago I went to my mom's colleague's
house for dinner, and she made this ab
solutely divine caramel marshmallow treat.
After noticing my gluttonous affection for
the dish — I may have mouth-frothingly bit
the hand that tried to take the plate from me

— she decided from then on that every time
1 visited she would bake me the scrumptious
dessert. (She also decided to make sure she's
up to date on her rabies shots).
Now. I'm not saying that there is no kind
ness to be found in upper-middle class sub
urbia. and the sheer number of people in
megalopolises such as New York may make
neighborly friendliness impractical. More
over. any denizen of a place like "Redstone
town" knows that there are also many less
sanguine characteristics of the boonie
lifestyle. For example, my high school was
completely devoid of diversity, and those
who were different — such as myself —
were often barraged with insults and jeers.
Rarely were we allowed to taste the dank
sweetness that is affectionately termed
"white trash." And as to novel ideas and
atypical methods of having fun. forget about
it. Although it's making headway in Califor
nia — as I learned last semester in Animal
Law — 1 can guarantee you that bestiality
will never be legal in Uniontown.
The most troubling question for me. when
all is said and done: is whether the ups and
downs of small-town life are inherently con
nected. Is not taking care of outsiders an essen
tial part of taking care of community mem
bers? Is the rejection of post-modern confu
sion intrinsic to living a traditional happy life?
It's not easy. It's not easy *lump in throat*
and I wouldn't be talking about this if I did
n't passionately believe it was the right thing
to do *lip quiver.* I have so many opportu
nities from Uniontown.and I just don't want
to see it fall backwards *sniff.* This is very
personal for me. It's about our kid's future,
and it's really about all of us. together.
Hold me.
