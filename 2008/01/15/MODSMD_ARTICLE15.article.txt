# Fish Out of Water
## Go green 
### 
It's tough living in big fish states like Cali
fornia. While lowans and New Hamp
shire residents get people like Edwards
and Huckabee begging to eat at their kitchen
tables, the rest of the country is left eating the
scraps vis-a-vis Chris Matthews media
mouthpieces.
Tired of feeling like a second class-citizen,
I went searching for a forum where candi
dates would give my vote the respect and at
tention it truly deserves.
Fortunately, last weekend the Green
Party decided to hold a presidential debate
right next door in San Francisco. Even more
fortunate was the debates sub-title: "The
Only Presidential Debate that Matters."
While the rest of the United States has
been blabbering on about the heated Clin
ton-Obama race, the Green Party has secret
ly been building its own electoral drama sure
to knock established candidates out of the
water. Or at least off the front pages.
Sure. Republicans and Democrats alike
have been busy spewing out the word
'change' and showing off the most eclectic
group of candidates to date. But c'mon, the
Green Party invented the word 'change.'
And as for their nominees? Well let's just say
they make a former evangelical minister, an
ex-first lady and a half-Kenyan look pedes
trian.
Of the six Green Party members who
have declared their presidential candidacy,
five were at the debate. Cynthia McKinney,
the nation's first black congresswoman.
rounded out a troop of four other candidates
who are a bit, shall we say, lesser-known: Kent
Mesplay, an eighth grade teacher: Jared Ball,
a hip-hop scholar; Kat Swift, a 34-year-old ac
tivist who looks old enough to be my younger
sister; and the filmmaker Jesse Johnson
whose resume highlights include a pirate
stint in the movie "Hook," a turn as a West
Virginia country line dance instructor and
time spent designing floral arrangements for
CBS Morning News.
And you thought Dennis Kucinich was
unelectable.
In spite of such obstacles as experience,
support for the candidates remained high
Sunday afternoon at the Herbst Theatre in
downtown San Francisco. Crunchy college
kids handed out flyers on the sidewalk, chip
per folk music played on loudspeakers and
Green staff members passed out index cards
for audience members to write down their
questions for the candidates.

I could almost see the cornfields in the
background.
The debate started with moderated ques
tions from both journalists and the audience.
McKinney. who had a male escort lead her
across the stage to the debate table, quickly
stood out from the rest of the pack with her
bright red shawl, diamond jewelry and abili
ty to deliver a decent speech without reading
from note cards.
All five candidates, however, were equal
ly enthusiastic about their anti-war and pro
marijuana legalization views, agreeing with
each other to the point of nausea.
While early into the event the candidates
called repeatedly for more real debates, by
the end, at least one candidate had conceded
that this particular debate could better be
characterized as a "discussion."
Or a pep rally. Mesplay began his opening
remarks by invoking a repeated "Yes, we
can!" from the audience. And when McKin
ney name-dropped "organic farming," the
California audience almost peed its pants.
Things looked like they might go awry
when Johnson — to emphasize one of his

points — pulled a book out of his pocket and
raised it up to the audience ardently. There
was an awkward pause as the audience won
dered what the hell a Bible was doing on the
stage of a Green presidential debate.
"It's the Constitution," Johnson declared.
ITie audience laughed nervously in relief.
By the end of the afternoon, all the candi
dates were so damn polite that they effective
ly agreed to hand over the nomination to
McKinney. Even three hecklers, who disrupt
ed the debate with political outbursts, were
lauded by the moderator for truly keeping
the event"public
My only consolation for the debate's mo
notony came from the woman in front of
me, whose loud harrumphs on issues such as
the deficit and the loss of three million jobs
punctuated the time she spent playing on
her iPhone. Unfortunately, the woman left
too soon to hear one of the candidates sup
port new socialist government programs,
which would sacrifice superfluous luxuries
like cell phones to bridge the socioeconom
ic divide.
While the irony may have been lost on
her. my appreciation of it was enough for the
both of us.
Bring on Hillary's tears and Obama's
childhood cocaine use. As long as there's a
writers' strike, who doesn't love an electoral
media charade?
