# HOME PLAY STARTS
## No. 6 Stanford will play in Burnham for the first time this season tonight against UCSC 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Coming into its first home match of the
season, the No. 6 Stanford men's volleyball
team is off to its best start in six years. 'ITie
last time the Cardinal won three of its first
four games was in January of 2002.The men
will try to make it four of five when they
host Division 111 UC-Santa Cruz tonight in
Burnham Pavilion.
"Santa Cruz is a good team and they al
ways bring their 'A' game when they play

us," head coach John Kosty said. "We are ex
cited to host the match and look forward to
a battle."
Stanford (3-1, 1-1 MPSF) split a pair of
matches on the road last weekend, failing in
four games to No. 4 UCLA before besting
defending national champion and seventh
ranked UC-Irvine for the second time in
two weeks, also in four games.
Sophomore right side hitter Evan
Romero had a match-high 22 kills in the loss
to the Bruins, while senior outside hitter
Matt Ceran added 11. Against Irvine, it was

Ceran leading the way with 18 kills while
Romero was second with 13.
The Cardinal is off to a good start in
2008, but there is still plenty to work on as
the MPSF season gets underway.
"One of the things coming out of the
weekend was that we need to improve the
consistency of our sideout game," Kosty
said."When we were winning this weekend,
our sideout was really eood. but when we

bAME NO!h The Cardinal split its opening weekend
of MPSF play in Southern California and will play at
home for the first time tonight. Following the midweek
tilt with the Banana Slugs, a Division 111 team, the Car
dinal will host two conference foes including the sec
ond-ranked team in the nation, Pepperdine, over the
weekend. After being ranked fifth in the AVCA poll last
week, the Cardinal is now sixth in the nation and fifth
in the MPSF

dropped behind, our sideout strug
gled. That will happen at times and I
thought that in game four of the
Irvine match, we tightened up our
belts and played well to come back
and win that game and that match."
Kosty also pointed to the service
game as an area for improvement.
Four players combined for ten aces
in last weekend's matches, but the
team also missed 31 serves, an entire
game's worth of points.
"We have the ability to score a
fair amount of points off of our
serve," Kosty said. "But we definitely
need to be more consistent in that as
pect of our game."
The Banana Slugs (2-2) come into

tonight's match on a two-game win
ning streak after back-to-back
sweeps of SUNY New Paltz and
Holy Names. Senior outside hitter
Brian Shires and junior outside
Brice Dahlmeier lead the team with
44 kills on the season.
ITie Cardinal last faced Santa
Cruz early in the 2(X)6 season, which
resulted in a three-game Stanford
sweep.
One of the most glaring differ
ences between the two teams is their
relative size — the tallest player on
the Santa Cruz team is six-foot-four,
while the Cardinal roster boasts four
players listed at six-foot-seven and
five more at six-foot-six.
One of the biggest will not be on
the court for the Cardinal, though, as
freshman outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin sprained his ankle on
Saturday. But even without McLach
lin. the Stanford front line will have a

sizeable advantage.
"It can be both good and bad,"
Kosty said. "Smaller teams tend to
be quicker and run faster offenses,
especially from the middle. We don't
see that an awful lot and it can be an
advantage.
"To nullify that advantage,we will
need our service game to be on. so
we can put them in situations where
their middle is no longer a factor and
we can concentrate on their out
sides."
Tonight's match is at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. After that, the
players will have only a few days to
rest before returning to MPSF action
this weekend. The Cardinal will host
No. 11 Southern California on Friday
and then face second-ranked Pep
perdine on Saturday.
