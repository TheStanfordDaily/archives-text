## Running backs enter Draft race 
### 
Since the beginning of the new year, a
number of underclassmen have declared
for the NFL Draft. Already. 44 juniors
have announced their intentions to leave col
lege football behind — if five more declare,
there will be more underclassmen in the 2008
Draft than any other in this millennium.This
influx of juniors has transformed the running
back class from a fairly weak one to one of the
deepest in recent memory.
Before any underclassmen declared.
Michigan's Mike Hart, Georgia Tech's
Tashard Choice and East Carolina's Chris
Johnson headlined the position, but besides
them and a few others,there was little depth at
running back. Many entered their names for
consideration, but due to injuries, poor mea
surables and inconsistent statistical totals,
most were projected either as late-round
picks or as undrafted free agents.
But then the cavalry arrived.
Over the past few weeks, nine junior run
ning backs have declared for the NFL Draft,
and all are expected to be high draft picks. All
of a sudden. Hart and Choice (not Johnson,
though, who ran a remarkable 4.20 40-yard
dash, which will bump him up the draft
boards) went from being at the top of their
class to the middle of it, with little chance of
moving up.
The top running back by overwhelming
consensus is Arkansas's Darren McFadden.
who finished second in the I leisman Trophy
voting this year for the second season in a row.
He has been favorably compared to all-world
Chargers running back LaDanian Tomlinson
and Minnesota star rookie Adrian Peterson.
McFadden won't drop past the fifth pick, and
it's doubtful he will still be available even then
(he may go first overall).
The Arkansas program is so good at churn
ing out tailbacks that McFadden's backup,
Felix Jones, also declared and is a projected
first-round pick as well. Jones is an excellent
kick returner, and, in limited action, has
proven to be a dangerous running back. Over
his three college seasons, he averaged, in
order, a mind-boggling 6.3, 7.6 and 8.7 yards
per carry. A good NFL average is 4 YPC —
anything above 5 is special.
Joining the two Arkansas backs are Illi
nois' Rashard Mendenhall, who single-hand-
