## Running backs enter Draft race 
### 
Since the beginning of the new year, a
number of underclassmen have declared
for the NFL Draft. Already. 44 juniors
have announced their intentions to leave col
lege football behind — if five more declare,
there will be more underclassmen in the 2008
Draft than any other in this millennium.This
influx of juniors has transformed the running
back class from a fairly weak one to one of the
deepest in recent memory.
Before any underclassmen declared.
Michigan's Mike Hart, Georgia Tech's
Tashard Choice and East Carolina's Chris
Johnson headlined the position, but besides
them and a few others,there was little depth at
running back. Many entered their names for
consideration, but due to injuries, poor mea
surables and inconsistent statistical totals,
most were projected either as late-round
picks or as undrafted free agents.
But then the cavalry arrived.
Over the past few weeks, nine junior run
ning backs have declared for the NFL Draft,
and all are expected to be high draft picks. All
of a sudden. Hart and Choice (not Johnson,
though, who ran a remarkable 4.20 40-yard
dash, which will bump him up the draft
boards) went from being at the top of their
class to the middle of it, with little chance of
moving up.
The top running back by overwhelming
consensus is Arkansas's Darren McFadden.
who finished second in the I leisman Trophy
voting this year for the second season in a row.
He has been favorably compared to all-world
Chargers running back LaDanian Tomlinson
and Minnesota star rookie Adrian Peterson.
McFadden won't drop past the fifth pick, and
it's doubtful he will still be available even then
(he may go first overall).
The Arkansas program is so good at churn
ing out tailbacks that McFadden's backup,
Felix Jones, also declared and is a projected
first-round pick as well. Jones is an excellent
kick returner, and, in limited action, has
proven to be a dangerous running back. Over
his three college seasons, he averaged, in
order, a mind-boggling 6.3, 7.6 and 8.7 yards
per carry. A good NFL average is 4 YPC —
anything above 5 is special.
Joining the two Arkansas backs are Illi
nois' Rashard Mendenhall, who single-hand-
edly carried the Fighting lllini to an
improbable BCS berth, and Oregon's
Jonathan Stewart, who rushed for 160
yards on only 19 carries against Stan
ford this year. Central Florida's Kevin
Smith led Division I in scoring (30
touchdowns) and rushing yards
(2,448, good for 188.31 yards per
game, which put him only 180 yards
short of Barry Sanders's single-sea
son rushing record).
Rounding out the juniors are

Texas' Jamaal Charles, the Long
horns' work horse; Rutgers' Ray Rice
and West Virginia's Steve Slaton, two
preseason Heisman favorites; and
Clemson's James Davis, a consistent
back who was one of the ACC's most
dangerous threats over the past two
seasons. All of the underclassmen
should go within the first three
rounds, which pushes seniors like
Hart and Choice down into the mid
rounds.
But with so many talented hacks
available, a question arises: is there
room for all of them in the NFL? So
many teams seem set at the position,
so why would they take a running
back high in the draft when they can

address a more pressing need'.'
The truth is, there are no longer 32
feature back roles. In today's NFL,
there are 64 of them.The NFL has de
veloped into a two-back league where
carries are split. Many teams employ
a bruising back that can explode into
the hole and a smaller, shiftier back
that can take sweeps around the out
side and catch passes out of the back
field.
For proof, look no further than
three of the four remaining teams in
the NFL playoffs: the Chargers use
both Tomlinson and Michael Turner
— who is so valuable to the offense
that, despite numerous trade offers
for him last year. General Manager

A.J. Smith said that he wouldn't trade
Turner for anything less than a first
and third-round pick. The Patriots
have Lawrence Maroney, a hard run
ner, and Kevin Faulk, a third-down
specialist who is one of the best re
ceiving backs in NFL history.
The Giants actually have four
good running backs on their roster:
starter Brandon Jacobs, a physical
freak who stands at six-foot-four,
weighs in at 265 pounds and yet runs
a 4.4 40-yard dash and averaged close
to 100 rushing yards a game: rookie
Ahmad Bradshaw, who hits the hole
as quick as any back in the league and
rarely goes down at first contact;
Rueben Droughns, who has rushed

for over 1,000 yards twice in his ca
reer; and Derrick Ward, who is cur
rently on injured reserve but started
earlier in the year and was a reliable
pass catcher and runner.
Many other teams have the same
two-back strategy, which bodes well
for the top of the 2008 running back
draft class. For assurance, they need
only look back to last year. Minnesota
had the seventh pick in the 2007 draft
and a reliable veteran in Chester Tay
lor, who had rushed for 1,216 yards in
2(X)6. Adrian Peterson wasn't sup
posed to drop past the top five, but he
did and Minnesota pounced on him.
The result? Peterson broke the
single-game rushing record in only his

ninth career game, was the AP Offen
sive Rookie of the Year and was an
early MVP contender before he got
injured.Taylor didn't reach the 1.000-
yard mark again, but he tallied 844
yards on an impressive 5.4 yards per
carry average. The two backs nearly
carried the Vikings to a playoff berth
despite the inconsistent, and at times
horrid, play of their quarterback.
There's room for everyone at the
NFL's running back table — every
one can, and is expected to, con
tribute.

there will be more underclassmen in the 2008
Draft than any other in this millennium.This
influx of juniors has transformed the running
back class from a fairly weak one to one of the
deepest in recent memory.
Before any underclassmen declared.
Michigan's Mike Hart, Georgia Tech's
Tashard Choice and East Carolina's Chris
Johnson headlined the position, but besides
them and a few others,there was little depth at
running back. Many entered their names for
consideration, but due to injuries, poor mea
surables and inconsistent statistical totals,
most were projected either as late-round
picks or as undrafted free agents.
But then the cavalry arrived.
Over the past few weeks, nine junior run
ning backs have declared for the NFL Draft,
and all are expected to be high draft picks. All
of a sudden. Hart and Choice (not Johnson,
though, who ran a remarkable 4.20 40-yard
dash, which will bump him up the draft
boards) went from being at the top of their
class to the middle of it, with little chance of
moving up.
The top running back by overwhelming
consensus is Arkansas's Darren McFadden.
who finished second in the I leisman Trophy
voting this year for the second season in a row.
He has been favorably compared to all-world
Chargers running back LaDanian Tomlinson
and Minnesota star rookie Adrian Peterson.
McFadden won't drop past the fifth pick, and
it's doubtful he will still be available even then
(he may go first overall).
The Arkansas program is so good at churn
ing out tailbacks that McFadden's backup,
Felix Jones, also declared and is a projected
first-round pick as well. Jones is an excellent
kick returner, and, in limited action, has
proven to be a dangerous running back. Over
his three college seasons, he averaged, in
order, a mind-boggling 6.3, 7.6 and 8.7 yards
per carry. A good NFL average is 4 YPC —
anything above 5 is special.
Joining the two Arkansas backs are Illi
nois' Rashard Mendenhall, who single-hand-
edly carried the Fighting lllini to an
improbable BCS berth, and Oregon's
Jonathan Stewart, who rushed for 160
yards on only 19 carries against Stan
ford this year. Central Florida's Kevin
Smith led Division I in scoring (30
touchdowns) and rushing yards
(2,448, good for 188.31 yards per
game, which put him only 180 yards
short of Barry Sanders's single-sea
son rushing record).
Rounding out the juniors are

Texas' Jamaal Charles, the Long
horns' work horse; Rutgers' Ray Rice
and West Virginia's Steve Slaton, two
preseason Heisman favorites; and
Clemson's James Davis, a consistent
back who was one of the ACC's most
dangerous threats over the past two
seasons. All of the underclassmen
should go within the first three
rounds, which pushes seniors like
Hart and Choice down into the mid
rounds.
But with so many talented hacks
available, a question arises: is there
room for all of them in the NFL? So
many teams seem set at the position,
so why would they take a running
back high in the draft when they can

address a more pressing need'.'
The truth is, there are no longer 32
feature back roles. In today's NFL,
there are 64 of them.The NFL has de
veloped into a two-back league where
carries are split. Many teams employ
a bruising back that can explode into
the hole and a smaller, shiftier back
that can take sweeps around the out
side and catch passes out of the back
field.
For proof, look no further than
three of the four remaining teams in
the NFL playoffs: the Chargers use
both Tomlinson and Michael Turner
— who is so valuable to the offense
that, despite numerous trade offers
for him last year. General Manager

A.J. Smith said that he wouldn't trade
Turner for anything less than a first
and third-round pick. The Patriots
have Lawrence Maroney, a hard run
ner, and Kevin Faulk, a third-down
specialist who is one of the best re
ceiving backs in NFL history.
The Giants actually have four
good running backs on their roster:
starter Brandon Jacobs, a physical
freak who stands at six-foot-four,
weighs in at 265 pounds and yet runs
a 4.4 40-yard dash and averaged close
to 100 rushing yards a game: rookie
Ahmad Bradshaw, who hits the hole
as quick as any back in the league and
rarely goes down at first contact;
Rueben Droughns, who has rushed

for over 1,000 yards twice in his ca
reer; and Derrick Ward, who is cur
rently on injured reserve but started
earlier in the year and was a reliable
pass catcher and runner.
Many other teams have the same
two-back strategy, which bodes well
for the top of the 2008 running back
draft class. For assurance, they need
only look back to last year. Minnesota
had the seventh pick in the 2007 draft
and a reliable veteran in Chester Tay
lor, who had rushed for 1,216 yards in
2(X)6. Adrian Peterson wasn't sup
posed to drop past the top five, but he
did and Minnesota pounced on him.
The result? Peterson broke the
single-game rushing record in only his

ninth career game, was the AP Offen
sive Rookie of the Year and was an
early MVP contender before he got
injured.Taylor didn't reach the 1.000-
yard mark again, but he tallied 844
yards on an impressive 5.4 yards per
carry average. The two backs nearly
carried the Vikings to a playoff berth
despite the inconsistent, and at times
horrid, play of their quarterback.
There's room for everyone at the
NFL's running back table — every
one can, and is expected to, con
tribute.
