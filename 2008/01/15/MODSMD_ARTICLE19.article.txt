Junior Nicole Ourada was the Cardinal's top finisher in this weekend's meet and finished .225
behind Georgia's Courtney Kupets in the All-Around, with at least a 9.8 in each event.
The team also received a boost
from its favorable home atmosphere.
"Burnham Pavilion is a great place to
compete because the fans literally lift
the girls up and they really draw from
that energy," head coach Kristen
Smyth said.
The energy propelled the Card to
an early half-point lead after the first
rotation on vault.
Redshirt freshman Allyse Ishino
made her collegiate debut with a 9.9,
tying with Ourada for the team's
highest score.
"(Nicole] is one of our team cap
tains for the second year in a row."
Smyth said of Ourada. "Her consis
tency shows maturity and a seamless
transition into the new season."
Freshman Shelley Alexander also
made her collegiate debut on vault,
posting a solid 9.825.
"Competing against Georgia for
my first college competition was ab
solutely amazing," Ishino said. "Espe

cially knowing that we were compet
ing against the best in the nation."
The Bulldogs certainly did not in
timidate Ishino, who followed her
stellar routine on vault with the
team's highest score on bars, 9.875.
Sophomore Carly Janiga and
Ourada increased the difficulty of
their routines by adding theTkachev,
a major release move that should add
depth throughout the season and be a
huge help at nationals with big scores.
Even this was not enough to fend off
Georgia, though. In the second rota
tion. the Bulldogs pulled ahead on
vault led by Courtney Kupets with a
score of 9.925.
Trailing after the first two rota
tions, the Cardinal moved onto beam,
an apparatus that has been one of the
team's best events.
Janiga's two new big skills, includ
ing a Full Twisting Swingdown. im
pressed the judges — she received
the Cardinal's highest score on beam
with a 9.9.
On the fourth and final event,
floor exercise.junior Kelly Fee led the
Cardinal with a score of 9.850. Sopho
more Tenaya West also made her col
lege debut on the floor with a hieh

impact tumbling routine.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal
gymnasts kept up their energy and
strength, even when the competition
got tough. The team hopes that the
promising results from Sunday's
competition will set the tone for the
rest of the year.
"We hit 23 out of 24 routines and
we didn't back down when things
weren't perfect," Ourada said of her
team's effort.
"We tend to do very well when we
enjoy every moment of each person's
routine," Ishino added.
Undeterred by the loss, coach
Smyth praised the competition.
"Georgia sets the standard for ex
cellence and it was a real pleasure to
have a team like that here and a good
test for our team," she said. "If we just
rush out the gate with hard skill selec
tion. it's harder to maintain that pace
throughout the season."
The Cardinal will return to the
gym when it faces the University of
Arizona this Sunday. Jan. 20 at 2:(X)
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
