## Salads, tofu among new choices at eatery

The Axe & Palm is going green.
Responding to student suggestions, the ASSU
worked with Stanford Dining to implement en
hancements to the campus' newest eatery by

providing more healthy options.

or mugs will receive a 10-cent dis-

count on their beverages.
The Axe & Palm has also expanded late night
programming, offering an assortment of mochas
on Mondays, trivia nights on Tuesdays and hip
hop sushi events. ASSU President Hershey
Avula "08 said the renewed emphasis on pro
gramming is part of a broader effort to shape Old
Union into a more leisurely student venue.
"1 look at students studying as a failure of Old
Union," Avula said. "It's supposed to be a recre
ational place rather than just another study
space."
The changes seem reminiscent of services pre
viously offered at the CoHo, which closed last
summer despite some students' protest to pre
serve the venue often regarded as a cozy meeting
place and performing arts space on campus. In an
attempt to emulate students' favorite aspects of
the CoHo, crepes will now be offered at the Axe
& Palm and live music will be performed on

Thursday nights.
The absence of some of these CoHo offerings
in part motivated the recent additions to the Axe
& Palm, Avula said. Students demanded the re
turn of crepes, which Avula said had originally
been taken off the menu because a smaller
kitchen space prevented the Old Union eatery

from preparing them for students.

More than 830 students, alum-

ni and staff members signed a peti-

112 tion delivered to administrators
last week calling for the reopen-

. ing of the CoHo in its original lo-

cation in Tresidder Union. But
Avula said the CoHo's return

could come at the expense of
some of the CoHo's traditional of-

ferings and character if an outside

vendor were to replace Stanford Din
ing in managing the facility.

"It could be very different
from the institution it used to he ,"
he said.

Many of the changes that have
been put into place at the Axe & Palm would
likely remain unaffected by the CoHo's reopen
ing, Avula said.
The most recent changes to the Axe & Palm
were made in response to student concerns
raised at a dining workgroup convened by the
ASSU last quarter. Avula said students "ex
pressed serious concern" about a lack of healthy
food alternatives for students, especially vegetar
ians. A vegetarian himself, Avula said he often
found himself with little to eat at the Axe & Palm.
Avula said he hopes the changes will improve
students' dining experiences and help mold Old
Union into the recreational center of campus.
"We are trying to create a more sophisticated
venue catering to the needs of students," Avula
said.
