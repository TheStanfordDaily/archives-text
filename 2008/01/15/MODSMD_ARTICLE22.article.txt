### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The last of the unbeatens are 1-2-3 in the Top 25 —
again. North Carolina. Memphis and Kansas, the only
Division I teams yet to lose this season, were the top
teams in ITie Associated Press' college basketball poll
for a seventh straight week Monday.
Arizona State moved in at No. 22, the Sun Devils'
first ranking since the final poll of the 1994-95 season.
North Carolina (17-0), which beat North Carolina
Asheville and North Carolina State last week, kept the
No. 1 ranking it has held since the preseason poll. The
Tar Heels received 45 first-place votes and 1,765 points
from the 72-member national media panel.
Memphis (15-0) beat East Carolina and Marshall in
its first two Conference USA games last week and the
Tigers were No. 1 on 24 ballots and had 1,739 points.
Kansas (16-0), which defeated Loyola (Md.) and
Nebraska last week, received three first-place votes.
Three teams lost for the first time last week —
Washington State, Vanderbilt and Mississippi — and
each dropped at least two places in the poll.
UCLA, which downed Washington State 81-74 on Sat
urday, moved up one spot to fourth and was followed
by Georgetown, Tennessee, Duke, Washington State,
Indiana and Texas A&M.
Michigan State, which lost 43-36 to lowa, dropped
five spots to 11th and was followed by Butler, Mar
quette, Dayton, Pittsburgh, Vanderbilt, Wisconsin,
Mississippi, Texas and Xavier.
The last five ranked teams were Miami, Arizona
State, Rhode Island, Clemson and Villanova.
Arizona State (13-2) moved into the rankings on a
nine-game winning streak that includes a 3-0 start in
the Pac-10. It is only the third time in their 30 years in
the conference the Sun Devils have started 3-0 and the

first time since 1987-88.
ASU coach Herb Sendek welcomed the ranking as
a sign that his rebuilding effort is paying oft. But he
said it's premature for Sun Devils fans to celebrate.
"It most certainly is an indication that we're making
progress," said Sendek, who went 8-22 last season, his
first inTempe.' But at the same time, 1 think we all rec
ognize that it's a real-time snapshot, and this early in
the season, especially this early in conference play,
those rankings tend to be very volatile."
The Sun Devils lost their season opener, 77-54 to
Illinois at the EA Sports Maui Invitational, and their
other loss was in their only true road game of the sea
son, 62-47 at Nebraska.The most impressive wins have
been over Xavier, Oregon and Arizona, a 64-59 over
time victory last week.
Arizona State is 11-0 at home this season after fin
ishing 7-11 there last season. The three conference
home wins are one-third the total the Sun Devils had
in the previous four seasons.
Freshman James Harden, Arizona State's first Mc-
Donald's All-American since 1984, leads the Sun Dev
ils in scoring (18.2) and is shooting 54.9 percent from
the field, including 44.7 from 3-point range. Arizona
State heads to Northern California this week for
games against California and Stanford.
Sendek said he's not worried about his players grow
ing complacent now that they're achieved a ranking.
"1 think our group has been really good, even last
year, about focusing on the task at hand, the next prac
tice. the next game." Sendek said.
Stanford (13-3) dropped out from No. 23 after beat
ing Oregon State 66-46 and losing 71-66 to Oregon last
week.The Cardinal were ranked in the preseason poll
and the first of the regular season then fell out for six
weeks before returning the past two weeks.
