## Panel talks Choice, religion 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Stanford Students for
Choice (SSfC) held a panel that presented
an alternative perspective on the relation
ship between religion and reproductive
rights in the context of the American Pro-
Choice movement. A panel of clergy and
religious leaders from Christianity, Ju
daism and Hinduism held a discussion on
how their respective religions affirm their
Pro-Choice beliefs.
"The intersection of Pro-Choice views
and religious ones is something that many

people are interested in understanding
better," said SSfC co-President Selena
Simmons-Duffin OS. "We hope that the
discussion will be fruitful inasmuch as it al
lows students to think more broadly about
the task of deciphering one's moral views
along with political and religious ones."
Dean of Religious Life Patricia Karlin-
Neumann explained that in Judaism, the
fetus is not considered an individual until
the baby's head is out of the womb.
"Abortion may be necessary depend
ing on the circumstances," she said. "The
life of the mother also takes precedence
over the baby."

Karlin-Neumann added that the Exo
dus 21:22-25 states that if a pregnant
woman has a miscarriage as a result of in
juries she receives during a fight between
two men, the penalty for the loss of the
fetus is a fine for the men. If the woman is
killed, the penalty is death. She explained
that the passage implied that men whose
fighting has caused a woman to miscarry
were not regarded as murderers because
they had not killed the woman. ITie
woman had greater moral and religious
worth than the fetus.
