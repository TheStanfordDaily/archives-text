## Panel talks Choice, religion 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Stanford Students for
Choice (SSfC) held a panel that presented
an alternative perspective on the relation
ship between religion and reproductive
rights in the context of the American Pro-
Choice movement. A panel of clergy and
religious leaders from Christianity, Ju
daism and Hinduism held a discussion on
how their respective religions affirm their
Pro-Choice beliefs.
"The intersection of Pro-Choice views
and religious ones is something that many

people are interested in understanding
better," said SSfC co-President Selena
Simmons-Duffin OS. "We hope that the
discussion will be fruitful inasmuch as it al
lows students to think more broadly about
the task of deciphering one's moral views
along with political and religious ones."
Dean of Religious Life Patricia Karlin-
Neumann explained that in Judaism, the
fetus is not considered an individual until
the baby's head is out of the womb.
"Abortion may be necessary depend
ing on the circumstances," she said. "The
life of the mother also takes precedence
over the baby."

Karlin-Neumann added that the Exo
dus 21:22-25 states that if a pregnant
woman has a miscarriage as a result of in
juries she receives during a fight between
two men, the penalty for the loss of the
fetus is a fine for the men. If the woman is
killed, the penalty is death. She explained
that the passage implied that men whose
fighting has caused a woman to miscarry
were not regarded as murderers because
they had not killed the woman. ITie
woman had greater moral and religious
worth than the fetus.

Somik Raha, an advisor for the Hindu Students Council, looks on as Dean of Religious Life Patricia Karlin-Neumann explains
what stance Judaism takes on the issue of abortion at an event last night hosted by Stanford Students for Choice.
"There is also more invested in
the living person than in life that is to
be created, so the mother takes
precedence," she added.
Reverend Coryl Lassen, Episco
pal Lutheran campus ministry's in
terim minister, agreed that it was dif
ficult to determine when the fetus be
comes a complete person. Howev
er, she explained that the physical re
ality of the situation of the mother
was an important aspect in determin
ing whether an abortion is appropri
ate.
"The woman obviously has to
think in physical terms," said Lassen.

"What is her calling? Will she be able
to provide for the child as she would
want to?"
Somik Kaha.a Management Science
and Engineering graduate student
and an advisor for the Hindu Stu
dents Council, agreed. He explained
that in the Hindu spiritual texts,
there are no direct references to
abortion but it is mentioned in the
constitutional and legal texts of the
time. He does not. however, consid
er those texts to be true Hinduism.
"The constitutional and legal, like
any legal document, are full of flaws
and mistakes and are not considered
to be true Hinduism by most schol
ars," he said.
Informed by religious tenets, some
people believe that the fetus is a per
son, and these people are often unal
terably opposed to abortion. Others,

meanwhile, believe that human life
does not begin at the moment of con
ception and that abortion is a permis
sible option. Raha explained that in
1 linduism. there is the concept of a
unity that connects all creations.
"Everyone is united on a divine
essence which goes beyond the sur
face differences," Raha said. "One
can assume that God is present in the
embryo and mother as well, but what
is right is to do best for both mother
and embryo according to each per
son's unique circumstances. 1 have a
problem with the blanket terms of
Pro-Choice or Pro-Life."
"The two polarized perspectives
don't have to be only way to see it."
Karlin-Neumann agreed.
Lassen added that many Pro-Life
supporters quote sections of the
Bible, namely Psalm 139 from the

Old Testament, us evidence of Bibli
cal writing against abortion. The
verse is about God knowing individ
uals before they were created.
"Most Christian scholars treat
that an as exception," Lassen said."lt
is about God's infinite abilities to
know you and is not a sound argu
ment to treat the unborn as a com
plete person."
On the whole, the three panelists
agreed that while they had different
reasons for supporting abortion,each
case should be treated individually
according to the circumstances.
"The worst time to think of ethical
issues is when you are in it." Raha
said. "Now is a good time to think
about where you stand on abortion."
