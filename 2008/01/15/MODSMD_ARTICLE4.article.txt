Number two.
Surprisingly, that's what
the Stanford women's tennis
team was ranked last week.
Number one.
That's how the Cardinal
squad played in the Las
Vegas desert over the week
end. dispatching any and all
doubts about the team before
the weekend.
Look out Georgia Tech,
look out UCLA — the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis
team is for real.
No doubles teams ranked
in the top 50? No problem.
Tty not one, but two. doubles
titles at the Freeman Memor
ial Women's Tennis Champi
onships this past weekend.

UP NEXT
UC-DAVIS

Only three singles players in the top 50?
Try four Cardinal players in the quarterfinals and one in the
semifinals of the top singles bracket. In fact, add on the flight two
singles consolation title for good measure.
Maybe junior Jessica Nguyen put it best: "I definitely think
we're playing as the top team in the country right now." she said.
After facing the nation's toughest opponents over the week
end. including top-ranked Georgia Tech and No. 3 UCLA, she
just might be right.
Senior Whitney Deason and Nguyen defeated North Caroli
na's Austin Smith and Katrina Tsang. 8-2, for the doubles cham
pionship.
