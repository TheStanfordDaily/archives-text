# Victory in Las Vegas

### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Number two.
Surprisingly, that's what
the Stanford women's tennis
team was ranked last week.
Number one.
That's how the Cardinal
squad played in the Las
Vegas desert over the week
end. dispatching any and all
doubts about the team before
the weekend.
Look out Georgia Tech,
look out UCLA — the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis
team is for real.
No doubles teams ranked
in the top 50? No problem.
Tty not one, but two. doubles
titles at the Freeman Memor
ial Women's Tennis Champi
onships this past weekend.

UP NEXT
UC-DAVIS

Only three singles players in the top 50?
Try four Cardinal players in the quarterfinals and one in the
semifinals of the top singles bracket. In fact, add on the flight two
singles consolation title for good measure.
Maybe junior Jessica Nguyen put it best: "I definitely think
we're playing as the top team in the country right now." she said.
After facing the nation's toughest opponents over the week
end. including top-ranked Georgia Tech and No. 3 UCLA, she
just might be right.
Senior Whitney Deason and Nguyen defeated North Caroli
na's Austin Smith and Katrina Tsang. 8-2, for the doubles cham
pionship.

weekend. Whitney Deason and Jessica
Nguyen won in the top flight and Lejlo Hodzic fl
and Jennifer Yen took the top spot in the sec- I
ond flight. Hodzic also took the title in second 11

host UC-Davis in its first dual-meet action of the
year in two weeks.

Senior Whitney Deason and her doubles partner junior Jessica Nguyen won the top flight doubles competition at
the Freeman Invitational in Las Vegas last weekend with an 8-2 victory over a North Carolina pair in the final.
"I felt like we were both playing
very solidjlyj and our games comple
mented one another" Nguyen said.
"We have great chemistry on the
court, so it was great to play great
teams and come up with shots and
strategies that worked in our favor
against these tough opponents."
From their performance, it was not
obvious that this was the first time in
two years that Deason and Nguyen
had played together.
"I think we both thought it would
be difficult, but once we got onto the
court it was easier going from Friday
to Sunday," Nguyen said."lt was more
of a progression. Our comfort level in
creased quite a bit and we were able
to familiarize ourselves on the court.
After about five matches, you can tell
that we just improved a lot in that
time allowed."
"Hopefully we'll be able to play
with each other in the future and con
tinue to improve together," Nguyen
added.
Mirroring the success of Nguyen
and Deason, the duo of senior Lejla
Hodzic and freshman Jennifer Yen
prevailed in an 8-4 decision over Ari
zona State's Ashlee Brown and Lau
ren Megale for the flight two doubles
crown.
With two doubles titles on the
weekend, the Cardinal lineup appears
to be in top form heading into dual
match play.
"I don't think doubles is at all a
weakness of the team," head coach

Lele Forood said. "We didn't get any
[duos] ranked partly because we're
trying out some different combina
tions, so we didn't have people who
played enough together to get them
selves ranked. 1 think that we have a
lot of good doubles players and hope
fully going forward that'll be an area
of strength for us."
The Cardinal also showed great
strength in singles play as well.
Hodzic capped off a tremendous
weekend with the flight two consola
tion singles title in a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over Arizona State's Amanda Martin.
Meanwhile, all four Stanford play
ers in the main singles draw made the
quarterfinals, including senior Celia
Durkin, Deason. Nguyen and fresh
man Hilary Barte.
In the quarters, third-seeded
Nguyen, who is ranked 21st in the na
tion in singles, dropped a 6-3,6-2 deci
sion to (JSC's Fink, who would even
tually take home the singles title.
Deason reached the semifinals
with a 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 upset of Georgia
Tech's Whitney MeCray, but fell 6-7,
6-3, 6-0 to North Carolina's Katrina
Tsang. It marked the end of a busy
tournament for Deason, with all four
singles matches going to three sets.
Overall, the Cardinal shone once
again in the desert.
"It was a great showing," Forood
said. "1 want to be very clear that 1
thought we had a good tournament.
We had a few winnable matches that
we didn't quite get done in the singles

but overall I'm actually quite happy."
Still. Forood is hesitant to label her
team as the best in the nation.
"Well, basically, whoever wins the
Indoors is the best team in the country
and whoever gets to the finals is the
second best team," Forood said. "So
we'll see when that's decided where
we're at."
Until then, the Card must prepare
for the dual-match season and solidi
fy its lineup, especially by finalizing its
doubles unit.
"The important thing is that no
matter who plays together finally, just
the success of winning tournaments
makes the person individually feel
very good and strong about their own
doubles skills," Forood said. "I saw
enough to think that we're in pretty
good shape now and I know that in
two weeks time when we start duals,
we'll be in very good shape."
After a convincing weekend. Stan
ford appears to be headed back into
title contention.
"We know what it takes to win."
Forood said. "We have a lot of upper
class people who do know what it
takes. I think that as our performanc
es continue to go well, our confi
dence will continue to increase.
1 lopefully when we put on good per
formances at the Indoors that'll just
make us feel even better about our
chances."

Number two.
Surprisingly, that's what
the Stanford women's tennis
team was ranked last week.
Number one.
That's how the Cardinal
squad played in the Las
Vegas desert over the week
end. dispatching any and all
doubts about the team before
the weekend.
Look out Georgia Tech,
look out UCLA — the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis
team is for real.
No doubles teams ranked
in the top 50? No problem.
Tty not one, but two. doubles
titles at the Freeman Memor
ial Women's Tennis Champi
onships this past weekend.

UP NEXT
UC-DAVIS

Only three singles players in the top 50?
Try four Cardinal players in the quarterfinals and one in the
semifinals of the top singles bracket. In fact, add on the flight two
singles consolation title for good measure.
Maybe junior Jessica Nguyen put it best: "I definitely think
we're playing as the top team in the country right now." she said.
After facing the nation's toughest opponents over the week
end. including top-ranked Georgia Tech and No. 3 UCLA, she
just might be right.
Senior Whitney Deason and Nguyen defeated North Caroli
na's Austin Smith and Katrina Tsang. 8-2, for the doubles cham
pionship.

Senior Whitney Deason and her doubles partner junior Jessica Nguyen won the top flight doubles competition at
the Freeman Invitational in Las Vegas last weekend with an 8-2 victory over a North Carolina pair in the final.
"I felt like we were both playing
very solidjlyj and our games comple
mented one another" Nguyen said.
"We have great chemistry on the
court, so it was great to play great
teams and come up with shots and
strategies that worked in our favor
against these tough opponents."
From their performance, it was not
obvious that this was the first time in
two years that Deason and Nguyen
had played together.
"I think we both thought it would
be difficult, but once we got onto the
court it was easier going from Friday
to Sunday," Nguyen said."lt was more
of a progression. Our comfort level in
creased quite a bit and we were able
to familiarize ourselves on the court.
After about five matches, you can tell
that we just improved a lot in that
time allowed."
"Hopefully we'll be able to play
with each other in the future and con
tinue to improve together," Nguyen
added.
Mirroring the success of Nguyen
and Deason, the duo of senior Lejla
Hodzic and freshman Jennifer Yen
prevailed in an 8-4 decision over Ari
zona State's Ashlee Brown and Lau
ren Megale for the flight two doubles
crown.
With two doubles titles on the
weekend, the Cardinal lineup appears
to be in top form heading into dual
match play.
"I don't think doubles is at all a
weakness of the team," head coach

Lele Forood said. "We didn't get any
[duos] ranked partly because we're
trying out some different combina
tions, so we didn't have people who
played enough together to get them
selves ranked. 1 think that we have a
lot of good doubles players and hope
fully going forward that'll be an area
of strength for us."
The Cardinal also showed great
strength in singles play as well.
Hodzic capped off a tremendous
weekend with the flight two consola
tion singles title in a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over Arizona State's Amanda Martin.
Meanwhile, all four Stanford play
ers in the main singles draw made the
quarterfinals, including senior Celia
Durkin, Deason. Nguyen and fresh
man Hilary Barte.
In the quarters, third-seeded
Nguyen, who is ranked 21st in the na
tion in singles, dropped a 6-3,6-2 deci
sion to (JSC's Fink, who would even
tually take home the singles title.
Deason reached the semifinals
with a 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 upset of Georgia
Tech's Whitney MeCray, but fell 6-7,
6-3, 6-0 to North Carolina's Katrina
Tsang. It marked the end of a busy
tournament for Deason, with all four
singles matches going to three sets.
Overall, the Cardinal shone once
again in the desert.
"It was a great showing," Forood
said. "1 want to be very clear that 1
thought we had a good tournament.
We had a few winnable matches that
we didn't quite get done in the singles

but overall I'm actually quite happy."
Still. Forood is hesitant to label her
team as the best in the nation.
"Well, basically, whoever wins the
Indoors is the best team in the country
and whoever gets to the finals is the
second best team," Forood said. "So
we'll see when that's decided where
we're at."
Until then, the Card must prepare
for the dual-match season and solidi
