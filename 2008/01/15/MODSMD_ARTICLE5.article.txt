## Film tackles gender issues in India Documentary explores female infanticide, underlying causes 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Award-winning BBC documentary film
maker Ashok Prasad screened his documentary
"India's Missing Girls" last night in Tresidder
Union. Following the film, he spoke with the au
dience of more than 100 students and faculty
members.
While the documentary has been shown
throughout the U.K. and Europe, it had never
been publicly screened in the U.S., leading
Prasad to lightly announce that last night was
the "premiere of this film in the [United]
States."
ITie 45-minute documentary was inspired by
the widely-publicized discovery of an infant girl
buried alive by her grandfather in South India
last year. Prasad, on an assignment from the
BBC, spent six weeks uncovering the pervasive
trend of female infanticide and feticide in India.
Throughout the film. Prasad explored the
reasons for the Indian population's preference
for male children. One reason, he
said, is the dowry system.
"Though dowries are legally
banned, they still occur," Prasad ex
plained in the film. "For a poor (ami
ly, one daughter's dowry may be two
to three years' worth of earnings."
In addition, while female off
spring leave the family once they
marry, males help support the fami
ly and are able to continue the fam
ily name.
The film's emotional power de
rived mainly from its focus on a cen -
tral character, Sandhya. the founder
of the Aarti Home which is a home
in the rural South India town of
Kadapa for abandoned children
the overwhelming majority of
whom are female.
The film focuses on a number of
situations and difficulties that
Sandhya faces: a pregnant woman
who unhappily carried a girl and
wanted to give the baby to Aarti
Home; a woman whose wealthy
husband forced her to abort a third
female daughter despite having the
money to raise such a child; and a
premature baby girl who was mys
teriously abandoned by her grand

parents.
"It is usually the second, third or
fourth female child in a family that
is aborted or abandoned," Prasad
said in a question and answer ses
sion following the screening.
"Technology has added onto the
problem," he said.
Ultrasounds, which are generally
used to detect fetal viability and ab
normalities, are mainly used in
India to determine fetal sex. This
has led to the rise of a large number
of "ultrasound clinics" in India,
which are often a front for abortion
clinics.
In one particularly memorable
and graphic portion of the film,
footage was shown of a number of
aborted female fetuses being re
trieved from a well behind an ultra
sound clinic.
"It's shocking that such things
still happen in 2008," said Mika
Wang *11.
Prasad hopes that PBS will pick
up and air the documentary in the
U.S.
"1 also sent a copy of this film to
the president of India, who happens
to be the first female president,"
Prasad said during the presenta
tion. "Hopefully she will see it and
decide to air it in India."
