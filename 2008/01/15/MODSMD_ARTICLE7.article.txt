## Clinton, Obama step back from racial controversy 
### DAVID ESPO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Democratic presidential rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Barack Obama stepped back from a controversy over race
Monday night, agreeing that a prolonged clash over civil rights
could harm their party's overall drive to win the White House.
The two leading Democratic contenders shifted course as
Republicans pointed toward Tuesday's pivotal primary in
Michigan, where Mitt Romney and John McCain both pledged
to lead a revival for a state and an auto industry ravaged by re
cession.
Obama was the first to suggest a cooling of the rhetoric on
race, calling reporters together to say he didn't want the cam
paign "to degenerate into so much tit-for-tat, back-and-forth
that we lose sight of why all of us are doing this."
Referring to Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards, he said
that while they may have disagreements, "we share the same
goals. We're all Democrats, we all believe in civil rights, we all be
lieve in equal rights."
Clinton's campaign issued a statement in the same vein
about an hour after Obama spoke, saying it was time to seek
common ground. "And in that spirit, let's come together, be
cause 1 want more than anything else to ensure that our family
stays together on the front lines of the struggle to expand rights
for all Americans," she said.
Strikingly, though, one of Clinton's supporters. New York
Rep. Charles Rangel, was sharply critical of Obama in an inter
view during the day. "How race got into this thing is because
Obama said 'race,'" Rangel, the dean of the Congressional
Black Caucus, said on television station NYI.
For all the maneuvering. Democrats are without a contested
election on Tuesday.
That was in contrast to the Republican campaign, where Mc-
Cain and Romney battled in a Michigan primary that neither
could afford to lose.
"1 will not rest until Michigan is back," said Romney, a native
son who jabbed at his rival for saying many jobs among the
thousands lost will never return.
"We will create new jobs." insisted McCain, who also favors
improvements in federal programs for laid-off workers. "We
have the innovation, the talent, the knowledge and the ability ...
to regain Michigan's position as the best in the world."
For much of the day, both Clinton and Obama seemed con
tent to engage in increasingly accusatory campaign tactics.
Campaigning in Nevada, Obama, said some of his opponents
"don't seem to have anything positive to say about their own
record. All they're trying to do is run me down."
Obama, seeking to become the first black president, didn't
mention Clinton by name. But the reference was unmistakable
after controversy over race and the Iraq war and as her cam
paign arranged a conference call to criticize his record on abor
tion.
In an interview on NBC. he was said the former first lady's
campaign was seeking to stoke the race-related controversy. "I
think there's some intentionality on the part of the Clinton cam
paign to knock us off message," he said.
Rangel's remarks were the second critical of Obama in as

many days by a black surrogate campaigner. On Sunday, busi
nessman Robert Johnson appeared to make a veiled reference
to Obama's self-disclosed drug use as a youth - although he
quickly disputed that was his intent.
The former first lady did not mention the campaign's increas
ingly combative tone as she campaigned in New York.
"Both Senator Obama and I know we are where we are
today because of leaders like Dr. King," Clinton said at a labor
sponsored birthday celebration in honor of the slain civil rights
leader. Dr. Martin Luther King. "We have to bring our party to
gether and our country together."
Next up for the Democrats were precinct caucuses Saturday
in Nevada.There, Clinton's supporters awaited a court ruling on
a lawsuit seeking a last-minute change in rules they agreed to
months ago. Their objective was to prevent several caucuses
along the l.as Vegas Strip, where thousands of Culinary Work
ers Union employees - many of them Hispanic or black - hold
jobs.
The rules were approved in March, when the former first
lady was the overwhelming national front-runner in the race.
But the union voted last week to endorse Obama, and the law
suit followed.

Edwards is campaigning aggressively in both Nevada and
South Carolina, and his aides circulated a memo during the
day saying both his rivals were "deeply flawed." It said both
Clinton and Obama might be unable to win the White House
in November, and that Edwards, alone, was strong enough to
fight the Republicans and corporate interests all the way to
victory.
Obama's comments about the attacks on him came in Neva
da several days after race became a subject of controversy in his
contest with Clinton, who is trying to become the first woman to
win the Oval office.
The issue flared after Clinton said it had taken President
Lyndon B. Johnson, a white politician, to finally realize King's
dream of racial equality by signing the Civil Rights Act. Rep. Jim
Clvburn. D-S.C., and the highest-ranking black member of Con
gress, expressed unhappiness over that as well as remarks her
husband, former President Clinton, had made that were critical
of Obama.
The former president has made several appearances on
black radio programs to ease concerns, while his wife appeared
on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday and accused Obama's
campaign of distorting her comments.
