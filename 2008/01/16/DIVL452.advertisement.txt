There are some financial firms where technology doesn't take a back seat. The
D. EL Shaw group is a highly successful investment and technology development
firm with an international reputation and a decidedly different approach to doing
business. We offer a casual work environment populated by some of the brightest
graduates from the strongest technical programs in the world. They didn't necessarily
think of themselves as "112 inancial types," and neither did we. We thought of them as
people with extraordinary talent.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, software development,
information technology, computer architecture, and computational chemistry.
Our working environment is intense but surprisingly casual. We provide unusual
opportunities for growth. And we compensate extraordinary people
ext rao rd i nari ly well.
