April 30, 1997: Chelsea
Clinton accepts place in
Class of '01
It began at 7:26 a.m.
"Chelsea Clinton. 17, will attend
Stanford University. White House
says," The Associated Press report
ed in a news alert usually reserved
for key legislative votes for break
ing news.
But for the national media and
the White Mouse press corps, this
was breaking news.
In the next 34 minutes.more than
24 people called the University
Communications office, clamoring
for University spokesman Terry
Shepard to say something like,
"Yeah, we think it's awesome and
really cool that Chelsea decided to
come out West. Like, she's the
daughter of the president."
Instead Shepard. with a three
line statement in hand, sat down
with reporters.gave television inter
views and did the radio talk show
circuit from California to Pennsyl
vania the entire day yesterday, try
ing to reiterate the statement in as
many different ways as he could.
"You better not flunk out the
president's daughter," one Regis
and-Kathy-Lee-like talk show host
said, hoping Shepard would re
spond. "Actually. part of the offer is
all As every quarter."
"I said warning accepted' and
went on to the next question," Shep
ard said.
CNN was the first to arrive. Then
the local news stations. Then the na
tional gang.
By 11 a.m., there were more tele
vision dishes in the Oval than peo
ple. and students walking to class
had to avoid more media members
than bikes.
The frenzy was the biggest sin
gle-day total in the last decade.
Shepard received 99 phone calls be
tween 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. He
gave seven television interviews and
had journalists in his office until the
doors were locked at 5 p.m.
All for a 17-year old freshman
to-be.
