# Freudenschade
## The 						Return 
### 
Recently, I've begun to
think that I may not be a
very nice person. At first
glance, you might think this is
obviously false. After all, I'm
friendly and personable. 1 give
money to charity. And I only
torture animals on Tliesdays.
1 used to believe that 1 pos
sessed Gandhi-like levels of hu
manity, which 1 carried with a be-

atific smile. Lately, however, real 1
life has had a transformative ef- '
feet on my self-perception.
This is disturbing. While I
enjoy being miserable, grumpy
and bitter, I don't want to be
thought of as unpleasant.
Misery lies at the heart of this
newfound imperfection — the
misery I feel at the success of oth
ers. Or. to quote legendary colum
nist Navin Sivanandam, it's the
Freudenschade (Stanford Daily,
April 2Kth).
Now, it's not that I want my
peers to fail; I just don't want them
to do well. Every time 1 hear of oth
ers' triumphs, a little part of me
shrivels and dies. Especially when
it comes to my friends.

My current bitterness has
come from applying for post
docs. A few of my theoretical

physics buddies and I arc graduating
this year, which means we've all been

out on the job market, desperately beg- *
ging universities to provide us with
food, shelter and undergraduates to leer
at.
The game is finally coming to a close
this week. The offers started to arrive just
before break, so I've had to deal with
whoops of joy from my colleagues for the
last month.
It's horrible. Sickening even. Whenev
er I hear some miserable bastard just
found himself a job at MIT. I feel ill. After
my stomach lurches, the emotional roller
coaster kicks off. On top of the misery.

there's the anger — the pure, unadulter
ated rage that I can't avoid feeling at a
friend's good fortune.
Of course, a large part of it is the fair
ness of it all. Smart, hard-working people
get top-tier jobs because they deserve

them. And that's just awful for your self
esteem — not only are you performing
below par. you're doing so because, in
fact, you are below par.
Friends' accomplishments are much
less troubling when they're undeserved.
After all, blaming the Fates and whining
at the unfairness of it all is perfectly re
spectable among grad students.
So without the reassurance of uncoop
erative providence, what is there to do but
wallow in depression, in misery and in
anger?

Which brings mc hack on point. "
How bad a person are you if, when your
friends get great jobs that they absolute
ly deserve, you resent them and their suc-
what circle of hell do you belong?
I suppose the answer should be along
the lines of a very bad person. On the
other hand. I can comfort myself with the
thought that — at least amongst grad stu
dents — Freudenschade is universal.

Let me know why you hate your friends.
