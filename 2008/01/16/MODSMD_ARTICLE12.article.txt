Romney scores convincing
Michigan GOP victory

DETROIT(AP) — Mitt Romney scored his
first major primary victory TUesday, a desper
ately needed win in his native Michigan that
gave his weakened presidential candidacy
new life.
His victory set the stage for a wide-open
Republican showdown in South Carolina in
just four days. Three GOP candidates now
have won in the first four states to vote in the
2008 primary season, roiling a nomination
fight that lacks a clear favorite as the race
moves south for the first time.
The former Massachusetts governor de
feated John McCain, the Arizona senator
who was hoping that independents and De
mocrats would join Republicans to help him

repeat his 2(XW) triumph here.
Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas
governor, trailed in third, and former Ten
nessee Sen. Fred Thompson is making a last
stand in South Carolina.
Romney's ties to Michigan proved benefi
cial. Four in 10 voters said his roots factored
into their decisions, and 58 percent of that
group backed him, according to exit polls.
Of the three candidates competing hard
here. Romney needed a Michigan victory the
most to invigorate a campaign crippled by
searing losses in lowa and New Hampshire.
"It's a victory of optimism over Washing
ton-style pessimism." Romney said in an As
sociated Press telephone interview from
Southfield. Mich., echoing his campaign
speeches and taking a poke at McCain, the
four-term senator he beat. "Now on to South
Carolina. Nevada, Florida."

Clinton and Obama vow in debate to
bury exchanges over race

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Democratic presi
dential rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Barack Obama blamed aides and campaign
surrogates TUesday night for fueling a cam
paign controversy over race, jointly pledg
ing at a debate on the birthday of Martin
Luther King Jr. to put the matter behind
them.
Race dominated the debate at the outset,
after several days of back-and-forth that left
many Democrats worried about an adverse
impact on the party's prospects for the gen
eral election.
At a debate in which the two sparred al
most cordially, Obama suggested Clinton
had taken a page from President Bush's po

litical playbook with an earlier statement
that the next president could expect to be
tested quickly by terrorists.
"When Senator Clinton uses the specter
of a terrorist attack with a new prime min
ister during a campaign. I think that is part
and parcel with what we've seen, the use of
the fear of terrorism in scoring political
points, and I think that's a mistake," he
said.
Asked by NBC's Tim Russert whether
she had meant to say terrorists would test
Obama more than her, she replied. "No, of
course not,' before adding, "it matters
who's president."
( linton. Obama and former Sen. John
Edwards, the only white man among the
candidates on stage, settled in for their de
bate as the former first lady won a meaning
less Michigan presidential primary.
