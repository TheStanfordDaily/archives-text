In honor of the upcoming holiday
on Monday, participants celebrated
the dream and messages of Ameri
can civil rights leader Martin Luther
King. Jr. yesterday at Arrillaga
Alumni Center.
"Global Peace with Social Jus
tice," a three-hour event sponsored
by the Martin Luther King. Jr. Re
search and Education Institute, fea
tured gospel musical performances

of "Precious Lord" and dramatic
renditions of King's famous "I Have
a Dream" speech, both of which
moved audience members to tears.
Participants also viewed an excerpt
from journalist and filmmaker Kevin
McKiernan's documentary "Pas
sages of Martin Luther King in Bei
jing," which is still in the production
phase.
The 2007 Beijing production of
Institute Director Clayborne Car
son's play "Passages of Martin
Luther King" was the subject of the

documentary. Original letters, per
sonal notes, interviews and speeches
served as inspiration for the play,
which includes songs such as "Pre
cious Lord" and "Ain't Gonna Let
Nobody Turn Me Around" and read
ings of King's speeches.
In 2007, the play was performed in
Chinese at the National Theatre of
China by a cast that featured Chinese
actors —including one playing the
role of King — intermixed with
black American gospel singers.
Caitrin McKiernan '02, Kevin

McKiernan's daughter, produced the
play last summer in Beijing in an ef
fort to teach Chinese citizens about
the history of the American civil
rights movement. At Stanford, she
developed a relationship with Car
son while completing her degree in
history.

legacy in America are applicable to
China.
Her ultimate goal of bringing the
messages of King to Beijing was to
build a bridge between American
and Chinese societies by addressing
the peaceful struggle for civil rights
and showing that King's message
was also relevant in China.
"China is an emerging superpow
er, and the U.S. is the superpower,"
Caitrin McKiernan said, "and King
is someone that both sides believe
in."

he belongs to China as well." said

Youliang. "1 lis influence in China is
great."
During the event. Carson spoke
of the importance of spreading
King's message and keeping his
legacy alive.
"Education is about social jus
tice. equalizing opportunity in our
society," he said."lt's about empow
ering the world for the better, not
simply using education to get
ahead."
