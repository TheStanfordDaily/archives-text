## Editorial Board Chelsea lacks class at exclusive event 
### 
£"V Te are just trying to make my
Wf mom's campaign more acces
▼ V sible to people," said Chelsea
Clinton '01 on Sunday night to a standing
room-only crowd in the Pi Phi lounge. The
Stanford alumna and daughter of presiden
tial candidate Hillary Clinton, Ms. Clinton
arrived at Stanford yesterday for a one-day
swing through campus in order to talk to
young women, a key target demographic of
the Clinton campaign. But the limited invi
tation policy of the event at Pi Phi. which
was only open to members of the Inter-
Sorority-Council, left a bad taste in the
mouths of the many Clinton fans and politi
cal junkies across campus, many of whom
would have stayed home from Lake Tahoe
ski trips for a chance to attend.
In an effort to sway undecided voters for
California's upcoming Feb. 5 presidential
primary. Chelsea hosted a small round-table
discussion at Old Union and later a larger
event open only to sorority members in the
Pi Phi lounge. According to a member of the
Stanford Students for Hillary, who was
quoted in the Stanford Daily on Monday
[Chelsea Campaigns at Farm), the former
first daughter wanted to reach out to the
sorority audience in order to tap into a "core
demographic" of Hillary Clinton's cam
paign.
By many accounts it was a success.
Chelsea reached out to undecided female
voters, supporting and explaining her moth
er's views on substantive issues such as the
war in Iraq and the nuances between univer
sal insurance plans of the major Democratic
presidential candidates. The strategy seems
almost ingenious: target an all-female slice
of the Stanford population that may be less
politically engaged but more socially con
nected, and present them with an impressive
young woman who lived in the Cowell clus
ter herself ten years ago.

But the exclusive setting of the question
and-answer session, however, may have
turned off more people than it turned on.
Clinton was not a member of a sorority
while at Stanford,so her appearance was not
a homecoming for a former sorority sister.
The campaign and the University kept the
event a secret and only members of the ISC
even knew Clinton was scheduled to visit on
campus.
Perhaps this was the design and intention
of the campaign stop all along, however. A
school-wide, open event, held impersonally
in Memorial Auditorium or Kresge, would
have been packed with political partisans
and prevented the presidential daughter
from forging any connections with voters or
personally changing people's minds.
What transpired on Sunday night, how
ever, created the impression that Hillary
Clinton'scampaign. which has been accused
of belonging to a establishment network
and resisting grassroots political change,
was something less than accessible.
Chelsea's mum appearance sponsored by
the sorority system, a naturally exclusive in
stitution that accepts and rejects candidates
based on notoriously subjective qualifica
tions, only perpetuates the major criticisms
of the Clinton campaign.
Certainly there are many sorority girls at
Stanford who are interested in politics and
benefited from hearing Chelsea speak —
many sorority girls were denied entry into
the event at Pi Phi. An open event, however,
where perhaps a lottery system could have
limited attendance but allowed access,could
have drummed up more interest and posi
tive energy for the Hillary campaign. In
stead. on Sunday Chelsea sought "accessi
bility" for her mother's campaign at a pri
vate event that, ten years ago, then-student
Chelsea Clinton would not have been invit
ed to attend.
