## The
						United States: A modern-day Batman 
### 
I have watched the trailer for "The Dark
Knight," the second Batman movie to fea
ture Christian Bale, at least 10 times now.
This is what happens when you live in a small
coastal town and you have nothing to do over
winter break.
It's a pretty sweet trailer. Christian Bale is
good, and Heath Ledger is pretty scary as a
messed-up Joker. Maggie Gyllenhall replaces
Katie Holmes â€” in the cuteness department,
a definite downgrade. ITie trailer was instant

tries from the extraterritorial ambitions of
rogue states and criminal elements. And now
fond of really flippin' sweet cars.
"You've changed things. There's no going
back. To them, you're just a freak." says the
Joker during the trailer, and, in a sense, he is
saying something about America. Batman is
the reluctant policemen of an anarchic world,
hated when he saves it. hated when he does
n't. We were "bad" for not intervening in
Rwanda, we were "bad" for intervening in
Iraq. One day we're a normal country,making
friends with Canada, the next we're the hege
