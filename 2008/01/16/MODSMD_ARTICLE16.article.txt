## The 						United States: A modern-day Batman 
### 
I have watched the trailer for "The Dark
Knight," the second Batman movie to fea
ture Christian Bale, at least 10 times now.
This is what happens when you live in a small
coastal town and you have nothing to do over
winter break.
It's a pretty sweet trailer. Christian Bale is
good, and Heath Ledger is pretty scary as a
messed-up Joker. Maggie Gyllenhall replaces
Katie Holmes â€” in the cuteness department,
a definite downgrade. ITie trailer was instant
ly and inevitably re-done (with the same
sound but different visuals) on You lube with
clips from both the 1960s and 1980s Batmans.
Dwelling on Batman,however,led me to a
grand, satisfying and truly meaningless con
clusion: he.above all the other superheroes,is
the one best suited to our current time.
I will not resort to negative, Romney
esque attacks (he's just showing a contrast!
Really!), and instead, sing the praises of Bat
man. The Spiderman. X-Men and Superman
movies in recent years have been truly terri
ble, but this isn't about them. This is about
Batman. And America. We need to stay on
topic, about Batman, here. I le is the most im
portant for our time by far. How so? Let me
count the ways.
America IS Batman. One day. America is

Baimel

a mild-mannered industrialist Bruce Wayne,
fond of capitalism and nice cars. The next.
America is Batman, the world's superpower
and policeman, saving mild-mannered coun
tries from the extraterritorial ambitions of
rogue states and criminal elements. And now
fond of really flippin' sweet cars.
"You've changed things. There's no going
back. To them, you're just a freak." says the
Joker during the trailer, and, in a sense, he is
saying something about America. Batman is
the reluctant policemen of an anarchic world,
hated when he saves it. hated when he does
n't. We were "bad" for not intervening in
Rwanda, we were "bad" for intervening in
Iraq. One day we're a normal country,making
friends with Canada, the next we're the hege
mon dismissing Western Europe as "old."
It's a dark time for Gotham, and the

world. The R-word is looming. The
financial markets are unstable.
Some countries,like Pakistan, teeter
on the brink of instability, others
like Venezuela and Russia teeter on
the brink of authoritarianism. It's
unclear whether liberalism is win
ning against Islamic terrorism. More
than ever. America's place in this
murky Gotham is uncertain, and in
tlux.
Batman's struggle to determine
his proper place in society, where he
is profoundly different than every
one else, mirrors America's. We are
different. We are the onlv country

able to project power around the
globe, the country that sets economic
and financial norms, and the one with
political leadership over the liberal
democratic world. 1 low do we use
this power? Should we try to estab
lish a truly global international order,
as we did in the 1940s and 1950s with
Bretton Woods and the United Na
tions? Or should we retreat to the
Batcave of isolationism, as Ron Paul
advocates, never to impose our val
ues on the world?
We'll have to watch "The Dark
Knight" to find out. Or at least watch
the trailer about another do/en or so
more times.

Stuart Baimel has now .seen the trailer
14 times. He should make a job oat of
this. Email him at sbaimel@
