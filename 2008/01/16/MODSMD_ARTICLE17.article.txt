PETA2 grateful for
'humane dining choices'
To the editor:
In response to yesterday's article [Axe &
Palm to freshen menu). I would like to
thank ASSU and Stanford Dining for com
ing together to expand the vegetarian and
Vegan options available on campus. As
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 stated
in the article, many students had "expressed
serious concern" over the lack of healthy
and humane dining choices. ITiis trend ex
tends far beyond the Bay Area though, and
is part of a larger shift on campuses nation
wide towards vegetarian and vegan dishes.
In fact, a recent survey by Aramark, a lead
ing food service provider, concluded that
nearly a quarter of college students are ac
tively seeking out vegan options when they
sit down to eat.
There are as many reasons to eat vegetar

ian dishes as there are vegetarians, hut some
of the most common include student health,
environmental concerns and of course cruel
ty to animals. The more that students learn
about how animals are raised and killed for
food, the less likely they are to support com
panies that profit from that exploitation.
Chickens, for example, often have their
beaks sliced off with hot blades, while cows
and pigs are skinned and dismembered,
many while still fully conscious. If these
kinds of abuses were inflicted upon cats or
dogs, it would result in felony cruelty to ani
mals charges.
Thankfully, by Stanford Dining making
menu changes to meet the student demand,
residents seeking out vegetarian and vegan
options will have little difficulty finding a
hearty meal. Indeed, it's never been a better
time to be a vegetarian on campus.
