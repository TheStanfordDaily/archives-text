## Clinton, Obama and Edwards address poverty issues 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Democratic presidential candidates
Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama and John
Edwards are among the policy experts
contributing essays to the inaugural issue
of Pathways magazine, the new Stanford
Center for Poverty and Inequality publica
tion due out in print this week.
Pathways magazine editors Sociology
Prof. David Grusky and Sociology Lectur
er Christopher Wimer's vision for the new
magazine is to offer readers an alternative
to the most popular economy-focused pe
riodicals in circulation. The magazine
looks critically at how income is distrib
uted in the economy, rather than solely on
how its growth is generated.

"The United States has an ongoing love
affair with magazines about the economy"
the editors wrote in the issue. "If super
market shelves stocked with Business-
Week. the Economist, Forbes and Fortune
are any guide, there is clearly much inter
est in how the economy is doing ... But,
strangely enough, there are no popular
magazines focused on how that output is
distributed."
"If we care about the total output,
shouldn't we care also about who is getting
all that output?" they added. "Why not a
magazine on who's winning, who's losing
and why?"
Through survey and analysis of current
data on inequality levels in the United
States, the magazine speculates about the
sources and consequences of poverty and

the most effective interventions to address
inequality
ITie magazine seeks to represent a di
versity of policy opinions.
"We are committed to a truly open de
bate on issues of distribution that is con
strained only by evidence and brute facts,"
Grusky and Wimer wrote.
To research the first issue on how to
"fight a new war on poverty," the magazine
extended an invitation to all top 2008 pres
idential contenders to weigh in on what a
new way of combating poverty may look
like, though only Clinton, Obama and lid
wards agreed to participate. Policy experts
Charles Murray. Robert Frank, Rebecca
Blank, Stefanie DeLuca, James Rosen
baum, Timothy Smeeding and Emmanuel
Saez contributed commentary and articles

along with
the candi
dates' pieces.

opinions on the

topic of distribution.
Subjects covered
in the magazine in
clude poverty rates
in the United States

as compared to na
tions such as the U.K.. the housing vouch
er policy and "poverty and marriage." One
feature critiqued the 2008 presidential
candidates' stances on wealth distribution

Stanford students have yet to
contribute to the publication,
though Cirusky noted that the Cen
ter for Poverty and Inequality would
not be opposed to student participa
tion in the future.
Already, a number of students
are involved in other programs at

the Center, which was founded in
2006 for the purpose of research,
training and policy analysis on
poverty and inequality. The Center
has 125 Stanford faculty affiliates, as
well as national and international
fellows. Pathways is the Center's
first publication.
