# The 						Lowly Interns
## A 						tale of two quads 
### 
I'm sick of two things: elections and one
room quads. "You were in Washington?"
someone says. "So how do you think the
campaigns are going?"
I hate the beauty contest. 1 hate the horse
race, but the hard details that do matter are
too boring for even the candidates them
selves to learn very well. Certainly too boring
for me to inflict on you here. So even though
my co-Daily columnists Stuart. Sagar. Nat.
Gabe, Kai. Ziv. Vishnu and even Courtney
(because primaries are primaries) have all
written interesting things about the U.S. pres
idential race. I refuse to say anything else. In
stead. I want to tell a story.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of
times, it was the age of wisdom and foolish
ness. Light and Darkness, hope and despair.
We had everything before us, we had nothing
before us. It began at the end of freshman
year.
After some frantic wrangling. I was in a
draw group of eight pretty cool guys, and
after some frantic praying, we had a draw
number of 1 (K). Embracing what seemed to
be our divine anointment, we picked
Xanadu, at the heart of the Row. But then
karma fought back. We were only sopho
mores, last to choose rooms, and I found my
self in a one-room quad for all of sophomore
year.
Like the process that led to it, the quad it
self seemed to pendulate between awesome
ness and disaster. We nicknamed it"the octa
gon" because it truly had eight walls, though
not in any symmetrical arrangement. Thanks
to high ceilings and creative bed-lofting, we
found room for a 30-something-inch TV we
bought at a yard sale, on which we proceeded
to watch way too much South Park. We were
four guys sleeping in very close quarters, with
many, many alarm clocks. One roommate set
his alarm every day for a 9 a.m. class he at
tended about seven times. As far as romance,
offers to "come back to my place" were non
existent. not only because of our (my) inepti
tude. but because they were very near impos
sible.
But having so many roommates meant
there was always someone to sympathize
with me. or at least laugh at me. when I came
back late at night with stories of my most re
cent regrettable escapade. It was easy to
round people up for a run to Chipotle. a
movie, a basketball game. Whatever good
thing you could want in a roommate, the odds
were I could find it in my quad, or in our larg
er draw group of eight. Xanadu was full of
fun. friends and adventures. But by the end of
the year. I resolved that living in a quad was a
one-time experience, something that builds

character,but something which should not be
repeated.
During the fall in Washington, a one-room
double felt spacious and airy. I began to re
member what it felt like to have some sem
blance of privacy. But as I prepared to come
back in the winter, the cycle began to repeat
itself. Again, I had drawn preferred, this time
alone, and received the astonishingly lucky
number of 140. Again, 1 wanted to live on the
Row. but, wary from last time. I emailed the
Housing office to ask what 1 should do to
avoid living in a one-room quad. Sorry. 1 was
told, we don't have a good picture of where
openings will occur. (How this is possible,
since those leaving file termination of occu
pancy forms, remains a mystery.)
Becoming paranoid. I consulted friends
back on campus who assured me the Xanadu
quad was not being vacated, so I wouldn't be
back there again. When I was assigned to 717,
a house with nearly all doubles. I was ecstat
ic. and a friend who lived there informed me

the double next to him had opened up com
pletely. My fears of a quad dissipated.
But then 1 got the email. Due to the hous
ing crunch, the basement common room of
717 would be converted into a one-room
quad,and I was assigned to it. I recognize that
the odds of getting draw numbers of 100 and
140 are ridiculously low, and even unfair. But
should 1 really be cosmically punished for my
luck by having back to back one-room
quads? Like Xanadu, 717 is great, and 1 like
my new roommates, but the quad is ridicu
lous. There's a fireplace we can't use, a fire
door we might be allowed to use, and a con
trol panel within a foot of my bed that runs
the fire sprinklers for the whole house. It
even has a wrench inside for changing sprin
kler heads.
So here I am again. Another great draw
number, another great house, another terri
ble room. The best of times, and the worst.
Darkness and light. Stanford housing made
less painful only by the great students who
live there. I'm much better off than my
friends in the dark, anti-social basement of
Crothers graduate housing, but, for them, a
one-room quad is still character building. For
me, at this point, it just seems like overkill.

Showen and the rest of the Crothers library.

me, at this point, it just seems like overkill.
