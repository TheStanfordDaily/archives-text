### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It turned into a battle at the end, but the No. 6 Stanford
men's volleyball team pulled out a sweep over UC-Santa Cruz
last night to push its record to 4-1 on the season. Every healthy
player saw the floor, and 11 hitters had at least two kills in the
30-18,30-23,34-32 win.
"1 have been telling these guys all along that playing time is
earned, travel squad is earned and starting positions are
earned," head coach John Kosty said after the match. "That was
the type of match that we had, with everyone playing for their
positions and we got the

effort out of everybody.
Everybody con
tributed, and it was a
great win."
Sophomore oppo
site Evan Romero led
the Cardinal (4-1. 1-1
MPSF) with eight kills
while freshman middle
blocker Charley Hen
rikson was right behind
with seven at a .875 clip.
The Cardinal hit .239 as
a team and held the Ba
nana Slugs to a .000 per
centage in each game
and the match. Santa
Cruz did make the Car
dinal work for the victo
ry, however, nearly forc
ing a fourth game.
"Coach likes us to be
in competitive situa
tions" freshman libero
Jordan Inafuku said.
"It's really good prac
tice."
Stanford took con
trol of the match from
the opening play, win
ning eight of the first

outside hitter Garrett Dobbs ended
the game at 30-23 with a kill.
The Banana Slugs led for the
first time in the match in the third
game, going up 11-10 after the
teams traded points to start the
third frame. Stanford tied but could
not build much of a lead — the
score was tied 14 times in the
course of the game. Stanford had
match point at 29-28, but a kill by
Santa Cruz kept the team alive.
UCSC had two chances to win be
fore freshman outside hitter lan
Connolly finally ended the match
with a kill for a 34-32 final score.
"Our guys competed really well,
and Santa Cruz came out in the
third game and played their hearts
out, played well enough to win."
Kosty said. "We just came up with a
couple of good balls. We put in hard
work and converted and were able
to win that game."
"We like to keep it exciting,"

Dobbs joked.
Dobbs finished third on the team
with six kills while Werner was a
perfect five-for-five hitting on the
night. Henrikson led the Cardinal's
net defense with eight block assists,
half of the team's 16 total. Romero
and Groppi added five each.
Groppi also led the team in as
sists with 30 after taking over for
sophomore setter Kawika Shoji
late in the first game. Shoji finished
the night with nine. Inafuku and
junior Jarod Keller shared time at
libero and recorded five and four,
respectively, to lead the team.
Meredith notched three of Stan
ford's six aces in the match, and the
team only missed 14 overall, one
more than their opponents, but bet
ter than on last weekend's road trip.
"Our serving game was good
tonight," Kosty said. "We fell into a
couple little ruts where we missed a
couple of serves in a row, but I
thought our serving game was on
tonight.
"Our offense and our sideout
game depends on our passing, and
we had some lulls in our passing
that allowed us to give up streaks.

But overall, 1 was very happy with
the match and how we played."
Santa Cruz was led on attack by
Brad Sullivan with a match-high 11
kills, and Austin Einhorn also had a
match high with nine blocks.
The Cardinal kicked off its home
season in Burnham Pavilion in
front of a raucous and surprisingly
large TUesday night crowd. For the
freshmen, it was their first time
playing in front of friends and class
mates.
"It was great," Connolly said. "It
was really nice seeing people from
my dorm here."
"1 think having admission free to
the general public and hosting our
matches both in Maples and Burn
ham Pavilion creates a great atmos
phere," Kosty said. "And 1 am ex
pecting a much bigger crowd in
Maples on Friday."
Stanford will host No. 11 South
ern California in Maples on Friday
night and will be back in Burnham
on Saturday to face second-ranked
Pepperdine.

Stanford defeated UC-Santa Cruz in three sets last night, improving its record to 4-1 on the season. The Card victory was a true

the game at 30-23 with a kill.
The Banana Slugs led for the
first time in the match in the third
game, going up 11-10 after the
teams traded points to start the
third frame. Stanford tied but could
not build much of a lead — the
score was tied 14 times in the
course of the game. Stanford had
match point at 29-28, but a kill by
Santa Cruz kept the team alive.
UCSC had two chances to win be

Connolly finally ended the match
with a kill for a 34-32 final score.
"Our guys competed really well,
and Santa Cruz came out in the
third game and played their hearts
out, played well enough to win."
Kosty said. "We just came up with a
couple of good balls. We put in hard
work and converted and were able
to win that game."
"We like to keep it exciting,"

Dobbs joked.
Dobbs finished third on the team
with six kills while Werner was a
perfect five-for-five hitting on the
night. Henrikson led the Cardinal's
net defense with eight block assists,
half of the team's 16 total. Romero
and Groppi added five each.
Groppi also led the team in as
sists with 30 after taking over for
sophomore setter Kawika Shoji
late in the first game. Shoji finished
the night with nine. Inafuku and
junior Jarod Keller shared time at
libero and recorded five and four,
respectively, to lead the team.
Meredith notched three of Stan
ford's six aces in the match, and the
team only missed 14 overall, one
more than their opponents, but bet
ter than on last weekend's road trip.
