# Is Rivers worse than the Pats?
## 
### 
Last week's column was, honest
ly. a hit of a cheap shot. Not that
it's unfair to pick on the "Patri
ots — they have all the earmarks of
the "easy to hate" franchise.The thor
oughly despisable head coach, a
cheating scandal, a star safety who
was busted for his use of perform
ance-enhancing drugs and a quarter
back who seems to be just a bit too
much of a media darling. Even with
all his myriad accomplishments, I'm
just not sure 1 ever need to know
whom a quarterback is dating — and
that goes for you too, Tony Romo.
Save that stuff for Entertainment
Tonight, not Sports Center.
But of course, the number one
reason the Patriots are so easy to re
sent is they're just too good. They've
taken a lot of the uncertainty out of
the competition this year, and I miss
the days when I honestly wasn't sure
who would win the Super Bowl
months in advance. Sports fans love
the underdog and. no matter who the
Pats play, they're never that.
So the column last week was per
haps cheap in that it was easy to write
and hard to argue against — which is
why I'm going for something a bit dif
ferent this time around when 1 say
that Philip Rivers may be the only
man on the planet who could turn the
tide of public sentiment away from
the "other guys" in the AFC Champi
onship game and back to the heavily
favored, highly hated New England
Patriots.
If you haven't heard of Rivers, it's
really not your fault. Unless you're an
NFL fanatic or just a fan of the San
Diego Chargers, there's really no rea
son why he would have made a splash
you'd notice. But for football junkies
like yours truly, something very odd
has been transpiring for the previous
ly unheard of Southern California
signal-caller.
It started in a division rivalry game
a few weeks ago against the Denver
Broncos, when the most unlikable
persona in the NFL emerged — as
Rivers left the field in a game the
Chargers went on to win soundly
over the Broncos, he taunted Denver
