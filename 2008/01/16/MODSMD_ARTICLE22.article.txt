# Is Rivers worse than the Pats?
## 
### 
Last week's column was, honest
ly. a hit of a cheap shot. Not that
it's unfair to pick on the "Patri
ots — they have all the earmarks of
the "easy to hate" franchise.The thor
oughly despisable head coach, a
cheating scandal, a star safety who
was busted for his use of perform
ance-enhancing drugs and a quarter
back who seems to be just a bit too
much of a media darling. Even with
all his myriad accomplishments, I'm
just not sure 1 ever need to know
whom a quarterback is dating — and
that goes for you too, Tony Romo.
Save that stuff for Entertainment
Tonight, not Sports Center.
But of course, the number one
reason the Patriots are so easy to re
sent is they're just too good. They've
taken a lot of the uncertainty out of
the competition this year, and I miss
the days when I honestly wasn't sure
who would win the Super Bowl
months in advance. Sports fans love
the underdog and. no matter who the
Pats play, they're never that.
So the column last week was per
haps cheap in that it was easy to write
and hard to argue against — which is
why I'm going for something a bit dif
ferent this time around when 1 say
that Philip Rivers may be the only
man on the planet who could turn the
tide of public sentiment away from
the "other guys" in the AFC Champi
onship game and back to the heavily
favored, highly hated New England
Patriots.
If you haven't heard of Rivers, it's
really not your fault. Unless you're an
NFL fanatic or just a fan of the San
Diego Chargers, there's really no rea
son why he would have made a splash
you'd notice. But for football junkies
like yours truly, something very odd
has been transpiring for the previous
ly unheard of Southern California
signal-caller.
It started in a division rivalry game
a few weeks ago against the Denver
Broncos, when the most unlikable
persona in the NFL emerged — as
Rivers left the field in a game the
Chargers went on to win soundly
over the Broncos, he taunted Denver


Denis
Griffin
Jants and Raves
quarterback Jay Cutler for no appar
ent reason. Worse still, in our brave
new world of You Tube and sports
bloggers, he did it in plain view of the
cameras. 1 lonestly. it was pretty clear
that Rivers just didn't care whether
he was seen or not.
The follow-up act came Sunday in
Indianapolis, when Rivers, who had
played a great game, injured his knee
on a thoroughly unorthodox throw
for a touchdown against the Colts, in
a game which the Chargers would go
on to win. 28-24. At the time Rivers
left, the Chargers appeared to be in
control.havingjust taken a2l-171ead
heading into the fourth quarter. In
short, things were looking up.
Which is why it's so strange that
Rivers took the opportunity, mo
ments after perhaps his most impor
tant pass as a touchdown turned into
such a stirring success,to taunt the In

dianapolis crowd on his way to the
locker room — another moment that
he had to know every television cam
era in the building was sure to catch
and every sports fan in America was
sure to see on his or her nightly local
news or ESPN.
Minor incidents? In the grand
scheme of things, of course they are.
We're not talking about Michael Vick
and a newly discovered canine mas
sacre or Pacman Jones and another
bad weather forecast in a strip club.
It's only words and general bad
sportsmanship at stake. The problem
is that this is a cardinal sin in the eyes
of the American public — especially
when it comes as these episodes have.
You see, the most disturbing as
pect of Rivers' incredibly bad atti
tude in recent competitions isn't
merely that he decided to make an
ass of himself on national television
— it's that he did it while his own
personal fortunes and those of his
team were on the upswing.
America — sad as it is to say — is
used to a bad loser. When LaDainian
Tomlinson mouthed off to the press

following the Patriots' divisional
round playoff win over the Charges
last year, it was OK.
He was a true warrior, said the na
tional pundits, who simply lost con
trol of his emotions following a very
tough loss. That was understandable.
Legendary Packers coach Vince
Lombardi himself was of the opinion
that he never wanted to coach a good
loser because losing shouldn't be
easy. We expect the players who give
their all on Sundays to be sometimes
less than gracious after losses be
cause we expect them to have diffi
culty coping with failure in a game
that's all about wins and losses.
But Rivers? The problem here is
that the Hyde to his Jekyll emerged
when things were looking up. As the
Chargers have gone an amazing 8-0
in recent weeks after an uninspiring
5-5 start to their season, Rivers went
from an unassuming and largely un
known quarterback to a talented but
reviled figure. As Tony Kornheiser
said on Monday's "Pardon the Inter
ruption" on ESPN. Rivers has begun
playing like legendary Chargers

quarterback Dan Fouts at the same
time he's started acting like Ryan
Leaf.
And it's this very puzzling turn of
events that, strangely, leaves me un
able to cheer for the Chargers this
weekend, which is why I say that Phil
Rivers truly has done the impossible.
Because while 1 may not be able to
root for the Pats in the AF-'CChanipi
onship game this weekend. 1 certain
ly can't root against them — not il
that means a Rivers victory. And I'm
guessing I'm not alone.
So on Sunday, when you're
watching the Patriots take down the
Chargers, as Philip Rivers throws
snowballs at a taunting crowd, oi
gives some ret the finger, or just gen
erally acts the fool, pause loi ,i
minute and ponder what you're see
ing — we may not see a vortex of
negative public opinion on a football
field of Philip Rivers' capacitx foi
some time.

ly. a hit of a cheap shot. Not that
it's unfair to pick on the "Patri
ots — they have all the earmarks of
the "easy to hate" franchise.The thor
oughly despisable head coach, a
cheating scandal, a star safety who
was busted for his use of perform
ance-enhancing drugs and a quarter
back who seems to be just a bit too
much of a media darling. Even with
all his myriad accomplishments, I'm
just not sure 1 ever need to know
whom a quarterback is dating — and
that goes for you too, Tony Romo.
Save that stuff for Entertainment
Tonight, not Sports Center.
But of course, the number one
reason the Patriots are so easy to re
sent is they're just too good. They've
taken a lot of the uncertainty out of
the competition this year, and I miss
the days when I honestly wasn't sure
who would win the Super Bowl
months in advance. Sports fans love
the underdog and. no matter who the
Pats play, they're never that.
So the column last week was per
haps cheap in that it was easy to write
and hard to argue against — which is
why I'm going for something a bit dif
ferent this time around when 1 say
that Philip Rivers may be the only
man on the planet who could turn the
tide of public sentiment away from
the "other guys" in the AFC Champi
onship game and back to the heavily
favored, highly hated New England
Patriots.
If you haven't heard of Rivers, it's
really not your fault. Unless you're an
NFL fanatic or just a fan of the San
Diego Chargers, there's really no rea
son why he would have made a splash
you'd notice. But for football junkies
like yours truly, something very odd
has been transpiring for the previous
ly unheard of Southern California
signal-caller.
It started in a division rivalry game
a few weeks ago against the Denver
Broncos, when the most unlikable
persona in the NFL emerged — as
Rivers left the field in a game the
Chargers went on to win soundly
over the Broncos, he taunted Denver


Denis
Griffin
Jants and Raves
quarterback Jay Cutler for no appar
ent reason. Worse still, in our brave
new world of You Tube and sports
bloggers, he did it in plain view of the
cameras. 1 lonestly. it was pretty clear
that Rivers just didn't care whether
he was seen or not.
The follow-up act came Sunday in
Indianapolis, when Rivers, who had
played a great game, injured his knee
on a thoroughly unorthodox throw
for a touchdown against the Colts, in
a game which the Chargers would go
on to win. 28-24. At the time Rivers
left, the Chargers appeared to be in
control.havingjust taken a2l-171ead
heading into the fourth quarter. In
short, things were looking up.
Which is why it's so strange that
Rivers took the opportunity, mo
ments after perhaps his most impor
tant pass as a touchdown turned into
such a stirring success,to taunt the In

dianapolis crowd on his way to the
locker room — another moment that
he had to know every television cam
era in the building was sure to catch
and every sports fan in America was
sure to see on his or her nightly local
news or ESPN.
Minor incidents? In the grand
scheme of things, of course they are.
We're not talking about Michael Vick
and a newly discovered canine mas
sacre or Pacman Jones and another
bad weather forecast in a strip club.
It's only words and general bad
sportsmanship at stake. The problem
is that this is a cardinal sin in the eyes
of the American public — especially
when it comes as these episodes have.
You see, the most disturbing as
pect of Rivers' incredibly bad atti
tude in recent competitions isn't
merely that he decided to make an
ass of himself on national television
— it's that he did it while his own
personal fortunes and those of his
team were on the upswing.
America — sad as it is to say — is
used to a bad loser. When LaDainian
Tomlinson mouthed off to the press

following the Patriots' divisional
round playoff win over the Charges
last year, it was OK.
He was a true warrior, said the na
tional pundits, who simply lost con
trol of his emotions following a very
tough loss. That was understandable.
Legendary Packers coach Vince
Lombardi himself was of the opinion
that he never wanted to coach a good
loser because losing shouldn't be
easy. We expect the players who give
their all on Sundays to be sometimes
less than gracious after losses be
cause we expect them to have diffi
culty coping with failure in a game
that's all about wins and losses.
But Rivers? The problem here is
that the Hyde to his Jekyll emerged
when things were looking up. As the
Chargers have gone an amazing 8-0
in recent weeks after an uninspiring
5-5 start to their season, Rivers went
from an unassuming and largely un
known quarterback to a talented but
reviled figure. As Tony Kornheiser
said on Monday's "Pardon the Inter
ruption" on ESPN. Rivers has begun
playing like legendary Chargers

quarterback Dan Fouts at the same
time he's started acting like Ryan
Leaf.
And it's this very puzzling turn of
events that, strangely, leaves me un
able to cheer for the Chargers this
weekend, which is why I say that Phil
Rivers truly has done the impossible.
Because while 1 may not be able to
root for the Pats in the AF-'CChanipi
onship game this weekend. 1 certain
ly can't root against them — not il
that means a Rivers victory. And I'm
guessing I'm not alone.
So on Sunday, when you're
watching the Patriots take down the
Chargers, as Philip Rivers throws
snowballs at a taunting crowd, oi
gives some ret the finger, or just gen
erally acts the fool, pause loi ,i
minute and ponder what you're see
ing — we may not see a vortex of
negative public opinion on a football
field of Philip Rivers' capacitx foi
some time.
