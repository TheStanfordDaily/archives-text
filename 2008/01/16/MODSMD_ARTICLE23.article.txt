# Card going for title
## No. 2 women ready to begin dual match play 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Ten players. Four months. One na
tional title to reclaim.
With the individual season under its
belt, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team will soon begin dual match play,
"the most exciting time of year for us."
according to junior Megan Doheny.
But what exactly is dual match play?
Most of us are familiar with the fall
season, filled with individual tourna
ments and a lot of personal victories —
much like the pros.
But this is college tennis, and a lot
more intense.
Forget individual accolades and titles.
At this point, the players have fully shak
en their off-season rust and are now
playing at their top levels with their
team's record on the line.
Perhaps head coach Lelc Forood
most accurately described dual match
p ,a y. , . ,
"The dual season obviously is the
most important part of what we do even
though we do both during the year."
Forood said. "The intensity picks up
clearly in the dual season. Everyone gets
themselves ready and is more prepared

for the dual season."
The dual match system pits entire teams
against each other, testing the depth and
talent of each.
"You need a lot of players, you really
do," Forood said. "Depth is very impor
tant because we play a lot of matches and
we play in this weather in the low 50's
here and we've got a lot of matches start
ing in late January. Because of injuries
and schedule, you need a lot of players
ready to play."
There are six singles matches that
play best of three sets. Each singles victo
ry earns one point for the team.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
women are junior Jessica Nguyen (No.
21 in the nation), sophomore Lindsay
Burdette (No. 39) and freshman Carolyn
McVeigh (N0.58).
Absent from the rankings this year is

senior Celia Durkin, who, just a year ago,
received All-American and All-Pac-LO
Second Team honors.
Durkin. who battled injuries through
out the fall season, has since recovered
and is primed to regain her form just in
time.
She is joined by fellow seniors Lejla
Hodzic and Whitney Deason. who cap
tured doubles and singles titles at last
weekend's Freeman Championships.
The great equalizer of the dual match
system is the doubles game. Three dou
bles teams each play a superset, and the
team with two doubles wins gets the final
team point.
First team to four points wins — its
that simple.
Though no Stanford duo cracked the
top 50 in the January rankings, doubles
appears to be the Cardinal's strong

point.
At the Freeman Championships.
Deason and Nguyen took home the
flight one title, while Hodzic and fresh
man Jennifer Yen took the flight two
crown.
Looking at the season, here are some
notable dates and match-ups on Stan
ford's schedule:
- 1/25/08 irc Davis. Hie Cardinal
women begin their season at home
against the Aggies. "Obviously in the
early part of the season. Davis is a nice
little warm-up match." Forood said.
— 1/31/08: Fresno State. The No. 14
Bulldogs will be the Card's first real test
in the early season at home. "Fresno
state is a really tough match and we have
them second," Forood said. "That's a

huge match in the early part of the
season."
— 2/07/08: National Team Indoors.
In a month's time, the best teams in
the nation will convene in Madison,
Wise., to duke it out for the top spot
in the rankings. Last year, Stanford's
89-game win streak was broken by
eventual national champion. Geor
gia Tech, at the Indoors. "All the top
teams are going to be at the Indoors
except for No. 4 Florida, so it's clear
ly just a brutal draw," Forood said.
"It's four days of intense and tough
matches. We'll probably get to play a
lot of teams that we won't get to see
on our schedule."
— 2/20/08: California. Stanford
opens up Pacific-10 Conference play
at No. 6 California. Leading the
Golden Bears is former NCAA
Champion Susie Babos."She's final
ly a senior, a very, very tough player
who has really played well against
us," Forood said of Babos."lt's going
to be a big match. It's tough up there.

especially during the winter. It could
he cold, windy, hut it's up to us to be
ready to play up there."
-2/29/08 and 3/01/08: UCLA and
DSC. These two late February
games are lumped together in a
"very important road trip" as
Forood put it. With the Bruins
ranked No. 3 behind Stanford and
USC at No. 8. the weekend trip to
L.A. will probably define the Cardi
nal's season. "Well basically, UCLA
is the same team plus they've added
another player to last year's runner
up team," Forood said. "They're
very talented and they're extremely
good in doubles. They're going to be
a great test. USC is no easy team ei
ther.Their No. 3 or No. 4 player from
last year. Fink, won last week's tour
nament at Las Vegas. That just shows
how much depth they have on their
squad."
At the end of April, the Card will
host Cal. UCLA and USC in a final
tune-up before Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAAs. "It's a long
drawn out affair, and we'll know a
little more about ourselves after the
Indoors," Forood said. "We'll get
into conference play and, by April,
you've seen everybody and you're

playing the same teams."
— 5/9/08: NCAA Tournament. The
Cardinal will set out to win its fourth
title in five years. Last year, the Card
fell in the semifinal game to UCLA.
When asked what date shie has
marked on her calendar, Durkin
replied, "the date of the finals of
NCAAs."
That's how much Stanford wants
to reclaim the title.
Fortunately, the Cardinal women
have learned from last year's dual
match losses.
"1 think that there's something a
little bit unreal going years and
years without taking a dual loss,"
Forood said. "Quite frankly, you
don't know how painful it is until
you lose. I think we have that per
spective, and we understand that we
don't like losing too much."
With experience on their side
and a desire for vengeance, the Stan
ford women's tennis team is a force
to be reckoned with.
"It's a long season and we don't
like to lose, let's put it that way,"
Forood quipped.
