# Card going for title
## No. 2 women ready to begin dual match play 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Ten players. Four months. One na
tional title to reclaim.
With the individual season under its
belt, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team will soon begin dual match play,
"the most exciting time of year for us."
according to junior Megan Doheny.
But what exactly is dual match play?
Most of us are familiar with the fall
season, filled with individual tourna
ments and a lot of personal victories —
much like the pros.
But this is college tennis, and a lot
more intense.
Forget individual accolades and titles.
At this point, the players have fully shak
en their off-season rust and are now
playing at their top levels with their
team's record on the line.
Perhaps head coach Lelc Forood
most accurately described dual match
p ,a y. , . ,
"The dual season obviously is the
most important part of what we do even
though we do both during the year."
Forood said. "The intensity picks up
clearly in the dual season. Everyone gets
themselves ready and is more prepared

for the dual season."
The dual match system pits entire teams
against each other, testing the depth and
talent of each.
"You need a lot of players, you really
do," Forood said. "Depth is very impor
tant because we play a lot of matches and
we play in this weather in the low 50's
here and we've got a lot of matches start
ing in late January. Because of injuries
and schedule, you need a lot of players
ready to play."
There are six singles matches that
play best of three sets. Each singles victo
ry earns one point for the team.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
women are junior Jessica Nguyen (No.
21 in the nation), sophomore Lindsay
Burdette (No. 39) and freshman Carolyn
McVeigh (N0.58).
Absent from the rankings this year is

senior Celia Durkin, who, just a year ago,
received All-American and All-Pac-LO
Second Team honors.
Durkin. who battled injuries through
out the fall season, has since recovered
and is primed to regain her form just in
time.
She is joined by fellow seniors Lejla
Hodzic and Whitney Deason. who cap
tured doubles and singles titles at last
weekend's Freeman Championships.
The great equalizer of the dual match
system is the doubles game. Three dou
bles teams each play a superset, and the
team with two doubles wins gets the final
team point.
First team to four points wins — its
that simple.
Though no Stanford duo cracked the
top 50 in the January rankings, doubles
appears to be the Cardinal's strong

point.
At the Freeman Championships.
Deason and Nguyen took home the
flight one title, while Hodzic and fresh
man Jennifer Yen took the flight two
crown.
Looking at the season, here are some
notable dates and match-ups on Stan
ford's schedule:
- 1/25/08 irc Davis. Hie Cardinal
women begin their season at home
against the Aggies. "Obviously in the
early part of the season. Davis is a nice
little warm-up match." Forood said.
— 1/31/08: Fresno State. The No. 14
Bulldogs will be the Card's first real test
in the early season at home. "Fresno
state is a really tough match and we have
them second," Forood said. "That's a
