## Stanford ready to start doubles play Tennis gears up for collegiate match season, finalizes doubles pairings 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
In a collegiate tennis match, there are a total of seven
points up for grabs. Six singles matches take place, and the
winner of each earns one point for his team.The last point
is the doubles point, which is awarded to the team that wins
two of the three doubles matches played. The doubles
matches are played before the singles matches, and some
times the point is the crucial and deciding point of the
match. Many matches have been won and lost 4-3, and
teams have often looked back to the doubles point as the
point that made or broke them.
"Doubles plays an important role because the winnei
of the doubles point not only gains the first point of the
match but also is able to start the singles matches with
more confidence than the opponent," sophomore kichard
Wire said. "Winning four out of six singles to win the match
is far harder than only having to win three."
"You have to come out ready to go," said head coach
John Whitlinger.'i have brought [the importance of dou
bles) up in practice. It is hard to win if you get down early,
but 1 have seen crazy things happen before."
Additionally, in college a doubles match is only one
eight-game pro-set — first to eight wins, must win by two
— and not best-of-three sets like singles. This makes dou
bles a more intriguing challenge.
"Doubles is a lot different than singles," freshman Alex
Clayton said. "Things can change so
quickly in doubles that you really
have to be on top of every point."
"|lt| is all about energy and a
quick start," junior Blake Muller
said. "Teams can feed off the energy
[of doubles matches], compared to
singles where you can pace yourself."
Singles tennis is more widely
known, and most of the top colle
giate players compete in singles after
their four years in school. But in col
lege. the best players play both sin
gles and doubles, which can be a huge
advantage for a team in dual match
play.
Last year, Stanford boasted one
of the nation's best doubles teams in
the duo of juniors Matt Bruch and
Muller. In addition to playing dou
bles, both also excelled in singles:
Bruch captured consecutive Pac-10
singles championships in 2006 and
2007 and won the doubles title with
Muller in 2007.
Bruch and Muller are just one of
many outstanding tandems in Stan
ford tennis history. Stanford actually
has more NCAA doubles titles in
program history th;in singles titles.
The Cardinal ranks third nationally
with 14 NCAA doubles champi
onships in program history, including
Bob and Mike Bryan in 1 ( )98 and

K.C. Corkery and Sam Warburg in
2004. Even Whitlinger has con
tributed to the success, winning an
NCAA doubles title during his time
at Stanford.
"There are three important things
in doubles play: serve percentage, re
turn of the serve and first volley at
the net." Whitlinger said. "A strong
hitter and a consistent ball striker
will play well together; but some
times you have to wait awhile to find
the right combinations."
Phis year, the team is still in the
process of finalizing doubles pair
ings. Tournaments, practice play and
match play will all help in deciding
the right pairings for the team.
Muller and freshman Ted Kelly have
been Stanford's best duo thus far,
capturing the ITA West Regional
championship in November and
earning a berth at ITA National In
doors.
It is difficult to say whether play
ers prefer singles or doubles play.
Whereas players like Clayton prefer
to play singles, sophomore Paul Mor
rissey prefers the doubles game be
cause of the fast pace of play.
"Doubles is shorter, and it's all
about getting ahead and getting mo
mentum," said Morrissey. "One or
two games can change a whole

match. I like doubles because it suits
my game better, and I can take ad
vantage of my serve."
In any case, doubles is a big part of
any dual match and cannot be over
looked. The average fan is often led
to believe that doubles is just a sup
plement to singles play and that sin
gles is the more important and high
profile match-up. Yet that couldn't
be more false.
As Morrissey said, "the doubles
combinations that we have could
make a huge difference in how the
matches play out."
