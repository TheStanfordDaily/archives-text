Taking on baseball's steroids
problem once again. Congress
kept the finger-pointing and tough
questioning to a minimum. Maybe
that's because the people under
the most scrutiny this time
Miguel Tejada, Barry Bonds,
Roger Clemens — were nowhere
to be seen.
Commissioner Bud Selig and
union leader Donald Fehr accept
ed responsibility for the sport's
drug boom and the author of the
Mitchell Report defended his find
ings in the same wood-paneled
House hearing room that hosted a
far longer and far more con
tentious session in March 2005.
It didn't take long for the focus
to shift to players Tuesday.
The hearing opened with word
that Congress wants Tejada, the
2002 AL MVP. investigated for
lying to federal authorities. 'ITie
first witness, former Senate major
ity leader George Mitchell, testi
fied he believes a former trainer's
allegations that he injected seven
time Cy Young Award winner
Clemens with steroids and human
growth hormone. And Selig told
lawmakers that Bonds' San Fran
cisco Giants should have reported
concerns about the home run
king's personal trainer.
The 4-hour. 15-minute session
before the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee
also exposed what might be the lat
est drugs abused by the sport's
stars: Ritalin and Adderall, stimu
lants better known as treatments
for hyperactive kids. According to
data provided to the committee by

MLB and the union, a copy of
which was obtained by The Associ
ated Press, thc're were 35 " ITiera
peutic Use Exemptions" for drugs
in 2006. of which 28 were for ADD
and ADHD medications. In 2007,
the exemptions skyrocketed to
111. of which 103 were for ADD
and ADHD
"It seems to be a little bit odd,
said Dr. Gary Wadler, chairman of
committee that determines the
World Anti-Doping Agency's
banned-substances list. "I'm the
guy who made the issue three
years ago about amphetamines,
and baseball said they didn't have
a problem with greenies."
One of Mitchell's recommen
dations was that baseball needs an
independent agency to handle
drug testing, and the data about
ADD drugs supports that, Wadler
said.
"This demands an explanation.
ITiere's something fundamentally
wrong them going from 28 to 103,"
Wadler said. "If we had this per
centage increase in the general
population, it would be on the
evening news as a national epi
demic. It's an outrageous number."
Overall, though. Selig and Fehr
found a far friendlier audience
than they did on March 17, 2005,
when they were chastised and
grilled by the same committee for a
lax steroids program. That 11 -hour
hearing is best remembered for
Mark McGwire's infamous and
oft-repeated phrase,"l'm not here
to talk about the past," and Rafael
Palmeiro's finger-wagging denial
of steroid use only months before
failing a drug test.
"I'm proud of the progress
we've made. I never delude myself,
because I know there's always
more work to be done," Selig said
after Tuesday's hearing."But when
you think of where we were three
years ago to where we are ... 1 ap
preciated the response from them
today."
In the aftermath of the 2005
hearing, baseball and the union
agreed to toughen their drug poli

cy, including harsher penalties,
more testing and a ban on amphet
amines.
In his opening statement, Selig
vowed to do more, including test
ing top prospects before the ama
teur draft. He also reiterated a will
ingness to test for human growth
hormone "when a valid, commer
cially available and practical test
for UGH becomes reality, regard
less of whether the test is based on
blood or urine."
Fehr, in turn, said the union has
agreed to "allow players to be sus
pended for HGH use based on ev
idence other than a positive test."
He and Selig said they met in
December to discuss the Mitchell
Report's recommendations and
plan to meet again.
"I hope we have all of this com
pleted before spring training."
Selig said.
Not every exchange with the law
makers was easy.
"This scandal happened under
your watch. I want that to sink in. It
did." Maryland Democrat Elijah
Cummings told Selig and Fehr, fre
quent adversaries seated side-by
side at the witness table after
Mitchell finished. "Do you accept
responsibility for this scandal or do
you think there was nothing you
could do to prevent it?"
Fehr paused for several sec
onds.
"Did we or did I appreciate the
depth of the problem? ... The an
swer is 'No,'" Fehr replied. "It's a
failure that we didn't, and it's a fail
ure that 1 didn't."
Selig then followed, starting by
saying he's agonized over the ques
tion.
"Do I wish we could have react
ed quicker? Should we have? One
could make the case," the commis
sioner said. "All of us have to take
responsibility, starting with me."
Before any testimony, commit
tee chairman Henry Waxman an
nounced he and ranking Republi
can Tom Davis asked the Justice
Department to look into whether
Tejada lied to committee staffers
when questioned in connection to
Palmeiro's perjury case in 2(X)5.
"Tejada told the committee that
he never used illegal performance
enhancing drugs and that he had no
knowledge of other players using or
even talking about steroids," Wax
man said. "Well, the Mitchell Re
port, however, directly contradicts
key elements of Mr. Tejada's testi
mony."
Palmeiro said his positive test
might have resulted from a B-12 vi
tamin injection given to him by Teja
da — at the time, a teammate on the
Baltimore Orioles
— and the committee concluded
there was insufficient evidence to
refer Palmeiro's case to the Justice
Department.
In the Mitchell Report, Adam
Piatt, Tejada's former teammate
with the Oakland Athletics, said he
provided Tejada with steroids and
HGH in 2003. Mitchell also included
copies of checks allegedly written by
Tejada to Piatt in March 2003 for
$3".IOC) and $3,200.
"We will review and respond to
the letter from Chairman Waxman
and Rep. Davis," Justice Depart
ment spokesman Peter Carr said.
Late in the day came news that
Tejada's older brother. Freddy, was
killed in a motorcycle accident in the
Dominican Republic, according to
the Aguilas Cibaenas. the shortstop's
winter league team. Tejada, sched
uled to play Tuesday night, wasn't at
the ballpark and could not immedi
ately be reached for comment.
Waxman raised Bonds' name

during Selig's appearance, asking
the commissioner whether the Gi
ants should have reported their con
cerns about Bonds' trainer. Greg
Anderson, and the slugger's alleged
steroid use to the commissioner's of
fice.
"Of course," Selig responded.
Pressed by Waxman about
whether Giants general manager
Brian Sabean violated baseball rules
by not doing so, Selig said: "It's a
matter that 1 have under review,"
perhaps hinting that Sabean or other
team officials could face discipline.
Waxman also expressed concern
that, according to the report. Giants
owner Peter Mugowan's lawyer
called Mitchell to say Magowan
"misspoke" about Bonds' possible
use of steroids.
" Hiis incident shows why it's im
portant for baseball's management
to take the problem of steroids seri
ously. It's possible that the BALCO
scandal could have been averted if
Brian Sabean and Peter Magowan
acted in a responsible fashion." Wax
man said. "Instead, they seemed
more intent on protecting Bonds."
Magowan issued a statement that
did not directly address the Bonds-
Anderson issue, saying instead the
Giants "pledge to embrace every
necessary reform to address" the
steroids problem.
Since last month's release of the
Mitchell Report, the focus largely
has been on Clemens, who has been
asked to testify at a Feb. 13 hearing,
along with his former trainer, Brian
McNamee. Clemens has vehemently
denied McNamee's allegations.
"You continue to feel comfort
able with Mr. McNamee's credibili
ty?" Waxman asked.
"We believe that the statements
provided to us were truthful,"
Mitchell said, adding McNamee was
interviewed three times.

depth of the problem? ... The an
swer is 'No,'" Fehr replied. "It's a
failure that we didn't, and it's a fail
ure that 1 didn't."
Selig then followed, starting by
saying he's agonized over the ques
tion.
"Do I wish we could have react
ed quicker? Should we have? One
could make the case," the commis
sioner said. "All of us have to take
responsibility, starting with me."
Before any testimony, commit
tee chairman Henry Waxman an
nounced he and ranking Republi
can Tom Davis asked the Justice
Department to look into whether
Tejada lied to committee staffers
when questioned in connection to
Palmeiro's perjury case in 2(X)5.
"Tejada told the committee that
he never used illegal performance
enhancing drugs and that he had no
knowledge of other players using or
even talking about steroids," Wax
man said. "Well, the Mitchell Re
port, however, directly contradicts
key elements of Mr. Tejada's testi
mony."
Palmeiro said his positive test
might have resulted from a B-12 vi
tamin injection given to him by Teja
da — at the time, a teammate on the
Baltimore Orioles
— and the committee concluded
there was insufficient evidence to
refer Palmeiro's case to the Justice
Department.
In the Mitchell Report, Adam
Piatt, Tejada's former teammate
with the Oakland Athletics, said he
provided Tejada with steroids and
HGH in 2003. Mitchell also included
copies of checks allegedly written by
Tejada to Piatt in March 2003 for
$3".IOC) and $3,200.
"We will review and respond to
the letter from Chairman Waxman
and Rep. Davis," Justice Depart
ment spokesman Peter Carr said.
Late in the day came news that
Tejada's older brother. Freddy, was
killed in a motorcycle accident in the
Dominican Republic, according to
the Aguilas Cibaenas. the shortstop's
winter league team. Tejada, sched
uled to play Tuesday night, wasn't at
the ballpark and could not immedi
ately be reached for comment.
Waxman raised Bonds' name

during Selig's appearance, asking
the commissioner whether the Gi
ants should have reported their con
cerns about Bonds' trainer. Greg
Anderson, and the slugger's alleged
steroid use to the commissioner's of
fice.
"Of course," Selig responded.
Pressed by Waxman about
whether Giants general manager
Brian Sabean violated baseball rules
by not doing so, Selig said: "It's a
matter that 1 have under review,"
perhaps hinting that Sabean or other
team officials could face discipline.
Waxman also expressed concern
that, according to the report. Giants
owner Peter Mugowan's lawyer
called Mitchell to say Magowan
"misspoke" about Bonds' possible
use of steroids.
" Hiis incident shows why it's im
portant for baseball's management
to take the problem of steroids seri
ously. It's possible that the BALCO
scandal could have been averted if
Brian Sabean and Peter Magowan
acted in a responsible fashion." Wax
man said. "Instead, they seemed
more intent on protecting Bonds."
Magowan issued a statement that
did not directly address the Bonds-
Anderson issue, saying instead the
Giants "pledge to embrace every
necessary reform to address" the
steroids problem.
Since last month's release of the
Mitchell Report, the focus largely
has been on Clemens, who has been
asked to testify at a Feb. 13 hearing,
along with his former trainer, Brian
McNamee. Clemens has vehemently
denied McNamee's allegations.
"You continue to feel comfort
able with Mr. McNamee's credibili
ty?" Waxman asked.
"We believe that the statements
provided to us were truthful,"
Mitchell said, adding McNamee was
interviewed three times.

Taking on baseball's steroids
problem once again. Congress
kept the finger-pointing and tough
questioning to a minimum. Maybe
that's because the people under
the most scrutiny this time
Miguel Tejada, Barry Bonds,
Roger Clemens — were nowhere
to be seen.
Commissioner Bud Selig and
union leader Donald Fehr accept
ed responsibility for the sport's
drug boom and the author of the
Mitchell Report defended his find
ings in the same wood-paneled
House hearing room that hosted a
far longer and far more con
tentious session in March 2005.
It didn't take long for the focus
to shift to players Tuesday.
The hearing opened with word
that Congress wants Tejada, the
2002 AL MVP. investigated for
lying to federal authorities. 'ITie
first witness, former Senate major
ity leader George Mitchell, testi
fied he believes a former trainer's
allegations that he injected seven
time Cy Young Award winner
Clemens with steroids and human
growth hormone. And Selig told
lawmakers that Bonds' San Fran
cisco Giants should have reported
concerns about the home run
king's personal trainer.
The 4-hour. 15-minute session
before the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee
also exposed what might be the lat
est drugs abused by the sport's
stars: Ritalin and Adderall, stimu
lants better known as treatments
for hyperactive kids. According to
data provided to the committee by

MLB and the union, a copy of
which was obtained by The Associ
ated Press, thc're were 35 " ITiera
peutic Use Exemptions" for drugs
in 2006. of which 28 were for ADD
and ADHD medications. In 2007,
the exemptions skyrocketed to
111. of which 103 were for ADD
and ADHD
"It seems to be a little bit odd,
said Dr. Gary Wadler, chairman of
committee that determines the
World Anti-Doping Agency's
banned-substances list. "I'm the
guy who made the issue three
years ago about amphetamines,
and baseball said they didn't have
a problem with greenies."
One of Mitchell's recommen
dations was that baseball needs an
independent agency to handle
drug testing, and the data about
ADD drugs supports that, Wadler
said.
"This demands an explanation.
ITiere's something fundamentally
wrong them going from 28 to 103,"
Wadler said. "If we had this per
centage increase in the general
population, it would be on the
evening news as a national epi
demic. It's an outrageous number."
Overall, though. Selig and Fehr
found a far friendlier audience
than they did on March 17, 2005,
when they were chastised and
grilled by the same committee for a
lax steroids program. That 11 -hour
hearing is best remembered for
Mark McGwire's infamous and
oft-repeated phrase,"l'm not here
to talk about the past," and Rafael
Palmeiro's finger-wagging denial
of steroid use only months before
failing a drug test.
"I'm proud of the progress
we've made. I never delude myself,
because I know there's always
more work to be done," Selig said
after Tuesday's hearing."But when
you think of where we were three
years ago to where we are ... 1 ap
preciated the response from them
today."
In the aftermath of the 2005
hearing, baseball and the union
agreed to toughen their drug poli

cy, including harsher penalties,
more testing and a ban on amphet
amines.
In his opening statement, Selig
vowed to do more, including test
ing top prospects before the ama
teur draft. He also reiterated a will
ingness to test for human growth
hormone "when a valid, commer
cially available and practical test
for UGH becomes reality, regard
less of whether the test is based on
blood or urine."
Fehr, in turn, said the union has
agreed to "allow players to be sus
pended for HGH use based on ev
idence other than a positive test."
He and Selig said they met in
December to discuss the Mitchell
Report's recommendations and
plan to meet again.
"I hope we have all of this com
pleted before spring training."
Selig said.
Not every exchange with the law
makers was easy.
"This scandal happened under
your watch. I want that to sink in. It
did." Maryland Democrat Elijah
Cummings told Selig and Fehr, fre
quent adversaries seated side-by
side at the witness table after
Mitchell finished. "Do you accept
responsibility for this scandal or do
you think there was nothing you
could do to prevent it?"
Fehr paused for several sec
onds.
"Did we or did I appreciate the
depth of the problem? ... The an
swer is 'No,'" Fehr replied. "It's a
failure that we didn't, and it's a fail
ure that 1 didn't."
Selig then followed, starting by
