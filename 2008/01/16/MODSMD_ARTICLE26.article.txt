A woman is seeking an arrest warrant against
suspended Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam
"Pacman" Jones, claiming he punched her at an
Atlanta strip club.
Fulton County Magistrate Court officials
told The Associated Press on Tuesday that
Wanda S. Jackson asked for the warrant after a
Jan. 3 altercation at the Body Tap Strip Club.
Jackson, an attorney,says in her filing that she
was in the club's office when an angry Jones ac
cused managers of stealing his money and
bracelet.
"1 was sitting in the office and he lunged at
me numerous times in an effort to do grave bod
ily harm." Jackson wrote in the warrant applica
tion filed Jan. 7."Veronica Jones, an owner, went
into the hall to deal with a member of his en
tourage. I followed to gawk. He was in the hall,
surprisingly reached over or around a security
guard and sucker punched me in my left eye."
Jackson told police the next day she was at
the club because she was handling a divorce case

that involved Adam Jones. No one could be
reached Tuesday afternoon at the club's listed
phone number.
"Mr. Jones, according to Ms. Jackson, was at
the Body Tap Club and she and Mr. Jones got
into an argument at the club and Mr. Jones
struck Ms. Jackson in the left eye, causing a
bruise around her left eye." according to the po
lice report.
Jackson did not immediately return a phone
message requesting comment. Jones' attorney
Manny Arora said no warrant has been issued
against his client.
Norris Arnold, a court support manager for
Fulton County, said a magistrate judge will re
view Jackson's application on Feb. 8 to deter
mine whether the warrant will be filed.
Last month. Jones pleaded no contest to a
disorderly conduct charge related to a strip club
shooting in Las Vegas that left club manager
Tommy Urbanski paralyzed.
Also Tuesday night, the NFL filed a motion in
Nevada to be dismissed from a lawsuit by Ur
banski.
A judge already dismissed the Titans from
the suit last Wednesday,saying the team couldn't
be responsible for Jones' actions at the Minxx
Gentleman's Club last Feb. I 1 ).
The lawsuit filed Oct. 19 sought unspecified
damages from Jones, the NFL, the Titans and the
owners of Harlem Knights, a Houston strip club

that rented the Las Vegas club for the party the
night of the shooting, during NBA All-Star
weekend.
A hearing for the NFL's motion is scheduled
for Feb. 20 in Clark County District Court
Clark County District Attorney David Roger
said the new accusations could affect his crimi
nal case against Jones. With his plea, Jones
agreed to a year probation, random drug testing,
community service and anger management
classes.
"We have negotiated with Mr. Jones in ex
change for his assistance in an attempted mm
der case.This doesn't help his case if he is found
guilty," Roger told I"he Associated Press on
Tiiesday.
Jones has been arrested six times since being
drafted sixth overall in 2005. including two ar
rests in Georgia in 2006 that the Titans did not
learn about until 2007. Jones was suspended for
the 2007 season by NFL commissioner Roger
Goodell in April.
"As we have said throughout his suspension,
we will not comment on Adam Jones until he is
reinstated by the commissioner," the Titans said
in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
Jones was allowed to go to the Titans' head
quarters once their season ended with an AFC
wild-card loss in San Diego on Jan. 6. Hut the
NFL plans to review his status following the Pro
Bowl.
