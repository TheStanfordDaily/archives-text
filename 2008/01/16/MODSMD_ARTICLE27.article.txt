## Engineers win award for blood circulation device 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
A team of eight Stanford under
graduate and graduate students de
signed an electrical device to pre
vent blood clots during air travel,
leading to a first place finish at the
31st annual Advancing 1 lispanic Ex
cellence in Technology. Engineering.
Math and Science (AHETEMS)
Design Competition at the end of
autumn quarter.
The Stanford engineers received
$5,000 for best fulfilling the assign
ment to design a marketable and
technically sound product for use in
the aerospace industry. In order to
complete this goal, the team spent
weeks brainstorming, researching,
designing, building and testing their
product, as well as writing a techni
cal paper on the product and finally
presenting it to a panel of judges at
the competition.
Through the application of elec
trical circuits, the team's "Blood Cir
culation Device" improves the circu
lation of airline passengers during
long flights. The device creates an
electrical impulse designed to stimu
late passengers' muscles and in
crease blood circulation to the heart
and lungs.
Ideally, widespread use of the de
vice could prevent pulmonary em
bolisms. which threaten the lives of
travelers forced to remain immobile

for long periods of time on these
flights.
According to a press release, the
team consisted of Ricky Villarreal
'09, Francisco Olmos '09, Ana Pena
'09, Israel Rojas '08. Erica Salazar
'10. Anthony Wang '09 and team
mentors Gabriel Sanchez and An
drea Solis, both mechanical engi
neering graduate students.
Though all team members were
engineering students, none was ma
joring in Electrical Engineering,
which made working with electricity
an added challenge.
Carnegie Mellon University took
second place and San Francisco
State University finished third at the
competition, which drew a crowd of
approximately 5,000 Hispanic stu
dents, professionals, community
leaders and corporate representa
tives. The event is the largest nation
al conference for Hispanic engi
neers.
According to its Web site,
AHETEMS works "exclusively to
develop educational enrichment
and academic outreach initiatives,
for Latinos/as, that extend through
out the pre-college to Ph.D. path
way."
AHETEMS is affiliated with the
Society of Hispanic Professional En
gineers (SHPE), an organization
that has an active chapter at Stan
ford.

Stanford engineers travelled to Philadelphia for an aerospace industry product design conference at the end of last quarter. Their device, which uses electrical
circuits to increase blood circulation for passengers on long flights, took first place for a $5,000 grand prize.
