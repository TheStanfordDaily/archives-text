## Escondido water main bursts 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
A water main hurst on Escondido Road at ap
proximately 10:30 p.m. yesterday, causing water to
gush out onto the street for more than 90 minutes
late last night. The water threatened to flood Bran
ner and Kimball Halls before the Department of Fa
cility Operations (FacOps) managed to turn off and
isolate the water pipe from operation shortly after
midnight, preventing damage to the buildings.
Chris Sicchio, a FacOps water systems technician,
was in charge of dealing with the situation.

"A six-inch lake water main burst." Sicchio said. "I
managed to isolate the valves on Campus [Drive]
and Arguello [Way] and Campus [Drive] and Serra
Street, and turned off the water supply to the corre
sponding pipe, which solved the problem."
Ilie initial break occurred on Escondido Road,
just outside of the main entrance of Toyon I fall, and
the water gushed out of the broken pipe and rushed
east toward Branner and Kimball, flooding much of
that side of the road. Cars parked on Escondido
Road could be seen with their front tires submerged
