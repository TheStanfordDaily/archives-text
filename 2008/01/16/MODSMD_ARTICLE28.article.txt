## Escondido water main bursts 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
A water main hurst on Escondido Road at ap
proximately 10:30 p.m. yesterday, causing water to
gush out onto the street for more than 90 minutes
late last night. The water threatened to flood Bran
ner and Kimball Halls before the Department of Fa
cility Operations (FacOps) managed to turn off and
isolate the water pipe from operation shortly after
midnight, preventing damage to the buildings.
Chris Sicchio, a FacOps water systems technician,
was in charge of dealing with the situation.

"A six-inch lake water main burst." Sicchio said. "I
managed to isolate the valves on Campus [Drive]
and Arguello [Way] and Campus [Drive] and Serra
Street, and turned off the water supply to the corre
sponding pipe, which solved the problem."
Ilie initial break occurred on Escondido Road,
just outside of the main entrance of Toyon I fall, and
the water gushed out of the broken pipe and rushed
east toward Branner and Kimball, flooding much of
that side of the road. Cars parked on Escondido
Road could be seen with their front tires submerged
under nearly a foot of dark, muddy
water. The sidewalk on that side of
the street was also under water.
While Sicchio could not provide
a definite reason for the initial
break, he said that pipes break for a
variety of reasons.
"The age of the pipes is a big de
terminant." he said. "These pipes
are old. and that is what most likelv

caused the problem. Other issues
could he a tree root pushing on it. or
an earthquake â€” which wasn't the
case this time."
A number of police officers from
the Department of Public Safety
(DPS) were the first on the scene,
responding to a call from a Branner
Resident Assistant (RA). DPS
Deputy Victor Lee explained that
since the police did not have the
necessary tools to deal with such a
situation, they were only there to
provide assistance if required.
"We are on the scene in case the
situation becomes worse." Lee said.

"We want to prevent damage to
property, and. if needed, we are im
mediately on hand to evacuate and
advise residents."
Branner. Kimball and Toyon
Halls were not directly affected bv
the stream of muddy water, which
nearly flooded both Branner and
Kimball but was turned off before it
managed to reach the buildings.
"Since the water was lake water
from Felt Lake and Searsville Lake,
it only affects the sprinkler systems,
and water to the buildings remains
uninterrupted," Lee said. "If it was
domestic water, we would bring out

our 24-hour on-call team to deal
with the situation immediately."
While there was no damage to
the buildings, the force of water
eroded portions of Escondido
Road.
"The asphalt has been eroded
away and lifted up," said Lee. "'Hiis
poses a risk to the public, since we
do not know what the status of the
road is at the moment."
At press time. DPS had cordoned
off the damaged section of road to
make the public aware of the situa
tion.
Sicchio added that a team from

FacOps would probably be dis
patched in the early hours of the
morning in order to deal with the
road and water pipe. He also said
that the University has a good water
system, and such accidents do not
occur frequently.
Some students left their dorm
rooms and came out into the street
to observe the situation.
"It looked oddly like a horizon
tal waterfall." said Claire Kouba '11.
"It was amusing to see."
