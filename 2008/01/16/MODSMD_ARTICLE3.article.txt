## Rumsfeld debate rages on ASSU considers asking Rumsfeld to speak 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The heated debate over the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a
distinguished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution continued at last
night's ASSIJ Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting following the introduc
tion of a bill to invite the former
Secretary of Defense to speak on
campus.
Senator Sarah Golabek-Gold
man 10. who serves as chair of the
Campus Advocacy Committee, au
thored the bill, which would "invite
former Secretary Rumsfeld to par
ticipate in a forum, open to mem
bers of the University community."
Golabek-Goldman hopes that by
discussing his legacy and answering
questions from members of the
Stanford community, Rumsfeld
would "advance the knowledge of
the University community hosting
him."
The bill also puts pressure on the
Hoover Institution to "explicitly en
courage Secretary Rumsfeld to ac
cept the invitation."
"If [Rumsfeld] rejects the invita
tion by the Undergraduate Senate,
he would deny the 6.654 students
that it represents," Golabek-Gold
man said in a prepared statement to
the Senate.
In the case that Rumsfeld does
not accept the Senate's invitation
within 30 days,the bill states that the
Campus Advocacy Committee
"shall proceed with hosting an event
to proliferate knowledge of Donald
Rumsfeld's tenure as Secretary of
Defense."
Such an event would host both
University professors and Hoover
Institution representatives to ex
pound on the criteria used to ap
point Rumsfeld as a distinguished
visiting fellow. Golabek-Goldman
said she would also like I loover rep
resentatives to speak on the work
the former Secretary would be
doing, as well as the relationship be
tween the Hoover Institution and
the University.
The bill, which is sponsored by
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Priyanka Sharma '09. sparked de
bate after the Senate meeting be
tween Golabek-Goldman and Sen
ator Stuart Baimel '09.
"The Undergraduate Senate has
better things to be spending its time
on than inviting people," Baimel
said. "1 think it's clear that the Un
dergraduate Senate supports politi
cal activism, and I think it's clear
that we recognize there's debate
over the Rumsfeld issue. I'm not
sure what this bill would do that
isn't already clear on public
record."
Golabek-Goldman said she and
other Senators do not expect Rums
feld to accept their invitation, but

by sending him a public invitation
the ASSU would not be account
able for failing to respond to stu
dent concerns.
"If [Rumsfeld] turns down our
invitation and it's made public, then
he'll be accountable," Golabek-
Goldman said. "He's now part of
the Stanford community."
Baimel said he believes the bill is
not necessary because its language
does not express a position on
whether the Senate would like
Rumsfeld to speak or not.
"Rumsfeld is under no obliga
tion to speak." Baimel said.
"Frankly, we should not be inviting
him if we know he's not going to
speak. That's just a waste of our
time and a waste of the Hoover In
stitution's time."
In the end, the heated conversa
tion between Golabek-Goldman
and Baimel did not sway either.
"Someone needs to oppose the
bill," Baimel said. "I am the one
who's going to oppose it."
