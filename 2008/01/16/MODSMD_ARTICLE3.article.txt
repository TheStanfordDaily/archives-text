### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The heated debate over the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a
distinguished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution continued at last
night's ASSIJ Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting following the introduc
tion of a bill to invite the former
Secretary of Defense to speak on
campus.
Senator Sarah Golabek-Gold
man 10. who serves as chair of the
Campus Advocacy Committee, au
thored the bill, which would "invite
former Secretary Rumsfeld to par
ticipate in a forum, open to mem
bers of the University community."
Golabek-Goldman hopes that by
discussing his legacy and answering
questions from members of the
Stanford community, Rumsfeld
would "advance the knowledge of
the University community hosting
him."
The bill also puts pressure on the
Hoover Institution to "explicitly en
courage Secretary Rumsfeld to ac
cept the invitation."
"If [Rumsfeld] rejects the invita
tion by the Undergraduate Senate,
he would deny the 6.654 students
that it represents," Golabek-Gold
man said in a prepared statement to
the Senate.
In the case that Rumsfeld does
not accept the Senate's invitation
within 30 days,the bill states that the
Campus Advocacy Committee
"shall proceed with hosting an event
to proliferate knowledge of Donald
Rumsfeld's tenure as Secretary of
Defense."
Such an event would host both
University professors and Hoover
Institution representatives to ex
pound on the criteria used to ap
point Rumsfeld as a distinguished
visiting fellow. Golabek-Goldman
said she would also like I loover rep
resentatives to speak on the work
