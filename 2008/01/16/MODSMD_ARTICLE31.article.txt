## Sen. McCain promises S.C. victory 
### TOM RAUM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHARLESTON, SC. - Republi
can presidential candidate John
McCain said on Thursday that de
spite his second-place finish in
Michigan's GOP primary he in
tends to win this state's first-in-the-
South contest.
The Arizona senator told sup
porters he would prevail in the
state that eight years ago derailed
his candidacy.
"Tonight, my friends, we con
gratulate another candidate's cam
paign but tomorrow we get up and
fight," said the Arizona senator,
who flew here late Tuesday
evening to await the Michigan re
turns.
After a victory in last week's
New Hampshire primary. McCain
had led in national polls. But the
Michigan victory for former Mass
achusetts Gov. Mitt Romney fur
ther scrambled the dynamics.
McCain got 30 percent of the
vote, to 39 percent for Romney.
Earlier, McCain told The Asso
ciated Press he had just talked to
Romney to congratulate him on
his victory. "Starting tomorrow,
we're going to win South Carolina,
and we're going to go on and win
the nomination," he said.
"1 congratulate him on that
Michigan welcomed their native
son with their support," McCain

added. Romney was raised in
Michigan and his father, George
Romney, was governor and a 1%8
presidential contender.
"1 said we would win in New
Hampshire. We will win in South
Carolina," McCain said.
Asked to respond to Romney's
comments that his win was "a vic
tory of optimism over Washington
style pessimism," the four-term
senator passed on commenting,
saying. "1 would not know what
he's talking about."
In his session with supporters,
McCain said, "For a minute there
in New Hampshire. I thought this
campaign might be getting easier.
But you know what? We've gotten
pretty good at doing things the
hard way too. I think we've shown
them we don't mind a fight."
"We're going to fight for your
votes, we're going to win this pri
mary and the nomination of our
party and we're going to be proud
of the way we do it."he said.
After campaigning intensely in
Michigan, McCain quickly shifted
his attention to South Carolina.
He'll spend the next four days
campaigning here.
McCain is hopeful for a strong
showing in South Carolina, where
his military background should
provide a big help, and he needs to
show that he's competitive in the
South.
But South Carolina has been a

disappointment for him in the past.
In 2(KM). he won the New Hamp
shire primary only to see his cam
paign run into a wall in South Car
olina, where George W. Bush
emerged victorious and went on to
wrap up the GOP nomination.
Also, among his rivals this time
are two southerners - former
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee
and former Tennessee Sen. Fred
Thompson - who are mounting
strong challenges.
McCain, who is leading in na
tional polls, won the Michigan pri
mary eight years ago on the
strength of independent and De
mocrat ic-c rosso ve r voters.
McCain began running an ad in
the state Tuesday involving his
longtime public service.Though he
did not mention it. his more than
five years spent as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam are well known
and give him significant stature
among active and retired members
of the military. About 413.0(H) vet
erans are estimated to be living in
South Carolina and hundreds
more residents are among the mil
itary's active duty and reserves.
The state also is in the midst of its
largest, single-unit deployment of
National Guard troops since
World War 11.
