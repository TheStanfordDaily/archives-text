## Huckabee eyes Southern comfort 
### LIBBY QUAID THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LEXINGTON. S.C. - Mike Huck
abee, nursing a second third-place
finish in northern states, looked
ahead to the South where he hopes
his Arkansas roots and Baptist back
ground will put him back on a win
ning track in South Carolina.
"Ladies and gentlemen we're
going to win South Carolina," he de
clared to supporters in Lexington.
I luckabee, the winner of the lowa
caucuses, has emerged from the back of
the pack into an improbable contender.
But he hits since had to watch John Mc-
Cain win New I lampshire and,now,Mitt
Romney win Michigan. 1 le is staking his
new foothold on South Carolina's social
conservatives and religious voters as well
as young working-class voters attracted
to his economic populist message. South
Carolina's GOP primary is Saturday
"We put a flag in the ground here
Saturday,'' he said of the state." We're
going to make it real clear that the
first-in-the-South primary is going to
give their support to the first-in-the-
South candidate."
Ihe state is more familiar ground
for the folksy ordained Baptist min
ister. More than half of the state's
likely Republican voters are white
evangelicals, according to the Pew
Research Center for the People &
the Press. It was those voters who
carried I luckabee to victory in lowa.
But there are no guarantees for
the former Arkansas governor. Ac

cording to exit polls in Michigan,
about four in 10 voters in the GOP
contest called themselves born-again
or evangelical Christians, and they
split about evenly between Huck
abee and Romney. In New Hamp
shire last week, those voters split
evenly among Huckabee, Romney
and McCain.
Huckabee will compete for those
voters in South Carolina with Rom
ney and Fred Thompson, the former
Tennessee senator and television
actor who is staking the life of his
campaign on a victory in South Car
olina.
"Whatever it takes, we're in it for the
long haul," I luckabee said on CNN.
As he did in Michigan. Huckabee
was expected to rally pastors to help
turn out their flocks. He draws heavy
support from parents who home
school their children, a small but ac
tively engaged bloc that populate his
cadre of volunteers. Huckabee re
peated one of his favorite applause
lines Tuesday, telling supporters,
"Mothers and fathers raise better
kids than governments do."
Huckabee has drawn distinctions
with his rivals over abortion and gay
marriage by calling for constitutional
amendments to ban both.Thompson
and McCain oppose same-sex mar
riage but stop short of calling for a
constitutional amendment. On abor
tion, Huckabee is alone in calling for
a constitutional amendment.
"I believe it's a lot easier to
change the Constitution than it

would be to change the word of the
living God." Huckabee said Monday
night in Warren, Mich. "And that's
what we need to do, is to amend the
Constitution so it's in God's stan
dards, rather than try to change
God's standards."
He also talked tough on immigra
tion. Arriving Tuesday in Rock Hill,
S.C., Huckabee called for suspending
immigration from countries that
sponsor or harbor terrorists, going
further than any of his rivals in pro
posing to clamp down on immigra
tion.
"1 say we ought to put a hiatus on
people who come in here ... if they
come from countries that sponsor
and harbor terrorists," he said. "Let's
say, until you get your act in order,
and we get our act in order, we're not
going to just let you keep coming and
threaten the future and safety of
America."
His 'campaign quickly back
tracked; Huckabee dropped the
issue in his next speech, and an advis
er. Jim Pinkerton.said Huckabee re
ally meant he wants a "thorough re
view" of immigration problems.
He has appealed for working
class voters by saying he was the first
among the Republican candidates to
recognize economic hardships that
many Americans face.
"If you spend some time listening
to people you're going to find that
there's a world of hurt out there in
America,"he told his South Carolina
supporters.
