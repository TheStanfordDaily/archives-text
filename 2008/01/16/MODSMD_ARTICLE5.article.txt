## Student develops anti-spam program New filter is more user-friendly than alternatives 
### ANDREA SY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If regular filters can't stop spam
from taking over your inbox, computer
science graduate student David Erick
son has got your back with Default Off
Email (DOEmail), which Erickson de
veloped in tandem with Associate Pro
fessor of Computer Science and Elec
trical Engineering Nick McKeown.
DOEmail is a free anti-spam tool
that is similar to a buddy list for instant
messengers and allows users to broad
ly categorize received mail. There are
three basic groups: a list for people you
want mail from, a list for people you
don't want mail from and the unknown
for all uncategorized addresses.
Emails received and classified
under "unknown" generate an auto-re

sponse from DOEmail — a form is
sent back to the sender in order to ver
ify that the sender is human. The
sender then has three weeks to re
spond.
According to Erickson. DOEmail
can help users regain control of their
in boxes.
"Spam is a serious problem — 74 to
95 percent of email received is spam,
and DOEmail is a simple solution that
gives a lot of power to the user," he
said. DOEmail includes options that
allow users to micromanage their spam
control or to merely set broad filters
and let the program do the rest.
According to Erickson, who com
pleted his undergraduate education at
the University of Utah, these options
set DOEmail apart from other sys
tems.
When asked to compare other anti
spam tools like content filtering with
his project, Erickson responded that
these programs "aren't as effective"
and that DOEmail is "more user
friendly." DOEmail has a plug-in for
Mozilla Thunderbird and is accessi
ble to anyone who wants to use it.
The research project seems suc
cessful so far — a number of facul
ty, staff, students and people off
campus have been trying out DOE
mail and have not received any
spam. The project currently has 35
users: however, since Erickson and
McKeown are also hoping to pro
duce an academic paper on the

project, they need about 200 total
users in order to make a credible as
sessment.
In an effort to gain support from
the community, they are also con
sidering giving away two iPhones or
iPod Touches in a contest to pro
mote their project. A user must use
DOEmail for 30 days in order to be
eligible to win. Another way to win
is to be one of the first two people to
sign up 30 other friends (as long as
those friends also stay active for 30
days). ITiis promotion lasts until
Mar. 1.
