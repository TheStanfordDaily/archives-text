### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
Emeritus Psychology Prof. Philip
Ximhardo, famous for leading the
l l )71 Stanford Prison Experiment, re
ceived the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion's 2007 Richard W. Lyman Award
for "enthusiastic participation" in vol
unteer service for the University.
Hie Lyman Award, established in
l l )S3 in honor of Stanford's former
president, includes funding toward
books and materials for the Stanford
University Libraries in areas of special
interest designated by the recipient.
"I am privileged to receive one of
the great honors that a faculty mem
ber c;in receive at Stanford," Zimbar

do said. "It reflects service broadly
conceived that former President
Lyman brought to the I Jniversity."
Zimbardo, who taught his last
Psych I class last year, began teaching
at Stanford in 1%8. During his career,
he also lectured around the world and
organized summer psychology pro
grams.
'Hic renowned Prison Experiment
was inspired by a theoretical interest
in understanding how generally good
people's actions could be negatively
influenced by social situations. Zim
bardo's experimental technique was
made illegal shortly after Ins shocking
results were published.
"The idea was to understand the in
fluence that institutions like prisons can
have in undermining and transforming
individuals," he said. "When embedded
in new and unfamiliar settings, our ha-
bitual ways of thinking, feeling and
acting no longer function to sustain
the moral compass that has guided us
reliably in the past."
Zimbardo's most recent book.
"The Lucifer Effect: Understand
ing How Good People Turn Evil."
due to be released on Jan. 22, draws
on the Prison Experiment to under
stand how easy it is for ordinary
people to be seduced into engaging
in evil deeds.
Though he now enjoys emeritus
status. Zimbardo and his research
are well known by students around
campus.

"Zimbardo's Prison Experi
ment showed us that we are all a lot
less independent than we'd like to
believe." said Brian Howald '09.
"However. I'd like to believe that
those who can be led to do morally
abhorrent deeds are also capable
of acting in the best interest of oth
ers."
Zavain Dar TO compared the re
sults of Zimbardo's psychological
experiment to present day abuses
in prisons around the world.
"Although Zimbardo's social
science research is unparalleled
thus far. 1 hope it isn't used to justi
fy torture in war in the future." he
said.
Zimbardo's current research is
focused on adding a new dimension
to the term commonly known as
"heroism."

"Although the most vibrant an
tidote to evil is a hero, we have
erred too long on focusing on fan
tastic heroes in comic hooks that
people can never be â€” life-long
heroes like Gandhi and [Nelson]
Mandela who have organized their
whole lives around the communi
ty," he said."But most heroes are of
the moment, they are ordinary
people who act on the behalf of
others when everyone around
them doesn't."
Zimbardo will be lecturing
about his new research endeavor at
the Law School on Jan. 23 at 12:45
p.m. There will also be a book sign
ing of "The Lucifer Effect" at 5 p.m.
at the Stanford Bookstore.
