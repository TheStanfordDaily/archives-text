## Graduate Life The
						Real World: Crothers Hall Residents respond to new undergraduate neighbors 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
For perhaps the first time in Stanford resi
dential history, an unexpected twist of fate
has brought two tribes, two sets of sworn
enemies, together. As students returned
from a quarter abroad, the housing crunch
forced several undergraduates into the basement of
Crothers Hall — effectively tearing down the wall
between graduates students and their younger, less
educated counterparts.
Tensions ran high as graduate students learned
of the development.
"I didn't even know there were undergraduates
in this dorm," replied one student, when asked to
comment. "Why would they want to live here?"
"1 knew that there were some undergraduates
living in the basement," said Gary Lu, a first-year
master's student in the CS department. Lu's neigh
bor. Franklin Lee, had been assigned to live there
originally. According to Lu. he had nothing good to

say about it.
"I wouldn't want to live down there," said Lu.
"Franklin said that the rooms were close to the me
chanical systems, so it was always noisy. He also
mentioned that pipes go through it and you can
hear the sounds they make." Lee himself was un
able to be reached for comment.
Nathan Ng, a second-year mechanical engineer
ing graduate student, also sympathized.
"Over the summer, I didn't have a housing as
signment," said Ng. "At the end of the summer,
they assigned me to the basement of Crothers. 1
went there and didn't like it at all; it was horrible —
no air ventilation — and it just gave off an eerie
feeling."
Ng petitioned the Housing assignment offices
repeatedly. Ultimately, a room opened up on the
first floor.
"The advice I would give to the undergrads is
keep on petitioning to get out of there," he added.
Whether he genuinely had their interests at heart,
however — or simply sought their removal — was
unclear.

Others welcomed the undergraduate presence.
Katie Clevenger, a co-terminal student, found
out about the basement residents the first week she
returned to school.
"1 met my next-door neighbor and found out she
was an undergraduate," she said. "Our CA told us
about the undergraduates living in the basement as
well."
"Crothers feels like a dorm." Clevenger added.
"But the social interactions are very different.
Crothers has a name for itself on campus as not
being particularly social."
For the residents of Crothers hall, the under
graduate presence has certainly been a revolution
ary, if unsettling one.
"Because of the undergraduates here in the
basement. I've noticed the dorm seems a little more
noisy, in a good way," Clevenger said. "There seem
to be more people knocking and things, like trying
to get into the dorm."
