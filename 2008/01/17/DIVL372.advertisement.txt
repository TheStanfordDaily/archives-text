Sayyad is a famous actor, film director, satirist, translator,
and scholar of the history of Iranian theater. He achieved
fame with his Sttmad character, a "simple" country boy,
bedazzled by the glitz of the big city, and yet astutely
critical of the empty pretense of modernty. At the same
time, Sayyad had a sterling reputation amongst critics
for his many artistic endeavors in the field of theater.
