### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Kicking off the New Year with a healthy start, the Uni
versity has created a new three-step program that offers
financial incentives for staff and faculty aiming to stay on
the path to fitness. Launched on Jan. 3. the Be Well Hm
ployee Incentive Program is part of the larger initiative of
BeWell@Stanford.
Employees who complete the Stanford Health and
Lifestyle Assessment (SHALA) at http://bewell.stan
ford.edu receive a $150 taxable reward. Those who com
plete the survey arc invited to attend a free I lealth Im
provement Program (HIP) workshop to interpret the sur
vey results and create a wellness plan with a coach from
HIP. Participants who create a plan are eligible for a free
fitness assessment, two free personal training sessions and
"Healthy I living" classes offered for a reduced fee of $20.
Though only University employees are eligible for the
$150 incentive, free training sessions and fitness assess
ments. the entire campus community may take the sur
vey and attend an Interpretation Workshop.
According to Deborah Balfanz, project manager of
HIP. as of Monday evening — only eleven days into the
program — approximately 1.800 Stanford employees
had taken the SHALA. In addition.over 570 people have
registered for an Interpretation Workshop. A total of
5.6(H) members of the Stanford community are registered
on the Be Well Web site.
"We believe that as individuals become engaged in
the [program], they will begin to es
tablish internal values that support
healthy behaviors," said Wes Alles, di
rector of the Health Improvement
Program. "[HIP is a] visible demon
stration of the University's commit
ment to members of the Stanford
community to promote health, vitali
ty and quality of life."
"By managing just five factors —
smoking, physical activity, healthy
eating, stress and alcohol — we can
reduce the unnecessary illness and
the costs associated with them,"

Alles added.
Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Eric Stein and Jennifer Sexton,
Coordinator of Fitness and Wellness
Programs, said that in the coming
months, the program intends to con
tinue its marketing campaigns to in
crease participation.
"We continue to develop pro
gramming that we take to the users in
their dorms and/or workplace," Sex
ton said. "We have developed a net
work of BeWell Advocates that help
to share information with their col
leagues. We are also working with
Human Resources and doing presen
tations at New Employee Orienta
tion and work groups."
Launched in September, Be-
Well@Stanford is led by the Depart

ment of Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation, and receives support
from HIP, Provost John Etchemendy.
the Benefits Department and the ad
vocacy efforts of offices and staff
across campus.
"Stanford was one of the first uni
versities in the country to offer a
breadth of programs aimed at living
healthfully, and HIP has educated
and mentored universities, HMOs
and community health organizations
around the world," Alles said. "The
BeWell program takes the program
to another level, and we have already
begun to receive requests from other
employers about the incentives."
