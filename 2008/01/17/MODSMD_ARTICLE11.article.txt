## Showerheads spark ire Student Housing officials defend installation of low flow nozzles 
### NIKHIL JOSHI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Jonas Ketterle '08 began exper
imenting with low flow showerheads for
the Green Dorm Project last year, he
never would have guessed that his results
would culminate in the installation of
new showerheads across campus by Stu
dent Housing — and in the process
cause students to think of the new show
erheads with a hatred normally reserved
for Cal.
"We were able to break down where
the water [on campus] goes, and a lot of it
went to showers." Ketterle said, referring

to his work on
the Green
Dorm Project.
"It wasn't out
rageous, but it
was a significant
proportion."

Ketterle rec
ommended his
showerhead
model to Student
Housing, which
began testing it in
680 Lomita last
spring.

"We really
got a lot of feedback,
and really had no neg
ative feedback," Ket
terle said. "1 was sur
prised at how well the
showerhead worked, es
pecially with its flow
rate."

Christian Tom *09,
who is an editor at The Daily, does not
share Ketterle's sentiments. Tom circu
lated an email petition around West La
gunita. asking others frustrated with the
new shower heads to add their names to
the email, which was then forwarded to
the Lagunita housing front desk.
"All I asked was' Have you guys taken
a shower yet?' and people immediately
knew what I was talking about." Tom
said. "Within twenty hours, I had forty
two responses from westlag-chat."
Although administrators are willing
to listen to residents'complaints. Student
I lousing is puzzled at the harsh reaction
to the new showerheads.

" Part of the confusion is why they [the
showerheads] aren't being received the
same way they were during testing at 680
Lomita," Sustainability Coordinator Nik
Kaestner said. "A lot of thought went
into this decision, that is why we are dou
bly frustrated with the outcome."
"Student Housing is determined to
provide a homey' housing experience
for our students while promoting the re
sponsible use of precious resources

"We were not given
the opportunity to
give our input
about them."

wherever we can," added Chief Housing
Officer Rodger Whitney in an email to
The Daily.
The perceived lack of student in
volvement has been one of the major
reasons students are upset with the new
showerheads.
"I was disappointed that we were not
given advanced notice and the opportu

nity to give our input about them ." said
Sean Arenson '08. "There is a range of
low-flow showerhead products on the
market and it would have been nice if the
University had put out a lot more infor
mation about the enjoyment to sustain
ability ratio [of different products]."
But Kaestner vigorously denies lack
of student involvement.
"This project originated with a stu
dent's idea and, wherever possible, we
like to partner with students to imple
ment their forward-thinking ideas in the
context of Student Housing," he said.
In an effort to bring students into the
loop, officials from Housing visited sev
eral dorms last night to discuss the new
showerheads and address any concerns
residents may have.
But frustrated students who hope for
a return to the higher-pressure shower
heads might be out of luck.
"Pulling them all out is probably not
viable, considering the expense of in
stalling them," Kaestner said.
Housing defended its decision to in
stall the new showerheads on environ
mental grounds.
"The installation of 1,827 undergrad
uate showerheads will save 12 million
gallons each year, the daily water use of
120,000 average Americans." Kaestner
said.
Ketterle, in the end. was still proud of
his contribution.
"I love taking showers," he said."and
I wouldn't recommend a showerhead 1
wasn't happy with."
