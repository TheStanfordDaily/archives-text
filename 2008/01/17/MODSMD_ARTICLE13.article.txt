## Editorial Board Profession preferences: Entrepreneurs emerge 
### 
Recent trends indicate that more and
more college students are bypassing
careers in the traditional realms of
medicine and law in favor of less conven
tional but increasingly high-paying and
well-respected careers in management con
sulting.entrepreneurshipand Internet start
ups.
Applications to medical and law schools
have recently experienced significant de
clines. The Law School Admissions council
reported a 5.2 percent decrease in law
school applicants in 2005 and a 6.7 percent
drop in 2006. Medical schools have experi
enced similar declines since the late 19905,
although recent fall-offs have been less se
vere.
Even within the law and medical fields,
professionals are gravitating away from the
more conventional careers. According to a
Jan. 6 article in'lTie New York Times by Alex
Williams, firms are losing an average of 20
percent of their associates annually. Twenty
percent of those who stay will experience
depression during all or part of their career.
Sixty percent of doctors polled in 2006 said
they had considered giving up medicine be
cause of "low morale."
Medicine and law have always been char
acterized by long hours and tough exams.
The migration away from these jobs is not a
result of these stringent restrictions, howev
er. but is due to shifting attitudes about the
professions. A fat paycheck,financial securi
ty and hard-earned degrees are no longer
the only measures of a desirable job. Cre

ativity. innovation and risk-taking are be
coming more sought-after elements in the
high-profile job world.
Bill Gates was one of the first famous,
high-profile entrepreneurs to make his for
tune starting his own highly successful busi
ness. Others have followed in his footsteps.
Both Google and Yahoo! were founded by
imaginative and quirky students whose
companies are now some of the biggest and
most lucrative in the world. Salaries at these
Internet giants often soar above those of
doctors and lawyers.
While high salaries will always affect the
career decisions of top college graduates,
more and more students are searching for
careers that both pay well and are enjoy
able. Today's college graduates are less con
cerned with financial stability than their
predecessors and more concerned with ap
plying themselves to a career about which
they are passionate.
The American dream has always been
about working hard to achieve success. The
new dream, however, seems to be not as
much about logging the long hours as it is
about finding a career that offers excite
ment. room for creative thinking and spiri
tual completeness.

Alex Williams ' Jan. 6 article in The New York
Times, "The Falling-Down Professions." The
second editorial, which will examine these is
sues from a gender perspective, will he pub
