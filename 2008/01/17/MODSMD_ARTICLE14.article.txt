## Prop. 93 exposes need for deeper reform 
### 
California voters are generally divided
into two schools of thought on term
limits for their state legislators,some of
the most restrictive in the nation. Currently,a
politician is limited to six years in the assem
bly and eight years in the senate for a total of
14 years: Proposition 93 would change the
limit to 12 years total in either house.
The first school believes that — however
great the deficiencies of our state govern
ment — our problems will be made even
worse by kicking out all the experienced leg
islators and putting the state budget in the
hands of beginners. Because of term limits,
one-third of the representatives in the state
assembly are freshmen, and none has more
than six years of experience. While legislators
under pressure from term limits are con
stantly jockeying for position to run for other
offices.control is left in the hands of lobbyists
and unelected legislative aides — the only
experienced people in Sacramento. Accord
ing to this view, term limits are a barrier to
good government and should be relaxed or
eliminated.
The second view is that California's politi
cians are self-serving and venal, better at
finding new ways to keep themselves in
power and expand their perks than they are
at solving the state's problems. Once elected,
honest people become corrupted by whis
pering lobbyists and the thrill of power, and
arrogantly cease to care about those who se
lected them.There is ample evidence for this
view: consider the districts our legislators
gerrymandered for themselves — not onlv is

it harder to lose a legislative election in Cali
fornia than in any of the other 49 states, but
our politicians are also less likely to be voted
out than Soviet Party delegates at the height
of Stalinism.They have made themselves im
possible to remove. According to this view,
term limits are one of the few remaining
checks on the power of these problematic
politicians.
But there is no reason to choose. We can
have the best of both worlds — experienced
legislators who are also accountable to their
constituents. Thus the standard compromise
floated by good government advocates and
newspaper editorial boards: relax the term
limits and make the legislative districts fairer
at the same time.There is no reason to throw
everyone out. but it is equally problematic to
keep everyone in. Make the districts compet
itive and let the people choose.
For voters of either school of thought,
Feb. s's Proposition 93 is a step backward.To
those who want more experienced legislators
in Sacramento. Proposition 93 is a setback
because it reduces total term limits to 12

years, rather than the current 14. On
the other hand, those in the legisla
tors-are-self-serving-rascals camp
note that the bill is written with a spe
cial exception for our current legisla
tors, allowing termed-out Assembly
Speaker Fabian Nunez another six
years as speaker, and termed-out
Senate Majority Leader Don Perata
another four. Both are campaigning
hard to get their terms extended.
Whether you want harsher term lim
its because politicians are self-serv
ing, or more lenient term limits be
cause politicians are inexperienced,
there is something for every voter not

to like.
In reality, though. Proposition 93
will probably have some good effects
as well as the bad ones. Though it
would shorten term limits, it would
make them more flexible, reducing
the jockeying — perhaps giving
politicians a chance to spend some
time thinking about how to represent
their constituents. The flexibility will
mean less experienced state senators,
a downside, but more experienced
state assembly members, an upside.
Taken together, the state will ar
guably be incrementally better-gov
erned. But will voters be willing to
hold their noses and vote yes?
Though it is probably a marginal
step forward, this deeply flawed leg
islation speaks volumes about how
Sacramento is run. Think of it this
way: if this is the legislation you pro

duce, what are your priorities? The
legislators in Sacramento — know
ing that California has both the least
accountable and least experienced
legislators in the country — literally
said to themselves, "the problem we
need to solve is extending terms for
sitting legislators." That, not political
reform or real solutions, is what they
decided was worth putting on the bal
lot. Before, term limits were a trade
off between inexperience and unac
countability — these legislators fig
ured out a way to get more of them
both! It's a bill.sadly,that reflects leg
islators' own self interest much more
than it reflects the interests of the
voters.
Whether or not Proposition 93
passes, Californians should take a se
rious look at broader reform. Every
year there are promises to fix the ger

rymandered districts and every time
the legislative leadership finds an ex
cuse to stall. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's plan last year was
narrowly defeated, and soon after
ward the Democratic legislators' al
ternative was abandoned.
Hie time for excuses has passed.
Legislators should be both experi
enced and accountable. They should
not serve for life, and they should not
get kicked out automatically — the
people should decide based on each
legislator's record. That's how a
democracy works. Other states have
that — is it too much to ask for in
California?

Whether or not Proposition 93
passes, Californians should take a se
rious look at broader reform. Every
year there are promises to fix the ger

rymandered districts and every time
the legislative leadership finds an ex
cuse to stall. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's plan last year was
narrowly defeated, and soon after
ward the Democratic legislators' al
ternative was abandoned.
Hie time for excuses has passed.
Legislators should be both experi
enced and accountable. They should
not serve for life, and they should not
get kicked out automatically — the
people should decide based on each
legislator's record. That's how a
democracy works. Other states have
that — is it too much to ask for in
California?
