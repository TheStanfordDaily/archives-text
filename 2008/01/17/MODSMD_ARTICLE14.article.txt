## Prop. 93 exposes need for deeper reform 
### 
California voters are generally divided
into two schools of thought on term
limits for their state legislators,some of
the most restrictive in the nation. Currently,a
politician is limited to six years in the assem
bly and eight years in the senate for a total of
14 years: Proposition 93 would change the
limit to 12 years total in either house.
The first school believes that — however
great the deficiencies of our state govern
ment — our problems will be made even
worse by kicking out all the experienced leg
islators and putting the state budget in the
hands of beginners. Because of term limits,
one-third of the representatives in the state
assembly are freshmen, and none has more
than six years of experience. While legislators
under pressure from term limits are con
stantly jockeying for position to run for other
offices.control is left in the hands of lobbyists
and unelected legislative aides — the only
experienced people in Sacramento. Accord
ing to this view, term limits are a barrier to
good government and should be relaxed or
eliminated.
The second view is that California's politi
cians are self-serving and venal, better at
finding new ways to keep themselves in
power and expand their perks than they are
at solving the state's problems. Once elected,
honest people become corrupted by whis
pering lobbyists and the thrill of power, and
arrogantly cease to care about those who se
lected them.There is ample evidence for this
view: consider the districts our legislators
gerrymandered for themselves — not onlv is

it harder to lose a legislative election in Cali
fornia than in any of the other 49 states, but
our politicians are also less likely to be voted
out than Soviet Party delegates at the height
of Stalinism.They have made themselves im
possible to remove. According to this view,
term limits are one of the few remaining
checks on the power of these problematic
politicians.
But there is no reason to choose. We can
have the best of both worlds — experienced
legislators who are also accountable to their
constituents. Thus the standard compromise
floated by good government advocates and
newspaper editorial boards: relax the term
limits and make the legislative districts fairer
at the same time.There is no reason to throw
everyone out. but it is equally problematic to
keep everyone in. Make the districts compet
itive and let the people choose.
For voters of either school of thought,
Feb. s's Proposition 93 is a step backward.To
those who want more experienced legislators
in Sacramento. Proposition 93 is a setback
because it reduces total term limits to 12
