## Working for a non-profit does not necessarily make you a Better person 
### 
Attending numerous recruiting events
for different companies, I fiequently
see bright-eyed, fresh-faced youth
asking more about the non-profit work a
company engages in than the work the com
pany normally does. Are these kids just trying
to (unsuccessfully) curry favor with the re
cruiter. or are they legitimately concerned
about the ills of this world? Even if the latter
is true, and even if they ultimately end up es
chewing traditional corporate employment
for non-profit work, does that grant them
moral high ground over people simply con
cerned with stacking bills really, really high?
Not necessarily. Don't get me wrong. I'm
not against doing good deeds. On the con
trary. 1 think good deeds are the only things
that keep an already tainted world from col
lapsing into chaos altogether. 1 wouldn't be
here today if a kind soul hadn't risked his life
to save my grandmother from certain death in
Nazi Germany. I'm not too particular on the
exact reasons for why a good deed is per
formed, either — if you help out at an elderly
home to score points with an attractive volun
teer, at least some elderly people are better
off,
My concern lies mainly with joining a non
profit directly out of undergraduate for the
wrong reasons, and condemning other forms

of employment as lesser in moral standing.
Working at a non-profit doesn't necessarily
equate to producing good deeds.
First, however. 1 want to declare that I am
by no means against non-profits — there are
a lot of non-profits out there that are doing
great work. But. if your reason for joining a
non-profit is to better the world, there are still
a few things to consider. So I want to propose
some guidelines for choosing the non-profit
route at the onset of your career. One is that a
lot of organizations need money, not neces
sarily people, which means that the organiza
tion may not be able to fully utilize your tal
ents. Also, there can be a lot of stratification in
the effectiveness of different organizations.
Make sure to pick one that makes real
changes if that's your concern.
Additionally, working for a non-profit is
not always more enjoyable than working at a
for-profit corporation. Pay is low. non-profits

can be chaotically and frustratingly managed
(perhaps more so than for-profits due to less
severe market pressures), and at the end of
the day, a job is a job is a job. You'll have to put
up with the same bureaucracy and unpleasant
tasks as you would in any other place. And
perhaps most importantly, and why I warn
against non-profit entry-level positions, you
may not have any pull in instituting change on
the issues you care about. Of course, this hap
pens in all jobs, but if it stifles the passion for
change that led you to take the job in the first
place, you will be left a sad. broken shell of
your former self.
So do you just sell your soul then and join
a for-profit mega-corporation? While capital
ism may have its problems, it is not the em
bodiment of evil. Right now it's the only —
and probably the best — thing we've got.
There's no way to duck out of its grasp, even
for non-profits. Unless a company is doing
something really dubious, for the most part
companies help society progress. Being an in
vestment banker doesn't by default make you
evil; it's just a way of life. Besides, in this world
the bar ol morality is set so low that just being
a generally agreeable, law-abiding citizen is
enough to make you a good person.


Shafir
Also, there are a lot of jobs in the
for-profit sector which are doing
great work but receive little recogni
tion. like nursing or janitorial work.
Plus working at a for-profit can give
you experience, money and power,
which can translate into greater in
fluence to effect change in a non
profit. Then you can really have your
way!

If you truly desire to work at a
non-profit, and feel you have good
reasons, then by all means do so —
they can be very rewarding positions.
Just remember to also consider the
for-profit sector, where you can per
form some good deeds for your wal
let, your parents' anxiety over your
wallet, the approval of your capital
ist-loving columnist, and perhaps the
ability to make a bigger and better
change in the world later on.
