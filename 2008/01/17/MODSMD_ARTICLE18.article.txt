## The
						2008 Caltrain No Pass 
### 
Last December 30, I took a late-night
Caltrain home from Stanford as usual.
As the conductor made her way down
the aisle she glanced at my Go Pass and re
marked that I would have to get a new pass
for the New Year. Sadly. I informed her that
Stanford had a&ain declined to fund the
Go Pass program for graduate students. She
rolled her eyes and exclaimed. "They're tak
ing it away from you again?!" Her reaction
summed up my feelings at being forced to
commute by either car or bus for the second
time in two and a half years as a Ph.D. student
at Stanford.
When I began looking for housing on the
peninsula in 2CK)S the Go Pass made Caltrain
seem like the perfect way to commute, so I
was delighted to find an apartment in San

Mateo that offered significantly better value
than anything I saw in Palo Alto. One of its
main attractions was its location approxi
mately 100 feet from the Caltrain tracks. Due
to the proximity to the Hayward Park Cal
train station, my commute averaged 45 min
utes. I could read and work during the com
mute and also limit my carbon footprint. As 1
study the adverse effects of climate change
on butterfly populations, it is important to me
that I not contribute to the problem I study
by driving to work every day!
As the Baby Bullet trains rumble by my
apartment every morning, what once was a
point of pride and a quirky, reassuring fea
ture of my home has become an irritating
daily reminder of Stanford's failure to offer
an essential service. When the Go Pass was

suspended two years ago, I was forced to take
the bus— I hail no car and paying for Cal
train was simply too cost prohibitive. My
commute time more than doubled to an hour
and 40 minutes. Spending more than three
hours a day commuting really cut down on
my extracurricular activities, like sleep.
I now have a car — a hand-me-down 1995
Honda Passport that gets 20 miles to the gal
lon on a good day. Of course, my ailing car
needs a smog check right now (among other
things), so I'm currently enjoying the
"leisurely" bus ride up and down HI Camino
on the 390 and missing the days of zipping by
my apartment on the train and congratulat
ing myself on such a great location.
