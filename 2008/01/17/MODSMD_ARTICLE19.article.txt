In yesterday's editorial [Chelsea
lacks class at exclusive event], the
Editorial Board stated that Chelsea
Clinton's appearance at Pi Beta Phi
on Sunday was "sponsored by the
sorority system." In fact, the Jan. 13
event occurred at an Inter-Sorority
Council (ISC) member house but
was neither sponsored nor planned
bv the ISC.
