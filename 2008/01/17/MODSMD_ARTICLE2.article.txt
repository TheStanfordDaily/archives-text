# CATS CALL
## New-look Arizona squad set to pay a visit to the Farm tonight 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The swagger, the trademark red and
blue jerseys and the winning style are all
the same. But the usual suspects, includ
ing a Hall of Fame coach and a "Stanford
killer" have long since ridden off into the
desert sunset.
Tonight, the Stanford men's basketball
team faces an Arizona team in transition.
A perennial Pac-10 powerhouse, the
Wildcats (11-5, 1-2 Pac-10) have been a
mixed bag this season — injuries to key
players and a temporary coaching change
that came out of the blue have thrown a
wrench into the mix for the traditionally
dominant program.
But while coach Lute Olson's leave of
absence for personal reasons has changed
expectations, interim head coach Kevin
O'Neill — groomed to be Olsen's even
tual permanent successor — has Arizona
employing a new defensive philosophy.
With freshman point guard Jerrvd Bay
less back after missing four games with a
right knee injury, the Wildcats are danger
ous and on the rise.
ITiis weekend's home stand against
Arizona and Arizona State is especially
crucial for the Cardinal (13-3,2-2). After
splitting last weekend's road series
against the Oregon schools, Stanford
must hold its own at Maples to remain
afloat in a cutthroat Pac-10 conference.
"It's huge," junior guard Mitch John
son said. "In a conference that's this good,
your home games are definitely the ones
you have to take advantage of. Because
sometimes, going on the road and getting
splits is a good thing."
Stanford forward Taj Finger is acutely
aware of his team's history against Ari
zona. A senior, he's seen for himself how
tough the Wildcats can be — Arizona has
won six in a row against the Cardinal and
seven of the last ten.

Stanford has not beaten the Wildcats
since a victory at Maples Pavilion in Jan
uary 2005, Finger's freshman season and
Trent Johnson's first year as head coach.
"1 haven't beat Arizona for a while
now, so it would be really nice to get a win
against them." Finger said. "This is a huge
weekend for us, especially at home, and
we definitely have to get both of these to
stay competitive now."
For the Cardinal, it will help that "Stan
ford killer" Ivan Radenovic graduated
last

NOTES! The Cardinal will be gunning for
their first victory over Arizona since 2005
after suffering a disappointing loss in their
most recent effort on the court, a 71 -66
heartbreaker against Oregon on the
road. The Wildcats have lost three of their
last five games overall, but as a six game
win streak in December showed, can nev
ertheless be dangerous. For the Cardinal
to be successful in the desert, it may need
more scorers to step up and help out
Brook Lopez, who leads the team with a
16.7 points per game average.

season. The big man from Serbia
seemed to have a good game against Stan
ford — especially in last year's 85-80
overtime victory at Maples. Radenovic
scored a career high 39 points, while
adding nine rebounds and a career-high
seven assists in the Wildcats' win. i

and the Card need a home
sweep this weekend to stay
alive in a contentious Pac-10.
"We're glad that he's not around
anymore," Finger said, "That would
have been a nice game to win. We
just couldn't pull it off, and didn't
have enough in the gas tanks there."
Stanford is coming off of a
wrenching 71-66 loss at Oregon in
which poor three-point and foul
shooting doomed the Cardinal.Tied
at 63 with two minutes to go. an of
fensive meltdown cost Stanford a
chance to eke out a victory on an al
ways-contentious road stage in F.u
gene. Ore.
"Our execution was good until
the last minute or so,"Trent Johnson
said. "Are we in that situation if we
make a couple more free throws and
make a couple more open shots?"
Stanford enters the weekend as
the favorite, but not by much. The
Wildcats may have lost three of
their last five games, but Johnson
knows they will be tough to beat.
They always are.
" ITiey have three or four future
NBA guys." Johnson said. "They
look the same as always.They've al
ways caused us [problems with]
quickness in the perimeter and the
post."
Bayless returned from his injury
on Saturday and helped spur Ari
zona to an 85-71 win at Houston
with 33 points and nine assists. The
freshman leads his team with 1c).7l c ).7
points and 4.6 assists per game, and
is considered one of the top young
point guards in the nation.

"He's good." Mitch Johnson said.
"I don't think there's probably any
thing you're going to do to take away
or take him out of the game. Hope
fully whoever gets that job [on de
fense] will just make it tough on him.
I think we've done a pretty good job
this year playing team defense and
we'll definitely need to do that."
Along with Bayless, the Wildcats
boast athletic swingman Chase
Budinger. a former volleyball star
who returned to Arizona for his
sophomore year despite speculation
among NBA scouts that he could be
a top pick in last year's draft. Known
more for its strong guard play, only
one big man. Jordan Hill, gets major
minutes in the Arizona rotation. But
the sophomore forward has im
proved his game by leaps and
bounds this season.
"He has all the tools." Johnson
said of 11 ill. "live body, strong, quick
on his feet, laterally he's quick. He's
probably one of the most improved
players in our league, in the country."
For Stanford, the keys will be to
exploit the size advantage down low.
Sophomore center Brook Lopez,
fresh off a season high-26 points in
Sunday's loss, will again be relied on
to score in the paint.
"It's going to be a tough game,"
said Finger, adding that his team is
motivated but not too worried
about where it stands. "It's early on
in the Pac-10 season. We're fine, and
just trying to get better right now."
If history has anything to say
about facing Arizona, the sooner the
better.
