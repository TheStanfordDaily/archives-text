# CATS CALL
## New-look Arizona squad set to pay a visit to the Farm tonight 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The swagger, the trademark red and
blue jerseys and the winning style are all
the same. But the usual suspects, includ
ing a Hall of Fame coach and a "Stanford
killer" have long since ridden off into the
desert sunset.
Tonight, the Stanford men's basketball
team faces an Arizona team in transition.
A perennial Pac-10 powerhouse, the
Wildcats (11-5, 1-2 Pac-10) have been a
mixed bag this season — injuries to key
players and a temporary coaching change
that came out of the blue have thrown a
wrench into the mix for the traditionally
dominant program.
But while coach Lute Olson's leave of
absence for personal reasons has changed
expectations, interim head coach Kevin
O'Neill — groomed to be Olsen's even
tual permanent successor — has Arizona
employing a new defensive philosophy.
With freshman point guard Jerrvd Bay
less back after missing four games with a
right knee injury, the Wildcats are danger
ous and on the rise.
ITiis weekend's home stand against
Arizona and Arizona State is especially
crucial for the Cardinal (13-3,2-2). After
splitting last weekend's road series
against the Oregon schools, Stanford
must hold its own at Maples to remain
afloat in a cutthroat Pac-10 conference.
"It's huge," junior guard Mitch John
son said. "In a conference that's this good,
your home games are definitely the ones
you have to take advantage of. Because
sometimes, going on the road and getting
splits is a good thing."
Stanford forward Taj Finger is acutely
aware of his team's history against Ari
zona. A senior, he's seen for himself how
tough the Wildcats can be — Arizona has
won six in a row against the Cardinal and
seven of the last ten.

Stanford has not beaten the Wildcats
since a victory at Maples Pavilion in Jan
uary 2005, Finger's freshman season and
Trent Johnson's first year as head coach.
"1 haven't beat Arizona for a while
now, so it would be really nice to get a win
against them." Finger said. "This is a huge
weekend for us, especially at home, and
we definitely have to get both of these to
stay competitive now."
For the Cardinal, it will help that "Stan
ford killer" Ivan Radenovic graduated
last

NOTES! The Cardinal will be gunning for
their first victory over Arizona since 2005
after suffering a disappointing loss in their
most recent effort on the court, a 71 -66
heartbreaker against Oregon on the
road. The Wildcats have lost three of their
last five games overall, but as a six game
win streak in December showed, can nev
ertheless be dangerous. For the Cardinal
to be successful in the desert, it may need
more scorers to step up and help out
Brook Lopez, who leads the team with a
16.7 points per game average.

seemed to have a good game against Stan
ford — especially in last year's 85-80
overtime victory at Maples. Radenovic
scored a career high 39 points, while
adding nine rebounds and a career-high
seven assists in the Wildcats' win. i
