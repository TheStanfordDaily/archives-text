Clinton volunteer clarifies
Chelsea's visit
To the Editor:
As a Stanford student and a
Hillary Clinton supporter I feel it is
necessary to clarify some of the de
tails of Chelsea Clinton's visit to her
alma mater and. in doing so, I hope
we can put an end to the ridiculous
notion that the event was crafted as
some sort of exclusive campaign
event. As a volunteer for the Clinton
campaign, 1 received notice six hours
before the visit: Chelsea would be
stopping by campus. She was excited
to be back at Stanford and expressed
an interest in speaking to some unde
cided voters in hopes of answering
questions about her mom's cam
paign. This is exactly what happened.
The event was not sponsored by the
Inter-Sorority Council,and it was not
organized by Pi Phi.
The round table discussion in Old
Union, which was attended by 16 un
decided voters and five Clinton sup
porters, was an opportunity for
Chelsea to connect with Stanford stu
dents and answer their questions on
everything from Health Care to Iraq
to Stanford's reputation for political
apathy. The event was publicized by
word of mouth, given our limited
space and time.

The brief stop at Pi Phi was anoth
er attempt to reach out to students
who were largely undecided.The par
ticipants were not told in advance
who would he speaking (only that
there would be a special guest), there
was no one "letting people in or out."
and the room was filled to the brim
with a majority of undecided voters
(by a show of hands). As the first seri
ous female candidate for president, it
should come as no surprise to Stan
ford students that Sen. Clinton seeks
to reach out to young women voters.
ITiat said. Chelsea, does not in any
way value sorority women over any
other voters.
Obviously, as Stanford students,
we hope to have access to all the spe
cial guests who arrive on our campus.
But, given the short amount of time
Chelsea was in town, and the legal re
strictions of politics on our campus,
my fellow Clinton volunteers and 1
did what we thought would be best.
In my opinion, it would have been
disappointing to not have any stu
dents meet with Chelsea, because it
was a really unique opportunity to
discuss presidential politics with
someone who is experiencing it first
hand and that someone is one of our
own.
