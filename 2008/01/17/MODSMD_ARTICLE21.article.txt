## MEASURING UP Senior Matt Ceran thrives on and off the court for the Card 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The previous three summers senior Matt
Ceran had gone home to his native Los Angeles
and worked at a beach volleyball camp, hoping to
both help young players sharpen their game and
maintain his own.
But last summer, he decided to do something
a little different. Ceran stayed in Palo Alto to pur
sue a different interest in the biggest off-court
arena on the planet — the Earth itself.
"There is so much going on the world that
needs to be addressed," Ceran said. "1 have al
ways wanted to do something that provides a tan
gible benefit to humanity. And the environment,
it's so important to conserve [...] because it has
such an impact on human health, poverty and
general prosp<3tity."
Ceran commuted to San Francisco daily as an
intern at an eco-friendly plastic recycling compa
ny. He helped develop tools that measured the
volume of input plastic compared to output plas
tic in different parts of the recycling process in
order to assess the levels of efficiency of those
parts. 1 le communicated and worked closely with
the Chief Executive Officer to incorporate im
provements.
After work he would concentrate on volley
ball. Three days a week, he met with a trainer to
lift weights and work out for an hour. One day a
week he played in a local volleyball night league,
alongside a hodgepodge mix of Stanford alumni,
Silicon Valley businessmen, and local high
schoolers.
But how did it all begin? The story of the envi
ronmentalist by day, athlete by night has its roots
in West Los Angeles, one of the most culturally
and socially diverse areas in the country. When he
was five, his parents adopted his younger sister,
Emily,as an infant from South Korea. Despite the
difference in age and gender. Matt and Emily
were, and still are, "best friends." He is quick to
brag about her at length.
"She's a great soccer player — she was one of
the few freshmen on varsity and the only fresh
man to make it to first-team all league," he
glowed. "She also excels academically and is real
ly dedicated to community service. I'm really
proud of her."
Growing up. Matt was quite the Renaissance
man. He played piano until he was about 12 and
played Little League baseball until he was 12 as
well. As a pitcher, Ceran led his league in strike
outs two years in a row. He played travel soccer
and football in middle school, but not for long as,
in his own words, he "was not very good at it."
In eighth grade, a friend named Danny intro
duced him to volleyball. The two practiced daily
in Danny's narrow hallway, making dents in the
wall and knocking over picture frames. "Danny's
mom was cool with it. though, because we were
getting better. She took a hit for us ... the hall
way was never the same after that," he laughed.
Ceran eventually outgrew his friend's hallway
and started playing competitive club volleyball.
His club, the Southern California Volleyball
Club, went to the national championships — the
Junior Olympics — three times during his time
there. When he was 16. they went undefeated on
the season, only to suffer their first and last loss in
nationals. When he was 17 and again when he was
IS. his club went to nationals and won.
After Junior Olympics his junior year, Ceran
began hearing from college coaches. To his ex
citement. many offered him official visits to their

schools. And it was this path that eventually led
him to Stanford.
"The academics, especially the student servic
es, are amazing. The people in the Earth Systems
— my major — Department, Deana and Emily,
among others, definitely deserve recognition:

they sit with me for hours helping me pick and
schedule courses, they give me advice; they're
very supportive of my volleyball career, and as
busy as they are, they even make it to many of my

games."
And the Stanford staff is far from
the only strand of Matt's support
system. His parents supported his
passion for volleyball as soon as he
started playing, though both worked
full time — his father as a lawyer in
Downtown L.A., and his mother as a
public school psychologist in Santa
Monica. Despite their busy sched
ules, one of his parents always man
aged to make it to his club games,
whether they were in the South Bay,
Long Beach or Orange County.
Back at school Ceran credits his
coaches — John Kosty (head
coach). Ken Shibuya (assistant
coach) and A 1 Roderigues (assis
tant coach) — for helping him de
velop both as a person and as a play
er. His teammates are always there
for him, both in good times and in
bad. His girlfriend of one year never
misses a game.

And though he seems hesitant to
talk about it. Matt has achieved
quite a bit on his own as well. Last
year as an outside hitter he led the
team in blocks and block assists.
This year, in the same position, he
leads the team in kills per game, his
best so far 22 against Alberta. Two
weeks ago he was named Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Co-Player of the Week, and just last
week he was Stanford's Muscle
Milk Student-Athlete of the Week.
As the team's only true senior, he
has led the Cardinal to its best start
in six years.
At six-foot-six, often sporting

going to or from the gym. Matt
Ceran looks like a volleyball player.
But with such a modest, natural
charm and genuinely friendly dis
position. you probably wouldn't
guess that he is one of the best play
ers in the MPSF. And he would be
the last person in the world to tell
vou that.
