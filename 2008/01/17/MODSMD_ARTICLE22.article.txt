# Women sustain their dominant pace
## No. 7 Cardinal basketball on track for another big year

The measure of a great college
program is how its team performs
on a year-to-year basis. Despite a
high turnover rate — players con
stantly graduating and matriculat
ing — and the varying difficulty of
the opponents faced, a team has to
remain consistent if its wants to be
considered at the top.
Over the past five seasons, Stan
ford women's basketball has done
what it takes to perform at the high
est level. A look at the stat sheet
shows that the Cardinal has barely
wavered over the past five years, as
it has registered remarkably similar
totals in everything from scoring av
erages to assist-to-turnover ratio,
even though the team's personnel
has changed drastically over that
span.
The Cardinal's shooting percent
age has fluctuated a bit, but within a
relatively narrow margin. Stanford's

lowest mark during the span came in
the 2003-2004 season, when the
team shot .442 from the field: the
highest was the next year, when it
shot .482. A good individual per
centage for a guard is 45 percent,
while a good post player will score at
a 50 percent clip. A 46 percent rate
for a team, then, is very good. The
Cardinal averaged about 75 points
per game over this span.
The Cardinal women have not
just been efficient scorers, but have
held their opponents in check as
well. In the past five years, their foes,
combined, have not broken the 38
percent shooting mark — most
have been in the mediocre, if not
below-average, 36-37 percent range.
As a result, Stanford's opponents
only score about 58 points per con
test.
The Cardinal's dominance also
extends to rebounding. Essentially,
if you control the boards, you con
trol the ball, which means you con
trol the game. This year, the Cardi
nal have averaged nine more re
bounds than their opponents per
game, a mark that is nothing short of
