# Women sustain their dominant pace
## No. 7 Cardinal basketball on track for another big year 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The measure of a great college
program is how its team performs
on a year-to-year basis. Despite a
high turnover rate — players con
stantly graduating and matriculat
ing — and the varying difficulty of
the opponents faced, a team has to
remain consistent if its wants to be
considered at the top.
Over the past five seasons, Stan
ford women's basketball has done
what it takes to perform at the high
est level. A look at the stat sheet
shows that the Cardinal has barely
wavered over the past five years, as
it has registered remarkably similar
totals in everything from scoring av
erages to assist-to-turnover ratio,
even though the team's personnel
has changed drastically over that
span.
The Cardinal's shooting percent
age has fluctuated a bit, but within a
relatively narrow margin. Stanford's

lowest mark during the span came in
the 2003-2004 season, when the
team shot .442 from the field: the
highest was the next year, when it
shot .482. A good individual per
centage for a guard is 45 percent,
while a good post player will score at
a 50 percent clip. A 46 percent rate
for a team, then, is very good. The
Cardinal averaged about 75 points
per game over this span.
The Cardinal women have not
just been efficient scorers, but have
held their opponents in check as
well. In the past five years, their foes,
combined, have not broken the 38
percent shooting mark — most
have been in the mediocre, if not
below-average, 36-37 percent range.
As a result, Stanford's opponents
only score about 58 points per con
test.
The Cardinal's dominance also
extends to rebounding. Essentially,
if you control the boards, you con
trol the ball, which means you con
trol the game. This year, the Cardi
nal have averaged nine more re
bounds than their opponents per
game, a mark that is nothing short of
phenomenal, even an aberration, for
a talented program like Stanford. In
all likelihood, the difference will de
crease as the season progresses. In the
prior four seasons, though, the Cardi
nal out-rebounded its opponents by
about five boards per game, which
equates to roughly 200 more re
bounds per year for Stanford.

But the most consistent statistic
has been the assist-to-turnover ratio,
which measures how careful and ef
fective a team is with the ball once
they have possession of it. Obviously,
a 1 in this category means that you
turned the ball over and assisted bas
kets at the same rate: anything above
1 is good, anything below is bad.
The Cardinal have consistently
registered about a 1.2 on this scale,
which is actually relatively good con
sidering that post players — who the
Cardinal have relied upon now and in
the past — have many more opportu

nities to turn the ball over than they
do to get an assist. Meanwhile, they've
held their opponents to about a 0.7,
which is fairly poor.
Stanford has dominated on both
the offensive and defensive side of
the ball for years. But where has it led
them? From the 20Q3-2004 through
2006-2007 seasons, the Cardinal
reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA
Tournament three times, and were
upset in the second round once. Bar
ring a massive and epic collapse this
year, the Cardinal will be a March
Madness participant again in 2(X)8.

and a high seed to boot.
So far this year, Stanford has been
consistent with its past performanc
es, if not a bit better statistically. Hut
it could once again all go for naught
unless the Stanford women can final
ly produce better results in March.
Since they've been following their
past trends thus far. though, a top fin
ish in the tournament should certain
ly be achievable, if not expected.
That is. if vou believe the numbers.
