# Cardinal ruggers growing quickly
## Stanford men's rugby on the rise as membership hits all-time high 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you recall last week's feature about
Stanford's ice hockey team, you will re
member that hockey's overall lack of popu
larity on the West Coast has made it very
difficult for the club to challenge for titles.
So with that in mind, you would probably
assume that Stanford's club rugby team
would be in an even more precarious posi
tion. After all. Rugby makes hockey look
like America's pastime, and you need at the
very least 22 players to field a team (15 on
the pitch and seven on the subs bench).
However, rugby is flourishing here on
the Farm and on college campuses across
the country. In fact, our women's team fin
ished second in the nation last year, while
the men are fielding a very strong and expe
rienced squad this year, with membership at
an all-time high. Last week, the men came
back from 15-0 to defeat Nevada 36-20 in
their first league game of 200 H.

So the question remains: where did all of
these rugby players come from? Surely they
can't all be international students from New
Zealand and Australia, right?
As it turns out. a majority of the players
on the men's team had never played rugby
before coming to Stanford.
High school rugby is slowly growing in
the United States, but many students still do
not have opportunities to play. However,
according to senior forward lan Abernathy.
most of the players on the team played
some sort of sport in high school.
"On our team, in addition to ex-varsity
[high school] football players, we have an
ex-varsity baseball player, a couple ex-var
sity wrestlers and a slew of ex-high school
athletes who participated in sports ranging
from basketball, to soccer, to tennis, to
cross-country, to swimming," said Aber
nathy. himself a former high school football
player. "We look for athletes, plain and sim
ple."
Perhaps the reason that athletes of vari
ous sporting backgrounds can adapt to
rugby is that the sport requires such a
unique combination of skills. Players need

to be able to pass and kick the ball,
get past defenders, tackle and exe
cute well-timed runs. Some positions
emphasize certain skill sets more
than others, but it helps to be able to
do a bit of everything. The ability to
react quickly is also necessary, due to
the fast-paced and free-flowing na
ture of the sport.
While the above description may
give the impression that you need to
be some sort of über-athlete to play
rugby.club president and senior back
John Clark sees it differently.
"There is a spot for any Stanford
student on the rugby field and in the
rugby club,"he said. "From small to
big. from short to tall, anyone can fit
at one of the fifteen positions."
Clark also notes that the club can
fit almost anyone's commitment
level, with what he calls their "one
club, many teams" structure. The
three squads that make up the club
are the Ist XV.the 2nd XV.and the
Development or Rookie squad.
Players can also be involved in the
administrative aspects of the club,
since rugby is a club sport. It is prob
ably this increased involvement in
the team, along with the camaraderie
among players, that has created the
club's extremely active alumni net
work — which in turn has led to an
endowment of almost $2 million,
used to fund coaches salaries, trans
portation and other expenses.
Speaking of coaches, the experi
ence of the rugby team's staff has
helped the squad immensely. Direc
tor of coaching, Jonathan Griffin,
played professionally in England,
forwards coach Josh Sutcliffe played
for the Philippines national team and
backs coach Chris O'Brien is the
third highest all-time point scorer for
the US Eagles national team. And

despite the team's record number of
players, the Stanford ruggers are still
open to new recruits.
Overall, it is clear that even in its
101st year, the men's club rugby team
is as strong as ever.This weekend, the
team looks to knock off national
champion Cal in Berkeley. !Tie Car
dinal then has home games the two

Key matches
against Cal,
Sacramento State
looming large for
Cardinal

following weekends against Sacra
mento State and St. Mary's.
"It's simply an amazing sport,and
I 'd encourage anyone who's even re
motely interested to come out to
practice at the pitch any Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday at 4:00." Aber
nathy said.
Clark echoed those sentiments,
saying. "Anyone who steps on the
rugby pitch will soon fall in love with
the game, and the 80 minutes of fast
paced, hard-hitting action make it an
exciting sport to watch. Anyone at
Stanford is welcome to join the Stan
ford Rugby community of players
and fans. We look forward to seeing
you at the pitch!"
