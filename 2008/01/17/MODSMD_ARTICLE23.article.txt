## Stanford men's rugby on the rise as membership hits all-time high 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you recall last week's feature about
Stanford's ice hockey team, you will re
member that hockey's overall lack of popu
larity on the West Coast has made it very
difficult for the club to challenge for titles.
So with that in mind, you would probably
assume that Stanford's club rugby team
would be in an even more precarious posi

like America's pastime, and you need at the
very least 22 players to field a team (15 on
the pitch and seven on the subs bench).
However, rugby is flourishing here on
the Farm and on college campuses across
the country. In fact, our women's team fin

an all-time high. Last week, the men came
back from 15-0 to defeat Nevada 36-20 in
their first league game of 200 H.

So the question remains: where did all of
these rugby players come from? Surely they
can't all be international students from New
Zealand and Australia, right?
As it turns out. a majority of the players
on the men's team had never played rugby
before coming to Stanford.

not have opportunities to play. However,

some sort of sport in high school.
"On our team, in addition to ex-varsity
[high school] football players, we have an
ex-varsity baseball player, a couple ex-var
sity wrestlers and a slew of ex-high school
athletes who participated in sports ranging
from basketball, to soccer, to tennis, to
cross-country, to swimming," said Aber
nathy. himself a former high school football
player. "We look for athletes, plain and sim
ple."
Perhaps the reason that athletes of vari

rugby is that the sport requires such a
unique combination of skills. Players need
