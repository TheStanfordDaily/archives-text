# Cardinal set for desert swing
## No. 7 Stanford women headed south to face Arizona, ASU 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
After demolishing the Oregon schools
by a combined 70 points last week, Stan
ford women's basketball takes to the road
for meetings with Arizona and Arizona
State this weekend.
The No. 7 Cardinal (14-3. 4-2 Pac-10)
first battles Arizona tonight at 6 p.m.,
though the game will likely be a one-sided
affair. The Wildcats (6-10,0-5) are tied for
last in the conference.The closest Arizona
has come to a victory was in a double-over
time loss to Oregon State — when only
two Wildcat players remained on the floor
at the end of the game.
Sophomore guard J.J. Hones believes
that the Arizona's ability to stay close in
that contest showed the tenacity Stanford
can expect from their opponents in Tucson
this weekend.
"Arizona has a really good team; they're
really scrappy," she said."[After their game
with) Oregon State, we know that no mat
ter what happens they're going to keep
fighting. We need to make sure that we
come out and play [as well as] we can."
For the Cardinal, that means getting out

NOTES: The no. 7 Stanford women will bring a
notably dominant two game winning streak
with them to the Arizona desert tomorrow, after
defeating Oregon and Oregon State at home
last week by an average of over 30 points. Per
haps galvanized by their pair of losses suffered
in Los Angeles the week prior against USC and
UCLA, the Cardinal absolutely smashed the
Beavers and Ducks, with big games coming
from Jayne Appel, Candice Wiggins, and Jil
lian Harmon among others. Stanford has won
nine straight meetings with the Wildcats and 11
of their last 12.
