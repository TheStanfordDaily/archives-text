# Cardinal set for desert swing
## No. 7 Stanford women headed south to face Arizona, ASU 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
After demolishing the Oregon schools
by a combined 70 points last week, Stan
ford women's basketball takes to the road
for meetings with Arizona and Arizona
State this weekend.
The No. 7 Cardinal (14-3. 4-2 Pac-10)
first battles Arizona tonight at 6 p.m.,
though the game will likely be a one-sided
affair. The Wildcats (6-10,0-5) are tied for
last in the conference.The closest Arizona
has come to a victory was in a double-over
time loss to Oregon State — when only
two Wildcat players remained on the floor
at the end of the game.
Sophomore guard J.J. Hones believes
that the Arizona's ability to stay close in
that contest showed the tenacity Stanford
can expect from their opponents in Tucson
this weekend.
"Arizona has a really good team; they're
really scrappy," she said."[After their game
with) Oregon State, we know that no mat
ter what happens they're going to keep
fighting. We need to make sure that we
come out and play [as well as] we can."
For the Cardinal, that means getting out

NOTES: The no. 7 Stanford women will bring a
notably dominant two game winning streak
with them to the Arizona desert tomorrow, after
defeating Oregon and Oregon State at home
last week by an average of over 30 points. Per
haps galvanized by their pair of losses suffered
in Los Angeles the week prior against USC and
UCLA, the Cardinal absolutely smashed the
Beavers and Ducks, with big games coming
from Jayne Appel, Candice Wiggins, and Jil
lian Harmon among others. Stanford has won
nine straight meetings with the Wildcats and 11
of their last 12.

to an early lead and then maintain
ing it with solid defense. This sea
son Arizona has struggled to
bounce back after falling behind,
going 3-9 in games in which they
trailed at halftime.
"In every game it's important
for us to get out to a quick start,"
Hones said. "But teams can always
come back, so we just have to play
hard the whole time."
Stanford's ability to control the
game's opening minutes may also
give coach Tara VanDerveer the
opportunity to rest players like
sophomore center Jayne Appel
(15.6 ppg, 8.3 rebounds per game)
and senior guard Candice Wiggins
(17.5 ppg), allowing for a little
extra recovery before the Cardinal
meets fellow Pac-10 power No. 25
Arizona State on Sunday.
Appel said the decision about
who will stay on the floor will not
be made until after the first few
minutes of play.
"I think however we come out
will set the tone for the rest of the
game,"she added."But we'd like to
get everyone out and play."
Allowing more minutes from
the bench would also expose Stan
ford's players to the strong inside
out combination that the Wildcats
boast: senior guard Ashley Whiso
nant and junior forward Amina
Njonkou. In Arizona's 75-65 loss to
Arizona State last week, Whiso
nant (16.1 ppg, 4.56 assists per
game) added 20 points to Njonk
ou's career-high 25, as the pair to
gether produced nearly 70 percent

of the Wildcats' offense.
Njonkou, who averages 13.2
ppg and 7.2 rebounds per game,
will force the Cardinal's forwards
to play tougher defense than they
did against Oregon and Oregon
State. But /y>pel said the bigs are
ready.
"Defense will really have to be a
bigger focus against Arizona and
Arizona State," she said. "But this
year we've faced some great posts
already with Rutgers and Ten
nessee. It won't be a big adjustment
for us [playing against Njonkou],
but it'll definitely be something we
focus on."
Likewise, the backcourt will
look to silence Whisonant and
freshman guard Tasha Dickey (7.3
ppg). Hones, though, is confident
that the team is "really prepared"
for the duo. Additionally, Stanford
will be able to play aggressively
against the Wildcats in an effort to
force Arizona to shoot free throws.
The 'Cats are shooting only 64 per
cent from the charity stripe on the
season.
Regardless of the contest's
seeming lopsidedness. Appel says
Stanford will use this game as a
learning opportunity and another
stride toward Pac-10 success.
"1 think the Arizona road trip
has really been taken seriously in
recent years because of the caliber
of teams," Appel said. "So. 1 think
that we'll come out with that same
attitude: they're just one more step
in getting to where we want to be.
[The Arizona game] will really set
our momentum for how we'll be
playing in the next couple of
games."

ppg and 7.2 rebounds per game,
will force the Cardinal's forwards
to play tougher defense than they
did against Oregon and Oregon
State. But /y>pel said the bigs are
ready.
"Defense will really have to be a
bigger focus against Arizona and
Arizona State," she said. "But this
year we've faced some great posts
already with Rutgers and Ten
nessee. It won't be a big adjustment
for us [playing against Njonkou],
but it'll definitely be something we
focus on."
Likewise, the backcourt will
look to silence Whisonant and
freshman guard Tasha Dickey (7.3
ppg). Hones, though, is confident
that the team is "really prepared"
for the duo. Additionally, Stanford
will be able to play aggressively
against the Wildcats in an effort to
force Arizona to shoot free throws.
The 'Cats are shooting only 64 per
cent from the charity stripe on the
season.
Regardless of the contest's
seeming lopsidedness. Appel says
Stanford will use this game as a
learning opportunity and another
stride toward Pac-10 success.
"1 think the Arizona road trip
has really been taken seriously in
recent years because of the caliber
of teams," Appel said. "So. 1 think
that we'll come out with that same
attitude: they're just one more step
in getting to where we want to be.
[The Arizona game] will really set
our momentum for how we'll be
playing in the next couple of
games."
