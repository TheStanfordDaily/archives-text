# Mitch Johnson and Taj Finger
## Overlooked duo steps up 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON 
When things have gone wrong in the last
two years — when Stanford lost five of its
final six games last season or snapped its
streak of 11 consecutive NCAA Tourna
ments in 2005 — Cardinal fans have often
saved much of their vitriol for Mitch Johnson and Taj Fin
ger.
Sure, the average tan salivates over the high scorers and
tends to overlook the team-first, defense-first players.
Even so, the criticism was not entirely without merit.
A thin depth chart pressed Mitch Johnson into the start
ing point guard role, the team's driver's seat, the moment
he stepped foot on the Farm in the fall of 2005. Despite a
royal pedigree — his father J.J. won an NBA Champi
onship in 1979 with Seattle — the younger Johnson was
not mentally ready. He was tentative with the rock and his
31 percent shooting allowed defenders to sag, making it
much tougher for Mitch to set his teammates up with pass
es.
Meanwhile, Finger (one of two Cardinal seniors) came
to Stanford a stick-thin 6'B", 185 pounds — and coaches
must have weighed him after Thanksgiving dinner. Finger
was not physically ready for the Pac-10 paint and it showed.
Defenders muscled him to under 35 percent shooting his
freshman season and under 50 percent his next two sea
sons.
But the duo worked as hard as anyone, and, like college
players often do, improved from one season to the next.
Last year. Finger shot a big-man-best 79 percent from the
line and grabbed as many offensive rebounds as he had his
sophomore year, despite the Lopez twins cutting his per
game minutes from 20 to 13. His defense was such a boost
that Trent Johnson started to substitute him in during close
games, when he needed a player he could trust to make the
stop.
Johnson, meanwhile, began to find a stroke and raised
his shooting percentage from 31 percent to 36 percent last
year. That may not sound like much, but it forced defend
ers to begin to guard him honestly, and opened up that
many more scoring opportunities lor his teammates. In a
year when Stanford was literally the last team named into
the NCAA Tournament, Johnson's improvement was sig
nificant in keeping Stanford from an NI T encore.
"They're probably two of the
most competitive guys, and they
work so haid." Trent Johnson said.
"Taj and Mitch both are players, re
gardless of what's going on with the
time or score, whether they're in or
out, you feel good having them
around."
Numbers can only tell part of the
story, however. The team saw the
rest, the qualities that can't be quan
tified.They saw l inger s hustle,chas
ing down seemingly every loose ball
last year.They saw Johnson's dedica
tion to the game, devoting this past
summer to workouts and pickup
games in his hometown Seattle.
Ultimately, the squad spoke with
its ballots.'lTiough every other starter
(Brook and Robin Lopez, Anthony
Goods and Lawrence Hill) will likely
play basketball at the next level, the
two Stanford basketball captains this
year are Mitch Johnson and Taj Fin
ger.
"It's about the team, and not
themselves." Trent Johnson said.
"TTiat's what college athletics is all
about."
But just when you thought their
improvement, their seniority, their
captaincy and their selflessness
might finally inure them from criti
cism. Johnson and Finger were
forced through the spin cycle yet
again before this season. With pre
season expectations the highest in
years, so too were the doubts: Stan
ford would only go as far as Brook
and Robin Lopez carried them. If
only they had any front court depth,
they would be preseason top-10.
many believed.
Throw in Goods. Fred Washing
ton and Hill on the wings and the two
through five positions are solid. If
only Stanford had a Pac-10-caliber
point guard, they might even be pre
season top-five.
Funny how things work out.
though. Stanford's two most consis
tent players this year might also be
the squad's most maligned.
Let's not oversell the pair: John
son still is not where he wants to be
with his turnovers and his shot, and
Finger will never be the offensive
threat that the Lopez twins do, a
threat that has made them the team
MVPs id date.
Still, no one has improved more
than Johnson and Finger. Johnson's

assist-to-turnover ratio, the ultimate
measure of a point guard, is north of
two for the first time in his career. His
Achilles heel does not lurk so promi
nently either: after shooting 31 and
36 percent his first two seasons, his
accuracy has jumped to 41 percent
this year, one point higher than
Goods, the starting shooting guard.
"He's just taking care of the ball
and making the right decisions," Fin
ger said. "If he has an open shot, he's
taking advantage. He's taking it to
the rim a little harder, a little
stronger."
Finger's improvement is perhaps
even more drastic yet. He's now
making 55 percent of his shots, after
shooting at 34, 4 I J and 48 percent
clips his first three seasons. But more
importantly, given the recent stretch
where a different player has an off
night every single game. Finger is one
of the only men who is playing con
sistently.
"The thing about Taj is you always
know what you're going to get."
Mitch Johnson said. "So much of his
game is hustle and efficiency, so it's
pretty clear, he's not going to take 10
shots this game and not enough the
next. You can insert him with any
combination and he's going to do
great."
Only Johnson can speak to the
reasons for his improvement, but
Finger made this same jump to take
his game to the next level, and this is
most likely what Goods, Hill and
Landry Fields need to snap out of
their funks.
"It's the experience and maturity
that gives you confidence in your
game to not second-guess yourself,
but know that your game is good
enough," he said."lt's the confidence
to be yourself, just play your own
game and not do things you don't
necessarily need to do."
Sure enough, this newfound con
fidence is working for Finger. If
you're only as good as your last
game, Taj is the best player on the
team not named Brook. Had his
teammates followed his 2-of-3 over
all and 5-of-6 free-throw shooting
against Oregon, Stanford would be
celebrating a comfortable win over
the Ducks, instead of swallowing the
bitter aftertaste of a narrow loss
which saw the team go 13-for-25
from the free-throw line.

"The only way I play is with pas
sion," Finger said. "J feel like if i play
hard. I get everyone to play hard and
the team fires up its intensity."
Fans and reporters knew all along
the Finger-Johnson tandem would
play this hard, but certainly not this
well. We foresaw the 13-3 start, but
no one in their wildest dreams saw
Taj and Mitch making such key con
tributions to the 'W* column.

So, on behalf of the Sixth Man and
the fourth estate, sorry guys. We un
derestimated you badly.
But on second thought, maybe 1
should take that back. After all, you
both seem to be at your best just
when no one thinks you will ever get
there.

Junior Mitch Johnson has been in the spotlight by necessity since his arrival on
campus in 2005 as the Cardinal's only true point guard option. After
absorbing plenty of abuse from fans and pundits, Johnson has picked up his
game this season, raising his shooting average by five points to 41 percent.
