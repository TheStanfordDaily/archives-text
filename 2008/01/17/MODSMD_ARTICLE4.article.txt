# Mitch Johnson and Taj Finger
## Overlooked duo steps up 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON 
When things have gone wrong in the last
two years — when Stanford lost five of its
final six games last season or snapped its
streak of 11 consecutive NCAA Tourna
ments in 2005 — Cardinal fans have often
saved much of their vitriol for Mitch Johnson and Taj Fin
ger.
Sure, the average tan salivates over the high scorers and
tends to overlook the team-first, defense-first players.
Even so, the criticism was not entirely without merit.
A thin depth chart pressed Mitch Johnson into the start
ing point guard role, the team's driver's seat, the moment
he stepped foot on the Farm in the fall of 2005. Despite a
royal pedigree — his father J.J. won an NBA Champi
onship in 1979 with Seattle — the younger Johnson was
not mentally ready. He was tentative with the rock and his
31 percent shooting allowed defenders to sag, making it
much tougher for Mitch to set his teammates up with pass
es.
Meanwhile, Finger (one of two Cardinal seniors) came
to Stanford a stick-thin 6'B", 185 pounds — and coaches
must have weighed him after Thanksgiving dinner. Finger
was not physically ready for the Pac-10 paint and it showed.
Defenders muscled him to under 35 percent shooting his
freshman season and under 50 percent his next two sea
sons.
But the duo worked as hard as anyone, and, like college
players often do, improved from one season to the next.
Last year. Finger shot a big-man-best 79 percent from the
line and grabbed as many offensive rebounds as he had his
sophomore year, despite the Lopez twins cutting his per
game minutes from 20 to 13. His defense was such a boost
that Trent Johnson started to substitute him in during close
games, when he needed a player he could trust to make the
stop.
Johnson, meanwhile, began to find a stroke and raised
his shooting percentage from 31 percent to 36 percent last
year. That may not sound like much, but it forced defend
ers to begin to guard him honestly, and opened up that
many more scoring opportunities lor his teammates. In a
year when Stanford was literally the last team named into
the NCAA Tournament, Johnson's improvement was sig
nificant in keeping Stanford from an NI T encore.
