## Residences defaced with hate graffiti University condemns "acts of intolerance" in Roble, Lag 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Jireh Tan '11 was sitting in his Resident As
sistant's dorm room the week after Thanksgiv
ing break when his R A passed him an envelope.
In it was his door sign. On it, someone had writ
ten "die fag fag fag fag."
"When I saw it my blood was chilled," he
said. "I felt really scared."
Tan's troubles began when one of his friends
returned from Thanksgiving break to find the
sign. Tan had previously put his door sign out
side his friend's room as a joke. It was not the
only defiled item; someone had also scrawled
"stupid fag" on a picture of Tan posted outside
his friend's room.
Tan's friend removed the sign and gave it to
their Resident Assistant (RA) The incident
was then reported to the West Lagunita Court
Resident Fellow (RF) Marvin Diogenes.
Though Tan knew about the scribbling on his
picture, he only learned about the death threat
