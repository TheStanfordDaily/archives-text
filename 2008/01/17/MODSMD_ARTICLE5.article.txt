## Residences defaced with hate graffiti University condemns "acts of intolerance" in Roble, Lag 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
Jireh Tan '11 was sitting in his Resident As
sistant's dorm room the week after Thanksgiv
ing break when his R A passed him an envelope.
In it was his door sign. On it, someone had writ
ten "die fag fag fag fag."
"When I saw it my blood was chilled," he
said. "I felt really scared."
Tan's troubles began when one of his friends
returned from Thanksgiving break to find the
sign. Tan had previously put his door sign out
side his friend's room as a joke. It was not the
only defiled item; someone had also scrawled
"stupid fag" on a picture of Tan posted outside
his friend's room.
Tan's friend removed the sign and gave it to
their Resident Assistant (RA) The incident
was then reported to the West Lagunita Court
Resident Fellow (RF) Marvin Diogenes.
Though Tan knew about the scribbling on his
picture, he only learned about the death threat
a week later, as his friend assumed that
he already knew. He subsequently
called the police.
"It's the silences that are scary.'Tan
said. "Every time people don't speak
up, it's a loss for everyone. When you
have such a thing happen to you. it's re
ally nothing more than an act of verbal
terrorism. Coming out with this story
removes the power from that person."
West Lag staff members are cur
rently in the process of setting up dorm
discussion with Safe and Open Spaces
at Stanford to discuss homophobic be
havior.
But the Eucalipto resident's trou
bles are far from over. According to
Stanford Police Deputy Chris Cohen
det, the incident is still under investiga
tion.
Tan was not the only victim of hate
graffiti just before Winter break. In
Roble. indiscernible anti-Semitic re
marks were scribbled on a wall in hall

-3-C near where an egg had been
thrown.
RA Kristin Squires 09 awoke at 4
a.m. on Dec. 2 to the sounds of resi
dents talking in the hall. She found
them attempting to remove the scrib
bled message.
"From the information we have
pieced together, the egg vandal was a
non-Roble resident, and the person
who wrote the subsequent message
on the wall was a non-Stanford stu
dent," Squires said. "Also to the best
of my knowledge, the remarks were
random and not directed at a specific
person."
Squires informed her RFs about
the incident, who subsequently called
the police.The students on the hall ul
timately worked to clean the egg oft
the wall, and Student Housing had to
repaint the wall with the message writ
ten on it,costing the dorm about $100.
"Anti-Semitism is despicable,"
Roble RF Kate Chesley wrote in an
email to the dorm chat list following
the incident. "Stanford's greatest
strength is its diversity and its commit
ment to open and mutually respectful
dialogue in pursuit of knowledge.

Scrawling hateful remarks anony
mously on a residence hall wall is noth
ing more than ignorant cowardice. We
and the staff have no tolerance for
such acts. We hope you condemn them
as well."
Roble staff showed the film
"School lies," which explores anti-
Semitism, following the event.
"After the movie, the residents nat
urally began discussing the event, ask
ing Jewish residents how they feel,"
said Roble Cultural Awareness Asso
ciate Songya Kesler'oB in email to The
Daily. "It appeared that everyone
agreed that what had been written was
hurtful and wrong, and they were glad
to know that the offender was not a fel
low Stanford student."
University administrators have re
sponded by condemning the two
episodes. Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote an email
to the student body on Dec. 4, con

demning the two "acts of intolerance"
and citing the University's Statement
of Nondiscriminatory Policy and the
Fundamental Stanford.
"Behavior that maliciously and
harmfully targets an individual or a
group of individuals is not acceptable
and has no place within the Stanford
community," he wrote. "The Universi
ty is committed to principles of diversi
ty and respect for individual and group
differences which leave no room for
destructive or discriminatory behav
ior."
Associate Vice Provost Sally Dick
son is currently conducting a review to
evaluate current University protocol
for responding to such acts. Boardman
said that it is premature to discuss the
results of her efforts.
But Tan was disappointed with the
University's reaction to his episode.
He was frustrated that he was not im
mediately informed of the death

threat, and in turn that he was not able
to ask the police to come take a state
ment until a week later.
"They were telling me that they
could offer me psychological help or
they could move me temporarily from
the dorm." he said. "They suggested I
call the police but they did not impress
upon me the gravity of the situation."
In fact. Diogenes called the police
on Nov. 28 to inform them of the inci
dent. Still, they did not come to the
dorm until Tan asked.
"This is part of what Sally Dickson
and her group are reviewing in relation
to the acts of intolerance protocol,"
Diogenes said in an email to The Daily.
"1 venture that the importance of clear
and prompt communication will be
emphasized."
Boardman said the homophobic
remarks were a matter of concern for a
number of administrators and offices
â€” Associate Dean Thorn Massey, the

Residence Deans, Dickson, Interim
Director of Residential Education
John Pearson, community center staff
and the Freshman Dean's office.
"There was continuing communi
cation between Student Affairs staff
and the affected student, and staff
made a concerted effort to respond to
the students' concerns," he wrote in an
earlier email.
Despite his dissatisfaction with the
University's response, Tan encouraged
peers to reveal acts of intolerance
committed against them.
"I'm fortunate enough that I dealt
with my issues of sexuality earlier in
life," Tan said. "I'm confident enough
to not care what other people thing
about me. How many other people
think they will not be supported, they
will not be heard?"

side his friend's room as a joke. It was not the
only defiled item; someone had also scrawled
"stupid fag" on a picture of Tan posted outside
his friend's room.
Tan's friend removed the sign and gave it to
their Resident Assistant (RA) The incident
was then reported to the West Lagunita Court
Resident Fellow (RF) Marvin Diogenes.
Though Tan knew about the scribbling on his
picture, he only learned about the death threat
a week later, as his friend assumed that
he already knew. He subsequently
called the police.
"It's the silences that are scary.'Tan
said. "Every time people don't speak
up, it's a loss for everyone. When you
have such a thing happen to you. it's re
ally nothing more than an act of verbal
terrorism. Coming out with this story
removes the power from that person."
West Lag staff members are cur
rently in the process of setting up dorm
discussion with Safe and Open Spaces
at Stanford to discuss homophobic be
havior.
But the Eucalipto resident's trou
bles are far from over. According to
Stanford Police Deputy Chris Cohen
det, the incident is still under investiga
tion.
Tan was not the only victim of hate
graffiti just before Winter break. In
Roble. indiscernible anti-Semitic re
marks were scribbled on a wall in hall

-3-C near where an egg had been
thrown.
RA Kristin Squires 09 awoke at 4
a.m. on Dec. 2 to the sounds of resi
dents talking in the hall. She found
them attempting to remove the scrib
bled message.
"From the information we have
pieced together, the egg vandal was a
non-Roble resident, and the person
who wrote the subsequent message
on the wall was a non-Stanford stu
dent," Squires said. "Also to the best
of my knowledge, the remarks were
random and not directed at a specific
person."
Squires informed her RFs about
the incident, who subsequently called
the police.The students on the hall ul
timately worked to clean the egg oft
the wall, and Student Housing had to
repaint the wall with the message writ
ten on it,costing the dorm about $100.
"Anti-Semitism is despicable,"
Roble RF Kate Chesley wrote in an
email to the dorm chat list following
the incident. "Stanford's greatest
strength is its diversity and its commit
ment to open and mutually respectful
dialogue in pursuit of knowledge.

Scrawling hateful remarks anony
mously on a residence hall wall is noth
ing more than ignorant cowardice. We
and the staff have no tolerance for
such acts. We hope you condemn them
as well."
Roble staff showed the film
"School lies," which explores anti-
Semitism, following the event.
"After the movie, the residents nat
urally began discussing the event, ask
ing Jewish residents how they feel,"
said Roble Cultural Awareness Asso
ciate Songya Kesler'oB in email to The
Daily. "It appeared that everyone
agreed that what had been written was
hurtful and wrong, and they were glad
to know that the offender was not a fel
low Stanford student."
University administrators have re
sponded by condemning the two
episodes. Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote an email
to the student body on Dec. 4, con

demning the two "acts of intolerance"
and citing the University's Statement
of Nondiscriminatory Policy and the
Fundamental Stanford.
"Behavior that maliciously and
harmfully targets an individual or a
group of individuals is not acceptable
and has no place within the Stanford
community," he wrote. "The Universi
ty is committed to principles of diversi
ty and respect for individual and group
differences which leave no room for
destructive or discriminatory behav
ior."
Associate Vice Provost Sally Dick
son is currently conducting a review to
evaluate current University protocol
for responding to such acts. Boardman
said that it is premature to discuss the
results of her efforts.
But Tan was disappointed with the
University's reaction to his episode.
He was frustrated that he was not im
mediately informed of the death

threat, and in turn that he was not able
to ask the police to come take a state
ment until a week later.
"They were telling me that they
could offer me psychological help or
they could move me temporarily from
the dorm." he said. "They suggested I
call the police but they did not impress
upon me the gravity of the situation."
In fact. Diogenes called the police
on Nov. 28 to inform them of the inci
dent. Still, they did not come to the
dorm until Tan asked.
"This is part of what Sally Dickson
and her group are reviewing in relation
to the acts of intolerance protocol,"
Diogenes said in an email to The Daily.
"1 venture that the importance of clear
and prompt communication will be
emphasized."
Boardman said the homophobic
remarks were a matter of concern for a
number of administrators and offices
â€” Associate Dean Thorn Massey, the

Residence Deans, Dickson, Interim
Director of Residential Education
John Pearson, community center staff
and the Freshman Dean's office.
"There was continuing communi
cation between Student Affairs staff
and the affected student, and staff
made a concerted effort to respond to
the students' concerns," he wrote in an
earlier email.
Despite his dissatisfaction with the
University's response, Tan encouraged
peers to reveal acts of intolerance
committed against them.
"I'm fortunate enough that I dealt
with my issues of sexuality earlier in
life," Tan said. "I'm confident enough
to not care what other people thing
about me. How many other people
think they will not be supported, they
will not be heard?"
