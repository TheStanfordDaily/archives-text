## Kresge to be demolished Law School space constraints prompt tearing down of auditorium by 2011 at the latest 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Students who have taken a class in
Kresge Auditorium should prepare to
say goodbye to the building. In the next
three or four years, the auditorium will
be torn down as part of the Law
School's plan to build a second law

building in its place.
Since its inception, the Stanford Law
School has fast outgrown its current
quarters.The Board ofTrustees recently
approved a proposal to erect a second
law building to alleviate the space
squeeze.
In addition, to make up for Kresge's
demolition, the Law School and the

Graduate School of Business (GSB)
will collaborate to replace the current
approximately 450-seat GSB auditori
um with a 600-seat auditorium like
Kresge.
"The conversation for constructing
this new law building started around
2000." said Law School Dean Larry
Kramer. "By 2004, it was clear that

something had to be done."
The current Law School building,
constructed in 1975, was initially home
to 143 students, faculty and administra
tors. This year, that number ap
proached 300. Studies project that the
Law School will have more than 300 af-

filiates in 2010.
"Our space constraints are dras
tic," Kramer said. "We're about
75.0(H) square feet short. In this posi
tion we can't do a lot of the things that
we want to do programmatically."
One such program that is con
strained by space is the law clinic
program.
"It is our goal to perhaps make
these clinics mandatory in the fu
ture," said Frank Brucato, Senior As
sociate Dean of Administration and
CFO of the Law School. "Our cur

rent building is not adequate for col
laboration between students and
faculty."
Hie new building will also house
the entire law faculty, some of whom
presently do not have offices in the
law building and thus work outside
the Law School.
"According to our preliminary
plans, the first floor of the new build
ing will be devoted to clinics." Bru
cato said. "The second and third
floors will have faculty offices and a
terrace."
In terms of budget, the new
building itself is estimated to cost
$45 million. However, taking into
consideration "soft costs" such as
landscaping, taxes, engineering and
furniture, the project total may rise

to $75 million.
"The Board of Trustees was care
ful to consider our plan since they
don't want to waste money," Brucato
added. "But the hardest part about
getting approval was getting the
General Use Permit. Stanford has to
get permission from Santa Clara
County for how much space we can
use to build on."
With the site now approved, the
Law School's next step is to present a
preliminary building plan to the
Board of Trustees in March.
"We're hoping to have the new
building done by fall of 2010,"
Kramer said. "Fall 2011 at the latest."
