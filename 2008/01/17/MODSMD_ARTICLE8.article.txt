## GSC votes down making all grads eligible for GO Pass 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
After an energetic debate and some
agitated deliberations, the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) voted 8-5-1
against a new resolution that would
make all graduate students eligible for
the Caltrain GO Pass program, at their
meeting last night.
The failed resolution proposed by the
GSC members suggested that the Cal

train GO Pass program be available for
all graduate students provided that all
graduate students are charged a $106 an
nual fee for the value of their own pass.
The GO Pass for off-campus gradu
ate students is a program that subsidizes
train passes for unlimited use of Cal
train. At last week's meeting, the GSC
members unanimously rejected a pro
posal by Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82. which suggested funding for
the GO Pass program in 2(X)8 by charg

ing a mandatory annual $45 fee to both
on-campus and off-campus graduate
students. The funding model only bene
fited the latter.
Before a vote was taken, co-chair of
the GSC George Bloom, a doctoral stu
dent in comparative literature, present
ed the reasons why there have been var
ious limitations constraining the funding
models of the GO Pass program for off
campus students.
Hie standard contract offered bv

Caltrain has a binding mandated mini
mum requirement. Bloom said. Accord
ing to the contract, every eligible mem
ber of the graduate student body,
whether the student lives off-campus or
on-campus, is required to buy a GO Pass
in order to benefit from the program.
The Graduate Student Transportation
Board estimated that the total cost of the
GO Pass to the University last year was
$350,000.
Additionally, Caltrain has a man
dated maximum cost that prohibits
companies from charging GO Pass
beneficiaries more than the face
value of the pass, which is $106 per
student.
"This is why we cannot charge
1.0(H) students [who would agree] to
buy the GO Pass even for a $400 dol
lar fee," liloom said."There is no way
around it."
Bloom added that the proposal of
a non-refundable charge on all grad
uate students equal to the full cost of
the program is the first funding
model he has supported.
"Although this is not the best
funding model, it is the only feasible,
inclusive and financially sustainable
model." he added. "This is equal op
portunity and equal cost for every
one."
After Bloom presented the pro
posal. Co-chair of the GSC Kristina
Keating read an email response from
Etchemendy, which was addressed to
the council and which stated the
Provost's stance on the issue.
"The University has invested and
will continue to invest very large
amounts of money in subsidized on
campus housing to make it possible
for any student to live on campus
who so chooses," his email read."l do

not want the large number of stu
dents who do not want a GO Pass or
who do not think it is worth $10b to
think the charge was imposed by me
or 'the administration.'"
When the floor opened up for
comments, arguments in support of
the new GO Pass funding proposal
were strongly debated. Some atten
dants at the meeting argued that the
GO Pass offered a reasonable cost
for a student commuter that was not
offered otherwise.
Psychology graduate student Jes
sica Cameron, one of the three lead
ers of the GO Pass action committee,
affirmed that the GO Pass not only
benefits off-campus graduate stu
dents who choose to live in the city
because of personal, family and pro
fessional reasons, but also graduate
students who would like to go to San
Francisco and other vicinities.
The majority of GSC members,
however, did not support the resolu
tion. While some GSC opponents of
the resolution stated that the GO
Pass was not a cost that their con
stituents were willing to incur, others
agreed that the bus system offered a
better service to the city and more
convenient schedules.
"1 lonestly. I wouldn't pay for GO
Pass," said fifth year doctoral student
Maria Spletter, a member of the
GSC who lives on campus. "It does
n't take me where I want to go in San
Francisco." «•
