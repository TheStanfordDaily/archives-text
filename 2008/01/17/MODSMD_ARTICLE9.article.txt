## Vaden expands online services New Web appointment sign-ups simplify patient scheduling 
### JESSICA FISHELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Email reminders and the option to cancel appoint
ments with the click of a button have long been a part of
the Vaden Health Center's online services, but patients
can now schedule appointments from the comfort of
their own computers.
The beta version of the service launched this past
summer as a way for patients to schedule annual exams.
Clinical Assistant Prof, at the School of Medicine
Robyn Tepper, who manages the electronic medical sys
tem at Vaden, quickly saw that people were trying to use
it to schedule other types of appointments as well. The
service has been gradually expanding to include sched
uling for injections and routine visits, as well as for more
complex issues like anxiety or insomnia.
"We haven't had to do any kind of advertising be
cause people seem to be finding it on their own,"Tepper
said. "The Web appointments are always the first to fill
up, even at two in the morning."
Convenience is the key advantage of the new service
since patients can schedule appointments at all hours of
the day without having to wait on hold. The new system
also alleviates some of the pressure on office phones.
Furthermore, patients can often save time in the of
fice by filling out any required health questionnaires
online. This also allows physicians to review the ques
tionnaires beforehand so that they do not have to take
the time to do so during the visit.
But the system is not perfect.
According to Tepper, one of the problems with the
online interface is that patients tend to click through the
forms without reading the instructions, which may con
tain important details about preparing for appoint
ments.
For this reason, some types of visits cannot be sched
uled online. Appointments involving payments not cov
ered by insurance must be made over the phone or in
person, along with visits regarding a number of complex
health issues.
Tepper also said that some patients have misused the
site by signing up for the wrong type of appointment,
prompting the office to prepare for the wrong kind of
visit.
"People would pick anything just to get an appoint
ment, figuring they could straighten it out upon arrival,"
she said. "If the visit you want isn't there, there's proba
bly a reason. Call in and check."
Sometimes, particular appointments are unavailable
online simply because all slots are filled. But Tepper
said that patients should not be deterred because Vaden
also reserves time slots each day for call-ins and urgent
care.
"The online system is meant to be an enhancement
to Vaden's services," Tepper said, "not a replacement."
