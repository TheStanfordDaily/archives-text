Ethics at Noon Jgjjj

"Discovery and Justice: The Impact of Medical Innovation on Social Disparities in Health"
Paul Wise, Medical School/Center for Health Policy
The session will address the question of whether medical discovery is truly relevant to social differences in health
outcomes. Evidence from the US and from around the world will be used to explore this issue and identify the mechanisms by
which engines of innovation such as Stanford are influencing the health of different social groups. In this manner, the
presentation will outline how medical discovery speaks to questions of social justice and the requirements for researchers and
public policy to ensure greater equity in health outcomes during a period of unprecedented medical innovation.

"Beyond Female Access to Education: A Feminist Cross-National Perspective"
Christine Min Wotipka, School of Education
Women now comprise over half of those enrolled in higher education in many countries around the world, including
the United States. American girls are out-performing their male counterparts to such a degree that many are calling for ways to
address the crisis in boy's education. Female participation in education in developing countries, likewise, has grown so much
that what matters more is the level of development of one's country rather than one's gender in determining the likelihood of
being enrolled in primary and secondary school.
With much of the attention on access in education, what is being missed by our inattention to experience in and
opportunities from education for girls and women? What is our responsibility as educators and as a society when women
experience discrimination and some would say "hostile environments" when they do enter male-dominated fields of study or
work? Or when women can still expect to only make 80 cents for every dollar men earn? What does the future hold when
advocacy has evaporated from many campuses and college students today resist being called feminists?

"What You Didn't Know You Didn't Know About the Ethics of Stem Cell Research"
Insoo Hyun, Ethics in Society Alum currently at Case Western Medical School
Much of the ethical discourse on human stem cell research has centered on the moral status of early human
embryos. As this debate rages on, however, human stem cell research has been proceeding vigorously in the hopes of
generating clinical applications of stem-cell-based therapies. This march has raised many new important ethical issues, which
tend to get overshadowed by the attention drawn to the moral status debate. The purpose of this presentation is to provide
an overview of some of these emerging ethical issues and the ethical implications of recent developments in stem cell research.
