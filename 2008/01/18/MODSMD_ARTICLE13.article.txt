## Editorial Board Gendering the new American dream 
### 
Nothing about the falling prestige of law
and medicine — or the subsequent
rising prestige of entrepreneurship —
screams of patriarchal oppression. Ihe ab
sence of overt signs of sexism in these new
trends, however, should not suggest that gen
der is inconsequential in the recent shifts in
professional prestige. In fact, while tracking
the fuzzy concept of "prestige" as it flits be
tween professions, applying a gendered per
spective establishes the ideals of the Ameri
can Dream in stark realities.
Consider a historical comparison: If ever
there was a profession that "fell down" from
a once-established position of prestige in the
American psyche.it would be education. Sta
tistical analyses of the real wages of teachers
show that once women broke the male mo
nopoly in the field of education, the salaries
of all teachers dropped. Was this merely the
result of steady demand coupled with a dou
bled supply pool, pushing down the wages of
educators? Before we write this hit of history
off in purely economic terms, the plummet
ing prestige of the education industry' is
Worth considering. Male teachers suddenly
found themselves drawing less praise for
their work as female teachers entered a
falling-down field.
Is it too much to draw a parallel between
the current situations of lawyers and doctors
arid the historic example set by educators?
Top law schools now generally matriculate 45
to 4K percent women in any given class. Sur
veys of medical school admissions and ma
triculation rates yield comparable statistics,
{ust as the number of women in these fields
begin to match those of men, these profes
sions lose prestige.
Women have still not achieved equality in
the fields of law and medicine. Iheir numbers
should not cloak the insidious discrepancies
between the positions and salaries of men
and women in each field. If we look beyond
the problems within each profession, howev
er. and examine ways in which professions
are positioned vis-a-vis one another, larger.

structural issues emerge highlighting the per
sistence of gender norms in shaping the
American psyche.
The demands of the rising professions —
hedge fund managing, management consult
ing and entrepreneurship, according to the
New York Times article — disproportionate
ly hinder women. While the long hours and
travel obligations of lawyers and doctors are
nothing to regard lightly, hedge fund manag
ing requires work hours that match the trad
ing hours of distant time zones. Similarly,
management consulting demands a rigorous
schedule of nearly perpetual travel and en
trepreneurship carries a degree of risk that
many working women feel uncomfortable
placing upon their families. Adjusting sleep
schedules, jetting to new locales and mort
gaging the family home to finance a new
start-up are lovely and engaging pursuits for
young college graduates. For those couples
with children, however, it is unfeasible for
both parents to engage in these activities.The
reality is that lingering standards for feminin
ity disproportionately block women from the
new rising professions.
Concepts of prestige and professionalism
are changing to reward those who take risks,
follow their passions and lead creative lives;
this is not inherently a bad thing. However,
before we throw our hands together in ecstat
ic applause for the changes that are drifting
over the American psyche, it is necessary to
take a moment and inspect the implications
of these changes from a critical perspective.
When gender is factored into the new formu
la for the American dream, it becomes appar
ent that ours is a society in which the trap
pings of prestige are still not equally accessi
ble to all.

This is the second of two editorials inspired by
Alex Wiliums's Jan. 6 article in the New York
Times, "The Falling-down Professions." The
first editorial, "Profession preferences: Entre
preneurs emerge," appeared in yesterday's
Daily.
