# Burning Down the House
## The 						gender police state 
### 
When my freshman dorm did
"Crossing the Line" and the cate
gory was "feminist," only one guy
in the dorm crossed. It wasn't me. Later, a
female friend asked me, "Gabe. what the
hell? Why didn't you cross?" I explained
that I'd been at a performance of "The
Vagina Monologues," and so missed that
freshman dorm exercise all-together.
My reason for not crossing was pretty
damn good. As for the rest of the guys on
my hall though, I don't know what their
problem was. I liked almost all of them,
and a lot are still my friends, three years
later. Almost all of them would identify
themselves as liberals on social issues, by
any measure. But there they stood, feet
planted on the wrong side.
Seen from a broad historical viewpoint,
feminism's failure and misogyny's tenacity
markedly stand out. Racism perhaps still
crouches deep inside us, but nobody hesi
tates to declare support for the civil rights
crusaders who drove it into hiding. Accep
tance of gay rights is becoming more wide
spread by the day. So what the hell hap
pened to feminism?
Obviously, a lot of people — men and
women both — blanch at the idea of iden
tifying as feminists, even when they are.
How many times have you heard someone
say, "I'm not a feminist . .." followed by a
completely agreeable and inoffensive
statement about equality? A lot of femi
nists seem to be in hiding or in denial.
More unsettling, though, is the stubborn
persistence of casual misogyny. It's not too
infrequently that I hear guys, otherwise
classified as liberal and tolerant, make
semi-joking comments about women being
unable to drive. Substitute "black people"
for women, and judge for yourself. Over
break. I had a conversation with my male
friends from home, in which they each said
they expected to marry a woman who
earned less. This doesn't even begin to ad
dress the huge numbers of Stanford dudes
who profess egalitarian beliefs in public,
and then act like Victorians in their private
relatioilships. My mom likes to quote
something she overheard on a train in
Barcelona: "El es comunista en la calle, y
fascista en la casa" — he's a communist on
the street, and a fascist in the house.
Nothing I've said up until now is re
motely original. It's information that's ob
viously available, singing and dancing and
doing a sickening striptease right in front

of you. if only you're willing to look — the
enforcement of gender norms has spread
into unimaginable areas.
There's an area of study in political psy
chology devoted to what's called "the au
thoritarian personality." The essence of
the idea is that there is a personality type
that simply cannot stomach social differ
ences. The theory was conceived in the
wake of Nazism, and its originators clearly
had racial intolerance in mind. But with
racism driven underground, maybe au
thoritarian energy needed somewhere
else to go.
When that one hallmate of mine
crossed the line freshman year, he knew
perfectly well the definition of feminism.
But finding himself the only male standing
out, he looked around and said, "It just
means you support equality, right?" It's
not a war between men and women, and
it's not feminists who decided to interpret
it that way, to make it socially uncomfort
able to be alone on that side of the line.
People always say that feminists want
to politicize everything, to gender things
that have no gender. TTiis is exactly back
wards. The fury directed at those who are
perceived to be gender-bending is visible
wherever you look, and it's not pretty. It
doesn't take a sharp eye to see the gender
police on patrol everywhere, watching
who talks in class, who comes to parties
and even who eats what.
For example, on Tiiesday,The Daily ran
a story about the Axe and Palm adding
vegetarian options to its menu.Though it's
unclear to me when it happened, obvious
ly tofu has now come to mean "gay."
Here's a selection from the Web site's
comment thread:
"John" writes, "The small number of
whiny vegans and vegetarians get their
way while the red-blooded Americans get
screwed . . . STANFORD DO NOT LET
THESE HIPPIES AND FREAKS RUN
THE SCHOOL." See how he did that? It's


Gabe
Winant
whiny, effeminate and anti-Ameri
can all at once to want to eat the
things that you want to eat.
"Enraged student" agrees. "It is
not right for students to push their
alternative vegetarian lifestyle on
the normal students."
So let's clear something up.
There's a difference between no

Gabe knows that somewhere on
campus, guys will read this and say,
