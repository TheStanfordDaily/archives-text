						homily on humility

They go by various names. "The IHUM
kid." "That guy." "The girl in the front
row." But none of those terms really
captures the idea.
After all. IHUM kids can. and do. exist in
classes other than IHUM. "That guy" doesn't
necessarily mean anything negative, and
someone who is sitting in the front row may
very well have had nowhere else to sit.
Therefore, I propose a new term: Olmecs.
The Olmec people were a Pre-Columbian
tribe living in tropical Mexico. Little is known
about them, except that they left behind ex
tremely large stone head statues. The same
sized head is strikingly prevalent in Stanford's
population.Thus, the Olmecs.
In discussions with friends, many theories
have been put forth as to the origin of these
mysterious large heads. But I have realized
that the problem is an institutional one. Stan
ford, as an institution, lacks the ability to
frighten its students. More importantly, it is
unable to instill in them a sense of their own
insignificance.
I've heard quite a few people asking each
other after lecture, with reference to these no
torious 01mecs."0o you think she knows that
everyone finds her annoying?" But this ques
tion is phrased incorrectly. It should be. "Do
you think she cares that everyone finds her
annoying?" The answer is a resounding
"No!". Out of sheer arrogance, she has tran
scended the plane of normal, physical beings,
and rests instead in the ethereal realm of the
demigods. And it is worth noting, you can't
teach a demigod anything she doesn't already
know.
We need something huge, something im
posing. some Gothic architecture, for God's
sake. Something to remind us how tiny and
stupid we are. But where the hell are we going
to find this, on a campus whose tallest build
ing is a hilariously phallic observation tower?
It takes away from some of the architectural
gravitas to think that scores of Asian tourists
ascend daily this monumental metaphorical
shaft to reach what amounts to a reservoir tip.
We need gargoyles, we need the accumu
lated grime of centuries, we need a museum
that showcases medieval torture exhibits. Be
cause this whole "the sky is the limit" crap is
producing too many overconfident know-it
alls
If it were up to me. and clearly it's not. the
school would provide the most oppressive
possible learning environment. Free discus
sion, bam. out the window. Comments in lec
ture? Gone. Going up to the professor after
class? Verboten. morning, I would
broadcast over a speaker system. "You are
nothing. You arc roughly 20 years old. Your

knowledge, if it exists at all. is worthless."
I think we need something akin to the me
dieval university system, where students,
known as "bajans." were subjugated into po
sitions of inferiority, forced to undergo a de
grading rite of passage known as the "jocund
advent." After a year in the university, the stu
dents lost their lowly bajan status by ex
pounding and debating on a written text.
In medieval universities, students could
expect to receive frequent smacks with a
birch rod. wielded by a firm and unyielding

master. It was an oppressive and humiliating
atmosphere â€” appropriate, given its monas
tic foundations.
In all seriousness, it may not be necessary
to go to such extremes, hut I am at a loss as to
how to silence the braggarts of Stanford Uni
versity.
True, for every Arrogant Andy. Stanford
seems to have two Modest Mandys. But it just
so happens that the arrogant know-it-alls are
at least twice as annoying. Andys, get out of
my education system. Go live in a domed is
land enclosure, and power your bubble
hound colony by means of a generator that
runs on hot air, your chief agricultural output.
Education is founded on an abstract no
tion of "free dialogue." In talking about
pressing issues, we can understand the world
view of others, and inform our own. But
whatever this vague term may mean, I know
