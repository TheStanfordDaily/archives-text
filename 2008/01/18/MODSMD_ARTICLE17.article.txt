Time to move on from GoPass
To the Editor,
As Graduate Student Council (GSC) co-
Chair in 2005-06. I supported the GoPass for
off-campus grad students because I believe in
public transportation and think that it offers
many benefits, both to the individual and
community. However, as the GoPass pro
gram has developed over the years, it has be
come clear to me that a subsidized GoPass is
not the right solution for commuting gradu
ate students.The University, the GSC and the
Graduate Student Transportation Board
(GSTB) should spend their energy looking
into alternative solutions.
As an off-campus grad student and a 2007
GoPass holder, 1 understand how students
like Timothy Bonebrake [author of yester
day's op-ed, "The 2008 Caltrain No Pass"|
feel. Having GoPass taken away now means
adding a burden to an already strained stu
dent budget. However, the economics simply
cannot justify the University or the student
body paying approximately >400 per year for
each GoPass user. (There are 3,500 off-cam
pus grad students, and each GoPass costs
$100 per year. In 2007, 700 students paid for
their passes.) The $280,(XK) the University
spent last year on unused GoPasses could
have been put to much better use.
In addition to wasting large amounts of
money, a subsidized GoPass is redundant as
an incentive to use public transportation.

Caltrain is already cheaper than driving
alone. Consider the following analysis based
on Mr. Bonebrake's situation. According to
Google Maps.a round trip from the Hayward
Park Caltrain station to Stanford is 29 miles.
According to the AAA's 2006 estimates, it
costs 41.4 cents per mile to operate a small
sedan for 15.000 miles per year. Assuming 5
round trips per week and 4 weeks per month,
it costs $240.12 to commute to Stanford each
month. A monthly Caltrain pass from Hay
ward Park (Zone 2) to Palo Alto (Zone 3)
costs $106 per month. Even without the
GoPass, Mr. Bonebrake saves over $130 per
month by buying his own Caltrain pass.
Given that local fuel prices are much higher
than the national averages used to calculate
the AAA's estimates, the actual savings are
likely to be considerably more than what 1
have calculated here.
These numbers are incentive enough for
off-campus students to ride Caltrain to cam
pus. There is really no need for a further sub
sidy. 1 commend the members of the GSC,
GSTB and the University administration for
their efforts to help graduate student com
muters. However, it is time to move beyond
the GoPass and start working on other, more
cost-effective solutions for helping off-cam
pus grad students with commuting.

they no longer run quite the way
they used to, and think, "1 am so
oppressed." they don't get any
sympathy.
