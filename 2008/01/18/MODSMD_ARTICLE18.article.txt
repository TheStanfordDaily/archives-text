## Clinton sizzles in UC-Davis spotlight 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
DAVIS, Calif. — California Lt. Gov. John
Garamendi was trying to warm up the crowd.
"Are you ready for Hillary Clinton to be
president of the United States?" he yelled,
close to the microphone.
'Bill! Bill! Bill," the crowd chanted.
A group of college boys in an upper deck
tried to start a cheer.
"Four more years," they yelled.
When the 42nd president took the stage at
9:22 p.m., flanked by members of his Secret
Service detail,his white hair glowed under the
glaring lights of the UC-Davis basketball
arena.
Bill Clinton waved to the crowd five times,
as they gave him the first of two standing ova
tions. The largely young crowd, estimated at
7.8(H) with 3,500 additional people stuck out
side and unable to get in. seemed to energize
him. Some had waited more than five hours to
get in.
"I love you. Bill," a young woman
shrieked.The ex-president smiled.
If not for the blue signs that said "Hillary."
it might have been a little unclear who was
running for president amidst the hoopla.
The jubilant reception afforded the for
mer president at the Tuesday night rally in
this left-leaning college town, 105 miles
northeast of Stanford, is a reminder of how
potent a force Bill Clinton is in his wife's bid
to become the first woman president — espe
cially in California.
"If Hillary Clinton wins the California pri
mary, it's going to be largely because of Bill
Clinton," said UC-Berkeley Political Science
lecturer Dan Schnur, a veteran Republican
strategist. "He maintains such a high level of
popularity in California that he may be in a
position to decide the primary one way or an
other."
A not-so-secret weapon?
Without Bill, it seems fair to say there
would be no I lillary candidacy.The Man from
Hope, Ark. was the first Democrat since
Franklin D. Roosevelt to win two terms, and
he's still admired by many — even by those
who don't support his wife. Beth Lenz, 21. is
an undecided moderate who waited three
and-a-half hours to get in.

"Everyone is here for the experience," she
said, noting that she had Republican friends
in the crowd. "It was really cool to see a for
mer president."
Yet a decade after his impeachment. Mr.
Clinton carries a lot of baggage as he stumps
for his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-
N.Y.). Analysts say he might symbolize divi
siveness, and his eight years in the White
House made him the ultimate Washington in
sider. I le has trouble staying on message, and
he can steal the spotlight away from his wife
at inopportune times.
"There are some liabilities to use him as
the principal spokesman," said Communica
tion Prof. Shanto Iyengar, who teaches class
es on political campaign analysis. "A lot of
people want to close the page and move for
ward. ITiey see both Clintons as residuals of
the past."
Mr. Clinton has special pull in the Golden
State. While president, he visited the state
more than 70 times, according to a tally by the
San Francisco Chronicle. His daughter,
Chelsea '01. went to college at Stanford.
"California was the Clinton's home away
from home during the White House years."
said Hoover Fellow Bill Whalen. a specialist
on the states politics. "[Hillary] has devel
oped a good, established network out here."
Clinton fatigue?
During his speech at Davis, Clinton talked
about how different the world was when he
took office in January 1993.There were only a
handful of Web sites on the Internet, he said,
and the average cell phone weighed five
pounds. That kind of anecdote, while it got the
crowd laughing, is a reminder of how long the
Clintons have been on the national scene.
If Sen. Clinton won. it would mean a Bush
or Clinton would be president for at least 24.
maybe even 28, consecutive years.
"There's a fundamental yearning for dif
ferent style of politics," Iyengar said. "A lot of
people feel that |Illinois Sen. Barack] Obama
represents a complete break from this nor
mal, conventional style of politics."
The electorate's professed desire for
change, which catapulted Obama to a deci
sive win in lowa, forces Clinton strategists to
make careful calculations about how they can
effectively deploy Mr. Clinton so he does not
outshine his wife, analysts sav.

"It's similar to the situation that A 1 Gore
faced in 2tMX),"said Iyengar, "whether to em
brace Bill Clinton or keep him at an arm's
length distance."
There were signs that Mr. Clinton was
wearing out his welcome in New I lampshire.
Mark Leibovich reported in a front-page
New York Times story that the onetime
Comeback Kid was "drawing sleepy and
sometimes smallish crowds at big venues."
ITie next day, the Times reported that Clin
ton gave a speech at Dartmouth College that
"both bored many students (who walked out)
and generated much controversy."
Do crowds mean votes?
There was no sign of Clinton fatigue at
Davis.
Maybe it was because Mrs. Clinton scored
an upset in New 1 lampshire and saw a subse
quent bounce in national polls. Maybe it was
because students in California haven't had to
put up with months of candidate sojourns
through their school. Or maybe it was be
cause Bill Clinton still has his mojo.
After talking about the need to develop al
ternative energies, he began to transition.
"We have to decide," Clinton said.gearing
up to pitch his wife. "Who would be the best
person to do this?"

"You." a woman yelled, prompting laugh
ter and some cheering from the crowd.
Mr. Clinton continued.
"You need to know what your next presi
dent will do in the face of failure," he said.
"The president is the world's most important
employee ... You have to have someone who
can handle all the pressure and all the adula
tion and never forget you."
In two dozen interviews after the speech,
students here said Mr. Clinton's appearance
would not necessarily sway their vote.
"It was a lot of things you'd expect a past
president to say," said Julien Lacrosse, 18, who
plans to vote for former North Carolina Sen.
John Edwards in the Democratic primary on
Feb. 5. "He didn't push Hillary as much as 1
thought he would."
Going negative?
Mr. Clinton's unique position as the highest
profile spouse and surrogate in the race has
perhaps allowed him to say things his wife can
not. He's generally been perceived as more
openly critical of Obama than she has. He
prompted headlines and put the Clinton cam
paign on the defensive, for example, when in
New Hampshire he reportedly characterized
the Illinois senator's campaign as a "fairy tale."
At his speech here, however. Clinton only

directly criticized Ohama for what he said
was an inadequate health care plan. He men
tioned Obama's name only to note that he
had campaigned for the Illinois senator in
2004. "1 like 'em all," he said of the Democra
tic field.
Another time, he alluded to the senator as
"our opponent."
In that way, Mr. Clinton fits the part typi
cally played by a vice presidential nominee.
"Primary candidates don't have running
mates," said Schnur of Berkeley, "except for
Hillary."
More good than bad?
Ultimately, the consummate politician
once sinisterly called Slick Willie by his critics
has an uncanny, almost innate, ability to con
nect with people and crowds. He can quiet an
audience, give people the jitters and show em
pathy— think "1 feel your pain" — better
than anyone in the business.
" He's just marvelous on his feet," said UC-
Davis Political Science Prof. Ed Constantini.
"Who wouldn't want the biggest draw in
American politics on your side and working
24/7 on your behalf?"
