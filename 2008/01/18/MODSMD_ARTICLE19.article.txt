# Hot Topic: Professors talk election
## 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
As the race for the White J louse heats uppresidential candidates
on both sides of the aisle have put several key issues center stage, in
cluding leadership ability, war strategy, immigration reform, envi
ronmental policy and economic vision. Now University professors
who teach these topics weigh in on what is shaping up to be one of
the most hotly contested elections in recent memory.
■ "(The most interesting aspect of this election] is the increased political participation so far,
particularly of young people, and the renewed >ense of hope, idealism, optimism and
potentially revived faith in American democracy. I think the single most important issue
in this coming election is not experience; it is the leadership ability, imagination and
courage to rally the country behind the difficult steps we are going to have to take to ar
rest global warming, heal our economy, fight Islamic terrorism intelligently and restore
America's soft power and leadership position in the world."
—luny Diamond, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Professor of Sociology and Politi
cal Science and Contributor to the Barack Obama Campaign
■ "The openness of the race [is most interesting]. This is the first time since 1928 that nei
ther an incumbent president nor incumbent vice-president is contesting the primaries.
Even Republicans are running insurgent campaigns around the theme of 'change.'"
— Simon Jachnan, Professor of Political Science
■ "Watching the debates and interviews, I suffer from nausea at the hypocrisy wrapped up
in sanctimony. Electoral campaigns for me serve as an important reminder that democ
racy is like sausage; you love it until you observe how it is made."
— David Initin, Professor of Political Science
■ "The most interesting aspect of this election is that two of the leading candidates are a
woman and an African-American, and that major contemporary considerations have

conflicting implications for I he electorate: the war, the threat of terrorism, low presidential
approval, some economic indicators declining. If s not easy to predict which party will
win."
—Jon Krosnick, Professor m Humanities and Soaal Sciences, Commurkation, Political Set
ence and Psychology
■ "I see positive attnbutes in all of the current survivors. McCain has personal integrity, a
healthy streak of independence and a proven adroitness at crossing the partisan divide
even when it is personally costfy to do so. In the crunch, these attributes have to be ap
pealing to sensible moderates. Clinton and her team seem to be as facile, resilient and
shrewd as the Clinton electoral |uggernauts of the 19905. By running a first-rate cam
paign, she has mode all other candidates better. Obama, Huckabee and foul are all
breaths of fresh air for reasons that could hardly be different from one another. Who does
that leave? Oh, Edwards has nice hair, and Giuliani, 9/11"
—Keith Krehbiel, Graduate School of Business Professor and Professor of Political Science
■ "I like how close the Democratic primaries are. Both leading candidates, Clinton and
Obama, represent something very new and both would be fine presidents, which I did
not believe about the leading candidates in the previous primaries. Barack Obama is my
favorite."
—Jakub Kastf, Assistant Professor of Economics
■ "The most significant aspect of the election is ending the war in Iraq. All the leading De
mocrats are committed to withdrawal, and none of the leading Republicans have come
dose to this. Therefore, I will be happy to support whichever Democratic candidate re
ceives the nomination."
— Gavin Wright, Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and
Professor of American Economic History
■ "I think ifs great to have such a wide open race. I'm checking Intrade all the time."
—Jon Levini, Associate Professor of Economic
■ "As a registered Libertarian since the late 19705, I hope that next year at this time I can
say that I am one of fewer than 400,000 Americans who had the good sense to vote
twice for Ron Paul for president. Why? Because Libertarians stand for individual freedom,

in contrast to the other parties which are all statist in their own way."
—Moms Fiorina, Senior Fellow at fa Hoover Institution and Professor of Political Science
■ "The visual power of an example is the best part of this campaign looking at the
faces of young girls and minority youth during the candidates' campaign and knowing,
regardless of the outcome, that a fundamental message has been sent to tlie young: You
will haw new opportunities that my generation was denied but fought liard to create. I
support anyone who will turn around the terrible human rights legacy that the Bush Ad
ministration has left us."
— Terry Karl, Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Pro
fessor in latin American Studies
■ "I find the 'revolution' of the primary season interesting, both in terms of calendar and
duration, which is an 'interesting' aspect, albeit not a necessarily good aspect, of this
election. Academics will have lots to learn from it. I'm not a citizen, but if I [were] I would
support the Democratic candidate
— Luigi Pistafern, Associate Professor of Economics
■ "I am pleased at the diversity of candidates and the range of choice, but have not yet de
cidedwho I'll vote for."
—Martha Crenshaw, Senior Fellow at fa Freeman Spogli Institute fa International Studies
and Professor of Political Science
■ "Once the candidates ore chosen, I [will] be most interested in seeing how much the elec
toral map has changed since the last two elections, in terms of which states are 'in play
or have attained 'battleground' status, and the extent to which demographic and other
social changes may challenge existing assumptions about which states in the South and
West remain safely Republican. This is because, as a scholar, my deepest academic inter
est in presidential elections is concerned with the illogic of the Electoral College. I'm an
unreconstructed Cook County Democrat who would love to see a Clinton Obama ticket,
probably, but not necessarily in that order. I don't know whether Obama roots for the
Sox, but Clinton grew up a Cubs fan, and that would be a good litmus test for me."

ceives the nomination."

Professor of American Economic History
■ "I think ifs great to have such a wide open race. I'm checking Intrade all the time."

■ "As a registered Libertarian since the late 19705, I hope that next year at this time I can
say that I am one of fewer than 400,000 Americans who had the good sense to vote
twice for Ron Paul for president. Why? Because Libertarians stand for individual freedom,

in contrast to the other parties which are all statist in their own way."
—Moms Fiorina, Senior Fellow at fa Hoover Institution and Professor of Political Science
■ "The visual power of an example is the best part of this campaign looking at the
faces of young girls and minority youth during the candidates' campaign and knowing,
regardless of the outcome, that a fundamental message has been sent to tlie young: You
will haw new opportunities that my generation was denied but fought liard to create. I
support anyone who will turn around the terrible human rights legacy that the Bush Ad
ministration has left us."
— Terry Karl, Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Pro
fessor in latin American Studies
■ "I find the 'revolution' of the primary season interesting, both in terms of calendar and
duration, which is an 'interesting' aspect, albeit not a necessarily good aspect, of this
election. Academics will have lots to learn from it. I'm not a citizen, but if I [were] I would
support the Democratic candidate
— Luigi Pistafern, Associate Professor of Economics
■ "I am pleased at the diversity of candidates and the range of choice, but have not yet de
cidedwho I'll vote for."
—Martha Crenshaw, Senior Fellow at fa Freeman Spogli Institute fa International Studies
and Professor of Political Science
■ "Once the candidates ore chosen, I [will] be most interested in seeing how much the elec
toral map has changed since the last two elections, in terms of which states are 'in play
or have attained 'battleground' status, and the extent to which demographic and other
social changes may challenge existing assumptions about which states in the South and
West remain safely Republican. This is because, as a scholar, my deepest academic inter
est in presidential elections is concerned with the illogic of the Electoral College. I'm an
unreconstructed Cook County Democrat who would love to see a Clinton Obama ticket,
probably, but not necessarily in that order. I don't know whether Obama roots for the
Sox, but Clinton grew up a Cubs fan, and that would be a good litmus test for me."
