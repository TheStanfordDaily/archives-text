## Stanford third in campaign contributions 
### MELODY DYE STAFF WRITER 
The education industry is a leader in
overall federal campaign contributions
this election cycle, and Stanford is no ex
ception. The University ranked third
among peer institutions in the level of pri
vate donatioas to 2008 presidential candi
dates. according to an Oct. 29 analysis from
the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics (CRP). These contributions, made
primarily by University faculty ;ind admin
istrators, go in large part to support candi
dates from the Democratic Party.
Over the past 20 years, Stanford has
consistently ranked among the top 15 uni
versities in campaign contributions, ac
cording to the CRP The University has
often placed among the top five universi
ties, especially in the recent past.
In the 2000 presidential election, Stan
ford ranked third with contributions total
ing nearly $500,000, two-thirds of which
were earmarked for Democratic auidi
dates. Stanford was fourth in the 2001 pres
idential campaign with $625,000 in dona
tions; ;tn overwhelming 92 percent of con
tributions went to Democratic candidates
that year.
Contributions from Stanford affiliates
for the 200K presidential campaigns to
taled just over $180,0(X) as of Oct. 29. Over

tial campaigns, with 70 percent of funds
going to support Democratic candidates.
Sen. Barack Obama (D-III.) received 36
percent of Stanford-affiliate contributions.

the highest of any candidate, while Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) fol
lowed with 30 percent.
History Prof David Kennedy, an elect
ed delegate to the Presidential Nominat
ing Convention in Los Angeles in 2000, has
contributed to two Democratic camp;ugns
this election cycle, and said he has "long
supported Democratic candidates."
"There was nothing in particular that
prompted me to contribute this year,"
Kennedy said. "It's been a life-long prac
tice of mine to support people I believe in.
And I did. this time around, support
Barack Obama at the very highest legal
level. I believe in him strongly; I have great
hopes for him."
Kennedy, who also contributed to Gin
ton s campaign, said he was not surprised
that many of his colleagues had supported
Democratic candidates thus year. By and
large, he said, college faculties tend to be
liberal in their and this
is especially the case in the Bay Area. But
he did not think conservative voices were
underrepresented at Stanford.
"Stanford is a little unusual, in that it has
a very strong Republican-oriented wing of
the faculty," Kennedy said. "The Hoover
Institution provides a home for people of
that persuasion. In the world of university
faculties, we're probably a little less liberal
than some others."
Political Science Prof Morris Fiorina is
a Hoover Institution Senior Fellow who
supports Representative Ron Paul (R
lexas).
"As a registered Libertarian since the

late 1970s 1 hope that next year at this time
1 am say that I am one of fewer than
400,(XX) Americans who had the good
sense to vote twice for Ron Paul for presi
dent" Fiorina said. 'Why? Because Liber
tarians stand for individual freedom, in
contrast to the other parties which are all
statist in their own way."
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and for
mer Massachusetts governor Mitt Rom
ney have proven to be popular Republican
candidates among conservative Stanford
faculty, each locking in about 10 percent of
total presidential contributions from Uni
versity affiliates. Meanwhile, former
Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, an
other national frontrunner, had no fiscal
support from Stanford affiliates as of Oct.
29, in line with national trends that rank
him dead last among major candidates in
academic contributions.
Stanford is not alone in its politiail ac
tivism or in its liberal leanings. Academia
ranked eighth among industry donors in
the 2004 election cycle and ranked 12th
this campaign season, ahead of such
heavyweights as oil.gas ;ind pharmaceuti
cals. Seventy-six percent of the education
industry's federal contributions this cycle
have gone to Democratic candidates.
Obama has received just over $2.1 mil
lion in contributions from academia, while
Clinton received $1.6 million. Of the Re
publics candidates, only Romney broke
the $5(X),000 mark.
Academia was not always so influen
tial. A decade ago. total aimpaign contri
butions from universities hovered around

$7 million per election cycle.That changed
in 2(XX), when contributions more than
doubled to $17 million. In 2004, contribu
tions from academia more than doubled
again,coming in at $38 million.
That year. University of California sys
tem affiliates contributed more to the cam
paign of Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) than
any other single employer nationally, do
nating more than double the amount given
by Kerry's largest corporate donor.
In an interview hist August, Luke Rosi
ak, a CRP researcher, suggested that wide
spread opposition to President George W.
Bush hits galvanized political activism
among academics
"The amount of money people [in gen
eral] are spending to influence politics has
certainly increased over time, but there's
definitely something else going on here,"
Rosiak said."You don't need to be an ex
pen in campaign finance to see that there
was an astronomical jump in politiail giv
ing among academics in 2004."
After all. college campuses have long
