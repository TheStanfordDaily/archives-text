GAME NOTES: Arizona State's five game win
ning streak was snapped last night after a
loss to No. 8 California. Freshman forward
Kayla Pedersen matched her season high
with 22 points against Arizona Thursday
night. Sophomore center Jayne Appel leads
the Pac-10 in blocked shots with 37.

players reached double figures.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins went 8-for-18for
19 points, and sophomore guard J.J. Hones and
junior forward Morgan Clyburn came off the
bench to score II and 10 points, respectively.
Hones was 3-for-5 from behind the arc. and also
had a team-high six assists and two steals.
The Cardinal offense was nothing short of ex
traordinary: Stanford shot a remarkable 60.7 per
cent for the game, including 44.4 percent shooting
from three-point range. On defense, the Cardinal
held the Wildcats to a poor 37.3 shooting clip.
Ashley Whisonant led the Wildcats (6-11,0-6)
with 17 points and four assists.Tara Dickey shot 3-
for-4 from three-point range, adding 14 points for
Arizona. Ify Ibekwe had nine rebounds off the

bench for the Wildcats, but. like so many of her
teammates, had little success from the field; she
went 2-for-8.
Both teams struggled with ball control: Stan
ford had an uncharacteristic 12 turnovers, al
though Arizona had 15 of their own. But that was
the only blemish on the Cardinal's night: the team
led in nearly every statistical category, and had lit

tie problem dispensing of the Wildcats.
Wiggins'jumper just over four minutes into the
game put the Cardinal up 8-6, and Stanford never
looked back. By halftime, they were leading 43-30.
A Wildcat comeback attempt midway through the
second half cut Stanford's lead to 14. but two quick

inside baskets stopped Arizona's
surge and cemented the Cardinal
victory.
With the win, Stanford extended
its winning streak to three games
and seems to have recovered from
unexpected back-to-back losses to
UCLA and USC in the first week
end of the new year. Arizona re
mained winless in Pac-10 play.
Stanford continues its trip
through the desert on Sunday
against No. 25 Arizona State, a more
formidable opponent than their in
state counterparts. The Sun Devils
(11-6. 5-1). were riding a five-game
winning streak before tonight's loss
to No. 8 California.
ASU has a balanced offensive at
tack which shoots 44.1 percent from
the field and averages nearly 67
points per contest. Forward Lauren
Lacey and guard Briann January
lead the Sun Devils at 12.6 and 11.8
points per game, respectively. Lacey
also leads ASU in rebounding, while

January is the team leader in assists
and steals.
The Cardinal, who has towered
over some of its previous opponents,
will have no significant size advan
tage over ASU. Pedersen and Appel
both stand at 6-foot-4 inches, hut the
two ASU post starters. Lacey and
center Sybil Dotsy, measure in at 6-
foot-3 inches. Occasional starter
Kirsten Thompson, who stands at 6-
foot-6 inches, will be the tallest play
er on the court.
But none of the Sun Devils have
the defensive presence of Appel. and
both the sophomore center and Ped
ersen are more efficient rebounders
and scorers than the ASU post play
ers.
The Cardinal may have to rely on
its forwards and centers again: while
Wiggins is one of the premier players
in women's basketball, she will be
matched up against January, one of
the most tenacious on-ball defend
ers in the Pac-10.
Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m.The
game will be broadcast live on Fox
Sports Net.
