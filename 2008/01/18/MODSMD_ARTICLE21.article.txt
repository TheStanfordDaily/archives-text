## Wrestling to begin Pac-10 season tonight in Davis 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Following a busy winter break
schedule that saw Stanford wrestling
compete in five dual matches on the
East Coast, the Cardinal is finally
ready to start its conference schedule
tonight with a pair of road meets in
Davis, Calif.
At 5:00 p.m., Stanford (6-1) opens

its Pac-10 season against a solid Boise
State (4-1,2-1 Pac-10) squad, featuring
five wrestlers ranked among the top
three in the Pac-10 at their respective
weight classes. In the second half of the
dual meet double-header, the Cardinal
will take on rival UC Davis (3-1, 1-1
Pac-10), who has traditionally been a
tough obstacle for Stanford to over
come. Last year, the Aggies triumphed
over the Cardinal, 29-12, while in 2006

the score was an even more lopsided
3S-6 in favor of Davis.
Still, third-year head coach Kerry
McCoy's squad is off to a fine start it
self. The Cardinal came close to a five
meet sweep on their recent road trip,
losing just one dual,2l-l6at Lehigh.
"'lhe trip was a little bit disappoint
ing because we wanted to go undefeat
ed â€” we wanted to win all our duals,"
McCoy said. "But to go 4-1 under the

circumstances was a pretty good show
ing.The guys kept up. fought adversity,
so they did a good job. I think that was
really a turning point for the team to
realize that, okay, we can do hard stuff,
and now getting ready for the Pac-10
season they're ready to go out and
prove that we are one of the top teams
in the conference."
Senior captain, heavyweight Phil
Doerner, was optimistic that the close
loss against the Mountain Hawks
could wind up serving the Cardinal
well for the experience down the road.
"I think our match with Lehigh is
going to help us out," he said. "Just be
cause it was so close, and we really
hadn't been in any close matches yet
this year. And now we've been there
before, so next time should turn out
even better."
"It kind of got us going back into
our dual season," sophomore Zack
Giesen, 184 pounds, added. "Even
having five dual meets in a row there
kind of changed the mentality a little
bit, got the mats back under every
body. We saw some easier opponents
and some tougher teams, so it kind of
prepared everybody and got every
body back into the mode."
Still, the focus now is on moving
ahead against two of the better teams
in the Pac-10. If the Cardinal is to suc
ceed tonight, the team will need con
tributions from some of its newer
standouts as well as its veteran stars.
One such young wrestler, sophomore
Jake Johnson, 197 pounds, hopes that
the squad's east coast matches will

give the team a solid morale boost
heading into its conference schedule.
"It was a trip in which we got a
whole bunch of victories, so I think
that gave us a lot of confidence which
will be good to have going into these
duals," Johnson said. "We wanted to
open up and take some risks and
those were the perfect matches to do
it. because they won't have much
bearing on the end of the year. But it
gave guys a chance to practice their
moves."
Johnson and fellow second-year
wrestler, redshirt freshman Lucas
Espericueta, 149/157 pounds, have
been welcome additions to the
team's lineup this season. Both have
notched 17 wins already in the still
young season.
"I've been feeling good," Johnson
said. "1 moved up weight classes so 1
stopped having to cut weight and I
think that really helped me. I've been
getting a lot of guys tired and winning
matches late, winning third period
matches and I think that's part of the
reason."
After tonight's action, the Cardinal
will take to the mats next Thursday
night at home against another Pac-10
rival, Cal State Bakersfield,before fac
ing Menlo and Portland State on Fri
day, also at home.
