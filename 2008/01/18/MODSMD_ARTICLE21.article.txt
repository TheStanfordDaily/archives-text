## Wrestling to begin Pac-10 season tonight in Davis 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Following a busy winter break
schedule that saw Stanford wrestling
compete in five dual matches on the
East Coast, the Cardinal is finally
ready to start its conference schedule
tonight with a pair of road meets in
Davis, Calif.
At 5:00 p.m., Stanford (6-1) opens

its Pac-10 season against a solid Boise
State (4-1,2-1 Pac-10) squad, featuring
five wrestlers ranked among the top
three in the Pac-10 at their respective
weight classes. In the second half of the
dual meet double-header, the Cardinal
will take on rival UC Davis (3-1, 1-1
Pac-10), who has traditionally been a
tough obstacle for Stanford to over
come. Last year, the Aggies triumphed
over the Cardinal, 29-12, while in 2006

the score was an even more lopsided
3S-6 in favor of Davis.
Still, third-year head coach Kerry
McCoy's squad is off to a fine start it
self. The Cardinal came close to a five
meet sweep on their recent road trip,
losing just one dual,2l-l6at Lehigh.
"'lhe trip was a little bit disappoint
ing because we wanted to go undefeat
ed â€” we wanted to win all our duals,"
McCoy said. "But to go 4-1 under the

circumstances was a pretty good show
ing.The guys kept up. fought adversity,
so they did a good job. I think that was
really a turning point for the team to
realize that, okay, we can do hard stuff,
and now getting ready for the Pac-10
season they're ready to go out and
prove that we are one of the top teams
in the conference."
