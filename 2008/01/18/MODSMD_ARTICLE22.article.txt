Akinradewo named best
player in the nation
Junior middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo was honored with the
Honda Sports Award yesterday,
given to the nation's top collegiate
female volleyball player.
Akinradewo — an integral part of a
Stanford squad that made it to the
NCAA Championship game for the
second year in a row — beat out
three other candidates for the award:
junior Christa Harmotto (Penn

State), sophomore Megan Hodge
(Penn State) and Asia Kaczor
(USC).
"When I found out 1 won the
award I was in Colorado Springs
training with the U.S. National Team,
and I felt quite undeserving, consid
ering that there were so many great
players all around me," Akinradewo
said to GoStanford.com."lt's always
an honor to be nominated for such a
prestigious award. It surprised me
last year, and this year as well."
Despite her humble words, the
junior certainly earned the award:
Akinradewo led the nation in hitting
percentage at .499, nearly setting an
NCAA record for hitting percentage
in a single season. She was also
named the AVCA Pac-10 Player of
the Year and had a career-best 26
kills in Stanford's win over USC in
semifinals of the NCAA Tourna
ment.
A junior majoring in Human Bi
ology, Akinradewo is the sixth Cardi

nal player to win the award. She will
now be in the running for the Colle
giate Woman Athlete of the Year
across all sports.
