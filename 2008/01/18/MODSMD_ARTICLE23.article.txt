# Cardinal to face USC, Pepperdine
## Men's Volleyball team to begin tough weekend series versus No. 11 Trojans and No. 2 Waves 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The No. 6 Stanford men's vol
leyball team has had a successful
season so far, with only one loss to
go with four wins. The sole defeat
was at the hands of a higher-ranked
team and two of the wins were over
the defending national champion.
UC Irvine. This weekend, though,
the competition will get tougher as
the Cardinal hosts the second
ranked team in the nation. Pepper
dine, on Saturday night.
Stanford's weekend starts
tonight with No. 11 USC (3-3, 2-1
MPSF) and then continues with
No. 2 Pepperdine (2-0,2-0) on Sat
urday. The Cardinal (4-1, 1-1)
comes into the weekend after a
sweep of UC Santa Cruz on Tues
day night. In that match,every play
er on the roster — except for fresh
man outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin who was resting due to
an ankle injury — saw significant
court time.
"In our league, a lot is about
serving and passing," head coach
John Kosty said of the keys to the
weekend's games. "We need to be
able to run our offense consistently.

especially against teams ranked
above us."
For the Cardinal to nab a win on
Saturday night against Pepperdine,
the team will not only need to exe
cute on offense, but will also face
the challenge of counteracting the
offensive firepower of Paul Carroll.
The AVCA National Player of the
Week, Carroll is averaging an as
tounding 6.7 kills per game for the
Waves.
"He is a very good, very big, left
handed hitter," Kosty said of Car
roll. "He has an ability, unlike most
players in our league, to really take
over a match. We will need to slow
him down and then take care of the
rest of the team."
Coming into tonight's match
with USC, Kosty again emphasized
the importance of the basics of the
game — serving and passing well.
"We need to a have a good serv
ing and passing match and 1 think
we are ready to have one," he said.
"I am looking forward to watching
this game and seeing us executing
well on that."

season at the UC Santa Barbara In-

vitational — the team beat Pacific in
four games and was then swept by
Long Beach State and Cal State
Northridge. In the opening weekend
of MPSF play, USC lost in four games
to Northridge and then swept Santa
Barbara, which was followed by its
sweep of Pacific on Wednesday.
Troy Murphy and Juan Figueroa
are the top hitters for the I'rojans —
Murphy leads the team with 72 kills
on the season. He also has the most
service aces (seven) and is tied with
Austin Zahn with a team-high 13
blocks.
"Troy Murphy is a six-foot-eight
freshman," Kosty said. "And Juan
Figueroa beat us last year. He is a
very good outside hitter, good on de
fense and a good passer. They will

definitely be key."
In three meetings last year, the
Trojans beat the Cardinal all three
times, twice in five games and once in
four. Figueroa was the top hitter in all
three matches, with 23 kills in each of
the five-gamers and 24 in the final
contest. He also had team highs in
digs in two matches.
Pepperdine comes to Stanford
this weekend with a pair of wins last
weekend over Santa Barbara and
Northridge. All-American junior
Carroll had 30 kills and hit over .500
in a four-game win over the Gauchos
and then posted 17 in a sweep of the
Matadors. He has a team-high six
aces and is second to Mark Hulse
with 10 blocks. Hulse leads with 13.
The Waves swept the Cardinal in
their first match last year and won in
four at the end of the season. The
2(X)5 NCAA champion, Pepperdine
advanced to the national semifinals
last year before losing to IPFW. In
the lastest poll, the Waves received

four of 15 first-place votes and are
ranked behind only Brigham Young.
After the Friday night match in
Maples, the Cardinal will be back in
the more intimate Burnham Pavilion
on Saturday.
ITiey are different environments
and each one offers its unique attrib
utes," Kosty said of the two pavilions.
"Maples is the bigger venue and we
may get bigger crowds when we play
there, and we have the scoreboard
and everything like that.
"Then when we go back to Burn
ham. it is a small and loud gym where
your fans are right on top of you. 1
like them both — they are both very
good volleyball venues."
Following this weekend's homes
tand.the Cardinal will be back on the
road next week before coming back
to campus for two weeks of home
play.
