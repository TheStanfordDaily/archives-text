the Warriors.The team will get things
going again today in lu)s Angeles at
the Sherwood Cup. hoping to get back
into the swing of things before the
dual season begins next week.
"I'm just looking for continued
improvement this weekend" head
coach John Whitlinger said."l want to
see how the guys do in match play, in
pressure situations. If they get in a
tight spot, how will they handle the
pressure?"
Stanford is ranked No. 42 in the
preseason team rankings, a 19-spot
jump from its ranking at the end of
last year. The Cardinal also has three
players ranked in the ITA top 1(X) sin
gles. led by two freshmen: Alex Clay
ton at No. 2 and Ted Kelly at No. 41.
Junior Matt Bruch is the other
ranked player at No. %. Stanford's
three ranked players are the most of
any team in the Pac-10.
Clayton began his fall career
ranked No. 111 but was 10-2 during

the fall season, including nine wins
against top- 1(H) opponents. Kelly had
a great fall season in doubles, winning
a tournament while paired with jun
ior Blake Muller and qualifying for
Indoor Nationals. He also had some
big singles victories in the same tour
nament. including one over then-No.
14 Pierre Mouillon from Cal.
"It feels really good to be ranked
so high being a freshman and not
even having the dual season start
yet," Clayton said. "I did very well in
the fall tournaments and it's nice to fi
nally see my ranking go from 111 to 2
in one jump."
Clayton and Bruch, the returning
Pac-10 singles and doubles champi
on. will not play this weekend. Stan
ford's only seeded singles player in
the draw is sophomore Richard Wire,
at sixth. Kelly and junior Blake
Muller are the third seed in doubles.
" Ibis weekend is a good chance to
get some more competitive matches
under my belt in both singles and
doubles," Kelly said. "It's a good
chance to start the season off on the
right foot and set the tone."
The Sherwood Cup is a three day
singles and doubles tournament that
will feature many of the best players
in the West. The tournament is espe
cially important because starting next

week, the first dual matches begin for
the Cardinal. And the team's opening
schedule is nothing less than daunt
ing: matches against No. 2 Georgia,
No. 23 llilsa. No. 9 UCLA and No. 6
USC await. The players know the
challenges that lay before them and
are excited to play these matches so
early in the season.
"The goal of [the Sherwood Cup]
is to gain confidence and get match
play under our belts," said Muller.
"Coach jWhitlinger] wants to see
what we can do and if we can play up
to our abilities."
Muller added that this tourna
ment is still just a tune-up for what is
ahead.
"[The tournament] will help us
prepare for the dual season," he said.
"We want to be a tough team that
competes hard."
Hie doubles lineups will be com
posed of the following duos: Muller
and Kelly, junior Jeff Teller and soph
omore Paul Morrissey, sophomore
