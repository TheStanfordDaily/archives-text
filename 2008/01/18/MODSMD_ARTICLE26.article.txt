## How 'bout them apples? 
### Matt Bush INTERMISSION JOHNNY APPLESEED 
Most of you are probably familiar with the craze that is Ap
ples to Apples, a board game of intelligent, ironic and down
right outrageous comparisons of famous people, places and
events. It's got to be the only game I know that can range from
intelligent deliberation over politicians and war, to a sarcastic
smackdown between your favorite heroes and cities, to a
that's-so-wrong-it's-funny game (which usually involves the
Helen Keller card).
Apples to Apples requires three or more people to play,
and includes two giant decks of word cards. Each person keeps
five red apple cards, or noun cards, in their hand. On your turn,
you draw a green apple card, or adjective card, and show it to
everyone, so that they can each pick a noun card from their
hand that they think best applies to the adjective, literally, hu
morously or otherwise. You shuffle the noun cards and then
read them out. picking the best fit for your adjective card. The
person who put that card down reveals himself, earning a point
and keeping your adjective card as a trophy.
The game's definitely a hoot, but many of us aren't all that
informed or opinionated about every single celebrity, histori
cal figure and event in the deck. It's safe to say that we'd
rather be giggling and guffawing over our own ex- c

ences at Stanford, and the famous and infamous people and
places on campus. Besides, the limited number of write-in
your-own cards in Apples to Apples can't possibly accommo
date the vast numbers of hilarious comparisons and analyses
we can make about the things around us at Stanford.
So instead, let's imagine a game called Trees to Trees (for
lack of a more catchy plant word associated with Stanford), a
Stanford version of Apples to Apples. So it's your turn, and for
your adjective, you draw the infamous "Awkward" card, one
of the most overused but just-so-useful college-isms in your vo
cabulary Your friends put down their noun cards and you read
them aloud one by one: "Black Squirrels." They're pretty
creepy. "Random Facebook Friend Requests." People who
claim they know you, or just are lonely and want attention, are
definitely awkward. "The Roundabout." Getting in near bike
accidents with people who go the wrong way, and the forced
apologies that follow, sure can be awkward. But the last card,
"dormcest," is by far the most awkward.
The next person gets the card "Disgusting," and has to
choose between "shared bathrooms," iHUM kids," "OSA
policies and "dining hall leftovers." While those bathrooms

can get pretty bad during the weekend, what with parties
and absence of cleaning staff, dining hall leftovers take

the prize: that chicken and those mixed vegetables

were definitely yesterday's entrees, and the dinner

soup's been sitting in the warmer since lunch!

The next player draws the "Sketchy" card

— another trademark college-ism — and has
to choose between "Dance instructors,"

"grad students," "housing inspectors" and
"frat boys." Frat boys have a certain reputa-

tion, but grad students just helplessly, natu
rally exude sketchiness with their mere
presence at undergrad parties. Especially

when they tell you their age.
And then someone draws "Dirty," and has to
decide whether "earth science majors," "Full

Main on the Quad," "coops," or
"Roxy Sass" best fit the mold. Dear old
Roxy transcends dirtiness in every sense of the word, and earth sci
ence majors are a bit too literal to be an entertaining choice, so it's be
tween co-ops and FMOTQ. Co-ops may be filled with archetypal
hippies, but at least they take showers and wash their dishes like any
other dorms, so let's go with Full Moon, which is just out of this world.
The guy next to you gets "sexy" as his adjective, and is of
fered "Dean Julie," "Exotic Erotic," "good grammar," and
"RAs." As sexy as most of your RAs are, it's not a good idea
to tempt them with seductive compliments, and Exotic Erotic
is so, well, exotic and erotic that 'sexy' just doesn't fit it. Good
grammar is hot, especially if you extend sexy to just mean "aes
thetically pleasing." but ultimately, 1 think we all love Dean
Julie and her motivational speeches and class-year calls
enough (as well as putting up with "show us your tits!" during
Gaieties 2006) to give her the 'sexy' award.
It's your turn again, and you get to pick who or what is the
most "proud. " How endearing. Your friends make you choose
between "freshmen," "the Band," "your parents," and "Admit
Weekend." Admit Weekend is pretty insane, what with bright
eyed ProFros and the all-too-rare dorm cheer coming from a
crowd of 100-plus people. Freshmen and the Band also have
their particular ways of expressing their Stanford pride, but
hopefully in your case, it's your parents that are the most proud
of you and of Stanford (especially when you get that high-pay
ing career that'll supplement their retirement plans).
I bet you're just dying to hear more combinations and com
parisons, and eager to make these nerve-wracking decisions on
your own. What other game would provide an outlet for your
school pride, sorrow (for the association of "the CoHo" with
"missed ), and frustration towards IHUM and dining halls
that you've been keeping in since freshman year? Someone
better come up with a real-life version of Trees to Trees —
hopefully with a more inventive name — you could make a
fortune.
