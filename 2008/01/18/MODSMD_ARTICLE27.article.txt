# The
						Crying Game
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION WEEPER 
It's around 1 1 p.m., probably too late to hit the sauce if you
haven't started. What are you and three to five of your closest
friends going to do? You want to play the crying game. Take
that moment of boredom and transform it into a socially cas
trating test of emotional control.
What the hell is the crying game? I'm not talking about the
movie, or the song— I'm talking about the actual game. The
original idea came from McSweeney's DVD magazine "Whol
phin," and it's really quite simple: Sit around a table with a few
other people (two is awkward, more than six is near impossi
ble) and the first person to put an actual tear on the table wins.
It has to actually hit the table, and no, you can't use your hand
to transfer it. That little lugubrious bead of victory has to roll all
the way off your face.
While this could all be dismissed as a neo-emo exercise in

self-loathing
and general
melancholy,
once you actu
ally sit down to
give it a go,
many interest-

ing tendencies become apparent about the people with whom
you are playing. There is a vast spectrum of strategics, each
catering to the strengths and weaknesses of individual players.
For example, a strategy of visual people is to throw their
hands over their eyes and rock back and forth, retreating into
the gloomiest recesses of their minds. Some will also moan
slightly. Store this in appropriate ridicule banks for later use.
These people, when fully drawn into that inner unhappy place,
conjure up obscure, heartbreaking images of historical
tragedies, visions of family members meeting various and un
pleasant ends, as well as worst-case scenarios involving gin, tai
chi and more than a few surgical clamps.
Still others will open their eyes as wide as possible and hope
that not blinking will do the trick. This is an amateur mistake,
although it is particularly haunting to look into someone's eyes
as they plumb the depths of their emotionally constipated souls
for anything sad enough to push them over the edge. These are
the same people who are also pinching themselves under the
table.
A few players will claim that in the build up to an actual
round they came fairly close to breaking down, but once the
pressure was on, all teary tendencies went MIA. This is fairly
common, especially because few people realize how hard it is
to jump over that boo-hoo barrier on purpose.
During my first round of the Crying Game (or CG. to pros)

over winter break, an ex-football player friend from home de
veloped a devastating strategy: He laughed so hard he cried.
It's brilliant for several reasons. Not only did he avoid being to
tally emasculated by getting all weepy in mixed company, but
his incessant blue-in-the-face chortles completely took every
one else out of the game. Who can legitimately cry when faced
with some chucklehead's epic twitters?
If you go for a few rounds, experiment with different music.
Alter really going with the lamest emo music you can find for a
while — and trust me, it gets old — dig deep into those iTunes
archives. What really awakens that emotionally tender side of
you? I can tell you nothing makes me feel like a sentimental
fawn like some Alanis Morissette circa "Jagged Little Pill."
Ironic, I know. For an extra challenge, throw on 50-Cent or
"The Crying Game" by Boy George.
The crying game can be a profound experience in a very hu
manizing way. The whole episode (short of guffawing the tears
out) can cut through a lot of emotional veneers that people con
struct around themselves in social situations. There's the initial
ready, go, followed by a few inevitable rounds of giggles, but
once people really hunker down and get to it, things get inter
esting quickly.
But be sure to exercise caution. Prompting guests to conjure
up macabre images of drunken surgical clamping can really kill
the mood.
