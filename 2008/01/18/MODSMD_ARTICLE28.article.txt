## Haute Cuisine at Bistro Maxine 
### 
By JANET KIM and RUTH McCANN
INTERMISSION FRENCH TARTS
The word "bistro" (according to the omniscient Wikipedia)
is derived from a Russian word meaning "quickly." The word
became part ol' the French vocabulary after Napoleon made a
few bad decisions and broad-shouldered Slavic fellows could be
seen kicking their snow-proof boots onto Parisian cafe tables
everywhere. Slavs are a demanding people: They wanted their
food quickly, and lots of it. Hence the birth of bistros, or casual
neighborhood restaurants where Frenchmen can quickly grab
quality food and alcohol before resuming the arduous business
of smoking cigarettes and making snooty comments all day.
What caused us to go to Bistro Maxine on a cold night last
week was the expectation of quickness. You may think that
food reviewers for a student magazine have life easy; you may
think that nothing difficult or trying ever plagues our daily
Daily lives (ha). Au contraire, mon petit squirrel: On the partic
ular evening we made our trip to downtown Palo Alto, we had
been engaged in a truly difficult exchange over the relative mer
its of a privatized education system and/or unbridled capitalism.
Typical of most successful
efforts to share
opposing
view

points in thd*Stanford Bubble, our "discussion" involved a great
deal of tasteful foot stomping and pouting and ad hominem at
tacks. When Janet drew a switchblade, we finally decided it was
time to take a wee break for food.
Maxine specializes in crepes, so we expected to allot about
15 minutes to the devouring of our meals. This is not because
crepes are an indelicate food that can be gulped down without
being savored, but because we are red-blooded Americans, and
we thus assumed that the subtleties of crepe design, like the im
portance of existential philosophy, would most likely be lost on
us.
We were very wrong. Dinner ended up taking more than an
hour of our precious undergraduate homework/whisky time.
And not because we ordered elaborate French dishes demand
ing fresh-picked truffles from Normandy: Our dinner order
consisted of a single crepe and a croque-monsieur, a type of hot
ham-and-cheese sandwich native to the land of le Francais.
The 45-minute wait was not as bad as it could have been for
a few reasons. First, the ambiance. We usually hate that word,
especially when used by twenty-somethings with very little aes
thetic experience under their belts, but when we speak of Bistro
Maxine's good taste, we're not speaking about the fake candles
on all of the tables, or even the quaint furniture and gourmet
bottled drinks dotting the tiny space with authentic
Essence of Europe. We managed, luckily, to ignore
the strangely loud elevator music and focus on
the most important part of Maxine's charm,
which is its clientele: respectable-looking
middle-aged denizens of Palo Alto with
thick French accents, and thirty
something neighborhood regulars
who come to the tiny creperie
with well-behaved but quirky
children in tow. One little girl
tucked her doggie bag into
the front of her coat and
told us she was pregnant.
Turns out we miss that
kind of small-town
charm in the emotional
desert of University
life. (In an effort to
preserve the anti-col
legiate charm, Max
ine disallows the use
of laptops in the cafe.
Just a heads-up for
that hungry college
student looking for
an A&P alternative.)
The less subjec
tive part of Maxine's
charm lies in its excel
lent hot chocolate,
which is served in a large
bowl with a spoon. It's
not that the consistency of
the chocolate demands
spoon-eating — while it's
thicker than the typical Star
bucks cup of hot cocoa, it's not
exactly hot molten choco-lava —
but the sheer size of the bowl and
the small mountain of whipped cream
served atop the drink mean a lot of fun

mixing action can happen with the spoon. For the adventurous,
we recommend the Mexican ho-cho, which is una fiesta para la
boca. And given the drink's modest price, it's our number one
recommendation for the starving student.
The open kitchen — the dining area and the kitchen are
only separated by a low counter — made for good theater on
the particular evening we visited Maxine. The crepe-draper,
who seemed to be having problems with getting the tempera
ture of the griddle right, would dramatically slide his spatula
under the setting crepe batter, only to find that the crepe ripped
in half when he applied pressure to flip the crepe. The an
guished sighs of the chef did help us wait without thinking we
were being snubbed for being college-aged know-it-alls with a
flair for snarky food reviews, but after a few flopped starts, we
started becoming a little antsy. So, too. did the French couple
seated next to us, as they started grumbling in low, sonorous
French. "A leettle slow today, yes?" asked the gentleman of the
waitress as she refilled his glass for the fifth time. (To her cred
it, the waitress politely apologized for the delay and explained
that the griddle temperature was being challenging, and that the
chef was making every effort to correct the problem.)
But the fact that all four tables stayed for the long wait is a
testament to the quality of Maxine's food. The menu showcas
es sweet and savory crepes, as well as the aforementioned
croque-monsieur and croque-madame (a croque-monsieur
with a fried egg atop it) and a selection of French coffees, wines
and ciders. The food is well-prepared and served simply, but
even the side dishes are taken seriously: A small side salad light
ly tossed with a beautiful balsamic vinaigrette accompanied the
savory crepes, while the sweet crepes were served with gener
ous dollops of cream whipped on the premises.
Sweet crepes range from the simple combination of jam and
butter to the exotically continental: Maxine offers crepes with
chestnut purees, crepes drenched in orange and lemon juice,
and even crepes with liquor-based fillings. While we didn't have
the chance to sample all of the crepes on the menu, the Suzette
(the crepe wet with citrus juices mentioned earlier) and the
Beurre Sucre, a simple crepe with just butter and sugar, were
both delicious and faithful to their ingredients. The sweet
crepes are crisp and thin without being brittle.
The savory crepes are thicker in order to support more sub
stantial fillings, and are folded in a broad rectangular slabs. Our
only complaint is that the amount of brie used in brie-ish crepes
is tragically small and an insult to La Belle France. Otherwise,
they are parfait. The array of savory crepes involves various
combinations of meat, cheese and veg, all tastefully thrown to
gether. They make for a filling-enough dinner for those who are
not famished. The crepes are priced comparably to the next
door Coupa Cafe's crepes — about $8 for crepe + side dishes.
The much-awaited croque-monsieur turns out to be a sinful pile
of Gruyere cheese on top of a ham sandwich, which is actually
much tastier than it sounds, but not adventurous in the least. It's
the kind of kindergarten lunch fare that is perhaps best saved
for days on which the soul is famished from unnecessary de
bates on academia and capitalism.
So try it. That is our much-awaited conclusion. We've never
reviewed a French establishment before, so now that we've got
the attention of the French, we'd like to take this opportunity to
congratulate Sarkozy on bedding that foxy Carla Bruni. I ley
hey, Nicolas. Hey hey.
