### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS 
OFFICIAL STANFORDOPOLY(r) RULES
OBJECT:
The object of the game is to maintain a veneer of relaxation and
cool as your mind gradually vibrates itself into numbness. Also:
California girls!
EQUIPMENT:
The equipment consists of a six-sided die, 8183-acre board (find a
big table!). some of the brightest intellects of their generation and
all your parents' money. Additionally, we provide six pewter to
kens: a sorority girl, a grad student, a guy carrying his skateboard
up a hill, a hippie, a premed erotically choking herself and a little
Scottie dog.
PLAY:
All players begin with $38,400. administered by the bank. This is
the seed of the capital you will use to purchase property and utili
ties. thereby winning the game.
As soon as you place your token on the "ADMISSION" square,
give $38.4(X) of your money back to the bank. You are now a stu
dent!

Now, roll the die and move left, in the direction of the arrow
(Note: if you are an Econ student, move right). If you land on a
square containing a house and your draw number is low enough,
congratulations — you have a place to live. If your draw number
is high, hoo boy — looks like you're living in the Crothers base
ment, dickwad.
If you land on 'CHANCE" or "SPEC lAL FEES." pick a card.
This is where the magic happens: will you be hit on by a I A? Win
an intramural game? (Jet mocked in the Chappie? Don't worry
— no one cares. There is, however, always a possibility that the
card you draw will have monetary consequences. Maybe you mug
an old lady, or mug a freshman or Midwestern tourist — the pos
sibilities are endless! No matter where your windfall comes from,
know that it will allow you to buy nearly a quarter of your text
books. Alternately, Green Library (not pictured) has your mate
rials available for convenient 10-minute intervals on Tuesdays
from 3 to 4 p.m.
Once you make a full circuit (and hopefully learn something
about friendship and real estate along the way!), just pay your
$38,4(X) again and start over, poorer and inexplicably stricken
with focal dystonia in the lips, just like in real life. That is. after all.
ultimately the purpose of Stanfordopoly — to provide a realistic
portrayal of the outside world, so you don't ever have to leave.
