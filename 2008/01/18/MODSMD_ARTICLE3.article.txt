### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
California, long accustomed to
being an ATM for presidential can
didates looking to raise money,
could play an important role in es
tablishing the Democratic nominee
when voters here cast their ballots
on Feb. 5.
Yesterday, in fact, all three major
Democratic candidates took a
break from campaigning in neigh
boring Nevada, which holds its cau
cuses on Saturday, to make a pit
stop in the Golden State.
Sen. Barack Obama (13-111.)
spoke with single mothers in San
Francisco and held a fundraiser in
Atherton. At the same time, Sen.
Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) swung
through Southern California, talk
ing about the economy in Santa
Barbara and race issues in Comp
ton. Former North Carolina Sen.
John Edwards was in Los Angeles.
Yesterday's visits are probably
not the last. With 18 days until
SuperHiesday, in an unusually lluid
race, campaigns are targeting the
nation's most populous state by
sending candidates, opening field
offices and buying airtime.
An Obama office opened Sun
day on El Camino Real in Palo
Alto, next to Happy Donuts. For

Monday, the Clinton campaign has
planned a rally to open an office on
San Antonio Road, also in Palo
Alto.
Twenty-one other states vote on
Feb. 5 in the Democratic race. The
size of the electorate renders retail
campaigning strategies, used in
lowa and New 1 lampshire, unfeasi

"'lTie appearances are going to
be dwarfed later on by a series of
advertising buys," said Communi
cation Prof. Shanto Iyengar, who
teaches campaign analysis. "This
state is simply too big for people to
make personal appearances and
win on that model.There's no time."
The flurry of activity creates
openings for more Stanford stu
dents to get involved. Assuming the
race will stay competitive through
the first lUesday in February, the
extra attention also seems likely to
increase turnout, analysts say, espe
cially among passionate younger
voters who are upset about the di
rection the country has taken under
President George W. Bush and ex
cited about the prospect of change.
In a Los Angeles Times poll re
leased this week, Clinton leads
Obama by 16 points among likely
California Democratic voters. She
