# Candidates flock to California before Feb. 5 primaries
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
California, long accustomed to
being an ATM for presidential can
didates looking to raise money,
could play an important role in es
tablishing the Democratic nominee
when voters here cast their ballots
on Feb. 5.
Yesterday, in fact, all three major
Democratic candidates took a
break from campaigning in neigh
boring Nevada, which holds its cau
cuses on Saturday, to make a pit
stop in the Golden State.
Sen. Barack Obama (13-111.)
spoke with single mothers in San
Francisco and held a fundraiser in
Atherton. At the same time, Sen.
Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) swung
through Southern California, talk
ing about the economy in Santa
Barbara and race issues in Comp
ton. Former North Carolina Sen.
John Edwards was in Los Angeles.
Yesterday's visits are probably
not the last. With 18 days until
SuperHiesday, in an unusually lluid
race, campaigns are targeting the
nation's most populous state by
sending candidates, opening field
offices and buying airtime.
An Obama office opened Sun
day on El Camino Real in Palo
Alto, next to Happy Donuts. For

Monday, the Clinton campaign has
planned a rally to open an office on
San Antonio Road, also in Palo
Alto.
Twenty-one other states vote on
Feb. 5 in the Democratic race. The
size of the electorate renders retail
campaigning strategies, used in
lowa and New 1 lampshire, unfeasi
ble.
"'lTie appearances are going to
be dwarfed later on by a series of
advertising buys," said Communi
cation Prof. Shanto Iyengar, who
teaches campaign analysis. "This
state is simply too big for people to
make personal appearances and
win on that model.There's no time."
The flurry of activity creates
openings for more Stanford stu
dents to get involved. Assuming the
race will stay competitive through
the first lUesday in February, the
extra attention also seems likely to
increase turnout, analysts say, espe
cially among passionate younger
voters who are upset about the di
rection the country has taken under
President George W. Bush and ex
cited about the prospect of change.
In a Los Angeles Times poll re
leased this week, Clinton leads
Obama by 16 points among likely
California Democratic voters. She
has deeper support from women.
Latinos — a critical voting bloc in the
primary — and leading Democratic
politicians around the state, including
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom,
Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez and
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Vil
laraigosa.
"Senator Clinton has a better or
ganizational network going for her, in
terms of endorsements and on the
ground,"said Ed Constantini, a Politi
cal Science Professor who studies Cal
ifornia politics and presidential nomi
nation contests at the UC-Davis —
where former President Bill Clinton
campaigned TUesday night (see ad
joining story).
Ilie legislature, with the support of
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, last
year moved the date of the primary up
from June so that California would
have a greater influence in the battle
for the White I louse. Since it's nearly
impossible to imagine the Republican
candidate winning the state's 53 elec
toral votes in November.it seems safe
to say that there will be little direct
campaigning in California during the
general election.
ITie Democrats allow independ
ents to vote in their primary here, but
the Republican Party blocks non-reg
istered Republicans from voting in its

California primary.
Bill Whalen.a fellow at the I loover
Institution who specializes in Califor
nia politics, guessed this would help
Obama, who tends to perform better
among younger, more independent
voters not as tied into the Democratic
Party establishment. It will likely hurt
Sen. John McCain (R-Ari/.), he said,
who has strong appeal to moderate
and crossover voters.
High turnout could benefit
Obama, according to Constantini.
who has not taken sides in the race.
Another factor to watch is absen
tee ballots, available for voters to send
in since Jan. 7. Whalen estimates that
40 to 50 percent of all voters could
mail in their choices before Election
Day. That might counteract momen
tum built up by a candidate who
scores decisive wins in Nevada on Sat
urday or the South Carolina Democ
ratic primary on Jan. 26.
Clinton and Obama will likely win
their respective home states on Feb. 5.
which makes California more impor
tant as a potential decider.
Delegates to the Democratic Na
tional Convention are divided up pro
portionally so Obama could still come
out strong if he loses the popular vote
statewide. An unexpected strong
showing by Edwards, running with 10
percent in this week's LA l imes poll
of California voters, could alter the
dynamic.
