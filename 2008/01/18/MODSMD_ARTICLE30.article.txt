## Love, Betrayal & Chicken: winter One Acts 
### BEN CASEMENT INTERMISSION ONE-ACT WONDER 
The Ram's Head Winter One Acts open tonight in Roble
Studio Theater, featuring three original plays written by Stan
ford students. Inevitably, one goes into student theater feeling
nervous that the work will be hopelessly amateurish, embar
rassing or just plain bad. Luckily, the cast takes the shows seri
ously, producing a night heavy on drama but with a dash of
humor.
The first one act is "Dinner Party," by Brandon Silberstein
'08 and directed by Val Sinckler '01. It revolves around two TV
personalities who are married to each other and who have
asked their producers to dinner in hopes of gaining more air
time. Next thing they know, two complete strangers walk in. sit
down at the dinner table and, as they gaze at their reflections in
the silverware, declare that they would like the cucumber
salad, please, and the chicken. A certain amount of hamming
ensues, as husband (Nathaniel Nelson 4 11) and wife (Lauren
Bell' 11) dash back and forth between the dining room and the
kitchen, blustering and saying things like, "My God!" But their
alarm has grounds, as it becomes clear that the cucumbers and
carrots for which their visitors ask may have had more uses
than simply as food, and careers may be at stake. The visitors
also have secrets of their own, and seem to urgently require a

chicken. Suffice to say that, by the end, the cops are involved
and everyone has their hands on their heads.
The second play —"How They Might Have Loved and
Flown" written by Lyndsay Vogel '10 and directed by Cassaun
dra Vergel '10 — opens with a teacher, with his back to the au
dience, barking good-natured banter at his class while students
stand and read the kind of naively earnest compositions many
people may have been guilty of in high school, but to which no
one admits. The action quickly spins itself into a love triangle:
Abigail (Roselyn Hallett '08) is caught between her two best
friends, one of whom she is dating, and the other of whom, in
conveniently, she loves. The former, Alex (Max Friedman '11),
is somewhere between chronically apologetic and oblivious,
staring dreamily up at the ceiling while he spews juvenile phi
losophy. Galen, his best friend (Brandon Silberstein '08)
sneakily steals Abigail when he's not looking. Silberstein is a
fascinatingly charismatic performer: Of short stature, he swag
gers around the stage in a manner reminiscent of A 1 Pacino, his
bunched shoulders and distinctive face making emphatic
points whenever he wants them to. Hallett, meanwhile, is not
well served by the role, which leaves her relatively passive be
tween two pyschologically complicated men, so look for her as
Lavinia in the Shakespeare Society production of "Titus An
dronicus" later this quarter.

The final show is "The Corner." written by William Von

Hoene '08 and directed by Val Sinckler '01. It is
more or less about what a Stanford student,
Dutch (Grant Newsome '10), finds when he goes
home to Chicago. His ex-girlfriend, Lauren (Na
talia Duong '10), alternately hates and loves him,

but mostly she hates him. Luckily, his friends still like him, and
the old lady at the local fast-food joint (Naomi Andebrhan *09)
is still there to dispense motherly advice. The opening scene is
a beautifully composed vision of blankets, pillows and a chair
strewn about the stage, cell phones variously beeping, ringing
and thumping hip-hop into the emptiness. The actors emerge,
and as their fluent dialogue skates back and forth, one can't
help but think that no generation but ours could sound so good
on the phone. Von Hoene has the idiom down perfectly, even
down to the catch-phrases we use as filler: "That shit was awk
ward," Dutch says after hanging up on Lauren. But the mo
mentum slackens in the second scene, returning only at the end
with a final confrontation between Dutch and Lauren which, as
the two mumble vengeful intimacies to each other beneath a
street lamp, veers perilously close to self-indulgent incoher
ence. The final scene, a dashboard chat between Dutch and
one of his friends, was drowned out by the soundtrack, but of
the three this plays is nevertheless the most subtle, and the
most mature.
Writing plays — not to mention producing them — is
tough, and the cast and crew deserve kudos for their guts in
putting this together.
