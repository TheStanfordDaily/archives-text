# Kate Nash is a Smash
## 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION MOUTHWASHER 
Kate Nash has already made waves in her native U.K. and with the
Jan. 8 release of her debut album "Made of Bricks" in the U.S., she is
making quite a splash across the pond, too.
The 20-year-old, auburn-haired, vintage-dress wearing singer-song
writer sounds like a cross between two fellow UK musicians. Lily Allen
and rapper-hip-hop artist The Streets. Nash plays jumpy chords on the
piano as she generally sings but sometimes speaks her quirky, often iron
ic, stream-of-conscious lyrics across indie-pop beats.
The girl is cute beyond belief and just as quirky as her music: a typi
cal Nash outfit includes a big butterfly belt, a floral thrift dress, red tights
and high colorful pumps. She is the girl next door meets the indie rock
er. and so far she is appealing to both crowds. Her single "Foundations"
reached the #2 spot on the UK charts, while her debut album reached the
#1 spot. The song made it to #39 on the U.S. Billboard 200.
Her stats are pretty good, especially since she has burst onto the indie
music scene in the last few months from seemingly nowhere. After get
ting rejected from theater school, she fell down a flight of stairs, broke
her foot, and decided to write songs during her recovery. After her first
paid music gig, she said she never considered another job again.
In a musical rags to riches story, Nash used Garageßand to record
herself singing and playing the guitar and piano. She uploaded her songs
onto MySpace. and started playing at larger venues as word spread
about the young singer from Harrow. England. Ere long, Lily Allen her
self listed Nash in her top eight on MySpace, pushing Nash fully into the
limelight of the indie-pop scene.
Like Allen, to whom Nash is inevitably compai ed, Nash is pop with a
bite — every song on "Made of Bricks" is labeled explicit. While some
of her profanity adds to her story-telling lyrics and slang-filled
urban appeal, at times it makes her sound, well, 20 years old.
On the slow, jazz-infused track, "Dickhead," three-fourths of
lyrics are the repeated lines, "Stop being a dickhead / Why you
being a dickhead for? / You're just f***ing up situations."
Similarly, in "Birds," a compelling modern ballad about two
young lovers reuniting at a train station, Nash articulates one
of the lover's feelings in the strangest chorus on the CD: "Birds
can fly so high and they can shit on your head / Yeah they can
almost fly into your eye and make you feel scared / But when
you look at them and you see they're beautiful, / That's how I
feel about you." I am not sure whether it is really sweet, or just
laughable and awkward. Or is that how love's supposed to be?
On other tracks. Nash's lyrics are endearingly specific and
eccentric. On "Merry Happy," which features Nash's signa
ture staccato piano and talking-singing, Nash sings, "Dancing
at discos, eating cheesc on toast / Yeah, you make me merry

make me very, very happy but you obviously, / you didn't want
to stick around." The poppy, boppy chorus of "do do da"s is
catchy and wonderfully saccharine for the wholly bitter song
about a jilted lover who proclaims in the last verse that she
"can't take back those hours / but I won t regret 'cause you can
grow flowers / from where dirt used to be."
Nash's two singles, "Foundations" and "Mouthwash," have
perhaps the most pop appeal on the album. Nash laments a be
leaguered relationship on "Foundations" which starts with
simple, alternating piano chords, and is soon joined by fast
paced drums and guitar. The chorus is addictively catchy, fea
turing a distinctive synth overlay, piano riffs and Nash's smart
consideration of her conflicted feelings on her relationship:
"My fingertips are holding onto the cracks in our foundations
/ And I know that I should let go, but I can't."
"Mouthwash" adds instruments one by one, until the song
builds to a full, Coldplay-esque finish. The lyrics start confi
dently, with "yes I'll still here and this is my mind / and al
though you try to infringe I you cannot confine." but take a
turn for the random in the chorus where Nash sings, "And 1
use mouthwash / Sometimes I floss / I've got family and I drink
cups of tea / I've got nostalgic pavements / I've got familiar

faces."
Nash's most mature, and calmest, track is "Nicest Thing,"
where Nash sings in low yearning tones about longing to be
loved. Nash's vocals are rife with feeling as a violins swells be
tween the hushed notes of a guitar and bass. The lyrics are ar
guably also the most well-considered, lacking the scattered un
predictability present in some of Nash's other songs. "Nicest
Things," is more collected and focused — one of those quieter
songs that will never receive radio air-tiine but is a surprise
gem on the album.
From pop, to jazz, to indie-rock. Nash is a versatile, talent
ed singcr-song-writer, who at her best pairs poignant relation
ship observations with witty, realistic truths of life's absurdi
ties. At her worst, she swears like sailor and speaks in non se
quitors over fast-paced drums and a choppy piano.
1 expect a lot because her good stuff is damn good.
But give her a few years, hell, give her 10 — the girl has got
the time. With some honed song-writing and more exploration
of her already unique sound, I think her welcoming in the U.S.
will be even warmer the next time around.

builds to a full, Coldplay-esque finish. The lyrics start confi
dently, with "yes I'll still here and this is my mind / and al
though you try to infringe I you cannot confine." but take a
turn for the random in the chorus where Nash sings, "And 1
use mouthwash / Sometimes I floss / I've got family and I drink
cups of tea / I've got nostalgic pavements / I've got familiar

faces."
Nash's most mature, and calmest, track is "Nicest Thing,"
where Nash sings in low yearning tones about longing to be
loved. Nash's vocals are rife with feeling as a violins swells be
tween the hushed notes of a guitar and bass. The lyrics are ar
guably also the most well-considered, lacking the scattered un
predictability present in some of Nash's other songs. "Nicest
Things," is more collected and focused — one of those quieter
songs that will never receive radio air-tiine but is a surprise
gem on the album.
From pop, to jazz, to indie-rock. Nash is a versatile, talent
ed singcr-song-writer, who at her best pairs poignant relation
ship observations with witty, realistic truths of life's absurdi
ties. At her worst, she swears like sailor and speaks in non se
quitors over fast-paced drums and a choppy piano.
1 expect a lot because her good stuff is damn good.
But give her a few years, hell, give her 10 — the girl has got
the time. With some honed song-writing and more exploration
of her already unique sound, I think her welcoming in the U.S.
will be even warmer the next time around.
