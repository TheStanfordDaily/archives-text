## Los Prisioneros will set you free 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION WARDEN 
The best games, in my mind, arc geography trivia games —
especially that one on the Internet where you guess the exact
spot of random places like Alavus. Finland. So, let's play one:
Grab a globe. Now, dust if off and point to the country that
gave us of some of the best music of the 1980s. Nope, not
there. Nope, wrong again. Definitely not there. Did you seri
ously just point to Brunei? Look farther south. Keep going.
Australia? Nope, this place is even further south. Wait, stop!
That's right: Chile!
Chile — the world's thinnest and most southern nation —

was home to the best band from the '80s that you've never of:
Los Prisioneros. The band's legacy is not only its musical cre
ativity, but also its role in opposition to Chile's notorious die-

tator Augusto Pinochet. Through the steady growth of

underground buzz, the band became the musical

touchstone for the anti-Pinochet movement,
and, eventually, the most popular tf&nd in

Chile.

In many ways, then, the band's story
Ls flatly contradictory to perceptions of

that period in musical history. While most
bands of the time were doing flying leg

splits (yeah, 1 see you. David
Lee Roth) or perfecting their

keytar skills. Los Prisioneros exist
ed within an entirely different con-

text. The New Wave movement in
England and America tends to be

viewed as frivolous and shallow — eyeliner, dance
music and neon colors. And, in many ways, this is a fair
interpretation. The era seemed to revel exclusively in
themes of sex. appearances and fun. The earnestness
of the hippie movement and the anger of punk had all
but faded. Even experimental bands like the Talking
Heads were arguably more focused on focused on
style. But unlike their English-speaking peers, Lx>s Pri
sioneros sang about immediate social and political is
sues such as the desperation of Chilean slums, the cru
elty of Chile's secret police and massive unemploy
ment.
Nonetheless, they channeled these issues
through, the musical language of the day: buzzing
synths, jangly guitars, echo effects, drum machines
and tense dub rhythms. Indeed, like their contem
poraries Duran Duran or The Cars, Los Pri
sioneros wanted to make you dance. At the same
time, however, they wanted to make you think.
One of their classics is entitled "El Baile de

Los que sobran." The song opens with a distinctly Arcade Fire
like vibe: the distant sound of dogs barking over acoustic gui
tars. The setting is established: a Chilean neighborhood as the
sun goes down. Then the story unfolds: Several friends are
walking down the street. "Another night of walking around,"
they sing in Spanish over lightly strummed acoustic guitars.
Another end of the month without a paycheck," they con
tinue. "This year the games ended ... the games... the 12
games . . Los Prisioneros refer to, well, 12 years of
school. Then, after some brief accordion, the stuttered
beat kicks in and Los Prisioneros take it home. They
lament years of false youthful dreams. Then the sad,
& unemployed truth: idealist youth leaving school be
hind and entering the adult world of disappointment.

This aspcct is universal. Within the contcxt of Chile, they
particularly lament the inequality of education and opportuni
ty among classes.
At times Los Prisioneros's style and approach don't quite
mesh with the American mainstream. But the fact that they
manage to find so much common ground with it and forge their
own Chilean identity in addition makes them a unique and valu
able asset to the history of rock. And a fun addition to any triv
ia game.
