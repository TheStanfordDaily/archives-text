## A 						Modern Domestic Fantasy 
### BRODIE JENKINS INTERMISSION BEWITCHING BAKER 
Last summer, on a whim, I decided to bake chocolate chip cookies. This be
havior in itself is not particularly noteworthy; I've been baking chocolate chip
cookies with some regularity since grade school. The combined effects of com-

forting routine, aromatherapy and delectable end result are hard

to beat. But this time I charted new territory by baking in high
heels. Nothing too stratospheric, but not your mother's Nine

West pumps either.

It was a relatively quiet evening in the fraternity house that
was my home for three months — I had the big industrial kitchen all
to myself. Ingredients assembled, I spooned the gooey mounds on

a buttered baking sheet. As soon as the essence of hot dough and
melting chocolate began making its voluptuous way through the
house, men started to appear out of nowhere, their heads pop- I
ping in like puppy dogs, sniffing the air.
"Whatcha bakin'?" they'd ask, their eyes wide, mouths )

salivating. 1
Several boys asked me if I baked often, and a few

more told me they thought it was awesome that I loved to
bake for the fun of it. They stood close to me and looked \
me up and down, asked me about myself, offered to wash
up my dishes. It seemed that I had, with just a few flicks of
the wrist, managed to charm a dozen men into complete sub-

mission.
I was flirting with a fantasy nearly all males hold dear the provoca- ,
tively flour-dusted dream woman who will feed him. take care of him
and keep him totally satisfied. And does this woman exist ? Absolutely
not! If any of these gentlemen really knew me (for the most part, our re-

lationships consisted of brushing past each other in the hallways

for a couple of weeks), they would know that I can

barely cook, have a room that resembles a jum-

ble sale in a third-world country and thor
oughly enjoy having my own way. But 1

played along for the fun of it.
Out came the cookies — and the results were spectacular: reasonably attractive
woman in high heels + tray of hot, mouth-watering confection = the proverbial Pied
Piper of men. They ate the cookies as if they were exotic delicacies, groaning in ec
stasy, licking their fingers, flattering me and proposing marriage. Now 1 call that
v a success.

It even took a while for the effects of my dressing up to wear off.
I had been marked. Boys I barely knew came to my door, inviting me to

parties or simply wanting to talk; they'd smile and wave, ask how I was
l doing, volunteer to carry things for me. Eventually, things did calm
down (and I must admit, 1 was a bit relieved), but I had discovered
J quite an amusing game.

' In a world where image is taken so seriously, it was refreshing
to play with my own so freely and noncommittally. As a confident,

hard-working woman at Stanford, I love that I have

the freedom to dress up and play with my own image,

whether it's athletic, ultra-feminine, academic, or
something else entirely. There are many facets

to all of our personalities; as students, we wear
so many hats on campus, moving between
| classes, jobs and social events. Take the op-

portunity to explore your character, throw
off old hats and sport new ones that inspire

you, and step outside of the ordinary

every once in a while.
Playing dress up doesn't

have to be something you do alone
in your room in front of a mirror.
Donning a new image out in the
open can be a wildly entertaining
(and even illuminating) experience.
Go ahead and have some fun! It may

j
be that all you need is a pair of

high heels.
