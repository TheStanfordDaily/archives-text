### AN LE NGUYEN 
Emily Cooper Ml did not anticipate spending
nearly $160 by her first weekend back from Winter
Break. But having just unpacked her luggage after
getting back to school. Cooper soon packed her bags
once again to hit the Tahoe slopes.

A Stanford tra-

dition, dorm snow

trips are generally
regarded as memo
rable, fun and occa-

sionally wild highlights of

the school i

year. Stan
ford stu-

dents seldom

realize, however, the i
economic impact of'
their wintry excur-

sions.

Dorm snow trips
contribute consider-

ably to the Tahoe economy,
bringing in thousands of

dollars in revenue each year for hotels, ski resorts,
local businesses and transportation companies. In ad
dition, students frequently spend hundreds of dollars
on winter wear and skiing/snowboarding equipment.
To ensure snow trip success, students like Ben Al
lanson 11, co-president of Donner, have to take on
the responsibility of finances. According to Allanson,
71 Donner residents traveled toTahoe this past week
end. each paying $45 to cover transportation and
lodging costs.
"We put aside a certain amount of dorm funds for
the ski trip." Allanson said. "(The $45 fee] was pretty
fair and reasonably priced. We kept pretty much to
budget so it really wasn't that bad."
