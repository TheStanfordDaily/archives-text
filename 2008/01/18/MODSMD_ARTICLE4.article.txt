## Students face spending avalanche Snow trips lighten student wallets, help drive Tahoe economy 
### AN LE NGUYEN 
Emily Cooper Ml did not anticipate spending
nearly $160 by her first weekend back from Winter
Break. But having just unpacked her luggage after
getting back to school. Cooper soon packed her bags
once again to hit the Tahoe slopes.

A Stanford tra-

dition, dorm snow

trips are generally
regarded as memo
rable, fun and occa-

sionally wild highlights of

the school i

year. Stan
ford stu-

dents seldom

realize, however, the i
economic impact of'
their wintry excur-

sions.

Dorm snow trips
contribute consider-

ably to the Tahoe economy,
bringing in thousands of

dollars in revenue each year for hotels, ski resorts,
local businesses and transportation companies. In ad
dition, students frequently spend hundreds of dollars
on winter wear and skiing/snowboarding equipment.
To ensure snow trip success, students like Ben Al
lanson 11, co-president of Donner, have to take on
the responsibility of finances. According to Allanson,
71 Donner residents traveled toTahoe this past week
end. each paying $45 to cover transportation and
lodging costs.
"We put aside a certain amount of dorm funds for
the ski trip." Allanson said. "(The $45 fee] was pretty
fair and reasonably priced. We kept pretty much to
budget so it really wasn't that bad."

Stanford dorms typically reserve a
certain amount of money from their
house fund to subsidize snow trip
costs, while the Office of Residential
Education collaborates to work out
expenditures. Afterwards, students
are usually charged a flat rate that
covers the remaining costs for trans
portation and lodging. Food is often
provided through Stanford Dining,
thus the amount that students spend
in Tahoe ultimately depends on ski
ing, snowboarding and other activi
ties.
Among the 71 residents on the
Donner trip, 26 chose to ski or snow
board at Heavenly. Ihis weekend,
FroSoCo has 76 residents skiing or
snowboarding at Heavenly as well.
According to Jacqueline Dory '11,
who helped manage FroSoCo's trip,
students were charged $51 for one
day lift tickets. $ l X) for two-day tickets
and $20 for rentals. Special packages
consisting of ski lessons, rentals and
lift tickets totaled $107 per person.
As a dorm. FroSoCo will be
spending more than $8,000 at Heav
enly. One of the most expensive re
sorts in Tahoe. I leavenly did. howev
er, give the dorm a $31 discount for
each lift-ticket.
Lift tickets and skis aren't the only
things needed to brave the Tahoe
slopes. For some Stanford students, it
requires a new wardrobe as well.
Larkin resident Stephanie Parkcr'll,
who is from Los Angeles,saw her first
snow last weekend. Because it was
her first time, though, she also had to
find the appropriate attire.
"I bought a jacket for $70. and
then I basically wore my own
clothes," said Parker, who also bor
rowed ski pants from her mother's
friend to avoid further adding to the
$50 dorm fee she spent on Larkin's

trip.
Beside the department stores
which make money selling winter ap
parel to Stanford students, other
Tahoe businesses also reap the profits
from snow seekers.
Kay Williams, resort manager at
Granlibakken, acknowledged that
college snow trips account for a sub
stantial amount of her .resort's rev
enue. Although Williams declined to
state how much Granlibakken actu
ally makes off of college students, she
did provide promising statistics about
students' spending on the Tahoe
economy.
"Ihis upcoming Martin Luther
King weekend, we have 30 rooms
that are rented for a group from Stan
ford," Williams said. "1 would say that
they're a good part of our recreation
dollars. We're close to quite a few col
leges — Chico, Sacramento State,
Sonoma. Some of the students com
ing are bound to be skiers [and]
mountain bikers."
While Tahoe businesses seem to
benefit from the influx of visitors
from nearby universities, it is ques
tionable whether the students them
selves have received a fair deal. Due
to the expensive costs of lift tickets
and ski rentals, some students opt to
remain in their warm cabins instead
of venturing out onto the slopes.
"I decided not to ski because I
thought that the rental costs were
rather expensive," said Donner resi
lient Alex Ji'l 1.
Nonetheless, the consensus
among Stanford students is that snow
trip is a worthwhile experience — in
spite of the price.
"I think it led to more dorm bond
ing," Allanson said. "In a way it was a
bad weekend to go because it was the
first week (after winter break], yet it
was good because it forced everyone
to settle back in and to get to know
each other again."
