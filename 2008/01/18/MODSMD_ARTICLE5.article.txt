# Stanford 56, Arizona 52
## CARD SLAMS CATS 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Before the season, Fred Washington
bet teammate Taj Finger that Washing
ton would shoot at least 80 percent from
the free throw line this year.
So far this season, Washington's not
anywhere close, but Finger may forgive
him.
With five seconds left in last night's
game and the Cardinal clinging to a two
point lead over Arizona, Washington
was fouled while rebounding a missed
jump shot by the Wildcats' Jerryd Bay
less. Washington, the fifth-year senior
forward, missed all six of his free throw
attempts last Sunday in a close loss to
Oregon, and teammates senior forward
Finger and junior guard Anthony

GAME NOTES: Stanford beat Arizona for the first
time in its last six tries Thursday night. Sopho
more forward Brook Lopez, who leads the Car
dinal in scoring with 17 points per game, scored
19 points against Arizona and was the only
Stanford player to reach double digits. Arizona
State is coming off a thrilling, double overtime
99-90 victory over Colifomia.


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore center Brook Lopez goes up against Arizona forward Jordan
Hill. Lopez led all scorers with 19 points, and added five blocks for the
Cardinal. Hill led the Wildcats with eight rebounds and added 11 points.
Goods had already missed crucial at
tempts in previous minutes against
Arizona.
Shooting one-and-one, Washing
ton stepped to the line as a nervous
hush fell over the Maples Pavilion
faithful.
He sunk them both.
With the free throws sealing the
deal, Stanford escaped against Ari
zona, 56-52, Thursday night. It was an
other ugly win for the Cardinal (14-3,

3-2 Pac-10) but it gave Stanford its
first victory over the Wildcats since
January 2005.
"I think I'm going to make them
every time," said Washington, who is
shooting just under 52 percent from
the free throw stripe this season.
But making these ones?
"It's nice," he said.
"He had better made them," coach
Trent Johnson said.
On the offensive end, it was a tale

of two halves. Stanford shot a sizzling
63 percent in the opening stanza, be
fore coming down to earth in the sec
ond period with a 7-for-26 (26.9 per
cent) performance from the field.
Once again, the key was defense.
Arizona (11-6, 1-3) came into the
contest averaging 74.2 points per
game, but was held to 52 points on
21-for-56 shooting (37.5 percent).
Wildcat stars Bayless, the freshman
guard, and sophomore swingman

Chase Budinger combined for just 22
points on 8-for-30 shooting from the
field, well below their respective
scoring averages of 19.7 and 17.1. re
spectively.
"We gotta get stops," Johnson said
of his team's philosophy when the of
fense is struggling. "As long as we take
good shots, shooting with confidence
and moving within the framework of
what we're trying to do offensively. I
can live with that. On the other [de
fensive] end, that's where you pick
yourself up."
Stanford went to the post early and
often, with seven-foot sophomore
center Brook Lopez scoring at will
against a smaller Arizona front line.
Lopez finished the game with 19
points to lead all scorers, adding six re
bounds and five blocks.
Riding Lopez inside. Stanford
made a 12-3 run starting midway
through the opening period, taking its
largest lead of the game, 26-14. with
6:25 left before halftime. Despite slop
py play, which resulted in nine
turnovers, the Cardinal finished the
half up 33-26.
But any team as talented as Ari
zona is going to make a run, and that
the Wildcats did. Capitalizing on Stan
ford turnovers and missed shots, Ari
zona outscored the Cardinal 17-4 to
take a three-point lead with 10 min
utes to go in the second frame.
"We hit a stretch when things
weren't working and we had to lock
down," Washington said. "Some
teams would have folded under that
type of comeback — Arizona's a
good team. But we didn't, we bounced
back."
A Taj Finger put-back after two of
fensive rebounds put Stanford up two
with four and half minutes to go. Both
teams traded misses and turnovers
until Arizona big man Jordan Hill hit
a jumper with 2:17 left to tie the game
at 52.
Then, Brook Lopez, after missing a
critical shot in the final minutes dur
ing Sunday's loss to Oregon, made a
baseline jumper with 1:55 to play to
give the Cardinal the lead for good.
Next for Stanford is No. 22 Ari
zona State, fresh off a 99-90 double
overtime thriller at Cal Thursday
night. The Sun Devils are averaging
more than 70 points per game, and
will provide another test for the stal
wart Stanford defense.
"This winning ugly is getting old,"
Johnson said."But it's winning."

Stanford went to the post early and
often, with seven-foot sophomore
center Brook Lopez scoring at will
against a smaller Arizona front line.
Lopez finished the game with 19
points to lead all scorers, adding six re
bounds and five blocks.
Riding Lopez inside. Stanford
made a 12-3 run starting midway
through the opening period, taking its
largest lead of the game, 26-14. with
6:25 left before halftime. Despite slop
py play, which resulted in nine
turnovers, the Cardinal finished the
half up 33-26.
But any team as talented as Ari
zona is going to make a run, and that
the Wildcats did. Capitalizing on Stan
ford turnovers and missed shots, Ari
zona outscored the Cardinal 17-4 to
take a three-point lead with 10 min
utes to go in the second frame.
"We hit a stretch when things
weren't working and we had to lock
down," Washington said. "Some
teams would have folded under that
type of comeback — Arizona's a
good team. But we didn't, we bounced
back."
A Taj Finger put-back after two of
fensive rebounds put Stanford up two
with four and half minutes to go. Both
teams traded misses and turnovers
until Arizona big man Jordan Hill hit
a jumper with 2:17 left to tie the game
at 52.
Then, Brook Lopez, after missing a
critical shot in the final minutes dur
ing Sunday's loss to Oregon, made a
baseline jumper with 1:55 to play to
give the Cardinal the lead for good.
Next for Stanford is No. 22 Ari
zona State, fresh off a 99-90 double
overtime thriller at Cal Thursday
night. The Sun Devils are averaging
more than 70 points per game, and
will provide another test for the stal
wart Stanford defense.
"This winning ugly is getting old,"
Johnson said."But it's winning."
