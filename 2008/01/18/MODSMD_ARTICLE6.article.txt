## Drell talks SLAC, budget challenge First female director also discusses family life, hobbies and Dickens 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WINTER 
Physicist Persis Drell was named director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in De
cember 2007. She is the center's fourth director and the
first woman to hold its top job.
Drell grew up on Stanford's campus, where the site
of her childhood home is now a Law School parking lot.
Her father is theoretical physicist Sidney Drell, a Stan
ford professor emeritus and former SLAC deputy di
rector.
Drell became interested in matter's basic building
blocks during her freshman year at Wellesley. She
earned a Ph.D. in atomic physics from UC-Berkeley
and did her postdoctoral research in high-energy ex
perimental physics. After spending 14 years as a physics
professor at Cornell, Drell moved to SLAC in 2002 and
has held a series of senior positions at the center since
then. She is married to accelerator physicist James
Welch and has three children.
The Daily spoke with Drell about the scoop on
Sl.AC's decrease in government funding, the atomic
world of particle physics and the works of Charles
Dickens.
The Stanford Daily: Have you faced any particular
challenges as the first female director of SLAC?
Persis Drell: I 've been facing challenges since day one,
but they have nothing to do with being a female. We
have a very difficult budget right now, so I'm dealing
with significant layoffs. When I was acting director, the
founder of the laboratory passed away, which was a
very sad moment for the laboratory. Plenty of chal
lenges. but they don't have anything to do with being
female.
SD: Can you tell me more about your hopes for SLAC
in light of the recent budget cuts?
PI): The budget cuts are of course difficult to deal with,
but we are in the middle of building a new facility, the
Linac Coherent Light Source, which will be the world's
first X-ray free electron laser. It will be a frontier ma
chine for science and I'm very, very excited about that
program. That program did not sustain any cuts ... We
