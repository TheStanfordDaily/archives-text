## Drell talks SLAC, budget challenge First female director also discusses family life, hobbies and Dickens 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WINTER 
Physicist Persis Drell was named director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in De
cember 2007. She is the center's fourth director and the
first woman to hold its top job.
Drell grew up on Stanford's campus, where the site
of her childhood home is now a Law School parking lot.
Her father is theoretical physicist Sidney Drell, a Stan
ford professor emeritus and former SLAC deputy di
rector.
Drell became interested in matter's basic building
blocks during her freshman year at Wellesley. She
earned a Ph.D. in atomic physics from UC-Berkeley
and did her postdoctoral research in high-energy ex
perimental physics. After spending 14 years as a physics
professor at Cornell, Drell moved to SLAC in 2002 and
has held a series of senior positions at the center since
then. She is married to accelerator physicist James
Welch and has three children.
The Daily spoke with Drell about the scoop on
Sl.AC's decrease in government funding, the atomic
world of particle physics and the works of Charles
Dickens.
The Stanford Daily: Have you faced any particular
challenges as the first female director of SLAC?
Persis Drell: I 've been facing challenges since day one,
but they have nothing to do with being a female. We
have a very difficult budget right now, so I'm dealing
with significant layoffs. When I was acting director, the
founder of the laboratory passed away, which was a
very sad moment for the laboratory. Plenty of chal
lenges. but they don't have anything to do with being
female.
SD: Can you tell me more about your hopes for SLAC
in light of the recent budget cuts?
PI): The budget cuts are of course difficult to deal with,
but we are in the middle of building a new facility, the
Linac Coherent Light Source, which will be the world's
first X-ray free electron laser. It will be a frontier ma
chine for science and I'm very, very excited about that
program. That program did not sustain any cuts ... We
have an on-site synchotron facility
that's doing very well. Even though
there were cuts in particle physics, it is
a very exciting time for the field and I
am looking forward to outstanding
science that will come from that.
SI): Do you think the cuts are reflec
tive of the political attitude towards
science right now?
PI): The budget process this year
was unusual. It's hard to interpret it
as anything but the White I louse and
Congress not working well together,
and I think science was a casualty.
SI): Did having a physicist father in
fluence your desire to go into
physics?
PI): My decision to go into physics
really came about in college. I would
not say that 1 wanted to go into
physics because my dad was in
physics; I would say he was an obsta
cle that I overcame. [Laughs] Most
kids don't really want to do what
their parents did; they want to do
something different. When I was in
high school I took a physics class —
which I hated, by the way — and I
would come home with problems. 1
would want to know the answer to
part Band my dad would want to ex
plain it to me, and I wasn't interest

ed. He wanted to make sure I really
understood it, and I just wanted the
answer.
SI): Your husband is a physicist also.
Are your children interested in
physics?
PI): Anything but! I think the oldest
one is headed towards sociology and
psychology; the middle one. I think
he's going to major in soccer: and the
youngest one is only 13.
SI): 1 heard you play the cello?
I'D: In a string quartet with my hus
band, who plays viola. We met play
ing string quartets and we've contin
ued to play.
SI). Do you have time for any other
hobbies?
PI): [Laughs] With this job and the
kids, the music and probably hiking
are my main hobbies. I love to read
but 1 never have enough time to do
it...When 1 travel a lot. it's great,be
cause then I get time to read on the
airplane. I was going back and forth
to Italy for a while, so that's when 1
went through a lot of Charles Dick
ens.
SI): Do you have a favorite Dickens
novel?
PI): I think I love them all!
SI). Do you have any advice for as
piring scientists?
PI): Do what you love. Follow your
heart.
