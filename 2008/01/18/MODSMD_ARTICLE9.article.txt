# PALM TREE RUMORS: AXED
## 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Palm trees inspire a certain
amount of feverishness on this
campus. Along with the weath
er, they're one of the reasons 1
came to Stanford from dreary
London. After all, the warm weather
icons are emblematic of the distinct Stan
ford environment, which boasts clear,
sunny skies and sunbathing in February.
Although we laugh embarrassedly at
their supposed exorbitant costs, we seem
to agree that we are in love with them.
Every time I hear a discussion about
palm trees, the rumored cost per tree in
creases exponentially — with figures as
high as half a million dollars being
thrown around.
Some have suggested that the palm
trees represent the worst aspects of the
University — a facade of blissful beauty
that hides spiraling costs and environ
mental problems. J have even heard that
the palm trees we have on campus are
not able to survive in a northern Cali
fornian climate and so start dying as
soon as they are planted — we face a
losing battle to keep them alive. Yet. how
can one reach such conclusions without
actually knowing the facts behind the
palms'*
According to Herb Fong. manager of
the grounds services department, the
more than 500 palm trees on campus are
native to several regions from the world,
including Mexico, Africa and China.
Maintenance for these trees, however,
does not seem as difficult or expensive as
many might think.
"We service palm trees about once
every three to seven years at a cost of ap
proximately $4(X) per tree," he said. "The

costs are justified in order to reduce fu
ture maintenance costs and to preserve
the value of these assets."
Fong explained that the trees are
pruned of the lower, dead fronds when
they are being serviced. He added that
maintaining palm trees is not particularly
difficult; in fact, he even went as far as to
say that they are probably easier to main
tain than conventional trees
Only $400 every three to seven years?
What about the large, uncontrollable
costs and huge maintenance bills that I
had been hearing so much about? Per
haps it is expensive to maintain the trees
when they are first brought onto campus.
Fong. however, assured me that once in
the ground, weekly watering in the sum
mer for the first year is generally all the
attention that is needed.
The University purchases more than
half of its palm trees directly from local
nurseries. Fong said.
"Smaller trees can be purchased for
under $50," he said. "(New palms of the
size of those] along Palm Drive can cost
up to two to three thousand [dollars]."
"Palms are often purchased from
nurseries in southern California, and are
transported to installation sites on large
flat bed trucks," said Deborah Canino, a
campus planner at the Architect, Campus
Planning and Design Office. "Nurseries
often sell palms they salvaged and trans
ported from other sites to the nurseries
for holding until buyers are found, which
results in multiple truck moves."
Other trees are donated to the Uni
versity. According to Fong, the large do
nated palms can cost between $4000 to
$5000 to plant on campus.
"The palms are moved by cranes and
transported via trucks .to campus," he
said.
However, not all donated palms are

accepted.
"Although it is very cost effective to
receive donated palms or to transplant
campus palms, sustainability is a major
motivator for transplanting," Canino
said. "The palms we've accepted have
come from local sites such as Redwood
City, Menlo Park and Los Altos."
A lot of the donated trees are also
ones that would have been demolished if
they were not rescued by the University.
"We enjoy the community interaction
involved in working with donors who
take satisfaction from moving their trees
to a compatible site rather than demol
ishing them," Canino explained.
Furthermore, the loss of palms due to
disease has not been a large issue at Stan
ford, so most of the palms do not need to
be replaced often. According to Fong,
some of our palms are affected by dia
mond scale,a local fungus, but this has not
caused much of a loss at this time. While
there are chemical treatments, Grounds
Services prefers not to employ them.
"[We] would rather live with the prob
lem since it has not caused any significant
losses," Fong said.
Palms that perish soon after arriving on
campus are also not a significant problem.
"The canary island date palms, in gen
eral and on our campus, are known to
have a high transplant success rate,"
Canino said.
Though the palm trees on campus
might not serve any practical purpose,
Grounds Services representatives claim
that standard maintenance and trans
porting costs are not excessive. Next time
you bike down Palm Drive, you can rest
assured that not all your tuition money is
being wasted on palm trees.
