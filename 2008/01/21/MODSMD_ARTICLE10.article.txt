# Songwriter finding the sun, spotlight
## 
### DONG LIU 
rt was a spring night in 2006. It was the
Stanford Collo concert series. It was
I a moment of light beers shimmering
under faint lights. Fingers tapped on
11. the tables and heads jostled to face
the makeshift stage. And suddenly the key
board tinkled: the guitar wailed; the bass
bellowed; the drums rumbled. With a zing,
time froze in its tracks and music flowed in
its wake as the lead singer of the Stanford
band Crystal City delivered the opening
lyrics to the ballad "Forever Is Too Long."
... Countless day rush by, they melt into the
scene, of yon and /...

The singer's deep, rich baritone
voice reverberated melodiously off
the walls of the coffee house. The
rhythm guitar in his hand strummed
out chords that mellowed the amber
colored atmosphere of the night. His
palpably magnetic stage charisma
captured and enraptured all. Gradu
ally the whispering quietude of song
developed into an emotional out
burst. as the singer threw back his
head in a moment of ecstatic remi
niscence.
...We were lost in time. Our forever,
but it ended far too 500n...
He was Will Agee '09, the lead
singer and songwriter of the Stan
ford band that has played at major
events on Stanford campus, and also
embarked on a national tour to
major music venues across the coun
try. After releasing the group's debut
album Finding the Sun in September
2006. Will left Stanford for a year to
focus on the ensuing promotional
tour from San Rafael, Calif, to New
York City.
...So in memories 1 hide...
Growing upon the east coast. Will

developed a strong affinity for Boh
Marley's music. He and Crystal City
bassist Stephen Lorek, one of Will's
childhood friends, formed their first
rock band. Pipeline, which was later
renamed the Freedom Fighters.
"Playing at Louie's in Maryland
was our biggest gig," Will recounted.
"Everyone in the area loved us."
...As colors fade to black, nothing is
gonna last...
After his sophomore year of high
school. Will's family moved from
Washington D C. to Napa. Calif, and
Will attended a boarding school in
Lugano, Switzerland. Many of the
songs he wrote during his European
stay were recorded at the Cue
Recording Studio in Virginia. Before
coming to Stanford in the fall of 2005,
a sudden case of bronchitis and pneu
monia made him grow "disillusioned
with music and with life in general."
...And I'm losing my grip, wanting
you hack...
At Stanford. Will initially re
frained from playing music. But
when a "goofy guy in the dorm with
curly hair and a guitar" invited him
to jam. he relented.
"1 would play things, and he'd be
like 'Dude, that's awesome,'" Will
said. "He gave me a sense of ratifica
tion. an acknowledgement of my tal
ents. He changed me from writing
songs for myself to sharing them with

others."
That "goofy guy" turned out to be
Grahame Lesh 09, son of Phil Lesh
of The Grateful Dead.
.../ was thinking and I was dreaming,
when 1 lost van...

Stephen and drummer Dylan Mulc
ahy, joined Grahame and Stanford
keyboardist Jesse Engreitz '09 to
form Crystal City. The group toured
with Phil Lesh and Friends during
the summer of 2006. as well as sign
ing a record contract with Diamond

"I want to write music for
the rest of my life and hit a
common chord with people."

"Will's greatest talent as a song
writer is his sense of how to tie to
gether lyrics and melody," Grahame
said. "You can have the perfect
melody for a song, but it doesn't
mean a thing if the lyrics don't mesh
with it. Luckily, with Will's songs
both these aspects of his vocals work
together beautifully." They quickly
formed Dirty Blonde, which won
second place at the annual Battle of
the Bands at Stanford in 2006.
... You were never that far...
Will's former band members.

WILL AGEE, junior
D to release their debut album Find
ing the Sun, produced at the famous
Plant Studio in Sausalito, Calif.
...But somehow, it seems now, there's
nothing...
Finding the Sun features six songs
now being sold on iTUnes. From the
bouncy frolicking country ballad
"Virginia" to the wailing hard rock
anthem "Cosmic Jungle," the album
demonstrates musical influences
from Ryan Adams, Noel Gallagher
and Jeff Buckley.The optimistic rest
lessness of "Grey" and the fiery nos
talgia of "When 1 Was Young" con

trast against "Forever Is Too Long." a
power ballad that features alterna
tive moods of teary reminiscences
and excruciating proclamations.
...And forever is too long.
The song ended with a flourish.
Applause. Cheers. Standing Ova
tions. And now, back to Stanford
from his coast-to-coast promotional
tour. Will is working on another
songwriting project, and looks for
ward to sharing it with the world
upon its completion.
"From playing in the basement of
Cuban immigrants to playing on Phil
Lesh s tour and signing at Diamond
D in two years," Will said, "we went
from nothing to quite a bit. It's a pre
cursor of what's to come."
Imagine a young Roger Daltrey
working at a sheet metal factory bv
day and rehearsing The Who by night,
or a burgeoning Jimi Hendrix playing
his debut nightly gigs in New York
nightclubs. Will Agee is at the same
point, yet he has gone much farther.
"After graduation I plan to go all
out on the music scene," he said. "I
am a melancholy artist, a hopeless
romantic. 1 want to explore why the
past is better than the present in all
my songs. 1 want to write music for
the rest of my life, and hit a common
chord with people, as I did in the
past, and as I will do in the future."
