## Hoover exhibit reveals WWI soldiers' lives Students from fall quarter class help design "Never Such Innocence" 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
"Never Such Innocence: British Images of the
First World War," an exhibit on display at the
Hoover Institution until March 1, features texts
and images chosen by the students of Emeritus
History Prof. Peter Stansky's "History and the
Arts."
Ten students from this year's fall quarter class,
as well as several students from previous years,
wrote descriptions of the pieces displayed and
worked with Hoover Institution staff to assemble
the exhibit.
"My hope is that by the hands-on experience of

working with the material for the exhibit that the
students had a different learning experience and
appreciated the significance of the material in a
new way," Stansky wrote in an email to The Daily.
The exhibit, which offers two lenses through
which to view British history from IIU4l l U4 through
1918, displays official government posters along
side the unofficial artwork of disheartened British
soldiers.
"Never Such Innocence" was not Stanskys first
such exhibit, but it was the first one in eleven years
to feature student involvement in its creation.
" I've done similar exhibits in the past, and an ex
hibit in the Hoover Art Gallery in connection with
a Bay-wide event called 'Britain meets the Bay,"'
he said. "I spoke to Hoover several years before
doing this exhibit, as they plan long in advance.
TTiey liked the idea of student participation."
Highlights of the exhibit include an etchings
series bv British artist Percv John Smith titled

"The Dance of Death," featuring the figure of
death responding to casualties on the battlefield.
Also on display are copies of Wipers l imes, a
newspaper written mainly by the enlisted men of
the Twenty-fourth Division of the British Army
that satirizes soldiers' living conditions and situa
tion during the war.
Stansky said he hopes both students and oth
ers in the Stanford community will come see the
free exhibit while it is showing this month.
"The poster and the title 1 think are very pow
erful and the display 1 think conveys a lot about
Britain and the First World War. its hopes and
tragedies and 'innocence,'" he said.
The exhibit can be viewed in the Hoover
Memorial Exhibit Pavilion, and is open to the
public Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4
p.m.
