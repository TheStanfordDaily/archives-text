## Obama, Clinton speak to church congregations to honor MLK Day 
### NEDRA PICKLER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ATLANTA - Barack Obama called Sunday
for unity to overcome the country's prob
lems and acknowledged that "none of our
hands are clean" when it conies to healing
divisions. Hillary Rodham Clinton picked
up a Harlem church leader's endorsement.
Heading into the most racially diverse
contest yet in the presidential campaign,
Obama took to the pulpit at Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church on the
eve of the federal holiday marking the civil
rights hero's birth 79 years ago. He based his
speech on King's quote that "Unity is the
great need of the hour."
"The divisions, the stereotypes, the
scapegoating.the ease with which we blame
the plight of ourselves on others, all of that
distracts us from the common challenges we
face: war and poverty; inequality and injus

tice," Obama said. "We can no longer afford
to build ourselves up by tearing each other
down. We can no longer afford to traffic in
lies or fear or hate. It is the poison that we
must purge from our politics; the wall that
we must tear down before the hour grows
too late."
In New York, at the Abyssinian Baptist
Church in Harlem, Clinton told how she
had traveled years ago with her church
youth group to hear him speak.
"It was a transforming experience for
me," Clinton said. "He made it very clear
that the civil rights movement was about
economic justice."
A day earlier, Clinton defeated Obama
in Nevada's caucuses and the two chal
lengers are looking ahead to South Caroli
na, where the Democratic primary is Satur
day. ITie state is the first where a large num
ber of black voters will participate, and
Obama needs a win to remain a front-run

ner in the race for the party's presidential
nomination. He won the leadoff contest in
lowa, and lost New 1 lampshire and Nevada
to Clinton.
Obama is counting on blacks to stick
with him despite his losing two in a row to
Clinton. He lost Nevada despite winning 83
percent of blacks, who made up 15 percent
of the total vote. In South Carolina, they are
expected to make up at least half the
turnout.
Obama's campaign has worked to over
come concerns among black voters that he
wouldn't be able to win an election in white
America. But his poll numbers leaped
among blacks after his victory in practically
all-white lowa.
"1 understand that many of you are still a
little skeptical," Obama said Friday night at
a King banquet in Las Vegas. "But not as
skeptical as you were before lowa. Some
times it takes other folks before we believe

ourselves."
He said in an interview with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson on WVON-AM in Chicago
that South Carolina is "absolutely critical to
our success."
After appearing in Harlem, Clinton
picked up the endorsement of the Rev.
Calvin Butts. As dozens of Obama support
ers shouted "Harlem for Obama," Clinton's
supporters tried to drown them out by
shouting "Hil-la-ry!"
Clinton spoke warmly of her opponent
saying, "I recognize what a challenging
choice this is."
Obama's and Clinton's campaigns en
gaged in several days of back and forth
after some interpreted her comments
about King as minimizing his role in the
passage of landmark civil rights legislation.
She was also criticized when some of her
supporters pointed out that Obama admit
ted to using cocaine and smoking marijua

na as a youth. The two candidates called a
truce on the racially tinged debate last
week.
Obama himself brought up the drug use
as he talked about why he has built a cam
paign on hope.
"The odds of me standing here today are
so small, so remote that I couldn't have got
ten here without some hope." he said to
shouts of support from the audience." My
daddy left me when 1 was 2 years 01d.... I got
in trouble when 1 was a teenager, got into
some things that people now like to talk
about. 1 needed some hope to get here."
Obama said blacks often have been the
victims of injustice, but he said they also
have perpetrated divisions with gays. Jews
and immigrants.
"If we're honest with ourselves, we'll ac
knowledge that our own community has not
always been true to King's vision of a
beloved community," he said to applause.
