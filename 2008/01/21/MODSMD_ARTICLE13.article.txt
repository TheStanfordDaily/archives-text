This Martin Luther King. Jr. Day,take
a second to juxtapose these mental
images. In the l%()s, civil rights ac
tivists were brutalized while protesting tor
basic human liberties — they used non-vio
lent means to gain rights that had too long
been denied. Now. in our own decade, col
lege papers across the nation are reporting
stories of students who have literally beaten
themselves up. a la "Fight Club," to then
falsely claim they were attacked, in order to
draw publicity to themselves or their cause.
These students have the opportunity to
voice their opinions in campus debates and
political controversies, yet they resort to
grisly and deceptive guerilla tactics, simply
because no one is attacking or denying their
rights. Iliis unnecessary faux violence is a
grotesque twist of events that exemplifies
just how far some have strayed from the
non-violence of the civil rights era.
The stories seem too outrageous to be
true, yet they are surfacing at colleges across
the country. Most prominently, a Princeton
junior who led a conservative advocacy
group wound up at the University Medical
Center after a particularly brutal self-inflict
ed incident. ITie student, Francisco Nava.
began by sending threatening e-mails with
lines such as "we will destroy you... you will
suffer" to himself, three members of his con
servative group and even his academic advi
sor. His fabrications escalated with fabricat
ed death threats, and in a final episode. Nava
broke a glass bottle over his head, scraped
his head against a brick wall and pummeled
his face before showing up at the Medical
Center bruised and bloodied by his own
hands. He lied to nurses and police, alleging
that masked men had beaten him. Investiga
tions revealed that Nava had also mocked

threats against himself at his elite private
high school.
Although perhaps the most high profile,
Nava is not the only student who has falsi
fied harrowing accounts of violence in order
to create sympathy for a controversial polit
ical cause. Comparable cases collected by
Time magazine include a George Washing
ton University freshman who drew
swastikas on her own door, a College of New
Jersey student who faked death threats to
himself and members of his gay rights group
and even a professor from Claremont-
McKenna College who vandalized her own
car with racist and sexist epithets.
First, it should be noted that none of
these individuals and their affiliated groups
were actually threatened on the basis of
their opinions. Their freedom to voice their
opinions without fear of oppression is no
small feat. Just this year, events that unfold
ed in Jena, La. vividly demonstrated that
even today, students are threatened when
trying to exercise their rights. But by invok
ing the images and histories of actual victims
of oppression, these hoaxers make a mock
ery of those who genuinely lived through it.
Although they enjoy the right, the hard-won
luxury, of voicing their opinions without
threats or injuries, they seek to generate
danger in order to selfishly elevate their
cause.
Has free speech become so plain and
common? ITiese hoaxes distract public at
tention from legitimate causes which de
serve our attention. With so many subtle,
and not-so-subtle, varieties of systematic
oppression which still exist today,ours is not
a society that can afford to be distracted by
the self-flagellations of a few mendacious
morons.
