# Students Illustrated
## Deserving to be apathetic? 
### 
I was shocked when I found out that Jon
wasn't going to vote in the 2(X)4 presi
dential elections. His political apathy
seemed a complete disconnect from the pas
sionate voice I had heard echoing down our
freshman dorm's hallways. He vehemently
opposed Bush's proposed ban on gay mar
riage, overspending, and. of course, Iraq. As
an opinionated college student. Jon would
be clawing at the doors of the voting booths
for an opportunity to shape his nation's gov
ernment, or so I thought. I was wrong.
Rather than exercise his constitutional right.
Jon has continued to weave a convoluted
web of unjustified excuses for his voting tru
ancy
It seems as if his un-punched ballot only
reflects a larger trend of political apathy on
Stanford's campus. On election day, I stroll
into voting stations, right past the non-exis
tent lines of eagerly waiting Stanford stu
dents. Maybe I just vote too late in the day?
Or take last fall, when 1 was abroad in
Beijing. With an impending pivotal political
upset looming on the horizon, I was the only
one out of 22 Stanford students to send in a
vote.
It's not that Stanford students don't care
about politics. We do. Most students quickly
jump at the opportunity to discuss this year's
presidential primaries. I lowever,at Stanford
and other universities around the country, a
depressing number of able student-voters
fail to cast a ballot.
When I asked Jon why such a politically
passionate individual would choose a path
of political apathy over political action, he
had a surprising response:"l don't feel like I
deserve to vote." Deserve to vote? Last time
I checked, voting was a right afforded to all
US. citizens over age 18. Jumping through
hoops to earn one's ballot was abolished
decades ago. "I'm just not an informed
voter." he said."and I don't want to make the
mistake of voting for a bad candidate just
because 1 don't know enough."
I hear statements reminiscent of the one
above on too regular a basis. While many
students in my dorm have even been campus
recruiters for various presidential candi
dates. political fervor is far from universal.
Just the other day as our dorm representa
tive went door to door, voter registration
forms in hand, several individuals muttered
the same "uniformed voter" rationalization
for non-registration.
Hearing Stanford students cite lack of in
formation as a justification for political apa
thy sends chills down my spine. For one, sim
ply due to immersion in such a politically

charged campus, the average college student
probably knows more then the average
voter. And almost all of us have a vision for
the future and possess opinions about the
steps needed to achieve a better world â€”
whether that be through increased support
for the arts, a refurbished education system,
or a less pre-emptive foreign policy. Voting
by one's principles (principles informed by a
rich campus dialog that often flows through
our halls) is not only a step towards guiding
the world towards one's vision, it's an edu
cated one.
Argument number two: Stanford stu
dents make plenty of other decisions that
impact their own lives and the lives of others
with far less information than they probably
have about the upcoming primaries. Even
though most of the freshman class doesn't
read half of their assigned I HUM reading,
you never hear them complain, "Oh. I don't
deserve to write that paper." Another exam
ple: observe Stanford's overactive hookup
culture on any Friday night. After a few
beers and a few sweet words, neither party
will abandon ship on the way to the bed
room with the 'words. "I don't deserve to
sleep with this person right now... 1 just don't
know enough."
Every citizen in this country deserves to
vote. It's a right granted to every American
and it's a right that should be exercised just
as liberally as free speech. And while being
an informed voter is still important, Stanford
students shouldn't feel like they have to read
a treatise on each candidate's position in
order to create an informed decision.
I don't know if Jon will ever change his
feelings about voting. In this column. I've
tried to distill over three years of persuasion
in the hope that hearing my arguments again
will convince him to cast a ballot in this
year's primaries: Jon. truly uninformed vot
ers don't know they deserve the right to
vote.

Laura would like to remind Iter readers thai

primaries is tomorrow. E-mail her at trillium
