# Little Ms. Modern

Everyone's favorite wannabe linguist,
William Safire, recently wrote in The
New York Times Magazine about
retronyms, words that are created due to a
new world development.
For example, "acoustic guitar" describes
what was simply called a guitar before the
electric version hit the scene. There's also
"analog watch," which refers to the good old
fashioned, two-handed version that was
long-ago upstaged by the sleeker digital kind.
And so now if 1 may (and this is my col
umn, so yes, 1 most definitely may). I'd like to
humbly suggest another retronym for the list:
"real life." Although this probably isn't strict
ly true, or even true at all. I would neverthe
less posit that this Ã¼biquitous little phrase
emerged out of a most modern and quite spe
cific need: to distinguish boring, old-fash
ioned physical existence from our infinitely
more enthralling lives on Facebook.
Some of you may object to this character
ization, and indeed, may even squirm at the
suggestion that you have an Internet life at
all. After all. online socializing is for people
who can't quite handle physical world social
izing. and that's certainly not you. gracious
and attractive reader.
Still, even the most socially competent
among us tend to enjoy photo-documenting
our social successes, so that those poor souls
who are less gifted might at least witness our
revelry. Facebook turns out to be the perfect
venue for such showcasing. And in the midst
of fastidious tagging, commenting, and status
updating ("Caitlin is completely exhausted
from a more awesome weekend than you'll
ever have"), who can help but indulge in the
occasional poke or six? Thus the Facebook
life begins.
Old people who write about culture for
reputable newspapers and magazines often
grumble about our generation's obsession
with Facebook and the like. They claim it
breeds narcissism, societal disengagement,
and some kind of soullessncss. Crazy people.

who write conspiracy theory pamphlets and
kill half a rain forest to litter college campus
es with their propaganda, also preach the
evils of the 'hook.
One such pamphlet, sprinkled around
campus last week, was entitled, "Is the Devil
in Your Laptop?" In an article consisting
mostly of barely coherent ad hominem at
tacks against people like Bill Gates, we read,
"I lave you been to the zoo and looked at the
animals in the cages? [Me: Oh, you mean the
San Francisco Zoo? Yeah, those little koalas
are so cute!) Facebook is worse. [Me: Oh. I
think 1 misunderstood.] The people in Face
book must give up their souls to get in the
cage. Humanity is not allowed in the 'social
graph,' only information. [Me: Do koalas
have souls?]"
Sorry. Mr. Crazy Guy, but you give away
your utter cluelessness by your improper
preposition usage! Obviously, the people are
"on" Facebook, not "in" Facebook. What a
silly, amateur mistake. And I apologize, but I
simply cannot bestow any persuasive power
to someone who has clearly neither been to
the zoo nor on Facebook.
Anyway, I'll leave the soul question for
another day, but let me now address the nar
cissism and societal disengagement concerns
of respectable journalists.
First, is there narcissism? Yes. duh! Like
that eternally distracting reflecting pool of
Greek lore, the Facebook profile can be
come an abyss of self-love that consumes
one entirely. However, the majority of us do
realize this, and even the most enthusiastic
exhibitionists are generally kept in check

bccausc they, too,are still keener on stalking
the profiles of others than in primping their
own.
This brings me to my second point: socie
tal disengagement. If we are flexible about
what the word "society" means, 1 'd argue that
most Facebookers are, in fact,quite engaged!
Facebook purports to be a social networking
site, and coincidentally enough, a social net
work seems to bear close resemblance to the
referent of that elusive abstract noun, socie
ty Just like the physical members of real life
society, we online young'ns are interested in
discovering who drunkenly disrobed at
which party and who undeservedly landed
which swanky new job, and we'd prefer the
evidence complete with photos and links.
Facebook is an incredibly efficient machine
for such discoveries.
But believe it or not. we ciire about other
stuff too. like politics, global warming, reli
gion, technology, and just about every other
issue that interests the inhabitants of the real
world. Facebook can serve as an excellent
platform for exchange of ideas about these
matters as well, especially amongst like
minded (or civilly disagreeing) individuals
who are geographically restricted from real
life discussion. It's also just a convenient way
to keep up with long distance friends whom
we miss dearly (tear).
In the end. more than a soul-sucking cage
or a shrine for self-adulation, Facebook is just
an open infrastructure for information that
we can treat as we wish. While a minority
treat it as a repository for valuable private
data and incriminating photographs, this be
havior is a glitch in human nature, not in
Facebook. For the rest of us. it's an effective
and modern means for well-organized, multi
media communication that, yes, also happens
to foster healthv addiction.
