## Win over ASU exposes strengths, weaknesses 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's weaknesses were on tull
display as the team won at Arizona State
on Sunday afternoon, but so too were the
things that make the team great: superb
post play, a knack for hitting timely shots
and Candice Wiggins.
Once again, Stanford had a ton of
trouble from three-point range and the
foul line â€” the Cardinal went 3-for-I8
from beyond the arc and 9-for-15 from
the stripe. If these deficiencies continue
to go without improvement, they may
bite Stanford at exactly the wrong time
in tournament play this spring.
However, the threes that Stanford did
manage to make came at just the right
times. J.J. Hones' shot at the end of the
first half, and Wiggins' at the start of the
second, put the Cardinal in position to
make its 11-point comeback against the
Sun Devils.
The rest of the way, Stanford relied on
its posts and Wiggins. Sophomore center
Jayne Appel turned in another superb
performance for the Cardinal, picking
apart Arizona State's zone defense with
her vision and quick passing. Appel had
five assists against ASU; were she play
ing with more reliable outside shooters,
she niav well have had 10.

Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen
was the main beneficiary of Appel's work
yesterday, both deep in the post and at
the top of the key. Perhaps in the future.
Appel's skill at getting wide-open looks
for the team's perimeter players will help
a few of them catch fire from distance.
Finally, there is Candice Wiggins.
What can you say that has not already
been said? At times she is simply too
much for a defense to handle.The second
half was one of those times, as Wiggins
sped past, spun off and otherwise abused
her defenders on the way to 18 points. In
a close game, her four steals at the other
end made a critical difference as well.
One other item of note is the second
half that sophomore point guard J.J.
Hones played. She played almost the en
tire 20 minutes in place of starter Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude. dishing out five as
sists without a turnover. Hones is not as
athletic as Gold-Onwude. but she has
been a steadier hand at the point so far
this year, with an excellent 4.56 assist-to
turnover ratio. Thirty-three minutes
against ASU suggests she is back to full
fitness after knee surgery last year.
Hones' contribution will be hugely im
portant for the rest of the year.
