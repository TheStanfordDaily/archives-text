# Corruption damages firms
## GSB study shows link between crooked governments and inefficient companies 
### BEN EPPLER DESK EDITOR 
A 2007 study by a professor at the Graduate
School of Business has revealed that corruption can
have debilitating effects on a nation's businesses, re
ducing efficiency and slowing economic growth.
Although other work in the field has already
demonstrated that increased corruption leads to
macroeconomic drags such as a decreased saving
rate, the study is the first to show its negative effects
in terms of "technical inefficiency of firms," said
Ernesto Dal 80, a professor at the Graduate School
of Business and co-author of the study
"We are the first to show that corruption damages
the ability of firms to create wealth," he said.
The paper, which was co-authored by Martin
Rossi of Argentina's Universidad de San Andres,
compared the efficiency of electrical companies in
Latin America and the level of corruption in the
firm's country as measured by international monitor
ing organizations.
To determine the "efficiency" of the electrical
companies, the researchers analyzed a wide variety of

data, including employees, kilowatt-hours of energy
generated, transformer capacity and network size
and density for more than 90 firms across Latin
America.
Dal Bo and Rossi discovered that in countries
with high levels of corruption, firms employ more
workers than similar firms in countries where corrup
tion is less of a problem.
Highlighting the firm's employment levels was illu
minating because in the utilities industry, "the capital
inputs are pretty much fixed," over relatively short pe
riods of time, Dal Bo said. "The main determinant of
efficiency is how well you're using your labor."
The increased numbers of employees in corrupt
positions represent wasted productivity, sapping na
tional wealth and driving down important statistics
like GDP per capita, according to Dal 80.
"More corrupt countries and countries that get
more corrupt over time are associated with firms that
get worse at what they do," he said.
While uncommon in the United States, bribery and
other crooked dealings between government officials
and private citizens and companies remains a world
wide problem â€” in a 2007 report by the monitoring

organization Transparency International, 81 countries
were found to have corruption scores of three or less
on a scale of zero to 10. with 10 being squeaky clean.
"When a country has a score of three or less," Dal
Bo said,"corruption is a very serious issue."
Although Dal Bo and Rossi began the study
more than six years ago, when both were students at
Oxford, Dal Bo said that "most of the work was done
while we both were in different places." Despite the
distance, the cross-continental joint project was facil
itated by Internet database sharing and email com
munication.
The researchers expressed hope that the study's
findings, published in the Journal of Public Econom
ics, would spur further efforts by governments to com
bat corruption.
"My hope is that this contributes to having people
taking corruption very seriously as one factor in dam
aging development and living standards," Dal Bo said.
"We didn't quite know where the tragedy happens.
The tragedy happens at the places where we create
wealth, and that is firms."
