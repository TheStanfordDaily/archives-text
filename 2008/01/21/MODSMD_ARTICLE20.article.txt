# No place like home for Card
## 
### 
Winning games in the Pac-10
certainly isn't easy. Win
ning games on the road?
You probably shouldn't count on it,
unless you're playing Oregon State.
What this means is that the value
of defending home court advantage
is that much more important. Stan
ford's weekend sweep over the Ari
zona schools was crucial not only be
cause of the caliber of the opponents
— both of the wins against Arizona
and Arizona State will certainly help
the Cardinal's RPI rating — or the
fact that the team is now just one-half
game back in the conference stand
ings. Rather, the most rewarding
thing to take away from this week
end's games is the simple fact that
Stanford successfully defended its
home court.
In essence, games at home are in
surance. If they're not money in the
bank, then you're in trouble. Home
games are the steak and potatoes
while road games are gravy.
Although the Cardinal should
hope and expect to sweep teams like
the Arizona schools at home, if the
environments were reversed, we
might be pressed to expect the exact
opposite result.
Winning on the road is greatly ap
preciated. but not paramount; losing
at home, depending on the oppo
nent, can be unacceptable.
Both games were ugly this week
end. but the Cardinal got the job
done at Maples Pavilion. Although
the team rode Brook Lopez to both
victories, there were promising con
tributions from other team mem
bers: Anthony Goods got back on
track a bit with his shooting,
"Lawrence Hill hit a huge three
pointer in the Arizona game while
Landry Fields and Taj Finger (as al
ways) gave the team solid minutes
off of the bench. And 1 would be re
miss to leave out Fred Washington,
who sealed the game against the
Wildcats with two free throws in the
waning seconds.
With a 4-2 record in conference,
the team now has at least somewhat
of a cushion heading into its next
three opponents: Cal. Washington
and Washington State. All three
games will be on the road.
