## Patriots advance to fourth Super Bowl in seven years, will face Giants on Feb. 3 
### BEN WALKER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - "Now we
can look ahead." Bill Belichick. a
coach of few words, said it all with
that sentence after his New England
Patriots claimed the AFC champi
onship trophy. Looking ahead means
only one thing: A trip to the Super
Bowl, and a chance to give their per
fect record a whole new meaning.
Despite a shaky Tom Brady, the
Patriots were still too much for the
banged-up San Diego Chargers,
pulling out a 21-12 victory Sunday
that sent them back to the NFL title
game for the fourth time in seven
seasons.
"There was history on the line,"
Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi
said. "We recognize it. we acknowl
edge it."
Brady made several stunningly
poor throws that fluttered in the
wind. Randy Moss was a non-factor
for the second straight game and the
highest-scoring team in NFL history
sputtered all afternoon. Instead, the
Patriots (18-0) relied on Laurence
Maroney's spins, cuts and helmet
rattling runs.
With injured Chargers star
LaDainian Tomlinson reduced to
mostly watching in a parka, the Patri
ots moved on to a Feb. 3 matchup in
Glendale, Ariz., against the New
York Giants.
The C iiants beat Green Bay 23-20
in overtime for the NFC champi
onship. New England closed out its
regular season by beating the Giants
in a 38-35 thriller.
Yet for all the Brady Bunch has
accomplished - they're the only team
in NFL history to start out with 18
straight victories - the Patriots are
well aware they must win that final
game to avoid being relegated to a
footnote.
"We'll try to elevate our game for
one last performance," said Brady,
MVP in two of the three Super
Bowls he's won.
Brady, coming off a record-setting
50 TD passes, threw for two scores.
He also tossed a season-high three
interceptions.
No matter. New England took
care of the nuts and Bolts on a most
chilly day. The sellout crowd at
Gillette Stadium chanted "Super
Bowl! Super Bowl!" in the closing
minutes, anticipating the Pats' first
appearance in the big game since the
2004 season.
Belichick's team eclipsed the 17-0
mark of the champion l l )72 Miami
Dolphins, and he'll soon try tor his
fourth NFL title.
"I think there will be a time to sit
back and reflect." Belichick said.
"We'll certainly enjoy this for a few
days."
Brady earned his 100 th career vic
tory and advanced without a hint of
girlfriend drama - taking notes, Tony
Romo? The dimpled Patriots quar
terback will bring true glam to Super
Bowl: Imagine the paparazzi buzz if
Brady is sighted with Gisele Bund
chen.
A model of success in the late sea
son. the Chargers (13-6) fell short
minus Tomlinson. He was hurt last
week in the playoff upset of the
Super Bowl champion Indianapolis
Colts, and was mostly a spectator as
San Diego's eight-game winning
streak ended.
Tomlinson carried on the first two
San Diego plays, and did not run it
again because of a bad knee. Charg
ers quarterback Philip Rivers hung
in despite a torn ligament in his knee
and star tight end Antonio Gates did
his best with a dislocated toe.
"From getting it reinjured the first
play. I just knew I didn't have it."
Tomlinson said. "I'm kind of at a loss
for words."
San Diego coach Norv Turner
needed to improvise without Tomlin
son. a two-time rushing champ. Even
so. the Chargers never could get into
the end zone, and that cost them
dearly.
"lie really couldn't get started."
Turner said."l le went and tried to go
and just didn't have the power to
push off."
Routed 38-14 at New England in
September, the Chargers gave a bet
ter performance.'lTiey trailed just 14-
12 midway in the third quarter this
time, but Brady's 6-yard I'D pass to
Wes Welker early in the fourth peri
od was enough for New England.

Maroney ran for 122 yards to help
hold the lead.
"It felt like everything was a
struggle today," Brady said."We did
n't perform the way 1 thought we
were capable of."
The Patriots seemed poised to
pull away late in the third quarter,
but a terrible throw by Brady cost
them. On third-and-goal at the 2,
Brady tried a touch pass over the
middle that NFL interceptions
leader Antonio Cromartie easilv

picked off standing on the New Eng
land logo in the end zone.
Nate Kaeding's fourth field goal,
a 24-yarder midway through the
third period, pulled San Diego to 14-
12.T00 bad for the Chargers, that was
the story of their afternoon - they'd
drive close, only to wind up settling
for four kicks.
"1 think we gave ourself a chance
today." Rivers said. "It's unfortunate
we couldn't score in the red zone."
It was 23 degrees at gametime.

making for frosty breaths on the field
and putting the Patriots cheerleaders
in parkas. Most players chose to ig
nore the cold and came out in short
sleeves.
The brisk wind caused more no
ticeable problems. The goal posts
shook with every gust while passes
and punts sailed in crazy directions.
"I didn't think it was that bad,"
Belichick said. "It wasn't a balmy
day, I'm not saying that, but it wasn't
bad."

Normally solid in chilly weather,
Brady took a while to adjust to the
conditions.
"Now we're going someplace
warm, because I'm freezing my you
know-what off." Brady said.
He badly missed his first two pass
es - he threw a total of two incomple
tions in 28 attempts last week in the
win over Jacksonville.
A few minutes later. Brady lofted
a poor toss that Quentin Jammer in
tercepted. Belichick talked this week

about the Chargers' "ball disrup
tion" and turnovers certainly were a
focus - San Diego led the league in
takeaways, the Pats had the fewest
giveaways.
San Diego turned Jammer's pick
off into Kaeding's 26-yard field goal
with 2:55 left in the period for a 3-0
lead.
This wasn't what the home fans
expected, and they grew silent as the
Chargers refused to back down, en
gaging in several post-play scuffles.
