## Wise says innovations grow healthcare inequality Medical technology advances expand rich-poor gap 
### ROBERT TOEWS 
Prominent health policy thinker
and Child Health Prof. Paul Wise
spoke Friday about the effects of med
ical innovations on social disparities in
health care at the first Ethics at Noon
lecture of the quarter.
Wise, who is currently a member of

Stanford's Center for Health Policy,
previously served as a special assistant
to the U.S. Surgeon General and as di
rector of the Harvard Institute for Re
productive and Child Health at Har
vard Medical School.
Before a packed classroom of stu
dents and community members. Wise
discussed the widening gap in quality
of health care received between the
rich and the poor, which he called a
"disturbing social problem." He cited
the growing discrepancy in infant
mortality rates across socioeconomic

groups as a particularly prominent ex
ample.
The growing gap. Wise argued, can
be attributed in large part to the de
velopment of medical innovations in
technology and treatment, including
machines that enhance the precision
of prenatal diagnosis. Such services
are typically available to wealthier pa
tients covered by health care compa
nies like Blue Cross but unavailable to
those unable to afford expensive
health care.
The divide often falls along racial

lines, adding a further dimension to
the problem. In the early 19905, Wise
said, an increasingly drastic disparity
in the mortality rates between black
children and white children suffering
from Down syndrome began to devel
op as a consequence of innovations
that made Down syndrome more
treatable for wealthy families.
Wise also addressed the fact that
medical students are often discour
aged from working in underserved
communities because of the lack of
available resource s, even if they ini
tially enter medicine for the sake of
helping less-fortunate patients. If
they develop an intense interest in a
field like invasive cardiology while in
school, they must sacrifice the pur
suit of this passion if they wish to
work in those underserved commu
nities, he said.
Wise argued that this should not
present a problem, as the fort most
purpose of the medical institution
should be to provide equal health
care solutions to all. Some of these
solutions will be high-tech and some
will be low-tech, he said, but techno
logical costs should be a largely irrel
evant factor. According to Wise, so
cial justice should be doctors' fore
most priority.

The purpose of medical care
[...] is to uncouple poverty
from its implications.
PAUL WISE,
Child Health Professor

"The purpose of medical care in
underserved communities is to un
couple poverty from its implica
tions" he said. "The dual struggle of
the efficacy of medical methods and
that of social justice will always be in
extricably linked, and the lexicon of
medicine does speak and will always
speak to social equity."
