It just wouldn't be another Stanford-Arizona State meeting if it

didn't come down to the
last minute.
In last year's Pac-10
Tournament final, Stan
ford jumped out early and
had to fend off a late surge
from Arizona State. ITiis
time, the No. 7 Cardinal
roared back from an 11-
point halftime deficit to
win 60-56 on ASU's home
court yesterday. The in

— who had 16 points,
eight rebounds, five assists, and three blocks — and senior guard
Candice Wiggins (18 points, four steals) fueled Stanford's comeback.
"It's always a battle," Wiggins told Fox Sports Net after the game.
"Their whole team plays so hard, and they have a great coach and a
great system."
Stanford (16-3.6-2 Pacific-10 Conference) had the ball and was
protecting a 57-53 lead with 40 seconds left when Wiggins committed
an offensive foul while trying to corral the inbound pass. Arizona
State's Briann January took advantage, coming off a screen to hit a
three, making it 57-56.
ASU (11-7.5-2 Pac-10) fouled freshman forward Kayla Pedersen
on the next possession, and Pedersen could only hit one free throw,
giving the Sun Devils a chance to tie with the score at 58-56.
But the Stanford defense did its best imitation of a goal-line stand
on the next possession. Appel and then Wiggins blocked two consec
utive Sun Devil lay-up attempts with 12 seconds left, before forcing
January to stretch to avoid contact on the final missed attempt.

Senior guard Candice Wiggins and No. 7 Stanford fought past Arizona State last night,
using a second half comeback to defeat the Sun Devils 60-56 in Tempe, Ariz.
Stanford freshman Jeannette Pohlen collected
the rebound and stroked home two foul shots im
mediately after to ice the 60-56 victory.
Down 31-20 at the half, things were looking up
almost immediately for the Cardinal in the second
period. Appel lost her handle in the key.but the ball
bounced right to Wiggins, who buried a straight
away three-pointer.
"Candice is a warrior," Stanford coachTara Van-
Derveer said. "When we need big plays she makes
them."
That big play keyed a 17-7 run to put Stanford
back in the driver's seat at 39-38. the Cardinal's first
lead since 3-2.
The Cardinal continued to put on the pressure
and expand its lead to as much six points at 53-47,
thanks to a series of baskets against contact.
Wiggins. Pedersen. and junior forward Jil
lian Harmon all made shots after being fouled
in the second half to open up and-one opportu
nities.
Although only Wiggins hit her free throw. Har
mon and Pedersen both atoned for their misses:
I larmon rebounded Pedersen's miss with five min
utes left, and the freshman eventually laid the ball
in at the end of the possession to make it a 47-42
game.
Wiggins said that Stanford did not have to make
a huge adjustment in the second half; the change

just came as a few shots began to fall — the Cardi
nal shot 50 percent (IMor-32) from the field in the
final 20 minutes.
"It was just the basic things," Wiggins said. "We
weren't hitting our shots. We started hitting our
shots [in the second half] and really opened things
U P-
When the offense was not clicking. Stanford s
work on the other end of the floor kept the game in
hand.The Cardinal forced the Sun Devils into three
shot-clock violations in the game and completely
shut down ASU as the comeback began.
Arizona State shot just 5-for-23 (21.7 percent)
from the field in the second half.
The Sun Devils were punishing Stanford in the
first half, though, racing out to a lead as the Cardi
nal missed shot after shot. Stanford only had 10
points with 7:36 left in the period.
Appel managed to keep the Cardinal in the
game, with eight points in the opening half.
"There is no one I've ever played with who com
pares to Jayne," Wiggins said. "She is so talented
and so competitive."
Appel played the entire game despite having to
deal with a rotation of ASU posts, and was Stan
ford's bread and butter on offense, going 8-for-12
from the field.
