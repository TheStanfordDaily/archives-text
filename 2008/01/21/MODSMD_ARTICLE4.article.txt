It just wouldn't be another Stanford-Arizona State meeting if it

didn't come down to the
last minute.
In last year's Pac-10
Tournament final, Stan
ford jumped out early and
had to fend off a late surge
from Arizona State. ITiis
time, the No. 7 Cardinal
roared back from an 11-
point halftime deficit to
win 60-56 on ASU's home
court yesterday. The in

— who had 16 points,
eight rebounds, five assists, and three blocks — and senior guard
Candice Wiggins (18 points, four steals) fueled Stanford's comeback.
"It's always a battle," Wiggins told Fox Sports Net after the game.
"Their whole team plays so hard, and they have a great coach and a
great system."
Stanford (16-3.6-2 Pacific-10 Conference) had the ball and was
protecting a 57-53 lead with 40 seconds left when Wiggins committed
an offensive foul while trying to corral the inbound pass. Arizona
State's Briann January took advantage, coming off a screen to hit a
three, making it 57-56.
ASU (11-7.5-2 Pac-10) fouled freshman forward Kayla Pedersen
on the next possession, and Pedersen could only hit one free throw,
giving the Sun Devils a chance to tie with the score at 58-56.
But the Stanford defense did its best imitation of a goal-line stand
on the next possession. Appel and then Wiggins blocked two consec
utive Sun Devil lay-up attempts with 12 seconds left, before forcing
January to stretch to avoid contact on the final missed attempt.
