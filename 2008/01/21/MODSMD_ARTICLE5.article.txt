to attack the basket."

"We played the second half,"
coach Trent Johnson said. "That was

good to see. We were struggling the
first half in all phases... But in the sec

shots and |on] defense we turned it
up a notch and we dominated the
glass."
Second-year Arizona State coach
I lerb Sendek had his squad ready and
motivated on the defensive end to
start the game. The difference in the
second half, he said, was rebounding.
Stanford's turnaround was "clear
ly a function of them just annihilating
us on the backboard," Sendek said.
"In addition to that, they played ex
cellent defense and really whipped us
in every way. 1 thought they were in
credibly physical and really beat us
up — they took it to us in the second
half."
The Sun Devils also committed
seven turnovers to Stanford's three
in the second half.
While Lopez and Goods provided
the biggest scoring boost after the
break, the Stanford reserves — in

eluding senior forward Taj Finger and
sophomore Landry Fields — helped
buoy the stalwart defensive stand
that made the difference in the sec

everybody," Johnson said. "That
group came in and gave us a spark."

"We're right back in the hunt,"
Goods said. "We've just got to take it
one game at a time, keep getting win
after win. It's a long season."
