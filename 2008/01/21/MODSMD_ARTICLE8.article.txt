Want to fly American Airlines for
free? Consider a campus represen
tative position, whose benefits in
clude business and marketing experience in
addition to special offers, discounts and

free merchandise.
Organizations such as Google, Mi
crosoft, Apple. Teach for America,
Uloop. American Airlines, Mountain
Dew and Foundations for Educations
(f4ed) hire students to market their
products and publicize their campaigns
through flyers, emails and information
sessions.

"I am like a cheerleader for Uloop", said
Kim Anderson MO, who works for the col
lege exchange Web site that employs 120
campus representatives from universities
across the country. Her main job is to get stu
dents excited about the site and get the word
out at Stanford.
Companies often give campus represen
tatives a lot of freedom to organize events in
the way that they choose.
The American Airlines campus represen
tatives have organized various events at
football and basketball games and spon
sored Habitat's Run for Humanity In No
vember. they hid 250 envelopes containing

flight discounts around campus
for students to find.
The Mountain Dew cam
pus representatives held vari
ous sampling events through
out campus and organized a

campuswide competition to create Moun
tain Dew related products to win cash prizes.
The Apple representatives throw launch
parties and have been involved with Dance
Marathon and other regular Stanford
events.
These events aim to attract loyal, lifelong
customers. "American Airlines has identi
fied our demographic as a key demographic
moving forward." said campus representa
tive Peter Finlayson '07, who enjoys free
American Airlines tickets. "As we graduate
and go out into the world, we are going to be
the next generation of business and world
leaders. By appealing to college students
now. hopefully we can secure their loyalty in
the future."
Recruitment is another important part of
a campus representative's job. "The main

job of campus reps is to recruit employees
from the student body," said Barbara Mazi
na '09. an f4ed representative.
Willy Chu '08, a campus representative
for Mountain Dew. said that his job some
times faces administrative obstacles.
"There's a lot of red tape involved when
marketing for a corporation unrelated to
any Stanford student group." he said. "Find
ing ways around the policies was a road
block unexpectedly added to our load."
A lot of the campus reps become in
volved in these companies because they
have been loyal customers of the products.
Jeff Seibert '08, a campus representative for
Apple, said he had always loved the compa
ny's products and had wanted to work for
them since the beginning of high school.
Some students choose to continue work
ing with these companies after graduation.
"There are lots of positions available at
Uloop after and before graduation for those
who are passionate about the Web site," said

Anderson.
Finlayson also works as a cam
pus representative for the Stanford
Alumni Association (SAA).
"1 have watched my role at the
SAA grow and develop to the point
where now I am helping develop
their marketing strategy for the fu
ture and helping them incorporate
the latest online tools into their
daily operations in many depart
ments," he said. "It's been tremen
dously rewarding for me and amaz
ingly valuable for them."
Campus reps are trained in gen
eral marketing strategies, ideal
times to advertise and what kind of
attitudes to display to people about
the company. Such a job provides
these students marketing and busi
ness experience much earlier in
their college careers.
"The experience gave me an ini
tial exposure to marketing and
brand building, which has proved
valuable," Chu said.
Moreover, as Mountain Dew
representative Jerod Alrich "08 said,
"It is a great way to get to know
people and it looks good on your re
sume."
