Every day we read The Stanford Daily, but who are the people
who bring you the news, film reviews, sports analysis, and
everything else you read in the paper and on line? Now we can
have a roundtable conversation with journalists and editors to
find out how they investigate stories, cover events, meet
intense deadlines, write with an engaging style, and more.

Stanford Daily, former Editor-in-Chief and President of The
Daily, and winner of the James Robinson Award for Student
Journalists at Stanford.
Julie Klein has worked at The Daily as a staff writer for news, a
news desk editor, and this fall she worked as the managing
editor of news.
Daniel Novinson has been the football and men's basketball
beat writer, managing editor of sports and a news desk editor,
and he received the James Robinson Award for Student
Journalists at Stanford.
