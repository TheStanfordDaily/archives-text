## Editorial Board Status update: Stanford is politically engaged 
### 
Politics and poking? Scrahulous and
South Carolina debates? I"he popular
social networking site Facehook.com
has been on the vanguard of teen-friendly
initiatives, attempting to keep American
youths' collective status "politically en
gaged." Facebook should be commended
for incorporating political issues onto its
walls, and we young adults should take ad
vantage of such easy access to political in
formation and become seriously engaged in
this critically important political season.
Socially- and politically-conscious third
party Facebook applications such as "Caus
es" and "Greenbook" have garnered a great
deal of user support, drumming up 105,125
and 5,317 daily active users, respectively But
perhaps the most popular example of a polit
ical Facebook application is the revamped
"U.S. Politics," which was designed by Face
book in partnership with ABC News, specifi
cally for the 2(X)8 presidential election.
Regarding its U.S. Politics application,
Facebook itself stated, "This first-ever part
nership seeks to empower voters with more
information, both by bringing issues from
the campaign trail to their lives in real-time
and by surfacing the ideas and opinions of
the people that matter to them the most.To
gether, ABC News and Facebook aim to
mobilize active political engagement."
According to a Facebook press release,
over one million users have added the appli
cation — fewer than "Super Wall" but more
than "Compare People" — and nearly a
third of those users have participated in at
least one online debate.The U.S. Politics ap
plication allows users to learn about candi
dates' positions, demonstrate their support
for candidates, debate different issues, re
ceive continuously-updated political news
and video from ABC's political news team,
and participate in polls on questions ranging
from, "Do John McCain's views on immi
gration make you more or less likely to vote
for him?" to "Which of these Democratic
candidates do you most NOT want to be
president?" (To see the answers, log on to
Facebook and add the U.S. Politics applica
tion.) The application's "Soundboard" fea
ture is the political equivalent of the every
day "status," and runs the political gamut
from. "John Doe is thinking that Obama is a
great poet, but not a great presidential can
didate yet," to "Jane Doe is shuddering at
the thought of a Democrat winning in No
vember."
The collaboration between Facebook and
ABC News was highly visible during the tel
evised New Hampshire debates, which were
sponsored by Facebook, ABC News and
New 1 lampshire news station WMUR. Face

book activity was monitored throughout the
debates, and moderator Charles Gibson
formed some of his questions based on issues
debated on Facebook. Similarly, correspon
dent Bianna Golodryga analyzed notable
comments and input from the site — befit
ting their disproportionate online support.
Sen. Barack Obama (D-lU.) and Represen
tative Ron Paul (R-Texas) emerged the clear
winners. Like the earlier CNN/YouTube de
bates, the New Hampshire debates further
helped to usher in a new kind of organic po
litical discourse, where online — and espe
cially young — users can greatly shape as
pects of a campaign.
St) why get involved? What motivation is
there to spend less time tagging photos or
playing "Snake" and more time debating
key issues and connecting with fellow sup
porters? TTie answer is empowerment, en
gagement and information.
Students can join the glut of Facebook
political groups,connect with other support
ers, change their profile pictures to pictures
of the candidate they support, educate
themselves about the economy, the Iraq War
and climate change and hone their under
standing of candidates. In addition, the
Facebook Events feature enables the easy
coordination of voter registration drives,
canvassing operations and rallies.
A recent Daily column pointed out the
large number of Stanford students who neg
lect to vote,citing a lack of information about
candidates and issues ["Deserving to be apa
thetic?." Jan. 21 ]. Political Science Prof, and
Senior 1 loover Fellow Morris Fiorina defines
and discusses this concept of "information
cost," in his book "The New American
Democracy," as "the time and mental effort
required to absorb and store information,
whether from conversations, personal expe
riences or the media." Many citizens remain
uninformed about political issues because it
requires a sizable effort to be informed, and
for many, such information appears to have
little bearing on their daily lives.
Facebook's easy access to a wealth of in
formation. however, reduces the informa
tion cost of becoming informed, and thus
(hopefully) can politically engage those stu
dents who are more likely to draw graffiti on
a friend's wall than read about politics in
The New York Times.
Facebook's political applications have
turned the oft-flirtatious Web site into a spot
for important political information and dis
cussion among the college-aged. With an in
creasing number of students logged into po
litical dialogs via Facebook, hopefully our
collective status will continue to become
more and more politically engaged.
