## Removing articles from the Web 
### 
Members of the Stanford Cycling Team
appeared on Nov. 2K at the weekly
Graduate Student Council (CiSC)
meeting to discuss a proposed loan to the team
from Club Sports.The team had gotten a really
good deal on some sponsored bikes, which they
planned to buy at a discount and then sell at the
end of the season for profit. Ihey needed the
loan, from unused reserves, to pay for the initial
cost of the bikes [Note: the name of the profes
sional sponsor has been withheld from this story
to protect the Cycling Team's relationship with
the company.]
Staff writer Susana Montes '09, who covers
the weekly GSC meetings for The Daily, decid
ed that this was the most interesting part of the
meeting, so she wrote her article about the cy
cling team's request. Her article, which ap
peared the next day. described the team's re
quest and included financial details of the deal
that had been discussed at the meeting.
I he next day, cycling team member Samuel
Wilson, a graduate student in chemistry who
had spoken on behalf of the team at the CiSC
meeting, emailed Daily Rditor-in-Chief Nick
Parker "()8 asking that the financial details be
taken down from the online version of the arti
cle. 'Ihe reason. Wilson told Parker and later
confirmed to me. was that the team had signed
a non-disclosure agreement with the sponsor
ing cycling company, which had contacted the
team after the article appeared.
Parker initially edited out the financial de
tails from the online version of the article. After
being told by Wilson that this wasn't good

enough, he said, he eventually removed the en
tire article from Ihe Daily's Web site. Parker
said the team initially requested a printed re
traction as well, which he refused since he be
lieved'lhe Daily had not committed any wrong
doing in the article; eventually the team relent
ed. Wilson told me that the team was waiting for
what the biking company demanded, but "we
were never asked to request that The Daily pub
lish any level of retraction."
Ihe aftermath is that no retraction was pub
lished, but the article is no longer on The Daily's
Web site. Wilson said that the reputation of the
team with the sponsor was damaged, but the
company let the situation rest once the online
version was removed. I only found out about
this situation because I happened to be copied
on the initial email to Parker. (Parker later told
me that he regrets having removed the article.)
So. what should have been done in this situ
ation?
First. Montes' article itself was finely done.
The GSC posts recordings of its meetings on
line, which corroborate Montes' reporting: the
crucial information she reported is all in the
recording of the meeting. CiSC meetings are
public, and Montes can clearly be heard identi
fying herself at the beginning of the meeting as
a reporter for Ihe Daily; a minute later, the
three cycling team members identify them
selves. The Daily was right not to print a retrac
tion, since there was nothing wrong with the
storv.
Newspapers withhold publication
of information all the time. It's hard
not to sympathize with the cycling
team in this situation. Had they con
tacted The Daily before the article ap
peared, explaining,"Look, we messed
up and shouldn't have revealed this in
formation, and if you publish it, it's re
ally going to hurt the team," it certain
ly would have been reasonable for The
Daily to withhold those details? In such
a situation, the cost to the cycling team
for an innocent mistake would have
greatly outweighed any minor public
interest in these details. (There are, of
course, many situations where the
public interest would outweigh any
costs of publication.)
But the article had been published.
It had already appeared in 10,000 print
editions and been online for many
hours. To remove an article, after the
fact, from the Web edition without ex
traordinary circumstances and when
there was no wrongdoing or error on

The Daily's part sets a dangerous
precedent. The Web site is an official
record of the paper. It should not be al
tered except in extreme circum
stances, and when it is altered, these
changes must be done transparently.
The Internet makes things much
more complicated. Fifteen years ago, if
an embarrassing article had appeared
in The Daily, it would have been seen
in several thousand print copies, but
within a few days, only the most dili
gent researcher would bother to find
the print archives of old issues. Now,
any article can be easily found with the
click of a mouse. On the one hand, this
is great, since the Web can serve as a
permanent, accessible archive, but this
accessibility can also make controver
sial articles more troublesome. (It is
unlikely that the cycling company
would have ever noticed the article
had it only appeared in the print edi
tion.) This problem isn't at all unique
to The Daily. "The newspaper industry
really hasn't figured out a policy in this
area," Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser, a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors, told me.
A quick utilitarian calculus might
seem to justify removing the cycling ar

tide from the Web site â€” I'd be sur
prised i( a huge number of people
would have read the relatively minor
article on the GSC, and the presence of
the story online threatened to do seri
ous financial damage to the cycling
team. I certainly don't envy the difficult
position in which this puts an editor-in
chief But a newspaper needs to stand in
the public trust, acting transparently
and consistently.The danger of the slip
pery slope of removing articles from
the Web site is too high to justify its
doing.
***
Barring unusual circumstances, this will
be my last public editor column until the
next volume of The Daily begins on Feb.
1. I'd like to thank outgoing editor-in
chief Nick Parker for his incredible open
ness, honesty and humility throughout
my discussions with him over the course
of this volume.
