## Removing articles from the Web

Members of the Stanford Cycling Team
appeared on Nov. 2K at the weekly
Graduate Student Council (CiSC)
meeting to discuss a proposed loan to the team
from Club Sports.The team had gotten a really
good deal on some sponsored bikes, which they
planned to buy at a discount and then sell at the
end of the season for profit. Ihey needed the
loan, from unused reserves, to pay for the initial
cost of the bikes [Note: the name of the profes
sional sponsor has been withheld from this story
to protect the Cycling Team's relationship with
the company.]
Staff writer Susana Montes '09, who covers
the weekly GSC meetings for The Daily, decid
ed that this was the most interesting part of the
meeting, so she wrote her article about the cy
cling team's request. Her article, which ap
peared the next day. described the team's re
quest and included financial details of the deal
that had been discussed at the meeting.
I he next day, cycling team member Samuel
Wilson, a graduate student in chemistry who
had spoken on behalf of the team at the CiSC
meeting, emailed Daily Rditor-in-Chief Nick
Parker "()8 asking that the financial details be
taken down from the online version of the arti
cle. 'Ihe reason. Wilson told Parker and later
confirmed to me. was that the team had signed
a non-disclosure agreement with the sponsor
ing cycling company, which had contacted the
team after the article appeared.
Parker initially edited out the financial de
tails from the online version of the article. After
being told by Wilson that this wasn't good

enough, he said, he eventually removed the en
tire article from Ihe Daily's Web site. Parker
said the team initially requested a printed re
traction as well, which he refused since he be
lieved'lhe Daily had not committed any wrong
doing in the article; eventually the team relent
ed. Wilson told me that the team was waiting for
what the biking company demanded, but "we
were never asked to request that The Daily pub
lish any level of retraction."
Ihe aftermath is that no retraction was pub
lished, but the article is no longer on The Daily's
Web site. Wilson said that the reputation of the
team with the sponsor was damaged, but the
company let the situation rest once the online
version was removed. I only found out about
this situation because I happened to be copied
on the initial email to Parker. (Parker later told
me that he regrets having removed the article.)
So. what should have been done in this situ
ation?
First. Montes' article itself was finely done.
The GSC posts recordings of its meetings on
line, which corroborate Montes' reporting: the
crucial information she reported is all in the
recording of the meeting. CiSC meetings are
public, and Montes can clearly be heard identi
fying herself at the beginning of the meeting as
a reporter for Ihe Daily; a minute later, the
three cycling team members identify them
selves. The Daily was right not to print a retrac
tion, since there was nothing wrong with the
storv.
