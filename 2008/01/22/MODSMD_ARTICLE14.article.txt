# Fish out of Water
## How to win money (without really trying) 
### 
There are few times when you regret fi
nally being able to smoke like a chim
ney, drink like a fish, and drive like an.
um. licensed driver.
One of those times, however, is when it's a
good $20 cheaper to be a sprightly 18-and
under youth-pass wielding skier.
Having spent most of my Lake Tahoe ski
trip with a teenage lift ticket attached to my
snow pants, 1 knew that there had to be less
humiliating ways to get more bang for my
buck. And so 1 decided to do things the legal
way — on the floors of a South Lake Tahoe
casino.
After convincing my roommate Ruth to
tag along on what would be both of our first
gambling experiences, we headed down to
Tahoe's version of the Vegas strip, mid-Sun
day afternoon. From the myriad choices, we
settled on the prestigious Montßleu — in
part because of the name, but mostly because

it had free parking.
Having done a quick loop around the
floor, we started at the roulette table, which
tends to favor luck over skill. The woman be
hind the table was also the only one in the
room deigning to make eye contact with us.
1 knew 1 was in for the big bucks when one
of the five $1 chips I put in for my first round
produced an 11:1 return.
But after a few more rounds, my earnings
had dropped to $4. All of Ruth's money was
long gone.

We decided to move on to the blackjack
table to see what real gambling is all about.
We walked around the room for a bit until we
ended up standing awkwardly behind a table.
There, a female dealer was chatting up a mid
dle-aged man who was dropping down hun
dred dollar bets at her table.
"Have you ever played before?" she
asked us finally.
When we replied that we hadn't, she sug
gested we move on and try our luck some
where else.
Sufficiently humiliated, we scouted the re
maining options we had left. The size of the
crowd in front of the craps table made it clear
that this too was out of our league. A lap
around the rest of the casino left us with our
only other option: Let It Ride.
