# Fish out of Water
## How to win money (without really trying) 
### 
There are few times when you regret fi
nally being able to smoke like a chim
ney, drink like a fish, and drive like an.
um. licensed driver.
One of those times, however, is when it's a
good $20 cheaper to be a sprightly 18-and
under youth-pass wielding skier.
Having spent most of my Lake Tahoe ski
trip with a teenage lift ticket attached to my
snow pants, 1 knew that there had to be less
humiliating ways to get more bang for my
buck. And so 1 decided to do things the legal
way — on the floors of a South Lake Tahoe
casino.
After convincing my roommate Ruth to
tag along on what would be both of our first
gambling experiences, we headed down to
Tahoe's version of the Vegas strip, mid-Sun
day afternoon. From the myriad choices, we
settled on the prestigious Montßleu — in
part because of the name, but mostly because

it had free parking.
Having done a quick loop around the
floor, we started at the roulette table, which
tends to favor luck over skill. The woman be
hind the table was also the only one in the
room deigning to make eye contact with us.
1 knew 1 was in for the big bucks when one
of the five $1 chips I put in for my first round
produced an 11:1 return.
But after a few more rounds, my earnings
had dropped to $4. All of Ruth's money was
long gone.

We decided to move on to the blackjack
table to see what real gambling is all about.
We walked around the room for a bit until we
ended up standing awkwardly behind a table.
There, a female dealer was chatting up a mid
dle-aged man who was dropping down hun
dred dollar bets at her table.
"Have you ever played before?" she
asked us finally.
When we replied that we hadn't, she sug
gested we move on and try our luck some
where else.
Sufficiently humiliated, we scouted the re
maining options we had left. The size of the
crowd in front of the craps table made it clear
that this too was out of our league. A lap
around the rest of the casino left us with our
only other option: Let It Ride.

has revealed what we probably
could have guessed from the very
beginning: the game's slow pace and
option for the players to withdraw
some of their bets makes it popular
with, "older players and table game
neophytes." Because slower games
often mean fewer tips for the dealer,
the game is nicknamed "Let It Die."
In Let It Ride, as in roulette, play
ers compete against the house rather
than against other players. Needless
to say, the dealer was thrilled to en
tice two visibly intimidated 21-year
old girls into sitting at his table.
With a thirty-something couple
on our left and an older Russian cou
ple chain-smoking on our right, we
quickly learned that the game was 99
percent luck, and one percent the
casino making money off our Si
bonus bets.
In the first round, beginners' luck
was on our side, and a pair of queens
gave us a 2:1 payout on our $10 bet.
Feeling pretty pleased with our
selves, we saddled in for another

round... and lost.
At this point, it looked like there
were two clearly emerging options.
Sitting at the damned Let It Ride
table winning and losing money to
the point that we would most likely
end up even, or leaving on our own
terms (and beating the Tahoe traf
fic).
We chose the latter but decided
to make one last stop at the roulette
table on our way out.
One round in. and we had already
picked up $11 for hitting the right
row. In the following round, a $ 1 chip
on lucky number 33 produced a 35:1
payoff.
We decided enough was enough,
and headed to the cashier to collect
our earnings. Having put in $40 be
tween the two of us, we came out
with $76 dollars in hand.
1 had squandered my $20 earn
ings by the time 1 got home on $16
worth of gas mileage and $4 worth of
pizza. A gas station bag of Teddy
Grahams put me back in the red.
That is, at least until my next trip
to Vegas.
