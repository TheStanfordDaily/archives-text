# Pleading Inanity
## Requiem for our dreams

As I look around the Law School, I see
too many people win) shouldn't he
here, lliey should he philosophers,
they should he novelists and at least 11 of us
(otherwise known as the Acappellants, the
Law School's premier vocal sensation)
should be off-off Broadway stars, if not off-
Broadway. Yet more than ( >() percent of us
will, upon graduation, take our rightful place
as Summer Associate #257 at Law Firm
"Name & Name," "Name, Name & Name" or
"Name. Name, Name, Name & Name."
To be fair, I'm not overly optimistic about
the chances of our unconventional life aspira
tions bearing fruit. As the great scholar Billie-
Joe Armstrong and the fictional Bad Santa
have both infamously said, "Wish in one
hand, s|p|it in the other, and see which gets
filled first." Due to our extreme, communal
risk-aversion, we law students even try to con
gratulate ourselves for foregoing the vagaries

of personal fame in the name of pursuing jus

Kaiser Permanente.
Yep. Abandoning our dreams is basically a
moral obligation, and we have done our duty
splendidly. We should probably just stop
thinking about this issue and forget where we
buried it.
In other news, how 'bout that election in
Kenya, the 1.5 inch Macbook and Citibank's
worst quarter in history? Never saw those
coming.

Wait, what's that noise I hear? A faint
thumping, no, a beating, a pulse of a faint hope
that cannot die. Our dreams,they're still alive!
Maybe pursuing one's artistic ambitions is
just a question of costs and possible benefits.
Let's take my personal fantasy, for example,
to be a stand-up comedian and/or in Cirque
tlu Soleil. For the sake of argument, let's as
sume that if 1 dropped out of school, tied Palo
Alto and devoted myself to humorous per
formances, I could make a decent living and
possibly even get a big break and become the
next Jayram Seinfeld. If, instead, 1 decided to
finish school, let's assume I could snag a mid
level bureaucratic job at the UN.
What's the ol' CBA look like? Well, if I
opted for comedy, I'd be leaving a stable job
and a routine lifestyle of concomitant pres
tige and social benefits. On a larger scale, so-
