# Pleading Inanity
## Requiem for our dreams

"Name & Name," "Name, Name & Name" or
"Name. Name, Name, Name & Name."
To be fair, I'm not overly optimistic about
the chances of our unconventional life aspira
tions bearing fruit. As the great scholar Billie-
Joe Armstrong and the fictional Bad Santa
have both infamously said, "Wish in one
hand, s|p|it in the other, and see which gets
filled first." Due to our extreme, communal
risk-aversion, we law students even try to con
gratulate ourselves for foregoing the vagaries

of personal fame in the name of pursuing jus
tice for the underdogs like Accenture and
Kaiser Permanente.
Yep. Abandoning our dreams is basically a
moral obligation, and we have done our duty
splendidly. We should probably just stop
thinking about this issue and forget where we
buried it.
In other news, how 'bout that election in
Kenya, the 1.5 inch Macbook and Citibank's
worst quarter in history? Never saw those
coming.

Wait, what's that noise I hear? A faint
thumping, no, a beating, a pulse of a faint hope
that cannot die. Our dreams,they're still alive!
Maybe pursuing one's artistic ambitions is
just a question of costs and possible benefits.
Let's take my personal fantasy, for example,
to be a stand-up comedian and/or in Cirque
tlu Soleil. For the sake of argument, let's as
sume that if 1 dropped out of school, tied Palo
Alto and devoted myself to humorous per
formances, I could make a decent living and
possibly even get a big break and become the
next Jayram Seinfeld. If, instead, 1 decided to
finish school, let's assume I could snag a mid
level bureaucratic job at the UN.
What's the ol' CBA look like? Well, if I
opted for comedy, I'd be leaving a stable job
and a routine lifestyle of concomitant pres
tige and social benefits. On a larger scale, so-


Vishnu \ i
Sridharan
ciety would be losing one mid-level
UN cog. On the plus side, 1 think I'd
be a happier person, which would
benefit my family, my kids, neighbors
and pet monkeys. The societal bene
fit: one more pretty crappy stand-up
comedian.
So why have I done what 1 done
did? Because I'm a crippled coward?
Because I'm a loser lemming? Be
cause the best bit I've written in years
involves Jamie Lynn Spears walking
into a bar and juggling with a long
faced horse that tells 'Not!' jokes?
Honestly, I'm not sure it matters.
We act as we do for a variety of con
scious, subconscious and uncon
scious reasons, and explaining our
behavior via core motivations is at
best inane and at worst incoherent.
When all is said and done, I'm in law
school now, and my mediocre
comedic talents are consigned to

Paul Gauguin — the famous
painter who, by my understanding,
painted some paintings some time
ago that influenced the way other
painters painted their paintings —
famously abandoned his job and
family to focus exclusively on his art.
As a result, the lives of his wife and
children fell apart — two of his sons
died before their time and the rest
continued on with only basic priva
tions. Now. you might say to yourself,
"Wow, Gauguin was a [h]ick." Well,
maybe he was, but at the same time I
think we can admire the part of him
that was willing to pursue deep
meaning and creative expression re
gardless of the cost. Even the best of
us are usually unwilling to take so
bold a move, even though we would
sacrifice far less in doing so.
