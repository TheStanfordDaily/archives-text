## Using abortion 
### 
If the well-tended patch of grass oppo
site the Stanford Bookstore is pierced
with white crosses today, we once again
find ourselves treated to a misuse of histo
ry and analogy. For several years, on the
Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade* the
landmark 1973 Supreme Court case on
abortion rights, a group called Stanford
Students for Life (SSFL) has shown itself
profoundly aware that their display of
crosses connoted a literal graveyard. 'ITiis
awareness made their display all the more
dismaying.
In anyone conscious of wars past and
present, a peaceful bright green field stud
ded with lines of crosses must evoke mili
tary cemeteries harboring soldiers actually
killed while serving their countries — like
the 3.929 Americans killed so far in Iraq.
SSFL has exploited this tragic reality to
shock us with what they consider a simple
absolute: the killing of human beings.
Of course anyone has the right to organ
ize a demonstration on the question of
abortion. The Daily has correctly referred
to "fetuses...legally aborted" since 1973.
hut debate will go on endlessly about both
elements in that phrase: the status of fetus

es, especially for months before the "quick
ening," and the legality of what opponents
label a moral evil.
What we deplore is the use of false and
sensational analogies, which are a poor way
to "educate people." as Students for Life
claim to be doing in simulating a military
cemetery. Ken Burns' recent documentary
should provide enough detail to see an ab
solute difference between the deaths of
soldiers or the slaughter of Jewish babies,
on the one hand, and on the other hand,
mothers, parents and families, often mak
ing vital choices to complete an education
or care for their children or their health —
choices supported by a democratic majori
ty standing for the privacy of women's
rights. By the same right, women may
choose to entrust a newborn to adoption.
Analogy-mongering often drives togeth
er opposites. Entering "abortion" and
"Holocaust" on Google turns up countless
sites that flaunt this dubious connection. An
active organization called "Survivors" ap
peals to "Survivors of the Abortion Holo
caust," and elsewhere online you can buy
your "Abortion Holocaust Baseball Jersey."
We also find deplorable, for that matter, the

term "Silent Holocaust" applied by some
voices in Orthodox Judaism to intermar
riage — or any misuse of the massive organ
ized murder of one group by another to con
demn personal choices.
Both of us signing this opinion piece
grew up during the war —and as it hap
pens. both of us are teaching courses on the
Holocaust at Stanford this year. SSFL
claims that its cemetery is for "victims of
Roe," but as we know from the Nazis and
other totalitarian tyrants, victims have per
petrators.
Do so-called "pro-life" advocates mean to
brand women, who have various life-cherish
ing reasons to undertake a legal abortion, as
killers?
At last Saturday's "Walk for Life" in San
Francisco, where SSFL was represented,
posters announced "Peace / Life / Love /
Babies —as if these were not core con
cerns of the pro-choice majority. Surely
many if not most Christians would deplore
the contempt for pregnant women implied
by tying them to crosses in a cemetery. One
year, with irony, we asked someone staffing
