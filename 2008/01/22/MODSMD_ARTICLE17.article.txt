## Obama denounces Bill Clinton 
### LARRY MARGASAK THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - Barack Obama challenged Bill
Clinton's truthfulness Monday in a deepening feud
with the husband of Obama's Democratic presiden
tial rival.
Obama's rebuke of the former president, who is
still extremely popular with Democrats, came on the
holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., when both
Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton focused on the civil
rights leader.
In an interview on ABC, Obama twice questioned
Bill Clinton's veracity.
"I have to say just broadly, you know, the former
president, who I think all of us have a lot of regard
for, has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a
level that 1 think is pretty troubling. You know, he
continues to make statements that aren't supported
by the facts, whether it's about my record of opposi
tion to the war in Iraq, or our approach to organizing
in Las Vegas," Obama said on "Good Morning
America."
"You know, this has become a habit," he said.
"And one of the things that 1 think we're going to
have to do is to directly confront Bill Clinton when
he's not making statements that are factually accu
rate."
'Hie former president has accused Obama of ex
aggerating his anti-war record und handing out un
deserved praise to Republicans. Clinton said he per
sonally witnessed Obama's union forces intimidat
ing Nevada caucus voters and said an Obama radio
ad suggested how Democrats could keep votes from
his wife.
During an event honoring King in his hometown.
Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, an Obama backer,
made a not-so-subtle pitch for Obama at historic
Ebenezer Baptist Church â€” right in front of the for
mer president.
"We are at the cusp of turning the impossible into
reality," Franklin said. "Yes, this is reality, not a fanta
sy, or a fairy tale."
While the largely black crowd erupted in ap
plause, Bill Clinton sat with his hands clasped in
front of him. He has been criticized in the black com
munity for casting aspects of Obama's candidacy as
"a fairy tale."
When Clinton spoke, he toned down his remarks
about the campaign and never mentioned Obama by

name when saying Democrats had "bad choices" in
the party's nomination race.
In an interview that aired Monday on NBC's
"Today" show. Bill Clinton agreed that King would
be excited about Obama's candidacy.
"A great speaker, a smart man, someone who
loves our country," the former president said of the
Illinois senator.
Clinton said he and his daughter, Chelsea, wit
nessed voter intimidation in Nevada, prior to the
caucuses that his wife won on Saturday. He said a
representation of the Culinary Workers Union,
which endorsed Obama, was "following along be
hind us going up to everybody... saying.'lf you're not
gonna vote for our guy we're gonna give you a sched
ule tomorrow so you can't be there.'"
The union denied engaging in any intimidation.
The Las Vegas Sun concluded it depended on who
was talking. Its column, by Michael Mishak, said
Clinton's campaign and her supporters claim the
union intimidated a member into caucusing for
Obama while the member herself called the incident
more of a misunderstanding.
Bill Clinton has criticized an Obama radio spot,
saying: "There's a radio ad up in the northern part of
Nevada telling Republicans that they ought to just
register as Democrats for a day so they can beat
Hillary and go out and be Republicans next week
and vote in the primary Doesn't sound like the new
politics to me."
Obama's ad did say Nevada independents and
Republicans could switch their registration, but it
did not mention Hillary Clinton.
The former president also criticized Obama for
his comments about Republicans. He contended that
Obama said that "since 1992, the Republicans have
had all the good ideas.... I can't imagine any Democ
rat seeking the presidency would say they were the
party of new ideas for the last 15 years."
Obama did praise Republicans, but he criticized
them in the same comment:"l think it's fair to say the
Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long
chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the
sense that they were challenging conventional wis
dom. Now, you've heard it all before. You look at the
economic policies when they're being debated
among the presidential candidates and it's all tax
cuts. Well, you know, we've done that, we tried it.
That's not really going to solve our energy problems,
for example. So, some of it's the times."
