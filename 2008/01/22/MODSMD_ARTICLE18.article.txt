## White separatists hold rally in Jena, La. 
### MARY FOSTER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
JENA, La. - About 50 white sepa
ratists protested the Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday Monday in this tiny
town, whieh was thrust into the spot
light months ago by 20,000 demon
strators who claimed prosecutors
discriminated against blacks.
Police separated participants in
the "pro-majority" rally organized
by the Learned. Miss.-based Nation
alist Movement from a racially
mixed group of about 1 (X) counter
demonstrators outside the LaSalle
Parish Courthouse.There was no vi
olence and one arrest, a counter
demonstrator.
Chants of "No KKK" from the
mostly college-age counter-demon
strators were met with a chant from
the separatists that contained a
racial epithet.
At one point, dozens of state po
lice forced back about 10 people,
dressed in New Black Panther uni
forms, who had gathered around a
podium where the separatist
group's leader Richard Barrett was
to speak.
One man who broke away from
that group was arrested and booked
with battery on a police officer and
resisting arrest; authorities identi
fied him as William Winchester Jr. of
New Orleans and said he was a
member of the New Black Panthers.
Members of the group at the scene
declined to comment.
Race relations in Jena (popula
tion about 2.8(H)) have been in the
news ever since six black teenagers
were arrested in the beating of a
white classmate at Jena High School
in December 200b.
About 20.0(H) people peacefully
marched in support of the so-called
Jena Six in September, and Mon
day's demonstration was organized
in opposition to both the teenagers
and the King holiday.
Five of the black teens were orig
inally charged with attempted mur
der, leading to accusations that they
were being prosecuted harshly be
cause of their race. Charges have
since been reduced.
Critics of the prosecutor have
noted that months before the beat
ing, no charges were filed against
three other white students accused
of hanging nooses — seen as signs
of racial intimidation — in a tree at
the high school. The prosecutor has
said that the noose hangings, while
"abhorrent," violated no state law.
Many Jena residents said that
coverage of the controversy last
year unfairly portrayed them as
racists, and that Barrett's group
brought renewed unwanted atten
tion. Only when faced with a lawsuit

did the town drop a requirement
that the Nationalists post a $10,000
security bond for a permit.
Almost all the demonstrators
and counter-demonstrators ap
peared to be from outside of Jena.
"I'd like to see more people from
Jena here," said George Ferguson, a
local resident who wore a T-shirt
reading "Justice for Justin," refer
ring to Justin Barker, the white teen
beaten in the school attack. "I
haven't seen anyone else I know."
A few locals, black and white,
watched from the sidelines.
"I wanted to see what was going
on," I've heard a lot about it." said
Charles Bailey, a white 58-year-old
Jena resident. "It looks like a big
waste of my tax money."
Police from several organiza
tions, including Louisiana State Po
lice and at least three parish sheriff's
departments, were on hand. Snipers
staked out the roofs of buildings
across the street from the court
house.
Jena resident Dayna Brown, a
black woman who made a scrap
book on the September protest, had
her camera in hand Monday. She
said she was ready to see Jena's time
in the spotlight end.
"I'm hoping this is the last of it,"
Brown said. "Jena's not a bad place
to live if you're black or white. We'd
just all like to see things settle
down."
The Rev. A 1 Sharpton, an organ
izer of the September march,
preached at a Jena church Sunday
but was not among the counter
demonstrators; he said he had prior
commitments.
Some of the Nationalist support
ers were armed despite a call from
Barrett to leave guns behind.
Acting LaSalle Parish Sheriff
Scott Franklin told a father and son
from Tioga, about 30 miles from
Jena, to put away two shotguns.
Franklin allowed them to continue
to wear holstered sidearms, but Jena
Police Chief Paul Smith told David
Dupre Jr. and his father that they
would have to put away all weapons
during the march, under Louisiana
law.
"I'm here to protest black-on
white crime," David Dupre Sr., 53,
told reporters.
His 31-year-old son, at times
using racial slurs, said: "It's time for
us white folks to start getting some
of our rights back."
One of the Jena Six, Mychal Bell,
17, pleaded guilty in December in
juvenile court to second-degree bat
tery. A judge sentenced him to 18
months with credit for the 10
months he'd already served in jail.
Trials are pending for the others
charged.
