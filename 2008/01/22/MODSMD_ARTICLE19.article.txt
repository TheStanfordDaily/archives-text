### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team would have notched another tourna
ment sweep this weekend, had it not been
for UCLA's Riza Zalameda.
At the National Collegiate Tennis Clas
sic (NCTC) in Indian Wells, Calif, fresh
man Carolyn McVeigh repeatedly upset
some of the nation's top players in her Cin
derella run to the finals.
Sophomore Lindsay Burdette, who
also competed at the NCTC, lauded her
teammate's effort.
"I watched basically every single one of
her matches and they were unbelievable,"
Burdette said.
In the opening day of play, McVeigh
easily dispatched two Los Angeles oppo
nents: UCLA's Elizabeth Lumpkin and
Sarah Fansler of Southern California.
The next day, McVeigh came out strong
against two top opponents. She upset the
tournament's first seed, Maya Johansson
of Georgia Tech 6-4,6-2, and then defeat
ed USC's No. 1 player, Lindsay Nelson 6-
2,6-2.

Carolyn just took it to her."
On the final day. McVeigh fell in
the championship match 6-2. 6-3 to
UCLA's Zalameda.
"The last day, after playing two
matches on Saturday, Carolyn was a
tiny bit tired," Burdette said."But Za
lameda played unbelievably], Car
olyn had an awesome tournament."
Zalameda. a seasoned junior and
UCLA's No. 1 singles player, is
ranked 25th in the latest ITA polls.
McVeigh. in her first collegiate sea

son. is ranked 58th.
"Zalameda is a very talented and
experienced player." Burdette said.
"She's played pro tournaments since
she was really young, but when it
comes to pressure situations.she does
n't quite do as well. In NCAAs she
only won one singles match, but she's
still a very good player."
Zalameda defeated Burdette 7-5,6-
2 in the quarterfinals en route to the
championship. Despite her early exit,
Burdette is pleased with her game so
far.
"I definitely didn't go as far as I
would have liked,"she said."But I got
some awesome matches and I feel
like my strokes and ball striking are
right where 1 want [them] to be at this
point before we begin the season.

With more matches, the rest of it will
come."
McVeigh and Burdette also
teamed up in doubles, and advanced
to the semifinals.
They were again met by Zalameda,
playing with Tracy Lin of UCLA.The
Bruins prevailed in an 8-6 decision.
"The match that we did play ended
up being a really good match." Bur
dette said. "We had a ton of chances
and we definitely could have won. I
felt it was the first match [where] Car
olyn and 1 really meshed, figuring out
which balls go to whom. We worked
really well together."
Zalameda and Lin would eventu
ally win the doubles championships
along with Zalameda's singles title.
Overall, the NCTC proved to be

another learning experience for the
Cardinal squad.
"The tournament was really posi
tive. especially for the team, because
we proved that even our youngest
members on the team can compete
with the best," Burdette said.
This Friday. Stanford will open up
dual match play against UC Davis at
home. After a long fall season, the
Cardinal women are geared up for the
challenge.
"We're all raring and ready to go,"
Burdette said. "We're so ready to get
out there and work, starting with
Davis. There's nothing like dual
matches in tennis."
