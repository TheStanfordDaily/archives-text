## Study links price, enjoyment wine drinking Brain scan comparisons reflect difference in "true pleasure” 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
Marketing'may do more than persuade con
sumers to buy a product. For a glass of wine, at
least, pricing tactics may actually make people
enjoy the drink more.
A joint Stanford-California Institute of Tech
nology (Caltech) research study has demonstrated
that "marketing actions, such as changes in the
price of a product, can affect neural representa
tions of experienced pleasantness." In other
words, according to the study, mental expectations
of a wine's flavor appear to drive physical experi
ences of it.
The authors of the study had participants drink
samples of wine, differentiated only by price. The
same wine was labeled as both "$lO wine" and
"$9O wine," and another wine was used as both "$5
wine" and "$45 wine." A third variety was priced as
"$35 wine." fMRI scanning of the patients' brains
showed increased pleasure for the subject with
wine labeled at a higher price.
"We always have known that price influences

if perceptions of quali

ty," said Graduate

School of Business Prof. Baba Shiv,
one of the study's authors. "What we

were curious about, now that we know this, is
whether this perception benefit is just psychologi
cal. or whether price can influence the true pleas
ure."
The findings confirmed the hypothesis of the
researchers, but Shiv admitted that the result was
counter-intuitive.
"If you think about it.the brain should only be
influenced by the core components of the wine —
its chemical composition. It should not be influ
enced by something like price," Shiv said. "But in
the study we found a functional change in activity
in different areas of the brain despite the same
chemicals being experienced."
"It's very surprising," he added.
Wine provided an ideal medium for the study,
as small quantities allowed for the difficult logis
tics of scanning brain activity to remain manage-

able. It also hit on one of Shiv's per
sonal areas of interest.
"I've always been intrigued that
people spent so much for a bottle of
wine. You can get pretty good wine
for about $2. and people sometimes
pay $200. I've wondered about that
sort of relationship between more
pleasure and more expense, and
what's driving that in some cases."
Two of the co-authors were affil
iated with Stanford before going to
Caltech: I lilke Plassmann worked at
Stanford as ;i postdoctoral re
searcher, while Antonio Rangel
worked as an economist at the Uni
versity.
"The big lesson is not about wine
and price, it's about human experi
ence," Rangel said. "People have al
ways thought the quality of an expe
rience depended on the experience
itself. For wine, that would be what
you were drinking, whether you
were thirsty. But we've found as well
that an important factor is the belief
and expectations surrounding it."
"To me, that's a beautiful lesson."
