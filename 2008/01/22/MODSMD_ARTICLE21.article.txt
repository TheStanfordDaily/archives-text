## Mediocre pitchers rake in cash 
### 
I'm teaching my kids how to
pitch. Every day, from dawn till
dusk, we'll head to the park and
work on their motion, grips and
pitch selection. Forget the Cru
sades, chemistry and calculus — if 1
want my kids to succeed in life, all
they need is a decent curvehall and
good endurance. Because if you
want a cool, seven- to eight-figure
salary, pitching is the way to go.
The kicker? Compared to your
peers, you don't even have to be
good.
Carlos Silva, formerly of the
Minnesota Twins, signed the largest
contract for a starting pitcher in
this year's free agency period. The
Seattle Mariners inked the righty
for four years, $48 million. At $12
million a year, he'll he making
$7,500,000 more than Brandon
Webb, the 2006 NL Cy Young
Award winner.
Surely, then, Silva must be ace
material. Quite the contrary. Silva
is a below-average pitcher whose
best attribute is his endurance. But,
that's not necessarily a good thing
— Silva posted a mediocre 4.19
ERA last year, which was his best
since his rookie year. So, although
he'll stay in the game longer, he'll
give up more runs in the process —
his ERA is particularly bad be
cause long outings generally lead to
lower ERA totals, since more in
nings are taken into account and
it's assumed that managers won't
leave struggling pitchers in the
game.
But let's not just judge him on
the 2007 season. His career ERA
isn't any better: 4.31. His career
ERA+, a variation on ERA that
takes into account ballpark factors
and the performance of other
pitchers in the league, is a mediocre
102, only two points above average.
And his career WHIP (walks and
hits per innings pitched, perhaps
the most useful common statistic
used to determine a pitcher's suc
cess) is a below-average 1.368.
And, to top it all off, Silva went 13-
14 last year.
Silva has no business making
$12 million a year — he is, at best,
mediocre.
But Silva isn't the only one mak
ing a killing. Detroit's Nate Robert
son, who just re-upped for $21.25
million over three years, is even
worse than Silva. His career totals
are as follows: 4.60 ERA, 97 ERA +
and 1.411 WHIP.
However, Robertson knows
how inflated his salary is.
"I think it's ridiculous to pay
baseball players what we get," he
said on Michigan's WDEN radio.
Silva and Robertson headline a
system that rewards mediocrity.
The Yankees will pay Andy Pettitte
$16 million next year — although
Pettitte posted a good 110 ERA +
last year, his WHIP was a poor
1.426. He deserves a better contract
than Silva or Robertson, but he
shouldn't be making $16 million,
which makes Pettitte one of the
best-paid players (at any position)
in baseball.
And those are only the starting
pitchers — closer Eric Gagne, the
one-time Cy Young Award winner
who was so bad with the Boston
Red Sox last year that he was effec
tively benched down the stretch,
will make $10 million with the Mil
waukee Brewers next year.
Some good pitchers will get
their due: closer Francisco
Cordero. one of the best in the
game, inked a four-year. $46 million
contract with the Cincinnati Reds.
But even exceptions such as
Cordero don't disprove the general
rule — in recent years, the price of
pitchers has skyrocketed to the
point where average players are
making upwards of $10 million a
year. Baseball is one of the only
businesses where such mediocrity
is rewarded.
So on the day when my first kid
is born (boy or girl.it matters not). I
will present them with a glove, a ball
and a training regimen. They will
aim to be the best, but if they fail.no
worries! The Seattle Mariners, and
others of their ilk, will still fork over
an eight figure salary.
