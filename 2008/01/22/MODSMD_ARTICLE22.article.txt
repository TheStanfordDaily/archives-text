## Memphis tops AP poll for first time since 1983 Stanford back in Top 25 after AZ wins 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Memphis replaced North Car
olina as the No. 1 team in college
basketball Monday, the Tigers'
first appearance in 25 years at the
top of The Associated Press poll.
Kansas, the nation's only other
undefeated Division I men's team,
moved up to No. 2 while the Tar
Heels dropped to fifth after their
loss to Maryland. Drake and Bay
lor were two new entries to the
rankings, joining the Top 25 for the
first time in a long time.
Memphis' only other appear
ance at No. 1 was as short as possi
ble — a one-week stint in 1983.
"We've got one extra day than
the last time," Memphis coach
John Calipari said. "That team
went to No. 1 on a Monday and lost
that night. We get to enjoy Mon
day and TUesday and until we play
at Tulsa on Wednesday night."
North Carolina was ranked No.
1 in preseason and for the first 10
polls of the regular season. The Tar
Heels lost 82-80 to Maryland at
home on Saturday and Memphis
(17-0) moved up one spot with 49
first-place votes and 1.777 points

from the 72-member national
media panel.
Kansas (18-0) advanced from
third to second with 23 first-place
votes and 1.751 points. Tennessee
and Duke moved from sixth and
seventh to third and fourth. They
were followed by North Carolina
(18-1).
Drake, which came in at No. 22,
is ranked for the first time since
the final poll of the 1974-75 sea
son. while No. 25 Baylor was last in
the rankings in February 1969.
Although this is Memphis' first
No. 1 ranking since that 64-56 loss
at Virginia Tech on Jan. 10. 1983,
Calipari had his teams at Massa
chusetts there for a total of 14
weeks over the 1994-95 and 1995-
96 seasons.
"My 1995 team had the same
camaraderie and synergy this
team has but this team has it with
more guys because we'll play 10.
11 guys where that UMass team
was basically five guys." Calipari
said."lt'll matter to these guys. 1 've
coached at UMass and here and at
those kind of places, non-BCS
schools, most of those guys were
not silver-spooned not McDon
ald's Ail-Americans and they take
pride in it because it's a notch in
their belt to be able to say You
guys didn't think I was that good."
Calipari was honest that there
is a bigger target for him than
being No. 1.

"For me as a coach the only rat
ing I worry about is April 7," he
said, referring to the date of the
national championship game. "If
you said to me I could have the No.
1 ranking or a No. 1 seeding. I'd
take the seeding every time. For
your players and the school,
though, this is huge."
This week's poll is the first
major shuffling of the season as 15
ranked teams lost a game last
week and three of those — Texas
A&M. Marquette and Miami —
lost twice.
Washington State moved up
two spots to sixth and was fol
lowed by Indiana. UCLA,
Georgetown and Michigan State.
Wisconsin was 11th followed by
Texas. Pittsburgh, Vanderbilt, But
ler. Dayton, Mississippi. Texas
A&M. Villanova and Stanford, the
week's third newcomer.
The last five ranked teams were
Marquette. Drake, Xavier, Ari
zona State and Baylor.
Drake (16-1) moved into the
poll on a 15-game winning streak
with the only loss to Saint Mary's.
Calif., in the second game of the
season.
"For a team that lost five sen
iors and four starters from last
year and that was ranked ninth in
the Missouri Valley Conference
preseason poll, we felt, our team
and coaches, and probably our
fans, felt we could have a pretty

good team this year and be better
than people expected but this was
n't what people were thinking, a
national ranking," said first-year
coach Keno Davis, who succeeded
his father, Tom.
Baylor (15-2) lost to Washing
ton State and Arkansas this season
and has opened the Big 12 with
three straight wins.
But the Bears have completed
an impressive comeback under
fifth-year coach Scott Drew, who
took over after former coach Dave
Bliss resigned following a scandal
sparked by the slaying of former
player Patrick Dennehy by a
teammate. NCAA penalties for
wrongdoing uncovered during
Bliss' tenure forced the program
to deal with depleted rosters and
limited schedules.
Baylor is ranked for the first
time in almost 40 years and for just
the third time in school history
with the other in the first season
the AP conducted a poll, 1948-49.
"This is well-deserved for the
players for what they've done on
the court this year," Drew said.
"We are so pleased after all the
lean years and not being ranked
since 1969, it's a great tribute to
them. It will be very tough to get
the smiles off their faces today."
Stanford (15-3) moved into the
rankings for the third time this
season coming off a home sweep
of Arizona and Arizona State.
