## Serena Williams swept out of Australian Open 
### JOHN PYE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MELBOURNE. Australia - Defend
ing champion Serena Williams
slumped out of the Australian Open
in a 6-3,6-4 quarterfinal loss to third
ranked Jelena Jankovic.
Williams, who was unseeded and
ranked No. 81 when she won here
last year for her eighth Grand Slam
title, struggled with her serve on
Tuesday and made 36 unforced er
rors trying to combat Jankovic's go
for-broke game.
Williams had not dropped a set in
her four previous matches but
looked sluggish after winning the
first two games. Her usually powerful
serve was broken three times in the
first set and four times in the second.
Jankovic served for the match at
5-3, only to be broken herself.
Williams led 40-15 in the next game
only to fall apart again, double-fault
ing to set up match point, then send
ing a forehand wide.
"It was an unbelievable match. I
am still shaking," said Jankovic,
reaching the semifinals for the first
time at Melbourne Park and only the
third time at a major.
"I came here with no expectations
— it's amazing to beat the defending
champion and in general a champion
like Serena, it doesn't happen every
day."
Williams immediately went to
join her sister. Venus, to prepare for a
doubles quarterfinal.
Second-ranked Rafael Nadal was
impressive in a 7-5,6-3,6-1 win over
No. 24 Jarkko Nieminen of Finland,
making the semifinals for the first
time in four trips to the Australian
Open.
He set up match point with a stun
ning forehand down the line and
closed with an overhead smash as
Nieminen charged the net.
Three-time French Open champi
on Nadal, the only player to beat
Roger Federer in the last 10 Grand
Slam tournaments, next faces the
winner of Tuesday's later quarterfi
nal between No. 14 Mikhail Youzhny
faces Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France.
"I'm very happy to be in the semi
finals in this tournament. It's a very
important tournament for me at the

start of the season," Nadal said. "I've
had a very good tournament so far."
Jankovic had to fend off three
match points in the third set of her
first-round match, which included 15
service breaks, before edging Tamira
Paszek, 2-6,6-2,12-10.
She followed that with straight
sets wins over Edina Gallovits and
Casey Dellacqua and was taken to
three by No. 30 Virginie Razzano.
Jankovic lost to Williams in the
fourth round here last year between
runs to the semifinals at the 2006 U.S.
Open and 2007 French Open — her
best efforts in Grand Slam tourna
ments to date.
"Now, getting revenge it feels so
good," said the 22-year-old Jankovic.
who is now 3-2 in her career against
Serena Williams. "I've beaten the
Williams sisters a couple times. But
here it is very special."
After taking the first two games,
Williams became increasingly slug
gish and was often caught flatfooted,
left to watch as Jankovic's shots land
ed for winners or to whack unforced
errors awkwardly into the net.
Her shoulders frequently
drooped as the points piled up
against her.
The fans shared her disbelief, with
one shouting:"Wake up Serena!" By
the time sister Venus showed up.
Williams had lost the first set —
squandering five break points in two
games and netting an easy forehand
volley on set point.
After Jankovic broke her for a 3-1
lead in the second on a stinging back
hand, Williams angrily spiked her
racket, earning a warning from the
umpire for racket abuse.
That seemed to kick-start her for
a while, as Williams broke in the next
game to get back on serve.
Both women received medical
treatment at the changeover,
Jankovic for a persistent thigh ail
ment and Williams for a blister on
her right big toe.
Top-ranked Justine Henin was to
play No. 5 Maria Sharapova, the los
ing finalist last year, on TUesday
night.
James Blake advanced to a quar
terfinal match against Roger Federer
with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Marin
Cilic on Monday.
