# Card wins one, loses one in Davis
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After a month ind a half of what
essentially amount to preseason
matches, Stanford wrestling squared
off against its first conference oppo
nents Friday night in Davis,Calif. In a
strong showing, the Cardinal gave a
formidable Boise State squad all it
could handle in a 21-15 loss before
dominating rival UC Davis in a 30-9
rout.
The Broncos (5-1, 4-1 Pac-10)
jumped out to an early 9-0 lead
against the Cardinal (7-2. 1-1). as
Stanford sophomores Zack Giesen
and Jake Johnson at 184 and 197
pounds, and senior heavyweight Phil
Doerner all lost by three points or
fewer to their Boise State counter
parts.
Senior No. 6 Tanner Gardner
then, was put in the unusual position
of reversing the Cardinal's negative
momentum. Wrestling at 125
pounds. Gardner is most often in the

first match of the dual meet, but he
nevertheless seemed quite comfort
able with the impromptu role of
stopper, pinning his fourteenth op
ponent of the year at 5:35. That win
brought Stanford, down by just
three, back within striking distance
of the Broncos.
With another pair of close losses,
the Cardinal was down 15-6 before
redshirt freshman Lucas Espericue
ta, 149 pounds, won a match by for
feit and senior Josh Zupancic. 157
pounds, won perhaps the most im
portant individual match of the
night. No. 13 Zupancic defeated the
top-ranked wrestler in the Pac-10 at
his weight class. No. 10Tyler Sherfey.
in a close 3-1 match. A two-point
nearfall in the third period gave Zu
pancic the win and tied the meet
overall at 15. The Cardinal, however,
was unable to hold on. dropping the
final two matches of the night for the
final 21-15 result.
"It was tough losing to Boise in
that first match." Gardner said on

Monday. "Obviously they were heav
ily favored, and 1 thought it was great
that we put ourselves in a position to
win the match. I thought we lost four
matches we could've won, so we def
initely could have won it but —
"could've, would've, should've' —
we didn't."
Stanford fared much better, how
ever, in the second match of the
evening, topping UC Davis 30-9.The
Aggies (3-3, 1-3), as Gardner ex
plained. have become something of a
rival for the Cardinal in recent years,
making the win all the sweeter.
Asked if there was any added emo
tional incentive against the confer
ence rival. Gardner didn't hesitate.
"There definitely was [some extra
emotion against Davis]," he said.
"They've kind of become our rival
since they started becoming good
over the past few years.They've also,
actually, been talking some trash on
us, [saying] to some other teams that
they were going to beat us. So we def
initely had some extra motivation to

Stanford wrestlers won seven of
10 matches against Davis, including a
pair of technical falls by Zupancic
and redshirt sophomore Peter
Miller, 165 pounds. Miller's 17-2 vic
tory marked the first technical fall
win of his college career. Gardner
and Espericueta also helped to sig
nificantly pad the Cardinal's lead
with major decision victories over
their Aggie counterparts.
"I thought our team responded
real well by coming back and pound
ing Davis," Gardner said. "That felt re
ally good after losing to them the past
few years. But we've got to learn from
those losses [like the one to Boise
State] and continue to get better."
