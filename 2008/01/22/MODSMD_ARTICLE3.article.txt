### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Zuzu. a prostitute in Burma, recounted
her forced abortion in last night's screening
of "Anonymously Yours."
"My mother pressed stones on my stom
ach." the sex-trafficked Burmese girl said in
the documentary. "The next day, my stom
ach hurt on the bus. I told the bus driver to
go faster. When I got off the bus, it was com
ing out. I collected myself and went onto the
side to push the rest out.Then, I went home.
I was very bloody. But my mother was
happy because I could work again."
Last night's presentation of "Anony
mously Yours" addressed the topic of re
productive health as the third of five films
to be featured in the thinkßlG film festival.
Together, the films address the four topics
of thinkßlG, which also include women
and HIV/AIDS; education; and violence
against women.
"The purpose of the films is to introduce
people to the issues before the actual
thinkßlG conference." said Ciara Segura
'10, the thinkßlG film festival coordinator.
They put the topics of the conference in
[the] perspective of the world."
Organized by the student group

health and human rights. Ihe conference,

sues is reflected in the film selection
process.
"Because of the large number of
documentaries dealing with these is
sues, we narrowed the search by se
lecting movies with female direc
tors" Segura said.
Last night's film, which was
filmed clandestinely in the closed
off Southeast Asian state of Burma
(Myanmar), portrayed the sex-traf
ficking and prostitution scene in the

region through the stories of four
Burmese women.
The film did not hold back in il
lustrating the severity of the situa
tion, providing statistics that includ
ed the fact that 36 percent of girls
sold into prostitution are sold by
their parents in order to pay off a
debt.
Furthermore, trafficked girls
have almost no chance of escaping
the system due to familial pressure
and economic circumstances. One of
the women featured in the film
opened a center to assist trafficked
girls in leaving prostitution but ulti
mately most of them were forced
back, including Zuzu.

The film is only one stage in the
complex promotion scheme leading
up to the upcoming thinkßlG con
ference.
"Right now we have over 7(X)
people registered for the confer
ence," said Laura Carwile '08,
thinkßlG program director. "This is
going to be the biggest student-run
conference in Stanford history."
"This is definitely a once-in-a-
Stanford-career opportunity," Car
wile added.
Registration for the conference
ends on Jan. 30.
