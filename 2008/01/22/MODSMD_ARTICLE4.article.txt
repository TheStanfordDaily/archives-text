Computer Science Prof. Ron Fedkiw,
along with collaborators Nick Ras
niussen and Frank Losasso Petterson
from the special effects firm Industrial
Light and Magic (II.M). will bo awarded
the Scientific and Engineering Award by
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts

and Sciences for work on computer-gen
erated fluids.
The system uses a method of simulat
ing low-viscosity fluids such as water and
fire. Traditionally, computer graphic
artists have used a series of blobs to rep
resent water to varying degrees of suc
cess â€” they sometimes appear as unre
alistic. grainy surfaces. Another popular
method has been to employ a method

called the "level set method," which
gives better surface representation, but
does not render as well when broken
down in smaller particles, such as a
breaking wave.
ITie team's innovative "particle level
set method" uses a mix of particles and
level sets, which allows artists to main
