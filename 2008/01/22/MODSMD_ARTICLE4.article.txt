# CS prof wins film award
## Prof., collaborators to be recognized by Academy for special effects work 
### KAMIL DADA STAFF WRITER 
Computer Science Prof. Ron Fedkiw,
along with collaborators Nick Ras
niussen and Frank Losasso Petterson
from the special effects firm Industrial
Light and Magic (II.M). will bo awarded
the Scientific and Engineering Award by
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts

and Sciences for work on computer-gen
erated fluids.
The system uses a method of simulat
ing low-viscosity fluids such as water and
fire. Traditionally, computer graphic
artists have used a series of blobs to rep
resent water to varying degrees of suc
cess — they sometimes appear as unre
alistic. grainy surfaces. Another popular
method has been to employ a method

called the "level set method," which
gives better surface representation, but
does not render as well when broken
down in smaller particles, such as a
breaking wave.
ITie team's innovative "particle level
set method" uses a mix of particles and
level sets, which allows artists to main
tain smooth surfaces while still ren
dering the liquid when broken down.
The rendering also uses an addition
al method to simulate how the water
spray interacts with itself and the
surrounding water, which results in
more realistic representations.
Fedkiw explained that he does
not design the graphics for the
movies himself. Rather, along with
the help of Rasmussen, Petterson
and others from at the ILM, he de

signed a system that allows artists to
create better water effects. Fedkiw's
research is focused on the design of
new computational algorithms for a
variety of purposes, such as compu
tational fluid dynamics and solid me
chanics. computer graphics, comput
er vision and computational biome
chanics.
"The system is used for other
things too, from motion capture to
rendering, but 1 focus on physics
based simulation," Fedkiw said.
The power of the system is evi
dent in examples posted on Fedkiw's
Web site. I le has included computer
generated clips of ocean waves
crashing against a lighthouse, which

produce huge and realistic sprays of
water.
Fedkiw has worked on graphics
and digital effects for approximately
20 movies.
"The most notable ones related
to the award are the last two Pirates
of the Caribbean' movies, the last
'Harry Potter' movie. 'Evan
Almighty' and 'Poseidon,'" he said.
"1 think the sinking ship shots in 'Po
seidon' may be the best looking
stuff."
While Fedkiw expressed interest
in working in the special effects in
dustry. he said that if he switched ca
reers full-time he would miss his aca
demic pursuits too much.
"[ 11 would miss research with my
Ph. D.students — it's really fun. A lot
of our research is on computer
graphics too, so it's synergistic with
special effects."
Fedkiw currently teaches
CS2OSA: Mathematical Methods for
Robotics, Vision and Graphics. Ad
ditionally, in spring quarter, he will
teach a new class entitled C 52058:
Mathematical Methods for Fluids,
Solids and Interfaces.
"We have a great graphics group
here at Stanford." he said, "so taking
some of those classes is a good start
[to getting into the graphics indus
try]."
Fedkiw will collect his award at a
ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire
Hotel in Beverly Hills on Feb. 9.
