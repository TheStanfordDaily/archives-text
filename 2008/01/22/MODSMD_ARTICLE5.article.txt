### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Insti
tute and the Black Community Services Center (BCSC) have
sponsored a full schedule of events throughout this week in
recognition of the famous civil rights leader.
Yesterday's holiday commemorates the birthday of the
I%o's African-American activist,civil rights leader and Nobel
Peace Prize-winner who helped end racial segregation in
America through non-violent civil disobedience.

The series kicked off on Jan. 15 with the Institute's annual
celebration. This year's theme, "Global Peace and Social .lus
tice," featured the presentation of a clip from the recent film
"Passages of Martin Luther King." Events continued on Jan.
17. when the Stanford Aurora Forum presented an approxi
mately two hour-long discussion in Kresge Auditorium with
Clarence B.Jones, a former counsel and draft speechwriter for
King.
Mark Gonnerman, Director of the Aurora Forum, moder
ated the discussion, as well as the question-and-answer ses
sion that followed. According to Gonnerman, the event at
tracted about 500 people from campus and the surrounding
community.
"Clarence is a gifted public speaker, as one would expect
from someone who helped draft
speeches for Dr. King." Gonner
man wrote in an email to The Daily,
"and, through his narratives that
evening, he was able to make past
events — the 1963 Birmingham
Campaign and March on Washing
ton for Jobs and Freedom, for ex
ample — present and relevant to
our lives today."
Yesterday, supporters and ac
tivists commemorated Martin
Luther King. Jr. Day with two
major events — an afternoon
"teach-in" at the Bill Graham Civic
Auditorium in San Francisco and a
King Trivia Quiz and interactive art
creation at the San Mateo Caltrain
Station. Both the "teach-in," enti
tled "Martin Luther King's Legacy
in I lis Own Words: I lis Messages to
Us Today" and the trivia quiz in San
Mateo culminated with the 23rd
annual Freedom Train to San Fran
cisco.
Remaining events include a tra
ditional soul-food lunch at Tresidder
Oak Room tomorrow and a conver
sation with Julian Bond — current
president of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People (N A ACT) — on Thurs
day. The conversation will be held in
McCaw Hall in the Arrillaga Alum
ni Center from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.
The organizers hope that those
involved in the Martin Luther King.
Jr. events this week will remember
the life of King and what he worked
to accomplish.
"By studying the civil rights
movement and Dr. King's crucial
leadership role in the struggle, one
has an opportunity to learn about
effective mechanisms and strategies
for creating social change." Gonner
man said. "Through brilliant oratory
and political savvy Dr. King was
able to stir the conscience of our na
tion, but change occurred because
countless people began to organize
and act out against segregation,eco
nomic injustice and the effects of an
immoral foreign war."
