season opener against top
ranked Georgia last week to
pull out the victory over Ari
zona.
"The meet against Geor
gia gave us a lot of confidence
in our first line-ups and al
lowed us the opportunity to
introduce new people to each
event this week," said junior
Kell) Fee.
The match marked the
Cardinal's first in Pac-10 play;
last year Stanford went unde
feated in the conference sea
son.
"Last year we were unde
feated in the Pac-10 lor the
first [time] in Stanford's histo
ry," Fee said. "We'd like to
make it a tradition. litis was
the first step toward achieving
that goal."
The Cardinal started out
well, displaying the team's
strength early in the meet with
its strongest events — vault
and bar.

1 /27 Los Angeles, Calif.
2:00 PM.
GAME NOTES; Stanford edged Arizona at home
this weekend but will need a more consistent
performance in Los Angeles when the team will
face the No. 8 Bruins. At a quad meet hosted by
Cal State Fullerton over the weekend, UCLA
took top honors, placed three gymnasts in the
top four in each event and took the top three
spots in the Ail-Around, with Anna Li the individ
ual winner. Stanford beat the Bruins by almost a
point and a half last year en route to an unde
feated conference season.

Ihe vault was Stanford's best event of the meet, with all competitors
scoring a 97(H) or higher. Senior Stephanie Gentry tied for the team's
highest 5c0re,9.825, with a Yurchenko Full vault.
Freshman Danielle Ikoma made her collegiate vault debut, also earn
ing a 9.825. Freshman Shelley Alexander received the team's next highest
score with a 9.8(H).
Although the Cardinal performed well on the vault, there were some
early problems.There was a 20 minute pause in the middle of the Wildcats'
bar routine, which could have disrupted Stan
ford's concentration.
Instead, the team channeled its energy into
an impromptu dance session on the fkx>r,
spelling out C-A-R-D like the Village People.
For senior Lauren Elmore it was one of the
highlights of the meet.
"College gymnastics is great because it is
all about doing it as a team,"she said."The best
part about a meet is having fun with your
teammates.The fun of being together and just
enjoying the moment is what makes it great."
When the meet started up again, Stan
ford's second rotation saw freshman Allyse
Ishino continue her solid streak with a 9.825
on the bars. Junior Kelly Fee tied with Ishino
for the team's highest score.
The Cardinal,however.lost momentum as
the meet wore on. Even so, the women dis
played their depth and mental strength as they
pulled out routines despite faltering at times.
On the beam, Stanford pulled through to
stay ahead of the Wildcats, but their routines
were a bit wobbly. Fee led the way with a score
of 9.875. Elmore displayed her trademark
consistency with a solid 9.75.
"A team really wins based on their beam
routines," Elmore said."We've had a lot of suc
cess on beam in the past, and if we can do that
again this year we will be a very dangerous
team."
Fee went on to lead the Card on floor with

a 9.875 in the last rotation — hers was the
meet'sbest score on the floor. Although senior
Alex Pintchouk struggled on beam, she re
deemed herself with the Card's second-high
est score on fl<x>r, 9.775. with an energetic
crowd-pleasing routine.
Despite the win. the Cardinal was not satis
fied with its performance. The team knows
there is still work to be done before this week
end's meet against No. 10 UCLA.
" Ibis victory was bittersweet," Elmore
said. "We won, however,our performance left
much to be desired.
"This week, as we prepare for UCLA, we
are going to f<x:us on being more consistent
and mentally tough in pressure situations."
Ihe Cardinal was lucky this week to be
able to test its depth. Coach Kristen Smyth
took advantage of the opportunity to dig
deeper into the lineup, as 15 different athletes
competed.
"In some areas, the composure was just not
there," Smyth said. "With some of the main
stays out of our lineup, there wasn't that sense
of calm.
"Our goal this week is to return to a team
of 24 [hitting 24 routines] because consistency
is a very dangerous weapon."
Stanford will face IJCLA on Sunday in I
Angeles.

end's meet against No. 10 UCLA.
" Ibis victory was bittersweet," Elmore
said. "We won, however,our performance left
much to be desired.
"This week, as we prepare for UCLA, we
are going to f<x:us on being more consistent
and mentally tough in pressure situations."
Ihe Cardinal was lucky this week to be
able to test its depth. Coach Kristen Smyth
took advantage of the opportunity to dig
deeper into the lineup, as 15 different athletes
competed.
"In some areas, the composure was just not
there," Smyth said. "With some of the main
stays out of our lineup, there wasn't that sense
of calm.
"Our goal this week is to return to a team
of 24 [hitting 24 routines] because consistency
is a very dangerous weapon."
Stanford will face IJCLA on Sunday in I
Angeles.
