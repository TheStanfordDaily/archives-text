## Clinton, Obama tussle over truth for political gain 
### NEDRA PICKLER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MYRTLE BEACH. S C. — De
mocratic presidential rivals Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama
accused each other of repeatedly and
deliberately distorting the truth for
political gain Monday night in a high
ly personal, finger-wagging debate
that ranged from the war in Iraq to
Bill Clinton's role in the campaign.
Obama told the former first lady
he was helping unemployed workers
on the streets of Chicago when "you
were a corporate lawyer sitting on
the board at Wal-Mart."
Moments later, Clinton said that
she was fighting against misguided
Republican policies "when you were
practicing law and representing your
contributor ... in his slum landlord
business in inner city Chicago."
Obama seemed particularly irri
tated at the former president, whom
he accused in absentia of uttering a
series of distortions to aid his wife's
presidential effort.
"I'm here. He's not,"she snapped.
"Well, I ain't tell who I'm running
against sometimes." Obama countered.
The two rivals, joined by former
Sen. John Edwards, debated at close
quarters five days before the South
Carolina primary — and 15 days be
fore the equivalent of a nationwide
primary across 20 states that will go a
long way toward settling the battle
for the party's nomination.
Even in the superheated atmos
phere of the primary, the statements
and exchanges between Clinton and
Obama were unusually acrimonious.
The debate came as the two cam
paigns continued to complain about
dirty politics and disenfranchise
ment of voters in last Saturday's
Nevada caucuses.
Obama suggested the Clintons
were both practicing the kind of polit
ical tactics that had alienated voters.
"There was a set of assertions

made by Senator Clinton as well as
her husband that are not factually ac
curate" Obama said. "I think that
part of what people are looking for
right now is someone who is going to
solve problems and not resort to the
same typical politics that we've seen
in Washington."
Clinton countered: "I believe your
record and what you say should matter."
Often speaking over each other.
Obama and Clinton bitterly com
plained about each other's legislative
records. Obama questioned why the
New York senator had voted for a
bankruptcy bill that she later said she
was glad hadn't passed, and Clinton
criticized Obama for voting "pres
ent" on dozens of occasions while a
member of the Illinois legislature.
"Senator Obama,it's hard to have a
straight up debate with you because

you never take responsibility for any
vote," Clinton said to loud boos. "On
issue after issue, you voted present ...
Whenever someone raises that, there's
always some sort of explanation."
Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn.an
influential leader in South Carolina,
suggested on Monday that Bill Clin
ton tone down his rhetoric. Oues
tioned about it, Hillary Clinton said
her husband was "a tremendous
asset... 1 believe that this campaign is
not about our spouses. It is about us.
It is about each of us individually."
The debate was sponsored by the
Congressional Black Caucus Insti
tute and CNN.
