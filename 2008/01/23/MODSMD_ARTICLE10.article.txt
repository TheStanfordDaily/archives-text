Emergency Fed rate cut stabilizes stocks;
Bush, Congress pledge urgent action to
stem slide
WASHINGTON (AP) — Jolted by global recession
fears, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates TUesday,
and President Bush and leaders of Congress joined in a
rare show of cooperation in promising urgent action to
pump up the economy with upwards of $ 150 billion in tax
cuts and government spending.
The Fed. announcing its action after an emergency
video conference Monday night, indicated further rate re
ductions were likely, aimed at encouraging people and
companies to start spending again.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the goal was
to get a deal through Congress and on Bush's desk within
roughly three weeks — lightning speed compared with
the usual snail's pace on Capitol Hill.
Bush expressed confidence that he and the Democrat
ic-led Congress could put aside bitter differences that
have marked his presidency.
"I believe we can find common ground to get some
thing done that's big enough, effective enough so that an
economy that is inherently strong gets a boost — to make
sure that this uncertainty doesn't translate into more eco
nomic woes for our workers and small business people."
Heath Ledger found dead in NYC building
NLW YORK (AP) — Heath Ledger, the talented 28-
year-old actor who gravitated toward dark.brooding roles
that defied his leading-man looks, was found dead TUes
day in a Manhattan apartment, facedown at the foot of his
bed with prescription sleeping pills nearby, police said.
There was no obvious indication that the Australian
born Ledger had committed suicide, NYPD spokesman
Paul Browne said.
While not a marquee movie star. Ledger was an award
winning actor who chose his roles carefully rather than
cashing in on big-money parts. He was nominated for an
Oscar for his performance as a gay cowboy in "Brokeback
Mountain." During filming, he met Michelle Williams,
who played his wife in the film. The two had a daughter,
now 2-year-old Matilda, and lived together in Brooklyn
until they split up last year.
It was a shocking and unforeseen conclusion for one of
Hollywood's bright young stars.
