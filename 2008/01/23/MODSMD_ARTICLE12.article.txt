## Scientist speaks on water shortages Gleick urges 20 percent consumption reduction 
### ROBERT TOEWS 
Prominent environmental scien
tist Peter Gleick spoke last night
about freshwater issues facing the
global community in the twenty-first
century. Gleick, who received a
Ph.D. in energy and resources from
UC-Berkeley, is the president of the
Pacific Institute and a past recipient
of the Mac Arthur Fellow "Genius
Grant."
Gleick, who declared that "there
is a serious water crisis out there,"

spoke to a full audience in Kresge
Auditorium with guarded optimism.
To put the crisis in context, Gleick
described three ages of water in the
history of mankind.
According to Gleick, mankind
was completely dependent on na
ture in the first age, building its civi
lizations around freshwater sources.
The second age was marked by
man's mastery over water. Irrigation
systems, dikes and dams were all
manifestations of this second age, in
which mankind had greater control
over this crucial resource.
In the past few decades, a slew of
large-scale water-related problems
have arisen, necessitating a shift into
a third age of water.
"Per capita water availability is
steadily declining as population
steadily increases," he said. "More
than a billion people today do not
have safe drinking water. Approxi
mately a quarter of the world's pop
ulation does not have access to
water for adequate sanitation."
Preventable water-related dis
eases such as dysentery and typhoid
are rampant in developing countries
and result in around two million
deaths per year. Also, Gleick pre
dicted that the number of conflicts
over freshwater resources and allo
cation will increase in the years to
come as access to water continues to
be a contentious issue.
He argued that these crises de
mand a fundamental shift in the in
ternational community's approach
to water. This transition will lead to
the third age, in which water policy
will aim to meet basic human needs
for water while taking environmen
tal factors into account.
One way to do this, Gleick said, is
for society to become more efficient
in its use of water.
"If we chose to, we could use 20
percent less water than we do and
still have a healthy, functioning
economy," he asserted. "To put it
simply, we can do the things we want
to do with far less water than we are
using."
As an illustrative example, he ex
plained that the amount of water re
quired to produce a square inch of
semiconductor has been reduced

from thirty gallons to six in recent
years in response to environmental
and efficiency demands.
Gleick also stressed the need for
institutions to deal more seriously
and comprehensively with water is
sues.
"Universities," he argued,
"should teach about water not only
in the context of civil engineering,
but also as an economic issue, a soci

ological issue, a historical issue."
I3espite concerns, Gleick's per
spective on the future path of the
water crisis was ultimately opti
mistic. Although hesitant to make
any concrete predictions, he voiced
his personal opinion that sanitary
water would ultimately be provided
to 1(H) percent of the world's popu
lace, and that water disputes would
one day be solved diplomatically.

rather than violently.
"1 do not know what the extent
of human misery and ecological
destruction will be before we fig
ure things out." Gleick said, "but
ultimately 1 believe that we will
figure it out — and 1 hope we do
fast."
