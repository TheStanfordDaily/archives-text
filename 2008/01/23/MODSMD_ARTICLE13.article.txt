## ASSU urges Rumsfeld to address campus Bill designed to promote community dialogue 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
During this week's Undergradu
ate Senate meeting, senators prima
rily focused on passing the "Bill to
Allow for the Discussion of Donald
Rumsfeld's Legacy."The bill passed
fourteen to one, but not without dis
cussion as to whether this issue was
pertinent to the Undergraduate
Senate and its responsibilities.
The bill advocates a campus
wide forum with Donald Rumsfeld,
during which students would have
the opportunity to ask questions
and discuss concerns with Rums

feld himself. In the case that Rums
feld rejects the invitation, the Sen
ate would still hold an event in
which students could debate a vari
ety of issues with one another re
garding Rumsfeld, his appointment
and even his policies.
At the beginning of last night's
meeting, Adam Hudson '10 remind
ed the Senate that Rumsfeld and his
presence on campus are still very
important to many students, regard
less of whether they are in support
of him or not.
"I know that a lot of people think
that since the last bill [against
Rumsfeld's appointment] died, we
shouldn't focus on this again," Hud
son said. "But, 1 have talked to
many students about this issue, and
just because this bill died with the
ASSU within these walls, that does
n't mean the bill died outside of
these walls."
"One thing that is for certain is
that [this issue] is on the minds of
the people," he added."lf the ASSU
can't take a stand for or against
Rumsfeld, you can provide a forum

for the 6,000 students and faculty
that have taken a stance."
However, Senator Stuart Baimel
"09 believed the hill lacked substan
tial purpose.
"This bill is not taking a position
on anything." he said. "[lt] supports
political activism. I think that it is
already clear that the Undergradu
ate Senate supports political ac
tivism."
"We should be making bills that
either express strong statements of
campus sentiment or that will get
something done in terms of our re

lationship with the administration,"
he added.
Senator and author of the bill
Sarah Golabek-Goldman '10 em
phasized the bill's role to acknowl
edge the student voice regarding
the issue by providing the campus
community with such an event.
"While there is nothing that we
can do about Rumsfeld being here,"
Golabek-Goldman said,"we can in
vite him to speak and give students
the opportunity to ask him ques
tions. If he declines that invitation,
we can discuss the criteria used to

offer him the distinguished visiting
fellow title."
"The ASSU cannot control
[whether the Hoover Institution in
vites Rumsfeld or not]," she contin
ued,"but we can make a substantial
impact by supporting political ac
tivism and giving students the op
portunity to speak."
Aside from passing the bill re
garding Rumsfeld's Legacy, the
Senate discussed the new elections
policies for the upcoming campus
elections in March. Elections Com
missioner Ryan Woessner '10 pre

sented his new policies to the Sen
ate.
Woessner intends to hold a
"Sticker Crusade" — an event
where all candidates are handed
200 stickers that must be posted on
all flyers and posters — in order to
make sure that all candidates ad
here to fair campaign policies. By
having stickers on all flyers, moni
toring fair campaigns will be easier
and more convenient than in past
elections.
Also during the meeting. ASSU
President Hershey Avula '08 and

Vice President Mondaire Jones '09
announced Stanford Idol, the
ASSU's newest social program
ming initiative. A $500 prize will be
awarded to the first place winner of
the competition, a spin-off of the hit
television show "American Idol."
Avula also discussed efforts to
make Old Union a more social stu
dent environment by potentially
adding foosball tables and Xbox
360 video game systems.
