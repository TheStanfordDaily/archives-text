## Editorial Board Find an alternative to alternative energy 
### 
It is clear from the "King Corn" documen
tary screening last night that corn indeed
reigns supreme in the United States. You
can tell just from the sponsors of the screening
— Stanford in Government, Stanford Dining,
the Program in Ethics and Society and Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford — that corn
has transformed from a barbeque side dish to
an emerging alternative energy source and one
of today's most hotly contested political topics.
Although the corn ethanol phenomenon has
been propelled by environmental concerns
and fear of foreign-oil dependency, the editori
al board feels that corn ethanol is not a viable
solution to the recent concerns over fossil fuel
depletions.
Perhaps the most compelling argument for
the use of corn ethanol is its viability as an en
vironmentally friendly alternative energy
source. Many studies have shown, however,
that the greenhouse emissions released by
corn ethanol are similar to those of gasoline,
with the most generous approximations esti
mating only a 30 percent decrease in green
house gases. The process of making corn
ethanol is also not very environmentally
friendly, since fossil fuels are utilized heavily
during the conversion of corn to fuel. Con
sumer Reports stated that the positive energy
balance for ethanol lies between 23 and 40 per
cent. Additionally, growing com depletes the
soil even if sustainable farming methods such
as crop rotation are used — some researchers
argue that ethanol production from corn could
deplete the soil within 30 years.
The desire to make our countrv less de

pendent on foreign oil is a legitimate and com
pelling concern. Unfortunately, corn ethanol
will do little to solve this problem. First, the
growth and production of the corn requires
transporting seeds, making fertilizer, herbicide
and insecticide, as well as operating tractors
and other farming equipment — processes
that all require fossil fuel. The conversion of
corn into ethanol through industrial fermenta
tion, chemical processing and distillation also
uses large amounts of fossil fuels, not to men
tion the transportation of the materials via
diesel trucks.
A 2(X)8 farm bill that is currently working its
way through Congress mandates the produc
tion of 15 billion gallons of ethanol annually, up
from seven billion gallons This mandate would
absorb much of the $280 billion allotted to
farm subsidies, and would hardly affect the 150
billion gallons of oil used in the US. annually.
Moreover, demand for biofuels is raising
the price of crops. ITiis may adversely affect
food supplies, since dedicating more land to
ethanol crops squeezes the amount of farm
land used for food production. In 2007. the
price of corn feed increased 20 percent and
grocery prices increased five percent partly be
cause, as "King Corn" showed last night.corn is
in everything.
Farmers are an important part of the U.S.
economy and voting population — especially
in the recent lowa caucus — and have man
aged to push ethanol through Capitol Hill.
While corn-derived ethanol may be a short
term solution to America's energy problem,
however, its lone-term viability is almost nil.
