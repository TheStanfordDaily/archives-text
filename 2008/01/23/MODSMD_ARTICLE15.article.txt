## The 						cage match 
### 
Monday night. Democrats,and maybe
a few Republicans, had the privilege
of watching the Democratic debate
featuring only three (three! not eight!) can
didates.
I don't even know why John Edwards was
up there. It was clearly a contest between
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It was
vicious. They talked over each other. Wolf
Blitzer and his beard looked at times as
though they were losing control of the de
bate. Clinton attacked Obama's record,
Obama accused Clinton of doing anything to
get elected. Edwards, for his part, still seems
intent on remaining in the race, despite com
ing in third in Nevada by 41 points, and only
gaining four percent of the vote. This is much
closer to what political debates should be.
however, rather than the glorified joint press
conferences that occurred when there were
eight or nine candidates, where Mike Gravel
got as much speaking time as I lillary Clinton.
7"he obsessive pundits and bloggers tried
as always to score the debate, declare a win
ner— frankly, Edwards probably won be
cause he didn't bother to slam his opponents.
The focus on declaring a winner, however,
missesthe point,and the value, of this debate.
For the first time, really, the two candidates
with a serious chance of winning the Democ
ratic nomination questioned each other on
their political pasts and plans for the future.
This is a good thing. This is a great thing. It
needs to happen more often. It should have
happened earlier in the race.Too many times
in the past few weeks we've had Bill Clinton
take a microphone and wander around a
stage, spouting off about Obama's inexperi
ence. Too often Obama's Davids, his most
well known campaign staffers Plouffe and
Axelrod, send out random releases to the
press making veiled comments about Clin
ton, so Obama himself (God forbid!) can
avoid saying anything negative about his op
ponent. But last night, the candidates went
directly at each other, and the debate was
both entertaining and informative.
It seems as if Obama has gotten a free
pass from the media so far. but Clinton's
questioning of his record last night brought
to light significant aspects of his career that
he has not yet explained. Obama could not
offer a good explanation why he voted "pres
ent" on 130 bills during his tenure in the Illi
nois State Senate, only saying that "often
times you vote present in order to indicate
that you had problems with a bill that other
wise you might be willing to vote for." He
also couldn't explain his wavering Iraq posi
tion — although he opposed it in 2002, Clin
ton noted correctly that "by the next year the
speech was off your Web site. By the next
year, you were telling reporters that you
agreed with President Bush in his conduct of
the war. And by the next year, when you were
in the Senate, you were voting to fund the
war time after time after time." Obama did
not have a good response for this either. He
almost seemed surprised that issues like this
would come up.

I le'll have good answers for them in time.
But it is clear from the debate last night that
Obama cannot simply talk about "hope" and
"change" anymore. Clinton now calls him on
it—one blogger brilliantly called this new
Hillary "Hillary Clinton unplugged" — and,
frankly, it's better for the country if we know
what we're getting ourselves into with an
Obama presidency. He's going to have to en
gage Clinton in a debate about policy. In
stead of constantly reminding voters that he
opposed the war, considering that it hap
pened six years ago and it doesn V really mat
ter now. he should be questioning Clinton on
her plans to withdraw troops. Obama's been
doing well with independents,attracted to his
rhetoric, but Clinton has consistently won
Democratic voters concerned with core is
sues since lowa.
If Obama wants to win the nomination,
he's going to have to take on the Clintons
more directly. Hillary has shown herself
more than willing to make it a fight.
