## The

I just need to talk about style for a moment. In
D.C., the clothing people wear speaks for it
self. Not only do you have to wear a suit and
tie every day hut you have to wear a good suit
and tie. The color of your shoes hits to match the
color of your belt and, if possible, your coat.
People judge you on your sense of style. If
your colors are too subdued, you blend into the
background. If your colors are a little too flam
boyant, you are classified as a dandy (People ac
tually use this word — it was slightly shocking
when I first heard it.) As an intern, if you dress
tot) well, you seem too big for your britches. If
you don't dress well enough,you seem unprofes
sional.
I knew this. I had heard horror stories of peo
ple who were sent home because they were not
professional enough or who missed out on meet
ing someone really interesting because they
looked like they just woke up. You had to dress
well because you never knew who you might
meet in a given day. From members of Congress
to business leaders to high-level bureaucrats,
you had to be prepared at all times.
So I took this lesson to heart. There was one
time early in the fall when I wore a beige suit, an
orange-ish shirt and a beige, orange, and brown tie
to match. I felt awesome. I walked around with a
little grin on my face because I was so sure I had
beaten the style system.
But, alas, 1 was doomed. I had worked too
hard, and now I was going to face the conse

quences.
As I walked into the office that day, the Air
Force fellow who sat near me came by with a
smirk on his face.
"What are you wearing, Doshi?" he asked.
My morning grin paled a little. "My suit, what
else?"
His grin started to rival my own. "What color
is that shirt you're wearing?" he asked.
I tried to laugh it off. 1 would just respond with
a funny answer. "It's a salmon-colored shirt. It's
not orange or anything," I chuckled nervously.
The ends of his mouth reached mountainous
heights. "Salmon?? Oh, Doshi, you have just
earned yourself a call sign. From now on, we'll
call you Fish."
And from mouth to mouth, from office to of
fice, from think tank to the Pentagon, people the
city over began to be introduced to me as "Fish."
It got even better when I inadvertently de
scribed someone's paper as "wonderful." A per
fectly acceptable adjective, as far as I'm con
cerned, but apparently a little too much for my

office's references. Then I didn't just become
"Fish." which at least sounded cool in a slimy
kind of way, but I became "Wonderful Fish,"
which reminded me of that children's book
about a Rainbow Fish — not at all the image 1
was hoping to project while in D.C.
So all this has made me appreciate returning
to our laid-back campus that much more. It was
tough to let go, to be honest. I've spent the last
two weeks wearing a button-up shirt almost
every day. It's a difficult addiction to get rid o£
But 1 am very proud of myself. Today I grad
uated to a vintage T-shirt. Tomorrow, perhaps
even shorts, weather permitting.The possibilities
are endless.
It is a long and winding road, but all of us for
mal clothing addicts can reach the ideal: torn
jeans and a stained undershirt. My fellow Stan
fordians, you too can become a trashy dresser. Do
not be tempted by our sweater-vested and
tucked-in colleagues.They will soon see the light.
Join me, and we shall reach the promised land.
Soon blacks and whites, short and tall, pimply and
clear-skinned will join hands and say,"Free at last!
Free at lastlThank JC Penney,we are free at last!"
