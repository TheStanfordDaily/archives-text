## Promote transparency through the ASSU 
### 
I was sitting with a group of friends at dinner
one day and we were talking about our gen
eration's lack of activism. One of my friends
said,"Look at the Rumsfeld issue. We got Don
ald Rumsfeld at our school hut you don't see
anyone doing anything about it." As a person
who has been very active and passionate about
this issue. I quickly informed her that students
have tried to do something, such as holding a
rally and lobbying for an ASSU bill that op
posed his appointment. Unfortunately, the bill
fell two votes short of the two-thirds majority
required to pass because senators could not
agree whether or not it was within the Under
graduate Senate's scope to vote on such a polit
ical resolution that had no tangible impact on
the student body. When I told my friends this,
they didn't seem happy. One of my other
friends asked, "Isn't the ASSU a channel for
students to voice their opinion?" while another
friend suggested that we impeach the ones who
voted against the bill.
By talking to many of my friends about the
ASSU, I can tell that a lot of people dislike it be
cause they feel like it does not do anything.
Over 4,000 people signed a petition opposing
Rumsfeld's appointment; yet, instead of chan-

neling that sentiment, the Senate felt it would
be more worthwhile to focus on providing free
bike lights. While I don't think that handing out
free bike lights is bad, I think that it's a shame
that the Senate turned its back on the voices of
the students it represents.
I lowever. thanks to Senator Sarah Golabek-
Goldman io,a new bill will be heard in front of
the Senate that addresses the Rumsfeld issue.
Instead of actively condemning the former Sec
retary of Defense's appointment, this bill would
invite Rumsfeld to come speak to the Stanford
community about his career in public life and
provide transparency on how and why he was
appointed as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow to
the Hoover Institution. While the Senate was
unsuccessful in barring his appointment, this bill
capitalizes on Rumsfeld's presence to promote
political activism and dialogue. As Golabek-
Goldman said, "If he is part of this community,
he should help contribute to this community's
mission — promoting knowledge and learning.
I hope students have an opportunity to ask ques
tions and engage him in dialogue."
Yet, this bill is not without opposition. Some
senators think the Senate should not be focus
ing on this issue. After the defeat of the last bill.

they feel the issue is dead and no one cares
about it anymore. While I understand that
some might want to focus on other things, I be
lieve that having a well-known and controver
sial figure on our campus deserves discussion
and debate among the student body. After all,
Stanford is a university, a place defined by the
free exchange of knowledge and ideas. Even if
Rumsfeld declines the Senate's invitation, stu
dents from across the political spectrum will
able to voice their opinions.
Just because a bill on a certain issue was de
feated doesn't mean the issue itself has been
defeated. Rumsfeld is still associated with Stan
ford and people care about his presence at the
University Some oppose his appointment,
some believe he's fully deserving of his title and
still others disagree with his actions but think
he should stay at the University because of the
controversy and dialogue his presence pro
vokes. Whatever opinion students may have of
him, the Senate must listen to the voices of the
students it represents and provide an open
forum to discuss this important issue.
