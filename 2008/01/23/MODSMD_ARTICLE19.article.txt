## Caucuses as a form of political suppression 
### 
Last weekend a number of Stanford stu
dents— including ourselves — de
scended on Nevada to campaign for
their favorite presidential candidate before the
Democratic caucuses. Although we expected
to see a system reminiscent of old town hall
meetings, where the community comes togeth
er to decide as a collective which candidate to
support, what we encountered was a system
rife with injustices aimed at the very people the
Democratic Party is supposed to support.
To begin with, the caucuses took place from
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on a Saturday, a time during
which significant portions of the population,
especially the working class population, must
work. Since the person has to be present for the
entire duration of the caucus for their prefer
ence to count, even employees with a normal
lunch break could not participate. In addition,
since "voting" for a candidate involves spatial
ly positioning yourself with other supporters,
the caucus system requires a person to not only
be physically present, but physically mobile
and capable of standing for long durations
This leaves many disabled people without a

political voice. We spent most of our time this
weekend canvassing neighborhoods, spread
ing the word about the caucuses and our candi
date. During that time we heard innumerable
stories from people who were completely dis
enfranchised by the caucus system because
they either could not get out of work, or they
could not stand for long enough periods of
time to take part. The incredible biases inher
ent in the caucus system are evident in the
voter turnout; approximately two percent of
eligible Nevadans participated in the Democ
ratic caucuses. Compare that to the 15 to 20
percent of the eligible population that voted in
New Hampshire's Democratic primary.
Furthermore, the caucus system doesn't
only disadvantage people by excluding them.
The very process, by which people are forced
to express their opinion in front of their neigh
bors, creates social pressures that change peo
ple's voting behavior. Additionally, caucuses
include 15 minutes dubbed "realignment" dur
ing which people who voted for a candidate
who in the first round did not receive the req
uisite 15 percent support to remain eligible

must either leave or move to a new preference
group, and people who did vote for eligible
candidates can campaign for the realignment
vote. We witnessed on multiple occasions
someone who was pressured beyond their lim
its to vote for a candidate, exasperatedly giving
in just so that they could escape the mob press
ing down on them. The importance of a secret
ballot in preserving the integrity of a popula
tion's political choices is blindingly apparent in
light of the caucuses.
There are many more instances of the cau
cuses' shortcomings: the automated phone sys
tem used for reporting precinct results that has
no accountability structure, the fact that most
caucuses are run by volunteers with less than
two hours of training and the relative lack of
general information available to the public re
garding caucus procedure combine to create a
disastrous potential for fraud. We witnessed in
stances of volunteers closing registration early
(by as much as a full half-hour), muddling vote
counts, abbreviating the system to save time (to
a detriment) and even running parts of the cau
cus incorrectly because they did not know, and

were not trained to know, proper procedures.
For a group of observers (we were allowed to
watch but not participate) to continually have
to correct the precinct chairmen because we
knew better than they did is disgusting.
A system that inherently disadvantages
both the working class and the disabled, two
groups for which the Democratic Party is sup
posed to fight, while simultaneously favoring
obnoxious and abrasive individuals, seems less
democratic, and less just, when compared to a
simple primary vote where everyone has the
same voice. We are sad and troubled by the De
mocratic Party's choice to support the caucus
system, and hope that the surfacing stories of
fraud and disenfranchisement will create
meaningful discussion on the highest level
about the relevance of such a paradigm in
today's society.
