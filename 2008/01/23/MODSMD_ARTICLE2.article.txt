## Paul responds to student concerns Texas Republican tells students to read and understand the Constitution 
### ANDREA FULLER DESK EDITOR 
I"he campaign of Congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas) for pres
ident has recently garnered criticism on ITie Daily's opinions
page, as columnists have berated both his domestic and foreign
policy proposals. But columnists' verbal onslaught has persisted
with little response from Paul — until now.
UWIRE granted 'ITie Daily and a dozen other college news
papers a phone interview with Paul yesterday Despite breaking
the fundraising record for one-day political contributions —
raking in $6 million —the Republican candidate ranks low in
national polls. Paul placed fifth in both the lowa caucuses and
the New 1 lampshire primary, according to CNN. On Jan. 19. he
placed second in the Nevada caucuses, with 14 percent of the
vote, and according to The New York Times, Paul is ranked sixth
in Florida with five percent of the vote. But he said yesterday
that he has no plans of dropping out or running as a third-party
candidate.
Paul briefly spoke with The Daily yesterday and responded
to attacks against him. Despite the relative quietness of his cam
paign at Stanford, Paul receives more support from youth than
he does from any other group, earning 19 percent of the votes
from 18-24 year-olds in New Hampshire.
"At T"he Stanford Daily, some of our columnists have been
critical of your policies," this reporter told Paul. "One colum
nist's piece called 'Ron Paul is Insane' condemned what he
called your isolationist foreign policy and distrust of the Feder
al Reserve among other issues.This column received more than
1.000 online comments, largely attacks from angry Paul support
ers. How do you react to both these criticisms and your support
ers' reaction, and why do you think that your overwhelming sup
port among youth hasn't translated to Stanford?"
Paul told The Daily that to understand his beliefs, students
simply need to understand that his
views complied with the Constitu
tion.
"Maybe [Stanford students who
oppose me] haven't understood me
carefully enough or understand the
principles of liberty nor are con
cerned about the Constitution." Paul
said. "People might criticize me, but
nobody says 1 ignore the Constitu
tion. Maybe they've bought into this
idea that the Constitution is old. it's
a relic, that you don't follow it, you
don't follow it with monetary policy,
and you go to war without declara
tion and you spend money and run
up deficits."
Often labeled as a libertarian,
Paul advocates a number of non-tra
ditional policies, including with
drawing from the United Nations,
NATO and the World Trade Organi
zation. He also advocates the aboli
tion of the income tax. and eventual
ly, the Federal Reserve, among other
government agencies. Paul is also
the only Republican presidential
candidate to have voted against the
2002 Iraq War Resolution.
While many critics of Paul, in
cluding some Daily columnists, have
called him an extremist, Paul
claimed that the politicians in power
are the ones who are radical.
"I think the radicals and the ex
tremists are in charge of our govern
ment," he said. "That's why we go to
war without declaration, we run up
these deficits, we print money, we

criticize me, but no
one says I ignore the
Constitution."

dump all this burden on the next
generation. People need to wake up,
because if they do they will change
their minds."
Paul also defended himself
against the challenge that he is an
isolationist, claiming that he is non
interventionist acting in accordance
with the Constitution.
"When [critics] glibly say we have
to reject his foreign policy because
it's isolationist, they don't under
stand the policy," he said."l'm a non
interventionist. I think we have iso
lationism now because we're putting
sanctions on countries. We put them
on Iraq, and we go to war on them.
We put them on Iran; we're getting
ready to go to war there."
"If you don't have non-interven
tion you can expect this war to
spread: you can expect the draft to
be reinstated," he continued. "You
can expect to have women and men
drafted here as this war spreads.
Non-intervention is doing exactly
what the founders said, and that is
mind our own business."
