## Prison Experiment movie runs aground 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
More than 36 years after its exe
cution, Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's infamous Prison
Experiment has received renewed
media attention. The publicity
stems from a recently settled legal
battle between two film production
companies over plans for a movie
based on the experiment. As of Jan.
16, Maverick Films is allowed to
continue with its movie plans about
the psychology experiment that
studied the use and abuse of power
in humans.
Maverick Films, co-founded by
Madonna, sued Inferno Distribu
tion in October 2006 for unfairly
gaining access to confidential infor
mation about the Prison Experi
ment movie that Maverick was
making. In December 2006, Inferno
countersued Maverick, alleging
that Maverick was merely making
an English-language version of
"Das Experiment," a German
movie that examines the psycho
logical effects of authority and
prison.
According to Zimbardo, howev
er, "Das Experiment" is an inaccu
rate portrayal of the actual Stan
ford Prison Experiment.
'"Das [Experiment]' is an aber
ration, a total exploitation of sex

and violence that is completely un
like the truth of the Prison Experi
ment," Zimbardo said. "It began by
implying that it was an actual repli
cation of the Prison Experiment,
but nothing remotely like the phys
ical abuse and rape scenes occurred
in our study."
The Maverick movie will at
tempt to tell the real story of Zim
bardo's 1971 study, which exam
ined how good people can be cor
rupted in bad situations. Student
volunteers were assigned roles of
mock prison guards and prisoners,
but the intensity that they dis
played in their respective roles
forced Zimbardo to end the exper
iment prematurely.
"The idea was to understand the
influence that institutions, like pris
ons, and other social situations can
have in undermining and trans
forming individuals under certain
conditions," he said. "When embed
ded in new and unfamiliar settings,
our habitual ways of thinking, feel
ing and acting no longer function to
sustain the moral compass that has
guided us reliably in the past."
Christopher McQuarrie, who
won an Oscar for his script of "The
Usual Suspects," is co-writer and
director of the film. Icon Entertain
ment has acquired international
sales rights for the movie, which
will feature Ryan Phillippe, Kieran
Culkin, Paul Dano. Jesse Eisen
berg, Charlie Hunnam, Ben
McKenzie and ChanningTatum.

Though actors have been cho
sen and Maverick now has legal
permission to make the feature
length movie based on the experi
ment, the film has to jump through
yet another hoop, as the writer's
strike has indefinitely halted pro
duction.
