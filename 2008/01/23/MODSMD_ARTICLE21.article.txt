## READY TO SHINE Ishino finally makes debut 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team has a long history of bringing in
some of the sport's most notable and
dynamic competitors — in recent
years,seniorsTabitha Yim and LizTri
case. But the gymnasts who fly just
below the radar are equally as re
markable.
When redshirt freshman Allyse
Ishino competed at the 2004 Pacific
Alliance as a high-school student, the
announcer stated, "I'm sure there are
a lot of people watching today that
have never heard of this young lady. It
is really remarkable."
And remarkable is perhaps the
best way to describe Ishino, who has
consistently battled her way into the
hearts and minds of gymnastics fans
around the world, beginning with the
2004 Olympic trials, where she came
in fifth and earned a spot as the team's
alternate.
Ishino was also the 2006 Junior
Olympic National Ail-Around
Champion, a U.S. national team mem
ber for four years and a 2(X)4 Pacific
Alliance Games Ail-Around Cham
pion.
"One of my greatest accomplish
ments before coming to Stanford
was being chosen as an alternate for
the 2004 Olympic team." Ishino said.
"Here, it's been getting to compete
with the most amazing group of girls
and accomplishing team goals to
gether."

But Ishino's career began long be
fore she first exploded into the Amer
ican gymnastics spotlight. She began
gymnastics at age three, following in
the footsteps of her older sister, Ge
nine.

"It hasn't been
difficult coming back
at a 11... It's the same
as returning from
an injury."

redshirt freshman

"My mom didn't want to watch us
while she waited for my older sister,"
Ishino said. "So she found it conven
ient to put my brothers and me in
classes also."
Gymnastics may have been substi
tute day-care, but it certainly has paid
off for Ishino's family. Genine, the
oldest sibling, was on the gymnastics
team at Cal. Both of Ishino's two

other siblings, Gian and Glen, have
also done gymnastics, and her
youngest brother will be joining the
Golden Bears next year on a gymnas
tics'scholarship.
A huge motivation for lshino in
her gymnastics career has been the
people in her life.
"My sister and Tabitha Yim were
my biggest role models growing up.
especially because Tab and 1 worked
out together when we were in elite,"
she said.
Unlike her two siblings, one of
Ishino's life-long goals was to come to
Stanford. True to form, she worked
hard and got what she wanted. In late
November of last year when she
found out that she had a blood clot in
her lungs, everyone expected her to
be crestfallen at the loss of her first
year as a Stanford gymnast. Instead,
right after her diagnosis, she came to
the team's exhibition meet with a
smile, comforting her teammates.
"My pulmonary emboli restricted
me from doing any gymnastics what
soever...only strength and condition
ing, so it was quite frustrating," she
said.
lshino has spent the last year bat
tling back but has done so gracefully
and with the kind of energy and men
tal toughness that has characterized
her entire gymnastics career.
"It hasn't been difficult coming
back at all...lt's the same as returning

from an injury. It took a little time to
get my rhythm back on certain skills,
but it's great now!" she added. "My
favorite thing is the thrill of learning
something new and the feeling you
get when all your hard work pays off
in competitions."

It may have helped that for the last
year, Ishino has kept active with
dance. She is a member of DVB. a hip
hop dance group on campus.
Even though she kept dancing
through the last year, it was no small
feat to debut her college career after
taking a full year off from competition.
Yet again. Ishino proved herself,open
ing her competitive collegiate career
against none other than No. 1 Georgia.
She barely batted an eye at the Bull
dogs with a bar and vault routine that

added major depth and a huge boost
for the Cardinal.
"My hope is to solely contribute as
much as 1 can to this program and
help the team win its first NCAA
championship," she said.
And so Ishino throws open the
door to what figures to not only be a
promising season, but a prolific Stan
ford career.
