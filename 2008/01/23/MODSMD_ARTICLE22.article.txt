# Eli might stand a chance
## 
### 
It's a sad day for football when the
hopes of a nation rest on the
shoulders of Eli Manning. Or at
least, the hopes of everyone outside
the general New England region.
I mean, really, the nation's biggest
game on its brightest stage comes
down to whether Eli, not Peyton, or
the ageless wonder Favre, or the
reincarnated ghost of Johnny U.,can
outscore Tom Brady and the just
too-good New England Patriots.
I mean, Eli versus Brady is a
punch-line, right? The young, disap
pointing New York Giants signal
caller living in the shadow cast by his
ridiculously talented older brother
and somewhat overrated father?
That's the guy who's going to do it?
ITiat's the guy who's going to bring
this 'Patriot Reign' of terror to an
end?
Yep. Believe it or not. little Eli's
all grown up.
No matter what the score or the
circumstances, you don't win at
Lambeau Field in January unless
you're very, very good. And more
importantly, you don't win at Lam
beau in subzero temperatures unless
you're also very good at blocking out
the naysaycrs and the history of the
place. Think of all the external pres
sure watching that game, that Favre
and the Packers were the team of
destiny, the team everyone wanted
to see against the Pats. The signifi
cant homefield advantage was just
another point in Green Bay's favor.
And yet it's not Brett Fav-ray or
his Packers moving on to Arizona.
It's Eli and his Giants. And you
know what? He really does have a
chance.
For one, these aren't quite the

same Patriots we saw earlier in the
year who were so good that the
other team really didn't even need
to show up. No, these are the Patri
ots who suddenly look a little slow, a
little small and a little old on de
fense. These are the Patriots who
supposedly have Randy Moss on the
roster, but his presence can't actual
ly be verified by anyone who's
watched them in the playoffs.
And the Giants? Well, the hard
nosed running of Brandon Jacobs
and Ahmad Bradshaw might some
what approximate the 1-2 Jack
sonville punch that was supposed to
give New England so much trouble.
Instead, the Patriots were perhaps
overly focused on stopping the run,
and Jaguars quarterback David
Garrard was free to run wild, play
ing one of the best games of his ca
reer. And let's just say that Plaxico
Burress is better than any receiver
the Pats had to worry about against
Jacksonville.
But maybe it's not the Giants of
fense that New England should re
ally fear. If there is one thing that
New York has done exceptionally
well to get them to this point, it's
been finding the players who might
actually be able to beat a Tom
Brady, not just be compared unfa
vorably with him.
Start with Michael Strahan and
throw in Osi Umenyiora for the
best tandem of defensive ends in
the league. Justin Tuck is a more
than competent addition to that
tandem up the middle. Indeed, the
Patriots as well as the rest of the

league should count themselves
lucky that youngster Mathias Ki
wanuka was lost to injury earlier in
the season, as the former Boston
College pass rusher was starting to
come on strong himself early in the
year.
In short, the Giants have been al
most obsessively focused on build
ing a pass rush for years. In some
ways, they've almost become one
dimensional about it, but what a di
mension that is. Take one look at
New York's current secondary and
you'll see that they've really only
considered one way to stop the
pass: crushing the quarterback
rather than covering the receivers.
But a lack of healthy secondary tal
ent may hardly matter if Brady
spends the game on his back. And
it's that pass rush, along with a
strangely competent Eli, that
should worry New England. Espe
cially with Tom Brady banged up
and trudging around town wearing
a protective boot, supposedly to
treat a 'mildly' sprained ankle.
So, while of course the Patriots
must still be considered the favorite
in every game they play until proven
otherwise, the notion that America
somehow lost out when the Giants
downed the Packers is a faulty one.
As fun as it would have been to see
Favre try for another ring against
one of the best teams the game has
ever seen, if it's an upset you're
looking for, then this is your
matchup.
Seeing Eli lead New York Giants
in that light is definitely going to
take some getting used to, though.
