# Eli might stand a chance

### 
It's a sad day for football when the
hopes of a nation rest on the
shoulders of Eli Manning. Or at
least, the hopes of everyone outside
the general New England region.
I mean, really, the nation's biggest
game on its brightest stage comes

this 'Patriot Reign' of terror to an

you're very, very good. And more

another point in Green Bay's favor.
And yet it's not Brett Fav-ray or
his Packers moving on to Arizona.
It's Eli and his Giants. And you
know what? He really does have a
chance.
For one, these aren't quite the
