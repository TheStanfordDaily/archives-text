# Wrestling back on home turf
## Card set to take on Cal State Bakersfield Thursday night 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It's been a long time since Stan
ford wrestling competed in familiar
environs. Not counting the wrestle
offs that set the squad's lineup
months ago at the start of the sea
son. the Cardinal has not competed
in its home gym since the 2006-07
season. That will all change Thurs
day evening, though, as Stanford
hosts conference rival Cal State
Bakersfield before taking on
Menlo College and Portland State
on Friday.
The Cardinal (7-2, 1-1 Pac-10)
will face its biggest test of the
homestand Thursday against the
Roadrunners (5-1. 4-1), but No. 6
senior Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds was confident that he and
his teammates could best Bakers
field before taking care of business
against the less-heralded oppo
nents on Friday.
"Thursday's definitely the big
match, and we hope to get a lot of
people out there," he said."Bakers
field's another one of our confer
ence rivals that was always kind of a
grudge match with them. We're, I
think, favored at five weights,so it's
going to be a battle, but I think if we
come out and wrestle and keep im
proving like we have been, we
should take them down.
"And then Friday's matches
against Menlo and Portland should
be a good chance for us to go out
and pick up a lot of wins," Gardner
added. "Hopefully we can win all 10
matches in both of those duals."
Gardner's fantastic perform
ance early in the season (27-1) has
played an immense role in Stan
ford's success thus far and will most
likely be a key to the Cardinal's
chances against the Roadrunners
tomorrow night. The senior captain
has already tied his previous season
high for pins (14) and is just nine
wins shy of the University's career
victories record, currently held by
volunteer assistant coach Matt

Gentry (138).
But Gardner has been far from
the only major contributor to the
Cardinal's hot start. Fellow senior
captain Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds rose to No. 10 in the nation
al rankings this week thanks to his
upset of Boise State's then-No. 10
'iyier Sherfey last week and has also
helped carry the team with a 25-5
record on the season. Sophomore
Zach Giesen. at 184 pounds, has
been another major contributor
from last season who has lived up to
expectations in the 2007-08 season.
Giesen has earned a 17-6 record to
start the season.
But it has been contributions

from more unexpected sources that
have truly propelled the Cardinal
this season to one of its best starts in
recent years. Second-year team
members Jake Johnson at 197
pounds and Lucas Espericueta at
149 pounds have racked up 18 and
19 wins on the year, respectively.
ITieir emergence, coupled with the
return of junior Luke Feist at 174
pounds — who qualified for the
NCAA tournament last season but
has missed action this season due to
injury — are a big part of why the
Cardinal can boast its most balanced
