## Kehoe named Setter of the Year 
### 
Hie honors keep rolling in for the
Stanford women's volleyball team,
whieh finished as NCAA runner-up
for the second straight year. After lead
ing the nation in assists with 14.4 per
game, senior setter Bryn Kehoe was
named the Collegiate Volleyball Up
date National Setter of the Year.
Kehoe's award complements the
recent announcement of junior middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo as the
Honda Sports Awards' best female
collegiate volleyball player in the na

all-time and season assist record; she is

four Cardinal players will all have a
