# Hardly beginner's luck for Romero
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you have ever seen him in ac
tion, you probably assume that Evan
Romero has been playing volleyball
his entire life.
But in reality, the six-foot-six op
posite hitter started later than most,
joining his high school volleyball team
during freshman year and the local
club team the summer of his junior
year.
And it all started by chance. For
most of his life, Evan has been an all
around athlete, playing football, base
ball and basketball and excelling in all
three. During his freshman year, his
basketball coach became the school's
volleyball coach and asked him to
play. He agreed.
Though at the time volleyball was
not nearly as popular in his native
Miami as on the west coast, it was def
initely beginning to gain some atten
tion. Evan's high school, Monsignor
Edwards Pace High School, had an
unremarkable volleyball program
until coach Williams took over —
Williams was extremely dedicated to
turning the team around, and, in just a
few short years, a once-average team
became a contender for the state
championship. Evan had a large influ
ence on the team's journey to success,
playing under Williams for four years.
The summer of his junior year, the
athletic director at his school recog
nized Evan's potential in volleyball
and suggested he find another avenue
through which to pursue it. Romero
was soon on the local club team.
Evan played only three months of
club volleyball, during the summers of
his junior and senior years, but gained
an immense amount of experience.
He and his teammates practiced daily
in Miami and sometimes traveled to
Puerto Rico to practice with Puerto
Rican players. The team often partici
pated in tournaments in California in
preparation for the Junior Olympics.
Evan learned from practice, but also
from the players he was practicing
with.
"I played with some great players,"
he said. "That pushed me to get better
and play up to their level."
And from there, Evan was recruit
ed. Though he was not at first official

ly recruited by Stanford, he got in con
tact with the volleyball coaches and
came to the Farm on an official visit.
He came during spring break — and
while he was not able to interact with
the larger student body or faculty, he
was able to develop an intimate rela
tionship with the volleyball players,
his future teammates.
After his visit, Evan knew that he
wanted to attend Stanford. When he
was officially accepted in April, there

was no doubt in his mind that he was
going to go.
I lis parents, though supportive of
his volleyball career, were at first a lit
tle apprehensive about his leaving to
play volleyball in California. Evan
was the first in his family to go away
for school, much less all the way
across the country.
" Iliey were apprehensive at first,
but they were happy for me," he said.
"I was going to Stanford."

When Evan was getting ready to
head out West, most of his friends and
fellow volleyball players had plans to
stay home in Miami. 1 le did not know
anyone at Stanford, with the excep
tion of the volleyball players. 1 le was.
in essence, starting afresh.
"1 wasn't scared," he said, "1 was
anxious to start and meet new peo
ple."
'ITie first week on campus, at an
athletic dinner for incoming athletes,
Evan met the fellow incoming fresh
men — Jason Palacios, Kawika Shoji,
Ed Howell and Garrett Werner.
"Since 1 did not yet have any
friends here, 1 was hoping to develop
friendships like the ones 1 had back
home," he said. "And 1 did. We bond
ed. we hung out almost all the time,
and we still do. We have a good rela
tionship off the court, which trans
lates to a good relationship on the
court."
The first week on campus, Evan
also saw his first practice.
"It was fine," he said, "but I real
ized I had a long way to go. I didn't
know how to play volleyball as well as
these guys did. 1 knew it was going to
be tough, but fun because I was going
to learn so much."
'ITie coaches especially gave Evan
a lot of attention, working with him
and helping him improve. By the time
season rolled around, Evan and many
of the other freshman players had im
proved substantially: in his first sea
son, Evan, alongside Kawika and
Garrett,started in almost every game.
The young players' game experience
grew exponentially.
All this in spite of a losing season.
"It was tough," Evan said. "Losing
that many games is obviously kind of
brutal. But the coaches did a very
good job with a young team, remind
ing us that growth and improvement
take more than just a year."
Indeed, perhaps it was because of
the substantial playing time — and
the losing — that the young team has
been able to grow and improve so
much and experience such a degree of
success this year (the team is current
ly 5-2 overall, already topping its won
total from all of last year).
Individually, Evan has become one

USC on Jan. 1 8. Despite not getting serious about volleyball until his junior
year of high school, Romero has become a key asset for the Stanford squad.
