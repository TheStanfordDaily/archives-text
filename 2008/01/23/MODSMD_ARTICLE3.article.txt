A kitchen fire broke out early Tuesday
morning in a Mirrielees apartment, and
while no one was injured, there was sub
stantial water damage to several dorm
rooms. Fourteen students have been dis
placed as a result of the damage.
The fire started after a frying pan con
taining oil was left unattended while cook
ing on a hot stove in a third-floor apart
ment. said Associate Director of Student

Housing Imogen Hinds.
Although the fire was quickly contained
in the apartment's kitchen, it eventually set
off the room's emergency sprinkler system,
which several residents said continued to
run for at least an hour before it was finally
shut down. After soaking into the third
floor room's carpet, water seeped into the
apartments below on the second and first
floors, damaging personal possessions and
electronics and rendering five Mirrielees

A resident in a third-floor Mirrielees apartment left cooking spring rolls un
attended, starting a minor kitchen fire. The flames produced enough smoke
to set off the emergency sprinkler system, which flooded five apartments.
