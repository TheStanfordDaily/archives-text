# Mirrielees flood evict 14 students
## Sprinklers stay on after dousing kitchen fire 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
A kitchen fire broke out early Tuesday
morning in a Mirrielees apartment, and
while no one was injured, there was sub
stantial water damage to several dorm
rooms. Fourteen students have been dis
placed as a result of the damage.
The fire started after a frying pan con
taining oil was left unattended while cook
ing on a hot stove in a third-floor apart
ment. said Associate Director of Student

Housing Imogen Hinds.
Although the fire was quickly contained
in the apartment's kitchen, it eventually set
off the room's emergency sprinkler system,
which several residents said continued to
run for at least an hour before it was finally
shut down. After soaking into the third
floor room's carpet, water seeped into the
apartments below on the second and first
floors, damaging personal possessions and
electronics and rendering five Mirrielees

A resident in a third-floor Mirrielees apartment left cooking spring rolls un
attended, starting a minor kitchen fire. The flames produced enough smoke
to set off the emergency sprinkler system, which flooded five apartments.
rooms uninhabitable by their cur
rent occupants.
"Our room got flooded," said Pra
Chandrasoma '09. who lives in room
336 where the fire started. "The en
tire floor was covered with water."
The 14 residents displaced by
water damage have been offered
emergency housing arrangements
until the Mirrielees rooms can be re
paired, said Executive Director of
Student 1 lousing Rodger Whitney in
an email to The Daily. Several stu
dents are currently living in the Stan
ford Guest House near the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and will be offered both short-term
and long-term housing options in
apartments and guest rooms until
they can move back into Mirrielees.
"We are working closely with the
residents to determine which hous
ing options best meet their needs
and is the least disruptive to them,"
Whitney said.
The fire began at 3:19 a.m. after
T.J. Harris '09 left oil in a frying pan
to simmer on the stove in his apart
ment's kitchen while cooking spring
rolls. When he heard a sizzling
sound. Harris said he returned to the
stove and found flames coming from
the pan.
"I shouldn't have left it unattend
ed," Harris said. "I guess I see that
now."
Since the closest fire extinguisher
was down the hallway, Harris said he
threw the pan into the sink to put the
fire out. Enough smoke had accumu
lated in the kitchen area to set off the
fire alarm and emergency sprinklers
in the room.
"I just feel bad about the whole
thing," Harris said. "It was a com
plete accident."
Armando Solis '09, who lived in
the room directly below the fire, said
he and his roommate were sleeping
when the fire alarm woke them up.
He said it was not until he had evac
uated the building with the rest of
the Mirrielees residents that he real
ized it wasn't a drill.
Solis said firefighters responding
to the scene took him and his room
mates back to his apartment, where
they found water leaking down from
the room above.
"The ceiling was just pouring
water," said Paul Lockhart-Korris

'09, one of Solis' roommates. "It was
dripping this nasty yellow water
everywhere."
Solis said he and his roommates
began pulling as many of their per
sonal items out of the room as possi
ble as water continued to seep down.
In addition to some books and
clothes, Solis said he lost his televi
sion. stereo speakers and entertain
ment system to water damage.
"We pulled out as much as we
could." Solis said, "but we lost quite
a bit."
Solis said he and several other
residents were relocated to the
Guest House until other housing
arrangements could be made.
"It's a huge hassle," Solis said,
"but I am appreciative of what the
University is doing to help us out."
The time frame for re-occupancy
will vary depending on the extent of
the damage, I linds said. Several dis
placed residents said housing offi
cials told them it could take any
where from one to four weeks be
fore they are able to return to their
rooms.
Damages to the building and
property will be evaluated by the
University Risk Management De
partment to determine how students
will be compensated for their losses.
Hinds said.
Moving around takes a lot of time
and may make things more difficult
as midterms approach, Solis said.
But he and his roommate said they
are grateful for the accommodations
Housing is willing to provide in
working with their professors to
manage their academic load and
providing meal points for dining.
"I'm pretty impressed with how
quickly the administration mobi
lized," Lockhart-Korris said. "I hope
things go smoothly from here."
Some students will likely be upset
about the fire, Chandrasoma said.
But he hopes other students will
look at the situation objectively.
"It was an honest mistake," he
said. "It could have happened to
anybody. Mistakes happen. We're all
human."
Although many of his own pos
sessions were damaged by the sprin
kler system in his apartment, Chan
drasoma said the outcome could
have been worse.
"It's an inconvenience," he said,
"but the most important thing is no
body got hurt."
