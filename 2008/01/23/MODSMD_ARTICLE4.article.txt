# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## ElecToyon spreads awareness 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
"Mmm. Obama tastes good!"
That's not a phrase one would ex
pect to hear, at least not in the public
space that is a dorm lounge. Residents
of Toyon Hall, however, might soon
find themselves munching on a Barack
Obama cookie as part of ElecToyon
'08 — a program headed by residents
to spread knowledge about the hotly
contested presidential race.
According to Toyon Resident As

sistant (RA) Brian Howald '09, Elec-
Toyon was conceived during staff re
treat as potential themes were tossed
around for the predominantly-sopho
more dorm. Together. Toyon staff and
Resident Fellows (RFs) decided the
name would work better as a program
to inform residents about the election.
"We decided that even if we weren't
going to use the name as a theme, it
would definitely be a good idea to use
it as a name for a program to increase
political awareness in the dorm."
Howald said.

"I wanted to make sure
that there was information
readily available to Toyon res

dents on election issues and candidates
so that they could be more well-in
formed and not have to work too hard
at it," said Toyon RF Amy Friedman.
Increasing political awareness —
not pressure to vote — is the primary
objective of ElecToyon, stressed resi
dent Matt Sprague 10, who creates in
formative flyers to post around the
dorm.
"Our idea is that if you put up infor-

in it, maybe they II
become more interested in

politics and become more informed."
Sprague said. "That's our overall ob
jective."
Since the start of the school year.
ElecToyon leaders have posted flyers
in the halls and bathrooms with week
ly questions; caucus and primary dates
for both the Democratic and Republi-

Yesterday, Republican presidential candidate Ron
Paul spoke in a conference call to a group of student jour
nalists, including a reporter from The Daily, about his views
on various critical issues.
On his support from youth:
■ "They like the Constitution, the young people
like that. They like principle, and they also
like the concept of personal liberty — that
is, it's your life to lead as you choose and
people don't like to be told by the govern
ment everything they can do."
On abortion:
■ "It isn't so much protecting only the mother's
rights. You have this other life we have to
deal with. To deny that a baby — right be
fore birth — has no rights, sort of defies
logic and legal standing. So I just come
down on the side of saying that both lives
hove to be protected."
On the war:
■ "One of the issues that has gotten attention
has been the war issue... because about 70
percent of American people right now are
frustrated with the war, and the burden of
war falls on young people too. Not only fi
nancially, but for those individuals who have
to go over and fight, and the threat that the
war may be spread. The fact that the selec
tive service still exists, many people are con
cerned there may be resumption of the
draft."
On being a dark horse candidate:
■ "I put my name out there reluctantly, not be

lieving there would be very many young
people or very much money. But we've bro
ken all kinds of records. We raised [S6 mil
lion] in one day, and yesterday we hod over
[5,000] new people joining us."
On economics:
■ "A weak dollar means big, big trouble for
every one of us. That means the cost of every
body's education is going to skyrocket, the
cost of energy is going to skyrocket, and we're
trying to solve the problems of inflation with
inflation. What we have to do is we have to
quit the inflation, we have to allow the bad
debt to be liquidated, we have to lower taxes
dramatically, we have to cut spending, we
have to balance the budget, we have to re
store confidence in the dollar."
On the effect of evolution on global
warming:
■ "I don't take a position that there's no evidence
for evolution, I'm just saying there's no proof
of anything — that's why it's called a theory.
And I don't know why there can't be a combi
nation of a creator bringing about our creation
and our life at the same time."
On his polarizing candidacy:
■ "I am very, very determined, but I work very
hard at trying not to polarize. I deliberately
make an attempt not to be provocative, but
not to ever give up on the principle and
some people might not understand that
completely. Once they discover the principles
of liberty and what our constitution soys and

can parties; and details-regarding
the operations of a caucus and pri
mary.
"They do place their flyers pret
ty strategically," said Leia Lorica TO
with a laugh. "I can't help but read
them."
Regarding future ElecToyon
events, Sprague said he is planning a
change in tone.
"We have to break the ice a little
more to get people talking," he said.
"We might do a more humorous
event."
Ideas on the table include hav
ing residents pitch for certain can
didates in the lounge prior to a cau
cus or primary; naming each hall of
the dorm after a candidate and
having representatives take part in
a game of Halo to advance their
candidates in a mock primary; and
baking cookies featuring the faces
of each candidate. Already, resi
dents have had "politics and pop
corn" nights during the numerous
televised debates between candi
dates.
Friedman said she would also
like to hold events that would allow
international residents to share
their perspectives on both U.S. poli
tics and politics in their native coun
tries.
The staff members of various
other dorms have been informing
their residents about dates such as
voter registration deadlines, but
none has a program as structured as

ElecToyon.
"I'm not aware of anything we're
doing officially," said Roble RA
Daniel Novinson '08. who is also a
Daily staff writer, in an email to The
Daily. "I'm just forwarding registra
tion emails and the like to my resi
dents."
Terra RA Benjie Nelson '07 ad
mitted that while his house does not
take part in any similar program,
the idea is a good one.
For the most part, Toyon resi
dents are enthusiastic about their
dorm's program.
"I've seen the signs in the bath
room and I get really excited when I
see them," said Cooper Lloyd '10.
"They definitely keep me in
formed."
Lorica said without the numer
ous flyers posted around the dorm,
voter apathy would take over.
"[The flyers] keep me well in
formed," Lorica said. "Otherwise 1
really don't care anymore."
However, Caitlin Crandell '10
did express disappointment at the
posted flyers, noting that they say
the dorm will be taking part in activ
ities but the plans often don't reach
fruition.
Nevertheless, Howald and
Sprague are optimistic that Elec-
Toyon '08 has been and will contin
ue to be a service to Toyon resi
dents.
"No one really knows how a pri
mary works," Sprague said."l didn't
even know until I made the flyer.
You have to be informed before
your voting is productive."

Yesterday, Republican presidential candidate Ron
Paul spoke in a conference call to a group of student jour
nalists, including a reporter from The Daily, about his views
on various critical issues.
On his support from youth:
■ "They like the Constitution, the young people
like that. They like principle, and they also
like the concept of personal liberty — that
is, it's your life to lead as you choose and
people don't like to be told by the govern
ment everything they can do."
On abortion:
■ "It isn't so much protecting only the mother's
rights. You have this other life we have to
deal with. To deny that a baby — right be
fore birth — has no rights, sort of defies
logic and legal standing. So I just come
down on the side of saying that both lives
hove to be protected."
On the war:
■ "One of the issues that has gotten attention
has been the war issue... because about 70
percent of American people right now are
frustrated with the war, and the burden of
war falls on young people too. Not only fi
nancially, but for those individuals who have
to go over and fight, and the threat that the
war may be spread. The fact that the selec
tive service still exists, many people are con
cerned there may be resumption of the
draft."
On being a dark horse candidate:
■ "I put my name out there reluctantly, not be

lieving there would be very many young
people or very much money. But we've bro
ken all kinds of records. We raised [S6 mil
lion] in one day, and yesterday we hod over
[5,000] new people joining us."
On economics:
■ "A weak dollar means big, big trouble for
every one of us. That means the cost of every
body's education is going to skyrocket, the
cost of energy is going to skyrocket, and we're
trying to solve the problems of inflation with
inflation. What we have to do is we have to
quit the inflation, we have to allow the bad
debt to be liquidated, we have to lower taxes
dramatically, we have to cut spending, we
have to balance the budget, we have to re
store confidence in the dollar."
On the effect of evolution on global
warming:
■ "I don't take a position that there's no evidence
for evolution, I'm just saying there's no proof
of anything — that's why it's called a theory.
And I don't know why there can't be a combi
nation of a creator bringing about our creation
and our life at the same time."
On his polarizing candidacy:
■ "I am very, very determined, but I work very
hard at trying not to polarize. I deliberately
make an attempt not to be provocative, but
not to ever give up on the principle and
some people might not understand that
completely. Once they discover the principles
of liberty and what our constitution soys and

can parties; and details-regarding
the operations of a caucus and pri
mary.
"They do place their flyers pret
ty strategically," said Leia Lorica TO
with a laugh. "I can't help but read
them."
Regarding future ElecToyon
events, Sprague said he is planning a
change in tone.
"We have to break the ice a little
more to get people talking," he said.
"We might do a more humorous
event."
Ideas on the table include hav
ing residents pitch for certain can
didates in the lounge prior to a cau
cus or primary; naming each hall of
the dorm after a candidate and
having representatives take part in
a game of Halo to advance their
candidates in a mock primary; and
baking cookies featuring the faces
of each candidate. Already, resi
dents have had "politics and pop
corn" nights during the numerous
televised debates between candi
dates.
Friedman said she would also
like to hold events that would allow
international residents to share
their perspectives on both U.S. poli
tics and politics in their native coun
tries.
The staff members of various
other dorms have been informing
their residents about dates such as
voter registration deadlines, but
none has a program as structured as

ElecToyon.
"I'm not aware of anything we're
doing officially," said Roble RA
Daniel Novinson '08. who is also a
Daily staff writer, in an email to The
Daily. "I'm just forwarding registra
tion emails and the like to my resi
dents."
Terra RA Benjie Nelson '07 ad
mitted that while his house does not
take part in any similar program,
the idea is a good one.
For the most part, Toyon resi
dents are enthusiastic about their
dorm's program.
"I've seen the signs in the bath
room and I get really excited when I
see them," said Cooper Lloyd '10.
"They definitely keep me in
formed."
Lorica said without the numer
ous flyers posted around the dorm,
voter apathy would take over.
"[The flyers] keep me well in
formed," Lorica said. "Otherwise 1
really don't care anymore."
However, Caitlin Crandell '10
did express disappointment at the
posted flyers, noting that they say
the dorm will be taking part in activ
ities but the plans often don't reach
fruition.
Nevertheless, Howald and
Sprague are optimistic that Elec-
Toyon '08 has been and will contin
ue to be a service to Toyon resi
dents.
"No one really knows how a pri
mary works," Sprague said."l didn't
even know until I made the flyer.
You have to be informed before
your voting is productive."

"Mmm. Obama tastes good!"
That's not a phrase one would ex
pect to hear, at least not in the public
space that is a dorm lounge. Residents
of Toyon Hall, however, might soon
find themselves munching on a Barack
Obama cookie as part of ElecToyon
'08 — a program headed by residents
to spread knowledge about the hotly
contested presidential race.
According to Toyon Resident As

sistant (RA) Brian Howald '09, Elec-
Toyon was conceived during staff re
treat as potential themes were tossed
around for the predominantly-sopho
more dorm. Together. Toyon staff and
Resident Fellows (RFs) decided the
name would work better as a program
to inform residents about the election.
"We decided that even if we weren't
going to use the name as a theme, it
would definitely be a good idea to use
it as a name for a program to increase
political awareness in the dorm."
Howald said.

"I wanted to make sure
that there was information
readily available to Toyon res

dents on election issues and candidates
so that they could be more well-in
formed and not have to work too hard
at it," said Toyon RF Amy Friedman.
Increasing political awareness —
not pressure to vote — is the primary
objective of ElecToyon, stressed resi
dent Matt Sprague 10, who creates in
