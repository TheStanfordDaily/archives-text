## Separated twins head backhome Formerly conjoined sisters happy & healthy 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Formerly conjoined twins Fiorella
and Yurelia Rocha-Arias are ready to
go home.The two-year-old girls were
separated Nov. 12 in a nine-hour sur
gery at Lucille Packard Children's
I iospital.
Before their separation surgery.
Yurelia and Fiorella were joined at
the chest and abdomen, with a shared
heart chamber and fused livers. After
five weeks in the hospital.the girls are
now "healthy and safe," according to
their lead surgeon. Gary Hartman, a
clinical professor m pediatric surgery.
Yurelia and Fiorella met the
media yesterday afternoon wearing
matching polka-dot dresses. Both
girls sported dark curly pigtails, and
Fiorella wore a white sweater that
matched Yurelia's pink one. Hie en
ergetic twins seemed unfazed by pho
tographers' flashbulbs; they spent the
press conference babbling to each
other, sitting on their mother's lap
and playing on the floor with toys set
out for them.
Hartman expressed relief at the
girls' recovery and told the story of
when he first met the twins at their
home in San Jose, Costa Rica. The
house was full of relatives, neighbors
and other well-wishers, and Hartman
said he felt so emotional he was "al
most catatonic."
"1 was taking these girls away, and
I knew 1 might not bring them back,"
he said. "I could not get that out of my
brain."
Hartman had previously estimat
ed the chance of both girls surviving
the surgery at 50 percent.
The twins' mother. Maria Rocha-
Arias, thanked the specialists at
Packard and the officials from Mend
ing Kids International, the charity
that paid for Yurelia and Fiorella's
care. She also thanked God and
everyone who prayed for the twins.
"Thanks to everyone for being
here for me and for loving our girls,"
Maria said, speaking through a Span
ish interpreter.
Yurelia and Fiorella are the
youngest of 11 children, and for the
last month their oldest sister Cynthia
has been in the country with her

mother and sisters. Cynthia said
Yurelia and Fiorella remember being
conjoined and that they never like to
be far apart.
Maria added that right after the
girls woke up from surgery, they
started looking for each other.
"They still always lie down to
sleep together," she added.
Maria was asked if the girls have
had any personality changes since
their separation.
"Before the separation, if Fiorella
wanted water and Yurelia wanted to
eat, they would start fighting," Maria
said."Now that they're separated, it's
the same. They're still fighting."
It seems that like most two-year
olds, Yurelia and Fiorella have a stub
born streak.
Asked if she could get the twins to
say anything for the news cameras,
Maria turned to the toddlers on her
lap. "Say hi," she asked, first to Yure
lia and then to Fiorella.The girls both
ignored her request.
"They don't like being told what
to do," Maria explained.
