## Graduate Life Go Pass, Go 
### 
I'm on record as saying that student politics —
the Graduate Student Council in particular —
are utterly without use. purpose or value, but

from time to time I'll pay attention to democra
cy, and what it's pretending to do for me.

While our illustrious representa
tives typically work to find ever more in
ventive ways to fail miserably at social
izing the masses, every now and then
they advocate for our rights.
One such right is, apparently, the
fc right to travel for free. For some
* time now. the GSC has been trying
to persuade the University to
provide the graduate student pop
ulation (or some section of it) with
GO Passes, which grant free Caltrain

travel.
There are two reasons that 1 closely follow

the activities of the GO Pass Action Group.
First, I'm incredibly selfish. Anything that
makes my life easier and cheaper is therefore an

unalloyed good. So. since I live in the city, I
equate free Caltrain travel with the better-

ment of mankind.
Secondly, and much more

importantly, I have a crush on one of
the GO Pass Action Groupies.
Signing up to the listserv means I
get occasional emails from the
girl, and there's nothing quite
like an impersonal mass mes
sage from to set your heart
aflutter...
These fantasies are far
less important than me and my
selfishness, though, so let's focus
on that.
Because of the way Caltrain sells
GO Passes, the University is forced

to buy them either for every graduate
student, or for every off-campus

graduate student.This means spending a lot
of money (hundreds of thousands of dollars),

and that money has to come from somewhere.
Except there aren't that many people who actu

ally want the pass.The only people who find it gen
uinely useful are those that live in the city,and there
really aren't that many of us.
At the same time, a large number of city
dwellers wouldn't stop driving, even given the
opportunity to double our transit time and mas
sively increase our hassle.
So, the GO Pass scheme: Hugely expensive and
beneficial to a tiny minority of graduate students
— sounds perfect for advocacy.
To begin with, the focus was on getting the Uni
versity to pay. This failed, for the obvious reason
that it's not really a practical use of the money
Now, Stanford has some motivation for reducing
the number of peak time campus commuters
(doing so is part of Stanford's unhealthy relation
ship with Santa Clara County), but giving us train
tickets is hardly the most efficient way to do this.
Once the University's refusal to pony up be
came apparent, most of the efforts of subsidizing
the San Franciscans have focused on extracting
money trom the pedestrian students who chose not
to live amid the bright lights of the city.
The plans have varied in their egregiousness
(my personal favorite required every grad student
to pay $45 to fund GO Passes only for those off
campus), but they all rested on the same founda
tion — a foundation premised on the superiority of
my needs over yours.
If 1 proposed to the GSC that every grad student
pay $100 so that everyone with a birthday in No
vember could get $1200 a piece, I'd be laughed out
of the room. But here's the thing: dress up the pro
posal with a little environmentalism, a dash of uni
versality and just a pinch of entitlement, and sud
denly you sound reasonable.

anywhere with one of its principle advocates? Email
