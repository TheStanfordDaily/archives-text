January 23,1979:
Pro-choice rally defends
women's abortion rights
"Human rights must include
women's rights, and women's rights
must include fertility rights," said
Steven Hygh, Santa Clara County
Commission information coordina
tor for Planned Parenthood, in a
Pro-choice rally in White Plaza yes
terday.
Speaking to a crowd of about a
hundred people, including many
men, Hygh said that he, as a male, was
concerned with human rights in any
form. "The freedom and liberty of

mankind are inextricably bound to
the freedom and liberty of wom
ankind.
"No woman can call herself free
until she can control her own fertili
ty," Hygh said, quoting Margaret
Sanger, founder of Planned Parent
hood.
Hygh criticized the Right-to-Life
group and similar organizations. He
said such groups are "relentless, om
nipresent and fanatical."
Hygh also said that opposition
groups are motivated by what he
called a fear of sex and the belief
there should be "no pleasure without
punishment."
Suzanne Case, a member of the
Stanford Committee on Reproduc

tive Rights, expressed similar con
cerns.
Case said that "we cannot allow
any one of our hard won rights to he
take away."
The rally was held to commemo
rate the sixth anniversary of the Jan.
22, 1973 Supreme Court decision
which made abortion legal.according
to Dawn Upchurch, one of the three
rally organizers.

sored the rally in connection with the

the cause of pro-choice.
