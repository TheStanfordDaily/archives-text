## Grads confused by dual degree options 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
Some graduate students are not
fully aware that they can complete
a dual or joint degree program
from two different schools while at
Stanford. Other students are not
informed of the current dual and
joint degree programs that are of
fered, or simply do not know the
requirements.
At the Graduate Student
Council meeting last night, mem
bers of the Committee on Gradu
ate Studies (CGS) — a branch of
the ASSU appointed by the Uni
versity's Academic Council — af
firmed they are working towards
clarifying the process and guide
lines of joint and dual degrees that
can be conferred at the graduate
level
The CGS members oversee
areas including graduate admis
sions, mini mum standards for grad
uate work, graduate financial aid,
minority recruitment and reten
tion and the initiation and renewal
of graduate degree programs.
According to CGS member
Chris Warshaw, a doctoral student
in political science. University poli
cies on dual degrees and joint de
gree programs for graduate stu
dents are fairly unclear.
"We are working on making the
process more standardized and
transparent," Warshaw said. "We
are on the committee and we can't
even figure out some of the defini
tions of the degree types. We un
derstand that most of the members
of the graduate student body are
not very sure of what those defini
tions are."
Currently, graduate students
who are working on a doctorate
can apply to another school and
work towards a master's degree or
vice versa, provided that both
schools approve the student's ap
plication.

Credit requirements may vary
from graduate program to gradu
ate program, and from student to
student. Schools and departments
that partner together in joint de
grees may have specific require
ments or limitations, Warshaw
said.
"There is an application process
for students and it is specific to the
particular joint degree or dual de
gree program that the student is
applying to," said CGS member
Carolyn Snyder, a third year doc
toral student.
According to Snyder, courses
are selected for dual crediting be
cause they encompass work that
could sensibly apply to either de
gree for a student who was not
seeking both. In this way. students
are able to fully satisfy the require
ments for both degrees in much
less time.
Stanford Law School, Snyder
explained, makes it possible to
earn a joint degree in as little as
three years and at vastly lower cost
than they would at other institu
tions, thanks to a dual-crediting
system.The Law School will accept
a certain number of credits earned
in another school or department
toward the J.D.. meaning the same
class will satisfy the requirements
of both degrees.
But the process of standardiz
ing the guidelines of joint degree
programs and dual degree pro
grams is preventing the committee
from focusing on other issues that
are equally important to the gradu
ate student body, according to Sny
der.
"We want this process to be
transparent not only to the stu
dents, but also to the committee, so
that we can also focus on other
equally important issues," Snyder
said.
