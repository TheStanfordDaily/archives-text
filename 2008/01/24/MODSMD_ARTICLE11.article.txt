Cleavage, fashion shoots and catfights
have long been staples of tabloids and
gossip magazines. What's troubling,
however, is the recent migration of such triv
ial matters into serious publications.
The Washington Post ran an 800-word ar
ticle last February on Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton's (D-NY) "cleavage on display"
during a C-SPAN2 speech. A "Hillary Clin
ton and cleavage" search on The New York
limes Web site yields 18 results (although
admittedly, several of the articles critique
the amount of attention Clinton's outfit gar
nered). Sen. Barack Obama's(D-Ill.) spread
in GQ Magazine earned a similar amount of
attention. Even the staid Wall Street Journal
commented on Obama's penchant for a ca
sual. no-tie style in an article entitled
"Pulling Off the Obama Look."
Serious issues, however, are overshad
owed by the constant buzzing of salacious
gossip in serious print media and on 24-hour
news channels. The subject of Clinton's C
SPAN2 address was the prohibitive cost of
higher education — a topic many of us are
no doubt concerned with — yet cable news
channels, and even the Post, focused on the
barest hint of skin.
Similarly, although it was excellent that
so many viewers tuned into last Monday's
Democratic debate (it was the most
watched presidential primary debate in
cable television history, attracting an aver
age of 4.9 million viewers), the post-debate
analysis on many news shows highlighted
the candidates' bitter personal attacks on
one another, focusing much less on the is
sues of the debate, such as healthcare and
the Iraq War.
What is most distressing, however, is that
this is what we are asking for. In their book.
"Politicians Don't Pander," political scien
tists Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro
explore the impact of public opinion on
public policy, noting that "the media's orga
nizational, financial.and professional incen
tives prompt them to exaggerate the degree
of conflict in order to produce simple, capti
vating stories for their audiences."
The mass media, as much as we want to
hold it to the high standards of the Fourth

Estate, is made up of competing businesses
try ing to make the most profits. As print
publications face the challenges of online
media, and round-the-clock news stations
scramble to find enough news to fill their
schedules, news is whatever we, the audi
ence, respond and listen to.
Print media has indeed fallen on hard
times. The Pew Internet and American Life
Project released a 2005 study showing that
72 percent of teens get their news and cur
rent events information online. The report
ed daily circulation of The Washington Post
has dropped from 779,898 to 709,500 in the
past five years. Although paid circulation
comprises only about 20 percent of a news
paper's revenue, the loss in readership af
fects ad revenue as well, limiting the publi
cation's reporting capabilities. In our pop
culture-obsessed society, sensation sells, and
newspapers are hoping it will sell the news,
too.
It wasn't always this way, though. Just a
few decades ago, JFK's dalliances in the
White House were well-known but re
mained largely unreported. Bill Clinton's
peccadilloes, however, were splashed across
news headlines in publications ranging from
The limes to the tabloids. Recently, even
John Edwards' sex life cropped up in an
awkward Esquire interview in which he was
asked how he managed to break his wife
Elizabeth's rib with a hug.
To end the stream of silly sound-bites and
nonstop Jamie-Lynn Spears coverage we
need only turn off our TVs and read serious,
thoughtful articles instead. The media truly
does respond to the whims of its readers and
viewers. If CNN's ratings skyrocketed after
a polished and well-moderated debate — as
opposed to the open-ended format anchor
Wolf Blitzer used, which was highly con
ducive to catfighting — stations would offer
more serious political commentary, and less
sensational shows.
While there is certainly a time and place
for a little celebrity gossip — after all, even
the limes has a Style Section for listing
those fashion faux pas — it's time we made
coverage about more than how much cleav
age our politicians are showing.
