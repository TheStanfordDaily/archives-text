## The
						problem with buying healthcare 
### 
Healthcare in America is in crisis.
Costs are rising, fewer and fewer em
ployers are providing coverage and
insurance companies have become a cover
age-denial racket rather than a healthcare
solution. Presumably, if you wanted to write
a healthcare bill, you would start by trying to
control healthcare costs, providing coverage
to more people, increasing eligibility and re
ducing denials.
That starting point seems obvious to me,
but based on the current healthcare bill
under consideration in the California legis
lature's special session. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger is coming at the problem
from a different angle.
The bill starts with a mandate to purchase
healthcare. We don't want people "opting
out" of health insurance, so a mandate may
be part of a good universal coverage plan.
But the flip side to Schwarzenegger's bill is
that it often does not help people purchase
coverage. For many, it is all stick and no car
rot — the bill authorizes the tax board to
garnish wages or put liens on homes to pay
for insurance.There are waivers for econom
ic hardship, but as Sheila Kuehl. the smartest
person in the state legislature, points out, "if
you are excused from the mandatory pur
chase of insurance, you simply have no in
surance!" TTiis is central, not peripheral, to
the issue.
Hie bill requires employers to "pay or
play," to provide insurance themselves or
put between one and seven percent of their
payroll into a state fund to provide insur
ance for their employees. Many businesses
currently pay 10 percent or more of their
payroll to cover health insurance. If the state
told me I could pay 10 percent myself or that
I could pay six and a half percent and they
would pick up the rest.it would not be a hard
decision for me to make.
The remainder of the costs would be paid
for by cigarette taxes, hospital taxes, federal
money and the state budget. This funding is
not in the bill, but would be part of a sepa
rate ballot initiative that has not yet been
written. If the ballot initiative did not pass,
the whole thing would probably be off, al
though it is not entirely certain whether the
individual insurance mandate would then
actually be dropped.
The real problem with this approach is

that Schwarzenegger came to the table with
"we can't tax the employers or regulate the
insurance companies," and Assembly
Speaker Fabian Nunez came in with "every
one must be covered" — and they both
pretty much said "great" and walked away.
I"he resulting bill requires everyone to get
coverage, but it will mean that employers
chip in less to help with the cost. The com
promise demands coverage rather than pro
viding it.
Because they fudged where the money
comes from, they also had to fudge how
much coverage this money was going to buy.
Standards and prices for state-pool-funded
healthcare are not specified in the law and
will be set at some future date by the Man
aged Risk Medical Insurance Board; there
are no standards for employer-provided
healthcare. There are assurances that subsi
dies will be provided for the poor, but no de
tails on what those will be. Premiums may be
subsidized, for example, but it is likely that
co-pays, deductibles and out-of-pocket ex
penses will be unlimited.
Any savings we get out of the health in
surance system are going to have to come
from fundamental overhaul, such as a
Medicare-for-all type proposal that would
provide universal coverage of the quality of
Medicare or the Veterans' Administration,
at a super-low overhead. If people wanted
more coverage they could purchase it pri
vately. but a minimum would be available to
those who did not.
In other words,"Medicare-for-all" would
control costs, provide coverage to more peo
ple, and end care denials, unlike the
Schwarzenegger-Nunez bill. Funny that
when the Medicare-for-all bill. Kuehl's SB
K4O, reached his desk over a year ago,
Schwarzenegger vetoed it.
