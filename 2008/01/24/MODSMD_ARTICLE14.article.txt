# Dirty Cal Student
## Loving your bubbles 
### 
As a former,dirty,Cal student, I've seen
the full range of anti-Stanford senti
ment: chemistry professors changing
red solutions to blue, football chants that
connect the word Stanford with an appropri
ate expletive and T-shirts depicting trees en
gaged in unspeakable acts. Aside from these
standard expressions, feelings toward Stan
ford also manifest themselves in everyday
conversation — claims that Berkeley has
close access to good food, that Berkeley stu
dents are sexier than their Stanford counter
parts — the usual.
Then there are the darker comments, that
Stanford students are spoiled, that they live
in a bubble — the usual bullshit. I love
Berkeley, but sometimes we embarrass our
selves by engaging in stupid rhetoric. Al
though Stanford's trash-talking can be equal
ly ridiculous, I think these spoiled, live-in-a
bubble claims deserve a closer look.
The spoiled and bubble claims have no
merit. When Cal students call Stanford stu
dents spoiled in an economic sense, they
often base it off their own background.This is
ridiculous, since a lot of Cal students come
from the same economic background as
Stanford students.
More broadly speaking, purporting that
wealth reflects poorly on your character is to
tally misguided. First, its just plain weird: last
time I checked, people wanted to be rich.

Rappers don't usually say "I can't pay dis bill,
but'ey,dat's chill!" Driving a Porsche doesn't
make you evil, but trying to run over a poor
man with your Porsche while screaming "Eat
shit, riff-raff!" probably does. You can be an
asshole if you are rich or poor; it's just that
being rich probably affords you more oppor
tunities to do so.
There are similar problems with the Stan
ford-is-a-bubble argument. Although
Berkeley's surrounding neighborhoods can
look a bit gruff, Cal students are just as insu
lated from non-university concerns as Stan
ford students. And what the hell is a bubble
anyway? A different dimension that is phys
ically separated from the known universe? If
you based your perspective from the war
zone in Darfur, nearly EVERYWHERE
would be a "bubble." Disparity is, unfortu
nately, the reality of this world — in one part
of the world you wonder if a bullet or disease
will kill you, in the other you anguish over
midterms. People want to move from one

"bubble" to the other; that process is called
upward mobility.
It is true that attending Stanford affords
certain privileges. The real question is if those
privileges are deserved. I'd say yes. For the
most part, earning the right to attend Stan
ford involves a lot of really hard work.There
may be some issues with legacy clauses and
affordability (to a lesser extent now due to
recent financial aid developments), but on
the whole these are overshadowed by the ef
fort most students put in to attend Stanford.
Even if your attendance at an institution
stems from your parents' ability to afford it,
is that necessarily a bad thing? Didn't they
work hard for their money, sacrificing so that
you could attend pricey institutions? They
didn't put in all that effort so that you would
get your education from the streets.
If you arc lucky enough to be in a pleasant
"bubble," then grab a beer and toast it. The
only real obligation you have is to enjoy and
appreciate your bubble. If you haven't al
ready, you have this columnist's express ap
proval to flip the bird to anyone who deni
grates you simply because of your surround
ings. While you're at it, tell them to take a
bubble bath to clean up their act. Especially
those dirty Cal students, right?
