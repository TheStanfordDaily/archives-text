## Energized debate over Energy Act 
### 
In December 2007, Congress passed the Energy Act, with provisions including: boosting gas mileage in manufactured cars,
increasing biofuels in gas, phasing out incandescent light bulbs and increasing research on carbon sequestration technolo
gies. Stanford in Government asked three campus political groups if this legislation encompasses the best U.S. energy policy.

Energy Act hurts
producers, consumers
Unfortunately, Congress cannot magical
ly wave away all of our problems simply by
passing a law. In fact, our problems usually
increase despite Congress' best intentions.
The case may prove no different with this
year's energy bill, which slaps new restrictive
rules on our already struggling American car

manufacturers in Michigan.currently the na
tion's unemployment leader. But let us ig
nore for a moment the pain that the bill will
inflict on American workers and companies
and talk about the American consumer —
which includes all of us in this more fragile
economy. It's estimated that these oppres
sive regulations will increase the costs of cars
by as much as $10,000, boosting the average
pricc of a vehicle to nearly $40,000.

Nevertheless, we do feel that the United
States government should do its best to move
our country toward energy independence.
We need to invest substantially in alternative
energy, but we should also realize that higher
gas prices will force the market to do the
same. After all, only six percent of our energy
needs are currently met by renewable
sources of energy, and every year our
consumption grows more than the en
tire biofuel industry. We also need to
initiate energy exploration for more
American resources, including limited
portions of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge (ANWR). Ultimately, we rec
ognize the importance of being good
stewards of the environment — but we
also realize that this is not some fanci
ful world in which our actions have no
consequences.There must be a balance
that ensures the strength of the Ameri
can economy — and the jobs of Amer
ican workers.

Improve Energy Act by
stopping big oil

The Energy Act is an indisputably

important step toward sound energy
policy for the United States. For the
first time in more than 30 years, legisla
tors have agreed to increase minimum
efficiency standards for cars. By 2020,
new auto fleets must average at least
35 miles per gallon, compared to the
25 miles per gallon requirement
today. According to The Washington
Post, this requirement could reduce
American oil use by 1.1 million bar
rels a day.the equivalent of taking 28
million cars off the road.
Unfortunately, President George
W. Bush and his Republican allies in
Congress continue to side with oil ex
ecutives by keeping tax breaks for oil
companies in place, effectively slam
ming the door on comprehensive
changes in our energy policy. Addi
tionally. Republicans in Congress re
fused to allow a mandate that utilities
nationwide produce 15 percent of
their electricity from renewable
sources. With tax breaks for oil compa
nies and no real commitment to re
newable fuels, we remain dangerously
reliant on unstable and hostile parts of
the world to power our nation.
While the Energy Act moves the
United States in the right direction by

implementing gradual but significant
steps toward reducing our dependence
on foreign oil, the act alone is not suffi
cient energy policy. As long as oil com
panies get tax breaks from the govern
ment. there will be no financial incen
tive for them to work toward innova
tive, more efficient solutions. This act
doesn't come close to solving our ener
gy crisis, but it lays a foundation upon
which future solutions can be built.

The downsides
of the Energy Act

The recent 2007 energy bill is hard
ly an ideal energy bill, either for the
American people or even for world
consumers in general.
The first issue of boosting gas
mileage in cars has several negative im
pacts. Beyond the implicit price in
crease in cars that mast conform to the
new standards, it is not even clear that
increasing the mileage standard will
even accomplish the goal of reducing
carbon emissions and helping the envi
ronment; many economists have shown
that this sort of measure actually offers
an incentive to drive even more: If your
car suddenly will go more miles for the
same price, you might actually take the
job with a longer commute that you
might not have considered before.
Ethanol — the favorite biofuel of
the seeming enviro-enthusiasts — was

mandated to increase by five times as a
percentage in the composition of gas.
If there were sufficient market de
mand for ethanol, why would there be
a need to mandate its production? It is
already far too expensive to be com
petitive. In addition, the government is
already spending a great deal of
money subsidizing its production; this
measure has had far-reaching negative
impacts on a variety of sectors — not
just the price of gasoline. The use of
com for ethanol has decreased the
supply of corn for food and feed for
cattle, which increases the prices of
food.Think this only affects the United
States? Think again: we do not have as
much staple food to export to third
world countries, and other countries
that grow corn, such as Mexico, have
seen their prices of tortillas and basic
foods for the poor increase dramati
cally.
According to an lowa State Uni
versity study, the fivefold increase in
the ethanol mandate could cost each
household over several hundred dol
lars annually in food bills.
These are just two issues that are
fundamentally wrong with this bill.
Energy independence is something
that the United States must take seri
ously, but these measures have gone it
about in quite the wrong way, at the
detriment of every American con
sumer.
