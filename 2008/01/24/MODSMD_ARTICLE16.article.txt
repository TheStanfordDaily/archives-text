There is Oscar fever in our midst,
but one man on campus is right at the
heart of the drama. Graduate School
of Business Lecturer Bill Guttentag
— a former Knight Fellow who now
teaches a class on leadership in the
entertainment industry — has made
a film that was short-listed for an
Oscar.
Gutten tag's documentary,
"Nanking," has been a top-grossing
film internationally, second only to
Michael Moore's "Sicko." The film
was also nominated for the Grand
Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Fes
tival. In addition, it is one of only 20
films selected to play in China — un
censored.The fact that the country in
which these horrors occurred has left
the film uncensored surprised many,
including Guttentag himself.
After reading Iris Chang's "The
Rape of Nanking," Guttentag no
ticed the words "Forgotten Holo
caust" on the book's back cover. He
was vexed.
"1 believe the words 'forgotten
[and] Holocaust'should not be in the
same sentence," Guttentag said. "It
was a story that should be told. Not
enough people know."
For six weeks during WWII, the
citizens of Nanking, China, were
under the reign of the invading
Japanese army. Soldiers murdered
and raped the populace to a "stagger
ing" degree, according to Guttentag.
But a small group of western mis
sionaries living in Nanking at the
time provided a safety zone for the
Chinese refugees.Together, these in
dividuals saved approximately
250,(HX) lives. Their stories are retold
in Guttentag's documentary through
a stage reading, infused with actual
video footage and photographs
taken during the invasion.
In a real story, Guttentag said,
there is no distance between the
characters and the viewer.The audi
ence is pulled in because the show is
not an act.
"When you see these stories, you

see that they're real people," he said.
Guttentag has produced and di
rected other documentaries such as
'Twin Towers" and "You Don't Have
to Die," the story of a boy's struggle
with cancer.

"It was a story
that should be
told."
BILL GUTTENTAG,
GSB Lecturer

"I think you always look for com
pelling, strong stories to tell." he says.
"You always look for stories that in
spire people, that move people.
Maybe you can't change people's
minds, but you can at least start a di
alogue and make people think; chal
lenge their thoughts and views."
Guttentag is already working on
his next project: retelling the story of
the American Civil Rights Move
ment through a musical documen
tary. Though "Nanking" did not
make the final Oscar cut, Guttentag
has previously won two Oscars for
his other films and been nominated
for three.
"It's nice to get recognition for
your work." he said. "But ultimately,
at the end of the day, you just make
the best film you can."
"Nanking" is currently playing in
21 cities including San Jose. For more
