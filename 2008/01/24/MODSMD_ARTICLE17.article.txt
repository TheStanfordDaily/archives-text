## Bill Clinton lashes into Obama 
### CHARLES BABINGTON THE ASSOCIATED 
DILLON. SC. - Bill Clinton said
Wednesday he expects blacks to vote
for Barack Obama and women to
vote for Miliary Rodham Clinton,
and the dynamic may cause his wife
to lose (he South Carolina Democra
tic presidential primary Saturday
The comments by the former
president — who also lashed out at
Obama and the news media — mark
one of the starkest commentaries yet
on the possible role of race, although
it has been a subtext of the Obama-
Clinton rivalry for months.The com
ments also furthered the Clintons'
bid to play down Sen. Clinton's
chances of winning in a state where
Obama seems to be ahead.
Voting for president along racial
and gender lines "is understandable
because people are proud when
someone who they identify with
emerges for the first time," the for
mer president told a Charleston au
dience while campaigning for his
wife.
Mis comments and later outburst

came on a day when Obama contin
ued to challenge Miliary Clinton's
candor and trustworthiness, saying
the New York senator has indulged
in double-talk on bankruptcy laws,
trade and other issues.
The atmosphere grew more
charged after Clinton's campaign
aired a radio ad in South Carolina
suggesting Obama approved of Re
publican ideas. Obama responded
with his own radio spot that says,
"Miliary Clinton will say anything to
get elected."
Questions about the candidates'
honesty and consistency h;ive been
paramount since Monday's testy
presidential debate involving
Obama, Clinton, and former senator
John Edwards. Obama, campaigning
all week in South Carolina, is por
traying Sen. Clinton as an old-school
politician willing to shade the truth.
Politicians "don't always say what
they mean, or mean what they say,"
the Illinois senator told about 900
people at Winthrop University
Wednesday."That is what this debate
in this party is all about."
At three stops Wednesday.

Obama mocked Sen. Clinton for say
ing she voted for a 2001 bankruptcy
bill but was happy it did not become
law.
"Senator Clinton said, Well. 1
voted for it, but 1 hoped the bill
would die.'" he said, drawing hoots
from the university crowd.
In a similar vein. Obama said
Clinton originally praised the North
American Free Trade Agreement,
enacted during her husband's presi
dency, but now criticizes aspects of it.
"You can't always tell what Sena
tor Clinton's position on trade has
been,"he said.
Talk and its meaning seemed to dom
inate the day.
In the Clinton radio ad, which
uses a clip from his recent interview
with the Reno Gazette-Journal edi
torial board. Obama is heard saying:
"The Republicans were the party of
ideas for ;i pretty long chunk of time
there over the last 10.15 years."
An announcer says:"Hillary Clin
ton thinks this election is about re
placing disastrous Republican ideas
with new ones, like jump-starting the
economy."
Obama's campaign enlisted sup
porters in South Carolina to de
nounce the Clinton piece as selective
editing. Former Gov. Jim Hodges
said Clinton's campaign seemed de
termined to win "at all costs."
Obama's comment about Repub
licans came as he discussed elections
that represented shifts in political di
rection. The full quote is: "1 think it's
fair to say that the Republicans were
the party of ideas for a pretty long
chunk of time there over the last 10-
15 years in the sense that they were
challenging conventional wisdom."
lie preceded the remark by not
ing that John F. Kennedy also had
shifted the direction of the country.
"1 think we're in one of those times
right now, where people feel like
things as they are going aren't work
ing." he said. "That we're bogged
down in the same arguments that
we've been having, and they're not
useful. And the Republican ap
proach. I think, has played itself out ."
