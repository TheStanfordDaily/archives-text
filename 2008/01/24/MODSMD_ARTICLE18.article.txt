## CARD CRAFTS ROTATION 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
Trent Johnson knows his problem isn't necessarily a
problem. The Stanford men's basketball coach knows
many of his colleagues at other schools would give a lot
to have the Cardinal's depth off the bench. But that
doesn't make finding minutes for all his guys any easier.
"One of the things that's been good for me is that this team, as a
team, they don't worry about who's starting as opposed to who's on
the floor helping us win," Johnson said. "You know, if it was up to
me, I'd play them all the same, because that's how 1 feel about
them."
Seven players have started at least once for No. 20 Stanford (15-
3, 4-2 Pac-10) and all but two are averaging over 10 minutes per
game. After six games in conference play. Johnson has tightened his
rotation a bit to seven, but has enjoyed the flexibility in shaping his
lineups — often deftly shuffling players in and out to take advan
tage of matchups inside and out.
For example, Johnson swapped in senior guard Fred Washing
ton for junior forward Lawrence Hill against USC in order to em
ploy Washington's defense against Trojan freshman O.J. Mayo. The
plan worked, as Mayo suffered his worst performance of the sea
son, a 14-point effort on 5-of-l9 shooting from the field.
"We have the flexibility to go small and to play big," Johnson
said after the Cardinal beat USC 52-46."The key is at the defensive
end."
In Stanford's past four games, Johnson tweaked the starting
lineup again, substituting Hill back in for sophomore center Robin

Lopez. In each of those
games, the Cardinal faced
a team without a true
center and went small to
keep up defensively.
Much of the flexibility,
Johnson says, comes from
experience. The players
know how to play with
each other and are com
fortable adapting to dif
ferent lineup changes.
The coach, in turn, knows
what to expect from his
players.
"I think it helps us
with an experienced team
that if we get in foul trou
ble or if a team comes and
goes small, we can go
small," Johnson said.
"Now their smalls may be
quicker than ours, but we
still have that flexibility."

"We have the
flexibility to go
small and play big.
The key is at the
defensive end."
— TRENT JOHNSON,
head coach

"I think the kids have that confidence that we can play without
one or two guys, you know, during the course of the game," he
added. "And that's important."
Johnson says he bases his rotation on a combination of "feel and
plan." Performance in practice is weighed heavily, but once the
game starts, foul trouble and matchups can dictate substitutions by
necessity.
"I don't think there's a coach in America that can sit and say
'this is what I want to do'," Johnson said. "Then you have to be able
to trust. Trust that if a player has two fouls, he can play with three.
Or if you have somebody in a late clock situation, is he going to get
in the proper spot? Those types of things."
For the players, playing multiple positions brings tradeoffs. Hill,
who stands at six feet, eight inches, said that he adopts a different
mindset when shifting between playing on the perimeter and down
low.
"1 like the four [power forward] better — it's easier; it's not as
tiring," Hill said. "At the four, I can go from aggressive, strong to fi
nesse, from outside guy to inside guy. But at the three [small for
ward], run me off cuts and screens and I'm thinking catch and
shoot, sometimes not catch and attack."
Junior point guard Mitch Johnson said he changes the way he
runs the offense depending on who's getting minutes. When both
Brook and Robin Lopez are on the floor patrolling the paint, he
said, it gives the other players confidence that they have a larger
margin for error.

someone and they go around you,
you've got a little bit of help back
down there," Johnson said. "So it
definitely can affect your decision
making, and how you're thinking
out there."
On Saturday, Stanford faces a
California team that also likes to go
big. With the Bears trotting out a
front line of 6-11 center DeVon
Hardin and h-l() forward Ryan An
derson, expect to see both Lopez

twins log major minutes on the floor
together.
"Oh yeah, you'll see a lot of them
playing together," Johnson said
Tuesday. "We have some flexibility;
whether our bigs on a given day are
good enough to compete with theirs
remains to be seen."
Of course. Johnson also has Hill
and seniors Taj Finger and Peter
Prowitt ready and willing to log
more minutes off the bench.
"We're a team," Johnson said.
"We've got 10 guys we've gotta use,
and gotta play."
