## Women Seek Revenge Against Cal 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
For nearly a decade and a half, Stanford
women's basketball has dominated Cal.
The Cardinal has won 25 of its last 27
games against the cross-Bay rivals, routine
ly blowing out the Golden Bears while es
tablishing themselves as the premier bas
ketball program on the West Coast.
But over the past couple of seasons, Cal
has risen from the depths of the Pac-10 to
become one of the conference's premier
teams. In their second matchup last year,
Cal knocked off Stanford 72-57 at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal will enter Satur
day's rivalry game looking to avenge that
loss, one of the ugliest in recent memory.
The teams met on Feb. 4,2007. Stanford,
ranked No. 8 in the country, was 19-3 and
undefeated in Pac-10 play. The Cardinal
had beaten the Golden Bears 12 straight
times, including an 87-75 victory less than a
month earlier. Cal's last victory over Stan
ford was in 2001.
In 2005, in fact, the Cardinal beat Berke
ley by a combined 76 points in two games.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins, then a

freshman, was instrumental in both victo
ries: she scored 18 points in an 88-53 win on
Jan. 13 at Maples Pavilion, and added 24
points in a 91-50 victory on Feb. 11 in
Berkeley.
But those Golden Bear teams were
mediocre at best. After the 2005 season,
when the team went 11-18, Cal fired coach
Caren Horstmeyer and hired Richmond
coach Joanne Boyle, who had unprece
dented success with the Spiders, to replace
her.
Boyle quickly turned the Golden Bears
around: Cal went 18-12 in her first year,
making the NCAA Tournament for the
first time since 1993. Last season, the squ.td
climbed its way into the national rankings

iCL In last year's win over the Cardinal,
■ .J Cal held Stanford to just 26.6
percent shooting from the field, the
lowest total in program history

with a final record of 23-9.
The Feb. 4 victory was not entirely unex
pected: the previous month. Cal put up
their highest point total against Stanford in
12 years, a feat even more impressive be
cause it was done without forward/center
Deanei Hampton, Cal's leading scorer,
who was serving a suspension.
"They're big-time players, and this was
without their best player," Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer said at the time."They're
very, very good." It took career nights from
Wiggins (seven 3-pointers) and Krista
Rappahahn (six baskets from behind the
arc) for Stanford to hold off Cal.
All this set up the Golden Bears'
eventual win a month later.
And quite a victory it was: Cal
held Stanford to just 26.6 percent
shooting from the field, the lowest
total in program history. The Cardi
nal led 31-30 at half time, but Hamp
ton, back from her suspension, dom
inated in the second half, and fin
ished with 22 points and 14 re
bounds. Then-freshman point guard
Natasha Vital added 19 points, in
cluding 10 from the foul line, for the
Golden Bears, and dished out six as
sists.
Stanford was inept offensively:
Wiggins went 5-for-l4 from the field,
and then-senior forward Brooke
Smith, usually a reliable inside pres
ence, shot only 5-for-12, including 0-
4 from beyond the arc.They were the
only two players to score in double
digits for the Cardinal, but they both
fouled out. To add injury to insult,
starting guard J.J. Hones tore her
ACL just seconds into the game,

shelving her for the season.
With one starter out and the oth
ers suffering offensively. Van-
Derveer turned to her bench. She
used 11 players in the game (Boyle,
by contrast,only used seven) but she
found no relief: Cissy Pierce and
Clare Bodensteiner went 1-for-10
and l-for-9 from the field, respec
tively. As a team, the Cardinal shot
17-for-64, including a dismal ft-for-35
from three-point range.
Cal left the Farm with a decisive
victory that on its own. despite a
first-round NCAA Tournament exit,
was enough to call their 2006-2007
season a success.
Hie Golden Bears come to Stan
ford this Saturday ranked No. 8 in
the country, just one spot below the
No. 7 Cardinal. Cal is undefeated in
Pac-10 play, while Stanford has two
losses. With a win this weekend,
Berkeley will be in the Pac-10 dri
ver's seat for the rest of this season.
One of the most lopsided rivalries
in women's basketball has suddenly
become competitive, and the stakes
are as hii>h as ever.
