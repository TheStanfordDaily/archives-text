# RIAA demands fines from 15 students
## Recording industry serves 'pre-litigation' notices to Stanford users that demand hefty fines for illegal file sharing 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fifteen students have received pre-litigation notices
from the Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA) demanding that they pay settlement fees for il
legal file sharing through the Internet.
According to Lauren Schoenthaler, senior Universi
ty counsel, the University received the notices from the
RIAA on Jan. 9 and forwarded them to the respective
students. Each notice demanded that the students pay
the settlements by Jan. 28; otherwise the RIAA would
bring lawsuits against the 15 individuals.
While the pre-litigation notices stipulate that each
student pay upwards of several thousand dollars, the
amount each student could owe if brought to court may
be substantially greater.
"In speaking with affected students and their par
ents, the litigation process can be devastating financially
and emotionally," Schoenthaler wrote in an email to The
Daily.
TTie RIAA located the specific students through
their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, but it has not yet
attained the names and information of the students
from whom it is requesting settlement. Because the Uni
versity is able to identify individual students on campus
through their IP addresses, the RIAA relied on the Uni
versity to relay the notices to the individuals. The RIAA
will subpoena the University for the names and infor
mation of all those who fail to pay the settlement fee by
the Jan. 28 deadline.
Greg Goldgof "08. one of the students being threat
ened with a lawsuit by the RIAA, received an email for
warded via the University from the law offices of
Holme, Robert and Owen LLP on behalf of the RIAA.
It stated that he had used the file sharing client
Lime Wire to illegally download and share files, and that

he had until Jan. 28 to pay a $3,000 settlement, or else a
suit would he filed. Goldgof claimed that, prior to receiv
ing the notice, he "had not received even a single warn
ing from Stanford."
After receiving the pre-litigation notice email, Gold
gof spoke with members of the Office of the General
Counsel (OGC) and the Legal Counseling Office
(LCO) of the ASSU. Goldgof claimed that the general
response he received from the LCO and Schoenthaler
was that he should simply pay the settlement. Unable to
raise the $3,000 on his own. he contacted Prof. Lawrence
Lessig of the Stanford Law School, who referred him to
the Law School's Fair Use Project. He was advised to
consider fund-raising as a means of raising the settle
ment amount.
"I realized that probably the best bet would be to ask
my friends to help me out," Goldgof said.
In order to raise the needed funds to pay off the set
tlement, Goldgof created an event page on
facebook.com entitled "Save Greg from the RIAA!!!"
in hopes that his friends and sympathizers would donate
money to help him. So far, he has raised approximately
$1,200 through donations contributed via an eßay link
on the page. While he hopes to be able to raise the full
amount in time to meet the settlement deadline, he said
he was in no way pleased with any aspect of the situa
tion.
"There's really no other option left open to me," he
said. "I have to pay $3,000 — it's extortion."
Since February 2007, the RIAA has handled the pay
ment of anonymous settlement claims such as these
through an online settlement Web site — www.p2plaw
suits.com — through which the specific amount is paid
by credit card with no personal interaction with lawyers.
