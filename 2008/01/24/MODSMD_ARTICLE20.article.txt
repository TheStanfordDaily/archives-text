COLLEGE STATION, Texas â€” Curtis Jer
rells sat down, slumped his shoulders and ex
haled audibly.
"I'm tired," he said.
No one could blame him after he scored a
career-high 36 points in 53 minutes as Baylor
(No. 25 AP) escaped with a 116-1 lOfive-ovcr
time win over Texas A&M (No. 16
ESPN/USA Today, No. 18 AP) on Wednesday
night.
Jerrells scored 11 points in the final over
time and another 11 in the previous four to
lead his team. He also had eight assists, four
rebounds, two steals and a block.
"I don't even know how many overtimes it

able to step back and be so happy for our

waited so long for this," Baylor coach Scott
Drew said. "And obviously it's pretty sweet
for us to break through in the rankings and
then have a game like this."
Three free throws by Jerrells gave Baylor

steal and layup with about a minute left.
Aaron Bruce added a pair of free throws be

with less than 30 seconds remaining.
Jerrells added four more free throws and
Lace Darius Dunn chipped in a pair to ensure
the win.
The small but vocal group of Baylor fans
chanted "B-U!" incessantly as time ticked

jumped around wildly and hugged after the
