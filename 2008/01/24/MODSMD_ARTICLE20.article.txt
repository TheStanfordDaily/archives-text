COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Curtis Jer
rells sat down, slumped his shoulders and ex
haled audibly.
"I'm tired," he said.
No one could blame him after he scored a
career-high 36 points in 53 minutes as Baylor
(No. 25 AP) escaped with a 116-1 lOfive-ovcr
time win over Texas A&M (No. 16
ESPN/USA Today, No. 18 AP) on Wednesday
night.
Jerrells scored 11 points in the final over
time and another 11 in the previous four to
lead his team. He also had eight assists, four
rebounds, two steals and a block.
"I don't even know how many overtimes it
was," Jerrells said, looking confused.
Told it was five, he shook his head.
"That just shows the ability, the dedication
and the will of this team," he said. "If we put
our minds to it, no matter what happens we're
going to get it done."
Baylor (16-2.4-0 Big 12) won its fifth in a
row and first since entering the rankings for
the first time since 1969 on Monday. It broke
a 15-game home winning streak for Texas

A&M and is the Aggies' third straight loss.
"I think this has been great for our team
and even more enjoyable as a coach, being
able to step back and be so happy for our
community and fans and everybody that
waited so long for this," Baylor coach Scott
Drew said. "And obviously it's pretty sweet
for us to break through in the rankings and
then have a game like this."
Three free throws by Jerrells gave Baylor
a 106-103 lead in the fifth overtime. Do
minique Kirk got A&M (15-4. 1-3) within a
point with a layup on the next possession.
Jerrells pushed the lead back to 3 with his
steal and layup with about a minute left.
Aaron Bruce added a pair of free throws be
fore a layup by Bryan Davis made it 110-107
with less than 30 seconds remaining.
Jerrells added four more free throws and
Lace Darius Dunn chipped in a pair to ensure
the win.
The small but vocal group of Baylor fans
chanted "B-U!" incessantly as time ticked
down in the final overtime and players
jumped around wildly and hugged after the
clock ran out.
Davis, who led A&M with a ca
reer-high 30 points, made a layup
with 9 seconds left in the fourth over
time to knot it at 99 and send it to the
fifth OT.
"Five overtimes is asking a lot
when you're just not as deep as you
need to he,"Texas A&M coach Mark
Turgeon said.
Dunn scored five points in the
first half of quadruple overtime to
give Baylor a 97-94 lead with about
three minutes to go. Davis made two
free throws to get A&M within one
before a layup by Tweety Carter
made it 99-96 with about a minute
left.
Just as he had late in triple OT,
Donald Sloan made just one of two
free throws, this time making it 99-
97.

Jerrells scored six points in the
last 1:01 of triple overtime, including
the tying layup with 10 seconds left
to leave it at 90-all and force the
fourth overtime.
"Jerrells, he's something else,"
Turgeon said as he looked over the
stat sheet.
Kevin Rogers' layup with 1:31 re
maining in triple OT cut A&M's lead
to 87-84 and he fouled out less than
30 seconds later, the fourth Bear to
foul out. In all, five Baylor players
fouled out. Rogers finished with 19
points and 18 rebounds.
"You didn't want to see anyone
lose a game like this," Drew said. "1
don't think you could come up with
any more of a team effort."
Both teams managed just four
points apiece in the second overtime,
with Davis scoring all the Aggies'
points. A&M's Sloan had a chance
for the win at the buzzer, but his
layup was blocked by Rogers to take
it to triple overtime.
Kirk forced the second overtime
when his tip-in at the buzzer made it

76-all. He missed a 3 on the play and
a tip by Davis bounced off the rim
before Kirk swooped in for the re
bound and shot.
Turgeon was impressed with
Davis, who had 14 rebounds to go
with his 30 points.
"Bryan Davis .vas just a warrior
tonight," Turgeon said. "He was
great."
Sloan, who had 18 points, got the
inbound pass and streaked past
Rogers and the rest of the Baylor de
fenders for the one-handed dunk to
tie it a 64 and force overtime.
The teams combined to shoot
more than 100 free throws, with Bay
lor going 39-of-47 and A&M makine
36-of-59.
TTie game lasted so long that even
one of the referees got confused. In
the break before the start of the
fourth overtime, a referee ap
