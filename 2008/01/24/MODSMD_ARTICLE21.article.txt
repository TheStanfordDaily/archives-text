# CARD MEETS MATADORS
## Stanford looks to go 2-0 versus Cal State Northridge in rematch 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
A month into the season, the No. 6 Stanford
men's volleyball team is heading back to where it
started. The Cardinal will visit No. 7 Cal State
Northridge, its opponent in its first match of 2008
three weeks ago, and then UC-Santa Barbara,
who hosted the preseason Elephant Bar tourna
ment — Stanford was runner-up in the event.
At the Elephant Bar on Jan. 4, Stanford (5-3,
2-2 MPSF) opened its season against Northridge
(4-2,2-1), winning in four games behind 19 kills
by senior outside hitter Matt Ceran. Though
Stanford won the match, it took a 32-30 score in
game four to prevent a tie-breaking fifth game.
The Cardinal will take on the Matadors tonight
on the road, this time in an MPSF conference
match.
"It does help, but it helps both teams equal
ly," head coach John Kosty said of the familiari
ty from the first meeting. "1 think the level of
play will probably be higher in this game than it
was a couple of weeks ago.They were not at full
strength then. Cody Loe is back in the starting
lineup and that makes them a much stronger
team."
Loe, a six-foot-eight redshirt freshman,
missed the first meeting because of a conflicting
class, but returned to lead the team with 12 kills,
five blocks and hit .500 against Santa Barbara.
On the season, he is second on the team in kills
and blocks and boasts a team-high .453 hitting
percentage.
"Cody Loe is a big, strong middle blocker,"
Kosty said."He attacks well and is a good block
er. and they definitely missed him in the Santa
Barbara tournament."
Eric Vance led Northridge against Stanford
with 16 kills and is the team's top hitter with just
over four kills per game. He also leads the team
in aces (8) and digs (45) and is third in blocks
(13). Setter Travis Bluemling is averaging nearly

Matadors' top blocker with 26.
Northridge is a more experienced team than
the Cardinal, with only three true freshmen on
the roster.That experience could come into play
tonight.
"They are a very good serving and passing
team and they have had the same core of guys
for the last couple of years," Kosty said. "So we
know what to expect — they will dig a lot of
balls and block a lot of balls and pass well. We
need to make sure we keep up with them in
that."
Since that first weekend in Santa Barbara
when Stanford won two of its three matches, the
Cardinal has lost only twice, to No. 5 UCLA and
No. 2 Pepperdine, both in four games. The team
had won three in a row before falling to the
Waves at home last Saturday.
Ceran and sophomore right side hitter Evan
Romero lead the Cardinal offense, each averag

also has the team high in aces, while Ceran is the
top digger. Freshman Charley Henrikson and

blockers, with Romero right behind.

do that then 1 think we will have a
very good chance to win."
Stanford will play at Santa Bar

The Gauchos (1 -5,0-3) beat Pacific in
four games at the end of the Ele
