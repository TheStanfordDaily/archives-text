Only a small percentage of appli
cants to the Class of 2012 will clinch a
spot at Stanford in the fall, but even
those who are not admitted will hold a
spot in the record hooks. As of Tues
day's count, the 24,693 applicants from
around the world constitute the largest
application pool in University history.
According to Director of Admis
sion Shawn Abbott, the number of ap-

plicants represents a three percent in
crease from last year's 23,958 Stanford
hopefuls.
"It's impossible to pinpoint a specif
ic reason why we continue to experi
ence an increase in applications," Ab
bott said in an email to The Daily.
"We'd like to think it's because of our
significantly beefed-up outreach ef
forts. But it may also be because more
students file multiple applications than
ever before."
Outreach efforts have indeed in

creased, with University admission
representatives visiting over 100 met
ropolitan areas in 2007, along with col
leagues from Georgetown, the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania and Harvard.
While admission to Penn experi
enced a relatively small percentage in
crease like Stanford, I larvard saw a 19
percent rise in applications, receiving
27,278 as of Jan. 16, according to The
New York Times. Other schools with
double-digit increases included the
University of Chicago, Amherst,
Northwestern and Dartmouth.
According to admission officers
from across the country, a number of
factors have contributed to this in
crease in applications, including in
creasingly available online applica
tions and outreach efforts from uni
versities. Furthermore, the number
of graduating high school seniors will
peak in 2009 at 3.2 million.
Abbott said there are two reasons
the three percent increase in Stan
ford applications does not compare
to the surges at other schools — the
first of which is Stanford's inaugural
use of the Common Application. In
the past, a student would only have to
submit a basic information form to
be considered an applicant, but the
Common Application requires both
the information form and a supple
ment.

The second reason Abbott cited
was the new deadline for applica
tions, pushed back from mid-Decem
ber to Jan. 1.
"Moving the deadline affected
our application numbers this year, as
we no longer have 'phantom appli
cants' in our pool — those who filed
an application with Stanford but
were admitted early decision else
where back in December," Abbott
said.
Currently, no major change in ad
mission recruitment or policy is
being planned. In fact, Abbott said he
was pleased Stanford did not receive
a double-digit increase in applica
tions.
"Any increase in applications
only impedes access to Stanford and
increases the level of competition for
admission that already necessitates
that we deny more than 90 percent of
those who apply," Abbott said, refer
ring to those who will be denied ad
mission as "thousands and thousands
of applicants who are more than
qualified."
