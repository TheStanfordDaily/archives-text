## Stanford seeks 10-year NCAA certification Report to examine academic standards and gender equality in athletics 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sometimes the best need to get better.
That's the approach adopted by Stanford's Ath
letic Department as it undergoes the NCAA certi
fication process, a once-a-decade ordeal in which
the University conducts a self-study to review its
athletics program. Each NCAA member institution
must complete the procedure, in which colleges and
universities are reviewed on such standards as aca
demic integrity and race and gender equity.
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby, speaking at a
community forum in the Arrillaga Sports Center
Wednesday evening, said Stanford's certification
was "absolutely certain." The value of the study, he
said, comes from the still-significant room for im
provement.
"The real outcome of this is to make our pro
gram as good as it can be," Bowlsby said. "It's kind
of like having a consultant come to campus without
paying a consulting fee."
Stanford, which has won 13 straight NACDA Di
rector's Cups — the award given to the best overall
athletic program in the nation — makes consider
able efforts to keep sports in line with its stringent
academic standards. Unlike other universities with
top athletic programs, Stanford graduates 95 per
cent of student athletes, a number Bowlsby said
mirrored the rest of the undergraduate population.
Athlete GPA is "within .02" of peers, he said, and
majors are similarly distributed as well.
According to NCAA figures, incoming Stanford
student athletes had an average SAT score 200
