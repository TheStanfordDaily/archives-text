## Stanford seeks 10-year NCAA certification Report to examine academic standards and gender equality in athletics 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sometimes the best need to get better.
That's the approach adopted by Stanford's Ath
letic Department as it undergoes the NCAA certi
fication process, a once-a-decade ordeal in which
the University conducts a self-study to review its
athletics program. Each NCAA member institution
must complete the procedure, in which colleges and
universities are reviewed on such standards as aca
demic integrity and race and gender equity.
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby, speaking at a
community forum in the Arrillaga Sports Center
Wednesday evening, said Stanford's certification
was "absolutely certain." The value of the study, he
said, comes from the still-significant room for im
provement.
"The real outcome of this is to make our pro
gram as good as it can be," Bowlsby said. "It's kind
of like having a consultant come to campus without
paying a consulting fee."
Stanford, which has won 13 straight NACDA Di
rector's Cups — the award given to the best overall
athletic program in the nation — makes consider
able efforts to keep sports in line with its stringent
academic standards. Unlike other universities with
top athletic programs, Stanford graduates 95 per
cent of student athletes, a number Bowlsby said
mirrored the rest of the undergraduate population.
Athlete GPA is "within .02" of peers, he said, and
majors are similarly distributed as well.
According to NCAA figures, incoming Stanford
student athletes had an average SAT score 200

Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby spoke at the Arrillaga Sports Center Wednesday night about the
mandatory certification process and the necessity for such a study.
Study examines Athletics
Department's progress,
success
points higher than the next-highest institu
tion, Bowlsby said. He's also been told by
NCAA President Myles Brand that "Inter
collegiate athletics really needs the Stanford
model to succeed."
The self-study places the spotlight on the
Athletics Department, which operates on a
$75 million budget, employs nearly 600 peo
ple at peak seasons and utilizes 150 acres of
land. The process involves five subcommit
tees and nearly 60 individuals, half of which
are not involved with athletics at Stanford.
"It's a very broad and diverse group of
people," said Alan Acosta. director of Uni
versity communications and chair of the
self-study's Student Well-Being Subcom
mittee. "It's made for interesting discussion.
We're all on the same wavelength, but have
different backgrounds."
The University will submit the results of
its self-study to the NCAA on May 1, and in
November will host a delegation of faculty
and leadership from other universities for a
site visit.The NCAA will announce its deci
sion in spring 2009.
"This is not merely an exercise in formal
ity," said LaDoris Cordell, special counselor
in the President's office for campus rela
tions and chair of the certification steering
committee. "The self study is not a rubber
stamp. It's exhausting."
Stanford completed its last certification
process in 1999, and much of the feedback
related to gender equality. As a private insti
tution that received public funding, Stan
ford is privy to the Title IX legislation that
mandates equal opportunities in education
for both genders.
"It's a good question and a fair question,"
Cordell said of Stanford's compliance with
gender equity requirements. "The law does
n't mandate absolute equality. It doesn't
have to be dollar for dollar, but it does have
to comparable."
While some universities have controver
sially cut male sports teams to comply with
the legislation, the University instead added
additional female teams. Stanford now has
15 men's, 19 women's and one co-ed varsity
team.
Swimmer Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy
'09, a member of the student-athlete Well-
Being subcommittee, said her committee's
biggest challenge was health care — includ
ing the quality of care, mental health issues
and communication between doctors, train
ers and coaching staffs.
"The transparency aspect is really impor
tant," she said of the study.
Athletics and academics are not always
an easy mix, Acosta explained.
"Stanford's a university first and fore
most," he said. "We also have a top athletic
program. It's still a difficult balance."
The University has also experienced
some problems in the past when not all
coaches "embraced what Stanford is,"
Bowlsby said, adding that things have since
changed. The University has streamlined
athletics booster clubs, and is planning fur
ther facilities renovations to meet expected
suggestions from the study.
Engineering Prof. George Springer, a
former athlete who has also taught at Michi
gan and MIT, said he was pleasantly sur
prised at how well the University balanced
academics and athletics.
"[Athletics are] very important, as long
as the goals are well-understood and well
deserved — and they are here," said
Springer, who is chairing the Rules Compli
ance Subcommittee for the self-study. "Ath
letics does it very well."
