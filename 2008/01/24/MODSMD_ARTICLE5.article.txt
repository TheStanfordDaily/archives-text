## Low-flow showerheads replaced in Lag, Roble New equipment still environmentally friendly 
### NIKHIL JOSHI STAFF WRITER 
A steady stream of complaints from
Lagunita and Roble residents led Stu
dent Housing to install showerheads
with a higher flow rate in the two West
Campus dorms yesterday.
"In response to some students' con
cerns about the new showerheads, we
immediately began investigating the
water flow of showerheads across cam
pus and determined that the flow rate

was substantially lower in Lagunita and
Roble," said Chief Housing Officer
Rodger Whitney in an email to The
Daily.
The two West Campus dorms have a
lower water pressure than other dorms
on campus, which decreases the flow
rate of the showers. According to Sus
tainahility and Utilities Coordinator
Nik Kaestner. the showerheads installed
over winter break had only a 1.0 gallon
per minute flow rate in Lagunita and
Roble.The latest set of showerheads will
have a 1.3 gallon per minute flow rate,
which will match the flow rate in other
dorms.

Showers in Roble and Lagunita were recently refitted with showerheads that spew
1.3 gallons per minute, as opposed to 1.0 gallon per minute. The new showerheads
are still in line with the new low-flow devices on the rest of campus.
pressure problem in these two specif
ic houses and provide a consistent
shower experience across campus, we
immediately called the manufactur
er, Bricor, and requested hack-up
units to address this problem." Whit
ney said.
"We will be monitoring their re
sults carefully," he added, in refer
ence to the new showerheads that
were installed yesterday.
While Student Housing was will
ing to install a new set of shower-

heads in Lagunita and Roble, it re
mains opposed to a campus-wide re
turn to the old showerheads.
"In order to maintain the water
savings we expect as a result of the
retrofit — and still respond to stu
dent concerns about water pressure
issues unique to Roble and Lagunita
— we are not returning the original
showerheads to Lagunita and
Roble." Kaestner said. "The new
ones hopefully should address stu
dent concerns and still reduce water
consumption at the same time."
Student Housing is now con
vinced that the tide of campus opin
ion is turning, and that as residents
become more aware of the program
and its environmental benefits, thev

are increasingly coming to accept the
new showerheads.
"Casa Zapata | residents] emailed
us their unanimous support after the
Green Living Coordinator in that
dorm explained the background and
water savings potential of the retro
fit," Kaestner said.
Kaestner also pointed to the Win
ter 2(X)8 Student Housing Survey as
evidence of growing approval of the
showerheads.
"Our initial results from our cur
rent Housing survey reveal that stu
dents overall are very supportive of
sustainability initiatives like this one
and are willing to work with us as
long as the impacts are well-ex
plained. reasonable and we address

concerns as they arise," be said.
Housing staff is hopeful that once
the newest showerheads are installed
in Lagunita and Roble, the stream of
complaints will slow down to a trick
le and showerheads will no longer he
a hot topic of discussion on campus.
"1 am optimistic this switch should
address the most serious concerns
about the showerheads" Whitney
said, "and reaffirm that Student
Housing is more than happy to work
with students to continue to address
lingering issues on this initiative and
further promote sustainability in a
responsible way."
