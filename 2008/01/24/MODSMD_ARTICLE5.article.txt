A steady stream of complaints from
Lagunita and Roble residents led Stu
dent Housing to install showerheads
with a higher flow rate in the two West
Campus dorms yesterday.
"In response to some students' con

immediately began investigating the
water flow of showerheads across cam
pus and determined that the flow rate

was substantially lower in Lagunita and
Roble," said Chief Housing Officer
Rodger Whitney in an email to The
Daily.
The two West Campus dorms have a
lower water pressure than other dorms
on campus, which decreases the flow
rate of the showers. According to Sus
tainahility and Utilities Coordinator
Nik Kaestner. the showerheads installed
over winter break had only a 1.0 gallon
per minute flow rate in Lagunita and
Roble.The latest set of showerheads will
have a 1.3 gallon per minute flow rate,
which will match the flow rate in other
dorms.

1.3 gallons per minute, as opposed to 1.0 gallon per minute. The new showerheads
are still in line with the new low-flow devices on the rest of campus.
