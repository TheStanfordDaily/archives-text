## SNRP papers disappear 'Administrative error' halts NYT delivery 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
The recent disappearance ofcopie
of The New York Times from dinin
halls has raised concern among stu
dents that the Stanford News Reader
ship Program (SNRP). which distrih
utes a number of national newspaper
across campus, is suffering from lac:
of funding or has been terminated.
1 lowever, Aaron Qayumi '09, pre*
ident of the program, put these con
cerns to rest.
"The SNRP is fine," he said."We r
not stopping. It's just that in the las
two weeks or so, there was an adminis
trative error with distribution for 111
New York limes."

Qayumi promised that this error
will he corrected soon.
"It just came to my attention a few
days ago," he added. "So in the next
day or two The New York Times will
be circulating again. In the meantime,
hopefully readers will be satisfied with
the San Jose Mercury News, which has
been in circulation since the beginning
of winter quarter."
SNRP. which was formed in 2002.
currently distributes about S(X) issues
of The New York Times and 4(X) issues
of the San Jose Mercury News on
weekdays to nine news rack locations:
Gates. Building 260. Manzanita Din
ing Hall, Wilbur Dining Hall, Stern
Dining Hall. Florence Moore Dining
Hall. Lagunita Dining Hall, kicker
Dining I lall and The Axe & Palm.
Nonetheless, SNRP is having a
tough year. Comparing these circula
tion numbers to statistics printed in
previous Daily articles, distribution of

the papers has decreased. Financial
hardships are to blame: the group
failed to garner enough votes to re
ceive ASSU special fees funding last
spring.
Though the program received
67.57 percent of undergraduate votes
on the ASSU Special Fees ballot last
year, it did not achieve support from

15 percent of the total student popula
tion due to lack of graduate support.
"Last year, we lost the special fees
because not enough graduates voted
for the program ," Qayumi said."lf we
had applied as an undergrad group, we

would have gotten enough funding."
"We were able to survive and keep
operating this year because of emer
gency funding from the Provost's Of
fice on a one-time special basis,"
Qayumi added."Next year we will be
on the special fees ballot again, but
only for undergrade"
While many students do not know
about SN RP and its operations, those
that are aware of the program value
the papers that the group distributes.
"I would be angry if I stopped get
ting my New York Times," said Justin
Hefter ll."I think it's important for a
university that's famous for its aca
demics to have a student body that's
aware of current events, especially
during a time of elections."
Despite SNRP's wide operation,
the program costs less than $4 per stu
dent per year.
" I would pay the $4 if it was that or
nothing," said Will Lindemann '11.
"Considering how busy we all are in
the Stanford microcosm, it's impor
tant to get some exposure to national
and international news in our daily
life."
"I hope that people will tell their
friends about us and vote for us in the
special fees election this year," Qayu
mi added. "It's crucial to make sure
that this great program, which has
been around for six years, stays
alive."
