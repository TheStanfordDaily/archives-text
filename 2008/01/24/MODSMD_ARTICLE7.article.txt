## SNRP papers disappear 'Administrative error' halts NYT delivery 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
The recent disappearance ofcopie
of The New York Times from dinin
halls has raised concern among stu
dents that the Stanford News Reader
ship Program (SNRP). which distrih

hardships are to blame: the group
