## News Editor defeats stuffed animal challenger in 36-1 rout 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Shortly after her election victory was announced at
midnight last night, newly crowned Daily Editor in Chief
Julie Klein '09 emerged from the back office, nervously
brushing b;ick her disheveled hair and fastening her shirt
buttons. Jules R. Penguin, her opponent, trailed behind
her. covered in pink lipstick and carrying a broken con
dom.
Outgoing Editor in Chief Nick Parker '08 sighed and
said,"Condoms are overrated."
Klein, an attractive brunette and current managing
editor of news, won last night's election for The Daily's
top role handily. She defeated her stuffed animal oppo
nent. Jules R. Penguin, by a count of 36 to I.
But this resounding victory was tainted by allegations
of moral misconduct, according to an investigative report
by multimedia editor and former editor in chief James P.
Hohmann '09.
Hohmann walked into the office shortly after the fes
tivities, wearing a black trenchcoat and smoking a cigar.
"I took some time off from writing my 300-page histo
ry honors thesis — that is of course an expansion of my
75-page PWR paper — to conduct tests on office furni
ture. I have concluded that Julie has been granting sexu
al favors, not only to Jules, but to multiple unnamed
staffers in the office." I lohmann said, tying his boat shoes.
"Intelligence believes that this was done in order to gar
ner votes from her opposition."
Klein denied the allegations shortly afterward.
"I did not have sexual relations with that penguin "
Klein said defiantly.
But a number of staffers began to come out of the
woodwork, claiming that Klein offered "sessions in the
back office," according to one male freshman reporter
who declined to give his name in fear of losing his current
position at The Daily.
Duran Alvarez, the professional layout artist, corrob
orated Hohmann's claims.
"I showed up at the office one night and found these
cats (Klein and Parker] cleaning up a mess of condom
wrappers," Alvarez said."l guess they don't call it the 'lay
out office 1 for nothing."
"That was my box of condoms!" exclaimed Andrea
Fuller '09, upon hearing this information."They were ad
dressed to me! Parker wouldn't even let me keep the vi
brating ring!"
"But Julie made it up to me by naming me managing
editor of news." added the disgruntled news desk editor.
"1 told her I'd blackmail her if she didn't."
Fuller wasn't the only one who benefited from crony
ism in Klein's new cabinet. Jack Salisbury'lo maintained
his position as managing editor of sports.
"Julie let me keep my job in exchange for letting me
join in on the fun." Salisbury said, declining to elaborate

on this statement.
Others expressed shock and awe regarding Klein's ac
tivities.
"It's disgusting." said opinions editor In I lo Lee '09. "I
can't imagine someone getting freaky here. I sit on these
chairs every day." Lee added that she will resign from her
current position as opinions editor due to her "extreme
emotional disturbance."
The scandal may be darker than originally expected.
Betsy Congdon '08, the staff development editor, of
fered Klein some champagne after her victory speech,
hut the new editor declined.
"At first, 1 wondered why Julie refused the booze, but
later I found a pregnancy test in the trash," Congdon said.
"There's no official word yet. but I'm suspecting human
penguin babies in nine months."
Natalie Jabbar '0 l ). the Intermission editor, was not
surprised by the news.
"I always knew she was feistier than she looked."
