# Biologist fears warming impacts
## Field discusses Gore report predicts dire consequences 
### TRI HUNG NGUYEN 
Over 1 (X) people braved the weather last night
to listen to Biology Prof. Chris Field, founding di
rector of the Carnegie Institution's Department
of Global Ecology, who addressed a number of
current environmental concerns. Stanford Scien
tific Magazine hosted the lecture entitled "IPCC,
Kyoto and the next steps to meet the challenge of
Climatic Change."
During the two hour talk. Field offered insight
on the recent report by The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that helped the
panel to win the 2007 Nobel Prize for Peace along
with A 1 Gore, and he looked toward the future of
international efforts to curb global warming.
The report is not an independent study of any
scientific institute, but the product of a lengthy
and tedious process involving many scientists and
government representatives from all over the
world, including Field.
"(The report] consists of multiple layers of
monitored review," Field said. "After the first
draft, we sent it to hundreds of leading scientists
in the field. We then reviewed their comments,
which added up to 175 pages long, before careful
ly choosing those that can be substantially sup
ported with scientific evidence."
According to Field, the report has received in
ternational acclaim because it managed to gather

the consensus agreement of all the
participating countries regarding de
tails on policy making.
"We sit down with the representa
tives from all the governments," Field
said, "and go over our proposal on
policy making. No one left the room
until we finally reached agreement on
every single details that we put into
the report."
The report also looks into climate
changes in many specific regions.
Through many maps and charts. Field
showed the audience the dramatic
rise in temperature in California dur
ing the past fifty years.
The report points to carbon diox
ide emission as the main culprit for

the current climatic change by show
ing a strong correlation between the
change in carbon emission and the
rise in temperature.
Field ultimately went over the
possible solutions to global warming.
According to him, each alternate en
ergy source has its own limitation.
Solar and wind energy are unstable
sources of energy that are incompati
ble with the current models of en
gines, while nuclear energy poses the
risk of nuclear weapon proliferation
and accidents.
"What the IPCC would like to
suggest can be summarized in a house
with four walls," Field said, "and they
say conservation, efficiency, new
technology and capture and storage.
In all, it is adaptation that we have to
make."
