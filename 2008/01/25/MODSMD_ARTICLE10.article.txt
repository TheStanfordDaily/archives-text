## CSPI claims polluters cloud research Center for Science in the Public Interest attacks University's sponsors 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
In a report released Monday, the Center for Sci
ence in the Public Interest (CSPI) characterized
Stanford as one among several American universities
that "are accepting extensive industry controls over
the research process — controls that violate hal
lowed traditions of academic independence industry
controls."
Despite the attack on Stanford's many research
initiatives involving the environment, the University
denied the characterization, stating that Stanford re
search is not directed according to company partner
ships.
In particular,CSPl targeted the 10-year, $225 mil
lion Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP).
Funded by ExxonMobil, Toyota, General Electric
and oil services giant Schlumberger, the partnership
guarantees the companies involved five-year rights to
a royalty free license of any University-patented in
vention.
GCEP Director Franklin M. Orr Jr. said that al
though qualitative information in the CSPI report
was correct, it was driven by a predisposition against
corporate-funded research in academia.
"There are some folks who don't like corporate
sponsorship and these are some of them," Orr said.
"It is certainly accurate that we are funded by the four
companies named. And it is true that companies get a
royalty in the first five years; after that, we can license
it to anyone."
Along with the Universities of California-Berke
ley and Davis, Cal Tech. Georgia Tech. Princeton.
Carnegie Mellon and Rice, Stanford was implicated

in granting inappropriate influence to polluting com
panies. The CSPI cited the universities as "allowing
company representatives on governing hoards," "giv
ing industry sponsors first rights to intellectual prop
erty" "allowing industry sponsors a role in deciding
what research projects are funded," "permitting in
dustry review of research before it is published" and
"allowing companies to delay publication of research
results."

"The opportunity to pursue
new research frontiers has
been hard to get elsewhere."

Global Climate and Energy Project
Director

Orr contended the accusation, particularly oppos
ing the insinuation that companies unduly influence
the direction of research.
"The idea that somehow sponsors can prevent
publications or delay publications is not true," he said.
"Stanford absolutely does not allow for such interfer
ence."
He added that companies neither see papers in
advance nor review them before publication and that

the selection process for research funding is
also independent of company influence.
"We respond to proposals from individ
ual faculty members or groups of faculty
members," Orr said. "They write the
proposal, they do the work and

nobody tells them what to do.
Thev make their own deci-

sions. Likewise, we look
~ — I

at a lot of proposals and
we choose the best
option if it has the
potential to reduce

green house gas
emissions."

Rather than
being overbearing
influences, the
companies in
volved have largely
been the reason why

research initiatives
like GCEP succeed,
according to Orr. In the
early days of GCEP. there
was little internal monetary

aid.
"There wasn't much support,
especially when we started." Orr said.
"And there wasn't much money avail
able to do the 112 undamental pre-commer
cial science that might lead to new con
version energies."
