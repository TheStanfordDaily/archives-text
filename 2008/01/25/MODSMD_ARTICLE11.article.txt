## Senate debates Rumsfeld title once again Stanford Libraries reports on subscriptions loss, book digitization 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate had its first meeting of winter
quarter yesterday, with issues from fall quarter still
taking center-stage.
Hie controversy surrounding Donald Rumsfeld's
appointment as a distinguished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution continued, with a proposal on
yesterday's agenda to remove the term "distin
guished" from all non-academic positions.
Supporters of the motion said that the "distin
guished" title was Stanford's closest thing to an hon
orary degree, and the decision to award it should not
rest with a small group of people.
Echoing the sentiments of others. Biology Pro
fessor Robert Simoni said he didn't have enough in
formation to vote on the proposal.
"1 don't know where else distinguished' is used
in the University." he said.
President John Hennessey also expressed con
cern about having to remove the word "distin
guished" from the titles of alumni-sponsored posi
tions.
"I think we need to be careful about how much
bureaucracy we create," he said.
Faculty voted down the proposal, with only four
votes in support of the change.
A related proposal, giving the Committee on the
Professoriate the authority to examine appoint
ments at Stanford-affiliated institutes such as the
Hoover Institution and Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies, will be examined at the next
meeting of the Faculty Senate.
Earlier in the meeting. University Librarian
Michael Keller addressed the future of Stanford Li
braries. Keller walked the faculty through Google
books — an initiative to have an online database ac
cumulated from University collections and other
sources — and said that Stanford has already sent a
million books to the company to be digitized.
Keller added that the University aims to go
above and beyond services like Google books with
future projects.
"Anyone who can get the Internet can search
Google," he said. "But there's only one Stanford."
Citing inconvenient Coursework crashes. History
Professor Philippe Buc expressed concern about the
movement toward an increasingly digital library. He
said he hoped that any such programs would be
carefully examined before implementation.
"They have to be better tested," he said, "and not
on me. not on my teaching time, not on my students."
In response, Doug Brutlag pointed out that digi
tal libraries are in many ways less vulnerable than
physical libraries.
"One time we had a whole river go through our
librarv." he said, citing a 1998 flood that damaged
books' on Green Library's lower level.
Brutlag also presented the 2006-07 annual report
for the Committee on Libraries.
He explained how the Stanford Li
braries were forced to re-examine
their periodical subscriptions after
rising costs made some of the more
expensive journals cost-prohibi
tive. Brutlag said that the Universi
ty asked faculty to look at its
changes and determine if any dis
continued journals should be re
newed.
The imminent razing of Meyer
Library was also further reported,
with Brutlag noting that the Uni
versity would lose space for
600,000 to 700,000 books as well as
student study space and a few dis

sertation rooms. Brutlag proposed
moving items in the East Asian col
lection off-campus or to Green Li
brary.
During a brief announcements
period at the start of the meeting,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 addressed recent statistics
showing Stanford Admissions had
only a three percent increase in
number of applications, compared
to a 19 percent surge at I larvard.
"We're counting applications
differently." he said, noting that the
University is only tallying complet
ed application packets this year —
a change that, according to
Etchemendy, accounts for the sig
nificant difference between Stan
ford and other schools.
