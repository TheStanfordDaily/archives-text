## Women's heart health "goes red" with new clinic 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
The new Women's Heart I lealth Clinic,
which opened this year at the Stanford
Cardiovascular Institute, wants the com
munity to know that Feb. 1 is "Go Red"
day â€” a day devoted to fighting heart dis

While most women fear contracting

who often come to lYemmel after failing to
be diagnosed properly by their primary
physicians.
"In general the women I end up seeing
are at the end of their diagnostic workup."

Tremmel said. "Their doctors are frustrat
