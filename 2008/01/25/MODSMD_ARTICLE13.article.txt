## Women's heart health "goes red" with new clinic 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
The new Women's Heart I lealth Clinic,
which opened this year at the Stanford
Cardiovascular Institute, wants the com
munity to know that Feb. 1 is "Go Red"
day — a day devoted to fighting heart dis
ease. the number one killer of women in
the country.
While most women fear contracting
breast cancer far more than they worry
about their heart health, cardiovascular
disease in fact kills almost twice as many
women per year as do all types of cancer
combined, according to the American
Heart Association.
Even more disturbing, while the num
ber of men who die from heart disease
yearly has decreased rapidly since 1984.
the death rate among women with heart

disease has barely fluctuated.
Jennifer Tremmel. cardiologist and di
rector of the new Women's Heart Health
Clinic, has an explanation for this trend.
"Women have always been dispropor
tionately understudied in cardiovascular
disease," she said, pointing out that nearly
all of the subjects historically used in car
diovascular research since 1940 have been
male.
Only recently are doctors realizing that
women do not present all of the same
symptoms for heart disease as males do
and that there are certain sex-specific dif
ferences and risk factors in women that
need to be taken into account.
"In the last decade there's been a
growth of interest and enough knowledge
about sex difference that we can offer a
clinic like this one,"TVemmel said. "We're
trving to treat a woman like a woman in-

"We have to understand that there is a different
face to heart disease."

Nurse Practitioner

stead of treating her with information that
comes from men."
The growing Women's Heart Health
Clinic serves approximately KK) patients,
who often come to lYemmel after failing to
be diagnosed properly by their primary
physicians.
"In general the women I end up seeing
are at the end of their diagnostic workup."

Tremmel said. "Their doctors are frustrat
ed: they don't know what's wrong. I think
we have a good multidisciplinarv way to
help them."
TYemmel has collected a great deal of
female-specific cardiovascular research
and has seen enough female patients pre
senting the same "atypical" cardio
vascular disease symptoms to recog
nize and diagnose illnesses in her pa
tients. She often diagnoses diseases
that general physicians overlook.
For example, earlier in the year, a
healthy 48-year-old woman came to
the clinic after months of experienc
ing redness and shortness of breath
while jogging. Tremmel was able to

use specialized tests to diagnose the
patient with endothelial heart dys
function, a form of heart disease that
often goes undetected and U'ldiag
nosed in women, according to her.
"1 could have easily been dis
missed [by another doctor), but (at
the Women's Heart Health Clinic)
they're specifically interested in
women," the patient said to Business
Wire magazine.
Tremmel sees the benefits of sex
specific medical treatment not only
in the cardiovascular field, but also in
other medical sectors. She is working
to popularize the trend.

"We have established an Internal
Referral Network so that women
who require specialized care beyond
my expertise — such as electrophysi
ology or diabetes treatment — can
easily be referred to another physi
cian in our group who is also commit
ted to treating them in an evidence
based, sex-specific manner," she said.
Nurse practitioner Mary Nejedly
was inspired to work for the
Women's Heart Health Clinic when a
friend's mother died of a heart attack
at the age of 61.The woman, who had
seen a doctor about her symptoms,
had been told she was suffering only

from indigestion.
If she had been a 61-year-old man,
Nejedly believes, she may have been
recommended for further evaluation
and perhaps her death could have
been prevented.
"When you think about heart dis
ease, you think about a middle-aged
man walking out of an office meeting
after a heavy meal, clutching his
chest," she said. "We have to under
stand that there is a different face to
heart disease."
