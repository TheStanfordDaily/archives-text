## Editorial Board California's 2008 propositions 
### 
This year's marathon campaigns and
media frenzy have rekindled a love
for all things political in many Ameri
can students. Candidates strategize and spar
with controversy-inducing cleavage shots
and below-the-belt punches while media
pundits spin out of control. And people are
tuning in. This week's presidential debate
broke records for a political debate aired on
cable station. The primaries have made The
New York Tinies's list of the ten most popu
lar stories every day since before the lowa
caucus. The resurgence of political energy
this primary season is a wonderful phenom
enon. As we cast our collective conscious
ness towards November and beyond, how
ever, it is important to remember that polit
ical participation should encompass more
than bright lights and scandalous stories
about the presidential elections.
One effect of this year's increased politi
cal activity is an increase in California voter
registration. Students have been drawn into
California's electoral process by the big
names contending for presidential nomina
tions; however, they should also extend their
new-found political interest to the Califor
nia propositions.
The editorial board would like to high
light the content of some of the proposed
propositions currently being put to the vot
ers. This year's ballot will feature seven
propositions. Four propositions. Props 94-
97, challenge the amendment to an existing
gaming compact between the state and
Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians
(94), Morongo Band of Mission Indians
(95), Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation
(%),and the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuil
la Indians (97). The amendment would ex
empt certain projects from the California
Environmental Quality Act and requires a
portion of the tribe's revenue to be given to

the State Treasury's General Fund. The
proposition stops the amendment from
going into effect unless a majority of voters
approve it.
Hie remaining three propositions are
concerned with transportation funding,
community colleges funding and legislator
term limits. Proposition 91 proposes changes
to the management of transportation funds,
earmarking moneys for the Transportation
Investment Fund and prohibiting spending
on unrelated matters, starting July of this
year. According to the office of California's
Secretary of State, this proposition would in
crease the "stability of funding to transporta
tion in 2(X)7-2(X)8 and ... [reduce] the state's
flexibility to use specified transportation
funds for other activities."
Proposition 92 would build a system of
independent public community college dis
tricts and instate a board of governors for
the colleges. TTiis proposition is part of the
$135 million dollar increase in spending on
education from the primary level to the As
sociates Degree in the coming fiscal year.
Lastly, Proposition 93 limits the number
of years a person may serve in the state leg
islature from 14 years to 12. This figure rep
resents the total number of years that a per
son may serve in any combination of Assem
bly and Senate positions and may in fact ex
tend the amount of time many politicians
would spend in the legislature.
For the many newly registered students
on campus, the editorial board hopes stu
dents will carry the excitement from the
presidential primaries to the ballot initia
tives. If politics is about true participation
and not merely following the reality game
show-style gossip-mongering, then we
should step up to the plate and inform our
selves on the nitty gritty of politics at the
state, as well as the national, level.
