# Nat-ural Philosophy
## Mr. Stanford University Traffic Officer 
### 
You stand solid, like a medieval statue,
your blue hat and park ranger outfit
like the cloak of an aged philosopher
in the alcove of a European Gothic church.
Holding your clipboard aloft like a mighty
sword, your regality is astonishing.
Bicycles zoom around you. the reminder
of a chaotic world that still turns, but you,
mighty one, are not and cannot be phased.
You are a Stanford University Traffic Offi
cer, a 5.U.T.0.. as it's known in the business.
And no punk kid is going to tarnish that title.
You may not be a real police officer. You
may not actually have any power. But when
you're standing near that neatly groomed
circle, you arc God. Scores of visiting high
school students and Asian tourists look up
to you as a symbol of order within anarchy,
a constant reminder of man's mastery over
other beasts.
Oh yes,you have your enemies.There are
those who deny you your power. But they
can't run from the law.They can't bike from
the law, either. Well, even if they bike away
this time, they will eventually come within
the fold of our legal system, to be hit hard
with the fist of justice.
Robert Frost once spoke of the road less
traveled. To you. no such road exists. There
is one reliable, stable path through a world
colored in black and white. The only gray
you see is the gray of the pavement . And the
only uncertainty you know is the wavering
gaze of the intimidated prey as he looks into
your commanding eyes.
Lynx and rabbit, bear and fish, anteater
and ant, Stanford University Traffic Officer
and non-roundabout-obeying student.
ITiese are the ruthless predators of the wild
and their helpless victims. The rich dialectic
of these opposing forces drives forth a natu
ral circle, known affectionately as the circle
of life. And like this circle of life, the round
about's simple geometric perfection is a re
minder that there is method to this primor
dial madness.
If the prey unwisely decides to disobey
its master,you snap back with all the fury of
a raging river. You roar, as if a lion, the raw

volume of your utterance making obvious
the unbridled force of your convictions.
"Hey you! Guy in the red!" is far more than
a yell. It is a reminder of the subservience of
this wayfaring lawbreaker. And as you wave
your mighty clipboard, a smug smirk on
your steadfast face, you know who has won
here.
In waving your clipboard as you do, you
provide the sole impetus for the winds of
change. The legends speak of a butterfly in
China, flapping its wings and causing a
world war. A traffic officer near a six-foot
in-diameter concrete circle on a university
campus wafts his clipboard, and the world
listens with bated breath, in fear of the dire
consequences.
Mr. Stanford University Traffic Officer,
today I take my hat off to you. Your literal
one-track mind has enriched this campus
and enhanced our lives. Your inability to tol
erate dissent has reminded us of the neces
sity of subjugation. And the seriousness
with which you view your occupation is a re
freshing reminder that some jobs are still
necessary.
As you ascend the mound tomorrow
morning, once more shouting the word of
the Law from On High, remember that I
stand behind you in ideological solidarity.
Of course. I stand behind you only in such a
way as to not block the traffic of the round
about. Or to disturb the potted plants in its
center.
