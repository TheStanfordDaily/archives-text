# Burning Down the House
## Buy the ticket, take the ride 
### 
Ihave eight ties. I just counted them. Eight's
a lot for a twenty-one year old with a
patchily trimmed beard and meager job
prospects. There they are, though, hanging in
the closet, a pink dotted one, a blue dotted
one,an orange striped one. I learned how to tie
them and even how to match them with my
shirt and jacket.
I bought most of my ties toward the end of
the summer of 2(X)6. right before I started at
Stanford in Washington. I needed them for
my internship at the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee — we were required
to wear ties when the Senate was in session,
just in case a senator happened by the office.
I leaven forfend Dianne Feinstein glimpse my
open collar.
Over the course of the quarter, though, my
friends and 1 couldn't help but question the
whole purpose of the program. The entire
Stanford in Washington program is built
around the internship, and while many of us
— myself certainly included — found our in
ternships to be interesting and valuable pro
fessional training, they were somewhat lack
ing as an academic and intellectual experi
ence.
Why is an academic institution having us
do decidedly non-academic work? The rea
sons we decided to apply to Stanford's Wash
ington program were clear enough: it's a good
line on the resume and a chance to test out ca
reer possibilities. But so are many summer in
ternships that Stanford doesn't set up for you.
Stanford in Washington is fun. When
you're there, you're spoiled, and this is the
point. It's finishing school for kids who just
might be influential one day. Students get for
mal tours of art galleries, told where to look
for Supreme Court justices at the symphony
at the Kennedy Center, taught how to wear a
tie or a formal dress and literally lectured on
how to appreciate the opera.
When we went to New York for the week
end, we took the Acela speed-train, which I
will probably never take again in my life. We
stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan.
When we got hungry for lunch, we casually
and arbitrarily picked out a fancy French
restaurant in Midtown. When we needed to
get from Midtown to Harlem in a hurry, we
took a limo. I'm not kidding. Our weeks were

punctuated by guest lectures from only the
most prominent, important figures. Justice
Stephen Breyer talked to me about Bush v.
Gore, reiterating that although he disagreed
with the decision, he fully trusted in the good
faith of each justice's decision-making
process. The premise of everything we
learned was, "Things basically work. Don't
worry about it, just get in on it." We were the
Establishment, in training.
This past October, Stanford in Washington
finished construction on its building, conve
niently falling simultaneously on its twentieth
anniversary. The program's backers gener
ously Hew out program alums for the cere
monies. One student from every table at the
grand banquet went home with a to-scale,
white chocolate Capitol building the size of
my torso.The weekend's events included pan
els on important topics and testimonials from
students who had gone through the program
and who promised to give back to Stanford
and Stanford in Washington however they
could.
It's the perfect plan. Students who are
most likely to affect public policy are those
most interested in it.and thus they are likeli
est to self-select themselves into the program.
They are diligently groomed to be members
of the DC policymaking elite, and it's made
certain that they won't forget Stanford once
they get there.
There's nothing wrong with this, per se. I
certainly don't mean to sound ungrateful for
the spoiling I received. I really enjoyed my
quarter in DC, and if I get a job after graduat
ing, it will be thanks to that internship.
To some degree, even, what's obviously
true for Stanford in Washington is more sub
tly true for Stanford as a whole.The universi
ty cultivates our success so that we can repay
it when we are, indeed, successful. Admissions
officers don't just open the doors of opportu

nity. they gatekeep for the elite.
But this kind of quid pro quo logic encour
ages students to accept wisdom of the estab
lishment. If reassured that, so long as we play
by the rules of the game, there's a place for us,
we're more likely to accept the rules. Trouble
is, sometimes things don't work and the con
ventional wisdom is wrong. The best and
brightest got us into Vietnam and Iraq and
then insisted that we stay there. The rules can
sometimes be right, and they can sometimes
be rotten to their core. When they do break
down, what students thought was preparation
for participatory idealism turns out to be boot
camp for cynicism.
Like Hunter Thompson used to say before
he shot himself,"Buy the ticket,take the ride."
And make sure your tie matches your shirt.

Gabe's actually wearing the fleece in his Daily
picture, which Stanford in Washington gave hint.
It's got a Capitol building and everything. Make
fun of him atgwinant@stanford.edu.
