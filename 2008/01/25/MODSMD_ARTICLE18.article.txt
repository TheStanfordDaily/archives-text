Roe v. Wade crosses
have dual meaning
To the Editor,
We are writing in response to your front
page photo ("Remembering Roe v. Wade") in
the Jan. 23 issue depicting the crosses in
White Memorial Plaza that represent the
number of legal abortions since Roe v. Wade.
It is worth noting that those crosses could also
represent the 67,(XX) women who die world
wide each year as a result of complications
from unsafe abortion.The overwhelming ma
jority of these unsafe abortions occur in coun
tries where abortion remains illegal, a situa
tion that existed in the U.S. before Roe v.
Wade made women's lives safer.
