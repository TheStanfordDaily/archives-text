Stanford men set to open
dual season in Tulsa, Okla.

The Stanford men's tennis team heads to
TUlsa, Okla. this weekend for the opening of
its dual season. The Cardinal will prepare to
take on No. 23 Tulsa and No. 2 Georgia, like
ly one of the toughest opening schedules in
the nation.Though the squad will he facing a
very difficult challenge, the team is excited
and prepared for the opportunity.
"This will be a good test for our guys," said
head coach John Whitlinger. "For our first
matches of the year we are into the fire al
ready."
The Cardinal will feature a fully healthy
lineup for one of the first times this season.
Junior Matt Bruch. an integral part of the
team's success over the past few years, will he
ready to play after an injury held him out last
week. Stanford will face the Golden Hurri
cane today, followed by the Bulldogs tomor
row.
"Ililsa is a very good team and very un
derrated," Whitlinger said. "It will be a diffi
cult match and they will have a good crowd
indoors."
Tulsa's Michael D.Case indoor tennis cen
ter is a very tough place to play. When the

crowd fills in and the noise gets going, it
makes it very difficult for the opposing team.
"We can't get caught up with the noise
and things like that." Whitlinger added.
"We're just going to focus on what we're
doing and go out and play our game. And
we'll see what happens."
Tulsa, already 3-0 on the season, features
senior Ricardo Soriano, ranked No. 44 in the
nation, as well as the No. 5 doubles team in
the nation, Andy Connelly and Ross Cun

ningham. Soriano and Arnau Brugues are
ranked No. 15 in doubles.
As for Georgia, the Cardinal is well aware
of the formidable Bulldog program. This
year.Georgia has three nationally-ranked in
dividuals and one ranked doubles team: No.
4 Travis Helgeson, No. 17 Nate Schnugg, No.
67 Jamie Hunt and the No. 46 duo of Hunt
and Daniel lobar in doubles.This will also be
Georgia's first dual match of the season.
"They are the defending NCAA champi

ons— that's about all you need to say,"
Whitlinger said.
Even though the Cardinal might not be fa
vored this weekend, the team is not going
down without a fight.
"Just because a team looks better than
you on paper doesn't mean you can't win the
match." said junior Blake Muller."We are all
competing next to each other and affecting
the guys next to us. Anything can happen."
On paper. Stanford doesn't evetj seem to

be an underdog. The Cardinal has four play
ers ranked in the top-100 in singles: No. 2
Alex Clayton, No. 41 Ted Kelly. No. 75
Richard Wire, and the No. % Bruch.That is
more than both Tulsa and Georgia.
Nonetheless, this weekend will be crucial for
the Cardinal as they look to make a big state
ment for the rest of the season.
"It's good to go out and play the best,"

Richard Wire and the Cardinal will look to test themselves early this year as they square off against No. 23 Tulsa and No. 2 Georgia this weekend in Stanford's first dual of the season.
Whitlinger said. "You play them
early in the season so you know what
you have to work on and improve.
It's going to be a challenge, but it will
be a great college tennis match."
Last year, the Cardinal finished
with an underachieving 8-lb overall
dual record. Both players and coaches

know that last year was tough but this
year should be a rebound. Stanford is
currently ranked No. 42 in the first
poll of the season and believes that
they should be ranked even higher.
Results this weekend will be a great
benchmark of where they stand.
"We are a pretty good team."
Whitlinger said. " ITiis weekend we
will have something to say about our
ranking."
