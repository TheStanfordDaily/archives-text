# BEAR DOWN
## No. 20 Cardinal looks to keep rolling in Berkeley

Oil and vinegar. Drinking and
driving. Cats and dogs.
Stanford and Cal.
Some things just don't mix. Luck
ily for Stanford (15-3, 4-2 Pac-10)
fans though, the Cardinal may have
the upper hand in its 4 p.m. Saturday
tilt with the hosting Bears (11 -6.2-4).
It's Trent Johnson 101: when
Stanford plays a lesser opponent,
make sure to talk them up as much
as possible, lest you come across as
haughty. The only problem is when
those pesky things called facts get in
the way.
"When you look at the stats in
conference games, you look at ours,
you look at theirs," coach Johnson
said. "How is this team 2-4?"
I'm not a math major, but Stan
ford is holding conference oppo
nents to 57 points per game, while
Cal is allowing 78 per game. 1 think
that might start to explain it. Teams
make 38 percent of their shots
against the Cardinal and 47 percent
against the Bears.

NOTES: The No. 20 Cardinal looks to
keep rolling against the rival Bears
Saturday as it crosses the Bay to take
on Cal. Stanford has thrived of late in
part because the team has used its
size to its advantage in keeping the
score low. The Cardinal leads the Fbc
-10 in rebounding with 39.4 rpg and
blocked shots with 80. Sophomore
Robin Lopez is the conference's indi
vidual leader in blocks with 37 on the
year.

Anthony Goods and the Cardinal take on a
familiar Bears team this weekend, which
runs its offense with a similar inside mentality
but has yet to match Stanford's dominant D.
Taj Finger and sophomore centers
Brook and Robin Lopez have been
dominant on the inside, with seven. 15
and 37 blocks this season, respective
ly. Arizona State had stormed to ten
straight wins and a 30-point first half
last Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
Then the Stanford posts built a fence
around the paint and locked the gate:
the Devils managed just 22 second
half points on 26.3 percent shooting,
and Stanford had its third win in a row.
The Cardinal will look to lock Cal
up in the paint while exploiting that
same space on offense. Johnson's phi
losophy has always favored an inside
out attack, but his team has never ex
ecuted it as well as they have this year.
Brook Lopez is scoring 17.2 points
per game and knows the offense
largely revolves around him.
"(Our goal is] just asserting our
presence down low, attacking the bas
ket, then when they start respecting
us inside, kicking it out more," lie said.
"When we're rolling and get our out
side game rolling, it's pretty hard to
beat us that way."
The Cardinal, just one loss behind
the Arizona State, UCLA and Wash
ington State in the Pac-10 standings,
must have been looking forward to
this game for months. So many teams
in this league have the speed to force
Stanford to go small, pushing the Car
dinal away from its strength. That
means playing just one Lopez at a
time and giving opponents a heavy
dose of the wings: Fred Washington, a
senior, juniors Mitch Johnson and
Anthony Goods and sophomore
Landry Fields.
Oregon and its point guardTajuan
Porter beat the Cardinal with their
speed and a small lineup; UCLA did
the same with guards Darren Colli
son and Russell Westbrook; and Ari
zona and point guard Nic Wise gave

Stanford quite the scare last rhurs
day.
Cal. on the other hand, is strongest
exactly where Stanford would like
them to be: in the post.
"You'll see a lot of [the twins)
playing together,"Trent Johnson said.
"Whether our bigs are good enough
to compete with theirs, that remains
to be seen. Look at it on paper — its
a pretty good matchup, quality of
players, size and position and all
that."
Again. Johnson's being polite, if
not 100 percent truthful. Sure, Cal's
Ryan Anderson and Patrick Christo
pher are for real. It's early, but their
numbers in the meat grinder of the
Pac-10(21 and 16 points per game re
spectively, on 47 percent accuracy)
are great. Center DeVon Hardin is
also a force; he should give the Lopez
twins all they can handle on the de
fensive side of the ball.
"To me he's one of those players,"
said Trent Johnson of the Bears' An
derson. "He's a three, four or a five.
Put him out there and he can flat-out
play."
And. to be fair. Cal is the stronger
team offensively, shooting 46 percent
overall and 40 percent from three
point range for 76 points per Pac-10
game. Stanford is mired at 40 percent
overall, 28 percent from long range
and 62 points per game. Add in the
homecourt edge and the hard-fought
nature of this rivalry, and the Bears
are just slight underdogs.
But that last word, underdog, is
the key. Stanford should win this one
on the backs of Brook and Robin in
side. both throwing it in themselves,
and passing out of double-teams to
an open Goods or Hill on the wings.
Those two juniors. Hill especially,
awoke from a slumber against Ari
zona State, and they should get plen
ty of open looks against a Cal back
court whose greatest weakness is its
defense.
