# BEAR DOWN
## No. 20 Cardinal looks to keep rolling in Berkeley

Oil and vinegar. Drinking and
driving. Cats and dogs.
Stanford and Cal.
Some things just don't mix. Luck
ily for Stanford (15-3, 4-2 Pac-10)
fans though, the Cardinal may have
the upper hand in its 4 p.m. Saturday
tilt with the hosting Bears (11 -6.2-4).
It's Trent Johnson 101: when
Stanford plays a lesser opponent,
make sure to talk them up as much
as possible, lest you come across as
haughty. The only problem is when
those pesky things called facts get in
the way.
"When you look at the stats in
conference games, you look at ours,
you look at theirs," coach Johnson
said. "How is this team 2-4?"
I'm not a math major, but Stan
ford is holding conference oppo
nents to 57 points per game, while
Cal is allowing 78 per game. 1 think
that might start to explain it. Teams
make 38 percent of their shots
against the Cardinal and 47 percent
against the Bears.

game. Defensively, senior forward

NOTES: The No. 20 Cardinal looks to
keep rolling against the rival Bears
Saturday as it crosses the Bay to take
on Cal. Stanford has thrived of late in
part because the team has used its
size to its advantage in keeping the
score low. The Cardinal leads the Fbc
-10 in rebounding with 39.4 rpg and
blocked shots with 80. Sophomore
Robin Lopez is the conference's indi
vidual leader in blocks with 37 on the
year.

familiar Bears team this weekend, which
runs its offense with a similar inside mentality
but has yet to match Stanford's dominant D.
