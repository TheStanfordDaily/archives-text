## No. 9 Cardinal women hope to leap past No. 8 UCLA with strong showing in Los Angeles 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The N0.9 Stanford women's gymnastics squad gears up to
face No. 8 UCLA this Sunday in Pauley Pavilion.
This meet marks UCLA's season home opener, but Stan
ford has already set the bar high after a stunning victory
against the EJruins on their home turf last year. Stanford beat
the Bruins 1%.N25 to 196.25 to maintain its N0.4 ranking
going into the postseason.
This year the Card and the Bruins are neck-in-neck in the
Pac-10. both fresh off of victories from last weekend.
Stanford will need to tap into its consistency and compo
sure this weekend as the Bruins feature tough competitors.
UCLA sophomore Anna Li is currently ranked in the top 20
in all events, redshirt freshman Brittani McCullough has been
putting up some high scores on vault and senior Tasha
Schwikert has been scoring well on bars.
But with a squad of 17, the Cardinal may have more am
munition than the Bruins can handle.
Returning this week are co-captain Ail-Americans Kelly
Fee and Nicole Ourada. Junior Heather Purnell. a former
Olympian, is now healthy and returning this year after suffer
ing a torn ACL last season.
"Purnell has worked really hard to get back in the line up."
Stanford coach Kristen Smyth said."She is a solid competitor
and a good sense of stability."
Sophomore Carly Janiga was named Event Specialist of
the Week on Jan. 13 for her performances on beam and bar.
Adding to the lineup are freshman Shelly Alexander on vault
and Danielle Ikoma.and with the precedent set over the last
two meets, redshirt freshman Allyse lshino should also be a
force to reckon with on bars.
Not only is this Sunday going to be a true test for the Car
dinal at Pauley Pavilion, but because gymnastics is a point
based sport where a team's ranking is determined by the cu
mulative score at the end of a meet, the Stanford women will
face the challenge of increasing the point values of their over
all scores.
"We really need to fix some of the wobbles and falls on
beam and floor and just rest up before we go to LA," senior
Stephanie Gentry said.
Despite having a low-scoring meet against Arizona, coach
Smyth is positive that the team is getting stronger everyday.
"Last weekend we had some nerves and we tried out a new
lineup. We just need to make sure that we keep our energy

up," coach Smyth said.
Smyth took advantage of the op
portunity to rest some of the team's
veterans against Arizona in prepara

tion for Sunday against the Bruins.
But she is not going to let the Bruins
get even an inch on the Card.
"We're putting in our top line up
this weekend and adding difficulty,"
she said. "We really want to bring a
team of 24 solid routines because
our consistency will be dangerous."
