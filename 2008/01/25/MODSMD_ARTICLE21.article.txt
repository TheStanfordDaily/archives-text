## Revenge v. Northridge will have to wait No. 6 Cardinal comes up short in rematch with No. 7 Matadors, losing in three games 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was not quite the rematch that Stanford had in mind at
No. 7 Northridge last night.The sixth-ranked men's volley
ball team was looking to make it two-for-two against the
Matadors, hut fell short, losing in three games. 30-25,31 -29
and 30-24.
Stanford (5-3,2-3 MPSF) was facing Northridge (5-2,3-
1) for the second time this season after winning in four
games at a preseason tournament earlier this month.They

were not exactly the
same teams that played
on Jan. 4. though.
Northridge's middle
blocker Cody Loe re
turned to the lineup
after missing the first
meeting, while Stanford
freshman outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin was
out with an ankle injury.
Loe finished with seven
kills and two blocks.
"Loe is a good play
er, but not as big a factor
as we expected him to
be," Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "The
outcome was dictated
more by our play and
their play. We were
streaky in point scoring
on offense and also
streaky siding out. and
that was our downfall."
In Stanford's win,
one of the biggest differ
ences was that the Car
dinal made fewer serv
ice errors. Last night,
serving was once again
key.

GAME NOTES: The No. 6 Cardinal fell
again to the Matadors, this time in
three games, after losing 3-1 to Norlh
ridge earlier this month. Stanford was
led by Evan Romero and Matt Ceran,
who notched ten and nine digs
against the Matadors, respectively. The
Cardinal will look to get back on track
tomorrow in Santa Barbara, where
John Kosty's squad will take on the
Gauchos, who have just one win to
their credit so far this season.

"Even though the serving column may l<x>k even (on the
stat sheet], CSU by far outserved us," Kosty said. "They
scored a lot of their points from serving, not true aces, hut
halls that put us into a free ball situation. And that gives
