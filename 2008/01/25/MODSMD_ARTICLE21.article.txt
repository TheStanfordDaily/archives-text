## Revenge v. Northridge will have to wait No. 6 Cardinal comes up short in rematch with No. 7 Matadors, losing in three games 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
It was not quite the rematch that Stanford had in mind at
No. 7 Northridge last night.The sixth-ranked men's volley
ball team was looking to make it two-for-two against the
Matadors, hut fell short, losing in three games. 30-25,31 -29
and 30-24.
Stanford (5-3,2-3 MPSF) was facing Northridge (5-2,3-
1) for the second time this season after winning in four
games at a preseason tournament earlier this month.They

were not exactly the
same teams that played
on Jan. 4. though.
Northridge's middle
blocker Cody Loe re
turned to the lineup
after missing the first
meeting, while Stanford
freshman outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin was
out with an ankle injury.
Loe finished with seven
kills and two blocks.
"Loe is a good play
er, but not as big a factor
as we expected him to
be," Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "The
outcome was dictated
more by our play and
their play. We were
streaky in point scoring
on offense and also
streaky siding out. and
that was our downfall."
In Stanford's win,
one of the biggest differ
ences was that the Car
dinal made fewer serv
ice errors. Last night,
serving was once again
key.

GAME NOTES: The No. 6 Cardinal fell
again to the Matadors, this time in
three games, after losing 3-1 to Norlh
ridge earlier this month. Stanford was
led by Evan Romero and Matt Ceran,
who notched ten and nine digs
against the Matadors, respectively. The
Cardinal will look to get back on track
tomorrow in Santa Barbara, where
John Kosty's squad will take on the
Gauchos, who have just one win to
their credit so far this season.

"Even though the serving column may l<x>k even (on the
stat sheet], CSU by far outserved us," Kosty said. "They
scored a lot of their points from serving, not true aces, hut
halls that put us into a free ball situation. And that gives
them the opportunity to score another
point."
Ihe Cardinal had six service aces
and 18 errors, while the Matadors
served seven aces and missed 20. Five
Stanford players notched at least tme
ace. with senior outside hitter Matt
Ceran tallying two. All seven aces were
served by Tanner Nua. who also missed
a match-high six.
"Tanner Nua was by far their best
server," Kosty said. "He is a big kid. a
left-handed opposite hitter and he was
serving tough and giving us big prob
lems."
On offense, the Cardinal was led by
sophomore Evan Romero with 14
kills, while redshirt junior outside hitter
Jesse Meredith chipped in nine.
Romero led all players with 10 kills and
he and junior middle blocker Brandon
Williams each had two block assists,
though the Cardinal managed only
three to the Matadors' eight.
Eric Vance recorded a match-high
15 kills and Kevin McKniffledthe way
with five blocks.
Northridge jumped out to a 9-5 lead
to start the match, but a four-point
Stanford run tied it. Nua served seven
points in a row. including back-to-back
aces, to put the game out of reach. The
Matadors won it. 30-25, on a kill.
It was Stanford with the early lead
in the second game, going up 10-5, with
three of those points coming on aces.
However, when Nua came to the line
at 12-10, the Matadors caught up and
went ahead by four. Down by a point,
Romero spurred a Stanford run with
three kills in a row and the Cardinal
built a 22-19 advantage. Stanford had
its first game point of the night at 29-28,
but Northridge scored the last three
points of the game to win 31-29.
Ihe Matadors did not let up in the
third game, going ahead 2-1 and never
relinquishing the lead. They led by as
much as eight and — though Stanford
held off three match points — closed
out the victory, 30-24.
It has been a week of upsets around
the MPS!', with more than just Stan
ford losing to lower-ranked teams. On
Wednesday, N<> 11 DSC held on t<>
beat No. 5 UCLA in five games and
No. 10 UC-Irvine took only four games
to hand second-ranked Pepperdine its
first loss of the season.
After winning three in a row. the
Cardinal has now dropped two consec
utively. but has a chance to end that
slide tonight at UC-Santa Barbara.The
Gauchos (1-5,0-3) got the first win of
their season against Pacific at the Ele

three straight since then, most recently
to Northridge last week.

we need to continually be a good serv

Santa Barbara will be looking for its

record back up to .S(X). Jeff Menzel is
the top hitter for the Gauchos with 120
kills — four times as many as any of his
teammates.

Stanford (5-3,2-3 MPSF) was facing Northridge (5-2,3-
1) for the second time this season after winning in four
games at a preseason tournament earlier this month.They

were not exactly the
same teams that played
on Jan. 4. though.
Northridge's middle
blocker Cody Loe re
turned to the lineup
after missing the first
meeting, while Stanford
freshman outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin was
out with an ankle injury.
Loe finished with seven
kills and two blocks.
"Loe is a good play
er, but not as big a factor
as we expected him to
be," Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "The
outcome was dictated
more by our play and
their play. We were
streaky in point scoring
on offense and also
streaky siding out. and
that was our downfall."
In Stanford's win,
one of the biggest differ
ences was that the Car
dinal made fewer serv
ice errors. Last night,
serving was once again
key.

GAME NOTES: The No. 6 Cardinal fell
again to the Matadors, this time in
three games, after losing 3-1 to Norlh
ridge earlier this month. Stanford was
led by Evan Romero and Matt Ceran,
who notched ten and nine digs
against the Matadors, respectively. The
Cardinal will look to get back on track
tomorrow in Santa Barbara, where
John Kosty's squad will take on the
Gauchos, who have just one win to
their credit so far this season.

"Even though the serving column may l<x>k even (on the
stat sheet], CSU by far outserved us," Kosty said. "They
scored a lot of their points from serving, not true aces, hut
halls that put us into a free ball situation. And that gives
them the opportunity to score another
point."
Ihe Cardinal had six service aces
and 18 errors, while the Matadors
served seven aces and missed 20. Five
Stanford players notched at least tme
ace. with senior outside hitter Matt
Ceran tallying two. All seven aces were
served by Tanner Nua. who also missed
a match-high six.
"Tanner Nua was by far their best
server," Kosty said. "He is a big kid. a
left-handed opposite hitter and he was
serving tough and giving us big prob
lems."
On offense, the Cardinal was led by
sophomore Evan Romero with 14
kills, while redshirt junior outside hitter
Jesse Meredith chipped in nine.
Romero led all players with 10 kills and
he and junior middle blocker Brandon
Williams each had two block assists,
though the Cardinal managed only
three to the Matadors' eight.
Eric Vance recorded a match-high
15 kills and Kevin McKniffledthe way
with five blocks.
Northridge jumped out to a 9-5 lead
to start the match, but a four-point
Stanford run tied it. Nua served seven
points in a row. including back-to-back
aces, to put the game out of reach. The
Matadors won it. 30-25, on a kill.
It was Stanford with the early lead
in the second game, going up 10-5, with
three of those points coming on aces.
However, when Nua came to the line
at 12-10, the Matadors caught up and
went ahead by four. Down by a point,
Romero spurred a Stanford run with
three kills in a row and the Cardinal
built a 22-19 advantage. Stanford had
its first game point of the night at 29-28,
but Northridge scored the last three
points of the game to win 31-29.
Ihe Matadors did not let up in the
third game, going ahead 2-1 and never
relinquishing the lead. They led by as
much as eight and — though Stanford
held off three match points — closed
out the victory, 30-24.
It has been a week of upsets around
the MPS!', with more than just Stan
ford losing to lower-ranked teams. On
Wednesday, N<> 11 DSC held on t<>
beat No. 5 UCLA in five games and
No. 10 UC-Irvine took only four games
to hand second-ranked Pepperdine its
first loss of the season.
After winning three in a row. the
Cardinal has now dropped two consec
utively. but has a chance to end that
slide tonight at UC-Santa Barbara.The
Gauchos (1-5,0-3) got the first win of
their season against Pacific at the Ele
phant Bar Invitational, but have lost

three straight since then, most recently
to Northridge last week.
"We need to really improve our
serving and passing [on Friday night]."
kosty. "It always goes back to that —
we need to continually be a good serv
ing and passing team if we want to
win."
Santa Barbara will be looking for its
first conference victory, while Stanford
will be looking to bump its MPSF
record back up to .S(X). Jeff Menzel is
the top hitter for the Gauchos with 120
kills — four times as many as any of his
teammates.
Sam Moisenco leads in blocks with
27 and Max Klineman — brother of
Alix. an Ail-American freshman on
the Stanford women's team — is aver
aging nearly 11 assists per game.'
After tonight, the Cardinal will re
turn home to host Pacific next Thurs
day night and Ball State on Sunday.
Ihe following week, it will be a replay
of this week's action with Northridge
and Santa Barbara coming to the
Farm.
