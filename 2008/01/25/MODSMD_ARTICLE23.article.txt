Davis, will be held next Tuesday, Jan.

lineup still features a formidable
combination of talent and youth.
Stanford is led by junior Jessica
Nguyen at No. 21, sophomore Lind
say Burdette at No. 39 and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh at No. 58. Joining
them is senior Celia Durkin, a re

cluding bouts against No. 14 Fresno
State and No. 43 IJNLV, all at home.

Wrestling triumphs in home opener
In the first of a three-dual home
stand. Stanford wrestling upended
Cal State Bakersfield in front of a

full house at the Ford Center. 22-
16.
The Cardinal (8-2, 2-1 Pacific
10) rode key wins from some of the
squad's most consistent performers
to victory, winning six of 10 match
es against the Roadrunners (5-2.4-
2). Redshirt freshman Lucas Esper
icueta got Stanford's first victory of
the night at 149 pounds, avenging a
previous loss to Bakersfield's Jere
my Doyle with a 4-2 decision. No.
10 senior Josh Zupancic then con
tinued the Cardinal's run at 157
pounds with a decisive 10-5 victory.
The Stanford wrestlers really
began to hit their stride, though, in
the 174, 184, and 197 pound weight
classes, where junior Luke Feist
and sophomores Zach Giesen and
Jake Johnson each earned their re
spective victories. Giesen's domi
nating, 13-2 major decision gave
the Cardinal its first team lead of
the night at 13-10, hut Johnson's 8-
3 victory, culminating with a deci
sive third period reversal, seemed
equally important in keeping the
meet's overall momentum on Stan
ford's side.
No. 6 senior Tanner Gardner
then sealed the Stanford win with a
first period pin of his opponent at
125 pounds, Zack Bigboy. Bigboy
seemed to give Gardner some trou
ble early in the period, reversing
the Cardinal captain to tie the score
at two before Gardner answered
back with a dominant reversal and
pin at 2:57. The win by fall was
Gardner's 15th of the season, a new
personal best for the two-time All-
American. elevating his record on
the season to an astounding 28-1.
The Cardinal will look to sweep
its homestand tomorrow evening at
the Ford Center when it takes on
No. is (in the NAIA rankings)
Menlo College at 5 p.m. I"he team
will also face Pac-1() rival Portland
State (1 -7,0-5) on Saturday at 7.
