## EPA defends Calif, greenhouse gases 
### ERICA WERNER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) _ The
Bush administration's top envi
ronmental regulator faced off
Thursday against Democratic
senators who took turns de
nouncing him for blocking
tailpipe emission cuts in Califor
nia and more than a dozen other
states.
EPA Administrator Stephen
L. Johnson defended his decision
and didn't budge as he was ac
cused of doing the bidding of the
White House and the auto indus
try. It was his first Capitol Hill ap
pearance since denying a federal
waiver last month that would
have allowed California to imple
ment a law slashing greenhouse
gas emissions from cars and
trucks.
Other states could then have
followed suit and 12 were ready
to do so, with others making
preparations.
"I evaluated all the data. I
made the decision, it's the right
decision," Johnson said. "I was
not directed by anyone to make
the decision.
"I am bound by the criteria in
the Clean Air Act, not people's
opinions," he said, contending
California did not meet all those
criteria.
Because global warming is an
international phenomenon not
unique to California, the state
doesn't need its own standards to
meet "compelling and extraordi
nary conditions" as set out in the
law, Johnson said.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
the committee chair, led commit
tee Democrats in assailing John
son's conclusion.
"You're going against your
own agency's mission and you're
fulfilling the mission of some spe
cial interests," she chided him.
Boxer had released excerpts
from Environmental Protection
Agency documents on Wednes
day showing that EPA officials
had advised Johnson that Califor
nia did have the "compelling and
extraordinary conditions" re
quired under law, because of its
vulnerability to environmental
impacts of global warming.
The internal documents also
showed that EPA officials had

concluded that the agency would
likely lose in court if sued over
denying the waiver. California
and other states did in fact sue
earlier this month.
Johnson refused to get drawn
in about those documents, insist
ing repeatedly that he "consid
ered a wide range of options" be
fore making his decision.
The lone Republican senator
to attend the hearing. Sen. James
Inhofe of Oklahoma, was the only
one to come to the administra
tor's defense. Inhofe dismissed
the proceedings as "more the
ater" and called California's law a
"job killer" for the auto industry.
California's first-in-the-nation
tailpipe rules would force au
tomakers to cut greenhouse gas
emissions by 30 percent in new
cars and light trucks by 2016, with
reductions starting with the 2(HW
model year.
Twelve other states have al
ready adopted those rules —
Connecticut. Maine, Maryland.
Massachusetts. New Jersey. New
Mexico, New York, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ver
mont. and Washington — with
others preparing to do so.
Boxer took testimony Iliurs
day from governors of three
states that have adopted the rules.
Democrats Ed Rendell of Penn
sylvania and Martin O'Malley of
Maryland, and Republican Jim
Douglas of Vermont. Providing
the opposing viewpoint was
Michigan's attorney general. Re
publican Mike Cox. Cox com
plained Michigan's auto industry
is being singled out while other in
dustries, like Pennsylvania's coal
plants, aren't being regulated for
greenhouse gases — something
Rendell disputed.
Johnson contends that Con
gress' newly passed fuel efficiency
law — signed by President Bush
last month on the same day Cali
fornia's waiver was denied —
provides such a national stan
dard
California officials argue that
their law is much stronger and
takes effect much faster than the
new federal rules.
Johnson was also grilled on a
separate-but-related issue: When
EPA will issue plans for control
ling greenhouse gases from new
automobiles nationally
