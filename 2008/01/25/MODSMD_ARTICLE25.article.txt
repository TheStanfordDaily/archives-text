## Victor unpredictable in Hawaii caucuses

HONOLULU (AP) _ Hawaii
Republicans begin meeting in
their caucuses today, but don't
expect to get a clear picture of
who they're supporting for pres
ident.
Unlike Democrats, island Re
publicans won't hold a presiden
tial preference poll that would
give a clue about which candidate
they're leaning toward at their
caucuses, which will be held in
each of the state's 51 districts
through Feb. 5.
Instead, the Republican cau
cuses will be used to elect dele
gates to the state convention in
May. Only then will Hawaii's
choice for president emerge.
"The presidential race is so far
beyond anything that we influ
ence," said Maui County GOP
Chairwoman Kay Ghean.
"Frankly, the most important
thing in my view is finding people
who can improve things for the
citizens of Hawaii."
The Hawaii Republican cau
cus process is largely informal.
The first GOP caucus is Friday
evening in Lahaina, Maui, with six
more on Saturday on Oahu, the
Big Island and Maui. The last is
Feb. 5 in Honolulu.
Republicans will gather in
parks, businesses and homes to
pick convention delegates.They'll
appeal to be chosen based on
their work within the party, their
ties to the community and their
political philosophy.
Maybe even some of them will
ask for votes because of who
they're backing for president, but
there's no requirement that dele
gates state a preference.
"I would not be surprised to
see people at our caucus say. Vote
for me, Fm a Rudy Giuliani or
Ron Paul guy, and 1 want to carry
his principles to the convention,"'
said Bob Kessler, chairman for
the Waikiki district. "There might
be some Mitt Romney or Mike
Huckabee guys sitting on their
hands and saying, 'Yeah right, like
I'm going to elect you as a dele
gate."'
Several districts may decide to
hold straw polls to get a sense of
which candidate voters are sup
porting, said state Republican
Party Chairman Willes Lee, but
none of the votes will be binding
on delegate selection.
"A few district chairmen asked
whether they could hold secret,
for-fun straw polls," Lee said.
"There's nothing saying districts
here can't do that."
But those results won't be re
ported or consolidated on a
statewide level, he said.
In state Rep. Kymberly Pine's
district, she said she'll have peo

pie over to her house for the cau
cus. where they'll eat barbecue
before voting for delegates.
Fine. R-Ewa Beach-lroquois
Point, is a co-chair of John Mc-
Cain's Hawaii campaign and she
wants to be elected as a delegate
to the conventions.
"Our caucus is going to be re
ally casual and fun. 1 won't let
people in until they promise to
vote for me," she joked.
Once Hawaii's 1,093 state del
egates are chosen, 20 national del
egates will be selected at the
Hawaii Republican convention
set for May 16-18.
Before that vote, potential
delegates may declare their
presidential choice, and it will be
placed on the ballot next to their
names, Lee said. If elected, na
tional delegates pledged to a
candidate will be bound to sup
port their candidate through the
first round of voting at the na
tionwide Republican conven
tion in St. Paul. Minn, from Sept.
1-4.
Hawaii Republicans may have
a split delegation with its repre
sentatives supporting various
candidates, Lee said. Because
Hawaii isn't a winner-take-all
state, that could make the islands
relevant because every vote
counts toward each candidate's
total.
None of the Republican candi
dates has emerged as a favorite in
Hawaii. McCain. Giuliani and
Paul are most frequently men
tioned. with Romney and Huck
abee seeming to trail.
"No wonder people keep call
ing about our caucuses. This is
confusing as hell, and every state
is different," Lee said.
Hawaii Democrats hold their
state caucuses on a single day on
Feb. 19, where they will make
their choice known among front
runners Barack Obama. Hillary
Clinton. John Edwards and Den
nis Kucinich. Democrats will also
elect state convention delegates
at that time.
To participate in the caucuses,
you must be a registered member
of the political party and a regis
tered Hawaii voter.
For Democrats, caucuses are
open to anyone who will sign a
party card at the caucus. For Re
publicans, you have to sign up 10
days in advance of the caucus in
your district, so it's already too
late for most.
In 2004, despite the dominance
of Democrats in the state, fewer
than 4.000 residents statewide
voted in the Democratic presi
dential caucuses. For the minority
Republicans, because of the regis
tration requirement and since
there was no presidential vote, the
count is believed to have been
much lower.
