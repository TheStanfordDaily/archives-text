## Nevada woman accused of cutting Tahoe trees 
### SCOTT SONNER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RENO. Nev. (AP) _ A federal
grand jury has indicted a Nevada
woman for allegedly hiring a crew to
cut down three large pine trees up to
a century old on U.S. Forest Service
land at Lake Tahoe. prosecutors said
Wednesday.
Patricia M. Vincent, 58, Incline
Village, was indicted by the grand
jury in Reno last week on two
charges, including theft of govern
ment property. If convicted, she faces
up to 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine for each count.
The three ponderosa pine trees
from 80 to 100 years old were grow
ing on a national forest lot the Forest

Service had designated as environ
mentally sensitive as part of a plan to
help protect the clarity of Lake
Tahoe. The property is across the
street from the Robert Trent Jones
Sr.-designed Incline Village Champi
onship Golf Course.
The indictment accuses Vincent
of hiring a commercial tree removal
business in April to cut down the
trees to enhance her view. The dam
age exceeded $ I ().()()(), the indict
ment said.
"It is important that public lands,
which are held in trust for the benefit
of all citizens, are appropriately pro
tected by our land management
agencies," U.S. Attorney Gregory
Brower said in a statement.
"Individuals who unlawfully en

croach on these lands and cause
damage will be prosecuted he said.
Vincent could not immediately be
reached for comment and it was not
clear whether she had a lawyer.
The site is among several parcels
of land the federal agency has estab
lished in recent years as conservation
lots aimed at maintaining mature
vegetation that helps stabilize soils
and combat erosion that contributes
to the lake's degradation.
"We are glad to see this type of of
fense taken seriously," said Rochelle
Nason, executive director of the
League to Save Lake Tahoe.
"There are certainly situations
where it is appropriate to remove
trees for management purposes, but
taking them for the value of the

wood or to enhance someone's view
is extremely inappropriate," she said.
Vincent was ordered to appear in
U.S. District Court in Reno on Feb.
25 before Magistrate Judge Valerie P.
Cooke. Vincent also faces one count
of willingly injuring or committing
any depredation against any proper
ty of the United States.
Forest Service spokesman Rex
Norman said trees have been cut ille
gally on national forest land in the
Tahoe Basin before but he was not
aware of any similar federal prosecu
tion.
Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Las
Vegas,said she did not recall any sim
ilar prosecution but could not be
sure.
