# Basque leader's visit stirs protest
## Jose Ibarretxe invited to speak Feb. 14, but facing opposition 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the president of the Basque Government speaks at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center on Feb. 14. he shouldn't expect
Valentines from everyone in the audience.
Spain's regional politics have indirectly led to a ruckus on
campus. A controversial seminar with Juan Jose Ibarretxe,
sponsored by the Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, has caused a firestorm in Spain and prompted a
Stanford student to initiate a petition that has garnered 3,500
online signatures.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for the neighboring region
al government of Navarra that has opposed Ibarretxe sent a
letter to President John I lennessy protesting the event.That
letter, which called for other perspectives to be heard on
campus instead, is detailed in Friday's edition of Diario de
Navarra, a Spanish newspaper.
Ibarretxe, the visitor, is seen by opponents in neighboring
communities as a nationalist who sympathizes with the the
Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA),
which the U.S. State Department classifies as a terrorist or
ganization.
University officials say they will not rescind the invitation
and frame the visit as being about academic freedom. They
say that the timing of the long-planned event has nothing to
do with influencing the Spanish general elections,set for only
three weeks after the scheduled visit.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82, who is of Basque heritage himself,
argued that the political climate in
Spain has made it easy for certain par
ties to condemn all Basque politicians
for the crimes committed by the ETA.
This is analogous, he said, to condemn
ing all Muslims for the crimes commit
ted by terrorists on Sept. 11,2001.
"The question of whether the
Forum on Contemporary Europe
should be allowed to invite Mr. Ibar
retxe to speak at Stanford is not even a
hard question," Etchemendy said.
"Should they be allowed to invite Mus
lim politicians, even though there are
some who would condemn all Muslims
for y/11? Of course."
The petition opposing Ibarretxe's
visit was organized by a student at Stan
ford, along with Jose Manuel Campor
ro. a Silicon Valley worker who grew up
in the Basque city ofVitoria, and anoth
er working professional from the Bay
Area. Organizers said to expect large
protests during the visit.
Prof. Joan Ramon Resina. the chair
of the Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ments, said the majority of those who
have signed the petition come from
Spain.
"If our events were subject to can
cellation by those who, here and
abroad, do not approve of the speakers,
we would soon not hold any events but
the most anodyne," he said. "[Those]
people do not understand that academ
ic freedom is the basis on which our
[U.S.] universities, and Stanford in par
ticular, stand."
Critics, including prominent
Spaniards and a member of the Euro
pean Parliament, say University offi
cials are providing a platform for a
fringe politician to advocate a referen
dum on independence for the Basque
region of northern Spain — the most
controversial issue in the country for
more than a quarter century.
These opponents say the proposal,
which they perceive as a land grab by a
territory-hungry politician, has been re
jected by the central government in
Madrid.
Juan Maria Atutxa. a politician in
the Basque country and member of the
Basque Nationalist Party, was found
guilty this week of disobeying a
Supreme Court ruling for refusing to
dissolve Batasuna, an illegal national
ist, political wing of ETA.The U.S. con

siders Batasuna, which Atutxa protect
ed, to he a terrorist organization.
According to Basque News and In
formation Channel eitb24, Ibarretxe
defends Atutxa for his protection of
Batasuna, saying he did nothing wrong.
Etchemendy said that Ibarretxe is a
popular politician in the Basque region
because he has consistently con
demned the violent tactics of ETA and
supports a peaceful resolution to the
turmoil, which has included bombings,
murders and kidnappings.
Resina extended the invitation to
Ibarretxe in conjunction with the
Forum on Contemporary Europe
(FCE) — a section of the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI) that houses the
Iberian Studies Program, which Resina
created and directs.
He said that the FSI routinely in
vites European political leaders from
across the political spectrum and that
the FCE is particularly interested in
anyone who can address issues of press
ing interest. Resina argued that Basque
Country is one of the historical nation
alities within the Spanish state and a
crucial component of Iberian culture
and society.
"President Ibarretxe's talk has par
ticular interest in the European con
text, where similar processes of popular
consultation have taken place," Resina
said, pointing to Scotland as an exam
ple. "Furthermore, Ibarretxe's propos
al, under certain conditions, could
prove to be the elusive tool to negotiate
a definitive ceasefire by ETA. which in
the last decade has declared 10 long
term truces only to break them later for
lack of political progress in the negotia
tions."
Those upset with the University
program say that if better understand
ing the issue is the goal, then a panel of
speakers with diverse viewpoints
should be invited.
"Since Ibarretxe has the same posi
tion as a state governor in the U.S.. why
not invite another president from one
of the other 16 autonomous provinces
in Spain governed by liberals or conser
vatives?" Camporro asked. "Why not
somebody who can speak for the vic
tims of their manipulation, extortion?"
Resina argues that this would limit
the Basque president's ability to make
a formal address by downgrading his
lecture to a sparring match with little or
no guarantee of propriety. It would also

provide the protesters with a symbolic
victory by forcing an unintended
speaker on Stanford. Additionally,
Resina pointed out that a challenger
would make people forget that there is
no institutional peer of I barret xe's level
on Basque matters.
Resina said he did not ask the
Basque president to speak on any spe
cific topic.
"I assume that his plan for a demo
cratic consultation of the people in
[Basque Country] will feature in his
lecture." he said. "But again. 1 have not
defined or otherwise preconditioned
the content of the lecture in any way."
The lecture, which will include a
question-and-answer session, is touted
on the University Web site as an oppor
tunity for Ibarretxe to discuss his
"Road Map to bring an end to the
Basque Conflict."
Since Spain will have a general elec
tion approximately three weeks after
Ibarretxe conies to Stanford, it has
been suggested by the organizers of the
petition that the lecture could poten
tially impact the results by giving the
force of Stanford's name to the ideas
that the Basque leader is expected to
advocate.
Debra Zumwalt, the University's
general counsel, said that it does not vi
olate University policy on political ac
tivities to have speakers on campus talk
about their policies and beliefs, even if
the speakers are politicians and even if
they have controversial views.
"We have had many world leaders
and candidates for political office speak
at Stanford." she said, "some of them
with very controversial positions."
Just as Columbia University went
ahead with plans to host Iranian presi
dent Mahmud Ahmadinejad in Sep
tember, even after top administrators
came under fire, it seems highly unlike
ly that Stanford organizers will step
down.
"The intensity and scope of the un
supported accusations against Presi
dent Ibarretxe are among the ugliest
things 1 have seen in my long academic
life," Resina said. "'lTie organizers of
the protest have chosen the path of
confrontation rather than the demo
cratic one of discussion with the speak
er. according to academic protocol."
