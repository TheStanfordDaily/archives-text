# Basque leader's visit stirs protest
## Jose Ibarretxe invited to speak Feb. 14, but facing opposition 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the president of the Basque Government speaks at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center on Feb. 14. he shouldn't expect
Valentines from everyone in the audience.
Spain's regional politics have indirectly led to a ruckus on
campus. A controversial seminar with Juan Jose Ibarretxe,
sponsored by the Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, has caused a firestorm in Spain and prompted a
Stanford student to initiate a petition that has garnered 3,500
online signatures.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for the neighboring region
al government of Navarra that has opposed Ibarretxe sent a
letter to President John I lennessy protesting the event.That
letter, which called for other perspectives to be heard on
campus instead, is detailed in Friday's edition of Diario de
Navarra, a Spanish newspaper.
Ibarretxe, the visitor, is seen by opponents in neighboring
communities as a nationalist who sympathizes with the the
Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA),
which the U.S. State Department classifies as a terrorist or
ganization.
University officials say they will not rescind the invitation
and frame the visit as being about academic freedom. They
say that the timing of the long-planned event has nothing to
do with influencing the Spanish general elections,set for only
three weeks after the scheduled visit.
