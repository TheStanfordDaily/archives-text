We've all heard enough about the writers'
strike by now that we could all write our own
made-for-TV movie about it, complete with
Newsies-style dancing and hats. Fortunately,
however, no one need resort to such desper
ate measures to entertain themselves. As
Mark Burnett has long been preaching, who
needs writers to have TV? Reality shows and
leftover scripts are still there for you. So be
fore you start enacting "Twelfth Night" with
your quadmates, remember that your old
friend Stevie the TV will never let you down,
especially not with these best-of-the-scabs
shows on now.
American Gladiators
The new American Gladiators, on NBC, is a
revival of the show that ran from 1989 to
1997. Former enthusiasts will be pleased that
the format is similar to that of the original
show — but now it has enormous water tanks
and FIRE! Ordinary people become contes
tants to attempt to best the show's gladiators
in games including: "Assault" (attempt to
shoot a tennis ball crossbow, air cannon, etc.
at a target before a gladiator shoots you with
a tennis ball cannon), "Joust" (use your giant
Q-tip to knock the gladiator off the platform
before he knocks you off), and "Gauntlet"
(try to get by the gladiators as they smash you
with various foam-filled shapes). You can
cheer for the everyman or root for your fa
vorite of the gladiators. The female gladiators
include Crush, Venom and Fury (as opposed
to the original lady-gladiators who had names
like Gold and Lace); the male gladiators have
equally terror-inspiring names such as Jus
tice, Mayhem and Militia. Hosts Hulk Hogan
and Laila Ali add a touch of serious badass.
The entertaining show also allows ample
room for entertaining your own dreams of
besting the gladiators — and if you're seri
ous, you can always fill out an application!
Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
For those of you who haven't seen "Termina
tor" 1 or 2. the robots want Sarah Connor
dead because her son will one day grow up to
lead the human resistance against them. (Inci
dentally, at some point, the robots have in
deed taken over.) This new show, Mondays
on Fox, is set after "Terminator 2" and before
"Terminator 3," and Sarah (played by Lena

Headey) and her adolescent son John
(Thomas Dekker) are just trying to stay alive,
evade the robots from the future who want to
terminate them, and hopefully prevent the
rise of the machines. Either fortunately or un
fortunately, depending on your point of view,
instead of sending a future governor robot
back in time as protection, the human alliance
has sent back a lithe young robo-babe.
Cameron (Summer Glau — sci-fi geeks will
remember her as River Tam from "Firefly"),
who literally kills people without blinking.
The show has occasional moments of humor,
like when Cameron tries out some slang she
picks up in the high school girls' restroom, but
is often weighed down by the burden of the
future under which Sarah and her son live. It's
hard to lighten up when the fate of hu
mankind rests on your shoulders and invinci
ble metal dudes keep trying to kill you every
single day. The show docs earn points for
loads of ass-kicking action: someone dies at
least once an episode. Woohoo! If that's what
you're into, that is.
Crowned
Crowned, the CW's new filling-in-for-Ameri
ca's-Next-Top-Model-show. brings reality
TV to a world even less rooted in reality than
the fashion industry — the pageant circuit.
Pairing mothers and daughters in a competi
tion to be crowned beauty queens, contes
tants participate in challenges designed to
show that they are talented, attractive, well
spoken and caring enough to win. though it
often seems like the teams are only trying to
out-crazy each other. The combination of
mother-daughter conflict and the inevitable
caltincss that emerges from so many women
in one house (sorry, Roth) spells near-con
stant drama, or, in other words, some serious
guilty-pleasure entertainment. Perhaps the
best part of the show is the inherent irony in
combining pageants, designed to showcase
women at their best, with reality TV, guaran
teed to reveal people at their worst. Or
maybe the best part is the bitchy women in
sashes. Decide for yourself on Wednesday
nights.
Breaking Bad
AMC's new Sunday night drama features a
high school chemistry teacher who decides
to start making methamphetamines. What
more could you ask for in a show? Well, yes,
you could ask for a main character from

"Malcolm in the Middle," and bam. you've
got Bryan Cranston, who played Hal. the
dad. Cranston now takes on the role of
Walt, the main character and aforemen
tioned teacher-turned-meth-cooker. The
show explores the two worlds that collide
through his decision and also provides some
reasonable practical information about cre
ating meth, which, as viewers learned in the
first episode, is both a science and an art,
particularly if attempted in the least attrac
tive underwear anyone has ever seen on
television. Jesse, played by Aaron Paul (no
table for appearances in both "K-Pax" and
"National Lampoon's Van Wilder"! Yes,
both!), plays Walt's new drug-dealin' BFF,
handling the "business" side of things, which
so far has consisted of getting beat up by
some rival drugsters. Find out for yourself
why exactly Walt has chosen this moment in
his life to take up meth-making in an engag
ing and realistic, if not exactly pretty, por
trait of a desperate man breaking bad and
breaking loose.
An episode saved is an episode earned...
In case none of these scabs earn your devo
tion. some of your favorite shows have clever
ly saved a few more new episodes. "Chuck,"
NBC's spy + everynian show (imagine Seth
Cohen and Sydney Bristow on one set), refer
ences Stanford so much that we should at
least give them our viewership. Eye candy of
both genders, espionage and copious adora
tion of our alma mater? Hell yes! "House."
featuring the most sarcastic character on tele
vision. also has bizarre diseases and intra-hos
pital drama. Did we mention the sarcasm?
Find the good doctor on CBS. No discussion
of savcd-episodes-worth-catching would be
complete without "Gossip Girl," the newest
baby of Josh Schwartz, creator of "The OC."
Watch gorgeous, well-dressed teen angst on
the cast coast this time around!
Old friends return!
"America's Next Top Model," Cycle 10, be
gins airing on the CW on February 20. This
cycle, it's back in New York and no more
Twiggy, who has been replaced as a judge by
Czech supermodel Paulina Porizkova. Big
Brother returns to CBS with its 9th season
on Tuesday, February 12 at 9 p.m. Hope for
lots of hot tub shenanigans and the usual
scandal that results when you lock 12 people
in a house with absolutely nothing to do.

Cameron (Summer Glau — sci-fi geeks will
remember her as River Tam from "Firefly"),
who literally kills people without blinking.
The show has occasional moments of humor,
like when Cameron tries out some slang she
picks up in the high school girls' restroom, but
is often weighed down by the burden of the
future under which Sarah and her son live. It's
hard to lighten up when the fate of hu
mankind rests on your shoulders and invinci
ble metal dudes keep trying to kill you every
single day. The show docs earn points for
loads of ass-kicking action: someone dies at
least once an episode. Woohoo! If that's what
you're into, that is.
Crowned
Crowned, the CW's new filling-in-for-Ameri
ca's-Next-Top-Model-show. brings reality
TV to a world even less rooted in reality than
the fashion industry — the pageant circuit.
Pairing mothers and daughters in a competi
tion to be crowned beauty queens, contes
tants participate in challenges designed to
show that they are talented, attractive, well
spoken and caring enough to win. though it
often seems like the teams are only trying to
out-crazy each other. The combination of
mother-daughter conflict and the inevitable
caltincss that emerges from so many women
in one house (sorry, Roth) spells near-con
stant drama, or, in other words, some serious
guilty-pleasure entertainment. Perhaps the
best part of the show is the inherent irony in
combining pageants, designed to showcase
women at their best, with reality TV, guaran
teed to reveal people at their worst. Or
maybe the best part is the bitchy women in
sashes. Decide for yourself on Wednesday
nights.
Breaking Bad
AMC's new Sunday night drama features a
high school chemistry teacher who decides
to start making methamphetamines. What
more could you ask for in a show? Well, yes,
you could ask for a main character from

"Malcolm in the Middle," and bam. you've
got Bryan Cranston, who played Hal. the
dad. Cranston now takes on the role of
Walt, the main character and aforemen
tioned teacher-turned-meth-cooker. The
show explores the two worlds that collide
through his decision and also provides some
reasonable practical information about cre
ating meth, which, as viewers learned in the
first episode, is both a science and an art,
particularly if attempted in the least attrac
tive underwear anyone has ever seen on
television. Jesse, played by Aaron Paul (no
table for appearances in both "K-Pax" and
"National Lampoon's Van Wilder"! Yes,
both!), plays Walt's new drug-dealin' BFF,
handling the "business" side of things, which
so far has consisted of getting beat up by
some rival drugsters. Find out for yourself
why exactly Walt has chosen this moment in
his life to take up meth-making in an engag
ing and realistic, if not exactly pretty, por
trait of a desperate man breaking bad and
breaking loose.
An episode saved is an episode earned...
In case none of these scabs earn your devo
tion. some of your favorite shows have clever
ly saved a few more new episodes. "Chuck,"
NBC's spy + everynian show (imagine Seth
Cohen and Sydney Bristow on one set), refer
ences Stanford so much that we should at
least give them our viewership. Eye candy of
both genders, espionage and copious adora
tion of our alma mater? Hell yes! "House."
featuring the most sarcastic character on tele
vision. also has bizarre diseases and intra-hos
pital drama. Did we mention the sarcasm?
Find the good doctor on CBS. No discussion

baby of Josh Schwartz, creator of "The OC."
Watch gorgeous, well-dressed teen angst on
the cast coast this time around!

We've all heard enough about the writers'
strike by now that we could all write our own
made-for-TV movie about it, complete with
Newsies-style dancing and hats. Fortunately,
however, no one need resort to such desper
ate measures to entertain themselves. As
Mark Burnett has long been preaching, who
needs writers to have TV? Reality shows and
leftover scripts are still there for you. So be
fore you start enacting "Twelfth Night" with
your quadmates, remember that your old
friend Stevie the TV will never let you down,
especially not with these best-of-the-scabs
shows on now.
American Gladiators
The new American Gladiators, on NBC, is a
revival of the show that ran from 1989 to
1997. Former enthusiasts will be pleased that
the format is similar to that of the original
show — but now it has enormous water tanks
and FIRE! Ordinary people become contes
tants to attempt to best the show's gladiators
in games including: "Assault" (attempt to
shoot a tennis ball crossbow, air cannon, etc.
at a target before a gladiator shoots you with
a tennis ball cannon), "Joust" (use your giant
Q-tip to knock the gladiator off the platform
before he knocks you off), and "Gauntlet"
(try to get by the gladiators as they smash you
with various foam-filled shapes). You can
cheer for the everyman or root for your fa
vorite of the gladiators. The female gladiators
include Crush, Venom and Fury (as opposed
to the original lady-gladiators who had names
like Gold and Lace); the male gladiators have
equally terror-inspiring names such as Jus
tice, Mayhem and Militia. Hosts Hulk Hogan
and Laila Ali add a touch of serious badass.
The entertaining show also allows ample
room for entertaining your own dreams of
besting the gladiators — and if you're seri
ous, you can always fill out an application!
Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
For those of you who haven't seen "Termina
tor" 1 or 2. the robots want Sarah Connor
dead because her son will one day grow up to
lead the human resistance against them. (Inci
dentally, at some point, the robots have in
deed taken over.) This new show, Mondays
on Fox, is set after "Terminator 2" and before
"Terminator 3," and Sarah (played by Lena

Headey) and her adolescent son John
(Thomas Dekker) are just trying to stay alive,
evade the robots from the future who want to
terminate them, and hopefully prevent the
rise of the machines. Either fortunately or un
fortunately, depending on your point of view,
instead of sending a future governor robot
back in time as protection, the human alliance
has sent back a lithe young robo-babe.
