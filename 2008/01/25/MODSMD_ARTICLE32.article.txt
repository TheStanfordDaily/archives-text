# OSCAR OPENING MONOLOGUE
## 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION BANTERER 
So, uh, hey there everybody. (Wave at audience. Wait for audience
to wave back.) No, uh, no takers, huh? Well that's — that's — mmm....
1... OK. OK.
You, uh, may have heard — no writers this time. This isn't so great
— not so good for us — but, you know, show must go on, right? Yeah?
1 don't know. OK.
IT'S OSCARS TIME!
Yessir.
So what we have here are — you, I'm talking about you (sweeping
gesture to audience) — is a bunch of really important industry mem
bers of uh... members of what you might call a bright collection of a sit
uation should I say that, uh... no, wait, let me start that over.
Let me — I should start out with — stop me if you've heard this
one: so there's this plane, right? And it's lost both engines and is going
to crash. And on board are a Mexican guy, a Polish guy and a Chinese
guy. And the Mexican guy takes out a bottle of tequila, OK? And he
so he takes a big swig, you know, like they — oh, hold on a sec, guys,
I'm getting some sort of signal from offstage. It's a funny — No? Hey,
your call.
Anyone know any songs? "Hard times you had before you/1 knew
when I first saw y0u..." Nobody? Really? I guess they never really — I
mean, have you guys heard of Asia? The band, I mean. That was pret
ty much all I listened to in college. If anyone has a guitar, I can... any
body bring a guitar? Oh, come on.
All right, I'm gonna try a different tack, here. Webster's, uh... (pull
out dictionary from behind podium) Webster's defines "Oscars" as, let
me see. here. It doesn't, um, seem to — it's not in here, but it says,
lessee, "academy" means.... "a school usually above the elementary
1eve1..." no, that's not right. "Award": "something that is conferred or
bestowed especially on the basis of merit or need." There we go. Ex
actly. "On the basis of merit or need." That's what the true meaning of
"award" is. And, in a way, that's what we're doing right here, however
many hundreds of years after the fact. Awarding. Just like the ancient
Romans, when they put together the Olympic games and made every
one naked.
How about that "Gladiator," huh? I'd give that movie an Academy
Award or two.
So there's something really, really great about all of us just standing
on a stage in front of cameras and a bunch of people in — is that?
That's the exact same tux I'm wearing. That is so weird.
But the point is. what I'm trying to get at. although I keep getting

off-point — off-topic... uh, off-message... what it all boils
down to is that it's not about the movies. It's — no, it is about
the movies. I always fuck that one up.
Oh, shit, did I — ?

I've heard the Oscars don't actually go out live to most of
the U.S. — is that true?
It's not?
Sorry.

OK, back on track. I've always felt that there's something
beautiful about celebrating the film industry. I — it's a lot of
glitz and glitter, there's a lot of superficiality — we can see that
occasionally the heart of it is, is, is obscured by money and petty
squabbles, but something we can take away from this is the art
that is the — the soul of the whole business. And when we think

about that, really think about that, I think we can all look at our
selves in the mirror and — hey, it is surprisingly easy to ,

just talk up here! I mean, I'm just stringing togeth
er words like nobody's business! It doesn't even
have to make sense — I mean, watch this:

lalalalalalabwadaloodalay bedajibbachep
waydelee hup blup pluppity. This is great!
(Wave arms floppily.) Shoobity habbitala bud
dagudda sicsicsicsisc dikkity beeeeeeeey
oooooooooooop.

Oh, OK, something's blinking, now
that's — what's that? Shout louder, you
in the catwalk — look, I can't hear you,
I've got base #2 in my ears. "Ime?"
What the hell, does that mean? Oh,
time. Time! Haha, all right, everybody,
let's give the techie up on the catwalks a
round of applause. Good going, techie.

Now, this is the moment you've really

been waiting patiently for, and thank you for that.

except for all the people who left and that one guy who's giving

r i 1 — c jo —C 7
me the stinkeye. Is that Ving Rhames? No, it's some other black guy.
Samuel L. Jackson? No? Sidney Poitier? I don't know, maybe he's
some kind of Asian. What? I can't see from up here.

In any case — this is the show we have for you tonight — we've got
some nominees — out of those nominees, some people will probably
win. etc... 1 have no idea how to, uh, how to end this thing... Hey, Ricky!
Ricky! How do 1 end this thing?
I'm gonna go smoke a Dutchie.

So, uh, hey there everybody. (Wave at audience. Wait for audience
to wave back.) No, uh, no takers, huh? Well that's — that's — mmm....
1... OK. OK.
