# 2008 Oscar Predictions
## 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION WINNER 
The Oscars arc going to happen on February 24. The Oscars are
going to happen on February 24. Keep repeating this to yourself, de
spite the disturbing flutters that the Oscars will not be happening this
year, February 24 or not. After all. if the show managed to go on
through WWII, Vietnam and Kevin Costner's Best Picture win for
Dancing With Wolves, no way will the Academy let the writers'
strike deny them of glitz, Fiollywood politics and borrowed jewels.
If nothing else, the nominations for this year are a testament to the
industry's many strengths — writing definitely among them. Nomi
nees in the major categories prove what a muscular bunch of origi
nal, diverse films came out in 2007. Miramax has the most reason to
be happy: No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood rockcd
the Academy with a staggering eight nominations apiece, while the
much-touted and frankly old-ladyish Atonement was basically
snubbed. These are good signs. 4 J
So check out these unofficial, completely biased predictions for
who will take home the awards in the big six categories, and make
yourself some cash in an Oscar pool on February 24. Which, if you
haven't heard, is the date on which the Oscars most assuredly will
happen.
Best Actor in a Leading Role
The nominees: George Clooney ("Michael Clayton"). Daniel Day-
Lewis ("There Will Be Blood"). Johnny Depp ("Sweeny Todd"),
Tommy Lee Jones ("In the Valley of Elah"), Viggo Mortensen
("Eastern Promises")
The standout: Smart money is always on Daniel Day-Lewis. He has
only filmed four movies in the past decade, a testament to perfection
ism and careful script picking in these days of grab and go celebrity.
("The Shaggy Dog," Robert Downey, Jr? No one needs drug money
that badly.) And his performance in "Blood" is pure powerhouse: he
owns the screen with a convincing, breathtaking performance.
George Clooney turned out an intelligent performance in "Clayton,"
but no one wants to risk him giving another bloated acceptance
speech; Johnny Depp has turned out several incredible perfor
mances over the years and is due to be recognized by the Academy.
But not this year. It's all about Daniel Day-Lewis.
Best Actress in a Leading Kole
The nominees: Cate Blanchett ("Elizabeth: The Golden Age"), Julie
Christie ("Away From Her"), Marion Cotillard ("La Vie en Rose"),
Ellen Page ("Juno"), Laura Linney ("The Savages")
The standout: Bring me an old actress and a young actress... Despite
stellar performances all around in this category, the front-runners arc
Julie Christie and Ellen Page. Christie has already taken the Golden
Globe and Critics Choice Award for her subtle performance of a
woman suffering from Alzheimer's; plus, she's a venerable Holly
wood legend who in all likelihood is never going to turn out such an
excellent performance again. Then again, the Academy has a pen
chant for doling out nominations and occasionally wins for both very
young women and acting roles in comedies — in a year of somewhat
eccentric nominations (no Keira Knightley!) Page might benefit
from the pro-comedy furor sparked by "Little Miss Sunshine" last
year. Still, I'm going to tip the odds to Christie: when you get down to
it, the Academy are a bunch of sentimental old fools, and that's what
we love them for.
Best Adapted Screenplay
The nominees: "Atonement," "Away From Her." "The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly," "No Country for Old Men," "There Will Be
Blood"
The standout: After years of Oscar films adapted from television
shows and other films, we finally achieve a quasi-literary renaissance
in the category. Atonement, based on the lan McEwan Booker
shortlisted novel, was adapted very closely from the original work;
while this made for lots of pithy, well wrought dialogue, the movie

still preserves a few of the hooks structural is
sues. "Away From Her" is hased on an Alice
Munro short story and "There Will Be
Blood" is rather loosely structured on an
Upton Sinclair novel. But 1 predict the win
ner will be the Coen Brothers highly de
serving "No Country For Old Men,"
based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of
the same name. McCarthy is hot shit
right now (thanks to the Oprah Book
Club and, less influentially, his
Pulitzer) and the Coens are known for
their brilliant, incisive dialogue.

Best Original Screenplay
The nominees: '"Juno," "Lars and the
ftcai GirLX "MichAel Clayton," "Rata
touille," "The Savages"

The standout: The screcnplay categories are
where the Acadciift historically likes to reward
independent corrflnics ("Little Miss Sunshine,"
"Sideways"), and There has been no more buzzed-

about screenplay this year than Diablo Cody's "Juno." It
captures the bizarre-fantastic play of the indie teenage acid
tongue: it made the doddering old fools in the Academy
chuckle all the way to a Best Picture nod; everyone I know
has been quoting it for weeks now. "Michael Clayton" and
"The Savages" both had solid scripts, but I'll cat my ham
burger phone if Juno doesn't waddle home with the gold.

Best Director
The nominees: Julian Schnabel ("The Diving Bell and
the Butterfly"), Jason Reitman ("Juno"), Tony Gilroy
("Michael Clayton"), the Coen Brothers ("No Coun
try for Old Men"), PT Anderson ("There Will Be
Blood")
The standout: Did anyone think PI Anderson could
ever recover from "Punch Drunk Love," let alone with
a movie of the caliber of "There Will Be Blood." He is
the Coen Brothers' big competition right now, but I sus
pect t he movie was too single-performance-based to garner
the laurels in this important category. "Clayton" in a weaker
year would be a hotter contender; Schnabel and Reitman
should be happy to be nominated. But the award will more
than likely go to the Coen Brothers who, both in this film
and over the years, have proven that they have a strange
wonderful dream and know how to get every last drop
out of their actors.

Best Picture
The nominees: "Atonement," "Michael Clayton,"
"No Country for Old Men," "There Will Be
Blood," "Juno"
The standout: Not quite sure how "Atonement"
crept in here: no film since "Return of the King"
has won Best Picture without a single acting nom
ination, and, god willing, it won't happen again.
"Michael Clayton" was good but not quite strong
enough this year. I predict a victory by "There Will
Be Blood" in this category — the competition this
year is fierce, making it a prime situation for a Direc
tor/Picture split. And when you get right down to it,
"There Will Be Blood" is exactly the kind of sprawl
ing, meaty film that our grandchildren will still be
watching long after the days of DVD. Talent like that
can't go unrewarded. Still, if "Juno" somehow sneaks
past the anti-comedy odds and takes the big award, then
Oscar pools be damned, champagne's on me.
