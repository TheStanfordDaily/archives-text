## "Black Comedy" lights up the stage 
### JANET KIM INTERMISSION ILLUMINATI 
"Black Comedy," directed by Juan Batiz-Benet '10
and produced by the Asian American Theater Project,
is an elegant but delightfully light British sex farce. In a
dramatic break from the philosophical, soul-bruising
Serious Plays that most Stanford theater tends to
wards, "Black Comedy" is a digestible, easy pleasure
that features fierce acting talent and self-sacrificial
physical comedy.
The play is set in a flat in Britain sometime in the
late 1960s or early 19705. The scheming Brindsley
Miller (Brandon Silberstein '08) is a sculptor with a
burning desire to climb the social ladder and a ton of
bad karma. In preparation for a wealthy art connois
seur's visit to his flat, he refurnishes his shabby envi
rons with furniture discreetly "borrowed" from his
next-door neighbor and makes his high-society fiancd,
Carol Melkett (Lauren Hayes '08) an accomplice to his
crime; Carol plays along because her bellowing, hard
to-please military-man father is also due to visit that
day. On the brink of the big night, however, the main
fuse in Brindsley's apartment blows out. and one by
one, a host of guests, each unwelcome for a different
reason, descends upon the darkened flat.
The conceit of the play is brilliant: the lighting of
the stage is inversely proportional to the amount of
light in the reality of the play, and said stage is only il
luminated when the dramatic black-out occurs. Be
yond the obvious philosophical, meta-visual messages
that can be derived from this particular use of light —
we are illuminated by the actions we undertake when
nobody can see us! Preoccupation with literal vision
impedes deeper, less literal vision! — the set-up al
lows for a hefty dose of physical comedy as the actors
stumble, grope, twist and sneak around the stage to
varying degrees of success.
Although Peter Shaffer's writing is screamingly
funny at times and the chic, minimalist set is beautiful
ly assembled, the real reason to brave the rain and the
cold lies in the top-notch ensemble. The acting chem
istry is not perfect — there are seven characters al
most constantly onstage, and in a few parts the actors
on the periphery can't seem to mask their boredom —
but on the whole the actors are very good at grasping
the bold, over-exaggerated strokes in which Shaffer's
characters are drawn. The acting becomes especially
good as the clashes between the characters intensify
and the audience is permitted to see how much of a
scoundrel Brindsley actually is: I had a fine time
watching Malcolm Loungway '08, in the role of dis
gruntled patriarch Colonel Melkett, transform from a

fine actor into a great one as the Colonel accumulates
more and more rage. Orwell save me from my cliches,
hut it was an epiphany to watch Loungway disappear
under the skin of his character.
Silherstein. as Brindsley, is a marvelously expressive
actor who channels Woody Allen and Jason Bateman in
his role as the quick-speaking, quick-thinking but (ulti
mately) handsomely thwarted anti-hero of the play. Also
notable is his chemistry with Katie Ridley '10, who plays
Clea, Brindsley's long-time lover and Other Woman. Ri
dley has one of the smaller roles in the play, but her pres
ence is verily electric, as she flirts, smooches and foxes her
way into the heart of the play's conflict. I find the tension
between Clea and Carol (Brindsley's dowdy fiance,
played by Lauren Hayes, who is one of the most versatile
actors I have seen at Stanford) to be almost more produc
tive than the tension that is supposed to exist between
Brindsley and Carol. Whereas her charm and comedic
timing are constantly good. Hayes becomes a fuller char
acter in the latter half of the play as she storms around
stage unleashing the rage of a woman scorned.
It's hard to distinguish between leads and supporting
actors in this play (because everybody is almost constant
ly onstage), which is perhaps fitting because the support
ing cast by and large gives noteworthy performances.
Rico Roque '09 is excellent as the flamboyant, sugges
tive, emotional Harold (from whom Brindsley borrows
his furniture) and maybe some audience members will
join me in mourning the fact that the charming Cameron
Poter Ml, who plays a German electrician, was cast in
such a small role.
Sarah Guerrero '11, who plays the elderly, allegedly
abstemious Miss Furnival. is a force to be reckoned with.
(Certainly she is a very tiny force, although maybe it is
still growing — according to some reputable reports,
Guerrero has recently passed the three-foot mark.) In
the interest of full disclosure, this critic must admit that
she has directed Guerrero in this fall's production of The
Pirates of Penzance, but it is her honest opinion that
Guerrero will become a campus legend in good time, if
she is not one already. Her Irish accent and unabashed
physical self-sacrifice make her an energetic and eagerly
observed stage presence, and a few directorial touches to
make her character a little naughtier than intended reap
great returns.
Overall, this is a play I feel comfortable recommend
ing to friends who have suffered through entire weeks of
dead white men dictating the terms of the world, pre-med
headaches and the bad weather; it is smart enough with
out being suffocatingly meaningful, funny enough with
out being grotesque. It is a racy comedy of errors and a
minefield of explosive acting talent, a remedy for these
gray days.
