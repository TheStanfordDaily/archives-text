# "WIZ" WOWS
## 
### CHELSEY LITTLE INTERMISSION TWISTER 
As the rain lightly sprinkled on the roof overhead, 1 entered Roble
Studio Theatre, brushing the drops that had accumulated off my jacket,
anxious to see what was promised to be a very entertaining preview of
Stanford's Blackstage production of "The Wiz," Ken Harper's 1975 mu
sical rendition of Frank L. Baum's take on "The Wonderful Wizard of
Oz." Walking by the cast as they received the usual pre-performance
pep-talk, I caught the smiles on their faces and saw the gleam in their
eyes, and 1 knew this was going to be a fun evening.

A voice over the loudspeaker began: "We're starting in three minutes

— you have three minutes." The bleachers beneath me rumbled as the
actors assumed their positions backstage. Actresses tested out their voic
es, giggles and whispers silenced and the anticipation that settles over the
entire vicinity when a show is about to begin came over all those present.
Places were called, and the music began.

What followed was nothing less than charming. With a brightly
colored stage and wide array of eye-catching costumes, the

Land of Oz as captured by co-directors Gabby Randle and
Tracy Oliver is occupied by the most likable of characters.
| From the delightful Dorothy and her traipsing trio to the
[ wicked and good witches of here and there, every actor
onstage played his or her role well. Probably most appeal
ing aspect of the production is the vocal talents of each of

the actors. Every single song sung is done

masterfully, with soul and feeling
unmatched by some student pro
ductions.
Along with the fantastic vocal
stylings is the incredible amount of
energy and "umph" each character
brought to the stage. Arguably,

some brought more than others, hut
as a whole, the ensemble had a vibrant

energy that is essential for an effective
musical. The challenge of performing such a

piece on a thrust stage was also met very

well by the directors and the cast
as. even sitting on the side of the

audience, one has a dynamic view of
the action onstage.

If you are looking for a show that
will satisfy vou needs for laughter, good-feel-

ings and pleasant tunes, then 1 highly recom
mend you go and see "The Wiz"!
