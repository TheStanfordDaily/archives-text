## Go HOME. 
### JANET KIM RUTH McCANN INTERMISSION HOMEBODIES 
This week. Intermission went Hollywood, so Janet and
Ruth went Home. By which we mean a restaurant called
Home. And although the name might conjure up suburban
images of domestic boredom, this San Francisco culinary des
tination isn't your Momma's diner. It is, in fact, nothing short
of a glammed-up Castro institution that houses enough glam
our to flood the spacious pages of Intermission.
Following a hot tip from a blonde smartie who knows her
SF gourmet scene, we trekked off campus this weekend in
hopes of expanding our already broad dining horizons. Sick
and bloody tired of Sushi Tomo and other University Ave. in
stitutions, we were willing to endure even the miseries of the
CalTrain in order to escape Palo Alto for our weekly culinary
fix. After taking endless public transportation, for which we
bought strangely shaped tickets that no one ever collected or

checked, we arrived Home.
You can't miss Home. At 2100 Market Street, the restau
rant sits right in the middle of a big intersection (Church and
Market). And as if the location didn't make Home visible
enough, the restaurant's roof is adorned with a large red neon
sign that emphatically announces Home's presence. If the
name "Home" makes you think Stepford Wives or Easy Bake
or even Laura Ingalls Wilder, you're sure to be persuaded oth-

erwise by the restaurant's publicity material, all of which con
tains a picture of Home's mascot — a fabulous tranny Lucille
Ball in full makeup and pearls, blowing a kiss straight at

you — yes, you, sweetheart.
Needless to say, Home welcomes all our brothers
and sisters, if you know what we mean. You know

what we mean. Let's just say it's in the middle of
The Castro, and it seems to be a neighborhood
institution. And Home certainly deserves its

stellar reputation: the food is quick and afford-

able, the menu consists of cre-

ative twists on old favorites and
the whole place feels like a party

you didn't know you were invited to,
but now you're here, and you might
not know anyone, but dammit, every
one is going to have fun. Smiles are
thrown around liberally from cus
tomer to waitress to bartender to cus
tomer, and it's impossible not to fall
victim to the restaurant's contagious
high spirits.

or
Home serves dinner from 5 p.m. until
midnight, seven days a week, with the

addition of weekend brunches from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (we suspect said
brunches to be heavy on the
Bloody Marys).

Given

Home's late week-night hours, the restaurant is something of
a hot spot — the bar is lively and busy, and Home also offers
an outdoor patio for parties, dining, etc. We caught a Friday
night dinner at around 10, and even though it was past every
good little girl's bedtime, there were quite a few naughty girls
and boys entrenched at Home's chic bar, in their diner-style
booths and at their tables. Consequently, we waited about 10

minutes for seats, but the maitre d' was so charming that we

didn't mind.

Janet was hungry, and
Ruth was feeling

' picky, but we were
both delighted by the
menu, which is short but

well-constructed.
Home's general concept
is "comfort food," which

r doesn't mean that the
dishes are unsophisticat
ed, because they are, and it
also doesn't mean that the

restaurant isn't vegetarian
and/or diet-friendly, be
cause it is. It just means
that if you come Home

craving some soul food,
you'll get it in generous (and
caloric) portions, but with a
twist. Instead of serving

pr* *•'
sloppy Joes, for example.
Home offers sloppy Joe dip with

com chips, sour cream and red
. onions as part of the appetiz-

er menu. And speaking

of appetizers...
We started

onion soup and
duck/vegetable

spring rolls with chili dip
ping sauce. Each dish was
about $8, which we deem
entirely reasonable, espe-

cially because it's The City,
where prices are not low. The

soup was all that French
onion soup can ever hope to
be: salty, tongue-burningly
hot,and swathed in perfectly
melted cheese. And then
there were the duck/veg
spring rolls, which were sin
fully fried and rapidly con
sumed. Other available appe
tizers include tomato soup,
mussels and a Mediterranean
plate. Not a traditional re
creation of soul food, but it's
the sort of quirky, indulgent
fare that, we imagine, appeals
to San Franciscan souls, not
to mention ours.
Ever the pious one. Ruth
ordered the Cobb salad for
her entree, and Janet coun
tered with the flat iron steak,
accompanied by French fries
and red wine butter. The
Cobb was chosen from a
