## Who loves ya, babies? 
### CHELSEY LITTLE INTERMISSION CRADLE ROBBER 
Babies are everywhere these days. You sim
ply can't get away from them, no matter how
hard you try. They're crowding you on the sub
ways, taking up large amounts of space with
their strollers and getting their snot all over you
when they cry. Why, even my sister back in
Austin, Texas, is having a baby. It's kind of
ridiculous. But what is even more ridiculous is
our current obsession with these miniature hu
mans. We just can't seem to get enough of
them. Everything in our being cries out. "More
babies! MORE!" Every magazine we read,
every online blog that pops up in our Web
browser — even our local weekly Intermission
is mentioning babies.
Celebrities are reproducing, and their
spawn are so ridiculously, ridiculously good
looking that their powers are mounting faster
than you can say "Who's your baby's daddy?"
And these babies are hot stuff. These babies
take being a baby to the next level. They are
super-star babies, rising high and sparkling
bright in the limelight that is the never-ending
hazy glow of flashing neon bulbs and signs. It is
these celebrity babies that really leave us crav
ing more.
Now why is it, some of you may wonder?
Why is there such a cult-like obsession with
these proverbial pre-pre-pubescents? For
some, the answer to that question is clear.
They're cute. And stylish too. Whether they are
adopted or not, babies are definitely what's
"in." Maybe this has something to do with the
human race's propensity to increase their fit
ness via reproduction. Or maybe it has some
thing to do with the fact that being pregnant
gives you an excuse to look less than your best.

More than likely, though, it is probably the fact
that baby clothes are just so fun to look at, and
what could be better than a real live doll to
dress up and coo at?
Of course, there is the inevitable side effect
of having to clean off their butts every time the
do the doo, but you can always get someone
else to take care of that last bit. Especially if
vou re a celebrity. Indeed, as a celebrity, it ap
pears that it is your God-given task to populate
the planet with beautiful people. Just look at
the outrageous amount of adorableness that
can be supplied by such celebrity offspring as
Violet Affleck (daughter of the gorgeous duo
Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner). Gwen Ste
fani's little one Kingston Rossdale and every
one's favorite little scientologist, Suri Cruise.
Man oh man, do they make their parents' pa
parazzi points sky-rocket! Nothing says photo
genic like a having a little copy of you by your
side.
But if you take a step back and give yourself
a chance to actually analyze this line of think
ing, this obsession with celebrity babies is kind
of disturbing. I mean, sure, they're cute, but
geez louise. do there really need to be 50 plus
celebrity baby blogs detailing the comings and
goings of each and every famous couple that
has a child? Now don't get me wrong, I'm not
one of those people who is out to save the beau
tiful people from the exploitation of photo-fre
netic individuals who have nothing better to do
with their lives than take snapshots of people
with such lofty stature — no, not at all. I think
when these kids get into the entertainment
business they have to realize they are taking the
glam with the glum, the good with the bad. But
to put all this pressure on kids who have no clue
who they are, or why their parents are given the
status of a divinity to to be worshiped by the

masses, to expose these kids to this kind of
lifestyle is just upsetting. They're babies — pre
cious, tiny beings that shouldn't have to deal
with all that fecal matter.
Believe it or not, and as lame and corny as it
sounds, celebrities really are just people, like
the rest of us. Their babies are no more baby
tastic than ours, so we just should just let up on
the baby craze. And if celebrities and their off
spring continue to have such an elevated status,
it is the consumer's fault. America is messed up
in that way, but what can you do? Keep on

keeping on and take your

r o — j
place in the midst of it all.
Remember, complacency
is key when it comes to

changing society. And
writing snarky arti
cles about celebrity

babies and using
them to get on your
high-horse, ranting
and raving about

the absurdity of
current cul-

ture helps
too. Yeah.
