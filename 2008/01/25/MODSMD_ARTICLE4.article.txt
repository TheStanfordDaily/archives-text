# Cal closing in fast
## No. 7 Stanford women to host No. 8 Bears in battle for Pac-10's best 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Pac-10 bragging rights and a pair
of top 10 national rankings will both
be at stake Saturday at 2 p.m. when
the No. 8 California women's basket
ball team visits the Farm to face No. 7
Stanford.
The Golden Bears (17-2,8-0 Pac
-10) may be the last team in the league
still undefeated in conference play,
but the Cardinal (16-3, 6-2 Pac-10)
has bounced back from its consecu
tive losses to USC and UCLA in Jan
uary, eager to prove that the road to
the Pac-10 title still runs through
Palo Alto.
"It's like a tournament atmos
phere," said Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer. "There is a certain ex
citement when something is on the
line."
The Cardinal squad certainly
proved that it could win its rivalry
games this past weekend. Down 30-
20 at halftime to Arizona State, Stan
ford righted itself as soon as the sec
ond half began and left as 60-56 vic
tors.
The confidence and momentum
gathered from that win is very impor
tant to VanDerveer and her players
coming into this weekend's key
matchup.
"We know that to have a shot at
the Pac-10 regular season title, we
need to win this game," VanDerveer
said. "You've got to come out and do
something special."
Stanford's three-headed monster
of a senior guard Candice Wiggins
(17.6 points per game), sophomore
center Jayne Appel (15.6 points per
game) and freshman forward Kayla
Pedersen (12.4 points per game) will

continue to drive the offense. The
trio has scored just under 60 percent
of the Cardinal's points this season.
That number climbs when the
Cardinal's blowout victories — in
which Stanford's stars took more rest
— are discounted. In the Cardinal's
close games — contests decided by
10 points or fewer — Wiggins, Appel
and Pedersen are scoring almost 72

percent of the team's points.
Wiggins and Appel went off in
Stanford's last meeting with the
Bears in Berkeley in 2007. Wiggins
scorched the Bears from outside, hit
ting six three-pointers for 18 points,
while Appel rode 8-for-15 shooting
to 19 points in 25 minutes of playing
time.
California presents an interesting
matchup for Stanford, as one of the
only teams in the country that can
throw two premier post players at
the Cardinal's elite inside duo of
Appel and Pedersen.
Junior center Ashley Walker
leads the Bears in both scoring and
rebounding, with 16.6 points per
game and 9.6 rebounds per game.
Walker's rebounding average is the
best in the Pac-10,Fellow junior post
Devanei Hampton — last year's
Pac-10 Player of the Year — missed
part of the season with an injury but
has returned to average 13.5 points
and 6.7 rebounds per game.
The two, along with point guard
Alexis Gray-Lawson, are primarily
responsible for California's highest
ever ranking in the latest national
polls. Gray-Lawson missed last
year's game against Stanford after
injuring her knee.
Last season, California came to
Maples Pavilion and spoiled Stan
ford's then-perfect Pac-10 record.
There is no talk of revenge coming
out of the Stanford camp, but the role
reversal this time around is apparent
to the Cardinal.
"In some ways it's more fun chas
ing," VanDerveer said. "It's going to
be a challenging game."

NOTES: The No. 7 Stanford women play
host to No. 8 Cal Saturday in a match-up
that will certainly have a great deal to say
about conference standings. The Cardinal
has bounced bock marvelously following a
two game sweep suffered in Los Angeles
early this month, but now faces its most for
midable opponent since those losses. The
Cal women are led by a trio of players av
eraging double-digits in points — Devanei
Hampton and Ashley Walker fill the post as
Alexis Gray-Lawson plays pointguard.
