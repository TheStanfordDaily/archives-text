## Fabulous Formal Frocks 
### MILDRED DRESSMONGER INTERMISSION MARAUDER 
Now that the annual Stanford fancy-dress season is rolling around
(such as it is) with the usual Greek and class formals. the age-old question

conies up: what's a girl to wear? This question is both the joy and

bane of my existence, and to answer it I slip on my H&M

stiletto-heeled ankle boots and, carryall in hand, totter

over to the Stanford Mall. It may not be the most ex
citing of shopping centers, but it has a Neiman Mar-

cus and, for the moment, that will have to do.
First stop is a courtesy call to Nordstrom. As

a store it tends to be below my radar, but when I do
happen through its doors I always find at least one
item worth the trip. Today it's the 3.1 Phillip Lim
Multifold Tank Dress ($350). Lim, a San Francis
co native, has garnered more than a page or two in
Vogue for his easy, elegant creations, and this one

has Lim's signature style written all over it. In di
aphanous grey linen, it falls in wide rings to mid
thigh. its neckline scooped low for a flattering
decolletage. Cute, but maybe not the right thing
for a formal, unless you're the kind of girl who
likes to run laps on the dance floor.

On my way out, a flash of gold catches my
eye: it's the D&G Dolce & Gabbana Gilded
Lace Camisole Dress ($545), strapless and glit
tering in regal gold-printed splendor with a black
leather band around the waist. It falls to mid
thigh as well, but somehow it doesn't seem so in
formal. Instead, with its gentle flare at the waist.

it seems ideal to flatter the hips: a dress that's
good-looking, attention-getting and not too
stuffy, all in one.
Next 1 hoof it over to Bloomingdale's, where

1 encounter the Laundry by Design Strapless
Charmeusc Dress ($295), strapless, with a sweet
heart neckline and a cascade of black silk pour
ing down the front. I think it looks lovely on me,
and although it's floor-length it doesn't come

off as too theatrical or self-important. I swish
around in front of the dressing-room mirror,
admiring the way the fabric flows. Ultimately
it goes back on the rack, but I make a mental
note to come back for it.

On to Neiman Marcus. I dodge the cosmetics
ladies and sales associates who circle, protec
tively. over the racks (why don't employees in
big department stores ever seem to like me?

Maybe it's because 1 don't buy until things go
on sale) until I find a selection of evening attire.
The first thing I sec is a blood-red Valentino
gown, off-the-shoulder, its hem sweeping the

floor and an order of
magnitude out of my
price range ($7,650).

Not the kind of dress
you can wear unless
you happen to have a
de or a von in your

name.
I shy away and find myself
looking at a frock by Yves
Saint Laurent. A gentle, non-girly
pink, it seems loose and comfort-

able at the top and pleasantly
swishy at the bottom, where it
grazes the knee. Though at $1,674
it's still a bit much for me, 1 can't help
but think how understated yet com
pletely elegant anyone would look in

it, next to their overdressed friends.
I sweep out the doors, resisting the
temptation to stop for a tiered black
and-red gown by Jean-Paul Gaultier
($3,520) which is simultaneously so-

phisticated and haute, but at the same
time young enough for a 20-year-old. It
is, I think, a very mature dress, both old
and young, unlike some of the sales-

women, who give me the evil eye on my
way out. No victory today, perhaps, but
a trunk full of good finds.
That weekend 1 beg a ride from a j
friend up to the city and make it
over to the new Barneys New York,
off Union Square. It's like Christ-

mas came early, or, more accurately, like it's just gone by:
the store is still clearing out it's glut of holiday season
merchandise, and there are goodies for all.

First on my list is a green Kate Moss for Topshop dress which leaves
one shoulder bare and descends to the knee in a sea of pleats and ruffles
($335, discounted to $169). 1 don't know if I'd look like Artemis if I wore
it to a formal, but I don't particularly care. It's a keeper.
Then I see a 3.1 Phillip Lim midnight-blue cocoon dress with a ruffled
collar. Like seemingly everything else I like it's only to the knee, but
somehow it looks grown-up enough that it wouldn't be inappropriate at a
formal. At $239, down from $419, it's nearly too good to miss. I have a vi
sion of myself wearing it with black leggings and pumps — who says dark
blue and black don't go together? Phillip Lim finally scores.
