LIFE AFTER STANFORD-career options beyond the obvious
By Espie Santiago, Career Counselor
Stanford is a Mecca of information, key leaders, faculty, and
staff that can lead a student to many opportunities. The
Career Development Center (CDC), in particular can help
you explore career options beyond the obvious.
KNOW YOURSELF
The key to determining the career path you'd truly like to pur
sue is finding an environment that best suits you. This starts
with the ability to answer such questions as: What do I love
to do? What motivates me? What am I good at? What are
my personality traits? A CDC career counselor can work
with you to help you increase your self-knowledge and
expand your list of career options through individual counsel
ing appointments and self-assessment tools.
The CDC offers the following: the Strong Interest Inventory,
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Personality), the Campbell
Interest and Skill Survey, as well as Skills, Values, and Career
Card Sorts.
RESEARCH YOUR OPTIONS
After creating a list of career options, it's vital that you spend
time researching what it takes to enter these career paths, get
a sense of what the work is like, and the common job titles
associated with the fields that interest you. The CDC has
hundreds of books and resources in its library to help you do
your research, as well as a compilation of Web resources:
cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/research/exploring.htm.
To complement your print and online research, talking with
alumni, professionals, and faculty to hear the "inside scoop"
on various careers is vital. Experts can be found through the
Stanford Career Network, stanfordalumni.org/career/scn and
by attending events such as the upcoming Stanford Career
Week, February 4 - February 9. Additionally, the CDC main
tains a Shadow Program that allows students to spend a day
on the job with a professional,
cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/shadow.
Joining a professional or student association related to your
interests is another way to gain knowledge about specific
fields: mygroups.stanford.edu/search.
Lastly, participating in an internship is probably the best way
to gain exposure to a career path. Some key internship
search tools include:
• Cardinal Careers Jobs & Internship Database
• Career Fairs
• CDC Internship Network
• CDC Links Database

• CDC Resource Library's Collection of Internship Books and
Online Databases
For links to the resources above and for more tips on finding
an internship visit: cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/internships.
PREPARE FOR AND EXECUTE THE JOB SEARCH
Once you have completed your self-assessment and per
formed the research to determine the type of jobs you'd like
to pursue, then it's time to prepare for the job search. To
properly prepare, you will need to make sure your resume
and cover letter are in tip-top shape.
But what is the best job search strategy? The most successful
searches include some of each strategy:
• Cardinal Careers Jobs & Internship Database and other
sites
• Contacting Organizations Directly
• Career Fairs
• Cardinal Recruiting (on-campus interviews)
• Neiworking-the most successful job search strategy!
For each specific job you are applying for, you will need to
adjust your resume and cover letter accordingly. Additionally,
you will need to have a list of references that can speak
favorably on your behalf. And you'll also have to prepare for
your interviews.
For more information on the job search, visit cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/jobsearch/strategies.
In general, you will find that the career search process is not
a one-time event that occurs when you graduate, but a
dynamic on-going process of career development as you
learn and respond to change, within yourself and in the
organizations with which you work.
For more information on any of the resources mentioned or
to schedule a career counseling appointment, please call
(650) 725-1789. Visit the CDC at 563 Salvatierra Walk
(across from the Haas Center) and on the Web at cardinal
careers. sta nford.edu.

But what is the best job search strategy? The most successful
searches include some of each strategy:
• Cardinal Careers Jobs & Internship Database and other
sites
• Contacting Organizations Directly
• Career Fairs
• Cardinal Recruiting (on-campus interviews)
• Neiworking-the most successful job search strategy!
For each specific job you are applying for, you will need to
adjust your resume and cover letter accordingly. Additionally,
you will need to have a list of references that can speak
favorably on your behalf. And you'll also have to prepare for
your interviews.
For more information on the job search, visit cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/jobsearch/strategies.
In general, you will find that the career search process is not
a one-time event that occurs when you graduate, but a
dynamic on-going process of career development as you
learn and respond to change, within yourself and in the
organizations with which you work.

to schedule a career counseling appointment, please call

LIFE AFTER STANFORD-career options beyond the obvious
By Espie Santiago, Career Counselor
Stanford is a Mecca of information, key leaders, faculty, and
staff that can lead a student to many opportunities. The
Career Development Center (CDC), in particular can help
you explore career options beyond the obvious.
KNOW YOURSELF
The key to determining the career path you'd truly like to pur
sue is finding an environment that best suits you. This starts
with the ability to answer such questions as: What do I love
to do? What motivates me? What am I good at? What are
my personality traits? A CDC career counselor can work
with you to help you increase your self-knowledge and
expand your list of career options through individual counsel
ing appointments and self-assessment tools.
The CDC offers the following: the Strong Interest Inventory,
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Personality), the Campbell
Interest and Skill Survey, as well as Skills, Values, and Career
Card Sorts.
RESEARCH YOUR OPTIONS
After creating a list of career options, it's vital that you spend
time researching what it takes to enter these career paths, get
a sense of what the work is like, and the common job titles
associated with the fields that interest you. The CDC has
hundreds of books and resources in its library to help you do
your research, as well as a compilation of Web resources:
cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/research/exploring.htm.
To complement your print and online research, talking with
alumni, professionals, and faculty to hear the "inside scoop"
on various careers is vital. Experts can be found through the
Stanford Career Network, stanfordalumni.org/career/scn and
by attending events such as the upcoming Stanford Career
Week, February 4 - February 9. Additionally, the CDC main
tains a Shadow Program that allows students to spend a day
on the job with a professional,
cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/shadow.
Joining a professional or student association related to your
interests is another way to gain knowledge about specific
fields: mygroups.stanford.edu/search.
Lastly, participating in an internship is probably the best way
to gain exposure to a career path. Some key internship
search tools include:
• Cardinal Careers Jobs & Internship Database
• Career Fairs
• CDC Internship Network
• CDC Links Database

• CDC Resource Library's Collection of Internship Books and
Online Databases
For links to the resources above and for more tips on finding
an internship visit: cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/internships.
PREPARE FOR AND EXECUTE THE JOB SEARCH
Once you have completed your self-assessment and per
formed the research to determine the type of jobs you'd like
to pursue, then it's time to prepare for the job search. To
properly prepare, you will need to make sure your resume
and cover letter are in tip-top shape.
But what is the best job search strategy? The most successful
searches include some of each strategy:
• Cardinal Careers Jobs & Internship Database and other
sites
• Contacting Organizations Directly
• Career Fairs
• Cardinal Recruiting (on-campus interviews)
• Neiworking-the most successful job search strategy!
For each specific job you are applying for, you will need to
adjust your resume and cover letter accordingly. Additionally,
you will need to have a list of references that can speak
favorably on your behalf. And you'll also have to prepare for
your interviews.
For more information on the job search, visit cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/jobsearch/strategies.
In general, you will find that the career search process is not
a one-time event that occurs when you graduate, but a
dynamic on-going process of career development as you
learn and respond to change, within yourself and in the
organizations with which you work.
For more information on any of the resources mentioned or
to schedule a career counseling appointment, please call
(650) 725-1789. Visit the CDC at 563 Salvatierra Walk
(across from the Haas Center) and on the Web at cardinal
