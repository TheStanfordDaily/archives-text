groups, including cross-disciplinary ones.
GAINING REAL WORLD KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
Informational Interviews
You can learn more-lots more-about careers and industries
by talking to people in those fields. If your immediate network
doesn't contain engineers in your targeted field, talk to
friends, family, faculty and departmental staff to see who they
know.
Stanford's extensive network of alumni is one of its greatest
resources. You'll find some of the best resources for tapping
into this knowledge base appear under "Networking
Resources" on the CDC homepage. See h' lp://cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/networking/tips/ for tips on expanding
your professional network.
The Stanford Career Network
https://www.stanfordalumni.org/career/scn/home.html
This is a database of thousands of alumni available to
answer your questions and provide career advice; you can
search by major, job function, geographic location and other
criteria.
Stanford inCirde

You can identify and contact Stanford alumni in different pro
fessions and industries via this networking resource and its
discussion groups.
JOB SHADOWING AND EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION
The Shadow Program
http://cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/shadow
Observing first-hand a typical day-in-the-life of a practicing
engineer (or other professional) may provide even more
information about a career, industry or organization than you
can gather during a brief informational interview. This pro
gram is also available under the "Networking Resources"
pull-down menu on the CDC homepage.
Internships

An internship will not only clarify what you want in your
career but also give you practical experience that will make
you a more attractive candidate for your next career step.

ship (though some are available Autumn and Spring quarters
too).
