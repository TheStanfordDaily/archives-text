you a more attractive candidate for your next career step.
Winter quarter is prime season for lining up a summer intern
ship (though some are available Autumn and Spring quarters
too).
Tip: When searching the Cardinal Recruiting internship post
ings, run a separate search for each Position Type


on-campus organizations. Many host speakers or offer infor
mative programs. The first link lists engineering-related orga
nizations at Stanford; the second link lists all other student
("Internship", "Summer Job" and "Temporary") to find the
most opportunities.
iNET Internship Consortium
