# PAID TO PLAY
## 
### 
Though we beg for them as a child, toys might not come to
mind when you think of engineering careers.
Except if you're someone like Shannon Bruzelius. He was
your typical Toys-R-Us kid, playing with everything from action
figures to train sets. "I always thought it would be cool to
work for a toy company."
But Bruzelius didn't begin his career by following this dream.
Instead, he took the well-traveled road of many mechanical
engineers and accepted a position with a utility company
located in Colorado, all the while wondering if he could use
his engineering skills to pursue a career with a toy manufac
turer. After a year, Bruzelius decided to stop wondering and
find out. He resigned from the utility company, packed his
bags and moved to the toy-company hub of Northern
California. "I hadn't talked with anyone there before moving,
but at least I would be in a place where I could be in contact
with [toy companies]," he says.
Once there, Bruzelius worked odd engineering jobs during
the day and sent resumes to area toy companies at night. He
arranged as many informational interviews as he could, hop
ing to gain insight into the toy industry, while putting his name
and face before people who could make a difference in his
job search.
Eventually, his hard work paid off when he met with an engi
neer from Wild Planet Toys. "We talked for a few hours, and I
asked a ton of questions," he explains. "I guess he liked me
enough to keep my name on file, because six months later
he asked me to interview for a [position]."
Today, Bruzelius is surrounded by toys as a project engineer
at Wild Planet Toys in San Francisco, where he's worked
since 1999.
Life on the Job
Getting paid to play may sound too good to be true, but
that's an integral part of Bruzelius' job description. Like other
engineers who test new product designs, Bruzelius has to
make sure that the toys do what they are designed to do,
which just happens to require that he play with them. "I keep
a pair of swim trunks in my desk, because you never know
when you have to go test a water toy," he says.
In addition to a full line of pool toys, such as underwater
radios, Wild Planet produces an array of spy gear, including
sunglasses with hidden cameras and secret messengers.
"There are days when we go wandering the streets of San
Francisco testing walkie-talkies," Bruzelius says.
Much of the engineering work, such as the toy's electronics,
is done at the company's operational sites in Southeast Asia.
So much of his time is devoted to project management,

rather than design work. "Still it's important to have the [tech
nical] background because you make your decisions based
on engineering knowledge."
That background should include a knowledge of materials,
particularly plastics. "When it comes to plastics, you have to
know about the thickness, material characteristics and failure
analysis. You also have to know about molding and the
processes involved in making the parts," Bruzelius explains.
And like other industries in the business of manufacturing
products for the public, production costs and safety are
always concerns. "You may be able to make a toy cheaply,
but how safe is it? Sometimes we just can't do a design
because of the cost or a safety issue."
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
A few years ago, the toy market experienced a significant
downturn. While the industry has since rebounded, it's still
susceptible to market swings, especially when retail is hit
hard. Overall, Bruzelius says it tends to be a fairly consistent
industry.

Toy companies may not hire large numbers of engineers or
computer scientists each year, but there are career opportuni
ties. If getting paid to play with toys appeals to you, Bruzelius
recommends you get to know as much about the toy-making
world as possible by joining industry groups or subscribing to
trade journals. These will keep you informed of industry hap
penings, as well as introduce you to names of people who
are making significant moves. A well-developed network is
key both in the job search and on the job.
"As an engineer you don't have to know everything, but you
do have to know where to find it. If you're trying to find glow
in-the-dark ink, then you have to be able to know where to
get the information."
Although he loves every step along the toy-making process,
the best part of Bruzelius' job is seeing the product on the
shelves. "There's nothing cooler than hearing a kid or mom
say, 'I love that. It's so cool.' That's my toy and I know the
magic behind it."
