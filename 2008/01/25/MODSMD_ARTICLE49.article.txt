# CREATURE CREATION
## 
### 
It's often the magic of how or why something works that
entices people into engineering and computer science. For
Mike Earnest, a native Califomian, that magic came in wanti
ng to understand how Disneyland blended technology and
art. "I virtually grew up in Disneyland and my first experience
with a robot was seeing Abraham Lincoln [in the park's
'Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln']," he explains. "That was
when I realized there was an entertainment aspect to robots."
But what sealed the deal was seeing the movie Star Wars as
a teenager. Earnest and his brother immediately set out to
create their own R2-D2, which was eventually used in a sci
ence-fiction adaptation of Romeo and Juliet for his high
school play. That's when he knew he wanted to work in
entertainment animatronics.
Rather than pursuing an electrical or mechanical engineering
degree in route to his dream job, he chose a theater arts
program. "I found out that John Dykstra, the man who made
the aircraft fly in Star Wars, had gone through a theater arts
program, so that's where I decided to go." But he also knew
that to be a marketable graduate he needed to gain experi
ence in as many aspects of special effects as possible, so he
built a background in electronics, machining, welding and
architecture through classes and working on college theater
productions.
That background eventually led to his first job: building
Chuck E. Cheese restaurant stage creatures in the early '80s.
From there, Earnest became a mechanical designer at a
Southern California toy company, achieving success with the
creation of the Teddy Ruxpin doll - among the first mass-mar
keted animatronic toys. After a brief stint as a production
manager at a children's video production studio, Earnest
finally decided to pursue his interest in animatronics. In
1988, he established Dreamation Inc. in Yucca Valley,
California. "I started by developing prototype products for
other companies, such as Mattel. These included everything
from plush to hard toys to specialty items," he says. "Then the
work evolved to include amusement parks, such as
Disneyland and Bullwinkles, and casinos like MGM Grand.
We build animatronics for their large stage shows."
Life on the Job
Depending on the size of a job, it can take between 30 days
and six months to design and build an animatronic creature.
Ihe tight deadlines, however, can be the most challenging
aspect of the work, notes Earnest. "We're artisans at heart,
and sometimes we don't want to give up our work. I guess
you could say we're perfectionists."
Although the Dreamation staff handles most of its own pro
jects, Earnest often brings in engineering consultants for the
larger, more complicated jobs, making use of their expertise
to problem solve structural or electrical questions. But for
those engineers who are seriously interested in making ani
matronics a career choice, the best advice, says Earnest, is tc
always be curious. "If you're an engineer who likes to build
or run machines then you have a much better opportunity of
working in the industry."
Earnest also recommends
building a broad background, which might include taking a
seasonal job at a local amusement park, even if it's not
directly attached with the animatronics attractions.
"Whenever you have the opportunity, ask the technical staff
to give you a tour," Earnest says. "Most people will be
happy to show you backstage or to answer questions. From
this, you're building relationships with people who are work
ing with the technology."
Industry Outlook
Creating moving creatures for parades, stage
shows and amusement parks obviously isn't
a blue-chip industry. It's highly specialized
and contained, dependent on the economic
fortune of its client base. If attendance at
parks drops significantly one year, then bud
gets for new attractions the following year are
cut. Additionally, the animatronic industry is
highly competitive, especially now that fea
ture filmmaking has become heavily depen
dent on computer-generated images. That's
why Earnest is always looking for new appli
cations of the technology.
"There are some broad opportunities for this
type of work, from costumes to fiberglass
work," he says. "For instance, 15 years ago I
wouldn't have gone to a toy company, but I
probably would today."
Still a big fan of Disneyland, Earnest now
views the park's larger-than-life attractions
with a different sense of appreciation. "It's

great to know people have seen the things I
work on and enjoy them."
