# A 						GALAXY NOT SO FAR AWAY

Thanks to Lucas Digital and its entities
Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Skywalker
Sound, based out of San Rafael, Calif., the
way movies are made, viewed and heard
has changed.
Episode II: Attack of the Clones, for example,
was filmed entirely with digital cameras. This
allowed the production crew to skip the
tedious steps of converting film to digital
images in order to add in computer-generat
ed images. Computer scientists received the
digital images directly from the set or loca
tion shoot and immediately set to work with
their computer graphics. Among the staff was
Max Chen, a junior software engineer at
ILM, who specializes in 3-D coding.

On the Job
A longtime Star Wars fan, Chen says he was
intrigued with the ever-advancing capabilities
of graphics technology. So much so that it
was the focus of his graduate work at MIT
where he graduated last year with a master's
degree in computer science. After two years
of researching the technology, he decided to
pursue a career with the industry leader. "ILM
is at the forefront. It's always incorporating
new techniques and research into how to
make things faster. It's pushing the edge of
technology," he says.
Of course, Chen could have successfully
taken his knowledge and experience to the
video or computer game industry or Web
services, but he preferred film. "It's much
more visual and that's interesting to me.
Also, I have an [undergraduate] degree in
architecture, and I wanted to stay within that
artistic realm," he says.
Fortunately, his job search paid off. After

being hired in July 2001, he quickly found
himself immersed in the production of
Episode 11. Chen stepped right in to work on
ILM's motion and structure recovery system.
"The program allows us to take images in a
scene and determine where the motion is
taking place," he explains. "Using computer
algorithms, we can match the movement
and recover it in a 3-D information process.
It's cool - you're coding an object in 3-D,
and you see something visual instead of just
numbers."
Chen says the procedure can be used to
either enhance an item, like adding facial
expressions, or cleaning up an ob|ect that
may be slightly out of focus. "It's mostly done
on live-action images, but we do insert com
puter-generated images into [the scene] and
then composite it altogether," he adds.
Industry Outlook
Even though Chen and his colleagues work
in the rolling hills of Northern California, the
intense pressure and competition of
Hollywood are never too far off. The film
industry has come to rely on the audience
appeal of special effects as seen in The
Matrix, Spider-Man and Men in Black, to
name just a few.
Although the digital images of Episode II ulti
mately were transferred to film so it could be
shown in theaters worldwide - there are only
about 60 movie houses in the United States
and Canada equipped to show the digital
version - many industry experts see this as the
format of the future. Logically, this depen
dence on technology will create more oppor
tunities for computer scientists. But with a
similarly growing interest in special effects
careers, competition for jobs will most likely
remain high.
"There are a lot of people wanting to do the
work," says Chen. "I would say that you
need an advanced degree to get an edge in
the market." Specifically, he recommends
getting involved in graphics research even as
an undergraduate. Not only does it demon
strate a knowledge of the industry, it also
shows an initiative to keep abreast of the
ongoing advancements. "Find out what's
being published and how it's being built."
Although filming on Episode 111 isn't sched
uled to begin until next spring, Chen is hard
at work on other films, including The
Incredible Hulk. No matter the subject, Chen
remains captivated with the work. "Plus, I get
to see a lot of movies."
