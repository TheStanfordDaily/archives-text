# THE
						MYSTERY OF MARS
## 
### 
Of course, space travel isn't limited to a film
maker's imagination. For more than 40
years, man has been exploring the possibili
ties of space, including the probability of life
on other planets. One such person is David
Spencer who is leading the 2001 Mars
Odyssey mission in hopes of broadening our
knowledge of the Red Planet.
Spencer's attraction to space exploration was
first captured in high school when he read
James Michener's Space. "That book got me
interested in space exploration and made me
want to become an astronaut."
But unlike other young people who had the
same dream, Spencer actually set out to
attain it. In college, however, his career
objective changed when he was introduced
to orbital mechanics and interplanetary tra
jectory. The thought of sending unmanned
crafts into the galaxies on interplanetary
exploration intrigued him. "I tailored my
undergraduate and master's work into tra
jectory design," he notes.
From there, Spencer headed directly to
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., one of the nation's premier
space research facilities. Within a few years,
Spencer found himself assigned to the 2001
Mars Odyssey project as mission manager, a
very pivotal role. To oversee a project of this
magnitude, with such potential for historical
and scientific significance, is quite an accom
plishment for a barely 30-something profes
sional. "I never thought I would have such a
cool job at thai age," he says.

On the Job
As mission manager, it's Spencer's responsi
bility to oversee every aspect of the Odyssey
project. "There are millions of details, para
meters and numbers that have to be exam
ined before we can send a craft to another
planet," he states. And many of these steps
can take years. "It takes at least three or four
years before you even launch the spacecraft.
Then it takes time to get the craft to the desti
nation and then more time to get the data
from it," Spencer explains.
But that's exactly what's been happening
since 1997.1n April 2001, the Odyssey was
launched and within a year was in Mars'
orbit mapping its surface in search of chemi
cal elements and minerals. Of course, there
were setbacks along the way. "You can be
on the verge of achieving great success and
something terrible goes wrong," Spencer
says. "Those are the difficult parts of the job,
but the rewards are outstanding."
Spencer and his team recently received one
of those rewards. In May, JPL announced
that the Odyssey had successfully launched a
boom that relayed back some very revealing
information: There is indeed water on Mars.
The probe detected a thick layer of ice just a
few feet below the surface. This discovery
brings scientists one step closer to determin

ing when or whether the planet ever support
ed life. "Once the spacecraft starts sending
back images of something no one else has
ever seen, it's amazing," says Spencer.
Industry Outlook
The Mars Odyssey work is good news for the
space agency, which has faced budget cuts
in its International Space Station endeavors.
But Spencer foresees a bright future for his
program. "Our understanding of space and
other planets is in its
infancy," he says. "For example, we know
that Jupiter's moon Uropa has a great deal
of ice on its surface. It may be miles thick or
a salt ocean. We have no idea what's inside
it, but I do believe these questions will be
answered in the next several decades."
In order to explore those mysteries further,
NASA must continue to attract aerospace's
finest engineers and computer scientists. "We
want someone who sees not just the surface
of things, but who digs into details. We want
someone who wants to discover what's
going on," Spencer says.
Of course, interest alone won't secure a job
at JPL. Success in a specialized industry often
demands advanced training. Like Chen,
Spencer agrees that at least a master's
degree is required. But even then, use your

passion for a specific subject to create a
unique graduate education. "We always
need skilled people who can build a back
ground that sets them apart," says Spencer.
In the five years since he began working on
the 2001 Mars Odyssey project, Spencer
has reviewed hundreds of details along the
way. But it's the same interest Michener's
writings piqued that keep the work exciting.
"It's easy to lose the romanticism, but when
you see an image from Mars, you get a
sense that space exploration is possible. I
would be disappointed if I'm 85 years old
and mankind has not yet stepped foot on
Mars."
For engineers, turning your hobbies and
childhood passions into a successful career is
much more than a pipe dream, even in
today's unpredictable economy. As these
engineers and computer scientists have
proven, pursuing a job that's out of the norm
can be your ticket to a long and satisfying
professional life.
