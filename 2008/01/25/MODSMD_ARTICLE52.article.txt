## MARIO F. ALVAREZ 
### 
In this section, we enlisted the help of Stanford alum Mario
Alvarez, who has worked in the engineering sector for
many years. We asked questions aimed at discovering
what he did in his time on the Farm, about what led him
to engineering, and about any advice he may have for
current students. Here are his answers! You can contact

1973, MS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
I should explain first that I was married on October 12,
1968 in my freshman year of college. By the time I fin
ished undergraduate studies with a BSEE at Manhattan
College in 1972, I had accepted a career position as
Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Labs in Holmdel
NJ.
What did you study in college? What were your favorite classes?
I studied Electrical Engineering at both the graduate and
undergraduate level. As I said before, my undergraduate
degree is a BSEE from Manhattan College where I studied
electronics and digital design. As a new hire at AT&T Bell
Labs, I was eligible for a one of a kind opportunity known
then as the One Year on Campus (OYOC) program. I
was to select the University graduate program of my
choice to earn a Master's degree on their tab. I applied
and was accepted at MIT, University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and
Stanford. I chose Stanford because at the time there was
an option to take additional course credits to substitute for
a master's thesis. This allowed me to complete my
Master's degree requirements in one calendar year. I really
enjoyed Fourier Transform Theory, and spent many a
sleepless night at the Stanford computer center writing
software for any one of several programming courses.
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join any clubs or student organizations?
When I came to Stanford in September 1972, I brought
my wife Liz, my 3 year old daughter Lizette, and my 1 year
old son Marcus. Since I was born in Cuba, and my wife
was also Cuban (although born in Queens NY), we tend
ed to be attracted to other international students, but espe
cially the Hispanic students living in Escondido Village. I
had one year to finish my work, so I did not join any orga
nizations, but my wife and I made lots of friends among
the residents of the Escondido Village row houses
designed for families with children.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about your
career plons? If so, what were those thoughts?
I was already employed by AT&T Bell Labs. My thoughts

were to complete my education in telecommunications,
and go back to work as an MTS in the Data
Communications Laboratory at the Holmdel NJ facility.
Looking back, I probably should have stayed in the Bay
Area, where I could have been part of the revolution that
rocked the area with startups like Cisco, and SUN for
example.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experi
ences?
I was busy taking courses during the summer months as
well, since I needed to finish in one year. However, my wife
and I enjoyed the San Francisco Bay Area immensely while
we were there. I recall that the Bay itself is quite chilly, even
in the summer months. I think it was Samuel Clemens who
said: "Coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San
Francisco". My parents came to visit us and the children
during the summer, and we had a wonderful time explor
ing the City by the Bay, Sausalito, and the wine country
whenever we had the chance.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to
do to find it?
My first job was in the Data Communications Laboratory
at AT&T Bell Labs in Holmdel NJ. I got this job from cam
pus interviews at my undergraduate school.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job? Was it what
you expected?
On of my first responsibilities as an MTS at Bell Labs was
to come with a device that could decode DTMF signaling
using digital rather than the traditional analog technolo
gies. I used digital counters and clocks to build a time
domain tone detector. Intel was just coming out with some
of their first microprocessors at the time, but I stuck with
the discrete logic design.
How did your career evolve after that? How did you experiences
lead to other opportunities?
In 1976 I took a job with the Ford Motor Co Electrical
and Electronics Division in Dearborn Michigan. My experi
ence in digital design gave me the opportunity to create
the prototype for what was later called the Electronic
Engine Controller 3rd Generation, or EEC-111. I used small
to medium scale integrated digital circuits to create shift
registers, instruction counters, and instruction decoders to
form a prototype for a microprocessor. I later took this
design to Intel and Motorola to create a Large Scale
Integrated circuit equivalent of this hardware design proto
type. At the facility where I worked in Taylor Ml, we were
able to attach sensors to and control a 1977 Ford LTD
sedan with my design. My colleagues designed the elec
tronic fuel injection circuit and the A/D Converters for the
analog sensors.
What skills and experiences from college were most important in
your career development?

What I learned more than anything else is how to adapt
and evolve. The generation I contributed to was as fast
moving as it is today. I learned how to analyze and think I
new and creative ways. I also had to keep up with the lat
est trends: the microprocessor, object oriented software,
LAN/WAN technology, the ARPANET, and of course, the
Internet.
Please provide a brief description of your current role and exam
ples of typical tasks or projects.
Currently I am working for a Large Federal Government
contractor, assigned to Business Development tasks as an
Advanced Programs Systems Engineer. I write proposals to
win bids with Federal, State and Local government pro
grams. I specialize in Enterprise level web-enabled data
base applications, Storage Area Networks, and embedded
controllers.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career —the major pro
jects or turning points.
My current employment is a brand new job for me. In my
previous employment, I lead a team of 20 Java/J2EE soft
ware developers at the Lakehurst Naval Engineering
Center to create enterprise web-enabled database appli
cations for the US Navy to be deployed on board Nimitz
Class Aircraft Carriers. Before that, I was with a venture
capital startup that developed Fiber Optic Switch/Router
technology. I designed the embedded real-time software
and digital controllers that operated the optical circuit
packs for the All Optical MEMS based Dense Wavelength
Division Multiplexor (DWDM). I hold 2 US Patents based
on this work. In 1999, I was part of a Lucent Bell Labs
team on the MONET project, which replaced an OC-48
SONET ring with a DWDM network serving NASA, the
NSA, the Naval Research Lab (NRL), DISA, DARPA, and
the DIA.

an option to take additional course credits to substitute for
a master's thesis. This allowed me to complete my
Master's degree requirements in one calendar year. I really
enjoyed Fourier Transform Theory, and spent many a
sleepless night at the Stanford computer center writing
software for any one of several programming courses.
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join any clubs or student organizations?
When I came to Stanford in September 1972, I brought
my wife Liz, my 3 year old daughter Lizette, and my 1 year
old son Marcus. Since I was born in Cuba, and my wife
was also Cuban (although born in Queens NY), we tend
ed to be attracted to other international students, but espe
cially the Hispanic students living in Escondido Village. I
had one year to finish my work, so I did not join any orga
nizations, but my wife and I made lots of friends among
the residents of the Escondido Village row houses
designed for families with children.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about your
career plons? If so, what were those thoughts?
I was already employed by AT&T Bell Labs. My thoughts

were to complete my education in telecommunications,
and go back to work as an MTS in the Data
Communications Laboratory at the Holmdel NJ facility.
Looking back, I probably should have stayed in the Bay
Area, where I could have been part of the revolution that
rocked the area with startups like Cisco, and SUN for
example.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experi
ences?
I was busy taking courses during the summer months as
well, since I needed to finish in one year. However, my wife
and I enjoyed the San Francisco Bay Area immensely while
we were there. I recall that the Bay itself is quite chilly, even
in the summer months. I think it was Samuel Clemens who
said: "Coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San
Francisco". My parents came to visit us and the children
during the summer, and we had a wonderful time explor
ing the City by the Bay, Sausalito, and the wine country
whenever we had the chance.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to
do to find it?
My first job was in the Data Communications Laboratory
at AT&T Bell Labs in Holmdel NJ. I got this job from cam
pus interviews at my undergraduate school.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job? Was it what
you expected?
On of my first responsibilities as an MTS at Bell Labs was
to come with a device that could decode DTMF signaling
using digital rather than the traditional analog technolo
gies. I used digital counters and clocks to build a time
domain tone detector. Intel was just coming out with some
of their first microprocessors at the time, but I stuck with
the discrete logic design.
How did your career evolve after that? How did you experiences
lead to other opportunities?
In 1976 I took a job with the Ford Motor Co Electrical
and Electronics Division in Dearborn Michigan. My experi
ence in digital design gave me the opportunity to create
the prototype for what was later called the Electronic
Engine Controller 3rd Generation, or EEC-111. I used small
to medium scale integrated digital circuits to create shift
registers, instruction counters, and instruction decoders to
form a prototype for a microprocessor. I later took this
design to Intel and Motorola to create a Large Scale
Integrated circuit equivalent of this hardware design proto
type. At the facility where I worked in Taylor Ml, we were
able to attach sensors to and control a 1977 Ford LTD
sedan with my design. My colleagues designed the elec
tronic fuel injection circuit and the A/D Converters for the
analog sensors.
What skills and experiences from college were most important in
your career development?

What I learned more than anything else is how to adapt
and evolve. The generation I contributed to was as fast
moving as it is today. I learned how to analyze and think I
new and creative ways. I also had to keep up with the lat
est trends: the microprocessor, object oriented software,
LAN/WAN technology, the ARPANET, and of course, the
Internet.
Please provide a brief description of your current role and exam
ples of typical tasks or projects.
Currently I am working for a Large Federal Government
contractor, assigned to Business Development tasks as an
Advanced Programs Systems Engineer. I write proposals to
win bids with Federal, State and Local government pro
grams. I specialize in Enterprise level web-enabled data
base applications, Storage Area Networks, and embedded
controllers.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career —the major pro
jects or turning points.
My current employment is a brand new job for me. In my
previous employment, I lead a team of 20 Java/J2EE soft
ware developers at the Lakehurst Naval Engineering
Center to create enterprise web-enabled database appli
cations for the US Navy to be deployed on board Nimitz
Class Aircraft Carriers. Before that, I was with a venture
capital startup that developed Fiber Optic Switch/Router
technology. I designed the embedded real-time software
and digital controllers that operated the optical circuit
packs for the All Optical MEMS based Dense Wavelength
Division Multiplexor (DWDM). I hold 2 US Patents based
on this work. In 1999, I was part of a Lucent Bell Labs
team on the MONET project, which replaced an OC-48
SONET ring with a DWDM network serving NASA, the
NSA, the Naval Research Lab (NRL), DISA, DARPA, and
the DIA.

1973, MS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
I should explain first that I was married on October 12,
1968 in my freshman year of college. By the time I fin
ished undergraduate studies with a BSEE at Manhattan
College in 1972, I had accepted a career position as
Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Labs in Holmdel
NJ.
What did you study in college? What were your favorite classes?
I studied Electrical Engineering at both the graduate and
undergraduate level. As I said before, my undergraduate
degree is a BSEE from Manhattan College where I studied
electronics and digital design. As a new hire at AT&T Bell
Labs, I was eligible for a one of a kind opportunity known
then as the One Year on Campus (OYOC) program. I
was to select the University graduate program of my
choice to earn a Master's degree on their tab. I applied
and was accepted at MIT, University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and
Stanford. I chose Stanford because at the time there was
an option to take additional course credits to substitute for
a master's thesis. This allowed me to complete my
Master's degree requirements in one calendar year. I really
