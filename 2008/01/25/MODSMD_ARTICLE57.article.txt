## SUSTAINABILITY: THE ULTIMATE LIBERAL ART Courtesy of The Chronicle of Higher Education 
### FRANK H.T. RHODES 
Ironic as it may now seem, the liberal arts of grammar,
rhetoric, and logic were regarded by the ancient Greeks as
practical and useful skills - so useful, in fact, that they were
seen as the indispensable preparation for citizenship, for
participation in a free society. And it was in Greece, the
same Greece, that science was "invented." How doubly
ironic, then, that in our science-driven age, we have so little
place for the wisdom of Greece.
It is not that we reject useful knowledge. We worship it, but
we have redefined it to exclude those very elements that the
Greeks judged of such significance. It is time that we
reconsider our approach - for the benefit, and perhaps
even survival, of our modern world.
Our scholarly forebears of the Middle Ages enlarged,
rather than ignored, the judgment of Greece, adding to the
liberal arts the quadrivium of arithmetic, astronomy, geom
etry, and music, thus providing the essential educational
preparation for the new age of discovery that marked the
Renaissance. Even those most practical of people, the pio
neers of the industrial and social revolutions of the 19th
century, were careful not to reject, but to redefine, the
essential content of the liberal arts - expanding them to
embrace the new insights of the emerging natural and
social sciences.
It is our generation that has seen the liberal arts confined
largely to the liberal-arts colleges, both the smaller, tradi
tional, independent undergraduate institutions and the col
leges of liberal arts and sciences within universities. Outside
those communities, the liberal arts have languished, not
because they have been tested and found wanting - the
evidence of centuries refutes that proposition - but because
they have been nudged aside, elbowed out by more "prac
tical" training and more "relevant" instruction.
So our new leaders - engineers and architects, physicians
and social workers, lawmakers and urban planners, busi
ness executives and economic policy makers - graduate
untouched by the hard-won collective historical experience,
social perspectives, moral considerations, and humane
reflections of our fellow human beings through the ages.
Unencumbered by such reflections, they are likely to con
front each new emerging issue as something novel: a chal
lenge now encountered by society for the first time.
Perhaps we need to learn from our forebears of the
Renaissance and Industrial Revolution and reformulate the
liberal arts in ways that will nurture the development of
freethinking men and women for the current age. The con
cept of sustainability could provide a new foundation for
the liberal arts and sciences.
By "sustainability" I mean the effort to frame social and
economic policy so as to preserve with minimum distur
bance earth's bounty - its resources, inhabitants, and envi
ronments - for the benefit of both present and future gener
ations. The old Native American proverb captures perfectly
the spirit of this sustainability: We do not inherit the earth
from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.
What might such a foundation entail? Certainly some sig
nificant exposure to the appropriate sciences: geology, nat
ural resources, ecology, and climatology. Certainly, too,
some understanding of social interactionsociology, eco
nomics, and history. And also, surely, some extensive famil

iarity with the great issues and themes of human inquiry,
self-reflection, and moral consideration that have guided
human conduct and reflected human creativity - with the
arts and the humanities, in other words. And to anchor
everything in the present, some review of the practical arts
of technical discovery and invention, especially in relation
to the broad issues now confronting us.
"That's not much different from the traditional grab bag of
the liberal arts," the cynics might respond. But, in fact, it
would be different in the new focus, added coherence, and
stark immediacy that it would provide. Sustainability, after
all, is the ultimate liberal art (and science).
Mastery of such a sweeping range of topics is, to be sure,
the work of a lifetime and more, but exposure to the issues
and methodological approaches involved is not. It is, in
fact, no more extensive in its reach or burdensome in its
demands than the "old" liberal arts. How it should be
framed, what it should contain, how it should be taught,
and how it should be supplemented will be the questions
that the governing faculty of each college and university
should consider and decide for itself. There can and should
be no single prescriptive approach. Experiment and variety
will have much to teach us.
But we should agree on one matter: The broad range of
questions that sustainability raises have no single set of
answers. We have yet to develop solutions. The topic is full

of approximations, assumptions, projections, extrapola
tions, and ambiguities. Moreover, we should avoid simple
stances because, to a greater degree than most other sub
jects, sustainability is open to indoctrination and partisan
scholarship. Although it may be possible, it is difficult to be
a partisan advocate in, say, chemistry or classics. It is prob
ably less difficult in climate change or energy policy.
And beyond the complexities of sustainability as such, there
lies the larger question of sustainability for what purpose.
For sustainability will be best understood within the larger
framework of values, meaning, and purpose - just as "solu
tions" are best considered within the context of the global
society. That is why the wisdom that the traditional liberal
arts provide is such a vital part of any such new curriculum.
Such a new approach to liberal arts, science, and sustain
ability will demand much of its students; it will demand
even more of faculty members. But it will have one distinct
potential benefit: If it is taught as an exercise in exploration
and discovery, it may form the basis for a new kind of glob
al map - a policy blueprint - that would allow us to set a
common course for all the people of our rare, beautiful,
and benevolent planet.

be no single prescriptive approach. Experiment and variety
will have much to teach us.
But we should agree on one matter: The broad range of
questions that sustainability raises have no single set of
answers. We have yet to develop solutions. The topic is full

of approximations, assumptions, projections, extrapola
tions, and ambiguities. Moreover, we should avoid simple
stances because, to a greater degree than most other sub
jects, sustainability is open to indoctrination and partisan
scholarship. Although it may be possible, it is difficult to be
a partisan advocate in, say, chemistry or classics. It is prob
ably less difficult in climate change or energy policy.
And beyond the complexities of sustainability as such, there
lies the larger question of sustainability for what purpose.
For sustainability will be best understood within the larger
framework of values, meaning, and purpose - just as "solu
tions" are best considered within the context of the global
society. That is why the wisdom that the traditional liberal
arts provide is such a vital part of any such new curriculum.
Such a new approach to liberal arts, science, and sustain
ability will demand much of its students; it will demand
even more of faculty members. But it will have one distinct
potential benefit: If it is taught as an exercise in exploration
and discovery, it may form the basis for a new kind of glob
al map - a policy blueprint - that would allow us to set a
common course for all the people of our rare, beautiful,
and benevolent planet.
