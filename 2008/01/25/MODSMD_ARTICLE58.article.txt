# Liberal Arts Alumni Corner
## SARAH HENDERSON 
### 
In this section, we enlisted the help of two Stanford alums,
Sarah Henderson, and Bob Osborne, both with a great
deal of work experience in the liberal arts. We asked ques
tions aimed at discovering what they did in their time on
the Farm, about what led them to the liberal arts, and
about any advice they may have for current students. Here
are their answers!

2003, BA ENGLISH, STUDIO ART MINOR
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
What did you study in college? What were your favorite classes?
I majored in English and minored in Studio Art, where I
concentrated on photography.
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join any clubs or student organizations?
I spent a lot of my time babysitting for a lot of the families
in the area. I also took part in the outdoors club. I really
enjoyed going to the local Redwoods with some of my
friends from it. Other than that it was classes, exercise, and
wandering the campus and the bay area taking pictures.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about your
career plans? If so, what were those thoughts?
Although it's certainly not the traditional path, coming into
college I knew that I wanted to be a professional photogra
pher. My freshman year in high school, actually, was when
I took my first photography class. My parents bought me

my first SLR camera for my birthday the following year, and
that's how things started off for me.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experiences?
My freshman summer I spent back at home working in
retail at the local Gap. My parents realized that before
long I wouldn't be able to spend much more time with
them, so my sophomore summer traveling around East
Asia. My parents are both teachers, and my dad was
doing research on ancient artifacts, which is why it was
possible to do that. My junior summer I spent interning
with one of the local photographers back at home in
Montana.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to
do to find it?
Right off the bat I decided that all I needed to do would be
to make enough money to support myself, but beyond that
I wanted to do what makes me happy. Consequently, I
decided to become a freelance photographer and work
other part-time jobs as necessary to keep myself going. I
didn't really have to do anything to "find" it. My babysitting
throughout college meant that by the time I graduated I
already had a lot of the photography equipment I needed,
so at that point it became more an issue of finding specific
contract jobs on a case by case basis. My long term goal
is to become an outdoors photographer like Ansel Adams
or Galen Rowell, so I spent much of my time when I wasn't
shooting friends' weddings building up my portfolio of
work.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job? Was it what
you expected?

Different types of photography vary greatly between from
one to the next, but what I spent most of my time doing
was the aforementioned weddings. I also had a few
friends start up clothing companies so I would come in and
do the product photography for them. Though I wouldn't
say my activities weren't what I expected, there was a lot
more planning and people management involved than I
had expected. I had seen what it was like the previous
summer during my internship, but doing everything yourself
still takes a lot more time and effort.
How did your career evolve after that? How did you experiences
lead to other opportunities?
In the last couple years I've started to expand and shift my
focus a little bit. I'm finally starting to spend more time in
the outdoors, and I've even had a few outdoors projects
commissioned by some local outdoors magazines.
Obviously, the dream is to end up publishing in Outdoors
magazine or National Geographic, but I'm still trying to
keep my thoughts realistic.
What skills and experiences from college were most important in
your career development?
Probably the most important thing I've learned from time
management. When I'm jumping from place to place and
trying to juggle different people's demands at the same
time, it's taxing. I have to stay focused on the job at hand
and take care of everything else at another time. It might
sound obvious, but if I'm not focused on the task at hand,
the product (the photo) won't come out well, and my con
tinued success is dependent upon how I do each and every
day.
Please provide a brief description of your current role and examples
of typical tasks or projects.
I have a little more freedom now. I've started to build up a
roster of people who know that they can hire me and I'll
deliver a solid result. I've also started to expand things
beyond my hometown area. Other than that, things are
pretty much the same.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career-tlie major projects
or turning points.
I wouldn't say that I've had really any major turning points.
Like I said before, since high school it's been my goal to
become a professional photographer. I will say that my
biggest breakdown came about six months after gradua
tion when I was still living with my parents, working at the
local Starbucks, and it seemed like no one wanted to hire
me. I decided at that time that I would really have to start
pushing myself more to turn my hobby into a career. After
that, every time I walked into one of the local stores I would
give them a business card and tell them that if they needed
any photo work done they should call me. It's a grind,
honestly.
If you could go back in time, what do you wish you had known
about the job-search process or careers in general as a college fresh
man? Another way of putting this is, what resources do you wish you

had had at your disposal?
Realize that Stanford is a bubble. Be
grateful for the resources at hand but real
ize that they won't be there forever. At
some point you have to become a lot
more self-reliant (or at least I did!).
What are a couple interesting things happening
right now in the photography sector? Wnere can
students go to find out more information (i.e.
magazines, web sites, upcoming events)?
The photography sector is so broad that
you can really find out information from a
lot of places. Obviously, it helps to learn
the fundamentals, so taking a class doesn't
hurt. Also, it's good to develop a more
refined sense of what "works" and what
doesn't, so looking through a lot of the
photo magazines in the bookstore helps
with that as well. Lastly, there's nothing like
personal experience. There's the business
side of things, which you get through an
internship, and then there's the aesthetic
side of things, which you only achieve
through trial and error. You just have to
put yourself out there and risk it.
