1976, BA POLITICAL SCIENCE,
PHILOSOPHY MINOR

What did you study in college? What were your
favorite classes?
I decided to major in Political Science
because I thought that my interests were
predominantly centered in the social sci
ences. I also minored in Philosophy
because I enjoy looking at the world from
different perspectives, whether practical,
theoretical, or otherwise. Interestingly
enough, one of my favorite classes was in
the Religious Studies department on east
ern religions and philosophy.
What kinds of activities were you involved in
while you were at Stanford? Did you join any
clubs or student organizations?
One of the clubs I joined was the Aikido
club - Aikido is a Japanese martial art that
relies upon manipulating the other per
son's movement to counter their harmful
intentions. My freshman roommate was
also a foreign exchange student, so over
the course of the year I began to spend
more and more time with all the foreign
student groups.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any
thoughts about your career plans? If so, what
were those thoughts?
I planned to work in general business,
though to be honest I wasn't entirely too
sure what I would end up doing. I also
briefly considered academia and research,
but decided soon after that I didn't want to

commit the time and effort necessary to
work towards a Ph.D. degree.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work,
volunteer, travel, other experiences) What did
you take away from those experiences?
My first two summers, I helped my dad
with his job. He was a general contractor,
and so those first couple summers I helped
him with his various clients (housing con
struction). Spring quarter my junior year I
spent overseas in Florence, so that summer
I basically spent time traveling around
Europe. It's still one of my dreams to
move back there if I ever get the chance.
What was your first job after graduation and
what did you have to do to find it?
My first job after graduation was working
at a now defunct liberal think tank based
out of San Francisco. Up until about
spring quarter of my senior year, I hadn't
really put together any post-graduation
work plans. I talked to my different profes
sors to see if any of them could point me
in the right direction. One of them direct
ed me to one of the directors, who then
decided to hire me after a short interview
process.
What were the major responsibilities in your first
job? Was it what you expected?
My job was largely to collect data from
both literature and media concerning the
state of the political arena at the time.
Most of the active analysis was done by
the individuals above me - though they
didn't refer to it as such when hiring me I
was basically employed to do the grunt
work.
How did your career evolve after that? How did
you experiences lead to other opportunities?
After a few years I decided that I wasn't
really willing to put in the time and effort
necessary to advance within the organiza
tion. By that time I had met and married
my wife, whose job required that we move
down to Los Angeles. Upon moving down
to L.A., I decided to switch careers. One
of the projects I wanted to start working on
was writing a novel. Even though my wife
was working, however, we decided that I
should get a job too, so I decided to
become a middle school teacher. I went
back Cal State - L.A. to get my teaching
credentials, and then jumped into the pub
lic school system teaching history.
What skills and experiences from college were
most important in your career development?
How to deal with obstinate people who
disagree with you! Really, I'd say the
important thing is people skills. That's
pretty much all there is to it. If you can
handle all the individuals around you, you
might not be happy, but you'll get by. If
you don't get along with the individuals

around you, you won't be happy.
Pleose provide a brief description of your current
role and examples of typical tasks or projects.
As I like to put it, I've got my day job and
my night job. My day job is teaching his
tory. I put together the daily lessons, grade
tests and papers, so on. Sometimes when
I notice a student is particularly underper
forming, I try to call up his or her parents
to set up a time when we can meet to go
over things. A lot of times, getting the par
ents onboard is the hardest part. A lot of
them don't seem to care, and no one
wants to hear that his or her child isn't
doing well. Of course there's always your
standard office politics. Teachers hear far
more than their students probably want,
and gossip is a problem even among
adults. In the evening, I work on my novel.
Looking back at college, I think what I
really enjoyed was examining and experi
encing the world around me. I don't want
to talk about it yet, but I'm trying to inte
grate that perspective into my writing.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career
the major projects or turning points.
I've already covered pretty much all of it. I
worked in political research, switched
careers, and have been teaching for the
last twenty-five years. I've moved schools

a few times, of course. I'm getting pretty
close to retirement now, actually, so hope
fully I'll be able to finally pull together what
I've been working on for the last decade!
If you could go back in time, what do you wish
you had known about the job-search process or
careers in general as a college freshman?
Another way of putting this is, what resources do
you wish you had had at your disposal?
Don't expect your life plan to follow a logi
cal path. You might end up doing some
thing completely different, and that's okay.
Open yourself up to the possibilities and
don't restrict yourself to doing something
that makes you miserable.
What are a couple interesting things happening
right now in the writing/learning sector? Where
can students go to fina out more information (i.e.
magazines, web sites, upcoming events)?
Focusing on writing, I'd say that the desire
to write (at least for myself) comes from a
desire to explore and explain the world
around us. Consequently, I think the best
thing a person can be is curious and eager
to learn. Not just academically, but rather
in the holistic sense of things. I think it's as
important to want to learn about your
classmate as it is to want to learn the class
material itself.
