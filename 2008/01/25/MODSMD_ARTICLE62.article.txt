## HELP WANTED: 640,000 OPEN POSITIONS COURTESY OF THE NONPROFIT TIMES 
### Don McNamara 
The future is here.
That's a good thing, isn't it?
It is not good if the future is the projected gap, possibly a
chasm, between the number of senior-level managers at
nonprofit organizations and the numbers of lower-level
employees who would be in line to replace them.
The Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit management support
organization in New York, Boston and San Francisco, has
published a report, "The Nonprofit Sector's Leadership
Deficit," that presents a gloomy forecast for nonprofit lead
ership down the road.
The report projects that the number of new senior man
agers needed would increase from 56,000 to 78,000
between 2006 to 2016. Worse, it projects a cumulative
total of 640,000 senior positions that will need to be filled.
Thomas Tierney, founder of the Bridgespan Group and
chief author of the report, said he saw the trend more than
five years ago, when he worked at the for-profit consultant
Bain and Company in Massachusetts. "It became clear in
2000-2001 that many of the organizations we were serv
ing were finding it difficult to build their own organizations.
And, most of our clients were trying to do more, serve
5,000 children instead of 1,000, for example," Tierney
said. "When they're growing, they need more bench depth.
Clients were having a hard time finding CFOs and CEOs,
and they were having succession problems."
Money is an ongoing problem for nonprofits. Tierney said
he understands that issue, but he didn't see that as the
chief problem. "The three ingredients are money, talent
(that is, people) and a plan or strategy," he said. "The
biggest problem was talent."
Tierney said that the 640,000 figure was reached based
not only on the current situation but also on the expected
growth in the number of nonprofit organizations. The figure
does not include government or educational institutions.
He emphasized that the report refers to new executive jobs.
By "executive," he means the top seven positions, and by
"new" he means people who are not in one of those jobs
already.
Admitting that the growth of the sector is a variable, Tierney
said that a different set of calibrations could move the
number as low as 300,000 but that another set could
bump it as high as 1.2 million.
"We noticed the gap a few years ago," said Kala Stroup,
president of American Humanics (AH), a national alliance
of colleges, universities and nonprofits formed to educate,
prepare, and certify professionals to strengthen and lead

nonprofit organizations. AH has worked in coordination
with Bridgespan.
Stroup added that AH has been working to advance
awareness of all facets of the nonprofit sector, including try
ing to make college students more aware of it.
To that end, AH has established the Initiative for the
Nonprofit Sector, based primarily on recruitment and reten
tion issues. Stephen Bauer, director of the initiative, said it
offers a certificate in nonprofit management that includes
course work and an internship. AH also offers workshops
and volunteer opportunities.
It is leading a coalition of 60 organizations that are study
ing and trying to address three crucial areas:
• Diversity at top and bottom;
• The effect of student debt on the sector (students can't
pay their loans on nonprofit entry-level pay); and,
• A national campaign to promote nonprofit careers.
"We agree there's going to be a significant shortage (of
managers)," said Don Crocker, president and CEO of The
Support Center for Nonprofit Management in New York
City. "We're already seeing increasing numbers of senior
managers retiring — CEO, CFO, etc. More people than
ever are contacting us for interim executives. We're training
interim CEOs. The shortage is happening."
That sentiment is widespread. "It (the shortage) is now,
absolutely," said Lisa Brown Morton, president and CEO of
Nonprofit HR Solutions, an executive search firm in
Washington, D.C., that deals only with nonprofits.
To address the issue, she sponsored "Who's Got Next?," a
symposium held last month in Washington, D.C., (after this
issue of The NonProfit Times went to press) to look at the
leadership crisis among African-American-focused nonprof
its.
Although the looming retirement of the Baby Boom gener
ation is blamed for the upcoming managerial shortage,
Brown Morton discerns other factors. "What we're finding
is an increase in the departure of long-term executive direc
tors, founders and other professionals," Brown Morton
said. "They are leaving and there are not sufficient num
bers of middle managers because nonprofits are not heavi
ly staffed at middle management."
Brown Morton attributed this problem to immediate finan
cial constraints, as well as a lack of sufficient funding for
capacity building. She also said there is a lack of commit
ment to human resources support because nonprofits are
under tremendous pressure to devote money to programs
and not administration.
She also noted that young people considering career
options see the opportunity to make greater amounts of
money in other sectors. As if all that is not enough, the
transition from the for-profit world is not one that can be
made automatically.

"I think it is largely a matter of understanding about how
decisions are made," Brown Morton said. "In nonprofits
there is more consensus, decisions are made more slowly,
decisions can be impacted by lack of resources or involve
ment of the board. There's a lack of understanding (among
for-profit executives) about involvement and integration of
volunteers."
Gayle A. Brandel, president and CEO of Professionals for
Nonprofits, a staffing firm with offices in New York and
Washington, D.C., that deals with nonprofits, agreed that
the leadership gap already exists. "Nonprofit executive jobs
are very hard, quite difficult," said Brandel. "A lot of people
are coming up to retirement age in the sector at the same
time and are going to be difficult to replace.
"A lot of nonprofits are small and don't have succession
plans. They don't have a milieu for their staff to be trained
to become the next executive director of the organization.
That is the problem," she said. "There are many people in
middle management, and organizations can't prepare
them. They use all their money to provide services, espe
cially with high-risk groups. They just don't have a lot of
money to play with."
Susan Lajoie Eagan, executive director of the Mandel
Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, acknowledged the retire
ment picture but also saw other difficulties leading to job
burnout. "It is very much related to the challenges of
fundraising and viability of organizations, also the difficulty
of working with boards and volunteers," Eagan said.
"Also, as financial pressures grow, it's knowing how the
economy could be anticipated. Volunteers are increasingly
pressed in the amount of time they can devote. That will
create even more pressure. There is difficulty down the line,
not just filling positions but retaining people."
"Succession, that's a big topic I hear about now," said
Lewis Brindle, director of the George H. Heyman Jr. Center
of Philanthropy and Fundraising at New York University.
"Nonprofits themselves and boards of nonprofits and
administrators are at a certain age, and there's the fear -1
don't know if it will be true or not - that maybe the mission
of the organization might not be in touch with the reality
now. That might be a reason why people are not chomp
ing at the bit to take over. I haven't heard a good reason
why.
"Another issue related to that regards the founder in the
organization. Mow do you comfortably move the organiza
tion forward while the founder is still around?"
Brindle said there is also a new breed of nonprofit board
member, for example people with hedge fund experience,
who expect nonprofits to take on new ideas.
"Organizations might have to take it up a notch and get in
sync with donors," he said. "Otherwise they'll be unhappy
and they'll move on."
