# FOR A GOOD TIME, CALL...
## YOUNG, SOCIALLY-CONSCIOUS VOLUNTEERS MIX FUN WITH SERIOUS WORK

Ellen Shortill never really set out to form a fundraising
group made up of Washington, D.C., young professionals.
It only happened that way after she woke up one day
inspired to raise $5,000 for a local charity — and along
the way, inspired her friends.
"I had no idea how I was going to raise the money, but I
knew I was going to try," she said.
After engaging her friends in her big idea, the small group
met during happy hour at a local bar and gave themselves
a name — SMASHED (Society of Mature Adults Seeking to
Help, Entertain and Donate). They decided that the only
way to truly get young professionals in the Washington,
D.C., area involved was to make it fun and as far from
normal (and formal) as possible.
"People like knowing they are having fun and doing what
they want to do, while helping a charity," said Shortill, 38,
who said she is one of the oldest participants in SMASHED.
Most of it's volunteers are ages 25 to 35. "If it's easy and
fun for them, they are willing to do it and get involved."
That is the motto for a new breed of volunteer: the young
professional. Nonprofit organizations large and small are
tapping into this market for a new crop of volunteer/donor.
Many of these younger volunteers are results-driven philan
thropists who often take an active role in the charities they
support. Most of them are keen on having a good time
and networking with their peers while "doing good." And
almost all of them call the Internet their second home and
wouldn't think twice before making all of their charitable
contributions online.
"We have the opportunity to get involved (during our 20s)
through the Internet, things like Facebook, etc., that the
older generation didn't have," said Will Schneider, a young
professional who works for New York-based Changing Our

World. He leads a new group, FLiP (Future Leaders in
Philanthropy), a networking group for young professionals
in the philanthropy world.
Groups such as FLiP SMASHED, Party with Purpose in the
New York area and the Boston Young Professionals
Association depend greatly on online communications to
recruit volunteers and keep them coming back for more.
These groups make it easy for young professionals to find
information about volunteer opportunities donate directly
online and check out the celebrity-like photos after all the
fun.
The Party's Where?
Fun is really what it's all about with many young profes
sional volunteer groups. "Young professionals who are 21-
to 30-years-old want to be socially conscious, but money is
tight and they often don't have a lot of disposable income,"
said Nathan Spencer, director of publicity for the Boston
Young Professionals Association (BYPA). "They like to go
out, meet new people — but do it for a good cause."
That's why the BYPA created a partnership with the national
On Your Feet Project. OYFP partners with nonprofits in
large cities to facilitate active involvement among young
adults in the areas of children's welfare, domestic violence,
education, homelessness, personal/public health and envi
ronmental protection. The nonprofit aims to create accessi
ble, event-based outreach programs that harness the
power of popular culture and volunteerism.
OYFP taps into BYPA's more than 10,000 young members
to support local nonprofits chosen by OYFP and the BYPA
board of directors. Spencer said the BYPA tends to benefit
smaller, less-recognized nonprofits in the Boston area.
OYFP has operations in New York City, Boston, Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia.
The fundraisers are far from a typical Boston event, com
plete with black tie and pricey cocktails. They tend to be
more "hip," such as a salsa event at a local dance club or
bowling night at an all-night bowling alley. Shortill with
SMASHED said the events in Washington, D.C. are never
typical, which is what makes them so popular with the
younger crowd.
"It's great to see a pretty important person on The Hill
dressed up as a pirate, relieving some stress and acting
completely silly," she said. "The great thing about our
events is that you don't have to get dressed up in a black
tie. Those type of events are great, but sometimes you just
want to have a hippity-hoppity race with your friends."
Hence, the reason the most popular SMASHED event held
each year is the Idiotarod, a spoof of the famous Alaskan
dog sled race that involves more than 80 costume-clad
teams zooming shopping carts throughout the streets of the
nation's capital. Other events include the Rec Room
Olympics, the Man Pageant and a citywide scavenger hunt
on the scale of "The Amazing Race." These events are set
to raise more than SI 5,000 this year for Washington,
D.C.-based charities.
"We've always aimed to benefit small, local charities where
$1,000 or $3,000 has the potential to make an impact,"
Shortill said. "We've turned away charities because they are
too big and have other resources."
Making a Difference — Today
The young professionals tend to look for charities where
they can immediately make a difference. They also look for
opportunities that don't necessarily take a long commit
ment, what has become known as episodic volunteering.

Volunteer management organizations such as the Hands
on Network (HoN) in Atlanta work hard to put together
opportunities that appeal to young professional volunteers.
"The Hands on Network was actually started in the 1980s
by young professionals who were new in their careers,
working long and crazy hours, but who wanted to give
back," said Lisa Flick, vice president of network advance
ment for HoN. "What they found were a lot of obstacles.
They [worked on putting together a network of opportuni
ties] that allowed for flexible schedules, different commit
ment levels and a diversity of community issues."
Today, the HoN — which merged with the Washington,
D.C.-based Points of Light Foundation this past July — still
has a number of programs targeting young professionals.
Its TeamWorks program is designed for volunteers age 25
to 35 who are seeking service opportunities but in a long
term social setting. The program allows a group of volun
teers to focus on specific issues and neighborhoods and
requires a time commitment of up to nine months.
TeamWorks serves as a mini "sampler platter" for volun
teering, while allowing young professionals to meet like
minded individuals. Volunteering "gigs" might include
cleaning a homeless shelter, providing meals for the home
less, distributing condoms in an urban neighborhood to
help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases or
painting a neighborhood health clinic. Many of the pro
gram's participants continue as TeamWorks project leaders,
who lead up to 12 volunteers and serve as liaisons with the
HoN staff.
"TeamWorks has been really popular with young profes
sionals who are new to town and want to understand the
issues facing the community," Flick said. "The social net
working aspect has been fantastic and has allowed people
to meet each other and volunteer together throughout a
series of projects."
Whether young professionals are sharing a beer at the
local bar (with the proceeds going to the women and chil
dren's shelter down the street) or learning about the eco
nomic implications of homelessness through a TeamWorks
program, it is obvious that social networking is a must for
these volunteers. "Acting like a crazy fool for a good cause
is what it's all about," Shortill said. "It really works. People
love it."
