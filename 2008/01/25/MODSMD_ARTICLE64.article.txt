# Non Profit Alumni Corner
## JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ 
### 
In this section, we enlisted the help of Stanford alum Joaquin Hernandez, who recently began working for Teach For America. We asked questions
aimed at discovering what he did in his time on the Farm, about what led him to non profit work, and about any advice he may have for current stu
dents. Mere are his answers!

2007, BA POLITICAL SCIENCE & PSYCHOLOGY
STANFORD UNIVERSITY

What did you study in college? Whot were your favorite classes?
Political Science and Psychology. My favorite classes were
Political Science 114S: International Security in a Changing
World and Psych 163: Interpersonal Basis of Abnormal
Psychopathology
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join any clubs or student organizations?
When I entered undergrad, I was really excited about get
ting involved in policy and politics on campus. So, I decid
ed the best way to cultivate these interests would be to get
involved with the nascent Roosevelt Institution as a director
for the Center on Race and Immigration as well as board
member and media relations officer for The Stanford
Democrats. I also wanted more hands-on academic
research experience, so I became a research assistant for
the Political Science and Psychology departments. My expe
riences were so positive-especially my work in Professor
Hazel Marksus's MCS Lab-that I continued doing research
in both departments until graduation. Since I flirted with
the idea of pursuing journalism, I also worked as a senior
staff writer and news desk editor for The Stanford Daily. My
Daily experience gave me the opportunity to learn from a
number of talented, budding journalists and build a memo
rable rapport with other journalists. As a Bridge Peer coun
selor, I talked to students who were dealing with a wide
variety of challenging situations. This experience helped
me develop better listening skills and a more nuanced
understanding of people's everyday struggles. I especially
recommend this activity for students interested in pursuing a
career in psychological counseling. One of my most
rewarding activities was working as a Resident Assistant for
Naranja. When I first took the position, I was anxious
about being the awkwardly male R.A. on the all-girls floor,
but in the end it was one of my most rewarding experi
ences. I had the opportunity to plan and participate in fun
dorm-wide trips, run the dorm's day-to-day activities, and
lend an ear to anyone who needed it. I also had the
chance to cultivate lifelong friendships with residents and
staff members.
When you came to Stanford, did you have any thoughts about your
career plans? If so, what were those thoughts*
When I first attended Stanford, I thought I might want to get
involved in the field of psychology or law. I still may pursue
those fields after attending law and/or graduate school.
What did you do with your summers? (i.e. work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) What did you take away from those experiences?

I spent one summer working as a staff writer for a commu
nity newspaper in East Los Angeles through the Rebele
Journalism Internship program. This internship helped me
hone my writing, editing, and analytical skills. Through this
experience, I also learned how to adjust to the unpre
dictability of the professional world.
I spent another summer working as a Stanford in
Government Fellow at the National Archives and Records
Administration in Washington, D.C. This experience helped
me improve my research skills and gain a deeper appreci
ation for the role that archivists play in preserving history
and documenting our nation's rich past. It also allowed
me to network with other college-age peers who shared my

interests in history, politics, and public sen/ice.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to
do to find it?
After graduation, I joined the Teach for America corps in
Washington, D.C. I found out about the job while visiting
booths at an on-campus career fair and visiting the Teach
for America Web site. I also attended a Teach for America
informational session, which was really helpful in helping
me gain a clearer sense of what the TFA mission was all
about and how this non-profit aimed to close the educa
tional achievement gap.
What were the major responsibilities in your first job? Was it what
you expected?
Basically, I am responsible for promoting the upward edu
cational mobility of 180 A.P World History students at an
urban high school in Washington, D.C. More specifically, I
am in charge of fashioning and implementing a curriculum
that can help educationally disadvantaged students make
significant academic strides. The job is extremely challeng
ing but extremely rewarding. The most difficult aspect is
getting students invested in the rigorous academic goals
that I have set for them. Although it can be tough, the
position's negatives are outweighed by its clear positives:

the personal and intellectual connections that I make with
my students.
How did your career evolve after that? How did you experiences
lead to other opportunities?
I just started the position in September and have not yet
pursued other opportunities, so I cannot answer this ques
tion.
What skills and experiences from college were most important in
your career development?
Writing, reading, public speaking, and analytical skills were
the most important and relevant for this position.
Please provide a brief description of your current role and examples
of typical tasks or projects.
See above.
Please provide a brief chronology of your career-the major projects
or turning points.
Basically, I was recruited, trained for 5 weeks at Institute,
was interviewed and hired as a DCPS teacher, attended A.R
teacher training, and began teaching at Coolidge Senior
High. In addition to teaching, I am now juggling graduate
classes in education so that I can obtain my certification
and a Masters of Arts in Teaching degree (M.A.T.)
If you could go back in time, what do you wish you had known
about the job-search process or careers in general as a college fresh
man? Another way of putting this is, what resources do you wish you
had had at your aisposal?
I was very satisfied with the CDC's services. What I found
most useful were the CDC's mock interviews as well as
their online cover letter and resume-building guides.
What are a couple interesting things happening right now in the non
profit sector?
Where can students go to find out more information (i.e.
magazines, web sites, upcoming events)?
I don't know much about the non-profit sector, but I can tell
you about why I decided to work in the non-profit sector as
a TFA corps member. I decided to work as a TFA corps
member because I wanted to join a movement where I felt
I could make a tangible difference in the lives of people
from at-risk communities. Since I also have aspirations to
work within these communities after law or graduate
school, I felt that working as a TFA corps member could
give me a better, more hands-on understanding of the
struggles that people within these communities face.
