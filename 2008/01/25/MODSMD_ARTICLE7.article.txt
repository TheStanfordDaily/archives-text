January 25,1977: Reactions
to pardon vary
President Jimmy Carter's announce
ment Friday of an unconditional pardon
for draft resisters has elicited opinions
ranging from delight to disappointment
around campus.
"It was a good try." said Julia Brown, a
Columbae resident who describes herself
as "a middle-class American suburbanite."
"I think it was a typical example of an
action by a supposedly liberal Democrat
ic government that really isn't," she
added.
David Harris, former student body

president here and a former Democratic
candidate for Congress in the 12th Dis
trict.said,"l'm glad he did it.[but] it's cer
tainly not complete. Deserters and those
with less than honorable discharges still
haven't been dealt with and they have to
be dealt with."
"1 find it astounding." continued Har
ris, who spent 18 months in federal pres
ent for refusing induction, "that 15 years
after the war started, the only issue the
country's discussing is whether we're still
criminals for having opposed it."
In his own case. Harris said. "I don't
want to be forgiven. I wasn't wrong. And
neither were all those who refused to be
called up."
