# Thrown off the scent
## STUDY SHOWS EFFECTS OF ODORS — AS LONG AS WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE SMELLING THEM 
### RACHEL WHELAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When you show up with flowers on
Valentine's Day, you might do
well to stand back a little bit. A
recent study from Northwestern University
finds that whether or not we like someone
can be instantly determined by scents — as
long as we aren't consciously aware of them.
"We evaluate people every day and make
judgments about who we like or don't like,"
says Wen Li, lead author of the study. "We
may think our judgments are based only on
various conscious bits of information, but our
senses also may provide subliminal perceptu
al information that affects our behavior."
Thirty-one undergraduate students volun
teered to sniff a line-up of bottles containing
either citral ("lemon"), anisole ("ethereal").

or valeric acid ("sweat") before rating the
likeability of neutral faces.
The twist? The researchers made sure the
concentration of chemical in the bottle was so
low that the students were unaware of what
they were smelling.
Once a participant had taken a whiff of a
bottle, he or she saw a photograph of a neu
tral face flash across a computer screen for lit
tle over a second. On a scale of "extremely
likeable" to "extremely unlikeable," the stu
dents gave each face a rating.
After inhaling the citral scent, the partici
pants rated the neutral faces as more likeable,
whereas breathing the scent of valeric acid
made the participants rate the faces as less
likeable.
F3ut this effect only held if participants
couldn't smell the subliminal scents at all.The
better a participant said he or she could sense
the odor, the less likely he or she was to be bi
ased by it.

So what's going on?
"The study suggests that people conscious
of the barely noticeable scents were able to
discount that sensory information and just
evaluate the faces," said Dr. Li. "It only was
when smell sneaked in without being noticed
that judgments about likeability were bi
ased."
Top-down processing, in which thoughts
or expectations influence perception instead
of the other way around, appears to be re
sponsible.
This experiment is only the newest in a
line of studies examining top-down process
ing of subliminal sensory information. A pre
vious study on the priming effects of sublimi
nal images has shown that when people are
aware that one image is supposed to influ
ence their reaction to another, they self-cor
rect for this bias by neutralizing or even re
versing their responses. In other words, the
more aware we are of a sensory experience

like a picture or an odor, the greater chance
we have of using cognition to control how we
perceive it.
Whether or not we consciously sense an
odor, our bodies automatically pick up on it.
When the researchers hooked up half of their
participants to heart rate monitors during the
study, they found that odor-evoked changes
in heart rate were exactly the same whether
or not the participants were conscious of the
scent. Interestingly, inhaling the unpleasant
smell of sweat makes the heart beat faster
than inhaling pleasant or neutral scents like
citral and anisole.This may indicate a special
ized channel within the olfactory system for
odors from a threatening source.
But if we've safeguarded the ability to
react to subliminal odors, why don't we have
the ability to sense them like other, more ol
factorily-gifted mammals? If we were fully
conscious of all of the sensory information in
our environment, we would face a barrage of
sights, sounds and smells that would
prevent us from paying attention to
what is truly important. Here, top
down processing comes to the rescue
so that we don't have to give a mo
ment's thought to filtering the on
slaught of information.
Given that the olfactory system
has a direct anatomical connection
to the limbic brain structures, the
headquarters of emotion and memo
ry. it is not surprising that scents play
such a large role in determining who
we do and do not like.
"Our study offers direct evidence
that human social behavior is under
the influence of minuscule amounts
of odor, at concentrations too low to
be consciously perceived, indicating
that the human sense of smell is much
keener than commonly thought,"
says Jay Gottfried, tine of there

searchers.
In fact, humans can differentiate
between about 10.(KX) odors, even be
tween those that differ by no more
than an atom. Previous research has
already established that odors can in
fluence mood, thought and even mate
selection, but Dr. Li is the first to show
that even subliminal scents far below
detection levels can impact social be
havior and, in fact, can have a greater
impact than supraliminal scents.
Now that we know about the ef
fect of subliminal scents, can we ma
nipulate them? TTie researchers al
ready have some ideas in mind, in
cluding making business meetings
more amicable by permeating a
room with a sweet fragrance, initiat
ing fights by releasing an unpleasant
odor and intensifying movie experi
ences in scent-filled cinemas. If sub
liminal scents start making their way
into new corners of our lives, we
might never know.
