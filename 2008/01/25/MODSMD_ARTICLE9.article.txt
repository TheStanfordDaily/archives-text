# Hip Hop movement

### CHELSEA MA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hip hop today seems smothered by
fast cars, scantily clad women and
too much money. It screams chau
vinism and materialism — even
Wikipedia claims that it's the fa
ther of the term "bling-bling." But true
lovers of the music know that this view is
skewed, even entirely misrepresentative.
Real hip hop has social and artistic roots.

and a group of students on campus is try
ing to dig these up.
Jeff Mendelman '09 began transform
ing his thoughts into music after volun
teering in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina.
"When I went down there,there was no
movement," he said,"and I felt that what I
could do coming hack here was to put
what I learned in a format that people
could really approach."
That format was hip hop. and out of it
came tracks such as "Broken," "On Re
flection" and. Mendelman's most well
known. "Dear Mr. Bush." The melody is
reminiscent of rap. the lyrics a reflection of
the duality of hope and hopelessness,
questioning what was done and what
could have been done in New Orleans.
"'Broken' defined the mindset of a lot
of people after the hurricane." Mendel
man said. "[The song) is trying to flip that
mentality and say that,yeah, this is a horri
ble evil, but when you tight the evil, that's
righteousness. The songs shed light on
what people can do to help out and create
change — that's the most important part."
By making his albums available for pur
chase, Mendelman wants to tell others that
hip hop can — and once did — have its
place in current events and attitudes. It has
n't always belonged only in the surreal
world of the rich or the macho but in com

munities and individuals. He wants stu
dents to experience this more personal side
of the genre, which is why he launched the
Stanford chapter of Hip Hop Congress —
a worldwide organization — this quarter.
"My goal is to create a Stanford group
that unifies the hip hop artist community,
as well as educates the rest of the Stanford
community on the essence of hip hop and
how it can transform a dormant or un
aware society," he said.
The organization aims to return hip
hop to its original form as an outlet for so
cial activism combined with music, dance
and graphic arts.
"I wanted to work towards promoting
hip hop as a cultural expression instead of
a commercialized trend." said Josh Cons
tine '07, a graduate student in sociology.
"The Hip Hop Congress has helped me
join forces with fellow music entrepre
neurs like Jeff and allowed me to engage in
stimulating discussions about both hip hop
as a legitimate art form and as a vehicle for
the glamorization of harmful stereotypes
and behaviors."
The group hopes to join the Stanford
Concert Network (SCN) and Student Or
ganizing Committee for the Arts (SOC'A)
in giving stKially conscious hip hop artists a
chance to perform. It also plans on teaming
up with student artists and other campus
organizations, such as the TVoposomatic

be a visible part of
Stanford. This is
really just to unify
people and get
people to network
with each othec,
