January 28,1932: Bull
Session: Should Women
Vote?
Today, the eighteenth amend
ment has become so popular — or so
notorious that most people forget
that the Constitution also has several
other amendments. One of these is
the nineteenth amendment which
gives women the right to vote. Dur
ing the long and continued agitation
for this right,it was held that with the
vote in the hands of the better-half,
politics would become 99 and 44/100
percent pure. It was felt that we
would then elect "The Cream of the
Crop." In fact, the golden era of
democracy was to be ushered in with
the advent of women's voting.
And what a disillusionment. In
stead of improving politics, women
have done little hut add another type
of campaign bunk to the long list al
ready tolerated by men. While male
reformers were trying to keep the
wolf of corruption from the political
door, sentimentality flew in the win
dow. Yet it did not fly in, rather it just
poured in — an irresistible mess of
molasses, honey, and homemade
taffy. Did the women try to clean up
or dam the flow? On the contrary,
they just lap it up and cry for more.
Talk about homes and firesides and
children is just custom made for
women voters.
