# Emissions Debate:
## California sues EPA 
### KT MERTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ihe Environmental Protection Agency's
(EPA) December decision to prevent Califor
nia from regulating automobile emissions be
yond national standards puzzled many. Confusion
didn't stall the state for long, however: California —
along with 15 other states and several environmental
groups — rang in the New Year by taking the EPA to
court.
Under the Clean Air Act (CAA),states may estab
lish their own air pollutant regulations, but only after
obtaining a waiver from the EPA. Although the
Agency requires "extraordinary and compelling con
ditions" before it will grant a waiver, California has
historically met these requirements with little trouble.
In fact, the EPA has granted the state nearly 50 CAA
waivers over the past 30 years.
I"he current lawsuit began with a California law
passed in 2002, which required in-state automobiles to
meet reduced emissions standards by 2009. California
requested a CAA waiver allowing it to regulate
tailpipe emissions more strictly than the national
standard. Without the EPA-approved waiver, Califo
rnia has no legal authority to enforce its law.
The EPA delayed its response until the resolution
of Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA, con
cerning the regulation of carbon dioxide, a significant
greenhouse gas.
In this case, the EPA argued that the CAA was de
signed to deal with local air pollutants, not substances
distributed throughout the entire atmosphere, Hie
EPA also made the case that, because regulating

greenhouse gases would have extensive economic
effects, it could not do so unless specifically directed
by Congress. Arid since a primary approach to reduc
ing carbon dioxide emissions is through fuel econo
my standards — a job Congress assigned to the De
partment of Transportation — the Agency claimed it
lacked the authority to regulate the substance at all.
Despite these arguments, in April
2007 the Supreme Court declared
the EPA free to regulate carbon
dioxide emissions. Hence the near
universal surprise when, mere
months later, the Agency denied
California's CAA waiver.
According to EPA Administrator
Stephen Johnson, a national fuel econo
my policy — such as the recently passed En
ergy Independence and Security Act of 2007 — is a
more sensible approach for a global problem than a
patchwork of different and contradictory state regula
tions.
Some, however, suspect another reason behind the
EPAs denial. Because the states that might follow Cal
ifornia's lead make up nearly 50 percent of the auto
mobile market, automakers could be forced into mak
ing all cars meet the stricter emissions standards.
Growing concerns that the EPA was influenced by in
dustry groups have led to a Congressional inquiry. Last
week, Johnson met with the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee (chaired by California's Bar
bara Boxer) to offer testimony about last December's
decision.
California citizens and scientists responded strong
ly to Johnson's claim that greenhouse gas emissions
should be regulated solely on a national basis.
Earlier this month. Mark Jacobson, professor of civil

and
environmental engineering, re-

leased the first scientific study to link human mor
tality with the higher levels of ozone, particles and
carcinogens caused by increased carbon dioxide.

According to Jacobson. human health effects will
likely be most severe where air pollution is already
high. In California — which ranks among the worst in
the nation for smog,soot and cities with polluted air —
this could mean hundreds more deaths each year from
heart attacks, asthma and similar diseases.
As evidence that California will be disproportion
ately affected by global warming comes to light, Jacob
son's work directly contradicts the EPA's reasoning for
its December decision. The study will likely serve as
ammunition for advocates of tougher emissions stan
dards in the legal battle ahead.
