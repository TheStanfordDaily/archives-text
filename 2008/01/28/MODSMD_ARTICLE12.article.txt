## Obama says landslide win in South Carolina marks a turn in party history 
### CHARLES BABINGTON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP)-
Democrat Barack Ohama said Sun
day that his landslide win in South
Carolina's presidential primary
marks a turn in political history,
showing that a black candidate can
appeal to voters of all colors and in
all regions.
The Illinois senator told a rau
cous crowd of more than 9,000 here
that his hig victory Saturday dis
proved the old notion "that if you
get black votes, you can't get white
votes," and vice versa.
"We're going to write a new chap
ter in the South, we're going to write
a new chapter in American history."
he said during his 64-minute speech
to a capacity crowd at the University
of Alabama at Birmingham basket

ball arena. The crowd was roughly
two-thirds black and one-third
white.
Earlier Sunday he made a similar
argument, responding to comments
by former President Clinton that
some interpreted as an effort to di
minish Obama's win Saturday over
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Bill Clin
ton noted that Jesse Jackson won the
South Carolina primary in 1984 and
1988. Jackson never became the
party's presidential nominee.
Obama, speaking during a televi
sion interview, said "there's no
doubt" that Jackson set a precedent
for blacks seeking the presidency. But
he noted that was two decades ago.
"I think that what we saw in this
election was a shift in South Caroli
na," he said, with implications "all
across the country. I think people
want change. I think they want to get
beyond some of the racial politics
that, you know, has been so domi
nant in the past."
Obama resisted being drawn into
a spat with the Clintons.even though
he suggested they are part of a polit
ical past the country is ready to leave

behind.
"I think that Bill Clinton did im
portant work back in the 19905," he
said. ''The question is. now we're in
2008. and how do we move it for
ward to the next phase?"
Later, speaking with reporters
during a flight from Georgia to Al
abama, Obama said. "I think the
country wants to look forward, and
that has always been the central the
sis of our campaign."
He said Hillary Clinton will have
an advantage in the sprawling race
on Feb. 5. when Democrats vote in
22 states, because of her nearly uni
versal name recognition."lt presents
more of a challenge for us." he said,
because he needs time for voters to
get to know him.
As Obama campaigned in Geor
gia and Alabama, party officials con
firmed that Massachusetts Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy planned to endorse
him Monday in Washington. Obama
was endorsed during the weekend
by Caroline Kennedy, the senator's
niece and daughter of the late Presi
dent Kennedy.
In Macon, Ga., Obama spoke for

about a half hour to about 1.000 peo
ple at the interracial and interde
nominational Harvest Cathedral.
He talked about how he became a
committed Christian as a young man
in Chicago after rarely attending
church as a child.
On his first visit to the church he
now belongs to. Trinity United
Church of Christ in Chicago. Obama
said, "I was introduced to Jesus in a
way 1 had never been before."
Part of his mission as a politician,
he said, is "to go out and do the
Lord's work."
Recounting the biblical story of
the Good Samaritan, Obama said,
"Our commitment cannot rest so
long as we are still divided by race"
and have homeless veterans, poor
schools, uninsured people and un
employed workers.
Georgia and Alabama are among

the 15 states holding Democratic
primaries on Feb. 5. Seven other
states hold Democratic caucuses
that day.
