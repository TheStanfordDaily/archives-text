In the Jan. 21 article "Songwriter
finding the sun. spotlight," The Daily
inaccurately reported that Crystal
City is a Stanford band. While the
band features some Stanford students
as members, it is not entirely com
prised of students, and Crystal City
bassist Stephen Lorek did not found
the rock band Pipeline with Will Agee
'09, as The Daily initially reported. In
addition. The Daily mistakenly re
ferred to Crystal City's song "Forev
er's Too Long" as "Forever Is Too
Long."
