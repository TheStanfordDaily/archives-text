## Editorial Board A 						dubious solution to an impending recession 
### 
The White I louse and Congress have ap
proved a tax refund plan that is meant
to stimulate much needed consumer
spending in the economy.The stimulus pack
age. amounting to $150 billion, will be broad
ly distributed to some 117 million American
households and businesses. Politicians rang
ing from President George W. Bush to I louse
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressed
the wish to disburse the funds immediately.
This exhibition of urgency and swiftness, all
too unaccustomed behavior on the Hill these
days, has the explicit purpose of limiting the
impact of the recession.
But is the recession a foregone conclu
sion? Many financial firms believe we're al
ready in a recession. That is a particularity of
the phenomenon, that business downturns
are only verified after they are underway.
Their occurrence and magnitude are as hard
to pin down as the roadrunner of our cartoon
days, pursued by Wiley Coyote market fore
casters who use the most sophisticated tech
nology to model something that remains elu
sive. These forecasters are as skeptical on the
proposed package tunneling out of the gov
ernment as they are of the economy. Perhaps
the package is doing more harm than good;
perhaps the mere action of dousing a fire after
noticing smoke only serves as an accelerant.
After all. the subprime mortgage crisis that
initiated the supposed downturn is not being
felt by all. To a certain extent, the losses in
curred are localized to recent home buyers
and home loan investors.These actors in soci
ety will certainly see a difficult future to come,
but this fate should not necessary befall the
outsiders. If consumers don't see a recession
as imminent — and therefore spend with a
cautious but optimistic outlook — then per
haps the injury to the economy will be less
than expected. Consumers, though, may be
persuaded by rhetoric to the contrary. Once
the belief in recession is set in. everyday citi
zens stop spending, businesses cut back their
inventory, investors become speculative even
on promising endeavors, and the once health
ily churning wheel of industry slows to a
standstill.

For all the talk of saving impending doom,
the economic stimulus package merely whim
pers. Few analysts believe that the tax rebates,
amounting to about one percent of the annu
al U.S. gross domestic product, will make
much of a difference at all. Many have dis
missed the move as a political one, allowing
our elected officials to feel as if they are at
least doing something to stem the fallout. In
deed. if the package serves to seal a federal
stamp of inevitability on the recession, most
of the refund may end up sitting in American
savings accounts. After all. if our leadership
thinks times will be had. maybe it would be
better not to take that summer trip abroad
after all.The dollar is not doing so hot anyway.
Of course, the uncertain outcome of this
particular package does not mean all govern
mental packages should he written off. If the
refund were tweaked, perhaps the effect
would be more powerful. For instance, instead
of broadly dispersing funds to American
households the rebates could be targeted to
those suffering at the hands of the crisis. Per
haps leaving white-collar financial services
workers aside, the money could go to low-in
come households in dire need of the cash in
flux. These consumers would much more like
ly spend a large portion the money given to
them, as their benefit from consuming is much
higher than middle-income or high-income
families. Since the primary objective of the
stimulus package is to get people to spend,
this targeted approach might be the key.

Critics would likely point to the moral haz
ard of this policy. After all, the Americans that
would he receiving the tax refunds are the
very ones who made the had decision to take
out loans they would not be ahle to pay. Per
haps writing them a fat check does not en
courage the best future behavior.To them, we
say that protecting a weak economy is the
greater good. If changing the stimulus pack
age results in effective policy, then not follow
ing through just forces everyone to suffer.
And as the government's rhetoric has already
done its damage to the American psyche, we
must ensure that the implementation of any
plan prompts a gentle landing.
