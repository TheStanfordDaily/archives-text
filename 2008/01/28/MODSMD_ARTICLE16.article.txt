## Emancipate yourselves from sexual slavery 
### 
Laura loves sex. And she has no problem
telling you about it. For instance, I re
member walking into Hoover Tower
for one of our tour guiding shifts on some
dreary Wednesday afternoon, and before I
had time to sit down. Laura asked me if I had
any AAA batteries. I ler vibrator had lost
power, and she was dying. She's had 61 differ
ent dates between the months of March and
October (granted, she was on the rebound),
and not all of them were G-rated. She even
had a vagina cake for her birthday. So when
talk ventures to the topic of female sexual lib
eration. Laura is the first person who comes
to mind — no pun intended.
Laura is a rarity within our society. Her
freedom in talking about sex catches most
people off guard. And while the media be
comes increasingly sexualized, it's still taboo
to talk about one's own sex life as casually as
one might talk about sports or the stars that
scandalize our tabloids. For the most part,our
society still makes us feel guilty about sex —
whether it be by ourselves, with a significant
other, or with a complete stranger.
The question is: Why do we still feel so
guilty about sex? This guilt contrasts sharply
with a brilliant point I .aura articulated during
our coffee date: "We're all human and we all
want sex. Everyone's doing it — or if they're
not doing it. they wish they were."
What surprised me the most when I asked
Laura this questions was when she revealed
her own guilt about her sexuality. Raised
Catholic and educated at 'a Catholic high
school, the principles she grew up with were
screaming in horror when she first discovered
sexual pleasure, and again when she realized
her attraction to women, liven now, as Laura
outspokenly embraces her sexuality, at her
core she still feels the internalized repri
mands of her childhood indoctrination. Her
strong words are an act of rebellion, tinged by
the guilt of her (now abandoned) religion.
Rebellion isn't the only reason Laura vo
calizes her sexuality. She feels more free to
talk about sex because she is free of a differ
ent kind of guilt — the type.of guilt that
comes from the sexual act itself.
Sex is intimate. It exposes vulnerabilities.
And sometimes, these positives can be ex

ploited for selfish reasons, resulting in guilt on
one or both parties. Guilt because we make
ourselves vulnerable to people we don't real
ly trust. Guilt, perhaps, due to a power ex
change inherent in the sexual act itself.
Laura is free of this type of guilt because
she characterizes her own sexual experience
as completely different. She has only ever
been with women.and she feels like every sex
ual experience she has had reflected mutual
respect, power and emotional investment. I've
read of studies that claim that women form
emotional and chemical bonds with the peo
ple they sleep with. So if women bond and
(perhaps) men don't, this could be the source
of this mysterious guilt, at least in a heterosex
ual relationship. In contrast, Laura bonds with
the women she sleeps with and vice versa —
even if it is only a one night stand.
People feel guilty about sex due to a com
bination of social pressures, motivations, and
our own biological nature. I lowever.if it's our
own human nature that also drives our desire
to have sex. we've reached a contradiction.
When it comes down to it, I'm not sure
whether or not we should feel guilty about
sex, but we should at least understand the rea
sons why we feel the way we do in regards to
such an important aspect of our lives.
Laura recognizes the conflict between the
way she feels and her own rationale, and she
chooses to overcome it with her own conflict:
she rebels against her repressed guilt by
speaking out about sex. In speaking out, she
hopes her words will make her own sexual
empowerment that much stronger, and in
doing so she gives me the strength I need to
embrace my own sexuality.
