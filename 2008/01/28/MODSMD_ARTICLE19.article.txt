# Little Ms. Modern
## Faith in the landscape of modernity 
### 
What place does religion have in mod
ern society? If I were feeling especial
ly snarky (and lazy), 1 could end this
column at twenty-nine words with a simple an
swer: none. But my editors generally prefer a
word count of six to eight hundred, and despite
my personal inclination towards atheism. I
think there is more to he said.
In fact, there is so much more to he said that
I won't feign to he well enough equipped to
properly cover the topic. Like most things I
write about, there are plenty of experts who
are far more informed about the subject of re
ligion than 1 am. What makes the question of
faith in the landscape of modernity especially
intriguing, however, is that even the experts
cannot begin to agree.
One purported expert is geneticist Francis
Collins, the head of the Human Genome Pro
ject and a prominent spokesperson for the
evangelical Christian faith, who will also be
speaking here at Stanford next week. Unlike
some of the more old-fashioned and abrasive
proponents of religion. Collins' (modestly)
progressive worldview allows for a harmo
nious — and even complementary — coexis
tence of science and faith. Ibis distinction is
significant. Historically, and even today, the
church has forced followers to renounce the
findings of science that contradict the teach
ings of the Bible, thus alienating most of the
more analytically minded population. 'Che
newer attitude promoted by Collins has a far
more widespread, modern appeal.
In its generous ideological accommoda
tion, it also makes for a brilliant marketing
strategy. Rather than engaging in a losing bat
tle against modernity, Collins and his support
ers have repackaged their product to sell in
modern times. There is much debate about
whether faith can indeed be integrated so
seamlessly with science, with dissent from both
the faithful and scientific camps. I'll leave this
discussion for the likes of Richard Hawkins.
Mike Huckabce and you, readers, mostly be
cause I am neither a scientist nor a theologian
and my contribution would therefore be ama
teur at best.
But frankly, beyond the issue of God/sci
ence compatibility, I am startled by something
much more basic about the Collins approach
to religion: modernization. Faith strikes me as
so fundamentally antithetical to modernity
that any attempt to reconcile the two seems
surreally comical. While modern times are
characterized by the demise of tradition and
the celebration of clarity of thought, the reli
gious worldview is defined by a continuity of
ritual and an embrace of mysticism. While
modernity embodies upheaval, religion en
courages obedience. And while the modern
condition nurtures the power of the individual,
the religious domain promotes her sub
servience to a greater force.
My fellow New Jerseyan Kevin Smith ap
pears to see the comic surrealism as well. In

Smith's facetious 1999 film "Dogma," a mis
guided effort to modernize the Catholic
Church's image unfolds through a campaign
entitled,"Catholicism Wow!" Complete with a
revamped."less depressing" and utterly absurd
Jesus figure bearing the name "Buddy Christ,"
the attempt at Catholic modernization is por
trayed by Smith as both silly and hopeless.
The Collins version of modernized religion
is admittedly less ridiculous. In his book "The
Language of God," he at least ostensibly ac
knowledges the possible conflict: "The poten
tial synthesis of the scientific and spiritual
worldviews is assumed by many in modern
times to be an impossibility, rather like trying
to force two poles of a magnet together in the
same spot." As with much pop science writing,
however,that cutesy physics simile rubs me the
wrong way — it's gratuitous and gimmicky,
and it seems to exploit the certainty of science
to affect an unqualified tone of truth.

Actually, this kind of technique seems to
make up much of Collins' baseline argument,
which goes along the lines of, "I am a famous,
successful scientist, so you can trust that I am
right. And I'm telling you, God is real!" This
might be convincing to some, but it certainly is
not to an egomaniacal Stanford graduate stu
dent who knows firsthand how crappy this rea
soning is because she uses it herself all the time.
("Oooh.so I actually have a degree in this
is my preferred way to tell people that their
taste in architecture sucks.)
This isn't to say that Collins doesn't have
any subtle, substantive and ultimately persua
sive ways to make his case. In fact, I would as
sume that he does — his book and other work
highlighting his faith have garnered enough at
tention from respectable sources to preclude
him from being a total quack. For me, this de
cently regarded reputation is impressive in it
self. Regardless of whether he is right, Collins
has somehow succeeded in giving mankind's
most anti-modern institution a convincing
chance at a new life in the stark and sterile
landscape of modernity.

alike to attend the Francis Collins talk on Feb. 5!
