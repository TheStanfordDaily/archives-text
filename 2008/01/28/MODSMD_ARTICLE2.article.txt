# Atheist disputes intelligent design
## Christopher Hitchens takes on creation advocate Jay Richards in debate over maker of universe 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
During an animated debate yesterday
in a packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium, athe
ist Christopher Hitchens and intelligent
design advocate Jay Richards clashed over
the evidence for God's existence.
"There are no atheists in foxholes, but
there are plenty in universities," said host
Ben Stein, famous for his role as the dull
economics teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day
Off. during "Atheism vs. Theism and the
Scientific Evidence of Intelligent Design."
"We are luckv — blessed, 1 would say

— to have two extremely smart people
here today," Stein said, giving both partici
pants 14 minutes for their opening re
marks.
"I can't imagine it'll take me 14 minutes
to demolish intelligent design, as I refuse
to call it," began Hitchens, the author of the
2007 bestseller "God is Not Great."
He cited the existence of evil as evi
dence against a benevolent designer.
"If everything was designed," Hitchens
asked,"what are we to make of the design
er who has subjected so many generations
to barbarism, misery, ignorance,slav
ery and early death?"
He added that any person who
looked to nature as evidence for de
sign must contend with the fact that
l ) 8 percent of all species that have
ever existed are extinct.
"Whose design?" asked Hitchens,
to applause from many audience
members, including a dozen wearing
"Atheists of Silicon Valley" T-shirts.
"What kind of design? What kind of
caprice, what kind of incompetence,
what kind of cruelty?'
Richards congratulated Hitchens
on his rhetoric, but dismissed the
atheist's perspective.
"A sneer is not an argument," said
Richards, a program director for the
intelligent design think tank Discov
ery Institute.
Richards encouraged the audi
ence to see atheism and theism as
two competing hypotheses,saying he
would lay out "a laundry list of facts,"
and ask whether they fit better in an
atheistic or theistic worldview.
For theists, "there is a personal
being, a transcendent, eternal, per
sonal being," Richards said. "This
being is by definition goodness and
love." %
As his first evidence for theism,
Richards argued that all people feel
"simple moral truths."
"We all know that it's wrong to
torture little children just for the fun

of it,"he said.
The fact that nature seems to be
organized rationally and mathemati
cally suggests evidence for theism,
Richards said, as does the "fine-tun
ing principle" — the idea that the
laws of the universe are set up just
right to allow for life. He added that
the universe's inception at the Big
Bang is also evidence for a creator.
"Anything that begins to exist
must have a cause for its beginning,"
Richards said.
The intelligent design advocate
next appealed to "irreducible com
plexity," one of intelligent design's
central tenets. He cited the bacterial
flagellum and the cascade of blood
clotting factors,saying that they must

be designed because they need all of
their parts at once to work and could
not evolve little-by-little.
"Processes that require foresight
are inaccessible to natural selec
tion." Richards said.
Hitchens then requested the
chance to ask Richards a question.
"Do you believe Jesus Christ was
born of a virgin?" he asked when
Richards assented. "Do you believe
he was resurrected from the dead?"
Richards said that he did.
"I rest my case," said Hitchens.
"This is an honest guy. who has just
made it very clear [that] science has
nothing to do with his world view."
Stein interrupted with a question
for Hitchens.

"Many people are deeply reli
gious." he said. "Are they just stupid
er than you?"
"1 think 1 am smarter than most
people." Hitchens said, but he added
that religion plays an important part
in human history.
"Religion was our first try at phi
losophy, it was our first try at episte
mology. It's what we came up with
when we didn't know we lived on a
round planet circling the sun."
'Hie event was broadcast by the
Church Communication Network to
churches around the country. Listen
ers could send questions via fax or
email, and audience members at
Stanford could turn in written ques
tions to be answered by the debaters.
Richards stated that just as the
designers of Mt. Rushmore made the
monument very different from the
hills around it. "intelligent agents
leave markers for their design."
"The existence of a creator God is
something we can discern from the
world around us," he concluded.
Hitchens disagreed.
"The world as we know it works
as the world might be expected to
work if it did not have a designer." he
concluded. "We can finally grow up if
we resign ourselves to this increas
ingly inescapable truth."
The event was sponsored by The
Stanford Review, the Intelligent De
sign and Evolution Awareness club
and Vox Clara: A Journal of Christ
ian Thought at Stanford.
