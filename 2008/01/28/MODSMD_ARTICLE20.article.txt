## Our jihad to reform: The struggle to define our faith 
### 
Recent events in the Muslim world raise
urgent concerns and questions about the
state of Islam in today's world. Acts of
terrorism committed "in the name of Islam"

the Christian experience of reformation since
the 15th century in Europe.The Muslim world
does not share the historical and theological
contexts that shaped Western reform. As such,
we are in need of unique Islamic reform that
draws on the long forgotten and corrupted
principles articulated in the Koran and by
Prophet Muhammad.The injustices committed
in the name of our religion, coupled with igno
