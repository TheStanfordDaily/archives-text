## Our jihad to reform: The struggle to define our faith 
### 
Recent events in the Muslim world raise
urgent concerns and questions about the
state of Islam in today's world. Acts of
terrorism committed "in the name of Islam"
aside, both the Saudi rape case and the Sudan
teddy-bear-teacher incident are disturbing ex
amples of the troubling conditions of the glob
al Muslim community.
In the Saudi rape case, the rape victim was
sentenced to a much harsher punishment (prior
to her pardon) for indecency and having an il
licit affair than were the men who gang-raped
her. 'lhis decision raises questions about the in
justice of an oppressive and patriarchal Saudi
government that dubiously claims to be Islam
ic in both letter and spirit.
Perhaps even more disturbing is the case of
the British teacher in Sudan who was initially
sentenced (again, before being pardoned) to
imprisonment and lashing for allowing her stu
dents to name a teddy bear "Muhammad."
More alarming than the sentence were the
mobs of Sudanese Muslims displaying their
"piety," as they called for the teacher's death.

Ibis scene of angry and intolerant mobs mir
rors a picture-perfect Hollywood scripting of
Samuel Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations."
For reflective Muslims, these events illus
trate the betrayal of fundamental moral princi
ples laid down by the Koran and by our beloved
Prophet Muhammad. These incidents beg the
question that Stanford Muslims hope to ad
dress in the coming weeks: Is the Muslim world
in need of reform?
Ihe answer seems to be an obvious yes. Yet
when one hears "reform," we are reminded of
the Christian experience of reformation since
the 15th century in Europe.The Muslim world
does not share the historical and theological
contexts that shaped Western reform. As such,
we are in need of unique Islamic reform that
draws on the long forgotten and corrupted
principles articulated in the Koran and by
Prophet Muhammad.The injustices committed
in the name of our religion, coupled with igno
rance and intolerance in some of our Muslim
communities, make reform necessary.
Yet such a reform must be inher
ently rooted in Islamic principles and
ideals. Our reform cannot be an at
tempt to appease our colonizers and
masters, because any reform grounded
on the wishes of Western ideologues
(whether Christian fundamentalists or
secular extremists) undermines the ef
fort: rather, it must be based upon our

Islamic principles in a sincere and
faithful attempt to return to the
essence of our religion and fulfill our
duty to question, understand and live
the principles of our faith. The Islamic
notion of reform is not a transforma
tion of the Islamic faith, but a reform of
our understanding and articulation of
our religion. Such a reform is a struggle
to interpret and practice Islam in a way
that is faithful to the texts yet compati
ble with contemporary realities. This
struggle is not only essential if the
Muslim world is to be part of the glob
al community, but it is also true to the
essential Islamic concept of jihad.

Often mistranslated as "holy war,"
the Arabic term jihad literally means"a
struggle." The Islamic concept of jihad
is a fundamental part of the faith that
defines our purpose in life. Submission
to God — the meaning of "Islam" and
our purpose as human beings — is
nothing other than jihad: a constant
struggle to subdue our human capaci
ties of aggression, injustice, greed, hate,
lust, anger, arrogance and to strive to
wards God — an upward spiritual
climb, toilsome and difficult, yet of ab
solute and utmost importance.
Yet the notion of jihad is to struggle
in all senses of the word: internally and

externally, personally, socially and po
litically. Therefore, it is inevitable that
at times this struggle against the lower
tendencies of human nature will be
manifested in military conflict against
injustices, and this is also undeniably a
part of the faith; yet this is only one el
ement of jihad, and arguably of much
lesser importance than the struggle to
reform one's self before all else.
Part of the Muslim jihad, perhaps
the most important after our inner spir
itual struggle, is to understand and live
our faith in a way that is not merely an
external and superficial manifestation
of Islam, but is true to the fundamental

moral principles that are espoused in
our texts. We must be cognizant of con
temporary realities and challenges that
the Muslim world and the global com
munity face, and confront those reali
ties and challenges with an understand
ing of our faith that goes beyond the in
tellectual stagnation that so often
plagues our community.
Some of the biggest such challenges
that the Muslim world must face up to
in today's world are those of intoler
ance and coexistence, extremism and
terrorism, patriarchy and women's
rights,and the role ofShariah (Islamic
law) in governance. To confront such

challenges is our jihad. And that is ex
actly what the Muslim community at
Stanford is doing. During Islam
Awareness Series 2008. which runs
from Jan. 31 to Feb 24. we will have
some of the most profound scholars of
Islam in the nation tackle these issues
and offer their insight as to our present
situation and where we are headed.
