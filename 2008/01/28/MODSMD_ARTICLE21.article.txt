## Cardinal just keeps winning 
### 
Stanford may be one of the least
impressive 16-3 teams out
there. Forget everything I just
wrote except for the "16-3," though.
Because those numbers are all that
matter.
Nearly halfway into the Pac-10
season, the Cardinal has simply got
the job done; surprisingly enough,
the team sits tied for second place
with Washington State, just one game
behind 1(1 \
In an era which prefers flashiness
to fundamentals, dunks to defense
and O.J. Mayo to Kevin Love, this
Stanford squad has been a throw
back living up to the mantra of the
esteemed Raiders owner, Al Davis:
"Just win. baby."
What may be even more remark
able is where the Cardinal's produc
tion has come from. While Anthony
Goods and Lawrence Hill carried
the team to its NCAA berth last sea
son with their hot shooting, both
have been mired in season-long
slumps. Instead of relying on spurts
of shooting, however, the team has
won the old-fashioned way this year
with hard-nosed defense and big
time play in the post.

The Cardinal is not quicker than
any of its opponents. They rarely
have better shooting (at least this
year), and it's even rarer to see the
team match up against a less athletic
opponent. But steady point guard
play, quality minutes from the bench
and Brook Lopez have this team
solidly ranked in the nation's top 20.

Stanford has won nearly every
game it was supposed to this year
(save for the debacle at Siena, of
course). In an age of college basket
ball filled with endless parity, a lot
can be said for a team handling busi
ness when it's supposed to.
Much of the credit simply has to
go to coach Trent Johnson, however.
While I've been skeptical of his
coaching every since he set foot on
campus and had a mediocre season
with Mike Montgomery's players. I
certainly can't complain about the
team's results this season. Although
the play has looked ugly at times this
year, he's succeeded in the greatest
mark of a coach: he's just won.
The Cardinal is well on its way to
20 wins and another tournament
berth for Trent Johnson. If the team
continues to"just win." they may find
themselves with a five seed or better
in the NCAA Tournament come
March.
