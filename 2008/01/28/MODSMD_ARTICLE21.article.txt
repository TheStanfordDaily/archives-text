## Cardinal just keeps winning 
### 
Stanford may be one of the least
impressive 16-3 teams out
there. Forget everything I just
wrote except for the "16-3," though.
Because those numbers are all that
matter.
Nearly halfway into the Pac-10
season, the Cardinal has simply got
the job done; surprisingly enough,
the team sits tied for second place
with Washington State, just one game
behind 1(1 \
In an era which prefers flashiness
to fundamentals, dunks to defense
and O.J. Mayo to Kevin Love, this
Stanford squad has been a throw
back living up to the mantra of the
esteemed Raiders owner, Al Davis:
"Just win. baby."
What may be even more remark
able is where the Cardinal's produc
tion has come from. While Anthony
Goods and Lawrence Hill carried
the team to its NCAA berth last sea
son with their hot shooting, both
have been mired in season-long
slumps. Instead of relying on spurts
of shooting, however, the team has
won the old-fashioned way this year
with hard-nosed defense and big
time play in the post.

The Cardinal is not quicker than
any of its opponents. They rarely
have better shooting (at least this
year), and it's even rarer to see the
team match up against a less athletic
opponent. But steady point guard
play, quality minutes from the bench
and Brook Lopez have this team
solidly ranked in the nation's top 20.

Stanford has won nearly every
game it was supposed to this year
(save for the debacle at Siena, of
course). In an age of college basket
ball filled with endless parity, a lot
can be said for a team handling busi
ness when it's supposed to.
Much of the credit simply has to
go to coach Trent Johnson, however.
While I've been skeptical of his
coaching every since he set foot on
campus and had a mediocre season
with Mike Montgomery's players. I
certainly can't complain about the
team's results this season. Although
the play has looked ugly at times this
year, he's succeeded in the greatest
mark of a coach: he's just won.
The Cardinal is well on its way to
20 wins and another tournament
berth for Trent Johnson. If the team
continues to"just win." they may find
themselves with a five seed or better
in the NCAA Tournament come
March.

Sophomore Evan Romero and the rest of his teammates are fresh off a split this past weekend against Cal State Norfhridge
and UC-Santa Barbara. The volleyball team will next take to the court this Thursday at home against Pacific.
Around College Basketball
— This past weekend couldn't have
been better for Stanford basketball:
both the men and women got wins
over archrival California. While the
men's game went down to the wire,
the No. 8 women won in convincing
fashion, crushing the No. 7 Golden
Bears by 20 in a revenge game that
keeps them near the driver's seat in
the Pac-10. Stanford fans probably
couldn't have hoped for a better
combined start to the year for the
teams: both are currently second
place in the Pac-10.
— Ilie two undefeated teams re
maining— No. 1 Memphis and No. 2
Kansas — have legitimate shots of
going undefeated before the start of
the NCAA Tournament. Memphis
has a much better chance, seeing as
they play in the abominable Confer
ence USA. That being said, the
Tigers have proven themselves with
a tough non-conference schedule

and are the most talented team in
the country. Kansas may be just as
good or even better, but I'd expect
them to trip up somewhere down the
road in the Big 12.
— Despite those who have claimed
that the Pac-10 is the nation's best
conference (myself included), the
conference only has three teams in
the top 25 as of the latest polls. On
top of that, UCLA is probably the
conference's only legitimate nation
al title contender. 1 know that Wash
ington State has been in the top ten
the whole year, but as evidenced by
last year's second-round loss to Van
derbilt, they'll be in trouble in the
NCAA Tournament when they face
quicker, more athletic and better
shooting teams (just look at their
loss to Arizona this past weekend).
The conference is still deep and will
get a number of teams into the tour
nament, but I'm not confident that
the conference's top three teams
could hold their own against the top
three of the other major confer
ences.
