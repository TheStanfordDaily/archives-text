match-high Iskills,and
freshman Tanner Nua,
who filled the stat sheet

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 6-3 on the year
and 3-3 in conference. With six wins, the Card
has already won twice as many games as it
won last season. The men will take on Pacific,
and a non-conference opponent, Ball State,
later this week.

the Cardinal battled back to make the score 16-15. Moments
later, a Cardinal service error brought the scorc to 17-17, and the
Matadors' Nua to the service line. Six straight points by North
ridge gave them the edge, and the Matadors ultimately rounded
out the game by the score of 30-25.
"1 think we were playing tentatively,and we just didn't get our
passing going." said senior outside hitter Matt Ceran. "We could
n't push the ball to the net to get our offense going."
in the second game, Stanford jumped out to a 10-5 lead but
could not take advantage of the hot start. Northridge rallied
back to take the lead at 13-12, but Stanford took it back with
three straight kills from Romero to bring the game score to 19-
18. Stanford kept the lead until Northridge made a crucial kill,
making the score 30-29. A Northridge block secured the win at
31-29.
The final game saw the Matadors take a quick lead at 13-8,
forcing a Cardinal timeout. Following the timeout, the Matadors
continued their run, taking four of the next six points and increas
ing their lead to 17-10. A pair of aces by Nua in the final points of
the game sealed the win for the Matadors, 30-24.
"It's early in the season, so we're still trying to figure out our
identity as a team, and still working on polishing our skills,"
Ceran said."lt hurt to lose to a team like that, so close to us in cal
iber, so we were motivated to prove ourselves the next night."
And the Cardinal did just that.
After racking in a cumulative hitting percentage of less than
.200 in a disappointing loss against Northridge, Stanford re
bounded to record a .414 mark in a decisive victory over UC-
Santa Barbara.
Ceran led the Cardinal with 17 kills, hitting .517 on the match.
Meredith continued his strong showing with 13 kills at a .522 hit-
ting percentage, while junior libero
Jarod Keller posted 12 digs — Ceran
and Romero were not far behind
with eight and seven, respectively.
Sophomore Kawika Shoji had 51 as
sists in yet another 50+ match.
The Gauchos were led by fresh
man Jeff Menzel, who had a match
high 21 kills with a respectable .341
hitting percentage. Menzel also had
one ace, three digs, and two blocks,
racking up a match-high 23.5 points.
Senior Theo Brunner also posted 8
kills without a single error. He hit
.727 for the match.
