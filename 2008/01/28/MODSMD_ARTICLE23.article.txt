## Djokovic takes home first Grand Slam title 
### JOHN PYE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MELBOURNE. Australia —
Novak Djokovic started making
peace with the crowd as soon as
he lifted the trophy. After beating
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 4-6,6-4,6-3,7-
6 (2) Sunday night to win the Aus
tralian Open for his first Grand
Slam title. Djokovic knew a little
public relations was in order.
True, he had kept the Rod
Laver Arena crowd in stitches last
week with his Maria Sharapova
impersonation. But Djokovic also
had upset Roger Federer in the
semifinals and now had eliminat
ed Tsonga. who was riding a great
wave into the title match.
"I know the crowd wanted him
to win more," Djokovic said.
"That's OK. It's all right. I still
love you guys — don't worry. I'm
very, very happy that 1 won my
first Grand Slam here, so hopeful
ly we'll see you here on this stage
a lot more often."
Djokovic felt as if he had to
fight two rivals —the fans and
his opponent — in beating Fed
erer and Tsonga. He frequently
yelled when things went wrong.
"Sometimes, you just can't
control your emotions on the
court,"he said. "I'm still learning.
I'm still young."
The 20-year-old Serb is the
first man other than No. 2 Rafael
Nadal to win a Grand Slam title
from Federer since Marat Safin
won the 2005 Australian Open.
Djokovic said he was under ex
treme pressure to defeat Tsonga,
an unseeded Frenchman who had
beaten four players in the top 14,
including Nadal in straight sets in
the semifinals.
Tsonga's audacious style, re
semblance to Muhammad Ali and
magnificent run in only his fifth
major made him a popular con
tender at Melbourne Park. His
great tale about his Congolese fa
ther witnessing the epic "Rumble
in the Jungle" heavyweight bout
between Ali and George Fore
man in 1974 added to the legend.
The underdog story gained
momentum when Tsonga's fa
ther, Didier, who flew in from
France for the match, stood and
threw four right hooks to cele
brate his son's first-set success.
Djokovic admitted he felt the
heat. But he regrouped after the
first-set barrage and began to
climb back. He did not face a
break point in the second and
third sets. He staved off one cru
cial break point in the fourth be
fore dominating the tiebreaker.
"Coming on against a player
with nothing to lose — he was
going for the shots and he was
very dangerous, especially in the
first set — I was pretty nervous,"
he said.
Tsonga, so aggressive earlier in
the tournament, seemed content
to rally from the baseline, espe
cially after getting passed several
times. The forehands that
whipped past Nadal and kissed
the lines were wayward. And he
netted some of the soft touch vol
leys that gave him easy points
against the Spaniard.
"I was trying to stay with him
because I knew sooner or later,
with my style of game. I could get
in control of the match," Djokovic
said.
With Federer only two majors
shy of Pete Sampras' record 14
Grand Slam titles. Djokovic said
he needed to make the most of
any opportunity.
" Ibis match was especially im

portant because 1 was the favorite
and I knew everybody was ex
pecting me to win,so anything but
the win was a loss," Djokovic said.
"I wanted really to win because I
felt my chance. I wanted to win my
first Grand Slam. Now things are
different."
Djokovic will remain at No. 3
in the rankings behind Federer
and Nadal. Tsonga, ranked 38th
coming into the tournament, will
move up to No. 18 after advancing
past the fourth round for the first
time. He thinks he has the game to
crack the top 10.
"Not everybody can beat play
ers who 1 beat," he said. "It's very
difficult, and 1 did it. So, of course,
I'm confident now."
Tsonga was trying to give
France its first men's Grand Slam
champion since Yannick Noah
won at Roland Garros in 1983.
Djokovic was certain of the cele
brations in his country.
"1 can imagine what is happen
ing on the streets of Belgrade and
Serbia," he said. "This is just
something amazing for us."
Djokovic and his female com
patriots. Ana lvanovic and Jelena
Jankovic, reached the semifinals
at Melbourne Park, repeating
their run at the last French Open,
lvanovic lost Saturday's women's
final in straight sets to Sharapova.
"All the players, the girls,
Jankovic, lvanovic, everybody
who comes from Serbia," he said.
"It's such a small country with not
a big tennis tradition."
Sharapova won her third
Grand Slam title without drop
ping a set in a run that included
wins over former No. 1 Lindsay
Davenport and three of the top
four players.
She ended No. 1 Justine
Benin's 32-match winning streak
in the quarterfinals, then beat
Jankovic in the semis and
lvanovic 7-5, 6-3 for the champi
onship. The victory erased bitter
memories of a 6-1,6-2 loss in the
2007 Australian final.
In doubles. Jonathan Erlich
and Andy Ram became the first
Israeli pair to win a Grand Slam
title, beating France's Michael
Llodra and Arnaud Clement 7-5
7-6(4).
Ukraine sisters Alona and
Kateryna combined for a 2-6,6-1,
6-4 win over Victoria Azarenka of
Belarus and Shahar Peer of Israel
in the women's doubles final.
China's Sun Tiantian com
bined with Serbia's Nenad Zi
monjic to beat Indian pair Sania
Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi 7-6
(4), 6-4 for the mixed doubles
title.
The tournament set a record
for total attendance for an Aus
tralian Open (605,735) and a one
day mark for any Grand Slam
(62,885 on Day 4). It also sot a
record for the latest finish, with
Australia's Lleyton Hewitt finish
ing off 2006 runner-up Marcos
Baghdatis at 4:33 a.m. on the first
Sunday after starting at 11:47 p.m.
Saturday.
Djokovic plans to spend a cou
ple of weeks savoring the title,
then get back to work.
"It's not possible that only one
tournament is changing the histo
ry," he said. "I played amazing
tennis here,so 1 think I absolutely
deserved to win, even against
(Federer) in the semifinals."
"Sure, he's going to come back
in a big style," he added."He's still
planning to be the best player in
the world. We all know how good
he is. We're going to see a lot of
him, of course, this year."

"Coming on against a player
with nothing to lose — he was
going for the shots and he was
very dangerous, especially in the
first set — I was pretty nervous,"
he said.
Tsonga, so aggressive earlier in
the tournament, seemed content
to rally from the baseline, espe
cially after getting passed several
times. The forehands that
whipped past Nadal and kissed
the lines were wayward. And he
netted some of the soft touch vol
leys that gave him easy points
against the Spaniard.
"I was trying to stay with him
because I knew sooner or later,
with my style of game. I could get
in control of the match," Djokovic
said.
With Federer only two majors
shy of Pete Sampras' record 14
Grand Slam titles. Djokovic said
he needed to make the most of
any opportunity.
" Ibis match was especially im

portant because 1 was the favorite
and I knew everybody was ex
pecting me to win,so anything but
the win was a loss," Djokovic said.
"I wanted really to win because I
felt my chance. I wanted to win my
first Grand Slam. Now things are
different."
Djokovic will remain at No. 3
in the rankings behind Federer
and Nadal. Tsonga, ranked 38th
coming into the tournament, will
move up to No. 18 after advancing
past the fourth round for the first
time. He thinks he has the game to
crack the top 10.
"Not everybody can beat play
ers who 1 beat," he said. "It's very
difficult, and 1 did it. So, of course,
I'm confident now."
Tsonga was trying to give
France its first men's Grand Slam
champion since Yannick Noah
won at Roland Garros in 1983.
Djokovic was certain of the cele
brations in his country.
"1 can imagine what is happen
ing on the streets of Belgrade and
Serbia," he said. "This is just
something amazing for us."
Djokovic and his female com
patriots. Ana lvanovic and Jelena
Jankovic, reached the semifinals
at Melbourne Park, repeating
their run at the last French Open,
lvanovic lost Saturday's women's
final in straight sets to Sharapova.
"All the players, the girls,
Jankovic, lvanovic, everybody
who comes from Serbia," he said.
"It's such a small country with not
a big tennis tradition."
Sharapova won her third
Grand Slam title without drop
ping a set in a run that included
wins over former No. 1 Lindsay
Davenport and three of the top
four players.
She ended No. 1 Justine
Benin's 32-match winning streak
in the quarterfinals, then beat
Jankovic in the semis and
lvanovic 7-5, 6-3 for the champi
onship. The victory erased bitter
memories of a 6-1,6-2 loss in the
2007 Australian final.

"It's not possible that only one
tournament is changing the histo

tennis here,so 1 think I absolutely
deserved to win, even against
(Federer) in the semifinals."
"Sure, he's going to come back
in a big style," he added."He's still
planning to be the best player in

MELBOURNE. Australia —
Novak Djokovic started making
peace with the crowd as soon as
he lifted the trophy. After beating
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 4-6,6-4,6-3,7-
6 (2) Sunday night to win the Aus
tralian Open for his first Grand
Slam title. Djokovic knew a little
public relations was in order.
True, he had kept the Rod
Laver Arena crowd in stitches last
week with his Maria Sharapova
impersonation. But Djokovic also
had upset Roger Federer in the
semifinals and now had eliminat
ed Tsonga. who was riding a great
wave into the title match.
"I know the crowd wanted him
to win more," Djokovic said.
"That's OK. It's all right. I still
love you guys — don't worry. I'm
very, very happy that 1 won my
first Grand Slam here, so hopeful
ly we'll see you here on this stage
a lot more often."
Djokovic felt as if he had to
fight two rivals —the fans and
his opponent — in beating Fed
erer and Tsonga. He frequently
yelled when things went wrong.
"Sometimes, you just can't
control your emotions on the
court,"he said. "I'm still learning.
I'm still young."
The 20-year-old Serb is the
first man other than No. 2 Rafael
Nadal to win a Grand Slam title
from Federer since Marat Safin
won the 2005 Australian Open.
Djokovic said he was under ex
treme pressure to defeat Tsonga,
an unseeded Frenchman who had
beaten four players in the top 14,
including Nadal in straight sets in
the semifinals.
Tsonga's audacious style, re
semblance to Muhammad Ali and
magnificent run in only his fifth
major made him a popular con
tender at Melbourne Park. His
great tale about his Congolese fa
ther witnessing the epic "Rumble
in the Jungle" heavyweight bout
between Ali and George Fore
man in 1974 added to the legend.
The underdog story gained
momentum when Tsonga's fa
ther, Didier, who flew in from
France for the match, stood and
threw four right hooks to cele
brate his son's first-set success.
Djokovic admitted he felt the
heat. But he regrouped after the
first-set barrage and began to
climb back. He did not face a
break point in the second and
third sets. He staved off one cru
cial break point in the fourth be
fore dominating the tiebreaker.
"Coming on against a player
with nothing to lose — he was
going for the shots and he was
very dangerous, especially in the
first set — I was pretty nervous,"
he said.
