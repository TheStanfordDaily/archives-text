# Dear Reader,

Stanford is a highly charged atmosphere of intense
academic and social development. We as students
often face challenges in our social interactions, rela
tionships and even coursework.
Thankfully, Stanford offers resources to students fac
ing a wide variety of difficulties, both in and out of the
classroom. Yet these resources are only powerful when

properly utilized by the student body.
There is no doubt that it's difficult to admit being in
need of help. We've been praised all of our lives for our
lawlessness. By reaching out to some of the services listed
below, we as members of this community have an opportu
nity to achieve our highest potential and to truly maximize
our years as Stanford students.

Asking for help is the first and most powerful step. You
can do it. You will succeed!

Warmly,
T. Patrick Cordova '09
ASSU Undergraduate Senator
