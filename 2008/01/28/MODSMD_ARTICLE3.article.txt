" You're going to Tresidder!"
Though Tresidder doesn't quite have
the same ring as Hollywood, the state
ment still stirred student excitement as it
resonated through Roble Parlor on Sat
urday afternoon during the first round of
tryouts for the upcoming "Stanford Idol."
A Farm-themed parody of the hit Fox
television show "American Idol," the pro
gram is in its third year. After a popular
first "season" in 2005, the event took a
hiatus in 2006 and ASSU President Her

shey Avula '08 declared last year's low
turnout an "aberration."
"I was a judge last year," Avula said.
"But it didn't quite come to fruition."
Sponsored by the ASSU, Apple and
Sprint, this year's event looks promising;
18 contestants participated in Saturday's
tryouts, with over 30 more on Sunday.
Over the next month, the participants
will perform at a series of weekly events.
Students will vote for their favorite acts
after each show, and those receiving the
fewest votes will be cut from the pro
gram.The winner of the Feb. 28 finale will
receive a $500 cash prize.
ITiis year's judges include Avula. fel
low 2007 judge Jonathan Grossman '08
and Stacie Chan '10. Jessica Lu '09 re-
placed Grossman, who judged on
vSaturday, at Sunday's trvouts in
Wilbur Dining Hall. The judges of
fered encouragement and construc
tive criticism to participants, who
auditioned a cappella.
According to Selena Simmons-
Duffin '08, a contestant in Satur
day's auditions who also tried out in
2005, the judges took their jobs very
seriously.
Contestant Chris Kucharcyzk
'11 agreed.
"They gave a very honest, criti
cal review," he said.
Participants expressed various

reasons for choosing to audition in
this year's program, including peer
pressure.
"My friends made me do it,"
Kucharcyzk said, while his friend
Julian Kusnadi' 11 described a simi
lar situation.
"1 decided to try out because
Didi was trying out." he said, point
ing to friend Ladidi Garba '11.
Freshman Aaron Grayson '11
auditioned on a whim.
"I thought I'd just try out." he
said. "Since joining gospel choir,
I've got a new-found love for
singing. It gave me a chance to im
prove my vocalizations."
Despite the small-scale nature
of "Stanford Idol." Garba said she
felt "surprisingly nervous" before
her audition: Kusnadi said he felt
anxious after reading the partici

pant contract sheet in which partic
ipants agreed to have their audi
tions broadcast on SCBN and on
line.
"Idol" veteran Simmons-Duffin
also said she felt slightly apprehen
sive for her tryout.
"I was more nervous than I ex
pected," she said. "I'm always sur
prised by the kind of criticism that
comes up."
"Freshman year 1 was criticized
for what I was wearing," Simmons-
Duffin added, referring to the
sweatpants she sported in 2005.
This year, she wore a dress.
The judges said they had a diffi
cult time analyzing this year's con
testants.
"There are lots of people in the
mid-range this year," Grossman
said. "It's hard to weed them out."

Despite last year's low turnout,
organizers decided to give "Stan
ford Idol" another chance in 2008.
"We think it's a fun thing for stu
dents to do," Avula said. "We want
students to have an opportunity to
showcase human talent as individu
als."
"Now with the CoHo closed,
there are fewer venues for musical
talent," Grossman added.
This year's "Stanford Idol" looks
to be gaining in popularity, particu
larly now that there are rumors of
celebrity judges.
"The Lopez twins might judge,"
said event organizer Dean Young
' 11, an ASSU executive aide. "They
seemed pretty excited."
