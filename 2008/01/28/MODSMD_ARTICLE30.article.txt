WHAT IS SEXUAL HEALTH?
Good sexual health is the state in which people are able to
enjoy fully consensual, responsible, satisfying and safe sex lives.
The term also infers that students have the freedom to decide if,
when and how often to have sex and/or remain abstinent.
Implicit in this is the right of sexually active men and women to
be informed of and to have access to safe and effective meth
ods of reproductive control as well as methods to protect
against disease. Our services are designed to meet these needs.
All services listed below are completely confidential and, usually,
come at no cost.
