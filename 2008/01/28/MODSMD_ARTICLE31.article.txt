WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?
Mental health is a spectrum of psychological and emotion
al functioning.
Good mental health is the state of psychological and emo
tional wellbeing that enables an individual to work, love, study,
form healthy relationships and resolve conflicts. It is the ability to
enjoy life, bounce back from adversity and balance your life
between time spent alone and with others, work and play, sleep
and wakefulness, rest and exercise and other fundamental
states.
When we feel mentally healthy, we experience a range of

emotions and can appropriately
express our feelings. We recog
nize our talents and make choic
es that support our potential hap
piness.
The typical ups and downs

of life may interfere with our wellbeing and temporarily lead to
anxiety, depression, insecurity and loss of self-esteem. Reaching
out to a trusted friend, a staff member or trained peer coun
selors can help alleviate the distress and help you thrive again.
Sometimes, circumstances warrant professional counseling,
something that can be a great asset.
Finally, behavioral or psychological conditions may cause
significant distress, disturbed functioning or increase the risk of
harm to self or others. In these circumstances, professional
counseling is strongly advised.
A WORD ABOUT CAMPUS RESOURCES
Campus is where we live, study, work and play. The
resources listed below are partners in responding to each stu

help students to thrive, be happy and fulfill personal and acade
mic goals.
Particularly when students are feeling very distressed or in
crisis, it may difficult for them to know which resource is best.
Our common goal is to offer students a place where trusted
staff will listen, be supportive and, if helpful, refer them to other
appropriate resources.
