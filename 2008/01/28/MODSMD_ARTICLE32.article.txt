OFFICE OF RELIGIOUS LIFE:
• Website: http://religiouslife.stanford.edu
The Office for Religious Life has several ongoing offerings
that contribute to student wellbeing. The Deans for Religious Life
provide confidential pastoral care and non-judgmental counsel
ing for a wide range of issues including relationships, career
and vocational choices, academics and ethics as well as navi
gating Stanford. Reflection and ritual can be found at Sunday
morning's University Public Worship, a Sunday evening
Compline service and Friday's Labyrinth, all held in the quietude
of Memorial Church. An additional and beautiful space in
which to meditate, pray, rest and renew one's spirit is the new
interfaith sanctuary in the Center for Inter-Religious Community,
Learning and Experiences (3rd floor, Old Union). Programs such
as What Matter to Me and Why assist students with questions of
meaning and identity. At times of significant national or commu
nal importance, the Deans for Religious Life create rituals to
enable the community to come together to celebrate as well as
to mourn.
GRADUATE UFE OFFICE:
• Website: http://glo.stanford.edu
The Graduate Life Office (GLO) is part of the continuum of
mental health services available to graduate students.
GLO is a central source for information and advise to stu
dents, and consultation to faculty and staff regarding all aspects
of life outside the classroom. It administers the residence pro
gram in on-campus graduate residences with the mission of
building community and support among students through
neighborhood events. GLO also collaborates with the Graduate
Student Programming Board and the GSC to plan campus
wide events to promote socialization, connection and wellness
outside of the classroom.
Most importantly, GLO helps students who experience diffi
culties including roommate conflicts, relationship problems,
health and mental health concerns and academic challenges.
We offer support, problem-solving and referrals to on-campus
resources. We respond to student emergencies through our
24/7 pager which can be accessed by calling 723-8222,
entering pager ID 25085, and then the call-back number.

RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION
• Website: http://resed.stanford.edu
All of the Residential Education staff work collaboratively
with the resources on campus to respond to any situations that
comes to our attention. We emphasize to all staff to be proac
tive and take action rather than waiting for a situation to esca
late, though that action can range from consulting another staff
member to calling 911. Residential Education works both to
educate students in an effort to prevent serious situations from
occurring and to respond quickly to any situations when they
happen.
We are trying to provide a better understanding to students
of the ways in which campus resources overlap, and yet also the
ways in which resources specialize. Therefore, any comparison
and contrast between the resources above (RA, RD, RF) for stu
dents, not just in their definitions but perhaps effectiveness and
appropriateness in responding to different situations, would be
most helpful.
RAs are undergraduate student residence staff who have
received basic training on a variety of issues ranging from eat
ing disorders to mental health. Because RAs are peers, they
often gain their residents' trust, making them a more appealing
option than professional staff. They are often the first point of
contact and the first response for students encountering prob
lems. However, because their training is limited, most situations
need to be referred on to professional staff. Due to privacy laws,
RAs often cannot be informed about how a student's situation is
progressing once it has been referred on.
RFs are Stanford faculty or senior staff who live in campus
residences. RFs provide an adult presence in the house, set the
intellectual tone for the house, and supervise the student resi
dence staff. RFs do receive some training on the issues that
come up every year. In cases where an RA is unavailable, lacks
life experience, may be too closely tied to an issue, or is other
wise not able to serve as an advisor, the RF is a terrific first
response resource. They, too, will refer most issues to the
Residence Dean and the same privacy laws are in effect.
Residence Deans are Residential Education professional
staff who have training in responding to all types of situations
and crisis management. RDs work very closely with CAPS,
YWCA, Deans for Religious Life, Undergraduate Advising,
Housing Assignments, the Freshman Dean's Office, the
Community Centers, Office of Student Activities, Health
Promotion Services and others within the University to best
respond to situations. There are six undergraduate Residence
Deans and each one is assigned an area of students including
off-campus students. While students can go directly to their
Residence Dean, it is often better for them to start working with
their residence staff who will then refer cases to the RD.
FRESHMAN DEAN'S OFFICE
The Freshman Dean's Office (FDO) works with freshmen
and transfer students to address academic and personal transi
tion issues such as fit and belonging, academic adjustment, and
behavioral matters. The FDO also provides programming
designed to address student transition issues and highlight cam
pus resources including New Student Orientation, Mid-Year
Convocation, and an upcoming series of Freshman Workshops.
For more information about these workshops, additional pro
grams, or to make an appointment to speak with someone, call
72-FROSH or email frosh@stanford.edu.
UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING AND RESEARCH
• Website: http://ual.stanford.edu
The freshman and sophomore advisor, a member of the
Stanford faculty or academic staff, helps students navigate, from
their first days on campus, the full array of intellectual opportuni
ties available to them at Stanford.


When you declare a major, you will switch to a faculty advi
sor in your major department or program. You will need to
check with your department or program to know its particular
procedures for finding a faculty advisor. In addition, the Student
Services Officer in each department or program can provide
essential degree progress and major requirement information.
Advisors in the office of Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) work directly with students in one-on-one inter
actions to help you define your scholarly interests, overcome
obstacles to your academic success, engage with faculty, take
advantage of academic opportunities and resources outside
your major department, and, for some students, to prepare for
post-baccalaureate study (medicine, law, etc.).
UAR Academic Directors (ADs) are located in three fresh
man residence halls, Florence Moore (Christina Mesa), Stem
(Renee Courey), and Wilbur (Glenn Brody Magid). There are
two ADs for sophomores and upperclassmen: one for Toyon
(Beth Fox) and one for the South Row (Susan Zare). ADs answer
questions about the curriculum and academic rules and regula
tions, with an appreciation for the vanety of ways in which you
can negotiate your undergraduate life at Stanford.
The Academic Director (Duane Voigt) and Assistant AD
(Keiko Price) for student-athletes serve a central role in the advis
ing of undergraduate varsity athletes from all four classes, in an
office on site in the Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation.
The Head Peer Academic Coordinator (HPAC) and Peer
Mentor (PM) work with students in the nuts and bolts of course
registration, University policies and procedures, and academic
and extracurricular resources. They help you communicate
effectively with your advisor, and serve as a link to many univer
sity offices and resources.
For more information or to schedule an appointment with
an advisor, call 723-2426 or email vpue
advising@stanford.edu.

ways in which resources specialize. Therefore, any comparison
and contrast between the resources above (RA, RD, RF) for stu
dents, not just in their definitions but perhaps effectiveness and
appropriateness in responding to different situations, would be
most helpful.
RAs are undergraduate student residence staff who have
received basic training on a variety of issues ranging from eat
ing disorders to mental health. Because RAs are peers, they
often gain their residents' trust, making them a more appealing
option than professional staff. They are often the first point of
contact and the first response for students encountering prob
lems. However, because their training is limited, most situations
need to be referred on to professional staff. Due to privacy laws,
RAs often cannot be informed about how a student's situation is
progressing once it has been referred on.
RFs are Stanford faculty or senior staff who live in campus
residences. RFs provide an adult presence in the house, set the
intellectual tone for the house, and supervise the student resi
dence staff. RFs do receive some training on the issues that
come up every year. In cases where an RA is unavailable, lacks
life experience, may be too closely tied to an issue, or is other
wise not able to serve as an advisor, the RF is a terrific first
response resource. They, too, will refer most issues to the
Residence Dean and the same privacy laws are in effect.
Residence Deans are Residential Education professional
staff who have training in responding to all types of situations
and crisis management. RDs work very closely with CAPS,
YWCA, Deans for Religious Life, Undergraduate Advising,
Housing Assignments, the Freshman Dean's Office, the
Community Centers, Office of Student Activities, Health
Promotion Services and others within the University to best
respond to situations. There are six undergraduate Residence
Deans and each one is assigned an area of students including
off-campus students. While students can go directly to their
Residence Dean, it is often better for them to start working with
their residence staff who will then refer cases to the RD.
FRESHMAN DEAN'S OFFICE
The Freshman Dean's Office (FDO) works with freshmen
and transfer students to address academic and personal transi
tion issues such as fit and belonging, academic adjustment, and
behavioral matters. The FDO also provides programming
designed to address student transition issues and highlight cam
pus resources including New Student Orientation, Mid-Year
Convocation, and an upcoming series of Freshman Workshops.
For more information about these workshops, additional pro
grams, or to make an appointment to speak with someone, call
72-FROSH or email frosh@stanford.edu.
UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING AND RESEARCH
• Website: http://ual.stanford.edu
The freshman and sophomore advisor, a member of the
Stanford faculty or academic staff, helps students navigate, from
their first days on campus, the full array of intellectual opportuni
ties available to them at Stanford.


When you declare a major, you will switch to a faculty advi
sor in your major department or program. You will need to
check with your department or program to know its particular
procedures for finding a faculty advisor. In addition, the Student
Services Officer in each department or program can provide
essential degree progress and major requirement information.
Advisors in the office of Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) work directly with students in one-on-one inter
actions to help you define your scholarly interests, overcome
obstacles to your academic success, engage with faculty, take
advantage of academic opportunities and resources outside
your major department, and, for some students, to prepare for
post-baccalaureate study (medicine, law, etc.).
UAR Academic Directors (ADs) are located in three fresh
man residence halls, Florence Moore (Christina Mesa), Stem
(Renee Courey), and Wilbur (Glenn Brody Magid). There are
two ADs for sophomores and upperclassmen: one for Toyon
(Beth Fox) and one for the South Row (Susan Zare). ADs answer
questions about the curriculum and academic rules and regula
tions, with an appreciation for the vanety of ways in which you
can negotiate your undergraduate life at Stanford.
The Academic Director (Duane Voigt) and Assistant AD
(Keiko Price) for student-athletes serve a central role in the advis
ing of undergraduate varsity athletes from all four classes, in an
office on site in the Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation.
The Head Peer Academic Coordinator (HPAC) and Peer
Mentor (PM) work with students in the nuts and bolts of course
registration, University policies and procedures, and academic
and extracurricular resources. They help you communicate
effectively with your advisor, and serve as a link to many univer
sity offices and resources.
For more information or to schedule an appointment with
an advisor, call 723-2426 or email vpue
advising@stanford.edu.

OFFICE OF RELIGIOUS LIFE:
• Website: http://religiouslife.stanford.edu
The Office for Religious Life has several ongoing offerings
that contribute to student wellbeing. The Deans for Religious Life
provide confidential pastoral care and non-judgmental counsel
ing for a wide range of issues including relationships, career
and vocational choices, academics and ethics as well as navi
gating Stanford. Reflection and ritual can be found at Sunday
morning's University Public Worship, a Sunday evening
Compline service and Friday's Labyrinth, all held in the quietude
of Memorial Church. An additional and beautiful space in
which to meditate, pray, rest and renew one's spirit is the new
interfaith sanctuary in the Center for Inter-Religious Community,
Learning and Experiences (3rd floor, Old Union). Programs such
as What Matter to Me and Why assist students with questions of
meaning and identity. At times of significant national or commu
nal importance, the Deans for Religious Life create rituals to
enable the community to come together to celebrate as well as

GRADUATE UFE OFFICE:
• Website: http://glo.stanford.edu
The Graduate Life Office (GLO) is part of the continuum of
mental health services available to graduate students.
GLO is a central source for information and advise to stu
dents, and consultation to faculty and staff regarding all aspects
of life outside the classroom. It administers the residence pro
gram in on-campus graduate residences with the mission of
building community and support among students through
neighborhood events. GLO also collaborates with the Graduate
Student Programming Board and the GSC to plan campus
wide events to promote socialization, connection and wellness
outside of the classroom.
Most importantly, GLO helps students who experience diffi
culties including roommate conflicts, relationship problems,
health and mental health concerns and academic challenges.
We offer support, problem-solving and referrals to on-campus
resources. We respond to student emergencies through our
24/7 pager which can be accessed by calling 723-8222,
entering pager ID 25085, and then the call-back number.

RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION
• Website: http://resed.stanford.edu
All of the Residential Education staff work collaboratively
with the resources on campus to respond to any situations that
comes to our attention. We emphasize to all staff to be proac
tive and take action rather than waiting for a situation to esca
late, though that action can range from consulting another staff
member to calling 911. Residential Education works both to
educate students in an effort to prevent serious situations from
occurring and to respond quickly to any situations when they
happen.
We are trying to provide a better understanding to students
of the ways in which campus resources overlap, and yet also the
ways in which resources specialize. Therefore, any comparison
and contrast between the resources above (RA, RD, RF) for stu
dents, not just in their definitions but perhaps effectiveness and
