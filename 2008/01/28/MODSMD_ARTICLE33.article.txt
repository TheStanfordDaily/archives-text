# Peer Mental Health Services
## 
### 
Peer Health Educators are trained and supervised under
graduate student residence staff. They are educated to offer
students coaching and mental health advising on a one-on
one basis. PHEs also help students broaden their perspectives
about an issue, consider options, and help create action
plans for positive and productive change. They are also trust
ed resource referrals, whether residents are interested in per
sonal growth, or feel distressed. PHEs receive intensive train
ing in addressing relationships, self-esteem issues, and find
ing fulfillment at Stanford. PHEs are also there to help with
issues such as eating disorders, alcohol problems, and men
tal health concerns.
PHEs can also bring a wide variety of emotional health
programs into the dorms. Massage workshops are a favorite.
Professional presenters work with PHEs to offer interesting
programs (see Wellness) such as The Science and Pursuit of
Happiness," "Why I Love People Who Are Bad for Me," "Tea
with PHE," and a host of other cool topics.
