SAFE & OPEN SPACES AT STANFORD (SOSAS)
Safe and Open Spaces at Stanford (SOSAS) is a group
of panelists organized by the LGBT-CRC. We are an out
reach program designed to inform the Stanford community
about queer issues. We share our personal stories and help
facilitate discussions about such issues as gender, how to be
a good ally, transgender, and homophobia, among many
other topics. SOSAS hopes to make the Stanford community

- including dorms, health centers, and community centers -
more accepting and empathetic to LGBT issues. To join
SOSAS (there is a brief training) or to host a SOSAS panel,
please email lgbtsosas@stanford.edu.
kNOw MORE
kNOw MORE helps prevent teen relationship abuse by
giving dynamic presentations at local high schools. Our inter
active teaching style encourages open discussion about an
issue that affects 1 in 4 teen girls, while also giving practical
advice on topics like "How to Help a Friend". We encourage
both men and women to get involved, since it is crucial to
have an even gender balance when presenting this sensitive
issue. No acting experience or knowledge about the issue is
necessary to perform with this fun and fulfilling service group!
The time commitment is a one-hour meeting every two
weeks, participation in one or two presentations each quarter,
and a few hours of rehearsal for each presentation. Want to

MEN AGAINST VIOLENCE (MAV)
Men Against Violence (MAV) aims to help Stanford men
become leaders in men's health and help bring about the
elimination of violence against women on campus. MAV
meets once a week every Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Vaden
(Group Room South, 2nd floor) and participates in numerous
campus outreach activities including movie nights, awareness
drives, and speaker presentations. Why should you join
MAV? In part, because while we may not know it, all of us
men have mothers, sisters, partners, and friends who have
been or may be affected by violence and it doesn't have to
be that way. MAV is here to help change that status quo.
Contact Jesse Wallin, MAV President at
jesswall@stanford.edu for more information.
