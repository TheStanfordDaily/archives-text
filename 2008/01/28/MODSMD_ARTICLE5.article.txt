## Freshman class expansion task force to meet 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Today marks the first meeting of the task
force organized by President John Hennessy
to analyze the potential benefits and conse
quences of increasing the number of under
graduate students admitted each year.
Increasing the size of the freshman class
would bolster diversity and enrich Stanford's

culture by allowing more high school seniors
the opportunity to attend, according to Hen
nessy''s column in the September 2007 issue of
the Stanford Magazine.
"It is my belief that many administrators,
including President Hennessy, believe that
each and every year there are many extreme
ly qualified students that Stanford is forced to
turn away during the admissions process be
cause of the small number of students we are

committed to accepting," ASSU President
I lershey Avula "08. the only student member
of the task force, wrote in an email to The
Daily.
" Iliey see an expansion of the freshman
class as an opportunity to increase the number
of amazing students at our University, as well
as an opportunity to extend the privilege of a
Stanford education to more students
[throughout) the nation and world."
The task force will examine each
of the necessary requirements for
expanding the size of the incoming
class with an eye for the plan's feasi

bility.The members will examine fac
tors such as limited financial aid and
campus housing resources.
According to Avula, the group
will also work with departments
across campus to discuss potential
drawbacks of expanding the fresh
man class. Analysis will provide in
sight into whether or not "an ex
pansion of the freshman class
would in any way adversely affect
residential education or students'

academic experiences at Stanford.''
Avula said.
Throughout the year, the task
force will continue to discuss class
expansion with various members of
the Stanford community. Avula said
he has started to seek input from stu
dents across campus, but he is still
looking to hear more opinions.
