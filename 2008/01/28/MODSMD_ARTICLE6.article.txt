# Stanford 82, California 77
## Card escapes Cal with win No. 20 Stanford improves to 16-3 on the season 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford took the floor
for halftime warm-ups, it was
Brook Lopez who came out of the
tunnel first. It seemed appropriate
that the sophomore big man, who
played only five minutes in the first
half after picking up his second
foul, would want a head start to get
warm.
He got a little more than just
warm.
Lopez scored all of his game
high 23 points in the second half as
the Stanford Cardinal held off a
feisty California team for a big 82-
77 win at Haas Pavilion Saturday
evening.
For No. 20 Stanford (16-3, 5-2

Junior point guard Mitch Johnson was crucial in Stanford's 82-77 victory over
the Golden Bears on Saturday, scoring 16 points to go along with seven assists.
. They're [the Lopez twins| both really skilled
big guys, and it's tough getting shots up over
them," said California big man DeVon Hardin,
who led the Bears with 17 points. "They're shot
blockers, and it brought a challenge down in the
paint."
He's such a big body." Hardin added about
Brook Lopez. "He's going to finish if he gets any
where near the rim."'
Lopez did that early and often in the second
half, scoring nine of Stanford's first 11 points after
the break. He finished with 7-for-9 shooting from
the field, while his brother Robin chipped in with
10 points, four blocks and a season-high 14 re
bounds— including 10 offensive boards.
There's no secret to what we're doing." Stan
ford coach Trent Johnson said. "We're inside-out
oriented; get the ball on the block, and we'll have
opportunities to make plays."
Powered in large part by Robin Lopez's 10 of
fensive rebounds, the team as a whole netted 21
boards on the offensive glass. The Cardinal domi
nated the boards throughout (42-35) and deflated
Cal by scoring on second and third chance oppor
tunities and getting to the line for 38 free throw at
tempts. making 24.
"A lot of those free throws were off offensive
rebounds," said Cal guard Patrick Christopher,
who added 16 points and four assists. "They got
those second chance points — that killed us."
Stanford also excelled on defense. Cal forward
Ryan Anderson, entering the game as the Pac-10's
leading scorer (21.9 points per game) managed to
score just 11 against the Cardinal's twin towers.
Neither team started particularly well, and the
game was marred by myriad turnovers and fouls in

the opening minutes. Stanford experimented with
a zone defense with both Lopez twins on the
bench, mounting a 11-0 run midway through the
first half by forcing turnovers and pushing the ball
in transition. But the shots began falling for the
Bears, who responded with a 9-0 run of their own
to get within one. 24-23. with 4:2b remaining in the

After Lopez's run to start the second half.
Christopher caught fire for Cal and the Bears took
a 45-44 lead at the 13-minute mark.
The ensuing possession defined the game in
many respects: Robin Lopez, fouled on a put-back

attempt, missed both free throws, but junior
Lawrence Hill snagged the offensive board and
found guard Drew Shiller for a three-pointer to
put momentum back in the Cardinal's corner.
"A couple times they got a couple lobs, a couple
threes, a couple big plays like that and I thought
we did a good job of countering their runs and tak
ing some big blows." said junior guard Mitch John
son (lf> points, seven assists), "(we were) staying
consistent in what we were doing, getting the ball
down to Brook and not getting away from our
game plan."
Stanford was boosted by strong play off the
bench, especially by forward Taj Finger (six points,
six rebounds) and Schiller, who had not seen much
playing time lately but hit two timely three-point
ers. Trent Johnson said his team's bench play was
"refreshing."
"For the most part I thought we got some major
contributions from guys coming off the bench." he
said. "And this is a team, as I've said all year long,
we're only as strong as our weakest link."
The Cardinal took the lead for good with 9:30
left when the Lopez twins mounted a 7-0 run on
their own. The Bears got within two with 2:48 re
maining after a Hardin dunk and layup over
Brook Lopez. But the bruising big man fouled out
on the next possession, and despite his efforts to
rally the crowd as he headed to the bench. Stan
ford had again withstood Cal's run.
"The thing I like about our group is that we're
playing through the peaks and valleys." Trent
Johnson said. "And we're getting to where we need
to be. and that's staying within striking distance."

JOHN LAXSON/The Stanford Daily
Junior point guard Mitch Johnson was crucial in Stanford's 82-77 victory over
the Golden Bears on Saturday, scoring 16 points to go along with seven assists.
. They're [the Lopez twins| both really skilled
big guys, and it's tough getting shots up over
them," said California big man DeVon Hardin,
who led the Bears with 17 points. "They're shot
blockers, and it brought a challenge down in the
paint."
He's such a big body." Hardin added about
Brook Lopez. "He's going to finish if he gets any
where near the rim."'
Lopez did that early and often in the second
half, scoring nine of Stanford's first 11 points after
the break. He finished with 7-for-9 shooting from
the field, while his brother Robin chipped in with
10 points, four blocks and a season-high 14 re
bounds— including 10 offensive boards.
There's no secret to what we're doing." Stan
ford coach Trent Johnson said. "We're inside-out
oriented; get the ball on the block, and we'll have
opportunities to make plays."
Powered in large part by Robin Lopez's 10 of
fensive rebounds, the team as a whole netted 21
boards on the offensive glass. The Cardinal domi
nated the boards throughout (42-35) and deflated
Cal by scoring on second and third chance oppor
tunities and getting to the line for 38 free throw at
tempts. making 24.
"A lot of those free throws were off offensive
rebounds," said Cal guard Patrick Christopher,
who added 16 points and four assists. "They got
those second chance points — that killed us."
Stanford also excelled on defense. Cal forward
Ryan Anderson, entering the game as the Pac-10's
leading scorer (21.9 points per game) managed to
score just 11 against the Cardinal's twin towers.
Neither team started particularly well, and the
game was marred by myriad turnovers and fouls in

a zone defense with both Lopez twins on the
bench, mounting a 11-0 run midway through the
first half by forcing turnovers and pushing the ball

Christopher caught fire for Cal and the Bears took
a 45-44 lead at the 13-minute mark.
The ensuing possession defined the game in
many respects: Robin Lopez, fouled on a put-back

attempt, missed both free throws, but junior
Lawrence Hill snagged the offensive board and
found guard Drew Shiller for a three-pointer to
put momentum back in the Cardinal's corner.
"A couple times they got a couple lobs, a couple
threes, a couple big plays like that and I thought
we did a good job of countering their runs and tak
ing some big blows." said junior guard Mitch John
son (lf> points, seven assists), "(we were) staying
consistent in what we were doing, getting the ball
down to Brook and not getting away from our
game plan."
Stanford was boosted by strong play off the
bench, especially by forward Taj Finger (six points,
six rebounds) and Schiller, who had not seen much
playing time lately but hit two timely three-point
ers. Trent Johnson said his team's bench play was
"refreshing."
"For the most part I thought we got some major
contributions from guys coming off the bench." he
said. "And this is a team, as I've said all year long,
we're only as strong as our weakest link."
The Cardinal took the lead for good with 9:30
left when the Lopez twins mounted a 7-0 run on
their own. The Bears got within two with 2:48 re
maining after a Hardin dunk and layup over
Brook Lopez. But the bruising big man fouled out
on the next possession, and despite his efforts to
rally the crowd as he headed to the bench. Stan
ford had again withstood Cal's run.
"The thing I like about our group is that we're
playing through the peaks and valleys." Trent
Johnson said. "And we're getting to where we need
to be. and that's staying within striking distance."
