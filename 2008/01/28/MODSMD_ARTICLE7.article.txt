man forward Kayla Pederson also
scored in double figures, chipping in 11
points, while sophomore center Jayne
Appel added nine points and grabbed a
game-high 15 rebounds.

from both teams. Stanford never relin
quished the lead after the initial two
minutes.

grown to 16, and Stanford's success was
bolstered by a 23-14 rebounding advan
tage. Coach Tara VanDerveer applauded
the effort of her posts in silencing Cal
forwards Devanei Hampton and Ashley
