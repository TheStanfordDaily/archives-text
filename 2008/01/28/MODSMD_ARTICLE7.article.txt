# Stanford 72. California 52
## Stanford mauls the No. 8 Golden Bears 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Last year, the Cal women came to
Maples and snapped Stanford's 17-game
winning streak with a 72-57 upset. This
time around,the No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team returned the favor. TTie
No. 8 Bears (17-3.8-1 Pac-10) were sent
home with a blemish on their previously
pristine conference record, as the Cardi
nal (17-3. 7-2 Pac-10) scored a big 72-52
victory Saturday afternoon.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins led
Stanford with a game-high 28 points
(including 14-for-14 from the free
thrown line), while sophomore guard
J.J. Hones added 12 points on 4-for-6
shooting from three point range. Fresh
man forward Kayla Pederson also
scored in double figures, chipping in 11
points, while sophomore center Jayne
Appel added nine points and grabbed a
game-high 15 rebounds.
The much-hyped "Battle of the Bay"
was hardly even a battle, as Cal never
came within seven points in the second
half. Despite a sluggish offensive start
from both teams. Stanford never relin
quished the lead after the initial two
minutes.
By halftime. the Cardinal lead had
grown to 16, and Stanford's success was
bolstered by a 23-14 rebounding advan
tage. Coach Tara VanDerveer applauded
the effort of her posts in silencing Cal
forwards Devanei Hampton and Ashley

GAME NOTES: After beating Cal - who was previ
ously undefeated in the Rac-10 - Stanford
moved to one game behind the Bears in the
Pac-10 Standings. The Cardinal was led by sen
ior guard Candice Wiggins who had 28 points;
she went an astounding 14-for-14 from the

"I'm really proud of how Kayla,
Jayne. and Morgan [Clyburn] just bat
tled in there," VanDerveer said. "Basi
cally [they said.) 'We're not backing
down from you. We're here, we're going
to play hard, we're going to help (in
side). but we're going to make you find
the open player and make that player
make the shot.'"
Appel added that the team was
well-prepared after the week of prac
tice.
"All week we knew the double
[team] was coming [in the post)," she
said. "We practiced a lot passing out
and being aware of where their de
fense was. We also worked on dou
bling their posts. So.it wasjust the bat
tle of the bigs between us and them."
Practice made perfect, as Appel
complemented her scoring and re
bounding output with a game-high
seven assists.

VanDerveer said Appel's gaudy
stats were a result of her ongoing de
velopment, which is coming to
fruition.
"Jayne has great vision and a great
sense of the game," VanDerveer said.
"Since the L.A. trips,she really under
stands where to be on the floor and
what kind of things to do. She's a very
intelligent player, she made great de
cisions, she can pass and she's very un
selfish."
With her 28 points, Wiggins is now
just 11 points shy of tying Stanford's
career scoring record of 2,215 points.

The senior guard was not alone in
the backcourt, however, as Hones cel
ebrated the one year anniversary of
her torn ACL against Cal with a stel
lar performance on both ends of the
floor.
"Obviously, to me this was a really
big game for J.J., [and| I think this has
come full circle," VanDerveer said.
"It's her time to be out there. She has
been playing very, very well off the
bench for us, and she takes care of the
ball [...] 1 think her contributions were
huge, and I'm really glad they came in
this game."
One of Hones' four threes came
early in the second half and sparked a
10-4 Cardinal run that put the game
out of reach. More important than
any individual's scoring, though, was
Stanford's tough defense. While Cal
forwards Ashley Walker and Rama
N'diaye snuck into double digits, as
did guard Alexis Gray-Lawson, the
team shot only 30.8 percent from the
field and found no way around Stan
ford's staunch defense inside.
The combination of shared scor
ing, consistent defense and sheer en
thusiasm led VanDerveer to call this
her team's "most complete" game
thus far.
"I think we can take great things
from this game," she said. "We
learned that our team is pretty battle
tested and excited about playing. We
played very hard and showed really
good poise. Cal has an excellent team,
and we're proud of beating them
today."

VanDerveer said Appel's gaudy
stats were a result of her ongoing de
velopment, which is coming to
fruition.
"Jayne has great vision and a great
sense of the game," VanDerveer said.
"Since the L.A. trips,she really under
stands where to be on the floor and
what kind of things to do. She's a very
intelligent player, she made great de
cisions, she can pass and she's very un
selfish."
With her 28 points, Wiggins is now
just 11 points shy of tying Stanford's
career scoring record of 2,215 points.

The senior guard was not alone in
the backcourt, however, as Hones cel
ebrated the one year anniversary of
her torn ACL against Cal with a stel
lar performance on both ends of the
floor.
"Obviously, to me this was a really
big game for J.J., [and| I think this has
come full circle," VanDerveer said.
"It's her time to be out there. She has
been playing very, very well off the
bench for us, and she takes care of the
ball [...] 1 think her contributions were
huge, and I'm really glad they came in
this game."
One of Hones' four threes came
early in the second half and sparked a
10-4 Cardinal run that put the game
out of reach. More important than
any individual's scoring, though, was
Stanford's tough defense. While Cal
forwards Ashley Walker and Rama
N'diaye snuck into double digits, as
did guard Alexis Gray-Lawson, the
team shot only 30.8 percent from the
field and found no way around Stan
ford's staunch defense inside.
The combination of shared scor
ing, consistent defense and sheer en
thusiasm led VanDerveer to call this
her team's "most complete" game
thus far.
"I think we can take great things
from this game," she said. "We
learned that our team is pretty battle
tested and excited about playing. We
played very hard and showed really
good poise. Cal has an excellent team,
and we're proud of beating them
today."

Last year, the Cal women came to
Maples and snapped Stanford's 17-game
winning streak with a 72-57 upset. This
time around,the No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team returned the favor. TTie
No. 8 Bears (17-3.8-1 Pac-10) were sent
home with a blemish on their previously
pristine conference record, as the Cardi
nal (17-3. 7-2 Pac-10) scored a big 72-52
victory Saturday afternoon.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins led
Stanford with a game-high 28 points
(including 14-for-14 from the free
thrown line), while sophomore guard
J.J. Hones added 12 points on 4-for-6
shooting from three point range. Fresh
man forward Kayla Pederson also
scored in double figures, chipping in 11
points, while sophomore center Jayne
Appel added nine points and grabbed a
game-high 15 rebounds.
The much-hyped "Battle of the Bay"
was hardly even a battle, as Cal never
came within seven points in the second
half. Despite a sluggish offensive start
from both teams. Stanford never relin
quished the lead after the initial two
minutes.
By halftime. the Cardinal lead had
grown to 16, and Stanford's success was
bolstered by a 23-14 rebounding advan
tage. Coach Tara VanDerveer applauded
the effort of her posts in silencing Cal
forwards Devanei Hampton and Ashley

down from you. We're here, we're going
to play hard, we're going to help (in

the open player and make that player
make the shot.'"
Appel added that the team was
well-prepared after the week of prac

"All week we knew the double
[team] was coming [in the post)," she
said. "We practiced a lot passing out
and being aware of where their de
fense was. We also worked on dou

Practice made perfect, as Appel
complemented her scoring and re
bounding output with a game-high
seven assists.
