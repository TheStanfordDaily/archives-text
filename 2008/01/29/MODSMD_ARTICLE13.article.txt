### SHELLEY GAO 
Along with Laurel Gabler '06 and Aaron Pol
hamus "08, Scott Thompson 'Oh will be heading
to Oxford University this fall with the 29 other
Americans who were awarded 2008 Rhodes
Scholarships in November 2007.
Thompson, who earned bachelor's degrees
in Psychology — with honors — and Political
Science while at Stanford, intends to pursue a
master's degree in social work and social policy
while at Oxford. He is currently working for
Teach for America, teaching high school stu
dents in New York City.
The Daily spoke with Thompson about the
Rhodes application process, his favorite thing
about Stanford and his addiction to jelly beans.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How does it feel to
be a Rhodes Scholar?
Scott Thompson (ST): Sounds as though 1 just
won the Super Bowl or something. 1 was very
surprised when they read the names off. 1 am
very excited [and] looking ahead to two years
at Oxford. Everything 1 have heard about Ox
ford [describes] this incredible intellectual
community.
TSD: What was the application process like?
ST: It was somewhat stressful. You have to in
vest a lot of yourself in it if you are going to be
able to put [in] enough effort to really have a
chance of success. But that also sets you up for
a lot of disappointments if it doesn't work out.
I was very fortunate that things worked out as
they did.
TSD: What influenced you to apply?
ST: To be honest, it wouldn't have occurred to
me if Teach for America hadn 't approached me
about it. 1 was interested in [applying] for grad
uate school. [Applying to he a Rhodes Scholar]
wasn't ... really on my radar until Teach for
America came up with the idea.
TSD: What is the best thing about Stanford?
ST:That's an impossible question! 1 have got to
go with the people. The campus is beautiful of
course, but 1 think the people are the most re
markable thing about my Stanford experience,
both the professors and the students. 1 had a
chance to meet and build relationship with a lot
amazing professors. My Psychology adviser

Hazel Markus |and] my Political Science Pro
fessor Gerhard Casper ... are just [a] few of the
people that I got to know well.
TSI): What was your favorite class?
ST:That's another impossible question! 1 don't
know that I can identify a favorite class. One
class that got me started down the path that
that 1 have pursued was IHUM Class-C'itizen
ship. taught by Professor Casper. My Sopho
more College program in Constitutionalism,
which he also taught, was remarkable and guid-

"The people are
the most
remarkable thing
about my
Stanford experience."
SCOTT THOMPSON '06,
2008 Rhodes Scholar

Ed me towards law school, which 1 think I will
eventually.pursue. I had a lot of chances to take
a lot of classes outside my majors and the free
dom to do that. 1 took an amazing class on
Greek history, a class on studies in Christianity
in late antiquity, a class on the Book of Genesis
[and] a class on Shakespeare.
TSD: What is working for Teach for America
like'.'
ST: It is important to know that 1 teach in New
York public schools. Teaching in |New York
City is| quite an experience. And by far the
most challenging [thing] that 1 have ever done.
It is also wonderful to be doing something that
1 know has a positive effect ... on one of the
most serious issues facing our country today:
the achievement gap between disadvantaged
students and their more advantaged peers. And

it's just a lot of fun.
TS1): What do you think about the choice fac
ing graduating seniors between going into pub
lic service or the private sector?
ST: I think people need to find something that is
fulfilling for them. And people are fulfilled by a
variety of things. 1 was concerned that Teach for
America would not perhaps provide me with a
very clear sense of what 1 want to do afterwards.
Hut I really found it has very much given me a
better sense of what 1 care about, what I am in
terested in and what 1 am passionate about. I
don't think something like Teach for America is
for everybody. You need to be doing it because
you are sincerely interested and care about
these issues and 1 think there are variety of ways
you can apply the skills that will help you to be
successful down the road.
TSI): Any advice you would give to Stanford
students now that you have graduated?
ST: Certainly [take] advantage of all the oppor
tunities at your disposal. Explore as many
things as possible — and that takes the form of
taking classes in other departments that you
might not be majoring in. [Get] involved in as
many internships and extra-curricular activi
ties as you can. [Mv] biggest regret from my un
dergraduate career was not going abroad. 1
spent a semester in Washington, which was
great. But 1 wished 1 had gone ahead and gone
abroad.
TSI): Any advice you would give to Stanford
students applying to international fellowships?
ST: This is advice that 1 read and heard many
times: [start] working on it early and get advice
and feedback from as many people as possible.
In terms of selecting a program and a place to
study, getting in touch with as many people as
possible who had personal experience with it
was incredibly helpful [for me.]
TSI): So, you are addicted to Jelly Bellies?
ST: You read my Facebook profile as well? 1
haven't changed that since I was in college. My
sophomore year in Durand.our house manag
er bought four pound jars of Jelly Bellies from
Costco ... My students still make fun of me for
how much candy 1 eat. I don't claim to be a
good role model in that regard. It started in Du
rand with eating pounds of jelly bellies at a
time. 1 think they [have] remarkable flavors.
They all taste really realistic and you never get
tired of them.

me if Teach for America hadn 't approached me
about it. 1 was interested in [applying] for grad
uate school. [Applying to he a Rhodes Scholar]
wasn't ... really on my radar until Teach for
America came up with the idea.
TSD: What is the best thing about Stanford?
ST:That's an impossible question! 1 have got to
go with the people. The campus is beautiful of
course, but 1 think the people are the most re
markable thing about my Stanford experience,
both the professors and the students. 1 had a
chance to meet and build relationship with a lot
amazing professors. My Psychology adviser

Hazel Markus |and] my Political Science Pro
fessor Gerhard Casper ... are just [a] few of the
people that I got to know well.
TSI): What was your favorite class?
ST:That's another impossible question! 1 don't
know that I can identify a favorite class. One
class that got me started down the path that
that 1 have pursued was IHUM Class-C'itizen
ship. taught by Professor Casper. My Sopho
more College program in Constitutionalism,
which he also taught, was remarkable and guid-

"The people are
the most
remarkable thing
about my
Stanford experience."
SCOTT THOMPSON '06,
2008 Rhodes Scholar

Ed me towards law school, which 1 think I will
eventually.pursue. I had a lot of chances to take
a lot of classes outside my majors and the free
dom to do that. 1 took an amazing class on
Greek history, a class on studies in Christianity
in late antiquity, a class on the Book of Genesis
[and] a class on Shakespeare.
TSD: What is working for Teach for America
like'.'
ST: It is important to know that 1 teach in New
York public schools. Teaching in |New York
City is| quite an experience. And by far the
most challenging [thing] that 1 have ever done.
It is also wonderful to be doing something that
1 know has a positive effect ... on one of the
most serious issues facing our country today:
the achievement gap between disadvantaged
students and their more advantaged peers. And

it's just a lot of fun.
TS1): What do you think about the choice fac
ing graduating seniors between going into pub
lic service or the private sector?
ST: I think people need to find something that is
fulfilling for them. And people are fulfilled by a
variety of things. 1 was concerned that Teach for
America would not perhaps provide me with a
very clear sense of what 1 want to do afterwards.
Hut I really found it has very much given me a
better sense of what 1 care about, what I am in
terested in and what 1 am passionate about. I
don't think something like Teach for America is
for everybody. You need to be doing it because
you are sincerely interested and care about
these issues and 1 think there are variety of ways
you can apply the skills that will help you to be
successful down the road.
TSI): Any advice you would give to Stanford
students now that you have graduated?
ST: Certainly [take] advantage of all the oppor
tunities at your disposal. Explore as many
things as possible — and that takes the form of
taking classes in other departments that you
might not be majoring in. [Get] involved in as
many internships and extra-curricular activi
ties as you can. [Mv] biggest regret from my un
dergraduate career was not going abroad. 1
spent a semester in Washington, which was
great. But 1 wished 1 had gone ahead and gone
abroad.
TSI): Any advice you would give to Stanford
students applying to international fellowships?
ST: This is advice that 1 read and heard many
times: [start] working on it early and get advice
and feedback from as many people as possible.
In terms of selecting a program and a place to
study, getting in touch with as many people as
possible who had personal experience with it
was incredibly helpful [for me.]
TSI): So, you are addicted to Jelly Bellies?
ST: You read my Facebook profile as well? 1
haven't changed that since I was in college. My
sophomore year in Durand.our house manag
er bought four pound jars of Jelly Bellies from
Costco ... My students still make fun of me for
how much candy 1 eat. I don't claim to be a
good role model in that regard. It started in Du
rand with eating pounds of jelly bellies at a
time. 1 think they [have] remarkable flavors.
They all taste really realistic and you never get
tired of them.
