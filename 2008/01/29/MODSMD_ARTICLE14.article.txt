## Editorial Board Surgical abortion rates decline as alternatives increase 
### 
According to the widely accepted
Guttmacher Institute report re
leased on Jan. 17. the number of sur
gical abortions nationwide has decreased by
around 25 percent since 1990, a trend
deemed commendable by both pro-choice
and pro-life advocates. Surgical abortions
are increasingly supplanted by both medica
tion abortions — a daily regimen of pills
that prevents fertilized eggs from develop
ing further — and by hormonal contracep
tion methods.This shift away from surgeries
is an estimable development that should be
continued and encouraged.
Although many pro-life advocates claim
that the decrease in surgical abortions has
been a direct result of their endorsement
and adoption of anti-abortion legislation,
the states that have experienced the largest
decreases in surgical abortions are those
least affected by pro-life activists. According
to Americans United for Life, Oregon is the
most pro-choice state in the union, but the
Beaver State witnessed a 25 percent drop in
abortions between 2000 and 2005. Another
heavily pro-choice state. California also ex
perienced a drop in abortions significantly
greater than the national average.
In a recent Los Angeles Times article,
Pomona College's John Seery said that the
change in abortion numbers can be attrib
uted to shifting attitudes of women, or as he
called it,"the Juno' effect." In his article
with the same name, Seery described this
shift as an increased decisiveness in women.
For example, those who choose to get an
abortion are deciding to do so earlier than
previous generations — 90 percent of surgi
cal abortions are now in the first trimester,
and f>o percent are within the first eight
weeks. Seery also notes that larger numbers
of women are using contraceptives and
other preventative measures.
In addition to these preemptive options,
the decline in surgical abortions can be par
tially attributed to medication. A Jan. 17 Los
Angeles Times article by Stephanie Simon

notes that, "women looking to end early
pregnancies are gravitating to medication
abortions, in which they take two pills under
a doctor's supervision to induce miscar
riage. ITiis approach lets them avoid surgery
— and the protesters who often picket clin
ics — and expel the embryo in the privacy of
their homes." The Guttmacher Institute re
port covers the use of these pills until 2005,
when they accounted for 13 percent of all
abortions in the United States.
Although medication abortions are also
controversial, they are significantly less po
litically (and morally) polarizing than surgi
cal abortions. Emory's Alan Abramowitz
notes that, "Increasing reliance on non-sur
gical abortions is a problem for the anti
abortion movement. There is little popular
support for restricting such abortions." Mis
souri's recent attempt to place heavy finan
cial consequences on doctors dispensing the
"abortion pill" was impeded after a judge
ruled against the law.
Advocates of medication abortions
argue that both the physical and psycholog
ical side-effects of such abortions are signif
icantly less than those of surgical abortions.
The reason for this may lie in the fact that
the pill is only approved for use through the
seventh week of pregnancy, while surgical
abortions are legal as late as the 20th week.
Medication abortions are also quicker,
cheaper and often less psychologically trau
matic than attending an abortion clinic.
Although the current shift away from
surgery and toward medication and hor
monal preventive measures is laudable,
much improvement in still needed. Both
medication and surgical abortions could be
reduced further if preemptive options, such
as condoms and hormonal birth-control
pills, received more government subsidies.
Hormonal birth-control pills, hormone-re
leasing patches, implants and monthly in
serts — especially when used with condoms
are logistically, politically and morally
better options than any form of abortion.
