# Pleading Inanity
## On being blue 
### 
It's past my I-have-to-get-out-of-bed-or-else-my-day
will-be-ruined time, but I can't summon the spirit. 1
don't have anything in particular to dread about the
day: a class or two. a nice run. eating and some reading
that I, for the most part, find interesting. Still, the sum of
my exertions only succeeds in rolling me from one side to
the other and squeezing my pillow.
I'll eventually roll so far to one side that I'll fall out of
bed. though, and my collision with the ground will jar my
consciousness. Standing up will be a chore, but it'll prob
ably be worth the while, since it will jumpstart my body
into the basic set of motions that I've programmed into it
over the years.
I'd like to think that, as a mostly functioning male, my
emotional states come in three flavors: hunger, fatigue
and sexual frustration. About once a month, more than
one of these sentiments combine for a truly wild ride.
Otherwise, I just pass through time grunting approval
when things go my way. and grunting disapproval when
things don't.
Yet. some days, especially when it's rainy and yucky
out, a novel set of hormones are released and I am left be
fuddled. I low am I to deal with this lethargic languor, this
sluggish stupor?
Among the immediately disregarded advice that my
career counselor gave me was the gem that life, especial
ly in professional school, is one continuous job interview.
Professors are possible sources of recommendations, fel
low students are future colleagues and undergraduates
are potential second wives. As such, each and every day
you should be wearing your game face, projecting confi
dence and assuring these people that. yes. they should
desire you as a research assistant/co-worker/sugar
daddy.
So what does that leave me to do with my nagging
melancholy? All our pop culture psycho-babble offers lit
tle aid. The plethora of self-help literature only serves to
deepen my sense of personal responsibility. If I want to be
happy. I should just "awaken the giant within," get some
"life strategies" and/or implement "seven habits that are
highly effective in making friends and influencing peo
ple."
But Vishnu, you might say. in a good liberal society,
people are accountable for their own well-being, so why
don't you stop suckling from the public teat, pull up your

pants, and put on some boots with which to strap yourself
to self-sufficiency?
If only it were that easy, dear reader, if only it were that
easy In my opinion, the concept of "personal responsibil
ity" rarely does the work that we would like it to. whether
in keeping the communal kitchen clean or in making life
changes. Our genes and early environment determine
our baseline temperament and disposition, and with age
these characteristics only become more fixed. Doesn't it
seem pointless to ask Eeyore to be more like Piglet, or to
ask Bashful to be Dopey?
On the plus side — if it can be called that — it is gen
erally agreed that pessimists have a more accurate per
ception of reality than optimists. ITius, as sad as the
thought may be,it's not unlikely that the happy among us
just don't realize how crappy life actually is. both in gen
eral and in particular.
I'd be irresponsible if I didn't include the following
disclaimer: although it's completely natural to feel down
from time to time, at a certain point medical help may be
appropriate for treating depression. People who experi
ence the following symptoms for at least two weeks fall
into this latter category: persistent depressed mood or
anhedonia. accompanied by problems sleeping, a change
in appetite, loss of energy, low self-esteem or difficulty
concentrating.
As for my case. well. I'm happy to report that my blues
have pretty much subsided. And.since I'm in a more chip
per mood. I've decided to give everyone I come across an
extra big smile and an extra tight hug. Because even
though the clouds have passed and the sun's now shining
on me, you can never really tell who might be a little
under the weather.
