## Scrabulous 
### 
If there's one thing I've learned so far in Sleep and
Dreams, it's that when it comes to wasting time in lec
ture, Scrabulous is in. Forget relics like AIM and Drug
Wars. Nowadays the cool kids are the ones with eyes glued
to a virtual Scrabble board.
What happened to the good ol' days, when lectures
used to be about passing notes and whispering with the
real-live person next toyou?Talk about a bunch of 2.0 los
ers. Determined to jump on the Scrabble bandwagon
without surrendering to. the godless Applications trend. I
decided to kick it old school, and seek out a local Scrabble
group in the area.
A little online research quickly revealed that Palo Alto
is home to not one but two Scrabble clubs: a Thursday
group which meets on California Ave.; and a Monday one
which meets at the El Camino Boston Market.
My friends Sam and Sean decided to tag along, and
Sean, as the driver, quickly made the executive decision
that Boston Market was the worst possible location for a
Scrabble tournament. So, we headed down to California
Ave. instead. Arriving at the cafe though, we found the
tournament to be a bit different than expected.
While the online details for the event had described
the players as a "low key. casual, friendly group," such a
collection was nowhere to be found. Instead, we saw only
one middle-aged man,sitting with a box of Scrabble on his
table
Sizing up the competition, Sam and Sean wanted to
back out. Claiming that they couldn't fight my "last bat
tle" as a columnist for me. the boys threatened to go across
the street to the Nut House. Luckily, their insatiable desire
for Scrabble got the best of them, and they eventually re
lented to come inside and play.
The man at the table was Matt, the event's organizer
and a Palo Alto high school English teacher. Excited we
had showed up. Matt was eager to start playing. We drew
our seven letters, and quickly got down to business.
An uneven distribution of vowels meant that most of
our words ended up being pretty pathetic. Luckily this
gave us plenty of time to go over the basic chit-chat: Sam
and Sean are both econ majors; I like Russia; Matt didn't
know what lox and bagels were until he enrolled at Bran
deis College, etc...
To be honest though, most of the conversation was
rather depressing. Matt had been teaching for a while, and

he was getting pretty siek of it. \ le graded about 3.(XX) pages
of writing a year, and the job's biggest consolation was the
hope that his students would go on to remember him.
Sean thought this would be a good time to mention
how much he hadn 't liked high school English. Sam and 1
tried not to hide under the table.
Later on. I asked Matt if he ever went to the Monday
Boston Market Scrabble games. He said he had choir
practice Mondays. And besides, he had beef with the guy
who organized the event.
"I've met him in person," Matt confided,"and he's not
a very nice person."
He added: "He's also started poaching my players."
Apparently Matt's Boston Market nemesis had taken
to messaging players who had RSVPed to Matt's online
ad. urging them to attend his own gathering instead.
Starting to get excited. I asked if this guy was an Eng
lish teacher from a rival high school.
He wasn't.
At the end of our first game. Sam came out the victor,
beating both Sean and me, as well as our fearless leader.
When we declined to play another game. Matt looked dis
appointed. For the past few weeks, he told us. he had been
getting RSVPs from people planning to come to the meet
ings, but usually no one showed up.
Sam. Sean and I all felt bad about leaving Matt there
alone. But not as bad as when we realized we had forgot
ten to pay the $2-per-player fee he had stipulated in his
ad.
While we had trouble figuring out on what the $2 might
actually be spent, we knew one thing was for sure â€” a
dying business like "live person-playing Scrabble" needs
as many $2 as it can get.
