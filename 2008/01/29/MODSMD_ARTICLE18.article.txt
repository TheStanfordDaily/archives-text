## Prominent Obama donor jailed 
### MIKE ROBINSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHICAGO - An indicted businessman who poured
thousands of dollars into the campaigns of Barack
Obama and other politicians was jailed Monday after
prosecutors disclosed he received $3.5 million from an
Iraqi billionaire while claiming to be broke.
Real estate developer and fast-food entrepreneur
Antoin "Tony" Rezko was arrested Monday at his
home in Wilmette and held after his attorneys failed
to dissuade Judge Amy J. St. Eve from revoking his $2
million bond.
"This defendant has played a shell game and 1
think misled the court about what his assets are," fed
eral prosecutor Reid J. Schar said.
Rezko is charged with scheming to pressure com
panies seeking state business for kickbacks and cam
paign contributions.
His name has surfaced in the Democratic presiden
tial race because of his ties to Obama. who ended up
donating to charity thousands of dollars in campaign
contributions connected to Rezko. During a South
Carolina debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton accused
Obama of representing Rezko "in his slum landlord
business" when Obama was a young Chicago lawyer.
Obama actually represented partners of Rezko's
company in government-subsidized apartment reha
bilitation projects, not Rezko himself. Obama says he
did no more than five or six hours of work for the part
ners.
Rezko has contributed thousands of dollars to the
campaigns of both Obama and Gov. Rod Blagojevich
- neither of whom is accused of any wrongdoing.
Rezko is due to start trial Feb. 25 on charges of mail
fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and attempted
extortion. He is charged separately with swindling the
General Electric Capital Corp. out of $10 million in
the sale of a pizza restaurant business.
Obama's name has not come up in connection with
any of the corruption charges swirling around Rezko.
Prosecutors indicate the source of Rezko's clout
was somewhere within Blagojevich's administration.
Federal prosecutors say Rezko was deceptive in
leading St. Eve to allow various relatives and friends
to post their property to secure his bond while claim
ing he was broke and living off relatives' generosity.
An FBI affidavit said Rezko actually received $3.5
million from a Lebanon-based bank account of Gen
eral Mediterranean Holdings, a Luxembourg compa-

Ny owned by London-based Iraqi billionaire Adhmi
Auchi. Rezko's attorney said Rezko has had business
dealings with Auchi.
Forbes magazine listed Auchi in 2007 as the world's
279 th richest man. He also has been convicted of fraud
in France, the government said in a court filing seek
ing the warrant to arrest Rezko.
Prosecutors said in their filing that $3.5 million was
wired into a fund maintained at a Chicago bank by at
torneys handling Rezko's tangled finances. They said
the money was later transferred into other accounts
and disbursed within a week.
Some of the money was transferred directly to
Rezko,some to a company he owned,some to his wife,
Rita, and some to friends and relatives who had post
ed their homes to secure his bond, according to the fil
ings. Rezko's legal bills also were paid with a portion
of the money, they said.
A 62-acre parcel south of downtown Chicago has
been described as Rezko's major asset. The judge did
not require him to post it as part of his bond after he
described it as not a liquid asset and of speculative
value only. But the government said Rezko has since
"transferred, restructured or sold" much of his inter
est in the property.
In one of several filings Monday, prosecutors said
they have a cooperating informant who claims to have
seen documents describing Rezko's transfer of "a sig
nificant portion of his 62-acre property" to General
Mediterranean.The informant understood the trans
fer to be in exchange for General Mediterranean for
giving $20 million in debt, according to prosecutors.
St. Eve reminded Rezko that when she granted
him bond, she had ordered him to keep her advised of
any changes in the tract's ownership.
Defense attorney Joseph Duffy tried to take some
of the blame himself, saying he may not have ade
quately explained to Rezko his obligations. St. Eve
brushed that aside, saying Duffy was not in any way at
fault.
Monday's hearing was confused at some points.
Duffy told St. Eve that the $3.5 million payment from
General Mediterranean had been a loan secured by
Rezko's interest in the 62-acre parcel. A minute later,
he interrupted the proceedings to say he had just been
told that it was not.
"I am not convinced by what 1 am hearing today,"
St. Eve said.
She scheduled a hearing Tuesday for Rezko's
lawyers.
