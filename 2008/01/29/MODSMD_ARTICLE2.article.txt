## Speakers bemoan loss of Iraqi art Both stress deep history of art, recent plunder of museums 
### MOHAMMAD ALI 
In a forum at Kresge Auditorium last
night.scholars discussed a side of Iraq rarely
covered in the nightly news: the rich artistic
history of the country.
"While we all hear about Iraq in the news,
we don't hear that Iraq had a thriving cul
ture." said Nada Shabout. a professor of
Arab visual and Islamic art at the University
of North Texas.
As the third out of five conversations in
the "Iraq: Reframe: Iraq's Lost National
Treasures" series, last night's event aimed to
reframe popular conceptions of Iraq with a
focus on the arts.
McGuire Gibson, an archaeologist from
the University of Chicago, spoke alongside
Shabout at the event, while Stanford's Iran
ian Studies Program Director Abbas Milani
served as moderator.
Iraq was once the center of
Mesopotamia, one of the world's earliest civ
ilizations. and the allure of its ancient art ex
ists through the present. 1 lowever. Shabout
fears that the violence in the Middle Eastern
state today will overshadow Iraqi art and its
storied history.

"In a couple of years, it is going to be dif
ficult to talk about Iraqi art at all," she said.
Since the start of the Iraq War in 2003,
more than 15.000 valuable items have been
stolen from the National Museum of Iraq.
Looters have stolen a variety of historical ar
tifacts. often receiving $50.()00-plus for each
item on the black market.
In last nights presentation. Shabout em
phasized the devastating impact of the Iraq
War on the fate of Iraqi art. Because of the
volatile political situation in Iraq and the vi
olent aftermath of the initial occupation,
many Iraqi artists have either been killed or
tied the country.
Indeed, Shabout said that the art acade

my in Iraq "has almost no faculty to teach
anymore."
Gibson, a leading authority on ancient
Mesopotamia, criticized the U.S. govern
ment for failing to protect the National Mu
seum of Iraq from destruction.
"I. along with others, went to the Penta
gon in the months preceding the war and
warned that sites would be looted if Bagh
dad [were] taken." he said.
However, according to Gibson, the U.S.
military arrived five days after the museum
had already been ransacked, and even today,
hundreds of archaeological sites are still
