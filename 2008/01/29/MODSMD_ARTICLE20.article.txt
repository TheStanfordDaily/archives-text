## Democrats respond to Bush's speech 
### LAURIE KELLMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - Democrats in the
midst of their own roiling presiden
tial nomination fight followed Presi
dent Bush's State of the Union ad
dress not so much with a response as
with their own theme of bipartisan
cooperation.
Their messenger Monday night
was Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius,
a red-state Democrat touted by con
gressional leaders as a symbol of bi
partisanship.
"In this time, normally reserved
for the partisan response, 1 hope to
offer you something more: an Amer
ican response," Sebelius said from
the governor's mansion in Topeka.
"There is a chance, Mr. President, in
the next 357 days, to get real results
and give the American people re
newed optimism that their chal
lenges are the top priority."
Her remarks followed criticism
last week by Democratic congres
sional leaders that was plenty parti
san. They demanded that Bush ac
complish a string of Democratic ob
jectives that he was unlikely to con

sider in the last year of his adminis
tration.
In a softer tone than the Democ
rats' last week, Sebelius invited Bush
to take a series of legislative actions
Democrats want, such as signing a
bill he's vetoed twice to expand fed
eral health care coverage from 6 mil
lion to 10 million children.
"Join us, Mr. President, sign the
bill and let's get to work," she said.
Democrats aren't holding their
breath for a presidential change of
heart, and that was just the point.
The Democrats were aiming
more for drawing distinctions with
Bush than creating consensus in an
election year with'the presidency and
their majorities at stake.
But the divide between the De
mocrats' own presidential candi
dates were hard to miss for its bitter
ness. After weeks of sniping, rivals
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack
Obama arrived in the same I louse
chamber for the same annual speech
and sat in the same row.
The chances of good coming from
the proximity were scant. Indeed,
photos captured a split-second snub:
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy who hours

earlier had endorsed Obama over
Clinton, reached out to shake her
hand when she came near. Obama,
who was sitting between them, had
turned away.
A doorkeeper, caught between it
all,cringes in the photo that captures
the moment.
It was pretty dramatic stuff com
pared to the going-away speech of a
lame-duck president and the De
mocrats' follow-up.
In many ways, it was Obama's day.
Sebelius also had endorsed Obama.
She didn't mention it. but she includ
ed a line that echoed President
Kennedy's inaugural address in 1%1.
Kennedy said then."Ask not what
your country can do for you; ask
what you can do for your country."
InTopeka Monday night. Sebelius
said: "We are tired of leaders who.
rather than asking what we can do for
our country, ask nothing of us at all."
On policy, Sebelius made refer
ence to the short-term stimulus pack
age I louse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and
Bush announced last week, suggest
ing that "a temporary fix is only the
first step toward meeting our chal
lenges and solving our problems."
