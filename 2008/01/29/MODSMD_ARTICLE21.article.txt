## MEN DROP FIRST DUALS 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
Hie Stanford men's tennis team fought hard but
couldn't muster up enough this weekend, suffering two
non-conference defeats in TUlsa. Okla. On Friday, the
Cardinal dropped a 4-3 match to TUlsa University and
on Saturday the Cardinal lost 7-0 to the University of
Georgia. .

"It was a tough weekend, no question," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "But we gained experi
ence and learned a lot. For our young team it was

something that we'll grow from, for sure."
For both matches this weekend, the Cardinal
featured three freshman, two juniors and a

sophomore in the starting lineup. Sophomore
Richard Wire and freshman Greg Hirshman

won at No. 3 doubles to open the match on
Friday, butTUlsa's top doubles tandems took

the next two points as Hilsa's Andy Con
nelly and Ross Cunningham defeated

junior Matt Bruch and

freshman Alex Gayton. Arnau Brugues and Ricardo So
riano of Tblsa beat junior Blake Muller and freshman Ted
Kelly to round out the action . The doubles would be the
deciding point of the match as Stanford went on to win
three out of the six singles matches.
Gayton, the second-ranked player in the country, beat
Soriano — No. 44 in the nation — 6-3,6-7 (7-3), 6-1. At
the third spot, Wire defeated Will Gray, 7-5,6-1 and Hir
shman was victorious at Stanford's sixth slot over Ross
Cunningham 6-4,7-6.
Gayton and fellow freshman Kelly both commented
on having their first dual match in such a tough setting.
Both admitted that there were some nerves, but that it
was a good experience.
"It's something that I'll get used to," Kelly said.
On Saturday, the Cardinal played No. 2 Georgia tough
until the end, but came up empty. Stanford was down
early after losing the doubles point, but pulled it together

at beginning of the singles
matches.
Playing at No. 1

for singles, Bruch took the first set off of the fourth
ranked player in the nation,lira vis Helgeson,6-4. Howev
er, he would ultimately fall to Helgeson. 4-6,6-3,1 -0 (10-
8). At the third spot for singes, Wire played tough, but fell
to Jamie Hunt, 7-6(7), 6-1, after losing a 9-7 tiebreaker in
the first set.
From there, Georgia took over and blanked the Car
dinal, winning all six singles matches Bruch's match went
to a third set, but since Georgia had already clinched the
team match a single tiebreak was played to decide the
match. The tiebreak was close, but Bruch ended up
falling, 10-8.
"I played well [versus Hilsa's Gray]," Wire said. "I
found my range in that match. It was a real tight match
[against Georgia] for me. 1 played a good first set, but 1
might not have been as match-ready as I thought ."
'•[Georgia] played a great match " Whitlinger said.
"It's a great thing for our team to play the best and see
what they do."

Muller pointed out that few teams opt to start their
seasons against top opponents in unfavorable condi
tions. Though some matches were close enough
that a few points were the difference, in all the
k. ' , • " '
