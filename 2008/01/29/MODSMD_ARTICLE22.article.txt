## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes it seems like fate is just against
you. The Cardinal women faced quite a few
challenges this past Sunday — gloomy weath
er. closed roads and pollution-filled Los An
geles — leading up to their match against the
eighth-ranked UCLA Bruins.
"Well, it's never ideal to sit on a bus for so
long the day before the meet." junior Kelly
Fee said. "But honestly.it was nice to relax and
not be too stressed before the competition."
Ihe closed roads and rain did not stop the
No. ( ) Cardinal from meeting No.S UCLA for
the team's first away meet of the 2008 season.
But in a incredibly close match, Stanford fell
to the Bruins in heartbreaking fashion,
195.050-195.025.

'Hie Bruins may have come out with a win,
but it was not a particularly high scoring meet
for either team.
"Neither of the teams did very well." junior
Heather Purnell said." 1 lowever, we did just a
little bit worse. Both teams need to tighten up
[their] work and represent the Pac-10 a little
better."
The Cardinal started off strong, getting
solid performances on vault and bars. Sopho
more Allyse Ishino led the squad with the top
score on vault. 9.875. Junior Nicole Ourada
earned the team's second highest score with a
9.850.
On the second rotation. Stanford landed
on the bars, where Ishino shined again, tying
with seniorTabitha Yim for the team's highest
score. 9.900. Ishino and Yim tied with UCLA
freshman Jordan Schwikert for the highest

bars score of the meet.
Fee added depth to the team's bar routine,
earning a 9.875 to help the Cardinal win the
bars event overall.
The Cardinal led the Bruins after the first
two rotations by more than a full point. Unfor
tunately, Stanford was unable to overcome
challenges on beam and floor and the Bruins
closed the gap.
Despite strong routines from Purnell, Ishi
no and Ourada, the beam proved to be a diffi
cult event for the Cardinal. For the second
week in a row, the team struggled on an event
that was the foundation of the team's strength
last year.
Purnell. Ishino and Ourada each earned a
9.775.
