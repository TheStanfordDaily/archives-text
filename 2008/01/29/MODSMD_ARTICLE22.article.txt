# CARD LOSES TO UCLA BY .025
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes it seems like fate is just against
you. The Cardinal women faced quite a few
challenges this past Sunday — gloomy weath
er. closed roads and pollution-filled Los An
geles — leading up to their match against the
eighth-ranked UCLA Bruins.
"Well, it's never ideal to sit on a bus for so
long the day before the meet." junior Kelly
Fee said. "But honestly.it was nice to relax and
not be too stressed before the competition."
Ihe closed roads and rain did not stop the
No. ( ) Cardinal from meeting No.S UCLA for
the team's first away meet of the 2008 season.
But in a incredibly close match, Stanford fell
to the Bruins in heartbreaking fashion,
195.050-195.025.

'Hie Bruins may have come out with a win,
but it was not a particularly high scoring meet
for either team.
"Neither of the teams did very well." junior
Heather Purnell said." 1 lowever, we did just a
little bit worse. Both teams need to tighten up
[their] work and represent the Pac-10 a little
better."
The Cardinal started off strong, getting
solid performances on vault and bars. Sopho
more Allyse Ishino led the squad with the top
score on vault. 9.875. Junior Nicole Ourada
earned the team's second highest score with a
9.850.
On the second rotation. Stanford landed
on the bars, where Ishino shined again, tying
with seniorTabitha Yim for the team's highest
score. 9.900. Ishino and Yim tied with UCLA
freshman Jordan Schwikert for the highest

bars score of the meet.
Fee added depth to the team's bar routine,
earning a 9.875 to help the Cardinal win the
bars event overall.
The Cardinal led the Bruins after the first
two rotations by more than a full point. Unfor
tunately, Stanford was unable to overcome
challenges on beam and floor and the Bruins
closed the gap.
Despite strong routines from Purnell, Ishi
no and Ourada, the beam proved to be a diffi
cult event for the Cardinal. For the second
week in a row, the team struggled on an event
that was the foundation of the team's strength
last year.
Purnell. Ishino and Ourada each earned a
9.775.

GAME NOTES: A fortieth of a point was the difference be
tween winning and losing for the Cardinal women, who
dropped a heartbreaker to UCLA over the weekend. The
team will have two weeks off to train before heading to
Chicago, followed by a visit to lowa State before continu
ing Pac-10 competition. Stanford will next compete at
home on Feb. 24, hosting California.
Yim returned this week on floor
with another great routine, receiving
a y.B(H). Sophomore Tenaya West,
who exhibited a high-energy floor
routine against Georgia and Ari
zona. pulled through again this week
and tied with Yim for the team's high
est score.
Ourada also shone in Los Angeles
as the team's only AU-Arounder,
competing on each event and giving
the Cardinal solid scores on vault,
bars and beam. She came in third

overall in the meet with a 38.6.
Unfortunately, it was not enough
for the Cardinal to stay ahead of the
Bruins.
For Fee, the meet proved that the
Cardinal's performances come down
to doing the team doing its best every
time out.
"Consistency has been an impor
tant goal for our team and I'd like to
continue giving the team a few solid
routines to count on." she said. "This
past meet taught me that every little
detail counts and we should try to
save every tenth we can."
It may not be the easiest lesson to
learn, but the Stanford women are
taking it in stride.
"I think we need to get back into

the gym and address the issues that
came up this weekend," Purnell
added. "We need to stay on top of
each other and not let little mistakes
be passed by anymore."
The Cardinal may not have pulled
out a win. but the nail-biting meet
and the incredibly close score prove
that the Pac-10 teams are ready for
the rest of the year.
Stanford will now have a two
week break to rejuvenate, as they
hope to improve on the details that
cost them against UCLA. The team
will next compete on Feb. 9 at the
Chicago Style Invitational.
