The Stanford wrestlers put themselves in a dominant position in the Pac-10 with their victories this weekend and now boast a 3-1 conference
record. After a win this weekend over rival Cal State Bakersfield, the Cardinal will be in Oregon next weekend, grappling with the defending
champions of the conference from Oregon State This year's Pac-10 winner will be determined at the end-of-season meet in early March.
ponent off the mat and bringing him
down hard for two points, the win
and a measure of momentum for his
team.
"I was just focusing on keeping
him in good position, getting him
tired and wearing him down so I
could score more points later in the
match," Johnson said of his match's
opening. "[But when you get him in
the air] you're pretty sure you've got
him, and it even becomes a little bit
fun at that point. You've just got to
make sure to finish in good position
and hopefully take him to the mat."
Johnson would do just that, going
on to win 8-3 and increasing the Car
dinal's team lead to 16-10. Shortly
thereafter, senior Tanner Gardner
iced the dual for Stanford at 125
pounds when he pinned Bakers
field's Zack Bigboy at the 2:57 mark.
The pin was a personal-best fifteenth
of the year for Gardner, who ran his
record to an amazing 30-1 on the sea
son.
"He's doing a great job, and it's
nothing less than we'd expect," head
coach Kerry McCoy said of Gardner.
"It's really a credit to his workout
partners and [assistant] coach
[Jason] Borrelli. They've really put
the time in and helped him with the
things he needed to work on, and
he's made the total commitment.

GAME NOTES; The Cardinal notched three
wins this weekend, with a solid win over Cal
State Bakersfield followed by two dominant
victories against Merilo College and Port

degree.
"We're expecting nothing but the
best from all our guys and he's the
leader of our team. So that's the guy
we're riding to the end."
The Cardinal continued to roll on
Friday night, trouncing NAIA oppo
nent Menlo College 30-11 and con
ference opponent Portland State (1-
8. 0-6) by an even more lopsided
score of 38-3. While numerous Stan
ford wrestlers put forth excellent
showings — the squad won 16 of 20
matches on Friday—junior Luke
Feist's 3-0 finish on his own matches
over the weekend at 174 pounds was
an encouraging sign for the team's
future in the coming month.
Feist had missed competition
with injuries early in the year, but ap
peared healthy and ready for compe

tition in a pair of hotly-contested,
single-point wins over his Viking and
Roadrunner opponents. Adding to
those victories was his 21-4 technical
fall victory against Menlo's Sean
Weeks.
Together with Johnson and re
turning Pac-10 Co-Freshman of the
year, Zack Giesen at 184 pounds.
Feist helps make up what is rapidly
becoming the strength of the Cardi
nal's lineup from 174 to 197 pounds.
"I told those guys a couple of
weeks ago. Luke, Zach and Jake,
that's a pretty good combo." McCoy
said. "And if we can keep that rolling
every time.no matter what the situa
tion is — if things aren't going well,
maybe those guys can bring us back.
If things aren't going well, they might
be able to bury it. So it's really good
to have those guys start to come of
age."
But perhaps the most exciting as
pect of a team that won 22 of 30
matches overall in its most recent
spate of competition is the team
wide belief that the best is yet to
come for this crop of Cardinal
wrestlers.
"1 think we're wrestling really hard,
but we just need to tighten things up
a little bit." Feist said. "Some people
are making some mistakes they
shouldn't be, but we're wrestling re
ally hard and we're in great shape
right now. We're really making a
good run towards the post-season.
So I'm excited — we can do better,
but I 'm excited for ritiht now."
