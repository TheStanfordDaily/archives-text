## My life as a die-hard sports fan 
### 
The NFL playoffs have made me
introspective. As I've watched my
New York Giants make their im
probable run through the NFC
bracket and into the Super Bowl,
Fve reflected on the sports fan with
in me.
With the exception of a few per
sonal tragedies, the most emotional
ly intense moments of my life have
been sports-related: Aaron Boone's
walk-off homerun in the 2003 ALCS,
Tino Martinez's grand-slam in the
1998 World Series, Allan Houston's
runner in the lane in the 1999 NBA
playoffs and Stanford's upset of
USC this year, just to name a few.
The die-hard sports fan is a hard
creature to understand. We care
about events whose outcomes we
can't affect; we invest our time,
money and intellect in games that, in
a general sense, don't mean any
thing. We are relentless in our pas
sion and display it at every turn.
Why?
So much of our lives fall into gray
areas where we can't be sure if we've
succeeded or failed. Sports are the
exception. Sports are a black and
white industry: at the end of games
and seasons, there are distinct win
ners and losers.
And along the way, we all bear
witness. Sports are remarkably egal
itarian — socioeconomic status, race
and origin are all thrown out when it
comes to fandom. We stand togeth
er. CEOs with delivery boys, as our
teams compete. When our teams
win. we can all claim our share of the
victory; when they lose, we collec
tively bemoan our defeat.
The same goes for our critiques of
our teams' performances. There is
no formal training for being a fan
anyone can participate. Our views,
particularly in the face of the failure!
vary: some will be quick to point a
linger at the coaches, management
and players. Others will focus on the
positives and what can he learned
for the next game or season. And
some will hold their commentary, or
find a middle ground, and tell them
selves and others to "wait 'till next
year." It is our prerogative, no mat
ter what we think, do or say.
In all situations, true fans can find
the art in the contest. Outsiders look
at four-hour-long baseball games
and question how anyone can hold
their focus. But die-hards and stu
dents of the game see it differently:
we notice how a third baseman
creeps up onto the infield grass; how
a pitcher shakes off signs: how a de
fense shifts; and how a batter adjusts
to each pitch When a manager sends
up a pinch-hitter or makes a call to
the bullpen, we know why. It's not
that we're all-knowing, or even
close: it's that we are so involved

with the game that we feel connect
ed to the players, coaches and every
decision involved.
Iliis creates part of the fun and
excitement we experience from
watching and analyzing sporting
events. It also drives up our passion.
Sports can spike and deflate emo
tions almost instantly.They get a rise
out of the most introverted people,
and silence the loudest trash-talkers.
Emotions run high at all times, and
not just as a result of on-field events,
like in the above examples.
As Stanford fans, we held our
breaths when the Baltimore Ravens
announced they hired Harbaugh as
their new head coach, and collective
ly exhaled when we found out it was
John, the Philadelphia assistant, who
had accepted the job. and not our Jim.
When ESPN reported that Wig
gins had been suspended indefinite
ly. we paused until we heard that it
was Connecticut's Doug, and not
Stanford's Candice. who was being
punished.
That moment of dull pain, fol
lowed by the warm feeling of relief is

one of many things that we experi
ence on the journey that is fandom.
It is a long experience that can po
tentially span a lifetime — I was
horn rooting for my hometown
teams, and it is hard for me to imag
ine a situation that would lead me to
change my allegiances. Loyalty is
hardened over time, as we experi
ence the highs and lows of our fa
vorite franchises.
It's impossible to experience the
Giants' playoff run without looking
hack on their season, when they
were left for dead after an 0-2 start,
rebounded, but struggled down the
stretch, only to peak when it mat
tered most. Their season encapsu
lates the fans' experience over
games, seasons or many years.
Through all the trials and tribula
tions. we persevere, because the
emotions we feel when our teams
succeed are among the most satisfy
ing in the world.
