## My life as a die-hard sports fan 
### 
The NFL playoffs have made me
introspective. As I've watched my
New York Giants make their im
probable run through the NFC
bracket and into the Super Bowl,
Fve reflected on the sports fan with
in me.
With the exception of a few per
sonal tragedies, the most emotional
ly intense moments of my life have
been sports-related: Aaron Boone's
walk-off homerun in the 2003 ALCS,
Tino Martinez's grand-slam in the
1998 World Series, Allan Houston's
runner in the lane in the 1999 NBA
playoffs and Stanford's upset of
USC this year, just to name a few.
The die-hard sports fan is a hard
creature to understand. We care
about events whose outcomes we
can't affect; we invest our time,
money and intellect in games that, in
a general sense, don't mean any
thing. We are relentless in our pas
sion and display it at every turn.
Why?
So much of our lives fall into gray
areas where we can't be sure if we've
succeeded or failed. Sports are the
exception. Sports are a black and
white industry: at the end of games
and seasons, there are distinct win
ners and losers.
And along the way, we all bear
witness. Sports are remarkably egal
itarian â€” socioeconomic status, race
and origin are all thrown out when it
comes to fandom. We stand togeth
er. CEOs with delivery boys, as our
teams compete. When our teams
win. we can all claim our share of the
victory; when they lose, we collec
tively bemoan our defeat.
The same goes for our critiques of
our teams' performances. There is
no formal training for being a fan
anyone can participate. Our views,
particularly in the face of the failure!
vary: some will be quick to point a
linger at the coaches, management
