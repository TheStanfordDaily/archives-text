# Delayed dual season set to start with Davis
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Go to bed early, try to sleep de
spite the noise and bike to classes in
the morning.
Compete and win against the top
players in the nation by afternoon.
Such are the dual lives of the
members of the No. 2 Stanford
women's tennis team as they prepare
to open the dual-match season at
home today against UC-Davis. Hie
match is scheduled for a 1:30 p.m
start.
After a rain-soaked weekend, the
Cardinal find themselves facing a
tough four-day stretch of three
matches at the Taube Family Tennis
Center. However, according to head
coach Lele Forood, there was a silver
lining to all of the clouds and rain.
"We're just so excited to finally get
on the courts, especially after all of
the rain we've had for the last couple
weeks," Forood said. "We've had so

many good performances in the tour
naments and we can't wait to get into
our dual-match season finally."
Although the match against Davis
was already rescheduled from Friday,
it seemed as if the highly anticipated
season opener would have to wait an
other week after the weekend rain.
But after a clear Monday, the Cardi
nal should be ready to go.
"Unfortunately, we had to change
the time so much." Forood said.
"Hopefully the fans can find us here
at 1:30."
Certainly, fan support will be key
to a strong 2008 performance.
Over the last seven years, the Car
dinal have gone 121-0 at home â€”
their last home loss was at the hands
of California in 1999. During the
streak, the Card has amassed 95
straight regular-season wins and lb
consecutive NCAA tournament
match victories at Taube.

GAME NOTES: After rain forced the Cardinal
to reschedule its season opener against UC-
Davis, the Aggies will be in the Taube Family
