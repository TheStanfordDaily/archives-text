# Delayed dual season set to start with Davis
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Go to bed early, try to sleep de
spite the noise and bike to classes in
the morning.
Compete and win against the top
players in the nation by afternoon.
Such are the dual lives of the
members of the No. 2 Stanford
women's tennis team as they prepare
to open the dual-match season at
home today against UC-Davis. Hie
match is scheduled for a 1:30 p.m
start.
After a rain-soaked weekend, the
Cardinal find themselves facing a
tough four-day stretch of three
matches at the Taube Family Tennis
Center. However, according to head
coach Lele Forood, there was a silver
lining to all of the clouds and rain.
"We're just so excited to finally get
on the courts, especially after all of
the rain we've had for the last couple
weeks," Forood said. "We've had so

many good performances in the tour
naments and we can't wait to get into
our dual-match season finally."
Although the match against Davis
was already rescheduled from Friday,
it seemed as if the highly anticipated
season opener would have to wait an
other week after the weekend rain.
But after a clear Monday, the Cardi
nal should be ready to go.
"Unfortunately, we had to change
the time so much." Forood said.
"Hopefully the fans can find us here
at 1:30."
Certainly, fan support will be key
to a strong 2008 performance.
Over the last seven years, the Car
dinal have gone 121-0 at home â€”
their last home loss was at the hands
of California in 1999. During the
streak, the Card has amassed 95
straight regular-season wins and lb
consecutive NCAA tournament
match victories at Taube.

GAME NOTES: After rain forced the Cardinal
to reschedule its season opener against UC-
Davis, the Aggies will be in the Taube Family
Tennis Center this afternoon. It will be the
first of three dual matches in a four-day span
for the Cardinal, with Fresno State coming to
the Farm on Thursday and UNLV on Friday.
The packed schedule should be good prac
tice for the Cardinal who will compete in the
four-day National Team Indoors tournament
in Wisconsin in the following week.

1 lowever. playing at home isn't as
easy as advertised, as Forood ex
plained.
"It's actually very interesting to
have so many years of defending our
home court because it's more diffi
cult to play at home than away,"
Forood said. "You have people com
ing straight out of classes and trying
to get ready for competition and
that's different than when you're on
the road and you don't have anything
you have to do before playing a ten

nis match.
"There [are] a lot of complications
playing at home so it's really nice that
we've been this successful for so long
here."
Last January. Stanford began its
2007 campaign with a dominant 7-0
victory over the Aggies.
This year, despite graduating their
top two players from last year's
squad, the team doesn't expect any
thing less.
"We've played them most years."
Forood said. "They're a good confi
dent team and they're a good opener
for us every year."
ITie Aggies are coached by a Stan
ford alumnus. Bill Maze '78. Maze
graduated the same year as Forood.

"Bill...played very successfully on
the [Stanford] men's team and tour
way back when," Forood said. "It's al
ways very fun to play against their
team and it just works out that it's a
good early season match for us every
year."
After Davis, Stanford is slated to
face No. 14 Fresno State and No. 43
UNLV in a week made rougher by
the rain.
But, perhaps the tough schedule
will work to the Cardinal's advantage
at the National Team Indoors next
week.
"As long as we can get them in. the
biggest problem will be the weather."
Forood said. "We're obviously not
used to playing this many dual

matches in a row. but it's going to get
us ready because next week is In
doors and hopefully we'll have to
play four days in a row to get to the fi
nals."
With a successful fall season. Stan
ford is looking for an equally strong
start to its 2008 team season. The
women will look to capture the
fourth national title in five years.
"Right now. our goal is to get our
lineup and doubles solidified and get
everybody playing up to speed,"
Forood said. "When we accomplish
that we're going to be as good as any
body in the country."
