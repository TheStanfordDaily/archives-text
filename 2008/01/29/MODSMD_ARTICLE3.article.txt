# Financial aid increase expected soon
## Announcement come by end of quarter 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
In the hectic and competitive world of high
er education, staying ahead and providing for
the needs of students are often one and the
same.
Financial aid initiatives from other universi
ties have continued to make headlines across
the country in recent weeks, and most recently
a Jan. 23 announcement revealed that Dart
mouth will provide free tuition for students
from families making under $75,000 per year.
Stanford is now evaluating its own financial ini
tiatives. and the University is expected to an
nounce further financial assistance initiatives
by the end of winter quarter, following a mid-
February Board of Trustees meeting.
"There's a lot of talk in the popular media
about a financial aid arms race." said Director
of Financial Aid Karen Cooper. "But what's re
ally going on is that schools are always going to
be competing for the best and brightest stu
dents."
Cooper said that Stanford aims to help all
students who need financial aid. and in negoti
ating how the University will allocate its finan
cial aid resources, concerns of retaining good
students remain paramount.
"Our goals are simple," she said. "One, we
want to make sure that every student who is ad

mitted can attend. Two, we want to make sure
that how a student is going to pay for college is
not a factor in the decision."
Heading into the Board meeting, the Uni
versity has offered no official statement about
plans for further financial aid reforms, but the
Board will draw on information that includes
surveys of current students — and especially
data from a study conducted last year, in which
middle-income families repeatedly mentioned
the heavy burden of tuition costs.
Stanford's latest high-profile financial aid
reform was announced in February 2007, when
the University committed $5 million to finan
cial assistance for middle-income families —
those with incomes ranging from $60,000 to
$135,000. Reforms from last year cut out all or
part of parental contributions — tuition plus
additional expenses — for families with in
comes up to $45,000 and $60,000. respectively.
Cooper emphasized that any reforms made
after the upcoming Board meeting could be as
much about solidifying previous gains as mov
ing on to new initiatives.
" I think we already do a really great job with
the lowest-income students." she said. "We are
going to be very careful to protect the progress
we've made there."
