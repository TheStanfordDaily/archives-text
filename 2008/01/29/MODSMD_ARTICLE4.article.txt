## Emergency notification system retooled New protocols will quickly alert campus in emergencies 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS STAFF WRITER 
University public safety officials have
begun implementing an enhanced emer
gency notification system that would alert
students in the event of a major immediate
danger on campus, including hostage situa
tions. fires or bomb threats.
Under the new system, students would
have the option of receiving mass emails,auto
mated phone calls and text messages to notify
them of a crisis incident and the precautions
they should take to keep themselves safe.
The University is also in the final stages of
developing a siren alert system that would
broadcast instructions to people outdoors
and others who do not have access to other
sources of information during an emergency.
Larry Gibbs.associate vice provost for en
vironmental health and safety, said in an
email to the Daily that these "major enhance
ments to Stanford's emergency communica
tions systems will provide an additional lay
ered approach to existing outreach."
The changes build upon the current noti
fication system by allowing administrators to
contact people through multiple communi
cation devices, including cell phones. More
over, Gibbs said that an emergency message
could be transmitted simultaneously to all
devices linked to an individual under the new
system.
"This approach greatly improves the
probability of the individual being made
aware of the emergency along with any ac
tions to be taken by campus residents." Gibbs
said.
The system would be used during inci
dents in which the University's senior admin
istration and public safety officials determine
that all or part of the campus is in imminent

/danger, Gibbs 1
said. He said such â– 
circumstances might include an active shoot
er. hostage situation, a bomb threat, a quick
ly spreading fire or another specific threat to
buildings that may require an immediate clo
sure, lockdown or evacuation.
"The need to activate the mass notifica
tion system will be evaluated on a case-by
case basis," Gibbs said.
Stanford administrators have, for a num
ber of years, placed messages on Stanford's
emergency Web site, sent messages to Stan
ford email addresses and provided central
phone numbers to call to receive emergency
messages. But Gibbs said all of these ap
proaches require an individual to glean the
information themselves after they are aware
of an emergency.
"These systems have worked well for
emergencies like an earthquake or other self
evident emergency," Gibbs said. "What Stan
ford is doing now is continuing to enhance
emergency communications to the campus
community."
Gibbs said Stanford email addresses and
phone numbers will be uploaded into the sys
tem in its initial stages.The next step, he said,
will be to encourage individuals to register
devices they use most often for communica
tion, including cell phone numbers and per
sonal email addresses.
Precautions have been taken to protect
personal identification information from
hacking or misuse, according to Gibbs.
"Stanford realizes the sensitivity sur
rounding the protection of personal contact
information and has included provisions for
protection of such information as part of the
overall program." he said.

Gibbs added that implementation
of the new notification system builds
off of lessons learned in the aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina. the recent
Southern California fires and the
shooting at Virginia Tech last April.
A Virginia state panel investigat
ing the Virginia Tech incident said in
its final report that university officials
waited too long to notify students of
the ongoing shooting incident. The
report said it was not until nearly an
hour into a meeting of the universi
ty's emergency Policy Group, made
up of senior administrators and cam
pus police, that a mass email was sent
to students. By that time several class
es were already in session in Jordan
Hall, where the shooter killed most of
his victims.
"Campus emergency communica
tion systems must have multiple
means of sharing information." the
report said, noting that an estimated
% percent of Virginia Tech students
carry cell phones that could have
been used to reach students faster

than email messages.
The report also said the initial
email message was not clear in fully
disclosing the severity of the incident
to its recipients, making it difficult for
students to know how to respond to
the emergency.
"All key facts should he included
in an alerting message, and it should
be disseminated as quickly as possi
ble, with explicit information," the re
port said.
The report also warned that uni
versities should have mu.tiple com
munication systems that do not rely
exclusively on high-level technology.
"Do not assume that 21st century
communications may survive an at
tack or natural disaster or power fail
ure," the report said.
Gibbs said he encourages students
and staff to register as many notifica
tion options as possible with the new
system.
"The more devices and accounts
an individual has registered with the
system," he said."the higher the prob
ability that an individual will receive
the emergency notification when
most needed."
