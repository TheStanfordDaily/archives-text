## Undergrads shadow law life, courseload 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday marked the first day of the
Stanford Pre-Law Society's (SPLS) Law
School Shadowing Week — a week-long
event that allows undergraduates to attend
Law School classes. Delving into issues rang
ing from capital markets to constitutional
law resolution, the program allows under

graduates interested in law to get an insid
er's glimpse into the law school experience.
As one of SPLS's most popular events, 63
undergraduates and seven law professors
are participating in this year's program.
Aiming to promote awareness and inter
est in contemporary legal issues and to pro
vide undergraduates with opportunities to
learn more about law school. SPLS has host
ed this event at the Law School since the

group's inception.
"Our primary goal is to serve as a re
source to undergraduates considering law
school." said SPLS co-President Katie Jones
*08. "By providing undergrads the opportu
nity to get a first-hand look at what law
school is really like. Shadowing Week can
play an important role in a student's decision
to apply to law school or not."
Law School Prof. Mark Lemley,
who teaches "Introduction to Intel
lectual Property Law," praised the
goals set forth by Shadowing Week.
"1 have participated since 1 arrived
here [at Stanford Law School] in
2(X)4," he said. "I think it's valuable
for undergraduates considering a ca
reer in law to get a sense of what law
school is really like, and the best way
to do that is to see it in action."
"The decision to go to law school is
very difficult and extremely signifi
cant." added Law School Prof.
Lawrence Lessig. "1 don't encourage
people to come directly to law school
from undergraduate work. But if one
is considering it. getting a clear sense
of what law school is [like] is very im
portant."
This year showed a marked in
crease in undergraduate participa
tion. With seven diverse choices of
classes to attend, this year's Shadow
ing Week has double the participation
level of last year. SPLS co-President
Katharine Wang "08 attributes this

year's success to good advertisement
and increased interest in the field of
law.
"This year, the turnout has been
phenomenal." she said. "We believe
that a mixture of good advertisement
by the executive board and an in
creasing undergraduate interest in
pre-law caused such a surge in partic
ipation."
The annual event caters to a wide
range of students, including those
who have definite plans to attend law
school and those who simply want to
learn more.
"With so many misconceptions
about law school classes floating
around, this is a valuable opportunity
for students to see the 'real deal' be
fore making a final decision about
whether to apply or not," Jones said.
"Many participants [said] it was in
teresting and even exciting to see
how law school classes are conduct
ed, whereas others [realized] that law
school wasn't really for them."
In addition to Shadowing Week,
SPLS hosts a diverse program of
speaker events, information sessions
on law school admissions and lunches
with Stanford Law School professors.
In addition to programming, the soci
ety works with Undergraduate Ad
vising and Research (UAR) and

other student organizations to build a
community for undergraduates inter
ested in law.
Though their programs have been
successful. SPLS executives are con
stantly working to make the events
and programs better.
"Eventually, we would like to add
another feature where law school
mentors will take their undergradu
ate mentees to courses during Shad
owing Week," Wang said. "This allows
for better access and closer interac
tion with the class. With the help of
the SPLS Mentorship Committee, we
can make the Shadowing Week even
more successful."
