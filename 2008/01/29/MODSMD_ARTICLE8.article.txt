### TERENCE HUNT ASSOCIATION PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush, standing before Congress one
last time, urged the nation Monday
night to stay confident against gnawing
recession fears and be patient with the
grinding war in Iraq.
"We can all sec that growth is slow
ing." Bush said in a blunt acknowledg
ment of rising food and gas prices, in
creasing unemployment and turmoil in
the housing and financial markets.
"We have unfinished business be
fore us. and the American people ex
pect us to get it done," Bush declared. It
was his final State of the Union address
and he faced a hostile. Democratic-led
Congress eager for the end of his term
next January.
With his approval rating near its all
time low. Bush lacked the political
clout to push bold ideas and he didn't
try. He called on lawmakers to urgent
ly approve a $150 billion plan —
worked out with House leaders — to
stave off recession through tax rebates
for families and incentives for busi
nesses to invest in new plants and
equipment.
"The actions of the 110 th Congress
will affect the security and prosperity
of our nation long after this session has
ended," the president said.
Senate Democrats want to expand
the economic rescue plan with rebates
for senior citizens living off Social Se
curity and extensions of unemploy
ment benefits for the jobless. Bush said
those changes "would delay il or derail
it and neither option is acceptable."
He also pushed Congress to extend
his tax cuts, which are to expire in 2010,
and said allowing them to lapse would
mean higher tax bills for 116 million
American taxpayers. For those who say
they're willing to pay more, Bush said,
"I welcome their enthusiasm, and I am
pleased to report that the IKS accepts
both checks and money orders."
Before speaking. Bush turned to
shake hands with a smiling House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice Presi
dent Dick Cheney, seated behind him.
Bush's wife. Laura, and their twin
daughters. Barbara and Jenna, sat in a
VIP box.
Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the
war has been a main topic of Bush's an
nual addresses to Congress. He said
Monday night the buildup of 30,000
U.S. troops and an increase in Iraqi
forces "have achieved results few of us
could have imagined just one year
ago."
"Some may deny the surge is work
ing," Bush said, "but among the terror
ists there is no doubt. Al-Qaida is on
the run in Iraq and this enemy will be
defeated."
Bush made no commitment about
withdrawing additional troops from
Iraq, and he said Gen. David Patraeus.
the top U.S. general there, has warned
that pulling Americans out too quickly
could undermine Iraqi forces, allow al-
Qaida to regroup and trigger an in
crease in violence.
"Members of Congress: Having
come so far and achieved so much, we
must not allow this to happen." the
president said.
Bush said U.S. adversaries in Iraq
have been hit hard, though "they are
not yet defeated and we can still expect
tough fighting ahead."
There are 158.000 U.S. troops in
Iraq, a number that is expected to drop
to 135,000 by July.There are 28,000 in
Afghanistan, the highest number of the
war. which began there in October
2001. Congress, despite repeated at
tempts. has been unable to force troop
withdrawals or deadlines for pullbacks,
and Iraq has receded as an issue in
Washington.
