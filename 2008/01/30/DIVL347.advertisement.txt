HOW XANADU IS STEPPING
IT UP-AND POWERING
DOWN - FOR THE
CONSERVATION CUP...
It's not easy being green when you
live in a Row House, but Xanadu is
on the right track.
• The first step toward using less
energy and water is awareness
of how those resources are used
in the house and where they
come from.
• Some Xanadudes made signs
for light switches reminding peo
ple to turn them off and we also
have different "sustainability tips"
from the Web site http://sustain
ablechoices.stanford.edu spread
throughout the house.
• This quarter, Xanadu plans to
host some discussions among
residents about energy and
water use at Stanford.
• Ask yourself: where does the
power that charges your laptop
come from? How does your hot
shower water get here? Where
does your excrement go when
you flush?
• Thinking a little about these
questions can lead to more sus
tainable behavior around the
house.
