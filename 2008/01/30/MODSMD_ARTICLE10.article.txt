McCain wins Florida GOP primary
MIAMI (AP) — Sen. John McCain won a breakthrough
triumph in the Florida primary' liiesday night, gaining the
upper hand in the battle for the Republican presidential
nomination ahead of next week's contests across 21 states
and lining up a quick endorsement from soon-to-be
dropout Rudy Giuliani.
"It shows one thing. I'm the conservative leader who can
unite the party," McCain said.
"It's a very significant boost, but 1 think we've got a
tough week ahead and a lot of states to come," he said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton was the Democratic win
ner in a primary held in defiance of national rules that drew
no campaigning and awarded no delegates.
The victory was worth 57 national convention delegates
for McCain, a winner-take-all haul that catapulted him

ahead of Romney for the overall delegate lead.
Giuliani ran third, his best showing of the campaign
but not nearly good enough for the one-time front-run
ner who decided to make his last stand in a state that is
home to tens of thousands of transplanted New York
ers.
In remarks to supporters in Orlando, the former New
York mayor referred to his candidacy repeatedly in the past
tense — as though it were over. "We'll stay involved and
together we'll make sure that we'll do everything we can to
hand our nation off to the next generation better than it
was before," he said.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee trailed, but told
supporters he would campaign on. Texas Rep. Ron Paul
was fifth, and last.
The campaign goes national next week, with 21 states
holding primaries and caucuses on Tuesday and 1,023 party
convention delegates at stake.
