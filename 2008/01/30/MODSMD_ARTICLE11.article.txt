## Editorial Board Defining 'the Stanford editorial' 
### 
As Volume 232 of The Daily winds
down, we, the members of the Edito
rial Board, recall the feedback we've
received from Daily readers since Septem
ber. When we wrote about issues in the Stan
ford community, we were criticized for hav
ing too narrow a focus. When we wrote about
world issues, we were asked (sometimes not
so politely) to stop daydreaming and to con
centrate on our university — we are a school
newspaper, after all. But does that mean we
shouldn't look beyond the Farm? Exactly
what issues should be written about in a
Stanford editorial, and what issues should be
left to The New York Times?
Stanford students are an amalgam of
many things. We are first and foremost Stan
ford students during our time here, although
this defining characteristic is not a limiting
one. We are also California residents and
members of the world community — we are
American. Indian. French, Canadian. Niger
ian or Singaporean. Some things that happen
far away make a difference in our lives. As
Stanford students writing for Stanford stu
dents, we on the Editorial Board incorporate
the many facets of our identity when we
write about issues that interest us and issues
we believe will interest you.
We in no way want to disregard the im
portant role we play as a uniquely Stanford
newspaper. After all. we are in a prime posi
tion to influence policies created by the ad
ministration that affect our daily lives. It is
our duty as a student newspaper to muck
rake — there's no other publication on cam
pus that would take on this essential task.
Taking on campus-wide issues is where our

effect is greatest.
Stanford, however, is not the only place
where we can affect change. In a democrat
ic society, everyone's opinions are impor
tant, and it is the aggregation of these opin
ions that forms the status quo. For exam
ple. an editorial on propositions attached
to the California docket is not ill-placed.
On the contrary, it could inform and in
spire thousands of people about voting
next Tuesday.
In our pursuit of issues that extend be
yond the Farm, we strive to apply what ex
pertise we have appropriately Mostly, this is
a matter of self-selection, since topics we are
interested in are often topics we know some
thing about. While our pieces on the state of
the national economy may not be written by
a market analyst who works for a private-eq
uity firm, they are written by economics ma
jors. some of whom have done some market
analyzing of their own. With such excellent
faculty and resources at our disposal, we are
more qualified than we think to write about
matters of real impact to the world.
As the next volume of The Daily begins
on Friday, replete with a new editorial board,
we hope the new members use their unique
perspectives to entice discussion and change
at Stanford and beyond. To those who criti
cize editorials on "small" Stanford issues, we
encourage you to read the pieces that take
on the world.To those who admonish us for
not properly addressing concerns at home,
we encourage you to read the pieces that
take on the bubble. In this happy compro
mise. we hope our entire constituency re
mains satisfied.
