## A 						strategy to win 
### 
Dear Republican presidential nomi
nee, whoever you may he:
First off, I have to say I'm sorry for you.
You managed to triumph, and only barely,
over the weakest Republican field in a half
century. Mike Huckabee has won a state!
Mike Huckabee! (This boggles my mind.)
You probably have fundraising problems.
The base is miserable and won't turn out for
you. The independents have deserted you
en masse. Each of the top two Democratic
candidates has raised tens of millions more
than you have. Chances are. your party will
lose another four seats in the Senate, on top
of the six lost in 2006. There's no chance of
re-taking the House. For all intents and pur
poses, you're screwed.
But here's how you can win. There's still
a small chance that you can eke out a victo
ry. You have to make the most of your op
portunity, however, as soon as possible.
Luckily, it is unlikely that any state in the
South will desert you. besides perhaps Vir
ginia. Because you control the South and
the Democrats will sweep the Northeast,
the Midwest and the West will become the
battlegrounds. Traditionally, Republicans
have done well there, especially during the
Reagan era. But you also have to be realis
tic. Contest states like Michigan, Colorado
and Oregon rather than wasting time in the
insanely expensive California market. (Al
though if you can swing California, then you
will almost surely win. Without California's
54 electoral votes, the Democrats need an

additional four to five states.something that
is essentially impossible.)
Even more important than geographical
strategy is your message. You're going to
have to be careful because sounding like a
Republican hack will not go over well with
independents. You need to craft a message
that is conservative rather than Republican.
Talk about business and management of the
economy. Say the Democrats can't be trust
ed as recession looms. As American in
comes continue to stagnate, discuss how the
Democrats will want to take more of the
collective pot. a pot which is not growing
any larger. Cast the Republicans, and espe
cially yourself, as the only competent man
agers of government and spending. Dis
tance yourself from George W. Bush's
record of managerial incompetence and
massive deficit.
The social conservatism bit seems to
have already hit its high point and is on the
decline, so don't let it take over your cam
paign. Take a lesson from Rick Santorum,
dean of the social conservative homo-


StuG!' Baimel
phohes. who lost by 20 points in his
2006 Senate reelection campaign in
the swing state of Pennsylvania.
Pro-life and anti-gay-marriage is
great for motivating evangelicals,
hut Americans are depressed about
the future of the country and care
less about waging those great cul
tural wars. They want to know how
we'll get out of Iraq, how the econo
my will be fixed and what's going to
happen with the ongoing healthcare
problem.
You will also have to distance
yourself from President Bush, espe
cially on the Iraq issue. Americans
seem to believe that the surge is
working, which it is. but they still
aren't willing to stomach another
five years. All of the Democrats
have plans to leave Iraq, while none
of the Republicans do. Not having
clear objectives in the Middle East
isn't a good way to win votes, espe
cially when support for the war is
still in the 30's. Open-ended com
mitments are not salable at this
point.
Hill Clinton was successful be
cause he seized Republican issues
like welfare, put a happy,optimistic
Democratic spin on them and made
them palatable to voters in the cen
ter. In the 2008 race, the Democrats
have an edge on almost every issue.
The only way you. Republican nom
inee. have a chance at capturing the
presidency is to take some of the is
sues. moderate them and then argue
that the Democrats can't be trusted
to carry them out effectively. This
same tactic was successful in 2000.
when Bush declared that lie would
bring "integrity" to the White
I louse, touting his MBA and mana
gerial experience. That case needs
to be made again, with a new face
and a separation from the Bush Ad
ministration. Appealing to the base,
which worked sort of well for Karl
Rove and George Bush, will not
work this time — voters are de
pressed. hate everyone in the field
and won't turn out for you anyway.
Oh. and get Mike Bloomberg to
be your Vice President That would
be a good move.

licaiis tn have a chance. Or does lie'
