## A
						strategy to win 
### 
Dear Republican presidential nomi
nee, whoever you may he:
First off, I have to say I'm sorry for you.
You managed to triumph, and only barely,
over the weakest Republican field in a half
century. Mike Huckabee has won a state!
Mike Huckabee! (This boggles my mind.)
You probably have fundraising problems.
The base is miserable and won't turn out for
you. The independents have deserted you
en masse. Each of the top two Democratic
candidates has raised tens of millions more
than you have. Chances are. your party will
lose another four seats in the Senate, on top
of the six lost in 2006. There's no chance of
re-taking the House. For all intents and pur
poses, you're screwed.
But here's how you can win. There's still
a small chance that you can eke out a victo
ry. You have to make the most of your op
portunity, however, as soon as possible.
Luckily, it is unlikely that any state in the
South will desert you. besides perhaps Vir
ginia. Because you control the South and
the Democrats will sweep the Northeast,
the Midwest and the West will become the
battlegrounds. Traditionally, Republicans
have done well there, especially during the
Reagan era. But you also have to be realis
tic. Contest states like Michigan, Colorado
and Oregon rather than wasting time in the
insanely expensive California market. (Al
though if you can swing California, then you
will almost surely win. Without California's
54 electoral votes, the Democrats need an

additional four to five states.something that
is essentially impossible.)
Even more important than geographical
strategy is your message. You're going to
have to be careful because sounding like a
Republican hack will not go over well with
independents. You need to craft a message
that is conservative rather than Republican.
Talk about business and management of the
economy. Say the Democrats can't be trust
ed as recession looms. As American in
comes continue to stagnate, discuss how the
Democrats will want to take more of the
collective pot. a pot which is not growing
any larger. Cast the Republicans, and espe
cially yourself, as the only competent man
agers of government and spending. Dis
tance yourself from George W. Bush's
record of managerial incompetence and
massive deficit.
The social conservatism bit seems to
have already hit its high point and is on the
decline, so don't let it take over your cam
paign. Take a lesson from Rick Santorum,
dean of the social conservative homo-
