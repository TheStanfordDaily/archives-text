In defense of the Scrabble Club
To the F.ditor,
I read Courtney Weaver's column
("Fish out of Water: Scrabulous," Jan. 29J
with some shock and surprise. I didn't re
alize that Matt, who runs the Palo Alto
Scrabble meet-up. had concerns about me.
the club or the experience, but I was
shocked to see them printed in your paper
without any opportunity to defend myself
or the club I run.
The Palo Alto Scrabble Club is almost
five years old and has been regularly getting
20 to 30 people every week, so clearly there
are a number of people in Palo Alto who
find the in-person. cheat-free camaraderie
of playing Scrabble face-to-face better than
the impersonal, online experience. I play a
lot of online Scrabble myself, and I realize
that there are tradeoffs between either way
of playing. Courtney is welcome to her
opinion, but it didn't seem fair to print it

without the other side being presented.
I certainly don't consider Matt or his
club a nemesis — there are already six
Scrabble clubs in the Bay Area, and 1 don't
consider any of them to be competition. To
respond to Matt's accusations that I was
"poaching" players, yes, I sent players an
email invitation to attend the club Howev
er, I have never suggested to anyone that
they shouldn't attend Matt's club, nor was I
expecting my invitation to reduce his atten
dance.
To give Courtney a chance to check her
facts first-hand, I would like to give her a
second chance: I would like to invite Court
ney. her friends and the Stanford communi
ty to come to the club and to meet me. Have
her meet me and judge the experience first
hand. If you like playing Scrabble, you just
might change your mind.
