# The
						Lowly Interns
## Michael and Sagar's Incredibly Amazing Intern Survival Guide 
### 
For our last column, we have decided to
present Michael and Sagar's Incredibly
Amazing Intern Survival Guide. Please
use it well, or at least refrain from using it for
evil.
Tip 1: Lunch is expensive.
SI): Here's the trick — you should never
have to pay for your own lunch. As an intern,
even if you're getting money people general
ly will want to help out the poor college stu
dent. Every time we had a lunch meeting in
our office, they'd let the interns clean up the
scraps. Degrading? Possibly. Worth it? Oh
yeah.
IMW: If you don't want to stoop to Sagar's
level, another good trick is to bring your own
lunch, eat it secretly, and then go out with
your coworkers and order something small.
You'll save money, and people may even be
falsely impressed with your seemingly regi
mented diet.
Tip 2: Technology is the great equalizer.
SI): Few people actually know how to use
their Black Berries or computers or projec
tors or copy machines. If you take on the dig
ital mantle, you will find yourself in high de
mand. You will be techno-intern: wanted by
all. beholden to none.
MW: Regardless of how new and cool your
office equipment is.something will go wrong,
usually in an embarrassing way. During my
third week on the job. my office computer
was infected by a virus which continually
loaded pornograbber.com — so much for
those expensive firewalls and anti-virus soft
ware. IT informed me my computer was get
ting ready to attack the rest of the network
and they would have to take it away.
Tip 3. Meetings are almost always boring. Get
used to it.
MW: Meetings arc sometimes necessary, oc
casionally helpful, and most often useless.
During one meeting I attended, the woman
presenting said. "You'll have all this in an e
mail, so you don't have to remember what
I'm going through now." and then proceeded
to speak for an hour.
Tip 4. HlackHerries make it okay to he rude.
MW: Do you remember high school, where

anyone caught text messaging during class
was punished? Office jobs operate on the op
posite principle. Everyone knows meetings
are boring and useless, so corporate culture
has made it perfectly acceptable to rattle
away on your Black Berry while others are
talking. It's not being rude, it's being produc
tive!
Tip 5: Handshakes are important.
SI): You really have to get down the flavor of
your handshake.There's the universal simple
strong shake: avoid looking at the hand,
make eye contact, and make sure it's webby
to webby! There's nothing worse than a limp
fish shake. Then there's the two-handed
shake — use this with an acquaintance you
want to get to know better.There's the shake
with the left hand on the shakee's forearm,
same as the aforementioned, but more in
tense. There's the shake with the left hand on
the bicep. good for co-workers. Finally
there's the shake with the halfway man-hug,
always a good default.
Tip ft: Learn how to make coffee.
MW: Especially if you. like most interns,
don't have a Black Berry, caffeine is essential
to cope with meetings. Not paying attention
because you're reading e-mail is fine because
e-mail seems productive. Not paying atten
tion because you're asleep is not fine, be
cause it is difficult to cover for. especially if
you snore or drool. My co-columnist once fell
asleep in a room with a high ranking military
officer. Not a good idea. Also, most offices
have communal coffeepots, and it is very em
barrassing if someone asks you to start a new
batch and you blow up the break room, or
worse, make terrible coffee.
Tip 7: Acronyms = success.
SI): I once heard a sentence spoken as fol
lows: "DOD's been MIA on this, but we've
gotta make sure to meet with OSD before
COB on Friday." It's like its own language. If
you can't understand acronyms, you'll be lost

for weeks.
Tip S: Don't he afraid to ask questions.
IMW: Asking questions in meetings is one of
the few places you as an intern have an advan
tage over the rest of the office. If someone
starts a sentence with "the new guidance relat
ed to the procurement steps..." and you're so
baffled you can't even remember the rest of
the sentence, chances are you aren't the only
one. It's okay to ask because you are the naive
intern, and you can help everyone else save
face.'lTiis is also a good way to learn acronyms.
Tip 9: Police are everywhere.
SI): Police are everywhere in DC, but they,
like handshakes, come in different types. If
you see a police officer on a motorcycle in a
main street, get out of the way. because a
presidential motorcade is coming through. If
you see the Capitol Police, make sure you be
friend them, because they have really, really,
really big guns. Then there's the Secret Ser
vice— it's fun to imitate them and keep
touching your hand to your ear. A lot of them
actually don't wear sunglasses indoors, how
ever, which is quite disappointing.
Tip 10: Watch your mouth.
MW: It might be appallingly obvious to you
that President Bush is really dumb. Hillary
Clinton is kind of scary, or that Ron Paul is
entertaining but has no chance of winning.
But people often have unpredictable politi
cal allegiances. If you inadvertently say one
of these things in the wrong company — say
your boss actually worked on so and so's
campaign — get ready for awkwardness.
SI): This is probably as universal a rule as you
can get. Don't insult certain elected officials
unless you know the thoughts of the people
around you. Don't call people Mr. or Ms. if they
should actually be going by Secretary or Ad
ministrator. Most importantly, don't publish
columns that could be interpreted as harsh
criticism of your previous office, even if you ac
tually liked it. Haha... ha... (crickets chirping).
