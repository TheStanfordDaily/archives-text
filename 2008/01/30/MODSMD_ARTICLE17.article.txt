## Lottich playing pro ball in Japan 
### BY SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I'd like to think that I'm fairly similar
to Matt Lottich '04. We both came to
Stanford from Chicago, we both
played three sports in high school and
we both bought Slingboxes so we
could follow our beloved (yet increasingly
woeful) Chicago sports teams while away
from home.That's where the similarities in
our paths diverge, though.
The former Cardinal shooting guard —
a key contributor to the 2003-2004 men's
basketball squad which many believe to be
the greatest in Stanford history — now
plays professional basketball for the Osaka
Evessa of the "Basketball Japanese
League." He is in his third season in the land
of the rising sun. having played one season
beforehand with the Harbour Heat in New
Zealand's professional league (where he
averaged over 20 points per game).
And just as Lottich enjoyed great suc
cess with the Cardinal teams of the early
2000s. he's doing the same in Osaka. The
Evessa are two-time defending champions,
and even though they are currently tied for
first place this season. Lottich thinks the
team is actually overachieving.
"We lost a key part of our team [to in
jur)], a power forward who played at Indi
ana [University]," he said.
The injury has forced the team to adjust
and begin playing what Lottich calls "small
ball."
"Our offense is very fast paced, kind of
like the Phoenix Suns," he said. It's an of
fense that Lottich is essentially in charge of
— after playing shooting guard through
out his college career, he has had to adjust
to playing the point.
"One of our Japanese players, a former
national team player, plays the two
[guard]," said Lottich."He can't really play
anywhere else."
Still. Lottich maintains that the transi
tion was easier than he thought it would be.

probably because he played point guard
for both his high school and AAU teams.
In any case, the position switch hasn't
slowed him down. While he doesn't like to
check his stats until the end of the year, he
guesses that he's averaging "around 20
[points] a game, and five [rebounds] and
five [assists]."

"I'm happy here...
I could see myself
playing out my
career here."

With stats like those, there's a good
chance he'll make the All-League team
again, as he did two years ago.
Those stats might also suggest that Lot
tich could move to a bigger, more presti
gious, league — like one in Europe, where
basketball is much more popular than in
Japan. In fact, he says he was contacted by
a team in Spain, where another former
member of the Cardinal, Chris Hernandez,
plays. Lottich, however, turned them down.
"In Europe.guys get cut all the time,and
they don't always pay you what they say
they will." he explained. "I'm happy here,
they pay you we 11... I could see myself
playing out my career here."
