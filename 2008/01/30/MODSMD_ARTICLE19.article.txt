# Island style on the Farm
## Inafuku makes his mark on the mainland 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Meet Jordan Inafuku. A native of
I lawaii. he's traveled the world play
ing competitive volleyball. Just a
freshman, he's now the starting
libero on the men's volleyball team.
Jordan was born and raised in
1 lonolulu. I Je started his athletic ca
reer at the ripe age of five, playing
shortstop on a Little League base
ball team. It was through Little
League that he met and befriended
Kawika Shoji, the current setter for
the Cardinal.
A few years later, Kawika's fa
ther — the head coach for the Uni
versity of Hawaii's women's volley
ball team — started a boy's volley
ball club Kawika asked Jordan and
another top player, Spencer
Mcl .achlin.if they wanted to join the
team. Both did.
Jordan, Kawika and Spencer are
now all on the No. 7 Stanford men's
volleyball team.
At the time the club was found
ed. there were no other boys' volley
ball teams in Hawaii. Jordan, Kawi
ka and Spencer, along with the nine
other boys they eventually recruited
for their team, practiced together al
most everyday. Because there were
no other boys' volleyball teams on
the island, the team played in girls'
tournaments.
Eventually, the team started
coming to the mainland to play in

boys' events. When Jordan was 10.
the team traveled to New Orleans to
participate in the Junior Olympics.
They were the only Hawaiian team
in their division.
"It was a lot of fun." Jordan said
of his first big tournament. "It was
exciting for us because we got to
play against people we had never
seen before. It was a big deal."
The team came away from their
first tournament with a bronze
medal.
"We were happy," Jordan said,
"but disappointed that we only got
bronze. We wanted to win."
Jordan carried his competitive at
titude with him to high school,
where he played volleyball for the
Kamehameha Schools.
"Volleyball is a pretty big sport in
Hawaii," explained Jordan."lt prob
ably gets more crowd support on the
island than anywhere else in the
country."
While on the mainland volleyball
is overshadowed by sports such as
football and basketball, the sport has
quite a following on the islands.
In Hawaii,"[we] take high school
volleyball pretty seriously." Jordan
said. "A lot of people pay attention
to it; a lot of people come out to
watch it. The state championships
are broadcast on TV. Ihe media in
Hawaii places the spotlight on high
school volleyball."

Three members of the men's volleyball
team —Jordan Inafuku (pictured),
Kawika Shoji and Spencer McLach-
H lin — grew up playing together in
Hawaii and are continuing their
jjk. s success at Stanford.
Jordan, Kawika and Spencer all
went to different high schools — the
biggest high schools on the island, and
the biggest rivals in sports.
" 11 was always fun. but at the same
time always hard to beat them," Jor
dan said of the rivalry. "Those match
es were tough."
Of the three, only two got to go to
the State Championships every year,
so one team was always left out.
"We kind of traded off," Jordan
said."My first year,my team eliminat
ed Spencer's team and Kawika's team
beat my team in the finals. My second
year, my team eliminated Kawika's
team and Spencer's team took out my
team in the finals."
In his junior year of high school,

Jordan started to receive letters,
emails and phone calls from college
coaches, and he met with coaches at
the Junior Olympics and at. home. Be
tween his junior and senior year, he
began visiting schools including Penn
State, USC, Pepperdine and Stanford.
At the beginning of his senior year, he
signed a letter of intent to attend
Stanford.
So why Stanford?
"1 mean, if you get into Stanford,
it's kind of hard to say you want to go
somewhere else," he said. "My visit
here pretty much sealed the deal. I
hung oui with the team, which 1 think
was the biggest factor in my decision.
They're a really good bunch of guys
and 1 felt really comfortable around
them. As far as volleyball goes, they
were genuinely committed to being
better. I knew that if I was going to
have to spend four years with a bunch
of people, they were the kind of peo
ple 1 wanted to be around."

This season — his first as a mem
ber of the team — Jordan earned a
starting position at libero.To date, he
shares the starting spot with sopho
more Jarod Keller.
"Definitely our position is very
variable — it changes week to week,"
Jordan said. "I started in the fall and
at the beginning of the season, but
Jarod started this weekend. It's hard
because we both have earned a lot of
playing time. Fortunately, our compe
tition has definitely made both of us
better, which makes the team better."
Despite his inexperience, the re
sults have shown: Jordan currently
leads the team in digs, accumulating
an impressive 53 on the year so far.
He may be the best defensive play
er on the team. Teaming up with his
fellow teammates from Hawaii, he's
only just begun.

better. I knew that if I was going to
have to spend four years with a bunch
of people, they were the kind of peo
ple 1 wanted to be around."

This season — his first as a mem
ber of the team — Jordan earned a
starting position at libero.To date, he
shares the starting spot with sopho
more Jarod Keller.
"Definitely our position is very
variable — it changes week to week,"
Jordan said. "I started in the fall and
at the beginning of the season, but
Jarod started this weekend. It's hard
because we both have earned a lot of
playing time. Fortunately, our compe
tition has definitely made both of us
better, which makes the team better."
Despite his inexperience, the re
sults have shown: Jordan currently
leads the team in digs, accumulating
an impressive 53 on the year so far.
He may be the best defensive play
er on the team. Teaming up with his
fellow teammates from Hawaii, he's
only just begun.
