### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Meet Jordan Inafuku. A native of
I lawaii. he's traveled the world play
ing competitive volleyball. Just a
freshman, he's now the starting
libero on the men's volleyball team.
Jordan was born and raised in
1 lonolulu. I Je started his athletic ca
reer at the ripe age of five, playing
shortstop on a Little League base
ball team. It was through Little
League that he met and befriended
Kawika Shoji, the current setter for
the Cardinal.
A few years later, Kawika's fa
ther — the head coach for the Uni
versity of Hawaii's women's volley
ball team — started a boy's volley
ball club Kawika asked Jordan and
another top player, Spencer
Mcl .achlin.if they wanted to join the
team. Both did.
Jordan, Kawika and Spencer are
now all on the No. 7 Stanford men's
volleyball team.
At the time the club was found
ed. there were no other boys' volley
ball teams in Hawaii. Jordan, Kawi
ka and Spencer, along with the nine
other boys they eventually recruited
for their team, practiced together al
most everyday. Because there were
no other boys' volleyball teams on
the island, the team played in girls'
tournaments.
Eventually, the team started
coming to the mainland to play in

boys' events. When Jordan was 10.
the team traveled to New Orleans to
participate in the Junior Olympics.
They were the only Hawaiian team
in their division.
"It was a lot of fun." Jordan said
of his first big tournament. "It was
exciting for us because we got to
play against people we had never
seen before. It was a big deal."
The team came away from their
first tournament with a bronze
medal.
"We were happy," Jordan said,
"but disappointed that we only got
bronze. We wanted to win."
Jordan carried his competitive at
titude with him to high school,
where he played volleyball for the
Kamehameha Schools.
"Volleyball is a pretty big sport in
Hawaii," explained Jordan."lt prob
ably gets more crowd support on the
island than anywhere else in the
country."
While on the mainland volleyball
is overshadowed by sports such as
football and basketball, the sport has
quite a following on the islands.
In Hawaii,"[we] take high school
volleyball pretty seriously." Jordan
said. "A lot of people pay attention
to it; a lot of people come out to
watch it. The state championships
are broadcast on TV. Ihe media in
Hawaii places the spotlight on high
school volleyball."
