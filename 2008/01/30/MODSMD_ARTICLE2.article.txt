## Panel talks start-up finance Google business seminar attracts 200 Stanford alums 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT 
Rain and traffic didn't stop more than 200
Stanford alumni from crowding into a lecture
room at Google's Mountain View campus last
night.Those in the audience listened intently as
six panelists from the venture capital arena
shared advice on how to make a new company
the next big thing.
ITie panel covered a broad range of topics,
such as how to develop a feasible business plan,
how to approach different types of investors
and how to avoid common problems with start
up finances.The event, entitled "Navigating the
Maze of Start-up Finance," was part of Stanford
Engineering's Career Seminar Series.
"The Career Seminars are part of a broader
effort by Stanford Engineering to reach out to
our alumni," said Michelle Compton, associate
director of alumni relations for the School of
Engineering. "Business schools have career
services that reach out to alumni at all stages of
their professional lives, and we want to repli
cate that."
The seminars focus on both professional de
velopment and career search skills,and they are
designed partly in response to alumni surveys.
So far all of the seminars have drawn at least
150 people, and Compton was not surprised by
the large turnout at yesterday's event.
"There has been a lot of interest in a seminar
about start-ups." Compton explained. "Stan
ford takes pride in the entrepreneurial spirit of
its students and alumni."
That entrepreneurial spirit was certainly
present during the networking session after the
panel. Kelly Schmutte '06 spoke to Chris Tu
ritzin '06 about her efforts to design a better
pointe shoe for ballet dancers.
"I've spent a lot of time researching with
customers at a dance apparel store," Schmutte
said.
In turn.Turitzin shared his project,a Web ap
plication that will use social networking to con
nect local artists with one another.

"I want to develop grassroots communities
for artists," he said, "'liie project also seeks to
empower artists by helping them sell their work
across different types of media."
Recent grads were not the only alums inter
ested in what the panelists had to say. Steve
Mylroie Ph.D. "75 recently retired and is think
ing about starting his own company.
"I need something to do with all of my free
time," Mylroie joked.
Schmutte andTUritzin agreed that while the

seminar was helpful in understanding the per
spectives of the venture capital community, the
panel's focus on funding seemed to detract at
tention from other important parts of a success
ful start-up.
"At the end of the day. no matter how much
money you have,you still need a great idea,"'Tu
ritzin said.

event, seemed to think that aril of the
attendees might have great ideas —
they passed out fliers advertising job
openings at the beginning of the sem
inar. Compton explained that
Google's interests in recruiting Stan
ford alums dovetails with the School
of Engineering's interest in providing
enhanced alumni services.
"Google has offices in cities such
as New York and Seattle, where
many engineering alums are concen
trated." Compton said. "By partner
ing with them we're able to have sem
inars far away from the Stanford
campus."
Do seminar attendees resent
these not-so-subtle recruitment ef
forts?
"Just the opposite," Compton
laughed. "Alums are always telling
me that they want more chances to
talk to Google recruiters at the semi
nars."
