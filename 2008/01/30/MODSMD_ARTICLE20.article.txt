# Santana a big deal for NL

As followers of this column —
if any such readers exist —
will know by now, I really
have some deep-seated sports with
drawal issues at this time of the
We are now entering the February
doldrums, that dreaded time after
this weekend's Super Bowl when the
NBA. NHL and college basketball
are all mired in the midst of regular
season marathons, pro and college
football are on hiatus and there's still
quite some time before pitchers and
catchers even report to spring train
ing.
So imagine my delight when
today, on the threshold of the Febru
ary sports wasteland, a legitimately
significant baseball deal went down.
Even more impressive, it involved
probably the best starting pitcher in
the game today and had nothing to
do with the Yankees or Red Sox.
No, Johan Santana, the most
prized starter in baseball, is headed
to New York after all, but to the Na
tional League instead.The Mets have
reportedly acquired the dominant
southpaw for a package of four
youngsters, of whom only outfielder
Carlos Gomez has seen any signifi
cant time in the major leagues —
amassing a .232 average with 12
stolen bases in 125 at bats.
Make no mistake, the deal is a
huge victory for the Mets.To be sure,
it dries up much of what was left in
their already depleted farm system,
but giving up four "maybes" for one
bona fide superstar is a no-brainer.
especially when none of the maybes
are widely considered to be truly
great prospects. And when you've al
ready found the best shortstop-third
base combo in baseball — shortstop
Jose Reyes and third baseman David
Wright — you can probably afford
to sell the farm for a true ace.
Now. the deal hinges, according to
ESPN, on the Mets and Santana
coming to an agreement on a con
tract extension. But come on — it's
New York. They've got the cash and
they wouldn't have bothered to build
a deal like this unless they were will
ing to spend it. Realistically, all signs
point to Santana in blue and orange
next season, at the front end of a Met
rotation that has been the team's
greatest weakness in the past.
So,what does it all mean? Well, if
you feared the AL would dominate
the World Series for the next decade
or so. you should be somewhat com
forted by this move. Before, the only
thing in favor of a National League
team winning a series against one of
the big dogs of the AL —the Red
Sox and Yankees spring immediately
to mind, but Detroit and Cleveland
can't be too far behind — was a
short, best of seven match-up in
which anyone could get hot enough
to win four games. Essentially, a
small October sample size might
make, say, Yorvit Torrealba of the
Rockies look like a god at the plate
while a Manny Ramirez, Deck Jeter
or Grady Sizemore could, conceiv
ably, slump over the same span.
But you would never actually
think that the Nl. could boast the
kind of team that might actually be
better than the American League
juggernauts. Sure, there were some
teams, like the Rockies and Mets,
fielding lineups that could keep up
offensively with the Yanks or Sox.
And there were other NL squads
that had plenty of pitching. like San
Diego. Until now, though, no Nation
al League team was the complete
package.
But the Mets. laughable just five
years ago, have risen to that pedestal
and should now be counted as the
heavy favorites in the National
League. Not that folks in Boston or
the Bronx should be particularly
worried, but at least the old AL-NL
debate just took another step to
wards being debatable once again.
And one last positive — at least
this column had absolutely nothing
to do with Tom Brady.
