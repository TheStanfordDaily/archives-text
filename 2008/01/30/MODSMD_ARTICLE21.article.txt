## Brady appears healthy in practice 
### BARRY WILNER APFOOTBALL WRITER 
Looks like Tom Brady will he true to his word. One
day after promising his ankle injury wouldn't keep him
from preparing for and playing in the Super Bowl,
Brady was back where he belongs Monday. He prac
ticed with the New England Patriots for the first time
since he was hurt against San Diego in the AFC cham
pionship game more than a week ago.
If the undefeated Patriots needed a lift as they pre
pared to play the New York Giants, they got one from
Brady's return.The league MVP missed three workouts
last week, but he was on the field, as usual, at Arizona
State's practice facility in nearby Tempe.
"Anytime the MVP of the league is back, it has to be
a positive." receiver Wes Welker said. "He looks good
— the same dimples and all."
According to the Chicago Tribune's Dan Pompei,
the designated pool reporter, the star quarterback ap
peared to have a slight limp. But he participated in all
phases of practice, including jogging the length of the
field twice at the end of drills.
Although Brady was not made available to the
media-he will speak on Tuesday — his teammates had
plenty to say about the record-setting quarterback's re
turn.
"He's the leader of our team," said safety Rodney Har
rison, one of the Patriots' defensive leaders. "He's spe
cial, and to have your No. 1 guy out there working hard
and just being out there with his spirit, of course it
brought a smile to our faces.Tom will be there Sunday,
don't worry about that."
That's what Brady said shortly after arriving.

"I'm not concerned about how it's going to affect my
play" he said Sunday night."This won't keep me out."
Brady's health became an issue a week ago when he
was spotted wearing a protective boot on his right foot
while visiting supermodel girlfriend Gisele Bundchen
in New York. He sat out all three practices in Foxbor
ough, Mass., when much of the game plan was being in
stalled.
Since becoming the starter in 2001, Brady has been
remarkably durable. He's started every game in the last
six seasons, and he was the M V P of the 2002 Super Bowl
despite an ankle injury in the AFC title game.
"1 never concern myself with anybody that we're
playing with, whether it's Tom or anybody else," All-Pro
tackle Matt Light said. "Their situation is their situation.
Nobody knows what's going on other than him, and he's
the only one who can answer those questions as to how
he feels.
"I'll tell you one thing, if he's out there he's going to
be giving you everything that he's got. 1 don't worry
about that at all."
Asked how Brady fared in practice, Light's response
drew chuckles: "1 try not to look at him too much.
"You guys do enough of that," he added, drawing
more laughs. "I'm concerned with what's right in front
of me and I really haven't paid much attention to it."
Ah, but the rest of the world certainly has. Brady's
foot overshadowed the Patriots moving in on the first
perfect NFL season since the 1972 Miami Dolphins. Yes,
the three-time champion quarterback's persona has
transcended even the Super Bowl.
No matter how vigorously coach Bill Belichick and
the rest of the Patriots want to ignore it.the questions
about their biggest star's health will persist.
