## VPUE programs soon to be housed under same roof 
### E. BLAIR LAING 
By autumn 2008, the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education (VPUE) is planning to
house all of its programs — including the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric — in Sweet Hall.
The move will force VPUE programs currently
housed in Sweet Hall to relocate within the
building and will create space for those not cur
rently in Sweet Hall, like PWR, to move into the
building.
According to PWR Director Andrea
Lunsford. there is much to be gained by creating
one VPUE-run unit. She added that the move
will allow the PWR program to work closely
with other programs run by the VPUE, includ
ing the Undergraduate Advising Program
(UAP), Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) and other freshman and sophomore
programs.
"The VPUE has a desire to create a strong
image for undergrads," Lunsford said.
Among others, the VPUE is in charge of pro
grams such as the Undergraduate Research
Program (URP), UAP. the Freshman Dean's
Office. Freshman and Sophomore Programs
and the Oral Communications Tutors. These
programs are all currently located in Sweet Hall,
along with a majority of the I HUM department
and a few stray PWR instructors.
The PWR department currently has eight in

structors located in the basement of Sweet Hall
hut the remaining instructors (about 26), 12
graduate students and seven administrators will
be leaving their Margaret Jacks Hall offices this
summer after renovations in Sweet Hall are
complete.
PWR instructor Melissa Leavitt feels that
there are some logistical concerns with the
move.
"We just don't know what the space is going
to look like," Leavitt said. "We need to make
sure the space still allows us to have one-on-one
[time] with students."
Leavitt said she is on the whole very excited
about the project overall, emphasizing that "one
of the best parts of the PWR program is the
community" which will be aided by proximity to
other VPUE programs. Other PWR personnel,
however, are also concerned about the space.
Donna Huntet, a PWR instructor who al
ready works in the basement of Sweet Hall in
what she jokingly called "the satellite," feels that
the new arrangement will be "more communal,"
but she is worried about crowding, configura
tion and noise.
"I'm hoping for a nice conference space." she
said, noting that a good space will facilitate
meetings with students.
Despite her worries about space, Hunter
does think that the move will have a positive ef
fect on students.

"Sweet [Hall] will
be a one stop shop."
DONNA HUNTER,
PWR Instructor

"Sweet will be a one-stop-shop" for under
classmen and a kind of "meet and greet" for the
incoming freshman, she said.
The PWR instructors' concerns about con
ference space are not without reason. The sec
ond floor of Sweet 1 fall, the potential new home
of either PWR or I HUM, is currently filled with
cubicles and will likely be a tight squeeze. As a
member of the PWR Space Committee, Leavitt
has expressed her issues to the architects work
ing on the renovation of Sweet 1 hill, and her sen
timent is being echoed by the PWR administra
tion.
"Conferences are the cornerstone of the
whole program," Lunsford said, when asked
about how the space will be renovated. She is
hoping to design a student-friendly area with an
open reception and plenty of room for confer

encing.
Members of the IHUM department also ex
press concerns about the move.
According to Ellen Woods, the associate vice
provost of VPUE, "all IHUM postdoctoral fel
lows and staff are set to move."This could affect
more than 50 members of the IHUM program,
including administrators with offices currently
in the Main Quad. Woods clarified that the
move would not affect the professors who teach
IHUM classes, who have offices within their re
spective departments.
"My main concern is timing," Woods said,"l
would like for the move to take place when
classes are not in session, if possible, so as not to
disrupt teaching or office hours."
There has also been talk of opening a second
writing center in the distant future. Many PWR
instructors are currently housed in Margaret
Jacks Hall with the Hume Writing Center in the
basement, making it easy for the PWR teachers
who staff the writing center to bounce between
the two. With PWR relocated in Sweet Hall,
there will be more back and forth.
Marvin Diogenes, associate director of
PWR, expressed his excitement about a poten
tial new writing center in Sweet Hall, which he
hoped would be a "writing and speaking center
— collaboration among VPUE."
