## Postdocs receive workshop grant 
### ANDREA SY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford University Postdoctoral Asso
ciation (SUPD) was recently awarded a seed
grant worth $1,000 by the National Postdoctoral
Association (NPA).The grant money.along with
additional support contributed by the Office of
Postdoctoral Affairs, will be used for three work
shops designed to develop soft skills to become
a successful mentor, manager and teacher.
SUPD works with postdoctoral fellows in
order to ease the transition into working in the
education industry' and becoming professors.
This year's co-Chairs. Sarah Kummerfield and
Alison McGuigan, are planning the workshops
along with Carlos Pineda, Sruthi King and
Susan Moore.
The three workshops,entitled"Developinga
Career Progress Plan:" "Interviews and Inter
viewing — How to Get What You Want;" and
"Managing. Motivating and Mentoring Your
Workforce," are aimed at issues specific to post
doctoral students.They are designed to comple
ment the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
(HHMl)and Burroughs Welcome Fund(BWF)
book."Making the Right Moves — A Practical
Guide to Scientific Management for Postdocs
and New Faculty."

All three workshops aim to train postdocs in
different skills. "Developing a Career Progress
Plan" focuses on the formation of strategies and
different methods in order to succeed in a cho
sen career. "Interviews and Interviewing —
How to Get What You Want" will teach people
how to give interviews and how to select the
best applicants for the job. "Managing. Motivat
ing and Mentoring Your Workforce" is targeted
at mentoring on campus.
McGuigan has clear goals and objectives for
the workshops. Hopefully, she said, these work
shops will "get [postdocs] to start thinking
about other skills they might need outside the
lab in order to be successful. In the long-term,
the next generation of people entering faculty
jobs will have more training and they will fur
ther emphasize the importance of these soft
skills to their students."
When asked about plans for the future,
McGuigan replied that the SUPD team hopes
to come up with a mentoring award. Postdocs
will then be able to vote for professors who have
been exemplary mentors.
For students interested in the HHMI and
BWF book mentioned above, it is available in
Adobe PDF format on the SUPD Web site.
