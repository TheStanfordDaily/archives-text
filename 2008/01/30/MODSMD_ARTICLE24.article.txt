## Giuliani set to endorse McCain 
### DEVLIN BARRETT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ORLANDO, Fla. - In the end, 9/11 wasn't
enough. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giu
liani, once the Republican presidential front
runner thanks to his status as "America's
Mayor" suffered a debilitating defeat in
Tuesday's Florida primary. He prepared
Wednesday to quit the race endorse his
friendliest rival. John McCain.
Giuliani stopped short of announcing he
was stepping down, but delivered a valedicto
ry speech that was more farewell than fight
on.
The former mayor finished a distant third
to the winner. McCain, and close second
place finisher Mitt Romney. Republican offi
cials said Giuliani would endorse McCain on
Wednesday in California.The officials spoke
on condition of anonymity in advance of the
public announcement.
"I'm proud that we chose to stay positive
and to run a campaign of ideas in an era of
personal attacks, negative ads and cynical
spin," Giuliani said as supporters with tight
smiles crowded behind him. "You don't al
ways win. but you can always try to do it right,
and you did."
Asked directly whether he was dropping
out of the race. Giuliani said only: "I'm going
to California."
Republican presidential candidates were
scheduled to debate at the Reagan presiden
tial library in Simi Valley on Wednesday
night.
Tuesday's result was a remarkable col
lapse for Giuliani. Last year, he occupied the
top of national polls anil seemed destined to
turn conventional wisdom on end by running
as a moderate Republican who supported
abortion rights, gay rights and gun control.
The results seriously decimated Giuliani's
unconventional strategy, which relied heavily
on Florida to launch him into the coast-to
coast Feb. 5 nominating contests.
But Florida proved to be less than hos
pitable. His poll numbers dropped and key
endorsements went to McCain.
Surveys of voters leaving polling places
TUesday showed that Giuliani was getting
backing from some Hispanics, abortion
rights supporters and people worried about
terrorism, but was not dominating in any
area.
McCain, addressing his own supporters
moments later in Miami, gave Giuliani a
warm rhetorical embrace, a possible pro
logue to accepting Giuliani's expected sup

port.
"I want to thank my dear friend, my dear
friend Rudy Giuliani, who invested his heart
and soul in this primary and who conducted
himself with all the qualities of the exception
al American leader he truly is," McCain said.
"Thank you, Rudy, for all you have added to
this race and for being an inspiration to me
and millions of Americans."
Giuliani hung his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination on his leadership.
His stalwart performance as New York
mayor in the tense days after the Sept. 11.
2001, terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington earned him national magazine
covers, international accolades and wide
spread praise.
Steadfast in a crisis, as a candidate Giu
liani was a bundle of contradictions, so much
so that he liked to joke that even he didn't al
ways agree with himself.
A moderate-to-liberal New Yorker who
backed abortion rights, gay rights and gun
control in a party dominated by Southern
conservatives,Giuliani became a Republican
mayor of an overwhelmingly Democratic
city. Campaigning for national office, he
claimed to have created the most conserva
tive government in the most liberal city in
America.
After earning a reputation as a tough
talking, even abusive executive, Giuliani the
presidential candidate was mostly mild-man
nered in debates, even as those around him
got meaner.
Giuliani, 63. first gained prominence as a
crime-busting federal prosecutor in New
York City. Jailing mob bosses. Wall Street ex
ecutives and corrupt politicians helped pro
pel his next career as a politician, but it was
n't an immediate success. He lost the first
time he ran for mayor in 1989 before winning
in 1993.
As mayor, he fostered a take-charge
image by rushing to fires and crime scenes to
brief the press, but some critics felt he was
more concerned about taking credit from
others for what became a historic decline in
the city's crime rate during his tenure.
A bout with prostate cancer and the very
public breakup of his marriage with second
wife Donna Hanover - she first learned he
was filing for divorce when he made the an
nouncement at a televised news conference -
forced Giuliani to withdraw from a race for
the U.S. Senate against Democrat Hillary
Rodham Ginton in 2000. The messy divorce
was revisited in awkward detail once he re
entered politics.
