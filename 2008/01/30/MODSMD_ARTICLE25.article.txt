Founder of Statistics
Department dies at 88
Albert Hosmer Bowker, former Dean
of Graduate Studies, died on Jan. 20 at the
age of 88. The founder of the Department
of Statistics. Bowker died from pancreatic
cancer in a retirement home in Portola Val
ley.
Bowker. who earned a Bachelor's de
gree in mathematics from MIT and a Ph.D.
in statistics from Columbia, came to Stan
ford in 1947 as an assistant professor of
mathematical statistics.
The statistician, who founded the Sta
tistics Department in 1959, served as Dean
of Graduate Studies from 1959 to 1963.
Upon leaving the University in 1963,

Bowker first served as chancellor of the

1971 to 1980.
In a 1998 Stanford News Service re
lease. Bowker said, "I am prouder of the

Mathematician dies at 83
Influential Stanford math professor
Sam Karlin died on Dec. 18 at the Stanford
Hospital following a massive heart attack.
He was 83. Karlin spent his last 20 years ap
plying mathematics and statistical models
to problems in biological sequence analy
sis.
His most significant contribution was a
series of papers in the early 1990s with
Stephen Altschul that laid the statistical
groundwork for BLAST, the most popular

piece of software in computational biology.
Karlin was well-known for brilliance in
mathematics, a passion for argument, a
love for competition and a surprising skill
for nurturing grad students.

EE Professor
Runner and mountain climber Alan
Waterman died in Palo Alto on Jan. 9.1 le
was 89. Waterman's controversial work on
radio waves incensed peacenik students
during Vietnam-era turmoil over military
research on the Stanford campus.
He specialized in how radio waves
propagate through the atmosphere and are
affected by turbulence and layers. During
his time at Stanford, he erected antennas in
the Dish area for experiments with mi
crowave communications.
