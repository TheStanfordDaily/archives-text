"There is a push to bring the CoHo back.

and the administration realizes it," Aviila

but no one knows what fashion to do it in."
Preliminary talks have introduced three
potential organizations to reopen and man
age a CoHo replacement — Stanford Din
ing. the owners of The Treehouse and Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE).
"The discussion is really up in the air at
this point." Avula said. "There is a necessity
for a relaxing place like the CoHo for stu

for studying." he said. "It really frustrates
me that it [currently] is."
The Old Union Programming Board is

taking steps to change Old Union from a
study space to a place where students can
relax.
To renovate the space, the Board will
begin by introducing small entertainment
items like board games and a foosball table.
Eventually, about six televisions will be in
stalled. along with at least three Xbox 360
gaming consoles and several DVD players.
Student staff members will also be hired to
manage an information desk.
"At this point, we are working for every
thing to be in as soon as possible," Avula
said.
Ihe remodeling of Old Union is the
ASSU Executives' "big goal" for the quarter.
