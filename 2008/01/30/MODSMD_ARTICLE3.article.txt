SPOM. It sounds like SPAM, but it's
healthier for you.
Stanford Peace of Mind (SPOM), a
student group that was started two years
ago, is looking to have its most productive
year yet. According to SPOM co-Presi
dent Mirra Schwartz '09, part of SPOM's
mission is to normalize the discussion of
mental health on campus. The second
facet is an outreach program for impris

said that often, students would like to
know how they should go about talking
to their peers.
Schwartz continued to mention the
"Stanford duck syndrome," the oft-cited
metaphor that describes appearing
serene on the surface but paddling furi
ously underneath to stay afloat.
While school administrators have
tried to efface the fears of incoming stu
dents and encourage them to seek help,
SPOM is currently the only student
group reaching out to the community to
cover a wide range of mental health is
sues.
In addition to reaching out to those in
the Stanford community, SPOM's other
goal is to conduct writing workshops with
prisoners in the Bay Area.
Schwartz got the workshop idea from
Jill McDonough, a Stegner Fellow who
has done similar workshops in the past.
"Research has shown how beneficial
narrative writing can be," Schwartz said.
To spread campus-wide awareness,
the group will host panel discussions, the
