# Space crunch irks faculty
## Registrars Office struggles to schedule convenient sections 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
Ihe Registrar's Office has drawn mixed
reactions from academic departments
across campus for a new policy that limits
the times sections can meet each day.
Due to shrinking classroom space, the
Registrar's Office instituted a new policy
this year that attempts to minimize over
crowding of courses during the peak hours
of 11 a.m. through 2 p.m. The new policy
limits most classes and sections that meet
once per week to either S a.m. or after 2:15
p.m.. which results in difficulty scheduling
colloquium courses and discussion sec
tions.
Early morning classes are notoriously
unpopular among students and teaching
assistants (TAs) alike, while afternoon
classes often conflict with the typical prac
tice schedules of student athletes.
"There are the same number of rooms
available, no matter the time of day," Asso
ciate Registrar Jackie Charonis said, clari
fying the need for the new system. "We
have an excessively large number of small
courses, and often we simply don't have
enough rooms at peak hours."
However, some TAs say they are put in
a bind as a result of the new regulations, as
it is increasingly difficult to schedule con
venient discussion section times.
"Given the high percentage of students
here at Stanford who play sports or engage
in other extracurricular activities, this poli
cy seems illogical," Brad Bouley, a TA and
second-year History Ph.D. student, said in
an email to The Daily. "It works to keep stu
dents from our classes rather than enabling
them to come."
Iliough the new policy was introduced
near the end of the 2(MKv()7 academic year,
its effects were not realized until this year,
and some departments have reacted more
strongly than others.
Problems have been concentrated in
the large humanities and social sciences de

partments, including Psychology. History
and Political Science. Due to small class
sizes and a large number of discussion sec
tions, such departments have resorted to
assigning conference spaces and meeting
rooms as emergency classroom spaces.
Due to greater control over their build
ings and designated lab spaces, however.

"We simply don't
have enough
rooms at peak
hours."

the natural sciences and Computer Science
departments have not witnessed the same
problems.
"I think the Registrar needs to pay
more attention to the actual lives of stu
dents and faculty members," said History
Prof. Richard White. "This has made things
incredibly inconvenient."
Yet the Registrar's changes are not a
black-and-white affair.
"The fall-off in demand outside of [11
a.m. to 2 p.m] is difficult to address," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman *7 l ). "I'm certainly
aware that there's an acute space short
age."
Bravman added that an aversion to
early morning and late afternoon classes is
something that administrators have faced
for yeais.
"A lot of this is a culture change
that just gets worse over time," he
said. "This isn't a new situation."
He also pointed to efforts that
have been made to alleviate the space
crunch on campus, including shorten
ing IHIJM sections from 90 to 60 min
utes.
" lliat's a bigger impact than any
one department can make," Bravman
said, "and 1 feel that should be felt
more as it is a very substantial reduc
tion."
While such changes help to allevi
ate the problem, the needs of every
department cannot be fully ad
dressed.
" Ihe times aren't workable," said
Lindsay Quandara,a Political Science
Student Services Specialist. "They've
put themselves in a hard place for
classroom usage. When it comes to
section scheduling, 1 have TAs bang
ing down my door."
Not all departments, however,
have been inconvenienced by the
changes; the French and Italian De
partment reported business as usual.
"Our relations with the Registrar
have gone very smoothly," said
French and Italian Administrative
Assistant Christine Onorato. "I've
found the Registrar to be very accom
modating of room changes, and
they've addressed the specific needs
of many faculty members. I've found
most of the process to be transpar
ent."
TTie Registrar controls only 170
classrooms, and departments have in
creasingly had to rely upon rooms
they control in order to fulfill the

needs of their sections.
"We're thinking of asking every
department to cough up a conference
room," said Sharon Velten, Student
Services Officer in the Registrar's Of
fice. "My impression is that a lot of
that space goes unused, and we feel
we have a right to ask for the propri
etary space."
Onorato noted, however, that such
space is necessary for other uses.
"We have access to four DLCL
[Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages) rooms but there's a
caveat to assigning classes to those
rooms," Onorato said. "They're also
the designated places for interviews,
meetings and graduate student activi
ties and research,"
As complaints continue to arise,
the Registrar's Office is working to
address concerns about the new poli
cy.
"We are revisiting meeting pat
terns going into the next year," Velten
said. "We've been meeting with se
lected department administrators,
and we're especially looking towards
expanding available time slots on Fri
days."
While the Registrar's Office works
to improve the system, some faculty
members are begrudgingly accepting
the new policy.
"Once the changes were set. I had
to conform my whole schedule
around the new terrain," White said.
"It's not something I'm going to want
to go through changing again."
Others, however, note that there is
room for improvement.
"The key is to have flexibility," said
History Prof. Barton Bernstein. "The
Registrar needs to be more supple in
its conception of ideas and more sup
ple in their implementation."
