# Space crunch irks faculty
## Registrars Office struggles to schedule convenient sections 
### ERIC MESSINGER STAFF WRITER 
Ihe Registrar's Office has drawn mixed
reactions from academic departments
across campus for a new policy that limits
the times sections can meet each day.
Due to shrinking classroom space, the
Registrar's Office instituted a new policy
this year that attempts to minimize over
crowding of courses during the peak hours
of 11 a.m. through 2 p.m. The new policy
limits most classes and sections that meet
once per week to either S a.m. or after 2:15
p.m.. which results in difficulty scheduling
colloquium courses and discussion sec
tions.
Early morning classes are notoriously
unpopular among students and teaching
assistants (TAs) alike, while afternoon
classes often conflict with the typical prac
tice schedules of student athletes.
"There are the same number of rooms
available, no matter the time of day," Asso
ciate Registrar Jackie Charonis said, clari
fying the need for the new system. "We
have an excessively large number of small
courses, and often we simply don't have
enough rooms at peak hours."
However, some TAs say they are put in
a bind as a result of the new regulations, as
it is increasingly difficult to schedule con
venient discussion section times.
"Given the high percentage of students
here at Stanford who play sports or engage
in other extracurricular activities, this poli
cy seems illogical," Brad Bouley, a TA and
second-year History Ph.D. student, said in
an email to The Daily. "It works to keep stu
dents from our classes rather than enabling
them to come."
Iliough the new policy was introduced
near the end of the 2(MKv()7 academic year,
its effects were not realized until this year,
and some departments have reacted more
strongly than others.
Problems have been concentrated in
the large humanities and social sciences de

partments, including Psychology. History
and Political Science. Due to small class
sizes and a large number of discussion sec
tions, such departments have resorted to
assigning conference spaces and meeting
rooms as emergency classroom spaces.
Due to greater control over their build
ings and designated lab spaces, however.

"We simply don't
have enough
rooms at peak
hours."

the natural sciences and Computer Science
departments have not witnessed the same
problems.
"I think the Registrar needs to pay
more attention to the actual lives of stu
dents and faculty members," said History
Prof. Richard White. "This has made things
incredibly inconvenient."
Yet the Registrar's changes are not a
black-and-white affair.
"The fall-off in demand outside of [11
a.m. to 2 p.m] is difficult to address," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman *7 l ). "I'm certainly
aware that there's an acute space short
age."
Bravman added that an aversion to
early morning and late afternoon classes is
something that administrators have faced
