January 30,1969:
Conservatives Disrupt SDS
Old Union Rally
A rally sponsored by Students for
a Democratic Society turned into a
shouting match between SDS mem
bers and a vocal group led by mem
bers of the moderate Young Republi
cans (YR) and conservative Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) yes
terday afternoon.
The right-wing militants contin
ued to hound the SDS students for
the rest of the afternoon, blocking
doorways at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory as SDS members tried
to get in and interrupting SDS strat
egy meetings outside of Stanford
Research Institute offices in Palo
Alto.
In a dramatic show of conserva
tive strength. 30 YRs and YAFs ar
rived at the Old Union courtyard
shortly before 12:30 with signs read

ing "SDS is revolting." "SDS Oink."
and "Reject SDS demands." Harvey
Hukari, president of YAF led a
cheer of "Figs Off Campus."
William Boyd, president of the
YR's, stated that his group was upset
that "nothing is being done by the
administration. Pitzer hasn't done a
thing, and that is why we are here."
The group shouted and jeered as
several SDS members presented
"guerilla theater" satirizing Presi
dent Pitzer to the crowd of over 500
students.
Prof. William Rambo, director of
the Applied Electronics Lab, then
spoke about the SDS demand that
faculty members end all contracts
with the Defense Department. He
defended acceptance of research
contracts on two grounds: "The first
is academic propriety. The universi
ty asked for assurances that this
work was acceptable to the commu
nity." He said that the work had to
be of instructive value so that grad
uate students could participate also.

Rambo went on to declare, "Sec
ondly. there is the question of moral
ity and values and principals. You
students ought not to delude your
selves that you are the first to have
thought about it."
Hukari spoke next and criticized
SDS for "claiming to speak for the
majority of the students when in fact
they have been repudiated twice in
campus elections in the past two
years."
SDS member Fred Cohen coun
tered,"Of course SDS doesn't speak
for the majority of the Stanford stu
dents. Why should the majority of
Stanford students decide for the
Vietnames people? The Vietnamese
people have a right to make their
own decisions."
Leonard Siegel of SDS then an
nounced that his group was going to
proceed to AEI. and "mill-in to
bring business as usual to a halt."The
march to the laboratory ended in a
race as the right-wing students tried
to get there first and block the doors.
