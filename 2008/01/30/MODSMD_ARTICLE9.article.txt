# We are all Americans now

### 
I have a confession to make. I love Amer
ica. No really. 1 think it's great — like
England, only much, much better. This
is not a popular view among Europeans,
especially among my English compatri
ots who don't think that highly of their trans-
Atlantic cousins.
Much of this dislike is recent and will fade

once you all see sense
and elect President

Ohama/Clinton-
Romney/Mc-

Cain/Huckabee/Edwards/Paul/Gravel/Keyes.
1 find something galling, however, about my
countryman's failure to recognize the self-evi
dent truth that is America's greatness. It seems
ignorant not to embrace the last, best hope of
Earth.
Now 1 admit, one of the strangest things
that has happened to me over the last four and
half years is my falling head over heels for this
country. When I sent off my acceptance to
Stanford, 1 expected to spend half a decade
mocking, not praising — and certainly not de
fending — this country.
But America is an easy country to love, es
pecially when you're in California.The people
are as welcoming as anywhere else I've been
(and I've been to a lot of elses). A cornucopia
of riches is available with only the smallest ef
fort. And everything is just so much easier.
Take sinks, for example. Words can hardly
describe how much better life is with hot and
cold water coming out of the same tap. And
don't get me started on trying to live without
waste disposal...
Plumbing marvels aside, though, America is

still leagues above the rest in so many other
ways.
This is the most culturally diverse place on
the planet. Every corner of the world can he
experienced here, if not in full, then at least in
part. To understand how unique that is, com
pare the difficulty of finding an American
diner in Addis Ababa versus an Ethiopian
restaurant in San Francisco.
This cultural diversity goes hand-in-hand
with America's status as the most tolerant
country in the world.
I would've thought that America's toler
ance wasn't up for debate, but a surprising
number of people — both in and out of this
country — are incredulous at the suggestion. I
think the constant presence of race in public
debate may lead some to assume that every
one's a racist, if only because they fail to recog
nize that discussion is part of acceptance. After
all, it's not unsurprising (and not uncommend
able) for the pursuit of an accepting, tolerant
society to leave the people within it attuned to
its flaws but ignorant of the strengths.
Let me finish by making something clear. 1
don't believe America is special or that its citi
zens are exceptional. It just happens to be —
by virtue of its wealth, its incredible beauty
and its cultural diversity — the best place in
the world to live.

Do you love America too? Let me know by
