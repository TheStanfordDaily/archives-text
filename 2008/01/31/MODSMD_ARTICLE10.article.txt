## Plans for faculty homes cut back 
### JOANNA XU STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has reduced the number of new single-fam
ily housing units it is planning to build along Stanford
Avenue from 75 to 37 in an effort to appease College
Terrace residents who expressed concerns about in
creased traffic in their neighborhood, which borders the
southeast corner of campus.
"The number of houses proposed now is almost half
of what was originally considered," said Director of
Community Relations Jean McCown. "Originally we
had proposed that 75 new houses be built there. Now. we
are bringing forward 37 new housing units."
The new plans also call for the new houses to have
driveways facing Olmstead Road instead of Stanford
Avenue, which adjoins the College Terrace neighbor
hood.
"Historically, the College Terrace neighborhood of
Palo Alto is as old as Stanford itself." McCown said.
"Over the years Stanford has grown in the direction of
that neighborhood, beginning with the construction of
Escondido Village in the 1960s and other graduate hous
ing development."
The University also has plans to build townhouse
style rental homes in the same neighborhood in an effort
to provide athletic coaches with affordable housing.
"The construction of new housing was planned out in
the General Use Permit back in 2000," McCown said.
"So plans to do this have been known since 2000."
Since then, a number of changes have also been made to
the construction plan in order to benefit-College Terrace
residents.
Nonetheless, the new developments continue to raise

concerns from College Terrace residents, many of whom
already complain about the increased traffic flow and
parking problems the neighborhood experiences as a re
sult of bordering Stanford.
"There are two layers to the traffic problem from
Stanford," said Susan Rosenberg, director of communi
cations on the College Terrace Residents' Association.
"One is from employees who park in our neighborhood
then take the Marguerite, leaving their cars parked in
the neighborhood all day.The other one is from students
not wanting to pay fees to park their cars ori campus, so
they leave [them] on College Terrace. There's little street
parking now."
College Terrace is a public parking zone and is there
fore an attractive alternative for students who wish not
to pay for an on-campus parking permit.
"I pay a couple hundred dollars a year for my per
mit," said Derrick Jue, a second-year graduate student
living in Escondido Village. "So 1 understand why peo
ple would want to avoid that cost by parking in College
Terrace."
These parking concerns have prompted the Palo Alto
City Council to take action. The Daily reported in Au
gust 2007 that the City Council was exploring the idea of
beginning a Residential Parking Permit Program along
College Terrace streets to alleviate the traffic flow and
parking congestion in the neighborhood.
"A lot of residential communities near large universi
ties have such a program," McCown said. "The Univer
sity, in the General Use Permit in 2(KX). offered $ I (K).(KK)
to help the neighborhood begin such a program."

and athletic coaches. The Univesrity recently announced a decrease in the number of homes that it will build.
noted the changes the University
made to accommodate the College
Terrace residents' concerns.
"Stanford could've had a larger
project, but they chose to build
smaller," Rosenberg said. "They
also agreed to have the driveways
empty onto Olmstead and situate
the new housing in such a way so
that there is a setback between the
Stanford Avenue sidewalk and the
new houses."
"We appreciate Stanford's sensi
tivity," she added.
