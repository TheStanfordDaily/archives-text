## Pakistani students address violence 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Some of Stanford's nearly two dozen undergraduate and gradu
ate students from Pakistan missed the first few days of winter quar
ter due to the South Asian state's recent political upheaval.
After Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared a "state of
emergency" military rule last November, which silenced nearly all
voices of opposition in the political arena, the international media
portrayed a country crumbling into violence and chaos.
The disorder reached a peak after former Prime Minister Be
nazir Bhutto was assassinated on Dec. 27. Bhutto, widely revered in
Pakistan, had recently returned to her home country with a pro
fessed desire to remove Musharraf from power.
For five consecutive days after the incident, looters, rioters and
mobsters stormed the streets. All flights out of Pakistan were de
layed, causing some of Stanford's Pakistani students to miss their
first days of class at the University.
Shams Shaikh "09 and Fahad Mahniood '10 were both in Pak
istan visiting family when Bhutto was assassinated and the worst of
the riots broke out.
"After Benazir was killed, there were four days of national
mourning, which meant four days of chaos," said Shaikh, who is also
a photo editor for The Daily. "Though usually there are
protests when someone dies, most of the rioters weren't even Be
nazir's supporters â€” this was mobsters, rioters and looters, picking
up whatever they wanted. Everyone from 10 year-old kids to old
men.
"There was a lot of anti-government sentiment going around be
cause the people assumed the government h;id something to do
with [the killing]." Shaikh added. "Since people had really strong
sentiment's against law and order, the police were afraid to be out
on the streets. That's why there was chaos."
Mahmood described civilian families afraid to leave their homes
who were, in some cases, running out of groceries.
" I"he roads were all blocked, the buses weren't running, I had to
stay an extra four days," Mahmood said.
Both students had to re-schedule their flights back to Stanford.
After the police returned to the streets on the fifth day of the riots,
however, Shaikh said the situation returned to normal almost im
mediately.
The students, now back at Stanford, said their experiences in
Pakistan, both over winter break and growing up. contrast with
American media reports of the country.
"The U.S. media exaggerates everything," Shaikh said. "They
only report what'they care about, which is terrorism. I hear on the
news that there is an emergency, but when I call home, my mom says
everything is fine, things are normal. Average people are going
about their daily lives. As long as a man can earn his wage, he is con
tent."
What struck Shaikh most about his return home was not the na
tional upheaval, but rather the infrastructure progress that had
been made at the local grassroots level.
"There were bridges, buildings, offices built that were not there
when I left [in 2005]" he said, noting that the mayor of his home
town. Karachi, was actually more effective at managing local affairs
