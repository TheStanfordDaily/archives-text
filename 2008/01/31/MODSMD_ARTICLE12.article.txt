## Editor's Farewell Using the past as a lens for the future 
### 
Oftentimes, these biannual Editor's
Farewells are loaded with self-congrat
ulations and bittersweet reflections on
the volume that was. I hope to make this one
somewhat different.
First, the facts: today's paper is the last issue
of The Daily's 232 nd volume. It is also my last
issue as Editor in Chief Tomorrow will begin
Volume 233, and as I put the paper to bed last
night, I also handed the reins to my successor,
Julie Klein, who will take over tonight.
While I will no longer be editor, much of
the current staff will carry over into Volume
233, providing some much-needed continuity
for an organization often defined by a lack
thereof. Moreover, Julie has assembled a top
notch team, and I have no doubt that she will,
in her tenure as editor, raise whatever bar I set
over the last four months.
To the casual reader, the change in lead
ership will be hardly noticeable; I"he Daily
will not be drastically different tomorrow
than it is today.
That's not to say. however, that The Daily is
a static organization. Our paper—like the
journalism profession as a whole — is in a per
petual state of flux. Nowhere is this more evi
dent to me than when I look through the hard
copies of The Daily's archives, which are im
mortalized in bound volumes in our (soon to
be torn down) office.
Specifically. I found myself leafing through
Volume 139 — which contains the spring 1961
editions — on more than one occasion during
the last 15 weeks. The editor of that nearly 50-
year-old volume was my father. Maynard
Parker *62, who told me many times before his
death in October 1998 that his Stanford expe
rience was colored primarily by The Daily.
As I look through Volume 139.1 can't help
but think how much the world and this coun
try, journalism and The Daily, have changed.
In 1961. many Americans were appalled at
their countrymen who had. a year earlier, elect
ed the first Catholic to the Presidency; in 2008.
there's a good chance that this country will
elect either its first African-American or its
first woman to the highest office in the land. In
1961 .Alan Shepard became the first American
in outer space; in 2008, we are considering
sending a human to Mars.Times have changed.

• On a more micro-level, today's version of
The Daily is a very different beast than its 1961
counterpart. In my father's time. The Daily
was a four-page paper filled mostly with wire
stories from The Associated Press. In the pre-
Internet era and the days before television
provided round-the-clock news coverage,
newspapers were Americans' primary source
of information. The Daily's coverage of inter
national and national news in the early 1960s
reflected this lofty position.
Today, The Daily has become more of a
niche paper — and that's okay. In 2008. we
rarely report on non-Stanford news, and
when we do it's usually just to fill empty
space. We have, however,cornered the mar
ket on Stanford sports, and we often report
stories that national news sources later pick
up — such as Donald Rumsfeld's Hoover
Institution appointment in September and
Chelsea Clinton's surprise appearance ear
lier this month.
As I wrap up my tenure as editor of The
Daily. I am both sad to be leaving my col
leagues and thrilled to be returning to my life
outside of this newspaper. I am comforted
knowing that I leave The Daily in good hands,
and I leave with no regrets.
Like my father before me, much of my
Stanford experience has been defined by this
newspaper. I will never forget my experiences
at The Daily, and while my father is not alive to
celebrate the end of my tenure with me — just
as he wasn't alive when I was admitted to Stan
ford in 2004 and won't be there when I gradu
ate in June — I know with absolute certainty
that he would be proud of what I've done here.
And knowing that makes me smile.
Sincerely,

Nick Parker '08"
Editor in Chief, Volume 232
The Sum fort I Daily
