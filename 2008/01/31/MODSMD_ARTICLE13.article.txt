## We will make your children sick 
### 
When economists think about which
goods are public (clean air.a pleasing
skyline) and which are private (a
meal,a magazine), the distinction they make is
one of excludability.
If you can be excluded from using a good,
you can be made to pay for it. Considered
from this perspective,the default is that every
one enjoys a resource. The right to exclude
someone from enjoyment of a resource is the
core of any property right. For example, a
patent or copyright holder can forbid unli
censed use and therefore can charge for li
censes, just as a restaurant owner can refuse to
serve customers unless they pay In contrast,if
my buddy was legally made the owner of the
San Francisco skyline and started selling
"viewing licenses," no one would buy one un
less he figured out a way to prevent unlicensed
viewing. You don't make money by having
something people want, you make money by
preventing people from getting it for free.
Property rights were instituted precisely
because the threat of exclusion is a powerful
motivator — the driving force in our econo
my The restaurant owner tells me, "I have this
fo<xl, but I will exclude you from it unless you
give me something of value." The landlord
tells me," I have a nice place you could live, but
I will exclude you unless you give me some
thing of value." And so the threat of exclusion
gets us all out of bed every morning.
Exclusion is a threat, wholly a threat and
nothing but a threat. Other threats could be
equally motivating. Right now I go to work
because my landlord threatens to exclude me
from my apartment; if he was threatening me
with a broken jaw instead, I would go to work
just the same.
Other things could also be excluded. The
ability to confine someone is a property right
in their liberty.The ability to strangle someone
is a property right in their air supply. If you can
exclude them from a resource, you can charge
them for it. Right now we don't have estab
lished property rights in air supply or person
al movement, but if we added those to the list
of things a person might be excluded from
(apartments, movie theaters) it would certain
ly be a powerful economic motivator. Not just
the unemployed, but even many happily re
tired people and young children might get
jobs if their air supply was at stake.
Air supply, however, is thought of as a
need, and people are generally comfortable
with threatening to exclude others from
"wants" rather than "needs." If you didn't

have a job. being excluded from a nice restau
rant would be acceptable. Being excluded
from the air supply, however, would be
thought of as cruel.
What about healthcare as an excludable
good, a motivator? Are we really going to say
to a person. "If you don't work, we will make
you sick"? A decent human might say, "My
coworker is lazy; I don't think he deserves to
eat at fancy restaurants all the time." But who
would say. 'My coworker is lazy; I think he de
serves to be sick." Who would say something
like that?
Yet that is the fundamental basis of our
pay-for-healthcare system in the United
States: "If you won't work hard and earn
money, we will make you sick." This is health
care, not movie tickets. International laws of
war say that making people sick is illegal — if
someone invades your country and starts
shooting at you. it is considered cruel for you
to try to make them sick — yet we threaten
our own citizens with this on a daily basis.
And I haven't even started on the pay-for
healthcare system for children. If you don't
work, we will make your children sick! Who
threatens somebody with sick kids? That's a
psycho movie villain thing — not even Rudy
Giuliani would make a threat like that.
And yet he does — when he says expand
ed coverage for children is "moving toward
socialized medicine," that is exactly what he is
doing. Ibis "socialized medicine" he rails
against is providing healthcare to sick people;
privatized medicine threatens to leave sick
people sick in order to set an example. Private
markets run on exclusion — exclusion is what
makes people pay, and needing to pay is what
makes people work. We literally have a politi
cal movement in America saying you deserve
to get sick, and threatening your children with
sickness.
To me. that's sick.
