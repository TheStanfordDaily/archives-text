## Giving birth to the hip-hop dancer inside of you 
### 
Hip-hop dancing is like a modern curse
for most men. It shows up at many a
social event, it's hard to do well, and
men are usually bad at it while women are the
exact opposite. Like displaying plumage,
dancing comprises a significant portion of the
courting ritual with females.
This all leads to "dance oppression syn
drome," where the act of, or pressure to,dance
can leave one feeling uncomfortable and sad.
I was once afflicted with dance oppression
syndrome. My first experiences of dancing in
public were utterly traumatic. At a house
party in high school. I was so stiff on the dance
floor that people actually noticed and com
mented on my dancing — typically a rare oc
currence in dark and cramped quarters. Later
on. after attempting and failing miserably to
C-walk in front of a cute girl, I vowed never to
dance again.These days, however. I'm one of
the best dancers on most dance floors. I still
have a lot to learn, but I also have a lot of wis
dom to dispense.
So how do you get better at dancing?
Good dancing is about passionate, coordinat
ed movements, good form and technique. Al
cohol can help with the passion by reducing
inhibitions, but it won't help with the rest.
And you certainly don't want to be that one
guy who, although content, is oblivious of how
truly bad his dancing is.

Improvement in rhythm and form is best
gained through guided practice. If you are just
looking to grind on someone or sway you way
through the night, a five minute lesson from
any decent dancer and some real-world expe
rience will suffice. But if you want to bust a
move and actually enjoy dancing, then a
good, structured class is in order.
Classes provide two things — they help
you gain rhythm and skill, and through that
they help you gain the confidence to dance
anywhere. There is a big problem in finding
good beginningclasses,unfortunately. As a be
ginner. you need to slowly learn a few simple
moves, broken down step by step. In many
classes, even "beginning" ones, the pace is too
fast, with too many moves strung together in
one sequence. It's hard to get anything out of
these classes,and furthermore, they can be aw
fully discouraging to the nascent dancer.
Great dancing is about subtlety, and a poor
class cannot properly pass on these nuances.

What to do then? If you can't find any suit
able dance classes in your area, try asking
your dance-savvy acquaintances, scour the
Internet for clues, or use resources like how
to videos on You Tube or forums like Nustu
dios.com. If you're still unsatisfied, try ex
panding your reach to classes beyond your
level, taking in what you can, and practicing
the rest by yourself afterward. Don't mistake
challenging for unapproachable, however.
When I first took beginning hip-hop classes,
almost every move was problematic, and to
further my unease, I was the only guy amidst
a class of 13-year-old girls. Luckily I had a
great teacher that encouraged me and helped
me out after class. But it took a lot of practice
outside of class to really see improvement.
Dancing can be one of the most enjoyable
experiences in this world — aesthetic expres
sion via the joyous act of bodily movement.
So if you want to discover the joy of dancing,
find some perseverance and proper classes. If
you need some inspiration, watch my favorite
dancers, "Hilty" and "Bosch," on YouTUbe.
And if you want to make your columnist real
ly happy, become a great dancer and create
your own blurry but impressive videos.
