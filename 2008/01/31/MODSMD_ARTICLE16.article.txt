## Keep Stanford small 
### 
Imagine yourself as a Stanford admissions
officer. You review a few thousand excel
lent applications every year, but face the
unpleasant task of rejecting 90 percent of
them. You notice that year after year, Stan
ford's freshman class only gets stronger —
with rising GPAs, SAT scores and class ranks
— but the number of spots remains fixed at
around 1,60(). Although you are proud of
being the gatekeeper to one of the world's
finest universities, your heart also sinks when
you reject a brilliant kid — a rejection that
takes place because Stanford has no more
room.
Given this situation, one can understand
why the administration is considering ex
panding the size of the freshman class. All
other things being equal, it is good to spread
the benefits of a Stanford education to more
people. By having more students, Stanford
will also produce more graduates who will be
come distinguished in their own fields and

add to Stanford's reputation.
However, an oversized undergraduate
population would also carry huge costs.
Housing problems would he exacerbated; al
ready. there are some Stanford students who
lack proper living arrangements.There will be
longc queues at the dining halls. The TYee
house and Subway. But, more importantly,
students would have fewer opportunities to
interact and develop relationships with facul
ty. Speaking as an economics major, I find that
most of my professors' office hours are heav
ily attended and held in small rooms — hard
ly conducive to developing close, meaningful
relationships with one's mentors.
There arc those who argue that expansion
will help achieve greater diversity. However,
Stanford could probably achieve this goal
more effectively by diversifying the existing
undergraduate population. Out of Stanford's
6.689 current undergraduates, 44 percent
come from a single state — California —

with New York and Texas representing a large
portion of the remaining 50 percent of non-
Californian US. undergraduates. What about
more equal representation from other states?
Moreover, Asia, Africa and Europe are repre
sented by only seven percent of students.
Given Stanford's commitment to diversity,
why not consider diversifying the existing un
dergraduate population as an alternative to
drastically expanding it?
In addition, we must also consider the idea
that Stanford should stav selective in order to
remain a magnet for the world's top students,
scientists, thinkers and innovators. Rightly or
wrongly, the public sees selectivity as an indi
cator of quality, and Stanford must respect
that sentiment. Already, Stanford's under
graduate population is bigger than that of
Harvard. Yale, Princeton, MIT. Duke. Dart
mouth and Brown. Moreover, of the top 10
American universities ranked by U.S.
News and World Report, only one.
the University of Pennsylvania, has
rnori than 7,000 undergraduates.
Here at Stanford, there is an un
spoken rule that you must not speak
about rankings because they invoke
feelings of competitiveness. Iliis, of
course, is a charade: we regulate only
the speech, not the feelings. But the

charade is necessary because it
keeps us civil. I"hat being said, how
ever. it is worth noting that Stanford
was ranked a dismal 1 c >th in the lat
est Times of London Higher Educa
tion Supplement. Moreover, al
though Stanford was once ranked
first in the U.S. News rankings for a
couple of years in the l l )80s, we have
since lost that spot to Harvard,
Princeton or Yale — and we haven't
been ranked in the top three in quite
some time.
Stanford's admit rate is about
10.3 percent, which seems low until
we note that Harvard's is nine per

cent. But Harvard isn't contemplat
ing expansion. In other parts of the
world, many top Asian universities
have even lower acceptance rates.
For example. India's Institutes of
Technology (III) typically receive
about 300.000 applications for only
5,000 places, a 1.7 percent admit rate.
It is regrettable that Stanford must
reject many qualified applicants
each year. But between a high rejec
tion rate and a high acceptance rate,
the former is by far the lesser of two
evils.
At this early stage, it is unclear
what the size of the proposed in

crease is — we don't know if we're
talking about adding a few dozen, a
few hundred or a few thousand stu
dents. Ultimately, it is essential to
have an open debate on the pro
posed undergraduate population ex
pansion. Students, faculty and alum
ni all have a vested interest in ensur
ing that any change in the undergrad
uate population will improve, not
hamper, Stanford's educational envi
ronment and its ability to contribute
to society.
