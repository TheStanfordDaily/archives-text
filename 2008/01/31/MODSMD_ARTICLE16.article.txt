## Keep Stanford small 
### 
Imagine yourself as a Stanford admissions
officer. You review a few thousand excel
lent applications every year, but face the
unpleasant task of rejecting 90 percent of
them. You notice that year after year, Stan
ford's freshman class only gets stronger —
with rising GPAs, SAT scores and class ranks
— but the number of spots remains fixed at
around 1,60(). Although you are proud of
being the gatekeeper to one of the world's
finest universities, your heart also sinks when
you reject a brilliant kid — a rejection that
takes place because Stanford has no more
room.
Given this situation, one can understand
why the administration is considering ex
panding the size of the freshman class. All
other things being equal, it is good to spread
the benefits of a Stanford education to more
people. By having more students, Stanford
will also produce more graduates who will be
come distinguished in their own fields and

add to Stanford's reputation.
However, an oversized undergraduate
population would also carry huge costs.
Housing problems would he exacerbated; al

lack proper living arrangements.There will be

students would have fewer opportunities to

most of my professors' office hours are heav

ly conducive to developing close, meaningful
relationships with one's mentors.
There arc those who argue that expansion
will help achieve greater diversity. However,
Stanford could probably achieve this goal
more effectively by diversifying the existing
undergraduate population. Out of Stanford's
6.689 current undergraduates, 44 percent
come from a single state — California —

with New York and Texas representing a large
portion of the remaining 50 percent of non-
Californian US. undergraduates. What about
more equal representation from other states?
Moreover, Asia, Africa and Europe are repre
sented by only seven percent of students.
Given Stanford's commitment to diversity,
why not consider diversifying the existing un
dergraduate population as an alternative to
drastically expanding it?
In addition, we must also consider the idea
that Stanford should stav selective in order to
remain a magnet for the world's top students,
scientists, thinkers and innovators. Rightly or
wrongly, the public sees selectivity as an indi
cator of quality, and Stanford must respect
that sentiment. Already, Stanford's under
graduate population is bigger than that of
Harvard. Yale, Princeton, MIT. Duke. Dart
mouth and Brown. Moreover, of the top 10
