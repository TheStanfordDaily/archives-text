## MEN SET TO SPIKE TIGERS 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball
team takes the floor tonight in Burnham Pavilion,
it will be going for just its second win over Pacific
in its six previous attempts.The tide seems to have
turned — while the Cardinal is having its best sea
son in several years, the Tigers are still looking for
their first win of the year.
"They are on the young side as a team," head
coach John Kosty said of Pacific. "But they fight
hard and scrap and they will get their wins in
league."
Last year, the Tigers (0-8,0-6 MPSF) won both
of their meetings with the Cardinal (6-3,3-3);2008
is a new year, however. While the Cardinal re
turned almost all of its starters from 2007 and
brought in one of the nation's best freshman class
es, Pacific lost their senior setter and middle
blocker, the anchors of last year's team.
"Ihey have two solid returning starters in
Pekka Seppanen and Simon Chen-Byerley,"
Kosty said. " Ihey are good players and that is a
great core to build a team around — a really good
outside hitter and a really good middle blocker."
Seppanen. the offensive leader as a junior,
again spearheads the Pacific offense in his final
season with 91 kills at a .224 clip.The senior from
Finland is also the Tigers' top digger and server,
with 56 digs and 11 aces on the season.
Chen-Byerley, also a senior, has started every
match and is fourth in kills and is hitting a team
high .402. He is also second in service aces and
third in blocking. Jeff Hendershot leads the net
defense with 21 blocks, while freshman setter Kris
Staks is averaging 11.29 assists per game.
A win tonight would be the Cardinal's seventh
of the year, giving the team as many wins as it has
had in the last two years. If the first month of this
season was any indication, Stanford seems well on
its way to its first double-digit win total since 2005
and its first winning season since 2003.
Stanford comes into tonight's match fresh off
a win against Santa Barbara, which stopped a two
game skid. With an even MPS! record, the Cardi
nal sits comfortably in the middle of the confer
ence. 'Ihe Tigers, on the other hand, have been
swept in five of their last six outings.
When the two teams — traveling partners in
the MPSF — went to Southern California last
weekend, the Tigers were swept by both No. 6
Nortluidge and Santa Barbara. Ihe Cardinal
earned a split.
"We are still a young team." Kosty said. "We
have had some losses that we were not happy
with and some wins that we may not have earned
quite like we should have. But we have learned a
lot so far."

GAME NOTES: The No. 7 Cardinal will look to begin a new
winning streak against the lowly Tigers tonight, after
downing UCSB last Friday in three games. Previously, the
Cardinal had lost two in a row, after a fabulous 5-2 start
to its season, against Pepperdine and at Cal State North
ridge. Stanford has been led this year by by senior Matt
Ceran and sophomore Evan Romero so far this season,
with 101 and 119 kills on the season, respectively.
The young members of the Stanford squad —
six freshmen and five sophomores — have al
ready seen substantial playing time and are con
tributing, despite their relative inexperience.
" Ihe nice thing about our team is that we have
a good mixture of veterans and younger players,"
Kosty said." We have been intermixing the return
ers and the young guys through the season and
that has helped the younger players mature very
quickly."
Sophomore opposite Evan Romero and sen
ior outside hitter Matt Ceran are the Cardinal's
top hitters, with 119 and 101 kills on the season, re
spectively. As a four-year starter and the only sen
ior on the roster,Ceran has been a valuable leader
for Stanford.
"Matt Ceran has played great for most of the
season so far." Kosty said. "1 lis play has been key
in all of our victories."
Ceran also leads the-defense with 79 digs on
the year. lle also has 11 blocks, making him one of
six players in double-digits at the net. Junior Bran
don Williams has a team-best 19, while Romero
and freshman middle blocker Charley Henrikson
each has 17.
"One of the great things about this team is how
deep we are in the middle," Kosty said. "We have
started four of our five middle blockers this year
and all of them have played. We have really im
proved our whole middle blocking corps from last
year."
Ihe Cardinal will face off with the Tigers
tonight in Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m. Ihey will
follow that with a match on Saturday night against
non-conference opponent Ball State (4-5, 2-1
MlVA),also in Burnham.
