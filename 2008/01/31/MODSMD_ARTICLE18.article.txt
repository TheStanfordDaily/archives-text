cusses campus student space," The
Daily inaccurately reported that six
televisions would he installed in Old
Union to transform the space into a
more social atmosphere. In fact,

in the first floor lobby. In addition, it
is not the Old Union Programming
Board that is providing the television
set or the X-Box consoles, as The
Daily initially reported.
