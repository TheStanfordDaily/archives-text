# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Thurs. revelry continues despite Fri. classes 
### SHELBY MARTIN STAFF WRITER 
Sleeping late on Fridays may soon
become a thing of the past for students
at the University of lowa, thanks to a
new university policy designed to curb
Thursday night drinking. The Univer
sity plans to pay departments to hold
their classes on Friday mornings, dish
ing out $20 per student who signs up
for a rescheduled class.
The University of lowa's policy
change comes on the heels of research
showing that students who do not have
class on Fridays drink twice as much
alcohol on Thursdays as their peers
who do have Friday classes.
While other universities are scram
bling to add Friday classes, Vaden
Health Center's Substance Abuse Pre

vention Program Manager Ralph Cas
tro pointed out that Stanford already
schedules classes and sections on Fri
days, and some departments even have
Saturday classes.
Despite all this. Stanford students
are no strangers to Thursday night rev
elry.
Eva Jellison 09 was interviewed at
a Thursday night party in a Toyon
dorm room.
"I have fencing tournaments every
weekend, so Thursday is my only
chance to go out," she said.
Traveling with her fencing team
rules out Friday classes for Jellison, but
she said if she ever had to sit through a
lecture that day, Thursday night party
ing would be out of the question.
But some others do not share Jelli
son''s attitude. Stanford students seem
to have a "work hard, play hard" atti
tude that means Thursday night party
ing is not incompatible with Friday
morning studying.
Sara Maatta '10 was interviewed at
the same Thursday night party Jellison
attended.
"I always go to my Friday classes,"
she said. "It's not hard, especially if it's
a lecture. All you have to do is write

down what the professor says."
Caitlin Rugg TO had a three
hour Saturday morning class one
quarter.The Human Biology core
conflicted with the scheduled .

time of Chemistry 35. so stu
dents who signed up for both i
courses spent Saturday morn- |
ings learning chemistry.
"I went out on Fridays and
I still went to class Saturday,"
Rugg said.

Friday classes seem unlikely to
change general campus attitudes to- |
ward Thursday night partying.
"Thursday drinking is part of the i
culture now," Maata said. "ITiurs
day became the new Friday."
Events like Thursday's Senior
Night seem to confirm Maata's
statement. A tipsy senior boarding
the shuttle bound for bars in Palo
Alto was asked if she had class the
next day.
"I have 10 a.m class tomor
row!" she said. "I'm going to go
hung over! And I'm going to be
happy!"
