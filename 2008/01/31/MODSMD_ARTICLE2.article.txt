## No. 14 Card NEEDS TO COME UP BIG AT UW 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The sweep Stanford men's bas
ketball suffered on its Washington
trip last year is just one example of a
disturbing trend — the Cardinal is
just 1-7 in its last eight games in the
Evergreen State.
Even the 2003-04 team, the one
that simply could not lose with Mike
Montgomery at the helm, was
stymied in Seattle. They were 26-0
entering that game against the
Huskies. They left 26-1, suffering a
75-62 defeat — the team's only loss
of the regular season.
So when exactly was the last
time Stanford (16-3, 5-2 Pac-10)
won at Washington (12-8,3-4) and
Washington State (17-2,5-2)? Even
fifth-year senior Fred Washington
can't remember.
"1 don't even know,"he said. "1
just know I've never won there, and
1 don't think the class before me
won there. Going to Washington is
pretty good for us at this time in the
season, because our ranking means
nothing."
Indeed.it will be hard for the No.
14 Cardinal to be too cocky on a trip
the team last swept in 2002. That's
what Fred Washington fears for his
young teammates, winners of three
straight.
But head coach Trent Johnson
set the tone early and often in his
Tuesday press conference with the
media.
"The thing that's always caused
us a problem is that they're explo
sive, like UCLA or USC is," he said
of the Huskies. "We have to limit

NOTES: The No. 14 Cardinal may have its
hands full with the Huskies in Seattle, if re
cent history is any guide. Stanford has won
three in a row, but is just 1 -7 in its last eight
games in Washington. The Cardinal are
currently tied for second place in the Fbc-10
with Washington State behind UCLA, and a
sweep of this weekend's opponents could
go a long way towards moving Stanford up
in the rankings.

They've really handled us up there

Jon Brockman is a force in the

league-best 11 rebounds per game

Brockman's play also has him en
