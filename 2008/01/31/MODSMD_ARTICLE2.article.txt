## No. 14 Card NEEDS TO COME UP BIG AT UW 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The sweep Stanford men's bas
ketball suffered on its Washington
trip last year is just one example of a
disturbing trend — the Cardinal is
just 1-7 in its last eight games in the
Evergreen State.
Even the 2003-04 team, the one
that simply could not lose with Mike
Montgomery at the helm, was
stymied in Seattle. They were 26-0
entering that game against the
Huskies. They left 26-1, suffering a
75-62 defeat — the team's only loss
of the regular season.
So when exactly was the last
time Stanford (16-3, 5-2 Pac-10)
won at Washington (12-8,3-4) and
Washington State (17-2,5-2)? Even
fifth-year senior Fred Washington
can't remember.
"1 don't even know,"he said. "1
just know I've never won there, and
1 don't think the class before me
won there. Going to Washington is
pretty good for us at this time in the
season, because our ranking means
nothing."
Indeed.it will be hard for the No.
14 Cardinal to be too cocky on a trip
the team last swept in 2002. That's
what Fred Washington fears for his
young teammates, winners of three
straight.
But head coach Trent Johnson
set the tone early and often in his
Tuesday press conference with the
media.
"The thing that's always caused
us a problem is that they're explo
sive, like UCLA or USC is," he said
of the Huskies. "We have to limit

NOTES: The No. 14 Cardinal may have its
hands full with the Huskies in Seattle, if re
cent history is any guide. Stanford has won
three in a row, but is just 1 -7 in its last eight
games in Washington. The Cardinal are
currently tied for second place in the Fbc-10

this battle intently.
But perhaps no one will care more about tonight's 7
p.m. game than the Huskies' Tim Morris. Morris signed
with Mike Montgomery' and Stanford in 2003, but was not
a fit in Trent Johnson's system. Thus, following the 2005-06
season, his redshirt sophomore year, the 6-foot-4 guard
transferred to play for his cousin Lorenzo Romar and the
up-tempo Huskies. Morris had to sit out last year per
NCAA regulations, but he's averaging eight points and
four rebounds in 35 minutes per game this year.
"I don't think he sees it as a big deal, and we're really
not looking at it like that," said Washington, who added
that he also seriously considered transferring after Mont
gomery left to coach the Golden State Warriors following
the 2003-04 season. "He'd been throwing around maybe
transferring and then when the coach change happened
and no one was happy, he was [the] only one."
Morris' sister, Tiffany, is a current Stanford undergrad
uate. Washington said he thought Morris might try to
transfer back to the Farm in the spring in order to gradu
ate with a Stanford degree.
Brook and Robin Lopez will also match up tonight
against Quincy Pondexter. their fellow 2006 graduate of
San Joaquin Memorial 1 ligh and a stai ting forward for the
Huskies.
Despite Stanford's horrible history in Washington, the
Cardinal enters tonight as two-point favorites, in large part
because of a defensive discrepancy between the two schools.
Buoyed by the Lopez twins' presence in the paint, Stanford
is allowing an average of 58 points per Pac-10 game. Wash
ington's backcourt, meanwhile, is athletic but undisciplined
defensively. They allow 69 points per Pac-10 contest.
While tonight's tip may carry more personal implica
tions. the bigger game from a basketball standpoint is Sat
urday's high-noon battle with No. 9 Washington State,
whose defense allows a league-best 54 points per game.
After a 14-0 start, the Cougars lost 81 -74 to UCLA in a bat
tle for Pac-10 supremacy. They were lucky to split last
weekend, losing 76-64 at Arizona before coming back
from an 11 -point first-half deficit to steal a 56-55 win over
Arizona State. Even so, if both the Cardinal and the
Cougars take care of business tonight, Saturday's game
will be a batile for second place in the conference; both
teams are currently one loss behind No. 5 UCLA (18-2,6-
1) in the conference standings.
TTie Cougars are probably the Pac-10 team most simi
lar to Stanford this year: nothing special offensively, but
suffocating play on the other end of the court.
Guard Derrick Low (14 points per game) and Aus
tralian post Aron Baynes (12 points) are the scoring lead
ers for a team that handles the ball incredibly well —
Washington State leads the conference in turnover margin
and assist-to-turnover ratio.
If the Cougars have the edge on the perimeter, howev
er, Stanford will nave the advantage down low, as they al
most always do. The Card leads the Pac-10 with 39 re
bounds per game. Washington State is dead-last at 30.

Arizona State. Even so, if both the Cardinal and the
Cougars take care of business tonight, Saturday's game
will be a batile for second place in the conference; both
teams are currently one loss behind No. 5 UCLA (18-2,6-
1) in the conference standings.
TTie Cougars are probably the Pac-10 team most simi
lar to Stanford this year: nothing special offensively, but
suffocating play on the other end of the court.
Guard Derrick Low (14 points per game) and Aus
tralian post Aron Baynes (12 points) are the scoring lead
ers for a team that handles the ball incredibly well —
Washington State leads the conference in turnover margin
and assist-to-turnover ratio.
If the Cougars have the edge on the perimeter, howev
er, Stanford will nave the advantage down low, as they al
most always do. The Card leads the Pac-10 with 39 re
bounds per game. Washington State is dead-last at 30.

The sweep Stanford men's bas
ketball suffered on its Washington
trip last year is just one example of a
disturbing trend — the Cardinal is
just 1-7 in its last eight games in the
Evergreen State.
Even the 2003-04 team, the one
that simply could not lose with Mike
Montgomery at the helm, was
stymied in Seattle. They were 26-0
entering that game against the
Huskies. They left 26-1, suffering a
75-62 defeat — the team's only loss
of the regular season.
So when exactly was the last
time Stanford (16-3, 5-2 Pac-10)
won at Washington (12-8,3-4) and
Washington State (17-2,5-2)? Even
fifth-year senior Fred Washington
can't remember.
"1 don't even know,"he said. "1
just know I've never won there, and
1 don't think the class before me
won there. Going to Washington is
pretty good for us at this time in the
season, because our ranking means
nothing."
Indeed.it will be hard for the No.
14 Cardinal to be too cocky on a trip
the team last swept in 2002. That's
what Fred Washington fears for his
young teammates, winners of three
straight.
But head coach Trent Johnson
set the tone early and often in his
Tuesday press conference with the
media.
"The thing that's always caused
us a problem is that they're explo
sive, like UCLA or USC is," he said
of the Huskies. "We have to limit

NOTES: The No. 14 Cardinal may have its
hands full with the Huskies in Seattle, if re
cent history is any guide. Stanford has won
three in a row, but is just 1 -7 in its last eight
games in Washington. The Cardinal are
currently tied for second place in the Fbc-10
with Washington State behind UCLA, and a
sweep of this weekend's opponents could
go a long way towards moving Stanford up

Anthony Goods and the Cardinal look to overcome
their recent struggles in Washington this weekend,
starting tonight against the Huskies. Stanford rolls
into Seattle tied for the second spot in the Pac-10.
this battle intently.
But perhaps no one will care more about tonight's 7
p.m. game than the Huskies' Tim Morris. Morris signed
with Mike Montgomery' and Stanford in 2003, but was not
a fit in Trent Johnson's system. Thus, following the 2005-06
season, his redshirt sophomore year, the 6-foot-4 guard
transferred to play for his cousin Lorenzo Romar and the
up-tempo Huskies. Morris had to sit out last year per
NCAA regulations, but he's averaging eight points and
four rebounds in 35 minutes per game this year.
"I don't think he sees it as a big deal, and we're really
not looking at it like that," said Washington, who added
that he also seriously considered transferring after Mont
gomery left to coach the Golden State Warriors following
the 2003-04 season. "He'd been throwing around maybe
transferring and then when the coach change happened
and no one was happy, he was [the] only one."
Morris' sister, Tiffany, is a current Stanford undergrad
uate. Washington said he thought Morris might try to
transfer back to the Farm in the spring in order to gradu
ate with a Stanford degree.
Brook and Robin Lopez will also match up tonight
against Quincy Pondexter. their fellow 2006 graduate of
San Joaquin Memorial 1 ligh and a stai ting forward for the
Huskies.
Despite Stanford's horrible history in Washington, the
Cardinal enters tonight as two-point favorites, in large part
because of a defensive discrepancy between the two schools.
Buoyed by the Lopez twins' presence in the paint, Stanford
is allowing an average of 58 points per Pac-10 game. Wash
ington's backcourt, meanwhile, is athletic but undisciplined
defensively. They allow 69 points per Pac-10 contest.
While tonight's tip may carry more personal implica
tions. the bigger game from a basketball standpoint is Sat
urday's high-noon battle with No. 9 Washington State,
whose defense allows a league-best 54 points per game.
After a 14-0 start, the Cougars lost 81 -74 to UCLA in a bat
tle for Pac-10 supremacy. They were lucky to split last
weekend, losing 76-64 at Arizona before coming back
from an 11 -point first-half deficit to steal a 56-55 win over
Arizona State. Even so, if both the Cardinal and the
Cougars take care of business tonight, Saturday's game
will be a batile for second place in the conference; both
teams are currently one loss behind No. 5 UCLA (18-2,6-
1) in the conference standings.
