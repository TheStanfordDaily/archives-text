## GSC calls for stipend increases 
### NIKHIL KAMAT 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) discussed
last night approaching the University to increase
graduate stipends amidst concerns that the stipends
are not keeping up with changes in the economy.
GSC parliamentarian Adam Beberg, a Computer
Science doctoral candidate, gave a presentation to the
council highlighting how the weakening of the dollar
and rises in commodity prices have reduced the value
of the graduate stipend through increases in the cost
of living.
According to Beberg. stipends are adjusted by the
consumer price index, which has risen by about 3 per
cent annually over the past two decades. Based on
changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value
of consumer goods, he claimed that the stipend is only
worth 70 percent of what it was worth in the year 2000.
"You can't buy as much gas as you could," Beberg
said."lf you just converted your stipend into gasoline
in 2000. it's a third less now it you converted it. Milk,
grain, red meat, rice, corn, all these things, they went
up 90 percent in the last year alone, and that's a UN
figure. As far as our food buying power, we're making
40 percent of what we were."
The financial insecurity of graduate students, many
whom are trying to work and take classes at the same
time, was noted by the GSC. Citing a recent survey of
graduate students. Beberg said that of the 20 percent
of graduate students with jobs. 45 percent of them
rated money as a "significant worry." From the same
survey, over 50 percent of graduate students with chil
dren rated money in the same way.
Stipends at Stanford are determined by particular

schools and departments within the University. Grad
uate stipends in the School of Engineering are derived
from research grants. In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the process is somewhat different. GSC co
chair George Bloom said the minimum stipend is de
termined from each department's budget. Changes in
the sources of funding, like grants, often lead to budg
etary constraints within departments.
'When I started four years ago. we had a two thou
sand or eighteen hundred research budget." Bloom
said. "That was cut immediately, 1 think now it's five
hundred. You come in thinking that it's a part of your
income, that's a significant reduction, actually."
GSC co-chair Kristina Keating, a geophysics doc
toral student, suggested that an alternative approach
to advocating for stipend increases would be pushing
for reductions in the cost of living expenses like hous
ing. energy and food, although she noted that it was
difficult for the University to control those costs.
Annual increases in tuition, which are usually
around 6 to 7 percent, were noted by the GSC as a tar
get to equal for stipend increases. Past attempts at
stipend raises have been successful.
"The years we actually did this, we got six percent
raises, and the years we didn't, we got 3 percent rais
es," Beberg said.
The GSC plans to approach the University in late
February for a stipend increase. Beberg informed the
GSC that limited sources of funding, including cuts in
federal funding by the Bush administration, are put
ting a greater strain on the University.
"It's going to be a hard fight," Beberg said.
