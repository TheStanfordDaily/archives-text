# CAMPUS LIFE
## Play celebrates Dickinson's life 
### ANNEKE NELSON 
Stanford's Continuing Studies
Program is bringing one of history's
most reclusive poets into the public
light, putting on a three-part series of
performances in memory of Emily
Dickinson. The series kicked off last
night with a play about Dickinson's
correspondence with her mentor.
Three actresses played the often
misunderstood 19th century poet in
Drama Department Artist in Resi
dence Amy Freed's play,"Soul at the
White Heat." Throughout the piece,
composer David Giovacchini and
son Lido played songs from Dickin
son's time on 19th century instru
ments.
"Not every poet or piece of litera
ture lends itself well [to a perform
ance]," said Associate Director for
Honors Writing and Continuing
Studies Prof. Hilton Obenzinger, an
organizer of the event. "Her portray
al in the first evening [was] very dif
ferent than what people think of her,
as genteel. It [was] very dramatic and
rebellious."
"[Having three actresses] allows
different voices in Dickinson," added
Emeritus English Prof. Albert Gelpi,
who has devoted much of his studies
to Dickinson's work. "It makes for a
dramatic tension and contrast."
Dickinson was depressed and op
pressed, intellectual and religious, ac

cording to Obenzinger. Nonetheless,
she was confident in her poetic skills.
"Despite being a recluse in her fa
ther's house." Gelpi said, "she was in
tensely aware of and engaged with
her culture. [In the early 1860s] she
was finding herself bursting with po
etry."
It was then that Dickinson began
her correspondence with Thomas
Higginson.a well-known critic, aboli
tionist and social commentator in the
late 1800s. He had written an article
in The Atlantic Monthly to aspiring
writers, an essay called "Letter to a
Young Contributor." When Dickin
son read this, she — uncharacteristi
cally— took the opportunity to re
spond to Higginson, asking him to

critique her poetry. He accepted.
"She later said that it was the ges
ture that saved her life," Gelpi said.
"Higginson got a number of respons
es from fledgling poets, but he didn't
know what he was getting with Dick
inson."
Dickinson and Higginson com
municated via letters until her death
in 1886, meeting face-to-face only
twice.
"Amy Freed took this connection
and correspondence between them
and used that as a sort of narrative
thread to construct the play," Gelpi
said.
Freed. Gelpi and Obenzinger held
a panel following the show. The late
Stanford English professor Diane
Middlebrook was slated to be anoth
er panelist, and last night's perform
ance was dedicated to her memory.
To continue the celebration of
Dickinson's work, Giovacchini is
producing a musical celebration with
more 19th century instruments on
Feb. 13 at Campbell Auditorium. For
the third part of the series. Freed will
direct another play entitled "The
Ghoul of Amherst." which gives a
gothic, comic look at the 19th century
obsession with death. It will be held
on Mar. 12 at the Roble Studio The
ater.
