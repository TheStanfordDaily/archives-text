# Mitch Johnson
## What's the Point for Cardinal? 
### BY PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
They say going away can help you find yourself.
For coach Trent Johnson, a trip to Europe
meant finding his point guard rotation. After a
disappointing end to a promising season last
year. Stanford entered the summer with ques
tion marks at the "one."
Anthony Goods and Fred Washington, when healthy,
were last year's starting guards — but neither was a nat
ural ball handler. Mitch Johnson had the right skills, but
ended the season in a slump. And Drew Shiller, a trans

Then, in August, the Cardinal went overseas for a 12-
day,six-game tour in Italy.There, Trent Johnson said, his
questions were answered.
Mitch Johnson, the once-timid, mistake-prone point
guard, was now making crisp passes and running the
team with confidence. Johnson played so well that he
didn't just earn the starting nod — the junior was
named a co-captain as well, a testament to the hard work
he put in to improve his game and his leadership in the
locker room.
"1 don't know if Mitch Johnson has ever not had con

what's coming to him and making good decisions."
Tonight's game against Washington is a homecoming
for the younger Johnson, a Seattle native. Stanford is 0-
2 against the 1 luskies in Seattle during his two years on
the Farm, but Mitch and his teammates are currently
playing what seems like their best basketball over that
span.
Stanford's No. 14 ranking is its highest in-season
mark since 2004, and its point guard is posting improved
averages in points, rebounds and assists. Against Cal last
Saturday, Johnson scored a career high 16 points, adding
seven assists and five rebounds.
His coach, however, likes the intangibles. Last year's
mistakes, more often than not, are things of the past.
"Sometimes putting the ball on the floor and attack
ing the baseline when there's two bins in there, trying to
