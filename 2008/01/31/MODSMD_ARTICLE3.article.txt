# Mitch Johnson
## What's the Point for Cardinal? 
### BY PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
They say going away can help you find yourself.
For coach Trent Johnson, a trip to Europe
meant finding his point guard rotation. After a
disappointing end to a promising season last
year. Stanford entered the summer with ques
tion marks at the "one."
Anthony Goods and Fred Washington, when healthy,
were last year's starting guards — but neither was a nat
ural ball handler. Mitch Johnson had the right skills, but
ended the season in a slump. And Drew Shiller, a trans
fer from the University of San Francisco, was an un
known.
Then, in August, the Cardinal went overseas for a 12-
day,six-game tour in Italy.There, Trent Johnson said, his
questions were answered.
Mitch Johnson, the once-timid, mistake-prone point
guard, was now making crisp passes and running the
team with confidence. Johnson played so well that he
didn't just earn the starting nod — the junior was
named a co-captain as well, a testament to the hard work
he put in to improve his game and his leadership in the
locker room.
"1 don't know if Mitch Johnson has ever not had con
fidence," Trent Johnson said Tuesday. "He's taking
what's coming to him and making good decisions."
Tonight's game against Washington is a homecoming
for the younger Johnson, a Seattle native. Stanford is 0-
2 against the 1 luskies in Seattle during his two years on
the Farm, but Mitch and his teammates are currently
playing what seems like their best basketball over that
span.
Stanford's No. 14 ranking is its highest in-season
mark since 2004, and its point guard is posting improved
averages in points, rebounds and assists. Against Cal last
Saturday, Johnson scored a career high 16 points, adding
seven assists and five rebounds.
His coach, however, likes the intangibles. Last year's
mistakes, more often than not, are things of the past.
"Sometimes putting the ball on the floor and attack
ing the baseline when there's two bins in there, trying to
make a play,"Trent Johnson said, ex
plaining how his point guard was too
aggressive at times last year.
"Those are all good things," he
added. "That's what competitive
guys try to do."
While he may be competitive.

Mitch Johnson has matured. His
coach said they "didn't talk much"
about last year's struggles, but the
then-sophomore took the cuts in
playing time in stride.
"I le likes winning."Trent Johnson
said. "But it's understanding what's

best for the team That's hard this
day and age for players to be like
that."
Mitch Johnson's improvements
have also made his team better. I le is
hitting his shots (at a career-high .450
field goal percentage) and punishing
opponents when they sag off him de
fensively. I le has also been making
better entry passes into the post of
late, helping contribute to Brook
Lopez's recent offensive explosion.
Lopez was hampered by foul
trouble in the first half last week
against Cal, but the team went early
and often to him down low in the sec
ond. The sophomore big man re
sponded by scoring 23 points, helping
lead the Card to an 82-77 road win.
"We did a good job of getting out
of the double team." Mitch said after
Saturday's win. "I got into a good
rhythm, and we did a good job of
moving the ball around."
While his minutes have been up
and down this season, Shiller, too,
was productive against the Golden
Bears. Mis six points were his highest
total since Nov. 17, coming on a pair
of particularly well-timed three
pointers.
"When he shoots the ball and is
ready to play, no question." Trent
Johnson said of Shiller's boosted
playing time Saturday. "One of the
things that's important, and these
guys all understand, is staying ready."
The coach, as always, will alter
lineups and adjust to match-ups
throughout the season. But the
guards — Mitch Johnson at the
point. Anthony Goods at the shoot
ing guard — have been the only con
sistent starters all year.
Shiller remains a question mark.
I le can be a prolific scorer (he led the
team in Stanford's first two games),
but has struggled defensively at
times, especially against smaller
guards like Cal's Jerome Randle.
Learning the point guard role, es
pecially with a new team, takes time,
his coach emphasized.
"He's getting better,"Trent John
son said. "To his credit, he's done a
heck of a job coming out every day
and working [on his game]."
If Shiller's work sees the same im
provements as Johnson's. Stanford's
point guard spot will be in good
hands for years to come.

The Cardinal's Mitch Johnson has raised his level of piay at the point this sea
son to help take some focus off of Stanford's stellar frontcourt. Johnson's in
creased accuracy from the floor has helped him to punish opponents who
focus too much on the towering presence of the Lopez twins down low.
