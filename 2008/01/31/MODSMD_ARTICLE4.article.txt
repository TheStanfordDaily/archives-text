Wiggins
made her
H highly-an
ticipated first appearance in a Stanford
uniform. Now, three and a half seasons
later, the senior guard is poised to claim
the Cardinal's career scoring record —
besting the legendary Kate Starbird '97 in
the process. Wiggins, who has 2,204 career
points, needs just 11 to tie and 12 to break
Starbird's record of 2.215.
"She is a great person to have the
scoring record, because she is so un
selfish." coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"She scores, but she creates for other
people, she works hard at the defensive
end. she rebounds, and she's a great team
leader."
Wiggins is in fact only 22 rebounds
away from cracking Stanford's all-time
top-20 list in that category, as well.
Much of the Cardinal record book is
near or already within Wiggins' grasp.
Earlier this season, her 211 th three
pointer and 550 th three-point attempt
put her at the top of both of those cate-

gories. With 475 career free throws,
she is only seven away from the top
spot. And her 243 steals puts her

fifth all time, 37 behind the record
holder, with half of the regular season
and the postseason remaining.

I lere is a snapshot of Candice Wig
gins' superlative-laden career so far:
— 11/19/04: Hits a three-pointer less
than a minute into her Cardinal debut
against Utah for her first collegiate

basket. Wiggins led all scorers with 24
points in Stanford's 63-57 victory.
— 3/5/05: Becomes the first freshman
ever to win the Pac-10 Player of the Year
and the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
awards.
— 3/29/05: Hnds the year with 19 points
and eight rebounds (both team highs) in
an Elite Eight loss to Michigan State, 76-
69. Her 612 points on the season are a
Stanford freshman record.
— 1/7/06: Scores 37 points at Oregon,
her highest single-game total and the
fifth-best in Stanford history.
— 1/29/06: Eighteen points in a 78-69
victory over USC brings Wiggins over
the I.(XM) career points threshold in just
54 games, the second-fastest pace in
Stanford history.
3/2/06: Repeats as Pac-10 Player
of the Year. Wiggins is one of only five
players in league history to win haek
to-hack Player of the Year awards.
— 3/27/06: Another season ends in

the Elite l ight, this time against
Wiggins' average of 21.8 points per
game for the season is the best in
school history, besting a 27-year-old
record.

ment MVP trophy while leading the
Cardinal to a second conference tour
nament title in three years.
