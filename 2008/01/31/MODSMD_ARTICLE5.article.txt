Jeanette Pohlen and her Stanford

teammates will look to exact a meas
ure of revenge against USC tonight
after a loss in Los Angeles previously
this season.

Despite owning a five-game winning streak, the Stanford
\ women's basketball team has a pair of games still hanging over
its collective head. In its only back-to-back losses of the season.

the Cardinal dropped away games to UCLA and USC on the
first weekend of the New Year. Tonight. No. 7 Stanford (17-3.7-
2 Pac-l())gets its first shot at revenge, when it hosts the Women
of Troy (13-7.6-3 Pac-10) at 7 p.m.

Stanford has yet to lose at Maples Pavilion this season and
is ready to kick off the second half of its Pac-10 schedule with
a statement win. As a result of those losses in Los Angeles

four weeks ago. the Cardinal fell behind in the race for the
conference championship. However, the team has since to

within one game of conference-leading No. 8 California,
aided by a convincing 72-52 win over the Golden Bears last
Saturday.

Freshman Kayla Pedersen said that the team re
mains cautiously optimistic about their conference stand
ings.

"We are taking each game one at a time and not
looking ahead because every game counts for the PAC
-10 title." she said.

In the last meeting between the Cardinal and the
Trojans, the teams stayed close throughout the game;
neither squad led by more than six points. Despite hold
ing a 71-66 lead with 2:11 left, the Cardinal fell to the
Trojans in a tight 73-72 contest. Normally reliable sen
ior guard Candice Wiggins had a tough day from the
field, going only 5-for-15 from the floor.

2/2 Stanford, Calif.
NOTES: The No. 7 Cardinal women will gel
their first shot at revenge this weekend against
a pair of Los Angeles opponents which swept
Stanford earlier this season. Since Stanford's
back-to-back losses at USC and UCLA, the
Cardinal have been a perfect 5-0. Stanford's
women have not been swept in a season by
the Women of Troy since the 198687 season

Pedersen attributed the Women of Troy's success in
the first meeting to their production from long range.
"For [our last encounter with] USC, I think that they
hit a lot threes and that really hur* us," Pedersen recalled.
Luckily, the gritty senior has since bounced back,
adding at least 18 points in each of the Cardinal's last four
games. Overall, Wiggins averages 18.1 points per game
this season and she now sits within 11 points of Stan
ford's career scoring record, a mark she is expected to
pass tonight.
The Women of Troy are coming off of a sweep of the
Oregon schools, and the Cardinal bigs will have to find
an answer for junior Nadia Parker, who leads the team
with 11.4 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.
Sophomore center Jayne Appel and freshman for
ward Kayla Pedersen, who together average more than
27 points a game, will look to handle USC double teams
with the same ease they had against Cal, dominating the
boards and finding open teammates for the kick out.
With the help of sophomore guard J.J. Hones, who
scored 12 points from behind the arc against the Gold
en Bears. Stanford hit nine three-pointers and the Car
dinal will look to continue that success from three point
range.
1 lones and the backcourt will also be responsible for
1 lailey Dunham, who netted eight points and eight re
bounds in the Trojans' comeback win over Oregon last
week. She and redshirt junior Brynn Cameron, a long
range specialist, will offer additional options for USC.
Pedersen, though, noted that the key to Stanford's
success in the Cal match up was a tough mental attitude.
ITie team will focus on mimicking those positives, in
stead of dwelling on the problems in the Los Angeles
defeats.
"We hope to take away [USC's] strengths and capi
talize on ours," she said. "If we play our game and take
the mentality we had against Cal into these next games,
I am confident that we will have a positive outcome."
With a lot at stake for both teams in terms of confer
ence standings, the Maples Pavilion crowd should heat
up quickly. Stanford's earlier leave no room for error,
and the Cardinal knows it simply can not afford to let
another opportunity slip by.
"1 believe that our team is very motivated for this
next game especially because we feel like we have more
to prove after those losses," Pedersen said. "This game is
our second chance and we don't want to disappoint espe
cially when we are at home."
