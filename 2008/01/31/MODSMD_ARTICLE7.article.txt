## Hoover debate spans decades Univ. still Questions relations with think tank 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the remaining Republican presidential can
didates debated at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in Southern California last night, some at
Stanford may have pondered,"What if?"
The debate, the second to be held at the library
this campaign cycle, has brought the national spot
light to Simi Valley, Calif., a quiet city of 119.000 res
idents in the hills three miles north of Los Angeles.
City officials say the debates have brought positive
publicity and have been an economic boon to the
community.
All of which could have just as easily been at
Stanford.
In 1984. the University's Board of Trustees ap
proved plans to construct a presidential library hon
oring Reagan on campus. A subsequent revolt by
liberal-minded students and faculty effectively de
railed the plans, and the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Foundation moved on.
More than 20 years later, the campus has revisit
ed the Reagan debate as the relationship between
Stanford and the conservative-leaning Hoover In
stitution has been again called into question. Ques
tions regarding campus politics,partisanship and ac
ademic freedom remain unanswered â€” as does
"what could have been."
The great debate
For the Reagan Foundation. Stanford was a nat
ural fit for the 40th president's legacy. As Governor
of California. Reagan cultivated a strong relation
ship with the 1 loover Institution, eventually donat
ing his gubernatorial papers to Hoover and receiv
ing an honorary fellowship. After winning the pres
idential election in 1980, dozens of Hover fellows,
including Milton Friedman. George Schultz. Con
doleezza Rice and current Hoover President John
Raisian. went to work for the Reagan administra
tion.
Plans to include a public policy center under
H(X)ver's auspices, along with a presidential library
and museum, created an ideological backlash; over

84 faculty members and 1,500 students demanded
an inquiry into the relationship between Hoover
and Stanford. After vociferous protest from several
student groups and the Faculty Senate, in 1985 the
University Board of Trustees approved plans to
construct the library and museum in the foothills
overlooking campus, but rebuffed the plan for an
accompanying policy center.
"You have to remember, this is in the context of
a very liberal university,more liberal than it is now,"
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Diamond said. "There
was that feeling of resentment [that Reagan had
won in 1980]."
After three years of controversy and debate, the
Reagan Foundation withdrew its proposal and an
nounced in April 1987 that it would seek an alter
nate location, eventually settling on Simi Valley, in
the hills where a young Reagan used to ride horses.
"We were proceeding diligently and on schedule
with our plans for the library and we are naturally
disappointed with the decision," then-University
President Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President Warren Christopher said in a statement at
the time. "While we regret the decision, we certain
ly wish them every success."
Stanford was not the only university to struggle
with plans for a presidential library.'Traffic concerns
led Cambridge, Mass., to reject plans for a Kennedy
Library at Harvard, while Duke University elected
not to build a library in honor of law school alum
Richard Nixon.
Reagan advisor and 1 loover Senior Fellow Mar
tin Anderson said that logistical factors similar to
those at Harvard played a role in Stanford's opposi
tion. University officials at the time expressed con
cern that the 20-acre site in the foothills behind cam
pus would have become more of a tourist attraction
than an academic resource, and the Faculty Senate
voted three weeks before the Foundation's an
nouncement to scale back the facility or move it far
ther from campus.
"At first glance it looks like it was totally because
of politics," Anderson said. "I'm not so sure it was."
