## Hoover debate spans decades Univ. still Questions relations with think tank 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the remaining Republican presidential can
didates debated at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library in Southern California last night, some at
Stanford may have pondered,"What if?"
The debate, the second to be held at the library
this campaign cycle, has brought the national spot
light to Simi Valley, Calif., a quiet city of 119.000 res
idents in the hills three miles north of Los Angeles.
City officials say the debates have brought positive
publicity and have been an economic boon to the
community.
All of which could have just as easily been at
Stanford.
In 1984. the University's Board of Trustees ap
proved plans to construct a presidential library hon
oring Reagan on campus. A subsequent revolt by
liberal-minded students and faculty effectively de
railed the plans, and the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Foundation moved on.
More than 20 years later, the campus has revisit
ed the Reagan debate as the relationship between
Stanford and the conservative-leaning Hoover In
stitution has been again called into question. Ques
tions regarding campus politics,partisanship and ac
ademic freedom remain unanswered — as does
"what could have been."
The great debate
For the Reagan Foundation. Stanford was a nat
ural fit for the 40th president's legacy. As Governor
of California. Reagan cultivated a strong relation
ship with the 1 loover Institution, eventually donat
ing his gubernatorial papers to Hoover and receiv
ing an honorary fellowship. After winning the pres
idential election in 1980, dozens of Hover fellows,
including Milton Friedman. George Schultz. Con
doleezza Rice and current Hoover President John
Raisian. went to work for the Reagan administra
tion.
Plans to include a public policy center under
H(X)ver's auspices, along with a presidential library
and museum, created an ideological backlash; over

84 faculty members and 1,500 students demanded
an inquiry into the relationship between Hoover
and Stanford. After vociferous protest from several
student groups and the Faculty Senate, in 1985 the
University Board of Trustees approved plans to
construct the library and museum in the foothills
overlooking campus, but rebuffed the plan for an
accompanying policy center.
"You have to remember, this is in the context of
a very liberal university,more liberal than it is now,"
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Diamond said. "There
was that feeling of resentment [that Reagan had
won in 1980]."
After three years of controversy and debate, the
Reagan Foundation withdrew its proposal and an
nounced in April 1987 that it would seek an alter
nate location, eventually settling on Simi Valley, in
the hills where a young Reagan used to ride horses.
"We were proceeding diligently and on schedule
with our plans for the library and we are naturally
disappointed with the decision," then-University
President Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President Warren Christopher said in a statement at
the time. "While we regret the decision, we certain
ly wish them every success."
Stanford was not the only university to struggle
with plans for a presidential library.'Traffic concerns
led Cambridge, Mass., to reject plans for a Kennedy
Library at Harvard, while Duke University elected
not to build a library in honor of law school alum
Richard Nixon.
Reagan advisor and 1 loover Senior Fellow Mar
tin Anderson said that logistical factors similar to
those at Harvard played a role in Stanford's opposi
tion. University officials at the time expressed con
cern that the 20-acre site in the foothills behind cam
pus would have become more of a tourist attraction
than an academic resource, and the Faculty Senate
voted three weeks before the Foundation's an
nouncement to scale back the facility or move it far
ther from campus.
"At first glance it looks like it was totally because
of politics," Anderson said. "I'm not so sure it was."
Missed opportunities
Simi Valley officials say the library
has been an economic and publicity
boon for their community.
"It created a lot of nationwide in
terest last time, and it was just good
publicity for our city," Simi Valley
Mayor Paul Miller told the Simi Valley
Acorn last week.
Leigh Nixon, president of the Simi
Valley chamber of commerce, told The
Daily in a phone interview that the li
brary created a "trickle-down infusion
to the economy" by increasing tourism
and benefiting restaurants,gas stations
and hotels.
"We all recognize that we have a
jewel here," Nixon said. "There's been
no disruption. We're glad to have
them."
For some, Simi Valley's gain has
been Stanford's loss. John H. Bunzel, a
former president of San Jose State
University and a senior research fel
low at Hoover,said the primary source

documents at the library would have
been invaluable for scholars and re
searchers, regardless of political ideol
ogy-
"lf you could have, as we do, the
best archival materials about Hitler
and Stalin, why can't we have a library
with materials from Reagan?" Bunzel
asked.
Current controversy
Twenty years after the fact, the
legacy of the Reagan Library debate
lives on. The fundamental questions
raised by the controversy — campus
partisanship and the relationship be
tween Stanford University and the
Hoover Institution — bubbled back
to the surface last fall when it was an
nounced that former Secretary of De
fense Donald Rumsfeld would join
the Hoover Institution as a distin
guished visiting fellow.
Like the controversy two decades
before, students and faculty called for
the University to formally sever ties
with the Institution. Also like the pre
vious debate, neither Stanford nor
Hoover budged.
But protagonists of the 1980s de
bates said the scale of the recent
Rumsfeld controversy comes

nowhere close to that of the Reagan
Library. The campus was much more
polarized then, and the student ac
tivism much more prolific.
"The current debate is silly, the
other stuff was realAnderson said.
"If you were a Republican and sup
ported [conservative] ideas, they
would try to get rid of you. They
weren't successful, but they'd still try."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, an
outspoken opponent to Hoover dur
ing many of the controversies of the
1980s, agreed with his conservative
counterpart.
"The Reagan Library debate was
much more intense," he said. "The stu
dents were much more involved then."
That's where the agreement ended,
however. For his part, Rebholz said the
library and policy center would have
gone too far in politicizing the campus.
He expressed no regret at the poten
tial scholarship opportunities missed
by the library's absence.
"We were spared that horrible situ
ation," he said, "of having Hoover
Tower at one side of the campus, and
the Reagan center on the other."
