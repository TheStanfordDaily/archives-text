## Professors praise Obama Advisors illuminate their role in the campaign 
### MELODY DYE 
Students and community members
came out en masse last night for the "Fac
ulty for Obama" forum held at Toyon
Lounge. The talk featured candid policy
discussions and a question and answer ses
sion with four presidential campaign advi
sors to Senator Barack Obama (D-IL).
The speakers included Law Profs. Mar
iano-Florentino Cuellar, Larry Marshall
and William Gould, as well as Education

Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond.The event
— hosted by Debashish Bakshi '08, head
of the Stanford chapter of Students for
Barack Obama — drew some one hun
dred fifty prospective voters, filling seats
almost to capacity.
The night was one of both impassioned
political advocacy and thoughtful dia
logue. as the four academics highlighted
their involvement in the campaign and
sought to distinguish Obama from his rival
for the Democratic nomination. Senator
Hillary Clinton (D-NY). While all four
professors gave specific examples of how
the senators differ on critical issues, they
often harked back to differences in philos
ophy and vision that, they said, were fun

damental to the choice between the candi
dates.
Marshall, a national advocate for re
form of the criminal justice system, re
counted his own experience working with
Obama in Illinois in 2()01. It was a time, he
said, when the long history of brutality and
racism in the Chicago Police Department
had created a crisis of inaction in the state
legislature. Transformation of the justice
system, it seemed, would not come
through political avenues. But Obama
changed that, Marshall said, by forming
coalitions of people from across the politi
cal spectrum.

Law Prof. Larry Marshall (right) speaks alongside fellow Obama advisors in the Toyon lounge last night. The professors discussed
their reasons for supporting the Democratic presidential candidate and addressed student questions regarding his platform.
"What we're talking about here
with Senator Obama is an entirely
different framework for what civility
is in political discourse," Marshall
said."We're talking about fundamen
tal structural change; there's some
thing different, there's something
deep.
Cuellar. a veteran of the Clinton
administration and a long-time
Obama supporter, echoed Marshall's
sentiments, declaring that this is the
most important election with which
he has ever been involved. Cuellar.
who advises Obama on immigration
reform, criminal justice and foreign
policy lauded Obama's courage in
addressing racial disparities in the
criminal justice system and praised

his principled stance on multi-lateral
ism. Obama. he said, was a man of
moral conviction and integrity, nei
ther swayed by the "political winds"
nor immune to compromise.
Darling-} lammond gave a broad
outline of Obama's platform for com
prehensive education reform, citing
his "equalize and invest" approach,
emphasis on accountability and career
ladder incentive program. She said
that Obama's strategy mirrored pro
grams in other academically successful
nations and would do much to address
educational inequities— in a country
where ten times more is spent per stu
dent in the suburbs of Scarsdale than
in the rural districts of Mississippi.
Gould, a professor emeritus who
has previously campaigned for John
F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Bill
Clinton, said he believes Obama's
campaign to be of similar historical
significance. Gould said he was at
tracted to Obama's positions on a

broad array of issues, including labor
reform, social security, regional trade
and taxation. What appealed to him
most, however, was Obama's drive to
"overcome divisiveness on the basis
of class and race, and to get us to work
together as a country."
An extended question and answer
session followed the forum, with stu
dents inquiring on a range of issues,
from the specifics of Obama's view of
medicinal marijuana raids — he is
opposed to them — to his position on
the teaching of evolution in public
schools, which he supports.
As the forum closed, supporters
stood fit the end of the hall, distribut
ing pledge cards in support of
Obama.
"At what point," demanded Mar
shall, "do we start voting our
dreams?"
