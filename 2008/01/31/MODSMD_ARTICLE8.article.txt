## Professors praise Obama Advisors illuminate their role in the campaign 
### MELODY DYE 
Students and community members
came out en masse last night for the "Fac
ulty for Obama" forum held at Toyon
Lounge. The talk featured candid policy
discussions and a question and answer ses
sion with four presidential campaign advi
sors to Senator Barack Obama (D-IL).
The speakers included Law Profs. Mar
iano-Florentino Cuellar, Larry Marshall
and William Gould, as well as Education

Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond.The event
— hosted by Debashish Bakshi '08, head
of the Stanford chapter of Students for
Barack Obama — drew some one hun
dred fifty prospective voters, filling seats
almost to capacity.
The night was one of both impassioned
political advocacy and thoughtful dia
logue. as the four academics highlighted
their involvement in the campaign and
sought to distinguish Obama from his rival
for the Democratic nomination. Senator
Hillary Clinton (D-NY). While all four
professors gave specific examples of how
the senators differ on critical issues, they
often harked back to differences in philos
ophy and vision that, they said, were fun

damental to the choice between the candi
dates.
Marshall, a national advocate for re
form of the criminal justice system, re
counted his own experience working with
Obama in Illinois in 2()01. It was a time, he
said, when the long history of brutality and
racism in the Chicago Police Department
had created a crisis of inaction in the state
legislature. Transformation of the justice
system, it seemed, would not come
through political avenues. But Obama
changed that, Marshall said, by forming
coalitions of people from across the politi
cal spectrum.
