## Application statistics examined Over 2.000 incomplete apps. not counted in tally 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission's
recent adoption of the Common Application
has created a gap of more than 2,(HX) applica
tions in the University's final count for the
Class of 2012. These "incomplete" applica
tions. which would have contributed to the
count last year.are not considered in this year's
tally.
To become an applicant for admission in
autumn 2008, students were required to sub
mit both the Common Application and the
Stanford supplement. According to Director
of Admission Shawn Abbott, incomplete ap
plications are those that do not include either
the Common Application portion or the sup
plement.
"Our agreement with the Common Appli
cation Web site necessitates that a student
must successfully submit [both parts of the ap
plication] before the Common Application
will send us a student's file." Abbott said in an
email to The Daily. "We count only those stu
dents [whom] the Common Application sends
us as applicants."
In previous years thousands of students
would complete only one part of the applica
tion. then be accepted elsewhere or lose inter
est in Stanford. Since they were considered ap
plicants, such students made for inaccurate ap
plication tallies.
That has changed.
"With the Common Application, we now
have a far more accurate sense of our true ap
plication number," Abbott said.
That number currently stands at 24,810 â€”
a 3.6 percent increase from last year. Had the
University counted the 2.000 incomplete ap
plications. its application numbers would have
been boosted by approximately 11.9 percent.
Other universities use different methods to
count applications, but those that rely on the
Common Application, such as Harvard and
Yale, receive counts based solely on complet-
ed applications.
Stanford's 3.6 percent increase in
applications from last year pales in
comparison to some of its peer institu
tions, like Harvard, which experienced
a 1 l ) percent increase, and Princeton,
whose applications rose six percent.
In a Jan. 28 letter to the editor in
Ihe New York Times, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. "82 attributed the
spike in applications at institutions like
Harvard and Princeton to these
schools' elimination of their early ad
mission programs.
"With these early admission pro
grams gone, we can expect between
20,(XX) and 25,(XX) new applications

"We. now have a far
more accurate sense
of our true application
number'
'
flooding admissions offices of colleges
and universities around the country,"
Etchemendy wrote. "Ending early ad
mission programs increases the level
of frenzy in the application process."
Admissions officials have also said
that recent improvements in financial
aid at top universities are attracting in
creasing numbers of applicants. I lar
vard. Princeton. Yale, Columbia, the

University of Pennsylvania. Dart
mouth and Duke represent a handful
of institutions that have revised their
aid programs to benefit lower- and
middle-class families.
The Stanford Board of Trustees,
which controls changes in aid policy,
will be going into its mid-February
meeting facing increased pressure not
only from competing universities, hut
also from Washington. Congress is cur
rently considering whether colleges
and universities should be required to
spend a minimum amount of their en
dowments on student aid.
Stanford Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper said the University is
expected to announce further finan
cial aid initiatives by the end of winter
quarter.
