## Application statistics examined Over 2.000 incomplete apps. not counted in tally 
### DEVIN BANERJEE STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission's
recent adoption of the Common Application
has created a gap of more than 2,(HX) applica
tions in the University's final count for the
Class of 2012. These "incomplete" applica
tions. which would have contributed to the
count last year.are not considered in this year's
tally.
To become an applicant for admission in
autumn 2008, students were required to sub
mit both the Common Application and the
Stanford supplement. According to Director
of Admission Shawn Abbott, incomplete ap
plications are those that do not include either
the Common Application portion or the sup
plement.
"Our agreement with the Common Appli
cation Web site necessitates that a student
must successfully submit [both parts of the ap
plication] before the Common Application
will send us a student's file." Abbott said in an
email to The Daily. "We count only those stu
dents [whom] the Common Application sends
us as applicants."
In previous years thousands of students
would complete only one part of the applica
tion. then be accepted elsewhere or lose inter
est in Stanford. Since they were considered ap
plicants, such students made for inaccurate ap
plication tallies.
That has changed.
"With the Common Application, we now
have a far more accurate sense of our true ap
plication number," Abbott said.
That number currently stands at 24,810 â€”
a 3.6 percent increase from last year. Had the
University counted the 2.000 incomplete ap
plications. its application numbers would have
been boosted by approximately 11.9 percent.
Other universities use different methods to
count applications, but those that rely on the
Common Application, such as Harvard and
Yale, receive counts based solely on complet-
