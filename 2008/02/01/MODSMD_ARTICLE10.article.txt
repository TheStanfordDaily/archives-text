## Campus group helps students move beyond the looking glass 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
The perfectionism that
unites Stanford students
comes with its fair share of
adverse consequences,
among them a high fre
quency of eating disorders. It was in
an effort to address this issue of body
image that MIRROR was estab
lished.
"The overachieving nature of stu
dents at Stanford is a major contribu
tor towards a higher frequency of dis
ordered eating habits," said Daisy
Morin '09, coordinator of MIRROR.
"MIRROR is Stanford's resource for
this issue that is so easy to talk about
in abstract but so difficult to approach
practically when faced by it oneself or
through one's friends."
MIRROR, which was founded in
the spring of 2003, was the brainchild
of a Peer Health Educator (PHE) in a
freshman dorm. She noticed the si
lence surrounding disordered eating
at Stanford and realized that it was an
issue that needed to be addressed.
"[Our PHE] had become ex
tremely distressed by the lack of at
tention around the issue of healthy
eating at Stanford," said Emily Pelta
son "07. former coordinator of MIR
ROR and resident of the PHE's
dorm. "So she brought her dorm's
peer counseling skills to bear on the
problem and approached [ The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center] for
help"
Since then, MIRROR has been
using its resources to pursue its
"breaking-the-silence" mission.
Counselors organize workshops in
freshman dorms and with student

groups as per request, as well as
personal sessions with Resident i
Assistants, individuals and groups I
of friends. '
"The idea was to help break the
silence in all ways, including partici
pation in National Eating Disorders
Week and work with Vaden," Pelta
son said. "Our primary aim. however,
remained intervention coaching' by
putting up workshops as well as by
doing one-on-one consultations to

address the issue."
"We're afraid to make the
judgment, to anger a friend, to
become involved even though
we all know it is a major prob-

lem," she continued. "But si
lence is just another way to
condone a highly destruc
tive behavior: people
must realize that when I

they are silent, their
friend is more able to
persist in his or her
disease."

Orla Belserene '10,
a counselor for MIRROR.

reiterated the importance of tak
ing these steps to promote awareness.
"Eating disorders are one of the
more talked about and concerning is
sues on campus but. ironically, one of
the least addressed issues." she said.
"It is therefore important for groups
like MIRROR to take concrete ac
tion in this sphere and help ease the
fear and discomfort associated with
approaching for help."
"When you are exposed first-hand
to girls crying during disordered eat
ing workshops." Belserene contin
ued, "you realize how much you took
