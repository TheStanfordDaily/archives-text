# Taking it "To the Streets"
## Student documentary explores child labor in the developing world 
### GEA KANG 
A
n Ecuadorian hoy, around eight years old. dons a worn
If Mpink baseball cap and sucks on a lollipop as he bounces
over to the Plaza Grande. One moment he and his cousin are run
ning around giggling and playing with a puppy; the next, they're
hunched over a pair of shoes with polish in hand. All to earn
maybe 25 cents per shoe — or none, if the customer decides not
to pay. What's going on?
This is what Ben I lenretig *08 seeks to address in his current
project,"A Las Calles" (To the Streets).The documentary aims to
"shed light on the realities of child labor in the developing world."
according to Henretig.
"It was important for me to move beyond just showing chil
dren working in the streets and to really try to pull back the cur
tains to explore the underlying currents." Henretig said. "1 also
want to tease out the nuances about things we don't really appre
ciate from the first world,such as the fact that a lot of the kids want
to be working in the streets. We don't have a sense of what it's like
to live in complete and utter poverty with no real light at the end

of the tunnel and how that forces children to grow up premature
ly."
Shot in Ecuador over two months, the final product will run 60
minutes and focus on three families linked together by Casa de La
Ninez. a children's shelter in Quito, Ecuador's capital, and the
people who are working to help them.The characters include 11 -
year-old Belen — the daughter of an alcoholic mother and drug
addict stepfather — and Don Jose, a hardworking 67-year-old
"cargador," or porter, whose children must work to supplement
his income.
Henretig received funding from Volunteers in Latin America
(VILA), a campus organization with which he became involved
last year.
"I'm very interested in film that has a strong sense of ethos and
social and political engagement," Henretig said." I always wanted
to travel to South America and although I initially knew little
about the issue, after doing some research I found that there
weren't many films that explore the topic. And I love working
with children, so it seemed like the perfect subject."
After arriving in Ecuador last June. I ienretig spent his first few
weeks revising and translating his outline into Spanish and there

maining two months in intense production.
"I found out quite quickly that it was a much more difficult
project to make progress on than 1 had imagined." I lenretig said.
"What should my relationship be with the organizations? Who
should 1 talk to? I was fluent in Spanish, but 1 didn't have that
diplomatic Spanish that would unlock doors."
Luckily. Henretig found a producing partner in Ruben
Martinez, a filmmaker in Ecuador. I lenretig also worked closely
with Casa. which had ties to the personalities he was looking to
film.
"People were very wary that they were going to be exploited
in some way — that was the first line of defense," 1 lenretig said.
"But after 1 gained their respect and confidence that I was there
to tell their stories and not just snap tourist photos, they were so
tremendously helpful."
For instance, families allowed I lenretig to film in their homes.
"I got some really compelling testimony from the whole fami
ly there in that miniscule one-room house, with [Belen's] mother
in tears speaking honestly about the difficulties in her life, while

the father was passed
out on the bed through
out the whole inter
view," Henretig said.
Back at Stanford,
Henretig had initially
hoped to complete
enough editing by
spring quarter for an on
campus screening, "not
only to feature the work
but also to serve as a
launching pad for con
versation around
human rights and chil
dren's health."
Attempting to edit a

documentary as a full
time student, however, is no easy task.The material involves over
50 hours of footage — all either in Spanish or a dialect with ele
ments of Quechua and Spanish. As a result. Henretig has been
forced to push back his timeline.

"We don't have a sense of
what it's like to live in
complete and utter poverty."

So far, Henretig has digitized all
50 hours onto his computer.
Transcriptions, which take three to
four hours per hour of tape, are also
underway.
Henretig's primary goal for this
year is to prepare for more concen
trated work on the film — which he
calls his capstone project for his time
at Stanford — after graduation.
Upon its completion, Henretig plans
to show it at Stanford and seek other
distribution channels, including film

festivals.
All the while, Henretig remains
optimistic about the film's potential
to mobilize communities.
"A lot of the film is kind of diffi
cult to watch and heart-wrenching in
some sense," he said. "But l think it's
really redemptive to see so many
people within the film working pas
sionately to find a solution — giving
their lives to and making their lives
from service. And l hope that's cat
alyzing."

"We don't have a sense of
what it's like to live in
complete and utter poverty."

So far, Henretig has digitized all
50 hours onto his computer.
Transcriptions, which take three to
four hours per hour of tape, are also
underway.
Henretig's primary goal for this
year is to prepare for more concen
trated work on the film — which he
calls his capstone project for his time
at Stanford — after graduation.
Upon its completion, Henretig plans
to show it at Stanford and seek other
distribution channels, including film

festivals.
All the while, Henretig remains
optimistic about the film's potential
to mobilize communities.
"A lot of the film is kind of diffi
cult to watch and heart-wrenching in
some sense," he said. "But l think it's
really redemptive to see so many
people within the film working pas
sionately to find a solution — giving
their lives to and making their lives
from service. And l hope that's cat
alyzing."
