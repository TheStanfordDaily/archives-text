## Fadl addresses Islamic reform 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The word "jihad" can cause
uneasy feelings in America, but
Muslim student groups on campus
are aiming to reclaim the word's
meaning of "struggle" in a speaker
series called "Jihad to Reform."
UCLA Law Prof. Abou El Fadl
kicked off the talks last night in
Cubberley Auditorium with a dis
cussion about the history of intoler
ance of and from Muslims and the
present-day imperatives for change.
"Jihad to Reform" is a dual effort
of the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and the Islamic
Society of Stanford University
(ISSU). Through speakers focusing
on four separate contentious issues,
student organizers hope to bring
about dialogue concerning numer
ous problems confronting contem
porary Islam, including instances
and misperceptions about intoler
ance, terrorism, Shari'ah law and
patriarchy.
In last night's talk entitled
"Towards Coexistence: Wrestling
Islam from Intolerance," Fadl
emphasized the complexities of the
problems faced in the faith.
"The argument for peaceful
coexistence is all well and good, but
it's not sufficient," Fadl said. "Ideas
don't exist in an abstract plane, and
ideas don't simply assert their domi
nance by virtue of the fact that they
exist. Ideas can be wonderful, but. if
they fail to engage in the right way,
they could produce something that
is far from wonderful."
"We have to stand back and
unpack the very notion of toler
ance," he said.
Fadl said a problem with claims
that Muslims — or non-Muslims —
are "intolerant" is the complexity
inherent in the term.
"Every time we speak about
reconstruction, one must tread care
fully, especially with a concept such
as tolerance," said Fadl. "What is it
exactly that they are reforming, and
why?"
Fadl focused much of his address
on the hypocrisy of non-Muslim crit
ics regarding the Muslim world,
explaining that he had talked a lot in

the past about the problems of intol
erance from Muslim Puritans.
"If we look at the literature of
Islamophobes, it is remarkable how
often they talk about tolerance and
insistently harp upon the notion that
Muslims are an intolerant people,"
Fadl said. "But one can quite easily
argue that if anyone epitomizes the
notion of intolerance it is the
Islamophobes. Their refusal to
accept the legitimacy of. or to treat
equally, or to love, or to in any way
endorse any level of Islamic authen
ticity is intolerant."
Fadl's address was followed by a
wide-ranging question-and-answer
session, covering everything from
Christian missionaries to the effects
of colonialism on racist attitudes. In
response to one question, Fadl
emphasized the imperative for
Muslim students to take pride in
their heritage.
"It's important for young
Muslims, as they're going to have to
lead this struggle to reform, vis-a-vis
the rest of the world, that you do not
have a defeatist attitude," he said.

"You do not have to feel like you
are carrying a huge guilt trip on your
shoulders. If that happens, you will
not do either Muslims or non-
Muslims a favor."
Kvent organizers were optimistic
about the possibilities of the series
and were pleased with the first talk.
"Often, when you want to con
front issues within your own com
munity, there's a fear of coming off
as un-politically correct, or even
hateful." said Zaid Adhami 10. vice
president of MSAN. "We want to
push people to think critically about
these issues and to rethink a lot of
their assumptions."
But Adhami said that the series
should not be seen as a response to
outside pressure.
"We think it's important that this
be an internal effort." Adhami said.
"This isn't an attempt to appease
Western critics; it's more about
addressing issues critically on our
own terms."
