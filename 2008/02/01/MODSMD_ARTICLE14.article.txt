## EDITOR'S WELCOME 
### 
When I first arrived at Stanford, 1 won
dered what would define the next
four years of my life — which class
es. which activities, which memories would
come to mind when I thought of Stanford in
the years after graduation? In an effort to
find my niche here. 1 took a variety of classes,
made lots of friends and tested the waters of
student groups, including The Daily.
After serving as editor of my high
school's paper, it was only natural for me to
check out Stanford's student newspaper in
the little time I had between dorm activities,
study groups and parties. But while I liked
what 1 saw at The Daily, never did I imagine
that it would come to be my home on cam
pus. the place where 1 would spend more
time than in class — and. this year, even
more time than I spend in my dorm room.
The Daily sucked me in. just as it has done to
so many students before me. Little by little. 1
got more involved — 1 wrote just one more
story per week, spent one more term as a
desk editor. Nothing beat the rush of writing
headlines in the wee hours of the morning,
only to see the fruits of my labor spread
across campus a few hours later. This fall, as
I found myself spending five nights per week
in the office, I knew I was addicted.
At The Daily, we work hard to deliver a
stimulating, informative and fun paper to
our readers each morning, and the paper is
continuously evolving as we strive to create
the best product we can. As we begin Vol
ume 233. I am committed to working with
the entire Daily staff to give you, our read
ers. a high quality paper you can depend on
for breaking news stories, witty opinions
columns and the daily crossword puzzle we
know you love.
Page Two will now be called Features,
providing Page Two's fun stories and daily
calendar, revamped with a splash of creativ
ity. World & Nation will run on Mondays, in
forming the community of important world

events that take place over the weekend.
While our primary goal is to keep readers
up-to-date on campus activity. World & Na
tion will ensure that you are also aware of
the world outside A the Stanford Bubble.
Just as the paper version of The Daily is
constantly evolving, our Web site is always
in motion as well, as we strive to keep up
with the rapidly developing world of online
journalism. We will continue to run weekly
online polls that relate to News and Sports
articles, as we have for the past few weeks,
and soon we will implement online blogs,
adding an extra dimension to the paper for
online readers.
This list of changes to The Daily is by no
means complete. We are always looking for
new input, and I invite all readers to con
tribute their thoughts — through online
comments, letters to the editor or even by
joining the staff. Whether you are interested
in writing, editing, graphics, photography or
layout. The Daily is always recruiting new
staff members. As a freshman or senior, it is
never too late to join.
After three years at Stanford, there is no
doubt in my mind that I will forever associ
ate Stanford with The Daily. For the rest of
this year, the paper will be my top priority,
and I hope that all members of the Stanford
community will read and enjoy — and
maybe even work for — the paper that I
have come to love. Enjoy Volume 233!
Sincerely,
