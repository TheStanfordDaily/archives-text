# Burning Down The House
## The

California, the saying goes, is the land of
fruits and nuts. We're weirdos out here
— devil-may-care oddballs, flower
children, homos. That's why 1 came west for
school. 1 liked the idea of myself as a Cali
fornian. For that matter, it's why people have
always gone west, if you believe the mythol
ogy. Across the ocean, westward the wagons,
over the mountains, to some new Eden.
ITiere's something tragic about the con
cept of a pioneer. What the pioneer makes
can't survive. Blazing a trail, by its very na
ture. invites others to pursue, to fill up the
new space, and then suffocate its original,
idiosyncratic character. Following pioneers
in their wagons are workmen in their trac
tors. like characters in a Joni Mitchell song,
paving paradise.
I've heard that Palo Alto wasn't always
like it is now. Before the Silicon Valley
boom, this was something of a real college
town. In fact, its predecessor, the town of
Mayfield. had earned itself a reputation for
rowdiness with its 13 saloons.The Free Peo
ple's Free Music Company used to play
weekly live performances at Lytton Plaza, at
the top of University Avenue. There was
once an organization called Citizens Against
Legislated Meanness, which advocated for
Palo Alto's homeless.
In other words. Palo Alto used to be a lot
more like Santa Cruz. And while I love the
Internet as much as anyone else,the effect of
the new prosperity has been the transforma
tion of this valley, the hills and forests that
shadow its edges, and the towns that sprawl
across it. into a suburban desert, a dot com
Dust Bowl. The new Silicon Valley hasn't
been without its good sides, of course — the
tech companies have brought an economic
and technological boom and diversity un
dreamed of decades ago.
Head west, past 280 and the Dish, and
halfway to the ocean, up in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, and you arrive at La Honda,
where the ghost of Ken kesey sits, watching
Silicon Valley spread out below. This is
where the myth of the West was adapted to
modern life; with no geographical frontier
left. Kesey and his friends made a new cul
tural West instead.
Kesey was a fellow in Stanford's Stegner
creative writing program, where he wrote
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," a novel
about an insane asylum and. by metaphori
cal extension, about "The Combine" — in
stitutions of authority that use invisible so
cial methods to suppress individuality. A
founding father of American Hippie-ism,
Kesey and his friends, the Merry Pranksters,
spent much of the '60s throwing huge parties
at his place in La Honda. The house band
was the Grateful Dead. who. in their earlier
incarnation as The Warlocks, used to play
high school dances at Paly.
They were an odd bunch. The Merry
Pranksters drove back and forth across the
country in a tie-dyed schoolbus, emblazoned
with the cryptic destination of "Furthur."
Kesey himself,on the run from the law,faked
his own suicide wifh a note that read,
"Ocean. Ocean I'll beat you in the end."
Thev were immature, but. aside from the

massive drug abuse, these were deeply weird
people in the most benign way, possessed of
a once-in-a-century sense of fun that knew
no boundaries and which, by some luck,
made its way here, making Stanford what it
is. The conveyor belt from La Honda down
the hill to Stanford included people like
David Harris, who lived in Columbae, was
elected president of the ASSU on a pot-le
galization platform, went to jail instead of
Vietnam, and married Joan Baez.
I'm not here to indulge in '60s nostalgia,
but to whatever degree Stanford is defined
by its irreverence. 1 suspect we can trace it
back to that house in La Honda. Hunter
ITiompson described the scene as "the world
capital of madness. There were no rules, fear
was unknown, and sleep was out of the ques
tion." It sounds just like how Stanford must
seem to a freshman.
There are particular, peculiar institutions
that still represent Stanford's frail spirit of
madness and differentiate us from North
western or Duke or Harvard — the co-ops,
the Chappie's obscurantist jokes, absurd
theme parties, the Band and its fixtures (the
Tree, Band Run). Permitted by a weak disci
plinary apparatus and nourished by the good
weather, Stanford traditions have captured
those qualities that are mythically best about
the American West: individualism, noncon
formity, frcethinking. But it's a shrinking
oasis that we've got in this increasingly
parched landscape — Paradise Lost along El
Camino Real's 50 miles of strip mall.
Joan Didion wrote that in California, the
"mind is troubled by some buried but in
eradicable suspicion that things had better
work here, because here, beneath that im
mense bleached sky, is where we run out of
continent."
We're out of space for parking lots and
strip malls. Stanford's free spirit is wispier
now than it was even 10 years ago. and al
most surely it will be a faint trace of its for
mer self in 10 more. To resist the effort to
corporatize and homogenize our home, and
to cherish what is unusual about the place
where we live, is what's left to us. There's a
lot to hold on to, still: the informality of easy
lives, the mountains covered in redwood
forests older than the I iimalayas, the Pacific
beach where you can see elephant seals rut
ting and sparring, the Mission and the Gilroy
Garlic Festival, foggy San Francisco and
funky Santa Cruz. This place still has got
more character than almost anywhere else
in America. It'd be a shame for it to host a
generic university.

<iabe hopes yon 've enjoyed this column. Go
see the elephant seals at Ano Nuevo, and send
him descriptions of their molting coats at
