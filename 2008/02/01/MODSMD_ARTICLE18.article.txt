# NAT-URAL PHILOSOPHY
## Meta column 
### 
Readers, it is time for some reflection —
on your part as well as mine. For I
came to a revelation today, and that is,
simply, that this column is all over the place.
In a had way.
Debating everything from the nature of
cultural identity to the problem of pre-busi
ness tools, "Nat-ural Philosophy" has consis
tently remained inconsistent. Instead of a
unified topical umbrella, or some overarch
ing theme, such as politics, adventure, or
grad-student life, it has dallied repeatedly in
all manner of ridiculous areas. Politics, philo
sophical musings, egotistical introspection:
I've done it all.
And I would have to say that part of this is
due to my unwillingness to be categorized.
Some bit of rebellious. Linkin-Park-listening
teenage angst still finds voice in my general
"you don't know me" attitude. If you can de
fine me, you rob me of my identity, or so this
pseudo-rhetoric goes. Incidentally, the same
complaint, until recently, kept me from
choosing a major.
But that's not all of it. I think the other
part is that I don't judge myself a competent
expert in any particular field. Pokemon iden
tification and my obscure music collection
aside. (Check out my radio show, by the way.
Saturdays from 12-3 on KZSU Stanford. 90.1
FM ). Fven with my newfound majors, I don't
feel, as of yet, that I have any kind of expert
ise to speak of.
And the result has largely been a few
botched columns. Certain themes have
shown up in places they probably shouldn't
have. As was the case last week, for instance,
unintentional political undertones (which in
this case were completely contrary to my real
beliefs) got placed in the context of a mostly
harmless rant about the annoyance of over-

vigilant traffic officers.
So here I arrive at the question that has
been raised many times on the comment
board of The Stanford Daily's Web site: why
do I have a column?
Before 1 attempt to answer this question.
I will pose a few others. Before I sit down to
write a column, I ask myself: this week, do I
write a Doric, an lonic or a Corinthian col
umn? Do I march boldly forward in a unified
military column, or will my masterpiece
merely turn out to be a column of smoke? Is
my column something you can find in an
Excel worksheet, or, worse, am I to be men
tioned in the same sentence as the Alkali
Earth Metals on the periodic table?
The angle I usually approach it from is
none of the above but. rather, that of the car
toonist. I love cartoons — in cartoons, all
subtlety is gone. Nothing is hidden, nothing is
too obscure to see.
Cartoonists make a living exaggerating
what is under the surface. And in so doing,for
better or for worse, they bring about hidden
prejudice, hidden assumptions and hidden
realities. They simplify the complex, make
smooth the harsh edges, and make harsh the
smooth ones. And the result is a world so
seemingly distorted from our own that we
can't help but notice its features.
But is it so different? As every caricaturist
who has ever drawn Jay Leno knows, he real-

ly does have a big chin. I guess what I'm try
ing to say is that my basic philosophy, the real
"Nat-ural" philosophy, is this: in hyperbole,
there is truth.
Drawing cartoons isn't hard. It is an art
that, by and large, does not require expertise.
In fact. 1. like many of you, started drawing
them when 1 was five years old. But the sim
plicity of cartoons does not take away from
their expressive power. 1 hope to present for
you in my columns a picture that is obviously
exaggerated. Eyebrows get thicker, chins get
magnified, and issues in the world around us
become almost comically simple. But I hope
that in reading my cartoons, you walk away
with at least some sense of the truth behind
the funny picture.
Whether or not all of my columns thus far
have fit into this mold is a matter of debate.
But I have realized that this is what I can do.
And it is with this in mind that I narrow my
focus, in the upcoming volume, to the theme
of cartoons.
In the future, my columns will give snip
pets of Stanford life, blown up, contrast-shift
ed, and with the opacity adjusted. I will take
a real picture but apply a few Photoshop fil
ters to it, and the result may just be a bright
blue Hoover Tower.
I hope that so far, you have enjoyed my
scattered and disorganized romp through
various genres. Even if you haven't, however,
I hope you will stay tuned to my future
columns for a bit of Corinthian flutes, orna
mented with a Looney Toons license plate
decal.
