Many factors affect abortion decline
To the Editor,
I took an interest in the Jan. 29 editorial
("Surgical Abortion Rates Decline As Alter
natives Increase"]. As someone who has con
ducted a considerable amount of research on
abortion trends in this country, 1 was pleased
that you gave the topic some attention. Un
fortunately, I believe that your analysis of the
data is Hawed.
Though non-surgical abortions may have
contributed to the recent decline in overall
abortions, it should be noted that the down
ward trend in the incidence of abortion start

ed in 1990.This is well before the FDA grant
ed approval to RU-486. which is the most
common form of medication used to induce
abortion.
Secondly, the editorial uses Guttmacher
Institute data to downplay the role that anti
abortion legislation had in this abortion de
cline. However, more reliable and more
consistent data from the Centers for Dis
ease Control (CDC) tell a considerably dif
ferent story. Data from the CDC indicates
that states that have been the most active in
passing pro-life legislation have seen the
largest and most consistent abortion de
clines. ITiis would include both Mississippi

and Michigan, both of which have seen the
number of abortions fall by 50 pcrcent since
1990, In fact. Mississippi only has one re
maining abortion clinic left in the entire
state.
Furthermore,articles in peer reviewed ac
ademic journals as diverse as The New Eng
land Journal of Medicine, The Journal of
Health Economics, and The Journal of Law
and Economics provide solid evidence that
incremental pro-life legislation has been ef
fective at reducing the incidence of abortion
in the United States and abroad.
