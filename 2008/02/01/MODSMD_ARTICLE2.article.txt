## Lopez Leads Cardinal to Victory 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
The Lopez twins dominated Thursday night as
No. 14 Stanford eruised to its first victory in Seattle
in six years. Sophomore forward Brook Lopez
continued his tear on Pac-10 opponents, scoring a
career-high 31 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in
helping the Cardinal cruise to a 65-51 victory over
the Washington Huskies.
"We just got good looks in the post," Lopez
said. "My guards did a good job and got me good
angles to the basket... It's something we've been
working on in practice, having three men on one
side and working the down screen with the point
guard up top."
Lopez had 15 points at halftime and kept right
on rolling throughout the second half. The Huskies
tried nearly everything, switching from man-to
man to zone and back again, double-teaming
Brook and trying out different defensive match
ups. But Lopez converted every time, making it
look easy.
"This was his best game for 40 minutes," said
junior point guard Mitch Johnson. "I've seen him
dominate for halves before, but this was the best
full 40."
Starting from the second half of Stanford's vic
tory against Arizona State two weeks ago, Lopez
has matured rapidly. He has passed well out of
double teams and refrained from forcing shots in
traffic. The result yesterday was an easy victory for
the Cardinal, who took the lead on an Anthonv

Though his numbers were less
flashy, sophomore center Robin

"I've seen [Lopez] dominate for
halves before, but this was the best
full 40."
— Mitch Johnson, junior

been that successful, but today wc did
a great job," Johnson said. "We were
pretty consistent. [Washington] is a
team of runs — they get their crowd
into it and are effective going inside
out — but each time they started one
we were able to weather the storm."
Quincy Pondexter, the Huskies'
sophomore forward who played on
the same high school team as the
Lopez twins, cut the Stanford lead to
13 with a free throw with 4:40 remain
ing. But Stanford never allowed the
I iuskies within single digits after 18:39
remained.
The team led by as much as 21, and
its characteristically strong defense
kept the Huskies from mounting any
kind of comeback. Sophomore wing
Landry Melds impressed defensively
in 22 minutes and also contributed 8
points for the Cardinal.
Pondexter was perhaps the lone
bright spot for the Huskies, as he
scored 15 points and grabbed 8 re
bounds off the bench. But Washington
as a team shot only 56.3 percent from
the foul line, 28.8 percent from the
field and 25 percent from three-point
range. The Huskies were outrebound
ed 41-36 and notched only 4 assists,
compared to Stanford's 18.
Stanford will face No. 9 Washing
ton on Saturday; the game is set for a
noon tip-off. The Cougars took an
upset loss at home to Cal today, falling
to 5-3 in conference while giving Stan
ford sole possession of second place in
the Pac-10.
"IVying to stay in the race in the
Pac-10, every game is huge," Johnson
said. "For every road game, everyone
has to do their part."
If the Cardinal players fill their
roles like they did Iliursday night in
Seattle, they have a shot at pulling off
a rare road sweep in the Pac-10.
