## Stanford immune to study abroad probe 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
The New York Attorney General's office is cur
rently investigating study-abroad programs at 15
universities, including I (arvard and Columbia. But
Stanford's study-abroad program has not yet been
targeted for investigation and. according to the
University, has no reason to be targeted.
New York investigators have identified "ques
tionable practices" in more than a dozen compa
nies worldwide that arranged for students to study
abroad. According to The New York Times, some
programs offer colleges undisclosed benefits,
including marketing stipends, seats on advisory
boards and rebates. Although the probe is based in
New York, the Attorney General's office says it has
jurisdiction to protect its students and their families
wherever students attend a college or university

Irene Kennedy, executive director of the Bing
Overseas Program, said that since the investigation
is related to the activities of private providers.
Stanford is not implicated in the probe's charges.
"Because our office only manages Stanford
programs, our abroad programs have none of these
problems." Kennedy said. "We don't recommend
non-Stanford programs to Stanford students, so the
need for commercial providers is a non-issue."
According to Kennedy, the University's deci
sion to avoid commercial providers is rooted in a
sense of academic responsibility.
"The Bing Overseas Program is over 50 years
old," she said. "We feel safe vouching for the aca
demic integrity offered overseas, and we can't do
that for other programs."
Students must stop out if they choose to partic
ipate in a non-Stanford program. Kennedy added
that most students choose a Stanford program

because of its many advantages.
"The overseas fee is similar to their tuition at
Stanford." she said. "And courses at any one of our
programs have been validated ahead of time so
that students know what they need to take to fulfill
their requirements, graduate, etc."
Kennedy was relieved that Stanford's study
abroad programs were exempt from this investiga
tion. though she empathized with the difficulties
faced by other universities.
"In defense of other schools, it's a catch-22 for
them," Kennedy said. "They want to make a good
recommendation to students, and in order to do
that they have to review or visit of a lot of these
programs. But that being said. 1 am very glad we
are not among these 15 schools."
