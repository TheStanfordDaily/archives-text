## Lessig talks copyright concerns 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT 
If you've already waged a battle
against Mickey Mouse, whom do
you take on next? For Law Prof.
Lawrence Lessig. the answer is easy:
the United States Congress.
Lessig gave his last lecture on
"Free Culture. Copyright and the
Future of Ideas" to a crowd of over
500 gathered at Memorial
Auditorium yesterday. A vocal pro
ponent of less restriction on copy
rights. Lessig is now shifting his aca
demic focus to political corruption.
After losing a case in the
Supreme Court in 2002 that chal
lenged indefinite copyright exten
sions granted by Congress in 1998,
Lessig turned his loss into a thriving
grassroots movement. Known as
"free culture." it promotes the abili
ty of citizens to distribute and modi
fy creative works without fear of
copyright infringement.
"Since Brown v. Board of
Education, liberals tend to think
that all important problems must be
solved by the courts." Lessig said.
"But the problem isn't
Constitutional — it's political, and it
can only be solved by gaining the
understanding of ordinary people."
Gaining that understanding has
n't been easy. Lessig used Disney as
an example.
"Most people think, 'Why
shouldn't they hold a copyright for
Mickey Mouse?"' Lessig said.
But according to him, that intu
ition has two central flaws.
First, while copyright extension
helps Mickey Mouse, it all but
destroys the lesser-known works
that will not be preserved unless
they pass into the public domain.
Second, Disney's position is
somewhat ironic.
"Walt Disney himself took sto
ries that were in the public domain
and made them relevant to current
generations," Lessig said. "He built
on the past to make something new.
But now that the Disney
Corporation understands how valu
able their copyrights are, they don't
want anyone to do to them what
Walt Disney did to the Brothers'
Grimm."
Lessig founded the non-profit
organization Creative Commons to
change the "all rights reserved"
nature of copyrights to "some rights
reserved." Creative Commons helps
copyright holders to retain some of
their rights while granting others to
the public. The organization has
gained a wide following, and Lessig
credits two societal developments
with creating the "perfect storm" to
push popular opinion toward sup
port of free culture.
The first such development is
what Lessig described as a "war by
copyright holders to strengthen con
trol over how their culture gets

used."
"A woman posts a clip on
You l übe of her toddler dancing to a
Prince song." Lessig said.
"And somewhere a $1000-an
hour lawyer thinks it's a good idea
to file a lawsuit."
The second is what Lessig called
"an explosion in digital creativity,"
pointing to homemade music videos
and political ads distributed through
the Internet as examples of new
forms of public conversation.
Ultimately, in June 2007 Lessig
decided that it was time to tackle a
new problem — political corrup
tion.
"Creative Commons has been
enormously successful since the late
19905," Lessig said. "But policy mak
ers are doing no better."
Lessig pointed to the example of
global warming to show how the
influence of money — for instance,
that of oil companies — leads to
"screwy public policy."
"It's not about bribes," Lessig
said. "It's about access and influence
and ignoring the side without the
money."
Lessig has modeled his fight
against political corruption on the
grassroots nature of the free culture

movement. Although he praised the
campaigns of John Ldwards and
Barack Obama for refusing dona
tions from lobbyists, Lessig empha
sized that just as the Supreme Court
was not the solution to copyrights,
the President is not the solution to
corruption.
"The President is too constrained
by a Congress that is captured by
corruption," Lessig said.
To change this. Lessig advocates
supporting Congressional candi
dates who make three vows: that
they will abolish earmarks, refuse
contributions from lobbyists and
political action committees and sup
port publicly financed campaigns.
Lessig's fellow members in the
free culture movement applaud his
decision.
"Political corruption is at the root
of the problems that free culture
tries to solve," said Rebecca Rojer,
who works in business development
at Creative Commons. "It's a natural
next step."
"The lack of transparency of
information is common to both
issues." agreed Gregg Wolff, a sup
porter of Creative Commons since

Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig discussed copyright law in his final lecture on
"free culture." Lessig plans to move on to studies of political corruption.
