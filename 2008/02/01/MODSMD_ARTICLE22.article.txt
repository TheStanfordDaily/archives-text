## CARD FALLS TO TIGERS No. 7 Stanford loses to winless Pacific team at home, will face Ball State next. 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
I"he No. 7 Stanford men's volley
ball team knew that its opponent's
winless record was not an accurate
reflection of their skill. Unfortunate
ly for the Cardinal, Pacific put to
gether its best match of the season,
coming away with a sweep in Burn
ham Pavilion last night.
"We were saying before the game
that they were the best 0-8 team in
the country." sophomore setter
Kawika Shoji said. "They were well
prepared for us, and they were hot
tonight. We came out flat and they
took it to us."
The Tigers (1-8, 1-6 MPSF) won
the first game 30-21 and did not look
back, following with 30-26 and 30-24
wins over the Cardinal (6-4.3-4).
"Pacific is going to get their
wins," head coach John Kosty said.
"They came out strong. They did ex
actly what they needed to do to start
the match. We came into the match
thinking there were going to be
some seams in the block, places for
us to hit it. Hut they have done a
good job shoring up their blocking
defense.
"'lTiey took us out of our offen
sive rhythm by serving tough to start
the match," he continued. "We
couldn't get the ball to the net. which
gave them a nice opportunity to get
two or three guys up. And we did not
deal well with that situation."
The teams stayed close in the
early going, but the Tigers slowly
pulled ahead.
"They didn't make too many er
rors [at the beginning of the match],
and they passed well," Kosty said.
"So we slowly fell behind as the
games went on. We had difficulty
scoring. It was 14-11 when I called
my first timeout, and we had already
missed seven serves."

GAME NOTES: Stanford fell to 6-4 and 3-4 in
Pac-10 play after suffering a shocking loss to
the previously winless Pacific Tigers. Ball
State will be the Cardinal's first non-confer
ence opponent in several games. Stanford's
conference, the MPSF, is traditionally the
toughest in the nation, so the Ball State Car
dinals may be a welcome challenge for the
Cardinal.

more serves the rest of the first
game, hut the damage had already
been done.
The second game was more of the
same, with the score tied as late as
15-15 before Pacific again pulled
away. A kill by the Tigers made it a
two-game advantage after their 30-
24 victory.
To start the thud game, the teams
continued to trade one-point leads
until a Pacific ace forced a Stanford
timeout with the Tigers ahead 20-IS.
A 5-2 run out of the timeout all but
put the match away. Pacific touched
the net on a Stanford miss that
would have ended the game, giving
the Cardinal another chance, but a
missed serve ended it. 30-24.
"I called a timeout at 18-20 [in the
third game]," Kosty said. "We were
in striking distance, but we couldn't
keep the engines running."

Jesse Meredith and the Cardinal were not able to hold off a fierce yet previously winless Pacific team, losing
in three games. They will try to redeem themselves Saturday against Ball State at Burnham Pavilion.
Matt Ceran was second with nine
kills but struggled with consistency.
The Cardinal hitters had trouble
against the Pacific front line, getting
blocked 12 times.
Romero led the Stanford net de
fense with three blocks. Junior
libero Jarod Keller led all players
with 10 digs.
Each team finished with 3 aces,
but the Cardinal missed 19 serves.
The Tigers missed 15.

"As I have continued to say
throughout the season, in the MPSF
it is all about serving and passing,"
Kosty said. "They definitely served
and passed better than we did. even
though the statistics did not show
it."
ITie Cardinal will host the Ball
State Cardinals (4-5.2-1 MIVA) to
morrow in a non-conference match.
"We don't know a lot about Ball
State, but we know that they are a
very good team," Shoji said. "We're
lucky to have Friday as a day to prac
tice and prepare for them and work
on the things that we need to do to
win."
Kosty echoed the sentiment.

"We need to take care of our side
of the net," he said. "We don't have
an opportunity to watch them all
that much. It is a good chance for us
to concentrate on the things that we
need to do. UOP showed us what we
need to work on. High-ball hitting
wasn't effective, our passing wasn't
clicking and we didn't have the
greatest serving night."
The Ball State squad has won its
last three in a row and will play at
Pacific tonight before facing Stan
ford tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
