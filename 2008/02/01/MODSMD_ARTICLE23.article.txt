# Wrestling Rolls North to Oregon
## Upstart Stanford squad to face Ducks and defending champion Beavers 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After winning its fourth
straight dual match last weekend,
the Stanford wrestling team will
face yet another major hurdle in
the Pacific-10 Conference as it
travels north for a pair of duals in
Oregon this weekend. First up is a
match with Oregon in Fugene on
Friday night, followed by a shot at
defending conference champion
Oregon State on Sunday.
The Cardinal (10-3,3-1 Pac-10)
finds itself in a fantastic position to
capitalize on a big weekend, hav
ing found its stride early in the
year.That momentum could prove
key to defeating a pair of difficult
conference rivals on the road this
weekend — according to head
coach Kerry McCoy — but the
real test will be whether his team
can continue to build on its early
season success.
"1 think the bottom line, to go
3-0 on the weekend, is huge,"
McCoy said of his squad's sweep
of last weekend's events."lt's what
we set out to do, go out and wres
tle well, and the Bakersfield dual
set us off to a good start, and we
followed it up here. Obviously, you
always want more,you want to win
more matches, but 1 think the guys
really stepped up, and our level is
getting higher. The intensity, the
commitment is getting higher.
"And I told these guys that it's
great, but I don't want them to rest
on it because everyone's level is
getting higher at this time of year,"
he continued. "So we have to con
tinue to get better, and this just
shows that we can really go out
and put some points up and con

tinue to wrestle well."
Oregon (9-9, 0-6) returns four
wrestlers who placed in last year's
conference tournament for a
Ducks' squad which finished the
season ranked eighth. One key
bout is likely to come at 174
pounds, where junior Luke Feist is
starting to regain his form from
last season after an injury-trou
bled start to this year. The Ducks
will counter with Ronnie Lee,
their lone returning NCAA quali
fier from last season who has
racked up an impressive 20 wins
on the season.
The Beavers (7-6, 4-3). mean
while, return only a shell of last
year's conference championship
team — only three of Oregon
State's eight wrestlers who placed
in the I'ac-10 tournament last year
returned to Corvallis for this sea
son. Still, a win against the Beavers
would be Stanford's first since
2004 and just its second in series'
history, dating back to 1953.
The Cardinal has been carried
so far this year by stalwart seniors
Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds.
Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds and
sophomore Zach Giesen at IK4
pounds. A surprising array of new
comers have also been crucial in
the team's success thus far: red
shirt freshman Lucas Espericueta,
wrestling at 149 pounds, boasts a
22-7 record on the year while
sophomore Jake Johnson is just
behind him at 197 pounds with a
mark of 21-8.
Following Johnson's perfect 3-0
weekend, McCoy was optimistic
that his younger wrestlers, like
Johnson, are capable of stepping

up and really helping the Cardinal
when it counts this year.
"They've all been working, and
Jake, he's kind of one of those, you
know, unassuming guys," McCoy
said. "He doesn't get a lot of the at
tention, he's not one of the flashy
guys out there, but he puts a lot into
it, he works hard and he gets it done.
That was one of the key matches of
the dual [against Bakersfield], and
we had all the confidence that he
could go out there and do it. So he's
got his goals set on a Pac-10 title,
just like the rest of those guys. So it's
nice to see him go out there and get
closer to that goal."
With five dual matches still to go,
the Cardinal has already matched
its second best win total in program
history with 10 victories. Should
Stanford sweep the rest of its meets
on the year, it would tie the school
record for most team wins in a sea
son, set in 1974-75.
