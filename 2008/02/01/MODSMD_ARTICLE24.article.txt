## Card Set for SoCal Schools No. 9 UCLA, No. 6 USC to visit the Farm this weekend 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
After two tough losses on the road last
weekend, the Stanford men's tennis team
kicks off its Pac-10 schedule at home today
against No. 9 UCLA at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.The team will also face No. 6
USC tomorrow in another crucial confer
ence match.
Stanford (0-2,0-0 Pac-10) looks to get its
first victory of the year after tough losses to
No. 23 and No. 2 Georgia last weekend.
"Anytime USC, UCLA and Stanford get
together, it's a great weekend of tennis," said
head coach John Whitlinger. "Our guys are
looking forward to it. [USC and UCLA| are
looking forward to it. This is one of the best
weekends of tennis of the year."
A particular area in which Stanford
struggled last weekend was doubles play: the
team lost five of six doubles matches. The
all-important doubles point will still be cru
cial this weekend, as well as the energy and
momentum the point carries into singles
play.
"We have good doubles players, it's just a
matter of finding the right combinations,"
Whitlinger said. "We may look at different
possibilities [this weekend]."
UCLA (1-0,0-0 Pac-10) is fresh off a vic
tory over No. 16 Pepperdine on Tuesday in
its first dual match of the season.The Bruins
lost the doubles point but ended up taking
five of six singles matches for the victory.
They feature two nationally ranked players
— No. 32 Mathieu Dehaine and No. 38
Haythem Abid — who figure to give the
Cardinal a challenge. Just like Stanford, the
Bruins' lineup features two freshmen and a
transfer, so they are a different team from
those of years past. Nonetheless, they are
still one of the best in the nation.
"UCLA is a good team," Whitlinger said.
"They are tough to beat anywhere."
USC is very solid and could easily be ranked
in the top five. Robert Farah is the No. 9
ranked singles player in the nation, followed
by Gary Sacks at No. 43. In doubles, Farah
and Kaes Van't Hof are the No. 2 ranked duo
in the nation. The Trojans also have great
depth at the lower singles spots.
"USC is [a] very strong team." Whitinger
said. "They are every bit as good as Geor
gia."
The Trojans — who play Cal today be
fore facing Stanford tomorrow — are 3-0
this season. It will be interesting to see how
the two teams match up in singles play
"Our strength is at the top. and their
