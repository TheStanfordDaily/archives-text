Tennis rained out again, but not completely
The weather cleared up enough for the No.
2 Stanford women's tennis team to finally play
its first dual-match of the season. However,
the sunshine was short-lived on an otherwise
rainy Thursday afternoon at the Farm.
After canceling its opener against UC-
Davis not once, hut twice, it appeared as
though Stanford would actually be able to
play a full match against No. 14 Fresno State
yesterday. Even after pushing the start time
up to 11 a.m.. rain halted play after the dou
bles point had been claimed by Stanford
against a strong Bulldog lineup.
Playing in her first collegiate dual match,
freshman Milan Barte teamed with sopho
more Lindsay Burdette in an 8-5 loss to the
No. 1 ranked doubles team of Melanie Gloria
andTinesta Rowe.
However, junior Jessica Nguyen and sen
ior Whitney Deason won an 8-6 decision over
the Bulldogs' Renata Kucerkova and Anasta
sia Petukhova, ranked 29th in doubles. Senior
Celia Durkin and freshman Carolyn McVeigh
defeated Danon Beatty and Vanessa Heroux
8-3 to give the Cardinal the winning point in
doubles.
Had singles play begun, the tentative Car
dinal lineup would have featured Barte at the
No. 1 spot, followed by Nguyen, Burdette.
Durkin. Deason and McVeigh. Nguyen was
slated to face Petukhova. No. 11 in the ITA
rankings.
Despite having not played a complete dual
match yet. Stanford still stands at No. 2 in the
national rankings behind defending champi
on Georgia Tech.The Yellow Jackets current
ly lead the standings with all 10 first-place
votes. 10 points ahead of Stanford (750 to
740). No. 3 UCLA trails the Card at a close
third with 735 votes.
With more rain pouring overnight,
it appears that Stanford's scheduled
match for tomorrow against No. 41
UNLV may not take place, either.
Track travels to Washington
The men's and women's track
teams will be competing this weekend
at University of Washington Indoor
Invitational held in Seattle.
Competition begins today and will

feature a number of Pac-10 teams and
other west coast programs: host schcx)l
Washington. Oregon, UCLA. Baylor.
Portland. BYU. UNLV, C'al State
Northridge, Sacramento State,
Portland State and Eastern
Washington make up the list of
Stanford's opponents for the week
end.
The Cardinal wonym will be led by
senior Erica McLain in the triple jump
— last year's national champion in the
event. For distance running, Stanford
features the likes of seniors Arianna
Lambie, Lauren Centrowitz and
Teresa McWalters — the trio which
helped lead Stanford cross country to
three straight national titles.

The men's track squad will also see
overlap from the cross country team.
Juniors Garrett Heath, Hakon
DeVries and I lari Mix will compete in
the 3000 meters. Other notable com
petitors for the Cardinal are junior
Myles Bradley (60 meter hurdles) and
senior Graeme Hoste (pole vault).
Baseball gets in gear
It might he a little early for Spring
Training, but that won't stop Stanford
baseball from holding its first official
practice of the season today.The team
begins practice in preparation for its
season-opening series against
Nebraska, Feb. 22-24.
"We are excited to get going once

again in 2008," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said to GoStanford.com.
"We look forward to continuing the
legacy we've built here at Stanford
and starting another college baseball
season."
Coach Marquess's squad looks to
improve on a disappointing year in
2007. when the team went 28-28 over
all and 9-15 in Pac-10 play.
Traditionally, the Cardinal has boasted
one of the strongest programs in the
nation — the team made 13 straight
appearances in the 64-team NCAA
Tournament before missing champi
onship play last season.
