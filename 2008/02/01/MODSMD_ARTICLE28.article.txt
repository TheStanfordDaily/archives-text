### MOHAMMAD ALI CONTRUBUTING WRITER 
Despite last night's rain and chill, more than
150 people gathered at Arrillaga Alumni Center
to enjoy stylish desserts and soothing jazz music
â€” and to listen to one of America's most cele
brated civil rights activists, Julian Bond.
"1 recognize the greatness and the history that
is going to walk into this building in a minute,"
said Jan Barker-Alexander, assistant dean of stu
dents and director of the Black Community
Services Center, as Julian Bond entered to a
standing ovation for the event titled "A
Conversation with Julian Bond."
Bond, who is a poet, author, student leader and
the current Chairman of the National Association
for Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
described a childhood in which he was surround
ed by intellectual giants.
Both of Bond's parents were college gradu
ates, and. at a time when it was extremely difficult
for black Americans to attain an education.
Bond's grandfather, James Bond, graduated from
Berea College in 1892. As a child, he interacted
with some of the world's best minds, even meet
ing with figures like Albert Einstein.
"It's great to live on a college campus," he said.
Asked if he was perfect growing up. he respond
ed, "Pretty much so." drawing warm laughter
from the crowd.
Although playful at times. Bond was not afraid
to express his distaste for the American govern
ment. When asked about President Bush, he said
"his education policies are wrong, his economic
policies are wrong."

"People like [Bush] will go to any length to
silence dissent," Bond said.
Bond is no stranger to controversy. In the
19605, he was one of the most vocal opponents of
the Vietnam War. which led to his unseating from
the Georgia House of Representatives in 1966. As
late as 2001. he was accused of "racial
McCarthyism" by then-House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-Texas) for saying that Attorney
General John Ashcroft and Interior Secretary
Gail Norton's "devotion to the Confederacy is
nearly canine in its uncritical affection."
Yet despite his controversial comments, the
crowd applauded several times during his talk.
Besides criticizing the current administration.
Bond rallied the crowd by addressing economic

inequality.
"You can't have racial equality unless you
have economic equality," he said. "We need to
have an education system that makes us compet
itive in the modern world [...We need] a system of
public works for people who cannot work in the
market system."
As the event ended. Bond answered questions
from both the audience and users on
You Tube.com.
Recalling why he chose to be an English major
at Morehouse College, Bond said, "If you can
read and write, and understand, and express your
self in your native tongue, you can do anything."
