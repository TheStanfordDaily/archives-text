# STUDENT LIFE
## Course Work improves, still contains kinks 
### NATHANIEL EISEN 
Course Work, Stanford's online
course companion site, experienced
far fewer problems at the start of
winter quarter than it did during the
fall, according to administrators,
though some students continue to
voice complaints regarding the site.
'•Performance was very stable,"
said Makoto Tsuchitani,
Course Work project manager.
However, some students still
encountered difficulties registering
for new classes and, once registered,
getting those classes to appear in
their homepage tabi.
Course Work offers tools for
instructors to post materials and
grades and for students to turn in
assignments. The current version of
the program. Course Work 5.0, made
its debut at the start of autumn quar
ter. Yet its functionality was impaired
at the outset by the inability of many
users to log in.
Administrators took steps to
resolve those issues, which stemmed
from the large number of simultane
ous users. As a result, complaints dra
matically decreased at the start of
winter quarter. Administrators now
feel confident that the program can
handle the peak number of 1,800
users logging in at one time.
Nonetheless, some students expe
rienced minor problems at the begin
ning of the quarter.
"There was a delay in getting one
of the classes added from Axess to
Course Work," said Christie Cho '10.
"One to two days, nothing out of the
ordinary."
This problem occurs because
Course Work and Axess use an inter
mediary system, known as Course
Registry, to get classes added on
Axess into Coursework.
Stanford's Course Work team is
currently collaborating with the
University of Michigan, Indiana
University, UC-Berkeley and MIT,
under the auspices of the Sakai
Project. Each school develops differ
ent functions and shares them with

the other schools.
Additionally, the ASSU set up a
student advisory board last spring to
provide feedback to Academic
Computing about Course Work in
particular.
Academic Computing also intro
duced new Course Work features for
instructors at the start of winter quar
ter, including a new homepage tool
and the option of linking to iTbnesU.
Instructors and students
expressed varying degrees of satisfac
tion with Course Work's new compo
nents.
"It's the best way to reach all the
students in class," said Amanda
Sharkey, graduate student and teach
ing assistant in the Sociology
Department.
Crystal Lemire '08 also saw
improvements in the new version.
"The new one has better organi
zation of files," she said. "I'm able to
find information and updates more
easily than before."
Jong Kim '08 disagreed.
"It's more confusing than the old
one," he said. "It has more features
than it used to — I just use the fea
tures it retained."
