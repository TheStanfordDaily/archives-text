# Stanford 77, USC 51
## FARM'S FINEST CANDICE WIGGINS SETS STANFORD SCORING RECORD 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Senior guard Candice Wiggins broke a storied
record, the Cardinal avenged a previous loss, and No.

7 Stanford put on a defensive clinic en route to a 77-
51 win over USC Thursday night at Maples

Pavilion.

Wiggins scored 18 points — none bigger
than a first-half put-back which broke
Stanford's career scoring record. Entering last
night's game, Wiggins needed just 12 points to
eclipse Kate Starbird's '97 career total of
2,215.

"It wasn't really on my mind," said
Wiggins. But after reading signs around
Maples saying "2,216 and counting...," the

implications of the night became clear.
Wiggins, ever modest, brushed them off:
"It's good to get it over with." she said.

Coach Tara VanDerveer had nothing
but praise for her star guard.
"Candice is an extremely intelli-

gent player," she said. "Leave her
open and you're going to pay the
price."

USC coach Mark Trakh con
curred.

"She's right up there with any
one I've coached against," he
said. "She's an exceptional play
er that will be very good on the J
next level." I

"l'd rather sit in the stands and
watch her play someone else," he con
tinued." Her graduation day will be one
to celebrate."
"After the game, VanDerveer and
Athletic Director Hob Bowlsby pre
sented Wiggins with the game ball.
With 192 more points, Wiggins will
tie the Pac-10 career scoring record set
by I JSC's Lisa Leslie.
Wiggins's accomplishment was one
of many on the night for the Cardinal.
The Stanford defense was at its best,
forcing a season-high 29 turnovers and
holding USC to only 36.2 percent
shooting, including just 29 percent in
the first half.
"We did an excellent job forcing
turnovers," said VanDerveer.
"They forced a lot of turnovers that
we usually don't commit," Trakh said.
USC's previous season-high for
turnovers was 13.
Perhaps more impressive was the
defensive play against USC guard
Camille LeNoir, who was held score
less. In the Trojans' 73-72 win over the
Cardinal earlier this month. LeNoir

USCs offensive load shifted to oft
injured junior Brynn Cameron, one of
the lone bright spots for the Women of
Troy. She went 4-5 from behind the
three-point arc. leading LJSC with 16
points. Her effort was not nearly
enough to stop the Cardinal defense.
"We could have played harder"
Cameron admitted.
Although they took an early lead
that they never relinquished, Stan
ford's offense didn't click until midway
through the first half—the Cardinal
began the game just 4-14 from the field.
"Some people were rushing," Van-
Derveer said. But as the turnovers
piled up. Stanford began to push the
ball in transition, crippling USCs de
fense. Junior forward Jillian Harmon,
who finished with 10 points, was espe
cially effective on breakaways.
"I liked how Jill was getting out
fast," VanDerveer said. "1 loved her
hustle."

ter Jayne Appel, who dominated, going
9-10 from the field. Appel, who strug
gled earlier in the season, has come on
as of late, becoming the offensive force
she was expected to be.
"I'm more aware of the types of
shots I'm taking," Appel said.
"She can be unstoppable." said Van-
Derveer. "She's a rock for us."
Appel led Stanford to a 44-21 lead
at intermission, allowing VanDerveer
to rest her starters for most of the sec
ond halt The defense softened a bit in
the last ten minutes of the game as the
Cardinal's reserves handled much of
the playing time.
"We were able to play everyone,"
VanDerveer said."['l"here were] no ex
tended minutes for anybody. We
should be good to go for UCLA."
Hie Cardinal will face off against
the Bruins on Saturday at Maples,
looking to avenge an ugly 69-56 loss
from a month ago.
The post players will play a major
role in the game: Appel and freshman
forward Kayla Pedersen will match up
against a tall front-line boasting six
players over 6-foot-3.
"She'll face a challenge against
UCLA again," VanDerveer said, in ref
erence to Appel. " lhey have a lot of big
bodies."
Against the Bruins on Jan. 4. Appel
was held to a poor 35.9 shooting per
centage. Pedersen was also shut down,
as she was held to just two points. Wig
gins carried the brunt of the load in the
loss, but her 29 points came on only 11-
28 shooting.
But the star guard — and now the
all-time leading scorer in Stanford his
tory — is confident.
"Our offense is set." Wiggins said.
It's hard to dismiss Wiggins's claim;
the momentum from last night's event
should keep Stanford on its toes com
ing into Saturday's match-up with
UCLA. Against USC, not even an
extra step could stop the Cardinal: on
the possession following her record
setting basket. Wiggins hit a shot from
behind the arc, only to have it called
back because of a traveling violation.
A timeout was then called, and all
Wiggins could do was smile before run
ning back to her teammates. The rout
was on. and her place in Cardinal lore
was secure.
