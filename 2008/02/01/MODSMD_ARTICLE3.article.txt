# Stanford 77, USC 51
## FARM'S FINEST CANDICE WIGGINS SETS STANFORD SCORING RECORD 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Senior guard Candice Wiggins broke a storied
record, the Cardinal avenged a previous loss, and No.

7 Stanford put on a defensive clinic en route to a 77-
51 win over USC Thursday night at Maples

Pavilion.

Wiggins scored 18 points â€” none bigger
than a first-half put-back which broke
Stanford's career scoring record. Entering last
night's game, Wiggins needed just 12 points to
eclipse Kate Starbird's '97 career total of
2,215.

"It wasn't really on my mind," said
Wiggins. But after reading signs around
Maples saying "2,216 and counting...," the

implications of the night became clear.
Wiggins, ever modest, brushed them off:
"It's good to get it over with." she said.

Coach Tara VanDerveer had nothing
but praise for her star guard.
"Candice is an extremely intelli-

gent player," she said. "Leave her
open and you're going to pay the
price."

USC coach Mark Trakh con
curred.

"She's right up there with any
one I've coached against," he
said. "She's an exceptional play
er that will be very good on the J
next level." I
