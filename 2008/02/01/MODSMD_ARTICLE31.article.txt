## "Tourism and the American Landscape" at Cantor 
### NICK PARKER INTERMISSION NATURAL MAN 
When the early 20th century historian Frederick Jackson Turn
er published his "Frontier Thesis" in 1893 and announced the
closing of the American West, he was writing as a contemporary
of three artists whose work was instrumental in encouraging the
American people to venture out into the wilderness.
The newest exhibit at Cantor Arts Center. "Frederic Church,
Winslow 1 lomer and Thomas Moran: Tourism and the American
Landscape," which opened Wednesday and will remain at Can
tor until May 4, showcases these three artists' works, most of
which are on loan from New York's Cooper Hewitt Museum.
According to a placard at the exhibit's entrance, Church,
Homer and Moran "recorded, romanticized and sometimes em
bellished views of Niagara, the Adirondacks, New Hampshire,
Maine, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite. [...] The
artists encouraged America to become a nation of tourists."
The exhibit is housed on the first floor, in the Pigott Family
Gallery — a cavernous space that makes the exhibit somewhat
overwhelming and hard to navigate, but no less inspiring — and
is loosely divided into sections that correspond to geographic re
gions, ranging from New 1 lampshire's White Mountains to New
York's Niagara Falls to Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park.
The differences between the artists themselves, however, are
what make the exhibit so striking. Though Church, Homer and
Moran were all masters of depicting nature, their methods could
not have been more different, and their works reflect varying per
ceptions of themeaning of wilderness.
Winslow Homer (1836-1910) took pastoral inspiration from
1 foughton Farm, a West Point-area second home for a rich New
Yorker, and his oil paintings are unique in the Cantor exhibit in
that they almost always include people and are marked by a dis
tinctly impressionistic tone. In fact, it is one of Homer's most icon
ic paintings, "Man with a Knapsack." that greets visitors near the
entrance. The 1873 oil painting that screams impressionism de

picts an austere hiker armed with a walking stick staring off into
the distance against a red-orange backdrop that captures the
essencc of autumn in New England. "Autumn Tree Tops," an
other 1873 masterpiece, provides a stark contrast between the
bright colors of changing leaves in the foreground and the monot
onous hrown of rolling hills in the background.
In addition to his oil paintings. Homer was also a master wood

cutter. Many of his wood engravings — including "The Coolest
Spot in New England - Summit of Mt. Washington" — depict
tourists clad in distinctly late 19th century attire sitting atop New
Hampshire peaks and are marked by painstaking detail; his oil
paintings, on the other hand, reflect a more abstract genius.
Perhaps the most awe-inspiring pieces in the exhibit arc those

of Frederic Church (1826-1900), whose affinity for the sublime in
nature lends his work the sort of raw beauty that Homer's paint
ings lack. The back wall of the exhibit is dominated by Church's
1857 "Niagara," an enormous eye-catching oil painting that de
picts luminescent water cascading over the falls. A rainbow
adorns the crest and, unlike Homer's work, human figures are
nonexistent, which is somewhat odd given that throngs of tourists
would no doubt have been scrambling around the rocks bv the
falls when Church visited them in the 1850s.
None of Church's landscape pieces — including "Campfire,
Maine Woods" (1856), which is so realistic that it can hardly be
distinguished from a photograph — fuse humans and nature;
rather his work is defined by the bright colors and shocking con
trasts most clearly evident in his 1880 work, "Sunset Across the
Hudson," which juxtaposes sheet-white snow in the foreground
with sunlit purple hills in the background. In this way, Church
consciously refused to illustrate an anthropomorphic nature: in
stead he chose to paint nature for nature's sake.
Thomas Moran (1837-1926) did more to popularize this coun
try's Western wonders than any other artist before him. 1 lis paint
ings of Yellowstone's geysers and Yosemite's waterfalls exposed
to Eastern Americans a wilderness that was utterly foreign and
unknown to them. Indeed, many historians credit artists like
Moran and Albert Bierstadt for the sweeping movement to cre
ate U.S. National Parks in the late 19th ccntury.
It is hard to know how Moran's 1874 "Castle Geyser. Upper
Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park," was received by his
patrons in New York and Boston, but we can be sure that the
painting — whose placid blue-green foreground is dominated by
the shining spout of Castle Geyser in the background — was un
like anything Americans living on the east coast had ever seen.
Despite their many and obvious differences, however. Homer,
Church and Moran shared a common ideology: they were fasci
nated by nature, and they used their artistic talents to illustrate itr
beauty to the American people, who themselves were just begin
ning to understand the importance of preserving wilderness.
