WAITER: Welcome to the Dan
dridge Golf and Country Club. I trust
you're enjoying yourself?
FRANCO: Oh. absolutely.
WAITER: Great, great. Can I take
your order?
FRANCO: Oh, yes. So the, uh — the
"Seafood Wrap." Does that come
with a side?
W AITER: Of course — you have the
option of fries, salad or the soup of the
day.
i RANCO: Wonderful. And it comes
in a flour tortilla?
WAITER: Yes, that's right.
I RANCO: How about the suspen
sion of habeas corpus?
WAITER: Excuse me?
1 RANCO: Oh, nothing, nothing.

How about the BLT?
WAITER: What about it?
FRANCO: What's the choice of
breads?
WAITER: Well, we have white,
wheat, sourdough and a low-carb op
tion in a spinach wrap.
FRANCO: Do you have anything a
little more genocidal?
WAITER: Huh?
FRANCO: Oh, no. sorry — I meant
xenophobic.
WAITER: Wait a second —
FRANCO: No, no, no — God. this is
so embarrassing — "mayonnaise." I
meant mayonnaise.
WAITER: You're not . .. one of
those, are you?
FRANCO: What? Oh. God, no.
WAITER: Because you sound a little
like... You know.

FRANCO: No, 1 get that a lot,
though. 1 think it's the hat.
WAITER: I don't know. I mean,
you're always wearing a military uni
form of indeterminate rank.
FRANCO: Well, I was an Army man.
WAITER: There are signs posted all
around the club that describe proper
swimming attire, and yet you insisted
on wearing your epaulets in the pool.
FRANCO: I like the weight on my
shoulders.
WAITER: Plus, there are the banners
you've put up around the clubhouse,
and the cheering, homogenous
crowds of people that constantly posi
tion themselves downhill from you..
CHEERING, HOMOGENOUS
CROWD: (Distantly) Fraaancoooo!
Fraaancoooo!
WAITER:... It all makes you look a
lot like ...

FRANCO: Don't say it.
WAITER: You're one of the Beatles,
aren't you?
FRANCO: Excuse me?
WAITER: You're one of the Beatles!
Oh my God! I can't believe it! Which
one are you? No, don't say it. Let me
guess.
FRANCO: I don't think ...
WAITER: George! No, Ringo! Wait,
which is the other one?
FRANCO: I'm not one of the Beat
les.

WAITER: Play "Yellow

Submarine."

MUSSOLINI and
HITLER: (Enter-
