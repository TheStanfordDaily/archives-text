# No Soup for You

### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION GESTAPO GASTRONOMIS 
When it comes to discussions of food
and dictators, few people can match i

ihe distinction of A 1 Yeganeh,
former owner of Al's Soup j

Kitchen International. De
spite the name of his estab-

lishment, A 1 was hardly in the '
business of feeding the poor.

Rather, his clientele consisted
of those willing to shell out lip

lo $25 for a cup of the best soup I
in Manhattan. If the name is 1
still not ringing a bell, you may
know him better as the "Soup
Nazi" immortalized on Seinfeld.

Many people don't realize it, but

the "Soup Nazi" was actual-

ly based on a real per-

son at a soup

stand on

55 th

him and his soups on the

Street in New York. And while Mr.
Yeganeh took great offense to being
referred to as a Nazi, the portrayal of

show was highly ac-

curate. I first visit-

Ed his restau-

rant around
1999 (the
term restau
rant is used

rather loosely
as it refers to a
retail estab
lishment in
which the
counter ex
tends all the
way to the

' sidewalk such
that customers
arc never actu
ally inside). I

thought I was prepared, having stud
ied that day's menu before getting in
line and having my money in hand.
But after placing my order and ten
dering payment, Mr. Yeganeh asked
me if I had read the sign. I looked to
the side to see a piece of paper with a
single sentence printed in about six
languages: "After ordering, please
stop to the [highlighted, underlined]
EXTREME left." In case there were
any doubts as to what this meant, con
venient yellow footprints had been
painted onto the sidewalk to direct
traffic from the place to order to the
place to wait. Knowing that another
second of hesitation could result in
my soup privileges being revoked, I
quickly complied with the instruc
tions and received my order.
The real question, however, is
whether the soup is really that good.
The answer is yes. Period. It was once
said on Seinfeld that you have to eat
this soup sitting down, and, indeed, if
you tried eating it standing up, your
knees would buckle. The selections

varied day to day. but whether it was
turkey chili, seafood, bisque, mulli
gatawny or Newman's favorite. Jam
balaya, everything was absolutely
first rate.
On subsequent visits, I learned from
my mistakes and developed a reputa
tion as a model customer, a difficult
feat at such an establishment. Fre
quently. when I went at the end of the
day, A 1 would admit that the quality
of the remaining soup had suffered
compared to a few hours earlier, and
he accordingly offered an extra cup of
something else free of charge. And. of
course, his idea of a soup that had
passed its peak quality was still better
than anything served elsewhere.

But alas, like all totalitarian regimes,
be they delicious or genocidal, Al's
run on 55th Street had to come to an
end. One year, I went down on the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving to
get my customary serving of turkey
chili for the next day to find the win
dows covered in newspaper. Rumors

about the fate of everyone's beloved
soup circulated for over a year before
the sad announcement that he would
never reopen.
But hope for Al's followers remains.
National franchising rights were sold
to "The Original Soup Man" which
started with locations in Manhattan
and is slowly expanding west. While
these franchises can never capture the
experience of being served by AJ and
the soup is not quite of the same qual
ity. it is still undeniably good. A line of
prepared gourmet soups is also being
rolled out at retailers across the coun
try. And, finally, for the chefs among
us, a number of recipes are available
online, though their authenticity is
not entirely clear.
So while no customer will ever again
receive an authentic outburst of "No
soup for you!" the amazing soups of
A 1 Yeganeh are not completely out of
reach â€” the legacy of arguably the
greatest dictator in culinary history
lives on.
