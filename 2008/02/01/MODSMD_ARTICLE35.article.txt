# Dictator Derby
## 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION BOOKIE 
Its Dictator V-eek lere at Intermission, and there's no better way to remember some of history's most frightening despots than by pitting them against each other, March Mad
ness-style! In this inaugural edition of "Bracketology," real and fictional tyrants from every corner of the globe will compete on the basis of pure evil, fear-inducing ability and my
arbitrary thoughts. Of course, the bracket is blank, so feel free to make your own picks. Just remember, upsets and Cinderella stories are absolutely necessary â€” anything else
would be, as our #4 seed would say, thoughtcrime.
