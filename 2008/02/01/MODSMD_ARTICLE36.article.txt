## Burial haunts, British Sea Power charts a new course 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION DAVY JONES 
Dictators crave glory, absolute obcdience and legions of loyal followers.
They are, as Doc Freud would say, total egomaniacs. And sadly, rock stars are
often the same way — preening narcissists. British producer Burial, however, is
not a typical rock star. Despite releasing one of the best discs of the past sever
al months, the musician remains completely, happily anonymous. In a rare in
terview with England's "The Guardian." he said of the choice: "1 liked the mys
tery: it was more scary and sexy, the opposite of other music."
Fortunately, Burial's naming principles — mystery, sexiness, originality —
apply equally to his music. The producer's approach creates a dreaminess well
suited for thoughtful alone time. "Untrue," which was originally released in De
cember, is an album composed entirely of clicking beats and textured ambiance.
The anonymous Brit combines choppy percussion reminiscent of Kid A-era
Radiohead the groove of dub-step, and the tender ambiance of Stars of the Lid.
"Archange.," the album's second song, features a series of clipped vocal sam
ples and a sneakilv catchy bass line. Then the gorgeous track "Ghost Hard
ware" layers ethereal moaning, synthesizers, the line "1 can't take my eyes off
you," with the sound of bullet cases (or something metallic) hitting the ground.
Finally, "Etched Fleadplate" stands out the most sonically. Composed of the
same general building blocks. Burial adds a high-pitched vibration that you can
literally feel. The sound/vibration is like an intensified version of your VHS's
rewinding sound that bubbles up out of the song and into your headphones.
With all this amazing musical talent on display, it's hard to believe that Bur
ial choses anonymity In the same interview with "The Guardian." Burial
claimed: "Only about five people outside of my family know 1 make tunes. 1
think. I hope." Musicians, it seems, are not as easy to classify as dictators.
British Sea Power (BSP), unlike Burial, has no inlcntion of staying under the
radar. The band recently released its third album, which is stupidly entitled "Do
You Like Rock Music?" (Note to BSP: Your title is a moot point. If I'm listen
ing to your record, then, yes, I like rock music.) This album, though, is their best
yet. The band occupies the same musical territory as the Clinic or Arcade Fire.
Sonically, they draw on the gloomy but peppy style of Joy Division and Echo
and the Bunnymen. Aesthetically speaking, however, the t>and veers toward
the artiness of David Bowie — witty back stories, confusingly literate lyrics, and
the scattering of leaves onto the stage during their lives performances. The band
members, for instance, only go by a single name such as Yan or Hamilton. This
sort of artiness has given BSP an eccentric image and some success in the British
Isles.
Their first album, cleverly titled "The Decline of British Sea Power," empha
sized British Sea Power's capacity for tightly played punk. Songs like "Apolo
gies to Insect Life" are driven by terse bursts of distortion. BSP's second album,
"Open Season," expanded this idea to include guitar effects, a less caustic atti
tude. and slower rhythms. Basically, they began to sound like U2. (And they
even scored a spot in a massive Target ad campaign aimed at college students.)
With this third album, BSP merges these two musical strands, and amplifies
the band's operatic qualities. The album opens with a Temple of Doom-like
group chant and melancholy church organ. It's as if the listener has inadvertent
ly stumbled upon an ancient cult's secret gathering. Then "Lights Out for Dark
er Skies," the album's best song, bursts out of nowhere with drum fills and a
scorching lead guitar line. Yan, the lead singer, weaves images of darkness/light
and day/night between chiming chords. At the midpoint, the song breaks down
sand then builds up again into a crescendo that would make Bono proud.
From this jumping-off point, the band stays energetic and continues to dab
ble in gloominess. Drums crash, empty space is applied amply, and distortion
churns. By the end, though, BSP switches

gears, as if to cool off, by playing some of
their most beautiful slow-burners to date.
"No Need to Cry" is a gentle ballad built
on reverb. The final song, "We Close Our
Eyes," is a quiet, ambient fade-out that
revives the chanting of the first song -— as
if you've finally escaped from that spooky
secret meeting, but you can still hear it all
fade into the distance as you run away.
Now if only the album title would fade
away with it.
