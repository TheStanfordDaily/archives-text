## Rule your bed with an iron fist 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION MUSSOLINI MISTRESS 
Now, the image of Stalin does not get Roxy hot and ready for

action. This is probably because he was a paranoid mass
murderer, traits Roxy would never want in a lover.
However, there is something appealing about a dicta- i
tor, or being a dictator yourself. The sense of power and
adoration are certain to be invigorating for anyone. The
opportunity to make the laws and enforce them on your
worshipping public makes this role-play very appetizing.
This is why Roxy recommends playing a new role and
being in charge or letting your partner take control.

This docs not require that you are capable of shouting in anoth
er language (although Roxy thinks languages are hot). You sim
ply to tell your partner that you want to try a little role-play and
make the rules. If you are inclined to shouting your orders, Mus
solini style. Roxy recommends finding a quiet place on campus
where your next-door neighbor can't hear you. It is not a good
idea to sexile your roommate for this kind of role-play, and Roxy
has found many empty hidden places on campus to explore. This
is a good opportunity to get out of your comfort zone.
Roxy always thinks that her readers should be dictating the rules
of sexual encounters and knows that you are confident enough to
ask for what you want. And there are some rules you must always
enforce; Roxy is always a dictator when it comes to safe sex. So

once you have satisfied these guidelines.

ture. Therefore, she recom
mends telling your partner to sit

back and relax while you take
control and your partner
bends to your naughty

whims and desires.

Others might find the idea of giving up power and control during
sexual activities to be upsetting, which is why Roxy recommends
doing this with your favorite sexual partner, one you feel safe with
and trust. Make sure that you have discussed this with your part
ner before starting to fulfill your fantasy in order to avoid confus
ing or seriously upsetting him or her. Knock down some barriers
and be vulnerable with your partner with this opportunity to dic
tate the laws of your sexual pleasure. Do you have a position
you've always wanted to try? Well, now you have the opportuni
ty to demand it from your partner, who will probably be more

than willing to appease you.

Taking over and demanding your partner to fulfill all of
your naughty desires can result in some unexpected joy.

Likewise, letting your partner call the shots might be enlight
ening. Not only can this be an immensely pleasurable experi
ence. but it will also educational â€” you may be surprised by the
thoughts your partner has in mind.

Taking on a new persona might just be great practice in act-

ing. and you may find new skills to help you get what you
want. Or, if you're like Roxy, it will fun to pretend to be a dif
ferent person for a sexual romp that will result in incredible
pleasure for both you and your partner. So. enjoy making
your demands and receiving exactly what you want from your
adoring public. Or adore the object of your desire. Roxy is cer
tain that any dictator would approve.
