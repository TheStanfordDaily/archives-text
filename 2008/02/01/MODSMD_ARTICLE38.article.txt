# Six Cardinal Sins

### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION FASHION NAZI 
"In matters of taste," English play
wright and sodomite extraordinaire
Oscar Wilde once remarked, "it is idle
to dispute." Wilde was right. In mat
ters of taste, always subject yourself to
someone who is more tasteful than
you arc — in this case, me. Or you
risk being deported by the fashion po
lice. (Unless you're already an illegal
immigrant, in which case you risk
being deported by, well, the police.)
Here are six styles to avoid, on pain of
death or public humiliation. The lat
ter you inflict on yourself, the former
is inflicted upon you by the fashion
Nazis, if and when they see you.
The American Apparel I-ook (tm)
What could be more pretentious than
trying to look like you just don't care?
Paying 30 bucks a top just so you can
look like you just don't care. Guys:
The skinny-jeans-and-hoodie look is
only worn by gay men struggling to
come out of the closet. Girls: Every
one and I repeat everyone has thought
of the leggings-plus-anything combi
nation. How about actually wearing
something that doesn't say: "I bought
this from American Apparel, I'm so
cool and alternative." Consider, for
example, a constructed parka to keep
you from the cold. Just make sure it's
in a solid print (how about tweed? Or

tartan?), to show that you've got that
tinge of European sensibility.
Colorful Rainwear
Come off it. You're not a three year
old anymore, so please dress your
age. Wearing a Technicolor raincoat
is ridiculous. Wearing a pair of striped
rainboots just screams: "I'm a sucker
for GAP clothes even though they're
poorly designed and poorly made."
Please. Those in the know never have
to resort to such silly means of attract
ing attention. If you really want to
show that you're a savant, I suggest a
simple pair of rainboots in black or a
deep shade of earthy brown, lined
with something luxurious, like Meri
no wool. Uggs need not apply.
Cropped Jackets
Girls, girls, girls. We know that this
look is so in now, right? Wrong. Just
because Forever 21 is making clothes
in a certain style does not mean, as a
rule of thumb, that you should buy
into it. Or even buy it. As a general
guideline. Forever 21 is usually about
three or four seasons behind the
times. In this case, cropped jackets
(and the trompe l'oeil silhouette that
we all love but should not attempt to
pull off) was revived by Nicolas Gh
esquiere at the house of Balenciaga in
fall 2006. You need to stop it right
now and move on with your life.

There arc better was to keep warm,
and you can't go wrong with a simple
jackct that fits your body snugly. A
six-foot-tall supermodel you are not.
Behave like a normal human being.
Unless you are a six-foot-tall super
model, in which case you can do any
thing you want.
The Varsity Sports Look
Guys. Girls. If you resemble someone
who's just stumbled out of bed and
straight into practice at three in the af
ternoon. you've got it wrong. So in
credibly wrong. You need to drag
your sweatpants-ed ass back into your
room, brush your hair, brush your
teeth and get your act together. It isn't
even hard, you know? Swop those
baggy sweats for a pair of jeans, and
put on a sweatshirt that doesn't say
"Stanford." No one really cares about
where you're going to college. And,
oh, people don't really respect you
that much for being an athlete, much
less for looking like one.
Dressing in Bermudas and T-shirts
We get it. You're a macho mary. We
get it. Now turn around, head back to
your room and actually put on some
clothes. It's winter, so act like it's win
ter. It's an opportunity for Californi
ans — or those who live in NorCal, at
least — to actually show off the warm
wear that has to go into hiding the rest

of the year. Stop pretending that it
isn't cold, just because you're "in Cal
ifornia." Last I checked, the weather
was 50 out and it hadn't stopped rain
ing in a week. Isn't that a great excuse
to layer? Guys, repeat after me:
Pants, top, sweater, coat, ill stop look
ing like a goat. Girls, the array of op
tions available to you, so shame on
you if you just look as sloppy as a gap
ing...well. shame on you.
Conspicuous Consumption
You can't help but think to yourself,
"I've got the money, why not spend it
on something expensive?" And you
wouldn't be wrong. There's nothing
wrong with treating yourself to a little
(or a lot of) something. What's wrong
is thinking that wearing something
branded somehow makes you stylish.
And so you load yourself with a bag

from LV, jeans that
look like they're
from Energie, Dior
sunglasses (even
though there's not
much sun in win
ter) and a Burber
ry coat. Which
would be okay, ex
cept that you look
like one of those

no u
ve a u
rich

China dolls who wear too much
makeup. Which is not becoming.
That means you, silly girl in my
I HUM class. Stop being so overblung.
If you're rich, you should spend your
wealth in other more tasteful ways.
