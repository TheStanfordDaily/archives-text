## "Persepolis"-c'est Super! 
### ALEX COLEY INTERMISSION GRAY MATTER 
Marjane Satrapi had no need for technological
gizmos when adapting her graphic novel series
"Persepolis" for the big screen. In fact, with
only a few shades of gray and some unassuming
pencil strokes, Satrapi's delightful film manages
to tantalizes without the assistance of cutting
edge CG, and to set a standard for animated
productions aimed at an older (i.e., non
k Pixar) crowd.

Best described as Satrapi's own coming
of-age tale, "Persepolis" — voiced en
tirely in French — breathes whimsi
cality into its author's incredible life
| story, spanning her childhood in
Tehran during the tumultuous Iran
ian revolution in 1979 to Vienna for

shelter from the war with Iraq

(coinciding with an
equally riotous adoles-
J cence) and several
more intercontinental
and intercultural criss
crossings beyond that.

] The film strikes a remark -
able balance between the

1 personal and the political;
though it's clear that
Satrapi's growth — person
ally as well as ideologically —

cannot be divorced from the
political instability surrounding

her, namely Iran's overthrow of the Shah
and descent into a repressive Islamic state. We
see and appreciate how Marjane is forced to jug
gle standard dilemmas — coming-of-age, loss of
innocence, rebelliousness, depression — and si
multaneously cope with a government that,
among other things, executes your family mem
bers and seeks to regulate every aspect of your
life in the name of purging Western decadence.

Raised by a family of progressive revolutionaries
of a Marxist-Leninist bent, little Marjane grows
up in a hvper politicized environment (for better
or for worse, though it's not for us to judge).
Some of the most touching scenes involve the
early molding of her ideology (unlike her. com
munist parents, she's initially a close associate of
God, with whom she communicates in dreams).
One can't help but wryly smile as she is wrenched
from her bed of clouds in heaven back down to
earth when her parents explain that the Shah was
not. in fact, hand
picked by God but "crowned" by enterprising
Brits who sought Iranian oil. Sadly, learning the
"dark truth" about her government is small pota
toes compared to the unflinching reality of blood
shed that would soon occur right outside her
doorstep, and would shake her family at its roots.
Yet what Satrapi gives us is the life story of a nor
mal human being, albeit one placed in extraordi
nary circumstances. While the grim reality of

bloody revolution, war and militant government
oppression cannot be swept under the rug,
"Persepolis" is at heart a humanistic tale.
To reconcile the simple humanity of falling in and
out of love, for instance, with the gross inhuman
ity of war and repression, "Persepolis" serves up
healthy dollops of humor. No doubt, much of
Satrapi's young life is incontrovertibly bleak. But
well-placed humor makes "Persepolis" a joy to
watch, and we realize that a fulfilling experience
can be carved out of any life, no matter how bad
things get. One memorable scene involves
punked-out and rebellious teenaged Marjane
weaving through a throng of cassette-tape "deal
ers" on the street, stopping at last to pick up the
latest Iron Maiden album like it's the hottest
class-A drug on the market. Now recall that
everything is drawn up in primitive pencil
sketches, and the images become yet more
bizarre, but all the more engrossing.
Oftentimes the events are lesscomedic. Tragedy

strikes again and again,
hut it never becomes
senseless for us or for
Marjane — in fact, the
plain blacks, whites and
grays on the screen
scream "futility" the loud
est. When her life is put in
danger, Marjane heads
over to Europe, where she
begins a happy and frivo
lous (by her standards)
life in the company of
characters — angst-rid
den wannabe-anarchists,
loopy retired academics,
to name a few — but
Satrapi's impression of
free, secular Europe is
hardly rosy. Above all,
Marjane runs against uni
versal issues about her
own identity and sense of
place, shuttling between
cultures and never fitting
in anywhere. To make
matters worse, her luck
with the opposite sex is lu
dicrously poor no matter
what continent she's on.
Marjane's grandmother,
the film's all-knowing
(and witty, feminist, eter
nally hip) Voice of Rea
son, offers the tried and
true advice: "Be true to
yourself," which nearly al
ways works, though, as
you can imagine, a repres
sive government can
make self-expression a
difficult task. The film's
other message, which goes
hand in hand with its fresh

and carefree aesthetic, is better left in French:
"Pourquoi pas?" Why not. indeed? Satrapi cer
tainly thought so, when first dreaming up this
most unlikely of artistic creations. I'he final prod
uct is stunning.




"Persepolis" is currently playing at
the Aquarius Theater in downtown
Palo Alto.
