# String of burglaries hits GovCo
## Thieves make off with students' laptops, prying open locked doors 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
A string of burglaries hit multiple dorms in Sterling Quad
yesterday afternoon. The alleged assailants pried open the doors
to students' rooms and made off with several laptops among
other items.
At least six rooms in Potter, Schiff and Adams were broken
into. The thieves stole multiple laptops, an iPod and a digital
camera, most of which were reportedly recovered after campus
police pursued the suspects to Granada.
Stanford police were unavailable for comment at press time.
The robberies occurred in quick succession sometime
between 1 and 2:30 p.m. The main target of the assailants was
the students' laptops — they stole every laptop they encoun
tered, while other items of value in the students' rooms were
ignored.
"My roommate had taken [her laptop! to class, thankfully,"
said Potter resident Maya Choksi '10, whose laptop was stolen.
"My jewelry was also out on my desk but they didn't take it. It
looks like it was just laptops that they were after."
Following her discovery that she had been robbed, Choksi
and her friends, including one whose laptop was also stolen,
waited on the first floor of Potter for police to arrive. I lowever,
officers available at the time were busy responding to a tip that
the assailants were passing through West Lag.
Stephanie Sy '11. a resident of Schiff, lives in one of four side
by-side rooms that were broken into and burglarized. Her lap
top was taken, as well as her digital camera. But when officers
arrived at the scene, she was informed that a camera bag match
ing her description had been recovered along with other items
— including at least one laptop — near Granada.
According to Sy, she and her four dorm mates had no reason
to suspect that there was a significant risk of their property
being stolen when they left for class and that their laptops "were
just on desks, open."
