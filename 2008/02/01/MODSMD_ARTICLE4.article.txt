# String of burglaries hits GovCo
## Thieves make off with students' laptops, prying open locked doors 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
A string of burglaries hit multiple dorms in Sterling Quad
yesterday afternoon. The alleged assailants pried open the doors
to students' rooms and made off with several laptops among
other items.
At least six rooms in Potter, Schiff and Adams were broken
into. The thieves stole multiple laptops, an iPod and a digital
camera, most of which were reportedly recovered after campus
police pursued the suspects to Granada.
Stanford police were unavailable for comment at press time.
The robberies occurred in quick succession sometime
between 1 and 2:30 p.m. The main target of the assailants was
the students' laptops — they stole every laptop they encoun
tered, while other items of value in the students' rooms were
ignored.
"My roommate had taken [her laptop! to class, thankfully,"
said Potter resident Maya Choksi '10, whose laptop was stolen.
"My jewelry was also out on my desk but they didn't take it. It
looks like it was just laptops that they were after."
Following her discovery that she had been robbed, Choksi
and her friends, including one whose laptop was also stolen,
waited on the first floor of Potter for police to arrive. I lowever,
officers available at the time were busy responding to a tip that
the assailants were passing through West Lag.
Stephanie Sy '11. a resident of Schiff, lives in one of four side
by-side rooms that were broken into and burglarized. Her lap
top was taken, as well as her digital camera. But when officers
arrived at the scene, she was informed that a camera bag match
ing her description had been recovered along with other items
— including at least one laptop — near Granada.
According to Sy, she and her four dorm mates had no reason
to suspect that there was a significant risk of their property
being stolen when they left for class and that their laptops "were
just on desks, open."
Similarly, Choksi stated that she
did not feel that there was anyone
or anything unusual in the dorm
when she left her room. She did,
however, claim that she had noticed
several strange individuals around
the dorm in the days preceding the
robbery but said that the episodes

had not concerned her because
many strangers had been in and out
of Potter in reccnt weeks to deal
with the plumbing problems.
She added that the unlocked
doorways linking Sterling Quad
dorms would make a multiple bur
glary spree like this one easier than
it would be in other residences.
"It's pretty easy to get into the
[Sterling Quad] dorms," she said.
"Once you get into one of them,
they all connect."
Following the break-ins. repair

men were called to the scene to
immediately repair the doors and
locks of the burgled rooms, many of
which had been significantly dam
aged upon forced entry. Student
Housing officials cautioned the rest
of the Sterling Quad student com
munity to take extra precaution
against break-ins, including keeping
doors locked and refusing to allow
strangers into dorms.
