## Congress investigates endowment 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's endowment grew nearly 22 per
cent last year to $17.1 billion. This massive
quantity of tax-free money has attracted the
attention of members of Congress, who want
the wealthiest universities to do more to
reduce tuition costs.
The Senate Finance Committee is pressur
ing universities to use more of their wealth for
financial aid and is threatening to require them
to "pay out" five percent of their endowments
each year. In an attempt to prevent
Congressional intervention, wealthy universi
ties have rushed to expand financial aid.
Harvard has recently increased its financial aid
for families earning up to $180,(MX) a year,
while Yale has boosted funds for families with
annual incomes of up to $2(X),(XX).
Additionally, Stanford is expected to
announce further financial aid initiatives by
the end of winter quarter.
Tile committee, which helps determine
national tax policies, is worried about the rising
cost of higher education and has requested
detailed information from the nation's wealth
iest colleges and universities, including
specifics about tuition, financial aid and
endowment spending.
The demands come after a new study,
released last week by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers
(NACTJBO), which shows double-digit

endowment growth at hundreds of colleges
over the past year. According to the study, 136
colleges in the United States now have endow
ments of $500 million or more.
"(Universities are] supposed to offer public
benefit in return for the privilege of tax
exemption," said member of the Senate
Finance Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R
-lowa), in a public statement. "If endowments
increase by double digits from one year to the
next, it raises the idea that maybe these schools
aren't using enough of their endowments to
help students afford college."
However, Randy Livingston, vice president
for business affairs and the University's chief
financial officer, explained that Stanford's
endowment has been built up through the sup
port of donors who have specific requirements
for their donations. He explained that the
donors usually require that the gift must be
invested and held in perpetuity, with only the
investment income expended each year to sup
port the gift's purpose.
Additionally, the endowment is composed
of over 6,000 distinct funds, each of which has
different restrictions imposed by the donors.
Some of the endowment funds are designated
to support undergraduate scholarships or
graduate fellowships, while others support fac
ulty salaries through endowed professorships,
specific areas of research, academic programs,
centers and institutes.
