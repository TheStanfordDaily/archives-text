## Congress investigates endowment 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's endowment grew nearly 22 per
cent last year to $17.1 billion. This massive
quantity of tax-free money has attracted the
attention of members of Congress, who want
the wealthiest universities to do more to
reduce tuition costs.
The Senate Finance Committee is pressur
ing universities to use more of their wealth for
financial aid and is threatening to require them
to "pay out" five percent of their endowments
each year. In an attempt to prevent
Congressional intervention, wealthy universi
ties have rushed to expand financial aid.
Harvard has recently increased its financial aid
for families earning up to $180,(MX) a year,
while Yale has boosted funds for families with
annual incomes of up to $2(X),(XX).
Additionally, Stanford is expected to
announce further financial aid initiatives by
the end of winter quarter.
Tile committee, which helps determine
national tax policies, is worried about the rising
cost of higher education and has requested
detailed information from the nation's wealth
iest colleges and universities, including
specifics about tuition, financial aid and
endowment spending.
The demands come after a new study,
released last week by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers
(NACTJBO), which shows double-digit

endowment growth at hundreds of colleges
over the past year. According to the study, 136
colleges in the United States now have endow
ments of $500 million or more.
"(Universities are] supposed to offer public
benefit in return for the privilege of tax
exemption," said member of the Senate
Finance Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R
-lowa), in a public statement. "If endowments
increase by double digits from one year to the
next, it raises the idea that maybe these schools
aren't using enough of their endowments to
help students afford college."
However, Randy Livingston, vice president
for business affairs and the University's chief
financial officer, explained that Stanford's
endowment has been built up through the sup
port of donors who have specific requirements
for their donations. He explained that the
donors usually require that the gift must be
invested and held in perpetuity, with only the
investment income expended each year to sup
port the gift's purpose.
Additionally, the endowment is composed
of over 6,000 distinct funds, each of which has
different restrictions imposed by the donors.
Some of the endowment funds are designated
to support undergraduate scholarships or
graduate fellowships, while others support fac
ulty salaries through endowed professorships,
specific areas of research, academic programs,
centers and institutes.

He added that even though
Stanford's endowment has experi
enced exceptional growth, one must
not assume that high returns will
continue indefinitely.
"Over the past 10 years, |the
endowment) has achieved an invest
ment return averaging 15.1 percent
per year." he said. "These returns
have been remarkable and unusual
by long-term historical standards.
However, Stanford cannot count on
continuing to earn these strong
investment returns into the future."
Livingston pointed to the 19705, a
period during which Stanford's
investment returns failed to exceed
the level of endowment payout plus
inflation, and, as a result, the value of
the University's endowment
declined substantially.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.

"82 also stated that the way the
University spends its money is based
on the goal of intergenerational
equity.
"Investment returns on the
endowment have to cover the cur
rent payout and also grow the princi
pal to keep up with inflation," he
said. "If they don't, we would end up
spending down the endowment and
cheating future students."
Nonetheless, according to the
University's Budget Plan for 2007-
2008, the Board of Trustees has
decided to increase the target
endowment payout rate from 5 per
cent to 5.5 percent. However, even
though the target payout rate might
be 5.5 percent, the University will
not always achieve that rate.
Etchemendy explained that one
reason why the University's payout
rate may not appear to be in keeping
with the rate of the endowment
growth is due to the "smoothing"
rule.
"Universities use different
smoothing formulas." he said. "The

simplest is to pay out 5 percent of
the endowment's average value for
the last three or four years. But they
all have the effect that when the
investment returns are high, the
actual payout rate falls short of the
target rate, and when they are poor,
the actual rate is higher than the tar
get rate. That's how they smooth the
actual payout."
Private universities such as
Stanford are also forced to contend
with a lack of government funding.
In 2007, 30 percent of the
University of California's non-hos
pital revenue came from the state
general fund and only 2 percent
from endowment income. By con
trast. none of Stanford's revenue
came from state general funds,
while roughly 20 percent came
from its endowment.
"Endowment income is to private
universities what state tax revenue is
for public universities," Etchemendy
said. "Some people have suggested
that endowment revenue should be
taxed for large endowments. But this

would be like taxing state general
funds flowing to public universities if
they exceed a certain amount."
Even though there are many fac
tors involved in determining the
amount of money the University
spends from its endowment each
year, Livingston said that the
University intends to respond fully
to Congressional demands. Debra
Zumwalt, general counsel for the
University and vice president of the
Office of the General Counsel,
explained that committees such as
the Senate Finance Committee can
hold hearings, conduct investigations
in their areas and propose legislation
to be voted on by Congress.
"The Finance Committee has
jurisdiction to the extent that chari
table organizations are exempt from
federal taxation," Zumwalt said.
However, she stated that even
though the Senate Finance
Committee's demands are not in the
form of a subpoena, the University
had provided information to the
committee informally in the past

and will continue to do so.
Furthermore, according to feder
al law. most private foundations are
required to pay out 5 percent of
their assets each year toward their
charitable purpose. No such require
ment exists for university endow
ments. Donations to universities are
tax-exempt, and endowment funds
are tax-exempt. Zumwalt said that
the problem arose because some
foundations, whose only income was
from their endowments, were
spending no money at all and, there
fore, doing nothing to further their
charitable mission.
"That is not the case with univer
sities," she said. "[They] clearly
spend huge amounts of money each
year for education and research,
including money from endowment
income, gifts, research funding,
tuition payments and other income."
This feeling was echoed by
Etchemendy, who said that there are
two ways to look at financial aid. He
explained that any endowment
which allows the University to

enhance the education it provides is
a form of financial aid, since it
improves the quality of the educa
tional program without charging
that enhancement to tuition.
"[The] endowment holds the
quality of the educational program
fixed." he said, "but reduces the cost
for those students who can't afford
full tuition [as well as improves] the
quality of the program, while hold
ing the tuition fixed for all students,
whether they receive explicit finan
cial aid or not." â€¢
Officials were quick to point out
that the issue of the University's
endowment is a complex one which
could be adversely affected by an
economic downturn.
"[lt] doesn't mean universities are
hoarding their endowment,"
Etchemendy added. "They're just
practicing responsible budgeting
principles. Who wouldn't like more
money to spend?"

ing universities to use more of their wealth for
financial aid and is threatening to require them
to "pay out" five percent of their endowments
each year. In an attempt to prevent
Congressional intervention, wealthy universi
ties have rushed to expand financial aid.
Harvard has recently increased its financial aid
for families earning up to $180,(MX) a year,
while Yale has boosted funds for families with
annual incomes of up to $2(X),(XX).
Additionally, Stanford is expected to
announce further financial aid initiatives by
the end of winter quarter.
Tile committee, which helps determine
national tax policies, is worried about the rising
cost of higher education and has requested
detailed information from the nation's wealth
iest colleges and universities, including
specifics about tuition, financial aid and
endowment spending.
The demands come after a new study,
released last week by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers
(NACTJBO), which shows double-digit

endowment growth at hundreds of colleges
over the past year. According to the study, 136
colleges in the United States now have endow
ments of $500 million or more.
"(Universities are] supposed to offer public
benefit in return for the privilege of tax
exemption," said member of the Senate
Finance Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R
-lowa), in a public statement. "If endowments
increase by double digits from one year to the
next, it raises the idea that maybe these schools
aren't using enough of their endowments to
help students afford college."
However, Randy Livingston, vice president
for business affairs and the University's chief
financial officer, explained that Stanford's
endowment has been built up through the sup
port of donors who have specific requirements
for their donations. He explained that the
donors usually require that the gift must be
invested and held in perpetuity, with only the
investment income expended each year to sup
port the gift's purpose.
Additionally, the endowment is composed
of over 6,000 distinct funds, each of which has
different restrictions imposed by the donors.
Some of the endowment funds are designated
to support undergraduate scholarships or
graduate fellowships, while others support fac
ulty salaries through endowed professorships,
specific areas of research, academic programs,
centers and institutes.

He added that even though
Stanford's endowment has experi
enced exceptional growth, one must
not assume that high returns will
continue indefinitely.
"Over the past 10 years, |the
endowment) has achieved an invest
ment return averaging 15.1 percent
per year." he said. "These returns
have been remarkable and unusual
by long-term historical standards.
However, Stanford cannot count on
continuing to earn these strong
investment returns into the future."
Livingston pointed to the 19705, a
period during which Stanford's
investment returns failed to exceed
the level of endowment payout plus
inflation, and, as a result, the value of
the University's endowment
declined substantially.

"82 also stated that the way the
University spends its money is based
on the goal of intergenerational
equity.
"Investment returns on the
endowment have to cover the cur
rent payout and also grow the princi
pal to keep up with inflation," he
said. "If they don't, we would end up
spending down the endowment and
cheating future students."
Nonetheless, according to the
University's Budget Plan for 2007-
2008, the Board of Trustees has
decided to increase the target
endowment payout rate from 5 per
cent to 5.5 percent. However, even
though the target payout rate might
be 5.5 percent, the University will
not always achieve that rate.
Etchemendy explained that one
reason why the University's payout
rate may not appear to be in keeping
with the rate of the endowment
growth is due to the "smoothing"
rule.
"Universities use different
smoothing formulas." he said. "The

simplest is to pay out 5 percent of
the endowment's average value for
the last three or four years. But they
all have the effect that when the
investment returns are high, the
actual payout rate falls short of the
target rate, and when they are poor,
the actual rate is higher than the tar
get rate. That's how they smooth the
actual payout."
Private universities such as
Stanford are also forced to contend
with a lack of government funding.
In 2007, 30 percent of the
University of California's non-hos
pital revenue came from the state
general fund and only 2 percent
from endowment income. By con
trast. none of Stanford's revenue
came from state general funds,
while roughly 20 percent came
from its endowment.
"Endowment income is to private
universities what state tax revenue is
for public universities," Etchemendy
said. "Some people have suggested
that endowment revenue should be
taxed for large endowments. But this

would be like taxing state general
funds flowing to public universities if
they exceed a certain amount."
Even though there are many fac
tors involved in determining the
amount of money the University
spends from its endowment each
year, Livingston said that the
University intends to respond fully
to Congressional demands. Debra
Zumwalt, general counsel for the
University and vice president of the
Office of the General Counsel,
explained that committees such as
the Senate Finance Committee can
hold hearings, conduct investigations
in their areas and propose legislation
to be voted on by Congress.
"The Finance Committee has
jurisdiction to the extent that chari
table organizations are exempt from
federal taxation," Zumwalt said.
However, she stated that even
though the Senate Finance
Committee's demands are not in the
form of a subpoena, the University
had provided information to the
committee informally in the past

and will continue to do so.
Furthermore, according to feder
al law. most private foundations are
required to pay out 5 percent of
their assets each year toward their
charitable purpose. No such require
ment exists for university endow
ments. Donations to universities are
tax-exempt, and endowment funds
are tax-exempt. Zumwalt said that
the problem arose because some
foundations, whose only income was
from their endowments, were
spending no money at all and, there
fore, doing nothing to further their
charitable mission.
"That is not the case with univer
sities," she said. "[They] clearly
spend huge amounts of money each
year for education and research,
including money from endowment
income, gifts, research funding,
tuition payments and other income."
This feeling was echoed by
Etchemendy, who said that there are
two ways to look at financial aid. He
explained that any endowment
which allows the University to

enhance the education it provides is
a form of financial aid, since it
improves the quality of the educa
tional program without charging
that enhancement to tuition.
"[The] endowment holds the
quality of the educational program
fixed." he said, "but reduces the cost
for those students who can't afford
full tuition [as well as improves] the
quality of the program, while hold
ing the tuition fixed for all students,
whether they receive explicit finan
cial aid or not." â€¢
Officials were quick to point out
that the issue of the University's
endowment is a complex one which
could be adversely affected by an
economic downturn.
"[lt] doesn't mean universities are
hoarding their endowment,"
Etchemendy added. "They're just
practicing responsible budgeting
principles. Who wouldn't like more
money to spend?"

Stanford's endowment grew nearly 22 per
cent last year to $17.1 billion. This massive
quantity of tax-free money has attracted the
attention of members of Congress, who want
the wealthiest universities to do more to
reduce tuition costs.
