## MPAA backtracks on file sharing claims News comes in wake of RIAA settlement claims 
### KATHERINE COX SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
College students made up the
biggest slice of the film industry's
pie chart for illegal movie down
loads until recently. Now
Hollywood is revising its numbers.
Ilie Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA) announced in
2005 that college students were
responsible for 44 percent of lost
revenue on movie sales in the U.S.
through their illegal downloading
activities. The compelling statistics
— detailed in the MPAA's study on
the international impact of movie
piracy — underpinned an anti
piracy campaign targeting student
offenders and urging universities
to tighten their file-sharing poli
cies.
This January, however, the
MPAA announced that L.E.K.
Consulting, the firm it hired to con
duct this study, made a crucial mis
calculation. It now estimates that
only 15 percent of its revenue loss
stems from college students. 'Ilie
MPAA chalks up the 29 percentage
point mistake to "human error."
Associate Information Security
Officer David Hoffman, of
Stanford's Information Security

Office (ISO), is wary of any statis
tics generated by the MPAA in
regards to illegal downloading.
"We have no way of verifying
them," he said. "I don't think any
one knows what the real numbers
are."
In Hoffman's view, even the
more recent conservative estimate
— which will be examined by a
"third party" consultancy along
with the remainder of the 2005
study —is subject to doubt
because he says there is no way for
the public to know how the figures
were obtained.
The ISO responds to complaints
directed at Stanford students by
what it has termed "bounty
hunters" — companies that work
in conjunction with the recording
and film industries to identify and
target copyright offenders.
Hoffman explained that parts of
the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA), which was passed in
1998, oblige Stanford to field and
investigate these claims.
"Our view of it is all driven by
complaints." he said. "We don't
police the Stanford network for
[copyright] infractions."
Although lawmakers have
recently pressured campuses to
adopt technology and protocol for
preventing copyright infringe
ments by students. Hoffman main-
tains that the ISO's operations
have not changed, as they are pri
marily dictated by the DMCA. He
added that the MPAA, which is
pushing a measure in Congress
that would require universities to
equip themselves against peer-to
peer piracy, exerts no influence
over the way Stanford responds to
complaints.
"We don't act under their direc
tion except to the extent they are
often the ones filing complaints,"
he said. "They don't get to tell us
what to do."
Because the ISO does not
answer to the MPAA. Hoffman
anticipates that the Association's
computational error will have little
bearing on the way his department
administers fees and penalties to
Stanford students who download
movies illegally.
But copyright holders may get
more bang for their buck by filing
lawsuits against students directly
rather than acting through the ISO.
According to Staff Counsel
Lauren Schoenthaler of the Office
of the General Council, in the past
eight months the Recording
Industry Association of America
has brought claims against 34
Stanford computer users. She esti
mates that settlements for these
claims amount to $ 100.000 collec
tively.
The University, Schoenthaler
believed, disapproves of the way
the industry has used isolated cases
to intimidate other infringers.
"Stanford disfavors the record
ing industry's current litigation
campaign because it targets a few
individuals with harsh conse
quences, but it does not seem to be
making a marked change in file
sharing behaviors in general," she
said in an email to The Daily.
Schoenthaler fears that students
will gain a false sense of security
when they learn that the MPAA
has overstated their role in the dig
ital piracy problem.
"I worry that students will let
their guard down because of this
error and not think about file-shar
ing consequences," she said.
As a legal advisor. Schoenthaler
is privy to the personal tragedy that
can accompany the seemingly de
personal, often anonymous act of
downloading a movie or song.
"Stanford students who have
been sued." she said, "have come to
my office in agony and literally cry
ing and have considered dramatic
solutions to the recording indus
try's claims, such as bankruptcy or
returning to a home country."
"I think that I may be one of
the few people who does see the
suffering this campaign is causing
to individuals," she added,
"because there does not seem to
be a lot of talk about it in the
broader Stanford student commu
nity."
