## MPAA backtracks on file sharing claims News comes in wake of RIAA settlement claims 
### KATHERINE COX SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
College students made up the
biggest slice of the film industry's
pie chart for illegal movie down
loads until recently. Now
Hollywood is revising its numbers.
Ilie Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA) announced in
2005 that college students were
responsible for 44 percent of lost
revenue on movie sales in the U.S.
through their illegal downloading
activities. The compelling statistics
— detailed in the MPAA's study on
the international impact of movie
piracy — underpinned an anti
piracy campaign targeting student
offenders and urging universities
to tighten their file-sharing poli
cies.
This January, however, the
MPAA announced that L.E.K.
Consulting, the firm it hired to con
duct this study, made a crucial mis
calculation. It now estimates that
only 15 percent of its revenue loss
stems from college students. 'Ilie
MPAA chalks up the 29 percentage
point mistake to "human error."
Associate Information Security
Officer David Hoffman, of
Stanford's Information Security

Office (ISO), is wary of any statis
tics generated by the MPAA in
regards to illegal downloading.
"We have no way of verifying
them," he said. "I don't think any
one knows what the real numbers
are."
In Hoffman's view, even the
more recent conservative estimate
— which will be examined by a
"third party" consultancy along
with the remainder of the 2005
study —is subject to doubt
because he says there is no way for
the public to know how the figures
were obtained.
The ISO responds to complaints
directed at Stanford students by
what it has termed "bounty
hunters" — companies that work
in conjunction with the recording
and film industries to identify and
target copyright offenders.
Hoffman explained that parts of
the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA), which was passed in
1998, oblige Stanford to field and
investigate these claims.
"Our view of it is all driven by
complaints." he said. "We don't
police the Stanford network for
[copyright] infractions."
Although lawmakers have
recently pressured campuses to
adopt technology and protocol for
preventing copyright infringe
ments by students. Hoffman main-
