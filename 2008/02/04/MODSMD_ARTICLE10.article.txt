# STUDENT LIFE
## Obama favorite of campus voters 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
With Super Tuesday approach
ing, Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.)
appears to be the overwhelming
favorite among Stanford students —
but many remain undecided about
their candidate of choice in the
upcoming primary elections.
Of 138 decided voters surveyed
over the past week. Obama gar
nered the largest share of the votes
with 60.9 percent, followed by Sen.
Hillary Clinton (26.1 percent) and
Sen. John McCain (5.1 percent).
Nearly a quarter (23.6 percent)
of students polled, however, said
they were still undecided.
Decided female voters surveyed
preferred Clinton at more than
twice the rate of decided male vot
ers (31.3 percent as compared to
14.6 percent). Otherwise, voting
preferences did not differ notably
across class year or gender.
Two hundred and fifty students in
Tresidder Union. Old Union. Stern
Dining and Moonbean's Coffee
were randomly approached and
asked to complete paper surveys.
Participants marked the candidate
they planned to vote for in the pri
mary elections, with additional
options including "1 prefer not to
answer," "I have not decided yet"
and "1 will not be voting in the pri
maries."
The sample of 250 students
included 53 self-reported freshmen,
31 sophomores, 47 juniors. 51 seniors
and 63 graduate students. Of those
who reported gender. 73 men and 88
women completed the survey.
Because the polling locations
biased the sample, this data is not
statistically significant and is not
necessarily representative of the stu
dent population at large.
