## Thinking "big" about health Weekend conference speakers address education, human rights 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four percent of women worldwide have a college
degree. Forty percent of women are married before the
age of 18. The entire country of Malawi has 10 obstetri
cian-gynecologists for a country of 12 million.
These concerns, among others, were tackled at
thinkßlG. a three-day event organized in an effort to
"mobilize our generation" to take action for interna
tional women's health and human rights.
Student organizers were inspired to launch the
event after taking a sophomore seminar on interna
tional women's health taught by Human Biology Prof.
Anne Firth Murray.
Approximately 40 Stanford students, almost all of
them women, piled into Tresidder's Oak Room Friday
night, as Murray kicked off the conference with her

opening talk. She said that Stanford was a prime place
tor thinkßlG, since Jane Stanford insisted on coeduca
tion at the University from the very beginning.
Murray said that dire problems affecting women
have been hidden, and urged students to light against
inequality.
"1 exhort you to move forward without fear and
with open minds," she said.
Lauren Bishop '10, an organizer of the event, also
addressed those in attendance.
"The thing that excites me most about thinkßlG is
that there will be something for everyone," she said.
"For some, the conference will be an orientation to
women's issues. For others, it will be a couple of days in
a life's work dedicated to women."
ThinkßlG activities continued throughout the
weekend. Four Saturday panels —along with a "BIG
Picture" discussion featuring four keynote speakers
focused on women's education and health.
"You educate a girl, you educate the future," said
writer and photographer Amanda Jones at the Girls'
