## Law clinic argues immigrant rights 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Itie Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic
and the ACLU began arguing their case before the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month in a landmark
case challenging the government's right to indefinitely
detain immigrants fighting their immigration cases.
Jayashri Srikantiah. director of the Stanford
Immigrants' Rights Clinic, served on a legal team chal
lenging the Department of Homeland Security for
incarcerating four immigrants in California pending
legal challenges to their deportations.
One of the men. Amadou Lamine Diouf, was incar
cerated for almost two years before an immigration
judge ordered his release.
"I was separated from my wife and career for almost
two years because of an innocent mistake in the filing of
my immigration papers," said Diouf in a statement pub
lished by the Stanford Law School. "I'm not a danger to
society. All I want is to be with my wife and get a job."
The case has the potential to set a precedent in the
United States regarding the legality of detaining immi
grants indefinitely while the government investigates
their legal status.

Srikantiah has extensive experience defending immi
grants. both as the director of the Immigrants' Rights
Clinic at Stanford, and in previous work as an attorney
for the ACLU of Northern California.
Under Srikantiah's supervision, students regularly
have the opportunity to represent immigrants whose
lives arc interrupted by their immigration status. They
have participated in efforts to prevent the deportation
of non-citizens with criminal convictions, obtained asy
lum protection for non-citizens fleeing persecution and
assisted immigrant survivors of domestic violence in
gaining lawful status in the United States.
Julie Smolinski J.l). '07. described her experience at
the clinic as "the most significant learning experience of
my time in law school."
As part of her clinical internship, Smolinski helped
defend a victim of domestic violence who faced depor
tation.
"She was young — supported four children on her
own." Smolinski said. "She had been through some hor
rendous experiences. It really showed me how privileged
I have been. I was thrilled when we were able to secure
relief for [her]."
