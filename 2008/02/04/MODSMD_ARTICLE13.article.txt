Stanford will inherit the late
paleontologist Stephen J. Gould's
collection of notebooks, papers and
other items that served as source
materials for the scientist's hun
dreds of articles and books.
Gould, who died of cancer six
years ago, began his career as an
evolutionary biologist and won
fame by publishing over a dozen
books about evolution for a popular
audience. He held a triple profes
sorship at Harvard in biology, geol
ogy and the history of science.
Gould and his wife visited
Stanford in 2001, and they proposed
the creation of digital editions of his
work to Stanford librarians.
Curators hope to find where
Gould got his inspiration by study
ing the notes he scribbled and the
passages he underlined.
The collection is likely to include
samples of Gould's vast collection
of embossed airline coffee cups.
