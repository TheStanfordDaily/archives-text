## Editorial Board Yes on Prop 93 
### 
Of all propositions on this year's Cali
fornia ballot, few are as confusing yet
important as Proposition 93.
Dubbed the 'term limits' bill. Proposition
93 addresses the controversial topic of how
many years a person can spend serving in the
California legislature. Currently, potential
legislators can spend up to 14 years in the
legislature, with a maximum of six years in
the Assembly and eight years in the Senate.
Proposition 93 proposes to cut the total
number of years a legislator can serve from
14 years to 12. but it would also allow legisla
tors to serve all of their time in a single body.
One of the strongest criticisms of Califor
nia's current policy is that politicians do not
have enough time to complete any long term
projects before they are forced to switch leg
islative houses. As a result, there are few leg
islators with enough experience to push big
projects through the complicated politics
and bipartisan haggling that tends to bog
down bills.
Newly elected politicians must expend
their efforts learning their new jobs, losing
valuable time that could be spent forging the
new friendships and alliances necessary to
gain legislative clout. This extreme turnover
rate, coupled with short election cycles, pre
vents any long-term projects from getting
off the ground. Consequently, politicians are
often reluctant to push any controversial
legislation, as they are already forced to
think about their next position soon after
thev are elected.

Proposition 93 addresses this problem by
allowing legislators to serve a substantially
longer period of time in a single house, mak
ing it possible to gain the experience and bi
partisan support necessary to get bigger and
more important legislation through.
Critics of Proposition 93 accuse it of
being a naked power grab by incumbent leg
islators. With the passing of the proposition,
42 current legislators, whose terms would ex
pire under the current rules, would be al
lowed to run for re-election.
While some legislators will undoubtedly
benefit in the short run from this proposi
tion. the rule change actually increases total
term limits in the long run from 14 years to
12. Furthermore, the passage of this bill does
not guarantee that incumbent legislators
will retain their positions, as they will still
have to run for re-election.
Proposition 93 is the correct step in ad
dressing the unforeseen consequences that
arose from the introduction of term limits.
By allowing legislators to spend more time
in an individual house, we will give them the
opportunity to spend time working on more
important bipartisan legislation, all while
keeping the original purpose of term limits
alive and well.This is not a massive reform of
the system enacted as a legislative power
grab. Rather, it is an amendment that will
turn a good idea into a better one and will
benefit California in the long run.The Stan
ford Daily Editorial Board advises its read
ers to vote YES on Proposition 93.
