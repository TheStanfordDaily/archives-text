# Co-terminal Illness
## An unusual opportunity 
### 
If Barack Obama doesn't win the Democ
ratic primary, many young voters may
find themselves on the sidelines come
November.
Let's get one thing straight.The high De
mocratic turnouts thus far are not entirely
due to Obama's candidacy, but it would be
foolish to deny him most of the credit. It's
clear that if the Democrats don't nominate
Obama, they will be forfeiting a big advan
tage in voter enthusiasm.
They would effectively be turning their
backs on blocs of voters who don't usually
participate. In short, the Democrats would
be throwing away one of the biggest oppor
tunities the party has had in a long, long
time.
If you attended one of the two major
Obama events on campus last week, you
know what I mean. Having been at Stanford
five years now. I know how hard it is to get a
couple hundred students to show up for any
thing resembling a political rally. We've had
cynicism wired into our brains courtesy of
"The Colbert Report." Most of us are not
about to let ourselves get suckered into
dirtying our hands with a political process
built on sloganeering and hypocrisy.
That's why it was so interesting to watch
the cognitive dissonance exhibited by the
crowds at these events. On the one hand, we
were loath to join in the prescribed cheers of
"Fire it up!" and "Oh-oh-oh-Obama!" Most
people just politely applauded or stood with
their arms crossed. On the other hand, we
were genuinely mesmerized to hear speak
ers talking about "politics" without any hint
of sarcasm.
For those of you who might be interested
in Obama's candidacy (or anyone's, for that
matter) but are turned off by all the cheering
and sign-waving, I'd say it's high time to let
go of your political chastity. I'd also ask you
to listen to what Larry Marshall, an Obama
supporter and professor at the law school,
has to say.
At Friday's well-attended rally in White
Plaza, Prof. Marshall talked about being too
young to vote for JFK and RIK in the '60s
and how thankful he is to be able to vote for
Obama now. He talked about how misguid
ed it is to try to "meet the Rush Limbaughs
on the other side with a Rush Limbaugh of
our own."
I My curiosity piqued. I went to talk with
Prof. Marshall at his office, which is decorat
ed with headlines from the Chicago Tribune
and the Sun-Times, back when the dysfunc
tional death penalty system made our state
look like a backwater. As an Illinois native. I
remember the news coverage myself.
To illustrate what is so unique about
Obama, Prof. Marshall told a story about
representing Rolando Cruz, a man who
spent 10 years on Illinois' death row before

his conviction was overturned.
"There was a big furor about whether this
man was innocent," Marshall said."The assis
tant attorney general believed he was, so she
went to the attorney general. Roland Burris,
an African-American man who seemed to
have his eye on the governorship."
Prof. Marshall said that Burris, a Democ
rat, then consulted with his political advisors,
who deemed the case a lose-lose situation.
"The last thing an African-American
man could afford to be was soft on crime,"
Marshall explained.
A few years later, Obama, another
African-American Democrat, "stuck his
neck out" by working with the deeply un
popular Republican Gov. George Ryan to
champion a package of death penalty re
forms that included new rules about video
taping police confessions, eyewitness identi
fication and the use of jailhouse informants.
Rather than being perceived as soft on
crime, those reforms are now seen as helping
to spark a national dialogue about the death
penalty.
So, at a time when Hillary Clinton is
making hay out of her supporting role as
first lady, Marshall's story about death
penalty reform in Illinois redefines what
the debate over "experience" is really
about. Marshall knows first-hand how it
takes the right person to capitalize on an
opportunity
As students, we've got to get beyond
our suspicion about signing on to any
movement, a suspicion that exists for good
reason but too often boils down to a self
interested fear of giving up the perks of
our hip aloofness. To those of you who
point out that Obama himself has become
a paragon of hipness. I d say: Sure, the
Black Eyed Peas made a video about him
but, come on. politics will never be as cool
as apathy. It always involves putting your
self on the line.
That's why tomorrow is so important. As
Prof. Marshall, referring to the infrequency
of inspiring presidential candidates, told stu
dents on Friday: "You have four days to
avoid another 40 years in the desert."
Make that one day. Professor.

Brendan promises that his regular column
with Dave Herbert (starting on Wednesday)
won't he so preachy. Send him your cynicism
