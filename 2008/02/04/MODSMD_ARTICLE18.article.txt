trust anyone over 30" —
lthis iconic mantra of the 1960s
belonged to my parents' genera
tion when they were my age. While it has al
ways been the societal role of young people
to modestly rebel, the baby boomers were es
pecially zealous in the disrespect-for-elders
department. Understandable.The old people
of that time could legitimately be considered
the enemy. They were drafting the nation's
youth into a wildly unpopular war, imposing
unreasonably rigid standards of social behav
ior, marginalizing minorities like crazy, and
generally doing their best to preserve a de
cidedly shitty status quo.
But that was then — are things any dif
ferent now? Well, yes and no. In a turn of
tragic irony (and philosophical acrobatics),
the "Don't trust anyone over 30" advice is
now self-contradicting, and as it plummets
into middle-agedness itself, it seems in
creasingly quaint and old-fashioned. How
could I possibly distrust everyone in the
over-30 crowd? They seem like nice people.
They make far better music than the cur
rent 20-somethings. And what about my
parents, my professors, my employers, my
doctors and my beloved, elderly New York

Times columnists? (Even that feisty Mau
reen Dowd is 56!) In many ways, I need
their guidance and support.

But in just as many ways, they seem, dare

preciate the advice of those more experi

But at the same time, I tend to secretly won

email attachments could possibly provide
relevant counsel on more complicated mat

Today's life is indeed complicated, and it's
complicated precisely because things like
email attachments are requisite survival
skills. In the past 20 years, modern technolo
gy has exploded onto the contemporary
landscape of our lives in a totally permeating.

totally permanent way.
And this technology explosion threatens
to irreparably rip us from the previous gener
ation. just like the cultural revolution did in
the 19605. While there's no major ideological
gap. there certainly is a major technology gap.
and it's not just about a discrepancy in skills or
expertise, like my parents' generation thinks
it is. The difference is far deeper — the
"knowing-how" kind of understanding that is
gained from a facility for technology signifi
cantly affects how we think in general.
Case in point: when a discussion arrives
upon a disputed fact.such as whether English

that those less fluent with search engine tech

the readily ascertained fact forever. In this
way, what seems to be splitting hairs over
proficiency with a tool reveals a veritable
gorge between how the technophobes and
the technophiles consider and engage in the
