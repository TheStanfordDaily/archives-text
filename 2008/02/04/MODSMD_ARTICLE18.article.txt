## Generational gaps and bridges

trust anyone over 30" —
lthis iconic mantra of the 1960s
belonged to my parents' genera
tion when they were my age. While it has al
ways been the societal role of young people
to modestly rebel, the baby boomers were es
pecially zealous in the disrespect-for-elders
department. Understandable.The old people
of that time could legitimately be considered
the enemy. They were drafting the nation's
youth into a wildly unpopular war, imposing
unreasonably rigid standards of social behav
ior, marginalizing minorities like crazy, and
generally doing their best to preserve a de
cidedly shitty status quo.
But that was then — are things any dif
ferent now? Well, yes and no. In a turn of
tragic irony (and philosophical acrobatics),
the "Don't trust anyone over 30" advice is
now self-contradicting, and as it plummets
into middle-agedness itself, it seems in
creasingly quaint and old-fashioned. How
could I possibly distrust everyone in the
over-30 crowd? They seem like nice people.
They make far better music than the cur
rent 20-somethings. And what about my
parents, my professors, my employers, my
doctors and my beloved, elderly New York

Times columnists? (Even that feisty Mau
reen Dowd is 56!) In many ways, I need
their guidance and support.

But in just as many ways, they seem, dare
I say.obsolete. Yes, I respect the views and ap
preciate the advice of those more experi
enced than 1 am. (That would be you. Mom.)
But at the same time, I tend to secretly won
der how someone who hasn't quite mastered
email attachments could possibly provide
relevant counsel on more complicated mat
ters. (Mom. this one is totally hypothetical.)
Today's life is indeed complicated, and it's
complicated precisely because things like
email attachments are requisite survival
skills. In the past 20 years, modern technolo
gy has exploded onto the contemporary
landscape of our lives in a totally permeating.

totally permanent way.
And this technology explosion threatens
to irreparably rip us from the previous gener
ation. just like the cultural revolution did in
the 19605. While there's no major ideological
gap. there certainly is a major technology gap.
and it's not just about a discrepancy in skills or
expertise, like my parents' generation thinks
it is. The difference is far deeper — the
"knowing-how" kind of understanding that is
gained from a facility for technology signifi
cantly affects how we think in general.
Case in point: when a discussion arrives
upon a disputed fact.such as whether English
is the official language of the United States,
or what kind of chemical process is used to
clean canned mandarins, 1 am instinctively
compelled to JFGI (Don't know what that
stands for? Google it!). Meanwhile, it seems
that those less fluent with search engine tech
nology are content to sit around and debate
the readily ascertained fact forever. In this
way, what seems to be splitting hairs over
proficiency with a tool reveals a veritable
gorge between how the technophobes and
the technophiles consider and engage in the


Caitlin
Mueller
world.
But what do I care if there is such
a gorge, chasm, ravine or even full
blown generational abyss, whether
it's due iO technology or anything
else? I'm Little Ms. Modern,after all:
It's all "out with the old, in with the
new" in my camp. It seems I might be
fine with just leaving the aged and ir
relevant to wallow in their antiquat
ed incompetence while the super
powered youth merrily charge the
technological revolution forward
into an e-blissful future.
But that would be silly for a num
ber of reasons. First, that's not a very
nice way to treat your parents, young
lady. Second, there are scant years
remaining before Little Ms. Modern
approaches a potentially aged and ir
relevant existence herself. (Transla
tion: the big three-oh.) And most im
portantly, abandoning the previous
generation would entail cutting off

the supply of one of humanity's most
precious resources: our own experi
ence.
Just as our elders desperately
need us to program their cell phones
and guide them through PowerPoint,
we desperately need them. Our love
affair with technology is indeed a
great thing, and it will lead us to great
places. But the road ahead is still per
ilously humpy, and technology pro
vides quite a few of its own bumps as
well. In light of these guaranteed ad
versities, we would be agonizingly
foolish to rebuff the help of the pre
vious generation's problem solvers,
who have already proven their drive,
resilience, passion and effectiveness.
And in direct contrast to the old
rally cry of our parents, the key to in
tergenerational cooperation is pre
cisely trust. We have to trust that
their brains haven't turned to mush,
and they have to trust that our souls
haven't been too busy watching
MTV to properly form. Despite our
significant differences, we still have
more in common than not, and we
generally share the nontrivial goal of
saving our world from ruin. The

achievement of this goal depends
critically on overcoming our genera
tional prejudices and appreciating
the contributions of humans of all
ages.

great thing, and it will lead us to great
places. But the road ahead is still per
ilously humpy, and technology pro
vides quite a few of its own bumps as
well. In light of these guaranteed ad
versities, we would be agonizingly
foolish to rebuff the help of the pre
vious generation's problem solvers,
who have already proven their drive,
resilience, passion and effectiveness.
And in direct contrast to the old
rally cry of our parents, the key to in
tergenerational cooperation is pre
cisely trust. We have to trust that
their brains haven't turned to mush,
and they have to trust that our souls
haven't been too busy watching
MTV to properly form. Despite our
significant differences, we still have
more in common than not, and we
generally share the nontrivial goal of
saving our world from ruin. The

achievement of this goal depends
critically on overcoming our genera
tional prejudices and appreciating
the contributions of humans of all
ages.
