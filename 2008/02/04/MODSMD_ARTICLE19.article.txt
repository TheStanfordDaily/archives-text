## What's in a name? 
### 
Before we embark on a 14-week-long
relationship, reader, I need to tell
you a little story. A story about my
name. If we're going to rendezvous once a
week over soft-boiled eggs and soggy
peaches, you need to know my name. It's
only fair.
Once upon a time, my mother, a sucker
for symmetry, wanted my name to start
with the same letter as hers and my fa
ther's. That wish, coupled with a fondness
for the "West Side Story" actress Natalie
Wood, led her to the name Natalie. But be
cause she loves being different even more
than she loves her symmetry, she made it a
name of her own. 'Cause Everyone's Free
in America.
My name is Nuh-tall-ee. Rhymes with
folly, jolly and deciduous holly. It is not
Natasha. It is not Natalia. And it is most
certainly not Naaah-duh-lee.
Those were the names that were in
evitably assigned to me on the first days of
each elementary school year. While little
Susie and Bobby were lost in thoughts

about what kind of chocolate would be nes
tled in their Lunchables, I was paralyzed
with the knowledge that I would soon have
to correct the teacher as she droned
through roll call.
I blamed my mother for this unneces
sary anxiety. She had taught me not to cor
rect adults and yet had given me this mess
of a name. She also didn't believe in Lunch
ables. The nerve.
While other people have the luxury of
having a middle name to fall back on in
such moments of crisis, I wasn't so lucky. I
have no middle name. I used to wonder if it
meant my parents were lazy. But now I re
alize they just didn't care.
Eventually. I got used to the correction

process. By the time middle and high
school rolled around, my friends would
chime out the pronunciation before 1 did as
we moved from one class period to another
during the first week of school. 1 would
even get scowls from younger Natalies who
inherited both my teachers and my burden:
Now they had to reprogram their teachers
to say the name the right way.
And so 1 have learned to love my name.
I am simply not a normally pronounced
Natalie. 1 like that 1 can't be labeled with a
nametag. ITiat there was never anyone in
class with my name. That in the unlikely cir
cumstances that 1 ever become someone
worth Knowing,capital K, people will have
to take the time to learn how to say my
name. Like Yeats. Or Goethe. Or Gunther.
I have become grateful to my mother for
what 1 once viewed as a burden. And now
that I know what sodium is, I also under
stand why she didn't believe in Lunchables.
I must admit that the title of this column


Natalie
