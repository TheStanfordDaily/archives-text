### MIMA MOHAMMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Fired up! Ready to go!" shouted a crowd of
about 300 Stanford students who gathered in
White Plaza at noon on Friday for the campus'
latest display of Obama-fever.
The hourlong rally organized by Stanford
Students for Barack Obama featured a host of
speakers including Steve Westly. former State
Controller and co-chairman of Obama's cam
paign; Law Prof. Larry Marshall; and Richard
Danzig, a lawyer, former navy secretary and a
current advisor to Senator Obama's campaign.
Speakers discussed their personal experiences
with Obama and how he had inspired them.
Rally-goers received free "Barack the Vote"
T-shirts and Stanford student organizers led
campaign cheers such as "O-bama O-eight!"
Devon Swezey '08 kicked off the rally by
telling stories about his voter turnout efforts on

the frontline of the campaign trail in lowa and
Nevada.
Swezey went door-to-door in one of the poor
est neighborhoods in Reno. Nev., meeting with
voters who had never participated in their state's
caucus. He was especially moved when he and
other Stanford students convinced a 65-year-old
veteran living in a motel to caucus for the first
time.
"People want to believe in this country
again," Swezey said, drawing cheers from the

crowd. "Obama encourages people to he better
than themselves."
Referencing Obama's avowed desire to
bridge the divide between different political fac
tions, Westly said the Senator is not afraid to
work against the grain and eschew conventional
partisan politics. He recalled sitting through one
of Obama's early campaign meetings in which
the Senator chose to spend his time campaigning

Several hundred students gathered in White Plaza at noon on Feb. 1 to show their support for 2008 presidential hopeful Barack Obama (D-lll.).
in a megachurch in California's
conservative Orange County rather
than visiting more traditionally lib
eral areas of the state, such as the
Bay Area.
Other speakers addressed
Obama's claim that he will provide
principled leadership.
Marshall spoke of his time
working with then-Senator Obama
in Chicago, and said the candidate
issued an indictment of the war in
Iraq even before the initial
Congressional vote to authorize
the war.

"We looked at each other in the
audience and we thought to our
selves, 'That's the end of his politi
cal career,'" Marshall said.
Many Stanford students cheered
and waved Obama signs through
out the speeches.
Rally-goer Rebecca Perez *08
was enthused about Obama's can
didacy.

"He speaks with a sense of
urgency to solve the issues affecting
the Latino community that have
long been ignored by politicians,"
she said.
The event also drew students
like Wes Mateo '08, who said he
was not certain whom he would
vote for in the California primaries.
"1 came out today because 1 had

never attended a political rally of
any sort," Mateo said. "1 usually
think anecdotes about the candi
dates are trite, but 1 think since the
speakers addressed particular mat
ters, that made an impression on
me."
