Nevada.
Swezey went door-to-door in one of the poor
est neighborhoods in Reno. Nev., meeting with
voters who had never participated in their state's
caucus. He was especially moved when he and
other Stanford students convinced a 65-year-old
veteran living in a motel to caucus for the first
time.
"People want to believe in this country
again," Swezey said, drawing cheers from the

crowd. "Obama encourages people to he better
than themselves."
Referencing Obama's avowed desire to
bridge the divide between different political fac
tions, Westly said the Senator is not afraid to
work against the grain and eschew conventional
partisan politics. He recalled sitting through one
of Obama's early campaign meetings in which
the Senator chose to spend his time campaigning
