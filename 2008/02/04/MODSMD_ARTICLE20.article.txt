## The 						halfway point 
### 
Like most things in life, the Pac
-10 season has gone by in a blur.
We're already midway through
the season, meaning that each team
has played every other team in the
conference once.
While the conference has lived up
to its billing as being the deepest in
the nation, it lacks depth at the top —
the conference has a mere three
teams in the nation's top-25.
'ITiat being said, the season has still
been plenty exciting. After UCLA
and Stanford at the top two spots, six
of the conference's teams are only
separated by a single game. And
though it seems as if the No. 5 Bruins
have a stronghold on the conference
race, our very own Stanford Cardinal
is only a game back in the standings
after a signature victory at Washing
tort State.
But I digress. Without further ado,
here is my midseason report and
awards for the Pac-10:
Player of the Year: Kevin Love, UCLA
Ibis is a tough one, because Brook
Lopez has probably carried his team
more than any other player. Despite
that, the simple fact which remains is
that Love is the best player on the
conference's best team. He's averag
ing 18 points and 12 boards a game,
and is the best passing big man in bas
ketball (yes,including the NBA).
Freshman of the Year:
Kevin Love, UCLA
Plenty of other deserving candi
dates, but 1 can't give Love Player of
the Year without giving him Fresh
man of the Year, can I?
Surprise Team of the Year: Stanford
Arizona State would have been a
good selection for this two weeks into
the conference season, but the Sun
Devils are fading as the season wears
on. The Cardinal was picked to finish
fifth in the conference and seen as a
fringe top-25 team by many. Despite
the doubts, the team is on a five-game
winning streak and looks progres
sively better with each victory.
And here's the good news: Juniors
Anthony Goods and Lawrence Hill
have yet to regain their shooting form
of last year. If they start to heat up. the
Cardinal will be that much better.
Most Underrated Player:
Jon Brockman, Washington
Mired in mediocrity up in the
Northwest, junior forward Jon
Brockman is quietly putting together
a remarkable season. The bruising
post player averages 1K.6 points and
11.2 rebounds, although most people


Salisbury

Above the Rim
outside of the state of Washington probably
haven't seen him play. Brockman is a prototypical,
hard-nosed big man. While he doesn't have the
skills of a Kevin Love or the shooting touch of a
Brook Lopez, he has a never-ending motor and
toughness which accounts for his lofty numbers.
Most Improved Player: Russell Westbrook, UCLA
The UCLA guard went from averaging 8 min
utes and 3 points a game last year to 12 points,3 re
bounds and 5 assists a night this season. Standing at

6-foot-3, Westbrook is a spark plug for the Bruins,
throwing down dunks over much bigger opponents
and playing some of the best on-ball defense in the
conference. Many analysts have speculated that
despite other Bruins such as Josh Shipp, Darren
Collison and the heralded Kevin Love — the
sophomore may be the team's best pro prospect.
Biggest Disappointment: Washington State
There are a number of viable candidates —
think Oregon, who started the season at No. 12 in
the country — but it's fair to say give the Cougars
the (dis)honor.Wazzu was undefeated and ranked
in the nation's top-5 coming into conference play.
I laltway into the Pac-10 schedule, the Cougars find
themselves at 5-4. Stanford beat them at their own
game yesterday.grinding out a plodding victory up

in Pullman on Saturday.
Team to watch: Stanford
There might be a slight bias here, but it's only
appropriate when considering this paper's reader
ship. TTiat said, Stanford will be an interesting team
to watch down the stretch. The Cardinal doesn't
win pretty, but it wins. The team finds itself at 18-3
and 7-2 in conference play with a solid chance at
getting a top-four seed in the NCAA Tournament.
And who knows? The team is only one game
behind UCLA in the conference standings. Like
they say, crazier things have happened ... Just ask
Tom Brady and the Patriots.
