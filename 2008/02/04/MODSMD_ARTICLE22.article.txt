# CARD AVENGES LOSS TO UCLA
## Pedersen scores career-high 28 in 75-62 win 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Just as Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
predicted after Thursday's rout of USC. much
of the action in the No. 7 Cardinal's 75-62 win
on Saturday over UCLA came down low.
In one of Stanford's most physical contests
of the year, faces were elbowed, players were
hacked and a plethora of scrums for halls —
loose or not — ensued. 'ITie teams had 39
fouls between them; the main culprit was
freshman Regina Rogers of UCLA, who
fouled out in the second half. The Maples
crowd let her, the Bruins and the referees hear
their disgust over the roughness of the game.
" They are a very physical team, both inside
and on the perimeter." said VanDerveer.
However, Stanford (19-3, 9-2 Pacific-10
Conference) hardly backed down: Sopho
more guard JJ Hones was relentless on de
fense. while freshman forward Kayla Peder
sen had a career game with 28 points and 10
rebounds on 13-for-18 shooting.
"I wanted to be the aggressor." said Peder
sen. "I don't like people pushing me around."
UCLA (11-11,6-5 Pac-10) took an early 9-
2 lead to start the game, relying on the shoot
ing of senior guard Erica Tukiainen. Stanford
also had problems finishing down low. a trend
reminiscent of the USC game.
Sophomore center Jayne Appel had per
haps her worst offensive game since the last
time the two teams met on Jan. 4. when the
Bruins handed the Cardinal its worst loss of
the season. 69-56. She managed only nine
points on 3-for-10shooting from the field.and
was 3-for-8 from the foul line.
But Pedersen. playing the best game of her
collegiate career, was instrumental in the Car
dinal's first half resurgence. After senior
guard Candice Wiggins hit a three-pointer to
bring Stanford within a point, Pedersen
knocked down four consecutive layups to
keep pace with UCLA. Following a timeout
with 7:12 left in the first half and the Cardinal
trailing 20-19, Wiggins and Pedersen teamed
up to retake the lead and push the margin to
nine points at the half.
"We didn't panic and we stayed together,"
said Wiggins. "You're not necessarily going to
beat a team in the first five minutes."
The Cardinal put the game away in the sec
ond half, going on a 23-5 run to start the peri-

GAME NOTES: Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen is
coming off a career-high 28 points on 13-of-18 shoot
ing against the Bruins. Senior guard Candice Wiggins
followed up her record-breaking performance on
Thursday with 31 points of her own against UCLA.
Stanford is now one game out of first place with seven
games left on the conference schedule.
od. An exasperated Kathy Olivier, UCLA's
coach, was called for a technical foul during
the run which only aided the Cardinal attack.
The Bruins did all they could to stop the Car
dinal by employing an effective full-court
press, and double-teaming the guards.The lat
ter strategy failed, however, as it often left
Pedersen open in the post.
Still, UCLA was able to climb back into
the game, cutting Stanford's lead into the
teens. Van Derveer — who was forced to leave
her starters in the game — was not pleased.
"We played very well in spurts, and played
very poorly in spurts," she said. "We got a 20-
point lead and didn't build on that."
Hie Cardinal defense stymied the UCLA
offense down the stretch, while Pedersen and
Wiggins sealed the game with timely jumpers,
layups and foul shots.
Wiggins had one of her best games of the
season, scoring 31 points on 45 percent shoot
ing from the field to lead the Cardinal — she
also went 11-for-12 from the charity stripe,
leading the team with 5 assists.
She and Pedersen were the only Cardinal
to score in double digits; only five players
scored at all.

Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen drives past a UCLA defender in the Cardinal's 75-62 victory on
Saturday. Pedersen had 28 points while senior guard Candice Wiggins scored 31.
However, the rest of the team was
able to contribute defensively and on
the boards. Stanford held UCLA to
just 32.3 percent shooting for the
game. They blocked 12 shots and
stole the ball seven times.
The Cardinal out-rebounded
UCLA, 44-35, including 16 by Appel
and 10 by Pedersen, five of which
came on the offensive glass. Appel
added five blocks.
Despite being sick, senior forward
Lindsey Pluimer scored 16 points 6-
tor-20 shooting to lead the Bruins.
Pedersen was charged with defend
ing Pluimer, UCLA's best player, and
did so effectively. The rest of the
UCLA offense was no better — after

her aforementioned early baskets,
TUkiainen scored only four more
points, and no other Bruin reached
double digits.
With the win, the Cardinal has suc
cessfully avenged their two January
losses to UCLA and USC.
"1 think they had a little chip on
their shoulder," said Pluimer.
The Cardinal is now only one
game behind No. 9 Cal in the Pac-10
standings. Stanford hasn't lost since
the Southern California road trip
over a month ago.
"Every game for us is playing for
the Pac-10 Championship," said Van-
Derveer.
Stanford will now embark on a
three-game road trip before wrap
ping up its home schedule against the
Arizona schools in two weeks.
