# Late rally lifts No. 7 Stanford
## Cardinal comes from behind after 2-0 deficit 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Late in the third game on Satur
day night, it looked like the No. 7
Stanford men's volleyball team
was facing another disappointing
loss against the Ball State Cardi
nals. But a sudden turnaround in
that game and a fourth-game
comeback propelled Stanford into
a tie-breaking fifth, where the Car
dinal pulled out an exhilarating 28-
30,25-30,30-22,31-29,15-11 win.
"We're a young team that is
looking for an identity and we're
slowly finding it." Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "Tonight put us
back on the path to where we want
to be at the end of the season; not
necessarily the level of play, but
how we competed tonight."
Sophomore Evan Romero's ca
reer night lifted the Cardinal (7-4,
4-4 MPSF) to victory. Romero had
34 kills on the night at a .355 hitting
percentage. Not only did Romero
score the most points for the Cardi
nal. his enthusiasm on the court
boosted the team, bringing the
Burnham Pavilion crowd on their
feet.
"He is just energy," Kosty said of
Romero. "That's how he is all the
time. That's his personality, that's
how he plays. He had a great match
tonight."
"During the game 1 was mostly
caught up in the match." Romero
said."But personally I just had a lot
of fun. We had a pretty tough week,
you could say, with the loss to Pacif
ic, but 1 was really happy about that
win.
"We went with a lot of different
lineups and everybody played
hard. We were getting a lot of peo
ple the chance to play and I was just
excited to be out there playing with
the guys."

But in the fourth it was Ball State
taking command early, pushing a 7-7
tie to an 11-7 lead after four straight
Stanford hitting errors. Down 25-20 in
a must-win game, the Cardinal did not
stop fighting, stringing together a 6-1
run to tie the game. Ball State had
match point at 29-28. but a Ceran kill
tied it again. Romero gave Stanford
game point and Williams served an
ace that dribbled over the net for a 31-
29 win.
With the momentum from that
turnaround, the Cardinal jumped
ahead in the fifth game and did not
look back. Ceran's 10th kill of the
night gave Stanford the 15-11 win.
Behind Romero's 34-kill per
formance, Shoji was second for
Stanford with 12 while Ceran added
10. Patrick Durbin led Ball State
with 25.

Three freshmen started the match
for Stanford — outside hitter Gar
rett Dobbs and middle blockers
Charley Henrikson and Max 1 lalvor
son. Dobbs notched 6 kills and an
ace, while Henrikson had a team
high 4 blocks and Halvorson had the
first ace of his career.
"We have good competition in the
gym," Kosty said of his rotating start
ing lineup. "Everybody has to play
well because there is somebody be
hind him that can do a good job. It's a
situation where Garrett Dobbs
earned a starting position and played
well tonight."
Junior setter Miki Groppi dished
out 69 assists while Shoji was the
team's leading digger with 11. Ceran
chipped in nine digs and junior
libero Jarod Keller had eight.
"Jarod Keller had a solid match
for us," Kosty said. "He was great,
both communicating and organizing
the team on the floor and with his
passing and defense."
Though Stanford missed nearly
30 serves to Ball State's 18, most of
those misses were early in the match

— and six players combined for nine
aces. Williams, Ceran and Christof
fers each had two to lead the team.
"[Serving is] an interesting statis
tic," Kosty said. "We want to serve
aggressively and when we are hot we
can score some points. In the first
two we were not. but in the last three
we were serving very well."
The win should provide Stanford
with some momentum going back
into MPSF play next week.The Car
dinal will be at home again next
week, hosting UC-Santa Barbara on
Friday and No. 6 Cal State North
ridge on Saturday. On the road two
weeks ago. Stanford swept the Gau
chos and was swept by the Matadors.
"It will be huge for us." Romero
said. "We play a lot of different guys
and we had two starting for the first
time in Max and Garrett. It was a
real team effort and everybody
helped out. Getting a five-game win
like that over a good team will defi
nitely help us later in the season."

can score some points. In the first

we were serving very well."

Late in the third game on Satur
day night, it looked like the No. 7
Stanford men's volleyball team
was facing another disappointing
loss against the Ball State Cardi
nals. But a sudden turnaround in
that game and a fourth-game
comeback propelled Stanford into
a tie-breaking fifth, where the Car

looking for an identity and we're
slowly finding it." Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "Tonight put us
back on the path to where we want
to be at the end of the season; not
necessarily the level of play, but
how we competed tonight."

reer night lifted the Cardinal (7-4,
4-4 MPSF) to victory. Romero had
34 kills on the night at a .355 hitting
percentage. Not only did Romero
score the most points for the Cardi
nal. his enthusiasm on the court
boosted the team, bringing the
Burnham Pavilion crowd on their
feet.
"He is just energy," Kosty said of
Romero. "That's how he is all the
time. That's his personality, that's
how he plays. He had a great match
tonight."
"During the game 1 was mostly
caught up in the match." Romero
said."But personally I just had a lot
of fun. We had a pretty tough week,
you could say, with the loss to Pacif
ic, but 1 was really happy about that
win.
"We went with a lot of different
lineups and everybody played
hard. We were getting a lot of peo
ple the chance to play and I was just
excited to be out there playing with
the guys."
