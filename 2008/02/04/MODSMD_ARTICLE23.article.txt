# Late rally lifts No. 7 Stanford
## Cardinal comes from behind after 2-0 deficit 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
Late in the third game on Satur
day night, it looked like the No. 7
Stanford men's volleyball team
was facing another disappointing
loss against the Ball State Cardi
nals. But a sudden turnaround in
that game and a fourth-game
comeback propelled Stanford into
a tie-breaking fifth, where the Car
dinal pulled out an exhilarating 28-
30,25-30,30-22,31-29,15-11 win.
"We're a young team that is
looking for an identity and we're
slowly finding it." Stanford coach
John Kosty said. "Tonight put us
back on the path to where we want
to be at the end of the season; not
necessarily the level of play, but
how we competed tonight."
Sophomore Evan Romero's ca
reer night lifted the Cardinal (7-4,
4-4 MPSF) to victory. Romero had
34 kills on the night at a .355 hitting
percentage. Not only did Romero
score the most points for the Cardi
nal. his enthusiasm on the court
boosted the team, bringing the
Burnham Pavilion crowd on their
feet.
"He is just energy," Kosty said of
Romero. "That's how he is all the
time. That's his personality, that's
how he plays. He had a great match
tonight."
"During the game 1 was mostly
caught up in the match." Romero
said."But personally I just had a lot
of fun. We had a pretty tough week,
you could say, with the loss to Pacif
ic, but 1 was really happy about that
win.
"We went with a lot of different
lineups and everybody played
hard. We were getting a lot of peo
ple the chance to play and I was just
excited to be out there playing with
the guys."
