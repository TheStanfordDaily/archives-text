## Giants shock perfect Pats in Super Bowl XLII 
### BARRY WILNER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GLENDALE, Ariz. - With the
Super Bowl on the line, look who had
the perfection thing down Pat: Eli
Manning and the road-conquering
New York Giants. And what a beauty
their 11th straight road victory was, a
17-14 Super Bowl win Sunday that
shattered the New England Patriots'
unblemished season.
In one of the biggest upsets in Super
Bowl history. Manning, New York's un
likely Mr. Cool, hit Plaxico Burress on
a' 13-yard fade with 35 seconds left. It
was the Giants' fourth consecutive
postseason away win and the first time
the Patriots tasted defeat in more than
a year.
"1 don't rank them [losses]." Patri
ots coach Bill Belichick said. "It's dis
appointing."
Phe Giants had the perfect answer
for the suddenly imperfect Patriots: a
big, bad defense and the improbable
comeback led by Manning. Yes, Eli
Manning, who outplayed league MVP
Tom Brady and furthered the family
legacy one year after older brother
Peyton led Indianapolis to the title.
"That's a position you want to be
in." said Manning, who followed Pey
ton's MVP performance last year with
one of his own. "You can't write a bet
ter script.There were so many big plays
on that drive."
The Patriots were done in not so
much by the pressure of the first un
beaten season in 35 years as by the
pressure of a smothering Giants pass
rush. Brady, winner of his first three
Super Bowls, was sacked five times,
hurried a dozen more and at one point
wound up on his knees, his hands on his
hips following one of many poor
throws in New England's lowest
scoring game of the season.
Hardly a familiar position for
the record-setting Pat riots and
their megastar quarterback. This
time, it wasn't the Patriots hut the
Giants making the game-winning
rally. Hiis time, the unflappable
quarterback making the clutch play
wasn't Brady but Manning, who
had been booed by Giants fans for
most of his four seasons for a lack
of emotion.
That it was Manning taking that
knee was stunning. He showed the
maturity and brilliant precision late
in the game usually associated with,
well. Brady.
The first 19-0 season was right
there.
Eli and the Giants snatched it
away.
