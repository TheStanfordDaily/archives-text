# Stanford 67, Washington State 65 (OT)
## Cougars caught No. 14 Stanford tops No. 9 Wazzu in overtime thriller 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
Neither 10 missed foul shots, 17 turnovers nor
an Anthony Goods ankle injury were enough to
halt No. 14 Stanford, who came away with a 67-65
overtime victory at No. 9 Washington State on
Saturday.
The Cardinal did not seal the victory until
Cougar guard Taylor Rochestie missed a layup,
bothered by the outstretched arms of Brook
Lopez. I\vo players on each team fouled out in an
emotional match-up that went right down to the
wire.
"You sit there, watch both teams hustling after
each rebound, getting physical, guys hitting the
floor — it was a great game," said Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson.
Junior forward Lawrence Hill —playing per
haps his best game of the season — led the offen
sive charge with 18 points, including 4-of-6 from
three-point range. Hill passed well early and
played excellent defense on guard Kyle Weaver in
the second half.
"(Hill| shot the ball with confidence. He got
good shots, open looks and didn't hesitate,"
Johnson said. However, the head coach down
played the game's significance as a potential

GAME NOTES: With a 7-2 conference record, Stanford is sec
ond-place in the Pac-10 by two full games. Junior forward
Lawrence Hill may have gotten out of his shooting slump
on Saturday against the Cougars. Hill had 18 points on 6-
for-11 shooting; he also went 4-of-6 from long range and
hit two critical three-pointers down the stretch.
breakout performance for Hill. "Like I've been
saying all year, just because he wasn't shooting
well doesn't mean he wasn't playing well."
I till, always the modest player, passed the cred
it along to his teammates. "Today was a boost for
my confidence — this year's been a step back
from the last," he said. "But it was mostly listening

so that's important."
Brook Lopez echoed Hill's point.
•"My teammates did a great job." the
sophomore big man said. "Fred espe
cially picked us up." Lopez struggled
from the field, shooting 4-for-16, but
managed 18 points on 10-for-12 free
throw shooting. He also pulled down
seven rebounds and altered the
Cougars' offensive attack with 5
blocks.
Senior guards Kyle Weaver and
Derrick Low led the way for the
Cougars. Weaver shot 15-for-19 from
the foul line en route to a 23-point. 11 -
rebound double-double before foul
ing out. Low scored 19 for Washington
State, including 7 points in a one
minute stretch to give the Cougars a
50-44 lead with 7:22 remaining. Once
Stanford slid Washington from
Weaver to Low on defense and
switched Hill onto Weaver, however,
the Cardinal shut the two down and
climbed right back into the game.
Washington State opened the sec
ond half with a 26-21 lead and quickly
stretched their advantage to 9 on a
Robbie Cowgill dunk with 18:38 re
maining. The Cougars also led by 9
after a Kyle Weaver layup with 13 min
utes left, but Stanford battled back
each time to keep the deficit to single
digits.
Stanford took their first lead since
the game's opening seconds when
they went ahead 56-54 on two Brook
Lopez foul shots with 59 seconds left.
In the remaining minute of regula
tion, the teams combined to shoot 2-8

from the foul line. Cowgill and Mitch
Johnson both missed two key foul
shots with the opportunity to gain
some ground, and Weaver missed his
second free throw with 9 seconds left
and the score tied at 56. Brook
Lopez's off-balance shot and senior
forward Taj Finger's attempted put
back both fell just short in Stanford's
final possession to send the game to
overtime.
Stanford took an early overtime
lead when Brook Lopez passed out of
a double team to find Finger on a clean
cut into the lane for a layup. Finger
then fouled out on a questionable call,
but Robin Lopez re-entered the game
in his place and quickly contributed.
His running jumper in the lane with 12
seconds remaining gave him 4 points
in the final period and put Stanford
ahead by 3. After Rochestie's miss,
Washington leapt in the air in celebra
tion.
Despite a game fraught with emo
tion and 45 total foul calls, the team
never lost its cool.
"I told [the team] to keep their
composure and poise — the only guy
who can lose his composure is me,"
said Trent Johnson.
Even with that admission, the
coach was unfazed by the 17
turnovers. "Taking care of the ball and
executing against this [Washington
State] team is hard," Trent Johnson
said."l'm not going to have a heart at
tack if Mitch or Fred is trying to make
a play. [Kyle] Weaver's the best de
fender in the conference."
Stanford improved to 18-3 and 7-2
in the Pacific-10 Conference, solidify
ing its second-place standing in the
