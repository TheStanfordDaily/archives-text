# Students gear up for Tues. primaries
## Some groups face apathy, supporters rally around Obama 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
As the "Super Tuesday" 2(X)S
presidential primaries approach in
22 states, campaigns have been
courting young voters after their
record turnout in early primaries.
But even as college groups across
the country rally around the candi
dates with unprecedented fervor,
several student organizers at
Stanford said they are surprised by
the relative absence of political
activity taking place on the Farm.
"I don't feel like I've "seen a
huge increase in awareness and
involvement." said Mishan Araujo
'08. the northern California chair of
Women for Hillary, a branch of
Sen. Hillary Clinton's (D-N.Y.)
national presidential campaign. "I
still think there's a lot of apathy
given the size of this campus."
Politically-minded students
have often decried the overwhelm
ing indifference cultivated among
students by the Stanford "bubble,"
which they say insulates their peers
from the realities of the political
world existing just beyond Palm
Drive.
But Debashish Bakshi '08 —
who has been involved in nearly
every state and national election
on campus since campaigning for
2004 Democratic presidential can
didate John Kerry in the fall of his
freshman year — said he has never
witnessed as much enthusiasm for
a single candidate at Stanford as
the kind generated for Sen. Barack
Obama (D-lll.).
"It's really unprecedented," said
Bakshi. the Stanford chapter coor

dinator of Students for Barack
Obama. "I've really seen the scope
of what campus activism is on cam
pus. For a campus that is notorious
ly apathetic, I think the jump we've
made is remarkable."
Obama supporters have been
building momentum on campus
since the beginning of winter quar
ter, said Charlie Davis '08. a volun
teer with Obama's Silicon Valley
campaign office. In addition to reg
istering over 650 California voters
in a single day, Davis said they have
been circulating pledge cards to
collect basic contact information
from students for a database of
supporters that can be tapped to
find volunteers and voters on
Election Day.
The campaign also organized
campus-wide events, including a
presentation last week from faculty
supporting Obama's candidacy and
a Friday rally in White Plaza
attended by several hundred par
ticipants. Davis said the official
Facebook group for Stanford
Obama supporters has over 900
members.
"We have an incredible group of
people on campus who are sacrific
ing a lot to get this campus fired
up," Davis said. "But I don't see
any kind of motivation for any of
the other candidates."
Clinton supporters don't have
as much of an active presence on
campus because they are volun
teering directly as associates to the
state and national campaign
offices, Araujo said.
"We don't have a built-in infra
structure," she said. "The people who
are really dedicated to the campaign
are really engaged at the state level
in the San Francisco office and in the
national campaign."
Araujo said the campaign has
been hosting a few events, including
a conference call with former presi
dent Bill Clinton and phone hanking
at the Clinton campaign's Palo Alto
office. But she said the campaign's
more subtle strategy at Stanford
does not necessarily reflect how
much individual student support
Clinton has on campus.
"We haven't been tabling in
White Plaza," Araujo said. "That's
why the perception exists that there
are So many more Obama support
ers."
Stanford alumna Chelsea Clinton
'01, daughter of Hillary and Bill
Clinton, appeared on campus last
month and fielded questions about
her mother's candidacy before audi
ences at Old Union and Pi Beta Phi.
The visit sparked controversy when
some students charged the sorority
event was available only for a select
group of supporters.
Araujo said Chelsea Clinton had
been in the area campaigning for her
mother when she decided to stop by
Stanford for personal reasons.
Because of strict rules regarding par
tisan political activities on campus,
Araujo said student organizers
worked with administrators to keep
the gathering small.
"It's hard to have the daughter of

a presidential candidate on campus
and not be political," Araujo said.
"We did the best that we could."
Two-thirds of the audience pres
ent at the Old Union roundtable
with the former first daughter were
undecided, Araujo said. She pointed
to the sizeable number of voters still
choosing between Clinton and
Obama as a possible explanation as
to why students at Stanford have not
been as active as other campuses.
"It's a hard decision," Araujo
said. "And if you don't have the
inner motivation to make the deci
sion early, you're less likely to be
more active."
Supporters'of Republican candi
dates are facing similar dilemmas.
Despite the individual activities of
small groups of students behind
Arizona Sen. John McCain, former
New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or
former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney, campus support for these
candidates has not been as visible as
it has for some of the Democratic
contenders.
"I think the lack of campus mobi
lization on the Republican side is a
product of the same factors that
have hurt the party on the national
level." said Carl Kelm "09, president
of the Stanford College Republicans,
in an email to ITie Daily. "Namely,
for months now. polls have consis
tently shown that Democrats are far
happier with their slate of candidates
than the Republicans are.
Republicans at Stanford are not

immune to that same discontent."
Grant Everett Starrett '10, presi
dent of the Stanford Conservative
Society, has worked as national
chairman of Students for Mitt, which
organizes student volunteers and
fundraising efforts for Romney's
candidacy. Starrett said that while he
was in lowa, campuses were plas
tered with signs and more students
were actively vouching for candi
dates. Ile said the overwhelming
presence of liberal discourse on cam
pus may make it more difficult for
conservative students to rally in
large numbers.
"If you're young and conserva
tive. you're already going against the
grain." Starrett said.
Still, Starrett said, apathy extends
beyond party line.
"People get stuck in the Stanford
bubble," he said.
Obama's candidacy no doubt bene
fits from its visibly unchallenged
position on campus, Bakshi said. But
he said it comes at a cost.
"I'm actually a little disappoint
ed. to be honest, with the other
organizations that are on campus
because they are just somewhat lack
ing." Bakshi said. "The larger context
of this is that there is very little actu
al discourse on campus. If there
aren't representatives willing to
engage in that, it's really a loss for
the process as a whole."

with the former first daughter were
undecided, Araujo said. She pointed
to the sizeable number of voters still
choosing between Clinton and
Obama as a possible explanation as
to why students at Stanford have not
been as active as other campuses.
"It's a hard decision," Araujo
said. "And if you don't have the
inner motivation to make the deci
sion early, you're less likely to be
more active."
Supporters'of Republican candi
dates are facing similar dilemmas.
Despite the individual activities of
small groups of students behind
Arizona Sen. John McCain, former
New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or
former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney, campus support for these
candidates has not been as visible as
it has for some of the Democratic
contenders.
"I think the lack of campus mobi
lization on the Republican side is a
product of the same factors that
have hurt the party on the national
level." said Carl Kelm "09, president
of the Stanford College Republicans,
in an email to ITie Daily. "Namely,
for months now. polls have consis
tently shown that Democrats are far
happier with their slate of candidates
than the Republicans are.
Republicans at Stanford are not

immune to that same discontent."
Grant Everett Starrett '10, presi
dent of the Stanford Conservative
Society, has worked as national
chairman of Students for Mitt, which
organizes student volunteers and
fundraising efforts for Romney's
candidacy. Starrett said that while he
was in lowa, campuses were plas
tered with signs and more students
were actively vouching for candi
dates. Ile said the overwhelming
presence of liberal discourse on cam
pus may make it more difficult for
conservative students to rally in
large numbers.
"If you're young and conserva
tive. you're already going against the
grain." Starrett said.
Still, Starrett said, apathy extends
beyond party line.
"People get stuck in the Stanford
bubble," he said.
Obama's candidacy no doubt bene
fits from its visibly unchallenged
position on campus, Bakshi said. But
he said it comes at a cost.
"I'm actually a little disappoint
ed. to be honest, with the other
organizations that are on campus
because they are just somewhat lack
ing." Bakshi said. "The larger context
of this is that there is very little actu
al discourse on campus. If there
aren't representatives willing to
engage in that, it's really a loss for
the process as a whole."

As the "Super Tuesday" 2(X)S
presidential primaries approach in
22 states, campaigns have been
courting young voters after their
record turnout in early primaries.
But even as college groups across
the country rally around the candi
dates with unprecedented fervor,
several student organizers at
Stanford said they are surprised by
the relative absence of political
activity taking place on the Farm.
"I don't feel like I've "seen a
huge increase in awareness and
involvement." said Mishan Araujo
'08. the northern California chair of
Women for Hillary, a branch of
Sen. Hillary Clinton's (D-N.Y.)
national presidential campaign. "I
still think there's a lot of apathy
given the size of this campus."
Politically-minded students
have often decried the overwhelm
ing indifference cultivated among
students by the Stanford "bubble,"
which they say insulates their peers
from the realities of the political
world existing just beyond Palm
Drive.
But Debashish Bakshi '08 —
who has been involved in nearly
every state and national election
on campus since campaigning for
2004 Democratic presidential can
didate John Kerry in the fall of his
freshman year — said he has never
witnessed as much enthusiasm for
a single candidate at Stanford as
the kind generated for Sen. Barack
Obama (D-lll.).
"It's really unprecedented," said
Bakshi. the Stanford chapter coor

dinator of Students for Barack
Obama. "I've really seen the scope
of what campus activism is on cam
pus. For a campus that is notorious
ly apathetic, I think the jump we've
made is remarkable."
Obama supporters have been
building momentum on campus
since the beginning of winter quar
ter, said Charlie Davis '08. a volun
teer with Obama's Silicon Valley
campaign office. In addition to reg
istering over 650 California voters
in a single day, Davis said they have
been circulating pledge cards to
collect basic contact information
from students for a database of
supporters that can be tapped to
find volunteers and voters on
Election Day.
The campaign also organized
campus-wide events, including a
presentation last week from faculty
supporting Obama's candidacy and
a Friday rally in White Plaza
attended by several hundred par
ticipants. Davis said the official
Facebook group for Stanford
Obama supporters has over 900
members.
"We have an incredible group of
people on campus who are sacrific
ing a lot to get this campus fired
up," Davis said. "But I don't see
any kind of motivation for any of
the other candidates."
Clinton supporters don't have
as much of an active presence on
campus because they are volun
teering directly as associates to the
state and national campaign
offices, Araujo said.
"We don't have a built-in infra
structure," she said. "The people who
are really dedicated to the campaign
are really engaged at the state level
in the San Francisco office and in the
national campaign."
Araujo said the campaign has
been hosting a few events, including
a conference call with former presi
dent Bill Clinton and phone hanking
at the Clinton campaign's Palo Alto
office. But she said the campaign's
more subtle strategy at Stanford
does not necessarily reflect how
much individual student support
Clinton has on campus.
"We haven't been tabling in
White Plaza," Araujo said. "That's
why the perception exists that there
are So many more Obama support
ers."
Stanford alumna Chelsea Clinton
'01, daughter of Hillary and Bill
Clinton, appeared on campus last
month and fielded questions about
her mother's candidacy before audi
ences at Old Union and Pi Beta Phi.
The visit sparked controversy when
some students charged the sorority
event was available only for a select
group of supporters.
Araujo said Chelsea Clinton had
been in the area campaigning for her
mother when she decided to stop by
Stanford for personal reasons.
Because of strict rules regarding par
tisan political activities on campus,
Araujo said student organizers
worked with administrators to keep
the gathering small.
"It's hard to have the daughter of

a presidential candidate on campus
and not be political," Araujo said.
"We did the best that we could."
Two-thirds of the audience pres
ent at the Old Union roundtable
with the former first daughter were
undecided, Araujo said. She pointed
to the sizeable number of voters still
choosing between Clinton and
Obama as a possible explanation as
to why students at Stanford have not
been as active as other campuses.
"It's a hard decision," Araujo
said. "And if you don't have the
inner motivation to make the deci

more active."
