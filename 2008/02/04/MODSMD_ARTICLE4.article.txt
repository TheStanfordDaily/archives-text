# Students gear up for Tues. primaries
## Some groups face apathy, supporters rally around Obama 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
As the "Super Tuesday" 2(X)S
presidential primaries approach in
22 states, campaigns have been
courting young voters after their
record turnout in early primaries.
But even as college groups across
the country rally around the candi
dates with unprecedented fervor,
several student organizers at
Stanford said they are surprised by
the relative absence of political
activity taking place on the Farm.
"I don't feel like I've "seen a
huge increase in awareness and
involvement." said Mishan Araujo
'08. the northern California chair of
Women for Hillary, a branch of
Sen. Hillary Clinton's (D-N.Y.)
national presidential campaign. "I
still think there's a lot of apathy
given the size of this campus."
Politically-minded students
have often decried the overwhelm
ing indifference cultivated among
students by the Stanford "bubble,"
which they say insulates their peers
from the realities of the political
world existing just beyond Palm
Drive.
But Debashish Bakshi '08 —
who has been involved in nearly
every state and national election
on campus since campaigning for
2004 Democratic presidential can
didate John Kerry in the fall of his
freshman year — said he has never
witnessed as much enthusiasm for
a single candidate at Stanford as
the kind generated for Sen. Barack
Obama (D-lll.).
"It's really unprecedented," said
Bakshi. the Stanford chapter coor

dinator of Students for Barack
Obama. "I've really seen the scope
of what campus activism is on cam
pus. For a campus that is notorious
ly apathetic, I think the jump we've
made is remarkable."
Obama supporters have been
building momentum on campus
since the beginning of winter quar
ter, said Charlie Davis '08. a volun
teer with Obama's Silicon Valley
campaign office. In addition to reg
istering over 650 California voters
in a single day, Davis said they have
been circulating pledge cards to
collect basic contact information
from students for a database of
supporters that can be tapped to
find volunteers and voters on
Election Day.
The campaign also organized
campus-wide events, including a
presentation last week from faculty
supporting Obama's candidacy and
a Friday rally in White Plaza
attended by several hundred par
ticipants. Davis said the official
Facebook group for Stanford
Obama supporters has over 900
members.
"We have an incredible group of
people on campus who are sacrific
ing a lot to get this campus fired
up," Davis said. "But I don't see
any kind of motivation for any of
the other candidates."
Clinton supporters don't have
as much of an active presence on
campus because they are volun
teering directly as associates to the
state and national campaign
offices, Araujo said.
"We don't have a built-in infra
