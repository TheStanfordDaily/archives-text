## Candidates sweep across California Clinton, Mrs. Obama visit San Jose over the weekend 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
With polls showing the tightening race for
the Democratic nomination in a dead heat, can
didates and their supporters aggressively cam
paigned across the state over the weekend.
California, one of 22 states where
Democrats will vote TUesday, is by far the
biggest prize in what amounts to a national pri
mary.
And the Bay Area has gotten a good share
of attention.
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) traveled to the
San Jose Convention Center Friday afternoon
as part of a western swing that included stops in
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
On Saturday, John Kerry led a San Francisco
rally for Obama while Chelsea Clinton '01 cam-
paigned for her mother at Mills
College in Oakland On Friday,
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
campaigned for Obama in
Oakland.
Spouses of candidates also
blazed across the state over the
weekend. Michelle Obama visited
the student union at San Jose State
University late last night to lead a
rally for her husband, while former
president Bill Clinton spent
Sunday in Southern California,
speaking to parishioners in African
American churches.
Earlier Sunday, Mrs. Obama
campaigned with television
celebrity Oprah Winfrey and
accepted a surprise endorsement
from Maria Shriver, the wife of
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, at
UCLA.
What accounts for all the atten
tion? The Golden State will dis

perse 370 Democratic delegates on
Tuesday, and a candidate only
needs about 2,000 to win the
Democratic nomination.
Each of the state's 53 congres
sional districts is allocated a num
ber of delegates, based on past
Democratic turnout. Unlike win
ner-take-all states, or the Electoral
College in the general election, the
allocation formula ensures a mostly
proportional division of delegates
based on the depth of support.
While the number of delegates
earned by each candidate from the
state could be about equal, the
national media and pundits will
closely watch the statewide popu
lar vote.
A come-from-behind Obama
win in California, likely coinciding
with victories in other bellwether
states like Missouri, would give an
added jolt of momentum to the
candidate and could prove devas
tating to Clinton, who long held
the lead in the state.
Polls published over the week
end indicate that the battle is clos
er than ever, not safely in Clinton's

column as had long been assumed.
Obama led Clinton by one per
centage point (45-44) in a poll of
California voters released by
Rasmussen Reports on Sunday.
The group reported that five per
cent of voters remain undecided,
and that 24 percent either said they
"might" or there is a "good
chance" of changing their mind.
The latest Field Poll, released
Saturday and publicized on the
Sunday front pages of the San
Francisco Chronicle and San Jose
Mercury News, showed Clinton
leading Obama 36 to 34 percent,
within the margin of error, in
California. Obama leads in the Bay
Area by 41 to 31 percent, accord
ing to a news report on the poll,
while independent decline-to-state
voters support Obama over
Clinton 54 to 32 percent.
On the Republican side, Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) led former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney
by 32 to 24 percent in the Field Poll
of California voters. Another poll
put Romney narrowly ahead.
McCain continued to receive

endorsements from high-profile
conservatives, many of whom have
been traditionally leery of
McCain's brand of Republicanism.
The Sunday San Francisco
Chronicle revealed McCain
endorsements from former
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, who is also a Hoover
Institution Distinguished Fellow,
and Stanford Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin.
"1 previously supported Rudy
Giuliani because of his record of
controlling spending, cutting taxes
and improving public services to
turn around a New York City
plagued with rampant crime and
fiscal chaos," Boskin wrote. "I also
have a very high regard for Mitt
Romney. But I now believe the
person best suited to the crucial
tasks confronting the next presi
dent is John McCain."
