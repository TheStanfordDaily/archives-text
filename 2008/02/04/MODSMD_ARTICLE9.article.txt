# All eyes on Clinton
## Candidates talk about Clinton as Super Tuesday approaches 
### CHARLES BABINGTON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The top presidential can
didates and their big-name supporters campaigned from
coast to coast Sunday, but one contender seemed atop
everyone's mind: Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney con
trasted themselves, and each other, with Clinton as
though she were the nominee. Her Democratic rival.
Barack Obama. played along to a degree, saying Clinton
is so polarizing that he is their party's better bet.
Rather than diverting the less-than-flattering atten
tion, Clinton embraced it.
"I've been taking the incoming fire from Republicans
for about 16 years now, and I'm still here,because I have
been vetted. I have been tested," she said in a TV inter
view before campaigning in Missouri and Minneapolis.
"There's unlikely to be any new surprises." Clinton
added, implying the same cannot be said of Obama, who
has been in Congress three years.
Her confidence notwithstanding, polls showed
Obama narrowing the lead that Clinton has enjoyed
among Democrats nationwide, even as McCain ap
peared to be pulling away from Romney.
With 24 states holding presidential contests TUesday,
Sunday was an intense day of campaigning and advertis
ing, making it all the more remarkable that one figure
managed to dominate so much of the talk and specula
tion.
For years the New York senator and former first lady
has been an object of fascination, mystery and some
times scorn by Americans, few of whom seem neutral to
ward her. She is the Democrat conservatives most love to
hate, and McCain and Romney campaigned against her
Sunday as if in a proxy battle against one another.
"If we want a party that is indistinguishable from

Hillary' Clinton on an issue like illegal immigration,"
Romney said, "we're going to have John McCain as a
nominee. That's the wrong way to go."
McCain,campaigning in Fairfield,Conn..said he has
never sought special projects for his state, and added:"ln
her short time in the United States Senate, the senator
from New York. Senator Clinton, got $500 million worth
of pork barrel projects. My friends, that kind of thing is
going to stop."
* The Clinton fascination is trickier for Ohama. He
wants to capitalize on Republicans' opposition to her
without agreeing that she is the inevitable nominee.
Speaking on CBS' "Face the Nation" before cam
paigning in Delaware, the Illinois senator said the prob
lem is "not all of Senator Clinton's making, but I don't
think there's any doubt that the Republicans consider
her a polarizing figure."
As usual, another prominent Clinton - the candidate's
husband and former president - was in the thick of things.
Bill Clinton visited four churches in mostly black sec
tions of Los Angeles. The trip was widely seen as a bid to
smooth over perceptions that he had injected race into
last month's Democratic primary in South Carolina,
which Obama won handily.
The former president never mentioned Obama by
name when he spoke for about 20 minutes at the City of
Refuge church in Gardena. But he struck a conciliatory
tone in describing this year's Democratic contest as "an
embarrassment of riches."
"I'm not against anybody," Clinton said.
Campaigning in a western suburb of Chicago. Rom
ney took a swipe at Obama, again as a means of nicking
McCain.
"Yesterday Barack Obama said there's not a dime's
worth of difference between he and Senator McCain on
illegal immigration," Romney told a crowd at the Col
lege of DuPage. "I'm afraid it's going to be real hard to

win the White House if there's not much difference be
tween our nominee and theirs, and that's why I'm going
to make sure that we stand for Republican ideals and win
the White House on that platform."
McCain largely shrugged off such jibes, although he
said he is "much more conservative" than Romney.
He told reporters that despite polls showing him with
a 20-point lead over Romney, "I'm incredibly nervous,
and I've seen that movie before." Knocking twice on a
wooden table in his campaign bus, he said, "a lot of this
business is expectation levels, so it's our job to keep our
own expectation levels down."
In a day dominated by familiar stump speeches,
Hillary Clinton made news by saying she might allow
workers' wages to be garnisheed if they refuse to buy
health insurance. She has criticized Obama for pushing a
health plan that she says would not require universal
coverage.
Pressed on how she would enforce her mandate,
Clinton said: "I think there are a number of mecha
nisms" that are possible, including "going after people's
wages, automatic enrollment."
She said such measures would apply only to workers
who can afford health coverage but refuse to buy it,
which puts undue pressure on hospitals and emergency
rooms. Under her plan, she said, health care "will be af
fordable for everyone" because she would limit premi
um payments "to a low percent of your income."
Obama has said he would require parents to buy
health insurance for children, and possibly fine them if
they refused. But he would not insist that all adults buy
insurance.
