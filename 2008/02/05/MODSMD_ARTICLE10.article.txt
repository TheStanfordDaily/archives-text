# Math 15:
## Fuzzies' Logic 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
/ 1 tanford is a place of surprises — even not-so
delightful ones, like when you think you will
never have to take another math class after
¥ high school, but then those techie "GERs"
tLmS come along and inform you that unless they
are fulfilled, you simply can't graduate!
For all of you out there for whom math isn't second
nature, revel in the joy that you are definitely not in the
minority. For those who had to tread through Math 19 or
Stats 60 to fulfill that math GER. remember, you can
proudly brag that you actually took a math class at Stan
ford. And for those of you procrastinating with getting
the Math GER out of the way. this is one time your pro
crastinating will actually pay off!
Math 15 "Overview of Mathematics." due to be of
fered for the second time next year, is a class that fuzzies
across campus have unanimously loved.
And it's largely because of Professor Keith Devlin,
Consulting Professor in the Department of Mathemat
ics. who received the Carl Sagan Award for "making
math fun for non-techies."
That's right. FUN!
According to The Stanford Report, Devlin's Math 15
class is designed to be "extremely valuable in preparing
young people for life in today's society." Ibe course is
targeted at non-science majors and is designed to pro
vide a broad survey of the nature and role of mathemat
ics in society.
"This class is a study of math from a cultural perspec
tive, one very different from regular math courses," De
vlin said. "The students have to do some problems,
though 1 try to make it as unlike high school math as
possible."
Jesse Wallin '08. a Religious Studies and Interna
tional Relations major who took Devlin's Math 15class
last year as a fun alternative to fulfill the math GER,
was no exception — he truly enjoyed Devlin's style of
teaching.
"Devlin has the unique gift of making mathematics
relevant and tangible to demographics that typically
find math abstract and not particularly important to
their day to day lives," Wallin wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Devlin brings the world of mathematics alive to
students who are used to viewing math as simply num
bers and equations instead of as an all-encompassing
tapestry which weaves together many aspects of life we
take for granted."
Last year was the first time that Devlin taught the
class within the span of ten weeks instead of over an en
tire semester. Although this reduced the frequency and
duration of discussion sessions, students seemed to
enjoy the open communication that Devlin facilitated,
both inside and outside of the classroom.
Lisa Kerner '09. an English major, enjoyed Devlin's

unique teaching style and the distinct effort he made to
interact with his students.
"Devlin's goal for the class was to break away from
the high school mentality of rote memorization and en
courage a more analytical thinking about mathematics,
and to ultimately expose us to math's innumerable ap
plications in the everyday world, from linguistics to
DNA profiling to solving crime," she said. "I have al
ways despised math, mostly because I've never been
great at it and found it rather dull, but 1 honestly looked
forward to attending lecture every day and feeling a lit
tle less math-illiterate each time."
The course included weekly quizzes, one for each
chapter of the class 'textbook,' Devlin's piece of litera
ture centered upon the mathematics behind the TV
show "NUMB3RS."
"Although students initially didn't like the quizzes, at
the end, nearly all of them agreed that they wouldn't
have got the same out of the class without the quizzes",
Devlin said. "More than a test of their math, it was a
good way for students to really understand the reading
and for me to gauge their areas of interest and potential
for improvement."
The small classroom allowed Devlin to maintain a
close interaction with his students,giving them personal
attention to help make up for "six to eight years of math
education they didn't enjoy."
"Quizzes tell me what my students don't understand;
interaction tells me why," Devlin said."l'm talking to an
audience that doesn't like math: chatting regularly with
them is therefore critical to help make the material I
teach interesting."
"I love math and I get a lot of joy from conveying that
love to other people, especially to students who have
not all been taught by people who love the subject" De
vlin said. "I have ten weeks to convey that enthusiasm
and although I have big ambitions for the course, the
students are the ones that can really make the biggest
difference, especially if they get to know you well."
Both Wallin and Kerner highly recommended De
vlin's class.
"I think Devlin's passion for math would be a posi
tive. eye-opening experience for every student, whether
they enter the class loving math or hating it," Kerner
said.
"Devlin's unique teaching style quickly endears you
to material you've never before embraced." Wallin
added. "1 would absolutely recommend Professor De
vlin's class to both 'fuzzies' who are math-averse and
'techies' who would like to gain a different perspective
on the world of mathematics."
Although the class isn't being offered this year. Pro
fessor Devlin is hoping that he will have the opportuni
ty to teach it twice next year, both in the fall and winter.
So for all you non-technies out there waiting to fulfill
that math GER. this is the perfect opportunity to do so!

Both Wallin and Kerner highly recommended De
vlin's class.
"I think Devlin's passion for math would be a posi
tive. eye-opening experience for every student, whether
they enter the class loving math or hating it," Kerner
said.
"Devlin's unique teaching style quickly endears you
to material you've never before embraced." Wallin
added. "1 would absolutely recommend Professor De
vlin's class to both 'fuzzies' who are math-averse and
'techies' who would like to gain a different perspective
on the world of mathematics."
Although the class isn't being offered this year. Pro
fessor Devlin is hoping that he will have the opportuni
ty to teach it twice next year, both in the fall and winter.
So for all you non-technies out there waiting to fulfill
that math GER. this is the perfect opportunity to do so!
