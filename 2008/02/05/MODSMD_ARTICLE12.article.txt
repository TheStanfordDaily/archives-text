Candidates Race to Super
Tuesday Showdowns
WASIIINGTON (A P) — Buoyed by
cheering crowds and bolstered by
more than $1.3 million a day in TV
ads. Democrats Barack Obama and
Hillary Rodham Clinton raced
through the final hours of an unpre
dictable Super Tuesday campaign
across 22 states. The Republican race
turned negative on the eve of the
busiest day in primary history.
"We're going to hand (he liberals
in our party a little surprise," boasted
Mitt Romney, the former Massachu
setts governor, criticizing John Mc-
Cain for his positions on tax cuts, gay
marriage and immigration and pre
dicting an upset win in delegate-rich
California.
McCain struck back a few hours
later Monday with a television ad that
showed Romney in a 1994 debate
against Democratic Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, saying he was "an inde
pendent during the time of Reagan-
Bush. I'm not trying to return to Rea
gan-Bush"
Outwardly. McCain projected con
fidence. not only about wrapping up
the nomination but about Novem
ber's general election as well. "I can
lead this nation and motivate all
Americans to serve a cause greater
than their self-interest," he said while
campaigning at a fire station in New
Jersey.

Unwilling to leave anything to
chance, both men hastily rearranged
their schedules to make one more late
stop in California, the largest state,
with 170 delegates.
After months on the road, the wear on
the candidates was showing, and the
schedules strained human endurance.
Clinton's voice was raspy, and at
one stop, she struggled to control her
coughing.
Romney had breakfast in Ten
nessee. was in Georgia at lunchtime,
touched down in Oklahoma at the
dinner hour and arrived in California
for a rally with I,(XX) cheering sup
porters in Long Beach just before
midnight Eastern time.
He then was flying through the
night so he could attend the West Vir
ginia state convention Tuesday morn
ing.
California shaping up as epi
center of Super Tuesday Pri
maries
SACRAMENTO (AP) — California
is poised to shed its also-ran status
and become the kingmaker in Ilies
day's coast-to-coast presidential pri
mary.
The nation's richest delegate prize
grabbed last-minute attention from
the campaigns of all the major candi
dates, as both Republican and Demo
cratic contests remain up for grabs.

It's just the type of spectacle Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger hoped for
when he and state lawmakers moved
California's presidential primary
from June to February this year.
Although California is one of 24
states holding primaries or caucuses
on Tuesday, the spotlight is clearly on
the nation's most populous state,
where 370 Democratic and 170 Re
publican delegates are in play.
Republicans John McCain and Mitt
Romney added last-minute campaign
stops in California on Monday and
Tuesday, while Democrats Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama
sent high-profile surrogates to cam
paign on their behalf.
"The world is looking at California as
a big player in the decision-making,"
Schwarzenegger told reporters Mon
day in Los Angeles. "That's exactly

what we intended."
Former President Bill Clinton swept
the state for a second straight day
Monday on behalf of his wife, empha
sizing her experience and know-how
over rival Obama. whose momentum
has led to a dead heat in the Democ
ratic primary.
"You know she can deal with any cri
sis that comes up. You know she is
confident and strong," he told a di
verse crowd of about 1.000 at the state
fairgrounds in Sacramento.

plan

budget plan will keep the U.S. econo
my growing and protect the U.S. mili
tarily.

tablet that contained the budget de

budget in that it's coming to Congress
over the Internet. It's a budget that's

objectives. One. it understands our top
priority is to defend our country so we
fund our military as well as fund the
homeland security." Bush said. "Sec

"It's essential that we make sure that

we deal with the uncertainties - the
economic uncertainties we face,"
Bush said. He said it was important for
Congress to quickly enact a $150 bil
lion economic stimulus plan.
Bush also called on Congress anew to
make expiring tax cuts permanent.
Bush said his plan would boost money
for education, health, housing and
helps make the tax code fairer.
"This budget is one that keeps spend
ing under control," the president said.
He said it would eliminate or reduce
151 "wasteful or bloated" programs,
which would save taxpayers $18 bil
lion.
"It also takes a hard look at entitle
ment growth over the next five years,"
Bush said. He said Congress should
come up with its own ideas, particular
ly looking at deficits in Social Security
and Medicare.
