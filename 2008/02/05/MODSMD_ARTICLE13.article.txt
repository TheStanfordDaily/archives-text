## Editorial Board No on Props 94 through 97 
### 
Voting "yes" or "no" on any of Califor
nia's perplexing ballot propositions
always feels like a gamble. Each side
has seemingly valid arguments, endorse
ments from respected political and union
leaders, and millions of dollars to pour into
advertisements that confuse the issues at
hand. Such is the case with Propositions 94
through 97. which amend a 1999 compact
between California and four major Native
American tribes to provide for a staggering
increase in slot-machines and a reallocation
of gambling revenues. While there appears
to be a large upside to Propositions 94
through 97, this Tuesday, voters should vote
"no" on this gratuitous expansion of in-state
gambling, despite the allure of badly-needed
state funds.
The sheer scale of the proposed expan
sion. which authorizes 17.000 new slot ma
chines, would more than triple the current
maximum allowed, outnumbering the totals
of a dozen of Las Vegas's biggest casinos.
What would be one of the largest casino ex
pansions in U.S. history is far from the mod
est amount voters approved with Proposi
tion 1A in 2000.The sizeable increase would
naturally have a serious impact on fiscal, en
vironmental and labor issues, in addition to
skewing the power dynamic between tribes
and the state. Four tribes out of the 108 in
California would control more than one
third of tribal gaming revenue.
Proponents of Propositions 94 through
97 have emphasized the benefits of the pro
jected nine billion dollars in revenue that
California would receive by 2030. pointing
out that Governor Schwarzenegger has de
clared an economic state of emergency in re
sponse to the state's wilting economy. The
propositions ostensibly promise several mil
lion dollars annually to the state, which may
be used to fund education, healthcare or
other services.
But this argument is unpersuasive for
several reasons. Firstly, the gambling rev
enue would constitute only about one hun
dredth of a percent of the state's budget, in
consequential in the face of a deficit greater
than 14 billion dollars and disproportionate
to the amount of power the Pechanga, Mo
rongo, Sycuan and Agua Caliente tribes
would accumulate as a result.
Secondly, the money would go to the
state's $100 billion General Fund, from
which the Legislature is able to allocate
funds however it chooses. ITiere is no guar
antee that the money would be spent on ed
ucation or the services proposed, and it is en

tirely possible that funding previously allot
ted for such programs may be reduced and
diverted with the gambling revenues expect
ed to fill the vacuum.
Moreover, the four tribes' previous annu
al payments to the Special Distribution
Fund (SDF) — currently ranging from 2.6
to 29 million dollars a year, depending on the
tribe — would end. l"he SDF funds pro
grams to help with gambling addiction, sub
sidizes the costs state agencies spend on reg
ulating tribal casinos, and evens the differ
ence in the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund,
which distributes gambling revenues among
less powerful tribes. Sending the money, in
stead, to an amorphous General Fund is an
inadequate substitute.
The financial impact in the Riverside
area where three of the four tribes' casinos
are located would be significant. Assuming
the tribes are successful in recruiting more
gambling, especially from out-of-state, local
businesses would likely profit. 1 lowever, the
money being gambled away, it is safely ar
gued, might have done more for California's
economy if spent at taxable locations off
reservation, to say nothing of its utility in
paying bills, mortgages and education costs.
Even were there to be a net profit from the
increased gaming, losses from in-state gam
blers would partially offset the small per
centage the tribes would pay the state.
There are additional concerns over envi
ronmental and labor regulations, which are
less stringent for the four tribes in question
than they are for the smaller tribes. Current
ly the tribes are not subject to the California
Environmental Quality Act, requiring gov
ernment oversight on projects, and Proposi
tions 94 through 97 still fall short of truly ad
dressing the environmental impact that the
casino expansion will have on the surround
ing area. The casinos have also been criti
cized for failing to adhere to adequate labor
standards, including ensuring healthcare for
workers and allowing workers to organize.
These propositions have invited hosts of
other worries about state control over casi
no inspections, setting precedents for future
expansions and encouraging the evils of
gambling. While the gambling propositions
will bring California some revenue, the neg
atives of having a few privileged, insulated
and extremely powerful tribes operating
without serious oversight or regulations far
outweigh the perceived advantages. Don't
take a gamble this Tuesday; vote "no" on
Propositions 94 through 97.
