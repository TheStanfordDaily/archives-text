# Pleading Inanity
## The 						early returns 
### 
I know that for most of you every Tuesday
is super because that's the day my col
umn appears. I congratulate you for your
refined taste.
Yet this particular Tuesday has a couple
claims to being extraordinarily "super." First
off. I'm getting a haircut. Nothing too dras
tic. don't worry. A three or four-buzz on the
sides, thin out the top a bit, and — to ap
pease the critics — fix the bangs: they're a
little flat, and they need to be fringed.Today,
Tuesday. February 5,2008, this wrong will be
righted.
TTie other reason you might have this
date starred on your calendar is because 22
states are holding presidential primaries and
caucuses. Well, before I tell you for whom to
vote and why, let's get our misinformation
straight, because in America we can't make
informed electoral decisions without know
ing the drafts our candidates dodged, the in
terns they boned and the mixed-race chil
dren they sired.
First things first. Senator Osama is Mus
lim. Oh, whoops. My bad. Obama, Obama is
Muslim. In other news, John Edwards once
paid $4(X) to patent the phrase "my daddy
worked in a saw mill," and during his time
with Cerberus Capital Management...wait,
what's that? Edwards dropped out of the
race? That just proves what I always knew:
1.) poverty is a losing issue for everyone, not
just the impoverished, and 2.) white men just
can't catch a break nowadays.
As for Hillary, well, I've done a lot of re
search. read all the punditry, combed the bl
ogosphere, and I am KM) percent confident
when I say that she is. in fact, a woman. I'hen
again, maybe we should all be "post-gender"
in the same way that Barack is "post-race."
Hillary wears pants. Giuliani wears dresses.
Who has the vagina? It's an open question. I
figure that's why progressive people refer to

their significant others as "life partners," he
cause no matter how well you know some
one, you never really know, ya know?
On the Republican side, we have John
McCain and Mitt Romney. Now, the Viet
nam Veterans Against McCain are partly
right when they say he has misrepresented
his wartime experience, hut this is a harmless
error;his memory is fading. John, I know you
read my column, so listen up my friend: it
wasn't the Vietnam War you were in. it was
the Punic War, Rome v. Carthage. No, no,
John. Pu- nic, turn up your hearing aid!
As for Romney, well, he gets slammed
enough for being a money-hungry sleaze
ball. That's all well and true, but I'd like to
clarify some misconceptions about his Mor
mon faith. Fact: until 1890, the Mormon
Church allowed polygamy. Fiction: all Mor
mons are the spawn of Joseph Smith. Fact: 112
rom IK4b to 1869, more than 70,(XX) Mor
mons traveled from Illinois to Utah along
what is now known as the Mormon Pioneer
Trail. Fiction: While most Mormons slogged
out the trail in an ox-drawn wagon, Brigham
Young took the bus. Fact: Mormons are just
like you and me. Fiction: Whereas you and I
are homo sapiens. Mormons are Homor
mon Speake-in-tongue-iens.
Before we continue, let's check the cur
rent poll-numbers: obama:o. Clinton: 0. Mc-
Cain: 0. Romney: 0. [Note to The Daily.

What are my endorsements, you
ask? Among the Republicans, I'd
probably vote for McCain.That way,
not only my kids, but also my kids'
kids' kids will be in Iraq as long as it
takes. On the Democratic side, I'm
all Obama, all the time. Don't like it?
Well then, you can just go to Hellary.
Oh, whoops. My bad. I mean Miliary.
Or do I?
