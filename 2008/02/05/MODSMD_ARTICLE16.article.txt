## Hillary Clinton for president 
### 
Deciding between Senator Hillary
Clinton and Senator Barack Obama
for the Democratic presidential
nomination hinges not on their policy dif
ferences. After all, Clinton and Obama are
in lockstep on most points. The decision
does not hinge, either, on rhetoric, charisma
or popularity. The media's coverage of
Obama's grassroots support belies the fact
that in the primaries so far, Clinton has con
sistently beaten Obama among lower-in
come voters.
Deciding whom to vote for hinges on the
candidates' visions of the presidency —
how they will be president. Clinton, com
pared to Obama. has shown herself to be far
humbler in her ambitions for the presidency,
focusing on solutions and results rather than
grand, gauzy rhetoric. She is more likely to
accomplish her objectives and. if elected,
win a second term on the strength of her
successes over these next four years.
Obama's rhetoric indicates that, as presi
dent. he would attempt to transform Amer
ican society, as President Bush has tried.
This, however, would continue a dangerous
pattern of ever-increasing executive power.
Bush has not only expanded his legal au
thority but has dominated the political dis
course to the exclusion of other actors. He
has left less space for civil society and in
fringed upon the political prerogatives of
Congress.
Obama's proposed grand transforma
tions may not be good for American society
Foreign policy, for example, needs strong,
conventional leadership. Obama's revision
ist Iraq policy, to take one case, is based on
his opposition to the war more than five
years ago, when he was not even part of the
U.S. Senate. A president needs to leave the
option of using force on the table, however,
and not diminish the power of American

diplomacy.
George Bush was elected on a platform
of "compassionate conservatism." He want
ed to transform America into an "ownership
society." His vision included individual so
cial security accounts and increased home
ownership. He also wanted to use the vast
number of faith-based organizations to
carry out governmental services. The social
security reforms did not pass, and America
is currently experiencing a mortgage crisis.
These big ideas and the vision of a "transfor
mative presidency" failed spectacularly.
The primary lesson we learn from the un
successful presidency of George W. Bush is
not that conservatism is wrong, or that it
failed to govern effectively. Conservatism
remains strong.The lesson is that a "transfor
mative presidency" quickly turns into an
"imperial presidency," and that cover-ups,
half-truths and unqualified appointees mul
tiply. It's not clear that an Obama presiden
cy, considering his confidence in the su
premacy of his views, would be any less
error-prone or less likely to cover up mis
takes. Even FDR's grand presidency, which
occurred during a societal crisis unlike any
thing we have ever known since,overextend
ed itself — FDR tried extra-constitutional
means to pack the Supreme Court. America
doesn't need another imperial presidency.
We at Stanford live in a bubble. It's clear
that Obama's rhetoric and the prospect of an
African-American in the White House are
appealing to college students. (The Stanford
Obama Facebook group has 924 members,
the Clinton one 67.) Obama's rhetoric of
"hope" and "change" seems to have tapped
into a deep vein of student discontent with
the current political system. He's ridden this
support to several primary victories, but
without offering much beyond his rhetoric.
Past El Camino, he's only convinced 41 per

cent of Democrats to support him across the
country, according to a NYT/CBS poll re
leased on Sunday. Hillary Clinton has
proved to be stiff competition, even after
Obama's mythic lowa caucus victory, his
continuously and ridiculously favorable
media coverage, and his larger donor base
and financial advantage. Clinton has stub
bornly stuck around, picking off New Hamp
shire, Nevada and Florida. Her continual
support, even after lowa, means her appeal
should not be underestimated and Obama's
ascendancy not viewed as a given.
The American people will find a Hillary
Clinton presidency to be humble and bipar
tisan, much like her seven and a half years in
the Senate. She will not bring Republican
hatred, which everyone seems to be worried
about. Clinton has worked with Republi
cans consistently and found common
ground. Obama, meanwhile, was named the
most liberal Senator of 2007 by National
Journal, based on 99 Senate votes. A Hillary
Clinton presidency will not have the out
sized and ultimately doomed ambitions of
Barack Obama or George Bush. Rather, we
will find ourselves pleasantly surprised with
our nominee's performance.

Stuart Baimel looks forward to being the next
secretary of state in exchange for this editorial.
In his first act, he will invade Spain. Contact his
