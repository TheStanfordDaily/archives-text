## Stanford's Mission 
### 
Reading Chris Seck's Op-Ed on Jan. 31
["Keep Stanford Small"] prompted
me to refleet on the mission of our uni
versity. Is it, as Mr. Seck's argument would
suggest, to rank highest amongst the world's
universities? Is it to operate by the ethos that
recast all other objectives as secondary to this
one?To only diversify' by increasing the pro
portion of non-California students, thus rank
ing higher on lists that penalize 'local' univer
sities? To insure that, no matter what other
factors are at work, we do not increase our

student population above that of the top 10
American universities? Better yet, to strive to
have our student population be even smaller
than Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Duke,
Dartmouth and Brown?
Or, should Stanford's objective simply be
the most obvious objective of any university
— to educate? Stanford's mission is to pro
vide an education to as many people as possi
ble given its resources and limitations.That is,
after all, what a university is meant to do.
If we attract the best undergraduates, per

haps it is because we offer an excellent educa
tion. Perhaps we attract the best graduate stu
dents because we invest in quality over quan
tity, and we guarantee the best environment
for our faculty and students. Perhaps we at
tract Nobel laureates the world over because
Stanford is the most welcoming and con
ducive environment for cutting-edge re
search. Should our student population be
what it is because of the resources
that Stanford has, and the genuine
limitations by which it is restricted?
Or should it be due to an artificially
placed limit on the student popula
tion size, one that is there for a single
minded attempt to rise in college
rankings?
We will not become the world's
best university by pandering to the
whims of the latest rankings. Placing
arbitrary and artificial restrictions
will appease the more elitist amongst
us, and may in the short term increase
our standing. But it is not a strategy
for long term improvement. We can
only get better by being better. By
providing the most students possible
the best education possible. By ad
dressing the social and economic
challenges the world faces. By inno
vating our approaches to the study of

law and the legal system. By re
searching the core scientific ques
tions of our era. and by continuing to
nurture the entrepreneurial spirit
that gave birth to Silicon Valley. We
are not Harvard. Princeton or Yale.
We are Stanford. We have our own
mission, and our unique place in ge
ography and history in which to ac
complish that mission. The Stan
fords' dream was to build a universi
ty that educates the children of Cali
fornia. 1 think that if Stanford can, it
ought to educate all the world's chil
dren.
But it cannot, and so we must set
tle for the next best thing. Educate as
many as we can, without degrading
the quality of the education we pro
vide. This is not merely a question of
whether the undergraduate class be
comes bigger or smaller. It is a ques
tion of what drives us as a communi
ty, and what defines our purpose and
sense of being.
