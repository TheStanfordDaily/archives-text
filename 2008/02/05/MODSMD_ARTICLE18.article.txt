## BRONCO BUSTING 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Taking its final break from confer
ence play. No. 6 Stanford women's bas
ketball goes head-to-head with local
rival Santa Clara tonight. The Cardinal
(19-3.9-2 Pac-10) ventures south to the
Leavey Center for a 7 p.m. tip-off to
open a three-game road trip this week
that finishes at Oregon State on Satur
day.
The Broncos (16-5) are currently
second in the West Coast Conference
with a 5-2 league record.They picked up
the second of these losses on Saturday,
when Gonzaga halted their five-game
winning streak in an 88-52 decision.
With the return home, however. Santa
Clara will be looking to start a new
streak against the Cardinal.
Leading the charge for the Broncos
will be senior guard Chandice Cronk,
who averages 17.1 points per game,
good for fourth-best in the WCC. Inside,
senior forward Jen Gottschalk is a for
midable big, averaging 16.6 points and
8.4 rebounds per game. Other than
Gottschalk. though, the Broncos are rel
atively small and usually run a three- or
four-guard lineup.
ITiis backcourt has found success,
with junior Elizabeth Doran and senior
Tracey Walker both averaging in double
figures for scoring (10.8 and 10.1 ppg.re
spectively). As a team. Santa Clara also
boasts 75.3 percent shooting from the
stripe and 37.7 percent from long range,
both areas in which Stanford has strug
gled.
ITiough the Broncos may be able to
find an edge in free throws and threes,
the story of the night, as usual, will be
whether the Cardinal can remain fo
cused on its own capabilities. Home
court advantage and the prospect of a
marquee win against Stanford should
rally the Broncos, but they stand little
chance barring a slip-up on the Cardi
nal's end.
For one, senior guard Candice Wig
gins has become something of a one-

woman show, passing Stanford's all
time scoring and free-throw records in
the last week and earning her fourth
Pac-10 Player of the Week honor of the
season. She averages 18.7 points per
game and has registered 68 assists this
season.
Meanwhile, the inside combination
of sophomore Jayne Appel and fresh
man Kayla Pedersen has been nearly as
unstoppable. Both average near dou
ble-doubles: Appel averages 15.1 points
and 9 rebounds per game, while Peder
sen adds 12.4 points and 8.4 rebounds a
night.
It is Stanford's depth that will be key
in this meeting with Santa Clara anil
throughout the remainder of the sea
son.The highly acclaimed trio will likely
see a bit more rest than usual against the
Broncos, giving others a chance for
valuable minutes as the season winds
down.
With players like junior forward Jil
lian Harmon, sophomore guard JJ
Hones, freshman forward Jeanette
Pohlen and redshirt sophomore guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude each stepping
up as difference-makers at some point
already this season, Stanford figures to
find only more consistency from the
group.
Defensively, the Cardinal has also re
cently hit its stride. After shutting down
then-No. 8 California's leading scorers
Ashley Walker and Alexis Gray-Law
son the week before, Stanford forced
USC into a season-high 29 turnovers on
Thursday. In fact, the Cardinal defense
has helped Stanford win 28 of its last 34
games by at least a 10-point margin.
In short, the Cardinal heads to Santa
Clara looking to focus on the weaker
points of its own game, like shooting per
centages from behind the arc and at the
line. With seven consecutive victories
and a No. 6 national ranking, Stanford
has little to prove at Santa Clara beyond
its continued success.

Guards' passing at
center of Stanford
women's success

The Cardinal offense is clicking at the
right time, and the key seems to be the
floor leadership of the guards â€” their in
creasing ability to create opportunities
for themselves and others has led to good
results.
Senior Candice Wiggins, the undisput
ed Cardinal leader, has 68 assists, and
sophomore point guard JJ Hones, who
has started the past three games, has 51.
Reserve freshman guard Jeanette Pohlen
has totaled 50 assists off the bench, and
sophomore point guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude, usually the Cardinal's starter at
that position, has 47.
After Saturday's 75-62 win over
UCLA. Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
praised Hones's ability. In a rough game
in which she was often double-teamed,

Center Jayne Appel and the Cardinal have won seven straight
games since losing a pair of upsets in Los Angeles. They will be
looking for number eight tonight on the road against Santa Clara.
