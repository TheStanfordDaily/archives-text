While candidates crisscrossed the country deliver

undecided students made their final selections and
campus volunteers canvassed for their chosen horse

Students visited a lounge in Rohle for two hours
late Monday night to question representatives for the
Obama, Clinton, Romney and McCain campaigns —

largely undecided voters asked about issues like Iraq,
immigration and federal student aid.
Volunteers sat at tables with piles of printouts
detailing the candidates' positions. The event was
sponsored by the NAACP. Delta Sigma Theta. the
Black Student Union and MEChA.

wore buttons or shirts to class, mostly touting Sen.
