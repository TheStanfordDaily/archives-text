# California votes on Super Tuesday
## 22 states go to the polls for primaries; candidates look toward vital momentum 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
While candidates crisscrossed the country deliver
ing closing arguments on the eve of Super Tuesday,
undecided students made their final selections and
campus volunteers canvassed for their chosen horse
— in what polls show is a race too close to call.
Students visited a lounge in Rohle for two hours
late Monday night to question representatives for the
Obama, Clinton, Romney and McCain campaigns —
all answering inquiries and making pitches. About 35
largely undecided voters asked about issues like Iraq,
immigration and federal student aid.
Volunteers sat at tables with piles of printouts
detailing the candidates' positions. The event was
sponsored by the NAACP. Delta Sigma Theta. the
Black Student Union and MEChA.
A handful of undecided Stanford students drove to

San Francisco on Monday to hear from a surprise
guest at a Hillary Clinton rally, who turned out to be
Bill Clinton.
"You know we have always been there for you, in
good times and bad. we've been there for California,"
the former president told a large crowd of students at
Santa Ana College.
Around the stereotypically apathetic Stanford
campus, the excitement was palpable. Many students
wore buttons or shirts to class, mostly touting Sen.
Barack Obama (13-111.).
Stanford voters can cast their ballots today in the
Graduate Student Center's Havana Room on
Escondido Road, just off Campus Drive and behind
Mirrielees.
A flurry of emails and Facebook invitations touted
Super Tuesday viewing parties. The Kappa Alpha Psi
Fraternity promised free Krispy Kreme doughnuts
from 7 to p.m. in the Black Community Services

Center. Students at k V
nearly every Row / /
house said they / s /
planned parties for Zo. A
tonight to watch elec- /^\- v /
tion returns. The College /
Republicans planned a view- C
ing party in Mirrielees.
A handful of students have BECCA DEL MONTE/The
planned to volunteer at the Stanford Daii>
polls as monitors today. Rachael Johns TO signed up
to volunteer from 6 to 8 p.m. at a San Jose polling
place as part of the Korean American Coalition, a San
Francisco-based group which seeks to ensure that
handicapped and non-English speaking people can
vote.
" Hiis is something 1 can do to help the process and

make it work," she said, after attend
ing a training session over the week
end with two other Stanford stu
dents. "There have been cases where
there are really bad violations of
rules from poll workers. Doing this
can hopefully prevent that from hap
pening."
For the candidates, the stream of
visits to California continued this
week. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
was in Gradena Monday morning,
speaking at a Veterans of Foreign
Wars post. Mitt Romney added to
his schedule an 8 p.m. stop at the

Long Beach airport. The former
Massachusetts governor has been
trying to position himself as more
conservative than his chief rival,
McCain.
Yesterday, the candidates dueled
in the Northeast, through a flurry of
states stretching from New Jersey
and New York to Connecticut and
Massachusetts. Apart from
Clinton's home state of New York,
the polls in the region — and in
Missouri and California — told a
similar story, with the former First
Lady trying to fend off Obama's
late rush.
