## Giants slay Pats as a team 
### 
The All-Joes stunned the All-
Pros, but recent history shows
that this is hardly an aberra
tion.
In beating the New England Patri
ots, the New York Giants proved a
modern-day football trend: teams, not
individual superstars, are what ulti
mately bring you Super Bowl success.
Ironically, it was the Pats them
selves that began teaching us this les
son.
In the 2001-2002 season. New Eng
land was an upstart team led by Tom
Brady, an unknown quarterback who
had trouble winning a starting job in
college, and Bill Belichick, a previous
failure as a head coach. Yet they were
a team in every sense of the word:
units played very well together, but.
with the exception of the defensive
backfield, there were few superstars.
They entered Super Bowl XXXVI
as 14-point underdogs to the St. Louis
Rams, then the "Greatest Show on
Turf." That year. NFL MVP Kurt
Warner, along with the deadly Mar
shall Faulk — the NFL's Offensive
Player of the Year — and receivers
Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt would
lead the Rams to their second cham
pionship game in three years.
Instead of having individual player
introductions at the start of the game,
the Patriots ran out as a team — a rit
ual nearly every Super Bowl partici
pant has copied since — and history
ran its course: behind the passing of
Brady and the leg of Adam Vinatieri,
the Patriots pulled off the 20-17 upset.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and
Pittsburgh Steelers. who have both
won championships since, relied on a
host of players and on dominant de
fenses during their Super Bowl victo
ries. Last year's champion, the Indi
anapolis Colts, come closest to dis
proving this rule — the team was
guided by star quarterback Peyton
Manning but won their championship
on the coattails of their unheralded
defensive unit.
New England's other two Super
Bowl squads embodied this team
image as much as the first — though
they were no longer the unknowns
they were in 2002, they had few super
stars. Everyone was a contributor, and
no player was above another — New
England cut Pro-Bowl safety Lawyer
Milloy before the 2(H)3 season for re
fusing to restructure his contract for
the benefit of the organization.
But fast-forward to the 2(X)7 sea
son. The Patriots are a loaded team:
Brady is armed with Randy Moss,
perhaps the best receiver in football,
and Lawrence Maroney, a second
year back with great potential. New
England added Adalius Thomas, one
of the biggest free-agent signings of
the off-season, franchised star corner
back Asante Samuel and signed Wes
Welker, arguably the best slot receiv
er in the NFL.
With such an arsenal at hand, the
Patriots went on to finish the regular
season undefeated.They had the best
offense in NFL history and a top
ranked defense. The team, Brady and
Moss all set NFL records. The Pats
sent eight players to the Pro Bowl, the
most in the AFC.
A 19-0 finish was all but guaran
teed. and fans began making shirts
celebrating their perfection — the
Boston Globe started accepting pre

orders for a book entitled "19-0: The
Historical Championship Season of
New England's Unbeatable Patri
ots."
But then they ran into the Giants,
a 10-6 wildcard team with one Pro
Bowler and a bunch of misfits, as de
fensive end Michael Strahan called
them.
The Patriots' offensive line, which
sent three players to the Pro Bowl,
was manhandled by the Giants' de
fensive front — they received a rare
"F" from Sports Illustrated for their
"effort." Brady, who is rarely hit. was
pummeled routinely, and the eerie
confidence that he so often displays
seemed to vanish from his eyes.
The Giants' secondary, criticized
heavily throughout the season, pre
vented anything deep, right up until
the Pats' final series when Corey
Webster tipped away a sure touch
down from Brady to Moss. The Gi
ants forced three-and-outs all game
and held the most lethal offense in
history to just 14 points. Writer Dan
Shanoff called it the "greatest per
formance by a defense in Super Bowl
history."
Giants defensive coordinator
Steve Spagnuolo's schemes rely on
cohesion among all 11 players: he
blitzes more often than not, which re
quires his men in coverage to be espe

daily aware. The entire defense, and
not just a few star defenders, had to
show up. and they did.
Eli Manning, the much-maligned
Giants quarterback who seemed to
turn the proverbial corner in the play
offs, guided the offense to two touch
downs in the fourth quarter.The final
one came with just 35 seconds left
with the Pats up by four.
Ilie drive was highlighted by
David Tyree. a reserve receiver who
caught a third-down pass from Man
ning — after the quarterback miracu
lously evaded a number of pass rush
ers— behind his head for a 32-yard
gain. Shanoff. no Giants fan. called
this "the single greatest play in Super
Bowl history."
After Eli hoisted a touchdown
pass to the audacious Plaxico Burress,
the Patriots got one more crack on of
fense. But Webster's tip sealed the
win. and the Giants, a scrappy bunch
with few stars, knocked off the jugger
naut known as the New England Pa
triots.
Don't let anyone tell you differ
ently: the Giants won the Super Bowl
much more than the Pats lost it. And
they did it as a team.

and Lawrence Maroney, a second
year back with great potential. New
England added Adalius Thomas, one
of the biggest free-agent signings of
the off-season, franchised star corner
back Asante Samuel and signed Wes
Welker, arguably the best slot receiv
er in the NFL.
With such an arsenal at hand, the
Patriots went on to finish the regular
season undefeated.They had the best
offense in NFL history and a top
ranked defense. The team, Brady and
Moss all set NFL records. The Pats
sent eight players to the Pro Bowl, the
most in the AFC.
A 19-0 finish was all but guaran
teed. and fans began making shirts
celebrating their perfection — the
Boston Globe started accepting pre

orders for a book entitled "19-0: The
Historical Championship Season of
New England's Unbeatable Patri
ots."
But then they ran into the Giants,
a 10-6 wildcard team with one Pro
Bowler and a bunch of misfits, as de
fensive end Michael Strahan called
them.
The Patriots' offensive line, which
sent three players to the Pro Bowl,
was manhandled by the Giants' de
fensive front — they received a rare
"F" from Sports Illustrated for their
"effort." Brady, who is rarely hit. was
pummeled routinely, and the eerie
confidence that he so often displays
seemed to vanish from his eyes.
The Giants' secondary, criticized
heavily throughout the season, pre
vented anything deep, right up until
the Pats' final series when Corey
Webster tipped away a sure touch
down from Brady to Moss. The Gi
ants forced three-and-outs all game
and held the most lethal offense in
history to just 14 points. Writer Dan
Shanoff called it the "greatest per
formance by a defense in Super Bowl
history."
Giants defensive coordinator
Steve Spagnuolo's schemes rely on
cohesion among all 11 players: he
blitzes more often than not, which re
quires his men in coverage to be espe

daily aware. The entire defense, and
not just a few star defenders, had to
show up. and they did.
Eli Manning, the much-maligned
Giants quarterback who seemed to
turn the proverbial corner in the play
offs, guided the offense to two touch
downs in the fourth quarter.The final
one came with just 35 seconds left
with the Pats up by four.
Ilie drive was highlighted by
David Tyree. a reserve receiver who
caught a third-down pass from Man
ning — after the quarterback miracu
lously evaded a number of pass rush
ers— behind his head for a 32-yard
gain. Shanoff. no Giants fan. called
this "the single greatest play in Super
Bowl history."
After Eli hoisted a touchdown
pass to the audacious Plaxico Burress,
the Patriots got one more crack on of
fense. But Webster's tip sealed the
win. and the Giants, a scrappy bunch
with few stars, knocked off the jugger
naut known as the New England Pa
triots.
Don't let anyone tell you differ
ently: the Giants won the Super Bowl
much more than the Pats lost it. And
they did it as a team.
