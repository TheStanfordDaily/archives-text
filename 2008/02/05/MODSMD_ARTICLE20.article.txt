## Giants slay Pats as a team 
### 
The All-Joes stunned the All-
Pros, but recent history shows
that this is hardly an aberra
tion.
In beating the New England Patri
ots, the New York Giants proved a
modern-day football trend: teams, not
individual superstars, are what ulti
mately bring you Super Bowl success.
Ironically, it was the Pats them
selves that began teaching us this les
son.
In the 2001-2002 season. New Eng
land was an upstart team led by Tom
Brady, an unknown quarterback who
had trouble winning a starting job in
college, and Bill Belichick, a previous
failure as a head coach. Yet they were
a team in every sense of the word:
units played very well together, but.
with the exception of the defensive
backfield, there were few superstars.
They entered Super Bowl XXXVI
as 14-point underdogs to the St. Louis
Rams, then the "Greatest Show on
Turf." That year. NFL MVP Kurt
Warner, along with the deadly Mar
shall Faulk — the NFL's Offensive
Player of the Year — and receivers
Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt would
lead the Rams to their second cham
pionship game in three years.
Instead of having individual player
introductions at the start of the game,
the Patriots ran out as a team — a rit
ual nearly every Super Bowl partici
pant has copied since — and history
ran its course: behind the passing of
Brady and the leg of Adam Vinatieri,
the Patriots pulled off the 20-17 upset.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and
Pittsburgh Steelers. who have both
won championships since, relied on a
host of players and on dominant de
fenses during their Super Bowl victo
ries. Last year's champion, the Indi
anapolis Colts, come closest to dis
proving this rule — the team was
guided by star quarterback Peyton
Manning but won their championship
on the coattails of their unheralded
defensive unit.
New England's other two Super
Bowl squads embodied this team
image as much as the first — though
they were no longer the unknowns
they were in 2002, they had few super
stars. Everyone was a contributor, and
