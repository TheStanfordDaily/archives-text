## Card earns Oregon split Wrestling downs Ducks 24-15, loses to Oregon State by the same score 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling went into this weekend's pair of road duals
in Oregon riding a four-meet winning streak that had propelled
the team to a remarkable 10-2 start and a chance to match its best
win total in Stanford history. But while this year's Cardinal squad
clinched the second-best record in program history with its win
over Oregon on Friday, a disappointing loss to Oregon State on
Sunday dashed any hopes that Stanford might tie its all-time
mark.
The Cardinal dominated against Oregon (9-11.0-8 Pac-10) as
it has all year. No. 6 senior Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds pinned
his opponent, sophomore Zack Giesen notched a win by techni
cal fall at IK4 pounds, and No. 10 senior Josh Zupancic earned a
major decision victory at 157 pounds. Freshman Max Rosefigura
at 141 pounds, junior I.uke Feist at 174 pounds and sophomore
Jake Johnson at 197 pounds rounded out the Cardinal victors
against the Ducks; Stanford (11-3.4-2) went on to win the dual.
24-15.
However, coach Kerry McCoy's squad did not fare nearly as
Well in Corvallis against Oregon State (9-6.6-3) on Sunday Over
the years, the Beavers have proven to be a true Cardinal-killer,
having lost just once to Stanford since the series began in 1953.
That trend continued this season as the Cardinal fell. 24-15, losing
six of 10 matches.
"We were disappointed with the Oregon State match,"
McCoy said. "We felt like our guys kind of got caught up in the at
mosphere of being there at Oregon State and got out-fought a lit
tle bit.
"I think ()regon State was ready for that with the attitude that
[they'd) only lost to Stanford one other time,and this wasn't going
