## Card earns Oregon split Wrestling downs Ducks 24-15, loses to Oregon State by the same score 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling went into this weekend's pair of road duals
in Oregon riding a four-meet winning streak that had propelled
the team to a remarkable 10-2 start and a chance to match its best
win total in Stanford history. But while this year's Cardinal squad
clinched the second-best record in program history with its win
over Oregon on Friday, a disappointing loss to Oregon State on
Sunday dashed any hopes that Stanford might tie its all-time
mark.
The Cardinal dominated against Oregon (9-11.0-8 Pac-10) as
it has all year. No. 6 senior Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds pinned
his opponent, sophomore Zack Giesen notched a win by techni
cal fall at IK4 pounds, and No. 10 senior Josh Zupancic earned a
major decision victory at 157 pounds. Freshman Max Rosefigura
at 141 pounds, junior I.uke Feist at 174 pounds and sophomore
Jake Johnson at 197 pounds rounded out the Cardinal victors
against the Ducks; Stanford (11-3.4-2) went on to win the dual.
24-15.
However, coach Kerry McCoy's squad did not fare nearly as
Well in Corvallis against Oregon State (9-6.6-3) on Sunday Over
the years, the Beavers have proven to be a true Cardinal-killer,
having lost just once to Stanford since the series began in 1953.
That trend continued this season as the Cardinal fell. 24-15, losing
six of 10 matches.
"We were disappointed with the Oregon State match,"
McCoy said. "We felt like our guys kind of got caught up in the at
mosphere of being there at Oregon State and got out-fought a lit
tle bit.
"I think ()regon State was ready for that with the attitude that
[they'd) only lost to Stanford one other time,and this wasn't going

Sophomore Lindsay Burdette won both her singles and doubles matches against UNLV
in the Cardinal's dual-meet opener this weekend. The team will take a break from dual
competition this coming weekend at the ITA National Team Indoors in Wisconsin.
to be the second time that happened,"
he added.
Stanford raced out to a fast start
against the Beavers, as Gardner won
by technical fall and freshman Por
firio Madrigal followed with a 6-1 vic
tory at 133 pounds to give the Cardi
nal an 8-0 lead out of the gate. But the
Beavers answered back with a techni
cal fall victory and win by decision at
141 and 149 pounds to even the score.
Zupancic followed with a 14-5
major decision before the Beavers
began building their lead with deci
sions at 165 and 174 pounds. In the
Cardinal's final win of the dual, a 13-4
major decision at 184 pounds, Giesen
was penalized for unsportsmanlike
conduct following the match. As a re
sult. Stanford was docked a point
from its team score.
The penalty could have proved
costly, as it dropped Stanford's lead to
just one point with two matches re
maining. But the Beavers finished the
dual with a major decision victory at
197 pounds and a pin at heavyweight,
wiping out any tangible effect the of
ficial's decision could have had. As
McCoy explained, the high tensions
unique to Giesen's match may help
explain the sophomore's uncharac
teristic penalty.
"All it was is after the match he got
hyped up a little bit and pointed at the
crowd, and it was a hostile situation."
he said. "1 le's from southern Oregon,
right down the street from Oregon
State, and fans were calling him 'trai
tor' and booing him and stuff like
that.
"He really cares about the sport,
and 1 think he reallv believed that it

was a homecoming for him. So for it
to be his home area and have people
treat him that way, it was really disap
pointing for him. i lis emotions got the
best of him, and he kind of overreact
ed a little bit," he concluded.
Overall, if there was a positive to
take away from the weekend, it was
the continued dominance of Cardinal
senior stalwarts Gardner and Zupan
cic, who. as McCoy said, would be key

to Stanford's late season hopes.
"As seniors, as captains, as return
ing All-Americans, they are the pillars
of this program," McCoy said. "They
really set the bar high ... and they're
really doing a great job of leading by
example."
Leading by example is exactly
what the Cardinal will need in the
coming weeks as its season begins to
wind down. Stanford faces Cal Poly

on Friday before hosting Cal State-
Fullerton on Sunday. There will then
be just one regular season dual re
maining between Stanford and the
Pac-10 Championships, a match
against Arizona State on Feb. 17.
The conference tournament is set
to open on Mar. 2 in Eugene. Ore.

The Cardinal put together a strong effort against Oregon but came up short against Oregon State. Stanford has only
beaten the Beavers, the defending Pac-10 champions, once in more than 50 years of competition. The team will have
three more dual matches before taking on Oregon State again at the Pac-10 Championships in two weeks.
