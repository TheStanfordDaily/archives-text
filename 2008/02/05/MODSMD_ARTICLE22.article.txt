### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
On an overcast Friday afternoon,
the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team won its de facto season opener
against No. 41 UNLV, 6-1.
After an entire rain-soaked week
of postponed and cancelled matches,
the Cardinal finally fit in its first dual
match of the season at the Taube
Family Tennis Center against the
Runnin' Rebels. According to sopho
more Lindsay Burdette, the sun
couldn't have come at a better time.
"It felt really good to get back on
the courts," Burdette said. "We have
worked really hard since we got back
from Christmas break, and by the
time UNLV got here, we were really
excited and super fresh. Everybody
had a lot of energy, and it definitely
showed in the score."
Burdette teamed up with fresh
man Hilary Barte in an 8-3 win over
Elena Gantcheva and Kristina
Nedeltcheva for one of two Cardinal
doubles victories.
Then, in singles, Burdette took
down Nedeltcheva again, 6-1.6-3, at
the number two spot.
"I felt awesome out there," Bur
dette said. "We have a bigger team
this year and a lot fewer injuries than
last year, so we're really hungry to
play and win."
What kept the match from being a
season-opening sweep was junior
Jessica Nguyen's 6-2, 7-6 loss to
Gantcheva.
"It was my first match playing at
the number one position, so there
were different factors going into how

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women finally
saw the court for their first dual match of the
season after two were cancelled because of
bad weather. With a commanding win over
UNLV, and helped by a Georgia Tech loss,
the Cardinal will have the chance to take
over the top spot in the national polls from
the Yellow Jackets at this weekend's four-day
tournament. Top-seeded Stanford is sched
uled to open play on Thursday with Baylor.

I was coming onto the court mental
ly and physically," Nguyen said.
Down a set and a break in the sec
ond, Nguyen battled back, ultimately
losing in the second set tiebreaker.
"It was one of those situations
where Jessica was a little off and it
took her a minute to get going," Bur
dette said. "[Gantcheva] is such a
tough player."
Last year, Gantcheva also defeat
ed Theresa Logar '07 in the No. 1 sin
gles spot.
Nonetheless, the victory was a
dominant showing only boosted by
the performances of its freshmen:
Barte and No. 58 Carolyn McVeigh.
