# Q&A LARRY MARSHALL
## 
### 
Law Prof. Lawrence Marshall, director of Stanford's
legal clinics, is an informal campaign adviser to Obama.
He taught at Northwestern in Chicago for 18 years
before coming to Stanford in 2004. He has been
involved in the reform of the criminal justice system and
the death penalty, co-founding the Center on Wrongful
Convictions in 1999.
The Stanford Daily (TSI)): Why do you support Sen.
Obama's candidacy in the Democratic primaries?
Larry Marshall (LM): I 'm a Democrat and have sup
ported Democratic candidates in the past. I fully expect
ed to support Sen. Clinton (I)-N.Y.) this time around,
and I would have, if I didn't think Barack's candidacy

was of such historical importance. I'm a feminist, and 1
understand the critical importance of electing a woman
president. At the same time. I'm someone who's deeply,
deeply moved by civil rights, and I think it would be
equally profound to have someone of color elected.
I 've watched Barack build constituencies that every
one else thought could never be built: I've seen him do
things I've never seen any other politician do. That's
what has made me as drunk with enthusiasm as I am. It's
the difference between a good-old, same-old school of
politics candidate, and an extraordinary leader who can
reframe who we are as a nation. And when you realize
it's that way, it does become really easy to choose
between the candidates.
TSI): What motivated you to become involved with this
campaign?
I.M: I got involved in the Obama campaign before it
even began. I actually wrote him a letter urging him to
[run] when people were still debating whether he would
be a strong candidate. 1 wrote him urging him to seize
the moment based on the energy and excitement that I
was feeling among my own students about what his can
didacy could mean. They were energized in a way that I
had read about, that I knew had happened in the 19605,
but that I had never really experienced as an adult.
TSI): How do you think Obama differs from his com
petitor for the nomination. Sen. Clinton?
LM: In terms of the depths of vision, the leadership
aspect and the ability to inspire a nation, that's where I
think there's a huge difference. Sen. Clinton has talked
about the job as being that of an executive officer, that
of a bureaucrat almost. I don't think we need a bureau
crat. We need a president who sets a tone and vision,
that helps us to dream beyond what we are, and Obama
gets us to do that in ways that no other candidate in my
lifetime has.
TSI): Some of Clinton's supporters argue that Obama
lacks substantive plans to make his vision of change a
reality. What would you say to them?
I.M: I guess maybe what people are picking up on is his
unwillingness to commit to the micro-specifics of issues
before he's had the chance to engage with all the rele
vant constituencies. The thrust of his style is one of con
versation. It's one not of creating policies unilaterally
and then imposing them, hut instead of engaging in con
versation with allies and opponents to understand what

it will take to actually effect change.
TSD: Going into Super Tuesday, how do you feel about
the campaign?
FM: The level of support we're seeing nationally is real
ly extraordinary. It all comes down to getting out the
vote. All these Stanford students who are excited and
energized by this campaign, they have to understand
that â€” it's won or lost at the ballot box.
