# Q&A MARIANO-FLORENTIO CUELLAR
## 
### 
Law Prof. Mariano-Florentino Cuellar is the top
immigration adviser to Obama's campaign. Previously,
he worked on Bill Clinton's re-election campaign in
1996. He is an executive committee member of the
Stanford Center for International Security and
Cooperation and the Stanford International Initiative.
He has served as a senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury
Department's Under Secretary for Enforcement.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What motivated you to
become involved with Obama's campaign?
Mariano-Florentio Cuellar (MFC): Two things moti
vated me the most. First. I look around the world, and
I see a massive number of problems facing our genera
tion. These include global poverty, immigration, health
care, getting out of Iraq, dealing with globalization.
These problems can't be effectively resolved by the
American people without a different kind of leader
ship.
The other reason I support Sen. Obama is that he
has a great deal of courage and intellectual honesty.
You can see that in the position he took on Iraq back
when it was unpopular to come out against the war.
You can see that in how he levels with people on the
immigration issue, saying we need to increase the num
ber of visas, and that we shouldn't scapegoat, that we
need to work with poorer countries and develop a
comprehensive plan for reform. He's extremely deter
mined. and he's steadfast where others waver.
TSD: In this race, what do you think distinguishes Sen.
Obama from Sen. Clinton?
MFC: I think there are a couple of different issues.

There's a difference in how they approach the whole
role of the presidency, which is really important. I think
it's fair to say that Sen. Clinton views the presidency as
a chance to execute certain policies and implement an
agenda, whereas Sen. Obama views it, fundamentally,
as a means of transforming the way the American pub
lic approaches problems, and then, secondarily as a way
of achieving certain policy goals.
There's a difference with respect to immigration.
Sen. Clinton has stated that she would favor the auto
matic deportation of aliens who commit a crime with
out legal process, a stance that is considerably harsher
than current law. By contrast, we support international
law and believe humanitarian considerations are
important. We're more progressive, broadly speaking.
TSI): Some have leveled the charge that Sen. Obama is
style without substance, that he lacks concrete policies
to push his vision forward. What would you say to
them?
MFC: I think that's wrong. To put it more politely, I
think that undersells the reality.The reality is both can
didates have plans which are often quite detailed on
both sides. From our side, we often say exactly what we
will do. and we have a great group of advisers who have
been in policy positions before, who will help Sen.
Obama from day one. We've even been more specific,
for instance, on how the Department of Homeland
Security should address infrastructure security. We're
more detailed and thorough on questions of immigra
tion and global warming. We have a more detailed pro
posal for k-12 education.
TSI): Going into Super Tuesday, how do you feel about
the campaign?
MFC: 1 feel like we have come much further than many
people thought we would. It says something about the
campaign, but it also says something about the
American people. It shows that people are excited by
the idea that politics can be something different. That
excitement ought to he channeled into constructive
progress for the country.
I'm among the people who have worked on this
campaign who admire Sen. Clinton and President
Clinton. I worked in the Clinton administration.
Ultimately. I think everyone has a role to play in mak
ing American a better place. There's a chance for each
of us to make a difference no matter what happens.
