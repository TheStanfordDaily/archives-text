Government Policy Lunch with
Former Secretary of Defense

students questioned the one-time
leader of the powerful United States
military.
At noon, a group of about 30 stu
dents — mostly undergraduates —
gathered in the Haas Center's I).
Kennedy Room to talk policy and
diplomacy with the man who served
as Secretary of Defense under
President Clinton. The Hoover
Institution professor responded to
questions about his management of
the Department of Defense (DoD),
his technical background, military
strategy in Iraq and even the appro
priation of outer space for military
purposes.
Many of the students' questions
clustered around the Iraq War. the
region's fate and causes of the inva
sion and prolonged occupation.
Perry's answers were explicit, and he
didn't mince words as he-parsed the
administration's "big strategic blun
ders."
"I'm a strong believer in support
ing democracy, but 1 will never
believe in imposing democracy on a
country," Perry said.
Perry also spoke about his years
at the DoD.
Awaiting him was the monumen
tal task of overseeing "3 million peo
ple and a couple billion dollars a
year" as the head of the military and
those agencies comprised and fund
ed by the DoD.
"Aside from your boss — the
president — you had about S(H) peo
ple in Congress who thought they
were your boss too, and they had
ways of making you understand
that," Perry added.
Terming the DoD "an unman
ageable operation." Perry recounted
his managerial philosophy during
his term as the Secretary of Defense.
"I picked out three or four things
that 1 really wanted to happen while
I was Secretary, and I put 80 to 90
percent of my energy into achieving
them." he said.
His top priority was minimizing
nuclear threats and weapons prolif
eration. Another goal was to recruit
self-sufficient experts to the DoD's
ranks.
"When you depend on other peo-
pie. you better be damn sure that
you have the right people," Perry
said.
Perry's focus on eliminating
nuclear weapons has influenced his
work at the Hoover Institution,
where he is a senior fellow.
Collaborating with other distin
guished fellows George P. Shultz
and Henry A. Kissinger. Perry has
recently made policy recommenda
tions that envision and work
toward a world free of nuclear
weapons.
As a member of the "Iraq study
group," facilitated by the United

States Institute for Peace, Perry
and other senior and retired mili
tary strategists advised the current
administration on how to resolve
conflict in Iraq.
"We made recommendations for
extricating ourselves from Iraq
which the president did not
accept," he said, bluntly.
"It's always been a mystery to
me why really smart people like
Secretary Rumsfeld did not see that
it would take more than just defeat
ing the Iraqi army," he added.
Some students probed the
increasing militarization of China,
threats posed by military encroach
ments on space and the advantages
of using "soft" versus "hard" power
in foreign negotiations. Perry's
explanations were often anecdotal;
he drew upon examples from the

humanitarian crises in Bosnia and
Haiti which he helped to alleviate.
Ferry identified a "false dichoto
my" between soft- and hard-line
defense policies. His account of
how Russian forces were brought
into the NATO peacekeeping mis
sion in Bosnia illustrated a strategic
use of "soft" power.
"We didn't need the extra four
or five thousand troops, but what
we did need was the Russians
cooperating," he said. "The
required combination of Russian
and American troops turned out to
be a very good idea."
"Clearly it was the use of soft
power that made the difference,"
he added.
