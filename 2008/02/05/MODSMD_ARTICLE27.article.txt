# SPECIAL EVENTS
## Scientist offers new perspective on energy 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's vocal environmental
community heard an alternate
view as Steven Koonin, chief scien
tist at oil-giant BP in London,
delivered the annual Drell Lecture
at the Arrillaga Alumni Center
yesterday afternoon.
Koonin's speech, entitled
"Energy, Environment, Security:
Can We Have it All?" was spon
sored by the Center for
International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC) in the
Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies.
The scientist presented facts
and statistics on the current envi
ronmental situation. Koonin made
projections for the future and out
lined potential technological solu
tions and sociopolitical obstacles
that block those solutions.
"Energy use grows with eco

nomic development." he said. "So
energy use is not going to decrease
anytime soon."
"However," Koonin added,"we
won't run out of hydrocarbons
anytime soon."
Rather, the problem lies with
the security and climate dangers
behind fossil fuel emissions,
according to Koonin. Despite the
imminence of these dangers, ener
gy technology is difficult to change
due to the scale, Ã¼biquity and
longevity of energy equipment, as
well as the current economic mar
ket layout.
".Society is simply not very well
equipped to deal with problems of
this nature." Koonin said.
Koonin cited advanced biofuels
as the best candidates for future
energy sources and said that such
technology is within our reach.
However, the scientist questioned


Steven Koonin, a BP chief scientist, discussed the opposition inherent in
trying to cut energy use while promoting economic development yester
day at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
