## Law writer dishes on 1st Amend. 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In legal history, parts of the
Constitution can have their own life
stories.
Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
and New York Times columnist
Anthony Lewis spoke at the Law
School last night to promote his new
book. "Freedom For the Thought
ITiat We Hate: A Biography of the
First Amendment." Lewis structured
his remarks as a series of anecdotes,
recounting the history of how free
dom of speech evolved from the sedi
tion acts of World War I through the

publishing of the Pentagon Papers in
the 1970s and up to the present day.
"He has contributed to the legal
imagination of many people who
come through institutions like this,"
said L.aw Prof. Lawrence Lessig, who
moderated the session. "I think he's
the person most responsible for the
idealistic law student that law profes
sors love to have."
Lewis discussed the ins and outs
of many crucial Supreme Court deci
sions in the 2()th century.
"What we currently enjoy as free
dom of speech in this country did not
come from the 14 words of the first
amendment," Lewis said. "It came

from judicial interpretations that
were long in coming, and that had the
most extraordinary effect. I think the
average American thinks of freedom
of speech as a talisman that has
always been there and always been
enforced, but it's entirely the result of
creative and bold judges."
Lewis also explained the origin of
his book's title, referring back to his
time covering the Supreme Court for
The New York Times.
"Sometime around 1%0, 1 was
invited to Justice Frankfurter's office
for a chat." Lewis said. "Some news
paper had criticized him as insuffi
ciently liberal. He said.'l'll show you
liberal!"'
Lewis recounted how Justice
Frankfurter handed him a report
from Schwimmer v. Lewis, a 1929
case in which the Supreme Court
denied citizenship to a pacifist who
refused to promise that she would
take up arms for the national
defense. In a dissenting opinion,
Justice Holmes wrote that "some of

her answers might excite popular
prejudice, but if there is any princi
ple of the Constitution that more
imperatively calls for attachment
than any other it is the principle of
free thought — not free thought
for those who agree with us but
freedom for the thought that we
hate."
"And as I read, 1 felt the hair rise
on the back of my neck," Lewis said.
"There is no other judge anywhere
that would have written that at that
time."
Lewis also focused on the history
of freedom of speech for the press.
"James Madison said that 'the
press must be free to canvas the mer
its and measures of elected men,'"

Lewis said. "A key duty of the press
is disclosing what the government is
up to and holding it accountable."
As for the current state of free
dom of speech. Lewis saw cause for
optimism.
"On the whole, the first amend
ment is not a target for the majority
that controls the Supreme Court
today," he said. "An extraordinary
part of the last 25 years is that the
first amendment has won such broad
support."
He added. "People across the
political spectrum now say, 'We
believe in free speech."'
