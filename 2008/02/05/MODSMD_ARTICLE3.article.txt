## Dems talk race, sex as voting nears Identity seen as deciding factor for some voters 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Either a woman or an African
American will lead the Democratic
ticket in this November's election.
Talking about these historic firsts
has become somewhat cliche, a line
trotted out by Democrats eager to
shore up party unity in the wide-open
presidential race, but it remains a
flashpoint.
"Identity will be a big, huge fac
tor," said English Prof. Paula Moya,
who has written extensively on the
role of minority identity in politics.
"It's not going to be pretty. Negative
campaigning, especially when you
invoke race or gender, has worked."
With Democratic voters heading
to the polls in 22 states today, includ
ing California, analysts are closely
watching how well Barack Obama
(D-Ill.) and Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.)
can perform among the critical con
stituencies of women. Latinos and
African Americans.
Even on one of the most diverse
college campuses in the country, race
and gender have been part of the con
versation about the candidates. And
the way the battle is shaping up. it
seems possible that race or gender will
feature even more prominently in the
general election campaign than it has
in the primary.
About 60 people crammed into a
Tresidder Student Union meeting
room on Monday afternoon to listen
to four professors ponder the com
plexity of "identity politics" for over
90 minutes.
"Never in American history have
race and gender played such a promi
nent role," said Law School Prof.
Deborah Rhode, at an event spon
sored by University programs in
Ethics. Feminist Studies, Gender
Research and African American
Studies.
Obama has largely tried to tran
scend race in the campaign.
Supporters at his South Carolina vic
tory rally last month reportedly
cheered. "Race doesn't matter."
The Illinois senator, born of a
Kenyan father and an American
mother, faces a difficult balancing act.
