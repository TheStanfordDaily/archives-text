## Dems talk race, sex as voting nears Identity seen as deciding factor for some voters 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Either a woman or an African
American will lead the Democratic
ticket in this November's election.
Talking about these historic firsts
has become somewhat cliche, a line
trotted out by Democrats eager to
shore up party unity in the wide-open
presidential race, but it remains a
flashpoint.
"Identity will be a big, huge fac
tor," said English Prof. Paula Moya,
who has written extensively on the
role of minority identity in politics.
"It's not going to be pretty. Negative
campaigning, especially when you
invoke race or gender, has worked."
With Democratic voters heading
to the polls in 22 states today, includ
ing California, analysts are closely
watching how well Barack Obama
(D-Ill.) and Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.)
can perform among the critical con
stituencies of women. Latinos and
African Americans.
Even on one of the most diverse
college campuses in the country, race
and gender have been part of the con
versation about the candidates. And
the way the battle is shaping up. it
seems possible that race or gender will
feature even more prominently in the
general election campaign than it has
in the primary.
About 60 people crammed into a
Tresidder Student Union meeting
room on Monday afternoon to listen
to four professors ponder the com
plexity of "identity politics" for over
90 minutes.
"Never in American history have
race and gender played such a promi
nent role," said Law School Prof.
Deborah Rhode, at an event spon
sored by University programs in
Ethics. Feminist Studies, Gender
Research and African American
Studies.
Obama has largely tried to tran
scend race in the campaign.
Supporters at his South Carolina vic
tory rally last month reportedly
cheered. "Race doesn't matter."
The Illinois senator, born of a
Kenyan father and an American
mother, faces a difficult balancing act.
according to English Prof. Michele
Elam. She said he has been criticized
by some for not being "black enough"
and for "being too black" by others.
"He has not brought up his black
ness, except as a response," Moya
added. "He has also invoked his white
racial heritage. There's a very clear
message, saying, i'm not just black. 1
have Midwestern values.' Now what

are Midwestern values? It's a code
word for white values."
Gender has also been a part of
Clinton's bid. The attention that fol
lowed Clinton's "tearing up" incident
has been cited as one factor that
helped her win New Hampshire.
Her occasional reference to breaking
through the glass ceiling and her mar
riage to former President Bill Clinton
keeps her gender at the center of her
narrative.
Student feelings
Mondaire Jones *09, the ASSU

Vice President and former Program
Coordinator of the Black Community
Services Center, is supporting Obama
but insists that race had absolutely
nothing to do with his decision. He
thinks some of the media stories over
simplify the contest as being between
race versus gender when a lot more is
in play.
"1 happen to know several black
people who are supporting Hillary,
including my own dad." Jones said. "1
really don't think that color or race is
the overriding issue. When 1 have con
versations with people, people say
they're not just going to vote for him

because he's black or for her just
because she's a woman."
Students interviewed said they did
not make their decision solely
because of the candidate's race or
gender, even if they acknowledge it as
a factor.
ASSU Senator Andrew Lomeli "09
worked hard for former North
Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who
dropped out of the race. Now, he's
supporting Obama.
"It's definitely not a racial thing or
a community thing," he said. "It's a
personal thing."
At weekly meetings of "Vitality," a

Jewish women's health group on cam
pus, members have been talking
about the upcoming vote.
"How much does it matter to us as
women?" asked the group's leader,
Becca Tisdale '09. "Is it fair for us to
support her because she's a woman?
"We all agree that it's not enough,"
she said, noting she would vote for
Clinton but her group seemed about
evenly divided.
Clinton tends to lead among
women and Latino voters in national
polls, whereas Obama captures the
most support from younger people
and African Americans. Momentum
for Obama after South Carolina has
put the candidates on even footing in
national and statewide polls.
History
Race has always been a part of
America's political culture. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson, an expert on
Martin Luther King Jr., said race has
been the elephant in the room,
whether mentioned or not, during
every presidential election in
American history. From the Three-
Fifths Compromise to the Civil War,
Jim Crow and Nixon's Southern
Strategy, he said that racial fears have
always been a part of national elec
tions.
The 1964 election, when Lyndon
Johnson won in a landslide, was the
last time that the majority of white
and black Americans voted for the
same presidential candidate.
"1 hope that Barack Obama or
Hillary Clinton can be the candidate
that will at last get us to a new era of
discussion about race and gender,"
Carson said.

Analysts have predicted that the
Hispanic population's strong support
for Clinton, especially in southern
California, could help her win
California.
"Most people just see TV ads."
Moya said. Even if they don't have
evidence to support it. "Latinos don't
automatically think that a black presi
dent will represent their issues."
Foils show a clear gender gap that
aids Clinton among likely women vot
ers.
Rhode said she would prefer the
leadership of a feminist man over
some of the female leaders of other
industrialized powers any day.
"Putting women in power is not
the same thing as empowering
women," Rhode said to applause at
Monday's forum.
A student who has been volun
teering with Clinton's campaign said
she has seen an extra level of excite
ment for the New York senator from
women in their 4()s and s()s.
"Most of the females on campus are
probably pretty evenly divided," said
Mishan Araujo "OS, the northern
California chair of Women for I lillary.
"1 don't think it's one way or another,
but it's exciting to male and female fem
inists that a woman may get elected."
Moya said both Obama and
Clinton have very similar positions on
the issues as centrist Democrats.
"We're going to have to come
together in a serious way," she said,
"because that anti-woman or anti
black factor is going to become really
fierce."
