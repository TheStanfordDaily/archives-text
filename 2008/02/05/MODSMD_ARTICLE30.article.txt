## Journalist talks other side of Iraq Independent writer shares war experiences 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Author Dahr Jamail gave a bird's
eye view of the war in Iraq last night
in Kresge Auditorium. The talk
marked the fourth installment of the
"Iraq: Reframe" series, organized by
the Aurora Forum and Montalvo
Arts Center.
An independent writer who
embedded himself as a journalist
with Iraqi civilians, Jamail decided to
report on the Iraq War on the
ground. In 2003, Jamail flew to
Baghdad to rectify a situation: main
stream media, with some few excep
tions, had fallen down on their job,
Jamail told the audience.
According to Jamail, the basic
tenets of what was reported by main
stream media was not close to the
real situation in Iraq. Most media
coverage of the war in March 2004.
Jamail said, was geared toward
demonizing the Iraqi people.
"[The reports] were a grotesque
picture of reality," he told the audi
ence. "Hie fundamental understand
ing of what was reported was not
even close to the truth."
After he arrived in Iraq, Jamail
learned about how the embedded
journalists were given limited infor

mation by U.S. military officials.
"It was based on controlling
information," Jamail said. "After I
got there, 1 realized that journalists
had to sign a form in which they basi
cally agreed to censor their reports."
Although he did not have a press
pass, Jamail said he decided to report
on the war as an independent jour
nalist. His stories have been pub
lished in The Nation,The Guardian,
The Independent. Democracy Now!
and the BBC.
Jamail said that after the U.S. mil
itary invasion of Iraq, he witnessed
how the sectarian sentiment against
America exponentially increased.
"Sectarianism is only a result of
the occupation." Jamail said. " Ihe

entire city was infuriated.There were
measures taken by the military that
were collectively imposed and which
consequentially punished innocent
civilians."
When the floor opened up for
audience questions last night, a
member of the audience asked
Jamail what he thought about the
latest U.S. military surge.
"Currently, Sunnis are being paid
approximately $30() to $350 dollars a
month not to attack occupation
forces in Iraq," he answered. "Tribal
leaders are being paid with U.S. tax
payers' money to prevent them from
attacking U.S. forces."
Jamail also told the audience that
the death toll in Iraq has not been

accurately reported by mainstream
media. The slaughter of many inno
cent Iraqi civilians has greatly
impacted the perception of the U.S.
occupation in Iraq, according to
Jamail.
"It is spreading resentment and
hatred around the Muslim world,"
Jamail said.
In April 2004. Jamail sent an
email to 150 foreign editors of major
U.S. media outlets, asking them to
cover the human rights abuses that
were being committed on the
ground.
"No one replied." Jamail said.
