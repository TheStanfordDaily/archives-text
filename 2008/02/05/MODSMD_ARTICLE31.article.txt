# STUDENT GROUPS
## New Daily building breaks ground $2.75 million budding to rise behind Old Union 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM DESK EDITOR 
Nearly three dozen people —
including University administrators
and former and current Daily staff
members — turned out for the offi
cial groundbreaking of Ibe Daily's
new 5.000-square foot office yester
day morning.
The hour-long ceremony was a
"symbolic but important step in The
Daily's long journey towards creat
ing a 21st century news room where
students can enjoyably learn the craft
of journalism," according to James
Hohniann '09, a former Daily editor
and a current member of the build
ing committee.
The Daily's new home will be
located in a converted parking lot
behind Old Union at Panama Mall
and Duena Street. The structure, a
two-story stand-alone building, is
expected to be ready for move-in by
fall 2008.
The building was designed by
Cody Anderson Wasney architects,
whose team includes Chris Wasney
*80, a former Daily editor himself.
Former Daily editor Lorry Lokey
'49 took a ceremonial dig of earth
from the ground with a gold-plated
shovel.
"For some, this has been nearly
two decades in the making,"
1 lohmann said. "We're almost there."
Lokev has been instrumental in

financial support for the new build
ing, donating $2 million to the project
as well as supporting a matching chal
lenge in which he will meet all other
alumni donations, up to $1 million.
According to The Daily's Chief
Operating Officer Julie Yen *07, of
the $3.75 million budget for the proj
ect. nearly $3 million has been raised.
Lokey's gift has been met with
nearly $200,000 of fellow alumni sup
port. The Daily has pledged $100,000
from its revenue toward the project,
and the separate Friends of the
Stanford Daily foundation has prom
ised $500,000.
That leaves approximately
$475.0(X) thousand dollars in "critical
gap," a figure that The Daily is still
seeking to raise, according to Yen.
The Daily's need for a new space
is prompted by two main concerns.
One is the University's future plans
to expand Terman Engineering and
relocate publications residing in
Storke.The Daily's current home. In
addition. Yen noted concerns with
the physical plant at Storke, includ
ing problems with last week's rain
storms.
"During the heavy rain, several
roof tiles fell down, the business
office flooded," Yen said. "Things
like that really highlight the need for
a functional space.'"
In the end. Hohmann said, yester
day's groundbreaking and the
"tremendous outpouring of support"
made Monday "a very exciting
moment in The Daily's long and sto
ried history."
