professors currently advising presidential contenders: John
Taylor, a professor of economics and an adviser to Senator
John McCain (R-AZ).and Larry Marshall and Mariano-Florentino
Cuellar, both law professors helping Senator Barack Obama (D

it's an "opportunity to flesh out where we think the country is
going."

ly involved in advising presidential campaigns this year, both for
