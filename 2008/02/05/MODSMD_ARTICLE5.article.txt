# Q&A JOHN B. TAY LOR
## 
### 
Economics Prof. John B. Taylor, also a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, is an economics adviser to John McCain. As
undersecretary of the Treasury Department under President Bush,
he shaped government policy on international finance. The former
adviser to Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush started helping the
Arizona senator in January 2(X)7, before he officially announced he
was running. He says the advising he does is "largely informal,"
from exchanging emails with other top economists to flying into

Virginia for meetings at campaign headquarters.
TSI): Some pundits have criticized Sen. McCain for his lack of
expertise in economics, saying he lacks the know-how to formulate
good policy. As one of his advisers, what would you say to them?
JTi I think he has very good basic instincts about the economy. For
example, he believes in the importance of controlling government
spending to keep the deficit down and to reduce taxes. On interna
tional economic issues, he advocates open trade, and he's taken a
stance against certain subsidies, such as corn-based ethanol, that are
inefficient. His disciplined approach to spending is
something I agree with strongly.
TSI): How do you think McCain's policy differs from
that of the other candidates?
JT: On the economic side, you can look at their pro
posals. Romney has some sensible economic propos
als. while Huckabee hasn't focused on the economic
side at all. I think overall, though, the distinction
between the economic proposals of any of the
[Republican] candidates isn't that significant if you
compare it to the distinction between Republicans and
Democrats. There is much more of a policy difference
between the parties than between any of the individ
ual candidates within each party. If you look at the
experience of the candidates though, there's a lot of
difference there, and I think McCain's experience in
making policy at the national and the international
level is a real advantage.
TSI): What do you think about how the campaign has
gone so far?
JT: This has been a very interesting campaign because
the field and the primary have been so wide open. There
have certainly been ups and downs. Just last summer
McCain was way down in the polls. Before that he was
up. then he went down, now he's back up again. It's a
very exciting campaign, and I think it will continue that
way after the nomination.
