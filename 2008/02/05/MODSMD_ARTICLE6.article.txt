## Details of West Campus thefts emerge Burglars attempted Wednesday break in: arrested on Thursday 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Three suspects — two men and one woman
were arrested late Thursday afternoon in con
nection with a string of burglaries last week in
several West Campus dormitories. After making
off with students' laptops, iPods and other elec
tronic devices, the suspects were apprehended
outside of Granada.
Approximately 20 victims of the burglaries
have come forth, with at least 14 in Sterling Quad
alone, but other residences may have also been
targeted, according to Teresa Riseborough.
Governors Corner's regional housing manager.
Riseborough said that the burglars had been
staking out residences on campus as early as the
day before and had drawn suspicion from resi
dents in several housing facilities.
"On Wednesday afternoon, those three were
seen in Lagunita," she said.
Following the arrest of the suspects Thursday
afternoon, Riseborough's office received an
email at approximately 7 p.m. from a graduate
student in Lyman who had seen a group of indi
viduals attempting to break into the residence on
Wednesday.
Also on Wednesday afternoon, one Roble
staff member was alerted that two unknown
individuals were wandering through the facility
and purposefully avoiding contact with resi
dents. When approached by the staff member,
they simply walked away from the premises. In
the hours that followed, numerous emails were
exchanged between residents and dorm staff
warning of the presence of unknown individuals
in the building.
Riseborough said that the burglaries could
have been avoided had greater precaution been
taken between Wednesday, when the dorms
were being staked out, and Thursday, when the
robberies occurred. She also advised that, in the
future, dorm residents should be more wary of
allowing strangers into buildings.
"This should have never happened," she said.
"Somebody allowed them to come in behind
them. That is the issue."
In the aftermath of the burglaries,
Riseborough said that greater precaution will
need to be taken at residences across campus in
order to prevent a repeat of Thursday's incident.
In addition to keeping unknown persons from
entering residences, she advised that students
take warning signs of intrusion more seriously.
"If that student (from Lyman) had called the
police when they tried to break in," she said.
"Sterling Quad would have never happened."
