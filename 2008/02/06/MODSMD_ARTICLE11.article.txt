I really respect the libertarians that I have
met at Stanford. They tend to he intelli
gent people who believe in unconvention
al solutions to nearly insurmountable prob
lems. I also think that their ideology is silly
and I refuse to be cowed by their reasoned
arguments. It just feels wrong, and 1 am will
ing to leave it at that.
For those not in the know, libertarians be
lieve that the government should have mini
mal power, and that most, if not all. problems
can be solved through market forces. For in
stance, they tend not to believe in the crimi
nalization of private acts, such as sodomy,
drug use, polygamy, abortion. They are
against high taxes, regulations like food and
drug certification and workplace safety
guidelines, government intervention in for
eign countries, and social programs such as
government-subsidized health-care, food
stamps or unemployment insurance.
It's an extremely attractive philosophy —
if people were left to themselves, if they were

kept safe and if contracts between them were
enforced, everything would just sort of turn
out okay.
Many of these programs, such as isolation
ism and ending the war on drugs, are ones I
find attractive.The rest strike me as extreme
ly radical and likely to end poorly.
But I try not to argue with libertarians,
mostly because 1 know i will get schooled six
ways to Sunday. Libertarians tend to be ex
tremely well-read. They know what they be
lieve, why they believe it, why it is better than
everything else and they have the facts and

figures to prove it. When you put someone
like that against a scatter-shot thinker like
me, who hasn't done any research, I am
hound to lose.
In fact I've been crushed in arguments by
people who believed in a wide variety of silly
things — opponents of global warming, intel
ligent design proponents, 9/11 conspiracy
theorists and moon landing skeptics. If you
wander onto their Web sites, you start to be
lieve that stuff yourself. You can prove al
most anything if you only cite the evidence
that supports your view and twist the rest
around.
These people find "anomalies" that run
counter to the accepted wisdom. For in
stance, moon skeptics wonder why there are
not stars in the background of the landing
photos. 9/11 conspiracy theorists toss out all
kinds of stuff about the melting point of steel.
And intelligent design proponents wonder
