# You're Not Special
## Stop. Please. Just Stop

I really respect the libertarians that I have
met at Stanford. They tend to he intelli
gent people who believe in unconvention
al solutions to nearly insurmountable prob
lems. I also think that their ideology is silly
and I refuse to be cowed by their reasoned
arguments. It just feels wrong, and 1 am will
ing to leave it at that.
For those not in the know, libertarians be
lieve that the government should have mini
mal power, and that most, if not all. problems
can be solved through market forces. For in
stance, they tend not to believe in the crimi
nalization of private acts, such as sodomy,
drug use, polygamy, abortion. They are
against high taxes, regulations like food and
drug certification and workplace safety
guidelines, government intervention in for
eign countries, and social programs such as
government-subsidized health-care, food
stamps or unemployment insurance.
It's an extremely attractive philosophy —
if people were left to themselves, if they were

kept safe and if contracts between them were
enforced, everything would just sort of turn
out okay.
Many of these programs, such as isolation
ism and ending the war on drugs, are ones I
find attractive.The rest strike me as extreme
ly radical and likely to end poorly.
But I try not to argue with libertarians,
mostly because 1 know i will get schooled six
ways to Sunday. Libertarians tend to be ex
tremely well-read. They know what they be
lieve, why they believe it, why it is better than
everything else and they have the facts and

figures to prove it. When you put someone
like that against a scatter-shot thinker like
me, who hasn't done any research, I am
hound to lose.
In fact I've been crushed in arguments by
people who believed in a wide variety of silly
things — opponents of global warming, intel
ligent design proponents, 9/11 conspiracy
theorists and moon landing skeptics. If you
wander onto their Web sites, you start to be
lieve that stuff yourself. You can prove al
most anything if you only cite the evidence
that supports your view and twist the rest
around.
These people find "anomalies" that run
counter to the accepted wisdom. For in
stance, moon skeptics wonder why there are
not stars in the background of the landing
photos. 9/11 conspiracy theorists toss out all
kinds of stuff about the melting point of steel.
And intelligent design proponents wonder

it
how the eyeball could have evolved
in a single step.
My cursory research shows there
is a bunch of people out there willing
to spend hours refuting these argu
ments. But, to be honest, reading
those arguments (and the resulting
counter-arguments) seems like a
waste of effort, and 1 prefer to just
avoid the debate entirely.
From an early age, I was taught to
challenge authority and be skeptical.
1 was taught that the essence of sci
ence is not to take anything for
granted. But 1 am not a scientist. I am
banking that these ideas are so likely
to be false that the mental energy 1
would spend on critically analyzing
them is a waste of time.
1 still think libertarianism is ex
tremely attractive. It is the sort of
philosophy that purports to solve
any problem. 1 am wary of anything
that seems to explain so much (Bud
dhism falls into this category too,
silly neo-hippies). In my experience,
life is messy, and complicated, and
the most reasonable solutions tend
to be a jumble of stuff in the middle.

Libertariansism strikes me as more
of a religion, and as such it requires
that you take a lot on faith.
My grandfather taught me to be
wary of all-encompassing philoso
phies. He became a newspaper
columnist after a life as a communist
labor organizer in India. Despite re
taining his belief in communism
until the end of his life, he was im
mensely proud that his three daugh
ters were educated in America and
were safely ensconced in the capital
ist system.
When they made fun of him for
this, he used to say, "Every world
view has contradictions."
This column will be inconsistent.
It will be illogical. At times 1 will cas
tigate those 1 praise at other times. I
will make leaps of logic. And 1 will
shy away from any over-arching
worldview.
Perhaps in my belief that the
world cannot be explained through
any simple lens, 1 am just like the lib
ertarians. Perhaps it is merely a
dogma for me. But, if so, 1 am content
with that.
