## Universal Healthcare: Mandates or Not? 
### 
The question of whether or not to in
clude insurance mandates as part of a
national healthcare policy has emerged
as a major issue in the debate about the
healthcare proposals offered by the three
leading Democratic presidential candidates:
Senators Hillary Clinton John Edwards and
Barack Obama. (Edwards has since dropped
out of the race.) In seeking to evaluate the
different proposals, it is important to place
this issue in proper perspective.
The common objective of all the propos
als is to arrive at a system of universal health
care. The key issue is about how to get there.
Mandates are simply one practical measure
aimed at meeting that objective, and may not
be the most effective among competing alter
natives.
More importantly, the process of getting
there is essentially a political one. It requires
the ability to negotiate the battles within the
U.S. Congress and the turbulent waters of
competing interest groups lobbying for influ
ence, and to win a widely acceptable legisla

tive package. The really key issue, then, is,
who among the candidates has the demon
strated capacity to succeed in this effort?
As to the specific question of mandates,
the crucial factors to consider are: compli
ance, affordability and public perception.
Dependence on voluntary compliance is
never sufficient to ensure full compliance
with any mandate — think of automobile in
surance. Enforcement may require a penalty
for noncompliance but still fail to guarantee
compliance. A financial penalty imposes an
additional cost on those who can least afford
it. A jail sentence would likely be considered
morally reprehensible by most people.
Affordability is the critical threshold fac
tor determining compliance by low-income
individuals and families, a sizeable chunk of
the population needing coverage. Provision
of income-based subsidies would allow
bringing them into the network. That entails
an additional charge on the federal budget
which cannot be avoided, whatever the poli
cy-measure adopted, if low-income families

are to he covered. (All the proposals seek to
pay for this, in part, by reversing the Bush tax
cuts on higher incomes.)
Some critics express concern about a pos
sible "free rider problem": absent a mandate,
some of those who can afford insurance may
choose to avoid buying it until they actually
need healthcare. It is argued that this would
impose an unfair additional burden on exist
ing full-time payers, who must pay the cost of
running the healthcare system. The critics,
however, have offered no evidence to indi
cate how large a problem that is likely to be.
or if it will be one at all. If it in fact proves to
be one, the solution must also resolve the
mandate enforcement problem.
There is a widespread perception that
mandates are a way of "forcing upon the pub
lic policies designed by a remote bureaucra
cy or by "big government." That perception,
whether well founded or not, is a significant
barrier to overcome in the legislative process
by any policy relying heavily on
health insurance mandates.
The proposals offered by the De
mocratic candidates are strikingly
similar in many respects. But, as to
the specific role of mandates, there is
a substantive difference between
them.
The Clinton and Edwards pro
posals both rely on up-front man
dates requiring everyone to buy in
surance. Edwards favors automatic
enrollment via tax returns, which af
fects only those who actually pay in
come tax. Although he provides sub
sidies for low income families, he
otherwise fails to guarantee full com
pliance and universal coverage. Clin
ton's proposal leans towards man
dates up front, but says little or noth
ing about how to ensure compliance.
Obama offers a mixed package with
built-in flexibility and sequencing of

components: an up-front mandate
for children hut not for adults, auto
matic enrollment with an opt-out op
tion and (a recent addition) a
retroactive premium penalty for
"free riders," subsidies for low in
come families, heavy emphasis on
prioritizing cost reductions through
out the healthcare system as a way of
ensuring universal affordability as
well as efficiency, followed by man
dates for any remaining uncovered
population as a last resort if proved
to be needed.
1 do believe that when the differ
ent proposals are examined in depth
and scored in terms of the issues of
compliance, affordability and public
perception, the Obama proposals
have the leading edge as the pre
ferred option.
In the final analysis, however,
what counts is the capacity to survive
the searing battle of the legislative
process and emerge with a package
widely accepted by the electorate.
ITiis is, and should be, the bottom
line in judging the proposals. The
president — with his or her execu

tive power as the final arbiter of this
process and ability to exploit the
bully pulpit to gain public support,
along with the qualities that the indi
vidual brings to the office (trans
parency. persuasiveness, leadership,
determination and forcefulness in
dealing with powerful opposing
pressures) — is in a unique position
to determine the outcome.
For this purpose, the candidates
must be judged on the basis of their
actual record of experience and per
formance in the legislative arena.
Though Edwards has now dropped
out of the race, he must be applaud
ed for having been the first in this
campaign to put forward a detailed
set of proposals. Now. though, it
comes down to a choice on the mer
its between Clinton and Obama.
Clinton lays claim to, and can be
justly lauded for. long experience in
the political arena. But, given the ex
traordinary opportunity during her
husband's administration to make a
major breakthrough in healthcare
legislation, her own efforts in this
most relevant and critical case result-

Ed in a disastrous failure (a paper by
UC-Berkeley Economics Professor
Brad DeLong, one of the policy
making insiders curing that debacle,
provides valuable insights into the
causes of this failure — http://www.j
bradford-delong.net/TotW
system.html). Obama, in his eight
years serving in the Illinois legisla
ture and three so far in the U.S. Sen
ate, has shown a well documented
and highly regarded record of lead
ership and successful achievement in
enacting significant legislation in
many areas of public policy: health
care, poverty, crime, civil rights,
ethics, foreign policy and the envi
ronment. This record bodes well for
his ability to do an outstanding job as
President and to secure passage of
path-breaking healthcare legisla
tion.
