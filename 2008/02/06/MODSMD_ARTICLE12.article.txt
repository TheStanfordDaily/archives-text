## Universal Healthcare: Mandates or Not? 
### 
The question of whether or not to in
clude insurance mandates as part of a
national healthcare policy has emerged
as a major issue in the debate about the
healthcare proposals offered by the three
leading Democratic presidential candidates:
Senators Hillary Clinton John Edwards and
Barack Obama. (Edwards has since dropped
out of the race.) In seeking to evaluate the
different proposals, it is important to place
this issue in proper perspective.
The common objective of all the propos
als is to arrive at a system of universal health
care. The key issue is about how to get there.
Mandates are simply one practical measure
aimed at meeting that objective, and may not
be the most effective among competing alter
natives.
More importantly, the process of getting
there is essentially a political one. It requires
the ability to negotiate the battles within the
U.S. Congress and the turbulent waters of
competing interest groups lobbying for influ
ence, and to win a widely acceptable legisla

tive package. The really key issue, then, is,
who among the candidates has the demon
strated capacity to succeed in this effort?
As to the specific question of mandates,
the crucial factors to consider are: compli
ance, affordability and public perception.
Dependence on voluntary compliance is
never sufficient to ensure full compliance
with any mandate â€” think of automobile in
surance. Enforcement may require a penalty
for noncompliance but still fail to guarantee
compliance. A financial penalty imposes an
additional cost on those who can least afford
it. A jail sentence would likely be considered
morally reprehensible by most people.
Affordability is the critical threshold fac
tor determining compliance by low-income
individuals and families, a sizeable chunk of
the population needing coverage. Provision
of income-based subsidies would allow
bringing them into the network. That entails
an additional charge on the federal budget
which cannot be avoided, whatever the poli
cy-measure adopted, if low-income families

are to he covered. (All the proposals seek to
pay for this, in part, by reversing the Bush tax
cuts on higher incomes.)
Some critics express concern about a pos
sible "free rider problem": absent a mandate,
some of those who can afford insurance may
choose to avoid buying it until they actually
need healthcare. It is argued that this would
impose an unfair additional burden on exist
ing full-time payers, who must pay the cost of
running the healthcare system. The critics,
however, have offered no evidence to indi
cate how large a problem that is likely to be.
or if it will be one at all. If it in fact proves to
be one, the solution must also resolve the
mandate enforcement problem.
There is a widespread perception that
mandates are a way of "forcing upon the pub
lic policies designed by a remote bureaucra
cy or by "big government." That perception,
whether well founded or not, is a significant
barrier to overcome in the legislative process
