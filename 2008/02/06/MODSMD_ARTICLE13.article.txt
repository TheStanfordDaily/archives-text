## Geneticist argues for God's existence 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 5,2006, Time Magazine
published a cover story on the
"God vs. Science" debate featuring
two prominent scientists, Francis
Collins and Richard Dawkins. In
the coming month, this debate will
be reenacted at Stanford.
Collins is a renowned geneticist
famed for heading the 1993-2000
Human Genome Project that
resulted in mapping a successful
blueprint of human DNA. Aside
from his scientific endeavors, how
ever. Collins is also recognized as a
religious man. Last night, he deliv
ered a lecture in Memorial
Auditorium to a packed audience,
discussing his personal confidence
in the compatibility of science and
faith.
ITie rebuttal to Collins' speech
will be delivered by his long-time
opponent in the faith versus science
debate and fellow renowned
geneticist, Richard Dawkins.
Dawkins will be speaking as part of
the Aurora Forum lecture series at
Stanford on March 9.
Collins' speech titled "The
Language of God: A Scientist-
Believer Looks at the Human
Genome" focused on the question:
are science and faith compatible?
Collins certainly believes so: he uti

lized both his personal experience
with faith and logical evidence to
support his theory that God exists.
To begin, Collins recounted his
background in science and his ini
tial skepticism regarding faith.
"I wasn't exposed to faith very
much." Collins said. "As a physics
and science person, faith just didn't
seem very plausible to me."
Collins' personal revelation in
faith occurred during a medical
internship.
"As I sat at the bedside of an
elderly woman with severe heart
failure, she decided to tell me all
about her faith and the strength it
gave her." Collins said. "Then she
turned to me and asked. 'What do
you believe in?"'
"Her question made me
extremely uncomfortable," Collins
continued. "And I realized that as a
scientist. I had done something very
illogical: I had written off faith
without looking at the evidence."
After reading C'.S. Lewis' "Mere
Christianity" — whieh was distrib
uted free of charge after the lecture
Collins eventually embarked on
a spiritual journey that led him to
Christianity.
"As 1 explored faith more and
more. I realized that naturalism has
limits to understanding the natural
world." Collins said. "There are
some questions that cannot be
answered by science."
Collins further explored ideas
such as the concept of the Big
Bang, the precise tuning of physical
constants in the universe and the
Moral Law present largely only in
human beings to explain aspects of
nature that justify God's existence.
"Iliere are a few constants, such
as the gravitational force, that, if
changed by even a little, would not
allow this present universe to
exist," he said. "It is nearly impossi
ble that nature could have reached
these constants on its own."
Collins ultimately proposed an
alternative solution in the science
versus faith debate: the idea of
"'lTieistic Evolution," which rests
on the principle that an all-power

ful God created the mechanism of
evolution to spur diversity and
advancement of humanity.
While Collins" speech addressed
many areas of the faith versus sci
ence debate, not all audience mem
bers found his arguments com
pelling or logical.
"I found some things that he
said doubtful." said Neil Gupta, a
graduate student in electrical engi
neering. "For example, 1 just don't
buy the idea that only humans have
Moral Law, or that our evolution
has slowed. Evolution is just evolv
ing."
1 lowever. to some conflicted sci
ence students, Collins' speech was
enlightening and thoughtful.
"Personally, as a Christian. I'm
dealing with these questions of
faith," said Dan TUcker '09. "It's
encouraging that he could resolve
the religion versus science conflict
in a logical and coherent way."
