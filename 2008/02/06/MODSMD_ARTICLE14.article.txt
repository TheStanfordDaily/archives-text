## University admits 16 through QuestBridge 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As colleges boost their financial
aid packages for the 2008-09 school
year, they are scrambling to make
elite education available to students
of all economic backgrounds.
Stanford is no exception: for the sec
ond year, the University is partici
pating in the Questßridge match
program and has already accepted
16 participants for the class of 2012.
ITie Questßridge application —
which Stanford accepts in addition
to the Common Application — is
specially geared towards low
income students.
"Our mission is to change the
demographic of decision making in
the U.S.. and now we are at the first
step of that — the college admis
sions piece," said Questßridge CEO
Tim Brady '90. "Elite colleges could
n't find these [disadvantaged] stu
dents, so we came up with the col
lege match process in 2(X)4."
After submitting applications to
Questßridge, some students are
named finalists and have their appli
cations forwarded to 20 partner col
leges including schools like Yale and
Princeton. Finalists rank
Questßridge's partner colleges, and
if one of their selections chooses to
accept them, they are notified of the
'match' before the regular early
action notification date.
"The application includes essay
questions that help to bring out
some of the really good characteris
tics that come out from a low
income childhood," Brady said. "We
get these students to talk about their
situations."
Of the 1,792 Questßridge final
ists this year, over 1,100 ranked
Stanford.

Assistant Dean for Diversity
Outreach DeAngela Burns-Wallace
'96 said that Stanford does not grant
these 1,100 applicants any special
treatment because of their
Questßridge status.
"Questßridge students are evalu
ated under the same criteria as all
applications," Burns-Wallace said.
Burns-Wallace claimed that stu
dents applying through the college
match process are admitted at a rate
similar to Stanford's notoriously low
10 percent admissions rate.
"Kids still get admitted based on
their own merit, so the rate is cer
tainly not wildly different," Brady
explained. "But the fact that these
are at-risk kids from severe back
grounds. the acceptance rate is a
pretty big statement."
While the number of
Questßridge applicants 'matched'
with Stanford is small — there have
been 25 matches to date — Burns-
Wallace praised how the program
has brought students to Stanford
who normally would have shied
away from applying.
" Iliere are amazing students that
are currently on our campus," she
said, "many of which would not have
considered Stanford, for financial
reasons, without learning more
about our financial aid programs
through Questßridge."
The Questßridge program start
ed on the Stanford campus 14 years
ago as a five-week summer program
for disadvantaged rising high school
seniors. Today, Questßridge has
expanded its reach, and through the
matching program, has helped 650
students gain admission to top
schools since 2004.
