## Transplant technique succeeds 
### MIMA MOHAMMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Born with only one kidney, 50-year-old Larry
Kowalski received a kidney and marrow from his
brother at Stanford Hospital in 2005. Normally,
Kowalski would have needed daily drugs for the
rest of his life. But thanks to the Stanford School of
Medicine, he has been medication-free for two
years.
Transplant recipients are typically matched as
closely as possible with donor organs, but the danger
that a recipient's own body will reject the organ
remains. Without drugs to suppress a reaction, the
recipient's immune system normally encounters unfa
miliar proteins that can attack the organ and gradual
ly destroy its function. As a result, patients need a life
time of immunosuppressive drugs.
The breakthrough with Kowalski occurred thanks
to a new technique in which he received radiation tar
geted at the immune system, along with a drug that
reduces the number of cells that could attack the
immune system. He then received stem cells from the

kidney donor that made their way to his marrow,
enabling his body to recognize the donor's organ.
Doctors then began to taper the use of Kowalski's
medication, which he no longer needed after six
months.
The only complication Kowalski experienced was
fever-related hospitalization. He returned to work as a
restaurant owner three months after the transplant.
Medical Prof. John Scandling, who served as
Kowalski's kidney transplant specialist, said results
from six patients following Kowalski's process are
pending. Initial trials have only been limited to identi
cal match donor recipients — people who have
received a kidney from a sibling.
Despite Kowalski's success, Scandling stressed that
fine tuning still needs to take place in trials.
"We are still working to see the result of other
transplant patients," he said. "We may have just been
lucky with this patient, but we have found it is an
encouraging result."
