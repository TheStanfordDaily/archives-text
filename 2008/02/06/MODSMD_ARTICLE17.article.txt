## ASSU urges transparency on campus 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At last night's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting. Senators discussed
increasing the group's transparency on
campus and maintaining momentum
until the end of the term.
Senator Luukas lives "09 opened
the discussion by urging fellow
Senators to increase their interaction
with students.
"We have failed to be open and
transparent to the student body,"
lives said. "We have not asked high
level administrators to come in and
give reports and question them, and

we have not set out a clear agenda of
our own with benchmarks that would
allow us and our voters to evaluate
whether we have succeeded in the
promises we have made."
lives discussed both the unique
role the Senate plays on campus and
the exclusive access it has to certain
resources.
"We are the one forum for stu
dents to exist and have a voice, and
we fail to provide for the discussion
for the student body," lives said. "We
also are the few students here who
really understand how a lot of the
administration works behind the
scenes."

ASSU President Hershey Avula
'08 also updated the Senate on
"Stanford Idol" saying the competi
tion has been narrowed down to 20
finalists. Performances will be broad
cast on the Internet following the
final round, and students will be able
to cast votes via text messages —
made possible by event sponsor
Sprint.
The Senate plans to release a
newsletter in the near future to
update the student body on its differ
ent projects and initiatives.
