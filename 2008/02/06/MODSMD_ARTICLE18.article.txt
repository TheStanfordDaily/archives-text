## New site for sports statistics Alums' project predicts rankings and outcomes 
### ROBERT TOEWS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Predicting the outcome of Big
Game just got easier. Two Stanford
alumni. Tom Federico '98. M.S. '99
and Mike Greenfield '00, have
established a highly sophisticated
Web site for ranking sports teams
and predicting the outcomes of
sporting events.
Teamßankings.com currently
provides player analysis, rankings
and predictions for seven different
professional and college sports, and
its popularity has steadily
increased. It received five million
page views in 2007 and now aver
ages between 3,000 and 4,000
unique hits each day.
Teanißankings takes into
account numerous variables,
including the number of games
played between specific teams,
game locations, wins, losses and
point spreads. The site applies sta
tistical analysis to produce its pre
dictions and rankings.
"When you have 341 [Division
1] college basketball teams, each
playing around 30 games per sea
son. that creates a set of thousands
of data points," Federico said.
"We've created statistical models
that take in all these data points
and create a system whereby the
odds for one team to beat another
can be effectively derived from the
numerical difference in their over
all ratings."
The site was launched by
Greenfield, a mathematical and
computational science major, in his
senior-year Suites room.
Greenfields motivation to launch
the site came from the lack of pre
cision he witnessed in other promi
nent ranking systems, including the
Ratings Percentage Index (RPI).
which determines teams and seed
ings for the NCAA tournament.
"It was sort of like alchemy," he
said. "(Other systems] randomly
put together a few numbers which
are generally correlated with suc
cessful teams and hoped they
would create an intelligent ranking
system. They didn't."
Teanißankings had an overall
record of 144-64 — close to 70 per
cent — in predicting the winners of
NFL games this season. The record
trumped Las Vegas spread predic
tors, the Yahoo! NFL Pick 'Em user
community, Yahoo! NFL experts
and ESPN NFL experts. The site
also ranked George Mason
University's men's basketball team
in the Top 25 before the Associated
Press, long before the team's his
toric run to the Final Four in the
2006 NCAA Tournament.
Federico, who was Greenfield's
Resident Assistant in Branncr,
became involved with the site in
2004. Federico now handles the
day-to-day operations of the site.
"Anybody can create a system to
rank teams," Federico said. "The
question is: what is the underlying
methodology? Is it 100 percent data
driven. or does it incorporate inher
ently biased human opinion? What
is the mathematical foundation of
the system? Was it designed bv

accomplished statisticians or not?"
Currently there are 10 other
contributors to the site, and
Federico anticipates that more will
become involved in the future.
"Our goal is to become the pre
eminent data services provider for
individual sports fans," Federico
explained. "Ideally, our data and
analysis will be required to com
pete effectively in any sports-based
market or contest, from fantasy to
pick 'ems to bracket pools to bet
ting. Our users will be able to cus
tomize our data and tools and
apply them to their specific needs."
