## Gambling, term limits approved

LOS ANGELES â€” Four California tribes won the right
Tuesday to add thousands of slot machines, as voters approved
a major expansion of Indian gambling that prompted one of
the state's costliest election battles.
The gambling measures cleared the way for the state's
largest casino-operating tribes to add 17,000 new slot
machines to a gambling industry that is already second only to
Nevada's.
With 44 percent of precincts reporting, each of the related
propositions had about 2.1 million votes, or 55.5 percent of the
vote, compared to about 1.7 million, or 44.5 percent against.
Voters were asked to affirm deals Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers struck last year with
four wealthy Southern California Indian tribes. In exchange
for the rights to add the slot machines, the tribes would share
hundreds of millions of dollars in casino winnings annually
with the cash-strapped state.
The deal would not have required voter approval, but a
coalition of two other gambling-rich tribes, a horse track
owner and a casino-workers' union gathered nearly 1 million
signatures to force the measures onto the ballot.
Critics opposed to the deal argued that it unfairly consoli
dated casino wealth in the hands of a few tribes while doing
little to help dozens of others that remain in poverty in the
state. They also worried that the deals would cut into race
track profits, increase competition and curb workers' rights.
The deals gained in polls in recent weeks as
Schwarzenegger began campaigning heavily for them.
Schwarzenegger also backed a measure that would shorten
from 14 years to 12 years the time most lawmakers could
serve. But it also would have grandfathered in about a third of
the state's sitting lawmakers, allowing them to serve more
than 14 vears.
