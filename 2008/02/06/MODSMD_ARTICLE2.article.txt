## Voters endure long lines to cast ballots

As the sun set over the palm trees on
Escondido Road, the line outside the Graduate
Community Center (GCC) stretched around the
corner and down the street. Hundreds of voters
stood outside, undeterred by delays that drove
the wait time to over two hours.
Super Tuesday's record turnout was on full
display at the only polling place for the three
precincts on campus. The GCC was over
whelmed by the strong turnout, and confusion
reigned as students, faculty, staff and local resi

their place of residence.
"It's frustrating," said A 1 Duncan, a second
year graduate student in classics, who had to
switch lines after initially waiting in the much
longer queue of the largely undergraduate hous
ing precinct. A Michigan resident, Duncan regis

Democratic delegates for scheduling its primary
Jan. 15, a violation of party rules. But his effort to
vote in California, he said, was far from easy.
"I appreciate their effort, but it seems to be a
little space," Duncan said of the polling center,
next door to the 750 pub. "Everyone knew it
would be a close race, well attended."
