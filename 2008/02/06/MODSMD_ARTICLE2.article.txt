## Voters endure long lines to cast ballots 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the sun set over the palm trees on
Escondido Road, the line outside the Graduate
Community Center (GCC) stretched around the
corner and down the street. Hundreds of voters
stood outside, undeterred by delays that drove
the wait time to over two hours.
Super Tuesday's record turnout was on full
display at the only polling place for the three
precincts on campus. The GCC was over
whelmed by the strong turnout, and confusion
reigned as students, faculty, staff and local resi
dents faced different waiting times based on
their place of residence.
"It's frustrating," said A 1 Duncan, a second
year graduate student in classics, who had to
switch lines after initially waiting in the much
longer queue of the largely undergraduate hous
ing precinct. A Michigan resident, Duncan regis
tered to vote in California after Michigan lost its
Democratic delegates for scheduling its primary
Jan. 15, a violation of party rules. But his effort to
vote in California, he said, was far from easy.
"I appreciate their effort, but it seems to be a
little space," Duncan said of the polling center,
next door to the 750 pub. "Everyone knew it
would be a close race, well attended."
Doug Karlson, a volunteer at the polling
place, spent much of the evening answering
questions about absentee ballots and shuffling
voters between the three precinct lines. A veter-

Hundreds of students stood in line outside the Graduate Community Center to vote. With only one polling place on campus, combined with record turnout in a hotly contested election, some waited for two or more hours.
an of five elections at the GCC,
Karlson said the turnout was bigger
than expected.
"We've done these mega-sites
before," Karlson said. "What is
unusual is the great turnout."
In other precincts throughout
California, polling places struggled
with an influx of independent voters
who showed up wishing to vote in
the presidential race, but instead
received independent ballots with
out presidential candidates from
either party.
That did not seem to be the case
at Stanford, where poll workers
worked to make sure voters who
had previously declined to state
party affiliation received
Democratic ballots if requested.
A volunteer from the Obama
campaign stood nearby the GCC,
holding a sign to let independent
voters know about their option to
request a Democratic ballot.
Independent voters have been an
important bloc for the Illinois sena
tor, and it was unclear whether the
ballot trouble impacted his results
in California.
Obama was the choice of a large
percentage of voters interviewed by
The Daily on Tuesday. The Illinois
senator received nearly 75 percent
of the Democratic vote in exit polls
of over 200 voters.
Despite the long lines and confu
sion. students were upbeat about
exercising their right to vote. On a
campus assailed for its apathy, stu
dents expressed enthusiasm for the
political mobilization brought by
the primary.
"Seeing the excitement of the
student body and the general cam
pus has gotten me excited," Alex
Laube '09 said from the back of the
line. "I'm happy to come out and do
my part."
"It's our responsibility," added
Kellen Klein '09. "I'm excited to see
campus come out and rally. It's
great to see that we have to wait in
line."
Samuel Franco '09 was less

enthused. Waiting toward the hack
of the queue, Franco said he had
made three previous attempts to
vote but had run out of time on each
occasion.
"It's gotten worse every time,
and my vote probably isn't going to
make a difference anyway," said
Franco, a New York resident who
registered in California because he
was interested in the ballot proposi
tions. "It's more of a symbolic
thing."
"I could have mailed something
in [from New York]," he added.
"Now I'm waiting in line again.
Hopefully the fourth time is the
charm."
Despite reports that the GCC
had run out of ballots, volunteers at
the polling place said the precinct
was well stocked. But according to
an email sent to the Students for
Barack Obama facebook group at
12:26 p.m. the GCC ran out of bal
lots and was providing paper sam
ple ballots.
Elsewhere in the state, the large
turnout strained efforts, and a judge
ordered polls in Alameda County to
remain open as late as 10 p.m. in
precincts that had run out of
Democratic ballots.
Master's student Alexis Pribula
was one of the last people to vote on
campus. He cast a provisional ballot
for Obama just before 9:20 p.m.,
more than an hour and a half after
arriving.
"It was totally worth it."the first
time voter said.
After spending over two hours
waiting and being shuffled between
lines. Tariq West '09 said the polling
process was "pretty unorganized."
"It's definitely inspiring to see
this big student turnout." he said,
adding that the wait was "a small
inconvenience."
West wasn't completely satisfied,
however.
"I'm glad I had the opportunity
to vote," he said, "but they didn't
even give me a sticker."
