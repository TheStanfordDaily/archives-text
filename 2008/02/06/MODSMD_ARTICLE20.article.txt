## Community funding measure fails to pass 
### Michelle Locke THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BERKELEY â€” A plan to secure
more state funding for community
colleges failed at the polls Tuesday.
Proposition 92 would have low
ered community college fees and
changed the way state funding is
allocated to the huge system - 2.5
million students on 109 campuses.
Supporters, including the
California Federation of Teachers
and the California Labor
Federation, said Proposition 92
would protect community colleges
and create a smarter, higher-earn
ing work force.
Critics said the initiative would
have siphoned money away from
other areas because it lacked a new
source of revenue, a concern con
sidering the state's looming multi
billion-dollar deficit. It was strong
ly opposed by the California
Teachers Association, as well as the
University of California and
California State University sys
tems.
With 16 percent of precincts
reporting in early returns, 63 per
cent of voters opposed Proposition
92 and 37 percent supported it.
Theresa Wheeler, spokeswoman

for the No on 92 side, said the cam
paign was pleased that voters
joined "teachers, business, firefight
ers, taxpayers, seniors and others in
opposing flawed Proposition 92."
The next step is "to work
together with all of public educa
tion to ensure that all our schools
are properly funded and California
students get the education they
deserve," she said.
At the Yes on 92 campaign, offi
cials said that even without a win,
the process has drawn attention to
the funding woes of community
colleges.
"From our perspective, the story
has now been told about the mis
treatment and underfunding of
community colleges," said Scott
Lay, head of the Community
College League of California, a
nonprofit association of the state's
72 community college districts.
Critics of California's budget
process say part of the problem is
caused by programs that have
built-in spending increases regard
less of the state of the economy.
Many of those programs stem from
voter-approved initiatives that lock
in automatic spending but do not
come with identified sources of
funding.
