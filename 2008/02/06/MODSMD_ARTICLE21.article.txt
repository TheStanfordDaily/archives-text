## CARD SHOOT PAST BRONCOS Hones' five three-pointers lead the way 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team roared to life from long range last
night, beating Santa Clara on the road %-74,
behind a season-high 13 three-pointers.
Guards J.J. Hones and Candice Wiggins
led the Cardinal (20-3, 9-2 Pac-10) with 20
points apiece. Hones sank five three-point
shots while Wiggins had three.
Forwards Kayla Pedersen (15 points) and
Jillian Harmon (11 points) also hit double
digits for the Cardinal, which pushed its win
ning streak to eight games. Pedersen led
Stanford with eight rebounds.
The Broncos (16-6, 5-2 West Coast Con
ference) played Stanford tight for the open
ing four minutes, during which an unusually
lax Cardinal defense allowed Santa Clara to
keep up and tie the score at 10-10.
But the Cardinal immediately turned up
the heat in response. Harmon and Hones
scored off steals and Wiggins hit a three at
the beginning of a 20-9 run that gave Stan
ford the lead for good. With more than six
minutes to go in the first half, a long-range
bomb from Hones put Stanford up by 20.
The Cardinal shot 20-for-29 (69 percent)
in the first half and 62.1 percent for the game.
