## CARD SHOOT PAST BRONCOS Hones' five three-pointers lead the way 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team roared to life from long range last
night, beating Santa Clara on the road %-74,
behind a season-high 13 three-pointers.
Guards J.J. Hones and Candice Wiggins
led the Cardinal (20-3, 9-2 Pac-10) with 20
points apiece. Hones sank five three-point
shots while Wiggins had three.
Forwards Kayla Pedersen (15 points) and
Jillian Harmon (11 points) also hit double
digits for the Cardinal, which pushed its win
ning streak to eight games. Pedersen led
Stanford with eight rebounds.
The Broncos (16-6, 5-2 West Coast Con
ference) played Stanford tight for the open
ing four minutes, during which an unusually
lax Cardinal defense allowed Santa Clara to
keep up and tie the score at 10-10.
But the Cardinal immediately turned up
the heat in response. Harmon and Hones
scored off steals and Wiggins hit a three at
the beginning of a 20-9 run that gave Stan
ford the lead for good. With more than six
minutes to go in the first half, a long-range
bomb from Hones put Stanford up by 20.
The Cardinal shot 20-for-29 (69 percent)
in the first half and 62.1 percent for the game.

ALEX OPPENHEIMER/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen had 15 points and 8 rebounds in the Cardinal's
96-74 thrashing of Santa Clara last night. With the victory, Stanford won its eighth
straight game and is now 20-3 on the year.
Santa Clara barely pulled within
20 points for the rest of the game,
though it was more thanks to Stan
ford's lights-out shooting than to
the Cardinal's effort on defense.
While allowing the Broncos to run
rampant on offense. Stanford chal
lenged Santa Clara at the other end
by sending Pedersen to the outside
to knock down a pair of rare three
pointers.
The Cardinal allowed the most
points on defense that it has all sea
son. and the Broncos' 46.2 percent
field goal shooting was 10 points
higher than Stanford's average field
goal defense rate.
Sophomore center Jayne Appel
did not turn in her usual eye-popping
numbers on the stat sheet, scoring 7
points and grabbing 4 rebounds. But
the sophomore did hit every shot she
took in 21 minutes on the floor: three
from the field and one from the foul
stripe on an and-one play with 7:49
to go in the first half.
Stanford returns to the court this
weekend, when the team heads
north to take on Oregon on Thurs
day and Oregon State on Saturday.
Stanford boasts two Oregon natives
— Harmon and Hones — on its ros
ter.
