# Stars align for Giants

### 
Most of the time, being a sports fan is
about the foreseeable. Quite frankly,
the majority of sporting events we
watch have favorites, and usually those fa
vorites win. Oh, sometimes they don't, and we
armchair prognosticators usually respond with
a self-inflicted slap to the forehead and a cry of
"how did I not see that coming?"
Usually, then, when we are surprised by a
game's outcome, it's because we didn't see
some aspect that gave the underdog the edge.
Or maybe it was just random chance — an un
characteristically bad play from a normally
consistent player or a strangely stellar game
from a traditional nobody. Things like that
catch us off guard because we're creatures of
habit. and we expect sports to be as well. We ex
pect the player who hit .250 during the regular
season to do the same in the World Series, but
that doesn't mean he couldn't turn in an MVP
performance for seven games.
But sometimes, an upset goes so beautifully
according to plan, it's not that you didn't see it
coming, it's just that you didn't think you'd be
so lucky to see it.That's what Super Bowl XLII
was for me, and I'm guessing millions of other
Americans who watched the biggest game of
the year expecting the expected — a Patriots
win as the Giants drowned in a sea of points
through the air, courtesy of Tom Brady and the
unmatched assembly of weapons at his dispos
al.
But if you are a fan of football, you probably
did think before the game that maybe there
was a chance. Maybe, because the Giants pass
rush was just that good and not even the great
Tom Brady throws that well from his back. On
the other end of the equation, there was little
reason to believe it could happen, as the New
England offensive line had given its signal
caller plenty of time all season long.
But you just had to think... maybe. Maybe, if
the Giants defense could get through that im
penetrable wall that had surrounded New Eng
land's golden boy all season and hassle him,the
ball might never get to some of those danger
ous men out wide. Maybe Randy Moss would
even become frustrated and revert to his
Raider ways as a non-factor. You didn't think it
was likely, but you probably saw the chance for
