# Stars align for Giants
## 
### 
Most of the time, being a sports fan is
about the foreseeable. Quite frankly,
the majority of sporting events we
watch have favorites, and usually those fa
vorites win. Oh, sometimes they don't, and we
armchair prognosticators usually respond with
a self-inflicted slap to the forehead and a cry of
"how did I not see that coming?"
Usually, then, when we are surprised by a
game's outcome, it's because we didn't see
some aspect that gave the underdog the edge.
Or maybe it was just random chance — an un
characteristically bad play from a normally
consistent player or a strangely stellar game
from a traditional nobody. Things like that
catch us off guard because we're creatures of
habit. and we expect sports to be as well. We ex
pect the player who hit .250 during the regular
season to do the same in the World Series, but
that doesn't mean he couldn't turn in an MVP
performance for seven games.
But sometimes, an upset goes so beautifully
according to plan, it's not that you didn't see it
coming, it's just that you didn't think you'd be
so lucky to see it.That's what Super Bowl XLII
was for me, and I'm guessing millions of other
Americans who watched the biggest game of
the year expecting the expected — a Patriots
win as the Giants drowned in a sea of points
through the air, courtesy of Tom Brady and the
unmatched assembly of weapons at his dispos
al.
But if you are a fan of football, you probably
did think before the game that maybe there
was a chance. Maybe, because the Giants pass
rush was just that good and not even the great
Tom Brady throws that well from his back. On
the other end of the equation, there was little
reason to believe it could happen, as the New
England offensive line had given its signal
caller plenty of time all season long.
But you just had to think... maybe. Maybe, if
the Giants defense could get through that im
penetrable wall that had surrounded New Eng
land's golden boy all season and hassle him,the
ball might never get to some of those danger
ous men out wide. Maybe Randy Moss would
even become frustrated and revert to his
Raider ways as a non-factor. You didn't think it
was likely, but you probably saw the chance for


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
exactly the kind of low scoring slugfest
we actually did see.
So, if you're like me, it wasn't so
much that what you saw on the field
on Sunday surprised you. but that it
was what you'd hoped for and reject
ed out of hand. The Patriots were just
too good, and great teams don't lose
the Super Bowl — that's the general
rule which has only been proven
wrong a handful of times. That's why
the Steelers dynasty in the '70s was
perfect; as was the 49ers dynasty in the
'80s and '90s and the Packers in the
'60s.Typically, when great, established
teams make it to the championship
game, they just don't lose.

And yet, this one did. Of course,
as an amateur know-it-all, it's my
duty to tell you at this point (since it's
no longer blasphemous to criticize
the "greatest team ever") that the
Pats were composed of just a truly
great offense and pretty good de
fense all season long and that most of
history's truly amazing teams were
more balanced than that. There
were, perhaps, other warning signs,
but ultimately the Giants proved to
have the perfect counterparts to take
on the Pats.
In the NFL game of rock-paper
scissors, the Pats were the ultimate
pair of shears. Strong enough to over
whelm any arguments you could put
down on paper that might suggest
they'd lose, but occasionally they'd
run into the NFL's version of rock and
have trouble. They did against the
Jaguars stalwart front seven, but were

ultimately too quick out wide.The Gi
ants, another old-school, physical,
bedrock team of the league, answered
that quickness out wide with a devas
tating pass rush off the edge and
blitzes up the middle. And that was
enough.
So when the Giants toppled the
Patriots on Sunday, it was a game that
instantly entered the Pantheon of
great sporting moments any of us will
see in our lifetimes. Because it proved
that, even if all the numbers and odds
are against you. sometimes the stars
can align the way you thought they
just might.
And as for a world without anoth
er Boston championship this year?
It's a beautiful thing.
