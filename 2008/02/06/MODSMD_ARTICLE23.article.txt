" Ihe great thing about this trip is the strong field." said head coach
Conrad Ray. "This will be a good test for us to get back into the season.

course as it presents itself."

Cirube and Kim led the team in individual competition with four top-25
finishes for the fall.
The Cardinal scored a second place trophy in its last performance of
2007 at the CordeValle Collegiate tournament in November. Kim led
the team throughout the tournament, pulling away in the third round
with a three-under 69 to tie for top honors â€” it was his first collegiate

"We feel good going into the tournament," Ray said. "The guys like
competing and we had some good qualifiers to get here. We had a good
break and are anxious to get the season started again."
