# Men's tennis hosts Warriors
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
After tour tough matches to open
the season, the Stanford men's tennis
team returns to the court today when
it hosts the University of Hawaii at
theTaube Family Tennis Center. TTne
Cardinal faced one of the toughest
opening schedules in the country
when it played three teams ranked in
the nation's top-10 in the past two
weeks. Hut that stretch is over now.
and the Card faces a less daunting
opponent in the Warriors.
Over Thanksgiving break. Stan
ford traveled to Hawaii to play the
Warriors in a preseason match. The
Cardinal won easily that day. 5-1;
however. Hawaii only had five eligi
ble players and therefore forfeited at
No. 6 singles and No. 3 doubles. Un
fortunately for Stanford. Hawaii is
not the same team as the Cardinal
saw three months ago.
"ITiey only had five guys the last
time," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "They added a really
good player and their top three guys
are all solid. They are a formidable
team. It's going to be a good match."
Hawaii features a very good
freshman in Dennis Lajola, who just
joined the team and has only played
two matches. He has won both, in

eluding a straight sets victory over
No. 68 Sam Chang of Florida State.
The Warriors are led by sopho
more Andreas Weber, ranked 25th in
the nation. Weber is 11-3 on the sea
son and 4-1 in dual matches. He beat
junior Matt Bruch this year in three
sets during the preseason match,
scoring Hawaii's only point in the
match. Perhaps the toughest chal
lenge for Stanford will be junior
Sascha Heinemann, who leads the
team with a 16-5 record this season
and a 5-0 record in dual matches.
Heinemann and Weber also team up
in doubles.
Hawaii is 1-4 on the season and
currently in the middle of a four
game road trip in Northern Califor
nia. They dropped a match to San
Francisco yesterday. 4-3. After Stan
ford. they will face No. 70 Fresno
State and Oregon: both matches will
be played at Fresno State.
Stanford feels confident that
today will mark its first win of the
season. After playing some of the
toughest opponents in the nation, the
players believe the experience will
help them from here on out.
"We didn't come out with the
wins, but we are hitting the ball well
and we are getting better every day,"
said junior Blake Muller. "We aren't
going to underestimate our oppo-
