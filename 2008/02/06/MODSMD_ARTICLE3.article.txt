## Democratic race more up in the air McCain solidifies front runner status in GOP, Huckabee exceeds expectations 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.) were the winners of California's presidential primary
TUesday night, but strong performances by former Arkansas
Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) else
where in the nation ensured that the nomination contests for
each party would continue past Super TUesday
McCain's winning performances in larger states like
California and New York appeared to give him a commanding
lead in the race for Republican delegates, while a resurgent
performance from Huckabee in the South dealt what could be
a knockout punch to the candidacy of former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney.
On the Democratic side, Clinton took such populous states
as California. New York and Arizona. Obama, however, won
more states overall, and the proportional allocation of dele
gates in many Democratic contests meant the race for the nom
ination is far from over.
There were few surprises TUesday night, and neither side
could claim a decisive win in the 22-statc contest dubbed by
some a "national primary."
"Everything seems like it's gone according to expectations,"

New York Senator Hillary Clinton pointed to supporters at a rally Tuesday night in New York. The Democrat won
New York and California, along with six other states, putting her in a position to earn more delegates than Obama.
