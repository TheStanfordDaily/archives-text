## Democratic race more up in the air McCain solidifies front runner status in GOP, Huckabee exceeds expectations 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.) were the winners of California's presidential primary
TUesday night, but strong performances by former Arkansas
Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) else
where in the nation ensured that the nomination contests for
each party would continue past Super TUesday
McCain's winning performances in larger states like
California and New York appeared to give him a commanding
lead in the race for Republican delegates, while a resurgent
performance from Huckabee in the South dealt what could be
a knockout punch to the candidacy of former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney.
On the Democratic side, Clinton took such populous states
as California. New York and Arizona. Obama, however, won
more states overall, and the proportional allocation of dele
gates in many Democratic contests meant the race for the nom
ination is far from over.
There were few surprises TUesday night, and neither side
could claim a decisive win in the 22-statc contest dubbed by
some a "national primary."
"Everything seems like it's gone according to expectations,"


The Associated Press
New York Senator Hillary Clinton pointed to supporters at a rally Tuesday night in New York. The Democrat won
New York and California, along with six other states, putting her in a position to earn more delegates than Obama.
Political Science Prof. Morris Fiorina
said.
McCain claimed nine states and
423 delegates in Tuesday night's
polls, giving him 525 overall to
Romney's 223 and Huckabce's 145.
ITie Arizona senator, whose cam
paign was widely considered all but
finished last summer, was ready to
proclaim himself the front-runner.
"We've won some of the biggest
states in the country." McCain said
at a rally in Phoenix, before adding.
"I don't really mind it one bit."
McCain's recent surge began
with victories in the New 1 Hampshire
and South Carolina primaries last
month. He also received endorse
ments from California Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and former New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, after
Giuliani dropped out of the
Republican race.
While Romney and Huckabee
said Tuesday night that they would
continue in the race, McCain's
momentum appeared to have him
closing in on the nomination.
"McCain's turnaround is due
mainly to the weakness of the oppo
sition," Communication and
Political Science Prof. Shanto
Iyengar wrote in an email to The
Daily on Riesday night. "The early
polling showed Giuliani doing well
— a reflection of the mayor's high
name recognition. As the campaign
progressed. Republicans began to
coalesce around McCain."
Obama took 13 states to
Clinton's eight, but trailed by about
100 delegates as of press time. As of
1:00 a.m. PST, New Mexico had not
yet been called and the overall dele
gate counts were not available. Just
less than 1.200 delegates are needed

to win the Republican nomination,
while 2,025 are required for the
Democrats'.
"I'd have to say that the recent
polling seems to have underestimat
ed Sen. Clinton's strength, especially
among middle-aged and older
women." Iyengar said. "Nonetheless.
I'd give Obama full marks for mak
ing the race so competitive."
Both Democratic candidates
spun the results as favoring their
campaigns.
"I look forward to continuing our
campaign and our debate about how
to leave this country better off for
the next generation." Clinton said at
a rally in New York.
Obama addressed his supporters
from Chicago, referencing the
theme of change that has been cen
tral to his campaign.
"Our time has come," he said.
"Our movement is real. And change
is coming to America."
The next contests will be held
Saturday in Kansas, Louisiana and
Washington for Republicans. The
Democrats will compete in
Nebraska, the Virgin Islands,
Louisiana and Washington on
Saturday, as well as Maine on
Sunday. Both parties will compete
next Tuesday in the Beltway primar
ies in Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.
Iyengar, who is teaching a class
this quarter on presidential cam
paigns, said a drawn-out primary
process favors Obama.
"The more people see the two
candidates up close and in person,
the more likely they are to break for
Obama," he wrote. "The Dem race is
likely to go on right up to
Pennsylvania in April."
