# Clinton wins California
## Exit poll shows Obama favored on campus 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So much for Stanford being a politically apa
thetic campus.
While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) were the clear
winners in the California primaries Tuesday
Democratic voters on campus overwhelmingly
chose Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as their
choice for the party's nominee, while Stanford
Republicans threw the majority of their support
behind Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.).
In exit polls conducted by The Daily through
out the day yesterday, Obama was the clear win
ner among Stanford voters who participated in
the Democratic primary.
The Illinois senator received support from
nearly 75 percent of the 159 Democratic voters
polled at the only on-campus polling location,
the Graduate Community Center. Clinton.
Obama's sole challenger, placed a distant sec
ond with about 23 percent support among
Stanford voters.
The results were no surprise to Debashish
Bakshi '08, the Stanford chapter coordinator of
Students for Barack Obama, who said turnout
was so high at the on-campus polling place yes
terday that election monitors ran out of official
Democratic ballots and had to resort to giving
voters photocopies of sample ballots.
"The real difference [between Clinton and
Obama) is something about where we want to go
as a country." Bakshi said. "Young people don't
want to be locked for the rest of their lives into a
stale and outdated political system. Young peo
ple want something new, they want something
better."
"If Clinton is president, things will be better

than they are now, but we will have no direc
tion." he added. "If Obama is president, we will
have a clear and well-articulated direction."
The Republican race was largely overshad
owed by the hotly contested Democratic battle,
as Republicans made up only 22 percent of vot
ers in The Daily's exit polls. On the Republican
side, Paul led his rivals with 46 percent of the 44
Stanford GOP voters polled. McCain was sec
ond with 21 percent, while Mitt Romney placed
third with 18 percent and Mike Huckabee fin
ished fourth with 16 percent.
Though Obama received a majority of sup
port among both genders and every age and eth
nic group (except Latinos) in TTie Daily's exit
polls, he scored particularly well among men,
who supported him by a nearly nine-to-one
margin, and among African- and Asian-
Americans, who both threw more than 90 per
cent of their support behind the Illinois senator.
While women nationwide tended to support
Clinton, the story was different at Stanford on
Tuesday, where 60 percent of women voters cast
their ballots for Obama; Clinton was the choice
of 36 percent of women, according to The
Daily's exit polls. In addition, the Illinois sena
tor drew the support of 59 percent of white vot
ers, while Clinton won 27 percent. In fact.
Latinos were the only group that Clinton won in
The Daily's exit polls; she drew 57 percent of
Latino voters in comparison to Obama's 43 per
cent.
