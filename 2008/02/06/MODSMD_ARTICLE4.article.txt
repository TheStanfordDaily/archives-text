# Clinton wins California
## Exit poll shows Obama favored on campus 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So much for Stanford being a politically apa
thetic campus.
While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) were the clear
winners in the California primaries Tuesday
Democratic voters on campus overwhelmingly
chose Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as their
choice for the party's nominee, while Stanford
Republicans threw the majority of their support
behind Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.).
In exit polls conducted by The Daily through
out the day yesterday, Obama was the clear win
ner among Stanford voters who participated in
the Democratic primary.
The Illinois senator received support from
nearly 75 percent of the 159 Democratic voters
polled at the only on-campus polling location,
the Graduate Community Center. Clinton.
Obama's sole challenger, placed a distant sec
ond with about 23 percent support among
Stanford voters.
The results were no surprise to Debashish
Bakshi '08, the Stanford chapter coordinator of
Students for Barack Obama, who said turnout
was so high at the on-campus polling place yes
terday that election monitors ran out of official
Democratic ballots and had to resort to giving
voters photocopies of sample ballots.
"The real difference [between Clinton and
Obama) is something about where we want to go
as a country." Bakshi said. "Young people don't
want to be locked for the rest of their lives into a
stale and outdated political system. Young peo
ple want something new, they want something
better."
"If Clinton is president, things will be better

than they are now, but we will have no direc
tion." he added. "If Obama is president, we will
have a clear and well-articulated direction."
The Republican race was largely overshad
owed by the hotly contested Democratic battle,
as Republicans made up only 22 percent of vot
ers in The Daily's exit polls. On the Republican
side, Paul led his rivals with 46 percent of the 44
Stanford GOP voters polled. McCain was sec
ond with 21 percent, while Mitt Romney placed
third with 18 percent and Mike Huckabee fin
ished fourth with 16 percent.
Though Obama received a majority of sup
port among both genders and every age and eth
nic group (except Latinos) in TTie Daily's exit
polls, he scored particularly well among men,
who supported him by a nearly nine-to-one
margin, and among African- and Asian-
Americans, who both threw more than 90 per
cent of their support behind the Illinois senator.
While women nationwide tended to support
Clinton, the story was different at Stanford on
Tuesday, where 60 percent of women voters cast
their ballots for Obama; Clinton was the choice
of 36 percent of women, according to The
Daily's exit polls. In addition, the Illinois sena
tor drew the support of 59 percent of white vot
ers, while Clinton won 27 percent. In fact.
Latinos were the only group that Clinton won in
The Daily's exit polls; she drew 57 percent of
Latino voters in comparison to Obama's 43 per
cent.
The Clinton Camp
Despite the tremendous support for Obama
on campus, it was Clinton who won the Golden
State — the biggest prize of Super Tuesday —

by a comfortable margin.
Mishan Araujo "OS. the Northern
California chair of Women for
Miliary — a branch of Clinton's
national presidential campaign
dismissed Obama's big win on cam
pus as a predictable outcome and
pointed to policy differences, rather
than character distinctions, as the
important talking points between
the two candidates.
"(Obama's win on campus] does
n't worry me because it's expected,"
Araujo said. "It's easy to cling to
Obama's messages and the slogans
lie uses, but I think when you look
beyond all that, when you look to
[Hillary's] policies and his policies,
particularly on the economy and
healthcare, you realize that it takes
more than hope to make change."
Araujo cited Clinton's wins in
key Northeastern states like New
Jersey as evidence of her nation
wide appeal. Clinton also won last
night in Arizona. Arkansas,
Massachusetts, ()klahoma.
Tennessee and New York, her
home state.
The Obama Camp
While Obama may have earned
the support of nearly three-quar
ters of Stanford Democratic voters
in The Daily survey, he failed to win
California despite recent polls indi
cating that he had closed the gap in
the Golden State.
Bakshi offered a positive out
look on the California returns,
which at press time indicated about
a 14-point lead for Clinton.
"Winning California would've
been more symbolic for Obama,"
he said, "but given the delegate
breakdown, we're most likely going
to earn a split."
Every Democratic primary or
caucus yesterday afforded the can
didates proportional delegates,
making it hard for either Clinton or
Obama to pull significantly ahead.
Such a system means that the
Democratic candidates will likely
earn similar numbers of delegates
in all the states that were close yes
terday. The Republicans, by con
trast, competed in both proportion
al contests and winner-take-all
races.
Bakshi downplayed Clinton's
wins in California and the populous
Northeastern states as victories
that were expected for months but
ended up being much closer than
expected.
"For us to be in a situation
where it's an achievement for
Hillary to win New York, New
Jersey and California is unbeliev
able," he said. "Today was supposed
to be the end. That's completely
changed. I'll is race has become
incredibly competitive."
Obama actually claimed more
states than his rival last night. The
Illinois senator won his home state,
as well as Alabama, Alaska.
Colorado. Connecticut, Delaware,
Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, North Dakota and Utah,
giving him a total of 13 states won
to Clinton's eight victories on
Super Tuesday. The winner in New
Mexico was still unclear late into

TUesday night.
The Road Ahead
While the candidates' support
ers may disagree on the importance
of the California returns and on the
implications of Super Tuesday as a
whole, they all agree that the fight
for the nomination will be a pro
tracted one that could last well into
April and even until the
Democratic National Convention
in Denver in August.

"It's going to be a
hard race and a
longer race than
tonight."

"It's going to be a hard race and
a longer race than tonight," Araujo
said. "It is exciting that we have two
candidates that are so appealing to
so many Democrats, hut 1 think the
kinds of states that Hillary won
tonight, the kinds of core
Democratic states like New York
and California, mean a lot going
forward."
Meanwhile, Bakshi said the
Obama campaign is in a great posi
tion to capture the nomination
after coming out of Super Tuesday
with a majority of states won.
"1 feel that we're in a position to
go into the post-Super Tuesday
phases with an advantage," he said.
"[Obama'sj campaign has always
been better when there've been
fewer states to deal with at a time
because that's where Obama
shines."
"Our fundraising advantage is
massive," Bakshi added. "We're
well funded and we have a fantastic
operation on the ground in the
remaining states. We're ready to
move into the stage where we have
a comparative advantage over the
Clinton campaign."
Stanford Democrats Co-
President Beth D'Aunno '09
offered her perspective on the
tightening race, noting that she saw
both positives and negatives.
"It is good that every state will
have a voice in this election,"
D'Aunno said. "Each candidate in
the race will have been given a fair
shot at this."
"I do think [the protracted elec
tion! vv '" make it harder for us to
unite behind a candidate to project a
strong front toward whomever we go
up again on the Republican side," she
added. "1 think we will fully support
either candidate in the end."

So much for Stanford being a politically apa
thetic campus.
While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) were the clear
winners in the California primaries Tuesday
Democratic voters on campus overwhelmingly
chose Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as their
choice for the party's nominee, while Stanford
Republicans threw the majority of their support
behind Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.).
In exit polls conducted by The Daily through
out the day yesterday, Obama was the clear win
ner among Stanford voters who participated in
the Democratic primary.
The Illinois senator received support from
nearly 75 percent of the 159 Democratic voters
polled at the only on-campus polling location,
the Graduate Community Center. Clinton.
Obama's sole challenger, placed a distant sec
ond with about 23 percent support among
Stanford voters.
The results were no surprise to Debashish
Bakshi '08, the Stanford chapter coordinator of
Students for Barack Obama, who said turnout
was so high at the on-campus polling place yes
terday that election monitors ran out of official
Democratic ballots and had to resort to giving
voters photocopies of sample ballots.
"The real difference [between Clinton and
Obama) is something about where we want to go
as a country." Bakshi said. "Young people don't
want to be locked for the rest of their lives into a
stale and outdated political system. Young peo
ple want something new, they want something
better."
"If Clinton is president, things will be better

than they are now, but we will have no direc
tion." he added. "If Obama is president, we will
have a clear and well-articulated direction."
The Republican race was largely overshad
owed by the hotly contested Democratic battle,
as Republicans made up only 22 percent of vot
ers in The Daily's exit polls. On the Republican
side, Paul led his rivals with 46 percent of the 44
Stanford GOP voters polled. McCain was sec
ond with 21 percent, while Mitt Romney placed
third with 18 percent and Mike Huckabee fin
ished fourth with 16 percent.
Though Obama received a majority of sup
port among both genders and every age and eth
nic group (except Latinos) in TTie Daily's exit
polls, he scored particularly well among men,
who supported him by a nearly nine-to-one
margin, and among African- and Asian-
Americans, who both threw more than 90 per
cent of their support behind the Illinois senator.
While women nationwide tended to support
Clinton, the story was different at Stanford on
Tuesday, where 60 percent of women voters cast
their ballots for Obama; Clinton was the choice
of 36 percent of women, according to The
Daily's exit polls. In addition, the Illinois sena
tor drew the support of 59 percent of white vot
ers, while Clinton won 27 percent. In fact.
Latinos were the only group that Clinton won in
The Daily's exit polls; she drew 57 percent of
Latino voters in comparison to Obama's 43 per
cent.
The Clinton Camp
Despite the tremendous support for Obama
on campus, it was Clinton who won the Golden
State — the biggest prize of Super Tuesday —

by a comfortable margin.
Mishan Araujo "OS. the Northern
California chair of Women for
Miliary — a branch of Clinton's
national presidential campaign
dismissed Obama's big win on cam
pus as a predictable outcome and
pointed to policy differences, rather
than character distinctions, as the
important talking points between
the two candidates.
"(Obama's win on campus] does
n't worry me because it's expected,"
Araujo said. "It's easy to cling to
Obama's messages and the slogans
lie uses, but I think when you look
beyond all that, when you look to
[Hillary's] policies and his policies,
particularly on the economy and
healthcare, you realize that it takes
more than hope to make change."
Araujo cited Clinton's wins in
key Northeastern states like New
Jersey as evidence of her nation
wide appeal. Clinton also won last
night in Arizona. Arkansas,
Massachusetts, ()klahoma.
Tennessee and New York, her
home state.
The Obama Camp
While Obama may have earned
the support of nearly three-quar
ters of Stanford Democratic voters
in The Daily survey, he failed to win
California despite recent polls indi
cating that he had closed the gap in
the Golden State.
Bakshi offered a positive out
look on the California returns,
which at press time indicated about
a 14-point lead for Clinton.
"Winning California would've
been more symbolic for Obama,"
he said, "but given the delegate
breakdown, we're most likely going
to earn a split."
Every Democratic primary or
caucus yesterday afforded the can
didates proportional delegates,
making it hard for either Clinton or
Obama to pull significantly ahead.
Such a system means that the
Democratic candidates will likely
earn similar numbers of delegates
in all the states that were close yes
terday. The Republicans, by con
trast, competed in both proportion
al contests and winner-take-all
races.
Bakshi downplayed Clinton's
wins in California and the populous
Northeastern states as victories
that were expected for months but
ended up being much closer than
expected.
"For us to be in a situation
where it's an achievement for
Hillary to win New York, New
Jersey and California is unbeliev
able," he said. "Today was supposed
to be the end. That's completely
changed. I'll is race has become
incredibly competitive."
Obama actually claimed more
states than his rival last night. The
Illinois senator won his home state,
as well as Alabama, Alaska.
Colorado. Connecticut, Delaware,
Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, North Dakota and Utah,
giving him a total of 13 states won
to Clinton's eight victories on
Super Tuesday. The winner in New
Mexico was still unclear late into

TUesday night.
The Road Ahead
While the candidates' support
ers may disagree on the importance
of the California returns and on the
implications of Super Tuesday as a
whole, they all agree that the fight
for the nomination will be a pro
tracted one that could last well into
April and even until the
Democratic National Convention
in Denver in August.

"It's going to be a
hard race and a
longer race than
tonight."

Organizer of Women for

"It's going to be a hard race and
a longer race than tonight," Araujo
said. "It is exciting that we have two
candidates that are so appealing to
so many Democrats, hut 1 think the
kinds of states that Hillary won
tonight, the kinds of core
Democratic states like New York
and California, mean a lot going
forward."
