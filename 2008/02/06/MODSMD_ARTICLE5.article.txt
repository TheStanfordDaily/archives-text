# STUDENT LIFE
## Results of vote watched with rapt attention 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a great excuse to have a party on a
TUesday night during midterms.
In lounges across campus, hundreds of (some
times-boozed) students watched returns pour in
through the evening.
More people watched commentators pontificate
about the neck-and-neck horse race between
Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D
-III.) than came to vSuper Howl parties in the same
locations on Sunday.
ITie intensity of interest was a testament to how
passionate many have become about the contest
and a reminder of the importance California
assumed as the crown jewel in Tuesday's primaries.
"'lliis is the first time I've ever cared about
Super Hiesday," said Katie Wong '09. an Obama
supporter who watched returns at the Axe & Palm
in Old Union. "I've been really excited the whole
day."
Fraternities, row houses and student political
groups sponsored informal gatherings.
"Super lUesday is a huge event." said Peter
Griffin '08. the president of Kappa Alpha Psi. "A lot
of students don't have cable so we decided to pro-
vide that."
The fraternity sponsored a party
that brought 30 people to the Black
Community Service Center, which
was decked out with red. white and
blue balloons.
Most of the three dozen people in
Slavianskii Dom. which had a keg for
the festivities, booed when CNN con
tinued to air John McCain's speech as
Obama took the stage in a muted
video feed on the screen.
The girl with the remote changed
the channel to CBS. then featuring
Obama, prompting cheers.
Tim Ford '10, a Mitt Romney sup
porter intently watching results
online, colored in a map for the
Republican and Democratic field
each time a candidate won a state. It's
been a tradition of his since the 2000
election.
Thirty-five people in the Bob
lounge ate a sheet cake decorated
with the image of the American flag.
As the winner of each state was called,
a student taped a cutout of the state
onto a poster for the candidate.
Knight Fellows, journalism stu
dents and professors met at 5 p.m. in a
McClatchy Hall lounge to watch
results. Because of the time difference,
results from states on the East Coast
streamed in for several hours before
California's polls closed.
Nipun Kant '10, sitting with about
a dozen Toyon residents in the dorm's
cavernous lounge, listened to CNN
playing in the background while scan
ning the same network's Web site.
"Sometimes [on TV| they're talk
ing about things I'm not that interest
ed in," he said. "I want to find out
about specific results that they're not
talking about."

More than 30 students watched election returns in Row house Bob at a party sponsored by alumni of Stanford in
Washington. Super Tuesday provided a handy excuse to host a party for several groups, especially in a year of intense
student activism and a fiercely competitive election.
