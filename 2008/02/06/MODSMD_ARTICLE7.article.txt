"You don't
have to read
Vogue or be
a size 00 to
have style."
— Leia Lorica '09

More often than not, a quick glance around
campus reveals throngs of students, each clad
in the same school sweatshirt and faded
jeans. Yet something is changing here at Stan
ford: even in the doldrums of winter quarter,
flashes of fashion appear in the crowds. Flats replace flip flops;
hoodies are traded in for sleek blazers and tailored peacoats.
Something is changing because — perhaps for the first time
— someone is watching.
Yes, Leia Lorica '09 and Taylor Jackson TO are trying to re
vive fashion, one blog entry at a time.
On Monday night. 1 sat down with Lorica of Stanford Style
and Jackson of thechicnerd to chat about style, fashion blogs,
and the role of each at Stanford. For a 10 p.m. meeting — a
time at which students normally settle for sweats — both
looked perfectly put-together: Lorica was business casual in
purple wedges and a lace-trimmed skirt, while Jackson
donned an empire-waisted wool jacket and skinny jeans
tucked into suede boots.
"1 started thechicnerd blog back in D C.," Taylor told me.
"So when I came to campus I was planning on starting anoth
er one for Stanford. I wanted to name it Stanford Style: It's
Not an Oxymoron, but then I found out the name was already
taken."
Jackson's blog is scattered with candids of trendy Stanford
ites strutting their stuff in the Bookstore, Building 200. and
her favorite haunting ground — watch out. fashion-phobes
— the Axe and Palm.
Just last week, Jackson blogged on the costumes in Black
stage's production of the Wiz.
"The scarecrow had all the appropriate tears and patches,
uneven pant legs and straw in his hood." Jackson wrote on her
blog. "Disheveled worked well — not to mention his glow in
the dark kicks."
Inspired by her coursework at Stanford. Jackson,a product
design major, often includes color palettes — collections of
hues that compliment each other.
"After taking Art 60 I started to notice how much color
matters," said Jackson. "I like to look at outfits the way one of
my favorite bloggers, wearpalettes, does — as personal color
compositions.
Lorica is more likely to snap your photo outside Green or
Tresidder.
After a long stretch of rain, she snapped photos of students
who brightened her day.
"One chose a cowboy hat, the other, a leather jacket and
cozy scarf," wrote Lorica. "Either way they're staying dry and
happy!"
"You don't have to read Vogue or be a size 00 to have
style," Lorica wrote on her site. "Unlike models in magazine,
these are real, relatable students... We salute those who dare to
experiment, and we encourage you all to express yourselves."
Not long into our chat, the two girls — who had corre
sponded before, but never met — discovered they have more
in common than they had previously realized.
Both hail from Maryland, both sport a similar look, and
both firmly believe that fashion should be accessible to all.
Their inspirations, however, come very different places.

"I'm really inspired by Japanese fashion, especially from
Harajuku," said Jackson, 'i love alternative styles and bright,
urban colors."
Lorica, on the other hand, adores vintage clothing and
holds her grandmother — "an always well-dressed woman."
she said — as a role model.
But despite all this talk of fashion and looks, just how im
portant is looking fashionable at Stanford?
"There definitely will be days when I'm lazy or stressed
out, so I just throw on the old sweater and jeans," Jackson said.
"But fashion is still important," said Lorica. "How you
look, after all, is the first impression you give to people."
Those of us with a tight budget can be reassured that look
ing stylish doesn't have to be a bank-breaking endeavor.
"1 think there is a difference between fashion and style,"
said Lorica. "Fashion is what's on the runway and is super
pricy, but style is individual self-expression."
"Actually, nowadays I'm more turned off by high fashion."
she added.
This is understandable, as Lorica held a Devil Wears Prada
esque summer internship with Vera Wang in New York City
— complete with cruel superiors and endless coffee runs.
But, Lorica admitted, she did get free clothes out of the job.
and she is hoping to intern with Ralph Lauren this coming
summer.
Jackson, on the other hand, will have much more fashion to
blog about as well — she is going to Kyoto this Spring, where
she will be surrounded by Japanese fashion every day.
