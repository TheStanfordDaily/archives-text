## Editorial Board Finding a solution to the housing crunch 
### 
From the stuffy, textbook-lined
makeshift room in the basement of
Crothers to the one-room quad on the
bottom floor of 717 Dolores, "housing
crunch" has taken on a whole new meaning. In
what has become an annual debacle, the glut
of fall quarter study-abroad undergraduates
that returned to campus in January again out
numbered their counterparts leaving Stan
ford during winter quarter, forcing Student
Housing to come up with even more "cre
ative" solutions to the ongoing housing crisis.
According to Chief I lousing Officer Rodger
Whitney, there were contingency plans in the
works to accommodate even more students
by placing undergrads in Escondido Village
(EV) high-rises and assigning them graduate
student roommates in all-graduate housing.
A temporary overflow is fine, perhaps to
be expected, considering the volume of stu
dents moving in and out each quarter, some
times on quite short notice. But currently, stu
dents with "guaranteed" housing are no
longer living in any sort of habitable space.
With the conscription of common rooms into
"overflow" sleeping areas and the conversion
of basement storage spaces to cramped one
room quads, the University comes perilously
close to crossing the guaranteed-housing line.
If student housing places undergraduates in
EV, it will be crossed.
Housing Assignments Director Sue
Nunan was quoted in a Jan. 14 Daily article
saying the situation is better now than it was
last year. Nunan also noted that all students
with guaranteed housing (of which every stu
dent is awarded four years as long as he or she
meets all obligatory application deadlines) re
ceived room assignments by Jan. 7. before the
beginning of the term. All rooms and living
spaces were inspected before move-in by a
housing supervisor, who approved the as
signed rooms as up to code. This timeline was
an improvement over previous years, in which
some students spent the first week of winter
quarter in the SLAC Guest I louse.
The testimony of disgruntled new resi
dents in Crothers and 717. however, paints a
slightly different picture of this winter quar
ter's improvised housing situation, where the
definition of'livable' depends on whether you
are part of the University's housing staff or an
undergraduate returning from abroad. Stu
dent Housing has been as accommodating as
possible â€” officials report that all 10 students
in the "overflow" rooms could have been reas
signed within a week to more traditional quar
ters, but only a few asked. The hassle of mov

ing into two rooms over the span of a hectic
week at the beginning of winter quarter, how
ever, is not an attractive option to most stu
dents. Sufficient housing on day one should be
the expectation.
'Ihe Munger graduate housing complex,
slated to be completed in 2(XR will open up
new space for NX) students on campus and do
much to alleviate the current housing strug
gles. But the crunch has gone on long enough,
and waiting for the arrival of Munger is a dis
service to the majority of current students,
who will be long gone by the time the dorm is
ready for occupation.
Ihe University's resistance to rent rebates
or discounts for these overflow rooms further
adds to student frustration. Ihis could be an
efficient and equitable solution to the housing
crunch that does not involve waiting on new
dorms to be built or herdinggrad students into
the Oak C'reek apartments. But the Universi
ty, in a well-intentioned effort to prevent afflu
ent students from buying their way to nicer
off-campus housing, refuses to price room
bills differently.
For students randomly placed into over
flow housing by the lottery, rent rebates are a
sensible policy that will not create a housing
system divided between the haves and have
nots. It's a plan that can be introduced, reliev
ing pressure in the system, and then phased
out quietly when the Munger residences go
online. Does Student Housing really imagine
that people will sell housing space, or that the
hassle of moving just to achieve a rent rebate
is worth it?
Stanford already offers subsidies to grad
students who are interested in living off-cam
pus. Earlier in 2007, Student Housing down
sized this subsidy program due to a decline in
demand for off-campus housing, and the Uni
versity terminated some contracts in June.
Now is the time, however, to expand the sub
sidies already offered to grad students, who
are more likely th in undergrads to own a car
and to want to live off-campus.
Ihe crunch is not Student I lousing's fault.
Ihese stop-gap measures to fix it. however,
are not an acceptable solution. If Stanford
wants to boast of its "guaranteed housing," the
University needs to increase housing subsi
dies off-campus or offer more attractive living
options on-campus.
Any talk from the president's office of ex
panding the student body seems aloof when
our current student body is bulging at the
seams. Whether an increase in students is ap
proved or not. we need to fix housing first.
