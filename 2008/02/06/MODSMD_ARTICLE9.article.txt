DAVE HERBERT: Vice President
John Garner famously stated that his
office "wasn't worth a warm bucket
of spit." I feel much the same way about the
position of Daily columnist. It's a pro bono
gig, for starters. If you write about a certain
congressman from Texas who is running for
President — whose name I won't mention
because this column will pop up on Google
searches — you get to wade through hun
dreds of nasty online comments.
And you can forget about making a dif
ference, because Stanford students pick up
Ihe Daily for three things: the Bunnies, the
crossword puzzle and the hope that one day
a childless Atherton couple will be looking
for a five-foot six-inch physics major with
eczema and a club foot to be the "sperm
donor of our dreams."
I wrote a column from Berlin my junior
year. My proudest moment? Proctor &
Gamble read my satire about the multitude
of Old .Spice scents and mailed me a big box
of deodorant. The accompanying letter
gushed,"To express how much we appreciate
your recognition, we'd like to familiarize you
with some of our products in the scents you
mentioned as your favorites — After [lours.
Pure Sport and Glacial Falls." P&G went on
to offer me a lifetime supply.
The students who founded this newspa
per in 1892 could scarcely have dreamed, sit
ting in their dank, clapboard dormitory, sur
rounded by raptors and Puritans and what
have you, that their publication would one
day be a vehicle for Japanese number puz
zles. And yet here we are.
Why am I back for more, you ask?The an
swer sits across the room from me as I type.
He is my roommate of three years and clos
est confidante. He is, in short, the pet lobster
to my Oscar Wilde.
Brendan and I are about to leave here
with master's degrees in religious studies and
journalism.respectively But before we stum
ble into life, we'd like to have our say. We'll

offer some thoughts on post-grad life, the
University's infantilizing of the student body,
the 2(X)8 election and, of course, new Old
Spice products as they become known to us.
But if you tie up the message boards with
hate mongering, I will spend the rest of the
volume writing about that Texas congress
man running for president. I will make sure
he is elected president, and then together we
will crucify you bastards on a cross of gold.
BRENDAN SELBY:Why should you
read this column? Because I'm a rep
resentative Stanford student. I under
stand what it's like to live in this treacherous
place. I'm just like you.
Have you heard about those guys who
got placed in the windowless, basement
study room in Crothers because ResEd ran
out of housing? Well, the same thing hap
pened to me. For the last 12 weeks I've been
living in the stacks at Green. It's true. You
can come visit me on level W5, where my bed
is shoved between two shelves, one contain
ing every copy of Who's Who dating back to
17%, the other containing 500 gilded vol
umes of Islamic law. It's a tough situation,
but at least they didn't make me live down in
the steam tunnels, like they had to do during
the Battle of Britain — now those were
tough times.
I 'm representative of every political opin
ion. I vehemently support both Israel and
Palestine to the exclusion of the other, and I
make a point of protesting whenever either
