About $35,000 worth of stolen electronics
were recovered by police after a recent series

officials told residents Wednesday.

The deputies repeatedly praised Sterling
Quad residents for the actions they t<x)k to

prevent the robberies and the way they react

"I'm sorry your rooms were broken into"
Kuhn told the crowd, "but you did a great job

Kuhn emphasized the need to lock doors,
especially the main doors leading into the
dorm. The deputies themselves had entered
the dorm through an unlocked d<x>r on their
way to the meeting.
It remains unknown how the thieves
entered the locked dorm, but the deputies
