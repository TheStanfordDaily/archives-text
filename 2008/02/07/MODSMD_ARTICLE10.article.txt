## Police caution students about thefts GovCo residents wanted against propping doors 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About $35,000 worth of stolen electronics
were recovered by police after a recent series
of robberies on West Campus, public safety
officials told residents Wednesday.
Five uniformed deputies from the
Stanford Department of Public Safety came
to a meeting of Sterling Quad residents last
night to discuss the recent spate of robberies.

"There is an immutable law of crime,"
Deputy Harris Kuhn told the residents. "If a
criminal wants something bad enough, no
matter what precautions you take, they are
going to get it, no matter what the conse
quences are for the criminal."
Kuhn said that the suspects, identified as
Delarian Lee. 20, of San Francisco, Kethen
Hubbard, 26, of San Francisco, and Rashima
Barnett. 19, of Novato, were well-prepared for
the crime.
"These guys came here ready to rock and
roll," Kuhn said, "They had scouted the area
the day before, and they came with the t<x>ls
and personnel to take the property."
The deputies repeatedly praised Sterling
Quad residents for the actions they t<x)k to

prevent the robberies and the way they react
ed to the crimes.
"I'm sorry your rooms were broken into"
Kuhn told the crowd, "but you did a great job
locking d(x>rs and writing down serial num
bers [of your electronics]. Normally when we
go to laptop burglaries, the doors are open
and the property is unattended."
Kuhn emphasized the need to lock doors,
especially the main doors leading into the
dorm. The deputies themselves had entered
the dorm through an unlocked d<x>r on their
way to the meeting.
It remains unknown how the thieves
entered the locked dorm, but the deputies
assumed that the door was propped
or someone let the suspects in.
Wendy Kalkus '11, whose laptop
was stolen from her dorm room last
week, attended the meeting with
hopes to learn more about the safety
of her dorm.
"My computer was gone, my
roommate's computer was gone and
my roommate's ipod was gone,"
Kalkus said. "I definitely don't think
the dorm is as safe as I thought it was."
Although she was unhappy with
the burglaries, Kalkus was unable to
think of anything she, or the Stanford
police, could have done to stop the
thieves.
"Being safe is fantastic, but 1 can't
think of what they would do different
ly," she said.
Ilie deputies repeatedly reminded
residents to immediately report suspi
cious persons to the police, telling res
idents that seeing a suspicious person
was a valid reason to call 911.
"We are an open and trusting com
munity," Kuhn said, "and we let ran
doms walk through the dorms with
out challenging them and seeing what
their business is"
Kalkus was nevertheless grateful
for the police's actions.
"They did a really good job of get
ting there right away," she said. "ITiey
were at the scene before I even got
back to my dorm."
