# STUDENT LIFE
## Kenyan students react to election turmoil 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Following the closest, most controversial
election in Kenyan history on Dec. 27, 2007,
protests and riots broke out in the East
African nation. Now that they are back at
Stanford, a number of students from Kenya
are trying to make sense of the violence plagu
ing their home country.
I've lost some of my friends already in the
violence," said Sylviah Wanjiku Nyamu '09,
who was raised in Nairobi, Kenya. "And oth
ers, sometimes they don't pick up their phones
when 1 call, and I have no idea if they're ok."
Hundreds have died and 250,000 have
been forced to flee their homes in a combina
tion of politically incited ethnic killings and
efforts of police to quell protests. Rioting and
looting now occur on a daily basis. Despite
UN-led peace talks. President Mwai Kibaki
and opposition leader Raila Odinga remain
opposed to cooperation, and attacks continue

in the streets, leaving innocent civilians dead.
Nyamu has not been back to Kenya since
coming to Stanford in 2005, but the majority of
her extended family still lives in Nairobi. She
has tried to call her family and friends there
every day, but has a sense that they hide the
worst of the conflict from her.
They try to protect me, because they know
I'm a student here," she said, "but I don't like
that."
Nyamu felt surprised when she first heard
that riots broke out following the election.
"I didn't see it coming," she said. "When
you look at Kenya, we've been really stable
until now — but come Dec. 27, things
changed."
Peter Chadri '09, who spent most of his life
in Nairobi, he has not been back to the coun
try since 2003. However, he has an older sister
still living in Kenya.
"I was disgusted and ashamed of the vio-
lence that erupted after the elec
tions." Chadri said. "I was not taken
by complete and utter surprise. I was
just hoping that people wouldn't
arrive at such desperation or foolish
ness."
Both Chadri and Nyamu were
critical of the government's role in
inciting the violence and its apparent
disregard for the innocent lives lost in
the conflict.
"The majority of the violence was
(instigated by] Luos [a tribe in
KenyaJ who are mostly Raila sup
porters," Chadri said. "They've been
killing and displacing Kikuyus—>
mainly Kibaki supporters — and
barely vice versa."
"1 am a Kikuyu, which is the tribe
most affected by this conflict,"
Nyamu said. "The president right
now is Kikuyu, but he won't meet
with the Luos opposition leader. No
one will come together and talk
about what's going on. I'm really
upset that the government leaders
can't communicate."

The students remained most con
cerned about the civilians caught in
the crossfire of the riots rather than
the political outcome.
"I hope we get tired of thinking by
our tribes" Chadri said. "Some peo
ple protested peacefully, both
Kikuyus and Luos, saying that
they've always lived together peace
fully — why now the violence?"
"1 hope there is emotional sup
port for the women after the violence
is over," Nyamu added. "So many
have lost husbands and brothers, and
still have children to provide for.
Who will help them when the fight
ing is over?"
As they experience the conflict
from afar. Nyamu and Chadri only
hope Kenya returns to the place of
stability it has been for so many
years.
"[I hope] for the displaced people
to be able to get back to their homes,
and for people from different tribes
to treat others as human beings, for
things to go back to the way they
were," Nyamu said. "I'm scared that
we won't be able to get back to the
way we were."
