## Research advances despite stem cell controversy Federal regulations hinder but do not stop advances 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Researchers still do not know the full
impact of the Bush administration's 2001
decision to cut federal funding for the devel
opment of new embryonic stem cell lines.
But if the groundbreaking research show
cased at Monday's Beckman Symposium on
Cancer and Stem Cells is any indication,
Stanford researchers have charged ahead
toward discovering treatments for breast,
colon and prostate cancer.
The president's moratorium on stem cell
funding initially set back research at Stanford
and cost the University potential scientists.
"We had to look carefully to make sure no
facility, no test and no experiment used even
a penny of federal dollars," said Irv
Weissman, director of Stanford's Institute for
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine. "Then we had to go right away and
raise $15 million to build a facility not
financed by federal dollars."

Fortunately for California researchers,
state lawmakers passed Proposition 71 in
2004 to create the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine and allocate $3 bil
lion in state bonds for continued stem cell
research.
Court appeals held up the proposition for
three years before it was finally implemented
in 2007. During that time, Weissman said,
researchers from the National Cancer
Institute who were planning to come to
Stanford chose to go to Singapore instead.
But Law Prof. Hank Greely said the
administration's move may have actually
benefited Stanford research.
"In the long run, without the Bush funding
ban, we wouldn't have the California
Institute of Regenerative Medicine which
was founded by Prop. 71, and Prop. 71 is
pouring more funding into stem cell research
than I think we would have gotten from the
NIH [National Institutes of Health]," said
Greely, who chairs the California Advisory
Committee on Human Embryonic Stem Cell
Research and the steering committee for the
Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. "I
don't think we arc further behind today than
we would have been without Bush's policy."
