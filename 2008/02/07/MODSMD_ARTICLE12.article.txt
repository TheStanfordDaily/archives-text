## Research advances despite stem cell controversy Federal regulations hinder but do not stop advances 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Researchers still do not know the full
impact of the Bush administration's 2001
decision to cut federal funding for the devel
opment of new embryonic stem cell lines.
But if the groundbreaking research show
cased at Monday's Beckman Symposium on
Cancer and Stem Cells is any indication,
Stanford researchers have charged ahead
toward discovering treatments for breast,
colon and prostate cancer.
The president's moratorium on stem cell
funding initially set back research at Stanford
and cost the University potential scientists.
"We had to look carefully to make sure no
facility, no test and no experiment used even
a penny of federal dollars," said Irv
Weissman, director of Stanford's Institute for
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine. "Then we had to go right away and
raise $15 million to build a facility not
financed by federal dollars."

Fortunately for California researchers,
state lawmakers passed Proposition 71 in
2004 to create the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine and allocate $3 bil
lion in state bonds for continued stem cell
research.
Court appeals held up the proposition for
three years before it was finally implemented
in 2007. During that time, Weissman said,
researchers from the National Cancer
Institute who were planning to come to
Stanford chose to go to Singapore instead.
But Law Prof. Hank Greely said the
administration's move may have actually
benefited Stanford research.
"In the long run, without the Bush funding
ban, we wouldn't have the California
Institute of Regenerative Medicine which
was founded by Prop. 71, and Prop. 71 is
pouring more funding into stem cell research
than I think we would have gotten from the
NIH [National Institutes of Health]," said
Greely, who chairs the California Advisory
Committee on Human Embryonic Stem Cell
Research and the steering committee for the
Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. "I
don't think we arc further behind today than
we would have been without Bush's policy."
Greely said the political climate
for stem cell research funding at the
federal level would likely improve
with the next presidential adminis
tration.
"I do think the temperature on
this is likely to be turned down some
on January 20,2(X) ( ), because whoev
er becomes president will relax the
Bush limits on funding," he said.
Although Stanford would likely
get a share of this increased federal
funding, Greely said it would pro
vide a greater benefit to other uni
versities.
"Our peer institutions outside
California will benefit more from the
increased NIH funding than we will
because the California Institute for

Regenerative Medicine is pouring
more funding into Stanford's
Institute than we will ever get from
the NIH," Greely said.
The ethical controversy sur
rounding the issue stems from
whether a human embryo can be
considered a human being. Many
religious conservatives believe the
scientific manipulation of an embryo
constitutes murder.
Weissman disagreed.
"I do not believe that any cell
from human beings, including a
pluripotent cell, is a born human
being," he said.
Weissman said individuals should
be entitled to their own beliefs but
have no right to pass a policy that
denies potential cures to other indi
viduals. He said the Bush administra
tion has overstepped its bounds in
this matter, calling the president's
2(X)I mandate "inconsistent and hyp
ocritical" in light of the approval of

in-vitro fertilization clinics' practice
of disposing of about ten thousand
fertilized eggs every year.
"In the end it's the patients that
had diseases which were progressing,
and whose diseases could have bene
fited from treatment derived from
stem cell lines, that suffered most,"
Weissman said. "And who's taking
the moral responsibility for their
lives? Certainly not the president, yet
we doctors took an oath that saving
those patients' lives is our job."
Both Weissman and Greely said
that as soon as treatment from
embryonic stem cells became a reali
ty. protests against the research
would stop.
"After we come up with cures,"
Weissman said, "the critics won't be
objecting when someone in their
family gets the disease."
