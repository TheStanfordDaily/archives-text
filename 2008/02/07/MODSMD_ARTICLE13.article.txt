## GSC outlines plans for Diversity Week 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Plans for a weeklong diversi
ty forum were presented to the
Graduate Student Council
(GSC) last night by Cullen
Buie, co-chair of the ASSU
Diversity and Tolerance
Committee.
According to Buie, a fifth year
graduate student in mechanical
engineering, the Diversity Week
event, which is still in the works,
will be a joint initiative between
the ASSU and the GSC Diversity
Committee and will run from
Feb. 25 to Feb. 29. Speakers will
include Jacyn Lewis, Associate
Vice Provost for Faculty
Development and Diversity;
Patricia Jones, Vice Provost for

Faculty Development and
Diversity; and Patricia Gumport,
Vice Provost for Graduate
Education.
Though the event focuses on
implementing new projects and
ideas for graduate and under
graduate diversity programs on
campus, Buie said organizers
want to particularly emphasize
the importance of student and
faculty diversity in the sciences.
"We want to inundate the
University with diversity ideas,"
Buie said. "The committee
wants to bring awareness
among the graduate and under
graduate populations regarding
diversity issues on campus."
