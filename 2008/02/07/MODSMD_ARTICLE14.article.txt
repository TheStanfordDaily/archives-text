# STUDENT LIFE
## Recycling contest kicks off at Farm 
### E. BLAIR LAING 
Harvard and Stanford are
competing for more than

just the top students this
year. For the second time,

Stanford is competing in
Recycle Mania, a nation-

j ,
wide recycling competi
tion among 400 col-

leges and universities
in 46 states.

Beginning last
week and continuing
through April 5,

Stanford's recycling pro
gram will measure recycling
and waste on a weekly basis,
with the goal of promoting recycling
through friendly competition.
"Recycle Mania gives us a chance
to bring some awareness with a little
bit of fun," said Julie Muir. the head
of recycling for the Peninsula
Sanitary Service, Inc. "It offers an
opportunity to have center stage on
campus with 10 weeks focused on a
message of recycling."
The contest offers multiple cate
gories of competition, including
largest amount of recyclables per
capita, largest amount of total recy
clables, least amount of trash per
capita and highest recycling rate.
Some of the usual front runners
include Cal State San Marcos, Miami
University, Point Loma Nazarene
University and the University of
Oregon.
In 2007, Stanford recycled the sec
ond highest total amount of recy
clables, trailing only Rutgers. All of
the schools competing in
Recycle Mania that year recycled a
total of 41.3 million pounds of mate
rial.
Recycle Mania was started in 2001
as a competition between Ohio
University and Miami University.
Each succeeding year, the number of
schools participating nearly doubled,
with 201 schools participating last
year and 400 this year.
Muir is turning to student interns
to spread the Recycle Mania message
across campus. The program's interns
have put up posters in dining halls
and White Plaza, and they are work-

EMILY VOGEL/The Stanford Daily
ing with Students for a Sustainable
Stanford and the Green Living
Council to set up email chains and
promote the competition.
Shila Soni '07, one of the student
interns, said she is "hoping people
passionate about recycling will
spread the word" about
Recycle Mania.
But Muir acknowledged there is

still work to be done.
"1 want to ban trash for 10
weeks," said Muir, half-jokingly.
"There are choices we can make. We
need to think creatively about waste
minimization."
The results from the first week of
the competition will be available
Friday morning on Recycle Mania's
Web site, www.recyclemaniacs.org.
