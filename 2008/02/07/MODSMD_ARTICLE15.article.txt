## Dyson reflects on King legacy 
### MIMA MOHAMMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Hip-Hop Intellectual" Michael Eric Dyson
reflected on race and the legacy of civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. last night to an overflowing
room inTresidder Union.
Hie Stanford chapter of the NAACP sponsored
the visit of the ordained minister, syndicated radio
talk show host, prolific author and Georgetown
University professor of theology. English and
African American studies.
In a two-hour speech peppered with rapping and
singing, Dyson had audience members both roaring
with laughter and nodding in sober agreement.
Dyson addressed a variety of concerns along race,
class and generational lines, focusing on topics rang
ing from hip-hop to the use of the "n-word."
"Our history is filled with distortions of amne
sia," Dyson said. "We live in the United States of
Amnesia."
Dyson's speech focused mainly on the legacy of
King, his struggle and how he is remembered in
American history. 1 le recalled an incident in April
1%8 when about 70 members of Stanford's Black
Student Union marched into Memorial Auditorium
days after King was assassinated and demanded the
increase of African American representation in the
student body and faculty.
He said that Stanford students must continue to
stand for the vision that King promoted.
"Forty years later, a black man, Barack Obama, is
a beneficiary of King's legacy," Dyson said. "But we
must remember, electing a black man to office will
not stop poverty the next day. There are limits pro
posed on those who are elected to office."
Dyson argued that the ideals King stood for have
now been watered down and sweetened. In fact, he
said people should not forget that King struggled
and was scrutinized and disliked by many at the
time of his death.
"He was lifted up in history because he was let
down on that balcony in Memphis," Dyson said.
He reminded audience members that King gave
most of his earnings to the civil rights movement,
knowing that it was a movement from the bottom
up rather than the the top down. Dyson emphasized
the struggle that King faced personally, as he was
continually hounded by death threats and even with
government wire tappings.
"Don't get caught up in the mythology," Dyson
said, "He got killed because he was a great man who
challenged the world, he made us uncomfortable.
Had ho lived, he would not have been famous. He
would have been irrelevant."
He urged Stanford students to work to make the
legacy of King a reality.
"Carry those demonized and oppressed minori
ties," Dyson said, "people who never will have the
opportunities you have."
