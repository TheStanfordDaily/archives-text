## Editorial Board Meet the Editorial Board 
### 
The Stanford Daily has selected a group
of four students to sit on its editorial
board for Volume 233, which runs until
June. The application process was open and
the position was advertised for a week in
January in the Opinions section, as well as in
an all-campus e-flier. Hie members of this
volume's Editorial Board are a talented and
capable group of Stanford students with a
wide range of backgrounds and perspec
tives. To better inform our readers, we have
written up brief biographies for each of the
board members below.
Sagar Doshi is a junior and is one of the
oh-so-happy undergrads to be put in
Crothers this quarter. He's a Political Sci
ence major from Chicago who loves to learn
about and debate politics and international
affairs. I le would also like to note that if any
one needs a subject to practice giving back
rubs, he's your man.
Zev Karlin-Neumann is still a freshman,
still living in Junipero and still from Palo
Alto, but much more exhausted than when
he wrote his last blurb in October. I le would
like to take this opportunity to endorse a
presidential candidate, which his editor pre

vented him from doing officially. Mint:
rhymes with "Iraq" and "Osama."
Mark Kogan is a junior double-majoring
in International Relations and Communica
tion. He is the resident libertarian and also
the founder and editor of The Stanford Lib
erty. I le hails from Olympia. Wash, and lives
in ilieta Delta Chi.
Riaz Rahim is a senior Economics major
co-terming in International Policy Studies.
Although he now resides in Birmingham,
Ala., he grew up by the ocean in southern
California and laments Stanford's compara
tively landlocked geographical placement.
He is still adjusting to the northern climate
and the strange slang of the Bay Area. You
can catch him over at Haus Mitteleuropa
where he is sure to be drinking something
caffeinated while perusing the BBC home
page.
The Editorial Board's published editori
als reflect a consensus of opinion among
board members, and we hope these brief in
troductions provide some insight into the
identities and actions of the board. Here's to
a vibrant and edifying Opinions section in
Volume 233!

Unsigned editorials in the space above represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The
board consists of two Daily editorial staffers and six community members-at-large. Any signed columns and
contributions are the views of their respective writers and do not necessarily
represent the views of the editorial board.
