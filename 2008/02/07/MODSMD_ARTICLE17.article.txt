## Flesh-eating worms and other exotic diseases 
### 
It's that time of year. Lots of rain, lots of
work. And just when you can least afford it.
you notice you aren't feeling that great.
Sometimes nothing can defend against the kid
sneezing behind you in lecture or the sick
sweaty guy on the other IM team. It definitely
wasn't that cup you shared at that party. Alco
hol's a disinfectant, right?
However you became ill, I m here to tell you
not to worry. Yes, your midterms will probably
suffer.and your love life might take another hit.
But things could be worse.Trust me. Your cold
is nothing compared to the worms 1 once had in
my arm.
If you are easily disgusted you should prob
ably stop here. Gautama Siddharta. the
founder of modern Buddhism, once said,
"Every human being is the author of his own
health or disease." If this is true, then I am a ter
rible writer (in multiple ways) — or at least I
have a sick sense of humor.
But here we go. After two summers in
Africa, these are some of my sickest moments:
1. Mango Worms: The mango fly sounds harm
less. But its parasitic breeding led to one of the
defining moments of my 2(X)6 summer in
Uganda. One day.after about a week of putting
antibiotic cream on what I thought was an in
fected mosquito bite, I broke the cardinal rule
of bug bites: I squeezed it as hard as I could.This
is one of the few cases, however, where a rash
decision turned out well for me. With few hard
pinches, I was able to force out a white lump
from the small hole in the bite on my forearm.
Then it moved.
After peeling myself off the ceiling. I put the
maggoty creature on a piece of paper and car
ried it downstairs to show my Ugandan friends.
At first, they were baffled, but I eventually
learned that mango flies lay eggs on pretty
much anything near a mango tree. If you leave
your clothes outside to dry, you have to iron
them to kill the heat seeking larvae the mango
flies could have left behind. Ihms out, though,
that Ugandans have developed immunity, and
only hapless non-Africans like me tend to get
infected. As the worms grow, they take bigger
and bigger bites of the inside of your arm (or
wherever you're infested) before breaking
through your skin to take flight. Luckily, I
caught the worm early and only lost a little flesh
before I got the sucker out.TTie removal was
gross, and a bit painful, but my arm felt a whole
lot better after it was gone.
2. Cholera: Did you know cholera still exists?
Before I got it in Ghana last summer. I hadn't
heard much about the disease since 1 stopped
playing The Oregon Trail. My mom still doesn't
believe that I actually had it. but trust me, you
know when you do. Basically,your body expels
water faster than you can drink it, and the
process isn't pretty — you can probably guess
the method of expulsion. Without rehydration
treatments, rapid loss of water and electrolytes
can be deadly, especially for the young. I Aickily
for me, a Canadian friend in my hostel had a
can of condensed Gatorade powder, and after
about 24 h< >urs and lots of Gatorade, I survived.
My esteem for Canadians had never been high
er.Thc lesson? Wash your hands more.
X Strep Throat. Not exotic, you say? Perhaps,

but I'm including it in my list anyway. I was trav
eling in a small town in Ghana when suddenly
I came down with a raging fever. 1 was terrified.
In Ghana, the words fever and malaria are used
synonymously,and malaria isn't something you
can squeeze out of your arm. After fighting the
fever for a few days, I finally went to a clinic in
the capital city of Accra. The doctor looked at
my throat, told me 1 clearly didn't have malar
ia. and scolded me for not seeing a debtor s<x)n
er. Overprescrihed or not. 1 sure was grateful
for antibiotics.
4. Stomach Amoeba: As my friends at the I laas
center will tell everyone they send abroad this
year, one of the main things you have to watch
in any developing country is the food. Back in
Uganda. I ate at my office's low budget em
ployee cafeteria for most of the summer — I
made friends at lunch, ate healthy, lost weight.
But one day my stomach hurt more than usual.
A very nice Swedish doctor found I had a stom
ach parasite (after analyzing my stool sample),
and gave me medication to kill it. Glamorous. I
know.
If you've made it this far and still don't feel bet
ter, you may need medicine instead of rela
tivism. But hey, I did what I could. Now go wash
vour hands.
