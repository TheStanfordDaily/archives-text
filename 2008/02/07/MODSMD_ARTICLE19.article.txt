## Obama's honesty lesson 
### 
On Tuesday morning 1 sat down at my
computer and started writing a politi
cal rant about Hillary Clinton's Iraq
war vote in 2(X)2. Clinton claims she believed
Bush would use the war authorization as a
threat to push inspections, rather than to start
a war; my rant argued that this evidenced a
dangerous credulousness on Clinton's part.
First, you'd have to be a moron to believe
Bush was not hell-bent on starting a war in
Iraq. Second, if you got duped by George
Bush, who will you get duped by next? Trust
ing the right people is crucial to being a good
president, and George Bush is not "the right
people," not by any stretch. Third, if we take
Clinton's explanation at face value, then she
is naive, credulous, a poor judge of character
and a crappy negotiator — exactly not the
sort of person whose finger we want on the
button.
The Iraq war vote was not a particularly
important consideration for me in picking
who to support because I can imagine any
number of plausible reasons Clinton might
have voted to authorize war. Democracy
building is difficult,for example — any effort
has a chance of failure as well as a chance of
success. If she had merely said,"My judgment
was based on my hopes rather than my fears
— we took a chance and ultimately it was a
losing bet," I would have accepted that. I
would probably even have accepted the ex
planation that the Democratic minority in
the Senate could not stop a President deter
mined to start a war. and that she could make
a bigger difference from the inside than as a
critic. Or whatever.
But in order to avoid describing it as a
gamble or a political move, Clinton decided
to put the onus on President Bush. To most

voters this is a better explanation, but to me
it's not — it makes her seem naive, gullible
and stupid. And so I wrote a rant saying that
Hillary Clinton is claiming to be naive,
gullible and stupid, and I don't want a naive,
gullible and stupid president. But wait —
that's just not plausible. I saw in the National
Enquirer that she gave birth to a two-headed
bat-boy, but even the Enquirer would not
claim that Hillary Clinton is naive, gullible
and stupid. There is not a stupid bone in her
body. Me sitting down and writing a rant as
though 1 took her naive-and-stupid claim se
riously was as silly as her claiming to take
Bush's I-don't-want-to-start-a-war claim se
riously.
It is her insincere explanation, not her
vote in the first place, that I actually object to.
I don't think I'm alone — the American peo
ple are cannier than anyone gives them cred
it for. While they might not call George Bush
or Hillary Clinton a liar outright, over time
most people do get the sense they are being
spun.
This "spin" is not considered an outrage,
because it's widely believed that that's how
politics works. When we hear a politician say
ing, "I believe so-and-so is the best person to
lead America." we assume they are trying to
win favor with that person's incoming admin

istration, or get a reciprocal endorsement
later on. or something. Not telling the truth is
the default, not the exception. But insincerity
is especially tempting in politics, where hav
ing friends gives you power and power gives
you the potential to do good. Insincerity is at
the heart of making friends in politics, the
theory goes, so it tempts even those with the
best intentions.
Early on in his career, 1 would guess.
Barack Ohama decided this theory of insin
cerity and political sway was a siren song. In
sincerity may deliver a short-term boost, but
in the long run your ability to make change
depends on people believing what you say.
Nobody will be inspired by false promises
and empty rhetoric.but a person with integri
ty has the potential to persuade people. At
the very least. I can imagine Obama deciding
to make a gamble:" I may be a successful hon
est politician, or I may be a failure of an hon
est politician, but I will be honest."
Honesty is a habit, not an ad-hoc decision.
You cannot tell yourself you will dissemble to
get power, but when the moment of truth
comes you will stick to your beliefs.There will
always be a reason to put your integrity on
hold, and if you bend your principles only
when you need to, all your most important
decisions will be unprincipled. 1 nsincerity is a
creeping rot that can take hold of an individ
ual's mind — or an entire political system. It
can become so unremarkable that we stop
even noticing it.
Barack Obama's example reminds us all
that honesty is not the destination, but the
road itself.
