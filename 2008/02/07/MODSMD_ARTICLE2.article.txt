# Card hopes top-10 rank is just a start
## 
### BY PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
It was Monday afternoon and The As
sociated Press and USA
Today/ESPN polls had just been re
leased; Stanford was ranked ninth in
both, its highest showing since 2004's
number-one seeded squad.
What did head coach Trent Johnson do?
Give them the day off? A pat on the back?
Not Johnson.
"I told them nothing changes," Johnson
said. "Yes, it's a reward, and good to be
thought of like that. But how did we get
there?"
Coming off a rare road sweep of the
Washington schools last weekend, John
son's team is at peak form in his four years
at the helm of the Cardinal. No player has
seen this much success in his collegiate ca
reer â€” save for senior forward Fred Wash
ington, who was a freshman when the Card
went 30-2 before bowing out in the second
round of the NCAA tournament.
Having been there before, Johnson told
his players there is still plenty of work to be
done.
"You can say all the coaching cliches you
want," he said,"but we've got to continue to
work, worry about getting better. Nobody
wants to hear that, but that's the facts."
Halfway through the Pac-10 schedule,
Stanford (18-3.7-2 Pac-10) sits squarely in
second place, one game behind No. 5
UCLA and two games ahead of No. 17
Washington State, Arizona State and USC
Strong defense and rebounding has pow
ered the Cardinal in conference play; the
team is top in the conference in blocked
shots (4.86 per game), second in the league
in points allowed (57.6) and opponent
shooting percentage (.385) and is an as
tounding third in the nation in rebounding
margin (10.2).
