## Posters, pettiness and Palestine

I'd like to comment about Stanford Israel
Alliance's (SIA) new poster campaign
and why it bothers me as a Stanford stu
dent and as a Jewish Zionist.
The first poster 1 encountered says,"What
do you call Arabs who stayed in Israel after
1948? Israeli citizens."Then it has a picture of
an old Arab man voting. At the bottom it
reads: "Israel: the oldest democracy in the
Middle East."
Yes, Arabs who stayed in Israel were given
Israeli citizenship and they do have the right
to vote. But if you're going to brag about Is
rael's history as a democracy, especially as it
pertains to its Arab citizens, you might note
that Arab Israelis were subject to military
rule and strict curfews for the first 16 years of
the state.They were not allowed to have their
own political parties for four decades. And
their roads, schools and medical centers are

still disproportionately under-funded.
Another poster has a quotation from
Martin Luther King, Jr. about how he sup
ports Israel. Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) was the first to
quote a famous Nobel Peace Prize winner
who fought racism but did not have particu
larly expert views on Middle Eastern affairs
to prove the nobility of the cause (Desmond
Tlitu),but now SI A seems to have jumped on
board. Quoting Nobel laureates who agree
with you and who are impossible to dislike is
a nice tactic, but it is as intellectually dishon
est as it is unproductive.
If we're going to claim Israel is a virtuous
democracy, we should compare it to actual
democracies, not smugly use neighboring
theocracies and pseudo-democracies to
make ourselves feel great about our state. Is
rael is quite obviously more democratic than

Egypt, and those who condemn Israel with
out pausing to consider this fact are quite ob
viously hypocrites, but that does not mean Is
rael is a paragon of virtue.
Take for instance the separation fence,
which SI A has defended in not one but two
posters. I have no problem with the concept
of a fence: it can (and has) saved dozens of Is
raeli lives, which in turn reduced the Israeli
response and thus also saved dozens of Pales
tinian lives. But I do have a problem with a
fence that runs through densely populated
regions of the West Bank rather than around
the territory as a whole, preventing people
from going to schools, jobs and hospitals. I
have a problem with a fence that does so to
include Israeli settlements which arc clearly
illegal under any reasonable interpretation
of the Geneva Convention (including that of
most Israeli scholars) and which are only jus

tified because God's law is supposedly higher
than human rights law.
1 am as Zionist as they come. I've lived in
Israel and plan on living there again. But
being a Zionist does not mean supporting Is
raeli policy regardless of its human toll. In
stead, being a Zionist means supporting a
Jewish state, a state that expresses Jewish val
ues. And if Jewish values do not include treat
ing minorities as equals, if Jewish values do
not include sympathy for the pains of a na
tion without a state and support for their
cause, then we have learned nothing from our
history. And if you look at Israel today, it has
fallen short of the Jewish values it was creat
ed to fulfill. So I criticize Israel, not out of
hate, but because of a sense of responsibility.
