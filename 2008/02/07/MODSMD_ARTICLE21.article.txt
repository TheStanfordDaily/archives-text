## NO. 1 CARD OFF TO NTI 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
With the weather clearing up nicely
on the Farm, it only made sense that the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
would be all set to head for the stormy
Midwest. After all. bad weather has been
the norm for the Cardinal so far this sea
son.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Stanford
women were ready to fly to the 2008 ITA
National Women's ream Indoor Cham
pionships in Madison, Wis., before in
clement weather in the Midwest kept
them waiting once again.
"Over my twenty years. I think we
have a very travel-experienced team,"
head coach Lele Forood said. "To be de
layed is not really messing anyone up.
We'll be driving to Madison in the morn
ing and practice courts are in the after
noon so we'll deal with it."
The numbers obviously don't lie for
the Cardinal women: 14 appearances, 64
wins, 14 finals appearances and nine
championships at the Indoors.
Today, the Cardinal looks to start an
other titie run at the I I As — its fourth in
five years— as it enters the first round
of the 200S Indoors at Madison, Wise,
against No. 11 Baylor at 1:30 pm.
Stanford enters the Indoors as the
number one team in the ITA rankings
with 748 votes and 8 of the 10 first place
ballots. However, coach Forood does not
look too much into the rankings.
"As we've discussed a month ago. the
number one team is the team that wins
the tournament," Forood said. "The
seedings or rankings don't mean any
thing right now. It's a slippery slope and if
we win the tournament I'll be happy to
call us the number one team."
Known for its extremely competitive
draw, the tournament's competitors in
clude No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Northwestern,
No. 4 Georgia Tech, No. 6 Georgia, No. 7
California. No. 8 Southern California and
No. 9 University of Miami (Florida) —
and those are just the top eight seeds.
Along with last year's runner-up
Notre Dame, sixteen teams will compete
over four days to crown a champion.
"Well, it's very hard to project for
ward in this tournament," Forood said of
the draw." I think what it shows right now
is that maybe no one is too far ahead of
anyone else. Rii>ht now, we can't think of

NATIONAL TEAM INDOORS
2// Madison, Wis.
GAME NOTES: The top ranked Cardinal women are
headed for the National Team Indoor Champi
onships in Madison, Wis. This weekend, hoping to
recapture the title there after falling last year to No.
6 Georgia in the semifinals. Prior to the loss the
Cardinal had won three consecutive NTI Champi
onships and 89 consecutive dual matches. Stan
ford is set to face No. 11 Baylor in the event's
opening round today at 1:30 p.m. PST.

anything but Baylor."
Beyond pure accolades, the Champi
onship is also a great indicator of which
team will stick around in May during the
NCAA Championships — six of the last
seven NCAA champions have made it to
the finals of the ITA Indoors the same
year they won.
In her first year as coach at Stanford,
Lele Forood became the first female
head coach to win the NCAA team title.
During that same season, her squad also
captured the Indoor title — coinciden
enough. Baylor was also Stanford's
first round opponent that year.
Stanford is 1-0 all-time against the
Bears, its only matchup coming in a 7-0
win at the 20(31 Indoors.
Though Baylor has only four appear
ances at the Championships to the Cardi
nal's 20. the Bears are no easy opponent.
Ilieir squad is led by three-time All-
American and 2005 NCAA Individual
National Champion Zuzana Zemenova.
Hie Bears also boast five players in the
top-100 of the singles rankings and two
duos in the top-50 for doubles.
This season, Baylor has trumped Stan
ford in their individual meetings.
In October, Zemenova dispatched
sophomore Lindsay Burdette at the ITA
All-American Championships, 6-4, 6-4.
Baylor's Lenka Broosova also defeated
senior Whitney Deason 6-0, 6-4 at the
ITA Ail-American qualifiers.

"We know their top players from the
individual tournaments," Forood said.
"But, they're a completely non-Ameri
can team so it's a bit of a surprise. We
don't really know their players very well,
but they're good players and they're
tough."
Fortunately, Stanford is not without
its own arsenal of top players and talent.
The Cardinal is coming off a season
opening 6-1 victory over UNLV, in which
it saw strong performances from both re
turning players and new freshmen.
Last year, Stanford's attempt at its
fourth straight title at the Indoors was

stymied by a Georgia Tech upset.The 4-3
loss broke the Cardinal's string of 89
straight victories, a streak that spanned
three national title runs.
This year, Stanford and Georgia Tech
are slated to potentially meet up again in
another semifinal matchup of two pow
erhouse teams.
However, the team must first take
care of business when it faces the Bears.
"We look forward to playing Baylor,"
Forood finished.
