well at the Winter Cup in "07, but he
will have to improve on last year's
performance to succeed in the Se
nior division. Hadden. a specialist on
still rings, pommel horse, and parallel
bars, could make the Team with a
strong showing in those events. Car
ney, the 2006 NCAA champion on
high bar, will be looking to qualify in
that event or one of his other special
ties, floor exercise and vault.
Stanford claims two current Na
tional Team members. Dave Sender
and Sho Nakamori. Sender is a two
time NCAA vault champion and
competed for the U.S. National Team
at the World Championships in 2006.
Nakamori, a great competitor in the
all-around competition, will be look
ing to solidify his spot on the Team as

well. Although he was forced to red
shirt last season due to injury,
Nakamori has been a star for the
Cardinal in 2(H)8.
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team is coming off a strong showing
at the Stanford Open on Jan. 26,
where it posted the highest score in
the country to date.
With seven freshmen — compris
ing almost 40 percent of the team —
head coach Thom Glielmi has his
hands full when trying to put togeth
er his best lineup. However, coach
Glielmi has been pleased with the
progress his young team has made.
The freshmen have been a vital part
of the team's early success, and they
will be counted on more and more as
the season continues.
Fortunately, the Cardinal has
strong senior leadership to rely on.
Seniors Chris Harper and Eli Al
caraz, along with co-captains Sender
and Carney, will be tasked with lead
ing a young and talented team

through the growing pains of the col
legiate gymnastics season.
They will he helped by Brice Rol
ston, a senior and team leader in '07
who returns as an assistant coach.
The team has already shown signs of
improvement and maturity — the
Cardinal's first-place finish at the
Stanford Open came just one week
after a disappointing road loss to
Cal.
The Winter Cup will include gym
nasts from Stanford, the University
of Illinois, Michigan. Oklahoma.
Ohio State, Minnesota, Penn State
and Nebraska along with athletes
from the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs and other clubs
from across the nation.
Competition begins today and
the field will be halved before Friday.
The finals will take place on Satur
