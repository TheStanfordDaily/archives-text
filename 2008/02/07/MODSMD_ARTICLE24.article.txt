## Woman steals identities, gains admission into top colleges One of Secret Service's most wanted dupes Harvard, Columbia 
### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TINLEY PARK. 111. â€” A woman suspected of
stealing other people's identities and duping
some of the country's top universities into admit
ting her and giving her student loans has been
arrested in a Chicago suburb, federal investiga
tors say.
Esther Elizabeth Reed, 29. was arrested on a
federal warrant Saturday in Tinley Park, said
Malcolm Wiley, spokesman for the Secret Service.
Reed, who had been one of the Secret
Service's most wanted fugitives, was indicted in
September by a federal grand jury in Greenville,
S.C., on charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, false

identification documents and aggravated identity
theft.
Reed used sophisticated scams to steal identi
ties she used to gain entrance to California State
University at Fullerton, Harvard and Columbia
University, where she studied criminology and
psychology, investigators said.
Reed also used the stolen identities to obtain
more than $100,000 in student loans, according to
the Secret Service.
She attended Columbia for two years as a
graduate student under the name Brooke Henson
before investigators discovered her identity was
false, the Secret Service said. The real Henson, of
Travelers Rest, S.C., has been missing since 1999.,
but investigators have said they do not believe
Reed had anything to do with Henson's disap
pearance.
Wiley did not know when Reed would next
appear in court.
