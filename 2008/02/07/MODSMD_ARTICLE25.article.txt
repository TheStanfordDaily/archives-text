LAFAYETTE, Tenn. â€” One man
pulled a couch over his head. Bank
employees rushed into the vault. A
woman trembled in her bathroom,
clinging to her dogs. College students
huddled in dormitories.
Tornado warnings had been
broadcast for hours, and when the
sirens finally announced that the
twisters had arrived, many people
across the South took shelter and
saved their lives. But others simply
had nowhere safe to go, or the storms
proved too powerful, too numerous,
too unpredictable.
At least 55 people were killed and
hundreds injured Tuesday and
Wednesday by dozens of tornadoes
that plowed across Mississippi,
Arkansas, Tennessee. Kentucky and
Alabama. It was the nation's dead

liest barrage of twisters in almost 23
years.
"We had a beautiful neighbor
hood. Now it's hell," said Bonnie
Brawner, 80, who lives in Hartsville, a
community about an hour from
Nashville where a natural gas plant
that was struck by a twister erupted in
spectacular flames up to 400 feet
high.
The storms flattened entire
blocks, smashed warehouses and sent
tractor-trailers flying. Houses were
reduced to splintered piles of lumber.
Some looked like life-size dollhouses,
their walls sheared away. Crews
going door to door to search for bod
ies had to contend with downed
power lines, snapped trees and
flipped cars. Cattle wandered
through the debris near hard-hit
Lafayette (pronounced luh-FAY-et).
At least 12 people died in and around
the town.

"It looks like the Lord took a
Brillo pad and scrubbed the ground,"
said Tennessee Ciov. Phil Bredesen,
who surveyed the damage from a hel
icopter.
Hundreds of houses were dam
aged or destroyed. Authorities had no
immediate cost estimate of the dam
age.
President Bush gave assurances
his administration stood ready to
help. Teams from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
were sent to the region and activated
an emergency center in Georgia.
"Loss of life, loss of property;
prayers can help, and so can the gov
ernment," Bush said. "I do want the
people in those states to know the
American people are standing with
them."
Students took cover in dormitory
bathrooms as the storms closed in on
Union University in Jackson, Tenn.

More than 20 students at the
Southern Baptist school were
trapped behind wreckage and
jammed doors after the dormitories
came down around them.
Danny Song was pinned for an
hour and a half until rescuers dug him
from the rubble.
"We looked up and saw the funnel
coming in. We started running and
then glass just exploded," he said. "1
hit the floor and a couch was shoved
up against me. which may have saved
my life because the roof fell on top of
it."
With five minutes' warning from
TV news reports. Nova and Ray Story
huddled inside their home outside
Lafayette and came out unscathed.
But nearby, their uncle. Bill Clark,
was injured in his toppled mobile
home.
They put him in the bed of their
pickup to take him to a hospital, and

neighbors with chain saws tried to
clear a path. What normally would
have been a 30-minute drive to the
hospital took well more than two
hours because the roads were clogged
with debris. Clark died on the way.
"He never had a chance," Nova
Story said."! looked him right in the
eye and he died right there in front of
me."
Most communities had ample
warning that the storms were coming.
Forecasters had warned for days
severe weather was possible. The
National Weather Service issued
more than I,(XX) tornado warnings
from 3 p.m. TUesday to 6 a.m.
Wednesday in the 11-state area where
the weather was heading.
The conditions for bad weather
had lined up so perfectly that the
Storm Prediction Center in Norman.
Okla., put out an alert six days in
advance.
