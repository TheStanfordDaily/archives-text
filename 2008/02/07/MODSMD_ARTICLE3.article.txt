## Men hunting for 20th win

Nine, 20,18,12,16,11, one.
No, those aren't your fortune cookie's lucky lotto numbers,
and sorry ladies, that's not my phone number either.Those are
just the seven most important figures to Stanford basketball as
it prepares to host Oregon at 7 p.m. tonight.
No. 9 is Stanford's current rank, the highest it has been since
Mike Montgomery led the 2003-04 squad to a 26-0 start. Hie
reason Stanford has moved into the Beverly Hills of the college
basketball landscape is because it has won five straight in the
Pac-10, with its latest victory the most impressive to date — a
67-65 overtime thriller at then-No. 5 Washington State. But
frankly, coach Trent Johnson is just afraid his team is going to
lose its head amidst the hype.
"What you have to understand is that there's probably two
guys in that locker room that have experienced something like
[a top-10 ranking], and that's me and [assistant coach] Doug
Oliver," he said."But what I told them is nothing changes. How
did we get there? You have to work and think about getting bet
ter. They have to trust through facts and experience [that] this is
how it works, not what their girlfriend or their mom says."
20 wins is evidence of a solid season in major college basket
ball. a mark Stanford also has not hit since that 2003-04 season.
ITie Cardinal (18-3,7-2 Pac-10) will reach that coveted 20-win
mark with a sweep this weekend. Already, Stanford has
matched the 18 wins it posted last season and in 2004-05, its
bests under Johnson. If you put Oregon State (6-15,0-9 Pac-10)
in the gimme column, the matchup with the Ducks will deter
mine whether Lawrence I lill will have to wait until next week
end against Arizona and Arizona State to achieve his lofty goal.
"I've always wanted a 20-win season." Hill said. "I always

NOTES: The No. 9 Cardinal will have a
shot at revenge against the Ducks
tonight, after falling in Oregon, 71-66,
earlier this season, one of just three
Stanford losses on the season. The
Ducks will look to pressure the Stanford
perimeter with their quickness, with
guard Tajuan Porter averaging 13.7
points per game and a team best 46
three-pointers. A sweep of this week
end's action against Oregon and Ore
gon state would give Stanford its first 20
win season since 2003-04.

NOILS; The No. 6 Stanford women will face the Ducks tonight as they
fight to stay in the race for a Fbc-10 Championship. The Cardinal domi
nated the Ducks in the two teams' last meeting in an 83 49 rout, led by
Candice Wiggins' 20 points and Jillian Harmon's nine rebounds and 6
for-7 effort from the floor for 15 points. Wiggins' 2,273 career points at
Stanford is good for second all-time in the Pac-10 behind only Lisa
Leslie's career mark of 2,414.

Brook Lopez's impending decision whether or not to turn pro after the season puts added
pressure on the Cardinal to win now. Lopez has averaged 23 points in his last six games.

wanted to be in the top-10 too. hut it's being able to win games
that we want to win and should win. We still know two of our
three losses were games we should have won if we play at the
level we're supposed to."
One of the losses Hill was referring to was a November de
fensive breakdown at Siena, but the other was a Jan. 13 71-66
loss at Oregon.The Ducks closed the game on an 8-0 run. with
the smallest man making the biggest plays down the stretch.
Guard Tajuan Porter, all 5'6" of him. scored four of those final
points and 15 in the game, using his quickness to get past junior
point guard Mitch Johnson.
As Darren Collison.NicWise and now Kyle Weaver can at
test. Stanford's starting guards are too slow to stop the quick
er backcourts in this league from penetrating. Porter might get
a heavy dose of senior forward Fred Washington. Stanford's
best on-ball defender; he might get a zone defense; Trent John
son might take his chances with Mitch Johnson: or likelier yet.
we'll see a combination of all of the above. But whatever the
set-up. one question will go a long way in crowning tonight's
victor: can Stanford stop Oregon's No. 12?
"Porter for Oregon, no one's been able to take away his
lanes, take away his shots," said coach Johnson, who can't af
ford to forget either about sharpshooting guard Bryce Taylor
or slashing forward Malik Hairston.
"We've got to do a good job of keeping him to the sides of
the floor, running different guys at him and trying to wear him
down. Once a guy like that gets by you.get physical in the lane.
Once that doesn't work.go to a zone, but then they're quick to
the ball in a zone because there are free running lanes, so long
shots, long rebounds really favor a team like an Oregon."
Sixteen is for the Sweet 16.Though no one on the team will
publicly look that far ahead, winning two games in the NCAA
Tournament, which Stanford has not done since 2000-01. has
to be in the "must" category given the status of the man in the
middle.
Likely to be a lottery pick in the upcoming NBA Draft,
sophomore center Brook Lopez is averaging 23 points over
his last six games; he tallied 26 points on 10-of-16 shooting at
Oregon. Given that Lopez scored a career-high 31 points
against Washington's Jon Brockman, and that, try as Maarty
Leunen might, Oregon still lacks a true center, Stanford's No.
11 has to be licking his chops for tonight.
His team, meanwhile, has to be calm and focused for the
next two months, because the odds of reaching the Sweet 16
and beyond are better now than they will be for the foreseeable
future. The team has the second half of that equation down, but
Hill and guards Landry Fields and Anthony Goods — who
practiced this week after rolling an ankle at Washington State
and is likely to start tonight — have all pressed too hard at
times.
"1 don't want to fail." Hill said. " This is the best position
we've been in as a team since I've been here, and it only gets
harder with more and more success."
Finally, the ever elusive number one. It could be for UCLA,
the one team in this conference legitimately better than the
Cardinal, as Hill implied earlier. Stanford is also one game be
hind those Bruins (20-2, 8-1) in the Pac-10 standings, and
knows it needs to stay hot to keep up.
"Our goal is to win the Pac-10," Hill said."We really need to
win all our games to have a shot because UCLA is going to
handle their business."
But. in the first season in years that justifies dreaming of
even greater heights, perhaps one is a reminder of the ultimate
prize.
" I don't want to be No. 9 in country. I want to be higher," Hill
said. "No. 1 in the country is the team that wins whole thing."
