No, those aren't your fortune cookie's lucky lotto numbers,
and sorry ladies, that's not my phone number either.Those are
just the seven most important figures to Stanford basketball as
it prepares to host Oregon at 7 p.m. tonight.
No. 9 is Stanford's current rank, the highest it has been since
Mike Montgomery led the 2003-04 squad to a 26-0 start. Hie
reason Stanford has moved into the Beverly Hills of the college
basketball landscape is because it has won five straight in the
Pac-10, with its latest victory the most impressive to date â€” a
67-65 overtime thriller at then-No. 5 Washington State. But
frankly, coach Trent Johnson is just afraid his team is going to
lose its head amidst the hype.
"What you have to understand is that there's probably two
guys in that locker room that have experienced something like
[a top-10 ranking], and that's me and [assistant coach] Doug
Oliver," he said."But what I told them is nothing changes. How
did we get there? You have to work and think about getting bet
ter. They have to trust through facts and experience [that] this is
how it works, not what their girlfriend or their mom says."
20 wins is evidence of a solid season in major college basket
ball. a mark Stanford also has not hit since that 2003-04 season.
ITie Cardinal (18-3,7-2 Pac-10) will reach that coveted 20-win
mark with a sweep this weekend. Already, Stanford has
matched the 18 wins it posted last season and in 2004-05, its
bests under Johnson. If you put Oregon State (6-15,0-9 Pac-10)
in the gimme column, the matchup with the Ducks will deter
mine whether Lawrence I lill will have to wait until next week
end against Arizona and Arizona State to achieve his lofty goal.
"I've always wanted a 20-win season." Hill said. "I always

NOTES: The No. 9 Cardinal will have a
shot at revenge against the Ducks
tonight, after falling in Oregon, 71-66,
earlier this season, one of just three
Stanford losses on the season. The
Ducks will look to pressure the Stanford
perimeter with their quickness, with
guard Tajuan Porter averaging 13.7
points per game and a team best 46
three-pointers. A sweep of this week
end's action against Oregon and Ore
gon state would give Stanford its first 20
win season since 2003-04.

NOILS; The No. 6 Stanford women will face the Ducks tonight as they
fight to stay in the race for a Fbc-10 Championship. The Cardinal domi
nated the Ducks in the two teams' last meeting in an 83 49 rout, led by
Candice Wiggins' 20 points and Jillian Harmon's nine rebounds and 6
for-7 effort from the floor for 15 points. Wiggins' 2,273 career points at
Stanford is good for second all-time in the Pac-10 behind only Lisa
Leslie's career mark of 2,414.

Brook Lopez's impending decision whether or not to turn pro after the season puts added
pressure on the Cardinal to win now. Lopez has averaged 23 points in his last six games.
