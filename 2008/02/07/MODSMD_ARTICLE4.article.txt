# No. 9 Stanford men roll out to their best record since magical 2003-04 run
## 
### 
Still. Johnson thinks his squad could do
a better job on the boards against smaller
teams, such as tonight's opponent Oregon,
whose quickness and athleticism can beat
Stanford's big men to the ball.
"We need to clean up our rebounding,"
Johnson said,"especially this weekend."
On the other end of the court, Johnson
said he'd like to see the team take better
care of the ball and continue to get multiple
players involved offensively. Sophomore
big man Brook Lopez has dominated of
fensively of late, leading the Cardinal in
scoring in each of the last six games. Lopez
is averaging 23 points per game over that
span.
The biggest concern for the Cardinal
after the first half of the Pac-10 schedule
may be the play of junior forward
Lawrence Hill. Hill, an all-Pac-10 selection
last season who averaged 15.7 points per
game, has been up and down this year, see
ing his scoring slip to 9.2 per game.
"I don't feel comfortable yet." Hill said,
despite a strong showing (18 points, 7 re-
bounds) in Stanford's win at Wash
ington State Saturday. "I'm happy
with my defense, everything else is
doing better. It's more trying to do
things within the offense."
Hill said the team's recent spate
of success has brought more pressure
to produce.
"1 don't want to fail," he said. "As
a player, there's so much more you
need to do to get better. 'Ibis isn't
where 1 want to be. I don't want to be
ninth in the country. 1 want to be
higher."
That type of talk is sure to please
his coach, who said the team has gen
erally remained grounded despite its
surge in the polls and the correspon
ding national media attention.
"He's a very level-headed kid,"
Johnson said of Hill. "This whole
group is for the most part."
Some of Stanford's main assets

this season have been the team's ma
turity, experience and composure.
While the squad returned almost its
entire rotation from last season, it is
still a relatively young group. I"he
coach knows, despite the competi
tion and the success, that it's just a
game out there.
"These aren't pro athletes, these
are college athletes," Johnson said." I
tell them just to enjoy it."
With half of the conference sea
son. the Pac-10 tournament and a
nearly assured NCAA Tournament
berth remaining, at least one of his
players won't be resting on his lau
rels anytime soon.
"We're not trained to think about
the glory in anything." Mill said,
"until it's over."
