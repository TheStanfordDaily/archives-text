## Harbaugh NETS SOLID SECOND CLASS Football signs 17 freshmen on Cardinal letter day 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Ilic Cardinal signed 17 prospective freshmen and
one transfer student on yesterday's National Letters
of Intent Signing Day, the culmination of several
months of football recruiting across the country.
The class, ranked 50th in the nation by Rivals.com
— one of the Web's premier recruiting services —
was coach Jim Harbaugh's first complete effort at
Stanford. During a press conference yesterday, he
seemed enthused over the Cardinal's haul.
"We are building a winning culture at Stanford
and this signing class has brought us a lot of players
who know winning football," he said.
The team's biggest addition was four-star quarter
back recruit Andrew Luck, ranked the country's
fourth best prep gunslinger by Kivals.com. I lis accu
racy and arm strength are both listed as above aver
age — one of his few problems, apparently, is his re
lease, which is a time-consuming, almost over-exag
gerated flick of the wrist in addition to his regular
arm-motion. Luck is reputed to be a smart player
who demonstrates remarkable pocket poise but also
has the mobility to create plays on the run.
"He's a very strong, very tough kid," Harbaugh
said.
The Cardinal coach now heading into his second
year on the Farm said that he consulted with the late

Cardinal coach and former Athletic
Director Bill Walsh, who said that
Luck's "instincts," which are largely
un-teachable, were excellent.
Harbaugh felt that l.uck has the
ability to challenge for playing time
during camp this summer.
"There will be strong competition
at quarterback this year," he said.
Aside from Luck, the Cardinal quar
terbacking corps boasts incumbent
sophomore starter Tavita Pritchard,
freshman L.D. Crow and sophomore
Jason Forcier, who will be eligible to
play in 2008 after transferring from
Michigan before the "07 season.

"We expect
Warren to be a red
zone threat right off
the bat for us."

Another big commitment for the
Cardinal came from Delano 1 lowell.
a nationally ranked running back re
cruit that I larbaugh described as
"one of our top guys in the class."
Howell has also played defensive
back, and Harbaugh described him
as a potential "three way guy." 1 low
ell would appear to be a shifty runner
who excels in the open field. Al
though he runs hard, Howell may
need to improve his overall strength
as he is incorporated into the running
back rotation — a position decimat
ed by injuries last season.
"He has a lot of talent," Harbaugh
said."He has big dreams, and he sees
Stanford as the place to make those

dreams a reality."
"He can make all the cuts; he can
run past people; and he can block
people," said running backs coach
Willie Taggart.
The Cardinal's best offensive line
recruit was David DeCastro, ranked
as the 11th best lineman in the coun
try by Rivals.com. DeCastro can play
either center or tackle, although he
projects more as an inside player. I lis
footwork is reputedly excellent, and
although he may need to increase his
upper-body strength, Harbaugh did
not appear concerned, mentioning
that DeCastro looks bigger every
time he sees him.
"He's going to play early," Har
baugh said. "He'll be very versatile
and very valuable to us."
Stanford also signed the Reuland
brothers, Konrad and Warren. Kon
rad is a big tight end and transfer
from Notre Dame — he was highly
recruited out of high school and is
both a good pass-catcher and block
er. I le will have to sit out the first few
games of the 2008 season for eligibil
ity reasons, but should compete for
playing time afterward.
Warren is a tall wide receiver with
good hands who should factor into
the wide receiver rotation quickly
next season, as the Cardinal lost this
year's pair of seniors, Mark Bradford
and Evan Moore.
"He can run numerous routes
from the outside wide receiver posi
tion, or he can come inside and play
from the slot. We expect Warren to
be a red zone threat right off the bat
for us," said offensive coordinator
David Shaw.
Joining him there will be Chris
Owusu, another one of Harbaugh's
top recruits. A speedster who may
also run track at Stanford, Owusu
could be an immediate deep threat
for the Cardinal.
"He has a combination of size and
speed, ability to run after the catch as
well as ability to help on special
teams as either a cover man or a re
turner," Shaw said.
Harbaugh also expressed delight
over the signing of Chase Thomas, a
defensive end from Georgia who was
pursued by SEC schools. Although
he'll need to gain weight in order to
be a down-lineman in college, he al
ready possesses great pass-rushing
skills, and is versatile enough to play

linebacker.
"He is the perfect guy to play and
end. or stand up and rush off the
edge," 1 larbaugh said.
Michael Thomas, an athlete from
Texas, will also add depth to the de
fense. Thomas played quarterback in
high school, but projects as either a
wide receiver or cornerback in col
lege — Harbaugh felt he'd fit best as
a defensive back.
"He's another guy who could be a
three-way guy," he said.
The Cardinal even upgraded its
special teams by signing punter
Daniel Zychlinski. With Jay Ottove
gio graduating, Harbaugh said that

Zychlinski "has a very good chance
of being the starting punter next
year."
"We understand the game of field
position and how big a part the
punter plays in that. We feel like he is
a guy who can help us in that area "
said special teams coach D.J. Durkin.
With such an impressive class
coming in. Harbaugh was left with
nothing more than to state the obvi
ous.
"Stanford got better today," he
said. "It was a wonderful dav."
