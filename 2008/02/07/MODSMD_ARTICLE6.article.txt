# Women head to Northwest
## Card looks to stay afloat in Pac-10 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball team plays at Ore
gon tonight, looking to remain in the running for the Pae-1()
Championship.
The Cardinal (20-3, l )-2 Pacific-10 Conference) has won
both of its last two games in I ugene. ()re. against the Ducks
(10-12.4-7 Pac-10) but lost its two previous games before that
at the storied Mac Arthur Court. Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer acknowledged the special circumstances that
come with playing at Oregon.
"It's a really great trip," VanDerveer said."The crowds are
great. It has such a great tradition. We know it's a tough place
to play."
Of course, the Cardinal has its own
bit of Beaver State magic up its sleeve,
as junior forward Jillian Harmon has
demonstrated a knack for sticking it to
her home state on the court. When the
Ducks visited Stanford earlier this sea
son. Harmon shot 6-for-7 from the
field on the way to 15 points and 9 re
bounds in an 83-49 Stanford victory.
Stanford also has the advantage of
matching up its league-leading of
fense. which scores 76.6 points per
game, aga i nst Oregon's second -to-1 ast
ranked offense, which is scoring an
anemic 59 points per game. And the
Cardinal, with the league's best
turnover margin (+3.4 turnovers per
game), is sure to exploit Oregon's poor
ball handling.The Ducks are averaging
almost 20 turnovers a game while forc
ing less than 15 on average, for a Pac
-10-worst -4.8 turnover margin.
Still, the Cardinal will be looking
for heavy production from its usual
Big Three this weekend. Senior guard
Candice Wiggins scored 20 points
against the Ducks last time, although
posts Kayla Pedersen and Jayne Appel
were both held under double-digits
and will be looking to avenge those
marks this weekend.
Wiggins is leading Stanford with
18.7 points per game, with Appel (14.8
points per game) and Pedersen (12.5
points per game) close behind, provid
ing the bulk of Stanford's offense on
most nights.
Wiggins has been attacking particu
larly ruthlessly of late, averaging 23
points per game over the last five con
tests. Wiggins broke Stanford's all-time
scoring record in Stanford's win over
USC last weekend and is quickly clos
ing in on Lisa Leslie's Pac-10 confer
ence record of 2.414 career points.
The senior guard has 2,273 points in
her career.
The Cardinal is coming off a non
conference win over Santa Clara on
TUesday. While it is unusual to have
three games in a week, especially dur
ing the conference season. Stanford
coach Tara Van Derveer says that it is
not a problem for her team.

"We don't try to do it every week,"
VanDerveer said. "But we usually
have a tough practice on Hiesday. It's
better to have a game."
Stanford will follow up Thursday's

game with a match up at Oregon State
on Saturday.
