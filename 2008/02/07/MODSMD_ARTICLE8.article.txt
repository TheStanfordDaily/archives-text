## Physics building to be demolished Lab razed to make room for second Science and Engineering Quad 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
The Hanson Experimental Physics
Laboratory (HEPL) — where Nobel
Laureate Robert Hofstadter meas
ured the shapes of atomic nuclei and
where the world's first full-scale linear
accelerator was produced — will be
razed by the end of the month in order
to make way for the second Science
and Engineering Quad.
University Architect David Lenox
said the demolition of the HEPL
building is consistent with the original
campus plan developed in the
University's early years.
"The demolition of HEPL enables
Stanford to create a Science and
Engineering Quad that will become
the catalyst to re-establishing the orig
inal Stanford campus plan envisioned
by Frederick Law Olmsted," Lenox
said. "This new quad will not only
encourage and celebrate multidiscipli
narv research and education, but also
will provide that sense of place that is
so important to the Stanford tradi
tion."
The Quad will be home to the Jerry
Yang and Akiko Yamazaki
Environment and Energy Building
(Y2E2). the School of Engineering
Center, the Center for Nanoscale

Science and Technology and the
Bioengineering and Chemical
Engineering Building.
HEPL and its researchers have
already moved to new quarters in the
Physics and Astrophysics building
next door. Although they began mov
ing into the new building over a year
and a half ago, researchers said they
will keep their former facility in their
memory.
"It was a wonderful place to do
research," said Physics Prof. Bias
Cabrera, current HEPL director. "No
one cared about the architectural
niceties, and we could modify and
change the space depending on our
research. The new building will be
much more architecturally attractive."
But Cabrera acknowledged that
leaving the old building has its draw
backs.
"Being in the old building had its
advantages," he said. "Nobody cared if
you punched a hole in the wall."
Completed in the aftermath of
World War II nearly sixty years ago,
HEPL was made entirely of concrete
and cinder block as a temporary
building with science in mind.
"The building was very much built
for a particular application, not for
architectural niceness," Cabrera said.
"It was verv much a research entity."

"It is outdated, but in a nice way,"
added Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer. who served as director of HEPL
from 1997 to 2(X)6. "Now it's in the
wrong place late in its lifetime."
Despite the banal architectural
style, the building saw its share of
Stanford history. In addition to hous

ing the predecessor to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, the HEPL build
ing also paved the way for govern
ment-sponsored research on campus
by being the first building constructed
specifically for that purpose in the
aftermath of World War 11.
"When the HEPL Building was

completed in 1949, it was constructed
almost as a temporary building
because nobody knew whether this
brand new thing — government
sponsored research — would last,"
Byer said.
He added that the first medical use
of radiation came out of HEPL. In the

1950s researchers were successful in
treating cancer in a boy's eye.
"This lab evolved," Byer said, "and
did what was at the frontier of science
every step of the way."
