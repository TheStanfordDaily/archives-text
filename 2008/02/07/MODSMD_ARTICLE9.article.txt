## Researcher says peace possible through Facebook Social networking site facilitates worldwide demonstrations 
### BRIAN ANDREW 
On Feb. 4, millions of Colombians
marched in international rallies against
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), the country's largest
rebel group.
The idea for the worldwide protests
began with a group on Facebook.
Daniel Espinosa '09 first became aware
of the group's existence when it appeared
in his Newsfeed shortly after its inception
in early January. Espinosa, originally from
Cartagena, Colombia, decided to contact
the head of the anti-FARC protest in San
Francisco to see if he could help make
signs and banners for the rally. He also
called his mother in Cartagena the next
day to see if she would help a friend who
was organizing a similar protest in his
hometown.
"In Colombia, not everyone has access
to a computer," Espinosa said. "But the
students got excited and got everyone else
involved."
While only about 715.CKX) Colombians

are cur
rently on

Facebook, an
estimated 4.8
million peo-

ple participated

in the country's rallies.

Espinosa said the large

turnout was the result of

Colombians' near-universal

hatred of FARC and the trans-

parency in the planning process on

Facebook, which served as a launching pad
for the rallies.

"It was not possible without the use of
Facebook to organize the ideas [for the
rally]," he said. "You also know it wasn't
one or two people contributing ideas but a
whole bunch of people. It was very demo
cratic."
The event came as no surprise to B.J.
Fogg '95 Ph.D. '97, director of the
Persuasive Technology Lab. He believes
that relationships formed on social net
working sites have the ability to persuade
millions of people to get involved in move

ments by taking one-on-one personal rela
tionships and putting them onto a mass
scale. According to Fogg, this the greatest
step forward in mass persuasion since the
advent of radio.
"Peace is possible now that we have the
tools to reach many people through the
social networking sites," Fogg said. "Mass
