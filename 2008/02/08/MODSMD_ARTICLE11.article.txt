McCain all but clinches GOP nomination
WASHINGTON (AP) — John McCain sought to
mend his tattered relationship with conservatives
and unify a splintered GOP as he all but clinched
the party's presidential nomination Thursday.
Mitt Romney, his former chief rival, dropped out,
and a parade of prominent Republicans swung
behind the Arizona senator.
"We're continuing campaigning and not taking
anything for granted," McCain said in an Associ
ated Press interview, still reluctant to call himself
anything more than the front-runner. "I certainly
think that we have enhanced our chances."
Only Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul remained
in what has been a crowded and wide-open nomi
nation fight for the past year. Both have narrow
voting constituencies and are far behind in the
hunt for delegates to the GOP's nominating con
vention this summer.
Romney's departure left McCain, whose inde
pendent streak rankles many in the Republican
rank-and-file, poised to assume President Bush's
position as the party standard-bearer. It was a re
markable turnaround for McCain, whose cam
paign was barely alive last summer, out of cash
and losing staff.
"It is my sincere hope that even if you believe
I have occasionally erred in my reasoning as a fel
low conservative, you will still allow that I have, in
many ways important to all of us, maintained the
record of a conservative," McCain told a gather
ing of the party's influential right flank on Thurs
day a few hours after Romney appeared before
the same group to announce he was suspending
his faltering bid.
Said Romney, "I must now stand aside, for our
party and our country.
"If I fight on in my campaign, all the way to the
convention. I would forestall the launch of a na-

"Are all the black
marks on people's
foreheads because /

California?" J

tional campaign and make it more likely that Se
nator (Hillary Rodham) Clinton or (Barack)
Obama would win."
Romney's fate had been virtually sealed earli
er this week when he failed to stop McCain's
coast-to-coast Super Tuesday rout in presidential
primaries; McCain and Romney spoke by phone
Thursday but no endorsement was sought nor of
fered.
Experts say Iran has started testing
centrifuge for uranium enrichment
VIENNA. Austria (AP) — Iran's nuclear project
has developed its own version of an advanced cen
trifuge to churn out enriched uranium much faster
than its previous machines, diplomats and experts
said Thursday.
They said that few of the IR-2 centrifuges were
operating and that testing appeared to be in an
early phase, with the new machines rotating with
out processing any uranium gas.
More significant, the officials said, is the fact
that Iran appears to have used know-how and
equipment bought on the nuclear black market in
combination with domestic ingenuity to overcome
daunting technical difficulties and create highly ad
vanced centrifuges.
Iran's uranium enrichment work has raised con
cerns in Washington and other Western capitals be
cause it can produce the radioactive material need
ed for nuclear bombs. Tehran says it is only pursu
ing lower-level enrichment to make fuel for atomic
reactors that will generate electricity.
Iran is under two sets of UN. Security Council
sanctions for refusing to suspend uranium enrich
ment, which it started developing during nearly
two decades of covert nuclear activity built on illic
it purchases and revealed only five years ago.
