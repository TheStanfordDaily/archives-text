# Rumsfeld, housing dominate faculty meeting
## 
### NATHANIEL EISEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The heated debate over Donald
Rumsfeld's appointment as a distin
guished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution continued at
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting,
as members backed plans to form a
committee that will overview similar
appointments.
The Senate voted unanimously to
adopt a resolution establishing a
Committee on the Professoriate that
will "examine consistency in
appointment processes at Stanford
affiliated institutes and report back
to the Faculty Senate."
"1 think the Senate took the
issue, raised initially by the hiring of
Donald Rumsfeld, seriously, and
identified a possible loophole that
allows for the potential appointment
or title of someone without proper

vetting," said Medical School Prof.
David Spiegel, one of the faculty
members who introduced the reso
lution.
In addition. Bob Reidy, vice
provost of Lands. Buildings and
Real Estate, and Jan Thomson,
director of Faculty Staff Housing,
reported on three active projects in
housing: the Munger graduate resi
dences, the Olmstead staff rental
houses and Stanford Avenue faculty
housing.
Graduate Student Council
Representative Adam Beberg
raised the issue of affordable gradu
ate housing — once Munger is built,
lower-cost housing in Crothers will
no longer be available to graduate
students.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 said that the University will
reduce the price of aging houses to
compensate.

"Three to four bed
room homes 50
percent below
current prices: sign
me up."
DIANE BAILEY,
MS&E Prof.
The Olmstead project, which will
be located between El Camino Real
and Escondido Village, will include a
childcare center and 22 three-story
units on three acres.

The Stanford Avenue housing
will include 39 single detached fami
ly homes on 6.72 acres currently
between Escondido Village and
Stanford Avenue. Plans are being
made to divert water below the
ditch that is currently in this loca
tion.
Thomson and Reidy said that,
with current market conditions, it
was estimated that the homes would
cost 50 percent below current mar
ket price.
"Three to four bedroom homes
50 percent below current prices."
said Management Science and
Engineering Assistant Prof. Diane
Bailey. "Sign me up."
Spiegel also reported on the
Stanford Cancer Center's
Developmental Research Awards.
The Center is offering $50,000
research grants to faculty who do
not work in the Cancer Center, but
whose work contributes to the fight
against cancer.
