## Editorial Board Revamp the CDC Web site 
### 
A college education — it prepares
you for the life ahead. It provides
you with an invaluable skill set. can
lead to amazing opportunities to make a
real change in the world and helps spring
board you into the world of internships,
jobs and even careers. At Stanford this
springboard is the Career Development
Center (CDC), and, in our digital age, the
most frequented of their resources is the
online job database. Instead of accelerating
our leap forward, however, the CDC's oft
impenetrable Web resource often leaves us
flat-footed.
The formatting of the Web site's soft
ware is lacking. When searching for jobs and
internships, students usually have limiting
criteria in mind — they know what field
they might like, cities where they might
want to live, the names of a few companies
they find interesting. The CDC Web site,
however, does not allow students to pursue
positions using these filters. The Advanced
Search function does allow searches under
Job Function, but it only narrows what kind
of work you'd like. It does not allow search
es by firm or business and its geographic
breakdowns are only by state or country.
The Advanced Search function also pro
vides a host of completely superfluous
search agents. Do you care if the search is
for Cardinal Recruiting Interviews or Ca
reer Fair Postings? Do you want a job that
requires less than 40 percent travel? Be as
precise as you want because you can choose
the amount of travel you'd endure to within
10 percent increments.
If you become tired with the search
agents, there's always the Keywords search.
Quite astonishingly, however, the more
specific your search, the more hits you get

— if you were to type in "sales" you would
find fewer jobs than if you were to type in
"sales manager." The Web site manages to
return all postings that have the word
"sales" in them and all the postings that
have "manager" in them, instead of, more
intuitively, returning only those postings
that have both "sales" and "manager." For
those who know exactly what job they want
to search for and find on the CDC Web site,
this particular characteristic can be frus
trating.
The software company that supports
Stanford's CDC Web site and many other
career Web sites around the country is,
rather ironically, called Symplicity. While
their homepage is a decently formatted
Web site and their short list of clients is
rather impressive, students around the
country could have a much more benefi
cial recruiting experience. One of Symplic
ity's self-professed comparative advan
tages is its focus on clients — the company
promises to provide on-going personal
ized support. As clients, we are asking for
this personalized support, along with some
major improvements to the product.
Perhaps Stanford's own Computer Sci
ence department, which has produced
some of the best software developers in
the nation, could help refocus and rebuild
the CDC's on-line job searching tools.
Stanford's Courseßank Web site is a won
derfully easy to use online resource and is
a vast improvement upon the previous on
line resources students used to search for
courses. As spring quarter looms and sen
iors start to plan for the future, there is no
better time to pay attention to our career
Web site and to make needed improve
ments.
