## The
						tragic story of Bernhardt Eichmann Helmut 
### 
Hello, my name is Bernhardt Eich
mann Helmut, and today 1 wish to
tell for you my sad life story. I should
note that before I start, mine is a story of ig
norance, shame and abandonment. My story
is not for the weak of heart. 1 am a downtrod
den man with no outlet but a university
newspaper.
Perhaps 1 should begin, as all life stories
do, with the sad fact of my birth. It was the
winter of 1975, and a diminutive East Ger
man boy with few prospects and even fewer
lederhosen was conceived from the union of
two bicycle mechanics in East Berlin's lower
western east side.
Despite my circumstances. I worked duti
fully in my studies and received top marks in
East Berlin's only schoolhouse. In my spare
time, 1 took the job of hall monitor and
watched carefully over my school's only
hallway.
I was well received in these years. My
friends did not tease me, and I felt as one
feels when he is wanted. I remember one
particular instance of good will in which a
school mate expressed his appreciation of
my hall monitoring duties: "Hall Monitor
Helmut, the world will be safer with you
around."
My eyes welled with tears at this honest
affirmation of my place in this world. And
from that moment forward. Hall Monitor
Helmut became a dedicated public servant.
I took to manning street corners, directing
traffic and volunteering with our local fire
brigade.
All this time, however, there ached with
in me a desire to see the world at large. East
Berlin's lower western east side was only so
big, and my potential to bring about a safer
world was thus curtailed by geographical
limits. It is for this reason that I stowed away
on an ocean liner bound for America, surviv
ing on the scattered remains of bags of corn
and millet in the ship's storehouse.
When I arrived on the golden shores of
America, a glimmer of hope shining in my
eager eyes, I was forced to accept a harsh re
ality. My first memory of this country is of
standing in the unending lines of Ellis Island,
staring into the unforgiving eyes of an immi
gration official hell-bent on changing my
birth name. Finding "Bernhardt" cumber
some, the official shortened it to the single
letter B. And finding Eichmann too Ger
man, I became "Ike."
From then on. I was to be B. Helmut, and

for convenience reasons, I was to go by my
middle name, now the foreign sounding
"Ike". Why dwell on this name? Why dwell
on any name, if not for the memories of one's
roots? It was a reminder of a time when I
was respected — loved, even — by a popu
lace who knew I was there to help them.
Not so, as an alien in America. From the
outset, I felt awkward and somewhat dorky,
as they say. I was far from fashionable, and it
was quite obvious that I was what they call
uncool.
Neglect, they say.This was one of the first
words 1 learned in America. In America, no
one appreciates a dedicated public servant,
one looking out for their safety. Since I ar
rived in America, my earnest attempts to
help have been repeatedly turned down, in
favor of some abstract notion of personal
liberty, or worse, coolness.
And here I stand. After an awkward col
lege experience, I have found myself on the
other coast, the American West, working
long hard hours as a graduate student at
Stanford University and majoring in safety
engineering.
And I must say, gone are the days of my
near universal social acceptance. Hall Moni
tor Helmut, in all of his respectable splen
dor, has become graduate student B. "Ike"
Helmut, gauche and unwelcome. On the
whole. 1 am very unpopular at Stanford. My
sole friends are those in the graduate school
community, and, in general, Stanford profes
sors.
I know I could help them. I know that if
they gave me the chance, 1 could make them
safe. But for now. I must be content within
my small sphere of influence. Perhaps one
day, those wise words from my schoolmate
friend will come true. But until then, I live
out my days as the lowly B. Ike Helmut of
Stanford University.
