Unlike most of my fellow Facebookers,
hut very much like most of my fellow
Democrats in the three states I've
called home (NJ. MA. CA), 1 voted for
Hillary Clinton last Tuesday. I instinctively
flinch as 1 write this. Over the past few
months, 1 have grown accustomed to affect
ing sheepishness as a defense mechanism
against my seemingly overpowering, rabidly
anti-Hillary peers. Well, enough already. I'm
tired of apologizing that 1 support a state-pri
mary-winning, New York limes-endorsed
candidate who is nearly equivalent on issues
(albeit slightly better, in my opinion) to
everyone else's golden boy.
"Well," I'm told,"this election is not about
issues." But this is a dire mistake. I know, I
know - issues are boring, issues are divisive,
issues are specific and dry and not well suited
to inspiring, hand-waving speeches and
catchy pop songs. (Or maybe the Black Eyed
Peas' next hit single will explain how univer
sal healthcare might be achieved?) But let
me remind everyone that once the election is
won and the inaugural address is given, it will
be time for the rolling up of sleeves and get
ting to work part of the job. Thankfully, most
of the current contenders can roll up their
sleeves a thousand times better than our cur
rent Oval Office occupant, but how they get
to work unavoidably depends on their posi
tions.
Would they appoint Supreme Court Jus
tices who would uphold or overturn Roe v.
Wade? What kind of exit strategy would they
enact in Iraq,or would they choose to remain
at war indefinitely? Would congressional tax
increases in support of federal programs be
signed or vetoed? What about global warm
ing? Education? International relations?
The economy?
These aren't crazy, barely relevant, litmus
test types of questions. These are the ques
tions whose answers comprise the nuts and

bolts of what an administration might
achieve. These are also the questions that de
cide how our lives are personally affected by
our government. And surely, most of us feel
relatively strongly as to how these questions
should be addressed.
Luckily for me, the two potential Democ
ratic nominees answer most of these ques
tions more or less identically, in a way that is
satisfactorily close to how 1 feel myself. Al
though 1 prefer Clinton for her greater body
of experience, expertise and proven compe
tence, I would happily vote for Obama in No
vember as well because I think he would also
make the right decisions for our country.
Inhere is a vast asymmetry in the Democ
ratic electorate, however. While Obama him
self is as friendly and professional as one can
be in the midst of an epic, tooth-and-nail
competition, his supporters abhor his oppo
nent to degrees normally reserved for con
firmed mortal enemies like Dick Cheney.
Why so much hate? 1 am told that Hillary
represents the old, broken, divisive ways of
"politics of the past" and that she upholds the
tired status quo of red state v. blue state op
position.
Obviously. 1 disagree, and I even find this
ironic. Obama's campaign, ostensibly about
change, hope and unity, defines itself mostly
by negative statements about the past." Young
people don't want to be locked for the rest of
their lives into a stale and outdated political
system. Young people want something new.
they want something better." said Debashish

Bakshi, the Stanford chapter coordinator of
Students for Barack Obama, in a Daily article
last week. 1 get that the past sucks, and 1 kind
of get why, hut I still have no idea what some
thing new and better might be.
But that's okay. I'm willing to take that
leap of faith if Obama is the nominee, be
cause unity or no unity, 1 like his positions.
Meanwhile, many of my Obama-supporting
friends tell me that if Hillary wins, they will
vote for John McCain. This appalls me! 1 un
derstand that they're sick of red and blue
states, and that they are looking for someone
with integrity and conviction. But really, red
and blue states don't just exist out of irra
tional odium â€” there is genuine disagree
ment in this country about, yes, issues. The
red states aren't going to magically turn blue
in an Obama-run country, no matter how
magical his oration skills may be, and 1 hope
to god the blue states aren't willing to go red.
Incase it isn't clear,McCain would,with utter
integrity and conviction, enact red state-ori
ented policies that are directly at odds with
Obama's.
It is heartening to witness my fellow
young people so politically engaged. They
are attending rallies, making YouTUbe clips,
adding the Obama Facebook application and
in some cases, even voting (although I've
read that Obamagirl, music video star, didn't
manage to make it to the polls). If you love
Obama's message, wonderful. But check out
his positions, too. They are what will really
make a difference, and they are also what
unite him with Hillary. Yes, we really can
change the United States for the better, and
no matter the result of the primary, your en
thusiasm need not wane.

Caitlin is looking forward to the rest of an excit
ing primary season and a historic election in
November, and hopes you are too. Send your
