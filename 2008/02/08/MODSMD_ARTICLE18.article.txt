## Post-grad housing not likely on campus 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several universities are consid
ering constructing housing facilities
on their campuses — not for stu
dents. but for recent graduates. But
with Stanford's increasingly tight
housing crunch, matching these
plans appears to be a distant reali
ty.
I he effort comes in response to
student concerns that their only
choices for living arrangements
after college are to either move in
with their parents again or to move
far away from campus where
apartments are cheap and avail
able.
lhe University of Pennsylvania
announced plans to build 295 on
campus apartments both for those
affiliated with the University and
the public, while the University of
Connecticut has similar plans at its
Storrs campus. Furthermore, two
colleges in British Columbia, the
University of British Columbia and
Simon Fraser University, have built
extensive retail and housing devel
opments on campus.
These developments raise ques
tions regarding whether similar
plans would be appropriate for the
Stanford campus, especially given
the high cost of housing in Palo
Alto.
Imogen Hinds, associate direc
tor of Student 1 lousing, explained
that the department's highest pri
ority is providing on-campus hous
ing for Stanford students and, as a
result, it does not have plans to cre
ate additional housing for non-stu
dents.
"(Student Housing is] chal
lenged with finding enough bed
spaces to accommodate all of the
Stanford students that would like

to live on campus during certain
quarters of the year." she said. "We
have had to convert various non
traditional spaces into student
rooms and, based on equity stan
dards. up-rate some student rooms
to allow for an additional resident."
Hinds said that the only post
four-year-stay option for Stanford
students is a "graduation quarter."
I"his allows undergraduate and
graduate students to live in housing
for one additional quarter after
graduation, provided that there is
available space.
Alif Khalfan 'OX said that he
plans to stay in the Bay Area
because of opportunities available
to him as a Computer Science
major. He felt that the price of
housing was an issue that he simply
had to contend with.
"Even though it is expensive,
you have no other choice than to
accept the fact that it will be expen
sive," he said. "It is a fact of life."
He added that if there was
cheaper housing available on cam
pus. he would probably take advan
tage of it.
"If the University constructs
apartment complexes that are
cheaper than housing outside cam
pus. people would jump on it. par
ticularly if it was restricted to
Stanford students," Khalfan said.
However, even though some
students feel that finding housing
after graduation is a concern,
1 finds stated that historically, hous
ing needs for graduating seniors
have not been an issue.
"We have not heard of any
additional need for housing," she
said, "beyond a 'graduation quar
ter.' from students in the past."
