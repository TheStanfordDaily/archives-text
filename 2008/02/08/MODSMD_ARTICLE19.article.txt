## House aims to curb college costs 
### NANCY ZUCKERBROD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€” The
House approved legislation
Thursday aimed at curtailing rising
college costs and limiting student
debt.
The bill, which passed 354-58,
calls on the Education
Department to create a Web site
that students and their families
can use to compare the cost of
attending different schools.
Colleges are to be grouped
according to how expensive they
are and how quickly their costs
have been going up.
Schools with rapidly rising
prices will have to explain what's
behind the increases and how they
will be addressed.
"The bill will create a higher
education system that is more
affordable and fairer and easier to
navigate," said Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., who chairs the
House education committee.
Democrats and Republicans
say the bill, similar to one
approved by the Senate, is needed
because college costs have been
rising faster than inflation.
Average annual tuition and
fees for in-state students at public
four-year colleges and universities
total about $6,200 this year. The
price is about $23,700 at private
four-year colleges and universi
ties. Public two-year colleges run
about $2,360 on average.
The bill seeks to prevent states
from reducing what they spend on
student aid. States could lose fed
eral money if they make such cuts.
That generated some criticism
during debate on the House floor.
"It is wrong to tell states how
they will appropriate their

money," said Rep. Rob Bishop, R-
Utah, echoing the sentiment of the
National Governors Association.
Supporters of the provision say
it is needed to keep aid levels up
because states often cut student
assistance during tight budget
times.
"To solve the college-cost crisis,
we're empowering consumers with
meaningful information about col
lege costs and holding institutions
and states accountable for keeping
higher education affordable," said
California Rep. Buck McKeon.the
top Republican on the education
committee.
The bill also would expand fed
eral Pell Grants to summer-school
students and would address con
flicts of interest in the student
lending industry that were high
lighted last year by New York
Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo.
Cuomo, in a statement late
Thursday, applauded the bill's
inclusion of reform and code of
conduct provisions regarding the
student loan industry.
"It is vital that these reforms be
sent to the president's desk as
soon as possible," Cuomo said.
"Students and their families have
paid a high price for the corrup
tion in the student loan industry
and deserve nothing less than
these long-awaited reforms."
Under the bill, colleges would
have to disclose relationships they
have with lenders. The bill also
bans gifts and profit-sharing
agreements between colleges and
banks that issue federally backed
student loans or private loans,
which don't come with a federal
subsidy or guarantee.
Students increasingly have
been turning to private loans.

which generally cost more than
those that are federally subsi
dized. Students sometimes seek
private loans when they are
unaware of other options or have
maxed out on federal assistance.
The bill requires banks issuing
private loans to inform borrowers
about federal options. It also tries
to make sure financial aid officers
at schools know about all the
loans students are taking out. The
idea is to enable such officials to
better guide students in making
good financial decisions.
The legislation seeks to stream
line how students get financial aid
by creating a new, shorter finan
cial aid application form for low
income families.
Students may spend less than
the estimated $900 they now
spend on textbooks each year if
the bill becomes law. It would
require publishers to sell text
books without bundling them with
workbooks, DVDs or other prod
ucts that drive up prices.
The bill also requires publish
ers to disclose how much text
books cost when selling them to
school officials. Faculty members
don't always seek out price infor
mation when pairing books with
courses, and publishers aren't usu
ally up front with the information,
said Luke Swarthout of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group,
which lobbies for student aid.
"It sounds silly," Swarthout
said. "Who sells products without
price tags? Textbook publishers."
The House and Senate bills
would have to be merged. The
Bush administration is opposed to
some provisions in the House bill,
including one that limits the
Education Department's role in
accrediting universities.
