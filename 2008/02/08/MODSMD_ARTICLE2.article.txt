# BOSP alters application
## New process gives students two tries to apply for overseas programs 
### KATHERINE COX SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students applying to go abroad
next fall will have two tries to match
with one of the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) centers.
BOSP has added a second round to
the application process for all of its
centers abroad. According to BOSP
administrators, both student feedback
and internal assessments led to the
change.
BOSP Student Relations Specialist
Lee Dukes said that the new format
represents an improvement "not only
from a reviewer's standpoint, but also
from the student's [standpoint]."
He claim* tint, with the notifica
tion time between rounds, students
can regroup and target applications
more effect;. ely.
Students applying this quarter
were the first group affected by the
new system. The results for this pre
liminary round of applications — in

which students made a pitch for one
center only — will he sent by email
today.
With the new process, there may be
fewer students despairing at their
wait-listed status. They now have the
option of applying for one additional
center in a second wave of submis
sions. Even those who gain acceptance
to their desired program in round one
may subsequently apply to a second
program without forfeiting their place
in the first. If a student is accepted to
the second center, however, they must
decline one offer by the end of the
quarter. Dukes said.
"They can't hold down spots in two
programs," he added.
Late-comers will also benefit from
the modified timeline.
"You can jump in the second round
and start applying then," Dukes said.
"Obviously, we're interested in finding
a spot for every student."
In quarters past, students faced one
deadline and the option to apply to up

to three of the program's 11 centers.
Though the old system allows students
to hedge their bets with multiple
applications, BOSP contends that the
new process will do a better job of dis
tributing applicants among the cen
ters.
Dukes reported that the new stipula
tion that students apply to one center
per round has already influenced the
quality of applications. Formerly, he
said, students struggled to complete
three applications simultaneously,
which often compromised the quality
of their first-ranked essay.
Moreover, Dukes claimed, the new
system is more transparent and forgiv
ing for students.
"We tell them if they've been wait
listed for the first round and give them
advice on where to apply for the sec
ond one," he said.
In this vein, BOSP will inform stu
dents about the length of their waiting
list, which could influence their
decision to apply elsewhere by the
second deadline. Dukes also
observed that soliciting feedback
from BOSP advisors in between
rounds could be a strategy for wait
listed students seeking an accept
ance in the second session.
Although she agrees that this
might resolve issues that handicap
students' applications, Emily Finley
TO, who applied to Berlin this
quarter, compared this rationale to
taking the SAT over and over to
improve upon a naturally low
score.
"It's as if you can just tweak
your application to get in as
opposed to actually highlighting
something about yourself that's
interesting," Finley said.
Finley said she would have pre
ferred to apply under the old rules
because she thinks the staggered
process actually reduces the chance
that she'll get her second or third

choice in the case that she is wait
listed for Berlin.
The opportunity to reapply in
the dual-round system would be
desirable "if you knew that all the
popular places weren't going to fill
up anyway," she added.
The BOSP Web site has
announced that it will not accept
applications in the second round to
the centers in Madrid, Oxford or
Australia due to lack of space.
Oxford and Australia are typically
highly competitive, while the brand
new Madrid program was also
expected to fill up.
BOSP Head Student Advisor
Leigh Biddlecome '08, who inter
faces with prospective applicants,
was surprised at the level of stress
among students who were applying
or even deciding whether to apply.
"It's so weird — I had no idea
there is such anxiety," Biddlecome
said. "People would come up to me
and as soon as they found out that
1 went to Oxford, they [asked]
'what did you write in your person
al statement?'"
