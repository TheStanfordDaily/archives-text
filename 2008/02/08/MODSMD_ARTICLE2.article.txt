# BOSP alters application
## New process gives students two tries to apply for overseas programs 
### KATHERINE COX SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students applying to go abroad
next fall will have two tries to match
with one of the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) centers.
BOSP has added a second round to
the application process for all of its
centers abroad. According to BOSP
administrators, both student feedback
and internal assessments led to the
change.
BOSP Student Relations Specialist
Lee Dukes said that the new format
represents an improvement "not only
from a reviewer's standpoint, but also
from the student's [standpoint]."
He claim* tint, with the notifica
tion time between rounds, students
can regroup and target applications
more effect;. ely.
Students applying this quarter
were the first group affected by the
new system. The results for this pre
liminary round of applications — in

which students made a pitch for one
center only — will he sent by email
today.
With the new process, there may be
fewer students despairing at their
wait-listed status. They now have the
option of applying for one additional
center in a second wave of submis
sions. Even those who gain acceptance
to their desired program in round one
may subsequently apply to a second
program without forfeiting their place
in the first. If a student is accepted to
the second center, however, they must
decline one offer by the end of the
quarter. Dukes said.
"They can't hold down spots in two
programs," he added.
Late-comers will also benefit from
the modified timeline.
"You can jump in the second round
and start applying then," Dukes said.
"Obviously, we're interested in finding
a spot for every student."
In quarters past, students faced one
deadline and the option to apply to up

to three of the program's 11 centers.
Though the old system allows students
to hedge their bets with multiple
applications, BOSP contends that the
new process will do a better job of dis
tributing applicants among the cen
ters.
Dukes reported that the new stipula
tion that students apply to one center
per round has already influenced the
quality of applications. Formerly, he
said, students struggled to complete
three applications simultaneously,
which often compromised the quality
of their first-ranked essay.
Moreover, Dukes claimed, the new
system is more transparent and forgiv
ing for students.
"We tell them if they've been wait
listed for the first round and give them
advice on where to apply for the sec
ond one," he said.
In this vein, BOSP will inform stu
dents about the length of their waiting
