## Armitage speaks on foreign policy 
### MIMA MOHAMMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kresge Auditorium was virtually
empty last night as the former
Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage spoke about the current
state of foreign policy. Armitage,
who served as second-in-command
of the State Department from 2001
to 2005, gave his perspective on the
world today before a small audience
of about 50 students and faculty.
In recent years, Armitage made
headlines for allegedly outing the
identity of CIA officer Valerie
Plame, to which he admitted in
2006.
Armitage told the audience that
he believed that the United States
will continue to be the only super
power. saying that China and the
European Union would not fulfill
that role.
But he also added that, for the
21st Century, the world's center of
gravity is shifting to Asia.
"Six out of ten of the world's
largest GDPs, including the U.S., are
in Asia," Armitage said. "56 percent
of the world's population is in
Asia.".
In his discussion of Asia,
Armitage addressed the long-term
implications of the tremendous eco
nomic growth in China. He
described the growth as a "redevel
opment of China, not a rise of
China."
Armitage highlighted that China
has enjoyed doubled economic and
military growth, but said that it is
uncertain where such rapid rates of
development will actually lead.
"They have a man in space and
they are going to host the Olympics
— they are about to take their place
on the world stage," Armitage said.
There is a good and bad side,
however, to the expansion of China,
he insisted. For example, the U.S.
does not approve of China doing
business in Darfur while the geno
cide is ongoing, and China's rela
tionship with Venezuela is also a
cause for concern.
Armitage also pointed out that
the amount of pollution coming
from China is enormous.
"China no longer lists deaths
from air pollution or people with
respiratory problems." Armitage
said.
Armitage questioned what the
ideal democracy actually means,
and he said that it is more than a
vote. He believes the current
administration is wrong if it uses
that as its marker because voting is
an event. There are certain condi
tions that must exist, he argued, in
order for democracy to thrive, and
even then it should not be viewed as
the end point.

"For democracy to survive," he
said, "there has to be a middle class.
Without it, democracy will fail.
Democracy is a journey."
Armitage further said he was not
opposed to invasion of Iraq, but the
U.S. should not have invaded when
it did, Additionally, there were too
few troops to achieve victory. He
said one problem is that people in
the administration were telling
President Bush that the Iraqi peo
ple were desperate for democracy.
"We thought it was a small popu
lation hungry for democracy and
they would be like Japan and
Germany," he said. "But we over
looked the fact that Iraq was not
homogenous. In addition to the fact
that Iraq was not an industrialized
economy, the system and infrastruc

ture of the country was fraught with
cronyism."
He concluded that the U.S. con
tinues to play an essential role in
world politics but said that role
depends on the image portrayed to
other nations.
" ITie world wants us to be the
indispensable nation, where our
actions jive and mix " Armitage said.
He pointed out the importance of
the U.S. having policies that match
its espoused ideals.
"We can't eschew such things as
torture and a lack of habeas corpus,"
he said. "If we strap on our tradi
tional American values, we can have
the place in affection and prestige."
