## Volleyball on the rebound No. 9 Stanford anticipates weekend rematches against UC-Santa Barbara, Cal State-Northridge 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford men's volleyball
team rounds out a four-game stint at home
this weekend against two familiar teams,
UC-Santa Barbara and Cal State-North
ridge.
The Cardinal — who is currently 7-4
overall and 3-4 in Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) play — takes on No.
13 UCSB (4-6.3-4 MPSF) today. The men
defeated UCSB 3-0 (30-28. 30-26. 30-26)
in the first meeting between the teams this
season. Jan. 25 at Santa Barbara. Last year,
the Gauchos swept the Cardinal.
On Saturday, the Cardinal is set to face

No. 6 Cal State-Northridge (6-4, 4-3
MPSF). Stanford defeated CSUN 3-1 (30-
27.30-25.28-30.32-30) in its season open
er on Jan. 4 at the Elephant Bar Tourna
ment in Santa Barbara but fell to the
Matadors in its second meeting two weeks
later at Northridge. 3-0 (30-25, 31-29, 30-
24).
After being ranked in the top-five near
the start of the season. Stanford has
dropped two spots to No. 9 in the
CSTV/AVCA poll. Brighani Young Uni
versity remains at No. 1 (9-0) while Penn
State is .H No. 2 (10-0). Long Beach State
(8-0), UCLA (8-3) and Pepperdine (5-3)
claim the rest of the top five spots.
The Cardinal will hope to carry the mo

mentum from last weekend's finale, when
it overcame a rare two-game deficit to
storm back and capture a victory against
the Ball State Cardinals. Although the
team fell to previously winless Pacific the
night before, the comeback against the
Cardinals provided a good way for the
team to bounce back.
Sophomore opposite Evan Romero
took the spotlight last weekend, racking
up 16 kills against Pacific and a career
high 34 kills against Ball State. He also
played well defensively, accumulating 15
digs on the weekend. He currently leads
the team with a whopping 169 kills on the
season.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran made

an impressive show against Ball State as
well. He came off the bench at 24-19 in the
third game and posted two straight service
aces to help secure the win. Ceran contin
ued to help the Cardinal rally back in the
subsequent games, rounding out the five
game match with 10 kills.
UCSB carries serious momentum com
ing into tonight's match, having just swept
its season series against No. 13 Hawaii. In
the last game of the series, four Gauchos
posted kills in the double digits: senior
middle blocker Theo Brunner led with 25,
freshman Jeff Menzel had 23 while senior
Phil Matthews and junior Mike Runkle
had 19 and 12, respectively. On the
other side of the ball, the team accu
mulated 40 digs.
After the series, Brunner was
named Sports Imports/AVCA Na
tional Player of the Week and
MPSF/Mol'ten Player of the Week.
CSUN is looking to rebound
after a tough weekend when it lost
to No. 1 B YU. In the last game of the
series, Northridge battled hard but
fell 2-3 (20-30,24-30,30-25,36-34,8-
15). Despite the loss, senior Isaac
Kneubuhl had a career-high 22 kills
at a .364 hitting percentage. Fresh
man Cody Loe wasn't far behind,
posting a career-high 20 kills at a
.417 hitting percentage. He also had
6 blocks.
In any case, it should be an excit
ing weekend for the Cardinal as it
looks to move up the ladder in the
MPSF standings. Both matches take
place at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
