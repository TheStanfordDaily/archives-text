# READY AS EVER
## SOFTBALL STARTS SEASON IN SAN DIEGO 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 19 Stanford softball team
opens play for the 2008 season today
when it begins competition in the
San Diego Tournament against host
University of San Diego. The Cardi
nal will play four games over the
course of the weekend, taking on
Illinois-Chicago and Long Beach
State tomorrow before concluding
the tournament on Sunday with an
other bout against Long Beach
State.

"I think we're all excited," senior
second baseman Tricia Aggabao
said. "We've been practicing since
the fall now, and it's always exciting
when you get to play someone with a
different jersey on."
Today's game against San Diego
marks the first time that the Cardi
nal has ever faced the Toreros. As a
whole, the team figures to see tough
competition throughout the week
end.

GAME NOTES : The Cardinal opens today against
♦he Toreros in hopes of improving on last year
when it advanced to the Regional Champi
onships. The women are led by pitchers Becky
McCullough and Missy Renna. On offense, the
team is anchored by sophomore outfielder Alissa
Haber, a Preseason All-America selection by

he tough," said junior pitcher Missy
Penna. "We just have to come out
strong, it doesn't matter who we
play. We expect to see some pretty
good competition, especially [for]
the first weekend out."
Despite the caliber of its oppo
nents, Stanford expects big tilings
not only this weekend, hut for the
whole year.
Picked to finish fourth in the
Pac-10 — which is easily the na
tion's best conference — the Car
dinal returns both of its starting
pitchers: Penna and senior Becky
McCullough from last year's team.
The team also welcomes a third,
freshman Ashley Chinn. who will
add depth to the rotation.
Stanford only graduated two
seniors from last season's squad,
which reached the Regional Cham
pionships; the team looks to use
that experience to its advantage
over the course of the 60-game sea
son that awaits them.
"We have five seniors this year,
and it definitely helps when you
have people who've been through
the process and know pretty much
what to expect once the season
comes," Aggabao said. "I think the
seniority on this team is going to
help us a lot in breaking in the new
freshman and also building off of
what we've had these past three
years."
In addition, the Cardinal ex
pects to see major contributions
from senior Michelle Smith at third
base and sophomore Alissa Haber
in the outfield. Smith has been All -
Pac-10 her first three years and was

an Ail-American in 2005. As a
freshman last season. I label was a
third-team Ail-American after hit
ting .365. The centerfielder has al
ready gotten positive press around
the nation — she was recently
named to the first team of
ESPN.com's Preseason Ail-Ameri
can squad. Rounding out the Card's
top returnees are junior Maddy
Coon at shortstop and sophomore
Shannon Koplitz, who figures to
see time both in the outfield and in
the infield.
This weekend's tournament in
San Diego marks the beginning of
the Cardinal's non-conference
schedule, a slate of games made up
by a number of a tournaments.
More than 20 of the team's first
games will be in tournament action;
after the San Diego Tournament,
the Cardinal will host the Stanford
Invitational I before playing in the
Palm Springs Classic, the Worth
Classic, the Stanford Classic and
the Stanford Invitational 11.
In any case, the tournament
schedule — and this weekend's
schedule in San Diego should
give Stanford a good test before
the daunting conference season
begins in late March.
"Any team we face on a given
day has the capability of beating us
if we don't bring our A-game to the
table," Aggabao said. "This week
end should be exciting in that we
get to play some pretty good teams
and we get to see how far we've
come since the fall."
After this weekend's tourna
ment in San Diego, the Cardinal
will take to the field when it hosts
St. Mary's next Wednesday at
Smith Family Stadium.
