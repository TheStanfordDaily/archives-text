BYU is currently undefeated, although they are ranked lower na
tionally than Stanford.

The Stanford men's tennis team picked up its first
win of the season on Wednesday and looks to pick up
another today against BYU. On Wednesday, the No.
40 Cardinal blanked the University of Hawaii, 7-0.
Stanford did not lose a single set in the match, im
proving its record to 1-4.
The Cardinal started the match on the right foot,
dominating in doubles play. At No. 1 doubles, junior
Blake Muller and freshman Alex Clayton defeated
Hawaii's top duo of Sascha Heineman and Andreas
Weber, 8-5. Sophomore Richard Wire and freshman
Greg Hirshman continued their strong dual match
play with a win over Dennis Lajola and Craig Faulk,
also 8-5. It was the first time Stanford won the dou
bles point in a match this year.
In singles, Stanford was led by No. 2 Clayton's win

over formerly undefeated Dennis
Lajola of Hawaii, 6-4. 6-4. Clayton
improved his record on the season to
a team-best 14-3. Wire picked up a
big win over a very talented Andreas
Weber 6-3, 7-5, while junior Matt
Bruch and Muller took straight set
wins as well. Sophomore Kevin
Kaiser and freshman Ted Kelly
added to the win total, only losing a
combined four games en route to
easy victories.
"Alex and Rich both got two good
breaks in their matches, Matt strug
gled a little bit before pulling away,
but I 'm really pleased with our guys,"
head coach John Whitlinger told
GoStanford.com. "They feel good
about this victory and they should.
There were lots of positives today."
Today's opponent. No. 70 BYU.
has been a stranger to the court as of
late. Three cancelled matches due to
inclement weather mean that the
Cougars have not played a dual
match since Jan. 19, when thev de

feated Eastern Washington 4-3. They
are still 3-oon the season,just like the
Cardinal, a very young team.
The Cougars are led by Daniel
Hwang and Thomas Shubert. both of
whom are 3-0 in dual match play.
Shubert and Tom Young team up in
doubles and are 2-1 this season at the
No. 3 doubles position. BYU is cur
rently on its first road trip of the dual
season and will move on to play
Santa Clara later in the weekend.
Stanford actually jumped in the
national rankings despite starting its
season with four straight losses. The
team moved from No. 42 to No. 40 in
the ITA rankings released earlier
this week, in part because it played
three top-10 teams in that stretch.
Stanford will look to make it two
in a row starting today.The match be
gins at 1:30 p.m. at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
