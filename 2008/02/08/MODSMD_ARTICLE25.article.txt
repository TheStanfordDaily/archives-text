GAME NOTES: The Cardinal wrestlers are having their best season
in years under coach Kerry McCoy. The team has a record of
11 -3 and hopes to contend at the Pac-10 Championships
which take place in early March.

With just three regular season duals left before the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships, Stanford
wrestling is gearing up for its final push in what is a
critical year for the program. With the impending
graduation of returning All-Americans — No. 6 Tan
ner Gardner at 125 pounds and No. 10 Josh Zupancic
at 157 pounds — coupled with strong support from
various sophomores and juniors, the time is ripe for
the Cardinal to make a strong push for a Pac-10 title.
As senior captain and heavyweight Phil Doerner
explained, the team's focus has been on the confer
ence tournament all season long. But with so few op
ponents left between now and the tournament's start
on March 2, every remaining opportunity that Stan
ford wrestlers have to sharpen their technique is a
precious one, indeed.
"I think we're on the right pace," Doerner said.
"Coach McCoy always says that it's practice until the
tournament, and so we've got three more practices.
Even though the matches count, they're still practice,
but three more and then the tournament which is
where it all begins."
Tonight, the Cardinal (11-3,4-2 Pac-10) travels to
San Luis Obispo, Calif, to take on conference rival Cal
Poly (5-4.4-2) before hosting Cal State-Fullerton (9-

5, 6-1) at noon on Sunday in Stan
ford's final home dual of the season.
"Cal Poly has always been sort of
a rival for us," Doerner said. "Tradi
tionally we don't really like each
other that much. And Fullerton'sone
of the top teams in the Pac-10 so
that'll be an interesting match — it's
going to be close. It's probably going
to come down to some bonus points
in a lot of close matches, so that will
be exciting."
Also on tap for the weekend is
Gardner's pursuit of Stanford history
as the two-time Ail-American is just
four wins shy of Matt Gentry's Stan
ford career mark and is two pins on
the year away from tying Chris I lor
pel's record set in 1975. Perhaps most
significantly, though, this weekend
should give McCoy's squad the
chance to rebound from last week's
disappointing 24-15 loss to Oregon
State, which was only Stanford's third
defeat of the season.
"We're all pretty excited," Doern
er said. "We know we should've beat
en Oregon State —we lost a few
matches we probably should have
won. So it's great to turn around and
wrestle really quick after you lose
and kind of get that loss off your
mind, hopefully with a win."
Sunday's dual will mark the last
home competitions for Stanford's
four graduating seniors — Gardner,
Zupancic, Doerner and Bobby Pease
at 165 pounds — who will all be hon
ored before the match, scheduled to
begin at noon in Burnham Pavilion.
