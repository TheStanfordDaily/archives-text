## Esposito seeks to redefine "Jihad" 
### CATHERINE LE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
John Esposito took the podium
at Cubberley Auditorium last night,
kicking off the second installment in
the Islamic Awareness Series "Jihad
to Reform." Targeting the issues of
America's perception of Islam, the
Georgetown professor of religion
and international affairs aimed to
complicate rather than simplify the
definition of Islam.
"Dying for God? Suicide
Terrorism and Militant Islam" was
sponsored by the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN) and
the Islamic Society of Stanford
University (ISSU), along with the
Office of Religious Life.
According to Esposito, Islam
manifested seemingly out of thin air
into the consciousness of Americans
in 2001. Prior to 9/11. Islam was an
often ignored presence, despite its
substantial number of believers.
The controversial topic of suicide
bombing took center-stage for a part
of the lecture. Suicide bombings are
sometimes rationalized by Muslim
extremists to be morally correct by
the principle of Jihad.
"Jihad has multiple meanings,"
Esposito said." The most primary
meaning is 'struggle for God.'"
He reminded the audience, how
ever, that Jihad can be interpreted in
many ways. To some, Jihad is the
struggle to remain devout and obe
dient to Islamic ethics. To others, it is
a validation for warfare and to
struggle against an oppressive force.
The term has gone through many
transformations in use. Since the
late 1980s, the growing trend of
global Jihad has taken root. Some

modern Islamic governments have
no qualms calling on religion to
motivate their interests and move
ments, whether positive or negative.
Yet, he said, the same word can be
applied to a Muslim activist group's
efforts to create change for the bet
terment of its community's social
and economic development.
"That kind of global jihad â€” we
have to realize that there's both the
good side and the bad side to that
term," he said.
He also worried that the
American public does not spend
enough time critically questioning
the motivations that prompt suicide
bombings.
"People like the quick fix," he
said,"People like to say it's not only
the Muslim extremists, but it's Islam
itself."
He further argued that America
runs the risk of blaming a situation
solely on religion, and such simplifi
cation does not give a full picture of
the complex circumstances in the
Middle East. He blamed political
and economic grievances as the
main source of agitation that spurs
the Muslim extremist faction.
"The general American popula
tion. though educated, still [has] this
misconception that Islam advocates
the use of violence against civilians,"
said Sameena Usman, government
relations representative for the
Council on American-Islamic
Relations in San Francisco, who
attended the talk. "I think it's really
important for speakers like Esposito
to explain the important economic
and political issues."
