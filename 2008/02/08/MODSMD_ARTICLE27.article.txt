## Big Fix supplement shoots for sustainability IT Services predicts large decrease in energy costs 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Going green is now as simple as
checking email: Stanford's
Information Technology Services
has recently added a power manage
ment feature to its Big Fix software
to cut energy consumption by com
puters.
On Jan. 16. the Sustainable IT
Working Group released the
Stanford Power Management Tool, a
Big Fix supplement intended to
reduce computer energy consump
tion. The tool is an additional down
load and not automatically included
with Big Fix, the software which pro
vides security updates for Windows
computers.
The power management tool cre

ates energy savings through settings
that induce sleep mode, regulate
hibernation and turn .off monitors
after a period of inactivity. The sup
plement comes with four pre-set
modes that act after vary ing periods
of inactivity, though all features can
be customized or turned off com
pletely.
"With four suggested models,
depending on how 'green' you want
to be, and the ability to customize,
you are very much in control," said
Ammy Hill, an IT Services specialist.
According to Hill, there are
approximately 42,000 PCs on cam
pus, including both student and staff
computers. Estimates from the
Sustainable Stanford Web site pre
dict $17 in annual energy savings for
each computer that installs the
Big Fix power management tool. For
the 24,000 computers on campus
that already have Big Fix installed,
this could translate into an estimat
ed $400,000 in annual electricity sav
ings. 28,000 tons of carbon dioxide

emissions could be avoided if users
download the supplement
University-wide.
Users of the Big Fix power man
agement tool, including the
University, are eligible for a $15
rebate from Pacific Gas & Electric
(PG&E).
"The rebate money from student
computers will become a nest egg
for the Stanford Green Fund to fund
student sustainability projects." Hill
said. "This supports our original goal
of creating a cycle of sustainability,
rather than something we just do
one time."
Rebates from staff computers
will be returned to participating
departments with the expectation
that the money will be spent on
updating or replacing inefficient
equipment.
But informing people of the new
power management tool and
encouraging downloads might be a
challenge. Brett Naul '08, Resident
Computing Consultant in Kairos,

said that he had not heard of the
new Big Fix supplement and found
the Big Fix software slow.
"Big Fix is the worst." Naul said.
"I have a PC that used to have
Big Fix but I uninstalled it because it
is too slow. I do security stuff on my
own so don't need it."
Nonetheless. IT Services plans to
forge ahead with an equivalent tool
available for Macs that should be
available by this summer.
"This power management tool is
the Sustainable IT Working Group's
first big initiative," Hill said. "This is
all kind of ramping up since the hir
ing of the new sustainable coordina
tor for Stanford in November.
Hopefully this will start us down a
good path."
Big Fix is available free of charge
for all Stanford students and staff
with PCs on the Essential Stanford
Software Web site.
