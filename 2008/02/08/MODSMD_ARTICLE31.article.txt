## Because Your Mom Has One 
### KARMIA CAO INTERMISSION ANATOMICAL ACTIVIST 
"Chocolate vaginas! Chocolate vaginas! They
taste better than the real thing!" You have prob
ably heard a permutation of the cry above while
biking through White Plaza and wondered why
there has been so much pussy talk on campus. I
went to the dress rehearsal of Stanford's very
own performance of The Vagina Monologues to
find out.
Sleek high-heels clicked and beautiful hair
swished — ixteen of the hottest girls on campus
swiftly stepped onstage. "We are worried about
vaginas," a member of the ensemble called out
during the introduction. And with that, began
the revolutionary play written and originally
performed by Eve Ensler that is the manifesto of
the V-Day movement to "celebrate, activate and
change the story of women."

"Both girls and guys should come," said cast
member Kit Garton. "This play is artsy, hilari
ous. dirty, educational and, most importantly,
meaningful." The Vagina Monologues consists
of ten monologues that explore a variety of
women's (and men's) issues ranging from shav
ing to misbehaving, while also raising awareness

about the physical and emotional abuse of women as both a
wartime strategy and a warfront of its own.
"Come because this is a benefit performance," said Kathleen
Bryson. "Ninety percent of the proceeds from the show go to the
onlv women's shelter in Santa Clara county, where battered

women find security and help.'
The rest of the money will sup-

port this year's V-Day Spotlight Campaign: the women of New
Orleans and the Gulf South who fight and hope to survive the
repercussions of Katrina. the failure of public institutions, racism,
economic hardship and domestic abuse.

"It is a part of your collcge experience
and you should see this play with a college
audience at least once," said Kendra Al
lenherg, "It's different." And so it is. The
play fights agains taboos and hesitation re
lated to the "v-word". Hand-held mirrors
have sold out from local stores whenever
the play was in town, and women every
where are challenged each year to take
hold of their sexual identity and pleasure
and make it truly their own.
"It's the sexiest way to talk about a beau
tiful and forbidden topic," said Gianna
Masi. After all, who has ever asked you
what your vagina would dress like or say,
given the chance to express itself?
The Vagina Monologues is relevant.
Even if you don't have a punani, coochie,
muff, beaver or a vajayjay, you should see
it because the vagina is the reason why
you're here. And ladies, by all means,
come to the show to touch yourself: you
may cry, but you will definitely laugh.

The show will be held February 8, V and 10

in Annenberg Auditorium and kicks off
this year's V-Week, which will beheld February 12 — 16. Tickets
are sold in White Plaza during lunch.
