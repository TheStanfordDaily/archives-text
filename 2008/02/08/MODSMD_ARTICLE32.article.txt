Think back to your last college party experience — the pissy reek of flat Natty Lite, those pre-party glugs of warm, oily Smirnoff. Close your eyes and really feel the wretch and burn of
that low-grade grain alcohol. There's no excuse to keep drinking like a college student now. With a little money, a few hours and, of course, these invaluable tips, you too can establish a
home bar that will be the envy of your peers. And, god willing, never again know the throat-scourge of mediocre hooch.
1) Don't drink stupid drinks. If your friends don't make fun of you, your bartenders will. Nothing says"I just turned 21 and lack all understanding of the fine art of mixology" like or
dering a Long Island Iced Tea. Nothing says"I buy into all prime-time stereotypes" like asking for a Cosmo. And nothing says "Seriously, these drinks make you look stupid" like me right
now, telling you that these drinks make you look stupid, stupid.
2) Drink at home. Drinking out in Palo Alto, assuming you have the proper (and legal) identification, is a pricey endeavor: most bars charge about $10 for a cocktail, and once you factor
in tips and taxi fare, your fun social evening has become a total account-drainer. Why go through all this trouble when you can buy a whole bottle of Belvedere for the cost of just two
mediocre Lemon Drops on the town?
3) There are five basic boozes. Keep a good bottle of each on hand. A highly scientific combination of internet-combing and long drunken nights suggests you purchase: Stolichnaya
vodka, Tanqueray or Bombay gin (Tanqueray Rangpur has a nice lime hint for those of you who think you hate gin), Bacardi Silver rum, Four-Year-Old Flor de Cana gold rum, Maker's
Mark or Jack Daniels whiskey and Sauza Hornitas tequila. For good measure, also pick up a bottle of triple-sec for margaritas and kamikazes and a bottle of Rose's Sweetened Lime
Juice for the nights you're too lazy to squeeze your own. This economical-premium line-up will run you about $200; split the cost with a roommate and you'll be lushed up for six months
for the price of one halfway legendary night at NoLa's.
4) Cocktail crafting is like sex. Equipment trumps enthusiasm. To wit: a lemon squeezer (which can be used on limes too), a metal cocktail shaker with at least a 16-ounce capacity,
several ice trays and appropriate cocktail and lowball glasses.
5) Freshness is key. Throw out that Finest Call nuclear yellow "sour mix." If you have a citrus squeezer and half a brain you can make a delicious go-to drink in minutes. First make
some simple syrup by mixing equal parts sugar and boiling water — there's a reason it's called simple syrup. Now mix two parts simple syrup, two parts fresh lemon juice and one part
lime juice. There. Sour mix. This is liquid gold. Margarita? Two ounces mix, two ounces tequila, one ounce triple-sec. Whiskey sour? Two ounces sour mix, two ounces whiskey. Vodka
sour, whiskey sour, Pisco sour? Same deal. You can even use it with that sickly sweet Midori sludge, I guess.
6) Whenever you think you have enough ice, double it. Ice is the real key to any tasty cocktail. For any drink served straight up, fill your shaker three-quarters full with fresh ice and
give the drink about twelve hard diagonal shakes. (You're waking it up, not rocking it to sleep.) For shaken drinks served on the rocks, always use fresh ice in the glass. The dilution ice
provides is necessary for maintaining the flavor ratios in drinks, and it takes that hot sting out of high-proof booze.
