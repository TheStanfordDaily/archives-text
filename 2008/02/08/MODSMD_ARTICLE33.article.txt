## MASCOT MADNESS 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION BOOKIE 
4. Auk£Jmmi l/C. 5. JmM film SuhuKuj
Two controversial figures from different
eras square off! As much as I oppose
racism of any kind, it cannot be denied that
Jemima's syrup is delicious. But you know
what else is delicious? Losing 240 pounds
and becoming America's Sweetheart in the
process. Even if you are kind of lame.
EDGE: Jared.

3. Colouil £wleu l/C. 2. lowj fla Tigti

I feel like KFC has drifted away from the
Colonel in recent years. Would Harlan
really stand for Popcorn chicken? I'm
if/Mnn until rr\nt/ 1 in M

going with I ony l. in a victo
ry for naked kerchief-wear
ing tigers everywhere.
EDGE: Tony.

1. RowJd McDonald l/f. S. Tht Bwtq&i King Kutq
Is there some unwritten rule stating that all burger mascots
have to be excessively creepy? Which raises the question: if
horror sells burgers, which of these two is the bigger mon
ster? The Burger King King's got that whole "I'm gonna
blow up the Parliament on Guy Fawkes Day" look about
liim, whereas Ronald McDonald is, for all intents and pur
poses, Pennywise the Clown. ("They all float down here,
Grimace ...")
EDGE: Ronald.

In honor of Food Week here at Intermission, this latest edition of
Bracketology features a fun-sized match-up of eight iconic fig
ures that you probably know better than your parents by this
point: food product mascots! These captains of the eating indus
try have all sweetened our lives and our taste buds over the years,
but who is the true sultan of snack selling? The champion of
chew? The Colossus of Foods? I'm sure this age-old question
keeps you awake at night, dear reader, and now at long last you
have the chance to find out. On to the first course ...

1. Ronald l/C. 5. SubuKUj Jwd
Still don't believe nie when 1 tell you that Ronald
McDonald is the creepier than a room full of
American Girl dolls? Youtubc "Retro McDon
alds Commercial." Just trust me. (Fun fact: There
are more Subway restaurants in the U.S. than
there are McDonald's. Why doesn't America
want to be fat anymore? Because Jared didn't
want to be fat anymore. Bravo, Mr. Fogle.)
EDGE: Jared.

5. Subway Jcuied l/S. 2. Towj Ue Tt/jti
Jarcd could still cat Tony if he really
wanted to.

3. Colonel Mmlom, Caudfti l/C. 6. Fkpa John,

Here's a list of America's greatest entrepreneurs:
Rockefeller. Ford. Stanford. Gates. And Colonel
Sanders, the man who ran RFC back when they
still made actual chicken. What a man. (And no,
Papa John is not an entrepreneur unless you de
fine that word as "absolute corporate tool." Nice
try.)
EDGE: The Colonel.

Q. Toy the Tiqei l/£. 7. Tie Thuc Rabbit
This match-up of anthropomorphic cereal titans
comes down to their personalities. Who's the bet
ter guy? Option A: the warm father figure who al
ways seems to be coaching youth soccer and
boosting kids' self confidence through encourag
ing growls? Or Option B: A skeevy loner hell
bent on stealing from children what they love
most in the world. I'll take GrrrrrA!
EDGE: Tony.
