## old dudes, quirky foods 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION HUNGRY HAGIOGRAPHER 
As children, most of us have harbored shameful and idiosyncratic food preferences. A hatred of cit
rus? A need for white bread and peanut butter three times a day? A craving for ceramic novelty fig
urines? These are all symptomatic of d child's typically misdirected impotent rage — a rage engen
dered by early bedtimes and the wearing of footsie pajamas.

Of course, once puberty hits, most of us learn to channel our anti-societal urges into healthier areas such
as agriculture or clinical depression. Some individuals, however, never outgrow their dining quirks, instead spending
their entire lives locked in a universe in which peaches never existed, where pics are four of the six food groups or where
I apparently can't eat a ferret because "they're endangered." These people, with their cruelly restricted worldviews,
sometimes even become famous, proving once again that eating well doesn't get you anywhere.

William Howard Taf't: Our notoriously obese 27th president, Taft inspired controversy within a few days of entering the Oval Of
fice when it was found that he had ingested three chairs, a chandelier and a priceless Remington sculpture of an Indian on horse
back. Aides subsequently chained him to a post in the White I louse backyard, where he proceeded to serve a distinguished single
term, championing arbitration treaties, strengthening the Interstate Commerce Commission and eating William Jennings Bryan.

Eve: The mother of humanity was. against all appearances, not really a fan of apples at all. Instead, the woman was a connois
seur of red meat, and she had only stopped by the orchard because the Korean place, Sahnmaru Korean 880, was closed.

Timothy Leary: Leary was famously picky within the '60s counterculture, subsisting almost entirely on sunshine, 12-foot
high flowers and a golden nectar referred to as "Lifewain" that flowed from the mouths of tiny purple toads.

Benjamin Franklin: It is widely believed that this Founding Father was a vegetarian. This is generally true, but substan
tial historical evidence exists to suggest that he also frequently dined on injustice and. sometimes, duck.

Elvis Presley: Among the King's various dietary eccentricities, the most prominent is his predilection for fried peanut
butter sandwiches, which he would stuff with bananas, Dexedrine and a notable lack of concern over stealing black peo-

ples' music.

Cormac McCarthy: The boy spat dryly, shielding his eyes against the full high-albedo glory of the road's wetted crown. White heat
and steam rose from the dusty causeway like the Kingdom come too soon. Wasn't nothing to eat but a charred socket of bone nes
tled in some snuffed balefire. 1 le shut his eyes against the grit and turned into the wind.

Woody Allen: The famed filmmaker has eaten the same lunch — a tuna-salad sandwich — for the past 45 years. This is, however,
merely one of many Allen habits I've researched, which include never leaving New York, stuttering when approached by a woman
and not returning my phone calls.

Dylan Thomas: Thomas was a notably heavy drinker — a fact which wreaked havoc on his health. His last words are reportedly,

"I've had eighteen straight whiskies — I think that's a new record," at which point he attempted to light
himself a cigarette and exploded.

Ernest Hemingway: I lemingway's food idiosyncrasies are among the stranger in the world of literature
as they relate, not to the nature of the actual food, but to the manner in which it was presented. As de
tailed in his memoir, "A Moveable Feast," this pioneering member of the American canon was ob-J

sessed with mobile food. Among the recipes he provides are "Wheeled Prosciutto," "Salad
Plus Jet Engine" and "Motorpork," all of which he could enjoy while dashing about Paris, writing
terse, muscular prose and injecting testosterone into his thigh. J

Catherine <le Medici: Though better known as the devious mastermind behind the St

Bartholomew's Day Massacre, Catherine de Medici is also largely credited with dramatically trans
forming French cuisine. Before her courtly influence, the France's national cuisine consisted entire-

ly of hasty, inedible swamp creatures, whereas it now consists of nasty, inedible swamp creatures J

covered in a light cream sauce.

Mahatnia Gandhi: Widely lauded in popular histories as a visionary social conscience, Gandhi I

was, in fact, merely a very picky eater — a state of affairs that was enormously confusing to the
British, who will eat literally anything.

Benedict Arnold: As befits his character, this symbol of disloyalty spent every morning eating the richest and
most traitorous of all breakfast foods — "eggs Benedict," or, as they were known then, "eggs."
