## "Ate Everything" easy to swallow 
### CARL CASE INTERMISSION LITERARY LUNCHER 
It took the mineral water to convince me: Jef
frey Steingarten is hopelessly and deliciously in
sane. In an essay austerely titled "Water" from
his collection "The Man Who Ate Everything,"
Steingarten sets himself a uniquely quixotic
task: mix his own H2O from scratch and finally
find "that pure, clear, ethereal Alpine spring of
our imaginations." And after a humorously en
gaging summary of all the scholarly writing on
water, its components, its taste and its wonder
ful skin-smoothing properties, we learn that the
perfect glass equals distilled water plus 61 parts
per million bicarbonates (solicitously measured,
of course) and a host of other chemicals not
found at the local mega-mart, garnished with an
impossibly trace 1.8 ppm of sodium. But exquis
ite detail isn't the insanity—just obsessive re
search. Hints of mental instability creep in when
Steingarten takes a shopping list to "one of the
largest chemical supply houses in Manhattan."
When an employee, evidently not used to New
York's foodie scene (or anyone who specifies
"food grade only"), fails to take interest in our
fearless journalist's "spellbinding project" and
labels him "crazy," Steingarten snaps back the
only way he knows how: "Though this be mad
ness, yet there is method in't." He is subsequent
ly (and rightfully) kicked out for quoting Ham
let in a bulk chemical shop.
This misadventure captures the essence of

what makes Jeffrey Steingarten's "The Man
Who Ate Everything" such a delight to read.
The author spent most of his working years
practicing law with political involvement driz
zled over, but he is plagued with a food obses
sion so acute that he asserts in an autobiograph
ical moment, "[l] trained to become a food
writer at Harvard College and Harvard Law
School." Never mind all those Con Law classes;
a series of escapes from dining hall food defined
his college years. In 1989 he broke down, aban
doned his law practice, and signed on as the
restaurant critic and food essayist for Vogue
magazine. "The Man Who Ate Everything" col
lects his best bits from the first seven years after
he took the job.
One trouble with best-ofs is a tendency to
drift this way and that without a center to hold
the mess together. To be sure, Steingarten's hy
peractive intellect is all over the place (though it
careens far more than it drifts), but he lays a
broad, thematic thesis right up front. In a droll
introduction, Steingarten argues that humans
are the ultimate omnivores, able to "take nour
ishment from an endless variety of flora and
fauna and easily adapt to a changing world —
crop failures,... restaurant closings, and the
like." But because of one "chic food fear" or an
other, we have all "become- failed omnivores.
We let down the omnivore team." Hoping to re
verse any bias of taste buds, Steingarten first
rules out brain surgery as the solution (having
done all his lobotomy research) and begins an

Olympic regimen of constant confrontation
with his deepest food phobias. The training is a
smash success, so, having become "a more per
fect omnivore," Steingarten sets out to correct
the less omnivorous.
His first target Is anyone who would dictate
our diets, and those attacks comprise Stein
garten's most mischievous essays. Particularly
provocative is "Salad the Silent Killer," in which
Steingarten distills "weeks [spent] combing the
scientific journals for data 011 the poisons that
lurk in every bowl of salad and every basket of
crudites" into a unified case against the "salad
gluttons" who believe they can make a balanced
diet out of leafy greens and fibrous snacks.
Amazingly enough, he makes a solid argument
backed by a phalanx of food toxin research and
concludes that vegetables are like anything else:
just one slice of the omnivore's plate and a rea
son to celebrate "the miracle of cooking."
Steingarten's swipes at the nutrition police
are delightful, but "The Man Who Ate Every
thing" is worth your while simply for its sheer
breadth of style and subject and the obsessive
passion the author shows for each. There is an
entire section dedicated to food travelogues;
highlights include shopping for unpronounce
able fish with Marcella Hazan. the Italian chef
and author responsible for bringing traditional
Italian cuisine to the US, and zipping around
Sicily to find "the mother of all ice cream." Best
of all, though, is the author's complete insanity.
In a piece to which I cannot even begin to do jus

tice, Steingarten attempts to prepare the
Thompson turkey, the only turkey recipe to
have a bona fide "cult." It is the Holy Grail of
overzealous cooks: to prepare a Thompson
turkey is to attempt the impossible. In a recipe
description that goes for seven pages, Stein
garten lovingly lists the 29 ingredients in the
stuffing and the fiendish flour- and egg-based
glaze. Any normal human would give up some
where between the two teaspoons of caraway
seed and half-teaspoon of summer savory;
Steingarten doesn't even blink.
Why recommend this book now. ten years
after publication? The glib answer is 1 finished it
this fall, had it on my bookshelf and it was the
most fun 1 can remember having with a book (or
at least reading a book ... but that's another
story). But I think the decade of distance we
now have allows an ever-so-small insight into
American culture. Last year saw the publication
of "The Omnivore's Dilemma," a book whose
title reveals a thesis much the same: we eat a pa
thetically narrow range of foods. But ten years
of separation shows. On the one hand, "Dilem
ma" is fiercely homiletic, warping a tale of food
into a lesson in US politics and culture. On the
other, "The Man Who Ate Everything" has a
pure, infectious excitement for food untainted
by a political agenda; it's a product of its time. If
you are wound up by this divisive election sea
son, take a break to bask in Steingarten's un
bounded love for food — which is a kind way of
saying clinical insanity.

This misadventure captures the essence of

what makes Jeffrey Steingarten's "The Man
Who Ate Everything" such a delight to read.
The author spent most of his working years
practicing law with political involvement driz
zled over, but he is plagued with a food obses
sion so acute that he asserts in an autobiograph
ical moment, "[l] trained to become a food
writer at Harvard College and Harvard Law
School." Never mind all those Con Law classes;
a series of escapes from dining hall food defined
his college years. In 1989 he broke down, aban
doned his law practice, and signed on as the
restaurant critic and food essayist for Vogue
magazine. "The Man Who Ate Everything" col
lects his best bits from the first seven years after
he took the job.
One trouble with best-ofs is a tendency to
drift this way and that without a center to hold
the mess together. To be sure, Steingarten's hy
peractive intellect is all over the place (though it
careens far more than it drifts), but he lays a
broad, thematic thesis right up front. In a droll
introduction, Steingarten argues that humans
are the ultimate omnivores, able to "take nour
ishment from an endless variety of flora and
fauna and easily adapt to a changing world —
crop failures,... restaurant closings, and the
like." But because of one "chic food fear" or an
other, we have all "become- failed omnivores.
We let down the omnivore team." Hoping to re
verse any bias of taste buds, Steingarten first
rules out brain surgery as the solution (having
done all his lobotomy research) and begins an

Olympic regimen of constant confrontation
with his deepest food phobias. The training is a
smash success, so, having become "a more per
fect omnivore," Steingarten sets out to correct
the less omnivorous.
His first target Is anyone who would dictate
our diets, and those attacks comprise Stein
garten's most mischievous essays. Particularly
provocative is "Salad the Silent Killer," in which
Steingarten distills "weeks [spent] combing the
scientific journals for data 011 the poisons that
lurk in every bowl of salad and every basket of
crudites" into a unified case against the "salad
gluttons" who believe they can make a balanced
diet out of leafy greens and fibrous snacks.
Amazingly enough, he makes a solid argument
backed by a phalanx of food toxin research and
concludes that vegetables are like anything else:
just one slice of the omnivore's plate and a rea
son to celebrate "the miracle of cooking."
Steingarten's swipes at the nutrition police
are delightful, but "The Man Who Ate Every
thing" is worth your while simply for its sheer
breadth of style and subject and the obsessive
passion the author shows for each. There is an
entire section dedicated to food travelogues;
highlights include shopping for unpronounce
able fish with Marcella Hazan. the Italian chef
and author responsible for bringing traditional
Italian cuisine to the US, and zipping around
Sicily to find "the mother of all ice cream." Best
of all, though, is the author's complete insanity.
In a piece to which I cannot even begin to do jus

tice, Steingarten attempts to prepare the
Thompson turkey, the only turkey recipe to
have a bona fide "cult." It is the Holy Grail of
overzealous cooks: to prepare a Thompson
turkey is to attempt the impossible. In a recipe
description that goes for seven pages, Stein
garten lovingly lists the 29 ingredients in the
stuffing and the fiendish flour- and egg-based
glaze. Any normal human would give up some
where between the two teaspoons of caraway
seed and half-teaspoon of summer savory;
Steingarten doesn't even blink.
Why recommend this book now. ten years
after publication? The glib answer is 1 finished it
this fall, had it on my bookshelf and it was the
most fun 1 can remember having with a book (or
at least reading a book ... but that's another
story). But I think the decade of distance we
now have allows an ever-so-small insight into
American culture. Last year saw the publication
of "The Omnivore's Dilemma," a book whose
title reveals a thesis much the same: we eat a pa
thetically narrow range of foods. But ten years
of separation shows. On the one hand, "Dilem
ma" is fiercely homiletic, warping a tale of food
into a lesson in US politics and culture. On the
other, "The Man Who Ate Everything" has a
pure, infectious excitement for food untainted
by a political agenda; it's a product of its time. If
you are wound up by this divisive election sea
son, take a break to bask in Steingarten's un
bounded love for food — which is a kind way of
saying clinical insanity.
