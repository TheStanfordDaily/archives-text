# WINEHOUSE "B-SIDE" HERSELA
## 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION WINO 
"Back to Black: B-sidcs," Amy Winehouse's
eponymous follow-up album to her multi-plat
inum sophomore release in Decemeber 2006, is
an eclectic addendum of rare songs, ska covers
and slowed-down renditions.
The album offers eight tracks of a less pro
duced, less commercial, more surprising and in
definitely more intimate look at the British
singer-songwriter who so recently erupted onto
the pop music scene (and the tabloid news head
lines). On B-sidcs, Winehouse doesn't seem to
care — for better or worse — about cornering
air-wave time or releasing singles. Instead, she
explores and experiments with down-tempos
and understated acoustic accompaniment, a
drastic change from her big band 70's funk
arrangements on Back to Black.
B-Sides opens with a seeming continuation
of Back to Black with the quieter yet still up
beat soul-funk track "Valeric." Winehouse
pleads, "Oh won't you come on over/ Stop mak
ing a fool out of me/ Oh why don't you come on
over, Valerie." The minimalist accompaniment

allows Winehouse's powerhouse vocals to take
center stage as they ebb and How with emotion,
building with frustration during one chorus to
dissipate with imploration in the next.
Winehouse experiments with a reggae back
beat on "Cupid," where a star-crossed lover bar
gains with the Greek god of love. She tells him,
"Now Cupid if your arrow makes her love strong
for me/1 swear I'm gonna love her until eterni
ty/ I know that 'tween the both of us her heart we
can steal." The reggae-meets-soul blend is an in
novative and appropriately funky musical can
vas for the atypically light-hearted Winehouse
lyrics.
B-Sides takes a turn for the worse, however,
with "Hey Little Rich Girl" and "Monkey
Man," two covers of the 1970's UK ska band
The Specials. Both songs are backed by a con
stant and less than inspiring drum pattern over
which Winehouse rather incoherently sings the
already bizarre lyrics. Although "Hey Little
Rich Girl" includes some interesting trumpet
solos and retro big band signatures, the repeat
ed falsetto "shoo-doop-sha-doos" miss their
mark as a quaint call-and-response throwback
and quickly become obnoxious. The original

song "You're Wondering Now" is ska-influ
enced, but it features similar lackluster vocals
and an unexceptional beat.
The album regains steam, however, in the de
cidedly morphed "Some Unholy War," a much
slower iteration of its former self from Back to
Black. The inserted back-lip singers' "oohs" and
"ahhs" add an eerie, ephemeral, melodic layer
to the slowed-down tempo and meandering gui
tar.
B-Sides comes into sharp focus on its final
two live tracks, "To Know Him Is To Love
Him," and the revisited "Love is a Losing
Game." In both. Winehouse despondently
croons about love, accompanied in each song
with only an acoustic guitar. In "To Know Him,"
she describes the vulnerability of loving, while in
"Losing Game" — perhaps one of her finest
examples of song-writing — she regrets entan
gling herself in matters of the heart: "Over futile
odds./ And laughed at by the Gods,/ And now
the final frame,/ Love is a losing game." Wine
house's intensely longing, nuanced delivery of
"Losing Game" is sure to make even those in
love take a moment to reflect on the emotional
trials and tribulations of relationships. Her full.

resonating voice, dripping with heartache, just
might leave you convinced that love never does
work out and at the very least thankful she re
leased the live demo version on CD.
