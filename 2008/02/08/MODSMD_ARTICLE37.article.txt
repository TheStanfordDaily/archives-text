### BETSY WALLS INTERMISSION DINENDATER 
THE GOOD: Has more interesting life experience; will
take you places olf-campus you've never explored

THE BAD: If s/he gets wasted with you and your friends,
that's pretty alcoholic for a grown-up

THE UGLY: While on a date, you run into his/her friends
and realize that three of them were once your TAs —
and gave you Cs.

THE GOOD: Has more tasty lunch options and
classy environment than anywhere else on

campus; will take points and Cardinal
Dollars

THE BAD: There's wine avail-

able, but drinking at lunch is pretty alcoholic for
.... a student

THE UGLY: While eating, you run into
three of your TAs and overhear

them discussing the fact that
they're going to give you a C.

You can always date an alum once you are one, but
coming back for lunch on campus just won't be feasi
ble then ... The Alumni Center Cafe wins!

THE GUT: Someone named Pete is bound to
be a nice, down-to-earth kind of person
08/lACLE: How many people named Pete are there on campus, anyway?
THE Gl/T: A place with coffee in the name guarantees you can probably get a
passable latte there
08/lACLE: How many hours is the Peet's in Tresidder actually open, any
way?
Pete wins — at least he isn't overpriced and doesn't taste a little off from what
you expect

though you shouldn't

candidate?

We all like to dream of ourselves as Renaissance men and women, as superheroes who have the ability to learn, play, emote, re
late and work out without ever betraying a moment of care —we are, after all, denizens of Stanford! We all have secretly acknowl
edged, however, the moments of sacrifice: when sleep gives way to study, when fitness takes a backseat to Facebook or when we
could do the reading but would rather take a beating. Difficult decisions must be made. Perhaps you want a hot affair and a hot
sandwich, but an imminent exam or deadline means you only have time to satisfy either your heart or your stomach. The next time
you find yourself in such a dilemma, consult this handy comparison guide on which option — food or dating partner — is worth it.
