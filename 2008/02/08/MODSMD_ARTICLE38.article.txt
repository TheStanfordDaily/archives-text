## a 						feast of fusion 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION CONTINENTAL COLLIDER 
Tucked away on Emerson Street, surround
ed by the mediocrity that is Buca di Beppo and
Gordon Biersch, is one of Palo Alto's most dis
tinctive dining destinations. Chef Sachin
Chopra's Mantra Restaurant and Lounge com
bines the ingredients of California with the
spices of India in dishes and drinks you won't
find anywhere else. Upon sitting down and re
viewing the menu in the sedated elegance of the
interior, it is immediately clear that a meal at
Mantra will be a special experience.

To start with, the bar offers a number of
tempting specialty cocktails such as the Icy
Melon Martini and Mango Margarita. If you
have to drive home, they make an Indian sum
mer fruit punch which is a tasty combination of
a number of juices that satisfies without being
too sweet. At $6 for a non-alcoholic drink, how
ever, a more economical option might be a wa
tered-down can of Hawaiian Punch.
Among its appetizers. Mantra offers two dif
ferent sampler plates — a vegetarian and non
vegetarian version — which provide a good way
to sample a number of Chef Chopra's flavors.
The small lamb chops, despite looking delicious,
were actually quite disappointing, but there
were tasty bits of chicken and fish as well as
mushroom and eggplant creations that were
amazing. So even for an ardent carnivore, the

vegetarian appetizer selections seem to have
more to offer.
The bulk of Mantra's entries could be classi
fied as fusion, though they did have one section
of more traditional Indian dishes. One of these,
the bhuna lamb, was an excellent curry with fen
nel and onions served with a flat wheat bread. It
was surprisingly spicy for a dish at a restaurant
that doesn't necessarily market itself as serving
authentic Indian food. In any event, the lamb's
flavor was delicious in its own right, making for
a first rate curry and capturing the best of Indian
cooking.
The main courses, which are Mantra's
biggest attractions, were much more innovative,
for the most part. One of the more interesting
sounding selections is the paneer ravioli, a single
large pastry filled with spinach in a flavorful
creamy sauce of cheese and mushrooms. The
connection to a more traditional saag paneer
was not particularly strong, but it is still difficult
to stop eating after the first bite. As delicious as
I he ravioli was. it may have been an error on the
chefs part to make an entree sized portion of
something so rich — it would have been more
appropriate to make the pastry a more manage
able size and serve it as an appetizer.
On the more Californian end of the spectrum
was the smoked chili butterfish. The Indian in
fluence came partly in the spice of the fish, but
mostly in the tomato biryani served on the side.
A seemly Thai accent was also added by giving

the rice a coconut flavor. Overall, the fish

while tasty, would probably be insufficient
to make a fish-lover out of someone who

wasn't one already, and the richness of thel
coconut rice seemed to clash with the light
ness of the fish.

The surroundings at Mantra arc typical of"
neither Californian nor Indian restaurants. The
modern, softly-lit interior made for a casually el
egant experience while the Indian earth tones
and artwork ensured that the restaurant did not
feel like just another yuppie hangout. While
Mantra bills itself as displaying the artwork of
modern Indian masters, one could have thought
that some of the work had been purchased on
opening night at Ikea. Our primary server, while
friendly and attentive, exuded the confidence of
someone who had been working there for no
more than fifteen minutes.

Overall, a meal at Mantra is a delicious, al-J
beit pricey, experience, exceeding $40 per per- k

son for two courses and no alcohol. Every
thing was good and many of the dishes were i

exceptional. And while the service may
not have been perfectly professional, no A

egregious errors were made either. Per

haps more time will allow Mantra to work out
the kinks, but even now it provides a well-exe
cuted meal combining a number of tastes that
will provide a memorable night out on the town.
