# "Vampire Weekend" an ode to college and afropop
## 
### PAUL CRAFT KZSU CAPE CODDER 
Imagine a spring afternoon, bright yellow

and blue. You're sitting with
your friends on some cool plot
of grass, your limbs stretched
out, sunglasses on. All you can
hear is the joyous laughter of a
friend over the roar of a foun
tain. Now take this feeling,
make it into an album and you
would end up with Vampire
Weekend by Vampire Week
end. The album is bright, laid
back and thoroughly collegiate.
It's a collection of Africa-refer
encing pop songs detailing col
lege, romance,and summer
trips.
The members of Vampire
Weekend are recent graduates
of Columbia University, and
they wear this influence on
their sleeve. The songs are

often too clover for their own good, featuring
big words and nimble-tongued rhyming. And
the images of the songs are classically East coast:
a sophomore girl sitting on the Cape Cod gvass,
Louis Vitton apparel in tow. A friend moving to

a new apartment in Washington Heights. Man
hattan, a trip to the Massachusetts beach ruined
by traffic or a girlfriend moving up to Cam
bridge. One song even curses "the women of

Wellesley." In person, the band is preppy to the
core — collared shirts and khakis are the norm.
Stripped of these particular references, howev
er, Vampire Weekend speaks to a college
lifestyle familiar to us here at Stanford: getting

out of bed to rush to class, seeing a familiar
beautiful girl walking across campus and taking
naps in the afternoon.
But considering the band's blue-blood back-

ground makes its musical approach
all the more surprising. The band is
inspired by the breezy sounds of
African pop. The songs are short and
upbeat and the bass is prominent.
The guitar riffs arc clean and often
interplay with 10-fi synthesizer lines
and strings. The vocals transition
easily between falsetto, joyful yelps
and spoken word. Then all these ele
ments are pinned together by a pre
cisely timed pop sensibility similar to
their fellow New Yorkers, The
Strokes.

This talent for simple but
catchy arrangement first shows itself
with their single," A-Punk." Built on
an amateurish, jangly riff, the song
has three parts: the driving, sham
bled verse, the hushed, flute-based
chorus and a bass-yell breakdown.

This is followed by the bongo drum-guitar dy
namic of "Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa," which
details a collegiate fling in — you guessed it —
Cape Cod.

My personal favorite is "Campus," the sixth

track. Over a muted bassline, lead singer Ezra
Koenig sings about a walk across campus to
class spent contemplating his status with a girl
walking nearby. Some major-key chords come
chiming in, and he sings, "How I am supposed to
pretend/1 never want to see you again?" In my
mind, it captures a perfect tone for collegiate ro
mance: the excitement, the random campus run
ins and even the confusion.

Vampire Weekend can seem self-conscious
and forced at times, notably in the song, "One
(Blake's Got a New Face)." The dissimilarity
between the Columbia background and African
pop style can be jarring. It often feels like four
talented buddies stumbled onto a stack of
African pop records and then spent a semester
writing similar-sounding songs. But, ultimately,
the band is

just having
too much fun
to carc.
There is a
lively sense of
joy that runs
through
Vamp i r e
Weekend,
and it's infec
tious.
