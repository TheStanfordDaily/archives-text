# JINX: 72-43
## Ducks dominated by both Stanford squads Can't stop the Cardinal 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It wasn't supposed to be this
easy. Not against Oregon, the last
team to beat Stanford, 71-66
some six games ago. Not for the
No. 9 Cardinal, who was sup
posed to have lost its heads in the
hoopla of its first top-10 ranking
in four years.
It was supposed to be more
fun. A back-and-forth battle, we
were promised, with the quickest
Pac-10 team driving the lane at
will on one side of the court and
the biggest team in the league
pounding the paint on the other.

Instead, it was a victory so dominant it was joy
less.
Behind a ruthless, smothering defense, Stan
ford clobbered Oregon 72-43 last night at Maples
Pavilion. It was the fewest points Oregon (13-9.4-
6 Pac-10) has scored in a game since 1991, and as
few as Stanford (19-3.8-2 Pac-10) has allowed all
season. Sophomore center Robin Lopez led all
players with 15 points, junior forward Lawrence
Hill scored 13 and sophomore forward Brook
Lopez added 12.
"Our offensive execution probably was as good
as it's been all year," said coach Trent Johnson, who
had never before won 19 games in a season as
Stanford head coach. "But 1 look at our defensive
efficiency, and say that's what's going to take care
of us."
Oregon, meanwhile, sounded postgame much
like it looked during the two hours previous: shell
shocked.
"You saw Oregon at their worst tonight." said
Ducks forward Malik Hairston (6 points). "It's the
most embarrassing loss of my senior year. It was a
terrible effort by Oregon."
Two 7-0 runs, a Hill three capping the second,
pushed Stanford ahead 16-7 just 4:2 l ) in. The Car
dinal was on pace to score 143 points, and while
that pace wouldn't hold up. the lead certainly did.
An 8-0 spurt pushed Stanford ahead 27-11 in the
first 11 minutes, and that margin grew to 37-23 by
halftime, even though Anthony Goods' 40-foot
heave was disallowed as its release came just after
the halftime buzzer.
It was about the only thing that would go wrong
for the Cardinal, who shot 55 percent in that first
half and 49 percent (27-of-55) for the game. Mean
while, Oregon's accuracy was horrendous. The
Ducks shot just 24 percent in the first half and 29
percent (14-of-48) overall. Those marks were far
lower than their previous season-low 40 percent
accuracy in a December loss at Nebraska. A woe
ful 4-of-18 (22 percent) performance from behind
the arc only added salt to the Ducks' wounds.
"We killed ourselves on the perimeter." Hair
ston said. "We couldn't make shots."
Stanford came out in the second half with as
much as it had in the first, completing two more 7-
0 runs. The margin was 50-29 with 13 minutes left
after the first and 63-33 with under six minutes to
go after the second.
ITie Stanford men were on their way to beating
Oregon by the exact same score as the women
would moments earlier in Eugene, Ore. More im
portantly to Trent Johnson, the lopsided game al
lowed him to rest his bruised and battered starters
(the Lopez twins played 28 minutes apiece, while
no other starter played more than 22), letting the
second string shine.
Reserve guard Drew Shiller seized the moment

with 8 points on five shots, the last a surprisingly
decisive driving right-handed layup.The offensive
spark Shiller injected into the lineup may bode
well in the coming weeks.
"I think it's pretty obvious that we play physical
defense, so if we get better offense, we have a
chance to win a lot of basketball games," Johnson
said.
Oregon State's (6-16, 0-10) 5 p.m. visit tomor
row is a likely place to start. The Beavers, winless
since Dec. 19, are the Pac-10's one cupcake. Stan

ford needs a win to remain just a game behind
UCLA (21-2,9-1) in the conference title hunt.
Hie Bruins, 67-59 winners over Washington
State (17-5, 5-5) in last night's premier league
game, host the schools' one remaining tilt in
March, and thus have the inside track for their
third-straight Pac-10 title. But Stanford is firmly
establishing itself in second, holding a two-game
lead over USC and Arizona.
