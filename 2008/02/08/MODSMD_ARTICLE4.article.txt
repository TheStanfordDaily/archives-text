# JINX: 72-43
## Ducks dominated by both Stanford squads Can't stop the Cardinal 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It wasn't supposed to be this
easy. Not against Oregon, the last
team to beat Stanford, 71-66
some six games ago. Not for the
No. 9 Cardinal, who was sup
posed to have lost its heads in the
hoopla of its first top-10 ranking
in four years.
It was supposed to be more
fun. A back-and-forth battle, we
were promised, with the quickest
Pac-10 team driving the lane at
will on one side of the court and
the biggest team in the league
pounding the paint on the other.
