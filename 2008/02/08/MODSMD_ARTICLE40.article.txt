## the 						joy of cooking 
### MATT BUSH INTERMISSION CULINARY CO-OPER 
Food's always been part of my life, intersect
ing with my family, my identity, my residence
choices and my Stanford-esque nerdiness. 1 grew
up tinkering with and pondering things, and
food was no different: I marveled at the chem
istry. the mechanisms, the ethnic and cultural
nuances. There isn't anything else in life I've ap
proached part scientifically, part creatively and
humorously and part just hungrily, encompass
ing the raw urges, cravings and miscalculations
inherent in having an appetite.
And for as long as 1 can remember, my mom
has always encouraged me to help her out in the
kitchen. Her primal motherly instinct to pass on
(amazing) cooking skills and family recipes has
mostly fallen on me. In the elementary school
days she would ask for my help making scones or
brownies before driving me to friends' houses.
In high school she'd make me chop vegetables
before handing over the car keys. And she
wouldn't just assign this to me and work on
something else; she'd butt in at inconvenient
times, insisting I chop my green onions another
way, and she'd nail me for not being precise
enough with measurements. So naturally, the re
bellious adolescent I am, my cooking habits are
quite the opposite: I cook when I want to cook,
and I'm horribly imprecise about measure
ments. It took an unfortunate incident with red
pepper Hakes to learn my lesson for the latter.
The last two years of high school, I had a
food-service job at a theme park. While Mom
taught me the bright and cheery side of cooking
— organic produce and holiday cookies — this
was the opposite: gooey .soft-serve mix in plastic
bags, deep fryers and food sitting under hot
lamps for hours during idle afternoons. But

there were skills to be gained in this new realm.

Alter two long summers of ice cream, snow
cones, burgers and garlic fries, the differences
were tangible. My hands became calloused

and resistant to oil

burns, metal tongs be
came an extension
of my arm and 1
could make soft-

serve ice cream
cones far prettier
than the pictures

on the menu.
After a mun-

Dane year of eat
ing at Stanford's
dining halls, where

my most ex-

citing culi
nary mo-

ment was

handing a
dropped

spatula
to a

server,
m y
cooking
career
revital
ized as I
drew
into a
co-op
112 or

sophomore
year. The opportunity to
cook for other students was part of what attract
ed me to co-op life, and the precious culinary
quarters of Terra promised new adventures and

lessons to be learned.

It was at Terra that 1 baked with yeast for the
first time, to make pizza dough for our Au
tumn Special Dinner. Yeast is amazing.

After leaving the pizza dough to rise for
an hour, it had tripled in size, nearly ex
panding off the pan. I was fascinated.
I've never made a pet as happy as I
made that yeast — but then again I've
also never stuck a pet in an oven an hour
after feeding it.

Terra's student cooks deliver
an interesting array of
strengths and weaknesses.
We consistently deliver

mouth-watering, inci-

dent-free pizza

pasta.

soups,
salad and

dessert at dinnertime,
and we always have a
pot of coffee going.
But likewise, our inex
perience and misjudg
ment have taken their
toll. Last quarter we
set our kitchen on fire

attempting to fry
falafel —on the night

» ~.. ol our quarterly party,
wcudfl Monte , 7 ru , .
no less. I hanks to a re-

sponsive fire department and a house lull of res
idents eager to clean the mess left in the after
math, the party miraculously proceeded on time.
But to this day, the perpetrator gets teased

whenever she as much as handles a match.
Perhaps the most inspiring part of living in
Terra is the menus student cooks come up with.
While my Mexican and Italian menus certainly
dropped jaws and filled happy stomachs, many
other Terrans' menus have left me feeling inad
equately creative. In just a quarter and a half,
we've eaten a menu themed by the color orange,
a menu entirely vegan hut so hearty you'd never
notice, a computer science themed menu (don't
ask me how), menus themed after high contents
of garlic, ginger or cheese and a menu where
every dish is cooked with some sort of wine or
liquor. Maybe next time I'll submit a Shake
speare menu with baked honey Hamlet (and
some Tofclia stir fry for the vegetarians).

Looking back, I've come a long way
from childhood's plastic dishware to
Terra's campy assortment of jars and
Bridge mugs. A mother's patient train-

ing, a rather greasy first job in high school
and the allure of a co-op kitchen all played their
part in the ripening of my culinary prowess. And
given the creativity and persistence of the stu
dent cooks, it's no surprise that crazy new ways
to carve vegetables or amazing snap conversions
between teaspoons and quarts are everyday oc
currences of co-op cook shifts. Dear readers:
