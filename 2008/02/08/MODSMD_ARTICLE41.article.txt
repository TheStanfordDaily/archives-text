## Champagne Campaign 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION STYLISH SIPPER 
Hello, Stanford children. I know you're proba
bly not reading this right now because half of
you are too busy getting drunk to even improve
your literacy. And, hey, we know why most of
you are here, right? Parents studied here, have
millions of dollars in the bank, etc. So why tire
you gorging yourself on beer'! It's not even Stel
la Artois. It's that cheap-as-piss, taste-like-piss
beer.
Put it down. Put it down right this instant.
Step away from the beer. Yes, you heard me. If
alcohol is your poison of choice — as it is for
millions (okay, this is America, where higher
education is prohibitively expensive, so thou
sands) of college kids — you should at least try
to enjoy it. And don't even pretend to enjoy
beer. I Jnless you're into golden showers. There
are better ways to get drunk, even if kegs of di
luted urine are all they allow at parties. (Be
cause, you know, Stanford kids are upright law
abiding citizens.) And chances are, since daddy
went to GSB and mommy sends you LV bags
for achieving that B+ in Math 51, you can afford
a marginally more expensive option than bad

tasting beer.
Contrary to popular belief, a vodka shot
does not a good drink make. No, that's a recipe
for liver cirrhosis in a cup. Shots are fun, if
you're a high school kid. But now you're older
than that. Or at least you will be. Grow up and
start trying out mixed drinks. Because cocktails
are here to stay. You're not going to walk into
an office dinner and tell the waiter. "A keg of
beer please. And six vodka shots."
No, you are going to walk into a nice restau
rant and ask for a drink that docs not taste like
it's been fermented in your own dorm room.
You are going to ask for a mixed drink. Hold up,
girls (and gays): I'm not talking about Cos
mopolitans, and please stop watching Sex and
the City. It's dead and, like communism or
Huckabee's politics, should stay that way. It's
hard abandoning your mass drinking habits.
But getting slightly buzzed from a tasty cocktail
makes for a far more enjoyable evening. You
and your metabolic system will thank me for
this.
You want to start by deciding if you want a
cocktail that's creamy or not. Personally I like
non-creamy ones, since the alternative is so
heavv on the calories. But if you like creamy

cocktails, you can't go wrong with a Black Russ
ian, a heady concoction of vodka and Kahlua,
or its cousin the White Russian, which has
added cream. My personal creamy favorite is
the Cocksucking Cowboy and not just because
Jake Gyllenhaat is hot: its butterscotch
Schnapps and Baileys formula usually
sweet spot.
Once you've gotten down to the non-creamy
stuff, the real fun begins. As a Stanford student,
you're probably already conversant with
vodka. (By which I mean you're so drunk all of
the time you hold actual conversations with
your bottle.) But why not give other spirits a
try? Rum. for example, can be used in so many
delightful ways. Boring fruitcakes steeped in
the molassescy sweetness of dark rum suddenly
become interesting. Light rum is used in many
summery drinks that are reminiscent of its
Caribbean origins: pifia coladas, daiquiris and,
my personal favorite, mojitos. -112 or an Asian
twist on the mojito, substitute the straw with a
sprig of hollowed out lemongrass — a trick I
learnt in backwater bars in Southeast Asia.
A particularly delicious liquor that's almost
unheard of in America is the fruity English (two
adjectives you often hear together) Pimm's No.

1, usually mixed into a Pimm's Cup with fizzy
lemonade, mint leaves, sliced up citrus, straw
berries and, for that refreshing twist, wedges of
cucumber. In summer, relaxing with a Pimm's
Cup is the perfect way to get smashed while
basking in the sun. Start speaking with a British
accent and you could pretend to be a rich plim
solf-wcaring tennis-playing Etonian — chop
cnop, jolly good and all that.
If all else has failed. 1 know another fizzy al
coholic drink that you can guzzle on: it's called
champagne, and though it's expensive it's prob
ably the most decadent and delightful concoc
tion ever brewed. Mix it with some creme de
cassis and you've got yourself a kir royal. Or just
have it straight, in a lovely champagne glass.
Heck, just drink it directly from the bottle; the
price shouldn't bother you. right? And if it docs,
just remember this: paying eighty bucks a bottle
to get buzzed on champagne beats paying
eighty bucks for a keg and proceeding to play
(horrors of horrors) beer pong. No one takes
you seriously when you're passed out on the
floor in a pool of your own vomit. Except for
maybe your roommate, who's passed out on the
floor in a pool of his/her own vomit too.
