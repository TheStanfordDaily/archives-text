## "Taxi to the Dark Side" worth the fare 
### ALEX GIBNEY INTERMISSION PASSIONATE PASSENGER 
Alex Gibney's documentary "Taxi to the Dark
Side" does not just retell the story of a U.S.-tortured
Afghan taxi driver: it is an incredibly important film
that illustrates how misconceptions and hubris in the
Bush administration flowed down the chain of com
mand, resulting in the sanctioned torture of thou
sands.

The story begins in
December of 2002,
when Dilawar, a taxi
driver, offers three
men a ride and never
returns to his family.
He is instead brought
to Bagram, a U.S.
prison in Afghanistan,
where he is detained
without habeas corpus
(the right to contest
charges brought
against one by a state),
interrogated, beaten
and left dangling from
the ceiling by hand
cuffs. Five days later he
is found dead. The
Army rules his death a
homicide.

You've probably heard of the United Slates tortur
ing detainees but don't really know what the word
means or who these detainees are. Bush would like
you to believe everyone is a 9/11 hijacker in training,
but the sad truth is that Dilawar, like an unknown
proportion of other PUCs (Persons Under Control,
the dehumanizing term Military Police use) was in
nocent. After hearing Dilawar's story, you can't help
but think, "How did this happen?"

While the Army brass dismissed the prisoner
deaths at Bagram as the work of "a few bad apples,"
then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and
other Army officials toured the facilities and gave
tacit approval to the techniques used there (many of
them not appearing in the Army's Field Manuals on
Intelligence Interrogation). The sentiments of these

- - - c - /
high-ranking officials quickly became practice.

The Army captain at Bagram, Carolyn

Wood, was not punished after the pris
oner deaths, but later moved to Iraq
â€” where she helped establish Abu
Ghraib's policies that received so
much attention in 2004.

The film then segues into a discussion
the naval base America wishes it could
shove under the rug: Guantanamo Bay.
We learn that Rumsfeld drafted inter
rogation techniques especially for de
tainees there that, when applied sepa-

rately, were not technically torture but which consti
tuted torture once combined. Illustrating these
methods could have become an exercise in sensa
tionalism, but the film does not succumb to cheesi
ness and uses only minimal effects while displaying
the techniques. (This screening room, strangely, had
props from "Monsters, Inc." in it, so that huge blue
furry thing voiced by John Goodman also watched
what it was like to be waterboarded.)

While the administration included text in the legisla
tion exempting themselves from prosecution, the
Military Police giving the beatings were victims of
the same paradox many concerned Americans find
themselves in today. They did not want to be per
ceived as "anti-troop" or "pro-terrorist" in any way,
so many continued beating known innocents be
cause that's what others did. A shot of President
Bush bragging about killing terrorists at a State of
the Union Address exemplifies this as all the audi
ence members slowly rise after a critical mass of
hawks bolts up.

As 1 left the screening room.
il. .1. 4 * I -J-L *1

the only topic I wish the

film had ex-

plo r e d

more was the history of torture in the
United States and under which contexts
habeas corpus has been suspended in the
past. (The Constitution allows its suspen
sion "in cases of rebellion or invasion.")
This detail is small, though, and what
Wikipedia was made for, anyway. The
much more important accomplishment, I
realized, is that this documentary took a

previously uninformed citizen (me) and turned him
into one concerned about detainees' rights.

Normally after I watch a film pertaining to how our
country is in a stale of wrongdoing, e.g.. The Corpo
ration," "Mardi Gras: Made in China," or "No End
in Sight" (another Alex Gibney film). I'm left with a
sense of sadness that erodes into apathy, allowing me
to get on with my own life. This movie falls into the
same (very good) category, and while 1 will eventual
ly forget the name of the taxi driver, or where he was
imprisoned. 1 will always remember the fact that an
innocent man died at the hands of Uncle Sam.
