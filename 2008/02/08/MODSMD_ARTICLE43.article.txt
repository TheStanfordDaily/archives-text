### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION TART 
Roxy loves food. It does things to her. Tingly things. Hot and bothery things. Un
speakable things (well, unspeakably good things, anyway).

In fact Roxy may prefer food to sex, but don't tell anyone she said that — reputations
are at stake. Many, many, many reputations.

For example, here's something transcendent (and slightly naughty) about a mouthful
of seared fois gras. The gentle warmth on your tongue, the hint of saltiness and the
unctuous texture as the fois melts in your

mouth, leaving it full of sweet and
salty creamy goodness.

Still, while Roxy's toes are curling at the

thought of a mouth full of creamy good
ness, it occurs to her that perhaps the best

way to decide between sex and food is to
combine the two.

Roxy has had experience of some boys (and girls)
who find the idea of combing sex and food a little, well, disgusting. Which, of
course, it is. But only in the really, really good way.

With that said, here are a few of Roxy's favorite food and fornication combos:

Reddi-wip: Roxy can't help but believe that the inventors of Reddi-wip must have been pretty horny when they
came up with America's kinkiest convenience food in 1948. For 60 years whipped cream in a can has been an indis
pensible weapon in the adventurer's toolbox. So many options. Dress yourself in creamy swimsuit and give your

lover something to chew on — well, lick off anyway. Or use it as a quick seduction aid. as in: "Come over

for dessert... Oops I seem to have squirted cream on you, let me lick it 0ff..."

Sushi: Ever since tales a far-eastern restaurants with naked waitresses as serving platters
cropped up, Roxy has been dying to try it out (strapping sushi chefs should email). The thought
of toro nigiri and a handsome young guy or gal armed with chopsticks is a warming one. Of
course, getting hot and bothered with raw fish around could be a little problematic, Roxy sug
gests eating quickly and getting swiftly to the main course.
Carrots: Roxy never ate her vegetables as a little girl. However, recent experiences have
changed her mind. A lot can be done with a carrot in the right hands, an awful lot. And Roxy
has now realized that a well seasoned carrot can be quite delicious. What holds for carrots is
true for zucchini and cucumbers (eggplant too for the particularly hungry) — bananas work
well if you're fan of that salty, sweet combination.

Chocolate: The motherload. Considered as better then sex by those who don't follow Roxy's
advice it's the perfect addition to a naked body. Roxy prefers to work with her homemade
chocolate sauces (she likes it dark) and loves to coat and remove, and coat and remove all over
again. She also suggest investing in a pastry brush for additional tactile titillation to go along with
the chocolaty goodness.

If this isn't enough to get you going, just remember that the key to great cooking is imagination, a
sense of adventure and access to the finest ingredients. And the same holds for sex too.
