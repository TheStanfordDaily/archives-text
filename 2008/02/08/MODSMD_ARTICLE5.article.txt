# Hot start propels Stanford

### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford basketball
teams found joint victories last
night as both the Cardinal men
and women defeated Oregon by
the score of 72-43. The women
played away at ' The Pit" —
Oregon's fabled Mac Arthur
Court — and rolled into their
ninth consecutive win.
Freshman forward Kayla
Pedersen told KZSU that the win
came as a result of cohesive team
efforts at both ends of the floor.
"We had great momentum
and we played really well as a
team," Pedersen said. "I think
our confidence level [made the
offensive difference]. We're
shooting more in practice now. People hit threes at Santa
Clara, and the confidence just rolled into this game."
Roll they did. No. 6 Stanford (21-3,10-2 Pac-10) held
Oregon (10-13,4-8 Pac-10) to just 2 points in the first 10
minutes of play. The Cardinal absolutely dominated the
first half of play, outscoring the Ducks, 46-12.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins said that the team's
newfound defensive fervor has been one of the aspects of
Stanford's collective play that has begun to click in the
last few games.
"It was a great defensive effort tonight, especially the
first half." Wiggins said. "I think we stayed focused, and
the feeling on defense was great. We're not necessarily
known for our aggressive defense, but 1 think tonight we
showed that we can be a great defensive team."
Although the Ducks started with the game's first
points, the Cardinal responded with a 23-0 run. posting 46
points by the end of the half. Oregon responded, barrel
ing out on a 13-4 run after intermission, but a tip-in from
Wiggins at 15:49 halted any further drive from the Ducks.
These points in the paint accounted for just two of Wig
gins' game-high 25, complementing her eight rebounds.
Meanwhile, Oregon's leading scorer, sophomore
guard Lilley Taylor, who averages 13.5 ppg. went only 2-7
from the field, forcing center Nicole Canepa to produce
well above her 4.7 ppg average inside. Canepa finished
with 12 points.
Canepa alone, however, was no match for Stanford's
dominant post duo of Pedersen and sophomore center
Jayne Appel. Pedersen's 17 points and 6 rebounds were
bettered only by Appel's 14 points. 8 rebounds and 5
blocks.
Wiggins said the two were difference-makers not
only in their own play but also in forcing the defense into
mismatches, thereby opening the floor for their team
mates.
"The bigs were absolutely our biggest advantage
tonight," she said. "It's hard [for a team] to focus on one
player when you've got all these great players playing
with you. It really helps just having them in there ... [the
opposition] looks at them before they look at me."
With seven players contributing to the Stanford score
board, Wiggins highlighted that the growing faith the
Stanford players have in one another helps to elevate the
level of play.
"I think we got a lot of momentum from tonight be
cause we have great things to build on and we're realizing
that we're getting better and better," she said. "We're
gaining confidence and trusting each other. It's just excit
ing. Especially as a senior, it's just something you don't
want to end."
Luckily for Wiggins, this streak shouldn't end too soon.
Not surprisingly, the Cardinal is favored in Saturday's 7
p.m. meeting with the Oregon State Beavers (10-13,3-9

Fac-10). While the Beavers hung close to No. 9 California
in a 56-45 defeat last night. Oregon State remains eighth
in the conference. In the Jan. 10 meeting between the Car
dinal and the Beavers, Wiggins was held to just 4 points
hut Appel stepped up in the post, registering 25.
Pedersen said the team is very conscious of the impor
tance of every Pac-10 win as it battles Cal for the confer
ence crown.
"We're taking it game by game, and we know that we
can't lose," she said.
Wiggins agreed, adding that a win on Saturday will
come because of preparation through focus and familiar
ity with the Beavers.
"[To win] we just have to follow our game plan and
know the personnel of Oregon State," Wiggins comment
ed. "They've got great perimeter players, some very ath
letic posts ... So the keys are just knowing them and
going out there like we did today."
