## Blood drives continue with gay men ban SBC opposes San Jose State decision to block blood drives 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
San Jose State University has made head
lines nationwide for banning blood drives in
protest of the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) policies regarding
homosexual male donors. But Stanford
Blood Center (SBC) condemned its neigh
boring college's stance and said campus
blood drives will continue.
San Jose State

President Don
Kassing announced
on Jan. 27 that the
school would prohibit

dioou urives on
campus indefinite
ly in protest of an
FDA policy, dating

back to 1983, which
applies a lifetime ban
on blood donations

from gay men.
SBC condemned
the move in a press
release as "a terribly
misguided tactic that
could have a devastat-

ing impact on the blood
supply and, therefore,
patients in our community."

The policy is part of safety restrictions set
by the FDA that include donation "defer
rals" for those who have traveled interna
tionally. The FDA limits the percentage of
eligible donations in the country to 39 per
cent of the population, according to the SBC.
Homosexual men are considered a risk
group because they continue to be more like
ly to contract and spread HIV then hetero
sexual men.
Both San Jose State and SBC officials
they would prefer a one-year deferral for
homosexual activity, which falls in line with
recommendations from both America's
Blood Centers and the American Red Cross.
The SBC expressed sympathy with the goals
of San Jose, but not its methods.
"We actually met with San Jose State
before they made their announcement and
pled with them to reconsider," said Michele
Hyndman, representative for the Stanford
Blood Center. "We're having a hard enough

time getting blood, and this just
makes our job even more difficult."
Even with blood supply short
ages, Hyndman said that ensuring
the health of donation recipients is
crucial.
"Our biggest concern is supply
ing a safe and adequate blood sup
ply," she said. "But safety comes first
with that. We have to make sure the
blood is as safe as it can possibly
be."
In practical terms, a change to
the one-year deferral would likely
have little impact upon the donor

supply, as any homosexual man who
had sex in the year before trying to
donate would be denied.
"We simply want homosexual
sex to be considered consistent with
other risk factors," Hyndman said.
"We're particularly concerned that
it might seem like discrimination."
The SBC urges a commitment to
more cautious forms of protest.
"As long as there is an increased
risk for homosexual men, the FDA
will have some kind of policy,"
Hyndman said. "We just hope that
with a combined effort of political
pressure and science we might
make them make their policy more
lenient."
