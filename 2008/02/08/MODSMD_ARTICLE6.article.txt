## Blood drives continue with gay men ban SBC opposes San Jose State decision to block blood drives 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
San Jose State University has made head
lines nationwide for banning blood drives in
protest of the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) policies regarding
homosexual male donors. But Stanford
Blood Center (SBC) condemned its neigh
boring college's stance and said campus
blood drives will continue.

President Don
Kassing announced
on Jan. 27 that the
school would prohibit

from gay men.

eligible donations in the country to 39 per
cent of the population, according to the SBC.

sexual men.
Both San Jose State and SBC officials
they would prefer a one-year deferral for
homosexual activity, which falls in line with
recommendations from both America's
Blood Centers and the American Red Cross.
The SBC expressed sympathy with the goals
of San Jose, but not its methods.
"We actually met with San Jose State
before they made their announcement and
pled with them to reconsider," said Michele
Hyndman, representative for the Stanford
Blood Center. "We're having a hard enough
