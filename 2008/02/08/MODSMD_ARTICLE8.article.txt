### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Tly vagina has something
to say."
So begins one of the vignettes in
"The Vagina Monologues," Eve En
sler's award-winning play about fem
ininity, sexuality and genitalia. This
weekend, a dozen Stanford students
will put on the famous production,
and The Stanford Daily sat down in
one of Old Union's conference
rooms for an interview with one of
the actors. Kyrah Daniels'lo, a trans
fer student from Wesleyan, steals the
show as a dominatrix who gives a
monologue called "The Woman Who
Loved to Make Vaginas Happy."
The Stanford Daily: How did you get
involved in "The Vagina Mono
logues?"
kvrah Daniels: I saw it last year, and I
really, really dug it. When I came here
and saw Stanford was doing it. I knew
I had to be in it.
SD: 1 low would you explain your role
to someone who has never seen the
show?
KD: Oh , well, outrageous is an adjec
tive I would use. That's pretty much
what I use to describe the entire per
formance if anyone asks ... The au
dience is sitting in their seats squirm
ing because this woman is talking
about making other women orgasm
and really getting a kick out of it!
She's all about allowing women to
recognize that its OK to make noise
and it's OK for a woman to enjoy her
self sexually. And then she demon
strates all the categories of moans
that's she encountered in her career.
SD: Which one is your favorite
moan?
KD: That's a tough question ... My
personal favorite is the machine gun
moan. I did it in my audition, and the
director later told me: "When I heard
your machine-gun moan. 1 knew it
was you. 1 knew you would be the
moaner." ... The rock star moan is
also a cast favorite.

SI): What's the rock star moan?
KI): (demonstrates, perplexing every
person studying in Old Union.)
SI): Did you make up any new
moans?
KI): We actually took out a moan.
The mountain top moan was sup
posed to sound like a yodel, but that
wasn't working. It was just awkward .
.. We also changed the name of the
college student moan to the Stanford
moan.
SI): Did you practice moaning in
your dorm room?
KI): I was told that 1 kept up my next
door neighbor the night before his
MCATs with my moaning. He was re
lieved to find out I was in "The Vagi
na Monologues."
SI): Are you interested in acting as a
career?
KI): No, not at all! I realized that 1
hate acting for the same reason 1 hate
biology: I hate memorization! I'm re
ally only interested in performances
that really move me. performances
with some sort of political or cultural
message ... That made memorizing
my lines a lot more palatable.
SI): Do your parents know you have
this role?
KI): My mother, who has always
come to all my performances, told me
that she would not be able to make it
to this one. I told her that I under
stood, and it would be OK if she
missed it (laughs). 1 don't think I'll be
telling my father.
SI): When can we see you in the
show?
Kl):Thursday, Friday and Saturday at
8 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium. You
know, there's this stereotype that this
is a show only for — I don't know,
like, men-hating vagina Nazis
(laughs). I think what's cool about
this performance is that people are
realizing that anyone can go see it. It's
just a wild time. And everybody
should come!
No pun intended, Kyrah.
