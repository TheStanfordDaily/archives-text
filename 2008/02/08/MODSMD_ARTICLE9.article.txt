# Striking a balance

### SALMAN RAZZAQUE 
As a strapping young freshman, 1 felt
confused about the social scene at col
lege, especially during Mardi Gras week.
Should I work hard, or party harder? Do
I hang out with my dorm or with my
friends? Just when it seemed it was all too
much, an answer to my worries appeared:
the Asian American Activities Center's
(A3C) Social Scene and You Panel.
The panel, which took place in Old
Union's Clubhouse, featured Christine
Chung '09, Solomon Lee '10 and Yang
Lor 08.7he panelists shared information
about themselves and their sixial lives. 1
sat and listened with rapt attention in the
hopes that these panelists would shed
some light.
A well-known partier, Chung lives by
the motto "work hard, party hard." In
high school. Chung was a cheerleader
and worked at Abcrcrombie and Fitch.
She describes her life as the "typical O.C.
lifestyle."
"My lifestyle from high school contin
ued to college as everyone expected me
to become a sorority girl and I accepted
that," Chung said. Indeed, Chung joined
the alpha Kappa Delta Phi sorority at
Stanford.
Lee, on the other hand, leads a more
divided social life. Growing up in the pre
dominantly-Asian Cupertino, Calif., Lee
belonged to a tightly knit community
that helped him grow as a person. De
spite joining a fraternity, Lee chooses to
abstain from drinking.
"I don't drink. When others drink, I
feel drunk and I manage to have a good

time," Lee said.
While Chung and Lee focus heavily
on the party scene, Lor prefers communi
ty service.
"Growing up in my neighborhood. I
enjoyed engaging in social activism to
help poor folks," Lor said.
The panelists emphasized the distinc
tion between social activities and recre
ational activities.
"Most people don't realize that party
ing can be really taxing. So whenever I
want to have free time, I prefer reading
Wikipedia articles, playing pool and
Facebook-ing," Chung said.
Ix>r added that for many people free
time often involves more introverted ac
tivities. He believes that such activities
are necessary to lead a healthy social life.
The issue of changing one's social be
havior depending on with which social
group one is hanging out was also dis-

"I don't drink. When others
drink, I feel drunk and I manage
to have a good time."

cussed hv the panelists.
"1 often act differently around differ
ent groups of people. It all depends on
context," Lee said. Chung added that
such a change could also occur when peo
ple have multiple groups of friends.
Ending the panel discussion on a fit
ting note, Chung emphasized an impor
tant point.
"Going abroad helped me realized
that there are tons of people out there,"
she said. "So there is definitely an appro
priate social group and lifestyle that can
suit everybody."
As I walked out of Old Union, I won
dered if the panel had provided answers
to my questions. In front of Old Union, a
flyer looked promising.
