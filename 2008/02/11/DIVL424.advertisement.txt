When Did You Know
How DID YOU KNOW
You Were In Love?
This week, on a very special Valentines Day edition
of the Stanford Storytelling Project hear scores
of Stanford students answer this question
and describe the moment they knew. Also hear
the story of St. Valentine, the definitive analysis
of what causes love, and, of course,
love poems and love songs.
A FULL HOUR OF LOVE.
Tune in Monday February 11th at 6pm on 90.1 KZSU,
subscribe to our podcast on iTunes, or hear the show at:
storytelling.stanford.edu
The Stanford Storytelling Project is made possible by the generous support of
The Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts, Stanford Continuing
Studies, The Stanford Oral Communication Program,
and the Hume Writing Center.
