AUGUSTA. Maine (AP) — Barack Ohama de
feated Hillary Rodham Clinton in Maine presiden
tial caucuses Sunday, grabbing a majority of dele
gates as the state's Democrats overlooked the snowy
weather and turned out in heavy numbers for munic
ipal gatherings.
Democrats in 420 Maine towns and cities were
deciding how the state's 24 delegates will be allotted
at the party's national convention in August. Despite
the weather, turnout was "incredible," party execu
tive director Arden Manning said.
With 99 percent of the participating precincts re
porting, Obama led in state delegates elected over
C1int0n,2,079 to 1,396, with 18 uncommitted.
Obama exulted in his recent victories in Maine
and elsewhere, telling a crowd of 18,000 Sunday
evening in Virginia Beach, Va.. that "we have won on
the Atlantic Coast, we have won on the Gulf Coast,
we have won on the Pacific Coast" and places in be
tween.
Obama won 15 of Maine's delegates to the na
tional convention and Clinton won nine. In the over
all race for the nomination, Clinton leads with 1,136,
including separately chosen party and elected offi
cials known as superdelegates. Obama has 1,108.
The voting came a day after Obama and Clinton
made personal appeals here, and after Obama
picked up wins in Louisiana, Nebraska and Washing
ton.
Organizers had expected heavy participation at
the caucuses, but snow was falling and gusting winds

hit as many of the gatherings were scheduled.
The weather didn't appear to have hurt turnout.
Caucuses started late in Bangor and several other lo
cations across the state because so many people
showed up that they were lined up outside the doors.
In Maine's largest city, Democrats carrying
"Obama" and "Hillary" signs waited to get into the
citywide caucus at Portland High School in separate
lines that snaked nearly three city blocks in opposite
directions.
Colin Johnson, an Obama supporter in Portland,
said the Illinois senator is not a typical politician.
"I'm convinced he's a once-in-a-generation leader."
he said.
"He's young and energetic and Washington and
the White House could benefit from some fresh air,"
said Joe Lewis, another Obama supporter.
But Tony Donovan said Obama can use some
more seasoning. Donovan was supporting Clinton
because she, like him. was a baby boomer who
shared similar values and because she has the expe
rience and the team to lead in Washington.
"Obama's a great guy. He'll be great in eight
years," Donovan said. "He doesn't have the experi
ence in the Senate. He doesn't have the experience
in Washington. He's not ready."
A line waited to get into Augusta's caucus as Gov.
John Baldacci, a Clinton supporter, addressed the
crowd of a couple hundred at the city's Cony High
School. Asked why he decided to wait in line to par
ticipate, John Brandt said. "Getting rid of Republi
cans, once and for all."
Though Maine's national delegate count is small,
Clinton and Obama, along with surrogates, came to

the state Saturday as their campaigns drew tighter
after Super Tuesday.
Thousands of people packed the Bangor Audito
rium to hear Obama on Saturday and hundreds
more who weren't allowed inside greeted him as he
arrived. People also were stopped at the door as
Clinton held a town hall-style gathering nearby at
the University of Maine at Orono. She later stopped
in Lewiston.
Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, and husband. Bill,
also visited, while Obama supporter Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts campaigned in two cities
in the days before the vote.
Both campaigns hit Maine heavily with radio and
TV advertising, and voters' homes were being called
with pre-taped messages in support of both candi
dates. On Sunday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval
Patrick. Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the 2004 Democ
ratic presidential candidate, visited Maine caucuses
on Obamas behalf.
On Clinton's side, Baldacci. Massachusetts Rep.
Jim McGovern and New York Rep. Gregory Meeks
campaigned.
The high level of excitement across the state con
trasted with earlier expectations that the post-Super
Tuesday timing of the caucuses would dampen voter
interest.
A competitive GOP race a week earlier also
helped to enliven interest in the Maine Republicans'
nonbinding caucuses, which were won by Mitt Rom
ney. He dropped out of the race last week, making it
likely that Arizona Sen. John McCain would become
the GOP nominee.
