DILI, East Timor (AP) — Rebel
soldiers shot and wounded East Timor
President Jose Ramos-Horta and
opened fire on the prime minister Mon

day as part of a failed coup in the re
cently independent nation, officials
said.
Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace laure
ate, was wounded in the stomach but in
stable condition, while Prime Minister
Xanana Gusmao escaped the attack on
his motorcade unhurt.
Army spokesman Maj. Domingos da
Camara said notorious rebel leader Al
fredo Reinado was killed in the attack
against the home of Ramos-1 lorta, while
one of the president's guards also died.

"I consider this incident a coup at
tempt against the state by Reinado and
it failed," Gusmao told reporters. "This
government will guarantee security
and development will continue."
Monday's violence plunged the tiny
country into fresh uncertainty after a
flare-up in violence in 2006 killed 37
people, displaced more than 150,000
others and led to the collapse of the
government. Security in the country
has since been overseen by the United
Nations.
UN says 12,000 terrified
refugees flee Sudan's Darfur
for Chad after airstrikes

GENEVA (AP) — Up to 12,000
refugees fled Sudan's Darfur region to
neighboring Chad over the weekend
following air strikes by the Sudanese
military and thousands more may be
coming, the U.N. refugee agency said
Sunday.
The agency was bringing emergency
assistance to the Chad border where
the Darfur refugees were giving de
tailed descriptions of air attacks Friday
on three West Darfur towns.

The refugees are "destitute and ter
rified," said Helene Caux, spokes
woman for the U.N. High Commis
sioner for Refugees headquartered in
Geneva. "They told of their villages
being looted and burned, and encir
cled by militia." Most of the new
refugees in Chad are men and they
told the U.N. that thousands of women
and children are on their way, Caux
added.
Sudan's Arab-dominated govern
ment has been accused of unleashing
more attacks by its allied janjaweed
militias, which are accused of commit
ting the worst atrocities against Dar
fur's ethnic African communities. At
least 2(X),(XX) people have been killed
and 2.5 million displaced since the vio
lence began five years ago.
On Friday, Sudanese helicopter
gunships and fixed-wing aircraft
bombed the towns of Sirba. Sileia and
Abu Suruj while striking at rebel
forces, which have been trying to con
solidate their positions in West Darfur.
The Sudanese army said its attacks
forced rebels to retreat into neighbor
ing Chad, a provocative accusation at a
time of escalating tension between the
two countries. Both nations accuse
each other of hosting hostile rebel
groups, allegations that became even
more sensitive after Chadian rebels at
tacked Chad's capital last weekend.
