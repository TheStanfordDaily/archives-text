### MOHAMMAD ALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an impassioned speech at Kresge
Auditorium last night. University of Michigan
Islamic Studies Prof. Sherman Jackson spoke
about the contentious image of Islam and the
role of Shariah law in the modern world. The
event, titled "Laying Down the Shariah Law:
Democracy or Theocracy?" was the third of
four events in the series "Jihad to Reform: The

Struggle to Define Our Faith."
Shariah is a body of Islamic law primarily
based on the Quran and the Sunnah — sayings
and actions of the Prophet Muhammad.
In the past few months. Shariah law has
jumped into the spotlight because of a chain of
astonishing legal rulings in Muslim nations.
In November, the Sudanese government
arrested and convicted a British schoolteacher
for allowing her students to name a class teddy
bear "Muhammad." Earlier that month, a

teenage woman who was gang-raped along
with a male friend was sentenced to j;iil in a
Saudi court for being in the presence of a man
who was not her relative. When she challenged
her punishment publicly, the court increased
her sentence.
Given these events that have baffled the
Western world. Professor Jackson's lecture

provided insight into the role of
Islam in the state. Jackson talked
about the minority of Muslims who
accept only the Quran as a legitimate
source of law and refuse to acknowl
edge man-made legal rules. He
emphasized that although the Quran
is a guide for Muslims, it does not
provide laws for all the minor details
of life.
"You are not going to find speed
limits in the Quran." he said.
Jackson also stressed the need to
recognize American Islam as distinct
from, but just as legitimate as, Islam
in the Middle East.
"We talk about an Islam that is
not real in terms of the way it is con
cretized in the community, but rather
as an abstraction that hovers some
where over the Atlantic," he said. "I
want to break out of these limited
spaces and talk about Islam in the
very concrete context of America."
According to a report by the Pew
Research Center, approximately 35
percent of Muslims residing in
America were also born in the
United States. Given the substantial
number of native-born Muslims,
Jackson stressed that "questions of
solidarity and empathy of the
Muslim people with the American
state will be very different when
comparing indigenous Muslims to
immigrants who come from another
land
