role of Shariah law in the modern world. The

four events in the series "Jihad to Reform: The

Struggle to Define Our Faith."
Shariah is a body of Islamic law primarily
based on the Quran and the Sunnah — sayings
and actions of the Prophet Muhammad.
In the past few months. Shariah law has
jumped into the spotlight because of a chain of
astonishing legal rulings in Muslim nations.
In November, the Sudanese government
arrested and convicted a British schoolteacher
for allowing her students to name a class teddy
bear "Muhammad." Earlier that month, a

teenage woman who was gang-raped along
with a male friend was sentenced to j;iil in a
Saudi court for being in the presence of a man
who was not her relative. When she challenged
her punishment publicly, the court increased
her sentence.
Given these events that have baffled the
Western world. Professor Jackson's lecture
