## Editorial Board A
						motion in favor of a centralized debate forum 
### 
Stanford University hosts numerous in
fluential and controversial speakers on
a regular basis.The campus fosters a cli
mate of spirited discussion and debate. But
what the University lacks is a united venue
to facilitate such discourse. This editorial
board believes that Stanford would greatly
benefit from a centralized, debate society,
similar to the Oxford Union, where speakers
and students could gather to debate pressing
issues of the day.
While the University already boasts the
talented and active Stanford Debate Soci
ety. the proposed organization would func
tion quite differently from the current insti
tution. which is primarily concerned with in
tercollegiate competition. Instead of pro
moting intercollegiate debate, Stanford's
new society would provide a "chamber de
bate" aspect, a centralized forum for the
same speakers who are already invited to
campus.
I"he Oxford Union, founded in 1823,
considers itself "the world's most presti
gious debating society," and has been
called the "last bastion of free speech in
the Western world" by former British
Prime Minister and one-time Oxford
Union President Harold Macmillan. No
table speakers include peace activists,
politicians of diametrically opposed
philosophies, athletes and pop stars. Its
members are a "Who's Who" of British
and international politics; the late Benazir
Bhutto was Union President in 1977.
Beyond the impressive array of speakers,
the Union distinguishes itself through its
commitment to free speech and debates of
controversial ideas. 11 boasts ofbeing on "the
cutting edge of controversy;" recently ex
tended invitations to convicted Holocaust
denier David Irving and racist British Na
tional Party leader Nick Griffin sparked
fierce protests and demonstrations. Among
the thousands of motions the Union has de

bated was the controversial '* ITiis House re
grets the founding of America" — a May
2007 motion that was ultimately voted
down.
The tremendous impact of a venue such
as the Oxford Union cannot be understated.
Some argue that the Union's famous
motion, "This House will under no circum
stances fight for King and Country ." encour
aged Hitler to invade Europe. The over
whelming motion that, "This House would
say 'Yes' to Europe" is considered to have
iniluenced the vote for the U.K. to join the
European Economic Community in 1975.
The firestorm of debate surrounding the re
cent Irving and Griffin invitations was cov
ered extensively in the BBC,Times of Lon
don and other mainstream media sources.
Coverage of "electoral malpractice, abuse of
power and sexual harassment" in the
Union's latest presidential election —an
election contested between undergraduate
college students — rivaled CNN's reporting
on Hillary-Obama catfights.
This editorial is not merely an ode to
Oxford's institutions, but rather a call for a
similar association on our own campus.
Stanford already hosts many influential
and controversial speakers, such as climate
change skeptic Siegfried Fred Singer and
Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi. The
presence of both speakers on campus
sparked heated controversy, and the
Ashrawi visit even led to a "die-in" at the
Intersection of Death.
And of course, there's the ongoing con
troversy over former Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld's appointment to the
Hoover Institution as a Distinguished Visit
ing Fellow. In addition to ASSU bills and stu
dent rallies in White Plaza, the Stanford De
bate Team addressed this maelstrom by
hosting a debate in which the resolution.
