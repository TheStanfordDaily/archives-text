## School'n the youth right 
### 
America is feeling mighty belligerent
these days, currently at war with
Iraq and Afghanistan, with another
10 countries pinned up on the hit-list. We
are also at war economically, vying for su
premacy with rising powers like China,
India and that perennial economic dark
horse Canada, whose currency rivals if not
surpasses the beautiful American dollar.
You know America is in the shits when you
can't freely interchange Canadian currency
for toilet paper.
In order to emerge victorious from the
coming battles, America must not only
dominate the enemy physically, but intel
lectually as well. And the best way to do
that is to school our kids right. You look at
the educational system today and it's a
mess: the youth are engaged in tomfoolery,
hanky panky and general shamdoozlin...
anything but learning. Can't say I blame
'em — it's tough to develop an intellectual
appetite with the dry and flavorless materi
al you're fed in school.
Well, this columnist has a solution: com
bining youth energy with palatable, ap
proachable subject material that the kids
can relate to and respect. In my system, pop
ular music would be the main curricular
component. That's right — if the youth are
willing to memorize the lyrics from every
Snoop Dogg song, and pay $2(X) for his con
certs. why not channel that enthusiasm into
learning?
Desks would be replaced with beanbags
and comfy couches. Instead of buying text
books, we would get MP3s and big-ass
speakers to blast 'em. Teachers would get
certification in the general qualities of being
tight,cool, ill,sick, dope or down. Stuffy,self
important honor codes would be replaced
with snappy mottos like "Don't playa hate,
participate."
The curriculum would be rigorous but
enjoyable. Math would be taught by LiT Jon:
"3-6-9, damn you fine." Q-tip would handle
ecology:"My style iskinda phat,reminiscent
of a whale." The kids would be instilled with
entrepreneurial ambition by Warren G: "1
want it all — money, fast cars, diamond
rings.gold chains and champagne,shit, every
damn thang."

American history would be extensively
covered by Too Short: "What? He said
what? The president did what? Aw man.
that's, that's all good baby. He got rid of the
playa haters too? Aw man, we gotta declare
this a national holiday, we goin to call this.
Playa's holiday!"
Instead of bothering with Shakespeare,
kids would study Tupac to understand
drama and complex characters. Tupac can
be a kind man in one song:"Baby don't cry.
gotta keep yo head up. even when the road
is hard, don't give up," and an angry man in
another: "Kill all ofyalT motherf*@&%#s
FU&% you die SLOW moth
erf *@&%#s."
Although this curriculum might nuance
chemistry to have an undue focus on nar
cotics, at least sexual education would be
top-notch. Girls would learn fromTIXY'No,
I don't want no scrubs, a scrub is a guy who
can't get no love from me." Ying Yang Twins
"Wait" would teach guys about their chang
ing bodies and mentalities. Don't forget
Kanye West's "New Workout Plan" for a
thorough physical education.
'Ihis is an educational system where the
youth wouldn't waste time deconstructing
pansy poetry, trying to uncover elusive
things like iambic pentameter. We'd feel the
iambic-ness from the magic that is A Tribe
Called Quest. Why bother the kids with
trigonometry when they can learn to "keep
the hoes in check?" Yessir. this system ought
to set our country back on track. Then we
can rest easy knowing that America will
keep "crushin' competition like Italians on
grapes."
