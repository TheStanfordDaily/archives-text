## Valentine's Day: A philosophical debate 
### 
Many moons ago, 1 adored Valen
tine's Day. I would spend hours de
ciding which of the cards in my
shiny 32-pack of Snoopy Valentines was
worthy of the boy I liked. Was "Be Mine?"
too direct? Maybe "You're Heavenly"
would be more subtle. These are the ques
tions I lovingly agonized over for years,
until I realized that most boys only opened
the cards that had candy in them.
Sigh.
Now Valentine's Day means very little to
me. It means there are more well-intentioned
sorority girls and smiley a capella groups ac
costing me in White Plaza than usual. And it
means that when I go to Safeway to replenish
my RA candy bowl.everything is now conve
niently sold in the shape of a heart.
So in an attempt to get myself thinking
about Valentine's Day again. I decided to
talk to the wisest people I know: SLE kids
and preschoolers.
I questioned SLE kids because they are
near and dear to my heart. Dear because I
was a SLE kid. Near because I live with
them (read: convenient). And preschoolers

because, in my world, intelligence is direct
ly proportional to the amount of paste you
have on your face.
What follows are some of my favorite
answers.
Question #1: What is Valentine's Day?
PRESCHOOLER: A day where we get
cards and eat chocolate!
PRESCIIOOLER: It's a kind of day of rest.
Of relaxing.
PRESCHOOLER: Me and my mama make
cards for everyone with pink and purple
hearts on them!
SLE KID: The day 1 forget about on pur

pose.
SLE KID:A day where you can resent pub
lic displays of affection and not feel bad
about it.
SLE KID:A celebration of one more year
of being single.
PRESCHOOLER: I get to wear red tights
and a dress!!
PRESCIIOOLER: It's a day of love!
SLE KID: I celebrate my family and friends
as well as the potential of love.
SLE KID: We don't celebrate love, we cele
brate the absence of loneliness.
CONSCIOUSLY PRETENTIOUS SLE
KID: We celebrate the profound potency of
avaricious market forces, naive con
sumerism. historical obfuscation. manufac
tured affection and the lamentable exclu
sivity of the hetero-normative paradigm.
An exchange at the snack table:
ME: What do we think we celebrate on
Valentine's Day?

HYPER LITTLE BOY. Cake and
muffins!
ME: ...what about love?
HYPER LITTLE BOY: And pizza!
And cookies!
LITTLE GIRL (whispering into my
ear): 1 have cookies at home...
maybe I'll invite him over.
Whether with a smirk or a smile,
the word "love" was thrown around
a lot in conjunction with Valentine's
Day. Which led me to my next in
quiry...
Question #2: So what is love, sweet
child?
PRESCHOOLER: It's getting
ready to have children!
PRESCHOOLER: Getting mar
ried!
ACTUALLY PRETENTIOUS
SLE KID: A potential compatibili

ty that's romanticized by pop cul
ture and a set of attitudes, beliefs
and practices directed at usually
but not always at another person in
which one feels deep admiration
and or sexual attraction.
PRESCiiOOLER: 1 love every sin
gle person 1 know!
JADED SLE ALUM: Love is what
happens when you mistake two
things you know to be separate for
the same thing...
SLE KID: That's like asking me
about God.
SLE KID: Love is ineffable.
JADED SLE ALUM WHO
WON T SHUT UP: ...and a
breakup is when you realize those
two things actually are separate. It's
a moment of clarity.
PRESCHOOLER: I love panda
bears and zebras because they are
black and white!
PRESCHOOLER: 1 love my
mommy! She is on a big plane!
SLE KlD(s): What is love?
(singing) "Baby don't hurt me,
don't hurt me, no more."

PROFOUND PRESCHOOLER:
Love...is love!
Even though people had trouble
defining love, they still had strong
ideas about how to show it.
Question #3: How do you show
people you love them?
MOST PRESCHOOLERS: With
hugs and kisses!!!
HYPER PRESCHOOLERS: With
CHOCt >1 All 1
CUTEST PRESCHOOLER: I love
my puppy Madison and my cat!
SLE' KID. Buy them lots of expen
sive shit.
SLE KID.To give freely of yourself.
SLE KID: With kisses and smiles
and PASSION.
SLE KID: By being persistent.
SLE KID: Give them things they
didn't know thev wanted.
PRESCHOOLER. I never hurt
them!!
EMO SLE KID: Just rend your
chest asunder and cast your throb

bing heart at the feet of the one you
love. Also, cry.
PRESCHOOLER Tickle them!
What you should know,
PRESCHOOLER, is that when I
was little, / used to tickle my blue
eyed. blonde-haired imp of a
crush to show him how much I
loved him. He later pushed me
down the playground slide after
he spat on it. I stopped loving him
soon after.
Anyways.
So maybe it wasn't the best idea
to talk to my residents about love
while they were working on a paper
about Dante's Inferno. And maybe
1 should have waited until after
snack time to talk to a bunch ot
squirmy four year-olds.
Needless to say. I got some inter
esting food for thought. Heart
shaped or not.

PRESCHOOLER: I get to wear red tights
and a dress!!
PRESCIIOOLER: It's a day of love!
SLE KID: I celebrate my family and friends
as well as the potential of love.
SLE KID: We don't celebrate love, we cele
brate the absence of loneliness.
CONSCIOUSLY PRETENTIOUS SLE
KID: We celebrate the profound potency of
avaricious market forces, naive con
sumerism. historical obfuscation. manufac
tured affection and the lamentable exclu
sivity of the hetero-normative paradigm.
An exchange at the snack table:
ME: What do we think we celebrate on
Valentine's Day?


Natalie
Jabbar
HYPER LITTLE BOY. Cake and
muffins!
ME: ...what about love?
HYPER LITTLE BOY: And pizza!
And cookies!
LITTLE GIRL (whispering into my
ear): 1 have cookies at home...
maybe I'll invite him over.
Whether with a smirk or a smile,
the word "love" was thrown around
a lot in conjunction with Valentine's
Day. Which led me to my next in
quiry...
Question #2: So what is love, sweet
child?
PRESCHOOLER: It's getting
ready to have children!
PRESCHOOLER: Getting mar
ried!
ACTUALLY PRETENTIOUS
SLE KID: A potential compatibili

ty that's romanticized by pop cul
ture and a set of attitudes, beliefs
and practices directed at usually
but not always at another person in
which one feels deep admiration
and or sexual attraction.
PRESCiiOOLER: 1 love every sin
gle person 1 know!
JADED SLE ALUM: Love is what
happens when you mistake two
things you know to be separate for
the same thing...
SLE KID: That's like asking me
about God.
SLE KID: Love is ineffable.
JADED SLE ALUM WHO
WON T SHUT UP: ...and a
breakup is when you realize those
two things actually are separate. It's
a moment of clarity.
PRESCHOOLER: I love panda
bears and zebras because they are
black and white!
PRESCHOOLER: 1 love my
mommy! She is on a big plane!
SLE KlD(s): What is love?
(singing) "Baby don't hurt me,
don't hurt me, no more."

PROFOUND PRESCHOOLER:
Love...is love!
Even though people had trouble
defining love, they still had strong
ideas about how to show it.
Question #3: How do you show
people you love them?
MOST PRESCHOOLERS: With
hugs and kisses!!!
HYPER PRESCHOOLERS: With
CHOCt >1 All 1
CUTEST PRESCHOOLER: I love
my puppy Madison and my cat!
SLE' KID. Buy them lots of expen
sive shit.
SLE KID.To give freely of yourself.
SLE KID: With kisses and smiles
and PASSION.
SLE KID: By being persistent.
SLE KID: Give them things they
didn't know thev wanted.
PRESCHOOLER. I never hurt
them!!
EMO SLE KID: Just rend your
chest asunder and cast your throb

bing heart at the feet of the one you
love. Also, cry.
PRESCHOOLER Tickle them!
What you should know,
PRESCHOOLER, is that when I
was little, / used to tickle my blue
eyed. blonde-haired imp of a
crush to show him how much I
loved him. He later pushed me
down the playground slide after
he spat on it. I stopped loving him
soon after.
Anyways.
So maybe it wasn't the best idea
to talk to my residents about love
while they were working on a paper
about Dante's Inferno. And maybe
1 should have waited until after
snack time to talk to a bunch ot
squirmy four year-olds.
Needless to say. I got some inter
esting food for thought. Heart
shaped or not.
