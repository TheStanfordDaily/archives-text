## Valentine's Day: A philosophical debate 
### 
Many moons ago, 1 adored Valen
tine's Day. I would spend hours de
ciding which of the cards in my
shiny 32-pack of Snoopy Valentines was
worthy of the boy I liked. Was "Be Mine?"
too direct? Maybe "You're Heavenly"
would be more subtle. These are the ques
tions I lovingly agonized over for years,
until I realized that most boys only opened
the cards that had candy in them.
Sigh.
Now Valentine's Day means very little to
me. It means there are more well-intentioned
sorority girls and smiley a capella groups ac
costing me in White Plaza than usual. And it
means that when I go to Safeway to replenish
my RA candy bowl.everything is now conve
niently sold in the shape of a heart.
So in an attempt to get myself thinking
about Valentine's Day again. I decided to
talk to the wisest people I know: SLE kids
and preschoolers.
I questioned SLE kids because they are
near and dear to my heart. Dear because I
was a SLE kid. Near because I live with
them (read: convenient). And preschoolers

because, in my world, intelligence is direct
ly proportional to the amount of paste you
have on your face.
What follows are some of my favorite
answers.
Question #1: What is Valentine's Day?
PRESCHOOLER: A day where we get
cards and eat chocolate!
PRESCIIOOLER: It's a kind of day of rest.
Of relaxing.
PRESCHOOLER: Me and my mama make
cards for everyone with pink and purple
hearts on them!
SLE KID: The day 1 forget about on pur

pose.
SLE KID:A day where you can resent pub
lic displays of affection and not feel bad
about it.
SLE KID:A celebration of one more year
of being single.
PRESCHOOLER: I get to wear red tights
and a dress!!
PRESCIIOOLER: It's a day of love!
SLE KID: I celebrate my family and friends
as well as the potential of love.
SLE KID: We don't celebrate love, we cele
brate the absence of loneliness.
CONSCIOUSLY PRETENTIOUS SLE
KID: We celebrate the profound potency of
avaricious market forces, naive con
sumerism. historical obfuscation. manufac
tured affection and the lamentable exclu
sivity of the hetero-normative paradigm.
An exchange at the snack table:
ME: What do we think we celebrate on
Valentine's Day?
