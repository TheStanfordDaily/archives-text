Don't demonize Israeli citizens
To the editor,
George Stevens' recent article ("Posters,
pettiness and Palestine," Feb. 7] demonstrates
the disconnect from the real world that per
meates most discussion about Israel at Stan
ford.
Rather than dissect the individual points
— the trivialization of the security barrier as
an entity that has saved not dozens, but prob
ably tens of thousands of lives; the mischarac
terization of the conflict as a civil rights protest
by Arabs rather than as a war; and the refusal
to analyze Israeli and the Palestinian entity's
actions with the same moral standards — I

would like to discuss the divisive elements he
introduces into the debate.
Stevens states that the settlements which
are illegal are there only because "God's law is
supposedly higher than human rights law."
The statement is dismissive and accusatory to
wards those living in the West Bank. In fact,
the 300,000 Jewish residents of the West Bank
are not all religious. Some live in "security set
tlements,"' some in economically affordable
settlements, and some in Jewish Jerusalem.
Evacuation of this population would be more
devastating in humanitarian terms than Hur
ricane Katrina and would only bring a theo
cratic anti-Semitic regime to power (Hamas)
that would be within miles ofTel Aviv. The sug

gestion that it would lead to peace is a pipe
dream.
While everyone of goodwill hopes for an
historic reconciliation between Arabs and
Jews, the path therein is not to demonize or
ridicule Israeli citizens that were sent to their
homes by their official government.There are
no shortcuts, and Arab leaders still have the
burden of fighting terror and ending incite
ment, neither of which has been done. Until
that happens, it would be foolhardy for any Is
raeli government to countenance Stevens'
ideas.
