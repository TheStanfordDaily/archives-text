# STUDENT LIFE
## Speed dating event allows same-sex matches 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Over 50 people packed into
Lyman lounge this Saturday for
Stanford's sixth annual grad student
speed-dating event. For the first time
in its history, the event's awkward
ness and Altoids were available to
grad students interested in same-sex
dates.
Joanna Lankester, a Community
Associate (C'A) in Lyman, planned
the event along with other graduate
C As.
Including the same-sex speed dat
ing option in this year's event "was
kind of a no-brainer," Lankester said.
"We don't normally have events that
exclude a certain group of students,
so why were we having it that way? It
didn't make sense."
Lankester and other CAs worked
with the LGBT Community
Resource Center to advertise to
LGBT email lists, but Lankester said
the turnout for same-sex speed
daters was small. Just four men
signed up to date other men. and
there was no lesbian speed dating

this year, since only one woman
signed up to date other women.
"I had to email her hack and say,
I'm sorry,'" Lankester said.
Sexual orientation aside,
Lankester said speed dating gives
participants a certain comfort level
not found in conventional dating.
Speed dating couples chat for 3-5
minutes, and then each person pri
vately checks a box indicating
whether or not they liked their
date. After the event, organizers
notify couples where both parties

checked 'yes."
Lankester explained that the
event is always well-attended.
"It's been a huge success, always
very popular." she said. "Our former
CA had one couple who had gotten
married come back to thank her
later."
Lankester said organizing the
event was tricky, because Stanford
grad students are overwhelmingly
male.
"1 panicked because at first we
had four women and 25 men sign
up," Lankester said. She said she
stopped putting out event flyers in

the engineering department and
started flvering women's bathrooms.
"I thought for walking in all these
smelly bathrooms we'd better have a
few women apply," she said. "But it
worked out in the end."
"Stanford has a lot of interesting
and intelligent people," Lankester
added. "It's nice if they can get to
know each other through this event,
whether they do become a couple or
just make some new friends on cam
pus."
