21.30-18). the Cardinal fell to No. 7 Cal State North

kills out of 10 attempts for a .600 hit

The first game saw the Cardinal
and the Gauchos nearly neck-and
neck until about midway through,
when kills from MeLachlin and Shoji
in combination with a number of
Gaucho attack errors brought the
score to 20-16. The Cardinal contin
ued to rally, bringing the score to 24-20
on a kill by Romero. A Gauchos at
tack error prompted a UCSB timeout
at 25-20. Following the timeout, attack
and service errors on both sides
rounded out the game at 30-25.
In game two. the Gauchos took an
early lead at 4-0, and Iheo Brunner
posted five kills in the next eight ral
lies to extend the lead to 9-4.The Gau
chos never looked back, with Brun
ner, Scott Slaughter, and Jeff Menzel
dominating at the net. UCSB posted a
.375 hitting percentage that game, by
far its best of the night. The game
ended at 30-23, evening the match
score at 1 -1.
Game three saw the Cardinal take
an early lead at 4-3. A pair of kills from
Ceran and a Guachos error brought
the score to 7-3, prompting a UCSB
timeout. The Gauchos rallied back to

Henrickson, and a service ace from
Romero brought the score to 20-11,

ended the game at 30-23, giving the
Cardinal a 2-1 match lead.
Just as in the third game, the Cardi

and never relinquished it. Romero
and Ceran dominated, with Romero
posting nine kills and Ceran seven.
The Cardinal rounded out the game at
a resounding 30-18, taking the match
3-1.
Saturday, however,played out a lit
tle differently. Cal State Northridge
played exceptionally well, averaging

more than a .300 hitting percentage in
every game. Cody Loe posted 14 kills
in just 20 attempts for a .MX) hitting
percentage. Eric Vance had 12 kills at
.391, and Kevin McKniff had eight at
.636.The team also had 10 total blocks.
Stanford, in contrast, was not hit
ting well at all, averaging just .148 on
the night. The team was led by
Romero, who had 12 kills. McLachin
had eight kills, and Ceran and Hen
drickson each had six.
Games one and two were rough
for the Cardinal, as the Matadors at
tacked throughout and the Cardinal
committed a number of attack errors.
The Matadors won both easily, 30-19
and 30-18.
In the third game, the Cardinal
looked to be rebounding. Kills by
Henrickson and Romero gave the
team an early lead at 4-3, but the
Matadors rallied back to tie the score
at 5-5, 8-8, and again at 10-10. A kill
from McLachlin gave the Cardinal
another lead at 12-10, but the Mata
dors again tied the game at 14-14.
Northridge scored next to take the
lead, and held it for most of the rest of
the way. rounding out the victory with
a kill from McKniff,3o-27,and sweep
ing the match 3-0.
Stanford returns to action against
the University of the Pacific next Fri
day in Stockton, Calif. The following
