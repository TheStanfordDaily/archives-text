# LADIES KEEP ROLLING
## Stanford cruises to tenth straight victory 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal is rolling, and recent
ly, no team has been able to stop it.
Stanford women's basketball hasn't
lost in a month — the defense is be
coming impenetrable, and the offense
is scoring from the field and inside.
Both key elements of the Cardinal
attack were on display Saturday
against Oregon State, as freshman for
ward Kayla Pedersen and senior guard
Candice Wiggins both broke 20 points
against the Beavers to propel No. 6
Stanford to a 69-59 victory in Corval
lis.
Pedersen had 21 points and 11 re
bounds for the Cardinal while Wiggins
led all scorers with 25 points. Sopho
more center Jayne Appel added 12
points and 11 boards for Stanford, who
overcame a fierce Oregon State attack
for its 10th straight victory.
The Cardinal lead was never in se
rious doubt, but the Beavers — who
had lost five straight coming into the
game — were able to keep the margin
within the low teens,cutting the lead to
10 points late in the second half.
But Wiggins, the Pac-10 Player of
the Week for the past two weeks, hit
timely shots to keep the Cardinal
ahead. She scored four points late in
the first half to give Stanford a com
fortable 35-21 lead at halftime, and
was able to respond whenever the
Beavers narrowed the deficit.
Still, not everything was in sync for
the Cardinal: Stanford shot an abnor
mally low 37.1 percent from the floor
and. in a rare occurrence, was actually
out-shot by their opponent — Oregon
State shot over 40 percent from the
field. Pedersen attributed the close
game to the Cardinal's own mistakes
and missed opportunities.
"We just need to take better care of
the ball." she told the Associated
Press. "There were way too many
turnovers and easy lay-ups"

Since the Cardinal could never put
the Beavers away, coach Tara Van-
Derveer was forced to play her
starters for most of the game. With the
exception of sophomore guard J.J.
I lones, all played significant minutes
— Wiggins played all 40.
Stanford was without starting jun
ior forward Jillian Harmon, who has a
right foot injury and will he out at least
a month. Harmon, an Oregon native,
has been a key part of the Stanford at
tack and, as of late, had been excelling
in transition.
Instead of replacing Harmon with
another forward, VanDerveer went
with three guards, as she added sopho
more guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, a
starter earlier in the season, to the line
up. Gold-Onwude had nine points and
three assists for the Cardinal.
The Beavers were led by guard
Ashley Allen, who had a team-high 17
