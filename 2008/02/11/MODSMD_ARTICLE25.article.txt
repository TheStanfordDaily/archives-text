## Cardinal, Penna perfect 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Whether it was junior Missy Penna's no-hitter on Friday or senior
Erin Howe's game-winning double yesterday. No. 17 Stanford softball's
opening weekend was filled with plenty of highlights.
The Cardinal won all four of its game this past weekend, relying on
the arm of Penna and the team's timely hitting. Stanford only gave up
one run in games against the University of San Diego, Illinois-Chicago
and Long Beach State at the San Diego Tournament.

"Each game every
one pulled together,"
Penna said. "It (sic) was
great team wins all
around. All four
games."
Stanford's weekend
got off to a strong start
after Penna threw her
third career no-hitter in
the Cardinal's 4-0 win
over host San Diego.
Senior Michelle Smith
scored on a double by
sophomore Shannon
Koplitz in the second
inning, and the team
never looked back.
Penna had 14 strike
outs against the
Toreros.

"I just tried to do whatever I could do and the defense was there he
hind to back me up on the plays," she said. "The defense was strong, so
it was good. I tried not to put too many people on base.

for freshman pitcher Ashley Chinn. Chinn threw a complete game for
the Cardinal,giving up five hits and one earned run in the team's 5-1 vic

beginning. She held the team down and we ended up winning. It was
great for her college debut."
