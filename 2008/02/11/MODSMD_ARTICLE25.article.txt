## Cardinal, Penna perfect 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Whether it was junior Missy Penna's no-hitter on Friday or senior
Erin Howe's game-winning double yesterday. No. 17 Stanford softball's
opening weekend was filled with plenty of highlights.
The Cardinal won all four of its game this past weekend, relying on
the arm of Penna and the team's timely hitting. Stanford only gave up
one run in games against the University of San Diego, Illinois-Chicago
and Long Beach State at the San Diego Tournament.

"Each game every
one pulled together,"
Penna said. "It (sic) was
great team wins all
around. All four
games."
Stanford's weekend
got off to a strong start
after Penna threw her
third career no-hitter in
the Cardinal's 4-0 win
over host San Diego.
Senior Michelle Smith
scored on a double by
sophomore Shannon
Koplitz in the second
inning, and the team
never looked back.
Penna had 14 strike
outs against the

ance, Penna was quick to deflect the praise to her teammates.
"I just tried to do whatever I could do and the defense was there he
hind to back me up on the plays," she said. "The defense was strong, so
it was good. I tried not to put too many people on base.
Saturday's bout against Illinois-Chicago marked the collegiate debut
for freshman pitcher Ashley Chinn. Chinn threw a complete game for
the Cardinal,giving up five hits and one earned run in the team's 5-1 vic
tory.
"She was great," Penna said of her teammate. "It was kind of tun to
see her pitching. She came out and she dominated pretty much from the
beginning. She held the team down and we ended up winning. It was
great for her college debut."

versity of Hawaii-Hilo Invitational, tying with teammate Sihwan Kim for 2nd indiviually.
Stanford was propelled by soph
omore Rosey Neill's three-run
homer in the fifth inning. It was the
first home run of the year for the
Cardinal.
The action on Saturday conclud
ed with Stanford's second game of
the day; the team took on Long
Beach State in the first game of a
two-game series. The 49ers were a
stingier opponent on Saturday, hut
they could not stop the Cardinal's
win streak. Freshman first baseman
Melisa Koutz led the team with two
hits; her steal of second base in the
second inning was responsible for
the team's only run of the game, as
Neill scored from third on the throw.
Penna was once again stellar for
the Cardinal, allowing only two hits
and throwing her second straight
shutout to start the season.
After improving to 3-0 on the
young season, Stanford rounded out
its weekend with another match
against Long Beach State.The game
was much like the last one with the
49ers: a pitcher's duel with meager
hitting. Penna had her third domi
nating performance of the weekend,
carrying a perfect game into the
sixth inning and giving up only three
hits on the day.
With the score tied at 0-0, howev
er, the game wasn't decided until the
bottom of the seventh when senior
first baseman Erin Howe stepped to
the plate. After a double by Koutz to
start the inning. Howe hit a walk-off
double, scoring pinch runner
Michelle Schroeder and sealing the
Cardinal's 4-0 record on the week
end.
Shirking off her individual
achievements. Penna was pleased
with the team's performance over its
opening weekend.
"It was a great start to hopefully
a great season." she said. "It kind of
sets the tone in our expectations in
what were supposed to do every
weekend."
Hoping to carry the momentum
from this weekend into the rest of its
season, Stanford next hosts St.
Mary's on Wednesday. The game is
set to start at 6 p.m.
