The No. 10 Stanford men's golf team captured its first
tournament crown of the season last week at the 18th annu
al University of Hawaii-Hilo Invitational in Kona, Hawaii.
The Cardinal finished with a three-round 16-under-par total
of 813, just three strokes ahead of the two runners up. No. 46
Arizona State and No. 8 Southern California.
After concluding a tough first round in fifth place, Stan
ford came through in the clutch in the later rounds to solidi
fy their place in the top spot. Rounding out the top five of the
tournament were No. 4 Georgia Tech at 824 and No. 16Texas
Tech at 829.
"The guys were playing great all week," coach Conrad
Ray said. "It was the type of course that, if you got momen
tum, you could shoot a really good score which we talked
about after the first round. Hie guys have the ability to make
birdies and after the first round we just focused on getting
each day off to a good start ."
The Cardinal's victory can be attributed to substantial in
dividual improvements made in the second round of the
tournament by all five golfers. Most notably, freshman No. 20
Sihwan Kim. after getting off to a slow start in the tourna
ment, shot a seven-under-par score of 63, which launched
him up the individual ladder into a four-way tie for third

No. 65 Rob Grube. Kim kept up with
Grube for the rest of the tournament,
concluding the final round with a
three-under-par performance which
secured his place in a two-way tie for
second with the senior captain.
Grube showed his familiarity with
the course and played consistently
throughout the tournament, helping
lead his teammates and carrying the
Cardinal to its first tournament victo
ry as a team. He started off strong
with a five-under-par score of 65,
placing him in the runner-up spot in
the individual competition. Grube ce
mented his rank at number two by
scoring a three-under 67 in both the
second and third rounds. He was run
ner-up last year in the individual com
petition as well.
Sophomore No. 102 Jordan Cox
was undaunted by the strong 18-pro
gram field and he remained at par
throughout the tournament,shooting
an even 70 for each round. His consis
tency landed him in a tie for 26th.
Junior Daniel Lim and freshman
Steve Ziegler tied for 34th, conclud
ing the tournament with a one-over
par total of 211. Ziegler showed im

ond round. He started off slow with a
five-over score of 75 for the first
round but cut ten strokes off the next
day to seize a five under score of 65.
"Hats off to the guys," Ray said.
"Steve came back and made his score
count as this was only his second col
legiate tournament. He definitely
helped to contribute. We really count
ed on Sihwan and Rob, who made the
majority of our birdies."
The Cardinal showed no sluggish
ness after the long winter break, win
ning in its first competition since the
fall season.This is the second year in a
row that Stanford has taken the
1 lawaiian crown. It was the first colle
giate tournament win for Kim,
Ziegler and assistant coach Matt
Tight.
"The results of this week really
showed that we put in a good team ef
fort," Ray said. "It was really close
coming down the stretch. The guys
were really into the tournament and
wanted to win.
"I think that we have had a com
petitive team throughout the year,
but wins are hard to come by, no mat
ter how good you are. It's exciting to
see that we have some depth to the
team this year. The guys and I feel
good about moving forward in the
spring."
