### GREGG BELL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEATTLE — Justin Dentmon.
benched in favor of a freshman for
most of the season, scored 20
points to lead previously wayward
Washington to a 71-61 upset of No.
5 UCLA on Sunday.
Dentmon entered for the jittery
Venoy Overton in the game's first
minute and then took over for the
Huskies (13-11. 4-7 Pac-10). who
had lost four straight — the last
three at home.
Jon Brockman added 12 points
and 17 rebounds for Washington,
which won its fourth consecutive
home game against the Bruins dat

11-68 against teams ranked in the
top 5, stretching back to 1950.Their
previous win at home over such a
foe was last March, against then-
No. 2 UCLA.
Josh Shipp scored 19 points and

Russell Westbrook had 18 for the
Bruins (21-3.9-2), who lost for the
first time in six games and fell into
a tie with Stanford atop the confer

Washington's largest lead was
nine, three times in the first nine
minutes of the second half and
again after consecutive baskets by
Dentmon made it 65-56 with 2:14
remaining. But then the season

ins back in it.
Darren Collison, 0-for-5 up to
that point, hit a surprising 3-point
er to get the Bruins Lo 65-59 with
two minutes to go. Washington's
Tim Morris then missed two free
throws and Shipp drove for a layup
with 1:39 remaining to make it 65-
