## Washington upsets UCLA in Seattle with 71-61 win 
### GREGG BELL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEATTLE — Justin Dentmon.
benched in favor of a freshman for
most of the season, scored 20
points to lead previously wayward
Washington to a 71-61 upset of No.
5 UCLA on Sunday.
Dentmon entered for the jittery
Venoy Overton in the game's first
minute and then took over for the
Huskies (13-11. 4-7 Pac-10). who
had lost four straight — the last
three at home.
Jon Brockman added 12 points
and 17 rebounds for Washington,
which won its fourth consecutive
home game against the Bruins dat
ing to 2004. The Huskies are now
11-68 against teams ranked in the
top 5, stretching back to 1950.Their
previous win at home over such a
foe was last March, against then-
No. 2 UCLA.
Josh Shipp scored 19 points and

Russell Westbrook had 18 for the
Bruins (21-3.9-2), who lost for the
first time in six games and fell into
a tie with Stanford atop the confer
ence.
Washington's largest lead was
nine, three times in the first nine
minutes of the second half and
again after consecutive baskets by
Dentmon made it 65-56 with 2:14
remaining. But then the season
long problem for the worst free
throw shooting team in the Pac-10
— and one of the worst in the na
tion at SS.S percent — let the Bru
ins back in it.
Darren Collison, 0-for-5 up to
that point, hit a surprising 3-point
er to get the Bruins Lo 65-59 with
two minutes to go. Washington's
Tim Morris then missed two free
throws and Shipp drove for a layup
with 1:39 remaining to make it 65-
61.
Dentmon then followed with an
other miss, the Huskies' eighth in 10
free throws, before he made one.Col
lison missed an open 3 and James
keefe had a putback try stolen by
Morris with 47 seconds left. Morris
was about to get called for a five-sec
ond violation on the inbound play but
instead threw it off the face of Alfred
Aboya and into the incensed UCI.A
bench.
Brockman scored after the
Huskies' next possession, then Ryan
Appleby made two free throws fol
lowing a steal to put Washington up
70-61 and the upset — accompanied
by a wild celebration — was back on

again.
In one rousing afternoon, Wash
ington turned around a season that
seemed adrift after a blowout loss to
Southern California on Thursday that
Brockman called embarrassing.
Washington took a 51 -42 lead with
10:52 left after consecutive baskets in
the lane by freshman Matthew
Bryan-Amaning and a pull-up
jumper by Dentmon.That had Seattle
SuperSonics rookie star Kevin Du
rant, Washington football coach Ty
rone Willingham and the rest of a
sold-out crowd roaring into UCLA's
timeout.
Kevin Love, the Bruins' super
freshman and leading scorer at 17.7
points per game coming in. missed
five of his first seven shots while trad
ing shoves with Artem Wallace. Wal
lace is two inches shorter than the 6-
foot-10 Love, but continually used his
comparable bulk to lean into the 271 -

pound Love on the low blocks.
Love finished with 13 points on
just 3-of-8 shooting, with 10 reboundS.
The Huskies twice took eight
point leads in the first half,the second
time after Wallace leaped over 1 ove
for a tip-in that made it 31-23 with -4
minutes left. Then Collison. who
scored all IS of his points in the sec
ond half Hiursday in the win at No. 17
Washington State, traveled to get the
home crow d roaring even more over
a potential upset.
Collison missed the only shot he
took and had six turnovers in the first
20 minutes. Then 34 seconds after
halftime, he got a technical foul for
yapping at Overton.
The 1 luskies opened up their first
nine-point lead immediately after
that. Collison. averaging 14.6 points
entering Sunday, went l-for-Band fin
ished with three points, four assist and
eight turnovers in 38 minutes.
