WASHINGTON â€” Empty
homes and for-sale signs clutter
neighborhoods. You've lost your
job or know someone who has.
Your paycheck and nest egg are
taking a hit.
Could the country be in reces
sion?
Sixty-one percent of the public
believes the economy is now suffer
ing through its first recession since
2001. according to an Associated
Press-Ipsos poll.
The fallout from a depressed
housing market and a credit crunch
nearly caused the economy to stall
in the final three months of last year.
Some experts, like the majority of
people questioned in the poll, say
the economy actually may be
shrinking now. The worry is that
consumers and businesses will hun
ker down further and pull back
spending, sending the economy into
a tailspin.
"Absolutely, we're in a reces
sion." said Hilda Sanchez, 44, of
Waterford, Calif.
Squeezed by high energy and
food bills,"we can't afford the things
that we normally buy," she said. "We
are cutting corners in our spending.
For our groceries, we are buving a

lot of generic and we are eating out
less."
For many, the meltdown in the
housing and mortgage markets has
proved especially disturbing.
Record numbers of people were
forced from their homes, unable to
afford the monthly loan payments.
People watched their single biggest
asset fall in value, a reason to tight
en the belt.
"Obviously the housing market is
creating deep concern. And one of
the real problems could be that if
people, as a result of their value of
their homes going down, kind of pull

in their horns," President Bush said
in a television interview aired
Sunday.
Credit has become harder to get.
thwarting would-be home buyers,
adding to the glut of unsold homes
and aggravating the housing indus
try's woes.
"For-sale signs are everywhere.
In my area, 35 to 40 homes are
standing there and aren't even com
plete. There aren't any buyers," said
Jim Sims, 60, of Greer. S.C.
Nanette Dahlin, 52, of St. Louis
Park, Minn., called the situation
"very scary." She said friends in

Madison. Minn., put their home up
for sale recently and reduced the
asking price more than $100.(XX) in
just a week. "They are in bad shape."
Dahlin said.
For all of 2007, the economy grew
by just 2.2 percent. That was the
weakest performance since 2002,
when the country was struggling to
recover from the last recession. The
housing collapse was the biggest cul
prit in 2007. Builders lowered
spending on housing projects by
16.9 percent on an annualized basis,
the most in 25 years.
The job market is faltering - a

point driven home by a report show
ing that employers cut jobs in
January for the first time in more
than four years.
"The way things are, people are
afraid of losing their jobs," Sanchez
said.
Employment concerns are con
tributing to darker feelings about
the economy and people's own
financial well-being. Consumer con
fidence. as measured by the RBC
Cash Index, dropped to a mark of
48.5 in early February. It was the
worst reading since the index began
in 2002.

A cooling job market along with
high energy and food prices are tak
ing a toll on paychecks. Workers'
average weekly earnings, adjusted
for inflation, fell 0.9 percent last
year. In 2006, earnings grew by a
solid 2.1 percent.
Wall Street is unsettled and as a
result, people's nest eggs are not
what they once were.
In fact, that was the top econom
ic worry in the AP-Ipsos poll. Fifty
nine percent said they were worried
"a lot" or "some" about seeing the
value of stocks and retirement
investments drop.
