## EPGY escapes online school controversy Director defends merits of distance-learning program 
### MELODY DYE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While online schools in several states have
recently been touched by controversy,
Stanford's virtual Education Program for Gifted
Youth (EPGY) has stayed "out of the fray"
according to deputy director Raymond
Ravaglia.
The growth of virtual K-12
schools nationally has ignited a
debate over whether state tax dollars
should pay for pupils who elect to
attend such schools. Virtual schools
have considerably lower overhead
costs than their traditional counter
parts, with no building construction
or maintenance costs to speak of, and
fewer staff per pupil. Yet online
providers receive just as much fund
ing per student as a traditional school
does despite lower costs, diverting
funding from school districts.
As a tuition-based private pro
gram. EPGY is not subject to the
same kinds of criticism as state-spon
sored providers, but raises some of
the same questions regarding the
pros and cons of online learning.
EPGY offers distance-learning
courses for gifted students in mathe
matics, physics, computer science and
writing. It was initially launched in
the late 1980s with the mission of
developing a computer-based calcu
lus course for students without access
to higher level math at their high
schools.
The program has since expanded
and now offers accelerated-learning
classes for K-7 students and
advanced and university-level cours
es for older students. EPGY also
recently opened a small, fully-accred
ited high school, which currently
enrolls about 80 students. All course
credit is transferable and conferred
through the Stanford Continuing
Studies Program.
Tuition costs range from $495 for
a one-quarter sequence in mechanics,
to $740 for a two-quarter sequence in
multivariable calculus. Financial aid is
available to students who qualify.
According to Ravaglia, the pro
gram provides an "elite population of
students" with Stanford-quality edu
cation through a combination of
computer technology and live
instructional support from staff at
Stanford.
Enrolled students are given access
to various software resources and
assigned an instructor for each of
their courses. Students move through
material at their own pace, supported
by email, virtual chat and phone and
real-time video conferencing with
their teachers.
Ravaglia estimated that EPGY
had approximately 8.000 course
enrollments in the last year, with over
60.000 total enrollments since its
inception in the early 19905.
EPGY is designed to meet the
needs of advanced students, he said,
allowing them to take high-level
classes without having to be bussed
across town to a local community or
state college.
"The technology brings the
instruction to them." he said.
Raviglia admitted that there are
some drawbacks to online learning.
In a virtual classroom, there is no
instructor standing by to ensure that
the work gets done, so students need
a high level of self-discipline and
organization to succeed. The online
experience caters to an independent
learning style.
Fortunately. Raviglia said, highly
motivated, independent learners are
the norm for the student population
he works with.
"It's a good environment for these
kinds of students," he said, adding
that many simply have no alterna
tive.
Furthermore, for the majority of
his students, EPGY classes supple
ment rather than supplant the cours
es available through their local
schools.
"It meets a certain need," he said.
