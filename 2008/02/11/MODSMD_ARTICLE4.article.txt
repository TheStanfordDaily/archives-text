# FORMER EMPLOYEE PROTESTS LAYOFF
## Woman has filed charges, grievances 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
Jennifer Lu, a 52-year-old single mother
of two, spends her afternoons sitting quietly
outside the office of University President
John Hennessy in the main quad. For the
past two weeks, she has brought an appeal
letter posted on a whiteboard, hoping to get
an audience with top administrators.
Lti was laid off last August as assistant to
the director of finance and administration in
the School of Medicine's Continuing
Medical Education (CME) program. 'ITie
news came the day before she was to qualify
for college tuition benefits for her children,
she says, and it was only the latest in what
she alleges was a string of misdeeds by her
former employer. Since 2005, Lu has filed
five race discrimination and retaliation
charges and two grievances against the
University.
University General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt J.D. '79. who spoke on behalf of
Hennessy, insists the issues regarding Lu
have been handled properly and accused Lu
of not returning emails or accepting a settle
ment offer. Zumwalt also noted that past
charges filed by Lu have been dismissed.
"Ms. Lu's various claims of discrimina
tion. retaliation and unfair treatment have
received extensive review by the
University," Zumwalt said, "and many peo
ple have been working hard to assist her."
Before the Layoff
Lu claims her dismissal was "premeditat
ed" and "retaliatory." She says she was
forced into a position as assistant to the
director of finance and administration from
her previous job as CME program adminis
trator. She claimed the new job would soon
lack funding and that it was devised so her
employer could "conveniently eliminate"
her.
Despite Lu's assertion, Zumwalt said the
position offered to Lu in February 2(X)6 was
"not fake."

"Unfortunately, a loss of funding
required the elimination of Ms. Lu's position
[as assistant]," Zumvvalt said. "[The] position
was one of three positions that were elimi
nated within the (School of Medicine's]
Office of Student Affairs during the annual
budgeting process due to funding for [the fis
cal year] 2(X)8."
Lu says she should have been, but never
was. notified that the position was contin
gent on external funding.
"Because staff positions are subject to
annual funding approval, they had to tell me
the position was only good as lung as there
was funding." Lu said.
Zumwalt said funding for many
University positions is not guaranteed.
"Stanford's Layoff Policy specifically rec

ognizes that the elimination of positions may
result from, in addition to other legitimate
factors, a change in programmatic need or
from a reduction or reallocation in funding,"
she said.
Lu said she immediately thought the
position offered to her was fake for a num
ber of reasons.
"Unlike all other positions in the office,
this position had never been posted." she
said. "It did not have a requisition number. I
was never required to submit an application.
I was never interviewed for the position. I
had no formal on-the-job training and the
position was a demotion for me. 1 was horri
fied that the management would have creat
ed this fake position for me."
After declining, Lu was again offered the

one-year assistant position a month later,
but this time as a continuing position. She
was given a 48-hour ultimatum to accept or
be fired, she said. Lu went on to serve as
assistant to the director of finance and
administration until her termination in
August 2(X)7.
After beginning to work in the assistant
position, Lu said she grappled with the idea
of suicide and was put on family and medical
leave. When her application for workers'
compensation was not accepted by her
employer, Lu —an Asian American who
has spent 25 years in the U.S. — said she
filed retaliation charges with the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission


MAE RYAN/The Stanford Daily
Former School of Medicine Continuing Medical Education employee Jennifer Lu has displayed signs of protest in the Quad for the
last two weeks. Lu was laid off from her job as assistant to the director of finance and administration last August.
(EEOC) in April 2006.
This was not the first charge Lu filed against
the University.
Previous Charges
Lu — then working as C'ME program
administrator — first filed a grievance in
February 2005 after she was given oral and writ
ten warnings from the C'ME director for trying
to contact the School of Medicine's senior asso
ciate dean to discuss the cancellation of her
2003-04 fiscal year bonus of $1,700.
The grievance was put on hold while the
Medical School hired an external investigator to
examine L.u's claims against the CME office.
During the investigation, Lu was put on paid
administrative leave until she was allowed to
return in October. She then activated the griev
ance.
Lu said that after returning to work she was
told not to contact any person in another
department and was denied access to her own
filing cabinets. In February 2006, she filed the
first race discrimination and retaliation charge
with the EEOC.
Two Additional Charges
After filing two retaliation charges with the
EEOC. Lu filed two more in August 2(X)ft and
May 2007. while serving as assistant to the direc
tor of finance and administration.
The first of these was filed after doctors cer
tified Lu as able to return from medical leave.
Lu said her doctors recommended the CME
office make accommodations for her and allow
her to work in her previous position as program
administrator. The request for an accommoda
tion was not granted.
"Management ordered me to return to work
at the demoted,fake position," she said,"or they
would fire me for insubordination."
According to Zumwalt. this charge, along
with l.u's previous two retaliation charges, was
dismissed last year after the EEOC was unable
to find any violation of its statutes.
l.u's fourth retaliation charge was filed with
the EEOC under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).The charge came after
an April 2007 settlement of a previous charge.
Lu said she did not sign the settlement —
under which she would not have been able to
sue her employer — "because it did not provide
| her] with any relief."
Following the settlement, Lu said she was
not allowed to attend staff meetings or partici
pate in the annual performance evaluation, so
she filed the ADA and retaliation charge.
According to Zumwalt. this fourth charge is
pending at the EEOC.
During the time that Lu had filed formal
charges, she also reported several informal non
compliance issues that she said took place in the
office. After the CME director was laid off in
July 2(M)7 for what Lu said was failure to have
the CME program reaccredited, Lu believed
her "previous reporting of noncompliance

side President John Hennessy's office for
the past two weeks. Below is a timeline of
some of Lu's interactions with the University
since 2004.
2004
■ Dec. 16 — Lu's 2003-04 bonus of $1,700
was cancelled.
2005
■ Jan. 1 —Lu received a written warning from
the Continuing Medical Education (CME) pro
gram director for trying to contact the Senior
Associate Dean to discuss the bonus cancella
tion.

■ Feb. 25 — The grievance was put on hold
while a third-party investigator was hired to
examine Lu's claims.

issues was justified."
According to Zumwalt, the CME program
was also put on probation at a later time.
After the Layoff
On Aug. 7,2007 Lu received a pay statement
that included payout of her vacation time and a
severance package. I ,u said she had not yet been
notified of her layoff, so the issuance of the sev
erance was a violation of policy.
According to Lu, the Aug. 9 layoff came one
day before she was to qualify for tuition bene
fits for her children. The next day, her son left
home to begin his freshman year at UC-
Berkeley, which Lu said would have been large
ly subsidized had she not been laid off.
On Aug. 27,2(X)7 Lu filed a grievance against
the University. The hearing was scheduled for
Jan. 30, 2(X)8. but Lu said several "necessary"
documents requested from her former employ
ers were not provided to her.
"Since October [2007], I have been request
ing documents that are crucial for the hearing,"
Lu said. "They refused to release the documents
to me."
Zumwalt said Lu has not been denied any
document to which she is entitled.
"Ms. Lu has been provided with multiple
copies of her personnel file," Zumwalt said. "As
far as 1 am aware, she has been provided with
every document that she requested to which she
is entitled."
Lu also said the list of witnesses she provid
ed was never approved, claiming her "witnesses
were essentially blocked."
Zumwalt said Lu was unresponsive to
requests to discuss her witness list.
"I know that the person (who was to review
the list with Lu] asked to meet with her several
times to go over it," Zumwalt said. "And I know
there were at least several instances in which

■ Oct. 14 — Lu activated the grievance.

and retaliation charge with the EEOC.

she did not come to meet or respond to his
emails."
Lu said she was denied the mediation griev
ance for her hearing, which she argues is
required under University guidelines. The poli
cy states that "all grievances filed by regular
staff employees who have passed the trial peri
od will undergo a mediation assessment before
being reviewed by a University Reviewing
Officer."
However, University employee relations
representative Emery Teranishi told Lu in a
Nov. 2 l ). 2007 email that mediation would not be
possible in this case.
"Since your requested remedy is to be rein
stated and an upgrade to your job classification
plus other remedies related to compensation
and pay, it was determined that referring to your
grievance for possible mediation is not feasi
ble," Teranishi wrote in a memo Lu provided to
The Daily.
Since her layoff, Lu has applied for some 30
staff positions on campus, but she says she has
not received any official interviews. She believes
her applications are being blocked by the
administration.
"In 2001 I applied for four positions. I got
three interviews and I was given two job offers,
all in two weeks." Lu said. "I now have six years
of Stanford experience and I'm getting noth
ing."
Lu also said she applied for a few positions
under a different name and immediately
received interview offers from employers who
called her "the best-qualified applicant for the
job." When Lu responded to the offers, she says
Stanford employers did not return her calls.
"I believe they were just trying to confirm
that Jenny Lu was Jennifer Lu." she said.
Zumwalt again said Lu was unresponsive,
this time to employers who wanted to meet with

■ July 10 — Doctors certified Lu's return to the
workplace.

and retaliation charge with the EEOC.

her.
"I don't know the details of her attempts or
what she might have done under a false name,"
Zumwalt said. "What I do know is that people
who have wanted to intervfew her have tried
contacting her. and she doesn't respond to the
emails."
Following her attempts to regain employ
ment. Lu filed her fifth retaliation charge
against the University on Sept. 20.2(X)7.
For the past two weeks. Lu has carried out
what she calls a "peaceful protest" each day in
the president's corner of the quad. A restriction
letter from the University warned her that she
could not approach the door to Hennessy's
office. She said campus police and a security dog
were brought to the quad when she appealed to
the president's office last November.
The Future
l u said she will continue her appeal to
Hennessy. which is grounded in her belief that
she has been unlawfully discriminated against
by the I Jniversity. I lowever.she said she will not
file suit.
"I love this I Jniversity even if there are prob
lems occurring," I u said."l still have trust in this
I Jniversity I'm still proud of this University."
Zumwalt maintained that Lu was "treated
legally and fairly by Stanford."
Now. Lu said she just wants "to survive and
move forward." She also professes concern for
her children.
"Even if I clean the toilet. I will be happy
because my kills will be able to survive." she said,
breaking down in tears. "No one is giving me a
chance. They say all roads lead to Rome, but
right now all the roads are blocked from me."
