# FORMER EMPLOYEE PROTESTS LAYOFF
## Woman has filed charges, grievances 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
Jennifer Lu, a 52-year-old single mother
of two, spends her afternoons sitting quietly
outside the office of University President
John Hennessy in the main quad. For the
past two weeks, she has brought an appeal
letter posted on a whiteboard, hoping to get
an audience with top administrators.
Lti was laid off last August as assistant to
the director of finance and administration in
the School of Medicine's Continuing
Medical Education (CME) program. 'ITie
news came the day before she was to qualify
for college tuition benefits for her children,
she says, and it was only the latest in what
she alleges was a string of misdeeds by her
former employer. Since 2005, Lu has filed
five race discrimination and retaliation
charges and two grievances against the
University.
University General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt J.D. '79. who spoke on behalf of
Hennessy, insists the issues regarding Lu
have been handled properly and accused Lu
of not returning emails or accepting a settle
ment offer. Zumwalt also noted that past
charges filed by Lu have been dismissed.
"Ms. Lu's various claims of discrimina
tion. retaliation and unfair treatment have
received extensive review by the
University," Zumwalt said, "and many peo
ple have been working hard to assist her."
Before the Layoff
Lu claims her dismissal was "premeditat
ed" and "retaliatory." She says she was
forced into a position as assistant to the
director of finance and administration from
her previous job as CME program adminis
trator. She claimed the new job would soon
lack funding and that it was devised so her
employer could "conveniently eliminate"
her.
Despite Lu's assertion, Zumwalt said the
position offered to Lu in February 2(X)6 was
"not fake."

"Unfortunately, a loss of funding
required the elimination of Ms. Lu's position
[as assistant]," Zumvvalt said. "[The] position
was one of three positions that were elimi
nated within the (School of Medicine's]
Office of Student Affairs during the annual
budgeting process due to funding for [the fis
cal year] 2(X)8."
Lu says she should have been, but never
was. notified that the position was contin
gent on external funding.
"Because staff positions are subject to
annual funding approval, they had to tell me
the position was only good as lung as there
was funding." Lu said.
Zumwalt said funding for many
University positions is not guaranteed.
"Stanford's Layoff Policy specifically rec

ognizes that the elimination of positions may
result from, in addition to other legitimate
factors, a change in programmatic need or
from a reduction or reallocation in funding,"
she said.
Lu said she immediately thought the
position offered to her was fake for a num
ber of reasons.
"Unlike all other positions in the office,
this position had never been posted." she
said. "It did not have a requisition number. I
was never required to submit an application.
I was never interviewed for the position. I
had no formal on-the-job training and the
position was a demotion for me. 1 was horri
fied that the management would have creat
ed this fake position for me."
After declining, Lu was again offered the

one-year assistant position a month later,
but this time as a continuing position. She
was given a 48-hour ultimatum to accept or
be fired, she said. Lu went on to serve as
assistant to the director of finance and
administration until her termination in
August 2(X)7.
After beginning to work in the assistant
position, Lu said she grappled with the idea
of suicide and was put on family and medical
leave. When her application for workers'
compensation was not accepted by her
employer, Lu —an Asian American who
has spent 25 years in the U.S. — said she
filed retaliation charges with the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
