# Stanford 71, Oregon State 56
## LEADING THE PAC 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What do laughter, mad cow disease
and ugly basketball have in common?
Apparently, all three are contagious.
No. 9 Stanford (20-3, 9-2 Pac-10)
downed Oregon State (6-17. 0-11) 71-
56 Saturday, with sophomore center
Brook Lopez and junior forward
Lawrence Hill each scoring a game
high 14 points. The Cardinal's 20th vic
tory earned it a tie with UCLA atop
the Pac-10, but there were few style
points in the process, save for a 15-0
run to close the first half.
"We're happy to win but not proud
of our effort," Hill said. "They knocked
us on our heels."
Stanford trailed 17-11 ten minutes
in, but scored 24 of the half's last 29
points — and the last 15 straight in the
half's final five minutes — to take a 35-
22 halftime lead and break the contest
open.
Kenny Brown's three-pointer with
two defenders in his face was the most
memorable bucket, but six different
Stanford players scored during the 15-
0 run, including reserve senior forward
Taj Finger, who had nine points and 10
rebounds on the night.
"Kenny and Taj gave us the same
effort, the same lift they always do,"
coach Trent Johnson said. "Taj has

been doing it all year long, and Kenny
stepped up when we needed someone
to step up and make the play."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal goes into Thursday's
game coming off a sweep of conference foes
Oregon and Oregon State at home last week
end. This was the 15th consecutive year that
Stanford has swept the Oregon schools at home.
Arizona State is coming off a 59-54 win at
Arizona. Stanford won the previous meeting with
ASU at Maples 67-52.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's Fred Washington drives down the court against OSU on Saturday.
Washington had six points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Cardinal.
The Beavers chipped away at a
50-30 Stanford lead, closing to 58-49
with 3:42 to play. But again it was
Finger with a key offensive rebound
and two free throws, and Oregon
State would come no closer.
The Beavers led 20-16 at the six
minute mark, as Stanford tripped
over its own shoes early and often,
committing 10 of its 17 turnovers in
the first 17 minutes. Brook Lopez,
consistently trapped by two small
er. quicker defenders in the paint,
struggled passing out of double
teams, finishing with seven
turnovers and no assists. The frus
tration visibly affected him. as he
was seen swearing at his brother
Robin during the game.
"A little frustrated?" Trent John
son said ot his star big man. "For the
most part, he lost his cool. He just
needs to make better decisions."
But. like it has all season, the
Cardinal took control with its de
fense and rebounding. Stanford
outboarded Oregon State 23-6 in
the first half and 46-21 overall, cap
ping its first weekend of Pacific-10
Conference play since 1980 that
saw the team hold its two oppo
nents to fewer than 100 points com
bined. (Oregon State beat Stanford
18-16 in 1980.0n the last such week
end. So, yes. this game could have
been uglier yet.)
"The only thing we did pretty
well is we rebounded and we shot
good free throws," said Johnson,
whose team made a season-high 24
on 28 attempts. "The good thing is
we're 20-3 and 9-2 in the Pac-10. It
says something when you don't play
up to your standards and you win,
regardless of who it is."
The Beavers, who fired coach Jay
John and dismissed their most tal
ented player C.J. Giles — a Kansas
transfer — midway through the sea
son. have now lost 13 straight, and
ten of their last 11 by double figures.
So poorly are they regarded that
Stanford's RPI actually dropped
with the victory, from No. 17 to No.
19, according to WarrenNolan.com.
Ihough casual fans follow the com
puter-based RPI less than the tradi
tional polls, the former carries more
weight in determining a team's se-

lection and placement in the NCAA
Tournament come mid-March.
As relieved as Stanford was with
a weekend sweep Saturday, and as
proud as they will he today — when
they will likely move up a few spots
with the release of this week's AP
and Coaches' polls — yesterday
must have been better yet.
Former Stanford and current
Washington guard Tim Morris

"Our goal is
to win the
Pac-10"

— Lawrence Hill

avoided a last-minute five-second
call by throwing the ball off UCLA
forward Alfred Aboya's face at full
velocity on an in-bound play (no vi
olation was called), and his Huskies
shocked the No. 5 Bruins 71-61 in
Seattle.
The result drops UCLA into a tie
for first in the Pac-10 with Stanford,
with the next-closest competitors
(Washington State, USC, Arizona
State and Arizona) a full three loss
es behind. Stanford now controls its
own destiny in its quest for its first
Pac-10 regular season crown since
2003-04.
The team's March 6 visit to West
wood. Calif, is shaping up to be a de
facto Pac-10 title game, but Stanford
first visits the Arizona schools this
weekend before hosting Cal and the
Washington schools in the following
two weeks.
"Our goal is to win the Pac-10,"
said Hill last week, "and we really
need to win all our games to have a
shot."

consistently trapped by two small
er. quicker defenders in the paint,
struggled passing out of double
teams, finishing with seven
turnovers and no assists. The frus
tration visibly affected him. as he
was seen swearing at his brother
Robin during the game.
"A little frustrated?" Trent John
son said ot his star big man. "For the
most part, he lost his cool. He just
needs to make better decisions."
But. like it has all season, the
Cardinal took control with its de
fense and rebounding. Stanford
outboarded Oregon State 23-6 in
the first half and 46-21 overall, cap
ping its first weekend of Pacific-10
Conference play since 1980 that
saw the team hold its two oppo
nents to fewer than 100 points com
bined. (Oregon State beat Stanford
18-16 in 1980.0n the last such week
end. So, yes. this game could have
been uglier yet.)
"The only thing we did pretty
well is we rebounded and we shot
good free throws," said Johnson,
whose team made a season-high 24
on 28 attempts. "The good thing is
we're 20-3 and 9-2 in the Pac-10. It
says something when you don't play
up to your standards and you win,
regardless of who it is."
The Beavers, who fired coach Jay
John and dismissed their most tal
ented player C.J. Giles — a Kansas
transfer — midway through the sea
son. have now lost 13 straight, and
ten of their last 11 by double figures.
So poorly are they regarded that
Stanford's RPI actually dropped
with the victory, from No. 17 to No.
19, according to WarrenNolan.com.
Ihough casual fans follow the com
puter-based RPI less than the tradi
tional polls, the former carries more
weight in determining a team's se-

lection and placement in the NCAA
Tournament come mid-March.
As relieved as Stanford was with
a weekend sweep Saturday, and as
proud as they will he today — when
they will likely move up a few spots
with the release of this week's AP
and Coaches' polls — yesterday
must have been better yet.

"Our goal is
to win the
Pac-10"

— Lawrence Hill

avoided a last-minute five-second
call by throwing the ball off UCLA
forward Alfred Aboya's face at full
velocity on an in-bound play (no vi
olation was called), and his Huskies
shocked the No. 5 Bruins 71-61 in
Seattle.
The result drops UCLA into a tie
for first in the Pac-10 with Stanford,
with the next-closest competitors
(Washington State, USC, Arizona
State and Arizona) a full three loss
es behind. Stanford now controls its
own destiny in its quest for its first
Pac-10 regular season crown since
2003-04.
The team's March 6 visit to West
wood. Calif, is shaping up to be a de
facto Pac-10 title game, but Stanford
first visits the Arizona schools this
weekend before hosting Cal and the
Washington schools in the following
two weeks.
"Our goal is to win the Pac-10,"
said Hill last week, "and we really
need to win all our games to have a
shot."

What do laughter, mad cow disease
and ugly basketball have in common?
Apparently, all three are contagious.
No. 9 Stanford (20-3, 9-2 Pac-10)
downed Oregon State (6-17. 0-11) 71-
56 Saturday, with sophomore center
Brook Lopez and junior forward
Lawrence Hill each scoring a game
high 14 points. The Cardinal's 20th vic
tory earned it a tie with UCLA atop
the Pac-10, but there were few style
points in the process, save for a 15-0
run to close the first half.
"We're happy to win but not proud
of our effort," Hill said. "They knocked
us on our heels."
Stanford trailed 17-11 ten minutes
in, but scored 24 of the half's last 29
points — and the last 15 straight in the
half's final five minutes — to take a 35-
22 halftime lead and break the contest
open.
Kenny Brown's three-pointer with
two defenders in his face was the most
memorable bucket, but six different
Stanford players scored during the 15-
0 run, including reserve senior forward
Taj Finger, who had nine points and 10
rebounds on the night.
"Kenny and Taj gave us the same
effort, the same lift they always do,"
coach Trent Johnson said. "Taj has

been doing it all year long, and Kenny
stepped up when we needed someone
to step up and make the play."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal goes into Thursday's
game coming off a sweep of conference foes
Oregon and Oregon State at home last week
end. This was the 15th consecutive year that
Stanford has swept the Oregon schools at home.
Arizona State is coming off a 59-54 win at
Arizona. Stanford won the previous meeting with
ASU at Maples 67-52.

Stanford's Fred Washington drives down the court against OSU on Saturday.
Washington had six points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Cardinal.
The Beavers chipped away at a
50-30 Stanford lead, closing to 58-49
with 3:42 to play. But again it was
Finger with a key offensive rebound
and two free throws, and Oregon
State would come no closer.
The Beavers led 20-16 at the six
minute mark, as Stanford tripped
over its own shoes early and often,
committing 10 of its 17 turnovers in
the first 17 minutes. Brook Lopez,
consistently trapped by two small
er. quicker defenders in the paint,
struggled passing out of double
teams, finishing with seven
turnovers and no assists. The frus
