# Stanford 71, Oregon State 56
## LEADING THE PAC 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What do laughter, mad cow disease
and ugly basketball have in common?
Apparently, all three are contagious.
No. 9 Stanford (20-3, 9-2 Pac-10)
downed Oregon State (6-17. 0-11) 71-
56 Saturday, with sophomore center
Brook Lopez and junior forward
Lawrence Hill each scoring a game
high 14 points. The Cardinal's 20th vic
tory earned it a tie with UCLA atop
the Pac-10, but there were few style
points in the process, save for a 15-0
run to close the first half.
"We're happy to win but not proud
of our effort," Hill said. "They knocked
us on our heels."
Stanford trailed 17-11 ten minutes
in, but scored 24 of the half's last 29
points — and the last 15 straight in the
half's final five minutes — to take a 35-
22 halftime lead and break the contest
open.
Kenny Brown's three-pointer with
two defenders in his face was the most
memorable bucket, but six different
Stanford players scored during the 15-
0 run, including reserve senior forward
Taj Finger, who had nine points and 10
rebounds on the night.
"Kenny and Taj gave us the same
effort, the same lift they always do,"
coach Trent Johnson said. "Taj has

been doing it all year long, and Kenny
stepped up when we needed someone
to step up and make the play."
