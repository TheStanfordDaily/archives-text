### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Rafi Taherian, executive director of Stanford
Dining since 2005, will leave his post at the end of this
month after 12 years of service to the University.
Taherian leaves Stanford to lead the Yale
University dining team, as it transitions from outside
contractor management to a self-management busi
ness model.
Erie Montell. currently Stanford Dining's senior
associate director, will act as executive director while
the administration seeks a permanent replacement.
"The program is well taken care of." Taherian said
of Montell's appointment. "The quality of Stanford
Dining is just going to get better and better."
Taherian said he was honored to join the Yale
team, but recognized that leaving Stanford was hard.
"I really, really, really enjoyed my time here." he
said. "It's been fantastic, transformational."
After leaving the restaurant business. Taherian
started his Stanford career as the senior chef and
manager for Manzanita. Branner and Schwab dining
halls in l^Sfi.
"(At that time] we had cooks, but we didn't have
culinary leadership." he said.
Since then. Taherian has recruited award-winning
chefs such as Raul Lakara, now head chef for Schwab
Dining Enterprises.
Working with such an amazing staff has been a
blessing, he said, hut noted that his
time as a chef in Manzanita dining
hall provided him with some of his
favorite memories.
"Back then, students didn't
know what couscous was." he said.
"I well remember we were experi
menting with new recipes, putting
quinoa in things, and I had fresh
men from the Midwest coming to
me asking me why we were feed
ing them birdseed."
He cited his relationships with
Stanford staff and students as
something that he will miss the
most.
Taherian said that working with
green organizations like Students
for a Sustainable Stanford has also
been a highlight of his time here
and has yielded great improve
ments for Stanford Dining. He
pointed out that approximately
one quarter of Stanford Dining
food is now grown locally.
Taherian said he is looking for
ward to working with Yale's
Sustainability Food Project to con
tinue his commitment to green
dining services.
