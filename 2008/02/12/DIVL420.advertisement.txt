THE APARTHEID ANALOGY IS FALSE AND
BREEDS CONFLICT
ISRAEL IS NOT AN APARTHEID STATE
In pursuing peace, security and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis we must focus on initiatives that bring the sides closer together. We are sad
dened and concerned by t he malicious propaganda campaign being waged on various campuses, including Stanford, against Israel. In falsely seeking to
smear Israel with the stain of apartheid, this campaign is sowing divisiveness, bigotry, and discord. Demonizing Israel is contrary to our values of mutual
respect and academic integrity. It contributes to the perpetuation of the conflict, not its resolution.
Apartheid was the vicious policy of the old South Africa that kept races separate and caused untold suffering to the Black majority and other peo
ple of color. Ihe anti-Israel movement is cynically exploiting the memory of African suffering in order to score points in the fraught field of Middle East
politics. To describe Israel, the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, as apartheid, trivializes the South African past while doing a grave injustice to
the most pluralistic and open society in the Middle Hast today.
I nder Apartheid, people were legally classified into racial groups and forcibly separated from each other. Apartheid South Africa was ruled by a
White-only government. A wide range of laws ensured racially based discrimination, including the prohibition of Blacks from voting, using Whites-only
schools and hospitals, and even mixing with Whites in public places.
112 he State of Israel has nothing in common with apartheid. Israeli society, as many others, is not free of racial and religious discrimination. Yet, in
Israel, all minorities - including the 20% of Israeli citizens who are Arab Christians and Muslims - have equal civil, political, economic and personal
rights. Israeli Arabs form political parties, compete in free and fair elections, and are represented in all levels of the legislature, executive and judiciary.
Arabs are members of, for example, the Israeli Parliament, cabinet, and I ligh Court. Israelis of all religions and ethnicities can legally live in any public
residential community, attend the same universities and use the same hospitals. Arabic is an official language, an Israeli Arab is the Minister of Culture,
and Arab Israelis richly contribute to Israel's science, culture and sports.
Fo equate Israel with apartheid displays a profound ignorance of the horror that was South Africa as well as contempt for democracy in Israel. The
difficult path to peace in the Middle East can do without this sort of empty vilification. Rather, we need to work together toward the vital quest for true
co-existence, peace and justice for all in the Middle East - Christians, Jews and Muslims.
