## Yahoo rejects Microsoft's hostile takeover bid 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Yahoo
Inc.'s rejection of Microsoft Corp.'s
unsolicited takeover bid left
investors guessing the next move in
a tense mating dance that may hatch
a more imposing challenger to
Google Inc. or disintegrate into a
bruising brawl.
The rebuff, formally announced
early Monday, wasn't a surprise
because Yahoo had leaked its inten
tion over the weekend.
As expected. Yahoo's board
unanimously decided to spurn
Microsoft after concluding the offer
- originally worth $44.6 billion or
$31 per share - "substantially under
values" one of the Internet's prized
franchises. The cash-and stock deal
is now valued at about $40 billion, or
$28.91 per share, because of a drop
in Microsoft's market value.
But Yahoo didn't raise antitrust
concerns about the proposed deal
and included language that seemed
to invite a higher offer from
Microsoft, the world's largest soft
ware maker.
"The board of directors is contin
ually evaluating all of its strategic
options in the context of the rapidly
evolving industry environment and
we remain committed to pursuing
initiatives that maximize value for
all stockholders," Yahoo said in a

statement.
Microsoft, though, didn't seem
inclined to raise the bid Monday,
releasing a statement describing its
current bid as "full and fair."
Calling Yahoo's decision "unfor
tunate," Microsoft didn't back off
from its quest either. "Based on con
versations with stakeholders of both
companies, we are confident that
moving forward promptly to con
summate a transaction is in the best
interests of all parties," the
Redmond. Wash.-based company
said.
Microsoft also emphasized it's
prepared to "pursue all necessary
steps" to get the deal done, raising
the prospect that it could take the
bid directly to Yahoo shareholders
with a so-called "exchange offer" or
escalate the acrimony even further
by trying to oust Yahoo's 10-mem
ber board later this year.
While assessing its response to
Microsoft, Yahoo's board also
examined a wide range of alterna
tives that included forging an ad
partnership with Google, which
paid nearly $5 billion in marketing
commissions to thousands of Web
sites last year.
Without identifying its sources,
the Times of London also reported
Yahoo is exploring a merger with
Time Warner Inc.'s AOL. another
popular Internet property that has
been struggling in recent years.
