## Men see greater "reward" than women in video games 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, video
games activate the reward regions
of the brain in men more than they
do in women, according to
researchers at the School of
Medicine. The researchers used
brain scans to learn about the dif
ferences between men and women
with regard to feelings generated by
playing video games.
" These gender differences may
help explain why males are more
attracted to, and more likely to
become 'hooked' on, video games
than females," the researchers wrote
in their paper, which appeared
online in the Journal of Psychiatric
Research.
In the study, the team — led by

Psychiatry Prof. Allan Reiss —
devised a game involving a vertical
wall down the middle of a computer
screen. At the start of the game, 10
halls appear at the right of the
screen.
As the halls travel left, players
click on a ball to make it disappear
from the screen. As balls are kept
farther from the center "wall," the
wall moves to the right, and the
player gains more territory in the
game. If a ball reaches the wall
before the player clicks, the line
moves left, and the player subse
quently loses territory.
A group of 22 young adults — 11
men and 11 women — played the
game while being monitored by a
functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) machine.
In analyzing the data, "the
females 'got' the game, and they
moved the wall in the direction you
would expect." said Reiss, who is
also director of the Center for
Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences
Research, in a press release.
