## GM: Oppose greenhouse gas laws 
### TOM KRISHER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO â€”General
Motors Corp. CEO Rick Wagoner
urged a group of auto dealers
Saturday to lobby against individual
states trying to set their own limits on
greenhouse gas emissions.
Wagoner, speaking to the National
Automobile Dealers Association con
vention in San Francisco, said several
states want to go beyond require
ments passed by Congress. If that
happens and automakers must focus
on state regulations, they won't be
able to focus as much on alternative
fuel vehicles to reduce oil consump
tion and pollution, he said.
"We're not going to be able to
accomplish everything that we other
wise could," Wagoner said.
EPA Administrator Stephen L.
Johnson in December denied a feder
al waiver that would have allowed
California to enact its own law slash
ing greenhouse gas emissions from
cars and trucks.
Other states could then have fol
lowed suit and 12 were ready to do so,
with others making preparations.
Because global warming is an
international phenomenon not
unique to California, the state does
n't need its own standards to meet
"compelling and extraordinary con
ditions" as set out in the law, Johnson
has said.
