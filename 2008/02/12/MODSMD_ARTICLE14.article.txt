## Editorial Board Elegy for the CoHo 
### 
To borrow liberally from ee cum
mings: Where did you go, little
CoHo? Hie Axe & Palm is certainly
shiny and new, but why did it have to re
place the Coffee House? Last year, stu
dents were told that the Axe & Palm would
add to eating options on campus, but swap
ping the cozy, worn-in CoHo for the sterile
Old I nion eatery doesn't equal a net gain.
Chief among the reasons cited lhat the
CoHo had to go is that it wouldn't have
been able to compete financially with the
Axe & Palm, but such a rationale misses the
point: students didn't go to the Col lo just to
buy food; they went to the CoHo to social
ize in a low-key environment. It wasn't a
sweaty frat party. It didn't feel like a corpo
rate cafeteria. It was a welcome change
from a dorm. Perhaps most importantly, the
Col lo was one of the few places on campus
that fell as though it could have existed out
side of Stanford-land, easily found on any
street corner in any city.
The Axe & Palm tries so hard to do
everything right. The lighting is conducive
to reading. The food is reasonably priced.
There are a variety of booths and nooks for
group meetings. But the place just doesn't
have soul.The CoHo's dingy lighting, beat
en up couches and cheesy split-log tables
with moldy wildflowers trapped under
neath the lacquer may not have been glitzy,
but it sure felt like home.
I lie Col lo had a whole culture and set of
connotations surrounding it. Everyone
knew that if you agreed to meet someone at
the CoHo. it counted as a half-date. Cam
pus bands were nothing until they played
on the CoHo stage. If you planned to study
with your friends there, it was clear that a
night of gossiping and crepe-eating — and
little actual studying — was about to tran
spire.
While on the subject of crepe-eating.

root beer floats, onion rings and breakfast
served all day are all well and good, but
CoHo crepes were an institution. Granted,
they were only introduced in 2005, but their
popularity is unquestionable. They were
different.They were delicious.They came in
savory or sweet.
What will happen to the space aban
doned by the CoHo's closing? There are ru
mors that the location will be rented out to
the highest bidder. If this is true, national
corporations will have the financial advan
tage. Such a conversion would be a disaster,
though in line with campus precedent. See:
Jamba Juice, Subway, FedEx-Kinko's and
Peet's Coffee & Tea.
Using theTresidder dining area as a case
in point, spaces on campus don't have to be
thoughtfully planned or particularly
unique to be utilized. Just as students flock
to Peet's and Subway, they are almost as
certain to buy food from the Axe & Palm
and to make use of whatever services are
ultimately offered in the CoHo's footprint.
Hie sad truth of the matter is that the Stan
ford Bubble chains students to on-campus
resources — regardless of their quality.
While the CoHo had a vibrant and dy
namic tradition, its quiet closing all but en
sures that the memory of the place will fade
as its former customers graduate. The class
of 2011 and its successors will likely learn to
love the Axe & Palm — indeed, the fresh
men have actively exhibited little dissatis
faction with the new Old Union. But,just as
alumni this weekend will visit Jerry and
wax nostalgic about the good old days of
Lambda Nu or walk up the stairs to Tresid
der and remember the OSA-sponsored
keggers of their youth, those who remem
ber the CoHo will truly miss it.
