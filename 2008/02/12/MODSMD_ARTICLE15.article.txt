# Pleading Inanity
## Love's labour 
### 
It's common knowledge that 1 consider O.
ITie Oprah Magazine, to be as holy a text
as the Upanishads, the Mahabharatha,
and"I Am America (And So Can You!)."
Consequently, it's no surprise that after
reading the tantalizingly titillating article
"The Love List" in this year's February
issue, I was moved to action.
II you've been living in Crother's base
ment for weeks and somehow haven't had
your paradigms shifted by Alice Gorman's
touching tale, here's a synopsis: after endur
ing a painful divorce, a broken engagement
and the loss of a husband, Alice began to
worry that true love would always elude her
grasp. In her despair, she consulted a "clair
voyant" who advised her to make a "love
list" consisting of the KM) qualities she want
ed in a life partner, with the goal of clarifying
her priorities and "directing her request into
the universe to send that person to her."
Usually when 1 direct a request into the
universe, it tells me that if 1 want to send a
numeric page, press 1 or else just wait for the
tone. Luckily for Gorman, though, the cos
mos were in an acquiescing mood, and some
years later she received 98 percent of the
man she desired, whom she then told she
would consider a threesome if he took up
sailing and dancing.
Before reading this O article, my love list
consisted of two items: my partner had to be
I.) able to breathe,and 2.) not in a persistent
vegetative state. Since even this minimalist
strategy generally failed to produce results, 1
was quite skeptical about the worth of in
creasing the number of my requirements
fifty fold.Then again, it's almost Valentine's
Day, and if 1 check my e-mail thirty-seven
times a day, I'm clearly not too busy to ex
plore conceptual dead-ends.
I started my list with things I imagine we
all look for in a partner: kindness, thought
fulness, generosity, honesty. As I progressed,
1 found myself running out of the fundamen
tals and straying into personal penchants —
I prefer secular, humble vegetarians who
have lived abroad, for instance. Yet even
with these more tertiary tastes, I couldn't fill
out the list, so I had to close with a couple
that I don't think even the most benevolent
universe could bestow upon me: 99) a
woman with the last name Subramanian,

and 100) a birthmark on her left calf that re
sembles a post-Soviet republic, preferably
Azerbaijan.
After I finished enumerating the quali
ties that 1 imagine everyone who rejects my
advances has. I felt conflicted. Had Martha
Beck — Oprah and my life coach — led us
astray? Individuals are more than the sum of
their characteristics, so was my list Hawed in
not representing the intangibles? Also, we
are rarely the best judges of what will be
good for us in the long-term, so might my ef
forts merely have left me more set in my
maladaptive ways?
And what ever happened to loving some
one with whom we initially thought we
would be incompatible? When I was a kid,
beautiful women like Paula Abdul slept with
talking animals, and nobody seemed to ob
ject (except maybe James Dobson). If MC
Skat Kat had made a list, I bet "being feline"
would have made the top ten. But he didn't,
and look at how well he did for himself —
they came together 'cuz opposites attract.
Romance is wonderful, I hear, but at the
end of the day, it's undeniable that luck has a
large part to play in how my love life will
turn out. I might never meet my perfect part
ner. 1 might meet her after my marriage has
been arranged (thanks mom!). Or, I might
meet her after she is already married to my
brother (hi Pacima!).Then again, maybe I'll
be fortunate like Alice and meet a compan
ion who has most of the qualities I want. If
her last name happens to be Srinivasan in
stead of Subramaniam, I could live with that.
I mean, it'll be Sridharan soon enough,
right?
