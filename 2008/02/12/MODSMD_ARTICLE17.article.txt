## John McCain has a problem 
### 
This weekend's caucuses featured the
media's usual fawning over Obama.
Buried beneath the headlines about
Obama's greatness, however, was some
thing more concerning — McCain's inabili
ty to lock up the nomination. This past
weekend, Kansas and Washington held cau
cuses, and Louisiana a primary. And to the
surprise of pretty much everyone, including
McCain, Huckabee cleaned up: he won 60-
24 in Kansas, 43-42 in Louisiana, and just
barely lost in Washington, 26-24.
These defeats came after an entire week
when the media, when they weren't wor
shipping Obama, were declaring how Mc-
Cain had come full circle and was the "pre
sumptive nominee," and now conservatives
were going to fall into line...blah blah blah.
The primary results show that this has not
yet happened — and might not — before
the general election. The McCain camp has
been very concerned about the lack of con
servative support, but everyone seems to
think voters will eventually turn out for him
as they did for President Bush, favoring him
over the specter of a Democrat in the White
House.
McCain is going to win the nomination.
That much is clear. But Huckabee. despite
being a seriously flawed candidate, despite
having no money and no endorsements, is
still winning states, and that has to be worri
some for the McCain campaign. Although

McCain will win without substantial conser
vative support, the absence of a Republican
base might be more damaging than the pun
dits seem to think.
Democrats learned in 2004 that hatred
for President Bush could not bring an elec
tion victory. John Kerry was even less inspir
ing and credible than Bush, and people were
not moved to vote for him. Despite all the
money poured into the major swing states,
the Democrats could not turn a single state
blue. For all the talk of "turning out to vote
against candidate X," voters want someone
to vote for, rather than against. For certain
independents and moderate Republicans,
McCain is that man. For conservatives, he
isn't.
It's interesting to imagine what would
happen if there was a credible conservative
in the field, one without the debilitating
flaws of Romney,Thompson or Huckabee.
If someone with real stature and fewer ap
parent defects — a Jeb Bush, for example,
without his last name, of course — McCain
might never have had a chance. But because
the conservatives split themselves three
ways (with Huckabee mainly taking votes
away from Romney), McCain was able to
sneak through. In the Tsunami TUesday of
Feb. 5, McCain did not win a plurality of
self-described "conservative" voters in any
of the states, even in the ones he won. He
dominated "moderates" and "independ

ents."
So now Republicans are stuck with their
man McCain.They don"t seem too excited
with him, just relieved that the ridiculous
Republican nominating process is coming
to a close. His fundraising has been anemic,
with both Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama clearly outshining him.
Now, McCains general election chances
hinges on turnout. If Obama is the Democ
ratic nominee, he will have to fight for inde
pendents and moderates. McCain will have
to boost conservative turnout to compen
sate, which seems doubtful without a con
certed effort from conservative allies.
I can imagine a "Moderates Anony
mous" meeting with the likes of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Rudy Giuliani and John
McCain, going around, talking about their
problems with conservatives.

Stuart Baimel is still amazed that Huckabee is
actually winning states. Share your astonish
ment with him atsbaimel@stanford.edu.
