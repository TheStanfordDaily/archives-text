## TENNIS OUT IN ITA SEMIS Cardinal women lose 4-3 decision to tournament champion Georgia Tech 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Frustration and disappointment.
Those two words could sum up the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team's exit in the
semifinals of the 2008 National Team In
doors. as the team team ended its tourney hid
with a 4-3 loss to No. 4 Georgia Tech.
The Cardinal entered the Indoors in
Madison, Wise., as the top team in the nation
and the first seed in the draw. Stanford lived
up to its ranking in strong wins against No. 11
Baylor and No. 9 University of Miami (Fla.)
in the early rounds.
"We played the No. 11 team in the coun
try in the first round, which was probably the
toughest first round we've ever had to deal
with there," head coach Lele Forood said.
"We had a nice win over Baylor who has
three players in the top-25. Then we had
Miami, which was a good test."
Then came the Yellow Jackets, the de
fending NCAA champions.
In last year's Championships, the Cardi
nal had its 89-game win streak — spanning
three national titles — broken by Georgia
Tech in the semifinal round.
"Last year, they shocked us." Forood said.
"We didn't really think about Georgia Tech
last year.They certainly weren't on our radar
so it was more of a stunning loss."

2/1 4 Stanford, Calif. 1:30 PM.
GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women suffered a heart
breaking repeat of last year's NCAA semifinal in last
weekend's ITA National Team Indoors, losing to tourna
ment champion Georgia Tech. It was Stanford's first
loss of the dual-match season after the team had won
its first three straight. The Cardinal will try to return to its
winning ways on Thursday against the Gaels of Saint
Mary's, who swept Gonzaga, 7-0, on Saturday.
Intent on not letting history repeat itself,
the Cardinal jumped to an early lead in Satur
day's dual match against the Yellow Jackets.
In doubles,sophomore Lindsay Burdette
and freshman Hilary Barte defeated Kristi
Miller and kirsten Flower. 8-5. Senior Whit
ney Deason and junior Jessica Nguyen also
prevailed 8-5. over Whitney McCray and
Amanda McDowell, to capture the doubles
point.
As a positive note on the weekend, Stan
ford won the doubles point in all three of its
matches at the Indoors.
"We were very unsure about what we
were doing with the doubles a couple weeks
ago," Forood said. "But we finally found

pretty happy with winning these
doubles points."
With a 1 -0 lead in the match. Barte
quickly dispatched McCray 6-1, 7-5
at the No. 3 spot, earning the Cardi

"We did what we wanted to do
coming out," Forood said. "We won
the doubles point and got two quick
wins,and then we got unlucky with ao
injury to Jessica [Nguyen|. We just
couldn't get the third set out of three
different matches."
Georgia Tech would go on to de
feat No. 3 Northwestern in the finals,
avenging a dual-match loss less than
a week ago.
"The fact is that they won the
match, and you have to argue that
they were better than us," Forood
said."But we're certainly right on the
doorstep with them."

If the defeat seemed all too famil

Last year, Georgia Tech upset
Stanford 4-3. also in the semifinals of
the National Team Indoors. The Yel
low Jackets would eventually go on
to capture the NCAA title.
Georgia Tech is one of only two
teams to defeat Stanford in the last
five years. It is also the only team to
have done so twice during that span.
"This year, we certainly knew they
were good, and we knew what was
coming." Forood said. "The fact that
we were awfully close does make it
quite upsetting."
Despite its long weekend, the
Cardinal knows its season is far from
over.
"Our team was frustrated that we
couldn't win one more set and come
away with the win," Forood said.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing
this time of year. We have to work
hard with tough matches later this
month at L.A..Washington and Cal.

in the early rounds.
"We played the No. 11 team in the coun
try in the first round, which was probably the
toughest first round we've ever had to deal
with there," head coach Lele Forood said.
"We had a nice win over Baylor who has
three players in the top-25. Then we had
Miami, which was a good test."
Then came the Yellow Jackets, the de
fending NCAA champions.
In last year's Championships, the Cardi
nal had its 89-game win streak — spanning
three national titles — broken by Georgia
Tech in the semifinal round.
"Last year, they shocked us." Forood said.
"We didn't really think about Georgia Tech
last year.They certainly weren't on our radar
so it was more of a stunning loss."

2/1 4 Stanford, Calif. 1:30 PM.
GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women suffered a heart
breaking repeat of last year's NCAA semifinal in last
weekend's ITA National Team Indoors, losing to tourna
ment champion Georgia Tech. It was Stanford's first
loss of the dual-match season after the team had won
its first three straight. The Cardinal will try to return to its
winning ways on Thursday against the Gaels of Saint
Mary's, who swept Gonzaga, 7-0, on Saturday.
Intent on not letting history repeat itself,
the Cardinal jumped to an early lead in Satur
day's dual match against the Yellow Jackets.
In doubles,sophomore Lindsay Burdette
and freshman Hilary Barte defeated Kristi
Miller and kirsten Flower. 8-5. Senior Whit
ney Deason and junior Jessica Nguyen also
prevailed 8-5. over Whitney McCray and
Amanda McDowell, to capture the doubles
point.
As a positive note on the weekend, Stan
ford won the doubles point in all three of its
matches at the Indoors.
"We were very unsure about what we
were doing with the doubles a couple weeks
ago," Forood said. "But we finally found
these teams playing at the Indoors, and we

decided, 'Wow, we like what we see
now.' For the moment, we're going
with the teams we have, and I'm
pretty happy with winning these
doubles points."
With a 1 -0 lead in the match. Barte
quickly dispatched McCray 6-1, 7-5
at the No. 3 spot, earning the Cardi
nal another point. Senior Celia
Durkin quickly followed with a 7-5,
6-1 victory over Christy Striplin for a
commanding 3-0 Stanford lead.
One more point — that's all that
Was needed to send the Cardinal into
the final round, and to vanquish any
demons left from last year's forget
table tournament.
Unfortunately, vengeance will
have to wait.
With their backs against the wall,
the Yellow Jackets mounted an in
spired comeback to upset top-seeded
Stanford.
The Cardinal collapse began with
freshman Carolyn McVeigh's 6-2,6-3

loss to Noelle Hickey at the No. 6
spot.
McDowell followed with a 4-6,6-
4. 6-2 victory over Nguyen, pulling
the Yellow Jackets even closer, al
though the Card still held the lead.
When Flower defeated Deason 3-
6,6-2,6-3 at No. 5. Stanford had lost
its edge on the match. ITie teams
were now tied.
With the match on the line. Miller
clinched the match with a 6-7 (5). 6-1.
6-3 victory over Burdette at the No. 1
spot.
Game. Set. Match.
"We did what we wanted to do
coming out," Forood said. "We won
the doubles point and got two quick
wins,and then we got unlucky with ao
injury to Jessica [Nguyen|. We just
couldn't get the third set out of three
different matches."
Georgia Tech would go on to de
feat No. 3 Northwestern in the finals,
avenging a dual-match loss less than
a week ago.
"The fact is that they won the
match, and you have to argue that
they were better than us," Forood
said."But we're certainly right on the
doorstep with them."

If the defeat seemed all too famil
iar, perhaps it was.
Last year, Georgia Tech upset
Stanford 4-3. also in the semifinals of
the National Team Indoors. The Yel
low Jackets would eventually go on
to capture the NCAA title.
Georgia Tech is one of only two
teams to defeat Stanford in the last
five years. It is also the only team to
have done so twice during that span.
"This year, we certainly knew they
were good, and we knew what was
coming." Forood said. "The fact that
we were awfully close does make it
quite upsetting."
Despite its long weekend, the
Cardinal knows its season is far from
over.
"Our team was frustrated that we
couldn't win one more set and come
away with the win," Forood said.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing
this time of year. We have to work
hard with tough matches later this
month at L.A..Washington and Cal.
"We have plenty of chances to
prove ourselves."
