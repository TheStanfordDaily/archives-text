## TENNIS OUT IN ITA SEMIS Cardinal women lose 4-3 decision to tournament champion Georgia Tech 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Frustration and disappointment.
Those two words could sum up the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team's exit in the
semifinals of the 2008 National Team In
doors. as the team team ended its tourney hid
with a 4-3 loss to No. 4 Georgia Tech.
The Cardinal entered the Indoors in
Madison, Wise., as the top team in the nation
and the first seed in the draw. Stanford lived
up to its ranking in strong wins against No. 11
Baylor and No. 9 University of Miami (Fla.)
in the early rounds.
"We played the No. 11 team in the coun
try in the first round, which was probably the
toughest first round we've ever had to deal
with there," head coach Lele Forood said.
"We had a nice win over Baylor who has
three players in the top-25. Then we had
Miami, which was a good test."
Then came the Yellow Jackets, the de
fending NCAA champions.
In last year's Championships, the Cardi
nal had its 89-game win streak — spanning
three national titles — broken by Georgia
Tech in the semifinal round.
"Last year, they shocked us." Forood said.
"We didn't really think about Georgia Tech
last year.They certainly weren't on our radar
so it was more of a stunning loss."

the Cardinal jumped to an early lead in Satur

As a positive note on the weekend, Stan
ford won the doubles point in all three of its
matches at the Indoors.

were doing with the doubles a couple weeks
ago," Forood said. "But we finally found
