# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford wins three of four at Invitational 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over a beautiful couple of days over the
weekend, Stanford's women's water polo
team put together a string of strong efforts to
earn third place in the Stanford Invitational
Tournament. And while a third place showing
in the team's own tournament might be con
sidered a let-down—especially for a team
with serious title aspirations like the No. 3

Cardinal — that was certainly not the case
here.
The tournament field included the top five
ranked teams in the country, and three other
teams ranked No. 13 or higher. The Cardinal
finished with a 3-1 record, the only loss com
ing at the hands of No. 2 USC in a narrow one
goal defeat.
Hie Cardinal kicked off the tournament
Saturday morning against Arizona State.
From the beginning, Stanford had no inten

tion of losing to the No. 11 Sun Devils, as the
Card jumped out to a 4-1 lead at the end of the
first quarter, then doubling up its tally to go
up 8-1 at the half.
But the team did not let up then, and it con
tinued the assault to seal the 14-4 victory.
Sophomore driver Kelly Eaton led the way
for the Cardinal, putting in a four-goal per
formance, while senior driver Jackie Gauthier
added three of her own for a hat trick.
While Stanford was able to carry over its

strong defensive effort into the afternoon
match-up with second-ranked USC, it did not
find as much luck on the offensive end.
'ITie game was a defensive struggle, and it
showed with a scoreless first period. Both
teams managed to break their respective
droughts in the second period, although USC
netted three times (all on long shots) to Stan
ford's one, a penalty conversion by junior
driver Lauren Silver.
The game stayed low-scoring — the
score heading into the final minute of
the game was 5-3 in favor of DSC. How
ever, the Cardinal would not give up.
Eaton scored a goal with 38 seconds
left to make it 5-4, and the Stanford de
fense shut down the Trojans to regain
possession with three seconds left. Sil
ver got the hall and fired a difficult long
shot that went off the post as time ex
pired, leaving the Cardinal's comeback
attempt agonizingly short.
However hard to take as the USC
loss may have been, Stanford was
ready to bounce back for Sunday
morning's game against its archrival.
No. 5 Cal. While each team scored two
goals apiece in the first, third and
fourth periods, the Cardinal used the
second period to take control of the
game — it ended up shutting out Cal 5-
0 in that period, sending the team on its
way to an 11-6 victory.
Stanford did a great job taking ad
vantage of penalties in its match with
the Golden Bears — six of their goals
were scored in extra-attacker situa
tions, and Silver also converted two

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal wound up in third
place it its own tournament over the weekend,
but with the only loss coming against the na
tion's second-ranked team, the team had a
good weekend by all accounts. Stanford will
host Pacific in ils MPSF opener on Saturday with
UC-Davis on deck for Sunday. The Tigers got
their first win of the season with an 8-7 victory
over Sonoma State on Saturday after four
straight losses.

more five-meter shots. She ended the
game with four goals, while Gauthier,
and junior drivers Kira Hillman and
Koree Blyleven added a pair each.
Freshman Amber Oland continued her

fine run in goal, making 12 saves.
Hie Cardinal's 2-1 record in the
round-robin stage meant that it would
play in the third place game against
Hawai'i, a team fittingly ranked No. 4
in the nation. Hawai'i started off
strong, but by the end of an exciting
first half, Stanford had knotted the
score up at 6-6.
Stanford then used a third-quarter
run to put the game away, scoring three
times in the period and adding another
in the fourth for a final score of 10-6.
This time, I lillman led the charge with
three goals, and Eaton, Gauthier and
Silver each chipped in two.
"Our team, in general, has positive
thoughts about this weekend," Hillman
said afterwards."We took the loss to be
a stepping stone, showed progress on
the second day and finished strong."
If the Cardinal can turn that strong
finish into momentum for the rest of
the season, Stanford will be very diffi
cult to beat, no matter who the team
plays.

Junior Kira Hillman scored a hat trick in Stanford's 10-6 win over Hawai'i in the third-place game at the Stanford Invitational
this weekend. In the team's four games, Hillman finished with five goals, with a pair against Cal to go with the three against
the Rainbow Wahine. Stanford's only loss on the weekend was a battle with No. 2 USC which the Trojans won by just one goal.
