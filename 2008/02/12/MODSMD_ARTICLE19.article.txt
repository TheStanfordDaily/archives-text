# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford wins three of four at Invitational 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over a beautiful couple of days over the
weekend, Stanford's women's water polo
team put together a string of strong efforts to
earn third place in the Stanford Invitational
Tournament. And while a third place showing
in the team's own tournament might be con
sidered a let-down—especially for a team
with serious title aspirations like the No. 3

Cardinal — that was certainly not the case
here.
The tournament field included the top five
ranked teams in the country, and three other
teams ranked No. 13 or higher. The Cardinal
finished with a 3-1 record, the only loss com
ing at the hands of No. 2 USC in a narrow one
goal defeat.
Hie Cardinal kicked off the tournament
Saturday morning against Arizona State.
From the beginning, Stanford had no inten

tion of losing to the No. 11 Sun Devils, as the
Card jumped out to a 4-1 lead at the end of the
first quarter, then doubling up its tally to go
up 8-1 at the half.
But the team did not let up then, and it con
tinued the assault to seal the 14-4 victory.
Sophomore driver Kelly Eaton led the way
for the Cardinal, putting in a four-goal per
formance, while senior driver Jackie Gauthier
added three of her own for a hat trick.
While Stanford was able to carry over its

strong defensive effort into the afternoon
match-up with second-ranked USC, it did not
find as much luck on the offensive end.
'ITie game was a defensive struggle, and it
showed with a scoreless first period. Both
teams managed to break their respective
droughts in the second period, although USC
netted three times (all on long shots) to Stan
ford's one, a penalty conversion by junior
