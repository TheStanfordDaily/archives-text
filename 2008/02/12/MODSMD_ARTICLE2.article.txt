## Housing weighs ID dorm entry New dorm access system to strengthen campus security 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of this month's
Governor's Corner robberies, Stanford
administrators are looking to improve
both student awareness and security
systems — perhaps by implementing an
SUID card-based access system for
campus residences.
A task force has been at work for
months — even before the recent rob
beries took place — planning longer
term policy proposals.
"One of the recommendations the
task force will be making is to imple
ment a card access system that would
enable people to use their SUIl) to
access buildings." said Chief of Police
Laura Wilson. "This proposal, which has
not yet been finalized or presented to
the University decision makers, would
be a huge undertaking and would
require several years to implement
[fully]."
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney said such
plans could commence in the coming
months.
"We're certainly looking to start
with the residences," Whitney said.
"The hope is that some of this will be in
place as early as the fall."
A move toward card access would
mimic similar systems at universities
across the country; students at Amherst.
Harvard and Yale all enter dorm build
ings by swiping their student identifica
tion cards, using keys for their actual
rooms. At bigger schools such as UC-
Berkeley and New York University, stu
dents check in with security guards, who
verify identification and sign in guests
— students then proceed to their rooms,
which they enter with a key.
Still, data suggests that most
Stanford students tend to feel safe on
campus. Soon-to-be-published results

from the annual Winter Housing
Survey rank students' "sense of safety"
at 4.6/5, a figure that is in keeping with
historically high trends.

Flood victims return home
Affected Mirrielees residents have
easy transition to restored rooms
By STEPHANIE WERNER
Several students affected by the Jan. 22
Mirrielees apartment fire and subsequent flood

ments. according to Imogen Hinds, associate
director of Student Housing for Operations.
()thers are scheduled to move back in on Friday.
"Apartment restoration work is going very
well," Hinds wrote in an email to The Daily.
'Students in the first-floor apartments moved

remarkably well.

A truck fire broke out in a parking lot
behind the Graduate School of Business
late yesterday afternoon after flames
appeared in the vehicle's engine compart
ment.
Although no one was injured, the fire
scorched the front and driver's side of the
Office Max supply truck before being
contained.
"It was cooking," said Captain Barry
Marchisio of the Palo Alto Fire
Department. "The fire was pretty
involved by the time we got there."
Firefighters used about 2(K) gallons of
water to put out the blaze. Marchisio said.
Six firefighters responded to the scene
after receiving an emergency call at 4:24
p.m. A Stanford Police officer attempted
to put out the flames using a fire extin
guisher but was unsuccessful, as oil
leaked onto the ground, according to
Mark Shah, an operator at the Palo Alto
Fire Department.
Firefighters said the flames may have
emerged as a result of a gasoline or elec
trical problem in the engine compartment
in the front of the car. The fire consumed
the hood of the vehicle and melted its
driver-side door.
Marchisio said firefighters had to
shatter the passenger side window to
gain access to the interior of the truck.
They also cut the padlock leading into
the cargo hold to put out flames that may
have engulfed any office supplies within.
Although damage was contained to
the truck itself, Marchisio said there were
several cars and trees in the area that
could have been threatened by the bla/e.
Ihe driver of the truck had gone to
make a delivery when the fire began, he
said.
Marchisio said the firefighters also
absorbed oil that had spilled on the
ground to prevent it from dumping into a
nearby storm drain.

Most dorms receive

By NIKHIL JOSHI
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
The complaints may not he flowing in anymore, but
students are still struggling to adjust to the new low-flow
showerheads installed in all campus residences last
month.
At a meeting last week. Resident Assistants (RAs)
from across campus came up with a way to ease residents'
showering woes — install either one high-flow shower
head or one handheld showerhead in each dormitory
bathroom.
The decision, however, was not an easy one.
"It was fairly contentious because there are lots of
complaints about the showerheads and whether they
meet the standards of the students." said Brainier RA
Fagan I larris '(R "After a little bit of debate, we decided
that it is important to look for alternate means to satiate
student needs."
Student Mousing has been working closely with resi
dents throughout the showerhead retrofit process and has
agreed to take action on the RAs' proposal.
"Student Mousing is very appreciative of the RAs and
other students who have shared their feedback and sug

aren't always doing what they
should in terms of following the
policies."
Stanford's current security poli

cies rest on the assumption of stu
dent compliance with clauses in res
idential contracts, including follow
ing proper security measures. The
adoption of ID-card entry still
would not necessarily prevent
potential student neglect.
"There is an expectation that
people are going to use common
sense when it comes to safety and
security," Wilson said. "Do not prop
doors open. Do not allow strangers
into the dormitory. Do not allow
people you do not know to follow

you into your dormitory. These are
pretty basic concepts, but people
violate them every day."
Ensuring dorm security at
Stanford is a shared responsibility
between the Department of Public
Safety. Residential Education and
Student Housing. Administrators
expressed a positive opinion about
cooperation between the depart
ments and the benefits of dialogue
as they head toward continuing
improvements.
"We are constantly in communi

cation and discussion about safety
and security," said Interim Director
of Residential Education John
Pearson. "It is important to note the
need for constant reminders and
vigilance."
While there is strong support for
card access in dorms, guards in
dorm entrances are not part of any
plans for the near future.
"Fortunately, the level of crime
on our campus does not warrant
that level of security," Wilson said.
In considering any improve

ments, administrators all agreed on
the importance of preserving an
open campus culture while keeping
safety as a number one priority.
"We don't want the campus to
feel like Fort Knox, we want it to feel
like home," Whitney said. "And it's

A truck fire broke out in a parking lot
behind the Graduate School of Business
late yesterday afternoon after flames
appeared in the vehicle's engine compart
ment.
Although no one was injured, the fire
scorched the front and driver's side of the
Office Max supply truck before being
contained.
"It was cooking," said Captain Barry
Marchisio of the Palo Alto Fire
Department. "The fire was pretty
involved by the time we got there."
Firefighters used about 2(K) gallons of
water to put out the blaze. Marchisio said.
Six firefighters responded to the scene
after receiving an emergency call at 4:24
p.m. A Stanford Police officer attempted
to put out the flames using a fire extin
guisher but was unsuccessful, as oil
leaked onto the ground, according to
Mark Shah, an operator at the Palo Alto
Fire Department.
Firefighters said the flames may have
emerged as a result of a gasoline or elec
trical problem in the engine compartment
in the front of the car. The fire consumed
the hood of the vehicle and melted its
driver-side door.
Marchisio said firefighters had to
shatter the passenger side window to
gain access to the interior of the truck.
They also cut the padlock leading into
the cargo hold to put out flames that may
have engulfed any office supplies within.
Although damage was contained to
the truck itself, Marchisio said there were
several cars and trees in the area that
could have been threatened by the bla/e.
Ihe driver of the truck had gone to
make a delivery when the fire began, he
said.
Marchisio said the firefighters also
absorbed oil that had spilled on the
ground to prevent it from dumping into a
nearby storm drain.

showering woes — install either one high-flow shower
head or one handheld showerhead in each dormitory
bathroom.
The decision, however, was not an easy one.
"It was fairly contentious because there are lots of
complaints about the showerheads and whether they
meet the standards of the students." said Brainier RA
Fagan I larris '(R "After a little bit of debate, we decided
that it is important to look for alternate means to satiate
student needs."
Student Mousing has been working closely with resi
dents throughout the showerhead retrofit process and has
agreed to take action on the RAs' proposal.
"Student Mousing is very appreciative of the RAs and
other students who have shared their feedback and sug
gestions with regard to the new showerheads," Chief
Mousing Officer Rodger Whitney wrote in an email to

A sign on the door of Robinson House, where a string of burglaries occurred this
month, warns residents to take proper safety precautions
don't engage in safe practices
because they feel so secure. People
aren't always doing what they
should in terms of following the
policies."
Stanford's current security poli

cies rest on the assumption of stu
dent compliance with clauses in res
idential contracts, including follow
ing proper security measures. The
adoption of ID-card entry still
would not necessarily prevent
potential student neglect.
"There is an expectation that
people are going to use common
sense when it comes to safety and
security," Wilson said. "Do not prop
doors open. Do not allow strangers
into the dormitory. Do not allow
people you do not know to follow

you into your dormitory. These are
pretty basic concepts, but people
violate them every day."
Ensuring dorm security at
Stanford is a shared responsibility
between the Department of Public
Safety. Residential Education and
Student Housing. Administrators
expressed a positive opinion about
cooperation between the depart
ments and the benefits of dialogue
as they head toward continuing
improvements.
"We are constantly in communi

cation and discussion about safety
and security," said Interim Director
of Residential Education John
Pearson. "It is important to note the
need for constant reminders and
vigilance."
While there is strong support for
card access in dorms, guards in
dorm entrances are not part of any
plans for the near future.
"Fortunately, the level of crime
on our campus does not warrant
that level of security," Wilson said.
In considering any improve

ments, administrators all agreed on
the importance of preserving an
open campus culture while keeping
safety as a number one priority.
"We don't want the campus to
feel like Fort Knox, we want it to feel
like home," Whitney said. "And it's
all about finding that balance
between keeping Stanford special
and being aware of what's around
