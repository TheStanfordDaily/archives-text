## Weighing the Shaq tradeoffs 
### 
The Phoenix Suns' trade of for
ward Shawn Marion and
guard Marcus Banks for the
Miami Heat's Shaquille O'Neal has
been lambasted by fans and sports
journalists alike. Pundits from
ESPN, the blogosphere and local
newspapers met the trade with be
fuddlement. Fans shared their senti
ment: 71 percent of respondents in
an ESPN poll said the trade was bad
for the Suns.
But, in my opinion, both sides
benefited from the deal.
The Heat receives one of the
most versatile defenders in the
game — Marion will routinely be
put on guard. Offensively, he may fi
nally be able to shine in Miami. De
spite a career point average in the
high teens, Marion has always been
overshadowed by his teammates,
from Stephon Marbury to Steve
Nash to Joe Johnson to Amare
Stoudamire. He has never been"the
man," so he has thrived in a support
role. But he has yearned to be a
leader and, along with Dwayne
Wade, he can be that in Miami.
The Heat won't be making any
playoffs runs this year — they have
yet to reach 10 wins — but it is a
solid investment toward their fu
ture. Marion, along with Wade and
forward Udonis Haslem, form a
solid and fairly young core.
Marion has an opt-out clause in
his contract, but, even if he uses it.
the Heat will still benefit. If Marion
chooses to leave this summer,
Miami can clear out a massive
amount of cap room — right now.
he has the 10th biggest contract in
the NBA. With that cash in hand, the
Heat can actively pursue young,
budding stars and valuable role
players. They would have one of the
largest budgets in the league.
Let's also not entirely count out
Banks. 1 le's no star, but he's a formi
dable backup who provides a steady
hand off the bench.
With or without Marion, Miami
is building for the future. But the
Suns are a viable threat in the com
petitive Western Conference now.
