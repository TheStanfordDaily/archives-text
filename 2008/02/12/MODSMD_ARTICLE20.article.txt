## Weighing the Shaq tradeoffs 
### 
The Phoenix Suns' trade of for
ward Shawn Marion and
guard Marcus Banks for the
Miami Heat's Shaquille O'Neal has
been lambasted by fans and sports
journalists alike. Pundits from
ESPN, the blogosphere and local
newspapers met the trade with be
fuddlement. Fans shared their senti
ment: 71 percent of respondents in
an ESPN poll said the trade was bad
for the Suns.
But, in my opinion, both sides
benefited from the deal.
The Heat receives one of the
most versatile defenders in the
game — Marion will routinely be
put on guard. Offensively, he may fi
nally be able to shine in Miami. De
spite a career point average in the
high teens, Marion has always been
overshadowed by his teammates,
from Stephon Marbury to Steve
Nash to Joe Johnson to Amare
Stoudamire. He has never been"the
man," so he has thrived in a support
role. But he has yearned to be a
leader and, along with Dwayne
Wade, he can be that in Miami.
The Heat won't be making any
playoffs runs this year — they have
yet to reach 10 wins — but it is a
solid investment toward their fu
ture. Marion, along with Wade and
forward Udonis Haslem, form a
solid and fairly young core.
Marion has an opt-out clause in
his contract, but, even if he uses it.
the Heat will still benefit. If Marion
chooses to leave this summer,
Miami can clear out a massive
amount of cap room — right now.
he has the 10th biggest contract in
the NBA. With that cash in hand, the
Heat can actively pursue young,
budding stars and valuable role
players. They would have one of the
largest budgets in the league.
Let's also not entirely count out
Banks. 1 le's no star, but he's a formi
dable backup who provides a steady
hand off the bench.
With or without Marion, Miami
is building for the future. But the
Suns are a viable threat in the com
petitive Western Conference now.
arid they need stability in the post to
change their playoff fortunes.
Phoenix runs a fast-paced "run
'n' gun" offense. They excel in tran
sition, and Nash and Leandro Bar
bosa control the offense on the go.
But while that method works in
the regular season, it's failed in the
postseason. In the 2005 and 2006
playoffs, the Suns lost in the West
ern Conference finals, and last year
they only made it to the second
round. The Dallas Mavericks run a
similar attack, and they were ousted
by the Golden State Warriors in the
first round last year in one of the
great playoff upsets of the modern
basketball era.
The perennial force in the West,
the San Antonio Spurs, run a tight
and fundamental half-court offense.
So did the East's former top dog, the

Detroit Pistons. It's not nearly as ex
citing as the Suns' or Mavericks' at
tacks, but it is far more effective in
the playoffs.
In order to succeed, the Suns
need to slow their offense down and
add defense in the post. Marion is
an excellent defender, but he isn't a
traditional, low-block stopper like
the Spurs' Tim Duncan or the Pis
tons' Rasheed Wallace.
Enter Shaq.
Even in his later years. O'Neal is
still a post threat on both sides of
the ball. Marion preferred to roam
around the court, which gave the
Suns two forwards (with
Stoudamire) that were better away
from the basket.
But now Shaq will match-up di
rectly with the Duncans of the
world, both on offense and on de
fense. Phoenix's attack feed into
him in the post, which frees up
Stoudamire at mid-range and Nash
and Barbosa on the perimeter. And
on defense, the Suns finally have a
true stopper. Shaq remains one of

the biggest men in the game —
there will be no easy buckets for op
posing post players.
The Suns can still run-n'-gun
when Shaq takes his much-needed
breaks. In short bursts in the play
offs, it can be effective. But when
O'Neal is in the game. Phoenix can
slow everything down, and Shaq can
bang through worn-out opponents
as his teammates spread the rest of
the court.
Shaq certainly has lost a step
he's no longer the first option that
he was for so much of his career —
but he is far from done. While this is
certainly a short-term solution for
the Suns, it instantly makes their
team more viable for immediate
postseason success.
Phoenix hedged their bets to
capitalize on the present. With Shaq
on their side, a championship be
comes increasingly more attainable.
