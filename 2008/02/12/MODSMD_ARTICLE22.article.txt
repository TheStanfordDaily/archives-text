Three Cardinal players prepare for
NFL Combine
Over 300 of the NCAA's best football players will be
at the NFL Scouting Combine, held Feb. 20-26 in Indi
anapolis. Three of them will be representing Stanford.
Senior quarterback T.C. Ostrander and senior wide
receivers Mark Bradford and Evan Moore were all in
vited to the Combine, according to a wire report from
Inside Bay Area.
The Combine has been known to influence the draft
status and potential of a number of players. A good
showing can catapult a player several rounds, while a
weaker showing may cause a player not to be drafted at
all. As the NFL's site states, the week-long event is an
"intense, four-day job interview" and an "exciting time
for the athletes and a vital step in achieving their dreams
of playing in the NFL."
Ostrander, a native of nearby Atherton, will look to
make his mark at the Combine after leading Stanford to
a Big Game win over Cal in his final collegiate game.
Bradford — who gained noticeable notoriety after his
game-winning catch at No. 2 USC on Oct. 6 — is top
live in receptions and receiving yards in program histo
ry. 1 le hopes to impress the NFL scouts with his athleti
cism and route-running ability.
As for Moore, the 6-foot-7 talent will have the per
fect opportunity to prove the assertion he made back in
a November interview with The Daily.
"There's nothing that's going to stop me from mak
ing the next level," he said." I know it's going to happen."
Lynn and Buh take command
of defense
Stanford football's void at defensive coordinator no
longer remains.
The team named Ron Lynn as the team's assistant
coach and co-defensive coordinator last Friday; line
backers coach Andy Buh will also team up with Lynn as
co-defensive coordinator. The two coaches replace for
mer defensive coordinator Scott Shafer, who left Stan
ford to coach at Michigan.
"We're tremendously excited to add Ron Lynn to
our staff," head coach Jim Harbaugh told
(3oStanford.com. "He brings a wealth of football
knowledge and experience to our staff
that our players and coaches will ben
efit from. I feel like we have one of the
great defensive minds in the country.
"I've really been pleased with
Andy Huh," Harbaughed added.
"Andy is a very talented coach, and we
felt that our linebackers were ex
tremely well-coached last season, and
it showed on the field."
