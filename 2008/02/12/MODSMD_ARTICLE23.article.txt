they have shown us."

Freshman Josh Charnin-Aker showed in
credible progress in the 200 backstroke with a
time of 1:51.40. which was his season best. Stan
ford will count on Charnin-Aker to push for
NCAA points in the 200 backstroke along with
Godsoe, one of the best backslrokers in col
lege.
Godsoe won the 1 (X) back with a solid time
of 48.91 as junior captain Nate Cass followed
with a first place effort in the 100 breast.
"One thing that has helped the team in gen
eral is the emphasis [head coach] Skip (Ken
ney] and [associate head coach] Ted [Knapp]
put on race details," Cass said. "It's OK if your
stroke feels different in a race, longer, more
powerful, more propulsive, but the turns and
the start and other small details must be exact
ly the same in practice as in a race — otherwise
you won't feel comfortable with your swim
ming when you race."
Junior Jason Dunford continued the Stan
ford winning streak in the 50 free, while junior
Paul Zaich finished the meet with a win in the
200 breast.
The next day, Stanford traveled visited L.A.
to face USC and won handily once again, 160-
129. Mosko won three individual events to lead
the Cardinal effort.
"There are very important and big things
that are expected of the freshmen after what
they have already shown us," said junior Jason
Dunford."The future of this team is exceeding
ly bright with a great class coming in next year,
as well."
In the 1000 free, Mosko won for the second
day in a row, Charnin-Aker followed closely
behind and freshman Scotty Korotkin took
third for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish.
In the 200 free, senior captain Phillip Morri
son finished first in 1:39.46, narrowly edging
