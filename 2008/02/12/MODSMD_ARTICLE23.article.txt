Stanford (3-1,2-1 Pac-10) cruised to a 166-
115 victory at Bakersfield Friday afternoon,
holding the top time in every event.
Its first win came as the 200 medley relay
team of sophomore Eugene Godsoe, junior
captain Paul Kornfeld, freshman Austin Staab
and sophomore David Dunford won the sprint
relay in 1:30.78.
Freshman standout David Mosko won dou
ble events, in the 1000 free and the 200 fly. Se
nior Nathan Kim won the diving competition
with a score of 354.68.

"There are big things
expected from the
freshmen after what
they have shown us."

Freshman Josh Charnin-Aker showed in
credible progress in the 200 backstroke with a
time of 1:51.40. which was his season best. Stan
ford will count on Charnin-Aker to push for
NCAA points in the 200 backstroke along with
Godsoe, one of the best backslrokers in col
lege.
Godsoe won the 1 (X) back with a solid time
of 48.91 as junior captain Nate Cass followed
with a first place effort in the 100 breast.
"One thing that has helped the team in gen
eral is the emphasis [head coach] Skip (Ken
ney] and [associate head coach] Ted [Knapp]
put on race details," Cass said. "It's OK if your
stroke feels different in a race, longer, more
powerful, more propulsive, but the turns and
the start and other small details must be exact
ly the same in practice as in a race — otherwise
you won't feel comfortable with your swim
ming when you race."
Junior Jason Dunford continued the Stan
ford winning streak in the 50 free, while junior
Paul Zaich finished the meet with a win in the
200 breast.
The next day, Stanford traveled visited L.A.
to face USC and won handily once again, 160-
129. Mosko won three individual events to lead
the Cardinal effort.
"There are very important and big things
that are expected of the freshmen after what
they have already shown us," said junior Jason
Dunford."The future of this team is exceeding
ly bright with a great class coming in next year,
as well."
In the 1000 free, Mosko won for the second
day in a row, Charnin-Aker followed closely
behind and freshman Scotty Korotkin took
third for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish.
In the 200 free, senior captain Phillip Morri
son finished first in 1:39.46, narrowly edging
out USC's Zoltan Povalzsy, who came in at
1:39.58. Sophomore Andrew Trepp also had a
strong swim in 1:39.86 to take third, while jun
ior Dan Priestly finished fifth.
The relay team of Godsoe, Korn
feld, Staab and Jason Dunford won in
3:15.74 in the 400-yard medley relay.
Senior Egan Gans stepped up to
win the 1(K) back in a solid time of
49.02, unexpectedly, since Gans is
usually used as a breaststroker. Ju
nior Scott Lathrope finished fifth.
Stanford then won the 100 breast
stroke with another 1-2-3 finish with
Kornfeld leading the way, followed
by Cass and freshman John Criste.
Kornfeld also won the 200 breast,
followed by Zaich, Criste and junior
Chris Ash.
Mosko once again dominated the
200 fly to win for the second day in a
row. In the 50 free, David Dunford
edged out a very quick USC senior
captain Richard Gosper, 19.96 to
20.17. Staab finished in 20.48 to take
third.
Freshman Brent Eichenseer won
the one-meter dive event with a
score of 317.17. Senior Nathan Kim
dominated the three-meter dive
with a score of 340.35, followed by
Eichenseer with 312.15.
Jason Dunford won the 100 free
in a quick 43.65. and Godsoe won
the 200 back in 1:46.11. a very strong
time as a result of not swimming the
100 back won by Gans.
Mosko completed his third win
for the day. turning in a 4:30.95 for
the 500 free, followed by Morrison
in 4:32.41.
Stanford will have its last dual
meet in two weeks when Cal comes
to Avery Aquatic Center on Satur
day, Feb. 23. Stanford will then start
its postseason at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships. where the Cardinal has
won 27 consecutive titles.
