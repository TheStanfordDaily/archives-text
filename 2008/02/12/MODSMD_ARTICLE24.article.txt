## Card earns MPSF split in SoCal Stanford beats Cal Poly, but comes up short at Fullerton 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
While the Stanford wrestling team certainly hoped
for a cleaner finish to the weekend, the Cardinal
nonetheless came that much closer to the postseason
that it has been building toward all season. After com
peting in two conference duals, just one opponent now
stands between Stanford and the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, which raises an important ques
tion— just how ready is the Cardinal for events at
which the stakes are simple: win or go home?
"1 think we're in a good spot." head coach Kerry
McCoy said. "We've got a bunch of guys that feel like
they can win individually And if we can get a bunch of
guys going, get the 30 guys on the team to believe not
that we can but that we will win [the Pac-10 title], then
we're going to do really well at the tournament, and
that's what it really comes down to."
Over the weekend, the Cardinal (12-4, 5-3 Pac-10)
split a pair of duals against conference rivals, soundly
defeating Cal Poly on Friday, 27-16, before being
trounced in its final home match of the year by No. 24
Cal State-Fullerton on Sunday, 25-17.
Against the Mustangs (5-6,4-4), Stanford won six of
10 matches. In the mid- and upper-weight classes, the
usual suspects prevailed for the Cardinal. No. 10 senior
Josh Zupancic at 157 pounds pinned his opponent at
4:48. junior Luke Feist won a 9-3 decision at 174
pounds and sophomores Zack Giesen and Jake John
son won by decision and technical fall at 184 and 197
pounds, respectively.
Also tallying wins were freshman Austin Quarles at
125 pounds, who won a victory by default, and senior
No. 6 Tanner Gardner, who wrestled up a weight class
in the 133-pound bracket, earning a 14-2 major deci
sion victory.
"Friday was a big win — it's always good to beat
Poly," Gardner said. "I guess I say everybody's our
rival, but it's true everybody in your conference is your
rival, so that was a great win for the team. We went
down there and fought hard, and we won some big
matches."
Against the 24th-ranked Titans, however, victories
were much more difficult for the Cardinal to come by.
Stanford's upperclass stalwarts each won in dominant
fashion, as Gardner and Feist pinned their opponents
in the first period at 2:50 and 2:43, respectively, and Zu
pancic claimed a victory by technical fall. 19-3.
The trio of big wins earned McCoy's squad 17 points
and kept the Cardinal in the match late, but Stanford
wrestlers proved unable to win any other matches.
Giesen came closest to a win among the other Cardinal
wrestlers, falling 4-3 to No. 12 lan Murphy in a hotly
contested match.
"On paper, these guys were favored seven matches
to three," McCoy said. "And they won seven matches.
That's one thing about a dual meet — momentum
starts going your way, guys start picking up the pace
and scoring those points."
"We kind of stalled today, [but] it was a tough dual,
wrestling the No. 1 team in the Pac-10,but 1 thought we
didn't back down," Gardner added. "I thought we
wrestled hard, and every guy went out there and just
fought. A couple of matches didn't go our way. and we
