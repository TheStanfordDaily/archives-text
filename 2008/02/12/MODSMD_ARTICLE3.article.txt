# Students continue CAMPAIGN EFFORTS
## Dem. supporters break briefly after CA primary 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Matt I laney can finally get some sleep again.
The first-year law student and Stanford
Students for Obama chapter director managed
onl\ one hour of shut-eye — in the back seat of a
car parked outside the Obama headquarters, no
less in the three days leading up to Super
Tuesday. A week later. 1 laney has his life back
somewhat.
I ike a handful of Stanford students supporting
either Sen. Barack Obama (D-lll.) or Sen. Hillary
C linton (l)-N.Y). I laney continues to plug away.
With the Democratic primary in a dead heat, both
campaigns have settled in for a prolonged fight
over the coming weeks and months, one that will
continue to rely on campus leaders' efforts
despite the focus shifting away from California.
"I'm probably in the category of people who
should be disengaging, but having a hard time
doing it." I laney said, "I don't think people are

ready to walk away completely yet."
After logging 15-hour days campaigning,
returning to the classroom hasn't come easy to
those like I laney. With a long primary ahead, and
the constant stream ot news available on the 24-
hour news cycle, the politics fix is an omnipresent
temptation.
"It's hard to stop while this is going on." I laney
said. "I still spend most of my time reading blogs,
news and the polls, instead of silting in class or
studying in the library."
After sweeping this weekend's Louisiana pri
mary and caucuses in Washington. Nebraska and
Maine. Obama still slightly trails Clinton in
pledged delegates by most counts. Today's
"Potomac Primary." however, in which the Illinois
senator is up big in polls, could give Obama an
undisputed lead.
Campus Clinton supporters, meanwhile, were
undeterred.
"We're going to keep doing what
we've been doing," said Mishan
Araujo '08, who was head of
Northern California Women for
Hillary Clinton.
The Clinton San Francisco field
office closed after Super Tuesday,
Araujo said, but she and a handful
of hardcore supporters have contin
ued their phone banking and
fundraising efforts. The Clinton
campaign has its eyes set on dele
gate-rich primaries in Ohio and
Texas in early March, expecting
Obama to perform well in the
smaller primaries and caucuses in
the coming weeks.
"The next couple weeks are
going to be hard." Araujo said.
"We're just going to wait until after
Mar. 2 to reassess where the cam
paign is and where our next steps
should be."
The Obama campaign, too,
knows the important role Texas and
Ohio will play in the Democratic
nomination process. But getting
momentum going before March has
been an important focus, as well.
The Obama team sent five students
to Washintiton for the caucus last

weekend, and several die-hards
have already headed out to the
Lone Star State.
"There's definitely still a lot
going on our end," said Obama sup
porter Charlie Davis '08. Davis, a
Washington native, was one of five
who went to his home state to help
with the caucus — a process he
described as "really rewarding."
The ultimate reward — the
Democratic nomination — remains
a distant goal for either side. Both
campaigns are well aware of the dif
ficulties involved in gaining, and
then keeping, the momentum need
ed to shore up supporters.
"I'm confident in the campaign,"
Araujo said. "But when you lose a
couple states, the perception is a lit
tle more difficult."
For the Obama campaign, win
ning also brings its pitfalls. Students
expressed worry that this month's
victories could lull supporters into a
false sense of security, much as it did
after Obama's victory in the lowa
caucuses last month.
"After lowa, 1 thought we were
going to have it, win new
Hampshire, and be unstoppable,"
Haney recalled. "But that taught us
to put our heads down and work
for it."
