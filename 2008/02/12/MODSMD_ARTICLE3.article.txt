# Students continue CAMPAIGN EFFORTS
## Dem. supporters break briefly after CA primary 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Matt I laney can finally get some sleep again.
The first-year law student and Stanford
Students for Obama chapter director managed
onl\ one hour of shut-eye â€” in the back seat of a
car parked outside the Obama headquarters, no
less in the three days leading up to Super
Tuesday. A week later. 1 laney has his life back
somewhat.
I ike a handful of Stanford students supporting
either Sen. Barack Obama (D-lll.) or Sen. Hillary
C linton (l)-N.Y). I laney continues to plug away.
With the Democratic primary in a dead heat, both
campaigns have settled in for a prolonged fight
over the coming weeks and months, one that will
continue to rely on campus leaders' efforts
despite the focus shifting away from California.
"I'm probably in the category of people who
should be disengaging, but having a hard time
doing it." I laney said, "I don't think people are

ready to walk away completely yet."
After logging 15-hour days campaigning,
returning to the classroom hasn't come easy to
those like I laney. With a long primary ahead, and
the constant stream ot news available on the 24-
hour news cycle, the politics fix is an omnipresent
temptation.
"It's hard to stop while this is going on." I laney
said. "I still spend most of my time reading blogs,
news and the polls, instead of silting in class or
studying in the library."
After sweeping this weekend's Louisiana pri
mary and caucuses in Washington. Nebraska and
Maine. Obama still slightly trails Clinton in
pledged delegates by most counts. Today's
"Potomac Primary." however, in which the Illinois
senator is up big in polls, could give Obama an
undisputed lead.
Campus Clinton supporters, meanwhile, were
undeterred.
