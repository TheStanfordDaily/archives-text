### STEPHANIE WERNER 
Several students affected by the Jan. 22
Mirrielees apartment fire and subsequent flood
ing have moved back into their repaired apart
ments. according to Imogen Hinds, associate
director of Student Housing for Operations.
()thers are scheduled to move back in on Friday.
"Apartment restoration work is going very
well," Hinds wrote in an email to The Daily.
'Students in the first-floor apartments moved
back into their apartments on Friday, Feb. I.The
second-floor apartments were ready for residents

to move back in on Friday, Feb. 8. Work on the
third-floor apartment is finishing up this week, so
those residents should be able to move in at that
point."
Students said that moving out of their apart
ments was an inconvenience, especially during
midterms, but that Housing handled the situation
remarkably well.
Pra Chandrasoma '09 and one of his Mirrielees
roommates were relocated to Burbank during the
repairs.
"It's a place to hang our hat until this is all sort
ed out." Chandrasoma said. "We had all of our
stuff... so it as basically just a matter of taking it
from one place to another."
"Given the situation, it's as good as it could
possibly be." he added. "No one was
hurt, not that much of my stuff was
damaged and the stuff that was
[damaged] was replaced by
Stanford. I'm not really complain
ing."
T.J. Harris '09. Chandrasoma's
roommate who was responsible for
the kitchen fire, said that he is
unsure if he and his roommates will

be able to move back in this Friday
"because, looking in the room, it
seems like there's a lot of work to be
done."
Because Mirrielees residents live
in apartments with kitchens and are
responsible for their own meals.
Student Housing "put about $100 a
week iinto our cards, essentially like
a week-by-week meal plan for the
dining halls," said Doug Witt '09.
who was also displaced.
Witt stressed that while the situa
tion was unfortunate and undesir
able, he does not have any com
plaints against Housing.

"There's nothing they could have
done," he said.
Paul Lockhart-Korris '09, who
moved back in a few days ago, said
he was pleased with the quality of
the repairs.
"The room is like brand new," he
said. "They knocked out the walls,
the ceiling, the carpet and the floors.
It reeks of paint, which is kind of a
problem. We were concerned about
it, and they told us it's non-toxic
paint."
Armando Solis '09, another tem
porarily displaced Mirrielees resi
dent, agreed that the relocation

process went smoothly.
"My roommates and I are just
really happy right now to be back in
our room, finally,"he said.
As for Harris, when he moves
back in, he said he is "definitely
investing in a kitchen extinguisher."
"I'll make fun of him forever,"
Chandrasoma said. "I probably
earned that one, the right to consis
tently and forever ridicule and deni
grate him. 1 think that's, like, my
God-given right at this point."
