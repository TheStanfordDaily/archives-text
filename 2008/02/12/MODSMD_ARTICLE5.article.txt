# Supply truck ignites in parking lot
## No injuries or damage reported in afternoon blaze 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
A truck fire broke out in a parking lot
behind the Graduate School of Business
late yesterday afternoon after flames
appeared in the vehicle's engine compart
ment.
Although no one was injured, the fire
scorched the front and driver's side of the
Office Max supply truck before being
contained.
"It was cooking," said Captain Barry
Marchisio of the Palo Alto Fire
Department. "The fire was pretty
involved by the time we got there."
Firefighters used about 2(K) gallons of
water to put out the blaze. Marchisio said.
Six firefighters responded to the scene
after receiving an emergency call at 4:24
p.m. A Stanford Police officer attempted
to put out the flames using a fire extin
guisher but was unsuccessful, as oil
leaked onto the ground, according to
Mark Shah, an operator at the Palo Alto

Fire Department.
Firefighters said the flames may have
emerged as a result of a gasoline or elec
trical problem in the engine compartment
in the front of the car. The fire consumed
the hood of the vehicle and melted its
driver-side door.
Marchisio said firefighters had to
shatter the passenger side window to

gain access to the interior of the truck.
They also cut the padlock leading into
the cargo hold to put out flames that may
have engulfed any office supplies within.
Although damage was contained to
the truck itself, Marchisio said there were
several cars and trees in the area that
could have been threatened by the bla/e.
Ihe driver of the truck had gone to

make a delivery when the fire began, he
said.
Marchisio said the firefighters also
absorbed oil that had spilled on the
ground to prevent it from dumping into a
nearby storm drain.
