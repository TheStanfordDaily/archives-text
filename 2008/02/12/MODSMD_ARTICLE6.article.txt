## Most dorms receive one old showerhead After student complaints. plan places powerful showerhead in each bathroom 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The complaints may not he flowing in anymore, but
students are still struggling to adjust to the new low-flow
showerheads installed in all campus residences last
month.
At a meeting last week. Resident Assistants (RAs)
from across campus came up with a way to ease residents'
showering woes â€” install either one high-flow shower
head or one handheld showerhead in each dormitory
bathroom.
The decision, however, was not an easy one.
"It was fairly contentious because there are lots of
complaints about the showerheads and whether they
meet the standards of the students." said Brainier RA
Fagan I larris '(R "After a little bit of debate, we decided
that it is important to look for alternate means to satiate
student needs."
Student Mousing has been working closely with resi
dents throughout the showerhead retrofit process and has
agreed to take action on the RAs' proposal.
"Student Mousing is very appreciative of the RAs and
other students who have shared their feedback and sug
gestions with regard to the new showerheads," Chief
Mousing Officer Rodger Whitney wrote in an email to
The Daily. "We are happy to hear a
strong consensus emerge around
the idea of keeping the new low
flow showerheads in order to pro
mote water conservation, in addi
tion to providing the choice of a
higher-flow shower head for those
who need it."
The RAs' plan is unique in that it
is the first effort to address both
water flow concerns and the old
problem of showerhead height.
"[The plan] will address the
recent concerns about shower flow
as well as a much longer-standing
issue of mismatched shower height
for taller students where we can
accomplish this," said Sustainability
and Utilities Coordinator Nik
Kaestner.
Student I lousing has high hopes
that the plan will quell student dis
content with the showers and show
that comfort and sustainability can
coexist.
