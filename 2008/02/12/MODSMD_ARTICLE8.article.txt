## Vegging Out Despite limited options, meat-free lifestyle thrives on the Farm 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA 
iEy hat do Paul McCartney,
Gandhi, Leonardo da
Wm '7-' Vinci and some Stan
ford students have in
common? They're all
vegetarian or vegan! For a variety of reasons
— including religion, lifestyle choices and an
imal torture — many Stanford students
choose to go veg.
"My body felt better when 1 didn't eat
meat," said Prerna Gupta '04, who chose the
lifestyle for health reasons. "Now, animal
killing and torture is also a major reason why
I would never eat meat again."
Sam Dubai '08 was brought up vegetarian
for religious reasons, but chose to go vegan
after coming to Stanford and learning about
farming practices in America.
"It seemed morally inconsistent with the
values of equality and justice to profit person
ally from the suffering of animals, who I hold
to be as sacred as humans," he said.
Emma Seppala,a graduate student in psychol
ogy. believes humans don't need meat to be
healthy.
"Animals bred for food live in highly stress
ful conditions — they are filled with stress
hormones — and, we are what we eat," she
said. "Any surprise everyone's walking
around anxious and depressed?"
On campus. Animal Rights on the Farm
(ARF) spreads information about the vegan
lifestyle, arranging for speaker events with
professors and investigations into animal ex
periments at Stanford. Currently, students in
volved in the group are working on gathering
signatures for a voter initiative that, if success
ful, will provide greater protection for farm
animals.
"Animals and other species also deserve
moral consideration, which they don't get,and
we try to push people in that direction towards
respecting the moral rights of animals," said
Jack Kamm '09. a member of ARF and a vocal
animal rights advocate.
Many professors at Stanford also believe in
a meat-free lifestyle. Law School Lecturer
Bruce Wagman teaches a class at the Law
School on animal rights and gives various
talks about animal torture practices.

Associate Professor of
Philosophy Chris
Bobonich is also

an advocate.

"I could not find any reason to inflict suf
fering on the animals if all 1 wanted was some
thing yummy," he said.
Bobonich, who has been vegan for over 11
years now, believes that it is difficult to draw a
line between animals that we can and cannot
eat
"If the line is having beliefs. 1 believe that
some animals have beliefs," he said. "We don't
eat people who are in a vegetative state. If the
distinction is that animals cannot do things
such as linear algebra, a lot of human beings
should also be eaten!"
Most students agree that Stanford and its
dining halls are very sensitive to vegetarian
students.There are also vegetarian residences
on campus, including Columbae.
"I feel like there is enough representation
and awareness of vegetarianism on campus
that it is not even an issue for me," said Shila
Soni "07. "I even feel that it is easier being a
vegetarian and being accepted as one at

Stanford than outside of it."

Most dining halls cater to vegan
and vegetarian students by offering a

variety of options. For example.

at Lakeside, the staff prepart
vegan pizza and tofu. All din

ing halls always have salads
rice and beans.

Students appreciate
how receptive the
staff is to their dining
needs.
"I made a point of
talking to my chefs at
the beginning of
each year about
what I would and
wouldn't eat," said
Lauren Schneider
'06, who is currently
vegetarian and
hopes to go back to
being vegan in the
future. "They were
amazingly responsive,
but. obviously, since
they were cooking for 6(

other people, didn't al-

ways remember to prepare
something I could eat."
However, some students

find the vegetarian

options on cam
pus unsatis-

factory.
"The dining halls always try to offer a veg
etarian alternative, but. to be honest, some
times they're really not appetizing,"said Sagar
Doshi '09. "Carrot bits soaked in honey and
toasted peanut butter and jelly is not my idea
of a great vegetarian meal."
To cope with this, some students take to
cooking for themselves or arranging for food
from outside.
The vegan lifestyle can be very time inten
sive — and it's definitely not for everyone.
"In order to ensure I was getting a bal
anced diet. I had to plan out my meals every
night for the next day," Schneider said.
"Morally, I still believe in being vegan, but I
did not feel like I could maintain my health
with that diet at this point in my life."

"I could not find any reason to inflict suf
fering on the animals if all 1 wanted was some
thing yummy," he said.
Bobonich, who has been vegan for over 11
years now, believes that it is difficult to draw a
line between animals that we can and cannot
eat
"If the line is having beliefs. 1 believe that
some animals have beliefs," he said. "We don't
eat people who are in a vegetative state. If the
distinction is that animals cannot do things
such as linear algebra, a lot of human beings
should also be eaten!"
Most students agree that Stanford and its
dining halls are very sensitive to vegetarian
students.There are also vegetarian residences
on campus, including Columbae.
"I feel like there is enough representation
and awareness of vegetarianism on campus
that it is not even an issue for me," said Shila
Soni "07. "I even feel that it is easier being a
vegetarian and being accepted as one at

Stanford than outside of it."

Most dining halls cater to vegan
and vegetarian students by offering a

variety of options. For example.

at Lakeside, the staff prepart
vegan pizza and tofu. All din

ing halls always have salads
rice and beans.

Students appreciate
how receptive the
staff is to their dining
needs.
"I made a point of
talking to my chefs at
the beginning of
each year about
what I would and
wouldn't eat," said
Lauren Schneider
'06, who is currently
vegetarian and
hopes to go back to
being vegan in the
future. "They were
amazingly responsive,
but. obviously, since
they were cooking for 6(

other people, didn't al-

ways remember to prepare
something I could eat."
However, some students

find the vegetarian

options on cam
pus unsatis-

factory.
"The dining halls always try to offer a veg
etarian alternative, but. to be honest, some
times they're really not appetizing,"said Sagar
Doshi '09. "Carrot bits soaked in honey and
toasted peanut butter and jelly is not my idea
of a great vegetarian meal."
To cope with this, some students take to
cooking for themselves or arranging for food
from outside.
The vegan lifestyle can be very time inten
sive — and it's definitely not for everyone.
"In order to ensure I was getting a bal
anced diet. I had to plan out my meals every
night for the next day," Schneider said.
"Morally, I still believe in being vegan, but I
did not feel like I could maintain my health
with that diet at this point in my life."

"There's a wrinkle in
the ointment. Yes, a
fly in the wrinkle!"

iEy hat do Paul McCartney,
Gandhi, Leonardo da
Wm '7-' Vinci and some Stan
ford students have in
common? They're all
vegetarian or vegan! For a variety of reasons
— including religion, lifestyle choices and an
imal torture — many Stanford students
choose to go veg.
"My body felt better when 1 didn't eat
meat," said Prerna Gupta '04, who chose the
lifestyle for health reasons. "Now, animal
killing and torture is also a major reason why
I would never eat meat again."
Sam Dubai '08 was brought up vegetarian
for religious reasons, but chose to go vegan
after coming to Stanford and learning about
farming practices in America.
"It seemed morally inconsistent with the
values of equality and justice to profit person
ally from the suffering of animals, who I hold
to be as sacred as humans," he said.
Emma Seppala,a graduate student in psychol
ogy. believes humans don't need meat to be
healthy.
"Animals bred for food live in highly stress
ful conditions — they are filled with stress
hormones — and, we are what we eat," she
said. "Any surprise everyone's walking
around anxious and depressed?"
On campus. Animal Rights on the Farm
(ARF) spreads information about the vegan
lifestyle, arranging for speaker events with
professors and investigations into animal ex
periments at Stanford. Currently, students in
volved in the group are working on gathering
signatures for a voter initiative that, if success
ful, will provide greater protection for farm
animals.
"Animals and other species also deserve
moral consideration, which they don't get,and
we try to push people in that direction towards
respecting the moral rights of animals," said
Jack Kamm '09. a member of ARF and a vocal
animal rights advocate.
Many professors at Stanford also believe in
a meat-free lifestyle. Law School Lecturer
Bruce Wagman teaches a class at the Law
School on animal rights and gives various
talks about animal torture practices.
