# Hugs, Graffiti apps thanks to Stanford students

### LAURA CHANG STAFF WRITER 
For most Facebook users, the popular online social net
work is a world of revealing wall-to-wall conversations, en
tertaining games and procrastination tools. For application
programmers Alex Onsager '09 and Dan Ackerman-
Greenberg 'OK, Facebook is a window into the soul — or at
least a fascinating glimpse into the way today's Internet
users think.
For both students, the value of a single mouse click ex
tends far beyond a millisecond-long whim. Since the ad
vent of Facebook applications, researchers and aspiring
programmers have discovered the online forum to be an
unexpected treasure trove of psychological data. Behind
every machine, after all, is a thinking and breathing human
user, perhaps a person who prefers red over blue or a busy
student who lacks the patience to read more than 10 lines
of text on a page.
The key, according to Ackerman-Greenberg, is "under
standing how different persuasion strategies can be used in
different contexts to encourage behavior change." By ex
ploiting these psychological principles, programmers can
achieve profoundly predictable results.
For instance, along with co-programmer Joachim De
Ix>mbaert '09, Onsagcr's June 2007 launch of the Graffiti
drawing application initiated his glimpse into the complex
world of human motivation and interaction. Perhaps due
to some fateful cosmic alignment, their application's
launch coincided with an east coast team's unveiling of es
sentially the same concept; two remarkably similar draw
ing applications were released on the very same day.
'Fhe race was on.
"We were mostly concerncd with making a g<x>d. quali

ty product," Onsager explained."The idea was a good one."
However, he continued, "the other one had a lot more in
nund. It gave an incentive for other people to use it."
Whereas his application only allowed users to draw a
picture on the profiles of those who already had the appli

cation, the east coast version incorporated the ability to
send a picture to any user.The recipient then had the oppor
tunity to add the application to their profile. While the mech
anism allowed the east coast subscription rate to surpass that
of De Lombaert and Onsager's program, the two instead
turned their attention to a new venture.
In the fall, De Lombaert and Onsager took an experi
mental course called Creating Engaging Facebook Apps.
taught by B.J. Fogg Ph. D.'97, director of the Persuasive Tech
nology Lab. According to the course Web site, in addition to
teaching students how to create and optimize Facebook ap
plications, the instructors primarily intended to "close the
gap between creator and user."
Onsager's plan was to "start at zero,[and] get a lot of users.
Then later on we could make something cool ...make it super
huge."
Ackerman-Greenberg, the course's head Teaching Assis
tant. fully recognized the value of applying user psychology
to the technological realm. Along with Robert Fan '07 and
graduate student Brett Keintz. he developed the Mugs appli
cation. a simple means through which Facebook users can
offer virtual hugs to friends and loved ones.
"We've gotten 3.5 million people so far to send hugs —
about 50 million hugs," Ackerman-Greenberg said.
"On one hand it's really silly." he said. "but. on the other
hand, [it's] a real emotional connection. It's light and happy
— it lets people flirt with each other.connect with each other
in a fun way. It's a really simple way to say. Iley. I'm thinking
about you."'
Onsager and De Lombaert, too, discovered the value of
simplicity in Facebook applications Departing from their
more complex Graffiti application, the two quickly devel
oped Send I lotness. a program that allows users to compar
atively rank their own and others' attractiveness. In five

weeks, they got

5 million users.

and it became
November's num-

ber one fastest grow-

ing application on
Facebook.

"Send Hotness is al

about spreading virally," Onsager ex
plained." We said to users,'We know how hot you are ranked.
Io see it, invite others to see it.' You could argue it's a virus,
[in that] it spreads from person to person in a way that the
growth is more than linear."
"We meant this as sort of an experiment, to see what's the
minimum we could do to get something to spread crazy," he
continued."Poor quality.TTiat's okay. Now that we know how
to make things spread, we can use it."
Hie trick, according to Onsager, is to "keep things simple,
especially for Facebook ... People's attention is a lot shorter
tin Facebook. Keep things super-accelerated, super-light
weight."
For Ackerman-Greenberg.an understanding of Internet
user motivation and interaction is invaluable for approach
ing a world of increasing virtual social interaction.
"[We're heading] toward the direction where all your
actions will rely on your social network," he said." If you need
to buy a plane ticket, you'll ask your friends for advice first."
As for Facebook's lifespan, he continued, "I give it six
months, one year. It's pretty faddy; [it] sort of feels like an In
ternet bubble."
Come what may. his takeaways from recent experiences will
be sure to come in handy.
