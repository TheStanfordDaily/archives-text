# "It is not true that slavery is a thing of the past in Sudan."
## SIMON DENG, former child slave and activist 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
"You've given me a chance to be
a voice for the voiceless," said Simon
Deng, a survivor of child slavery in
Sudan, to an audience in Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
Deng opened his speech by
describing his enslavement as a
child, which he said is the inspiration
for his current activism.
"At the age of nine. I was abduct
ed from Tonga, my home village, in
southern Sudan." he said. "I will
never forget the day the government
came and invaded my village. ITiat
day, I thought, I'm going to die.'"
Deng was then taken from south
ern Sudan to the northern part of
the country by a slave trader.
"He gave me as a gift to his rela
tives in Kosti," Deng said. "Most of
you talk about gift as something you
have to buy, but you are looking at a
human being who used to be a gift
himself."
When Deng was rescued and
moved to the United States, he kept
silent about his time in slavery for
years, until something he read in The
New York Times inspired him to
speak out and help those experienc
ing what he had years ago.
"In Sudan, you can buy a human
for $10." Deng said, in reference to
the article that he read.
After reading the article, Deng

devoted himself to speaking out
about the human rights violations
occurring in Darfur and the rest of
Sudan.
"It is not true that slavery is a
thing of the past in Sudan," he told
The Daily. "[Sudan is] the only coun
try that has never considered slavery
a crime. [Slavery] is accepted still by
the Arab government in
Khartoum."
Deng now lives in New York City,
hut he returns regularly to Sudan to
contribute to NGO efforts to free
the African slaves considered
"abductees" by the Sudanese gov
ernment.
"1 was in Sudan last month,
involved in liberating 200 human
beings by speaking with local
African and Arab tribes," he told
The Daily before the talk.
While peace agreements
between tribes, which result in the
freeing of African slaves, have been
moro readily granted since Sudan
declared the end of its civil war in
2005, Deng noted that "there are
still 8.000 people enslaved right now.
labeled "abductees' by the Sudanese
government."
In his speech. Deng sharply criti
cized the United Nations for its
insufficient role in stabilizing the
country.
"The UN failed miserably." he
said. "I call it the United 'do noth
ing' Nations. I don't believe in the

UN. 1 believe in you."
Deng closed his remarks to the
audience with an appeal for students
to take action.
"You are the backbones of these
movements." he said. "You especial
ly have the power that you don't
realize in your hands.The action you
took forced the world to realize
what happened in Darfur today. I
am talking to you because you are in
a position to be the voice. The
actions you take today will save one
life tomorrow. Get involved. Be the
voice."
Deng's speech left a powerful
impression on students leaving
Cubberley.
"It's important to hear this from
someone who's actually experienced
the slavery." said Gigi Dascanio '11.
"It's like listening to a Holocaust
survivor."
Other students took the opportu
nity to consider their own activism
in light of his words.
"His speech resonated with me
because he mentioned southern
Sudan as well as Darfur," said
Marloes Sijstermans '11. "He made
me think about how a lot of the
activism that I and other students do
is to send UN troops to Darfur.
Maybe that's not the best way to
go."
