### BETH FOUHY JIM KUHNHENN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
EL PASO,Texas â€” Trying to overcome a string of
losses and a staff shake-up, Hillary Rodham Clinton
sought new energy Tuesday night from a boisterous
crowd of about 12.(XX) in a state she hopes will pro
vide a rebound in her quest for the Democratic pres
idential nomination.
Clinton, whose rallies had been overshadowed by
rival Barack Obama's huge crowds, arrived at the
packed University of Texas at El Paso basketball
arena as voters were giving Obama victories in
Maryland, Virginia and Washington. D.C.
But her sights were set on the March 4 Texas and
Ohio primaries and on President Bush.
"I'm tested, I'm ready, let's make it happen," she
yelled to cheering supporters.
She slipped into a "you all" and criticized Bush,
the former Texas governor.
"There's a great saying in Texas," she said, "all hat
and no cattle. Well after seven years of George Bush,
we need a lot less hat and lot more cattle."
Clinton did not mention Tuesday's results, but
there were lingering signs of the disquiet in her cam

paign.
Her deputy campaign manager resigned Tuesday,
the latest departure in a staff shake-up follows string
of losses to Barack Obama.
In an e-mail message to staffers, Mike Henry said
he was stepping down to allow campaign manager
Maggie Williams to build her own team. Williams
replaced Patti Solis Doyle during the weekend. Solis
Doyle had recruited Henry to join the campaign last
year.
"Out of respect for Maggie and her new leader
ship team, I thought it was the best thing to do,"
Henry wrote. "As someone who has managed cam
paigns, I share the unique understanding of the chal
lenges that the campaign will face over the next sev
eral weeks. Our campaign needs to move quickly to
build a new leadership team, support them and their
decisions and make the necessary adjustments to
achieve the winning outcome for which we have all
worked so hard for over a year now."
It was unclear whether Henry was forced out.
Obama continued to rack up wins Tuesday, beat
ing Clinton by a nearly 2-to-l margin in Virginia and
