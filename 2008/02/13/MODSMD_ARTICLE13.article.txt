## Editorial Board The 						future of the vice presidency 
### 
The United States has never had, and
possibly will never have again, a vice
president as powerful as Dick Cheney.
Perhaps he will only be remembered by po
litical scientists and White House history
buffs, but remembered he will be. Now as
Cheney serves his last year in office, it is time
to analyze the mark he has left on the White
House.
The current Bush administration has re
defined the presidency, and the increase in
the VP's power is arguably the most unique
and most lasting among the many changes
made. The next president may distance him
self or herself from many of the changes
made during the past eight years, in order to
avoid the negative associations of the Bush
administration, but a more potent VP may
actually be useful. Permanently giving a vice
president a more meaningful role in the deci
sion-making process is a valuable modifica
tion to the office of the president.
Historically, the vice president has ar
guably been the most useless constitutional
ly appointed position in the U.S.government.
A useful tool for an election, the VP often
loses influence immediately upon winning
the White House — the VP's most influen
tial days might actually be before Election
Day. Once in office, the VP tends to only
enter the news negatively or comically. Dan
Ouayle's famous "potatoe" moment and Al
Gore's rendition of the Macarena will re
main in American memory forever. It's not
easy to be number two.
Cheney changed all that, however, when
he entered office. From the start, he was a
part of Bush's innermost decision-making
circle, and he will likely remain there until
the end. Unlike a large number of previous
vice presidents, he has never shown an inter
est in acceding to higher office and seems
content with playing his own role.
Of course, there is a limit to the influence
a VP should wield. President Bush may have
allowed Cheney to cross that boundary too
freely, but that does not mean that a new
president should relegate the VP to unim
portant issues after winning the presidency,
as has often been the case throughout Amer
ican history.

Vice presidents are generally deeply
qualified individuals who are good at push
ing a certain agenda. Often, however, their
issues are relegated to the background by
the president and his staff. A stronger VP
may bring some important issues — which
were elected along with the VP by the Amer
ican people — to the forefront. Imagine, for
example, if Al Gore had been able to bring
the national security implications of climate
change to the front of the national debate
early in the 19905. Perhaps Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates would
have prominently debated the issue a
decade ago.
During a campaign, a vice presidential
nominee is rarely chosen because his views
line up directly with that of the presidential
nominee. In fact, the opposite is usually true.
It is more politically strategic to choose a
running mate dissimilar from the presiden
tial nominee in order to capture votes from
different segments of the polity. In 2004, John
Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, hoped
that John Edwards, a senator from North
Carolina, would give his campaign a youth
ful, excited face and help him gain Southern
votes. In 1992 Bill Clinton, an Arkansan,
chose Gore, a Tennessean, as his running
mate to break the Republican stronghold on
the South.
George W. Bush, however, did precisely
the opposite. Not only did he choose a run
ning mate with whom he had a deep person
al connection, but he chose a Washington in
sider who was closely associated with the
Bush family, and in fact had been George
H.W Bush's secretary of defense.This facili
tated Cheney's ability to play a larger role in
the administration.
We cannot predict how the next vice pres
ident will react in Cheney's wake. If the
mood in the next President's White House is
virulently anti-Bush and seeks to do away
with the entire Bush system, then the VP will
be kept on a tight leash. If. however, the next
president comes in looking to take advan
tage of the new VP's strengths, then this
could become a trend. We may actually
begin to have use for a public figure that the
Founding Fathers called upon us to have.
