# Co-terminal Illness
## High Noon at the GSC 
### 
The Daily reported last week that stu
dents waited in line for up to two hours
to cast ballots. Part of the problem, stu
dents now say, was that one of the three vot
ing lines was solely for the Upper Row, which
has just a few hundred occupants. Most stu
dents ended up waiting more than an hour to
vote, while a third, perfectly good voting sta
tion went virtually unused.
This didn't make sense to me,so I called up
the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters
for an explanation. I could not get a straight
answer out of them by press time, but I was
able to speak with Elma Rosas, a spokesper
son for the department. She explained that
the Upper Row might be in a different
precinct and thus have a different ballot.
Of course, that still doesn't explain why
there was only one polling site on campus.
And it doesn't alleviate the annoyance of
those who waited in line for hours, only to see
residents of Durand and 717 jump the queue.
One of the lucky few was Erik Hope '07, a
co-terminal student in classics who is still reg
istered to vote at his old house, SlavDom. He
arrived at the Graduate Student Center
polling station at noon and needed just 12
minutes to cast his ballot. Martin Jankowiak,
a first-year doctoral candidate in theoretical
physics, had been standing in line for about 45
minutes before Hope arrived, and was still
waiting after Hope left.
Frankly, this was a dangerous game for the
county registrar to play. Super Iliesday was
filled with so much raw emotion — honking
cars, picketing undergrade foaming Ron Paul
supporters — that a poorly-run polling sta
tion could have been a recipe for an even
worse voting nightmare.
Since Martin is a student of theoretical
physics, let's imagine another scenario un
folding in a universe no so dissimilar from our
own.
Erik Hope exits GSC and waves goodbye.
Martin, shocked: "How is Hope gone al

ready?"
Obama supporter John Dough turns around
with a wide grin.
John: "No. my friend. I lope is still here!"
Martin: "Nah. Hope just left. I lope's gone."
John's face drops. He is annoyed.
John: "Dude, not cool. Remember: Yes, we
can."
Martin: "Yeah, hut Hope came and went.The
audacity!"
John: "Of hope? What does The Audacity of
Hope have to do with anything?"
Martin: "It's just not fair.The guy has no sense
of justice."
John: "The man worked on the Southside as
a community organizer."
Martin: "Hope was never on the Southside.
He's working at McMaster-Carr next year!"
John: "What? Why arc you even here if you
think he's gonna lose the election and then
leave the Senate to work at an industrial parts
supplier?" John offers a soft smile. Look
around, brother. I lope is here."
Martin, through gritted teeth: "I don't know
who you are talking about, but there is no
Hope here."
Obama partisans begin to gather around the
pair. The crowd begins to murmur; "Yes, we
can."
