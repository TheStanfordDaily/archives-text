# America is for Americans

Tolerance is a sham. It's what minorities
cry out for when they can't understand
why everyone else won't accept them.
But the tolerance they want can never exist.
People from different cultures will always ex
perience friction when they rub up against
each other. If I am used to receiving a certain
response when I act in a certain way. I will he
unsettled when 1 receive an off-script re
sponse from someone who grew up in a dif
ferent setting.
For instance, when I forgot to take off my
shoes in an Asian household. I got a dirty
look.That made me feel terrible and less like
ly to visit in the future.
You might say that 1 could be more sensi
tive and adjust myself to whom I am talking.
But that adds a level of guardedness to every
interaction. I not only need to educate myself
about every culture I am likely to meet; I also
have to be aware of every person's culture.
That would be quite an effort. And from my
point of view, it's much easier to just avoid
people from other backgrounds (and occa
sionally make fun of them behind their backs).
I'm told that immigrants find it very diffi
cult to blend into the majority of American
society while maintaining their native cul
ture. They have to present one face to whites,
and another to those of their native culture.
As someone of South Asian descent, this

has never been a problem for me, and it
shouldn't be for anyone else. I made a con
scious effort to abandon my native culture
and become a thoroughly assimilated sec
ond-generation immigrant. I so self-identify
with whites that whenever another minority
starts castigating white, male privilege, I get
angry over how they're insulting me. And I
can't help looking at the immigration debate
through a white-guy lens.
And when I use that lens, I get tired of
people who attribute fear of immigration to
racism. Those people say that immigrants
add to America's patchwork quilt and that
they will revitalize our culture.
But when they say that, what they really
mean is,"We're here. More are coming. Deal
with it." 1 was born here. I grew up here. I am
comfortable here. I know how things work.
And I don't see why it this culture needs to be
added to or revitalized.

Native-born Americans make all the com
promises. We open up our country. We give
jobs and human rights to the poor, huddled
masses. Then they have the gall to come here
and make us feel awkward in our home.
When they insist that we should be more tol
erant, it turns our discomfort into a moral
failing. And that makes us dislike them for
making us feel like terrible people.
This discomfort is not racism. It is the
same alienation I feel when 1 visit India,
where people stare at me and whisper about
the ferungi (foreigner.) It applied to Swedes
in the early 18th century, Irish in the mid 18th
century, and eastern Europeans in the early
20th century. It is the same feeling that East
erners get when they visit Montana, or evan
gelicals get when they talk to atheists. It is
natural and it is unavoidable.
There are only two solutions to the prob
lems caused by a multicultural society: self
segregation, in which you stay with your own
kind, or abandoning that cultural baggage in
favor of assimilation. All I can say is the sort
of ease I have in navigating American socie
ty is a tremendous boon.
I'm not merelv tolerated. I am at home.
