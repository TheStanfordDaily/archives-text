Response to CDC Web site critique
To the Editor:
In the February 8 editorial ("Revamp the
CDC Web site"). The Daily offered several
suggestions about improving our online ca
reer site. Cardinal Careers. 1 lere are some of
my thoughts regarding the suggestions.
The basic search function does allow stu
dents to search by position type, job function
and industry. Try using the keyword filter to
find opportunities by company name or by
city. Simply enter "Boston" or "San Francis
co" to find jobs in the cities you would like to
work. In the Advanced Search function, you
can search by zip codes and number of miles

from that zip code.
Additionally, on the top bar of your ac
count page, you can search for employers
who have posted positions, attended a career
fair or participated in Cardinal Recruiting
over the past couple of years. Companies are
listed in alphabetical order and can be
searched by industry or keyword. Students
can research companies, find contact infor
mation and reach out directly to inquire
about jobs that might not as yet be posted on
Cardinal Careers.
Many students want to just focus on the
Cardinal Recruiting Interviews because of
the deadlines involved, and so there is an op
tion to narrow searches to these interviews.

As for the traveling criteria, we do have the
ability to eliminate it or reduce the incre
ments.
In regards to Symplicity. the vendor who
supports the system, their work is excellent
and they are truly responsive to the needs of
clients. I have worked with a series of vendors
over the past 20 years, and I would have to
say that they [Symplicity] are truly excep
tional. In fact, they called me about the Feb
ruary 8 editorial before I had a chance to
read The Daily. That's how concerned they
are about the service they offer.
