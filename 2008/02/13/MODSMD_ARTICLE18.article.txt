## CARD BRACES FOR BEARS No. 4 Baylor visits the Farm to take on No. 40 Stanford 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 40 Stanford men's tennis team re
turns to action today against No. 4 Baylor in
the second annual HP Cup. I"he Cardinal is
coming off two straight 7-0 victories last week
and looks to continue rolling.
Baylor is 6-0 this season and has defeated
three ranked teams — last time out the Bears
beat No. 13 Florida, 5-2. They are led by 10th
ranked Denes Lukacs, who is 26-5 this year in
singles play and 9-5 in doubles. David Galic is
ranked No. 80 in the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation rankings, and is undefeated in dou
bles play this season with partner Jordan Rux.
Baylor's No. 1 player, Lars Poerschke, is 9-1
overall this year in singles. Four players for Bay
lor are undefeated in dual matches this year.
Freshman Alex Clayton, ranked No. 2 in the
nation, leads the Cardinal with a 15-3 record.
Clayton is 6-1 in dual matches. In doubles,
sophomore Richard Wire and freshman Greg
1 lirshman lead the team with an K-3 record, in
cluding a 4-1 record in dual matches.
"[Wire] complements my game very well, as
he has a lot of power and spin, and 1 have a lot
of feel and control." said 1 lirshman. "Our key
to success has been our ability to work togeth
er and win the big points. It also adds to our
team that he is left handed and I am right hand
ed, so we automatically get spin and shot vari
ation that not many teams get."
The Cardinal has actually seen much of the
Bears' squad this season. In the Sherwood Cup
in January, Stanford played a number of
matches against Baylor opponents in both sin
gles and doubles. Baylor had a singles record of
K-2 against Stanford that weekend. In doubles,
Stanford's led Kelly and Blake Muller lost in
the finals of the tournament to the combo of
Lukacs and Atilla Bucko. Needless to say, the
Cardinal knows the Bears well and is eager to

turn the tables.
"This is another great rivalry we have." said
head coach John Whitlinger. "They are a very
solid team top to bottom.Their coach has done
a great job with their team."
Today's home match will be crucial for
Stanford, who is an even 2-2 at Taube this sea
son. The players are comfortable on their own
court, and it is especially favorable for less-ex
perienced freshmen like Clayton.
"Playing at home is great," he said. "It is fun
and it has helped us play some good tennis. We
have a great shot against Baylor playing at
home."
As if the Cardinal needed further motiva
tion. Stanford has never beaten Baylor in a
dual match — the team is 0-7 against the Bears
all time.The most prominent, recent defeat was
a hard 4-3 loss in the 2(X)6 NCAA Quarterfi
nals, where a furious comeback by the Bears
sent Stanford packing. It was one of the longest
and tightest matches the NCAA tournament
has ever seen.
"It will be a real test for us,"said Whitlinger.
"It will be a tough match, no question. We are
looking forward to the challenge."
Play begins at I:30 p.m. at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
