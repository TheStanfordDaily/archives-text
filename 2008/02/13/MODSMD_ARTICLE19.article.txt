## Cardinal qualify for U.S. National Team 
### JACOB JOHNSON 
Witli only months remaining before the
2(X)8 Summer Olympics in Beijing, athletes
from all over the world are hard at work per
fecting their skills. Nowhere is this more evi
dent than in the world of men's gymnastics. At
last weekend's Winter Cup in Las Vegas, Nev., a
qualifying meet for the US Senior National
Team, the best gymnasts in the U.S. — includ
ing a number of Stanford gymnasts — showed
that they are ready to rise to the challenge.
To Stanford head coach Thorn Glielmi, it
comes as no surprise.

"In any Olympic year the competition gets di
aled up," he said. "But the extra pressure and
tough competition didn't seem to bother two of
the Cardinal's top gymnasts — senior David
Sender and junior Sho Nakamori both re
claimed their spots on the Senior National
Team with solid performances over the week
end.
For Sender, that's what it's all about.
"The challenge is what keeps you going,"
said the two-time NCAA vault champion. "It's
going to be an exciting year for both Stanford
gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Team."
The Cardinal sent nine gymnasts to the Win

ter Cup. Hopes were high for a group including
freshmen Alex Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim
Gentry, and Ryan Lieberman.as well as upper
classmen Bryant Hadden, F:li Alcaraz, Dylan
Carney, Nakamori and Sender.
I lowever. the meet did not start off well for
the Cardinal. Even with solid performances
from Gentry and Lieberman, the team had
trouble finding any rhythm.
"The guys were flat," Glielmi said.
Nakamori, already a National Team mem
ber after being named to the 2007 World Cham
pionship team, fought cramps throughout the
weekend.

"[The meet] didn't start off too well because
my legs cramped up during warm-ups and I
ended up doing a terrible vault," said
Nakamori.
After scratching his floor exercise in pre
lims. Nakamori came back strong in the finals
on Saturday.
"My legs felt a lot better so I was able to
compete in the all-around [competition] but ..
. it still didn't feel KM) percent."
Sender, usually one of Stanford's most reli
able competitors, was a little off during prelims.
