## Cardinal qualify for U.S. National Team 
### JACOB JOHNSON 
Witli only months remaining before the
2(X)8 Summer Olympics in Beijing, athletes
from all over the world are hard at work per
fecting their skills. Nowhere is this more evi
dent than in the world of men's gymnastics. At
last weekend's Winter Cup in Las Vegas, Nev., a
qualifying meet for the US Senior National
Team, the best gymnasts in the U.S. — includ
ing a number of Stanford gymnasts — showed
that they are ready to rise to the challenge.
To Stanford head coach Thorn Glielmi, it
comes as no surprise.

"In any Olympic year the competition gets di
aled up," he said. "But the extra pressure and
tough competition didn't seem to bother two of
the Cardinal's top gymnasts — senior David
Sender and junior Sho Nakamori both re
claimed their spots on the Senior National
Team with solid performances over the week
end.
For Sender, that's what it's all about.
"The challenge is what keeps you going,"
said the two-time NCAA vault champion. "It's
going to be an exciting year for both Stanford
gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Team."
The Cardinal sent nine gymnasts to the Win

ter Cup. Hopes were high for a group including
freshmen Alex Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim
Gentry, and Ryan Lieberman.as well as upper
classmen Bryant Hadden, F:li Alcaraz, Dylan
Carney, Nakamori and Sender.
I lowever. the meet did not start off well for
the Cardinal. Even with solid performances
from Gentry and Lieberman, the team had
trouble finding any rhythm.
"The guys were flat," Glielmi said.
Nakamori, already a National Team mem
ber after being named to the 2007 World Cham
pionship team, fought cramps throughout the
weekend.

"[The meet] didn't start off too well because
my legs cramped up during warm-ups and I
ended up doing a terrible vault," said
Nakamori.
After scratching his floor exercise in pre
lims. Nakamori came back strong in the finals
on Saturday.
"My legs felt a lot better so I was able to
compete in the all-around [competition] but ..
. it still didn't feel KM) percent."
Sender, usually one of Stanford's most reli
able competitors, was a little off during prelims.
falling on the pommel horse and
vault.
Despite the early struggles, seven
of the nine Stanford athletes ad
vanced to day two.
Glielmi, though disappointed with
the team's performance in prelims,
knew that his athletes were in good
position to finish strong in the finals:

"If compared to the rest of the field
I'd have to say we did well, but not ex
actly what we have been training.''
A refocused team showed up to
the finals on Saturday.
"It was obvious from the start the
guys were comfortable, ready to go,"
said Gliemi."[They) wanted redemp
tion for their spotty performance on
Thursday."
Stanford's finalists performed well
on each apparatus, with particularly
high scores on floor exercise anil
pommel horse.
Having so many teammates com

peting alongside one another was a
big factor in the Cardinal's success.
"This was an individual meet," said
Nakamori, "but since so many of us
qualified through to the final day of
competition, it felt like a team meet..
. the seven of us that qualified
through took up one whole rotation."
Sender performed great routines
on floor exercise and parallel bars
and entered the final day of competi
tion in fourth place in the all-around.
He held his standing and solidified his
National Team spot.
But neither he nor Nakamori is

celebrating — they are back training
with their teammates this week,
preparing for Stanford's dual meet
with Nebraska on Saturday. Right
now, the focus has shifted back to
preparing for the NCAA Champi
onships in April.
Stanford next returns to action
when it hosts the Cornhuskers this
Saturday at Burnham Pavilion. Com
