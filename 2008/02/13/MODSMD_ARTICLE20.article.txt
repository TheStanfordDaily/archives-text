# A
						fix to lopsided trades?
## 
### 
And so we've reached that
dreaded hour in every sports
year: February. Too soon to
talk March Madness but too late to
reminisce about a truly fabulous Super
Bowl that saved us from months of
endless talk about the supposedly all
time greatness of the Patriots. So
what's a columnist to do in this most
dreaded of months?
Luckily, sometimes material pres
ents itself.
After the Los Angeles Lakers'
stunning trade of Kwame Brown for
Pau Gasol. an eyebrow has finally
been officially raised regarding the
perceived lopsidedness of the deal in
the Lakers' favor. Yes, some draft picks
and extra pieces went Memphis' way
in that deal, but for now, it's basically
Brown for Gasol, period. And San An
tonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
isn't buying that it was fair, for one
minute.
"What they did in Memphis is be
yond comprehension," Popovich was
quoted by Sl.com. "There should be a
trade committee that can scratch all
trades that make no sense. I just wish I
had been on a trade committee that
oversees NBA trades. 1 would have
voted no to that LA trade."
Like I said, sometimes it presents it
self. Thank you, Mr. Popovich â€” I
mean, it's like he knew that we needed
something to talk about.
First, let's just consider for a minute
that Popovich's claim could be more
than iyst jealousy and fear that anoth
er power has suddenly arisen in the
Western Conference to compete with
his Spurs. That's hard to do, of course,
because a Lakers squad led by Kobe
Bryant, Gasol, a healthy Andrew
Bynum and Lamar Odom makes for a
truly dangerous team. Indeed, the Lak
ers, once again, are in serous con
tention for a title, and with their new
young core, could be for some time.
But as good as the trade was for the
Lakers, it's hard to look at it from the
perspective of the Memphis Grizzlies
and think that it was the best they
could do for a player of Gasol's caliber.
And in a vacuum, maybe you think,
"Okay, dumb trade, but so what?
Those have happened before and will
happen again." But it didn't happen in
a vacuum, it happened between a pair
of teams linked in that they both share
a former General Manager, Jerry
West. Just like the momentous trade of
the offseason which sent Kevin Gar
nett to the Boston Celtics was proba
bly facilitated by the presence of Kevin
McHale in the GM seat for the Tim
