# A 						fix to lopsided trades?
## 
### 
And so we've reached that
dreaded hour in every sports
year: February. Too soon to
talk March Madness but too late to
reminisce about a truly fabulous Super
Bowl that saved us from months of
endless talk about the supposedly all
time greatness of the Patriots. So
what's a columnist to do in this most
dreaded of months?
Luckily, sometimes material pres
ents itself.
After the Los Angeles Lakers'
stunning trade of Kwame Brown for
Pau Gasol. an eyebrow has finally
been officially raised regarding the
perceived lopsidedness of the deal in
the Lakers' favor. Yes, some draft picks
and extra pieces went Memphis' way
in that deal, but for now, it's basically
Brown for Gasol, period. And San An
tonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
isn't buying that it was fair, for one
minute.
"What they did in Memphis is be
yond comprehension," Popovich was
quoted by Sl.com. "There should be a
trade committee that can scratch all
trades that make no sense. I just wish I
had been on a trade committee that
oversees NBA trades. 1 would have
voted no to that LA trade."
Like I said, sometimes it presents it
self. Thank you, Mr. Popovich — I
mean, it's like he knew that we needed
something to talk about.
First, let's just consider for a minute
that Popovich's claim could be more
than iyst jealousy and fear that anoth
er power has suddenly arisen in the
Western Conference to compete with
his Spurs. That's hard to do, of course,
because a Lakers squad led by Kobe
Bryant, Gasol, a healthy Andrew
Bynum and Lamar Odom makes for a
truly dangerous team. Indeed, the Lak
ers, once again, are in serous con
tention for a title, and with their new
young core, could be for some time.
But as good as the trade was for the
Lakers, it's hard to look at it from the
perspective of the Memphis Grizzlies
and think that it was the best they
could do for a player of Gasol's caliber.
And in a vacuum, maybe you think,
"Okay, dumb trade, but so what?
Those have happened before and will
happen again." But it didn't happen in
a vacuum, it happened between a pair
of teams linked in that they both share
a former General Manager, Jerry
West. Just like the momentous trade of
the offseason which sent Kevin Gar
nett to the Boston Celtics was proba
bly facilitated by the presence of Kevin
McHale in the GM seat for the Tim


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
berwolves — who may have been try
ing to help his old team — the motives
behind this trade can be traced to the
former Lakers general manager.
The point isn't that something def
initely nefarious occurred in either of
these cases — it's that there's really
no way to prove it didn't. It seemed
the Timberwolves and Grizzlies
should both have been able to get
more in return for their respective su
perstars, but we don't know if there
were actually better offers on the
table. In that sense, maybe Popovich is
right. A forum in which all trade pro
posals were made public and review
able by the league could prevent the
sense that something is rotten in Den
mark... or Minnesota or Memphis, as
the case may be.
But perhaps most importantly,
such a forum for coaches and league
executives to complain about trades
they don't like would be an endless
source of amusement to us, the fans of
the NBA. Consider the entertainment
factor of a coach like Popovich trying
to explain why, exactly, he's so against
the Gasol trade. That is a discussion
which, if he's honest, would start and
end with the fact that Gasol seriously
jeopardizes his team's chances of re
peating as NBA champions.
But, long story short, it's not going
to happen. Why? Because while the
NFL may have earned its well de
served moniker of the "No Fun
League," the NBA isn't too far be
hind. And while it would be great for
the fans of every team to have a more
transparent view of the trade discus
sions that currently go on behind the
scenes, anything that makes his league
look more like the joke it sometimes
can be (hello Suns-Spurs playoff se
ries of 2007!) will never be okayed by
the incredibly image-over-substance
David Stern.
So sorry, Pop, it looks like Gasol is
real, and so are the Lakers. Even
though it would be a whole lot more
interesting if we knew what really
happened.

Denis Griffin is a senior who would be
in favor of any incredibly impractical
sports reform to make sports in Febru
ary a bit more interesting. Got any
ideas? Let him know at djgriff@stan
