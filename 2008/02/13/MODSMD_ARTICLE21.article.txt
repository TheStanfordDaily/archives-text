## Ancient game finds new life 
### JENNIFER LEVY 
The overcast skies and drizzling
- rains, redolent of Ireland's wet cli
mate. seemed appropriate as Stan
ford's unofficial hurling team took to
the Oval last Saturday.
The team's latest training session
was the fourth led by Paul Bayley and
Eamonn Gormley of the Gaelic Ath
letic Association (GAA). Over the
- past few months, the pair has organ
ized scrimmages, led drills and taught
this novice group of Stanford hurlers
the rules of the ancient Irish game.
Hurling is a field sport played with
a wooden stick called a hurley and
small leather ball called a sliothar.The
object is to score points by getting the
sliothar into the net or between the
goal posts of the opposing team. Play
ers can use either their hands or hur
leys, which Tiave large, flat ends that
allow players to balance the sliothar
on their sticks or hit the ball out of the
air. I lurlers can also catch the ball, but
they can walk only three steps while

holding it. They also cannot pick the
ball up off of the ground; instead, they
must scoop it up with the hurley and
catch it.
Hurling practice started fall quar
ter. when Gormley, a member of the
North American Board of the GAA,
was contacted by Sam Svoboda '11, a
contributing writer for The Daily, who
was looking for some outside support
to start a team at Stanford. In addition
to training, the GAA has provided the
team with 10 new and five used hur
leys and several sliothars to use during
their weekly practice.
Gormley said he was eager to sup

cause generating interest in the sport
on college campuses is a great way to
spread "real Irish culture," which is too
often negatively associated with
drinking.
"Our sports are a more positive
representation of our culture," he said.
He added that the fast pace of hurl
ing would appeal to college students
because it makes the sport such an ex
citing game to play and watch.
"It's one of the fastest-moving
games," he said. "For that reason it is

much better than soccer or American
football."
It was not the first time Gormley
had been contacted by a Stanford stu
dent about starting a hurling team.
Two years ago, John Mulrow '08 en
listed his help to organize a team. Ac
cording to Gormley, quite a number
of players came out for the team, but
interest died when Mulrow left cam
pus to spend a year abroad in Zambia.
After hearing about Mulrow's ef
forts, Svoboda decided to resurrect
Stanford's hurling team this year.
Svoboda s interest in the sport had
been stimulated during a trip to Ire
land in which he saw the national
championship of hurling on television.
"It was a really intense, exciting
match," he recalled.
His first opportunity to try the
game out for himself was at an Irish
fair in Minnesota. He enjoyed the
game so much, he asked for a hurley
for Christmas.
But besides playing with his broth
er in his yard, Svoboda had never had
the chance to participate in a real
game of hurling.
"1 tried to get in touch with some of

the teams in my hometown of Chica
go, hut I got no response," he said.
Organizing a hurling team at Stan
ford seemed like the perfect opportu
nity to he able to play the sport with
other people.
"It was also nice because I knew
everyone would be a beginner. We
would all be on the same level," Svo
boda said.
Although creating a team on a
campus with few experienced hurlers
might have its advantages, it can also
be quite frustrating at times. While
there are 15 people on a hurling team,
Stanford's team has only six dedicat
ed members, according to Svoboda.
Mulrow. who has returned to the
Farm, recently joined.
In addition. Svoboda is struggling
to attain club status for the hurling
team so that they can receive funding
from the ASSU. Although he filed the
paperwork to become an official or
ganization months ago. he has yet to
hear from them about the status of his
application.
Nevertheless, Stanford's hurling
team has come a long way.
"Although the team has not been
playing for very long, they are already
mastering the basic skills,"said Gorm
ley.
"It's a very easy game to pick up."
said Svoboda.
Gormley and Svoboda said they
hope Stanford's team will soon be
able to compete against other colleges
in the area.
When asked aboAut his long-term
goals for the team, Svoboda said he is
just hoping for enough members to
sustain long-term stability.
"Maybe then we can start thinking
about an NCAA championship for
hurling," he added.
