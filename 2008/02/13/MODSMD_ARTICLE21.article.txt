## Ancient game finds new life 
### JENNIFER LEVY 
The overcast skies and drizzling
- rains, redolent of Ireland's wet cli
mate. seemed appropriate as Stan
ford's unofficial hurling team took to
the Oval last Saturday.
The team's latest training session
was the fourth led by Paul Bayley and
Eamonn Gormley of the Gaelic Ath
letic Association (GAA). Over the
- past few months, the pair has organ
ized scrimmages, led drills and taught
this novice group of Stanford hurlers
the rules of the ancient Irish game.
Hurling is a field sport played with
a wooden stick called a hurley and
small leather ball called a sliothar.The
object is to score points by getting the
sliothar into the net or between the
goal posts of the opposing team. Play
ers can use either their hands or hur
leys, which Tiave large, flat ends that
allow players to balance the sliothar
on their sticks or hit the ball out of the
air. I lurlers can also catch the ball, but
they can walk only three steps while

holding it. They also cannot pick the
ball up off of the ground; instead, they
must scoop it up with the hurley and
catch it.
Hurling practice started fall quar
ter. when Gormley, a member of the
North American Board of the GAA,
was contacted by Sam Svoboda '11, a
contributing writer for The Daily, who
was looking for some outside support
to start a team at Stanford. In addition
to training, the GAA has provided the
team with 10 new and five used hur
leys and several sliothars to use during
their weekly practice.
Gormley said he was eager to sup

port a hurling team at Stanford be
cause generating interest in the sport
on college campuses is a great way to
spread "real Irish culture," which is too
often negatively associated with
drinking.
"Our sports are a more positive
representation of our culture," he said.
He added that the fast pace of hurl
ing would appeal to college students
because it makes the sport such an ex
citing game to play and watch.
"It's one of the fastest-moving
games," he said. "For that reason it is
