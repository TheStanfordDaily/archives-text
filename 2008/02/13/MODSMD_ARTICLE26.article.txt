## Students sleep in White Plaza Slumber party raises awareness about sleep 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bikers had a new obstacle in
White Plaza yesterday afternoon:
beds.
Ihe beds were part of an outreach
project for Psychiatry Prof. William
Dements "Sleep and Dreams" class.
While other students' projects includ
ed videos, brochures and community
mentoring, Bianca Ceralvo '08, along
with Georgia Duan "07 and Yung-Yee
Chen "08. decided to organize a large
scale napping session to educate their
peers about sleep disorders and dep
rivation.
"It's a better way of getting the
word out to students," Duan said.
"They're coming from class to their
dorms and perhaps might not have
time to take naps."
Ceralvo provided the beds, a
sleeping bag and several posters pro
claiming the event a "slumber party."
Clutching a teddy bear, she also
yelled Dement's motto, "Drowsiness
is red alert!" to passersby.
Hie slumber party, which took
place from 2 to 4 p.m., also featured
singers from Stanford's Department
of Music, who sang lullabies like
"Hush Little Baby," "Twinkle
Twinkle Little Star" and "Frere

Jacques."
The trio spread the word about
their project by sending e-flyers,
posting flyers in various locations
around campus and creating a
Facebook event. Despite these
efforts, only a handful of people
showed up. Some stopped by in
between classes to rest, though most
paused to ask questions.
White Plaza was too noisv vester

day for some of the participants. In
fact, one student complained of not
being able to sleep, so Duan pulled
out her song sheet and serenaded
her with "Hush Little Baby."
As Ceralvo explained, the after
noon is a prime time for most people
to take a nap. She said a person's
clock-dependent alerting decreases
in the middle of the day, meaning the
body does not respond to stimuli or

maintain a level of wakeful alertness.
"At the onset of sleep, people
temporarily go blind and deaf."
Ceralvo said. "Most people, if they
have a high sleep debt, have no prob
lem tuning things out."
Duan said that it was important
for students to take naps during the
day in order to reduce the sleep debt
thai can accumulate.
Ceralvo said that inspiration for

the outdoor project came from a
humorous picture.
"I saw a picture a few years ago of
a dorm room in the middle of a high
way," she said. "There were a couple of
desks, a couple of beds — completely
furnished — in the middle of the high
way. 1 thought it was hilarious."
