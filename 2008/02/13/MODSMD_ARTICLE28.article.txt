## Three primaries give Obama delegate lead 
### DAVID ESPO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€” Barack
Obama powered past Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the race for
Democratic convention dele
gates Tuesday on a night of tri
umph sweetened with outsized
primary victories in Maryland,
Virginia and the District of
Columbia.
"Tonight we're on our way,"
Obama told cheering supporters
in Madison, Wis. "But we know
how much further we have to go,"
he added, celebrating eight
straight victories over Clinton,
the former first lady now strug
gling in a race she once com
manded.
The Associated Press count of
delegates showed Obama with
1,210. Clinton had 1,188, falling
behind for the first time since the
campaign began. Neither was
close to the 2,025 needed to win
the nomination.
His victories were by large
margins - he was gaining about 75
percent of the vote in the nation's
capital and nearly two-thirds in
Virginia. In Maryland, he was
winning close to 60 percent.

By contrast. Clinton was
attempting to retool her cam
paign in the midst of a losing
streak. Her deputy campaign
manager resigned, the second
high-level departure in as many
days.
Campaigning in Texas, where
she hopes to triumph on March 4,
she said she was looking ahead,
not back.
"I'm tested, I'm ready. Now
let's make it happen," she said.
Republican front-runner John
McCain won all three GOP pri
maries, adding to his insurmount
able lead in delegates for the
Republican nomination. He con
gratulated Mike Huckabee, his
sole remaining major rival and a
potential vice presidential run
ning mate, then turned his focus
on the Democrats.
"We know where either of
their candidates will lead this
country, and we dare not let
them," he told supporters in
Alexandria, Va. "They will paint a
picture of the world in which
America's mistakes are a greater
threat to our security than the
malevolent intentions of an
enemy that despises us and our
ideals."
