The ASSU Undergraduate Senate sent Hoover
Institution Distinguished Visiting Fellow Donald Rumsfeld
an invitation on Saturday, asking him to speak at a cam
puswide forum and giving the former Secretary of Defense
30 days to respond.
The invitation, the product of a bill passed by the
Undergraduate Senate on Jan. 23. was the culmination of a
movement in the works since the Hoover Institution
announced Rumsfeld's appointment in September. After a
bill expressing opposition to the appointment failed in
November, the Senate has struggled to find an acceptable
way to weigh in on the matter, a process that has frustrated
some student activists.
"We got a lot of people to show up in support of the
bill," recalled Adam Hudson '10, a leader of Stanford Says
No. an anti-war student group opposed to the Rumsfeld
appointment. "All of us were very disappointed."
After five weeks of deliberation, that bill fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to pass the resolution in an 8-5
vote with two senators abstaining. Many senators at the
time questioned whether the Undergraduate Senate was
the appropriate venue to express opposition to Rumsfeld, a
position that drew the ire of activists like Hudson.
"If not the ASSU, how else?" Hudson asked. "We elect
ed them to do something, not just sit there.They should rep
resent our voice."
Over 4,300 students, faculty, staff and alumni signed an
online petition objecting to the appointment.
For senators seeking to speak out on the Rumsfeld
issue, it was back to square one. The second bill, passed in
January, was an effort by the Senate to finally make its mark
on the Rumsfeld debate, and assuage the student activists
who had vigorously lobbied for the previous resolution.
"I think that when the first bill didn't pass, it gave the
impression that the ASSU does not support political
activism." said Senator Sarah Golabek-Goldman '10,
author of the bill. "If we can't make a stand, we wanted to
show our support, and wanted to make a tangible impact
on this issue."
The bill passed 14-1.
If Rumsfeld fails to respond by Mar. 10. the given dead
line, Golabek-Goldman said yesterday the Senate would
consider other guests for the forum, including Hoover
Director John Raisian. Such a format would likely mimic
Raisian's appearance before the Faculty Senate on Nov. 9,
in which he steadfastly defended the appointment, while
admitting some tactical errors.
"This experience is unexpected, as naive as that sounds."
Raisian said at the time, referring to the controversy brew-
