### ROXIE DICKINSON 
A member of the Stanford golf
team is one of four
golfers ever
— includ
ing Tiger
Woods —to capture
eight American Junior
Golf Association titles. He is also the first
U.S. Junior Champion to enroll at
Stanford on a golf scholarship since
Tiger Woods in the mid 19905.
Though he is young, the freshman
tied for first individually at the
CordeValle Collegiate Invitational in
November and was runner-up last week
along with senior captain Rob Grube in
the Cardinal's first team victory of the
season. This long list of accomplish
ments may only be the tip of the iceberg
for freshman Sihwan Kim, however.
Kim was born in Seoul, South Korea

and came
to the United
States with his family in mid
dle school. He learned English upon
arrival and experienced a much differ
ent recruiting process than most
Stanford golfers, according to head
coach Conrad Ray.
"Sihwan drove the rental car, handled
the map and made the reservations when
he first met with me before enrolling in
Stanford." Ray said. "I usually speak exten
sively with the parents of recruits in the
beginning, but Sihwan's parents only
know a limited amount of English.
Sihwan was the liaison most times
between us though his parents were
very supportive.
"He and I were forced to speak more
extensively about his arrangements at
Stanford, which helped us to develop a

good relationship early on," Conrad
continued. "I first thought that if this
guy can handle all of these details on
his own without his parents, Stanford
should definitely be doable."
Though Kim has a significant
amount of achievement under his
belt, he is a modest guy who lives the
life of a regular Stanford freshman.
"1 do all the loading and unloading
... freshman stuff," Kim said. "Coach
[ Ray] likes to make 'typical freshman'
jokes if I mess up during practice or
on the road. Because I have been
playing well this spring, I feel like 1
have connected with my teammates a
little better."
Due to Kim's successful history
with golf, he has many pressures to
live up to in addition to the normal
pressure of weekly collegiate tourna
ments with his team. In high school,
his advancement in the sport rested
entirely on his own shoulders, which
contrasts with the college golf team
mentality.
"Everything about college is team
based," Kim said. "Even if I play well,
I enjoy team victories more than an
individual win. Pressure makes the
game more exciting and my level of
concentration increases, so I play bet
ter. Golf gets boring when the pres
sure is off. Since I have been playing
since I was nine. 1 figure that I have
probably already experienced each
situation once. So if I have done it be
fore, I can do it again."
"I le's a little shy but he's definite

ly a team guy," Ray said. "It is neat to
see the way he values the team out
come which is helpful with the group
that we have. He is the kind of golfer
that brings the guys together. He has a
really good sense of humor that keeps
it light for all the guys. We have a good
time. The ongoing joke is that I like to
call him Ralph."
Whatever Ray calls him, Kim has
only been excelling since he arrived at
the Farm. He holds the lowest stroke
average of the team at 70.7, has played
in every event and boasts three top
three individual finishes. His pre
tournament ritual helps him to focus
before hitting the course.
"I'm Catholic so 1 like to draw my
cross before tournaments." Kim said.
"I'm not superstitious — my parents
tell me that I should do this because I
represent Catholics on the course. It's
pretty fascinating that my first indi
vidual win came so quickly. I'm glad
that we won last week because it gives
us the opportunity to build on that
momentum throughout the year. It
was a great start to the spring season."
Kim has worked hard to make

"Everything about college is team based. I enjoy
team victories more than an individual win."

Sihwan Kim, freshman

himself into the great golfer that he is
today, but he still has not hit the "hole
in one" of his career, as he has high
goals for the future. Since he is a fresh
man, Ray and the program look for
ward to big things from him during his
next three years on the Farm.
"He is a first-class kid from top to
bottom." Ray said. "He is very per
sonable. 1 give him a lot of credit for
getting himself to the place he is in
which is quite an accomplishment.
He is mature and works hard. The
thing I like about Sihwan is that he
understands that he needs to contin
ue to improve despite his previous
successes. He has all the makings to
be one of Stanford's all-time great
players."
"I really want to win the NCAA
tournament, both as a team and indi
vidually." Kim said. "We have a good
enough team to win it and if I practice
hard enough and get good enough, I
think I can win the individual [tourna
ment | too."
