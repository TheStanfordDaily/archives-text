# Basque debate continues
## Second petition surfaces in support of President Ibarretxe's arrival 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In anticipation of Thursday's visit
by the Basque Government presi
dent, a maelstrom of international
controversy has surfaced. Stanford's
plans to host Juan Jose Ibarretxe has
garnered coverage from both U.S. and
Spanish media outlets, including the
two largest Spanish national newspa
pers, EI Pais and El Mundo.
A petition protesting Ibarretxe's
talk had garnered over S.(XX) signa
tures as of Tuesday. However, within
the last two weeks, another petition
has emerged in support of the lecture.
It has since received over 3.000 signa
tures.
The second petition calls on
Stanford "to disregard the petitions of
groups that pretend to obstruct free
dom of speech." It further argues that
"everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regard
less of frontiers."
lire democratically elected presi
dent's visit has led to deep divisions
over whether the leader should be

allowed to speak on campus in the
current format.
Rafael Dobado Gonzalez, a pro
fessor of history and economic institu
tions at the Universidad Complutense
in Madrid who signed the first peti
tion. said he wishes that the audience
could he offered a contrasting per
spective to Ibarretxes. He believes
that the Basque Nationalist Party
(PNV). the political organization that
Ibarretxe belongs to, has given long
standing political support to the ter
rorist organization Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA).
"The PNV opposes to any legal
and political measure adopted by the
Spanish government in order to weak
en ETA," Gonzalez said. "In short, the
PNV exploits the existence of ETA
and its methods — killing and kidnap
ping included — as a way to impose
its rule on Basque society and to phys
ically exclude non-Basque national
ists."
Gonzalez cited an example in
which the PNV including Ibarretxe''s
vice president, signed a 1998 secret
political agreement with ETA "in
order to create a new stage in the con
frontation with Spain." According to
