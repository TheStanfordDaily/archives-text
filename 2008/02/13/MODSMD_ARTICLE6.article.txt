# Basque debate continues
## Second petition surfaces in support of President Ibarretxe's arrival 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In anticipation of Thursday's visit
by the Basque Government presi
dent, a maelstrom of international
controversy has surfaced. Stanford's
plans to host Juan Jose Ibarretxe has
garnered coverage from both U.S. and
Spanish media outlets, including the
two largest Spanish national newspa
pers, EI Pais and El Mundo.
A petition protesting Ibarretxe's
talk had garnered over S.(XX) signa
tures as of Tuesday. However, within
the last two weeks, another petition
has emerged in support of the lecture.
It has since received over 3.000 signa
tures.
The second petition calls on
Stanford "to disregard the petitions of
groups that pretend to obstruct free
dom of speech." It further argues that
"everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regard
less of frontiers."
lire democratically elected presi
dent's visit has led to deep divisions
over whether the leader should be

allowed to speak on campus in the
current format.
Rafael Dobado Gonzalez, a pro
fessor of history and economic institu
tions at the Universidad Complutense
in Madrid who signed the first peti
tion. said he wishes that the audience
could he offered a contrasting per
spective to Ibarretxes. He believes
that the Basque Nationalist Party
(PNV). the political organization that
Ibarretxe belongs to, has given long
standing political support to the ter
rorist organization Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA).
"The PNV opposes to any legal
and political measure adopted by the
Spanish government in order to weak
en ETA," Gonzalez said. "In short, the
PNV exploits the existence of ETA
and its methods — killing and kidnap
ping included — as a way to impose
its rule on Basque society and to phys
ically exclude non-Basque national
ists."
Gonzalez cited an example in
which the PNV including Ibarretxe''s
vice president, signed a 1998 secret
political agreement with ETA "in
order to create a new stage in the con
frontation with Spain." According to
El Mundo, the PNV agreed "to break
all agreement with [other non-nation
alist, political parties] whose goal is
the destruction of the Basque
Country and the building of Spain."
Ihe leaders of the PNV denied this
agreement until the ETA published it
in the Spanish newspaper. Gara, on
Apr. 30.2000.
Gonzalez added that he believed
the talk would be used as a political
platform.
"[lbarretxe] is not an academic try
ing to search the truth on a certain sci
entific issue to relevant colleagues." he
said. "1 le is a politician attempting (to
sell] his political merchandise to a dis
tinguished and influential audience
without competitors. At the same
time, he will sell [his message] in
Spain, especially, in the Basque
Country that Stanford is receptive to
his message."
But Jeff Wachtel, special assistant
to Stanford President John Hennessy,
championed free expression and the
exchange of ideas.
"While we recognize that there are
those who disagree with Mr.
Ibarretxe, the principle of free speech
and open discourse on this subject
takes priority at a university," Wachtel
said. "President Hennessy's analysis
and personal opinion [on] the political
issues that have been raised does not
have a bearing on this invitation."
Elisenda Paluzie, an economics
scholar in Spain, was one of the peo

ple who signed the second petition,
which was in support of the lecture.
"[The protesters'] proposal to
either cancel the event altogether, or
to invite a political challenger to
Ibarretxe's claims is not only ridicu
lous but it reveals a deeply inquisitor
ial, dictatorial and anti-democratic
vein," Paluzie said.
She, too, placed an emphasis on the
need for free speech.
"This conference also fulfills one of
the roles of the university," Paluzie
said. "A place where one listens to dif
ferent ideas, discusses and debates
political, historical, philosophical
issues. It is an opportunity for students
and scholars to listen to a political
leader from a minority people —the
Basques."
Paluzie further explained that for
the majority of Spaniards, the exis
tence of different nations, cultures and
languages is a problem.
"They would never recognize [the
Basques'] right to self-determination,
their right to decide, as stated by
President Wilson's Fourteen Points or
the U.N. Charter," she said.
"Ibarretxe's proposal is about giving
the voice and the decision to the
Basques."
A number of the organizers and
supporters of the petition are plan
ning to protest during the lecture,
which will be held at Arrillaga Alumni
Center at 4 p.m. Thursday afternoon.
"I want the Americans to know

that in Europe the nationalists still
have some power," said Jose Jenaro, a
Silicon Valley worker who grew up in
the Basque city of Vitoria and plans to
protest the talk. "They market them
selves as peaceful people, but in reali
ty they control the media, the streets
and they terrorize their own people."
Laura Wilson, chief of police at the
Department of Public Safety (DPS),
said that the protesters should be
aware of what constitutes a legal
protest.
"What is not permissible is to dis
rupt an event to the degree that lawful
business, such as the ability of a speak
er to speak, cannot be continued," she
said. "If an event is closed to the pub
lic or tickets are required, it is illegal to
obtain entry and a person may be sub
ject to arrest for trespassing. It is also
a violation of law to incite others to
riot."
For security reasons, Wilson was
not able to discuss the specifics of the
security measures for the Ibarretxe
event. However, Nick Brunot,a police
services officer from the DPS. pointed
out that he had been advising the
organizers on how to protest legally.
"We have created a demonstration
area for the protest group outside the
lecture," he said, "[in order] to allow
them to exercise their first amend
ment right."
