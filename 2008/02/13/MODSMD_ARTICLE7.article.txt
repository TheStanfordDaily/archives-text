## Aid changes to be announced Trustees discuss plans to bolster financial aid packages 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
llie University is expected to announce
changes to its financial aid and tuition policies
next week, the chair of Stanford's Board of
Trustees said Monday.

The announcement will come more than
two months after Harvard University declared
it would significantly increase financial aid
granted to middle-class and upper-middle
class students. Several schools, including Yale
and Dartmouth, made similar announcements
amid growing concerns that tuition at some of
the nation's top universities is becoming too
high for families to afford.
Board of Trustees Chairman Burt
McMurtry M.S. '59 Ph.D. '62 praised Stanford
for improving its financial assistance programs
annually for the last few years. But he also rec

ognized major announcements coming from
other universities regarding their aid policies.
"Since we are competing for students with
them," McMurtry said, "we really want to
make sure that our financial aid policies are
consistent with where we really want to he.
ITiis, as you might guess, is very complicated."
McMurtry said the changes, discussed at the
Board's February meeting, have been made
possible through donations to lTie Stanford
Fund and fundraising campaigns by President


LAURA CHANG/ r
The Stanford Daily J
John Hennessy.
The announcement also comes
after the members of the U.S. Senate
Finance Committee requested infor
mation from Harvard, Yale and 134
other schools about their endow
ments and whether they were mak
ing enough funds available to make
colleges more affordable.
McMurtry said Stanford was the
first university to make a meaningful
move in this field after the Board
decided last year to raise the payout
rate of the University's endowment
from 5 percent to 5.5 percent. This
increased payout has helped fund
capital projects and financial aid pro
grams.
Stanford's endowment grew
about 21 percent last year to $17.1
billion.
McMurtry said the Board had
been wrestling with saving the funds

for the benefit of future students and
the option of deploying more funds
for current students.
"We felt it was important to [bol
ster our aid]," he said.
McMurtry also said he was satis
fied with the number of applicants to
Stanford this year. Although the
number of early applicants declined
from the previous year, the Office of
Admission reported that the number
of applications processed as of Feb. 6
was 24,864, an increase of more than
IXXX) applicants from the previous
year.
"There is no concern on the num
ber of applicants," McMurtry said.
"There remains a concern about how
we select from so many qualified
people."
Board members further discussed
plans for a new performing arts cen
ter near Frost Amphitheater that will
house a 900-seat theater for music
concerts and a smaller venue for the
atrical performances.
The Board also considered plans
to replace the Stanford Track House
with a visitor center that will offer

campus tours, which are currently
facilitated through Visitor
Information Services at Memorial
Auditorium. It gave preliminary
approval for the construction of a
parking structure on the east side of
Maples Pavilion.
McMurtry also said the
University will hold a formal dedica
tion ceremony on Mar. 4 for the
opening of the Jerry Yang and Akiko
Yamazaki Environment and Energy
Building. He said he was excited
about the possibilities of concentrat
ing strong faculty from multiple
departments who will work together
on world problems.
'it's our most dramatic statement
by far in trying to do sustainable
building," McMurtry said, referring
to the high environmental standards
the University agreed to meet in the
building's construction. "It serves as
a model for what we should be think
ing about for practically all of our
construction."
