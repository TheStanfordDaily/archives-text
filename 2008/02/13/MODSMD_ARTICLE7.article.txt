## Aid changes to be announced Trustees discuss plans to bolster financial aid packages 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
llie University is expected to announce
changes to its financial aid and tuition policies
next week, the chair of Stanford's Board of
Trustees said Monday.

The announcement will come more than
two months after Harvard University declared
it would significantly increase financial aid
granted to middle-class and upper-middle
class students. Several schools, including Yale
and Dartmouth, made similar announcements
amid growing concerns that tuition at some of
the nation's top universities is becoming too
high for families to afford.
Board of Trustees Chairman Burt
McMurtry M.S. '59 Ph.D. '62 praised Stanford
for improving its financial assistance programs
annually for the last few years. But he also rec

ognized major announcements coming from
other universities regarding their aid policies.
"Since we are competing for students with
them," McMurtry said, "we really want to
make sure that our financial aid policies are
consistent with where we really want to he.
ITiis, as you might guess, is very complicated."
McMurtry said the changes, discussed at the
Board's February meeting, have been made
possible through donations to lTie Stanford
Fund and fundraising campaigns by President
