## Mother of Tupac shares source of personal strength 
### STEPHANIE WERNER 
As part of its Centennial Celebration. Alpha Kappa
Alpha hosted Afeni Shakur, mother of the late rapper
TUpac Shakur. in the Tresiddcr Oak Room last night.
Shakur — activist, author and CEO of Amaru
Entertainment/Amaru Records — stressed the impor
tance of mentors in developing character and personal
strength.
One of Shakur's own mentors was her great-grand
mother. who was "one of the most important things that
happened to [her]."
"If my great-grandmother had not told me basic
things when 1 was a little girl, then in 1% 1 > when I was
arrested I would have fell apart. But my great-grand
mother had already prepared me for what life was."
Despite the fact that Shakur never finished high
school, she made it very clear that "getting out of high
school never meant that [she] had
an excuse to not read, study or
know."
During her tenure as a member
of the Black Panther Party, Shakur
said she dealt with a lot of anger.
"1 became so angry about so
many things that my anger took me
to a place that 1 could not recover,"
she said. "This is a roundabout way
of saying 1 was a crackhead."
According to Shakur, the biggest
step that leaders of our generation
can take toward obtaining civil

rights is to become a mentor to
someone in trouble.
"You gotta let that person [in
trouble] know that they can
change," she said. "It's important
that they know that life is not over,
that you don't look at them a certain
way."
Shakur also stressed the impor
tance of working together and utiliz
ing the strengths of each individual.
" ITiere is somebody that can do
everything when we learn not to
pick on each other," she said. "If 1
have faith in other people, there are
so many things we can accomplish."
Shakur further discussed the
willingness to accept failure as a
part of personal growth, having a
consistent life, judging people

based on their character instead of
their outward appearance, not
allowing anger to motivate action
and developing methods of conflict
resolution.
Shakur's passion reached her
diverse audience last night, which
packed Tresidder Oak West Room
to the point of overflowing into the
Oak East Room.
"Her frank discussion of her past
was fascinating, if surprising," said
Ben Sumers '11. "Many speakers
will shield their thoughts from a
crowd, but she opened, or made it
seem that she opened, her past to
the audience."
