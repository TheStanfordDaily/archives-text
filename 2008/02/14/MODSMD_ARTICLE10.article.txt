# Pour some sugar on me...

Handing out sweets has long
been a tactic for attracting
attention on Valentine's
Day. For the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center staff, it's
an all-day event designed
to increase the center's visibility on campus.
Today, the Bridge is inviting students to come to
he center and decorate sugar cookies. Whitney Martin '09,
who is organizing the event, said she hopes it will help people connect
the organization with its specific location.
Along with three other students, she is a "live-in" at the Bridge
center, making sure that someone trained in peer counseling is avail
able to talk at all times — even when the counselors aren't scheduled
to do so.

" "We have counselors that cover three-hour shifts between 9 a.m.
and midnight," Martin explained."From midnight to 9 a.m. we never have
staffers, we just have live-ins cover the phone."
According to Martin, the Bridge is a place where people can "just talk it
out with somebody." But in order for students to drop by, they first have to

know where the center is located.
"When I say i live in the Bridge,' nobody knows what I'm talking about,"
Martin said. "But we have a really central location."
"We re right inside Tresidder," she continued. "But because Tresidder is
such a large building, it's hard to figure out what side."
Martin is betting that for free cookies, people will take the time to figure
it out.
Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour '08, who is planning to attend the event, said it
was the free cookies that caught his eye.
"It seems like something I wouldn't mind stopping by to pick up," he said.
Osei-Kuffour said that this will be his first event at the Bridge.To aid stu
dents like him in finding the cookie event — and, the staff hopes, to eventu
ally find their way back — the group said that it plans on making a path of
flyers that will lead students to the event. But according to Stacie Chan '10,
who also plans to attend the event, cookies might be all they need to bring in
a crowd.
"People will go to events at Stanford just for the free food," said Chan,
who serves as the co-chair of social programming initiatives for the ASSU.
"Who doesn't love free food?"
