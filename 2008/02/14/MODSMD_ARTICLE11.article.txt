## Adult film star's remarks spark debate Tonight's speaker to address safe sex in pornography 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Gay pornographic actor and activist
Michael Lucas will speak tonight in
Cubberley Auditorium regarding the role of
the adult entertainment industry in AIDS
prevention. But some students have raised
concerns over controversial remarks attrib
uted to Lucas about the Arab and Muslim
communities.
As a result of the comments, members of
the group Queer & Asian (Q&A) voted
through email not to co-sponsor the event. Of
about 15 active members, approximately half
voted against supporting the event, with the
lone affirmative vote retracted after a Q&A
member sent out an email with more infor
mation.
Lucas has spoken out against the Muslim
faith for its condemnation of homosexuality.
In a New York Blade op-ed, he wrote, "the
Koran is today's 'Mein Kampf,"' alleging that
the Koran inspires followers to kill homosex
uals.
"We just found [his comments] really per
sonal for our group, because we are queer
and Asian, and one of our main purposes is to
talk about the intersection of race and sexu
ality," said Q&A co-president Herwin
Icasiano' 10. "As representatives, in a way, of
the Arab and Muslim community, I don't
think it would be wise on our part to sponsor
the event."
Lucas, whose talk is entitled "The Role of
Safe Sex in Pornography and Cultural AIDS
Prevention," is the founder and CEO of
Lucas Entertainment, a New York
based gay adult film company. He is Hq*
known for his safe sex and anti-drug " «s

advocacy — a stance that prompt
ed the Speakers Bureau to invite
him to Stanford. 1
Carrie Mlynarczyk '09, a 1
member of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, said that Stanford has
hosted pornographic stars to dis
cuss AIDS prevention in the past.
"A lot of people always come to

those events," she said. "And AIDS is clearly
a big issue on campus, so this is just an inter
esting perspective."
Mlynarczyk said she had not read all of
Lucas's statements. But from what she saw,
"he was expressing his concerns on an issue
as opposed to trying to make a blanket state
ment."
"Clearly I'm not going to support or agree
with anyone who is racist or discriminates
against other groups," she said. "But when I
saw what people were saying was controver
sial, 1 was a little confused. It seemed he was
simply making statements about the ways
that gay people have been treated in specific
cultures, or events that have happened."
Patrick Cordova '09, an undergraduate
senator and Speakers Bureau member, said
that while he does not condone Lucas's opin
ions, his comments are rooted in real criticism
of homophobia and hatred around the world.
"Do they induce some hurt feelings?
Yeah, it appears as if that's the case,"
Cordova said. "But 1 don't see that there is a
real connection between pornography and
Muslim issues. The issue of sexuality and of
individuals being susceptible to HIV/AIDS
transmission — that's not race- or religion
specific."
Still, student reactions to Lucas's selection
as a speaker raise questions about racial and
