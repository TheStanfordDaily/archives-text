### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Stanford Sweat-Free
Coalition rallied in White Plaza Wednesday,
geared into action by reports of workers'
rights violations in a company that makes
Stanford hats. The Coalition encourages the
University to take action against possible
labor abuses from companies contracting
with Stanford.
The event was spurred by widespread
reports of unsafe working conditions,
employee mistreatment and racial and gen

der discrimination at the Alabama-based
New Era Cap Company, which makes
Stanford hats.
"Universities that are affiliated with the
WRC [Worker Rights Consortium] were
immediately notified by the WRC of the vio

factory," said Iheresa Zhen '09, who organ

Several major universities — such as the
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
and the University of Wisconsin-Madison —
have threatened to terminate or have termi
nated their licensing agreements with New
Era, citing the company's refusal to cooper
ate in an investigation by the WRC, an inde
pendent monitoring organization. On
Monday, the New Era Cap Company

Sweat-Free Coalition. "Stanford has not
been proactive at any step of the way in
