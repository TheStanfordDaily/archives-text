## GSC reviews alumni mentoring program 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I\vo representatives from Stanford
Alumni Mentoring (SAM), a student
group which aims to connect under
graduate students with alumni in one
on-one online mentoring relation
ships, provided an overview of the
program's goals and funding needs to
the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
last night.
According to Marlene S. Stern, the
career networking programs manag
er, the main objective of last night's
presentation was to obtain direct
feedback on the program from GSC
members and to inform them about
the free online mentoring service.
SAM is geared towards undergradu
ates, but the service eventually expects
to expand to the graduate level. Stern
said.
According to Stern, SAM is cur
rently a useful tool for undergraduate
students who wonder about graduate
school, the working world or life after
Stanford in general. Through their
Web site — mentoring.stanford.edu
— a student is paired with an experi
enced mentor who is selected based
on that student's interests, preferences
and criteria, Stern said.
The mentor criteria are chosen by
the student — who first needs to fill
out an online application — and can
range from the mentor's ethnicity,
years of experience after graduation,
industry, degree and even their cur
rent location. Stern said. Students can
also check the mentors' profiles,
although names are kept anonymous,
"Initially, you won't know the
name or organization where these
mentors work," Stern said. "We don't
want students fishing for CEOs or for
Tiger Woods and Chelsea [Clinton].
What is really important is what the
student has in common with the men
tor and what interests them about
their profile."
According to Stephanie K. Eberle,
graduate career counselor, there are
currently 540 alumni mentors and 130
active mentees participating.

The program was unanimously
praised by the GSC members and
many agreed that a similar initiative
could be beneficial to graduate candi
dates if the service were aimed at aca
demic mentoring. Graduate students
could seek mentoring advice when
debating between staying in academia
and working for an industry, Stern
said.
But according to both Stern and

"We want
mentoring to be
part of the culture
of the campus."

Eberle, lack of continuous funding has
prevented SAM from expanding.
Stern stated that the SAM program
currently has no permanent staff, but
only some dedicated volunteers and a
couple of alumni who answer emails.
"With additional funding we could
make some structural changes and
upgrade our software," Stern claimed.
"We need money because if the pro
gram is going to grow, we should have
in place an infrastructure and perma
nent staff."
Stern also said their goal is to
recruit more alumni and students to
participate in the program.
"We want mentoring to be part of
the culture of the campus," she said.
SAM is currently sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association (SAA)
and Career Development Center
(CDC), and works in conjunction with
the Stanford Career Network (SCN).
