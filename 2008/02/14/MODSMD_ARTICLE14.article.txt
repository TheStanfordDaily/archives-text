## Journalist recalls time as Israeli prison guard Goldberg discusses Israeli-Palestinian divide 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
As a military policeman in the
Israeli army, Jeffrey Goldberg kept
Palestinian activists behind bars. As
a journalist, he counts some of those
former prisoners as both trusted
sources and friends.
Goldberg, the author of
"Prisoners: A Story of Friendship
and Terror," spoke to a small but
enthusiastic crowd of about fifty stu
dents and community members
Wednesday night in Jordan Hall.
Goldberg is currently a national
correspondent for The Atlantic and
is a former Middle East correspon
dent for The New Yorker. His book
reflects on his experiences as a
prison guard in the Israeli Defense
Forces and the lasting relationships
he maintains with the Palestinians
he met at the prison. These rela
tionships, which have allowed him
unique access as a journalist cover
ing the Middle East, have also
informed his opinions on Israeli-
Palestinian tensions.

Underlying the various regional
challenges in the Middle East.
Goldberg argued, is not just the
tension between Israelis and
Palestinians but "the more conse
quential war between medievalism
and modernity within Islam itself."
Goldberg illustrated this
dichotomy with two stories from
one of his recent trips to Gaza.
"1 met with one of my former
prisoners — whom I don't neces
sarily like — who is a regional
leader of Hamas," Goldberg said.
"Part of his job is to recruit suicide
bombers. His teenage son entered
the room, and 1 asked him if he
wanted his own son to become a
suicide bomber. He told me he
would be very proud."
Goldberg contrasted that with a
story of another former prisoner, a
leader of Fatah whom Goldberg
calls a friend.
"He told me that his son. too.
wanted to be a suicide bomber,"
Goldberg said. "But instead of
encouraging his son. he told him
that God doesn't want him to rush
to Heaven. God wants him to
improve the situation on Earth so
that no more children have to die."

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, author of "Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and
Terror," spoke before a crowd of students about his experiences with Palestinian
activists while serving as a prison guard in the Israeli Defense Forces.
As long as the Palestinian com
munity is divided between these
ideologies, Goldberg emphasized,
there is no one way for legitimate
negotiations to begin. But
Goldberg remained optimistic that
both Americans and Israelis can
help Palestinian moderates prevail.
"The United States can renew
its rhetorical commitment to
democracy in the Middle East,"
Goldberg said, "and Israel can dis
engage from the West Bank, where
settlements have been both a
moral and a practical failure."
Students in the crowd wondered
how to apply Goldberg's perspec
tive to the Stanford campus.
"How should student groups

engage in a dialogue on the Middle
East conflict?" asked Carrie
Mlynarczyk '09, co-president of
the Stanford Israel Alliance.
"Dialogue won't be effective
with a group that calls Israel an
apartheid state," Goldberg said
bluntly. "How much conversation
can you really have with someone
who believes you support
apartheid? For real dialogue, both
sides must be committed to an
equitable, two-state solution."
Mark Donig "09, also a co-presi
dent of the Stanford Israel
Alliance, was pleased with the
event but hoped to increase stu
dent turnout in the future.
"We really want to reach more
students who don't have a lot of
exposure to these issues," Donig
said.
