## One Voice bridges Israeli-Palestinian gap 
### BRIAN ANDREW 
Israeli Noga Ron and Palestinian
Wafa Nazzal are unlikely partners in
the movement to end the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. But their differ
ences just might work to their
advantage.
Ron and Nazzal are youth lead
ers of One Voice, a citizen activism
movement working in Israel and
Palestine to achieve a two-sjate
solution through non-violent means.
The pair spoke at Stanford last night
as representatives of One Voice to
discuss the organization's goals and
history since its founding in 2002 at
the height of the second Intifada, a
period of renewed violence between
Israelis and Palestinians that began
in 2000.
In the past six years, 650,000
Israelis and Palestinians have signed
onto the One Voice mandate that
"recognizes the right of both people
to independence, sovereignty, free
dom, justice, dignity and respect."
Rather than propose its own res
olution to the crisis, One Voice seeks
to empower Palestinians and Israelis
to demand that their leaders work
toward a two-state solution.
"We believe it's very important
to honor our leaders," said Nazzal,
21. in Building 420 last night. "We
support the Palestinian and Israeli
leaders in their quest for a peaceful

conclusion to the conflict."
Although One Voice strives to
reach all levels of the population,
one of its main objectives is working
with young political leaders and urg
ing young people to vote. Both
One Voice Israel and One Voice
Palestine believe that involving the
next generation is essential to
achieving lasting peace.
"We believe in the young peo
ple," said Ron, 28. "We need to
encourage and educate the future
leaders.
Ron was born and raised in an
isolated Kibbutz in southern Israel.
In describing her earliest memory of
violence in Israel, she recalled a
series of bombing attacks in 1995
that swept the country, including Tel
Aviv, where her older sister was liv
ing.
After completing her mandatory
service in the Israeli Defense Forces,
Ron traveled to South Africa and
the United States before returning
to Israel to enroll at the University
of Tel Aviv. She said that she finally
realized that something was not
right about the way she and her fam
ily had been living while she trav
eled abroad.
"There's nothing normal about
calling mv sister at age 15 in tears,"
