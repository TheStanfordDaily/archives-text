## One Voice bridges Israeli-Palestinian gap 
### BRIAN ANDREW 
Israeli Noga Ron and Palestinian
Wafa Nazzal are unlikely partners in
the movement to end the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. But their differ
ences just might work to their
advantage.
Ron and Nazzal are youth lead
ers of One Voice, a citizen activism
movement working in Israel and
Palestine to achieve a two-sjate
solution through non-violent means.
The pair spoke at Stanford last night
as representatives of One Voice to
discuss the organization's goals and
history since its founding in 2002 at
the height of the second Intifada, a
period of renewed violence between
Israelis and Palestinians that began
in 2000.
In the past six years, 650,000
Israelis and Palestinians have signed
onto the One Voice mandate that
"recognizes the right of both people
to independence, sovereignty, free
dom, justice, dignity and respect."
Rather than propose its own res
olution to the crisis, One Voice seeks
to empower Palestinians and Israelis
to demand that their leaders work
toward a two-state solution.
"We believe it's very important
to honor our leaders," said Nazzal,
21. in Building 420 last night. "We
support the Palestinian and Israeli
leaders in their quest for a peaceful

conclusion to the conflict."
Although One Voice strives to
reach all levels of the population,
one of its main objectives is working
with young political leaders and urg
ing young people to vote. Both
One Voice Israel and One Voice
Palestine believe that involving the
next generation is essential to
achieving lasting peace.
"We believe in the young peo
ple," said Ron, 28. "We need to
encourage and educate the future
leaders.
Ron was born and raised in an
isolated Kibbutz in southern Israel.
In describing her earliest memory of
violence in Israel, she recalled a
series of bombing attacks in 1995
that swept the country, including Tel
Aviv, where her older sister was liv
ing.
After completing her mandatory
service in the Israeli Defense Forces,
Ron traveled to South Africa and
the United States before returning
to Israel to enroll at the University
of Tel Aviv. She said that she finally
realized that something was not
right about the way she and her fam
ily had been living while she trav
eled abroad.
"There's nothing normal about
calling mv sister at age 15 in tears,"

Youth leaders Noga Ron and Wafa Nazzal spoke last night on behalf of
One Voice, a citizen activism movement working in Israel and Palestine to
achieve a two-state solution to the crisis.
she said. "There's nothing normal
about not going on the buses for
eight years because 1 was afraid.
There's nothing normal about open
ing your bag every time you go to
the cinema because someone may
be carrying in a bomb."
Nazzal was born in Saudi Arabia
but was raised in Jenin in the West
Bank. She said that she has wrestled
with her Palestinian identity since
her father moved the family from
Jordan to Jenin in 1995.
In April 2002 one of the fiercest
battles of the second Intifada
occurred at Jenin's refugee camp.
During the ten-day invasion, a

brother of Nazzal's friend, a free
lance reporter, was shot in the leg by
Israeli forces and later died.
"The smell of death was every
where in Jenin." Nazzal said. "You
didn't feel safe walking in the
streets because you might be shot."
Nazzal became a strong believer
in the One Voice movement after
attending a town hall meeting in
Jenin City. Although her uncle told
her that she was wasting her time by
coming to the United States to talk
to college undergraduates, Nazzal
said she still believes a two-state
solution can be obtained through
non-violent means.
Laurel Rnpp. the international
education program manager for
One Voice, does not think that dis
cussion of the conflict can be limit
ed to the areas directly affected.
"So often you'll find this conflict
has spread throughout the area,"
she said. "It's spread throughout the
Middle East, to the United States, to
Stanford's student groups."
The One Voice presentation was
not organized by any groups affiliat
ed with the Israeli or Palestinian
movements: the event was co-spon
sored by the year-old Students
Promoting Ethnic and Cultural
Kinship (SPEAK).
"Many are interested in the
[Israeli-Palestinian conflict] from a
political perspective." said Sarah
Kleinman '08. Co-executive director
of SPEAK. "But we're looking at it
from a standpoint of identity."
Both Ron and Nazzal admit that
there are challenges ahead, espe
cially now that Israelis cannot enter
Palestinian territories and
Palestinians must get special per
mission to enter Israel. But both
said they have experienced the
darker side of the conflict â€” and
neither wishes it to return.
