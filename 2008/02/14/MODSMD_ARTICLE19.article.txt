On how Brook Lopez compares to some
of the players he coached, including
twin big men Jason and Jarron Collins:
From a standpoint of talent foi a guy his size, [Brook] is
unique He con really shoot the ball He's got great feel
He, like the Collins twins or some of the bigs I hod, he's big
He's a big — both of them are big strapping kids. He's very
skilled
I think probably. Jarron and Jason had a little belter
knowledge of the game at this stage. They weie very smart
playeis, knew how to play very well together But you know
with as good as the league is, there's not a big guy that's com
parable to Brook in terms of his ability to control the game as
he does. And he's starting to do that more and more.
I think emotionally, they've [Brook and Robin] got a
ways to go. They're just not as mature emotionally. But that's
part of the process of being in college, just growing up
On how the Pac-10 today compares to
the competitiveness during his 18
years:
It's very good right now and the reason it's orguubly bet
ter than it was during any lime in my tenure is because of the
bottom of the league, not the top of the league. Everybody's
talking about this team and that team, but it seemed like we
always had a team that was No I. We were No 1, Arizona
was No. 1, UCLA was We always had real quality teams at the
top.
What the league has now, is that it's much deeper
through nine teams But somebody's going to finish ninth
in this league and they're going to be pretty doggone good. In
my mind, that's what always mode it such a good league. It
wasn't the teams at the top, we alwoys had that, it was the

teams at the bottom.
I think it's the best that I can remember from top to bot
tom.
On how he empathizes with football
coach Jim Harbaugh, after having to
rebuild Stanford's reputation as a big
time basketball school when he took
over in 1986:
It's going to take time. He's got to gel seven really po
tential all Pat 10 type players this year, and then next year
seven more, and then the next . he's got to build it up so
that its quality is much greatei in terms ol talent level ..You
know, some continuity would be really good. Jim seems to
have a charisma about him with these kids that they really re
late to — bis having been an ex NFL player and all that stuff.
There's a lot of things that ore most positive.
On working with different admissions
directors and managing recruiting:
There were five or six different admissions diiectors
when I was here Each one has a different way of doing
their business I think that athletics bos a place here, and
theie's always been resistance to that, trying to moke sure
there's a proper perspective where athletics fits into a uni
versity like this. And I think the people have done a great
|ob of understanding that athletics can be positive for this
place, in terms of visibility, fundroising.
Our athletics are excellent just like the rest of the place.
I think it all fits in. I think there's been a pretty good under
stonding. But every time you hire someone new to make those
decisions, they may have something different in mind.
