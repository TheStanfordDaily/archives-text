If the office is any indication, the transi
tion is still incomplete. The walls of
Mike Montgomery's new office in the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center are still
mostly bare, adorned only with a photo
of Pebble Beach and a blown-up shot of for
mer Stanford star Mark Madsen celebrating
after the Cardinal clinched a berth to the 1998
Final Four. The Madsen shot, however, has
not been mounted yet; it rests against the
wall. Montgomery, the former Stanford coach
who reached his only Final Four that year,
said his new position as assistant to Athletic
Director Bob Bowlsby was "a work in
progress."
The Daily sat down with Montgomery for
an hour-long interview earlier this month to
talk about his new role at Stanford, his stint
coaching in the NBA and his fondest memo
ries from The Farm. Montgomery also dis
cussed his relationship with current Stanford
men's basketball coach Trent Johnson, and
whether he will ever return to the sidelines —
a possibility,he said.because "there's still a lot
of basketball in my blood."
Montgomery began his part-time position
in September, a role that has included
fundraising, public relations and serving as a
resource for coaches.The coach, who will turn
61 later this month, said he had always consid
ered a move to the front office after he was
done coaching.
The thing is, he's not so sure he's done.
"I'm not as old as I thought," Montgomery
said. "I think things have changed. I enjoy
being around here; I just have a lot of respect
for Stanford and the athletes that perform
here because 1 know how hard they all
work.
"But you know there's still a lot of bas
ketball in my blood, just because you do
something for that long," he added. "We'll
have to wait and see if anything develops
there ... You've done something for 37
years, and it's just what you do."
Montgomery, who amassed a 393-167
record in his 18 years at the helm of Stan
ford basketball, gets his basketball fix these
days doing part-time broadcast work for
FOX Sports Net. Comcast and CBS Radio.
"It keeps me in the basketball loop," he said,
"which is good for me."
Every now and then. Montgomery will
drop by Maples Pavilion as the men's bas
ketball team is practicing. He's known John
son, his successor, for years. He recruited
Johnson while working as an assistant coach
at Boise State in 1974, and later hired John
son for an assistant coaching position at
Stanford in 199b.
He tries not to be around too much, how
ever.
"I'm sensitive to Trent," Montgomery
said.'i don't want to be around all the time
where it feels like I'm hovering. He deserves
the right to be his own man — and he's
doing a great job."
Johnson, for his part, said he was happy
to have his former coach and mentor
around again.
"1 think he likes to see somebody else
sweat," Johnson said with a smile. "He'll
come by and say 'God, you've had a lot of
close games' or 'You've done a good job
controlling your temper, but you need to
enjoy it more.'"
"Still, I would like a little more help,"
Johnson deadpanned.
For Montgomery, having his former
player and assistant follow his footsteps is
the perfect fit. "The knowledge that he has
of Stanford, of what it takes, the type of is
sues that you deal with is extremely benefi
cial," Montgomery said.'i thought it was a
pretty seamless transition."
Transitioning to the NBA, however, was
not seamless for Montgomery. He had a 68-
96 record in two seasons as head coach of
the Golden State Warriors before being re
leased in August 2006. Running a college
basketball program and coaching profes
sionals in the NBA, he learned, are two dif
ferent beasts.
"In college, you're top dog, you're in
charge of everything, you're the guy," he
said. "The kids will listen, they'll look up to

you, you're making the decisions, top to bot
tom, pretty much unilaterally. In the pros,
it's pretty much a players' league. And your
job is to manage those players and make
sure you can try to get them to do what you
need them to do. It's a little more difficult
than it is in college. You don't have the
power."
Montgomery said he had "no regrets"
about taking the job, however.
"It was what it was," he said. "You went
in,a lot of things different |than] you maybe
thought they were. I probably wasn't as pre
pared as I needed to be. obviously."
Montgomery, who led Stanford to 12
NCAA Tournament berths, four regular
season Pac-10 championships and a 2004
Pac-10 Tournament title, said 1998's Final

Four appearance was not the best moment
in his coaching career.
"1 think obviously going [to the] Final
Four, in terms of our program and the thrill
of the Final Four, was spectacular, but that
wasn't our best team. 1 don't think." he said.
"Hut things just really fell into place, which
really was an indication of how the NCAA
tournament is, things have to fall into place
for you.
"1 thought winning our first Pac-10 ap
pearance was huge." he continued. "We
ended up doing it four times, but that first
one — it was like 'Stanford could win the
Pac-10.' UCLA dominated for so long, then
Arizona came along. As good as we were,
winning that championship was the best."
For now. Montgomery remains a spccta

tor. Coaching may come calling again,but in
the meantime he can sit back and watch
while his former protege has guided his
team to a 20-3 season and a top-10 national
ranking.
"I always knew this: when you're donej
you're done, and people don't really care,'*
Montgomery said of mewing on. "You're
out and the next guy's in; I've always said
that. You're old news pretty quickly. You
have to be able to deal with that.
"It's somebody else's gig now.and every
one's excited about the new guy," he added.
"And they should be. TVent's done a great
job."

"1 thought winning our first Pac-10 ap
pearance was huge." he continued. "We
ended up doing it four times, but that first
one — it was like 'Stanford could win the
Pac-10.' UCLA dominated for so long, then
Arizona came along. As good as we were,
winning that championship was the best."
For now. Montgomery remains a spccta

tor. Coaching may come calling again,but in
the meantime he can sit back and watch
while his former protege has guided his
team to a 20-3 season and a top-10 national
ranking.
"I always knew this: when you're donej
you're done, and people don't really care,'*
Montgomery said of mewing on. "You're
out and the next guy's in; I've always said
that. You're old news pretty quickly. You
have to be able to deal with that.
"It's somebody else's gig now.and every
one's excited about the new guy," he added.
"And they should be. TVent's done a great
job."

If the office is any indication, the transi
tion is still incomplete. The walls of
Mike Montgomery's new office in the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center are still
mostly bare, adorned only with a photo
of Pebble Beach and a blown-up shot of for
mer Stanford star Mark Madsen celebrating
after the Cardinal clinched a berth to the 1998
Final Four. The Madsen shot, however, has
not been mounted yet; it rests against the
wall. Montgomery, the former Stanford coach
who reached his only Final Four that year,
said his new position as assistant to Athletic
Director Bob Bowlsby was "a work in
progress."
The Daily sat down with Montgomery for
an hour-long interview earlier this month to
talk about his new role at Stanford, his stint
coaching in the NBA and his fondest memo
ries from The Farm. Montgomery also dis
cussed his relationship with current Stanford
men's basketball coach Trent Johnson, and
whether he will ever return to the sidelines —
a possibility,he said.because "there's still a lot
of basketball in my blood."
Montgomery began his part-time position
in September, a role that has included
fundraising, public relations and serving as a
resource for coaches.The coach, who will turn
61 later this month, said he had always consid
ered a move to the front office after he was
done coaching.
The thing is, he's not so sure he's done.
"I'm not as old as I thought," Montgomery
said. "I think things have changed. I enjoy
being around here; I just have a lot of respect
for Stanford and the athletes that perform
here because 1 know how hard they all
work.
"But you know there's still a lot of bas
ketball in my blood, just because you do
something for that long," he added. "We'll
have to wait and see if anything develops
there ... You've done something for 37
years, and it's just what you do."
Montgomery, who amassed a 393-167
record in his 18 years at the helm of Stan
ford basketball, gets his basketball fix these
days doing part-time broadcast work for
FOX Sports Net. Comcast and CBS Radio.
"It keeps me in the basketball loop," he said,
"which is good for me."
Every now and then. Montgomery will
drop by Maples Pavilion as the men's bas
ketball team is practicing. He's known John
son, his successor, for years. He recruited
Johnson while working as an assistant coach
at Boise State in 1974, and later hired John
son for an assistant coaching position at
Stanford in 199b.
He tries not to be around too much, how
ever.
"I'm sensitive to Trent," Montgomery
said.'i don't want to be around all the time
where it feels like I'm hovering. He deserves
the right to be his own man — and he's
doing a great job."
Johnson, for his part, said he was happy
to have his former coach and mentor
around again.
"1 think he likes to see somebody else
sweat," Johnson said with a smile. "He'll
come by and say 'God, you've had a lot of
close games' or 'You've done a good job
controlling your temper, but you need to
enjoy it more.'"
"Still, I would like a little more help,"
Johnson deadpanned.
For Montgomery, having his former
player and assistant follow his footsteps is
the perfect fit. "The knowledge that he has
of Stanford, of what it takes, the type of is
sues that you deal with is extremely benefi
cial," Montgomery said.'i thought it was a
pretty seamless transition."
Transitioning to the NBA, however, was
not seamless for Montgomery. He had a 68-
96 record in two seasons as head coach of
the Golden State Warriors before being re
leased in August 2006. Running a college
basketball program and coaching profes
sionals in the NBA, he learned, are two dif
ferent beasts.
"In college, you're top dog, you're in
charge of everything, you're the guy," he
said. "The kids will listen, they'll look up to

you, you're making the decisions, top to bot
tom, pretty much unilaterally. In the pros,
it's pretty much a players' league. And your
job is to manage those players and make
sure you can try to get them to do what you
need them to do. It's a little more difficult
than it is in college. You don't have the
power."
Montgomery said he had "no regrets"
about taking the job, however.
"It was what it was," he said. "You went
in,a lot of things different |than] you maybe
thought they were. I probably wasn't as pre
pared as I needed to be. obviously."
Montgomery, who led Stanford to 12
NCAA Tournament berths, four regular
season Pac-10 championships and a 2004
Pac-10 Tournament title, said 1998's Final

Four appearance was not the best moment
in his coaching career.
"1 think obviously going [to the] Final
Four, in terms of our program and the thrill
of the Final Four, was spectacular, but that
wasn't our best team. 1 don't think." he said.
"Hut things just really fell into place, which
really was an indication of how the NCAA
tournament is, things have to fall into place
for you.
"1 thought winning our first Pac-10 ap
pearance was huge." he continued. "We
ended up doing it four times, but that first
one — it was like 'Stanford could win the
Pac-10.' UCLA dominated for so long, then
Arizona came along. As good as we were,
winning that championship was the best."
For now. Montgomery remains a spccta

tor. Coaching may come calling again,but in
the meantime he can sit back and watch
