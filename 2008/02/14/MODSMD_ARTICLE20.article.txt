## Editorial Board Time to take the lead on financial aid 
### 
As the Board of Trustees plans to un
veil its new financial aid policy next
week, students are paying renewed
attention to Stanford's sizable endowment,
which ranks third in the country among uni
versities. ITie University's endowment grew
to $17.1 billion last year, making it larger
than the GDPs of roughly 1(H) nations in the
world. And yet for some strange reason,
some of its students are still paying nearly
$200,000 to attain an education.
The Stanford endowment fund, which is
managed by an independent financial firm,
is allowed to function under a tax-exempt
status on the condition that it serves a "pub
lic benefit." What this public benefit is de
fined as is becoming an issue of contention:
it has drawn the attention of the U.S. Con
gress to reexamine the tax-exempt status of
America's richest universities.
Stanford's undergraduate tuition for the
2007-08 school year is a staggering $34,800,
an increase of $13,500 since 1997. This is
$7,200 above the rate of inflation during that
period, according to a recent article in the
San Francisco Chronicle . With approxi
mately 6,600 undergraduate students en
rolled this year, the cost to give everyone
free tuition would amount to roughly $230
million, still leaving Stanford with over $1.5
billion in interest returned on the endow
ment from last year. If you added graduate
students into the equation, the Stanford en
dowment would still have had roughly $1.2
billion in growth in the 2007 fiscal year. It
seems puzzling to the Editorial Board why a
university that could make education ab
solutely free for all of its students, and still
have an annual profit larger than the GDP
of some dozen odd countries, does not.
Stanford's current policy of "need
based" financial aid. while good in theory, is
comical in practice. It is hard to do anything
but laugh at what is deemed "affordable" by
ivory tower Stanford elites crunching math
ematical formulas. Making families sacrifice
for four years with little financial security
because some administrator or government
bureaucrat defined that as affordable is
downright infuriating when the endowment
is calmly pushing $18 billion.
Since last year, Stanford has been playing
catch-up to Harvard in terms of its financial
aid policy. Harvard leads and Stanford be
grudgingly follows. Even now. Stanford ad
ministrators are meeting to discuss not only
Harvard's newest increase in financial aid,
but also the new Congressional pressure.
Why is a university that prides itself on being
a world leader and innovator dragging its
feet on the question of helping its students
afford an education?

As the Board of Trustees prepares to an
nounce its new policy, it seems as though
there are three distinct paths the University
can take. It can continue to play second fid
dle to schools like Harvard, resentfully fol
lowing the steps being made in financial aid
policy for fear of sullying its good name in
comparison. Stanford could also wait for a
showdown with Congress; as a result, the
University will be forced to either spend
more money on its students or give up its
tax-exempt status. As a third option. Stan
ford could live up to its image and spearhead
a growth in financial aid. It is time for the
University to step up to its claims of being an
educational leader and innovator and make
education free for all students.
Imagine: a free education will attract an
even greater applicant pool, pulling in bril
liant kids that could never dream of afford
ing a Stanford education, even with the cur
rent "need-based" policy. It would force
other leading institutions to follow suit,
making a world-class education attainable
to everyone. Finally, it would satisfy the ulti
mate goals stated by Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper in a Jan. 29 Daily article:
to ensure that all admitted students can at
tend, and to make sure that paying for col
lege is not a factor in a student's decision of
which college to attend.
Not all universities will be able to afford
such measures, but it would create the pres
sure for them to do as much as possible,
making college more affordable to more
people. Ibis isn't just the "right" thing to do
but also the smart thing to do, as it will serve
to create a larger population of highly edu
cated human capital in the United States.
One of Jane Stanford's conditions upon the
founding of Stanford was that it be free to
all. While economic pressure has forced us
to forego that lofty ideal in the past, we have
finally returned to a point of prosperity
where it is no longer an absurd impossibili
ty that would require great sacrifice. Rather,
such a comprehensive financial aid system
is now an attainable goal, one that would
leave us with over a billion dollars in annu
al endowment growth. When all is said and
done, Stanford can either be a follower, a
leader or a revolutionary. All that remains
to be seen is if there is a difference between
what Stanford claims to be and what Stan
ford truly is.
As the Stanford elites meet to discuss the
future of our financial aid policy, now is the
time to let them know how you feel.The Ed
itorial Board encourages you to call, email
and write our University leaders and share
your opinions about the future of financial
aid at Stanford.
