What does adventure mean to you?
Sure, there are action movies, and
since this is Stanford, maybe
you've done something really cool like climb
Mount Everest. But more basically, adven
tures are exercises in trying something new
— taking risks, learning from what happens.
Sometimes, things go great. Once,
on a whim, I tried out for a musical by
singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." It
turned out they were desperate for male
bodies to fill space, so they cast me and 1 got
to pretend to be talented. Other times, pain
ensues. Like when 1 tried the gallon chal
lenge with several freshman hallmates.
Everyone lost, even the milk. But it was still
worth doing once.
Painful or awesome, an adventure
is something you remember — a piece of
your life that makes you who you are. My
first real adventure happened in Italy when
1 was 15. And it was a disaster.
Armed with my English/Italian
dictionary and a naive conception that I was
pretty cool, I left my parents in their hotel
and sought out the Italian nightlife. There
wasn't much nightlife, as we were in a small
coastal area, but I was optimistic.
On the train ride from my hotel to
one of the more happening villages, it took
me about five seconds to decide what my
goal should be for the evening: talk to girls. It
was what any self-respecting, cool 15-year
old boy would do while on his own in Italy.
Thus I spent the remainder of the short train
ride trying to learn a good line in Italian,
which I figured would impress other Ameri
cans at the very least, and perhaps charitable
Italians. I settled on something along the
lines of "Good evening, gee the moon sure is
pretty tonight." Charming, right?
My plans derailed faster than
USC's hopes for a national championship. I
went to a small bar where I saw a few young

people, and. hoping to be even cooler hold
ing a drink. I ordered a Coke. The skinny
bartender looked confused, and then dis
gusted when 1 confirmed I truly wanted just
a Coke. 1 was fifteen after all. Her disdain
burned long after our 25 second interaction.
It took me an hour of walking alone in cir
cles in a nearby plaza to regain enough con
fidence to pursue my original plan of talking
to people I didn't know.
Finally, I spotted a young looking
tourist who was also wandering the beach
front alone."Bona sera," I began,adrenaline
racing. But before 1 could finish, she inter
rupted, saying "I don't speak Italian," in a
very un-charmed way. Perhaps it was be
cause I didn't make it to the moon.
Matters became worse when I
asked her age and found out she was 23,
nearly a decade older. I lied and said that I
was 17, but for some reason it didn't help.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that I
was traveling with my parents.
Though I soon gave up, my Italian
night out was more than just teenage awk
wardness. I apologize if you've already
heard this in a commencement speech or
while listening to peer pressure, but staying
inside all the time doesn't accomplish any
thing. You have to put yourself in a position
to embrace the unexpected. Without taking
a chance, putting your dignity on the line,
reciting a silly Italian phrase, all you can do
