## On the possibility of death 
### 
I have a close friend whose deployment
date for Iraq was recently moved forward.
Another close friend of mine was diag
nosed with lymphoma. Neither of them is
"likely to die" in any real sense — Intrade
puts the odds of Ron Paul winning the 2008
election higher than the fatality rate of both
serving in Iraq and having the type of cancer
my friend has — but each has to deal with the
possibility of death. I thought 1 would pass on
some of the more interesting thoughts they
had shared with me.
1) Someone has to go
Whenever my friend talks about his mili
tary service, his friends tell him they hope he
doesn't get deployed to Iraq. While they
mean this comfortingly, like "get well soon"or
"safe travels," he thinks the sentiment doesn't
really make sense. He enlisted in order to help
shoulder the burden the other members of
the US military are carrying on our nation's
behalf. He did not enlist despite the possibili
ty of deployment, but because of it.
It surprised me to hear my cancer-patient
friend echo the same thoughts. "People are
going to get cancer," she told me. "I don't nec
essarily think it should have been somebody
else rather than me."
2) Facts are inherent; meanings are not
When she first learned she had lym
phoma, my friend spent a day with her
boyfriend deciding how she wanted to com

municate her diagnosis to her other friends.
The fact that she had cancer was immutable,
but her word choice when delivering the
news could have big implications. Was the
cancer a disability like blindness, a life influ
ence like a parent's mental illness, an identity
like homosexuality, an incidence of a collec
tive ill like racism, a lifestyle like keeping
kosher, or a personal challenge like growing
up in the inner city? We struggle with these
questions for a number of conditions, espe
cially when it comes to classifying what might
be called disabilities. What do we want to
cure, and what do we want to preserve? Or is
there a way to both value these life-altering
conditions and seek to eliminate them?
3) Everything is a gift
In the end, my friend decided that one of
her favorite things about herself was the cre
ative way she responded to the world, and
that her cancer diagnosis would be no differ
ent. She was positive and humorous, casting
herself and her cancer as characters in a story,

with neither one just the villain or the hero

"Not every part of me is going to make it
through this," she told me. She was confident
that the parts she left behind, however, would
be replaced by even more interesting and
beautiful facets to her personality.
4) It's more like a color than a shade
Marines don't, as a rule, talk about their
feelings. But one thing my friend does articu
late is that death is ever-present. It's almost a
macabre joke — "Get out of bed, dude! If
you're late for work marines DIE!" It doesn't
change all other aspects of your life, but
rather inserts a new aspect into it. Like
adding color to a black and white photo, it
doesn't change what's already there, it just
adds a new dimension. My cancer-patient
friend said that her corporeality is with her
more now than it was before, but she hasn't
really changed how she spends her time.
There was no "I'm going to focus on what re
ally matters now" moment for her — she still
primarily hangs out with friends and fights
global warming.
5) For whom the bell tolls
Gandhi's great insight into imperialism
was that it didn't just hurt the Indians — it
made barbarians of the British as well. Mar
tin Luther King Jr. applied the same lesson to
American racism — it was black people who
