Racism and xenophobia
To the Editor:
It's difficult to tell whether Rahul
Kanakia's column. "America is for Ameri
cans," is meant as a serious political argu
ment or as a witty satire directed against the
nationalist xenophobes who, alas, comprise
much of the American population. Most of
Kanakia's claims are false in sufficiently sub
tle ways that the column can be taken for se
rious, but every once in a while, he comes up
with a real howler, like "[wje give jobs and
human rights to the poor, huddled masses,"
that leads me to pray that the whole column
is a joke.
Memo to Kanakia: you don't "give" rights

to someone else. Saying that we "give"
human rights to immigrants is just as incoher
ent as saying that the U.S. government
"gives" us free speech. If it's a gift, it's not a
right. And we don't give immigrants jobs any
more than they give us their labor — it's a
marketplace transaction, and, all too often,
one that is unfair in favor of the native-born
American employers. Consider the fields and
sweatshops full of undocumented immi
grants whose employers u*>e the immigration
laws and language barriers as a source of
power to enable them to pay below-mini
mum wages.
I agree with Kanakia on one point. He's
right that it is not racist to feel discomfort
when you interact with a different culture.

What is racist is to blame that discomfort on
the other cultilre, and conclude that they are
obligated to change to conform to your pref
erences — to "self-identify with whites" just
as you do.
And it's telling that Kanakia identifies "na
tive-born American" culture with white cul
ture. That's probably very surprising to actual
Native Americans. Why shouldn't we all assim
ilate to Native American culture? It's also
probably very surprising to black Americans,
who are just as native-born as the white ones.
Why shouldn't we all assimilate to black cul
ture? What's so special about white folks, other
than the fact of their making up a numerical
majority in the continental U.S.. that
their culture gets to be the mandated
culture for everyone in this country?
Kanakia poses self-segregation
and assimilation as the only alterna
tives to a grudging, "guarded" toler-

ation. He should move beyond that
narrowness of mind and spirit and
learn to appreciate the opportunity
to experience "off-script" responses
as the fabulous array of different
modes of human flourishing that
they represent. Come on! Who
wants to live their life from a script?
He might even learn something.
