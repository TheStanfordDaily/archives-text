## No. 7 Stanford takes on Arizona State 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two roads crossed for Arizona State and
Stanford — and led in completely opposite
directions after their Jan. 19 contest, a 67-52
Cardinal victory. That early Pac-10 battle
sparked Stanford's run to the top-10, and pre
cipitated the Sun Devils' fall back to the Ari
zona State teams of years past.
Arizona State, victors of ten in a row, 14-2
and nationally ranked at the time, looked the
part early on their Jan. 19 visit to Maples,
jumping to a 30-20 halftime lead with smoth
ering defense.
But sophomore center Brook Lopez sin
glehandedly erased that deficit in the second
half, scoring 10 straight points as Arizona
State (15-7,5-5 Pac-10) searched in vain for
an answer. Lopez finished with 19 points and
1 h rebounds for the No. 7 Cardinal (20-3,9-2
Pac-10), who, buoyed by the victory, has won
seven straight to crack the top-10 and the top
of the Pac-10 standings (the team is currently
tied with UCLA) for the first time since the
2003-04 season.
This weekend. Stanford looks to keep that
momentum in its corner while it runs its win
streak to nine with visits to Arizona State at
7:30 p.m. tonight and Arizona Saturday at
12:30 pm.
The Sun Devils have been reeling ever
since Brook Lopez's dominating perform
ance against them back in January; Lopez
took a certain pride in ASU's undoing.
"We felt they came in really cocky for all
the young guys they got on their team and
their 10-game win streak." he said after the
win.
Sure enough, cockiness is far more fleet
ing than genuine confidence, and Arizona
State has displayed neither since its loss to the
Cardinal.They had dropped five in a row be
fore last weekend's 59-54 win over Arizona,

falling from a first-place tie to a fifth-place tie
in the league. Once surefire bets for the
NCAA Tournament, the Devils may be more
likely to achieve a mark of a different sort
their fifth straight losing Pac-10 season.
If Stanford can stall speedy freshmen
guards James I larden (18 points. 5 rebounds
per game) and IV Abbott (10 points. 5 re
bounds) as well as junior forward Jeff Pen
dergraph (14 points, seven rebounds), they
have to feel good about their chances tonight.
The Devils' three leading scorers combined
for 35 in the teams' first battle, while their

GAME NOTES: No. 7 Stanford hits the road for a big
weekend in Arizona, beginning with Arizona State
tonight. The Cardinal is coming off a home sweep of
the Oregon schools this past weekend and is current
ly tied for the Pac-10 lead. Arizona State picked up a
huge win over rival Arizona last Sunday, stopping a
five-game losing streak. Stanford won its last meeting
with the Sun Devils, 67-52 back in January.

State. He scored 19 points and grabbed 16 rebounds last time out against the Sun Devils.
other two starters both went scoreless.
Brook Lopez leads the Cardinal
with 18 points and 8 rebounds per
game, though he was relatively quiet
against the Oregon schools last week
end. In Stanford's last game, an ugly
71-56 victory over woeful Oregon
State (6-17, 0-11), a trapping defense
akin to Louisville's in last year's
NCAA Tournament stymied Lopez
into 7 turnovers, no assists and a public
shouting match with his brother
Robin.
However, Brook has carried the
team on his back all season — his strug
gles against Oregon State notwith

standing. Thus, the awakening of his
teammates is what has spurred Stan
ford's recent run.
Without a doubt, the Punxsutawney
Phil of the team is junior forward
Lawrence Hill. Though averaging just
10 points and 6 rebounds after an All
Pac-10 sophomore campaign. Hill has
broken out of a winter slump and
stepped into the sunlight as of late.
After pouring in a game-high 14 against
Oregon State, he has scored at least 13
points in his last three games. He had
managed just one double-figure game
during the six weeks prior.
But it hasn't just been Hill filling a

critical role during the team's 20-win
season. Junior guard Mitch Johnson (7
points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists) and senior
forward Taj Finger (6 points, 5 re
hounds) are the team's most improved
players, senior forward Fred Washing
ton (5 points, 5 rebounds) the team's
best on-ball defender and sophomore
center Robin Lopez (9 points, 6 boards)
the best defender in the post.
Meanwhile, junior guard Anthony
Goods (11 points, 38 percent shooting)
is the team's highest scorer after Brook
Lopez, but is scoring at about the same
rate as last year. If he can elevate his
game, Stanford looks likely to improve

on its 71 points per game, just sixth in
the Pac-10, and make a deep run in the
NCAA Tournament, where games
often hinge on guard play.
On Saturday, Arizona will challenge
the Cardinal with freshman guard Jer
ryd Bayless (20 points per game) and
forwards Chase Budinger (17 points)!
and Jordan Hill (13 points). However*
point guard Nic Wise (8 points) is out
for six weeks with a torn meniscus, antf
the Wildcats have struggled without
him, losing two straight.

momentum in its corner while it runs its win
streak to nine with visits to Arizona State at
7:30 p.m. tonight and Arizona Saturday at
12:30 pm.
The Sun Devils have been reeling ever
since Brook Lopez's dominating perform
ance against them back in January; Lopez
took a certain pride in ASU's undoing.
"We felt they came in really cocky for all
the young guys they got on their team and
their 10-game win streak." he said after the
win.
Sure enough, cockiness is far more fleet
ing than genuine confidence, and Arizona
State has displayed neither since its loss to the
Cardinal.They had dropped five in a row be
fore last weekend's 59-54 win over Arizona,

falling from a first-place tie to a fifth-place tie
in the league. Once surefire bets for the
NCAA Tournament, the Devils may be more
likely to achieve a mark of a different sort
their fifth straight losing Pac-10 season.
If Stanford can stall speedy freshmen
guards James I larden (18 points. 5 rebounds
per game) and IV Abbott (10 points. 5 re
bounds) as well as junior forward Jeff Pen
dergraph (14 points, seven rebounds), they
have to feel good about their chances tonight.
The Devils' three leading scorers combined
for 35 in the teams' first battle, while their

GAME NOTES: No. 7 Stanford hits the road for a big
weekend in Arizona, beginning with Arizona State
tonight. The Cardinal is coming off a home sweep of
the Oregon schools this past weekend and is current
ly tied for the Pac-10 lead. Arizona State picked up a
huge win over rival Arizona last Sunday, stopping a
five-game losing streak. Stanford won its last meeting
with the Sun Devils, 67-52 back in January.

Sophomore Brook Lopez looks to lead Stanford to its eighth straight victory tonight vs. Arizona
State. He scored 19 points and grabbed 16 rebounds last time out against the Sun Devils.
other two starters both went scoreless.
Brook Lopez leads the Cardinal
with 18 points and 8 rebounds per
game, though he was relatively quiet
against the Oregon schools last week
end. In Stanford's last game, an ugly
71-56 victory over woeful Oregon
State (6-17, 0-11), a trapping defense
akin to Louisville's in last year's
NCAA Tournament stymied Lopez
into 7 turnovers, no assists and a public
shouting match with his brother
Robin.
However, Brook has carried the
team on his back all season — his strug
gles against Oregon State notwith

standing. Thus, the awakening of his
teammates is what has spurred Stan
ford's recent run.
Without a doubt, the Punxsutawney
Phil of the team is junior forward
Lawrence Hill. Though averaging just
10 points and 6 rebounds after an All
Pac-10 sophomore campaign. Hill has
broken out of a winter slump and
stepped into the sunlight as of late.
After pouring in a game-high 14 against
Oregon State, he has scored at least 13
points in his last three games. He had
managed just one double-figure game
during the six weeks prior.
But it hasn't just been Hill filling a

critical role during the team's 20-win
season. Junior guard Mitch Johnson (7
points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists) and senior
forward Taj Finger (6 points, 5 re
hounds) are the team's most improved
players, senior forward Fred Washing
ton (5 points, 5 rebounds) the team's
best on-ball defender and sophomore
center Robin Lopez (9 points, 6 boards)
the best defender in the post.
Meanwhile, junior guard Anthony
Goods (11 points, 38 percent shooting)
is the team's highest scorer after Brook
Lopez, but is scoring at about the same
rate as last year. If he can elevate his
game, Stanford looks likely to improve

on its 71 points per game, just sixth in
the Pac-10, and make a deep run in the
NCAA Tournament, where games
often hinge on guard play.
On Saturday, Arizona will challenge
the Cardinal with freshman guard Jer
ryd Bayless (20 points per game) and
forwards Chase Budinger (17 points)!
and Jordan Hill (13 points). However*
point guard Nic Wise (8 points) is out
for six weeks with a torn meniscus, antf
the Wildcats have struggled without
him, losing two straight.
