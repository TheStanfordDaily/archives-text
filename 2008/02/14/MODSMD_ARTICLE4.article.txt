# The 						last stand
## No. 6 Card closes out home schedule 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
With only five games remaining in the
regular season, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team kicks off its final
home stand tonight at 7 p.m. when it faces
the University of Arizona. The Cardinal
looks to extend its 10-game winning streak
before meeting the conference's other
best teams in Arizona State and No. 9 Cal
ifornia in back-to-back games.
Sophomore forward Jayne Appel high
lighted the importance of the encounter
with the Wildcats as the team hopes to
keep its momentum going into the stretch
run of the regular season.
"I think [the key is) setting up our own
game going into the Pac-10 Tournament
and going into the Cal game," she said. "It's
really important that we get it going this
weekend."
Stanford (22-3, 11-2 Pac-10) also has
eyes on the fact that the desert teams' ar
rival marks the last regular season home
games for senior guards Cissy Pierce and
Candice Wiggins. Sophomore J.J. Hones
said that this adds another dimension to
the team's focus.
"I think Thursday starts a very impor
tant weekend because it is senior night
[Saturday's game vs. Arizona State] and
Candice and Cissy's last home league
games," she said.
However, she added that this did not
detract from the intensity with which Stan

ford prepared for Arizona (9-14,3-9 Pac
-10).
"Arizona has been doing well," Hones
said. "They've kept it close in recent
games. They just played Arizona State to a
3-point game, and we only beat Arizona
State by 4, so they're going to come in
looking for the upset."

GAME NOUS: The No. 6 Cardinal prepares for its
last home stand of the season against the Arizona
schools. Stanford has won a season-best 10
games in a row and is one game behind rival Cal
ifornia for the Pac-10 lead. Stanford leads the all
time series with the Wildcats, 46-12. Stanford sen
iors Cissy Pierce and Candice Wiggins will be
playing their final regular-season games at Maples
Pavilion this weekend.


ALEX OPPENHEIMER/The Stanford Daily
Senior guard Candice Wiggins will be playing her final two games in Maples
Pavilion this weekend when the Cardinal takes on the Arizona schools.
ily. In the Jan. 17 meeting, Stanford
beat the 'Cats 89-64. Senior guard
Ashley Whisonant powered Ari
zona's offense with 17 points. She
ranks behind only Wiggins in con
ference scoring with 16.3 ppg and
will be the primary focus of the Car
dinal backcourt defenders.
"The posts will be an advantage
if Whisonant gets to the basket,"
Hones said. "Jayne [Appel] is an
amazing shot blocker, Kayla [Ped
ersen] can block shots and Morgan
[Clyburn] can come in as an equally
great shot-blocker. So 1 feel like our
posts will help as a second line of de
fense in taking care of [Whiso
nant]."
This doesn't mean that the for
wards don't have their own respon
sibilities. Arizona has more height
inside than many of the Cardinal's
recent opponents, especially with
forward Amina Njonkou averaging
13.5 points and 7.2 boards. Njonkou
is joined by freshman forward lfy
Ibekwe, who adds 7.9 rebounds per
game.
Appel. though, is not concerned
about being unprepared. She
praised the high quality scouting by
the coaching staff, adding that a win
would come as long as Stanford fol
lowed its game plan.
"Our scouting should be good,
especially [since it's] the second
time around," Appel said. "We'll be
ready. We're going to try to contain
Amina and know exactly what she
does. [The forwards] will also have
to stay out of foul trouble, especially
[in regards to] Whisonant. If
[Whisonant] does beat our perime
ter defense, then we'll be there to
have their back."
Stanford's bigs will have to man
age the inside effort without key
contributor Jillian Harmon. Har
mon started 18 games, carrying an
average of 7.6 points and 5.8 re
bounds a game, before being side
lined for at least four weeks with a
stress reaction in her right foot. The
Cardinal's depth was a huge factor
in the last Arizona game, as Stan
ford's bench outscored that of the
Wildcats, 23-10. Appel said that
Harmon's absence will serve to en
courage other members of the Car
dinal squad to step in to and make
up the difference.
"Coach [VanDerveer] describes
Jill as [a] warrior type of player who

you can always depend on," Appel
relayed.'it's going to leave a space,
definitely, that people will step into
on our team."
"Jill is just a great all-around
player," Hones agreed. "She always
gets rebounds and she always hus
tles .. She's always a solid force for
us. Now other people are going to
have to step up. 1 feel like everyone

"I think it's a
game [in which]
only we can stop
ourselves."

games."
Appel and Pedersen should have
no trouble handling Njonkou alone.
In the last meeting with the Wild
cats, the two had 16 and 22 points, re
spectively, along with a combined 20
boards. They helped the Card to
outscore Arizona 48-22 in the paint,
dominating the area under the bas
ket.
Although every Pac-10 team is
looking to hand Stanford a loss, the
players are aware that most match
ups will come down to mental
toughness, especially in the games
that the Cardinal is expected to win
handily.
"We just need to make sure that
we're not being lackadaisical or
complacent," Hones said.
"Arizona is very talented,"
Appel added. "We just need to
come out with the mentality of
doing what Stanford does. 1 think
it's a game (in which] only we can
stop ourselves."

up the difference.

With only five games remaining in the
regular season, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team kicks off its final
home stand tonight at 7 p.m. when it faces
the University of Arizona. The Cardinal
looks to extend its 10-game winning streak
before meeting the conference's other
best teams in Arizona State and No. 9 Cal
ifornia in back-to-back games.
Sophomore forward Jayne Appel high
lighted the importance of the encounter
with the Wildcats as the team hopes to
keep its momentum going into the stretch
run of the regular season.
"I think [the key is) setting up our own
game going into the Pac-10 Tournament
and going into the Cal game," she said. "It's
really important that we get it going this
weekend."
Stanford (22-3, 11-2 Pac-10) also has
eyes on the fact that the desert teams' ar
rival marks the last regular season home
games for senior guards Cissy Pierce and
Candice Wiggins. Sophomore J.J. Hones
said that this adds another dimension to
the team's focus.
"I think Thursday starts a very impor
tant weekend because it is senior night
[Saturday's game vs. Arizona State] and
Candice and Cissy's last home league
games," she said.
However, she added that this did not
detract from the intensity with which Stan

ford prepared for Arizona (9-14,3-9 Pac
-10).
"Arizona has been doing well," Hones
said. "They've kept it close in recent
games. They just played Arizona State to a
3-point game, and we only beat Arizona
State by 4, so they're going to come in
looking for the upset."
The Cardinal,though, will not yield eas-

GAME NOUS: The No. 6 Cardinal prepares for its
last home stand of the season against the Arizona
schools. Stanford has won a season-best 10
games in a row and is one game behind rival Cal

time series with the Wildcats, 46-12. Stanford sen

ily. In the Jan. 17 meeting, Stanford
beat the 'Cats 89-64. Senior guard
Ashley Whisonant powered Ari
zona's offense with 17 points. She
ranks behind only Wiggins in con
ference scoring with 16.3 ppg and
will be the primary focus of the Car
dinal backcourt defenders.
"The posts will be an advantage
if Whisonant gets to the basket,"
Hones said. "Jayne [Appel] is an
amazing shot blocker, Kayla [Ped
ersen] can block shots and Morgan
[Clyburn] can come in as an equally
great shot-blocker. So 1 feel like our
posts will help as a second line of de
fense in taking care of [Whiso
nant]."
This doesn't mean that the for
wards don't have their own respon
sibilities. Arizona has more height
inside than many of the Cardinal's
recent opponents, especially with
forward Amina Njonkou averaging
13.5 points and 7.2 boards. Njonkou
is joined by freshman forward lfy
Ibekwe, who adds 7.9 rebounds per
game.
Appel. though, is not concerned
about being unprepared. She
praised the high quality scouting by
the coaching staff, adding that a win
would come as long as Stanford fol
lowed its game plan.
"Our scouting should be good,
especially [since it's] the second
time around," Appel said. "We'll be
ready. We're going to try to contain
Amina and know exactly what she
does. [The forwards] will also have
to stay out of foul trouble, especially
[in regards to] Whisonant. If
[Whisonant] does beat our perime
ter defense, then we'll be there to
have their back."
Stanford's bigs will have to man
age the inside effort without key
contributor Jillian Harmon. Har
mon started 18 games, carrying an
average of 7.6 points and 5.8 re
bounds a game, before being side
lined for at least four weeks with a
stress reaction in her right foot. The
Cardinal's depth was a huge factor
in the last Arizona game, as Stan
ford's bench outscored that of the
Wildcats, 23-10. Appel said that
Harmon's absence will serve to en
courage other members of the Car
dinal squad to step in to and make
up the difference.
