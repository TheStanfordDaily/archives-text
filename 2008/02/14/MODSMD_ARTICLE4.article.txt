## No. 6 Card closes out home schedule 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
With only five games remaining in the
regular season, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team kicks off its final
home stand tonight at 7 p.m. when it faces
the University of Arizona. The Cardinal
looks to extend its 10-game winning streak

the team's focus.
"I think Thursday starts a very impor

[Saturday's game vs. Arizona State] and
Candice and Cissy's last home league
games," she said.
However, she added that this did not
detract from the intensity with which Stan

ford prepared for Arizona (9-14,3-9 Pac
-10).
"Arizona has been doing well," Hones
said. "They've kept it close in recent
games. They just played Arizona State to a
3-point game, and we only beat Arizona
State by 4, so they're going to come in
looking for the upset."
The Cardinal,though, will not yield eas-
