GAME NOTES: No. 13 Stanford stayed perfect
last night with an 8-0 win over St. Mary's.
The game was called after five innings, as
Stanford had back-to-back four run innings
in the 3rd and 4th. The Cardinal was led by
Tricia Aggabao, who was 2-3 with 2 runs
scored and an RBI. Senior Missy Penna
pitched four shutout innings and has yet to
allow a hit this season. The Cardinal host the
Stanford Invitational this weekend, opening
play against Santa Clara on Friday
Gaels committed an error in the out
field. Freshman Melisa Koutz
capped off Stanford's scoring effort
with a sacrifice fly. solidifying the
Cardinals 4-0 lead.
Senior second baseman Trieia
Aggabao. who went 2-3 on the game,
was pleased with the team's fifth
straight victory to begin the season.
"We're feeling great," Aggabao
said. "It's the start of the season, and
it feels good to get started with the
right foot forward .. It's exciting to
see everyone playing well right now,
especially at the start of our season."
Penna, winning her fourth game
of the year, did not give up a hit in
four innings of work.The junior was
named National Player of the Week
by USA Softball for her perform
ance at the San Diego Tournament,
where she tossed three shutouts and
threw a no-hitter against host Uni
versity of San Diego. Despite the ac
colades according with her hot start
to the season, Penna could not help
her humble nature.
"Every game our goal is to win so
I'm going to try to do my part as a
pitcher." she said after Wednesday's
win. "1 just go out there and try to do
my job. If they score or they don't
score, as long as we score more than
they do, I'm happy with the win."
When asked about her scoreless
innings streak — Penna has now
pitched 25 innings this season with
out allowing a run — the junior did
not buy into any of the hype.
'it'll happen," Penna said of the
ending of her streak. "It's in
evitable."
Freshman Ashley Chinn relieved

Penna for the final inning of the
game, giving up a hit and throwing a
walk before securing the 8-0 victory
for the Cardinal.
I"he pitching of Penna and Chinn
has carried the team so far in the
early season; after its first five
games, Stanford has given up exactly
one run. And although the team fig
ures to see stronger competition
from opposing batters in the future,
it is hard not to notice the work of
the Cardinal pitchers so far.
"Our whole pitching staff has
been working hard the entire season
and Missy | Penna] definitely puts the
time in. throws the ball really well
and is hitting her spots," Aggabao
said. "She's definitely been leading
us from the circle this season."
Yesterday's win was an offensive
explosion of sorts for Stanford, who
averaged less than three runs a game
in its opening weekend of play.
"I think everybody had a plan be
fore we got into the box; we picked
up the pitchers' tendencies and we
all had a plan before we stepped foot
in the box and it definitely helped us
in our offense attack," Aggabao
added.
With five wins under its belt, the
Cardinal now prepares to host the
Stanford Invitational. The team is
slated to play several games over the
weekend, with upcoming matches
scheduled against Santa Clara, Wi
chita State and Pacific. The tourna
ment begins tomorrow and will run
through Sunday.
