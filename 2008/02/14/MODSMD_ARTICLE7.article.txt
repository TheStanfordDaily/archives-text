### ANI)REA SY EMMA TROT TER 
It 's Valentine's Day, and students are
spreading the love all across cam
pus. Student groups have planned a
number of creative activities to
help students — even those with
out a special someone — to cele-

brate.
Mariachi Cardenal, Stanford's Mariachi en
semble. will perform "serenatas," or romantic
Valentine's Day serenades. For $40, Mariachi

Cardenal will sing three songs to the apple of your
eye — be it your significant other. Teaching Assis
tant. professor or entire dorm.

Hie group boasts a repertoire of over 30 songs but is
open to any requests that clients may have.
"Mariachi Cardenal really goes out of its way to make sure
each and every serenade is unique and memorable," said
Severo Guardado Jr. '09. "At the end of the day. we are very
tired and usually hungry. However, the bonding experience for
the group and the good vibes we put into the community is well
worth the worn hands and aching feet."
Madalyn Radlauer '08. a four-year member of the a capella
group Side by Side, expressed similar sentiments during the
performance of one of their signature Lovegrams.
"We have an amazing time singing to people," she said.
"People are really pleased."
Side by Side sings tunes from the 1920s to the 19605, includ
ing "' lil There Was You" and "Can't Help Falling In Love."
Customers could book half hour slots for $20 on the days lead
ing up to Valentine's Day.and today serenades went for $25 and
included delivery of a rose. Time slots are fully booked for the
day. Lovegrams are Side by Side's only fundraiser.

Models from Stanford's Charity Fashion Show (CFS) have
been selling red roses as a fundraiser for Medecins Sans Fron
tieres (Doctors Without Borders).The roses — to be delivered
by the CFS models themselves — arrived last night.
"When the roses got here, we started joking around that
they were only red because we pricked ourselves so many times
putting together the bouquets," said CFS member Lleyana Jack
'10.
The group originally set a goal of 600 roses, but the members
oversold, managing to raise over $2,600 for their cause.
"CFS blood literally went into every rose," Jack said.
The Greek community also joined in the festivities.
Last night, Chi Omega sorority girls showered campus with
love — and chalk. Students awoke this morning to discover
hearts and messages like "XO loves you." Written out, Chi O's
letters look like X's and O's — making this sorority Cupid's
best friend.
"We know that a lot of people out there don't have a spe
cial someone, but we want to show campus that Valentine's
Day isn't just for the lovers, it's for the friends too." said D.P.
Grewal '09.
Chi O's looked forward to spreading holiday cheer.
"The best part is seeing people's reactions the next day,"
said sister Julie Byren '08. "Last year it rained, so nobody even
saw it."
Sigma Chi fraternity and Kappa Alpha Theta sorority con
tinued their annual tradition of selling Crushgrams.
"It was just fun to get out there, trying to get people to send
a nice Valentine's Day message," said Alex Hoopai '10."It's for
a good cause."
