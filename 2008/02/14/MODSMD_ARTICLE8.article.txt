# Down with love?

### SALMAN RAZZAQUI 
S Students across the nation
are turning their backs on
Valentine's Day. According
to "College crowd: Ho-huni
to V-day," a recent article in
the Chicago-area newspaper
Pioneer Local, romance has become a
persona non grata on college campuses.
"1 have no plans and I'm hoping my
boyfriend doesn't come up with any,"
Colleen Kron, a senior at Northwestern,
told the Pioneer.
But has this viewpoint taken root on
our beloved Farm?
"I wouldn't say Valentine's Day is
dying at Stanford; however, 1 believe there
has been a shift towards Valentine's Day
also being a "singles' awareness day'," said
Jamie Marincola "08.
Others defended the holiday, con
demning the attacks on Valentine's Day
from single people.
"Because Valentine's Day is obviously
a holiday for couples, it makes perfect
sense that single students would be the
ones to criticize it," said Kelly Louise Bon
ney-Ache'll.
Still, however, students admitted that
the celebration has several downsides.
"I think that Valentine's Day can be
very special; however, 1 think it can also
get very tacky," said Andrea Freund '11.
"For that reason, some college students

have negative views about the holiday."
Others pointed to the commercializa
tion of the holiday.
"I think that the ideas of cupid and love
are waning and being replaced with fes
tive red and pink candy and construction
paper hearts with lace," Marincola said.
Not surprisingly, grad students were
unaffected.
"The graduate school dating scene
ranges from the uneventfully single to dis
passionately attached. So I don't think
that Valentine's Day will create a ripple
for them," said Kai Stinchcombe Ph.D.
'05, a Daily columnist.
In spite of these scattered complaints,
diehard Valentine's Day fans can still be
found gearing up for the highlight of their
year.
Bonney-Ache orchestrated a scav
enger hunt that started on the first of the
month.
"It's the first time I've had a boyfriend
for Valentine's Day, so I went all out," she
said.
Others like Marincola plan on cele
brating in a more traditional manner.
"Valentine's Day falls four days before
my anniversary with my girlfriend, so we
tend to downplay Valentine's Day in lieu
of a more romantic anniversary day. How
ever, there are still some surprises in the
works," Marincola said.
Comparative Literature Professor

Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, a lecturer in
"Sex: Its Pleasures and Cultures," has
given his students the day off.
"This year I changed a class from
Valentine's Day to the day before, to
honor Valentine's Day and go out with my
wife. I admit this may be an attitude typi
cal of what a 59-year-old like myself finds
romantic, but none of the students and
colleagues in the class protested," he said.
"So much for the trend."
