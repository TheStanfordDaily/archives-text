## "Tour d'America" comes to Stanford Palo Alto to host "prologue" to major cycling competition 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford community knows a thing
or two about reckless bikers, hut this Sunday
daring feats of cycling speed will be on dis
play en masse.
The Amgen Tour of California, one of the
most prestigious cycling events in America,
will kick off Feb. 17 in Palo Alto. During the
local race, which is the tour's "prologue,"
cyclists will compete in a 2.1 mile time-trial
course before racing in the tour's main
seven stages. Teams of cyclists from around
the world will be participating, including
many who have raced or will race in the
Tour de France.
Participants will race from Bryant Street
in Palo Alto down University Avenue, con
tinue onto Palm Drive and circle the Oval
near the quad before stopping at the inter
section of Palm Drive and Museum Way. A
new rider will set out from the starting point
every minute, and organizers estimate that it

will take around five minutes for each rider
to complete the course.
The section of Palm Drive from the inter
section with Campus Drive to the circle
around the Oval will be closed to traffic from
7 a.m. Saturday to 10 p.m. Sunday. The sec
tion of Palm Drive from Campus Drive to El
Camino will be closed only on Sunday from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
"For all intents and purposes, this is the
Tour d'America," said Frank Scioscia, a
development officer who helped organize
Palo Alto's participation. "We'll have all
those incredible athletes on our campus, and
the only fee is standing on the side of the
road. It's really exciting."
"It's a chance to see the top athletes in the
world, in our sport, compete on the campus
where we ride every day," added Evan
Pickett, a graduate student in Materials
Science and Engineering. "In cycling,
American pro teams are essentially the
minor leagues. Normally, the only chance
you'd get to see competition like this is at a
huge European event, like the Tour de
France, the Giro d'ltalia or a spring classics
race like Paris-Roubaix."
The event will bring competitors from
across the world, along with top American

cyclists.
"When you go. you might he hearing all
sorts of languages—Dutch. Italian, French.
English — all spoken within earshot," Scioscia
said. "It will really be an international event."
Event organizers also hope the cycling will
raise awareness about green living.
"After the Tour de France Prologue in
London last summer, bike commuting
jumped 11 percent." Pickett said. "And that's
in rainy England. A tiny push can make a big
difference in the minds of a lot of people, if
it's applied in the right way."
Student cyclists are already geared up for
the event.
"It's not every day that you get to see
world class cyclist racing on campus," said
Stanford Cycling Club Race Director Todd
Norwood '08. "Being able to walk down to
the Oval and watch them race is a really
amazing opportunity."
"I'm definitely going to watch the open
ing stage," added Jake Allen' 1 l."Who would
pass up such an amazing opportunity? It's
like hosting the Final Four NCAA basket
ball game in your home court."
