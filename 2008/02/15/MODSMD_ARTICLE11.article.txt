## County rejects walking trail San Mateo Supervisors deliver verdict on University's proposal 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
The San Mateo Board of Supervisors voted on
Tuesday to reject Stanford's proposal for the con
struction of a walking trail through part of San Mateo
County.
The controversial debate over whether the
Stanford trail would be built has continued for near
ly eight years now, beginning with the University's
commitment to construct two trails, designated CI
and SI, following a land development agreement
with Santa Clara County in 2000. Both trails extend
through areas within and beyond the confines of
Stanford land.
San Mateo Supervisor Richard Gordon, one of
the five members of the board who voted on the deci
sion, said that there were a number of factors that
influenced the rejection of the proposal.
"Safety was our primary concern," he said."ln that
area, there's a fairly narrow corridor in certain places,
and there is not a lot of room to put a trail that has
enough buffer from the highway. Hie path is really
right on the road, and this is a very busy road."
In addition. Gordon said that residents of San
Mateo County, especially in a neighborhood called
Weekend Acres, were especially concerned that the
construction of the trail would run through their
backyard, impinging on privacy.
"The area we have to construct is too close, from
our perspective, to people's homes," he said. "The
trail would be in an area where the people's back
yards and homes are below road level, so if you walk
on what would be a trail on road level, you're looking
right into people's backyard, [which generates] some
concern about the impact to people's privacy."
Another part of the decision made by the board
on Tuesday was a recommendation to the LJniversity
and Santa Clara County, regarding what to do with
the $84.1 million originally allotted for the construc
tion of the trail.
"We have made a suggestion to them to consider
some kind of regional grant program," Gordon said.
"The money might then go to the city of Palo Alto or
The Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, but
this is only a suggestion from us; we didn't tell them
what to do. We'd be happy to discuss our idea."
But the University has not agreed to consider this
plan.
Stanford Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry Horton said that,
according to the first General Use Permit, if the coun
ties surrounding Stanford did not agree to accept the
money for the trail, then the money would in some
other way go back to increasing recreational activities
for members of the Stanford community.
Horton said that he respected San Mateo
County's right to make the ultimate decision, but also
claimed that he would need to make them virtually
the same offer every year until the end of 2011, at
which time the money would be allocated for some
other purpose.
"Fundamentally, the long run use of our land is for
the benefit of the University." he said. "But we will
still try to be good neighbors and community spirited.
But ultimately, this land up here, all this land is for the
intended support of this university, education, knowl
edge and things we do here."
Gordon said that the trail issue has caused some
tension between the inhabitants of San Mateo
County and the University.
"Back in 2006, we held a public hearing, and some
thing like 70 people showed up to speak." he said.
"Only four of them spoke in favor of Stanford's pro
posal around the trail, and they all. as part of their
comments, disclosed that they work for Stanford. The
other folks who spoke that day were not very kind to
Stanford. 1 do believe that this has created some ill
will toward Stanford in the local community
Gordon said that this was one ol the reasons that
he recommended Larry Horton release the money
instead of waiting for the 2011 deadline.
"I understand Larry Horton's stance, but I believe
Stanford ought to release the money, get this over
with and move on," he said. "I think that would actu
ally do a lot in terms of improving the relationship
that has been strained between some members of the
community and Stanford."
