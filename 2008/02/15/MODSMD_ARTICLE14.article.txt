Photographers may now he able to
do more than print their work: they can
instantly turn it into navigable virtual 3-
O worlds. Stanford computer scientists
have come a step closer to realizing this
goal through the development of an
algorithm that can render accurate
three-dimensional models from ordi
nary photographs.
ITie Make3d algorithm, developed
by Computer Science Prof. Andrew Ng
and postdoctoral student Ashutosh
Saxena. uses data from a large set of
carefully analyzed images taken from
all across campus to relate the relative
depth of objects in various circum
stances to properties of the two-dimen
sional image, ITiis depth data is then
used to extrapolate the relative posi
tions and shapes of objects in new pho
tographs introduced to the algorithm.
"We also applied
it in robotic
grasping."

"If you look at a single image you
will notice that some parts of the
image relate to the depth — for
example, the sky is usually far away,"
Saxena said. "The machine learning
algorithm, which is a branch of arti
ficial intelligence, learns the rela
tions, so it learns the relation
between the image and the depth or
/ the 3-D structure."
According to Ng, the concept was
traditionally considered as a techni
cal impossibility until recently
because of the difficulties in differ
entiating two-dimensional and
three-dimensional objects.
"There are many cues that you
and 1 are very good at combining to
, estimate distances, and our software
learns to use similar cues from data."
Ng said. "After the learning process
( is completed, we then show it a new
picture and it estimates the distance
from every object in the scene."
Both Ng and Saxena acknowl
•' edged the commercial possibilities
for the algorithm. Currently there
aie hopes that it will be used to
improve object detection for com
'X) plicated structures like faces or mov
ing objects. Saxena noted that rapid
construction of virtual worlds and
( characters for video games is one of
many possibilities to which the tech
nology can be applied. The algo
rithm has already been extensively
applied in identification of objects in
robotics.
"There was a little RC car that
- we designed which had a single cam
era that took an image to find out
where it should go and drove at
faster speeds, like five meters per
second, for a long time without hit
ting obstacles," Saxena said. "We
also applied it in robotic grasping
work because to grasp something
you need to understand the 3-D
structure of the problem, for exam
ple the unloading of a dishwasher."
Though the technology has been
applied in robotics, there are still
many obstacles in perfecting its 3-D
rendering capabilities. Currently, the
algorithm does not construct accu
rate 3-D models of small objects and
has a tendency to create undesirable
distortions when rendering faces
and bodies. There are currently a
number of plans being implemented
to improve the accuracy of the 3-D

models.
"We will allow users to spend five
to ten seconds on an image and help
the algorithm out and create the 3-D
models in the way that they desire,"
Saxena said. "We also are planning
to address 3-D reconstructions of
objects."
Ng noted that future applications
of the algorithm may include accu
rate modeling of houses for the real
estate industry and modeling fly
through views for applications like
Google Karth. Ng even suggested
the possibility applying the applica
tion to personal photos.
