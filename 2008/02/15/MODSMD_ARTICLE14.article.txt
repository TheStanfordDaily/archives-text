Photographers may now he able to
do more than print their work: they can
instantly turn it into navigable virtual 3-
O worlds. Stanford computer scientists
have come a step closer to realizing this
goal through the development of an
algorithm that can render accurate
three-dimensional models from ordi
nary photographs.
ITie Make3d algorithm, developed
by Computer Science Prof. Andrew Ng
and postdoctoral student Ashutosh
Saxena. uses data from a large set of
carefully analyzed images taken from
all across campus to relate the relative
depth of objects in various circum
stances to properties of the two-dimen
sional image, ITiis depth data is then
used to extrapolate the relative posi
tions and shapes of objects in new pho
tographs introduced to the algorithm.
