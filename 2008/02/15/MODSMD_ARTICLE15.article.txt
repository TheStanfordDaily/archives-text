## Editorial Board Silencing speakers 
### 
Anyone recognize a pattern? Some
one at Stanford invites a speaker to
talk.The speaker, however, happens
lo be a particularly controversial figure, with
views that offend certain groups on campus.
A petition is raised. Thousands sign it. A
petition is raised against that petition. Thou
sands sign that one, too. People write op-eds
for or against the speaker.
Eventually, the speaker comes, maybe
some people protest and, after a couple
weeks, people forget about it.
We went through this process when for
mer Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
was appointed as a Hoover Institution dis
tinguished visiting fellow, and it came up
again with the presence of Basque President
Juan Jose Ibarretxe and gay pornography
star Michael Lucas on campus yesterday.
Ibis is not constructive,and it is time that we
reevaluate how we look at controversial
speakers who come to campus.
Here is one truth that will not change:
people have a right to speak their mind. We
must remind ourselves that there is a reason
that freedom of speech is enshrined in the
very first amendment of the U.S. Constitu
tion. Moreover, one of Stanford's roles is to
act as a forum for dialogue, and such dia
logue requires argument, discussion and
hopefully consensus, all of which depend on
the freedom of speech.
If Stanford enters the ethical morass of
choosing what sort of freedom of speech is
acceptable and what is not. we will bury our
selves in that arrogance. If we begin to refuse
speakers simply because we disagree with
them, we lose our validity as a forum of de
batable thought. We applaud President
I lennessy's office, which has declared, in ref
erence to Ibarretxe's talk, that "President
Hennessy's analysis and personal opinion ..
. [do] not have a bearing on this invitation."
Tliat is absolutely the way it should be.
That being said, we understand the griev
ances raised by offended groups at Stanford.
Lucas, for example, has publicly expressed
his disdain for Islam, and many students are
perturbed that the University will be provid
ing someone who splashes vitriol on their
way of life a megaphone to broadcast his

views. This is completely understandable.
As was stated above, we believe that
Lucas must be allowed to speak freely. The
first amendment, however, goes both ways.
While an individual like Lucas has the right
to speak his mind, his audience has the equal
right to completely disregard what he says
and to fervently oppose his opinions.
This is precisely the reason why Stanford
brings speakers to campus â€” to increase de
bate and discussion campus-wide. Protests
against individuals or speakers like Rums
feld. Ibarretxe and Lucas should not. there
fore. demand that an individual's invitation
to speak be retracted. Instead, protests
should be focused on that individual's views.
We must critically look at a speaker's stated
positions and goals. We must craft a rational
argument, fueled by passion, to show where
we agree and disagree.
This is the intention of free speech: to pro
vide a basis for discussion and constructive
argument. If we refuse to hear someone out.
we have no basis for arguing back. We may
even be assuming something incorrect about
that person's views. You can never know
until you listen or talk to them. This is why
the pledges by petitioners to boycott contro
versial speakers is so counterproductive. In
the end, even if one person's opinion is com
pletely irreconcilable with a second person's,
at least each will have learned a little more
about the basis for the other's beliefs.
One dorm list uses as part of its template
email,"l think that we should discuss every
thing, all the time, as often and as vehement
ly as possible." It's a good motto to live by. as
long as those discussions stem from facts and
not falsehoods made up in the moment of
passion.
The bottom line: let's no longer debate
whether or not speakers should be allowed
to speak on campus. Instead, let's debate the
actual policies and opinions of these speak
ers. Let's actually attend their talks, and let's
go prepared. If even one Stanford student
goes ready and willing to intelligently chal
lenge a speaker's views, it will have a positive
impact on the level and style of debate and
hopefully will educate everyone involved,
from speaker to faculty to students.
