## Crashing, a guilty pleasure 
### 
Crashing, "the act of joining or entering
without invitation," is a long estab
lished tradition among all species of
the world. Humans crash parties, lions crash
gazelle socials and ants crash our houses. In
deed. humans would have never evolved as
a species if our sea-dwelling ancestors didn't
crash dry land. Crashing evokes a mixture of
emotions, ranging from fulfillment and glee
to guilt and nervousness. There are also a
wide range of outcomes from crashing: ac
quiring free food and other items, being es
corted out of an event or getting shot to
death, which actually happened to one un
lucky fellow in NYC. Hie risk involved in
crashing is what gives it its thrill.
Crashing is an inherently obtrusive
event, so to make it acceptable, one has to be
a considerate crasher. The acceptability of
crashing is determined by the balance of two
criteria: the burden placed on others versus
the benefit you derive. For example,jumping
into someone's funeral reception — and
taking the dead man's shoes — would be un
acceptable. But sometimes crashing can
bring you such pleasure, you end up feeling
it would be wrong NO T to crash
There are many events, however, which
are acceptable for crashing, such as events
that offer free food. Since such events hap
pen quite often at Stanford, it would be per
tinent to take a closer look into crashing
these situations. It's perfect — you can get
great pleasure from getting free food, it's
usually harmless to help yourself to it, the ac
cess is easy and the risk of getting caught is
minimal. By default. I crash almost every free
food event I come across. In fact, I feel like
we have an obligation to crash these events.
We were hunter-gatherers not too long ago,
and it would be a dishonor to our ancestors if
we didn't take advantage of every free food
opportunity It is also good to note that this
food often ends up in a dumpster.
For some, crashing is a way of life. I have
a good friend, let's call him "Gary Davis,"
who has pulled off some amazing crashing.
After having had his wallet stolen in Paris,
Gary was glumly walking around until he
came across an absolutely luxurious hotel,
matching the splendor of Versailles True to
his crashing instincts. Gary immediately
began to explore (he hotel. At one point he
was upstairs checking out a hallway when he

came across a security guard. Employing his
smooth, crashing skills. Gary asked the
guard where he could find the fitness center.
The guard asked Gary to follow him into
a private security elevator, and as they de
scended to the lowest floor. Gary nervously
thought the worst, wondering if he was being
taken to an interrogation room. Instead, the
scene that unfolded was surreal — the ele
vator opened into a long, misty (yes. misty)
hallway with vaulted ceilings, the end of
which contained a gorgeous woman sitting
at a desk. She asked for Gary's room num
ber, and having memorized an actual room
number, Gary seamlessly passed off as a
guest.The woman then led him along an in
door river, which eventually emptied into an
unbelievably lavish pool, surrounded by
statues, murals and attending servants.
Previously, Gary had been reduced to
washing his clothes in the shower of Paris's
most decrepit hotel. Now, he was being of
fered hors d'oeuvres. champagne, massages
and towelettes dipped in cologne. Gary
brazenly returned the next day.and. having
made friends with all of the staff, he was wel
comed with a smile.
Gary is one who turns crashing into an
art. He demonstrates the considerateness
and the confidence of a good crasher. Not
only is he unobtrusive, he is appreciated.
And this demonstrates one of the lovely ef
fects of crashing — by the fact that you are
uninvited, you can unexpectedly mix things
up in a positive way.
Crashing is like eating chocolate — a
slight bit of remorse offset by a lot of pleas
ure. You, too, can experience the joys of
crashing. Just don't feel out of place, don't be
an asshole and don't get shot.
