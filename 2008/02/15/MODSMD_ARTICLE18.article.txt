These are the sounds of sports photog
raphy. They are raw passion, embod
ied in eloquent onomatopoeia. Iliey
represent pure competitive oomph, the si
multaneous strain of all the muscles of the
human body, including the ones that look
stupid when you strain them.
Sports photography, you have long been
the underdog. You remind me that we're all
ridiculous. Some of us realize it, and some of
us don't. But either way, rob a man of his self
conscious identity preservation, and he's
nothing more than a funny-looking mound of
flesh and bones with his mouth wide open.
Today, sports photography, you assume your
rightful place as an artistic medium, not just a
vehicle for ever-more-absurd faces to grace
the front pages of our morning newspapers.
I should note here that I am in noway be
littling the admirable power of athletes. I
stand in awe of athletes and their physical
prowess. My love of sports photography
does not hinge on some prejudiced idea that

athletes are stupid. This is clearly not true,
least of all at Stanford. Nor am I saying that
athletes are unattractive. This is even more
obviously not true. Instead, I love this under
appreciated art because it gives a window
into a side of human nature not often wit
nessed. least of all from the point of view of
a camera lens.
Ordinarily, a photographer for a given
publication will carefully comb through a set
of pictures he has taken, weeding out those
that are unbecoming. With sports photogra
phers, however, based on the pictures we see
every day in the newspaper, it seems the op
posite may be the case.
This is raw. uncensored photography.
Sports photography represents the death of
the voluntary photo op. This is the farthest
possible cry from the photobooth in the

mall. Take away the girlish cutesy peace
signs and the masculine sense of smug satis
faction. What is important now is not the
person, per se, hut the act. The slam dunk is
supposed to be what I'm looking at. not the
guy below the hoop with his eyes popping
out and his "it kind of looks like I've got a
gumball in my mouth" cheeks.
Accidentally closed eyes, bitten lips, im
passioned teeth clenching. These are the sta
ples of the rough-and-ready sports photog
rapher diet, which is of course supplemented
by Wheaties brand breakfast cereal â€” the
breakfast of champions.
In the interest of capturing "the mo
ment," any and all other significant features
of photography fall to the wayside. A photo
may very well manage to capture that short
two-second interlude between the rise of the
golf club and the contact with the ball. The
sun may very well be shining at just the right
angle, illuminating the white ball and all of
its contours. The bottom line, however, is
that none of this can hide the fact that the
golfer herself looks a little bit like an oompa
loompa who is currently experiencing brain
hemorrhaging.
