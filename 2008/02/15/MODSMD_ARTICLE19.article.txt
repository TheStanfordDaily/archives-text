## Racism and intolerance: disappointing at a liberal university 
### 
Let me first address the "racism" remarks
and the accusation of me being "racist"
("Adult film star's remarks spark de
bate," Feb. 14]. I was disappointed (but not
very surprised) by the reaction that I got from
some of the students at Stanford (as I've been
wrongly accused of racism before).
Speaking of racism in relation to religion, not
to a race, is a big disservice to language and to in
telligence. I never in my life said or wrote a bad
word about Arabs — go read any of my articles.
My criticism was always addressed towards the
religion and ideology of Islam. So I would like to
ask Stanford students not to exploit the word

'racism' at their own convenience. It's shocking
to me that some students do not know what that
term means hut handle it with such wanton im
pudence. Maybe such a hole in the education
should be brought to the attention of the teach
ing faculty of your university.
In fact, some of my role models are Arabs
for whom I have tremendous admiration. I'm
talking about the likes of Wafa Sultan, who has
confronted and condemned Islam on many oc
casions and for whose lectures I will travel
across the country, and Ayaan Hirsi AN, whose
book "Infidel" also helped me to shape my
opinions. Both of these women secularized, as

Islam in their opinion is the ideology of back
wardness and hate. They rightly point out that
Islam hasn't changed, or evolved, for 1,400
years; it has always suppressed every progres
sive thought. Needless to say, these women
were forced to live in exile in the United States
and live with hired security 24 hours a day. As I
hope you know, Islam does not forgive. It for
bids any criticism. Think Salman Rushdie.
Hiink rheo Van Gogh, for his portrayal of the
misery of women in Muslim countries.Think of
the Danish cartoonists who are hiding in safe
houses. The list is long.
What fostered my distain for
Islam? TTie contempt that Muslim
men vomit on women, treating them
with less respect than camels.That in
cludes the infibulation — female cir
cumcision — of young girls; the impo
sition of chadors and burqas; the de
capitation of adulterous wives (but
never adulterous husbands); the fact
that, in most Muslim countries,
women cannot go to school,see a doc
tor or even leave their own houses
without a male escort; the approval of
polygamy; the arranged marriages
that involve girls as young as the
barring of women from taking part in
public life or in any receptions, even
those of their own weddings; the
death penalty for drinkers of alcohol;
the mutilation penalty for thieves; the
public killings of homosexuals. Does
n't all of this originate from the
Koran? Have you ever thought that,
instead of protesting me, you should
protest against those atrocities,maybe
organizing some short demonstration
in front of Muslim embassies? Why
instead are you unleashing your hate
against one who speaks against those
crimes? Why are you denying my
right to compare the Koran, the text in
which these facts originate, to 1 litler's
"Mcin Kampf?" The Koran, that for
1.4(H) years has tormented humanity
more than the Bible, the Gospels and

theTorah combined? Do not suppress
or boycott someone who has a differ
ent opinion, even if you disagree with
this opinion. Debate it. Argue it In a
civilized manner. Otherwise, what is
the difference between you and
Islam?
I do very well realize where this re
action is coming from. Stanford is a
liberal university, and 1 very much
hope that the good word "liberalism"
is not degraded in your institution as it
has been degraded by the likes of
Michael Moore, Rosie O'Donnell,
Ward Churchill, Noam Chomsky and
many others. 1 hope the word "liberal"
in the mind of Stanford students still
means "progressive" and "broad
minded." The left symbolizes
progress. At least, it has done so in the
past. It has always stood for women's
rights, for gay rights, for the rights of
African-Americans. The reaction
which 1 see today at Stanford demon
strates to me that there are changes in
the left and that these changes are for
the worst. What I read today in The
Stanford Daily is nothing more than
intellectual terrorism. A dogmatism
that I can only compare to one of reli
gion. (lf-you-don't-think-what-1-
think.-you-are-an-idiot-and-a-delin
quent.) It's difficult for me to under
stand how the progressive left can de
fend the most backwards and reac
tionary ideology on earth, the ideolo
gy of Islam.
