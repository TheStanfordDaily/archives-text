## Racism and intolerance: disappointing at a liberal university 
### 
Let me first address the "racism" remarks
and the accusation of me being "racist"
("Adult film star's remarks spark de
bate," Feb. 14]. I was disappointed (but not
very surprised) by the reaction that I got from
some of the students at Stanford (as I've been
wrongly accused of racism before).
Speaking of racism in relation to religion, not
to a race, is a big disservice to language and to in
telligence. I never in my life said or wrote a bad
word about Arabs â€” go read any of my articles.
My criticism was always addressed towards the
religion and ideology of Islam. So I would like to
ask Stanford students not to exploit the word

'racism' at their own convenience. It's shocking
to me that some students do not know what that
term means hut handle it with such wanton im
pudence. Maybe such a hole in the education
should be brought to the attention of the teach
ing faculty of your university.
In fact, some of my role models are Arabs
for whom I have tremendous admiration. I'm
talking about the likes of Wafa Sultan, who has
confronted and condemned Islam on many oc
casions and for whose lectures I will travel
across the country, and Ayaan Hirsi AN, whose
book "Infidel" also helped me to shape my
opinions. Both of these women secularized, as

Islam in their opinion is the ideology of back
wardness and hate. They rightly point out that
Islam hasn't changed, or evolved, for 1,400
years; it has always suppressed every progres
sive thought. Needless to say, these women
were forced to live in exile in the United States
and live with hired security 24 hours a day. As I
hope you know, Islam does not forgive. It for
bids any criticism. Think Salman Rushdie.
