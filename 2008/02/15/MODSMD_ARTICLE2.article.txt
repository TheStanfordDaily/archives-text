# Basque president speaks to students
## Ibarretxe's campus visit sparks less conflict than expected 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After weeks of controversy surrounding the
campus visit of the elected president of Spain's
regional Basque government, yesterday's event
occurred without any major conflict.
Approximately ten protesters gathered out
side the Arrillaga Alumni Center to demon
strate against the visit of Juan Jose Ibarretxe.
Not all protesters were Stanford students —

some worked in Silicon Valley or came from
other universities including UC-Berkeley. They
displayed a banner that stated, "ETA Kills,
Ibarretxe Deals," suggesting that Ibarretxe has
connections with the terrorist organization
Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).
The Basque Government president arrived at
the Alumni Center from a side entrance, so the
protesters were unable to convey their message
to the leader directly.
Prof. Joan Ramon Resina, the chair of the
Spanish and Portuguese Departments, told the
audience that the event had been long in the
making, and he thanked the Forum on
Contemporary Europe, the Freeman Spogli
Institute and the Office of the President for "not
giving in" to the protesters. This statement was
echoed by general applause from the audience.
Resina described ibarretxe's plan as daring,
provocative and uncertain, but did not say that
he agreed with the ideology.
"Inviting Ibarretxe does not mean that we
endorse his road map or political vision," he
said. "We are here to listen to his message."
Ibarretxe broke his lecture into two parts —
the history and identity of the people from the
mountainous region of northern Spain and his
hotly debated proposal for a referendum on the
independence of the region.
The president began his speech in English,
explaining how the Basque people had success-
