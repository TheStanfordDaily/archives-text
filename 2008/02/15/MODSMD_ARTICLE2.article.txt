# Basque president speaks to students
## Ibarretxe's campus visit sparks less conflict than expected 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After weeks of controversy surrounding the
campus visit of the elected president of Spain's
regional Basque government, yesterday's event
occurred without any major conflict.
Approximately ten protesters gathered out
side the Arrillaga Alumni Center to demon
strate against the visit of Juan Jose Ibarretxe.
Not all protesters were Stanford students —

some worked in Silicon Valley or came from
other universities including UC-Berkeley. They
displayed a banner that stated, "ETA Kills,
Ibarretxe Deals," suggesting that Ibarretxe has
connections with the terrorist organization
Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).
The Basque Government president arrived at
the Alumni Center from a side entrance, so the
protesters were unable to convey their message
to the leader directly.
Prof. Joan Ramon Resina, the chair of the
Spanish and Portuguese Departments, told the
audience that the event had been long in the
making, and he thanked the Forum on
Contemporary Europe, the Freeman Spogli
Institute and the Office of the President for "not
giving in" to the protesters. This statement was
echoed by general applause from the audience.
Resina described ibarretxe's plan as daring,
provocative and uncertain, but did not say that
he agreed with the ideology.
"Inviting Ibarretxe does not mean that we
endorse his road map or political vision," he
said. "We are here to listen to his message."
Ibarretxe broke his lecture into two parts —
the history and identity of the people from the
mountainous region of northern Spain and his
hotly debated proposal for a referendum on the
independence of the region.
The president began his speech in English,
explaining how the Basque people had success-

A group of demonstators gathered outside Arrillaga Alumni Center Thursday night to protest the arrival of Juan Jose Ibarretxe,
president of Spain's regional Basque government. The protesters included Stanford students, other college students and local workers.
fully overcome many difficulties
throughout history. He pointed out that,
as a result, he was optimistic about the
future.
"I face the future with the hope of
advancing a new horizon of sustainable
human development," Ibarretxe said. "[I
hope] to attain political normalization
and an agreement with Spain to put an
end to the long standing political con
flict."
He went on to describe the multifac
eted nature of Basque identity.
"We are a diverse people who love
self-government," he said. "The vast
majority of Basques demand a new
framework of negotiations with Spain."
Ibarretxe further referred to a recent
report, issued by the Basque statistics
agency EUSTAT, which ranked the
Basque country third in the Human
Development Index ratings for the most
"liveable" places, behind Iceland and
Norway.
The leader presented his plans on

how to end the long-standing regional
conflict. But he condemned the violent
methods of ETA, which, in his opinion,
need to cease immediately.
"Unfortunately, on too many occa
sions. the violence of the ETA hides the
goodness of the Basque people and con
ceals the political problems," he said.
"ETA does not represent the Basque
people."
The president, who outlined his pro
posals in detail, further pointed out that
the right to self-determination was the
key to the solution of the Basque politi
cal conflict.
"Sometimes the Spanish government
claims that such a right divides Basque
people, but the absolute majority of
Basques want to have the right of self
determination," he said.
Ibarretxe s plan to end the conflict
included an offer of political agreement
with the president of the Spanish gov
ernment and a referendum that aimed to
ratify the political negotiation process.
He also quoted Stanford's motto, "the
wind of freedom blows," as an example
of an institution that displays dignity and
respect to people, which is something he
aims to do.
After the leader finished speaking.

Resina read out questions from the
audience from a broad variety of topics,
including some prepared by the protest
ers in advance.
When asked about how the European
Union's infrastructure could help the
independence of the Basque country,
Ibarretxe responded to the question in
Spanish by stating that Europe's rebirth
of political organizations makes his peti
tion for independence fairly common.
"Flanders, Wallonia, Ireland, Scotland
and, closer to the U.S., Quebec are all
dealing with the issue of independence,"
he said. "Just recently, the Council of
Europe reminded states that people such
as the Basques have full rights to look
more closely at their own identities."
There was a brief interruption during
the question and answer session. When
Resina asked Ibarretxe about his opin
ion of members of the Basque Human
Rights Commission who were sentenced
ETA members, Ibarretxe denied knowl
edge of any members of the parliament
that had been convicted. A member of
the audience shouted out Josu Ternera's
name, but the president did not respond.
According to the Spanish newspaper "El
Mundo," Ternera is an individual who
has previously been a member of ETA

and subsequently served as a member of
the Basque Parliament.
Victor Gomez-Magana. a Spaniard
who works in Silicon Valley, did not
agree with Ibarretxe's perspective. He
provided the question that referred to
Ternera and felt that the president cir
cumvented some of the questions posed.
"He did not adequately answer the
questions." he said. "He knew perfectly
well that the question was about
Ternera, who is a top leader of ETA and
was on the Basque Parliament's
Commission for Human Rights until
2002. Furthermore, his talk was nothing
new — he has been promoting the same
message for the last 30 years. The audi
ence just accepted it because there was
no one to challenge his views."
Nonetheless, the majority of the audi
ence was receptive to Ibarretxe's mes
sage and some members even gave him a
standing ovation. Provost John
Etchemendy. Ph.D. '82 told The Daily
that he was pleased with the outcome of
the lecture.
"I think the lecture was wonderful."
he said. "Very persuasive."
