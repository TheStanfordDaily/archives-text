DEKALB. 111. — A former student
dressed in black walked onto the stage of a
lecture hall at Northern Illinois University
and opened fire on a packed science class
Thursday, killing five students, wounding 16
and setting off a panicked stampede before
committing suicide.
Police say they have no motive for the
rapid-fire assault, carried out by the gunman
who fired indiscriminately into the crowd
with a shotgun and two handguns as students
dove to the floor and ran toward the exits. At
least two of the wounded were hospitalized
in critical condition.

"I kept thinking. 'Oh God, he's going to
shoot me. Oh God. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm
dead,"' said Desiree Smith, a senior journal
ism major who dropped to the floor near the
back of the auditorium.
"People were crawling on each other,
trampling each other," she said. "As I got
near the door. I got up and I started run
ning.''
University President John Peters said
four people died at the scene, including three
students and the gunman, while the other
two died at a hospital. The teacher, a gradu
ate student, was wounded but was expected
to recover.
Peters said the gunman was a former
graduate student in sociology at NIU, but
was not currently enrolled at the 25,000-stu

dent campus about 65 miles west of Chicago.
"It appears he may have been a student
somewhere else," University Police Chief
Donald Grady said. Authorities did not
release any other details about the gunman
or identify the victims.
Witnesses said the skinny gunman,
dressed in black and wearing a stocking cap,
emerged from behind a screen on the stage
of 200-seat Cole Hall and opened fire just as
the class was about to end around 3 p.m.
Officials said 162 students were regis
tered for the class but it was unknown how
many were there Thursday.
Lauren Carr said she was sitting in the
third row when she saw the shooter walk
through a door on the right-hand side of the
stage, pointing a gun straight ahead.

"I personally Army-crawled halfway up
the aisle," said Carr, a 20-year-old sopho
more. "I said I could get up and run or I
could die here."
She said a student in front of her was
bleeding, "but he just kept running."
"I heard this girl scream, 'Run, he's
reloading the gun!"'
Student Jerry Santoni was in a back row
when he saw the gunman enter a service
door to the stage.
"I saw him shoot one round at the
teacher." he said. "After that, 1 proceeded to
get down as fast as I could."
Santoni dived down, hitting his head the
seat in front of him, leaving a knot about
half the size of a pingpong ball on his fore
head.
