### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's bas
ketball team out-scored, out-rebound
ed and generally outplayed Arizona at
Maples Pavilion last night, running
away with a 69-46 victory. It was the
Cardinal's 11th win in a row.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins con
tinued her inexorable march towards
the all-time Pacific 10 Conference
scoring record, racking up 16 points,
but it was freshman forward Kayla
Pedersen who led Stanford on the
night.
Pedersen scored 18 and was the
Cardinal's main offensive option in
the early stages of the first half, when
Stanford (23-3, 12-2 Pac-10) built its
lead after Arizona (9-15, 3-10) went
ahead briefly, 4-2.
The Cardinal only shot 38.8 per
cent from the field but grabbed 22 of
fensive rebounds off of its misses, set
ting up second, third and fourth op
portunities on the offensive end. Stan
ford also capitalized on its opportuni
ties from the free throw line, going 11-
for-12.
Sophomore center Jayne Appel
notched a double-double with 12
points and 11 rebounds. Appel had a
remarkable overall game, adding 5 as
sists, 4 steals and 3 blocks. She now has
61 blocks on the season, tying her
school record set last season.
With the win. Stanford can now
look forward to its weekend match-up
with perennial conference rival Ari
zona State. The Sun Devils (16-8.10-3)
trail the Cardinal by a game in the
standings after losing to No. 9 Califor
nia last night, 70-60. ASU is one of the
only teams in the conference that can
counter Stanford's big bodies inside,
with 6-foot-3 junior transfers Lauren
Lacey and Sybil Dosty.
