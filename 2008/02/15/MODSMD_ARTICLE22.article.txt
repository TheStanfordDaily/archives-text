## Card ready for home showdown No. 3 Stanford set to square off against No. 8 Davis, Pacific 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After playing four games in two days at last
weekend's Stanford Invitational, the Stanford
women's water polo team certainly has a much
lighter schedule for this weekend, with two matches
in two days. The squad, however, is certainly aware
that a lighter schedule should not be confused with a
less important one.
The Cardinal, 4-1 on the year and ranked third in
the nation, host conference foe Pacific on Saturday
at 1 p.m. before squaring off against No. 8 UC-Davis
on Sunday at noon. Both matches will be played at
Avery Stadium.
Pacific has the exact opposite record of Stanford
this season, standing at 1-4. The Tigers notched their
first victory of the year last Saturday, but they have
otherwise struggled thus far. The combined score of
their first three games was 53-15 in favor of the op
position. and they have also been hurt by the fact
that their leading scorer from last year, Sarah Harris,
did not return to the team for her sophomore sea
son.
The Card knows that it can't look past Pacific,
though. The team looks to start out strong and finish
the game off as soon as it can.
"The Pacific game is important," head coach John
Tinner said. "It is a conference game and therefore
has seeding implications for our conference tourna
ment."
Although UC-Davis is not a conference oppo-

GAME NOTES: Ranked No. 3 in the nation, Stanford is off to a 4-
1 start on the year. The women will face No. 8 UC-Davis on
Saturday after today's bout with the Tigers. The Cardinal has
been an offensive force in its first five games, scoring more 10
goals or more in four games.
nent, the Cardinal will still have its
hands full on Sunday. The Aggies are
6-2 on the year and ranked No. 8 in
the nation, with their only losses
coming to No. 5 Cal and No! 16 UC-
Santa Barbara. Tanner admitted that
the match on Sunday would be diffi
cult.
"Davis will be a significant chal
lenge," he said."They have some very
talented, competitive players and are
always well-prepared to play us."
Two such players who the Cardi
nal will have to mark closely are
freshman Dakotah Mohr and senior
Christi Raycraft, who are leading the
Aggies with 13 and 11 goals, respec
tively.
Davis coach Jamey Wright told
CSTV.com that the Aggies would
look "to work on controlling the ball
and controlling tempo," trying to pre
vent Stanford from getting on the
counter-attack. That is, however,
much easier said than done against
the Cardinal, as they proved in the
Invitational tournament last week
end. Moreover, despite its strong
showing at the tournament, Stanford
is still looking to improve.
"This week we are sorting
through our tournament games fig
uring out what we're doing well and
where we might make substantial im
provements," Tanner said. "1 liked
the way we played on Sunday —
beating Cal and Hawaii — following
our loss to LJSC."
The way Stanford played after
that one-goal loss showed that it was
more than capable of bouncing back,
and the confidence and momentum
has grown over its last two games.
Junior driver Kira Hillman knows
that it will be key for the Card to keep
that same momentum going through
this weekend and then throughout
the rest of the season.
"It is really important to start off
our individual [non-tournament]
games strong," she said.
That is why, even though this
weekend's games may not seem ex
tremely important on paper, they
may well be vital in determining the
remainder of the season for the Car
dinal.
