## No. 3 Softball to host Stanford Invitational after a strong 5-0 start 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 13 Stanford Softball team will put its undefeat
ed record to the test this weekend when it hosts the Stan
lord Invitational.The tournament starts today and will run
through Sunday, featuring four teams: the host Cardinal,
Santa Clara, Pacific and Wichita State.
The women, 5-0 on the year, will play five games this
weekend; three will come in round-robin play, while the
last two will be single-elimination, determining the cham
pion of the tournament.
After losing in Regional Championships last year, the
Cardinal has come out firing to start the 2008 season.
"Our team has worked extremely hard in preparation
for this year," coach John Rittman said. "As a coach. I'm
pretty proud of the fact that they put that effort in."
"Our pitching and defense have shown that they can
win us some ball games â€” with some timely hitting," said
senior third baseman Michelle Smith. "But our game
against Saint Mary's showed how potent our offense is as
well."
Much of the team's early-season success may be attrib
uted to junior pitcher Missy Penna. With four starts under
her belt. Penna already boasts an impressive set of accom
plishments and accolades. She started the season off with a
no-hitter against San Diego, is holding opposing hitters to
a .064 batting average and has not given up a single run yet
in 25 innings of work. The junior was also named National
Player of the Week bv USA Softball after her dominating
