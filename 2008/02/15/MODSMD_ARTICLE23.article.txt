# Cardinal looking to stay perfect
## No. 3 Softball to host Stanford Invitational after a strong 5-0 start 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 13 Stanford Softball team will put its undefeat
ed record to the test this weekend when it hosts the Stan
lord Invitational.The tournament starts today and will run
through Sunday, featuring four teams: the host Cardinal,
Santa Clara, Pacific and Wichita State.
The women, 5-0 on the year, will play five games this
weekend; three will come in round-robin play, while the
last two will be single-elimination, determining the cham
pion of the tournament.
After losing in Regional Championships last year, the
Cardinal has come out firing to start the 2008 season.
"Our team has worked extremely hard in preparation
for this year," coach John Rittman said. "As a coach. I'm
pretty proud of the fact that they put that effort in."
"Our pitching and defense have shown that they can
win us some ball games — with some timely hitting," said
senior third baseman Michelle Smith. "But our game
against Saint Mary's showed how potent our offense is as
well."
Much of the team's early-season success may be attrib
uted to junior pitcher Missy Penna. With four starts under
her belt. Penna already boasts an impressive set of accom
plishments and accolades. She started the season off with a
no-hitter against San Diego, is holding opposing hitters to
a .064 batting average and has not given up a single run yet
in 25 innings of work. The junior was also named National
Player of the Week bv USA Softball after her dominating

Junior pitcher Missy Penna has played a huge role in No. 13 Stanford's fast start, with
a no-hitter in the season opener to help kick start things for the Cardinal. Penna has yet

"Missy's coming into her own this
year," Rittman said. "She's pitched a
lot of games for us in the past and
she's got a lot of experience in her
[previous] two years at Stanford."
The team is fresh off of an 8-0 win
against Saint Mary's on Wednesday,
a game which was cancelled after
five innings due to the extent of Car
dinal's lead. The eight runs were the
most the team has scored this sea
son, and the women look to carry
that offensive momentum into this
weekend when they face two Bay
Area rivals and one of the top teams
from a tough softball conference:
Wichita State and the Missouri Val
ley Conference, respectively.

"Santa Clara always seems to
play us tough," Rittman said. "Both
[Santa Clara and Pacific) are good,
healthy rivalries. Both teams are
very competitive."
The Broncos are currently 0-5,
despite returning their two top
pitchers from last season, Jerrica
Castagno and Jackie Morales. Pacif
ic. 1-3 on the year and also returning
its top two pitchers — who were All-
Big West selections last year — may
present more of a challenge than
Santa Clara. In any case, however,
coach Rittman's squad won't be tak
ing any of his team's opponents for
granted this weekend.
"We expect to see some very
tough competition." he said.

Penna has not given up a single run in 25 in

pretty proud of the fact that they put that effort in."
"Our pitching and defense have shown that they can
win us some ball games — with some timely hitting," said
senior third baseman Michelle Smith. "But our game
against Saint Mary's showed how potent our offense is as
well."
Much of the team's early-season success may be attrib
uted to junior pitcher Missy Penna. With four starts under
her belt. Penna already boasts an impressive set of accom
plishments and accolades. She started the season off with a
no-hitter against San Diego, is holding opposing hitters to
a .064 batting average and has not given up a single run yet
in 25 innings of work. The junior was also named National
Player of the Week bv USA Softball after her dominating

Junior pitcher Missy Penna has played a huge role in No. 13 Stanford's fast start, with

nament.
"Missy's coming into her own this
year," Rittman said. "She's pitched a
lot of games for us in the past and
she's got a lot of experience in her
[previous] two years at Stanford."
The team is fresh off of an 8-0 win
against Saint Mary's on Wednesday,
a game which was cancelled after
five innings due to the extent of Car
dinal's lead. The eight runs were the
most the team has scored this sea
son, and the women look to carry
that offensive momentum into this
weekend when they face two Bay
Area rivals and one of the top teams
from a tough softball conference:
Wichita State and the Missouri Val
ley Conference, respectively.

"Santa Clara always seems to
play us tough," Rittman said. "Both
[Santa Clara and Pacific) are good,
healthy rivalries. Both teams are
very competitive."
The Broncos are currently 0-5,
despite returning their two top
pitchers from last season, Jerrica
Castagno and Jackie Morales. Pacif
ic. 1-3 on the year and also returning
its top two pitchers — who were All-
Big West selections last year — may
present more of a challenge than
Santa Clara. In any case, however,
coach Rittman's squad won't be tak
ing any of his team's opponents for
granted this weekend.
"We expect to see some very
tough competition." he said.
Coming off of a 37-28 season last
year. Wichita State just might he the
Cardinal's toughest competition this
weekend. The Shockers are 2-2 on
the young season, but return two
All-Midwest region selections in

GAME NOTES; Stanford has been led by junior
pitcher Missy Penna so far this season.
Penna has not given up a single run in 25 in
nings, has thrown a no-hitter and has three
shutouts in four starts.

"If we can [keep improving], then 5-0 is
just the beginning because this team has all
the pieces it needs to win a championship."

Bright struck out 201 batters last
season and posted a 2.44 ERA,
while Barnett led the team last sea
son with a lofty .348 batting average.
"They'll be a formidable oppo

nent for us," Rittman commented.
The Stanford Invitational will be
the second of six tournaments in
which the Cardinal is set to compete
before it begins its Pac-10 schedule.
Stanford will host two more tourna
ments before the non-conference
season is over: the Stanford Classic
(March 6-9) and the second version
of the Stanford Invitational (March

ments provide a good way for Stan
ford to prepare itself before the
daunting Pac-10 schedule — in by
far the nation's best conference —
begins.
"The most important thing with
tournaments is facing competition
to prepare for the rigors of the Pac
-10" Rittman said. "Our goal is to
play the toughest schedule possi
ble."
Despite having the looming Pac

10 season in mind, however, the Car
dinal is just trying to take things as
they come.
"We're looking forward to con
tinuing to play well on all fronts and
hoping to improve every day." Smith
explained."lf we can do that, then 5-
0 is just the beginning because this
team has all the pieces it needs to
win a championship."
"Our team knows we have to
take it one game at a time," Rittman
added. "It's not a sprint; it's a jour
ney. Our goal is to improve every
day."
Starting today, Stanford will have
the chance to do just that. The Cardi
nal begins competition today with a
2 p.m. bout against Santa Clara be
fore facing Wichita State at 4 p.m.
All of this weekend's games will
take place at the Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium.
