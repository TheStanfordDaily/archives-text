## Stanford looks to tame Tigers No. 10 men looking for payback against Pacific 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
The last time that the No. 10 Stanford
men's volleyball team faced the Universi
ty of the Pacific, the then-winJessTigers got
their first win of the season. When the Car
dinal travels to Stockton tonight, the team
will be trying to deny Pacific its second.
Since their last meeting just two weeks
ago. Stanford (8-5,4-5) has garnered back
to-back victories against Ball State and
UCSB; the team, however, dropped its
most recent match with a loss to Cal State-
Northridge last Saturday The Tigers (1-11.
1 -8), meanwhile, lost three in a row against
the same set of opponents.
In the Jan. 31 sweep at Stanford, the
Tigers beat the Cardinal with more consis
tent hitting and better blocking, led by Jeff
Hendershot's 10 kills and five blocks.
Sophomore Evan Romero had a solid
night for Stanford with 16 kills, but the rest
of the offense struggled and the team lost
in three games: 30-21,30-26,30-24.
"It was extremely frustrating," said
freshman outside hitter Spencer McLach
lin. who missed the match with an ankle in
jury. "We played with no energy. It seemed
like we thought they would give in. lie
cause they were winless. But they are actu
ally a really good team. They just have not
been playing to their potential — then

they decided to play their best match
against us and we were not ready mental
ly"
While the Cardinal has utilized rotating
lineups throughout the season so far,
Romero has been a constant force at the
opposite hitter position. His 196 kills are a
team high and he is among Stanford's
leaders in digs and blocks. Romero also
leads the team with 14 service aces on the
year.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran is sec
ond on the team with 141 kills. Since re
turning from his injury. McLachlin has
joined an outside hitting corps that also in
cludes redshirt junior Jesse Meredith and
sophomore Kawika Shoji. Shoji leads the
team in assists despite splitting time with
junior Miki Groppi.
The middle blocking group — jun
iors Brandon Williams and Cameron
Christoffers, sophomore Garrett
Werner and freshmen Charley Hen
rikson and Max Halvorson — have all
started at least one match.
Pacific, on the other hand, looks
primarily to seniors Pekka Seppanen,
Blake Gentry and Simon Chen-Byer
ley to lead its team. After a few slow
matches, Seppanen exploded with 33
kills in last week's four-game loss to
Santa Barbara, scoring half as many
kills as the entire UCSB team. The

Finnish outside hitter is the top attack
er and server on the Tigers' roster and
one of its best diggers.
"He's really good." McLachlin said
of Seppanen. "He's one of those guys
who is not very tall but is so crafty that
he somehow manages to get a kill al
most every time. When he's hot. their
team is very good."
One of the biggest differences in
the last match with Pacific was in
blocking — the Cardinal got out
bUx'ked 12 to 4 in the match. I lenrik
son and Williams lead the Cardinal
blocking, but overall, the team aver
ages fewer than 2 per game.
"We're putting a lot of emphasis on
blocking in practice," McLachlin said.
"We are near the bottom of the league
in blocks per game, so that has been a
main focus for coach kostv."

A win this weekend would push the
Cardinal's conference record to 5-5
before next week's two-game visit to
undefeated and top-ranked BYll
Plus.it would be a satisfying emotional
victory after the team's early-season
loss to the Tigers.
"[The loss] is definitely a motivat
tional factor for us," NlcLachlin. said.
"Last year they swept us, so 1 know a
lot of the guys definitely want to get a,
win against Pacific. It's been a couple*
of years since we beat them and
they're our rivals."
Stanford plays at Pacific tonight at
7 p.m. The Cardinal's next home
matches will be Feb. 27 and Feb. 28,
both against No. 15 Hawaii.
