# Track and field off to Arkansas
## Stanford gears up for the high-profile Tyson Invitational, ready for NCAA stretch run 
### ANARGHYA VARDANA 
The Stanford track and field team is prepar
ing to take on another field of high-caliber colle
giate athletes, national record holders and
Olympians at today's 2008Tyson Invitational in
Fayetteville, Ark.
With an expected turnout of more than 4.4(H)
fans, the meet boasts some of the best runners in
the nation.
In the past, the event has seen world records
broken, and spectators will likely watch
Olympians make their mark this year before
heading off to Beijing for the 2008 Summer
Olympics.
Stanford sophomore Durell Coleman, who
will compete in the men's 200 and 400 meter
races, commented on the Tyson Invite's reputa
tion as a high-profile meet.
"[The meet provides us with the opportunity
to] run and compete prior to NCAA's," he said.
"We've been having a successful season so far,
and everyone has put in a lot of effort in training,
so we have really high hopes about how this
meet is going to turn out."
Indeed, the track and field team has been
training long and hard since September, hoping
that its work in the weight room and on the track
pays off with solid results. As some of the team
heads off to Arkansas, other members of the
squad will leave for Seattle, Wash, for the Husky
Classic at the University of Washington.
Stanford athletes also competed in Seattle
two weeks ago at the University of Washington
Indoor Invitational. Their results proved a
strong testament to all their hard work, as Stan
ford dominated the meet with several impres
sive results. Sophomore Griffin Matthew won
the women's 60-meter dash with a time of 7.45
seconds, while senior Arianna Lambie took
third in the 3000 with a time of 9:05.32, an auto
matic NCAA qualifying time.
The class of 2011 also took a big step towards
proving itself at the event, as the freshmen
earned several victories for the Cardinal:
Shataya Hendricks finished third in the 60-
meter dash. Alexandra Gits third in the 5000-
meter run. Whitney Liehr first in the 60-meter
hurdles pentathlon and Arantxa King first in the
women's long jump. In addition. King earned
herself an NCAA qualifying distance with her
astounding performance.
Senior Erica McLain guaranteed herself a
spot at NCAA's, winning the women's triple
jump with an NCAA qualifying jump. McLain is

also currently the No. 1 collegiate women's long
jumper in the nation.The women's 4x400-meter
relay with 1 lendricks. Idara Otu, Claire Thielke
and Nora Miller took second behind Oregon.
The Cardinal men also ran several notable
races, as freshman Andrew Dargie sprinted to a
second place finish in the 400-meter dash. Junior
Myles Bradley claimed second place in the
men's 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.12 sec
onds.
Providing overall excellence in the men's
heptathlon, senior Josh 1 lustedt got third place
in the 60-meter hurdles, second in the pole

vault, and third in the long jump, making for an
overall fourth place in the heptathlon event.
Hustedt currently holds the record for that
event, which he set in January of 2007. Team
mate Corey Pysick followed with a third place
in the pole vault heptathlon while senior
Graeme Hoste secured an NCAA provisional
spot in the men's pole vault, also getting second
place in the event.
Hie men's distance medley relay of Hakon
Devries, Dargie, Justin Reed and Garrett I leath
achieved a close third place finish, achieving a
provisional NCAA qualifying time.

Sophomore Richard Sherman, a notable tal
ent at wideout on the football field, jumped
14.97 meters for a third place finish in the men's
triple jump. The Cardinal hopes to leave a simi
lar or even better mark on Dempsey Indoor
Track as it prepares to compete in its last meet
before the conference season begins.
