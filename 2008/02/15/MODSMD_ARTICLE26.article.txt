## Stanford looks to kick past BYU, No. 8 Cal 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's dive
squad is set for its confrontation
with Brigham Young today while the
No. 2 swim team will have to wait an
extra day before facing off against
No. 8 Cal on Saturday at 1 p.m. at the
Avery Aquatic Center. Stanford has
so far accumulated wins against San
Jose State, Washington. Arizona,
Arizona State, UCLA and USC
while suffering only one loss at the
hand of No. 1 Georgia.
ITiis weekend's meet against Cal

could be a huge momentum booster
for the Cardinal women going into
the Pac-10 Championships (Feb. 27-
Mar. 1) at Long Beach.
"Our meet against USC was a
successful in-season meet," junior
Fiona O'Donnell McCarthy said.
"We went into the meet without
much rest and we're focusing on the
details of our races and less on the
times. We are in a good position
going into our final dual meet
against Cal and the postseason
meets."
Stanford has high hopes to win
the NCAA title this year, with its

core relay (sophomore Julia Smit,
junior Caroline Bruce, sophomore
Elain Breeden and senior Brooke
Bishop) team back from last year.
The team lost last year's MVPCas
sidy krug to graduation after manag
ing a fourth place overall finish last
season. And while most other teams
would be overjoyed with a fourth
place finish in a Division 1 sport, Stan
ford was admittedly disappointed
with its performance. A large part of
the championship team had faster
times at the conference finals than at
the NCAA meet, leaving plenty of
room for 'what-ifs.'
"1 think Stanford has a very legiti
mate shot at winning the champi
onship this year." Breeden said. "We
have an incredibly talented team and
we have more depth than we had last
year. We are going to have more peo
ple in the finals and more swimmers
scoring, and that's what it takes for a
victory.
"Every team member plays a cru
cial role in that they have a responsi
bility to step up and perform." she

added. "The competition is intense
and the pressure is high, but we have
worked hard all year and we will be
ready."
Stanford has a strong chance to
win the title this year and the fresh
men class will definitely have a major
impact for the women. Last year's top
recruit in the nation, freshman Eliza
beth Smith, has added depth to the
team in the breaststroke and IM
events while freshman Kate Dwelley
is one of the nation's top freestylers
with a legitimate chance to earn an
Olympic spot.
Freshman Meg Hostage has al
ready asserted herself as one of the
nation's top divers along with fresh
man teammate Hallie Ivester. Fur
ther adding to the freshmen's ac

complishments, Kerry Kraemer
adds depth to the breaststroke and.
IM events. Freshman sprinter Julie*
Smith will add points for the Cardin
nal in the 50,100,and 200 freestyles.
In terms of its training, the swim
team has entered the 'shave and
taper' portion of its schedule, the time'
when practices are shorter and swim
mers cover less yardage, focusing in
stead on more specific skills such as
reaction time and turns. The purpose
of the taper is to rest the athletes for
the big events while maintaining
stroke form and technique in order to
get the best swims to qualify for
N( AA cuts.
