## No. 7 Cardinal falls to Sun Devils in OT, 72-68 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
night. The Cardinal fell 72-68 in overtime to
the Arizona State Sun Devils on Thursday
night after squandering a 14-point lead in the
final 7:28 of regulation.
"We had the opportunity to close the
game out in regulation," Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "With free throws, blocking out.

Neither 46 combined points from the
Lopez twins nor a 26-2 run midway through
the second half was enough for No. 7
Stanford to leave Tempe, Ariz, with a win last

things we've been doing all season, things
we're capable 0f.... [Our performance] on
the glass wasn't going to cut it. but you have
to give Arizona State credit. They're a good
team."
Although Stanford (20-4. 9-3 Pac-10) is
third in the nation in rebounding margin —
out-rebounding opponents by more than 10
boards per game — Stanford grabbed only 37
rebounds to the Sun Devils' 35. Arizona State
junior forward Jeff Pendergraph corralled 12
rebounds, 6 of them offensive, before fouling
out. Most of the team's 16 offensive rebounds
resulted in second-chance points, and one, by
Duke transfer Eric Boateng with 53 seconds
left in overtime, helped seal the victory.
"They got big-time rebounds, a lot of sec
ond possessions," said sophomore center
Brook Lopez, who notched his second 30-
point game of the season in the loss.
Johnson put his analysis more bluntly: "they
made plays — we didn't. They grabbed loose
ball — we didn't. They got rebounds that led
to offensive plays — we didn't. They nailed
jump shots — we didn't."
