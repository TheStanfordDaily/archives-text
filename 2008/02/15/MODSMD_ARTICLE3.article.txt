## No. 7 Cardinal falls to Sun Devils in OT, 72-68 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
night. The Cardinal fell 72-68 in overtime to
the Arizona State Sun Devils on Thursday
night after squandering a 14-point lead in the
final 7:28 of regulation.
"We had the opportunity to close the
game out in regulation," Stanford coach Trent
Johnson said. "With free throws, blocking out.

Neither 46 combined points from the
Lopez twins nor a 26-2 run midway through
the second half was enough for No. 7
Stanford to leave Tempe, Ariz, with a win last

things we've been doing all season, things
we're capable 0f.... [Our performance] on
the glass wasn't going to cut it. but you have
to give Arizona State credit. They're a good
team."
Although Stanford (20-4. 9-3 Pac-10) is
third in the nation in rebounding margin —
out-rebounding opponents by more than 10
boards per game — Stanford grabbed only 37
rebounds to the Sun Devils' 35. Arizona State
junior forward Jeff Pendergraph corralled 12
rebounds, 6 of them offensive, before fouling
out. Most of the team's 16 offensive rebounds
resulted in second-chance points, and one, by
Duke transfer Eric Boateng with 53 seconds
left in overtime, helped seal the victory.
"They got big-time rebounds, a lot of sec
ond possessions," said sophomore center
Brook Lopez, who notched his second 30-
point game of the season in the loss.
Johnson put his analysis more bluntly: "they
made plays — we didn't. They grabbed loose
ball — we didn't. They got rebounds that led
to offensive plays — we didn't. They nailed
jump shots — we didn't."

GAME NOTES: Stanford had its seven-game win streak
snapped yesterday, despite heroic efforts from the
Lopez twins. Brook scored 30 points while Robin added
16; together the twins combined for two thirds of the
Cardinal's points.


Anthony Goods and the Cardinal fell short in Tempe last night as Arizona State upset Stanford
with a four point overtime victory, overcoming a 14-point deficit with 7:28 left in regulation.
Who got hot when decided the
contest. Arizona State (16-7, 6-5)
jumped out to an early 7-0 lead as
Stanford entered the game flat. The
Cardinal battled hack to a four-point
deficit as Kenny Brown hit a jumper
from the baseline heading into the
break. Then, after going down 35-25
on a Pendergraph dunk three min
utes into the second half, Stanford
reeled off 26 points to the Sun Dev
ils' two.
Sophomore Landry Fields punc
tuated the run with a breakaway
dunk; his foul shot to complete the
three-point play gave him 8 points
during the nine-minute stretch and
put Stanford ahead 51-37.
But Arizona State fought back
behind freshman phenom James
Harden. Harden, who earned Pac-10
honors early in the season for his
late-game heroics, took over towards
the end of regulation. He scored
ASU's final four points of regula
tion, including a putback off his own
miss to send the game into overtime.
He scored eight in the extra period to
finish with 23.
"My feeling going into overtime,"
Johnson said, "was that we need to
play better. We didn't play well the
last three or four minutes."

Whether Stanford assigned
Landry Fields, Lawrence Hill or An
thony Goods to cover I larden made
no difference — Sun Devils' coach
Herb Sendek curled Harden off a
screen on the right elbow and the
freshman responded time and again,
repeatedly forging his way to the bas
ket. Fred Washington shut Harden
down when Stanford beat Arizona
State at Maples Pavilion on Jan. 19,
but Johnson kept Washington on the
bench during the Sun Devils' end of
game run. Washington played only
12 minutes despite starting the game.
"One of the things 1 noticed was
that [ ASU) scored a lot more against
us than other teams," sophomore
Robin Lopez said. "We had defen
sive breakdowns. We've got to keep
our composure —we kind of lost
our heads at times .... We should be
confident but not overconfident —
when we were up 14. we may have
been a little passive."
Besides his brother. Robin was
the only Stanford player to score in
double digits. Thursday marked the
first time the twins each scored over
15 points in the same game. The rest
of the team, however, struggled
mightily on the offensive end.
Goods and Hill, Stanford's sec

ond and third-leading scorers, re
spectively, shot a combined 2-15
from the floor for a total of six points.
Even though Mitch Johnson hit a
three from the right baseline with 35
seconds left in overtime to cut the
Stanford deficit to one, neither he
nor Goods could connect from be

yond the arc in three combined
chances in the final 17 seconds.
Trent Johnson, dispirited after the
game, suggested only one bright spot
in his team's disappointing loss.
"After the first half, we showed
our ability to come from behind on
the road, which 1 thought, for the

most part, we did," he said. "That's
it."
Arizona State improved to 4-0 in
overtime games this year, 3-0 in Pac
-10 play. The win moved them into a
three-way tie with USC and Arizona
for fourth place in the conference at
6-5.

Stanford, who briefly held a first
place tie with UCLA, saw its seven
game winning streak come to an end
as they fell to 20-4 and 9-3 in confer
ence play.
