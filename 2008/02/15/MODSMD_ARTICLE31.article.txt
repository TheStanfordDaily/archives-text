## Editor's Note

Breaking up is the most crucial part of a relationship. Sure, tenderness is nice, sex can be great (if it isn't, ask Roxy for pointers) and the chance to passive-aggressively rub your
happy couplehood in the face of unattached friends simply can't be beaten of a bitter winter night. But face it: in twenty years you aren't going to remember the slow Sunday mornings
or how good he smelled when he crawled in bed straight out of the shower. You're going to remember the time you stomped that sorry scumbag's heart flat in a knock-down-drag-out
that got you both permanently banned from Antonio's Nut House.
Relationships you can rush into, but break-ups take serious planning and angsting. If you're looking for a way out (now that you've already gotten your Valentine's action) here's a little
advice:
DO choose the location carefully. If you try to break up in a private dorm room, for example, you might be too overcome by fond memories to make the cut final. Plus, the neighbors
would have to turn their music down to hear all the juicy details.
DON'T write your friends long, bitter emails about how badly your ex mistreated you. Pour out your acidic heart in long, bitter Facebook wall posts instead so all your acquain
tances can enjoy the drama too.
DO use positive "I" statements instead of aggressive "you" statements while having the break-up talk. I can do so much better. I hate your guts. / slept with your brother over
Thanksgiving break. See, don't you feel better already?
DON'T actually sleep with his brother. Come on. Did you really think that was going to turn out well?
DO confide in your closest friends. They thought your ex was a heinous douchetard long before the first cracks appeared in the relationship. Even when you've run out of com
plaints, they'll have enough material to keep the break-up dramz going for months.
DON'T throw away photographs of you two together in better times. Hold on to them because one day you will want to look back and remember a time when he was happy and
vibrant — especially compared to the weeping shell of a man he'll become when he finds out you sold his motorcycle and his XBOX on Craigslist for a buck apiece.
DO keep in touch with him electronically after a suitable interval. Sign up his email address for the National Rifle Association newsletter, Narcotics Anonymous, NAMBLA, the
Laßouche Campaign street team and every other weblist you can think of. If he already was a member of Laßouche's Campaign, sorry, man, this advice is coming way too late.
DON'T tell all your friends about the time he got really stoned and woke up in prison for indecent exposure. Tell the professors who wrote his letters of recommendation for
law school. In fact, if you know his webmail password, maybe Harvard would be interested in hearing it straight from the ass's mouth.
DO have make-up sex. Breaking up may be the most important part of a relationship, but it's not the only part.
