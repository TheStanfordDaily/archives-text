# How to Make the Perfect Milkshake
## 
### AUSTIN ZUMBRO INTERMISSION SAUCY SHAKER 
Have you ever felt inadequate? I have. I al
ways slice my drive into a hunker, and then on
top of that, 1 usually three-putt. 1 missed the last
season of both "LOST" and "Grey's Anatomy,"
so I never know what anyone is talking about at
parties, and those pills I bought on the Internet
that promised to "boost my confidence" have
not been working. Sometimes I wish I owned a
gun. but my Democrat friends would call me and
complain. Actually, that might not be so bad. At
least then they would call me.
If you have felt inadequate, you also know
how unlikely it is that things will ever change for
you. I know, I used to feel the same way up until
a few weeks ago. Then, suddenly, everything
changed.
For whatever reason, possibly because I had
just ingested $fr(X) worth of ground-up tiger's
penis, I decided to go outside. As I looked out
over my yard, unable to remember when I had
installed the rock garden. I had the nagging sen
sation that something was missing. Then, an
epiphany! My yard had no boys! I was instantly
overwhelmed by nostalgia for my youth, re
membering the long summer days when I would
watch "Sandlot" in my room while all of my
friends played baseball. Right then and there, I
knew that in order to he happy, I had to get little
boys to come to my
yard. But how was
I going to do
that?
Milkshakes,
clearly. This
presented a

problem, as 1 had never made a milkshake, and
at the time my refrigerator only contained 40 oz.
of malt liquor and a single onion. Yet, again
probably due to the tiger's penis, 1 was unde
terred. I jumped on You Tube and searched for
"milkshake." Amazingly, a woman named Kelis
had written a song that detailed everything I
needed to know to make exactly the kind of
milkshake I wanted. Quick as I could. I grabbed
a notepad and pressed play.
Right away, 1 knew this was the person to talk
to about making milkshakes. Her milkshake ap
parently brings all the boys to the yard. Admit
tedly, the boys were not coming to her yard,
choosing instead to meet up at some city-owned,
public yard, like a park or recreation center.
Judging by the mass appeal of her milkshakes, I
figure Kelis moved it there out of a need for
more space. I assume the city allows this because
it has proven an effective way of keeping kids off
the streets and off drugs, and instead keeps them
on baseball diamonds drinking milkshakes.
1 was sold on reputation alone, so I cannot ex
press the excitement 1 felt when Kelis said that
she could teach me to make her famous milk
shake, "but," she said, she would "have to
charge." Now. I had recently been burned by
similar Internet-based "recipes-for-success,"
but unlike the supposed Dr. Ryan (who I swear
I have seen in a Smirnoff ad), Kelis
seemed to have the proper creden
tials. I whipped out
my credit card,
fully prepared

to shell out the dough, hut Kelis never quoted
me a price. She never linked me to a Pay Pal site
or gave me a number to call. 1 was confused. In
stead, she just kept up the sales pitch. She said
herself that she knew 1 wanted it,"the thing that
makes her what the guys go crazy for," hut how
was 1 supposed to buy it? This seemed like a ter
rible business model.
Then 1 realized that Kelis probably has to
deal with much more skeptical people than
yours truly, so 1 should not expect her to put up
the sales information until later on in the pro
gram. Some people might not be so easily con
vinced by her reputation alone, and that kind of
person will want to know all the information,
like whether or not "the boys are waiting." It
turns out that they boys arc waiting, and that
they even sing a song while they wait because
they are so excited for the milkshakes. (Kelis
even sang the song as a demonstration. Appar
ently it goes "la la la la la" because little boys are
too busy being adorable to sing real words.)
But then Kelis did something that really
threw me for a loop! She turned around and told
me that this technique she knows — the one that
"freaks the boys" (which 1 imagine means "gets
them really excited") — this technique, appar
ently "cannot be bought." I felt misled, and I
started to get upset before I caught on that she
was giving me a sly hint. There was a way that 1
could learn her secrets without paying the mys
terious unnamed fee! Her words were warning
me that "thieves get caught,"
but her eyes were telling
me, "You know, there
are no legitimate
grounds for a law-

suit if your milkshakes just happen to taste as
good as mine do." Then she said, "Watch it
you're smart," so 1 did. And this is what I
learned:
First, making milkshakes is messy work.
Everyone in the instructional video got sprayed
with milk by the end: so if you are going to make
a milkshake, wear as little clothing as possible.
Second, the only real trick to making milkshakes
is to take milk and then "warm it up." At least,
that was the only advice that she actually told me
with her words. The rest 1 had to gather from vi
sual demonstration. It helps, it seems, if you
have one of those machines that makes steamed
milk. 1 always thought there was ice cream in
volved, but as usual, 1 was incorrect. Ice cream
only makes the milkshakes thick and creamy.
You want them to be watery and frothy instead.
That way, you can blow into them with a straw
and make little splashes. Boys love that. It's al
most more fun than playing baseball.
Well there you have it, and no, there is really
no need to thank me. Thank Kelis for slipping
me her secret techniques underneath the table!
Now, if you will excuse me, a sizable number of
children are gathered on my front lawn awaiting
the "Free Milkshakes" that my sign promises,
and 1 have to go shower them with all the hot,
frothy cream I have stored up.
Tune in next week, when I interview a British
scholar named Fergie and learn about my per
sonal influence on the stability of the world-fa
mous London Bridge.

Now, if you will excuse me, a sizable number of
children are gathered on my front lawn awaiting
the "Free Milkshakes" that my sign promises,
and 1 have to go shower them with all the hot,
frothy cream I have stored up.
Tune in next week, when I interview a British
scholar named Fergie and learn about my per
sonal influence on the stability of the world-fa
mous London Bridge.

Have you ever felt inadequate? I have. I al
ways slice my drive into a hunker, and then on
top of that, 1 usually three-putt. 1 missed the last
season of both "LOST" and "Grey's Anatomy,"
so I never know what anyone is talking about at
parties, and those pills I bought on the Internet
that promised to "boost my confidence" have
not been working. Sometimes I wish I owned a
gun. but my Democrat friends would call me and
complain. Actually, that might not be so bad. At
least then they would call me.
If you have felt inadequate, you also know
how unlikely it is that things will ever change for
you. I know, I used to feel the same way up until
a few weeks ago. Then, suddenly, everything
changed.
For whatever reason, possibly because I had
just ingested $fr(X) worth of ground-up tiger's
penis, I decided to go outside. As I looked out
over my yard, unable to remember when I had
installed the rock garden. I had the nagging sen
sation that something was missing. Then, an
epiphany! My yard had no boys! I was instantly
overwhelmed by nostalgia for my youth, re
membering the long summer days when I would
watch "Sandlot" in my room while all of my
friends played baseball. Right then and there, I
knew that in order to he happy, I had to get little
boys to come to my
yard. But how was
I going to do
that?
Milkshakes,
clearly. This
presented a

problem, as 1 had never made a milkshake, and
at the time my refrigerator only contained 40 oz.
of malt liquor and a single onion. Yet, again
probably due to the tiger's penis, 1 was unde
terred. I jumped on You Tube and searched for
"milkshake." Amazingly, a woman named Kelis
had written a song that detailed everything I
needed to know to make exactly the kind of
milkshake I wanted. Quick as I could. I grabbed
a notepad and pressed play.
Right away, 1 knew this was the person to talk
to about making milkshakes. Her milkshake ap
parently brings all the boys to the yard. Admit
tedly, the boys were not coming to her yard,
choosing instead to meet up at some city-owned,
public yard, like a park or recreation center.
Judging by the mass appeal of her milkshakes, I
figure Kelis moved it there out of a need for
more space. I assume the city allows this because
it has proven an effective way of keeping kids off
the streets and off drugs, and instead keeps them
on baseball diamonds drinking milkshakes.
1 was sold on reputation alone, so I cannot ex
press the excitement 1 felt when Kelis said that
she could teach me to make her famous milk
shake, "but," she said, she would "have to
charge." Now. I had recently been burned by
similar Internet-based "recipes-for-success,"
but unlike the supposed Dr. Ryan (who I swear
I have seen in a Smirnoff ad), Kelis
seemed to have the proper creden
tials. I whipped out
my credit card,
fully prepared

to shell out the dough, hut Kelis never quoted
me a price. She never linked me to a Pay Pal site
or gave me a number to call. 1 was confused. In
stead, she just kept up the sales pitch. She said
herself that she knew 1 wanted it,"the thing that
makes her what the guys go crazy for," hut how
was 1 supposed to buy it? This seemed like a ter
rible business model.
Then 1 realized that Kelis probably has to
deal with much more skeptical people than
yours truly, so 1 should not expect her to put up
the sales information until later on in the pro
gram. Some people might not be so easily con
vinced by her reputation alone, and that kind of
person will want to know all the information,
like whether or not "the boys are waiting." It
turns out that they boys arc waiting, and that
they even sing a song while they wait because
they are so excited for the milkshakes. (Kelis
even sang the song as a demonstration. Appar
ently it goes "la la la la la" because little boys are
too busy being adorable to sing real words.)
But then Kelis did something that really
threw me for a loop! She turned around and told
me that this technique she knows — the one that
"freaks the boys" (which 1 imagine means "gets
them really excited") — this technique, appar
ently "cannot be bought." I felt misled, and I
started to get upset before I caught on that she
was giving me a sly hint. There was a way that 1
could learn her secrets without paying the mys
terious unnamed fee! Her words were warning
me that "thieves get caught,"
but her eyes were telling
me, "You know, there
are no legitimate
grounds for a law-

suit if your milkshakes just happen to taste as
good as mine do." Then she said, "Watch it
you're smart," so 1 did. And this is what I
learned:
First, making milkshakes is messy work.
Everyone in the instructional video got sprayed
with milk by the end: so if you are going to make
a milkshake, wear as little clothing as possible.
Second, the only real trick to making milkshakes
is to take milk and then "warm it up." At least,
that was the only advice that she actually told me
with her words. The rest 1 had to gather from vi
sual demonstration. It helps, it seems, if you
have one of those machines that makes steamed
milk. 1 always thought there was ice cream in
volved, but as usual, 1 was incorrect. Ice cream
only makes the milkshakes thick and creamy.
You want them to be watery and frothy instead.
That way, you can blow into them with a straw
and make little splashes. Boys love that. It's al
most more fun than playing baseball.
Well there you have it, and no, there is really
no need to thank me. Thank Kelis for slipping
me her secret techniques underneath the table!
Now, if you will excuse me, a sizable number of
children are gathered on my front lawn awaiting
the "Free Milkshakes" that my sign promises,
and 1 have to go shower them with all the hot,
frothy cream I have stored up.
Tune in next week, when I interview a British
scholar named Fergie and learn about my per
