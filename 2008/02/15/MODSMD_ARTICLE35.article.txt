# BREAKING UP IN STYLE IS HARD TO DO
## 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION BREAK-UP MAVEN 
Breaking up is never easy, girls. There are so many things to take care of: the fi
nances, custody of the dog, your broken heart. But don't let the tears bleed your mas
cara out. There's nothing less attractive than a face soiled with eyeliner streaks.
(Well, there's obesity. So don't start binge-eating either.) Pull yourself together. At
first you were afraid. You were petrified. You thought that you could never live with
out him by your side. Girls, in the eternal words of the Pussycat Dolls (whom we
know to be prophetesses for single women everywhere): you don't need a man to
make you happy. And really, what emotional resources could he have offered that
chocolate couldn't?
It's not the end of the world, and you can make yourself feel better by looking
fierce. Make him want you back. Remind him what a fox you are. In relationships
you stop dressing up in favor of lazing about at home, cozying up in front of the tele
vision. No more. As an independent woman, you're going to go out a lot more. And
as a newly broken up man on the prowl, chances are he's going to be out on the town
too. And you need to be looking your best in order to make him feel that ache in his
bone. Bones. Whatever.
Let's start with hair. Chop it all off. Give those foot-long locks away. Cancer pa
tients need them more than you do. Victoria Beckham and Rihanna have shown that
a short, jazzy do that tapers off in the back can really show off your long neck and
draw attention to your decolletage. If this is a coiffure you refuse, then opt for a less
pirated version and go for a simple bob. Banged or fringed with layers, you need to
demonstrate that you're breaking off with the past. At any rate, shorter hair is going
to be perfect for spring.
Even if you don't think that a haircut is in order, you can still look good and make
him feel bad by reminding him how he once had you. Take some of his leftover
clothes and incorporate them into your own wardrobe: pair his sweaters or shirts,
probably too big for you, with some minishorts. Cinch at the waist with a huge belt
and there you have it: a dishabille, nearly-thcre-but-not-quite look. And if his clothes
aren't big on you, well, he probably was a small man anyway.

Black is a color to mourn in. Except, of coursc, that you'll still look fabulous in
black. Pick a little number that will show off some skin. It doesn't have to be high
cut or low-cut — or both. (That might be disastrous. Think Mariah Carey.) The
current craze is sheer and see-through. The suggestion of skin can be far sex
ier than actual skin itself, something that all sorority girls would do well to

remember.
Remember to get yourself some good underwear. No one else should be able to
see it, but you'll feel better about yourself. And if you by mistake get undressed again
in front of your ex. at least you'll see the new brassiere and think to yourself. "I need
to get myself out of here!" And you do, you weak-willed whore of Babylon. Either
break up or not. Decide for yourself. You're a woman, not a jellyfish.
And lastly, though 1 may be crucified by the Feminist Studies department, 1 ad
vise you to work out a bit more. Keep in shape. Relationships turn you into a blob.
Break-ups can turn that around. Shed that few extra pounds that being happy gave
you. Take runs around this beautiful campus. And let's face it. When you're panti
ng and out of breath, the last thing on your mind will be sex. Which is really all we
miss in our exes anyway.
