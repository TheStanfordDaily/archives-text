# DOMINATED BY LOVE

% m alentine's Day — that emotional ogre of a day —
\# has arrived, caused a scene and stormed out,
▼ slamming the door behind it. In the wake of this
dreaded holiday, there are surely those among us
who feel jackhammered, bulldozed and otherwise squished by
that crazy little thing called love. But the lovelorn can take com
fort in the knowledge that there's one woman out there — in
Michigan, to be exact — who isn't letting herself get smacked
around by love.
She won't reveal her legal name, but she's known to her devot
ed following simply as Mistress Persephone, perhaps the most
legendary professional dominatrix working today. Speaking to
Persephone on the phone at her home in Flint, Michigan, I
make the incredible mistake of asking whether domination in
volves...well...sex. Persephone responds with understandable
brusqueness. "1 do not offer sexual services. That," she says, "is
a prostitute." But she seems to forgive me with merciful quick
ness, because she muses on: "Sex is just such a simple, boring
thing, and these men are looking for something different."
The 35-year-old diva has spent the past 15 years modeling, per
forming, seeing clients and cultivating her notorious (and prof
itable) public persona. She is the focus of cult followings and ar
dent admirers, but the kicker is she's single. Persephone iden
tifies as bisexual, but all her serious relationships — including
her marriage to British rocker Tim Worman — have been with
men. I ask, tentatively, if she misses dating. "Honestly? No,"
she says. "It's so distracting, and your head gets all screwed up.
I think my work has been my most gratifying lover."
A glance through Persephone's interminable resume confirms
that this maven has done staggering amounts of work, mainly
in the area of "BDSM" — bondage, domination and sado
masochism. She has worked with Dita Von Teese (ex-wife of
Marilyn Manson), starred in what she cheerfully calls "some of
the worst horror movies ever made" and appeared in a prolif
eration of magazines including Leg Show, Leg Sex, Leg World,
Leg Action, Bondage Parade, Buxom Bondagettes, Black and
Blue, Whips and Chains, Tics that

have mysteriously expanded into a triple-D cup. "I had the im
plants put in, because when I was a little kid I wanted to look
like Elvira," she says sheepishly. "But it just never happened."
Photographs of the now-buxom Persephone feature a shocking
variety of horror/glamour makeup and suitably leather-ish
wardrobe items. Her piercings (nipples, ears and tongue) and
tattoos, including the trademark black widow on her stomach,
lend Persephone a fierce sort of look, although she emphasizes
that her personal aesthetic is a "glamorous" one.
When Persephone first picks up the phone, she sighs with exas
peration about computer problems. Her Web site, msperse
phone.com (you can also find it at sickchixx.com), features
everything from Persephone's biography to pricey pre-record
ed fetish "messages." The site is campy and flashy, an un
abashed mix of neon fonts and sinister black backgrounds, all
centered around the Mistress Persephone character.
"I created an Internet persona in 1996," she says. "When 1 was
young, 1 wanted to do something that would make me immor
tal, and by creating this myth of Persephone, I feel that 1 am cre
ating an immortal self. And now with the Internet, my pictures
will be out there forever."
Although the Web site is lucrative, managing it isn't always
easy. Persephone has warded off Internet stalkers and repelled
opposition from Christian groups who, accusing her of being a
Satanist, attempted to shut down her site. But Persephone
maintains a flourishing business, which, she hints, has left her
hank account in very good shape.
She has also launched a production company specializing in
fetish DVDs, and this company, the Web site and other ven
tures are what Persephone plans to fall back on, should she ever
decide to stop seeing clients.
This practicality about her finances characterizes Persephone's
approach to almost everything: her family, her ex-husband, her
clients, her yoga schedule. She speaks about her life with a mea-

it as particularly strange. While she chats blithely about "sub
missives" who offer to mow her lawn and plow her driveway, 1
gape silently into the phone. There's not a single question she
refuses to answer. 1 begin to suspect that, for Persephone at
least, there's not much new under the sun.

Persephone is a cheerful, occasional
ly giggly conversant who sounds
much younger than 35. And al
though she is occasionally deadly
serious, Persephone generally
speaks of her work with matter- ■,

of-fact detachment. She
even goes so far
as to

me as a profes
sional who is |

vice," she says,
"much like you
would go to a J

There is, however, no doubt
that Persephone is passion- i
ately in love with her work.
"I'm not stuck in an office
somewhere wishing 1 was
dead," she says. "1 wish every
one could have as fulfilling a
career as I have."

Persephone says she has al
ways taken pleasure in the
act of domination, although
her romantic relationships
don't always involve
BDSM. She has, ever

been a dominating sort of woman. As a child, Persephone re
members reading a story about a fairy who rode a donkey
around, beating him with a spoon. Inspired, she immediately
began riding her little brother around the house, whacking him
with a teaspoon.
Persephone tells me that she grew up in a Catholic Mexican
family in Irvine, California, where both her parents worked on
an orange grove. Persephone is, however, currently out of con-

tact with most of her family.
"I've been estranged from my mother for almost a decade now,
but my father is totally fine with it," she says. "My sisters and
brothers don't really like what 1 do. but they live in Mexico, so
I just don't seek them out. My mother is hoping that someday
God will shine a light on me, but...you know...l'm 35. By now.
I'm pretty numb about it. I have friends who are more like fam
ily."
Persephone has just purchased a new house in Michigan, where
she moved after her divorce to be with friends. She travels and
parties extensively in London, New York and L.A., but she

After transitioning from phone sex to exotic dancing,
Persephone began her career as a dominatrix by tak
ing an ad out in the local paper. Now, after 15 years
of domination, Persephone has a thorough un-

derstanding of the submissive male personality.
Although she takes clients of both genders, fe
male submissives are rare. Persephone tells

me that about 80 percent of her clients
are white-collar married men whose
wives are either unaware of their

sexual desires or unwilling to in
dulge them. She hints cryptically
that her clients have included
celebrities, Wall Street execs,
judges and other public figures.
But, as Persephone emphasizes,
privacy is an essential part of her
profession.
I ask Persephone about why she
thinks certain men are submis
sives. She tells me first about a
client who broke down and expe
rienced what Persephone called
"a regression to infancy," during
which he recalled having been
abused during childhood. Perse
phone spent the rest of the ses
sion "talking him out of it."
While Persephone views this par
ticular man's submission as being
trauma-related, she savs that sh

keeps a low profile in Michigan, where she's establishing
herself as inconspicuously as possible.

thinks most submissives are just naturally that way.
"Sometimes," she says, "1 think that some people
are just born with weird, kinky fetishes. 1 truly
think that some men are born to serve. They just
have it so ingrained in them that they could j

Gushing about her sprawling new home, Persephone says she
plans to convert the basement into her "dream dungeon." Her
current dungeon is, she specifies, not medieval-themed. The
room sounds more like an intcrrogation-room-meets-Hugh-
Hefner's-rec-room kind of place. The domination equipment
includes, "a St. Andrew's cross, bondage table, spanking bench,
leather sling, mummy sleep sack, hoods, cuffs, canes, crops,
electrical units, rope, bungee cords," etc. The surrounding en
vironment, however, sounds almost girly. The walls, Perse
phone says, are lined in black and pink velvet, and the furniture
is a glossy black and red. She sets the mood with candles and
"amber lamps" and plays "'60s exotica lounge music" during
sessions.
Persephone charges between $200 and $300 per hour, depend
ing on the city she's in. When in London, for instance, she dou
bles her rate (which seems like a criminally lucrative strategy,
given the current state of the dollar). Most sessions, she says, in
volve "riding crops, caning, flogging, cross-dressing, cock and
ball torture, strap-on play or being dressed up and treated like
a slut." She has an extensive wardrobe for sessions, which in
cludes "over 200 pairs of shoes and at least 300 corsets."
Persephone emphasizes that her profession is as much a mental
as a physical one. "You're a therapist also," she says. "You have
to console them when they're feeling depressed. You have to be
their advisor." She speaks tenderly about the attachment she
has with certain clients — she even dated one briefly. "Some
times there's just this exchange of energy that's really hard to
explain."

When she began college, Persephone hoped to obtain a psy
chology degree, but financial difficulties forced her drop out
in 1992. Persephone later heard about a female psych stu
dent who wrote her thesis on abnormal male sexuality and
did phone sex work for a year as part of her research. In
trigued, Persephone briefly became a phone sex worker.
"They liked really weird things like having me pop bal
loons on the phone."

"They love it when I'm really dressed up and I
dress them up like me," she says. "They
want to know what it's like to dress sex- A

never be happy unless a woman is completely controlling their
lives."
But she also chalks up some male submissive tendencies to so
cial pressures.
"In our society, men tend to be in control," she says. "They're
not happy with their wives putting them in charge, so they seek
someone out who is bossy and more aggressive and in control,
not just physically, but mentally and even financially."
Persephone regales me with stories of "blackmail fantasists"
who want to be blackmailed for protracted periods of time. She
also describes submissives who enjoy "slut treatment."

It's clear, however, that Persephone has no problem with ex- I
ploiting her own buxom femininity — she reflects that she gets I
"all the right attention that way." But at times she betrays fem- I
inist leanings. At one point she snaps sternly, "I'm of the opin- I
ion that if you're a woman and you can't support yourself, I
there's something wrong with you."
