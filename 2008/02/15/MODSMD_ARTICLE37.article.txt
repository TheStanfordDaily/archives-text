## "Maybe," Probably Not 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION SOURPUSS 
There is, out there in the vast
and ephemeral world of filmic en
tertainment, such a thing as a "col
lege" movie. A "college" movie, as
opposed to a "high school" movie,
an "adult" movie, or just a
"movie," is simply defined as a
movie that a college student would
want to pay $10 to see. A college
movie can come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, but tends either to
evoke nostalgia of a college stu
dent's childhood, continue a film
series that was seminal to the col
lege student's psychological devel
opment or speak to social or cultur
al issues to which the college stu
dent is particularly attuned. "The
Kite Runner" is an example of a
college movie, as is "Juno," as was
"Spider-Man 3." "Definitely,
Maybe" is not a college movie, for

several reasons.
Reason #1 that
Maybe" is not a
college movie:
It's a romantic
comedy.
College stu
dents don't have
a lot of money or
time to spend on
things like
movies, so, when
they do, they

Definitely

tend to want a movie that is enrich
ing, enlightening and fulfilling.
"Definitely, Maybe" is none of
those things; it's entertaining, sure,
but it's also frivolous and unrealis
tic and simply doesn't offer any
thing of value to the average col
lege student.
Which leads us to Reason #2:
The topics discussed in "Definitely,
Maybe" have little bearing on the
lives of college students. "Definite
ly, Maybe" is a movie about a thir
ty-something political speech
writer (Ryan Reynolds) who is in
the process of getting a divorce and
is learning to deal with shared cus
tody of his young daughter Maya
(Abigail Breslin of "Little Miss
Sunshine"). Apart from the few
young parents and scattered mar
ried couples among the Stanford
undergrad population (see "From
IHUM to i Do"' in the Nov. 5,
2007 edition of The Daily), not
many students can relate to that
storyline. And when you can't re
late to a movie on a fundamental
level, it's verv difficult to engage in

the story or empathize with the
characters.
It should be said, however, that
a certain amount of enjoyment can
be garnered from the idea that
"Definitely, Maybe" is a glimpse
into the future of the ambitious
young Stanford student. Will
Hayes is (for most of the movie, at
least) an ambitious and successful
career man who is becoming a play
er in New York politics while dat
ing a succession of beautiful
women and partying on Manhat
tan's Upper East Side. I can think
of more than a few of my friends for
whom that life represents the post
college dream. Of course, by the
end of the movie Will is divorced,
has been fired, is in a job that he
hates, and can only see his child on
the weekends, but we'll ignore that
for now. It still stands that that
lifestyle is enticing for many of the
promising youths of Stanford. In
fact, if the transition from college
to the real world and the difficulty

of making it on
the job market
were the focus of
the film, "Defi
nitely, Maybe"
might indeed
qualify as a col
lege movie. Un
fortunately for
the college stu-

dent, the movie
chooses to focus on Will Hayes's
romantic misadventures, and
therein lies Reason #3 that it is not
a college movie.
Reason #3: Not enough nudity.
"Definitely, Maybe" tries to toe the
line between family movie and
young-adult sex romp, and, for the
most part, it succeeds. The movie
presents a cast of characters who
hint enough at their partying ways
to seem cool but maintain a level of
responsibility and respectability
that keeps the movie appropriate
for all ages. "Definitely. Maybe"
goes for mass appeal, and it
achieves it: unfortunately, in doing
so it alienates those who aren't
much interested in the masses â€”
such as the college crowd.
"Definitely, Maybe" is not a bad
movie: the performances are solid,
there are a few genuine laughs and
it adds a little quirk to the roman
tic-comedy genre. Since this is the
Valentine's Day edition of Inter
mission. I suppose 1 can grudgingly
acknowledge that if your idea of a
successful Valentine's Dav is din

ner at the Cheesecake Factory fol
lowed by a quick and painless love
story, then "Definitely, Maybe" is
for you. However, considering you
can achieve the same effect by
checking out "Along Came Polly,"
"No Reservations" or about a mil
lion other rom-coms from the li

brary, I would suggest saving your
self the $20 and making it a night in.
