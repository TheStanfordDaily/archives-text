### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY INTERMISSION INTERVIEWER 
The eagerly anticipated and criti
cally acclaimed romantic comedy
"Definitely, Maybe" hits theatres
tonight. Intermission had the oppor
tunity to speak with writer and direc
tor Adam Brooks about the film dur
ing the lead-up to its release.
INT: What was your inspiration
for the movie?
AB: When 1 write, I don't think
about a lot of other movies — I like
to think about what 1 want to write
about. I wanted to tell a story of a
young man coming to the big city
with all his dreams and hopes. 1 think
the problem with romantic comedies
sometimes is that they focus too
much on the "boy-meets-girl" ele
ment and they don't create a real
world around it. When you're in your
20s. going into your 30s, there are two
main things going on: your work and
your love life. They weave in and out
of each other, and that's what I was
really interested in: telling that kind
of story over a period of years. You
get really involved with the charac
ters when a movie takes place over
time. And then you have Will tell this
story to his daughter, which makes it
an inside-out romantic comedy. It
creates this twist and love-story-mys
tery. But then it becomes very real: it
becomes about divorce and the tim
ing of love.
INT: Will Hayes's (Ryan
Reynolds) first job in New York is on
Bill Clinton's presidential campaign.
Why set the movie in the frame of the
1992 election?
AB: For a couple of reasons: I like
the idea of a character being idealis
tic, someone who, besides having
goals for himself, wanted to make a
difference in the world. And then 1
started thinking about how 1 wanted
to set this story over many years, and
the Clinton presidency was perfect,
because it started so hopefully. We
all were in love with him. but then it
was a very bumpy ride. There were a
lot of disappointments. And then you
have this sex element to it.and that
was a great analogy — it creates a
great backdrop. It fit Will's storv.
INT: Right before our eyes, we
see Will progress as a character. But
we also see Ryan Reynolds progress
as an actor. His early career was de
fined by slapstick comedies like Van
