# Definitely the Director

### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY INTERMISSION INTERVIEWER 
The eagerly anticipated and criti
cally acclaimed romantic comedy
"Definitely, Maybe" hits theatres
tonight. Intermission had the oppor
tunity to speak with writer and direc
tor Adam Brooks about the film dur
ing the lead-up to its release.
INT: What was your inspiration
for the movie?
AB: When 1 write, I don't think
about a lot of other movies — I like
to think about what 1 want to write
about. I wanted to tell a story of a
young man coming to the big city
with all his dreams and hopes. 1 think
the problem with romantic comedies
sometimes is that they focus too
much on the "boy-meets-girl" ele
ment and they don't create a real
world around it. When you're in your
20s. going into your 30s, there are two
main things going on: your work and
your love life. They weave in and out
of each other, and that's what I was
really interested in: telling that kind
of story over a period of years. You
get really involved with the charac
ters when a movie takes place over
time. And then you have Will tell this
story to his daughter, which makes it
an inside-out romantic comedy. It
creates this twist and love-story-mys
tery. But then it becomes very real: it
becomes about divorce and the tim
ing of love.
INT: Will Hayes's (Ryan
Reynolds) first job in New York is on
Bill Clinton's presidential campaign.
Why set the movie in the frame of the
1992 election?
AB: For a couple of reasons: I like
the idea of a character being idealis
tic, someone who, besides having
goals for himself, wanted to make a
difference in the world. And then 1
started thinking about how 1 wanted
to set this story over many years, and
the Clinton presidency was perfect,
because it started so hopefully. We
all were in love with him. but then it
was a very bumpy ride. There were a
lot of disappointments. And then you
have this sex element to it.and that
was a great analogy — it creates a
great backdrop. It fit Will's storv.
INT: Right before our eyes, we
see Will progress as a character. But
we also see Ryan Reynolds progress
as an actor. His early career was de
fined by slapstick comedies like Van
Wilder. This is his foray into a more
adult movie world. Do you think his
performance in "Definitely, Maybe"
establishes him with an older audi
ence?
All: I think so. I think he was tired
of all that other stuff, and he's made a
very concerted effort to change what
his career's about — it's very difficult
to do. When I met him, I found him to
be a really likeable, smart, passionate
guy. And as soon as you meet him,
you say, "You should be doing really
great, smart things."
There was something about him
that lined up with the character. He
has a lot of heart, and he's actually
quite idealistic in his politics and other
wants. He also has this quality where
he can be both real and funny — it's
not about doing slapstick, it's about
the funny that comes out of his char
acter.
INT: 1 think you see that both in his
interaction with his daughter (Abigail
Breslin) and his interactions with the
three female leads. They are three dif
ferent characters: you have the very

ambitious Summer (Rachel Weisz);
Emily (Elizabeth Banks), who you
are more in the dark with; and April
(Isla Fisher), who is more artsy and
eccentric. How did the casting work?
AB: I didn't want to cast anyone
until 1 cast Will, because that charac
ter is in every scene in the movie. It's
all about the balance of stuff, so it
would be ridiculous to cast anyone be
fore we cast Will. 1 met with Isla Fish
er, and I wasn't expecting anything. I
couldn't tell from "Wedding Crash
ers" — 1 knew she was great in it. but
1 didn't know that she would fit right
into this movie. I just had an instinct
about it — sometimes it can be kind
of scary. She had April inside of her,
so we went for it. It was different with
Elizabeth Banks: I had seen her in a
lot of movies, I met with her, we dis
cussed the script, and it felt very easy
to make that decision. Same with
Rachel — it was easy to offer the
movie to her. She had the power,
strength and dedication to play that
part.
INT: The actor that blew me away

throughout the movie was Kevin
Kline. It was more of a cameo role for
him, but it seemed like he stole what
ever scene he was in. He was very
funny, very dry and a bit dark.
AB: And that part is meant to do
that. It's a very showy part. He's so dy
namic. and we don't get to see him be
funny anymore. He was the first per
son I offered it to, and he turned me
down four times before he said yes.
He turns down everything — his nick
name is "Kevin Decline." I kept call
ing him back and eventually he
changed his mind and said yes. I en
couraged him to have fun with it, to be
a big character, and he went with it.
He was inventive and he was funny —
I was thrilled that he did it.
INT: How long did it take to write
the script?
SB: This took longer than usual. 1
didn't outline the story, which is
something I would normally do. 1 did
n't work out the meat of the plot — I
didn't know who Will would end up
with. I knew the basic premise was
him and three women, and soon 1 fig
ured out that he should tell this story
to his daughter, with a crisis in his
modern day family — a divorce —
happening at the same time. And then
1 just let myself discover it. Usually a
first draft will take me three months.
This took me seven to eight months.
There were a lot of detours, and a lot
of false starts and stops. It was like
doing it without a safety net, but the
great thing was that it kept surprising
me as I wrote it. I'm really happy I
wrote it that way.

INI": How has the leadup to the
movie's release been?
AB: It's nerve-racking. Anyone
could say anything they want about
you. I've worked on this thing for
three years, and in the course of the
next two weeks, anyone can say any
thing they want about me and what 1
do. They could say I'm a no-talent
loser. They could say the movie is bril
liant, or they can say it's dull and bor
ing. That's one thing you dread. Then
there's this enormous expectation.
You've made this movie that costs $25
million dollars, and you want it to do

well, and you want people to go see it.
It's terrifying that you work so long on
a movie, and if the first weekend does
n't go so well, you're done. That's
what's exhausting: the anticipation of
what's going to happen. It's exciting,
hut you don't want to get too opti
mistic.
INT: I read a review by the Times
in London that said it's the best ro
mantic comedy since "Annie Hall."
Do you think it lives up to that?
AB: 1 know, it's crazy. I'm thrilled
that someone is that enthused about
it.
