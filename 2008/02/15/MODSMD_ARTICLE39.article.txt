cash in on love, the chatter as
friends gossip about love, the over
enthusiastic dorm couple making
their own brand of love. Regardless
of whether you are enchanted or
embittered. Valentine's Day de
mands its own soundtrack.
Perhaps you can pick a song to
be your single, or if you're more
ambitious, put together a five-song
EP. In preparation for Valentine's,
however. I would like to present a
two-disc compilation of music: an
A-side of love and a B-side loathing
love.
Opening with the words "I was
crying over you," the Finley
Quaye's "Dice" begins in a some
what surprising manner for a love
song: its overtly cautious repetition
of electronic undertones at best
slowly diverges into a melody. Un
like the sappy pop of typical love
songs, there's a somewhat guarded
monotony about "Dice" that one
docs not expect. Yet Quaye's real
repetition comes in his chorus,
where "'nothing can compare" to
the declaration of a love for him.
The unbecoming, if appealing,
melody removes the brow-raising
cliche of these lyrics. It is precisely
this that makes "Dice" a successful
tune for even cynics in love.

Other songs feature a similar
contrast. The Cake Sale's "Some
Surprise," a duet between Lisa
Hannigan and Snow Patrol's Gary
Lightbody, makes a simple trio out
of a guitar and two voices. Moving
away from the somewhat over
whelming declarations of love,
Hannigan and Lightbody focus on a
specific moment: a kiss that comes
in "some surprise." Due to minor
instrumental accompaniment, this
is a song that possesses a lighter
quality and tends more toward the
harmlessly adorable.
if more traditional music is re
quired, there are always the classics
to look back on. Rod Stewart's
"You Go To My Head" is quite an
epitome of romance, with lyrics em
bodying a good mix of poetry and
cheese. (Michael Buble writes in
"Everything" in a similarly adulato
ry vein: his girl is a "falling star," a
"getaway car.")
For a twist on the traditional, try
also Flat Pack's take on the ever
loved "Sweet Child o' Mine"
(remixed by Mylo Club, originally
by Guns 'n' Roses). The introduc
tion of electronica and a floaty vo
calist make for the best kind of club
hit, to dance along to in your room
with a special somebody.

If you're tired of Valentine's,
cynical, still (or suddenly) single,
the B-side would perhaps be a bet
ter option.
Dedicated to a somewhat fright
ening object of love. Crooked Fin
ger's "Doctors of Deliverance" de
fies its own cliches. Despite the
"buried heart" and the "hopes and
dreams," a single of line of lyrical
genius stands out. "Killingly clad,
you went killing me sadly / Un
leashed in the light, you cheated
and won." Certainly despite the be
trayal, being "killingly clad" as one
does it is the way to go!
Also written in defiance arc the
songs by Electrico and Coheed &
Cambria. The first, though still de
siring a lover who is never there,
"just wants to see the weather." The
second warns that despite being
"invited," there's no way in hell the
girl is actually stepping through his
door.
With similar charm. The Howl
ing Bells, moves away from pining
altogether. Instead, they openly
state, "God only knows what you do
with yourself...you steal all your
moves."
Despite a certain amount of sad
ness, anger or mockery, there's al
ways an element of wit in these

words that remind us to keep our
chins up as couples snog and slob
ber on the street-side corner. If
Valentine's Day isn't about getting
action, then perhaps it can be an oc
casion to get some music, plug in
and chill out in the sun.
