## Lucas talks safe-sex, AIDS and controversy Adult film star answers questions about beliefs 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
About 50 students gathered for a
lively, candid discussion with gay
pornographic actor, activist and entre
preneur Michael Lucas last night.
During a lengthy question and answer
session, students inquired about his
personal views and challenged him on
his controversial beliefs.
All of Lucas' films in the past
decade have featured condoms, a deci
sion Lucas said has had negative finan
cial consequences.
"People never fantasize about sex
with condoms." he said. "It's no secret
that sex without condoms is much more
pleasurable. But I have always pre
ferred to make less money and send the
right message. Seeing beautiful men
enjoying each other while using con
doms makes [viewers] think."
