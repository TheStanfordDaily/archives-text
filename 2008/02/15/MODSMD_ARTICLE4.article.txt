## Lucas talks safe-sex, AIDS and controversy Adult film star answers questions about beliefs 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
About 50 students gathered for a
lively, candid discussion with gay
pornographic actor, activist and entre
preneur Michael Lucas last night.
During a lengthy question and answer
session, students inquired about his
personal views and challenged him on
his controversial beliefs.
All of Lucas' films in the past
decade have featured condoms, a deci
sion Lucas said has had negative finan
cial consequences.
"People never fantasize about sex
with condoms." he said. "It's no secret
that sex without condoms is much more
pleasurable. But I have always pre
ferred to make less money and send the
right message. Seeing beautiful men
enjoying each other while using con
doms makes [viewers] think."

Michael Lucas discussed sexual health and
AIDS prevention in the adult film industry
and responded to claims that his views on
Islam are intolerant.
In his 12 years in the adult entertain
ment business, Lucas said, there was
never an incident of a condom breaking.
"After having sex more often and with
more partners than most people, I can
only attribute my negative HIV status to
always using a condom when it comes to
sex," he said.
He refuted student remarks about the
possibility of AIDS transmission despite
condom use.
"It's not possible to get AIDS when
you have a condom on," Lucas said. "It's
not an easily transmitted virus."
He added that he does not ask partners
or performers about their HIV status
because it is both private and pointless.
"It's incredibly cruel to people who
have AIDS," he said. "If someone has
AIDS. I should fire him? I should deny
him the right to work for me?"
In response to a question about the
relation between pornography and sexu

al violence, Lucas emphasized that gay
pornography does not lead to violence.
"I think it can only serve very good
purposes, such as sexual education," he
said. "In general, porn saves people from
lots of trouble. It's good for the economy.
Very often, when you are on a business
trip, you don't have time to run out to the

bar and bring someone to a hotel room, so
in that way pornography can be very
handy."
Lucas also discussed his anti-Muslim
sentiments — opinions that drew contro
versy from some students before the
event.
"What's the point to respect their cul
ture, or supposed culture, when they have
a strong contempt for mine?" Lucas said.
"I have a problem with people separating
terrorists from the world that breeds
them, from the world that originates
them, which is the world of Islam."
Lucas contested student comments
that he was generalizing about certain
communities.
"I don't generalize — a fact is a fact."
Lucas said. "1 am definitely not a racist if
I'm telling you the truth.The Muslim com
munity is much more homophobic than
the black community, the black communi
ty is much more homophobic than the

white community — and there are rea
sons for that."
Brian Rodriguez '06. formerly the
director of the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center (SHPRC), said he
agreed with Lucas' sexual health mes
sages, but was disappointed with the way
Lucas approached issues of race, culture
and religion.
"I came in rooting for him. thinking
maybe he'd be different than The Daily
portrayed him," Rodriguez said. "But he
ended up disappointing me."
Some students also felt that his views
regarding the effectiveness of condom use
were misinformed.
"He was just slightly hypocritical," said
Ben Robinson '08. "saying you need to be
educated, but that you can't get AIDS
usinii a condom."
