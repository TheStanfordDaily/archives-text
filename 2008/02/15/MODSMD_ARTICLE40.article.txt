# Preventing Breakups, One Track at a Time
## 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION TEFLON MAN 
I've never been dumped. Sure, I've

dumped a lot of girls
in my day, hut never
have 1 been on the re
ceiving end. Why is
this, you ask? Why
can the ladies never
bring themselves to
walk out that door no
matter how long it's
been since 1 last
called? Because girls
love my playlists.
You see, even if, in
the distant future,
some girl goes against
her own rational self
interest and tries to
leave me, I am pre
pared. I will just non
chalantly play some
music from my '80s
style boom box out
side of her window,
and she'll come rush
ing back into my
arms, sobbing tears of
shame and joy. It's
that simple.

Here is a list of songs that no guy should be

without, just in case they have to avert a
break-up at the last second.

"I'd Rather Dance With You" — Kings of
Convenience: This song has it all: pop violins,

stiff cadcncc, Norwe
gian accents and the
right attitude toward
romance. Its message
is dead-on, and not
too distant from my
own: guys talk too
much and act too lit
tle. But not these
guys — these Kings
are hip-shaking men
of action! They don't
want to chat because
that's lame and com
mon. They just want
to groove and let
their bodies commu
nicate.
Consider this bit
of seductive musing:
"Even if 1 could hear
what you said/ I
doubt my reply would
be interesting for you
to hear/ Because 1
haven't read a single
book on you/ I'd

rather dance than talk with you." So, guys,
your girlfriend tries to leave you? Take con

trol and dance your way hack into her heart.
"Iron Man" — Black Sahhath: This classic
slice of stoner rock is a lover's dream. Throb
bing with distortion, moving at the pace of
Birmingham industrial sludge and telling
some story about a giant robot, "Iron Man"
should be the song that everybody plays at
their weddings as the bride walks down the
aisle. A must-have for any potentially roman
tic occasion.
"Straight Down" — The Glands: The
Glands were a good band from the late 1990s
that never got their proper due. But they did
know romance. This song shouts loud and
clear one fact and one fact alone: Confusion is
the essence of attraction. Maintain ambiguity
and mystery, guys, and soon you'll be fending
off the chicks. The Glands are great at confus
ing people. In this 2000 indie rock song, they
utter these immortal words: "See a lady with
the poodle/ It's the color of tomato/ In a bad
way." You get it now? No? Exactly.
The Thundercats theme song: "Hear the
magic/ Hear the roar." Need I say more?
"The Electric Slide" — Marcia Griffiths
and Bunny Wailer: Some of my most roman
tic memories are from my middle school
dances doing The Electric Slide. The way that
your feet slide across the floor, the way that a
girl's hair looks as she slides to the left and
claps her hands. If you play this track, the girl
can only do one thing: what the song tells her
to do.

"This is Hardcore" — Pulp: This song is a
little sleazy, a little disturbing and thoroughly
awesome: kind of like the perfect relation
ship. Pulp builds this song around a menacing
horn-line and some monster drums. Just
don't pay too close attention to the lyrics, and
you'll love this track.
Live in fear no more, guys. Once you have
compiled this playlist, no girl would ever dare
leave you. No matter how much you tease
her, forget to call her, take her out on cheap
dates or generally neglect the romantic side
of life, you will always this secret weapon to
fall back on.
