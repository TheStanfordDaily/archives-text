## Why does speed dating feel 50 dirty? 
### SIMONE NYX 
[Ed. Note: This piece of original fiction kicks off a new
Intermission section featuring original creative writing by
Stanford students.]
It was a Saturday night. I walked in, following two
ladies with long flowing hair. I felt a bit clunky behind
them. I was tense, but Eddie held the door open as we
filed in line to get our nametags. Eddie struck me as a big
teddy bear, with his round tan face. He was loose and re
laxed, as he commented in his chirpy French accent, "Is
this like a club or something? We have to wait in line to
get in?" We were given packets of profiles and nametags.
Then there was some schmoozing by the cheese and
grapes, and then we got down to business.
We sat down in a spiral configuration. The men would
hop chairs every three minutes, while the women stayed
glued in their chairs. We had a packet of profiles, and we
could cross people off or circle names and we would
know our matches by the end of the night.
It started with a History grad student. Then three min
utes later, there was a boy who looked oddly familiar in
his pleather jacket. He'd sold me a chair a year ago off
Craigslist! He was quick to ask me, "What are you doing
after this?"
But they kept coming, like musical chairs — bam bam
bam next man man man.
And then there was Jean. I guessed where he was from
and what he studied. There was one guess that I kept to
myself — I had to remind myself that this person would
possibly want to date me, not shop or gossip with me.
And then there was the typical geek, his collared flan
nel shirt tucked in as he hunched over the packet study
ing my profile while I stared bemusedly at him.
By the time Eddie rolled around, I was ready to /.one
out and stared at his choker. "I like your choker." I said.
He took it as flirtation and proceeded to lean in close so
that I could touch it while he continued the conversation
in French.
Then there was David, who came over to sit down,
and, as he did, I just sighed and tactlessly sputtered, "So,
where to start? What should I ask you?"
So that you can imagine what kind of character you
arc speed dating through, I will tell you that I am not ex

actly a hot blonde. Well, I have dark hair, hut that's not
the point: I guess if you could see me, you'd see a warm
smile. I release tension with laughter, so in this case, 1
laughed a lot. 1 laughed as they switched seats. 1 laughed
as they sat down, I even let out little smirks as they
seemed over-enthusiastic to ask me what 1 am doing with
my life, or whether 1 would mix spaghetti with sauce.
Well, light-heartedness got me through the night, but
by the end, it couldn't rescue me. I was onto my last three
minute session. Ethan sat across from me — looking a bit
drained and weary — we were each other's last three
minute rendezvous; the last of 40 such exchanges.
"Hi, welcome to my chair!" 1 announced, laughing.
"Hey," he said.
"Wine probably isn't good for having good breath,"

he commented.
"Neither is cheese," I pointed out

And even though we both felt the drudgery, in vain we
found ourselves falling into the "So where are you from?
What do you do?" questions.
But whereas throughout most of the night there would
be a chime after three minutes, since this was the last ex
change, there was no bell.

I looked around, a sense of accomplishment in
knowing that I had gone through so many men, but
also a sense of anger that I had not found an object of

desire.

"So, you find anyone you wanna hook up
with?" Ethan asked.
And then I turned to him like a longtime pal.
I shrugged my head, "Naw. You? There are lots
more good-looking women, though."
"Really? Like who?" he challenged.

I jabbed my elbow toward a woman adjacent
to me. I le shrugged, no.
"Well, the girl directly behind you, the straw
berry blonde?" I said.
"Looks like a bird," he said. I laughed, my
third-grader sense tickled, my feminist sense ap-

palled.
"You arc so mean!" 1 slapped the air. "Well," I recov
ered, "1 think she looks sweet."
"But not the kind you could fall in love with," he said,
his chin tilted toward me.
He looked at me straight on. "But 1 think you're cute."
"Thanks," 1 chuckled.
Then there was an awkward pause.
I continued to sit there. Ethan remained slumped for
ward and gazed up at me intermittently. Why didn't 1 get
up and leave? Finally 1 got up. It was a party and I have

made lots of friends. But have I? 1 mean —
no one really came here looking for just a
friend. 1 passed by Gael, who held out a
bunch of grapes and offered to feed me.
I strode out the door and averted my
eyes. 1 will now make my exit — alone!

I had gone to the speed dating as a
'What the hell, why not?" kind of social ex
periment. 1 had NO intention of finding
my bashert or prince charming or soul
mate. Just maybe meet some people, sec
what people think of me...

"Phewf!" 1 sighed with relief! I
plopped into the driver's scat and
slammed the car door. Ahhh! What
was that? All those strange looks,
all the subliminal offers, the ques-

tions. What did I get out of that?
Do I regret it?

Thank God I am indepen
dent!!!! I thought, as I hit the gas
and sped home. But then, slowly. I
felt a strange wave of sadness
wash through me. Maybe I am

searching for some
thing.! thought.
Maybe I tint

searching
for some
one.

So that you can imagine what kind of character you
arc speed dating through, I will tell you that I am not ex

actly a hot blonde. Well, I have dark hair, hut that's not
the point: I guess if you could see me, you'd see a warm
smile. I release tension with laughter, so in this case, 1
laughed a lot. 1 laughed as they switched seats. 1 laughed
as they sat down, I even let out little smirks as they
seemed over-enthusiastic to ask me what 1 am doing with
my life, or whether 1 would mix spaghetti with sauce.
Well, light-heartedness got me through the night, but
by the end, it couldn't rescue me. I was onto my last three
minute session. Ethan sat across from me — looking a bit
drained and weary — we were each other's last three
minute rendezvous; the last of 40 such exchanges.
"Hi, welcome to my chair!" 1 announced, laughing.
"Hey," he said.
"Wine probably isn't good for having good breath,"

he commented.
"Neither is cheese," I pointed out

And even though we both felt the drudgery, in vain we
found ourselves falling into the "So where are you from?
What do you do?" questions.
But whereas throughout most of the night there would
be a chime after three minutes, since this was the last ex
change, there was no bell.

I looked around, a sense of accomplishment in
knowing that I had gone through so many men, but
also a sense of anger that I had not found an object of

desire.

"So, you find anyone you wanna hook up
with?" Ethan asked.
And then I turned to him like a longtime pal.
I shrugged my head, "Naw. You? There are lots
more good-looking women, though."
"Really? Like who?" he challenged.

I jabbed my elbow toward a woman adjacent
to me. I le shrugged, no.
"Well, the girl directly behind you, the straw
berry blonde?" I said.
"Looks like a bird," he said. I laughed, my
third-grader sense tickled, my feminist sense ap-

palled.
"You arc so mean!" 1 slapped the air. "Well," I recov
ered, "1 think she looks sweet."
"But not the kind you could fall in love with," he said,
his chin tilted toward me.
He looked at me straight on. "But 1 think you're cute."
"Thanks," 1 chuckled.
Then there was an awkward pause.
I continued to sit there. Ethan remained slumped for
ward and gazed up at me intermittently. Why didn't 1 get
up and leave? Finally 1 got up. It was a party and I have

made lots of friends. But have I? 1 mean —
no one really came here looking for just a
friend. 1 passed by Gael, who held out a
bunch of grapes and offered to feed me.
I strode out the door and averted my
eyes. 1 will now make my exit — alone!

I had gone to the speed dating as a
'What the hell, why not?" kind of social ex
periment. 1 had NO intention of finding
my bashert or prince charming or soul
mate. Just maybe meet some people, sec
what people think of me...

"Phewf!" 1 sighed with relief! I
plopped into the driver's scat and
slammed the car door. Ahhh! What
was that? All those strange looks,
all the subliminal offers, the ques-

tions. What did I get out of that?
Do I regret it?

Thank God I am indepen
dent!!!! I thought, as I hit the gas
and sped home. But then, slowly. I
felt a strange wave of sadness
wash through me. Maybe I am

searching for some
thing.! thought.
Maybe I tint

searching
for some
one.
