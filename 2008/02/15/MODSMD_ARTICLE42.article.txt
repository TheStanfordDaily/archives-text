### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION MISTRESS 
Roxy's pro-torture. But only the
good, consensual kind. There's

horizons and adding
some shackling up to your shacking up, read on. Roxy's put
together a little guide on bondage for those of you who
think that nothing says"I love you" quite like tying up and
whipping your Valentine.

Safety First. Roxy recommends having a safe
word in case things get too much (not always a had
thing). "Stop" is a very bad choice. It's easily con

fused with "*grunt*, *moan*, ...don't stop," not
to mention that Roxy sometimes likes to resist
during role-play. So piek something more in- I
congruous; Roxy's is "Humphrey" for rea-

sons that she'll only explain if you promise
to spank her.

Discuss Beforehand. Roxy's an adventur
ous girl. She likes to mix it up in the bedroom
(and the hall, and the kitchen, and the bath
room, and the library, and the...). But while
she likes being surprised as much as the

next girl (or even by the next girl) she
suggests that BDSM adventur

ing the strapping down and
the tying up. Everyone has i
different limits and differ- I
cnt desires; find some com- 1
mon ground before surpris- '
ing your lover with a gimp
suit.

Tools of the trade. While it is possible to get by with a
few scarves and a flat palm. Roxy firmly believes that half
the fun is in the shopping:
Restraints: The key to successful bondage is having
good restraints (this covers shackles, handcuffs, etc.). Un
fortunately, the best restraints are often expensive and in
volve bolting things to walls or furniture. Roxy's solution is
to use the fantastic "Under-the-Bed" restraint system avail
able from the best store in the world ("Good Vibrations")
— it slips under your mattress and provides cuffs for ankles
and wrists, keeping you anticipatorily spread-eagled.
Blindfolds: Roxy's is leather on the outside and furry on
the inside. Mmmmmmmm.
Whips, crops, paddles: Roxy's drunk the Kool Aid when
it comes to pain and pleasure. In no particular order, here
are a few favorite things with which to strike and be struck.

Cowhide flogger — many straps bound together; can
tickle, lightly smack, leave a mark or anything in be
tween. Leather paddle — when you want more of a

sting. Wartenberg Pin Wheel — a spiky wheel
that looks dangerous and feels like nothing else.

Things that go buzzzzzz: Roxy has noticed that boys
get tired (one reason to keep girls around instead). One
way to alleviate this and get some more variety is to
L make sure you have a healthy collection of vibra-

tors, dildos and the like, to hand. Roxy has her fa
l vorites. but mostly she recommends a diverse
fey collection. Also, boys, Roxy had a mind-blow-

ing evening with a nice young man and his vi
brating cock ring a little while back — so if
you really want to give that special some-

one a treat for Valentine's Day...

Being tied up, whipped and probed
until she's begging for more, less and
k everything in between is Roxy's fa-

voritemost activity. But above all
else, she urges you to remem-

her Humphrey.
