## Mars workshop launched Aeronautic experts look to send humans to red planet 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Maybe the quad's red-tiled roofs had
something to do with it. but the fifty aero
space experts meeting at Stanford this
week just could not stop talking about the
red planet.
A resolve to put humans on Mars was
the result of a two-day workshop co-hosted
by the space interest group the Planetary
Society and the Stanford Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, in spite of

sharp criticism from NASA.
NASA Administrator Michael Griffin
has been personally critical of the work
shop and its goals, arguing, "the questions
to be raised at this conference have
[already] been asked and answered."
The organizers of the conference did
not have many kind words for Griffin and
the current state of affairs in Cape
Canaveral.
"Where NASA is today, in the imple
mentation of the vision and the other
things that it is chartered to do, has led us
to a point where the nation's space pro
gram is in peril," said workshop organizer
Scott Hubbard, consulting professor at
Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics and
former director of NASA's Ames
Research Laboratory.
A major source of conflict
between the workshop attendees and
NASA lies with the future of human
presence on the moon. While NASA
has been pushing for a long-term out
post on the moon, the workshop
group insisted that the moon only be
used as a stepping stone to Mars.
"We really emphasized that [the
moon] should be at most a research
outpost that leads us on to Mars,"
Hubbard said. "We had a consensus
that Mars is up there as our next
major destination for people."
Hie workshop's overwhelming
desire to get to Mars over the moon
has irked Griffin and NASA.
"I regard that as foolish, frankly"
Griffin told Aviation Week in
response to pre-conference rumors
that the workshop favored skipping
the moon and heading straight to
Mars. "The moon is three days and a
quarter-million miles from home.
When we return to the moon, we will
have not been there for 50 years."
Perhaps because of the heavy crit
icism levied by Griffin before the
workshop, not all involved were as
anti-moon as previously suggested.

"I came here as a Mars direct pro
ponent. but I have changed my
mind," said workshop organizer
Kathryn Thornton, a former astro
naut. "The moon as a stepping point is
a prudent decision. I didn't recognize
that before I came here."
But drumming up political sup
port for the space program, domesti
cally and internationally, was the
biggest reason the workshop organiz
ers were so adamant about getting to
Mars.
"It is my view that if you want to
get political support. Mars must be
there," said Executive Director of The
Planetary Society Louis Friedman,
the third organizer of the workshop.
"The French president. Sarkozy,
called for an international collabora
tion on going to Mars for the space
faring nations. That's remarkable."
Instead of launching a Soviet-era
competition, Friedman emphasized
the need for cooperation with other
space-faring nations.
"It was the consensus of the room
that there is no space-race that should
be or could be invoked as a reason to
drive us to additional budget and
additional speed in any of these pro
grams," Friedman said. "There is a
strong geopolitical interest in nations
working together."

The political benefits of a collabo
rative mission to Mars were cited by
the organizers as even more impor
tant than the scientific merits of the
project.
"It was extraordinary that this
group would agree that human explo
ration should be taken for national
and international interests," Hubbard
said. "The group, which represented
all these points of views, was remark
ably cohesive. Even the scientists said
that human exploration is what we
do, science goes along."
The group identified several fac
tors contributing to the poor per
formance of President Bush's 2004
vision to send people to the moon
and then Mars, a project recently
dubbed "Constellation."
"There are three ways to fix this
bind we're in — you can change the
schedule, you can change the budget
or you can change the requirements,"
Hubbard said. "You're probably
going to end up changing all three."
Increasing NASA's budget was a
major topic of concern for the group.
"It is a historical fact that with a
few exceptions NASA has been
asked to do more with less for the last
20 years." Hubbard said. "NASA's
budget is short on something of the
order of 3 billion a year."

The organizers, however, were
careful to avoid explicitly demanding
a big slice of the already bloated fed
eral budget.
"The important point is that the
consensus was [that] you're not talk
ing about doubling NASA's budget to
do everything that is mandated,"
Hubbard said.
"NASA is 0.6 percent of the budg
et — what we recommend would not
take it to 0.7 percent," Friedman
added.
NASA's heavy criticism of the
workshop virtually guarantees that its
findings will not be implemented
under the current administration.
Instead, the organizers hope to
influence the presidential candidates
and influence the next
Administration's space policy —
aides to Senators Obama (D-IL) and
Clinton (D-NY) were in attendance.
"We very carefully couched all of
our output as consensus statements
aimed at the next administration,"
Hubbard said. "The next budget will
be prepared by a new administration;
we are trying very hard to not make
this a critique, but a statement of
where we are going from here."

ration should be taken for national
and international interests," Hubbard
said. "The group, which represented
all these points of views, was remark
ably cohesive. Even the scientists said
that human exploration is what we
do, science goes along."
The group identified several fac
tors contributing to the poor per
formance of President Bush's 2004
vision to send people to the moon
and then Mars, a project recently
dubbed "Constellation."
"There are three ways to fix this
bind we're in — you can change the
schedule, you can change the budget
or you can change the requirements,"
Hubbard said. "You're probably
going to end up changing all three."
Increasing NASA's budget was a
major topic of concern for the group.
"It is a historical fact that with a
few exceptions NASA has been
asked to do more with less for the last
20 years." Hubbard said. "NASA's
budget is short on something of the
order of 3 billion a year."

The organizers, however, were
careful to avoid explicitly demanding
a big slice of the already bloated fed
eral budget.
"The important point is that the
consensus was [that] you're not talk
ing about doubling NASA's budget to
do everything that is mandated,"
Hubbard said.
"NASA is 0.6 percent of the budg
et — what we recommend would not
take it to 0.7 percent," Friedman
added.
NASA's heavy criticism of the
workshop virtually guarantees that its
findings will not be implemented
under the current administration.
Instead, the organizers hope to
influence the presidential candidates
and influence the next
Administration's space policy —
aides to Senators Obama (D-IL) and
Clinton (D-NY) were in attendance.
"We very carefully couched all of
our output as consensus statements
aimed at the next administration,"
Hubbard said. "The next budget will
be prepared by a new administration;
we are trying very hard to not make
this a critique, but a statement of
where we are going from here."
