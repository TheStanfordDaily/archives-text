# M transports you to another
■I ■ I world." says MicahCratty '08.
"It's touch with a voice," says Jonah Willihn
ganz. a lecturer in the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR).
"It's been around as long as there have been
people on earth." says Andrea Lunsford. director
of PWR.
The art of storytelling has found a new home
in the Stanford Storytelling Project. The project,
the brainchild of Willihnganz. launched Nov. 5
and airs every Monday from 6 to 7 p.m. on KZSU,
Stanford's student-run radio station. Podcasts on
Stanford iTunes are also available for prospective
listeners.
Willihnganz studies the relationship between
literature and radio. In exploring this topic, his
conversations with other scholars revealed a
great interest in public radio storytelling pro
grams such as "This American Eife."
"1 began to think about how much really good
storytelling there was at Stanford, and not just in
the writing program." Willihnganz says. "We
wanted to find a way to share these stories in
some way that wasn't a live event — all of us are
so busy that we can barely make it to a live event."
Willihnganz hired two students already in
volved in KZSU. Micah C'ratty '08 and Bonnie
Swift 08. to serve as senior producers. Last sum
mer, the trio scoured archives of audio essays and
short stories and began selecting material for
their first few episodes. Now. the team solicits
story submissions.
Each show has a theme, such as "Approaching
Africa" or "Living in the Panopticon," and con
sists of several pieces from different genres, such
as fiction, memoir and audio journalism.
Goals for the project include promoting the
art of storytelling on campus as well as providing
an outlet for creativity.
"We have some good literary magazines,
there's The Daily, but there's nothing really for
sound or for oral expression on campus." Crattv
says."This is a different outlet that doesn't exist in
any other form at Stanford."
Doree Allen, director of the Oral Communi
cation Program, admires how the project com
bines science, literature, drama, sociology and
more.
"It's just the quintessential interdisciplinary
activity," she says.
Although assistant producer Charlie Mint/.
'10 didn't have prior experience with radio, he
found himself drawn to the project.
"1 like telling stories, I like writing stories —
this just kind of combined those experiences," he
says.
The students who work on the project say they
are avid fans of radio and the sonic experience it
creates.
"It exercises a different part of the brain."
Swift savs. "You reallv have to use your imagina

tion when you listen to the radio, and ! think
there's something inherently engaging about
that."
To Willihnganz. hearing a story is more inti
mate than reading one on the printed page.
"When you hear a voice, you feel like you're
being touched," he says.
Using the voice well.adds Cratty. is essential to
an effective radio program.
"If you're not using sound well, there's no
point, because it's quicker to read a story or scan
an article," he says. "So there has to be a payoff.
People are investing their time to listen to you, so
it really has to do something that the printed word
can't do and that is connect on an emotional
level."
What makes a great story?
To Willihnganz, all stories on the show share a
certain kind of wisdom.
"The stories are there to educate the spirit, not
educate us in terms of having skills to go out in the
workforce," he says. "Like a liberal education, a
humanities education, it's about growing as a per
son. We try to be entertaining and enlightening,
but not useful."
For Swift, the project is all about turning the
ordinarv into the extraordinary.

Everybody has a story, but
we often don't have time to
11
get them from each other.

BONNIE SWIFT, '08 Stanford Storytelling Proiect

"We want to put a twist on things, so that
things you would ordinarily take for granted you
see in a new light," she says.
Lunsford emphasizes the inherent power of
oral storytelling. "It gives a different sense of
working with language," she says. "Spoken, lived
language is just different than language that's
committed to the page only."
For a Valentine's Day episode this past Mon

day, producers set up a table in White Plaza
last week to collect stories about love from
passers-by — an approach that gets to the
heart of the project.
"Everybody has a story." Swift says, "but
we often don't have time to get them from
each other."
