My landlady
Xia Ayi has

from the sec

days now to go out to the
markets and find a fuzi to
hang on my door for good
luck. Considering the

quantity of explosives she
has stored for this week, it
would only be foolish to dis-

obey. It's the second week of the Year of
the Rat; the Chinese Spring Festival
kicked off over a week ago and still I can

see through my window children and gleeful
old men lighting bundles of red fireworks that
send popping gunshots through the streets.
I've been living in Yangshuo, China, a village
about ten hours south of Shanghai by train and
1 about ten hours north of Hanoi. Vietnam, for
two weeks now and I plan on staying a few
months. Until this year my closest interactions

involved one quarter of Chinese blood, dim sum
in San Francisco with my Chinese-American
friends and skimming the Ã¼biquitous Economist
and Times "the Asian tigers are rising again" ti
tles printed in fear-inducing red ink that clutter
newsstands these days. With a strong sense that
my knowledge was insufficient, I decided to
take a year off from university to study Man

this country that is changing the world.

consider me a Grinch of a tenant lacking holiday

Chinese character that means wealth, happiness
and good luck that people hang on their doors as
decoration for the New Year. This morning, my
neighbors are creating a particularly noisy spec
tacle. They keep chickens in a little coop in the
stairwell, and they are now selecting the choic
est hens to prepare for tonight s supper. Two of
the chosen ones are lying in a heap of feathers
and scaly feet on an edition of the daily newspa
per, obstructing my path down to the road. The
old woman and her husband kindly nudge the
fallen poultry to the side and I wish them a

happy new year.
Yangshuo is still small enough that 1 have
only been out for about an hour and I've run
into all of my new friends here. Officially, Yang
shuo has a population of about 300,000, but this
includes all of the surrounding outskirts and
county villages. So in town, people's faces get to
be pretty familiar. Songs have been written and
scrolls painted for this town for centuries in
China. It has long been a home of renowned
poets and is famous for the scenery known as
sfumshui. mountains and water, which it amply
provides.
