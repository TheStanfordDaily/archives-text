# Trip to China sparks cultural awakening

### ALLYSON W. STEWART 
My landlady
Xia Ayi has
been bellow
ing up to me
from the sec
ond floor for
days now to go out to the
markets and find a fuzi to
hang on my door for good
luck. Considering the

quantity of explosives she
has stored for this week, it
would only be foolish to dis-

obey. It's the second week of the Year of
the Rat; the Chinese Spring Festival
kicked off over a week ago and still I can

see through my window children and gleeful
old men lighting bundles of red fireworks that
send popping gunshots through the streets.
I've been living in Yangshuo, China, a village
about ten hours south of Shanghai by train and
1 about ten hours north of Hanoi. Vietnam, for
two weeks now and I plan on staying a few
months. Until this year my closest interactions

fourth largest sovereign territory in the world,
involved one quarter of Chinese blood, dim sum
in San Francisco with my Chinese-American
friends and skimming the übiquitous Economist
and Times "the Asian tigers are rising again" ti
tles printed in fear-inducing red ink that clutter
newsstands these days. With a strong sense that
my knowledge was insufficient, I decided to
take a year off from university to study Man
darin Chinese and try and get to know firsthand
this country that is changing the world.
Taking Xia Ayi's demands seriously lest she
consider me a Grinch of a tenant lacking holiday
cheer. 1 am heading out to find a good fuzi. a
Chinese character that means wealth, happiness
and good luck that people hang on their doors as
decoration for the New Year. This morning, my
neighbors are creating a particularly noisy spec
tacle. They keep chickens in a little coop in the
stairwell, and they are now selecting the choic
est hens to prepare for tonight s supper. Two of
the chosen ones are lying in a heap of feathers
and scaly feet on an edition of the daily newspa
per, obstructing my path down to the road. The
old woman and her husband kindly nudge the
fallen poultry to the side and I wish them a

happy new year.
Yangshuo is still small enough that 1 have
only been out for about an hour and I've run
into all of my new friends here. Officially, Yang
shuo has a population of about 300,000, but this
includes all of the surrounding outskirts and
county villages. So in town, people's faces get to
be pretty familiar. Songs have been written and
scrolls painted for this town for centuries in
China. It has long been a home of renowned
poets and is famous for the scenery known as
sfumshui. mountains and water, which it amply
provides.
On the corner of Furong road where 1 buy
fruit by the;iw,or standard half-kilo weight. lam
picking up a basket of qingzao, a small green
fruit that tastes like an apple but has the core
and size of a nectarine, when 1 bump into Tian
Yang out walking with a little boy just old
enough to attempt mastery of bipedalism. The
English translation of Tian Yang's name is
"Sunny Day," or. "Sunny Weather." Tian Yang
works in the hostel I stayed at for the first few
nights in Yangshuo. She grew up farming wheat
in Anhui province but moved here to Guangxi
province to find higher paying work. She tells

me she wanted to go home for the
Spring Festival, but Anhui is buried
under snow and the trains are all
blocked right now. All over southern
China for the past two weeks people
traveling home for the New Year
have been interrupted by pernicious
weather, blizzards blocking train
tracks and forcing a change of plans.
The Spring Festival in China is a
time when families travel long dis
tances to their hometowns to be to
gether and celebrate the New Year.
Universities close, people get time
off of work and the trains are packed
with travelers laden with gifts of fruit
and cakes to bring home. People
often pass these days strolling
through town, buying vegetables and
candies and just enjoying window
shopping. This morning the sun has
risen bright and high and for the first
time in weeks, it is warm. It seems the
whole town has stirred into life.
Strolling couples are out walking
with their children, whose hair is all

freshly washed and tied up into
ponytails festooned with bright
flower bobbles. Mothers are buying
last-minute supplies for dinner, and
vendors are joyfully selling their
wares — a relaxed holiday happi
ness is in the air.Tian Yang smiles as
we part ways. She's not too upset
about not making it home for the
holidays; she tells me she celebrated
New Year's Eve by making jiaozi, a
pork- and vegetable-stuffed
dumpling.
1 know the place to buy myself a
shiny new fuzi — on Pantao road
just after the noodle shops, there is a
massive market the size of a football
field packed with fruits, vegetables,
candies, nuts, rice, liquors, meats, fish
and spices all carted in by peddlers
from the villages up the river. Deter
mined not to send my neighborhood
reputation into Grinchhood, I am di
recting my jocund wandering south
toward the market.
It is a madhouse.The market's dirt

aisles have been churned up into
mud sluices run through with
rivulets of runoff from yesterday's
rain dripping through the canvas
roof. Long wooden tables stretch
back into interminable aisles, sag
ging under the cornucopia of carrots,
radishes, leeks, ginger, sugar cane,
bamboo, turnips, hot peppers, pota
toes, lychees, garlic and more that 1
am only beginning to be able to
identify by name. Sacks of every va
riety of rice and spices and plastic
bags of rice wine and salt fill up the
dry spots of earth that are left, while
chestnuts, sunflower seeds, candied
lotus seeds and luohanguo tea fruits
overflow wooden trays and card
board shipping containers. Every
one is laughing, buying, selling and
playing with their children — it feels
to me like a Christmas market on
Christmas Eve. I buy two kilos of red
apples and one niangao. The plain
niangao looks like a fat white roll of
sugar cookie dough with a red swirl
of a decoration on the top and comes
in a variety of shapes and sizes, but I
ask the seller and she explains that
they actually grind glutinous rice
into a paste, mix in a few other ingre
dients to hold the mixture together,
then form it into the desired shape

and boil it to set the mixture. The
name of the cake has two parts, nian
means year and gao means higher
and better, so the name together sig
nifies the wish that every year the
family will become more prosperous
and successful at home and in work.
Sticky cakes like this are often of
fered during the Spring Festival as
gifts to the kitchen god, so that it will
glue his mouth shut and prevent him
from speaking ill of the family to the
Jade Emperor.
1 work my way over to the far side
of the market where the rivulets
have grown into fishy-smelling
streams. Here big red tubs and steel
tanks are teeming with elephantine
coy and scuttling turtles. 1 have ar
rived just in time to witness the pur
chase of a turtle, and the seller is
hacking open its shell with a chefs
knife. Meat here doesn't just show
up on your plate — if you go out to
buy dinner, you see the preparation
process through from beginning to
end. But after all this, I still haven't
found my fitzi, so 1 decide to walk
back along the river where there are
often small stands selling knick
knacks.
I'm following a woman pulling
home a cart freshly loaded with

goods from the market when 1 see
the fuzi. Just beyond my view of her
carrots, leviathan fish head sloshing
in a half-filled bucket of water.chunk
of beef wrapped up in a plastic bag,
bushel of rice, bouncing bouquet of
celery and a five kilo sack of dried
hot chili pepper seeds, there is a
flashy red stand. It only takes a
minute of ruffling through the piles
of red characters, money-giving en
velopes and lucky red door banners
to pick out a fine little fuzi, made of
fuzzy red felt and outlined with gold
glitter. The stand owner sells it to me
for five yuan and laughs cheerfully,
telling me 1 should hang it upside
down, because the word for upside
down also means to come or arrive,
so through a bit of linguistic gymnas
tics, hanging the character for luck,
happiness and prosperity upside
down makes it all the more likely
that this door decoration will indeed
deliver on its promises.
It's late afternoon now so 1 hurry
back toward the quieter part of town
where 1 live. A legion of bright red
paper lanterns light up the sidewalks,
and tall red candles and incense
arranged on New Year's Eve are still
stuck in the ground in some places
next to tidy little tables with fruit,
rice, duck meat and paper made as
ceremonial offerings to ancestors
and gods.
The eve of the Chinese New Year
in China was the most raucous dis
play of fireworks 1 have ever been
fortunate enough to witness. Hardly

safe but certainly boisterous good
fun. all along the docks on the bank
of the Li river a cacophony of
screeching and swirling golden,
green and red sparks were flying out
of the hands of five year olds,
teenagers and couples pushing their
seventies alike. At the time, someone
zestfully dropped a five-foot long
firework rod into my hand. 1 come
from a state where the sale of most
fireworks is prohibited, especially
the fun kind. 1 stood there bedazzled,
brandishing this magic wand as it
shot off a thrilling golden stream o*
fireworks from its spout every three
seconds.
Now.even a week later, at precise
ly twelve o'clock midnight, world
war breaks out outside my window. 1
can't hear anything but the wild
drumfire of fireworks detonated all
over town. ITie old story goes that
this tradition started because people
feared that on New Year's Eve evil
spirits and the animal of the last year
would come into villages and eat the
residents, so the village people would
light off fireworks to scare off the evil
animals. It has since become a tradi
tion of sending away the old year and
ushering in the new. These mornings
when I step outside my door, the
streets are paved with a carpet of
rose-colored paper scraps from the
fireworks. The luck ought to start
rolling in at any moment.
