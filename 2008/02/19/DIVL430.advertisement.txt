Back-to-back Bach! This year's all-Bach recital taps the talents of
James Kibbie, international concert and recording artist, widely
recognized Bach authority, and Professor of Music at the University
of Michigan. It's all Bach, deftly handled by a Bach virtuoso - need
we say more?
Sponsored by Stanford University's Office for Religious Life and Department of Music.
