## The 						Tree in 3D The 						Daily sits down with John Whipple '10, the current Stanford Tree, for a discussion about the agony and the ecstasy of Treedom Q & A 
### STEPHANIE WERNER 
The Stanford Daily: What
has been the best part of being Tree?
John Whipple: Definitely winning
k Big Game and being on the field.
y That was huge. Beating USC. It's
been a lot of fun. And in general
just the kinds of interactions you get
with people. You run into a lot of in
teresting situations.
SI): What has been the most surpris
ing part of being Tree?
.IW: What surprised me the most was
how much shit the Band does all the
time. The Band probably has the
busiest schedule on campus. I walked
into Tree not totally understanding
what 1 was getting myself into and be
came the busiest man alive. Also, the
fear that I strike into young children.
I thought they would like me, and a lot
of little kids are terrified of the Tree.
Some love it, and some are terrified.
It's kind of a mixed response.
SI): What's the meanest or most out
rageous thing anyone's ever done to
you while you were in costume?
JW: This happened at Cal at a volley
ball game. At halftime, we were kind
of behind and I was kind of flaunting
in front of the Band. Some guys
walked out behind me, and they table
topped me. One guy was down on his
knees, and another guy pushed me
over him. 1 went downwind it kind of
broke the frame a little bit. But in re
sponse I had TPS with me. Tree Pro-

tection Service; they had a good retal
iation. They started fighting and stuff
and [my friend] Spin grabbed this
kid's glasses and broke them in half.
SI): Are there any boring parts?
JW: It's a relatively lonely position.
It's fame and glory and rock star
but...you're in there by yourself, and
so there can be some long times in
there. It's always pretty lively, though,
so it's never really boring.
SI): How many girls did you kiss at
FMOTQ?
JW: The gross count was something
like 450 or something like that. I got
really sick.
SI): Any guys?
JW: Definitely. The Tree does not dis
criminate.
SI): Were any particularly memo
rable?
JW: The very first kiss of the night I
got was memorable. Later on in the
night I had a few people who came
back for second- and third-round kiss
es, and those were pretty memorable.
One came in under the Tree, and her
roommate covered us up with the
mouth of the Tree.
SI): Are you single?
JW: I am single. And if this is just out
for people to know, you shouldn't
walk into the Tree being in a relation
ship. The Tree's a rock star and ought
to be single. There's FMOTQ, which
could get hairy if you don't have a very
open girlfriend. And. honestly, being
the Tree you really ought to be mar
ried to the Tree. I have a very close, en
dearing relationship with my Tree.
SI): What will be going on during Tree
Week?
JVV: Tree Week [started] this Monday,
on February 18, and it actually lasts
longer than a week. It ends on
Wednesday. [Feb.] 27. And the week is
really just a week for kids who are try
ing out to show in any way possible
that they would be a good Tree .There
are three mandatory components.
There's the application that you have
to fill out in the beginning. There are

personal interviews that happen be
tween me and old Trees and people
from the Band. And then the last def
initely mandatory part is bribes. The
kids trying out for Trees should cre
atively bribe me, people in the Band
on staff, etc. My motivation for trying
out last year and the most fun part
were Tree stunts. They can take the
shapes of many different things, be
public stunts, done in front of class
rooms, done in White Plaza, involve
pain, pleasure, embarrassment, cre
ativity. That's the most fun. dynamic
part of Tree week.
SI): Why do you think you were cho
sen last year?
JW: The Tree is like a brotherhood,
but there's a community of Trees. It's
less of a position and more of a
lifestyle or mentality. And people who
get chosen to be Tree, throughout that
week, just demonstrate that they un
derstand what that mentality is. It's
not just necessarily any one particular
thing. Being Tree is kind of a weird
thing, but you're open to do whatever
you want. It's really pure freedom to
act crazy, make your own decisions
and chart your own way. People who
end up becoming Tree understand
that and sort of take that and use it to
its fullest.
SI): What stunts did you perform dur
ing Tree Week last year?
JW: My favorite stunt, which may be
happening again on Friday or Satur
day in White Plaza, and I may try to
make this an annual thing because it
was very fun. was a KY jelly wrestling
match in a little baby pool. I chal
lenged anyone out in the audience to
some wrestling. 1 also branded myself
with a tree on my back. It's still there.
Doesn't look like a tree anymore.
[Shows scar.] Another thing we did.
this was in collaboration with another
kid who was running for Tree last
year, was we recreated a live version
of duck hunt where myself, the other
person trying out and a couple of
other guys were the ducks. And we
gave the old Tree a paintball gun and
he got to shoot at us. I'd never been hit
by a paintball before. Yeah, it hurt. I
was surprised. The very last thing I did


BECCA DEL MONTE/
The Stanford Daily
was I kidnapped the new prospec
tive Dollies — so Dollies who are
trying out should be aware because
they could be involved — [and]
gave them a little mission themed
around the TV series "Power
Rangers." They very successfully
completed their mission, which was
running through this obstacle
course in White Plaza, where the
end prize was a brand new martini
shaker. ITiey got barraged by the
putty men. My friends and I all
dressed up and attacked them.
SI): Now did you design your cos
tume? What was the logic behind it?
JW: Rushed and procrastinatedly,
would be the short answer. My cos
tume is basically like a really heavy
duty hiking backpack with two alu
minum rods and a big aluminum
ring at the top. The shell is just sort
of rings that are attached by canvas
straps and edge down that way. I
had this lady help me make all the
leaves individually, and they Velcro
onto each of the different tiers.
SD: What were the best additions
you made to it over the course of the
year?
JW: One thing that changed was for
Big Game. It's kind of tradition to
have a little modification to the Tree
in some way. So on the backside of
all the leaves I sewed all the differ
ent kinds of fabrics. My grandma
helped me with that. And 1 flipped
them out for Big Game.That was in
spired by a Tree from a few years
ago, where the leaves on one side
were green and red on the other.
The other thing I had to adapt for
was just the kind of wear and tear
the Tree goes through. Just really
strengthening the leaves. Right now
it's pretty much held together by
duct tape, zip ties and safety pins.
SI): If you had to summarize your
experience as Tree in one sentence,
how would you do it?
JW': The life of the Tree is the life of
a rock star, only better. It was the
best time of my life because 1 got to
rock the fuck out every day.

how much shit the Band does all the
time. The Band probably has the
busiest schedule on campus. I walked
into Tree not totally understanding
what 1 was getting myself into and be
came the busiest man alive. Also, the
fear that I strike into young children.
I thought they would like me, and a lot
of little kids are terrified of the Tree.
Some love it, and some are terrified.
It's kind of a mixed response.
SI): What's the meanest or most out
rageous thing anyone's ever done to
you while you were in costume?
JW: This happened at Cal at a volley
ball game. At halftime, we were kind
of behind and I was kind of flaunting
in front of the Band. Some guys
walked out behind me, and they table
topped me. One guy was down on his
knees, and another guy pushed me
over him. 1 went downwind it kind of
broke the frame a little bit. But in re
sponse I had TPS with me. Tree Pro-

tection Service; they had a good retal
iation. They started fighting and stuff
and [my friend] Spin grabbed this
kid's glasses and broke them in half.
SI): Are there any boring parts?
JW: It's a relatively lonely position.
It's fame and glory and rock star
but...you're in there by yourself, and
so there can be some long times in
there. It's always pretty lively, though,
so it's never really boring.
SI): How many girls did you kiss at
FMOTQ?
JW: The gross count was something
like 450 or something like that. I got
really sick.
SI): Any guys?
JW: Definitely. The Tree does not dis
criminate.
SI): Were any particularly memo
rable?
JW: The very first kiss of the night I
got was memorable. Later on in the
night I had a few people who came
back for second- and third-round kiss
es, and those were pretty memorable.
One came in under the Tree, and her
roommate covered us up with the
mouth of the Tree.
SI): Are you single?
JW: I am single. And if this is just out
for people to know, you shouldn't
walk into the Tree being in a relation
ship. The Tree's a rock star and ought
to be single. There's FMOTQ, which
could get hairy if you don't have a very
open girlfriend. And. honestly, being
the Tree you really ought to be mar
ried to the Tree. I have a very close, en
dearing relationship with my Tree.
SI): What will be going on during Tree
Week?
JVV: Tree Week [started] this Monday,
on February 18, and it actually lasts
longer than a week. It ends on
Wednesday. [Feb.] 27. And the week is
really just a week for kids who are try
ing out to show in any way possible
that they would be a good Tree .There
are three mandatory components.
There's the application that you have
to fill out in the beginning. There are

personal interviews that happen be
tween me and old Trees and people
from the Band. And then the last def
initely mandatory part is bribes. The
kids trying out for Trees should cre
atively bribe me, people in the Band
on staff, etc. My motivation for trying
out last year and the most fun part
were Tree stunts. They can take the
shapes of many different things, be
public stunts, done in front of class
rooms, done in White Plaza, involve
pain, pleasure, embarrassment, cre
ativity. That's the most fun. dynamic
part of Tree week.
SI): Why do you think you were cho
sen last year?
JW: The Tree is like a brotherhood,
but there's a community of Trees. It's
less of a position and more of a
lifestyle or mentality. And people who
get chosen to be Tree, throughout that
week, just demonstrate that they un
derstand what that mentality is. It's
not just necessarily any one particular
thing. Being Tree is kind of a weird
thing, but you're open to do whatever
you want. It's really pure freedom to
act crazy, make your own decisions
and chart your own way. People who
end up becoming Tree understand
that and sort of take that and use it to
its fullest.
SI): What stunts did you perform dur
ing Tree Week last year?
JW: My favorite stunt, which may be
happening again on Friday or Satur
day in White Plaza, and I may try to
make this an annual thing because it
was very fun. was a KY jelly wrestling
match in a little baby pool. I chal
lenged anyone out in the audience to
some wrestling. 1 also branded myself
with a tree on my back. It's still there.
Doesn't look like a tree anymore.
[Shows scar.] Another thing we did.
this was in collaboration with another
kid who was running for Tree last
year, was we recreated a live version
of duck hunt where myself, the other
person trying out and a couple of
other guys were the ducks. And we
gave the old Tree a paintball gun and
he got to shoot at us. I'd never been hit
by a paintball before. Yeah, it hurt. I
was surprised. The very last thing I did


BECCA DEL MONTE/
The Stanford Daily
was I kidnapped the new prospec
tive Dollies — so Dollies who are
trying out should be aware because
they could be involved — [and]
gave them a little mission themed
around the TV series "Power
Rangers." They very successfully
completed their mission, which was
running through this obstacle
course in White Plaza, where the
end prize was a brand new martini
shaker. ITiey got barraged by the
putty men. My friends and I all
dressed up and attacked them.
SI): Now did you design your cos
tume? What was the logic behind it?
JW: Rushed and procrastinatedly,
would be the short answer. My cos
tume is basically like a really heavy
duty hiking backpack with two alu
minum rods and a big aluminum
ring at the top. The shell is just sort
of rings that are attached by canvas
straps and edge down that way. I
had this lady help me make all the
leaves individually, and they Velcro
onto each of the different tiers.
SD: What were the best additions
you made to it over the course of the
year?
JW: One thing that changed was for
Big Game. It's kind of tradition to
have a little modification to the Tree
in some way. So on the backside of
all the leaves I sewed all the differ
ent kinds of fabrics. My grandma
helped me with that. And 1 flipped
them out for Big Game.That was in
spired by a Tree from a few years
ago, where the leaves on one side
were green and red on the other.
The other thing I had to adapt for
was just the kind of wear and tear
the Tree goes through. Just really
strengthening the leaves. Right now
it's pretty much held together by
duct tape, zip ties and safety pins.
SI): If you had to summarize your
experience as Tree in one sentence,
how would you do it?
JW': The life of the Tree is the life of
a rock star, only better. It was the
best time of my life because 1 got to
rock the fuck out every day.
The Stanford Daily: What
has been the best part of being Tree?
John Whipple: Definitely winning
k Big Game and being on the field.
y That was huge. Beating USC. It's
been a lot of fun. And in general
just the kinds of interactions you get
with people. You run into a lot of in
teresting situations.

ing part of being Tree?
