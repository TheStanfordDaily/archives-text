# Then Tree Roots

Everyone's seen the Stanford Tree
around campus — at sporting events and
Full Moon on the Quad or simply up to no
good. But how was this wacky tradition
established? There's no denying that
the TVee is not the fiercest mascot
1 imaginable, and Cal fans will be the
first to tell you that "Bears piss on
trees."
Yet in spite of its shortcomings, the
Tree has a rich and storied history. A
child of the '70s, the IYee was born in
the Vietnam era, when students
across the nation were challenging
the status quo in many ways.
"There was a lot of unrest and po
lice activity on campus," said Abby
Hilson '73. "It made the students step
out of the traditional and start finding

other ways to look at things."
At Stanford, students chose to confront
cultural insensitivity. Since 1930, University
athletic teams had been known as the Stan
ford Indians. The mascot. Prince Lightfoot,
had been played by Timm Williams, a mem
ber of the Yurok tribe, since 1951.
Native American students and staff were
upset by this portrayal of their traditions. In
1972, they successfully lobbied to change
the name.
"The thing I remember most was a rally
one night outside of the Bookstore in White
Plaza where several of the Native American
students spoke passionately about why the
Indian had to go," said Deborah Trotter'7s.
"That made a big impression on me"
Following the decision to change the
mascot, an election was held among stu
dents to determine possible replacements.
In order of popularity, students chose
The Robber Barons, The Thunder Chick

ens. The Cardinal, The Huns and The
Griffins. In 1981. University administrators
finally settled on The Cardinal.
But the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band (LSJUMB) had other
ideas.
"The Band wouldn't accept a color as a
mascot," Trotter said. "They thought it was
too boring. 1 mean, how does a color dress
up and dance?"
In 1975, the Band put on a field show
suggesting other possible mascots appro
priate for Stanford — including The Steam
ing Manhole,The French Fry and The Tree.
The Tree received positive feedback
from students, so LSJUMB decided to keep
it around.
"The I>ee wasn't a mascot that people
thought was serious," Hilson said. "The In
dian was politically incorrect, but the Tree
was just hokey."
"The Band kept the Tree because it's the
Band," she added.
ITie Tree is representative of El
Palo Alto, a real coast redwood tree
in Palo Alto that appears on Stan
ford's official seal and the municipal
seal of the city.
Since the mid-1980s, the selection
of new Trees has taken place during
Tree Week — which is, in fact, slight
ly longer than a week. ITiis year's
Tree Week started Monday and will
continue until Wednesday, Feb. 27.
Potential Trees have until tomorrow
to enter the competition.
Tree Week involves crazy and
dangerous stunts performed by po
tential Trees designed to impress the
Tree selection committee, which con
sists of LSJUMB members,• >ldTrees
and the current Tree. Stunts utilizing
explosives or firearms are prohibited
bv the University.
