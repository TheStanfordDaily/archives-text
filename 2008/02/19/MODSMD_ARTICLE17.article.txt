ITie race closed a section of the
campus to all hut race viewers,
blocking the Oval and Palm Drive
to automotive traffic.
Before the prologue, Stanford
students had an opportunity to par
ticipate in the Charity Challenge
Time Trial. Spots in the race were
auctioned off to benefit charities
like the Palo Alto Recreation
Foundation and to cover local costs
for the race. Four members of the
Stanford Cycling Team participated.
"For an amateur cyclist that was
a one of a kind sort of thing." said
Gavin Melly '09. a cycling team
member who placed third in the
charity race. "1 went out like a bat
out of hell, full steam. By the first
corner I realized I had three min
utes to go. It was over in a heart
beat. I'm already waiting to go
again next year."
"It was a lot of fun," added
cycling team member Arwen
Bradley *09, who also participated in
the charity race. "1 watch cycling on
TV, but you don't quite get the sense
of just how fast they're going. It was
especially cool since I had just rid
den a course, and they were quite a
bit faster."
Cyclists were not the only enter
tainment at the race: live music and

vendors entertained the large crowd
that gathered to watch the event.
Companies that produce bike mer
chandise!. nutritional snacks and
other health and wellness goods also
set up shop at tents and tables, pro
viding contests and prizes.
Placing after Cancellara were
British rider Bradley Wiggins,
Americans Tyler Farrar and Levi
Leipheimer and Norwegian lidvald
Boasson Hagen. Leipheimer was
the defending champion for the
prologue event, as well as last year's
overall winner in the Tour. A collec

tion of guest racers, including 2007
Palo Alto mayor Yoriko Kishimoto,
took part in the race. Kishimoto
completed the course in 6 minutes
and 50 seconds.
Racers moved on Monday to
Sausalito and Santa Rosa for the
first main stage of the tour, where
Cancellara maintained his lead.
