## Buying, sadness linked in study 
### STEPHANIE WERNER 
A new study entitled "Misery is not
Miserly" conducted by Psychology Prof. James
Gross, reveals that both men and women are
likely to be willing to spend more money when
they are sad. The study, conducted in conjunc
tion with researchers from Carnegie Mellon.
Harvard and the University of Pittsburgh, was
part of a larger exploration of behavioral eco
nomics, the application of psychology to eco
nomics.
"We're trying to understand how emotional
factors may play a crucial role in judgment
decision-making," Gross said. "In this study, we
were interested in the role that a particular
emotional factor, namely sadness, might play in
how much money people are willing to spend."
Thirty-three volunteers were shown either a
sad or neutral emotion-inducing video clip.

They were then presented with a sporty water
bottle and given the opportunity to purchase it
for a price between $0 and $10.
Participants shown the sad clip set higher
buying prices than did the neutral-condition
participants. People in the sadness-condition
group were willing to pay almost four times as
much as those in the neutral-condition group.
Hie study in particular focused on sadness
and self-interest, as only people who became
both sad and self-focused were willing to pay
more.
Gross hopes that the findings of this study
will "[help] people understand the processes
that happen automatically inside of them."
"We're hoping to give [people] better con
trol over those processes." he said.
