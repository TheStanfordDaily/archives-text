# Darwish shares view of Middle East politics
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford hosted another voice
Monday night in the continuing
debate over politics in the Middle
Hast. Egyptian-American writer
Nonie Darwish spoke at Kresge
Auditorium about her opinion on
Arab and Muslim attitudes toward
Jews and Israel and what changes she
feels must be made.
The talk, entitled "Can Arabs Be
Pro-Israel?" was sponsored by the
ASSIJ Speaker's Bureau, Hillel at
Stanford and the Stanford Israel
Alliance. Darwish, founder of the
group "Arabs for Israel," also pro
moted her 2(XKi book. "Now They
Call Me Infidel: Why 1 Renounced
Jihad for America. Israel and the War
on Terror."
The author spoke out against what
she viewed as an indoctrination of
anti-Semitism in Arab youth.
"Growing up. this hatred becomes
a part of how you see the world."
Darwish said. "People in the Middle
East will say. 'don't take candy from
strangers, it might be a Jew trying to
poison you.' If you tell that to a child,
hatred becomes easy."
Darwish said that she was motivat
ed to begin her cause in the wake of
the <â– )/! 1 attacks, when she heard
reports from the Middle East that a
Jewish conspiracy was behind the
strikes.
"After 9/11, for we Arabs to accuse
the Jews of what we know we've done
is shameful and unacceptable," she
said. "This treatment of Jews in the
Middle East is a disgrace."
To Darwish, support for Israel
does not necessitate a rejection of
Arabic culture.
"That I support Israel does not mean
I am anti-Arab," she said. "If we want
peace, we have to support both. We
need a new paradigm of how we as

Arabs view Israel."
Darwish also disagreed with the
labeling of Israeli conduct towards
Palestinians as "apartheid."
"They call Israel an apartheid
state," she said. "Yet who is worse, the
Arab world, where not a single Jew
can be free, or Israel, where Arabs are
free to work with Koranic verses
printed on their outerclothes?"
"We don't want to bring to college
campuses a cult of bringing up these
terms," she added.
The author expressed full support
for the Israeli West Bank barrier.
"I think Israel should increase its
fence and make it higher." she said,
"because very soon there are going to
be civil wars on the other side of it."
Darwish further directed sharp
criticism toward Arab media for
ignoring or redirecting blame for
Muslim-on-Muslim violence.
"The Arab media are accusing
Americans and Jews of exaggerating
Darfur," she said. "To them, any
Muslim-on-Muslim atrocities arc
Israel and America's fault."
"And where is the Western media
reporting on and criticizing this?" she
added.
Darwish recognized the tension
she sparks in Arab and Muslim cir
cles.
"I've never had a direct death
threat." she said,"but I've never been
invited to speak in front of any Arab
or Muslim group."
But Darwish said that when she
finds herself at odds with mainstream
Arab opinion, she remains commit
ted to her beliefs.
"Even when I feel alone. I'm doing
what's dictated to me by my con
science," she said. "It's not easy to
overcome an attitude, but we must do
it."
