## Editorial Board Berkeley City Council: crossing the line 
### 
In late January, the Berkeley city council
voted 8-1 to declare the Marines working
at a local recruiting office "uninvited and
unwelcome intruders," proceeding to express
wishes to have said office removed from the
city.The resolution further stated that the City
of Berkeley applauded residents and organi
zations that "volunteer to impede, passively or
actively, by nonviolent means, the work of any
military recruiting office located in the City of
Berkeley"
Ihis action is disrespectful and inappropri
ate. The United States Marine Corps includes
some our bravest and most dedicated service
men and women. Regardless of whether or
not one agrees with particular actions taken
by the current presidential administration or
whether one has a moral opposition to current
foreign policy, focusing attacks on the men
and women who volunteer to serve this coun
try at great risk to their person is deplorable.
In an interview. Councilman Laurie
Capitelli publicly stated that "our issue is not
with the troops; our issue is with the policy
makers." But contrary to this principle, instead
of promoting a positive and constructive criti
cism of the war or of policymakers, the Coun
cil decided to take a shameful, cowardly and
inappropriate swipe at the United States Ma
rine Corps.
There are a plethora of ways to protest the
war and the administration without hammer
ing at the men and women risking their lives
ever)' day. In fact, the members of Code Pink,
a self-dubbed grassroots peace and social jus
tice movement, have been sitting in a parking
space outside the recruiting office for the past
four months to do just that since the group's
formation in 2002 — namely, protesting the
leaders in Washington, not the troops.
Sitting outside of a recruiting office pro
moting peace is one thing, but to call the
Marines "unwelcome intruders" is another.
ITife second that protestors turned their at
tention from the war and the administration
to the U.S. Marine Corps, they crossedo very
important and unambiguous line. By attack
ing the troops in the service instead of the
policy leaders in Washington, Berkeley took
the American psyche back to the shameful
days of the post-Vietnam era. a time when
returning soldiers who had suffered and

fought in the sweltering jungles of Southeast
Asia were spat on and called baby-killers by
the public. We would like to think that
America as a whole has learned a lesson
from that embarrassing section of history,
but apparently the Berkeley City Council
missed the memo.
Unsurprisingly, the City of Berkeley's ac
tion drew immediate criticism both locally
and in Washington, where Republican sena
tors called for the immediate revocation of
federal funding both for UC-Berkeley and the
city itself. To nobody's true astonishment, the
council practically fell over itself in the hurry
to take back what it had said, voting 7-2 to
overturn its prior opinion — conveniently in
time to secure the next federal paycheck. Not
only did this call into question the council's
priorities and convictions, but it made one
wonder why on earth the council made such
inane,needlessly incendiary statements in the
first place.
The City of Berkeley needs to grow up and
take responsibility for this sincere lapse in
judgment. Backing down from its initial posi
tion is not enough; there should be a formal
apology to the Marines working at the recruit
ing office as well as to the Marine Corps in
general.
The citizens of Berkeley are encouraged to
continue protesting this administration and
the war abroad if they disagree so passionate
ly with current policy. In fact, they are more
than welcome to continue their vigil outside of
the recruiting office to try to convince poten
tial candidates against signing on with the
marines. I lowever, they are not welcome to
attack and denigrate the men and women of
the United States Armed Forces who volun
teer to serve on their behalf at home and
abroad, and citizens should be mortified that
the thought even crossed their minds.
Gunnery Sgt. Pauline Franklin, public af
fairs chief for Marine Corps Recruiting Com
mand, said it best: "the members of the coun
cil ;ire within their rights to voice their objec
tions. Iliey are citizens of the United States,
and as citizens they have the right of free
speech." We only hope that, in the future, the
Berkeley City Council will exercise its free
dom to think before moving on to the right to
speak.
