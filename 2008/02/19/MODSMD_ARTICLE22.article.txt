## Obama fatigue 
### 
It seems as if Sen. Barack Obama has the
inside track on capturing the Democratic
nomination. Despite Sen. Hillary Clin
ton's best shots in New Hampshire. Nevada
and the Feb. 5 states. Obama has never relin
quished the mantle of "frontrunner" he cap
tured after lowa. This is the most successful
insurgent campaign in recent memory. Where
Gary I lart and Howard Dean failed, losing to
establishment candidates, Obama may be
close to triumph, on the verge of slaying the
vaunted Clinton machine. In s u r -
gent campaigns are much easier to run in the
primaries than the general election. Witness
Mike Huckabee, who. despite being patently
and obviously unelectabie, has won eight
states. Everyone except the most delusional
evangelical Christian knows that I luckabee is
completely and totally not viable in the gen
eral election. But voting for him in the pri
mary is OK because of the assurance that a
more seasoned and moderate candidate will
emerge with the nomination. Huckabee's
supporters have made their voices heard
through his success, but it will not go any far
ther than that. Huckabee, like all the other
anti-establishment Republican campaigns
like Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson and John
McCain circa 2(XX), is doomed to obscurity.
Obama's campaign has been different.
The problem for Obama, something he
clearly has not yet resolved, is whether he can
sustain this momentum for the next eight
months. That's right, people. The presidential
election, which began about a year ago. is
barely half over. It's only February, and the
election is in November. Running against the
Democratic establishment is easy, really. Win
ning over voters against a battle-tested oppo
nent, when every state is in play and the elec
torate is much larger, is an entirely different
game, and Obama is going to have to play it
differently.
Every time a state votes, the TV networks
give a substantial block of time to Obama's
speech. We see, as usual, a wall of supporters
behind him holding signs that somehow in
corporate the word "change." It's something
we can believe in. apparently. He gives his
usual rhetoric about changing the political
system, building purple states and changing
Washington in a "movement." It's starting to

become repetitive already, or, as the Wall
Street Journal called it, "tiresome." Even so,
Obama's capacity to deliver eloquent speech
es has not diminished.
Some people are starting to get tired of the
signatures of the Obama campaign — the
word "change" splashed everywhere, the fa
natical young supporters, the Kennedy thing
and so on — and Obama needs to reconsid
er his message for the general election. His
first task,should he capture the nomination,
would be to reach out to Hillary Clinton's
supporters, who are more traditional Demo
cratic voters — women. Latinos, teachers,
the working class — and convince them
that, despite his less meaty message, he can
represent and advocate for them, as well.
TTiis will entail sounding a more convention
ally Democratic message at times; John Ed
wards and I lillary Clinton, despite their pol
icy differences, sounded much more like
each other than Obama does.
More importantly, however, Obama is
going to need to find ways to sustain mo
mentum and the energy of his supporters.
It's going to be difficult. His campaign has
out-organized Hillary Clinton in pretty
much every state with a caucus, with impres
sive results. This organization will need to
expand dramatically for a general election
campaign. Much of his campaign has been
running on opposition — he's running
against the establishment, against politics as
usual,changing America. It is not going to be
easy to sound that kind of rhetoric against
the maverick John McCain, himself a little
bit anti-establishment, whom the media
loves almost as much as they do Obama.The
message is going to have to be more complex
and more sophisticated. One word panaceas

like "change" and "hope" are not
going to suffice in a long general
election campaign against the Re
publicans.
I'm starting to get sick of the
Obama shtick anyway, but 1 am
probably one of the first. More peo

pie will tire of it in the future, and
Obama is going to have to offer
something new — which he has
proven himself very good at doing
— to maintain the attention of his
less fanatical and committed sup
porters from today until election
dav
