# Pleading Inanity
## Stephen's spiel 
### 
Before we start. I'd like to quell a vicious
rumor that my personal editor has
been spreading: 1 have never used per
formance enhancing steroids, developmental
boosters or bovine growth hormones to write
my columns.The humor you find herein is the
result of natural moxie,childhood trauma and
vanilla soymilk.
Moving on. Ihose of you who accidentally
glanced at the international paragraph ofThe
Daily on your way to my column may have
noticed that acclaimed director Steven Spiel
berg has decided to resign as "artistic adviser"
for the 2(X)8 Olympics in Beijing. In explain
ing his premature withdrawal, he accused
China of not doing enough to end the contin
uing human suffering in the troubled western
Darfur region and claimed that his con
science would not allow him to continue with
"business as usual."
Now, it's no secret that China and I
haven't always agreed on policy matters. On
the one hand, I was a big fan of the Great
Wall, as I firmly believe that the best way to
solve foreign policy problems is to erect large
brick barriers. The Cultural Revolution did
n't appeal to me as much, though I think the
real problem — like McCain might say about
Iraq — was not the principle but the execu-
As for the Great Leap Forward, let's
just say that I prefer to keep both feet square
ly on the ground at all times.
Historically, I've seen eye-to-eye with
Spielberg a bit more. His classic "Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade" showed us that,
when approached from the right angle, neo
colonialism can be fun and really exciting.

and I think that the take-home message of his
epic "Saving Private Ryan" was that war
ought to be a first resort in resolving any type
of dispute. Then again. I think he swung and
missed when Marty McFly made out with his
mom in his biopic "Back to the Future." 1
mean, I wouldn't kick Lea Thompson out of
bed for eating crackers, but I would if I were
her son. Probably.
Why did Spielberg's conscience force
him out of the Middle Kingdom? Let's start
with the facts: Fighting between govern
ment-backed Janjawed militia and rebels in
Darfur has killed more than 200,000 people
and left an estimated 2.5 million displaced
since 2003. China imports 500,000 barrels of
Sudanese oil a day and supplies weapons to
the Sudanese government that often find
their way into the militia's hands. Chinese
leaders have generally resisted the use of in
ternational pressure to intervene in Darfur,
going so far as to use its Security Council
veto to block the imposition of sanctions on
Sudan, This — according to policy wonks
like UmaThurman, M.D./Ph.D. in post-con
flict resolution, and Spielberg, G.E.D./Yoga
Instructor's Certificate — makes China
complicit in the killing that has devastated
the region.

Though it strongly condemns the inter
ference in the affairs of other sovereign na
tions, China has not been deaf to such
charges, especially in advance of this sum
mer's Olympic festivities. Western diplo
mats credit the nation with helping to per
suade Sudan to accept a U.N. peacekeeping
mission, and China has supported a hybrid
African Union/United Nations force to pa
trol the region. And it's rumored that after
the summer games, Chinese government of
ficials will deploy Olympic mascots Beibei,
Jingjing and Nini to spread friendship and
peace throughout all of Africa.
So, did Spielberg do the right thing? To
be honest, more than anything else, I won
der why he signed on to the project in the
first place. Hey Stevo, China's involvement
in Africa is nothing new; when did you de
cide to grow a pair? A little due diligence
goes a long way, buddy.
Moreover, although it's undeniable that
we should all do as much as we can to stop
genocide, isn't it also possible that drastic
action on the part of China might destabi
lize the region even more? And don't sanc
tions have a thoroughly mixed record of
promoting positive outcomes? (See espe
cially: Iraq)
Although this is an opinion column, 1
must admit that I can't offer a firm one with
out more answers. Regardless of how cute
and inspiring "E.T." was, 1 think you should
be skeptical of anyone who claims he can.

If you want to hang out with Beibei, Jingjing
and Nini, go to vishnus@stanford.edu.
