Health and well-being issues are not
trivial matters
To the editor,
The article "Striking a Balance" [Feb. 8]
portrays a misinformed view of the Asian
American Activities Center's (A3C) After
Dark Series and the seriousness of its pur
pose. As the coordinators for the series, we
were extremely disappointed and frustrated
to see the event and its topic so trivialized
and our speakers directly quoted when the
reporter had agreed not to quote them.
The purpose of the A3C After Dark Se
ries is to provide the Stanford community an
intimate and comfortable space in which stu
dents can discuss serious issues that affect
student health and well-being. The series

emerged from identification of community
needs in the Asian/Pacific Islander Health
and Well Being survey conducted by the A3C
last year. Such needs include body image,
parental and academic pressures, sexuality
and social concerns.
The After Dark Series is divided into
Q&A panels and workshops where currcnt
students and alumni are invited to speak and
share personal accounts related to the issues
mentioned above. Students are then able to
ask questions and participate in discussion
about how to resolve such issues. In addition,
workshops led by student and professional
staff aim to equip students with the knowl
edge of how to help fellow students and what
resources they can utilize to deal with health
and well-being concerns. Maintaining the

confidentiality of personal information ex
pressed at these events is an important fea
ture of the series â€” one that was severely
compromised with the publication of this ar
ticle.
1 iowever, the most glaring issue at hand is
the trivial approach toward health and well
being issues that is represented by the article.
It is already diilicult enough at Stanford for
students to even broach topics that revolve
around physical, emotional and mental
health. Io trivialize attempts to encourage
discussion only promotes further embarrass
ment. discomfort and isolation for students
battling with these issues.
We sincerely hope that, in the future,The
