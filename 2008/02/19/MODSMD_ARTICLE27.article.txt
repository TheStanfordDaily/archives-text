## Marine ouster disappointing but not unexpected 
### 
As a Marine from the Bay Area
who attends college in the re
gion and has friends at UC-
Berkeley, 1 am familiar with the re
gional politics and found the recent
decision by the City of Berkeley to be
disappointing but hardly unexpected.
The biggest issue is the unreason
able and misdirected feelings that
both sides — the far left and far right
— breed in their ranks and foster in
sympathetic minds. Just as you hear a
lot of Marines and soldiers talk about
"clueless liberals," "apologists" and so
on, the other side discusses this "illegal
war" and the "atrocities" service mem
bers have committed. The middle
ground lies forgotten by many in the
middle of a confusing and fast-paced
media frenzy. It's easy to feel es
tranged from large chunks of the
American population who, if current

reports are true,seem to be protesting,
killing or defaming one another.
Code Pink and similar organiza
tions on either side should be looking
to find a way to explain how they sup
port troops without knowing any of
them or asking them what kind of sup
port they want. Even veterans' groups
are not necessarily all that responsive
to concerns of modern military per
sonnel. and few of my peers choose to
join such organizations. Yet all claim to
support us and to know what's best in
this difficult political and military situ
ation. I prefer to trust people who de
vote more than a part-time interest to
these matters, but others may have a
different opinion.
These fringe groups are much
more savvy than ordinary military
members (and citizens) at using the
media's own jargon to gain publicity

and exposure. Likewise, the Public Af
fairs arm of the military also co-opts
this rhetoric: "friendly fire" and "neu
tralize" are just phrases glossing over
the less popular details of military ac
tion. Just as some liberals point to that
as military propaganda, so too do con
servatives accuse the other side of
wanting to create a "big brother" gov
ernment, open the borders to illegal
immigrants or exacerbate whatever
crisis dii jour they can find. These
alarmist views don't represent what
most people think or believe; I have
seen many opposing groups realize
how little they know about the other
side's real argument after short peri
ods of intelligent debate. litis sort of
discussion is exactly what's not hap
pening 011 the national level, which al
lows the shrill voices of small single
issue platforms to gain a toehold in
policy-making.
Groups like Code Pink exist now
because there are enough sensational
ist stories in the news; people hear
about "extraordinary rendition,""uni
lateral policies" and "conflicting intel
ligence reports" just enough to
halfway-believe these are daily occur
rences. Ille sensational stories of our
government working with the E.U. or
threatening smaller nations to go
along with illegal policies are com
pelling on the surface, and their rebut
tals are rarely given equivalent air
time. Instead, there's a barrage of
poorly thought-out, inflammatory
blog posts and op-eds by people who
know their audience (people who are
already looking for an excuse for ha
tred or mistrust) well enough to con
struct a flimsy argument that gets
these polarizing segments of the pop
ulation riled up.
Now these dozen or so people
standing outside the Berkeley Marine
Corps recruiting station are protesting
the legality of the current war and how
the military recruits, who it targets,
how they're treated and what these ef
forts mean for the future of the com
munity, nation and globe. Unfortu
nately. this dangerous and vocal pack
of activists was capable of mustering
the semblance of respectability neces
sary to steamroll a bored city council
into supporting them, or at least mis

understanding their intentions. Sadly,
there is no group on the other side at
these council meetings supporting the
military in Berkeley. All that will hap
pen to a councilmember voting "no" is
he will continue to he harassed; it is in
their short-term interests to just get
these people to shut up and leave
them alone. And there are no moder
ates clamoring to provide a different
perspective or silence Code Pink's un
reasonable complaints.
Maybe a voice of reason, modera
tion and reconciliation will be heard in
Berkeley, and maybe it won't. What
matters most is people learn from this
experience that there are groups af
fecting great change around the coun
try with little or no popular support.
Every outraged citizen reading about
the Berkeley decision should ask him
self whether he has ever been to a city
council meeting, voiced his opinions
and argued against divisive politics.
1 le must ask himself: have I ever tried
be a good citizen, putting in the work
necessary to make sure common sense
wins out over extreme views?
