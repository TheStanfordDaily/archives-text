without a field goal or a free throw for more
than six minutes, during which Wiggins and
Gold-Onwude combined for 10 of 12 Stanford

the half, never allowing Arizona State to get
within 12 points.

a 4h.7 percent clip in the first half (with 6-for

Gold-Onwude said that the sharp uptick in
shooting was not a coincidence.
"We've been focusing on shooting in the
past couple practices," Gold-Onwude said.

much attention, we have to be able to knock
those looks down."

game before seeing it crumble as ASU took
the lead at 21-19 five minutes later. But with
the offense misfiring a little. Stanford reassert

few seconds removed from the shot clock, the
Cardinal forced Arizona State into two shot
clock violations in three possessions toward
the end of the first half, as Stanford climbed
back on top behind its barrage of three-point
ers.
Stanford forced a number of ASU's 22
turnovers in that period, with Wiggins and the
other guards collapsing on the Sun Devils'
posts and stripping the ball from them again
and again.
