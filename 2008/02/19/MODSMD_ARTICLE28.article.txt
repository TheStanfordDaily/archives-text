It seems like fate pulls out the same tem
plate every time the Stanford and Arizona
State women's basketball teams clash. One
side pulls away and almost makes the game a
snoozer, only to be caught from behind late.
Tliat same story played itself out on Satur
day at Maples Pavilion, except this weekend it
was contained to the first half. No. 6 Stanford
walloped ASU by a nearly two-to-one margin
in the second half to run away with the game.
79-57. ITie Cardinal got its 12th straight win on
Senior Day, the team's last home game of the
regular season.
"Our team played a great game," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "ASU is a tough
team, and we had to play this well to be suc
cessful against them."
Senior guard Candice Wiggins led all play
ers with 23 points and also nabbed 5 of the
Cardinal's 10 steals, while sophomore center

GAME NOTES: On Senior Night, Candice Wiggins had yet
another dominating performance for the Cardinal, scor
ing 23 points in her final regular-season game in
Maples. Wiggins and classmate Cissy Pierce were hon
ored with a ceremony after the win. The Cardinal women
will take on Cal this weekend, the team at the top of the
Poc-10 standings. Stanford gave the Bears their only con
ference loss on January 26, by a 20-point margin.

Gold-Onwude went 5-for-6 from three
point range, leading Stanford to an 11-for-19
(57.9 percent) mark from behind the arc for
the game.
The Cardinal came out of the topsy-turvy
first half with only a six-point advantage, at 38-
32. However, the team took complete control
of the game in the opening minutes of the sec
ond period. After surrendering a layup to ASU
30 seconds in. Stanford held the Sun Devils
without a field goal or a free throw for more
than six minutes, during which Wiggins and
Gold-Onwude combined for 10 of 12 Stanford
points.
After building that 50-34 lead, the Cardinal
cruised through the remaining 14 minutes of
the half, never allowing Arizona State to get
within 12 points.
Stanford shot lights out all game, hitting at
a 4h.7 percent clip in the first half (with 6-for
-10 three-point shooting) before turning up the
heat in the second half with a scorching 63 per
cent performance.
Gold-Onwude said that the sharp uptick in
shooting was not a coincidence.
"We've been focusing on shooting in the
past couple practices," Gold-Onwude said.
"Especially when Candice and Jayne draw so
much attention, we have to be able to knock
those looks down."
The Cardinal built a 13-5 lead early in the
game before seeing it crumble as ASU took
the lead at 21-19 five minutes later. But with
the offense misfiring a little. Stanford reassert
ed its dominance with a complete defensive
shutdown of the Sun Devils.
With the raucous crowd counting down a
few seconds removed from the shot clock, the
Cardinal forced Arizona State into two shot
clock violations in three possessions toward
the end of the first half, as Stanford climbed
back on top behind its barrage of three-point
ers.
Stanford forced a number of ASU's 22
turnovers in that period, with Wiggins and the
other guards collapsing on the Sun Devils'
posts and stripping the ball from them again
and again.
Gold-Onwude said the defensive effort
