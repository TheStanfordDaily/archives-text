# Brook the best of the bigs

Whether it's the skilled Kevin
Love, the sharpshooting
Ryan Anderson or the bull
dozing Jon Brockman, you'd be hard
pressed to find a conference with a
better slew of big men than the Pac
-10. Of all the post players, however,
ours may be the best.
Brook Lopez's season started
with a plethora of question marks,
but since the second he stepped on
the floor in December, he's had all
the answers for Stanford.
The doubts were well-founded:
though showed great promise in his
freshman season, many believed that
the sophomore was not mature
enough or hard-working enough to
come through this season for the
Cardinal. And while some may still
question his work ethic — rightly so,
even — there's no doubting the im
pact Brook has had on the team this
season.
It was 31 points and 13 rebounds
at Washington.and then it was 19 and
16 against Arizona State at home.
But there's little point in listing
Brook's most outstanding perform
ances this year — you can take your
pick. Lopez has been at the center of
the scoring, rebounding and defen
sive efforts in nearly every one of the
Cardinal's major victories.
More important, however, he's
the heart and soul of the team's of
fense. Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Hill are certainly capable
of leading teams with their shooting,
but shooting — as evidenced by the
pair's up-and-down numbers this
year — comes and goes. And while
the play of point guard Mitch John
son has been superb, Lopez's
tremendous impact on this team is
still clear.
Brook is averaging 19.1 points
and 7.9 rebounds a game. While his

numbers aren't the loftiest com
pared to the conference's big men
— statistically, Lopez does not stand
out among the likes of Cal's Ander
son. UCLA's Love and Washing
ton's Brockman — Lopez has been
more invaluable to his team than
any of those players.
In a conference with a number of
incredibly talented players, Lopez
stands out not because of his partic
ular abilities but because of his im
mense impact and value. Sure,
Brook has a 7-foot, 260-pound
frame coupled with the soft touch of
a seasoned shooter. He's talented
just as much as the next top big man,
if not more.
But the important thing about
Lopez this season has been his con
tributions, nut his talents. Discipline
or not. problems in the classroom or
not, Lopez has unquestionably car
ried the Cardinal this season.
And if you ask me, that's why
he'd be my Pac-10 Player of the Year
as of today.
Around College Basketball
This Saturday's Tennessee-Mem
phis game is a match-up straight out
of a hoop fan's dream, for so many
reasons.
First off, the teams are ranked
No. 1 and No. 2 in the nation.
On top of that, the game has ri
valry implications, with both schools
hailing from the state of Tennessee.
Oh, and if that didn't make the
game important enough, the Tigers
come into Saturday's tussle as the
nation's only undefeated team.
Memphis is 25-0, and many have
speculated that they have a legiti
mate shot at finishing the regular
season — and maybe the whole sea
son — undefeated. Of course, the
Volunteers surely have something
to say about that.
Even further, from a basketball
fan's perspective, there probably
isn't a more exciting match-up when
it comes to fast-paced action and
high scoring. Both teams get up and
down the court, playing a 94-foot
game as opposed to a half-court one.
It wouldn't at all be surprising to see
the teams put 200 points together on
the scoreboard.
Memphis is far and away the
most talented team in the country,
but Tennessee may be the most dan
gerous. Chris Lofton is a shooter
without a conscience, and if he and
the rest of the Volunteer squad gets
hot, Tennessee just might unseat the
Tigers from its No. 1 ranking.
One thing's for sure, however:
this is the one game of the 2007-08
college basketball season you
shouldn't miss.
