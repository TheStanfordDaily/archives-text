# STUDENT GROUPS
## Special fees requests face new measure Groups must now have majority of grad and undergrad support 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
With special fees budgets due this past
week, many campus organizations are deal
ing with the ramifications of Measure A
an amendment to the ASSU Constitution
that passed during last year's elections.
Measure A stipulates that groups applying
for joint special fees — funds from both
graduates and undergraduates — must
receive the majority vote from both student
bodies, separately. As a result, some student
groups that formerly applied for joint special
fees have only applied for special fees as an
undergraduate organization this year.
This year, the Stanford News Readership
Program (SNRP), which was denied special
fees funding last year as a joint group, will be
applying only as an undergraduate group.
Last year, SNRP received only 33 percent
support from the graduate student communi
ty
"In the past, we were a joint fees group, so
it would have made it harder for us to pass
[with Measure A in place now], as graduate
support was typically harder to get," said
SNRP President Aaron Qayumi '09. "'lTiis
year, however, we are just applying for
undergnid funding because of low grad sup
port from last year."
Similarly. Ibe Stanford Daily changed its
status to an undergraduate group when
applying for special fees this year. The
Daily's Chief Operating Officer Julie Yen '07
explained that it has been historically diffi
cult to receive backing from the graduate
community. Last year. The Daily only
received 26 percent support from graduate
students during elections while gaining 82
percent of the undergraduate vote. As a
result, The Daily has opted to register as
an undergraduate student group in order to
avoid losing special fees due to the lack of
graduate backing.
Last year, all groups that applied as
undergraduate groups received approval for
their special fees requests during elections.
Some groups, however, are not concerned about
the changes that Measure A will bring about in this
year's elections.
FLiCKS Director Kyle Evaldez "09 said that
while he understands that this amendment can
make it difficult for some student organizations to
receive majority approval from undergraduate and
graduate populations. Measure A has not impacted
the special fees application process for FLiCKS.
"One minor change, however, that we did
make," Evaldez said, "is that we are spending more
money on our marketing efforts, but, as I men
tioned, we have a very good graduate student base,
so we are not too concerned with getting approval
from both populations."
Stanford's radio station KZSU also made very
few changes in its special fees application this year
due to Measure A and still applied as a joint group.
"I think the amendment makes sense, and. to bt
honest, it hasn't changed any of the ways in which
we've traditionally gone about seeking student
approval," said KZSU General Manager Kyle
Wulff '10. "The events we sponsor draw both
undergraduate and graduate students and have
done so for the majority of our years here at
Stanford, so we don't foresee any problems associ
ated with the new requirements."
"Measure A is fair, but makes it harder for
groups that in the past relied on high undergradu
ate support to compensate for lower graduate sup
port in winning Special Fees," Qayumi added.
"Groups should take this into account and make
sure to campaign aggressively to often apathetic
grad voters."
