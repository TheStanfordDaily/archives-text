After Stanford fell to UCLA and
USC on its trip to Southern Califor
nia in January, the talk buzzing
around the conference was that par
ity was king in the Pac-10 this year.
California, UCLA and USC all
looked to be on the rise, while Stan
ford looked as though it had taken a
step back, despite non-conference
wins over national powers Rutgers
and Tennessee.
Fast-forward a month and a half,
and despite California's one-game
lead over the Cardinal at the top of
the standings, it is painfully obvious
to the other nine Pac-10 teams that
Stanford is still the class of the con
ference.
The message that Stanford sent
in its 22-point victory over ASU —
the Sun Devils' steepest defeat
since an 81-55 beatdown from Con
necticut in 2003 — was the culmi
nation of the run the Cardinal start
ed against California on Jan. 26.
That game was billed as "The Battle
of the Bay" — perhaps the first
time Cal had come into a game on
equal footing with Stanford.
Instead, the Bears got crushed.
72-52. by a Stanford team on a mis
sion. Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer said on Saturday that ever
since the two losses to UCLA and
USC, Stanford has been playing as
though each game was an elimina
tion game — one loss would essen
tially eliminate the team from con
tention for the regular season title.
That mentality is clearly paying
off for the Cardinal after absolutely
steamrolling its second rival in
three weeks. Stanford gets another
chance against California in Berke
ley this weekend; do not expect the
Cardinal to let off the gas for even
one instant. This team wants to
trump its last statement game every
time it steps on the court.

match of their careers on Saturday. The duo will play in Maples again, though — Stanford is hosting the first two rounds of NCAA tournament play next month.
