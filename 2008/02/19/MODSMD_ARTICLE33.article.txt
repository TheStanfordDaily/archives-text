### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After jumping out to a two-game
lead, the No. 9 Stanford men's volley
ball team almost saw it slip away he
fore a run of points in the fifth game
preserved the 3-2 win at Pacific on Fri
day.
The Cardinal went ahead with 30-
26 and 30-19 wins in the first two
games, only to see Pacific answer with
30-24 and 32-30 victories in the next
two. With the score tied at 10 in the
final frame, Stanford went on a four
point run that put the game out of
reach, finally closing out the match,
15-11.
It was satisfying revenge for Stan
ford (9-5,5-5 MPSF), who lost to Pa
cific (1 -12,1 -9) in a sweep a few weeks
ago. The Cardinal beat the Tigers for
the first time in two years, keeping its
conference record at .500 in the com
petitive MPSF.
Sophomore opposite Evan
Romero and sophomore setter Kawi
ka Shoji paced the team with 20 and
19 kills, respectively, combining for 5
service aces. Junior middle blocker
Brandon Williams anchored the Car
dinal's net defense with 9 blocks.
