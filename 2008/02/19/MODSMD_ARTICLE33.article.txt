## Cardinal holds off Pacific Stanford withstands a ate Tigers charge to win in five games 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
After jumping out to a two-game
lead, the No. 9 Stanford men's volley
ball team almost saw it slip away he
fore a run of points in the fifth game
preserved the 3-2 win at Pacific on Fri
day.
The Cardinal went ahead with 30-
26 and 30-19 wins in the first two
games, only to see Pacific answer with
30-24 and 32-30 victories in the next
two. With the score tied at 10 in the
final frame, Stanford went on a four
point run that put the game out of
reach, finally closing out the match,
15-11.
It was satisfying revenge for Stan
ford (9-5,5-5 MPSF), who lost to Pa
cific (1 -12,1 -9) in a sweep a few weeks
ago. The Cardinal beat the Tigers for
the first time in two years, keeping its
conference record at .500 in the com
petitive MPSF.
Sophomore opposite Evan
Romero and sophomore setter Kawi
ka Shoji paced the team with 20 and
19 kills, respectively, combining for 5
service aces. Junior middle blocker
Brandon Williams anchored the Car
dinal's net defense with 9 blocks.
"Both Evan Romero and ffresh
man outside hitter] Spencer McLach
lin were hot from the beginning,"
head coach John Kosty said. "We
were passing well, and [junior setter]
Miki Groppi was running a good of
fense, and we were siding out really
well."
The Cardinal pulled ahead quick
ly to start the match, leading 15-12
halfway through. Pacific, however,
caught up, tying the score three times
hut never managing to wrest the lead
from Stanford. The Cardinal sealed
the 30-26 win in the game on a kill by
Romero, his eighth of the frame.
Romero hit .700 in the game, and
McLachlin added four kills at a .S(X)
clip, while the team hit a solid .423 for
the game.
Stanford kept on rolling into the
second game, building a 10-point lead
at 19-9 after three straight Tigers hit
ting errors. The lead held, and the
Cardinal claimed a two-game lead
with the 30-19 win.
After Pacific took the lead early in
the third, back-to-back Romero kills
and one by Shoji tied the score. The
Tigers went on a 10-5 run.and the
Cardinal could not close within two
down the stretch, dropping the game
30-24.
"Credit to UOP," Kosty said.
"They came back in game three and
played really well. They did a lot of
good things — they picked up their
serving and forced us into some bad
situations where our offense created
a few errors."
Halfway through the fourth game,
Stanford seemed to have the game in
hand with a five-point lead, but the
Tigers battled to tie at 20-all. The
teams traded points until Stanford
reached match point at 29-28. Pacif
ic's top hitter, Pekka Seppanen,
notched a kill to keep his team alive,
and the Tigers held off another match
point before taking the game, 32-30,
on a block.
Neither team could break away in
the final tiebreaking frame, and the
score was tied at 10-all when the Car
dinal suddenly took control. Romero
followed a kill with an ace,McLachlin
scored a kill and then McLachlin —
combined with Groppi and sopho
more middle blocker Garrett Werner
— got a block to bring up match point
again, at 14-10. After one more Pacif
ic kill, McLachlin sealed the win. 15-
11.
"It was a lot to do with Evan
Romero," Kosty said of the final run.
"He got a kill on a sideout for 11-10
and then went back and served us to
14-10. He put a good string of serves
together that gave them only one or
two options, and we took advantage
of that. And then Spencer put away
the kill for a sideout on match point."
McLachlin finished third on the
team with 16 kills on the night and
also posted 13 digs, second only to
Shoji's 15. Groppi finished the night
with 57 assists.
Romero continues to lead the
Cardinal on the season, with team
highs of 226 kills and 16 aces. In addi
tion, he stands second on the team
with 27 blocks and third with 77 digs.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran is
the leader in digs and second in kills
but did not play this past weekend.
Shoji has the most assists on the
roster.but, with him seeing more time
on the outside, Groppi has taken over
setting duties in the last few matches.
"We're still looking for our best
Hneup," Kosty said. "We've had really
good points in our season with a cou

pie of different ones, and we are look
ing for one which will gel and play
well for an entire match. Basically, we
are looking for consistency o\it of our
starting lineup."
After his nine-block performance
against Pacific, Williams is now the
team's top blocker, with 34.
"Blocking was good for us," Kosty
said. "We did work on it [in practice]
and got better.but we still have a ways
to go. UOP is a good team, but we
play the number one team in the
country in BYU next week, and we
will need to jump up to a whole other
level against them."
ITiis Friday and Saturday, Stan
ford will be in Utah for back-to-back
tilts with the top-ranked and unde
feated Cougars. BYU has been
pushed to five games in two of its last
three matches but has preserved its
perfect record nonetheless. The
Cougars have swept the Cardinal in
their last four meetings. Stanford has
not beaten BYU since January 2002.

down the stretch, dropping the game
30-24.
"Credit to UOP," Kosty said.
"They came back in game three and
played really well. They did a lot of
good things — they picked up their
serving and forced us into some bad
situations where our offense created
a few errors."
Halfway through the fourth game,
Stanford seemed to have the game in
hand with a five-point lead, but the
Tigers battled to tie at 20-all. The
teams traded points until Stanford
reached match point at 29-28. Pacif
ic's top hitter, Pekka Seppanen,
notched a kill to keep his team alive,
and the Tigers held off another match
point before taking the game, 32-30,
on a block.
Neither team could break away in
the final tiebreaking frame, and the
score was tied at 10-all when the Car
dinal suddenly took control. Romero
followed a kill with an ace,McLachlin
scored a kill and then McLachlin —
combined with Groppi and sopho
more middle blocker Garrett Werner
— got a block to bring up match point
again, at 14-10. After one more Pacif
ic kill, McLachlin sealed the win. 15-
11.
"It was a lot to do with Evan
Romero," Kosty said of the final run.
"He got a kill on a sideout for 11-10
and then went back and served us to
14-10. He put a good string of serves
together that gave them only one or
two options, and we took advantage
of that. And then Spencer put away
the kill for a sideout on match point."
McLachlin finished third on the
team with 16 kills on the night and
also posted 13 digs, second only to
Shoji's 15. Groppi finished the night
with 57 assists.
Romero continues to lead the
Cardinal on the season, with team
highs of 226 kills and 16 aces. In addi
tion, he stands second on the team
with 27 blocks and third with 77 digs.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran is
the leader in digs and second in kills
but did not play this past weekend.
Shoji has the most assists on the
roster.but, with him seeing more time
on the outside, Groppi has taken over
setting duties in the last few matches.
"We're still looking for our best
Hneup," Kosty said. "We've had really
good points in our season with a cou

pie of different ones, and we are look
ing for one which will gel and play
well for an entire match. Basically, we
are looking for consistency o\it of our
starting lineup."
After his nine-block performance
against Pacific, Williams is now the
team's top blocker, with 34.
"Blocking was good for us," Kosty
said. "We did work on it [in practice]
and got better.but we still have a ways
to go. UOP is a good team, but we
play the number one team in the
country in BYU next week, and we
will need to jump up to a whole other
level against them."
ITiis Friday and Saturday, Stan
ford will be in Utah for back-to-back
tilts with the top-ranked and unde
feated Cougars. BYU has been
pushed to five games in two of its last
three matches but has preserved its
perfect record nonetheless. The
Cougars have swept the Cardinal in
their last four meetings. Stanford has
not beaten BYU since January 2002.

Junior middle blocker Brandon Williams led the Cardinal volleyball team with
nine blocks in its five-game win over Pacific on Friday night. Stanford beat the
Tigers after being swept at home in their first meeting of the 2008 season.
After jumping out to a two-game
lead, the No. 9 Stanford men's volley
ball team almost saw it slip away he
fore a run of points in the fifth game
preserved the 3-2 win at Pacific on Fri
day.
The Cardinal went ahead with 30-
26 and 30-19 wins in the first two
games, only to see Pacific answer with
30-24 and 32-30 victories in the next
two. With the score tied at 10 in the
final frame, Stanford went on a four
point run that put the game out of
reach, finally closing out the match,
15-11.
It was satisfying revenge for Stan
ford (9-5,5-5 MPSF), who lost to Pa
cific (1 -12,1 -9) in a sweep a few weeks
ago. The Cardinal beat the Tigers for
the first time in two years, keeping its
conference record at .500 in the com
petitive MPSF.
Sophomore opposite Evan
Romero and sophomore setter Kawi
ka Shoji paced the team with 20 and
19 kills, respectively, combining for 5
service aces. Junior middle blocker
Brandon Williams anchored the Car
dinal's net defense with 9 blocks.
"Both Evan Romero and ffresh
man outside hitter] Spencer McLach
lin were hot from the beginning,"
head coach John Kosty said. "We
were passing well, and [junior setter]
Miki Groppi was running a good of
fense, and we were siding out really
well."
The Cardinal pulled ahead quick
ly to start the match, leading 15-12
halfway through. Pacific, however,
caught up, tying the score three times
hut never managing to wrest the lead
from Stanford. The Cardinal sealed
the 30-26 win in the game on a kill by
Romero, his eighth of the frame.
Romero hit .700 in the game, and
McLachlin added four kills at a .S(X)
clip, while the team hit a solid .423 for
the game.
Stanford kept on rolling into the
second game, building a 10-point lead
at 19-9 after three straight Tigers hit
ting errors. The lead held, and the
Cardinal claimed a two-game lead
with the 30-19 win.
After Pacific took the lead early in
the third, back-to-back Romero kills
and one by Shoji tied the score. The
Tigers went on a 10-5 run.and the
Cardinal could not close within two
down the stretch, dropping the game
30-24.
