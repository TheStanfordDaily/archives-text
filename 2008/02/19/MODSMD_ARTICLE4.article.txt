# Graduate housing cost may increase
## Munger to replace Crothers as grad option 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students looking to live on
the cheap will have fewer options start
ing in the fall of 2009.
When the Munger Graduate
Residences open in 2009, Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls will close to
graduate students. Currently the cheap
est graduate housing on campus,
Crothers charges $452 per month for a
double-occupancy room.
However, very few students live in
the one-room doubles. Most graduate
student residents in Crothers live in sin
gles that cost $640 per month, and some
are concerned that this option will no
longer be available. The next cheapest
option is a three-bedroom triple-occu
pancy apartment in Escondido Village
that costs $714 per month, meaning a
minimum of a $74 per month increase
in rent for those currently living in a sin

gle in Crothers.
"I wasn't aware that Munger would
remove Crothers from the grad housing
options," said first-year law student Oh-
Yoon Kim, a current Crothers resident.
"1 think it would be a loss for students if
we lose this low-cost housing option,
which is ideal for students who are will
ing to live the dorm life and don't have
a car."
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has been advocating for the con
tinuation of affordable housing after
Munger opens.
"The GSC would like to see another
housing option for students who will be
displaced from Crothers that is within
the same price range," said GSC Co
chair Kristina Keating, a geophysics
doctoral student.
Administrators in Student Housing
are working to find a solution.
Currently, another low-cost option
is a one-bedroom apartment in
Escondido Village that is rented to
two single students, one of whom
sleeps in the living room. According
to Rodger Whitney, executive
direc

tor of Student Housing, those apart
ments will be remodeled into two
bedroom "efficiency units" by the
time Munger opens.
"Those units will increase in
number and be comparable in costs
to the single room rates in Crothers
and Crothers Memorial," Whitney
said.
Whitney said that other housing
options around the same price as
Crothers accommodations are being
considered.

"The location and
final determination of
what units and
types has not been
made

at this point," Whitney said in an
email to The Daily. "The commit
ment has been made â€” the specific
units and location have not."
Those students who hope to live
in Munger might want to start sav
ing now. Although the official rates
will not be released until February
2009. they are expected to be high.
"Because of the array of ameni
ties provided and the size and type
of the units in Munger, the rent will
likely be at the high end of our on
campus graduate housing rates,"
said Shirley Everett, senior associ
ate vice provost for Residential and
Dining Enterprises, in an email.
Currently the high-end of gradu
ate housing is the Schwab
Residential Center, which charges
$1,193 per month.
