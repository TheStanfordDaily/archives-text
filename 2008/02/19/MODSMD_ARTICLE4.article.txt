# Graduate housing cost may increase
## Munger to replace Crothers as grad option 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students looking to live on
the cheap will have fewer options start
ing in the fall of 2009.
When the Munger Graduate
Residences open in 2009, Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls will close to
graduate students. Currently the cheap
est graduate housing on campus,
Crothers charges $452 per month for a
double-occupancy room.
However, very few students live in
the one-room doubles. Most graduate
student residents in Crothers live in sin
gles that cost $640 per month, and some
are concerned that this option will no
longer be available. The next cheapest
option is a three-bedroom triple-occu
pancy apartment in Escondido Village
that costs $714 per month, meaning a
minimum of a $74 per month increase
in rent for those currently living in a sin

gle in Crothers.
"I wasn't aware that Munger would
remove Crothers from the grad housing
options," said first-year law student Oh-
Yoon Kim, a current Crothers resident.
"1 think it would be a loss for students if
we lose this low-cost housing option,
which is ideal for students who are will
ing to live the dorm life and don't have
a car."
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has been advocating for the con
tinuation of affordable housing after
Munger opens.
"The GSC would like to see another
housing option for students who will be
displaced from Crothers that is within
the same price range," said GSC Co
chair Kristina Keating, a geophysics
doctoral student.
