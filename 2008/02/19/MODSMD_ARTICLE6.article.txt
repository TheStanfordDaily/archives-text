# CARD TAMES 'CATS
## Robin Lopez block in final seconds clinches win 
### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
It was not one hut both of the Lopez
twins who sealed the Cardinal's 67-66 victo
ry at Arizona on Saturday.
After blowing an eight-point lead in the
game's closing minutes — conjuring up
images of the team's frustrating 72-68 over
time loss to Arizona State last Thursday —
No. 9 Stanford regained the lead after soph
omore forward Brook Lopez made two free
throws with 18 seconds remaining. The
Cardinal sealed the victory in the final sec
onds when sophomore center Robin Lopez
blocked a floating layup attempt by the
Wildcats' Chase Budinger.
With the win. Stanford humbled
Arizona's once-boastful Jordan Hill. The
sophomore forward, who guaranteed a vic
tory in the Arizona Daily Wildcat before the
contest, struggled to tally five points and
four rebounds before he fouled out late in
the second half of the Cardinal's victory.
Despite 31 points from point guard
Jerryd Bayless and 23 from the sophomore
Budinger, the Wildcats were unable to fulfill
Hill's prediction and topple the Cardinal.
Budinger foreshadowed his team's trou
ble down low in the Daily Wildcat.
"The biggest thing is it's very tough to
drive on [Stanford]," he said. "Both those
Lopez twins are very good shot blockers, so
it's going to be very tough to go inside on
them."
After combining for 46 points in
Stanford's overtime loss to Arizona State on
Thursday, the sophomore twins teamed up
again to lead the Cardinal's offensive attack.
Both notched a double-double. Brook with

GAME NOTE A pair of Brook Lopez free throws and a
Robin Lopez block sealed the Cardinal's one-point vic
tory over Arizona on Saturday, giving Stanford a sea
son sweep of the Wildcats. On Sunday evening, the
Cardinal will host Cal, who also split with the Arizona
schools this weekend. On Jan. 26, Brook Lopez led
Stanford to an 82-77 win over the Golden Bears.

23 points and 10 rebounds, and Robin with
14 points and 10 boards.
Junior forward Lawrence Hill con
tributed 13 points for the Cardinal, junior
point guard Mitch Johnson dished out 8
assists and junior guard Anthony Goods,
senior forward Fred Washington and senior

forward Taj Finger all played their hearts out
in trying to shut down Bayless and
Budinger. Because of the diverse contribu
tions that helped Stanford pull out the tight
victory, head coach Trent Johnson praised

"I think all our guys played well,"
Johnson said. "Thursday was a
tough, tough loss. For them to
bounce back and beat a team this
talented and well-coached, that's
real good for us.
"You take the top 20 guys in the
conference in minutes played, and
we don't have one of them. We don't
have a single Pac-10 player of the
week. I think that speaks to the con
tributions of each member of this
team."
Stanford hit the glass hard, grab
bing 40 boards to the Wildcats' 26.
The Card also shot a respectable 22-
of-30 from the foul line. Turnovers
surfaced again as a Cardinal weak
ness — 13 offensive giveaways
nearly lost the game — but Stan
ford dug deep to halt the wildcats'
final run.
Bayless hit all 16 of his free-throw
attempts en route to his 31 points.
He displayed remarkable athleti
cism and court smarts, manning the
point guard position while cruising
to his third consecutive 30-point per
formance. Playing on his home
court, the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year candidate played far better
than he had on Jan. 17 against Stan
ford, when Fred Washington limited
him to 3-for-12 shooting.
Budinger also played far better
than his first time out against the
Cardinal. Although he scored only 8
points on 3-of-ll shooting through
the game's first 32 minutes, he found
his stroke late. Budinger's open
three with 7:23 remaining cut the
Stanford lead to 53-49 and sparked
both the Wildcat team and its crowd.
The preseason second-team Ail-
American nailed his next two three
point opportunities, the last one put
tine Arizona ahead 66-65 with 45

seconds remaining.
"We've only had three games all
year go down to the final two or
three minutes," Johnson said. "I
don't enjoy a lot of games, but I en
joyed this one — both teams played
hard and aggressive. For us to play
and win a game like that is big."
Even with the loss to Arizona
State on Thursday, the Cardinal
stayed in the top-10 in the nation.

falling only from No. 7 to No. 9. With
home games against Cal, Washing
ton and Washington State looming
before it ends the season at USC and
UCLA, the Cardinal has a legitimate
chance to enter its final regular sea
son road trip with a shot at first place
in the conference.
