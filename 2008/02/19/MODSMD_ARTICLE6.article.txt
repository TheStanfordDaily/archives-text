### BEN SPIELBERG STAFF WRITER 
It was not one hut both of the Lopez
twins who sealed the Cardinal's 67-66 victo
ry at Arizona on Saturday.
After blowing an eight-point lead in the
game's closing minutes — conjuring up
images of the team's frustrating 72-68 over

omore forward Brook Lopez made two free
throws with 18 seconds remaining. The
Cardinal sealed the victory in the final sec
onds when sophomore center Robin Lopez
blocked a floating layup attempt by the
Wildcats' Chase Budinger.
With the win. Stanford humbled
Arizona's once-boastful Jordan Hill. The
sophomore forward, who guaranteed a vic
tory in the Arizona Daily Wildcat before the
contest, struggled to tally five points and
four rebounds before he fouled out late in
the second half of the Cardinal's victory.
Despite 31 points from point guard
Jerryd Bayless and 23 from the sophomore
Budinger, the Wildcats were unable to fulfill
Hill's prediction and topple the Cardinal.
Budinger foreshadowed his team's trou
ble down low in the Daily Wildcat.
"The biggest thing is it's very tough to
drive on [Stanford]," he said. "Both those
Lopez twins are very good shot blockers, so
it's going to be very tough to go inside on
them."
After combining for 46 points in
Stanford's overtime loss to Arizona State on
Thursday, the sophomore twins teamed up
again to lead the Cardinal's offensive attack.
Both notched a double-double. Brook with
