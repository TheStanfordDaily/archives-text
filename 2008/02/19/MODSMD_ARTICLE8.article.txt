Cackler. dressed as the biblical
Adam, ate a live, two-foot garter
snake. Afterwards, he reported feeling
a little funny inside.
Shortly thereafter, a vat on wheels
— leaking copious amounts of suspi
cious green fluid — was rolled around
the corner accompanied by a man in a
suit, a man in a lab coat and several of
their friends.
The men in the suit and lab coat
told the crowd that, at the behest of
the Board of Trustees, they were
attempting to chemically create a Tree
who would have an innate aversion to
all boisterous and/or illegal activities.
Unfortunately, the chemist seemed to
have integrated part of the formula
backwards, creating the exact oppo
site of their original "goal."
Fortune sprang out of the vat to
run dripping through the students in
crowd, some laughing, others fright
ened. The participants later revealed
that the fluid in which Fortune was
submerged had been concocted from
water, flour and green food coloring.
Although Tree Week officially
began yesterday, those interested in
running may still declare their candi
dacy. as long as they do so by
Wednesday, by contacting John
Whipple at jwhipple@stanford.edu.

Patrick Fortune '09 put on the first of his stunts, demonstrating his desire to
be the next Tree — in this case by jumping out of a home-made mixture of
water, flour and green food coloring.
