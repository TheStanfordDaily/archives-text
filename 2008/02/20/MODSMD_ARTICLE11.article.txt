## Microsoft giving away software 
### JESSICA MINTZ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEATTLE — Microsoft Corp.
is giving students free access to its
most sophisticated tools for writing
software and making media-rich
Web sites, a move that intensifies
its competition with Adobe
Systems Inc. and could challenge
open source software's popularity.
The Redmond-based software
maker said late Monday it will let
students download Visual Studio
Professional Edition, a software
development environment;
Expression Studio, which
includes graphic design and Web
site and hybrid Web-desktop pro
gramming tools; and XNA Game
Studio 2.0. a video game develop
ment program.
The company will also give
away SQL Server 2005 Developer
Edition and Windows Server
Standard Edition.
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
said the company's past efforts to
arrange educational discounts for
these programs limited the number
of students who ultimately could
use them. Dream Spark, as
Microsoft is calling the free soft
ware offering, opens up access to
many more students.
It's also good for Microsoft's
business. Gates added.
"We give up some revenue, but

we gain the fact that we'll get the
feedback of these students, get
more courses to incorporate our
tools into the programs and get
more startups where kids are
familiar with Visual Studio,
Expression Studio and SQL
Server," Gates said in a phone
interview.
The program, which Microsoft
says will put its software and Web
development tools in the hands of
1 billion students, gives momen
tum to an attack Microsoft
launched on Adobe Systems Inc.
last year with the release of
Expression Studio and Silverlight,
its answer to Adobe's market
leading Photoshop and Illustrator
design programs and Flash, the
technology behind much of the
video and animation on Web
pages.
"It's a brilliant strategic move
on the part of Microsoft," said
Chris Swenson, a software indus
try analyst with NPD Group.
"This is one of the core audiences
you have to hit if you really want
to make a difference in the rich
Internet application market going
forward."
Handing out free copies of
Expression Studio to students
today increases the chance that the
next big Web 2.0 craze will be
designed with Microsoft's tools
and accessed using the Silverlight

plug-in. rather than with open
source and Adobe technology.
Dream Spark could also win a
generation of programmers away
from open source software, which
companies from small startups to
Google Inc. use as an affordable,
flexible alternative to software
from the likes of Microsoft and
database maker Oracle Inc.
Gates said students will want to
try Microsoft's tools because
they're more powerful than the
open-source combination of
Linux-based operating systems, the
Apache Web server, the MySQL
database and the PUP scripting
language used to make complex
Web sites.
But Gates said giving away
Microsoft software isn't intended
to turn students against open
source software entirely Rather, he
hopes it will just add one more tool
to their belt.
Giving away Visual Studio,
meanwhile, will help ensure a
steady stream of new desktop and
desktop-Web hybrid applications
Microsoft hopes will keep con
sumers hooked on Windows PCs,
even as more programs migrate to
the Web.
The programs are available now
to more than 35 million college stu
dents in the U.S.. Belgium. China,
Finland, France, Germany, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland and the UK..
