## Bender gives view on Middle East Jewish feminist discusses experience in Palestine 
### NIKHIL KAMAT 
In continuation of its speaker
series on the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict, Students Confronting
Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) hosted
activist Kate Raphael Bender last
night at the Women's Community
Center. Bender, co-founder of
Queers Undermining Israeli
Terrorism (QUlT!),reflected on her
experience as a queer Jewish femi
nist campaigning for Palestinian
rights in Israel, Palestine and the
United States.
Bender is the most recent speak
er in SCAI's "Women Under Fire:
Jewish Resistance Against Israeli
Apartheid" series.
Bender, who has traveled in
Israel and Palestine extensively,
spoke about how her previous
activism involving human rights in
Central America and South Africa,
coupled with her Jewish identity,
fueled her desire to be involved with
the plight of Palestinian refugees.
"I had done Central American
solidarity work. South African soli
darity work," Bender said, "but

somehow because
of the level in
which I had been
in active support of
the State of Israel.
I felt that I should
really go and give
more active sup
port to the
Palestinian people
in their struggle for
justice."

Bender — who was jailed twice
and subsequently deported from
Israel — highlighted many of the dif
ficulties she faced as a Palestinian
rights activist. On her first trip to
Palestine in 2(X)2, her group's activi
ties were interrupted by an Israeli
raid in the West Bank. She decided to
stay in the refugee camps in
Bethlehem in the hopes that an inter
national presence would deter
Israel's presence.
Bender said that her queer femi
nist identity was pivotal in her deci
sion to become a Palestinian activist,
despite the fact that many of the peo
ple for whose rights she was cam
paigning may not have supported her
views.
But Bender said that her stance as
a queer feminist encouraged her to
seek justice for marginalized people.
She said that she learned that there
were many opportunities for

Palestinian women to take active
roles in society through protest.
"Some of the things that 1 felt best
about being able to do were give sup
port to women who themselves were
trying to break out of the restrictions
in their communities," Bender said.
"Quite often, it was the case that just
seeing us do something made other
women feel that they could be at the
front of demonstrations."
Hie question and answer session
with Bender sparked moments of
heated debate. Several audience
members grilled Bender over the
sensitive issues of suicidc bombings
and the state of gay and lesbian rights
in conservative Muslim societies.
In response. Bender said that
oftentimes Americans fail to recog
nize potential differences between
the views of political entities and
those of individuals.
"Because of the anti-Islam cli
mate in this country, people believe
that it's OK to punish any Arab for
what any person, what any govern
ment does in a part of the world they
loosely consider the Middle East,"
Bender said. "It's important not to
try to hold Palestinians responsible
for what any Muslim or any Arab
does that we don't like."
