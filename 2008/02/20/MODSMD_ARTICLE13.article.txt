## College donations rise 
### JUSTIN POPE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Donations to colleges and uni
versities rose solidly last year, to a
record of nearly $30 billion, with the
wealthiest universities again attract
ing a hugely disproportionate share,
a new survey shows. But the eco
nomic downturn means the
fundraising pace for 2008 could
slow.
Private donations to higher edu
cation rose 6.3 percent last year to
$29.75 billion, according to the
annual Voluntary Support of
Education survey, to be released
Wednesday by the Council for Aid
to Education.
Hie survey tracks donations by
fiscal year, so the report for 2007

essentially covers the 2006-2007
school year and doesn't reflect the
economic slowdown that began last
fall.
The already wealthy schools -
with leading faculty researchers and
the most sophisticated fundraising
operations - had the most success
attracting new donations. The top 20
fundraisers raised $SIN million more
than the previous year, and a total of
$7.66 billion. They account for just 2
percent of survey respondents, but
accounted for more than a quarter
of all contributions to colleges and
universities, and nearly one-third of
the total increase in giving.
Stanford University raised $832.4
million, the most of any institution.
