## College donations rise 
### JUSTIN POPE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Donations to colleges and uni
versities rose solidly last year, to a
record of nearly $30 billion, with the
wealthiest universities again attract
ing a hugely disproportionate share,
a new survey shows. But the eco
nomic downturn means the
fundraising pace for 2008 could
slow.
Private donations to higher edu
cation rose 6.3 percent last year to
$29.75 billion, according to the
annual Voluntary Support of
Education survey, to be released
Wednesday by the Council for Aid
to Education.
Hie survey tracks donations by
fiscal year, so the report for 2007

essentially covers the 2006-2007
school year and doesn't reflect the
economic slowdown that began last
fall.
The already wealthy schools -
with leading faculty researchers and
the most sophisticated fundraising
operations - had the most success
attracting new donations. The top 20
fundraisers raised $SIN million more
than the previous year, and a total of
$7.66 billion. They account for just 2
percent of survey respondents, but
accounted for more than a quarter
of all contributions to colleges and
universities, and nearly one-third of
the total increase in giving.
Stanford University raised $832.4
million, the most of any institution.
though its total was down from the $911 million it
raised in the previous year - the largest one-year
haul ever for a university. Next was Harvard ($614
million), which has the largest total endowment,
followed by the University of Southern California
($469.7 million) and Johns Hopkins ($430.5 mil
lion).
Next year's survey could mark the end of an
extraordinary run for higher education that has let
at least 76 institutions build endowments of $1 bil
lion or more, according to the most recent figures
from the National Association of College and
University Business Officers.
During the last economic slowdown, in fiscal
2002 and 2003, fundraising growth was stagnant
for two straight years.
"Anything to do with the economy, when peo
ple don't feel good, whether it's justified or not, it
doesn't put them in a philanthropic mind-set as
easily, there's no question about it," said Paul
Robell, vice president for development and alum
ni affairs at the University of Florida. "It's just
really a state of mind more than anything else."
