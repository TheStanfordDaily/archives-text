## Editorial Board Superdelegates threaten democracy 
### 
I n this tight primary season, hitherto un
known "superdelegates" have suddenly
. beeome important. I lowever, many peo
ple still know very little about these 7% party
insiders — comprised of Congressmen, for
mer presidents, party officials, union leaders
and other Democratic insiders who could
very well determine the outcome of the 2(X>B
election.
I irst and foremost, the idea of superdele
gates is anti-democratic, for each superdele
gate h;is a disproportionate weight in deter
mining the Democratic candidate. I urther
more, in this election, the superdelegates
formally designated "unpledged party leader
and elected official delegates" but colloquial
ly referred to as superdelegates — should re
spect, rather than subvert, the popular will.
Sadly, subversion is what the superdele
gates are all about. Ihey may not have mat
tered in previous elections, but they were cre
ated to give party officials control over the
nomination, and they are free to support any
candidate they choose.
After the riotous 1%8 Democratic Na
tional Convention in ( hicago, the party ap
plied new rules to diminish control by party
insiders and make the nomination process
more responsive to the popular will. Hut
party leaders feared that the reduction ol
their control weakened the Democratic tick
et,and so in 1982,the I lunt ( ommission pro
posed the idea of superdelegates.
In 19.84, a close race between insurgent
Colorado Senator Gary Hart and the estab
lishmcnt former Vice President Waller Mon
dale somewhat paralleled our current elec
tion. With the candidates close in the popular
vote, the superdelegates threw their support
behind Mondalc. Mondale went on to lose
spectacularly to the incumbent Ronald Rea
gan,who won 49 states, 6() percent of the pop
ular vote and a record 525 out of 538 electoral
votes. So much for the wisdom of party elders.
Ihere are those who believe the superdel
egates deserve their outsi/ed roles due to
years of service and political knowledge.
Contrary to the idea of "one person, one
vote," I )an Abramsol MSNIK estimates that
the vote of each superdelegate at the conven
tion is worth almost IO.tHX) votes in a primary

or caucus. And why should we trust a party of
ficial. who might owe someone a favor, to
make a better decision than average citizens?
With regard to clectability, these better-in
lormed superdelegates have a rather pitiful
track record.as they have selected only a sin
gle successful presidential candidate in the
last 28 years.
Ilie arguments over the role ol superdele
gates essentially boil down to trusting the
popular will to choose a Democratic candi
date versus trusting 796 people well-versed in
polities. Senator Barack < )bama"s CD-Ill.)
presidential campaign — which happens to
be leading in the number of pledged dele
gates. though rival Senator Hillary Clinton
(D-N.Y.) has a lead in superdelegates — un
surprisingly favors having the superdelegates
decide based on who's leading in pledged del
egates.
"My strong belief is that if we end up with
the most states and the most pledged dele
gates from the most voters in the country, that
it would be problematic for the political insid
ers to overturn the judgment of the voters."
()bama told reporters in Seattle on I eb. 8.
I lis chief'campaign strategist David Axel
rod told ('BS's"l ace the Nation" last Sunday
that the name "superdelegates'"doesn't mean
that they should leap over the will of the peo
ple in a single bound. It means they should
pay attention to what's going on and make a
judgment as to who would be the strongest
candidate, based on the results of the primar
ies."
Ihe ("linton campaign,in contrast, has re
peatedly stated that the superdelegates
should choose the candidate they think is
best. "Superdelegates are, by design, sup
posed to exercise independent judgment,"
( linton said at a news conference in Maine.
"I think there is a concern when the public
speaks and there is a counter-decision
made to that," I louse Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) said of the controversy. "I don't
think that will happen." lust in case, a coali
tion of left-wing bloggers have created the
"Superdelegate Transparency Project "on the
existing ( ongresspedia wiki. Site visitors can
easily view whom the superdelegates
have endorsed, how their districts
voted and whether or not their en
dorsements are aligned with their
constituents' choice. I"he hope is that
the popular will will he obvious, in
which case superdelegates will sup
port that candidate.
Regardless of who the leading
candidate is, the superdelegates have
an obligation to respect the will of the
American people. Because defying it
will tear the Democratic Party apart,
raise the specter of the 2000 election
and question core democratic princi
ples. If superdelegates make their
backroom deals based on "electabili
ty" and"the good of the party," these
decisions just might prove to be their
kryptonite.
