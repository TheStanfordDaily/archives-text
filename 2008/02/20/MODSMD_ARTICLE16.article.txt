## An ode to Hennessy 
### 
President John Hennessy is an adminis
trative genius. I lis main virtue is his abil
ity to use his Silicon Valley contacts to
raise billions upon billions of dollars for Stan
ford. But my greatest respect for him lies in
his ability to quell undergraduate protest.
livery year there are at least three or four
groups that stir up a tempest in a teapot by
asking Stanford to divest from Israel or the
Sudan, stop using sweatshop labor or pay its
workers a "living wage." Ilien they stage a
bunch of protests, clog up bike traffic by lay
ing down in a main intersection, have a
hunger strike or two and maybe just end up
urinating in the President's office.
And every year I lennessy handles it the
same way. He schedules meetings with the
group, then reschedules them, then meets
with them and agrees to nothing, and finally,
at the end of the year, makes some token con
cessions. But here's the genius part: I le never
actually implements those compromises. He
knows that the movements' organi/ers will
graduate at the end of the year, and it'll take
t he group at least two years to reorganize and
recogni/e their supposed "victory" was en
tirely empty.
The chief victim of this tactic has been the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition. SI .AC's
first round of "concessions" came after a
hunger strike in 2(X).l Bight around the time
they realized that the agreement they signed
had not actually benefited a single worker,
they geared up and organized another
hunger strike in 2(H)7. By the time they realize
that the latest agreement won't be honored
either.it will be 2012.
Ihe Stanford Sweat-1 ree people received
similar treatment.They trumpeted Stanford's
agreement to join the Worker Rights Consor
tium, but glossed over the fact that Stanford
didn't join the program that would have actu
ally changed the way we do business,the I )es
ignated Suppliers Program. Signing the DSP
is what lost tiie I Jniversity ofC )regon so many
valuable Phil Knight dollars. (Knight MBA
'62 is the founder of Nike, a frequent target of
anti-sweatshop activists and a huge Stanford
donor.)
I lennessy seems to have decided that he is
willing to wait out any sort of student activism

for years, if necessary, and then re-fight the
same battles all over again as each new gener
ation of campus activists decides to jump on
the we're-going-to-save-the-world bandwag
on. And do you know why this works? It's be
cause no one really cares...not even the peo
ple who are ostensibly leading the charge.
I blame it on high school history class.
I veryone is taught that all you need is a huge
concert in a middle of nowhere, and sudden
ly, BAM. civil rights happen. ()r a bunch of
people decide to march somewhere, and
BAM, India is free of British oppression.
Iliat's not how it works. Didn't the Iraq war
protests teach them anything? l ive hundred
thousand people gathering in some public
square for a leisurely afternoon doesn't
change a thing.
What changes minds is real sacrifice, (let
ting clubbed by policemen who then throw
you in jail while you're still bleeding. ()r flee
ing to Canada, never knowing if you will re
turn to the country of your birth. Non-violent
protest is not passive. It involves people radi
cally changing their lives for something they
passionately believe. (ienerally all that hap
pens is a couple gatherings in White Plaza be
tween classes. And even when something a bit
more spectacular, like a hunger strike, hap
pens, it's brief and easy to ignore. All this
protesting is lame and everyone knows it's
lame and that's why you never get any
where.
If you want to change things, then make it
expensive for the University to ignore you.
Persuade faculty members to stop teaching
their classes in the middle of the quarter, dis
rupt class, graffiti walls with your slogans,

hack computers or physically block
cars on the streets.
None of these things can be ig
nored. And if you do them for long
enough and make enough of a ruckus,
the University will realize that it is
cheaper to do what you want rather

than ignore you. Unfortunately, what
makes these actions so effective is
that they have real consequences â€”
you could be suspended or expelled
for them. But none of you really care
about these causes enough to risk
your future for them. And if you don't
care, then why should I?

Neither this column, nor any of those
which preceded it or will appear in the
future, are satire. Email Rahul at
