# Silent on frosh expansion

### 
President John Ilennessy's column in
Stanford Magazine last fall advocating
an increase in undergraduate students
seemed poised to start a healthy debate
within the University. Since then, however,
there's been no new information or discus
sion about the proposal from either the ad
ministration or The Daily.
Ibis is not to say that I'm opposed to the
class-size increase — there's not enough in
formation out there to argue one way or the
other. Hut having reported on the I 'niversi
ty before, I know that they are I'.R. wizards.
They have no qualms using Hush Adminis
tration-levels of secrecy to fast-track major
changes, all without a substantive debate.
In fact,we have no idea what is really mo
tivating this proposal. Ilennessy's column
cited the number of "deserving" students
who must be turned away each year.
"I have been president for seven years
and it is still one of the most difficult parts of
the job to explain to parents with gifted chil
dren why a son or daughter was denied ad
mission," Ilennessy wrote, sounding like a
doctor facing the anguished relatives of a pa

tient who "didn't make it."
Hut I lennessy's core argument has huge
flaws, l irst, it wrongly suggests that Stanford
has a responsibility to peg enrollment levels
to the rising number of qualified students.
Second,it perpetuates the myth that a dozen
or so top-ranked schools hold the monopoly
on a great education,
(Hy the way,are we to think that the pres
ident of a major university actually justifies
individual admission decisions?)
What else might be driving the proposal?
()bviously there is a fundraising angle here,
as larger enrollment would increase the
chance that a Sergey Hrin or a Larry Page
will invent some new technology in their
dormroom. Moreover. Ilennessy's rhetoric
about a "more global outlook" seems to cor
roborate the rumor that the administration
wants to boost the number of international
students. I low many of the extra admissions
spots would go to these targeted demo
graphics?
Additionally, Stanford has had a habit of
piggy-backing on the proposals of other
schools, especially Yale. We followed Yale's

increase in financial aid for lower income
families;we followed their launch of a gigan
tic new capital campaign ("'Hie Stanford
Challenge"); and now we are aping their
proposal to admit more students, which was
broached by Yale President Richard Levin
several months before I Icnnessy's column.
At least Yale has been slightly less stingy
with details. Marly in the expansion discus
sion, l evin floated a specific figure for the
number of additional students, around 10
percent, and explained how they would be
accommodated, by building two super-ex
pensive residential colleges.

By contrast, the only new devel
opment at Stanford since Hen
nessy's column was the establish
ment of a closed-door task force
that met for the first time on Jan. 28.
Task force members include such
well-known donors as Peter Bing'ss
and Wendy Munger '72. The only
student on the task force is ASSU
President I lershey Avula '08. Leav
ing aside the question of Avula's
judgment, of which 1 know nothing,
is anyone naive enough to think that
an ASSU president, whose job es
sentially makes him a part of the ad
ministration, can fully represent stu
dent concerns?
When I asked about the Jan. 28
meeting, Avula said it was "strictly
confidential" and directed me to Jeff
Wachtel, Hennessy's right-hand
man, who is also a task force mem
ber. When I emailed Wachtel to in
quire about innocuous details like a
schedule of task force dates, he was
annoyed at having been contacted
by two separate people from The
Daily within a week. He suggested 1
was wasting his time.
Needless to say, this is not an aus
picious start on the public relations
front.
If 1 have learned anything about
how decisions are made here, it's
that the word "preliminary" always

means "pretty much decided." So,
when the task force releases its "pre
liminary" report this fall, I would not
be surprised if Stanford already has
donors lined up for new dorms, fac
ulty and other campus resources,
making it impossible to slow the mo
mentum for the project.
Indeed, that's exactly what is
happening at Yale, where adminis
trators managed to create an illu
sion of dialogue by hosting a series
of "town-hall meetings" and "de
bates." Yale released its own "viabil
ity" report on Monday. Thing is, on
the same day the report was re
leased, Yale also announced that a
construction budget and fundraising
plan are in the works — Stanford
will try to do the same.
Aside from the demographics
question, there are real issues at
stake for future students. Chief
among them is the problem of space,
particularly housing. It's hard to
imagine an expansion without the
construction of more ugly, antiseptic
housing like the Manzanita dorms,
which severely detract from the
unique character of Stanford Hous
ing.
Now is the time to start asking
tougher questions about this pro
posal. Later will almost certainly be
too late.

For a vision of the near future, Bren
dan invites students to look at the Yale
Daily News Web site this week. Email
