# University announces bold aid policy
## Parents earning under $100,000 not expected to pay tuition in 2008-2009 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
In what the University called its largest
financial aid increase in history, Stanford
announced that it will significantly reduce
the expected contributions of lower- and
middle-income families to tuition and
other educational expenses for students
enrolled in the 2008-2009 academic year.
Parents with incomes of less than
$100,000 will no longer be expected to pay
tuition under the new plan, while those
with incomes of less than $60.(XX) will not
be expected to contribute to tuition or the
costs of room, board and other education
al expenses.
University officials expect the average
parent contribution for students receiving
financial aid to decrease by 16 percent.
In addition to lowering expectations
for parents, the changes will also lessen
the burden of expected contributions
from students who are on financial aid.
Students will no longer be required to
apply for loans as part of their financial
aid packages.
"This is a significant change in the way
we do business in the Financial Aid
Office," said Director of Financial Aid

Karen Cooper.
According to a press release issued by
the University, the changes will bring
Stanford's undergraduate financial aid
program to more than $114 million —
from $76 million in 2007-2008, as reported
in a Feb. 21,2007 Daily article. This makes
it one of the largest programs of its kind in
the nation. According to a University Web
site describing enhancements to the finan
cial aid policy, the need-based scholarship
budget has increased by $20.7 million to a
total budget of $97.2 million.
Cooper said part of the motivation for
the changes was to send a clear message
to low- and middle-income families that
Stanford is affordable, especially to those
students who do not consider applying to
Stanford for financial reasons.
"By devoting more resources to finan
cial aid, we seek to underscore what has
long been the case — that no high-school
senior should rule out applying to
Stanford because of cost," President John
Hennessy said in a written statement. "We
understand how families face serious
financial pressures, and we are doing all
we can to assist them."
The University also announced total
undergraduate tuition and fees would

increase by 3.5 percent to $47,212, com
pared to $45,608 for the current academic
year.
"Although Stanford's tuition has gone
up over the past five years, thanks to our
increasingly generous financial aid pro
gram, families with incomes less than
$150,000 will find a Stanford education
much more affordable than it was five
years ago," University Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. *82 said in a statement.
"For most of these students, attending
Stanford will cost less than most private
and many public universities."'
Cooper said families who are on finan
cial aid are generally protected from
tuition increases because the expected
parent contribution remains relatively the
same from year to year for most students.
Any increase in tuition is usually matched
by an increase in scholarship funds made
available to students on financial aid.
Cooper added.
TTie University's announcement comes
more than two months after Harvard
University declared it would significantly
increase financial aid granted to middle
class and upper-middle-class students.
Several schools, including Yale and
Dartmouth, made similar announcements

amid growing concerns that tuition at
some of the nation's top universities is
becoming too expensive for families to
afford.
Hennessy noted that the changes mark
the third consecutive year Stanford has
allocated more money to financial aid for
lower- and middle-income families.
"This is a track we have been on,"
Cooper said. "Certainly we were aware of
other announcements happening and cog
nizant of the fact that we need to compete
for these students. But a big driver for the
decisions that were made was really
what's right for Stanford families."
The changes have been made possible
partly through the success of the
University's fundraising campaigns and
its decision last year to increase its endow
ment payout from 5.0 to 5.5 percent,
according to Cooper. The University
plans to double the financial aid goal of its
current fundraising campaign, the
Stanford Challenge, to $200 million.
Cooper said the new changes make
it possible for some students to receive
aid even if they had not previously qual
ified. She anticipates seeing more appli-

CHANGES TO STANFORD'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR THE
2008-2009 ACADEMIC YEAR:

expected to pay tuition
■ Parents earning under $60,(XX)/year will not be
expected to pay tuition, room, board and other edu
cational expenses
■ The average family contribution will decrease by 16
percent
■ Students will not be expected to apply for loans as
part of their aid packages
■ TUition and fees will increase by 3.5 percent to
$47,212
THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE WILL ALSO:
■ Cap the amount of home equity in the parent asset
calculation at 1.2 times the annual income
■ Increase the portion of parent assets that will not be
assessed, for most families
■ Adjust the parent income calculation to reflect
higher cost of living in some areas
■ Divide the calculated parent contribution evenly
among multiple siblings in college
■ Decrease the assessment rate for student assets
from 25 percent to 5 percent

Information comes from Stanford press releases and a
Stanford Web site explaining enhancements to the finan
cial aid program.
cations come in from students who
are on the margin of qualifying for
aid.
"We want to reach out to those
families who feel like it's difficult,"
Cooper said. "If we said "no' in the
past, this might be the year to try
again."
Three out of every four Stanford
undergraduates currently receive
some form of financial aid, according
to the University.
Cooper said she has high hopes for
the changes to Stanford's aid pro
gram.
"I think we're going to have one
of the most generous financial aid
programs in the country." Cooper
said.
