## The 						power of knowledge "The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance."

— Socrates, (I. .?W li. C. E.
All of us came to Stanford for one rea
son: the attainment ol knowledge.
Stanford is a bastion of learning;
Stanford is a place where scholars in all aca
demic fields can achieve their lull potential
and pass on knowledge to the next genera
tion of thinkers. Knowledge is powerful.
Which is why I am a little suspicious of a
non-academic in this case, an adult-film
star — teaching the Stanford community a
lesson on Islam.

In his op-cd liist Iriday ("Racism and in
tolerance: disappointing at a liberal universi
ty." leb. 151. Mr. Michael I ucas viciously dis
paraged Islam as a religion of "backwardness
and hate." Yes, everybody has a right to free
speech. However, when publishing at Stan
lord, one must uphold the academic stan
dards of this University. It is unfair and a dis
service to the I Jniversity,faculty and students
to lie about the facts.'lhe Ouran did not "tor
ment humanity" for 1.4(H) years; in fact, it
gave women the right to divorce before any
other world religion. It is not true that Mus
lim women "cannot go to school" or are
"barred from public life" — Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Turkey have all

had heads-of-state who have been women,
something even America cannot claim about
it sell. And contrary to Mr. I ucas's claim,
Islam does not "suppress every progressive
thought" —in fact, during the European
"Dark Ages," Islamic scholars were the lead
ing authorities in science, mathematics, phi
losophy and literature.
What is most troubling about Mr. I ucas's
comments, however,is his failure to differen
tiate between the religion of Islam itself and
the way certain communities have applied it.
An isolated action in the Muslim community
does not necessarily represent the Islamic re-

Co-terminal Illness
ligion. Just as Christianity cannot
and should not be defined by Cru
sades, the Inquisition or the institu
tional slavery of non-Europeans for
over 300 years, Islam cannot be de
fined by the Taliban or state-spon
sored government actions. Islam,
like all world religions, is not a mono
lithic concept.
Although his academic creden
tials are dubious, I would have ap
plauded Mr. Lucas for focusing on a
subject he is very experienced with:
sexual health. Yet instead of using
the power of his knowledge to con

vey to readers the importance of safe
sex, Mr. Lucas decided to impose his
misguided opinions about Islam on
the Stanford student body.
I am confident that the Stanford
community did not buy into Mr.
Lucas's absurd remarks on Islam.
But I would encourage Mr. Lucas to
bridge the gap in his own knowledge
rather than asking that the "hole" in
our education be brought to the at
tention of the Stanford faculty. In
fact. I would be curious about where
Mr. Lucas attained his mastery of
Islam. In a university setting, stu
dents and professors must study for
years before they can become an au
thority on any subject; listening to a
few lectures and reading a single
book about Islam does not justify
making sweeping generalizations

about a whole religion. Knowledge
does not come cheaply; it is earned
through years of rigorous study and
genuine scholarship.
If we allow anybody to express
their opinion on anything, then we
are losing our integrity as an aca
demic institution. Freedom of
speech should not be confused with
freedom to tell untruths. As students
at Stanford, we are expected to abide
by the Stanford Fundamental Stan
dard, which states that we must show
respect for morality and personal
honor. I am not angry at Mr. Lucas
for his contemptuous words or
scornful attitude; I am only disap
pointed that he was dishonest in his
writing and unjust in his portrayal of
Islam.
Although Mr. Lucas could have

used his position as a safe-sex activist
in the adult-entertainment business
to further advocate positive change,
he instead chose to incite hatred
through deceit. Although Mr. Lucas
was provided with the chance to in
spire the hearts of hundreds of Stan
ford students, he instead opted to
disparage them for their "wanton
impudence." 1 am shocked that Mr.
Lucas demonstrated such an utter
disdain for knowledge. It is a shame
that at a center of learning, we invit
ed a master of ignorance: an individ
ual who answers before he hears, op
poses before he understands, and
judges what he does not know.
