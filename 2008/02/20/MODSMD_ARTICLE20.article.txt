All of us came to Stanford for one rea
son: the attainment ol knowledge.
Stanford is a bastion of learning;
Stanford is a place where scholars in all aca
demic fields can achieve their lull potential
and pass on knowledge to the next genera

Which is why I am a little suspicious of a
non-academic in this case, an adult-film

"barred from public life" — Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Turkey have all
