## ASSU president reflects on tenure 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
Senators at last night's two-hour ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting passed over 40 fund
ing bills and were audience to the State of the
Association Address delivered by President Hershey
Avula 'OS.
Avula began his address by reflecting on his early
days in the ASSU Senate.
"My first year on the Senate was — to put it blunt
ly— frustrating, seemingly without accomplishment
and far too short," he said. "I decided to use my year
of experience on the Senate as a learning tool and
platform for progress in the second term."
Avula also urged the senators to further pursue the
initiatives born during his administration, such as
reform of financial aid, the transformation of Old
Union into a recreational space, reform of the housing
draw and the implementation of a more sustainable
lifestyle on the Farm.
"Use your power and influence to change the way
students see sustainability," he urged the senators.
"Elected leaders believe not only in the cause [of sus
tainability], but in the lifestyle."
Campus Advocacy Chair Sarah Golabek-Goldman
'10 also updated the Senate on her correspondence
with I loover Director John Raisian regarding the invi
tation sent to former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld to speak on campus.
According to Golabek-Goldman, Raisian
expressed a willingness to have Rumsfeld speak at "an
alternate event" about his relationship with Stanford
if he does not accept the invitation to speak on the
Farm.
Following Avula's address, an ASSU member told
the Senate that the petition Web site for the ASSU's
upcoming elections was recently opened.
'ITie senators then moved on to address some 42
funding bills, but first listened to a 20-minute pitch by
Julie Yen '07. business manager and chief operating
officer ofThe Stanford Daily. Yen urged the Senate to
pass a resolution putting ITie Daily on the elections
ballot. The Daily is asking for $51,4(H) in special fees,
as the paper is in debt.
A few senators grilled Yen regarding the reasons
for pursuing a new, nearly $3.8 million building during
a fiscally precarious time, but Senator Luukas lives '09
said the excessive questioning was unfair.
"We have not grilled any other group like this,"
lives told the Senate. "We would be singling The Daily
out if we were to deny their request."
Eventually,The Daily's request for special fees was
put on the ballot following a Senate vote of 9-4. Eight
votes were required for the resolution to pass.
The Senate passed nine regular fees bills and 33
special fees bills over the course of almost an hour.
Although last night's meeting spanned more than
two hours, it was not without joviality.
Reacting to the large number of funding bills on
the Senate's plate last night, Senator Stuart Baimel '09
jokingly requested a motion to shoot himself in the
face. Several fellow senators quickly seconded
Baimel's motion.
