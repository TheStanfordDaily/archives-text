## Power outage affects Row houses 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The lights went out in at least five campus res
idences just before 6 p.m. yesterday evening for a
little over an hour. Affected Stanford houses
included Grove Mayfield, Synergy. Phi Kappa Psi,
Kairos and Haus Mitteleuropa.
The residents in Grove Mayfield and Kairos
ate dinner by candlelight, while those living in Phi
Psi used candles and Maglite flashlights.
Grove Mayfield staff members were forced to
cancel some 2009 staff interviews on account of
the blackout.
"There was one girl calling in on Skype and we
had to reschedule," Resident Assistant Sureel
Sheth '08 said. "It was unfortunate."
Central campus power is split between two
sources. General Electric power — called
Cardinal CoGen on campus — controls 60 per
cent of the central campus, while Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E) supplies the other 40 percent.
Stanford Hospitals & Clinics, along with some
campus residences, rely on the city of Palo Alto
for power.
Power went out in the PG&E zone, but PG&E
was unavailable for comment at press time.
Student Housing did not have specific informa
tion about the outage.
Though Grove Mayfield lost power, Grove
Lasuen, located next door on the corner of
Mayfield Avenue and Campus Drive, was not
affected.
"Lasuen's power [controls] the Internet for all
the lower row, so these houses would not have
Internet [if Lasuen's power went out]," said
Grove Lasuen's Residential Computing
Consultant Adam Hahn '08.
