## 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) will temporarily suspend its tour program
beginning Mar. 1.
According to SLAC's Web site, large construc
tion projects and 2008 federal budget cuts precip
itated the program's suspension. The budget cuts
are already responsible for some 200 layoffs at the
world-renowned research facility according to the
Jan. 14 Daily article "Short on funds, SLAC cuts
jobs."
Along with carrying out new construction, the
center will be moving its main focus from high
energy physics to photon science which, according
to SLAC's Web site, necessitates a revamping of
the tour program so it better reflects the research
taking place.
The tour is slated to return in 2009. Until then,
the center will continue its quarterly public lec
tures, as well as tours during the University's grad
uation weekend.
