## Clemens hearings muddled 
### 
"Come writers and critics, who proph
esy with your pen,
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won Y
come again.
But don V speak too soon, for the wheel's
still in spin.
And there \no tellin' who it is namin \
And the loser to now will he later to win.
For the times, they are a-changin'"
—Bob Dylan,
"Tlw Times, They Are A-Changin'"
While his former brethren re
ported to spring training,
Roger Clemens was sum
moned to Capitol Hill to testify be
fore the House Committee on Over
sight and Government Reform on his
alleged use of performance enhanc
ing drugs.
It was in essence the Mitchell Re
port vs. Clemens in a high-profile set
ting. But predictably, nothing came of
it: Clemens professed his innocence
while others assured the committee of
his guilt. The offensive against the
seven-time Cy Young award winner
was led by Brian McNamee.the train
er who allegedly injected Clemens
with steroids while he was with the
New York Yankees. McNamee was
the major source for the Mitchell Re
port.
Although nothing substantial is
proven by the Report's findings,
Henry Waxman (D-Fla.), the chair
man of the committee, decided that
there was enough proof of Clemens's
guilt to start holding hearings.
Let's take a pause and think about
what could be achieved by such an en
deavor — it is in our own interest,
since hearings require our money and
representatives' time.
Neither Clemens nor McNamee is
a trained public speaker — most
ballplayers will keep their comments
to the media short. A simple "we
made a lot of progress tonight" will
suffice. And trainers like McNamee
almost never interact with the press.
Yet, they are expected to be inter
viewed for hours about specific mo-
merits years in the past by this coun
try's most ruthless and publicity
crazed judges: the U.S. Congress. Ap
pearing in front of such a hostile com
mittee — Waxman had said many
times, on record, that he felt Clemens
was guilty -would be intimidating
to anyone.
It's hard to believe that, in that sit
uation. Clemens could say anything
besides the obvious "1 didn't do it"
with any gusto — and that is exactly
what happened. I le and McNamee
went back and forth and said nothing
that wasn't already obvious. They
were verbally beat up by Republicans
and Democrats alike, but to no avail.
What we were left with was yet an
other inconclusive Congressional
hearing into steroids that went so
poorly that Waxman admitted the
next day that he wished he hadn't
held the conference.
"I think Clemens and McNamee
both came out quite sullied, and I did
n't think it was a hearing that needed
to be held in order to get the facts out
about the Mitchell report," Waxman
said to the New York Times.
Forget for a second that the
Mitchell Report is nothing more than
circumstantial testimony given by
former clubhouse gophers that is dis
credited by baseball players, execu
tives and the media alike: Waxman is
admitting that this grotesque waste of
resources — whose result was about
as predictable as the sun rising in the
east — served literally no purpose.
Waxman claims that Clemens

wanted the hearing to prove his inno
cence in light of Andy Pettitte's recent
comments on Clemens's guilt, hut that
reasoning is terribly flawed — not
only were the hearings called before
Pettitte's comments,but who grasps at
a chance to perjure themselves?
In actuality, the recent circus
around steroids is mainly Waxman's
doing. After the good congressmen
called for the hearings months ago
while simultaneously declaring
Clemens's guilt, the media followed
his lead, and almost immediately
deemed Clemens guilty as well. 'ITie
battle is won in the court of public
opinion, and Clemens never had a
chance. What ensued was a rush to
judgment comparable to the Duke
Lacrosse rape case. The hearings, at
that point, became a necessity.
So, Mr. Waxman, who is lying
now?
If Clemens and the other players
in the Mitchell Report are guilty of
steroid abuse, they deserve to be pun
ished. But until there is definitive
proof that they did. in fact, use per
formance enhancing drugs, Waxman
and the rest of his committee must
hold their judgment — and desire to
hold hearings — in check.
In the meantime, aren't there
more demanding issues that require
resolution from the U.S. Congress?
Last I checked, we're in the midst of
an on-going war, along with a shaky
economy and national infrastructure
in ruins.
Baseball will be fine — surely our
public servants have better things to
do than lie to us and waste our time.
