2/14 vs. Saint Mary's W 6-1

1:30 RM.

GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford picked up an easy victory
over Saint Mary's last week, 6-1. The Cardinal won all
three doubles matches and won five singles matches in
straight sets. Stanford stands at 4-1, while N0.9 Cal is 3-
2. Junior Jessica Nguyen leads the team with a 13-6 sin
gles record this year. Today's match is the first of four
straight road matches for the Cardinal women.

It wouldn't he your typical Stanford-Cal
match up without the rain.
With heavy thunderstorms moving into the
Bay Area, it appears as though everything is in
place for the 66th match-up between the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis team and its archrival.
No. 9 California.
Last April. Stanford prevailed in a 4-3 deci
sion over Cal to take the Pac-10 title despite
multiple rain delays and a change of venue.
As history has shown, playing at Cal is always
a difficult task, according to head coach Lele
Forood.
"It can be a little tough with the rain. wind,
moisture and cool air," Forood said. "When
you're outside in February, you have to prepare
for anything. Most of us are veterans so we know
to layer up with clothing and prepare for all
kinds of weather conditions."
From the all-time records, there doesn't ap
pear to be any rivalry with Cal though — Stan
ford is 58-7 overall against its Pac-10 rivals and
winners of the last 12 outings.
But if there's one thing driving the Cardinal
to victory this year, it's that Forood doesn't like
losing to Cal.
"There's definitely a rivalry between us,"
sophomore Lindsay Burdette said. "The main
source comes from Lele, who loves beating up
on Cal. It comes out in her a little bit more be
cause she likes to coach physically for this team
and for the individual players."
When asked about the rivalry, however,
Forood downplayed the match-up.
"I don't want to take it over the top or any
thing," Forood said."lt's a fun rivalry. Generally,
we've gotten along pretty well, but of course we
want to win."
The match signifies the start to Pac-10 play in
a difficult stretch of three matches in four days,
and five straight road matches which includes
trips to Washington and Los Angeles.
"It's a really tough stretch, probably the
roughest one of our schedule," Forood said. "It's
a critical part of our season no doubt about it. It's
really tough that we have to go on the road for

five straight matches of tough corn
petition.
"That's the way it is and we've
just got to do the best we can do and
hopefully come out 5-0," she added.
Stanford's road trip starts with
Cal, which is certainly no easy oppo
nent.
"Cal is a scrappy team, very tal
ented and tough," Burdette said.
"They're a mixed crowd with foreign
and American players so it's a very
interesting crew. Each person plays
very differently, so we've been
preparing for individual players a lot
this last week.
"We're gearing up for this almost
like it is [the National ream] In
doors," she said.
Stanford is currently 4-1 on the
season, its only loss coming to No. 1
Georgia Tech at last week's ITA Na
tional Team Indoors. The Cardinal is
coming off a 6-1 victory against St.

Mary's at home, the team's 98th con
secutive home win.
Cal is 3-2 on the season, suffering
shutout losses at the Indoors to
Northwestern and Miami.The Gold
en Bears are led by 2005 NCAA Sin
gles Champion Susie Babos.
The Cardinal will counter with jun
ior Jessica Nguyen who leads the
team with 13 singles victories.
Stanford's doubles teams have
been impeccable as well. They have
yet to drop the doubles point this
season, highlighted by the team of
Nguyen and senior Whitney Deason
who are 9-0 overall and 5-0 in dual
match play.
So it may be just another Stan
ford-Cal matchup, but the implica
tions are so much more for the Car
dinal's long season.
"Basically we look forward to
playing a good Cal team tomorrow,"
Forood said. "It'll be a challenge no
matter what and they're obviously a
talented team so we hope for the
best tomorrow."
