GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford picked up an easy victory
over Saint Mary's last week, 6-1. The Cardinal won all
three doubles matches and won five singles matches in
straight sets. Stanford stands at 4-1, while N0.9 Cal is 3-
2. Junior Jessica Nguyen leads the team with a 13-6 sin
gles record this year. Today's match is the first of four
straight road matches for the Cardinal women.

It wouldn't he your typical Stanford-Cal
match up without the rain.
With heavy thunderstorms moving into the
Bay Area, it appears as though everything is in
place for the 66th match-up between the No. 2
Stanford women's tennis team and its archrival.
No. 9 California.
Last April. Stanford prevailed in a 4-3 deci
sion over Cal to take the Pac-10 title despite
multiple rain delays and a change of venue.
As history has shown, playing at Cal is always
a difficult task, according to head coach Lele
Forood.
"It can be a little tough with the rain. wind,
moisture and cool air," Forood said. "When
you're outside in February, you have to prepare
for anything. Most of us are veterans so we know
to layer up with clothing and prepare for all
kinds of weather conditions."
From the all-time records, there doesn't ap
pear to be any rivalry with Cal though â€” Stan
ford is 58-7 overall against its Pac-10 rivals and
winners of the last 12 outings.
But if there's one thing driving the Cardinal
to victory this year, it's that Forood doesn't like
losing to Cal.
"There's definitely a rivalry between us,"
sophomore Lindsay Burdette said. "The main
source comes from Lele, who loves beating up
on Cal. It comes out in her a little bit more be
cause she likes to coach physically for this team
and for the individual players."
When asked about the rivalry, however,
Forood downplayed the match-up.
"I don't want to take it over the top or any
thing," Forood said."lt's a fun rivalry. Generally,
we've gotten along pretty well, but of course we
want to win."
The match signifies the start to Pac-10 play in
a difficult stretch of three matches in four days,
and five straight road matches which includes
trips to Washington and Los Angeles.
"It's a really tough stretch, probably the
roughest one of our schedule," Forood said. "It's
a critical part of our season no doubt about it. It's
really tough that we have to go on the road for
