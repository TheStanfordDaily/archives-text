### JACOB JOHNSON 
Red and white dominated Burn
ham Pavilion last Saturday as Stan
ford men's gymnastics took on Ne
braska. In its first home dual meet of
the season, the No. 2 Cardinal easily
dispatched the Cornhuskers,3s7.6oo
-
Stanford's score was the team's
second highest point total of the sea
son.lTiey even did it without their top
two competitors, U.S. National Team
members redshirt junior Sho
Nakamori and senior Dave Sender.
"Considering Nakamori and
Sender were out. I think the depth
and character of this team really
showed," said head coach Thorn
Glielnii. "They competed well and
stayed focused throughout."
Senior Chris Harper echoed his
coach's comments.
"1 think this weekend showed that
we really have depth, it showed that
we don't just rely on Dave and Sho to
get us through meets."
Although Nebraska lacks the tal
ent to challenge the Stanford gym
nasts, the meet did serve as a warning
to the rest of the NCAA: The Cardi
nal is loaded with talent and nothing
less than a national championship
will do.
The Cardinal men began competi
tion on floor exercise, where redshirt
sophomore Greg Ter-Zakhariants
topped all scores with an outstanding
routine. 1 lis score of 15.750 was a sea
son best.
Freshman Josh Dixon followed up
with another great performance, but
was unable to land his tuck full-out
dismount.The rest of the lineup pro
duced solid performances on floor,
including junior Bryant Hadden
(14.850), freshman Ryan Lieberman
(15.000), redshirt senior co-captain
Dylan Carney (15.000) and senior
Eli Alcaraz (14.9(H)). Stanford swept
the event, as Nebraska was only able
to muster a high score of 14.800.
Pommel horse was next, and
Stanford once again dominated.
Hadden placed second with a rou
tine that Clielmi described as
"smooth" and "unhurried." His
score of 15.(MM) was surpassed only
by Harper, who scored a 15.150.
"I'm at the point of the season

where I'm settling into my rhythm,"
said Harper. "I think that's true of
everybody; 1 think everybody is
starting to get more comfortable
with their sets heading into the mid
dle of our season."
It certainly seemed that way on
Saturday. Sophomore Eric Hergen
rader led off for the Cardinal on
pommel horse with a good set. and
the team continued to build momen
tum as they moved on to still rings.
Despite a relatively low start
value to his routine, freshman Alex
Buscaglia executed a solid routine
and stuck his landing to earn a final
score of 14.250. It was the first time
he scored higher than a 14 on the
season. Fellow freshman Tim Gen
try had a good set as well. Hadden
tied for first in the event with a score
of 14.900.
Alcaraz, after a disappointing
performance at the Winter Cup just

one week earlier, nailed his vault to
give the Cardinal some much-need
ed energy going into the last two ro
tations. I ie scored a meet and season
best of 15.800.
On parallel bars. Harper got the
ball rolling with a solid routine. Due
to early season shoulder problems, it
was his first parallel bars competi
tion this season. Even though he re
ceived a three tenths deduction for
an extra swing in the middle of his
set, he was happy with the result.
"[Tonight] was my best horse
routine of the year." he said. "I had a
few issues on [parallel bars] but 1 got
through it and finished pretty
strong."
Hadden had the highest score on
parallel bars with a score of 15.200.
while Dixon, Lieberman and red
shirt freshman Nick Noone all hit
their sets. High bar was also a
strong event for the Card. Josh

Dixon's routine was the highlight of
the event, and his score of 15.000
was the highest of his collegiate ca
reer.
Without a doubt, the MVP of the
meet was Hadden. With Nakamori
and Sender absent, the junior was
asked to compete in five of six
events. He responded by placing
first in parallel bars and still rings,
and coming in second on pommel
horse and high bar.
The Stanford men compete again
this Saturday at the Pacific Coast
Classic in Oakland. Some of the top
collegiate programs from around
the country will be competing, in
cluding Cal, Illinois, and 2007
NCAA runner-up Oklahoma. The
meet begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Oak
land Convention Center.
