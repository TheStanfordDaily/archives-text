## Email scam targets Stanford accounts ITS has blocked addresses behind attack 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is something phishy going
around campus.
Fraudulent emails that circulat
ed last week addressing the
"STANFORD Email Account
Owner" proceeded to explain that
the "Stanford Team" was upgrad
ing its "email account center." In
block letters, the message asked
students to confirm their email
identities by responding with user
name, password, date of birth and
country.

ITie sender's address is "admin
helpdesk@stanford.edu." but the
reply-to email ends in "googlemail.
com." Another variant of the reccnt
phishing scam was from "stan
fordupgrade@live.com."
Three Stanford accounts have
already been compromised by the
scam.
The Information Security Office
(ISO) sent an email last week to
members of the University com
munity after students reported
receiving fraudulent emails.
"These messages are used to
trick the unwary into giving their
account credentials to an anony
mous attacker, who then takes over
the account and uses it to launch
other attacks," the ISO wrote.
In an effort to combat the scam,
Information Technology Services
(ITS) blocked the incoming mes
sages on Saturday, and has also
blocked the scammers' addresses at
the central servers. However, ITS
warned that the email addresses can
change frequently, so the solution is
not permanent.
Kimball Resident Computer
Consultant (RCC) Mike Rodgers
08 said that scammers are not gen
erally looking to gain access to
Stanford accounts. They will often
try to hack into a student's bank
account, assuming that the username
and password are the same as those
in the student's school account.

"The Stanford [phishing email] is

not well done" Rodgers said. "I

think what makes it com-

pelling is not
that it's well-

worded, but that
it comes from

Stanford."

"If you look at
the email, you'll

see something," he added. ,

"They throw in the LAURA CHANG/
term 'Stanford,' but The Stanford Daily
it doesn't actually
end in stanford.edu."
Some scams are not so hard to
distinguish from legitimate
emails.
A recent phishing scam from
Pay Pal was "very cleanly word
ed," according to Rodgers. By
looking carefully at the URL,
Rodgers determined that it was
not legitimate.The URL and Web
site may contain a domain name

— like Pay Pal or Bank of
» America — hut might
have an extra string of let-

ters and numbers on the
end.

Not all students use Bank of
America or Citibank, so the
chances of students buying into

those scams are fairly unlikely.
The Stanford phishing email was
of greater concern, however.

"Everyone has a Stanford
account," Rodgers said.
A genuine email from
Stanford administrative services
would not ask a student to verify
information in an email. It is only
by logging into WebAuth,
Stanford's Web Authentication
service, that students can ensure
that their identity will remain
secure.
