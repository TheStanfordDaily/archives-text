# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Cardinal loses a close one No. 7 Stanford can't find enough against Beavers 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's gym
nastics team suffered another heart
breaking defeat this weekend in Cor
vallis. Ore. to the No. 11 Oregon State
Beavers, falling 196.700-196.375. Seat
tle Pacific University also competed at
the meet, but the Cardinal easily tri
umphed over the Falcons.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal saw
the return of Liz Tricase, Tabitha Yim
and ('arly Janiga to the lineup.
"There were several highlights on
Friday," said junior captain Nicole
Ourada. "I laving Carly back into the
lineup on three events as well as hav
ing I iz hack in the vault lineup.
" Ihey are huge 'wow' factors and
they also help give the team confi
dence because we know they are
going to hit." she added.
The Cardinal opened on vault with
stellar performances by seniors Yim
and Incase. Tricase had a big score
with a 9.925. Tricase's mid-season ar
rival has added depth to an already
solid vault line-up that also includes
Yim and sophomore Blair Ryland.
Yim earned the team's second highest
score, a 9. t XX). Ryland also returned to
the vault lineup this weekend, show
ing her consistency by posting a 9.825.
Tricase was excited about her re
turn to vault, but even more so, just
getting to compete with her team
mates.
"It's so awesome that 1 can't even
describe it." she said. "I live and

breathe to compete for Stanford gym
nastics. and I get to do it with the best
teammates anyone could ever wish
for."
Stanford then moved on to the bars
where Yim and Tricase tied for the
team's leading score with a 9.875.
Sophomore Janiga, senior Alex
Pintchouk and Ourada all earned a
9.825 to give Stanford a solid edge
over the Beavers heading into the
beam.
After posting good scores on vault
and bars. Stanford's beam routines
suffered from small mistakes and a
couple of falls. A big plus, however,
was the addition of junior All-Ameri
can Kelly Fee back to the beam lineup.
Fee returned to earn a 9.825. the
team's highest beam score of the meet.
Janiga also competed well on beam,
earning a score of 9.800.
"It was great to compete beam
again and 1 am much more confident
having hit my routine." Fee said."l was
pleased with my performance last
weekend hut 1 have a lot to improve
on. I 'm always working toward a 10.0,
so I'm training with perfection in
mind."
After being shaken a hit by the
beam routine, the Card was still a little
bit off as it moved on to its final rota
tion on floor. Janiga made her return,
tying with Pintchouk for a score of
9.800. Yim led the team with a score of
9.875, and senior Lauren Elmore also
had a great routine, earning a 9.850.
"Our beam team is normally very
solid, and they had a rough day at Ore
gon State,"Tricase said. "The fact that
we were able to bounce back after that
and have good floor and vault rota
tions showed that we are a tough team
overall."Tricase said.
Although the Card is reeling from
a bitter three-tenths of a point loss,
they actually rose in the national rank
ings and are heading into this week
with a new mentality.
"We need to start focusing on the
smaller parts of our gymnastics and
then the bigger results will happen,"
Ourada said. "For example, our goal
for this weekend is for each girl in the
lineup to try to save .05 in their rou
tine.
"Obviously those half tenths will
add up and help increase our team
score."
That is exactly what the Stanford
women hope to do this weekend in
their last home meet of the season
against rival California.
"I can't wait to compete in front of
our fans.They always bring such great
energy," Fee said. "We've been focus
ing on the smaller details in the gym
and not getting bogged down by our
larger ambitions."
This coming weekend is special in
additional ways — the team will be
giving back to the community
through a program to raise money for
breast cancer awareness and will be
honoring alumni.
"It's so much fun to compete at
home, and this weekend is a special
meet because it's held both in honor
of our alumni as well as in support of
breast cancer awareness and the
search to find a cure," said Tricase.
"We'll be wearing pink leotards to
show our support, and we hope to
raise at least $2,400 dollars to donate
toward breast cancer research. It will
be awesome to support a great cause
and beat Cal at the same time."
Stanford takes on the Golden
Bears this Sunday at 2 p.m. in Burn
ham Pavilion.
