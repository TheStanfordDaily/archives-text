## Mavericks finally land Kidd 
### SCHUYLER DIXON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DAI,I.AS (AP) — Jason Kidd is a member of the
Dallas Mavericks. Again. Finally.
The long-discussed, once-scuttled and ultimately re
configured deal to bring Kidd from New Jersey back to
the team that drafted him was finalized Tuesday. He was
reintroduced in Dallas 14 years after the Mavericks
made him the No. 2 pick.
Back then. Kidd was supposed to help turn around
one of the worst franchises in sports. Now, as one of the
league's best point guards, he's seen as a crucial piece in
the Mavs' pursuit of a championship.
"There's no bigger reward than to have that champi
onship trophy in your hand," said Kidd. who lost in the
NBA finals twice with the Nets. "That's why I'm here.
Because Dallas has its eye on that prize."
The eight-player deal, in the making since before the
All-Star break and talked about a lot longer than that,
sends Kidd. forward Malik Allen and guard Antoine
Wright to Dallas.
The primary piece headed to New Jersey is point
guard Devin Harris. The others are center DeSagana
Diop, swingman Maurice Ager, forward Trenton Has
sell and retired forward Keith Van Horn. New Jersey
also gets two first-round draft picks and $3 million.
Van I lorn and I lassell replace Jerry Stackhouse and
Devean George in an original trade proposal. Stack
house's presence in the deal was muddled by plans to
get him back to Dallas — within the rules, although in a
way the league frowned upon — and George used his
veto power to block his involvement.
"It's been the most amazing, interesting trade we've
ever done, and we've done some doozies here," Maver
icks owner Mark Cuban said. "I've never seen anything
like it. but all's well that ends well. We got the right
guys."
Kidd wasn't the answer in Dallas a decade ago. and
he was shipped to Phoenix after 2 1/2 seasons. Five
years later he was traded to the Nets, who went to back
to-back NBA finals in 2(X)2-03.
New Jersey hasn't made a long playoff run since, and
Kidd started talking trade a year ago, when he almost
went to the Los Angeles Lakers. He went public with
his latest trade demand last month.
"He's a once-in-a-lifetime type of guy to play with
and coach," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "He's had

an unbelievable impact on everyone in this organiza
tion and we wish him nothing but the best."
Cuban, who was a Mavericks season ticket holder
the last time Kidd was in Dallas, is essentially gambling
that the 1 1/2 seasons he'll have Kidd is worth more
than the 4 1/2 seasons left with Harris running the of
fense.
Kidd. of course, is a proven commodity, hut he turns
35 next month and is a decade older than I larris.
"In any business there's lulls," Cuban said. "Every
body was waiting for the postseason to start. You can't
just say,'OK, turn it on in the postseason.' I think Jason
... being that iconic All-Star will spark a lot of people."
Nets president Rod Thorn saw the same problem on
New Jersey's end. He said as the Nets struggled this sea
son, Kidd lost some of the intensity that defines him as
a player, making the trade imperative.
Thorn said he first noticed it in December, an indi
rect reference to an incident in which Kidd sat out a
game against the New York Knicks with a migraine, a
move some considered a one-day walkout to force a
trade.
"Over the course of time it became very evident that
his heart wasn't in it,"Thorn said. "The kind of player he
is. if his heart's not in it then he's not the same player,
and it became evident to me that his heart wasn't in it
anymore. It just wasn't going to work."
This is the third big trade involving a Western Con
ference power as the teams prepare for the stretch run.
Before the All-Star break, Shaquille O'Neal was dealt
from Miami to Phoenix and Pau Gasol went from
Memphis to the Los Angeles Lakers.
"We understand the competition is fierce, but we're
not afraid of the competition," Mavericks coach Avery
Johnson said.
"We feel (Kidd's) skill set can help us finish stronger,
finish games better," Johnson said. "Obviously he's not
the guy we're going to lean on for points, points, points,
points. He's going to help us because at the end of
games, he just knows how to win."
Losing Diop hurts Dallas' front line, as he is the pri
mary backup to starting center Erick Dampier. I lowev
er, Diop — who is a free agent after this season — had
fallen out of favor lately.
Allen was averaging 5.4 points in almost 16 minutes
per game for the Nets.
• Dallas also announced it waived forward Nick
Fazekas, the 34th pick last year.
