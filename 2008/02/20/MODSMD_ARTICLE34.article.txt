## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA 
The Stanford men's and women's track and
field team set several personal bests after a
string of great performances this past weekend.
At the Tyson Invitational in Fayetteville. Ark.,
Stanford represented well against a deep field
of competition, while the Cardinal also im
pressed many at the Huskv Classic in Seattle,
Wash.
In Arkansas, freshman Arantxa King led the
Cardinal women with a spectacular perform
ance. King achieved her best collegiate mark in
the long jump, with a distance of 20-10 3/4.
King's performance was enough to secure third
place in the meet and a tie for fourth place na
tionally in the long jump. In addition to her stel
lar performance in the long jump. King also
made the NCAA provisional mark in the triple
jump, with her jump of 42 feet even, placing her
11th in the event.
"For me, the place I get is irrelevant to how
well I perform," King said. "I don't mind losing
to great jumpers as long as I do my personal
best."
But her successes do not come without fail
ures, as she did foul on a great jump. However,
King was able to come back and finish the event
with a high mark. King will definitely be one to
watch in the upcoming meets, as the freshman
continues to astound the collegiate track and
field community with her athleticism. She hopes
to be over 21 feet in the long jump by the end of
the season.
In other action, freshman Shataya Hendricks
also achieved a collegiate best time of 7.55 sec
onds in the 60 meter dash. Hendricks also ran a
collegiate best time of 24.48 seconds in the 200
meters. In the 60 meter hurdles, freshman Whit
ney Liehr ran a collegiate best time with 8.72
seconds, while teammate junior Lauren Stewart
saw a season best time with 8.80 seconds.
Hie Cardinal men accomplished some sea
son bests in the 4(X) meter dash, with sophomore
Durell Coleman running a time of 49.36, and
freshman Andrew Dargie leading Stanford with
a time of 47.49 seconds. In the men's 200 meter
dash, a Cardinal trio of sprinters ran their sea
sonal bests. Dargie led the pack with a time of
21.87 seconds, and was followed by Coleman
(22.52 seconds) and junior Mvles Bradley
(22.60).
"[The] competition was incredibly deep in
every event," Bradley said. "It was like pre-na
tionals because so many top schools showed
up-
Senior Graeme Hoste captured an NCAA
automatic qualifying standard in the men's pole
vault, with a height of 18-0 l/2.The vault was also
a personal best for Hoste, improving upon a
mark that was already second all-time for Stan

ford indoors. Hoste's performance put him in
third place in the event.
The rest of the Cardinal made their mark at
the Husky Classic in Seattle. Stanford runners
particularly excelled in the mile, as redshirt jun
ior Garrett Heath ran the third fastest mile time
Stanford has ever seen indoors. Heath secured a
second place finish in the event, with a time of
3:58.71, which was also an automatic NCAA
qualifying time.
The race was incredibly close, as Heath fin
ished behind the first place winner and team
mate redshirt senior Russell Brown. Brown
does not have eligibility for indoors and was
competing unattached, however. He edged
Heath by a mere 17 hundredths of a second.
Redshirt junior Hakon DeVries also ran well
in the mile,achieving a national provisional time
of 4:03.91, also a personal best for him. Senior
Jacob Evans and sophomore Justin Marpole-
Bird also ran personal best times in the mile,
