## White Plaza Tree stunt takes a bloody turn Candidate uses light bulbs to show dedication 
### STEPHANIE WERNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Cackler '09 performed his
second stunt in the campaign for
Treedom yesterday afternoon in
White Plaza. ITie stunt involved
nine friends, lined up on either side
of a tarp, who struck Cackler with
elongated fluorescent light bulbs as
he ran between them.
"The nine light bulbs were for
all of the Pac-10 teams, except for
Stanford," said Donny Vaughn 08,
a friend of Cackler's who assisted
with yesterday's stunt. The point of
having nine light bulbs was that
"it's not about the score â€” it's
about how you stand up to it."
