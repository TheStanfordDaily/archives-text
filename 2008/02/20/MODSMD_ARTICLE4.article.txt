### STEPHANIE WERNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Cackler '09 performed his
second stunt in the campaign for
Treedom yesterday afternoon in
White Plaza. ITie stunt involved
nine friends, lined up on either side
of a tarp, who struck Cackler with
elongated fluorescent light bulbs as
he ran between them.
"The nine light bulbs were for
all of the Pac-10 teams, except for
Stanford," said Donny Vaughn 08,
a friend of Cackler's who assisted
with yesterday's stunt. The point of
having nine light bulbs was that
"it's not about the score — it's
about how you stand up to it."

from the second floor of Braun Music Hall and quick
ly rushed out to watch.
"It was kind of like everyone was watching it like a
train wreck about to happen," she said. "It was pretty
ridiculous. I think my jaw was wide open. When I saw
him about to do it, I didn't really think of the magni
tude until he started getting hit with the fluorescent
bulbs and bleeding profusely. It was very impressive."
Taylor Thibodeaux '11, a Dolly-elect, thought the
event was "a little bit terrifying because he was really
bloody at the end," she said. "It was a little extreme,
but I guess that shows he's really dedicated. He drew
an 'S' in the blood on his stomach."
Cackler was indeed very bloody. A few hours after
the event, though, he said he felt "good — real good.
It stings a little, but I'm still alive, so I'm pretty excit
ed."
Hie inspiration for Cackler's stunt came from
swordfighting with one of his friends.
"I tested it out yesterday to see how bad it would
be and I didn't die, so I figured I would go through
with it today," Cackler said,
John Whipple'lo, the current Tree, remarked that he'd
"like to encourage not only gutsy, painful things, but
also creative things. [But] I just want to see more,
more of what they have."
According to Vaughn, this won't be a problem for
Cackler.
"1 don't know if he's going to be able to pull off all
the things, but some of his ideas are really creative," he
said. "He just has some talents that, if he can pull it off,
it'll just go straight into the books."
Cackler himself is "just getting really excited about
this. I think I'm starting off on a good note and look
ing forward to an exciting week."
Though no other stunts were performed today by
potential Trees, Forrest White '10 declared his candi
dacy.
