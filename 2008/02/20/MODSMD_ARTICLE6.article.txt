## Gates relays philanthropic commitment Microsoft chairman jokes with crowd about upcoming departure from company 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Microsoft chairman and ex-CEO Bill Gates cajoled a
packed Memorial Auditorium yesterday afternoon by playing
heavily to the home crowd.
Gates pointed out that current CEO Steve Ballmer
M.B.A. '81 attended Stanford, although Gates persuaded his
"fellow drop-out" to leave the Stanford MBA program and
join Microsoft. Gates also mentioned notable Stanford alum
ni such as Microsoft research head Rick Rashid '74 and
Windows Live executive Chris Jones '91, concluding that "we
[Microsoft] owe a lot [to] the school."
Gates' purpose in speaking to yesterday's mostly student
crowd, however, was neither to focus on past achievements
nor the innerworkings of the corporation he started over 30
years ago. Gates plans to move away from full-time work at
Microsoft at the end of June, using the bulk of his time toward
philanthropic endeavors instead. Making light of his upcom
ing departure. Gates played a comical "home video" — which
featured Bono, director Steven Spielberg. Senators Hillary
Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-lll.) and other
celebrities — to spoof his last day at Microsoft.
Ilic 52-year-old Gates noted that he has been working on
Microsoft every day since he was 17 years old. He described
leaving the day-to-day work of the corporation as possibly
"traumatic," but said he was looking forward to the change —
and to the new time he'll have for the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, which he and his wife co-chair.
In introducing Gates. Stanford President John Hennessy
pointed out similarities between the University and the ex-
CEO. Hennessy said that they both were "dedicated to serv
ing public good" and share the common entrepreneurial
drive.
Gates' lecture, "On Software, Innovation,
Entrepreneurship, and Giving Back," was open solely to
Stanford students, faculty and staff. Ilic event primarily
focused on the future of technology, as well as how that tech
nology has the potential to affect change in developing coun
tries.
"This is the start of the second digital decade," Gates said.
"(The changes we will see will be] far more dramatic than in
the first digital decade."
In outlining the growth in capabilities of the personal com
puter (PC), the entrepreneur noted how the Internet has
helped to make the world a smaller place. In the future. Gates
said that he hopes the movement of data between devices
such as laptops and cellphones — will
become much more seamless. 'Hiese
changes, he explained, will have signif
icant implications for every industry,
including education.
Furthermore, Gates argued that the
current learning systems could be
enhanced greatly if universities better
utilize technology, allowing more
materials and lectures to be available
to the public. ,
"How many' universities should
have to give lectures on subjects like
physics?" Gates asked. "The answer is
'very few."'
Explaining that he will remain
involved in Microsoft's work with
"natural user interfaces" — examples
of which include the Nintendo Wii
control, the iPhone's touchscreen and
Microsoft Gestures — Gates said he is
committed to the structure of knowl
edge, "and [will] really take on the big
frontiers of software."
Over the past few days, it was spec
ulated on tech blogs and in business
news that the ostensible purpose of
Gates' Stanford visit was to talk about
Microsoft's new program, which will
provide free developer tools to stu
dents. However, Gates did not discuss
the program in detail.
Dubbed "Dream Spark." the pro
gram makes available, at no charge, a
broad range of development and
design software for download.
According to a Microsoft press
release, the program is available to

more than 35 million college students
in Belgium, China, Finland, France,
Germany, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, the U.K. and the US.
Further expansions could mean that
up to 1 billion students worldwide will
have access to the development tools.
Gates said he hoped the release of
the software will help make "huge
breakthroughs" in technological
research using the Microsoft plat
form.
He added that software is particu
larly important in sciences such as
biology and astronomy, which require
a deep analysis across large amounts
of data. Gates noted that the compa
ny dedicates a significant amount of
its resources to research.
"Microsoft is spending a bit over
$6 billion a year on research and
development, spread across the
globe," he said.
Despite this spread by Microsoft
itself. Gates said that that the relative
benefits of research in general have
been available overwhelmingly to the
people who need it the least. He
referred to the fact that the ratio of
money spent on baldness to that
spent on malaria is about 50-to-l in
favor of baldness.
"Of 12 million children who die
every year, less than one percent are
in the rich countries," Gates said.'But
over 90 percent of medical research is
spent on diseases in rich countries."
In a 15-minute question and

answer period after Gates' tulk, most
audience members focused on the
Gates Foundation, touching on topics
such as microfinancing, immigration
and the impact of social justice.
One student asked Gates about
the risks of regulation on the Internet.
"1 don't see any risk in the world at
large that someone will restrict free
content flow on the Internet," he
responded.
Gates added that the Internet is
not a place where nuclear bomb
designs should be exchanged at will,
but emphasized that it should be open
enough to find and exchange most
information.
He also reminded students that
there is an increasing desire of people
to have impact measured beyond
core market incentives. Gates pointed
out that the poorest populations,
which do not have electricity or liter
acy, will simply not own a PC. even if
it costs them 10 cents.
Gates further stated that students
should not graduate from top institu
tions without some experience of the
average human condition — one
beyond the experience they have liv
ing in one of the richest countries in
the world.
"Right now is a wonderful time to
be a student," Gates said,"to learn and
gather these skills."

"traumatic," but said he was looking forward to the change —
and to the new time he'll have for the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, which he and his wife co-chair.
In introducing Gates. Stanford President John Hennessy
pointed out similarities between the University and the ex-
CEO. Hennessy said that they both were "dedicated to serv
ing public good" and share the common entrepreneurial
drive.
Gates' lecture, "On Software, Innovation,
Entrepreneurship, and Giving Back," was open solely to
Stanford students, faculty and staff. Ilic event primarily
focused on the future of technology, as well as how that tech
nology has the potential to affect change in developing coun
tries.
"This is the start of the second digital decade," Gates said.
"(The changes we will see will be] far more dramatic than in
the first digital decade."
In outlining the growth in capabilities of the personal com
puter (PC), the entrepreneur noted how the Internet has
helped to make the world a smaller place. In the future. Gates
said that he hopes the movement of data between devices
such as laptops and cellphones — will
become much more seamless. 'Hiese
changes, he explained, will have signif
icant implications for every industry,
including education.
Furthermore, Gates argued that the
current learning systems could be
enhanced greatly if universities better
utilize technology, allowing more
materials and lectures to be available
to the public. ,
"How many' universities should
have to give lectures on subjects like
physics?" Gates asked. "The answer is
'very few."'
Explaining that he will remain
involved in Microsoft's work with
"natural user interfaces" — examples
of which include the Nintendo Wii
control, the iPhone's touchscreen and
Microsoft Gestures — Gates said he is
committed to the structure of knowl
edge, "and [will] really take on the big
frontiers of software."
Over the past few days, it was spec
ulated on tech blogs and in business
news that the ostensible purpose of
Gates' Stanford visit was to talk about
Microsoft's new program, which will
provide free developer tools to stu
dents. However, Gates did not discuss
the program in detail.
Dubbed "Dream Spark." the pro
gram makes available, at no charge, a
broad range of development and
design software for download.
According to a Microsoft press
release, the program is available to

more than 35 million college students
in Belgium, China, Finland, France,
Germany, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, the U.K. and the US.
Further expansions could mean that
up to 1 billion students worldwide will
have access to the development tools.
Gates said he hoped the release of
the software will help make "huge
breakthroughs" in technological
research using the Microsoft plat
form.
He added that software is particu
larly important in sciences such as
biology and astronomy, which require
a deep analysis across large amounts
of data. Gates noted that the compa
ny dedicates a significant amount of
its resources to research.
"Microsoft is spending a bit over
$6 billion a year on research and
development, spread across the
globe," he said.
Despite this spread by Microsoft
itself. Gates said that that the relative
benefits of research in general have
been available overwhelmingly to the
people who need it the least. He
referred to the fact that the ratio of
money spent on baldness to that
spent on malaria is about 50-to-l in
favor of baldness.
"Of 12 million children who die
every year, less than one percent are
in the rich countries," Gates said.'But
over 90 percent of medical research is
spent on diseases in rich countries."
In a 15-minute question and

answer period after Gates' tulk, most
audience members focused on the
Gates Foundation, touching on topics
such as microfinancing, immigration
and the impact of social justice.
One student asked Gates about
the risks of regulation on the Internet.
"1 don't see any risk in the world at
large that someone will restrict free
content flow on the Internet," he
responded.
Gates added that the Internet is
not a place where nuclear bomb
designs should be exchanged at will,
but emphasized that it should be open
enough to find and exchange most
information.
He also reminded students that
there is an increasing desire of people
to have impact measured beyond
core market incentives. Gates pointed
out that the poorest populations,
which do not have electricity or liter
acy, will simply not own a PC. even if
it costs them 10 cents.
Gates further stated that students
should not graduate from top institu
tions without some experience of the
average human condition — one
beyond the experience they have liv
ing in one of the richest countries in
the world.
"Right now is a wonderful time to
be a student," Gates said,"to learn and
gather these skills."
