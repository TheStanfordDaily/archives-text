## Going once, going twice. Auction Facebook app makes a bid for popularity 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
M et another student from
M Computer Science 377W:
"Create Engaging Web Ap
jF plications Using Metrics
and Learning on Facebook"
has created a promising
Facebook application.This one, though, is
a little different.
Josh Liptzin '08, along with an alum
nus from Massachusetts Institute ofTech
nology (MI T), has designed Hotßid, an
auction-based application. The program
is remarkably similar to eßay, but for one
significant difference — it is completely
free to list an item on Hotßid.
Liptzin said that he hopes his applica
tion will become the alternative to eßay.
By eliminating unnecessary and compli
cated features, Hotßid aims to provide a
fun and free environment to connect buy
ers with sellers.
"1 created this application because I
wanted to put the fun back into online auc
tions," he said. "I remember using eßay
nine years ago when it used to be a cool site
— fees were low and you could quickly
and easily list stuff for sale and transact
with real people and not companies."
Liptzin explained how Hotßid is un
like its other competitor, the Facebook
Marketplace.
"[Hotßid] uses the online auction

model to ensure that sellers get the best
price for their stuff," he said. "The Face
book marketplace is basically a version of
Craigslist on Facebook."
Since Hotßid is integrated into Face
book. users can easily choose to view auc
tions that are only visible to friends or
their networks;or, for maximum visibility,
they may also opt to list items across all
Facebook. In addition to having access to
data from Hotßid's feedback system, a
user will know a sellers real name, the
networks a seller belongs to and his or her
friends.
"So, for example, if you see a seller
from the Google network who graduated
from Stanford and has 400 friends, it's un
likely he's out to scam you." he said. "If
you are thinking of bidding on an item
from John Smith who has few friends and
doesn't belong to any networks, then you
would have to rely on his Hotßid feed
back history to make your decision."
Since Hotßid officially launched
seven days ago, it has garnered 4000 users
and 1000 auctions. Liptzin pointed out
that the most popular listings consist of
textbooks and jewelry, although some
people have even listed cars.
Liptzin and his friend from MIT even
took their application and officially incor
porated it into a full-fledged company last

week. They call themselves
Phase 2, Inc. because, accord
ing to Liptzin, they aim to
build the next phase of so
cial applications — appli
cations that don't annoy

people but instead provide real value to
users.
According to Liptzin, Hotßid is supe
rior to eßay in a number of ways.
On eßay today, a seller can lose money if
a listed item does not sell due to the costs
associated with putting the item up for
auction. Since there are no fees on Hot-
Bid. Liptzin anticipates that many more
items will be available, since users do not
need to worry about losing money.
eßay has recently announced new
policies, set to go into effect today, that
will reduce upfront costs such as listing
fees and make gallery photos free. At the
same time, though, new policies will in
crease the commission eßay receives
from each sale.Top sellers will be reward
ed with greater visibility and protections,
but sellers can no longer leave negative
feedback for buyers.
These policy changes have led to some
frustration among sellers, who have begun
to look for new channels to sell their prod
ucts. Consequently, alternative market
places — like Hotßid — are seeing signif-

icant jumps in new
user registrations.
According to
Liptzin, eßay is at
tempting to

squeeze as much money out of its users as
it can by continuing to hike up fees.
"It also got a lot more complicated to
use over the years and takes way too long
just to list one simple item." he added,
"unless you are a power seller who has
mastered the art of creating thousands of
new listings per day."
With the changes to eßay's policies, as
well as the restructuring of their fee sys
tem, Liptzin is optimistic for the future of
his application.
"We want to become a viable alterna
tive to eßay," Liptzin said. "If we can dis
place just one percent of its market share,
then our application will be a huge suc
cess."
