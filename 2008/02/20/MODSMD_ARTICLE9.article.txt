						FORGOTTEN TRAGEDY
## Students rally support for Mexican flood survivors 
### GEA KANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To most students, February means Presidents'
Day Weekend, Dance Marathon and, of course,
Valentine's Day.This year, what about Tabasco
Flood Relief Awareness Month?
Unfortunately, few people are even aware that a cat
astrophic flood hit the state of Tabasco, Mexico in late
October 2(K)7. The region is still struggling to recover
and rebuild.
And that's what a coalition — one consisting of indi
vidual students and groups such as Ballet Folklorico,
Bolivar House, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA), Stanford Concert Network and
Stanford Latino Law Students Association — is trying
to change.
Some have called the flood, which also damaged the
neighboring state of Chiapas. Mexico's worst disaster in
the past 100 years.
"Over a million people have been affected,and thou
sands have lost their homes," said Chris Sully J.D. '08.

"The flood affected communication and transportation,
so many people didn't know where their loved ones
were or if they had survived."
In addition, the flood has been a blow to the nation
al economy, as Tabasco houses a large portion of the oil
that contributes to the country's revenue.
"The pictures were pretty shocking," said Jacqueline
Silva Sanchez J.D.TO.'Mn the capital city, you'd literally
just see the points of houses."
During initial efforts soon after the flood, individual
students banded together and worked independently
of other groups. Within a week or so after the flood hit,
Silva Sanchez and other law students decided to collect
canned goods. Other organizations, such as MEChA,
ultimately joined the movement as it began to coa
lesce.

"Eighty percent
of the state was
underwater, roughly
equivalent to the state
of Massachusetts
r .
C a 7* *
being underwater."

In order
to build momen
tum, the self-proclaimed
coalition "of the willing"

designated February for rais
ing awareness about the cause,
and they decided to channel all
fundraising efforts into house re-

construction. ProViVah, a non
governmental organization (NGO)

in Mexico, will build a house for every
$2,000 raised; around $2300 of the target
$10,000 has been raised so far.

Past fundraisers have included an off-campus
party at Blue Chalk Cafe planned by law and business
students, and an expert panel to raise awareness. See box
at rightr for upcoming events. Also underway is a trip to
Tabasco to aid local businesses.
After all, "we're doing a month-long awareness
event, but the need is not going away at the end of Feb
ruary," Sully noted. "Helping to get these people's lives
back together is going to take a long time."
Students emphasized the importance of publicizing
the issue, which has suffered from a severe lack of expo
sure.
"The disaster was just as bad or — and in some ways
worse — than Katrina, yet it received very little cover
age outside of Mexico," Silva Sanchez said. "It was real
ly shocking because the flood happened on a Monday;
the news came out on BBC on Wednesday and in the
United States on Thursday. Eighty percent of the state
was underwater, roughly equivalent to the state of
Massachusetts being underwater. Area-wise, this was
bigger than the area affected by Katrina. And it was in
the UK before it was here."
In fact, the issue received such small coverage in the
U.S. that students like Silva Sanchez faced problems
transporting collected goods to Tabasco. At first, they
found few willing to help. One man in Sonoma Valley of
fered to drive the supplies down to Mexico in his truck.
"He was literally the only person in Northern Cali
fornia collecting at that point, and logistically it's kind of
tricky to get to Tabasco," said Silva Sanchez, who had
made numerous calls through the Mexican Consulate in
San Jose to find people who might be able to help with
the effort. Luckily,she said,Mexicana Airlines offered to
fly the materials down.
According to Liz Rivera '08 — a MEChA member
whose relatives were forced to evacuate — one of the

goals
is to get

people to think
about the larger pic
ture.

"What were the ef
fects and why didn't this disaster get more media cover
age?" she asked, "Why is it important to know how this
disaster affects us and the society we live in?"
This will not be the last time the Gulf of Mexico is
struck by tragedy.
"The U.S. and Mexican economies are so closely tied
together," Sully said. "There are over a million people
that are in dire need of help, and we're in a position to be
able to help them. And because of the similarities to
Hurricane Katrina, we think that we can learn some
thing about how to better respond to what's still going
on in New Orleans and also in the future."
If Americans are uninformed, they will "miss a huge
part of not only the problem but the solution," Sully said.
"This natural disaster in itself has nothing to do with na
tionality, race, social class, gender or politics. A natural
disaster doesn't really care what country you're in. It
may be a 'natural' disaster, but it requires a 'human' re
sponse."
Rivera acknowledged that "it's almost impossible for
people to contribute to every single effort on campus."
In the meantime, however, all of us can help out just by
taking notice. "Hopefully our efforts inspire others in
the future," she said.
