# U.S. navy missile hits wayward spy satellite
## ONBOARD TANK OF TOXIC FUEL DESTROYED 
### ROBERT BURNS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A missile launched from a
Navy cruiser soared 130 miles above the Pacific and
smashed a dying and potentially deadly U.S. spy satellite
Wednesday, the Pentagon said.Two defense officials said
it apparently achieved the main aim of destroying an on
board tank of toxic fuel.
Officials had expressed cautious optimism that the
missile would hit the satellite, which was the size of a
school bus. But they were less certain of hitting the small
er, more worrisome fuel tank, whose contents posed what
Bush administration officials deemed a potential health
hazard to humans if it landed intact.
In a statement announcing that the attack on the satel
lite. the Pentagon said. "Confirmation that the fuel tank
has been fragmented should be available within 24
hours." It made no mention of early indications, but two
defense officials close to the situation said later that it ap
peared the fuel tank was hit. One said observers saw what
appeared to be an explosion, indicating that the tank was
hit
Because the satellite was orbiting at a relatively low alti
tude at the time it was hit by the missile,debris will begin
to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere immediately,the Pen
tagon statement said.
"Nearly all of the debris will burn up on re-entry with
in 24-48 hours and the remaining debris should re-enter
within 40 days," it said.
Ihe USS Lake Erie, armed with an SM-3 missile de
signed to knock down incoming missiles — not orbiting
satellites — launched the attack at 10:26 p.m. EST. ac
cording to the Pentagon. It hit the satellite about three
minutes later as the spacecraft traveled in polar orbit at
more than 17,(XX)mph.
The Lake Erie and two other Navy warships, as well as
the SM-3 missile and other components, were modified in
a hurry-up project headed by the Navy in January. The
missile alone cost nearly $10 million, and officials estimat
ed that the total cost of the project was at least $30 million.
The launch of the Navy missile amounted to an un
precedented use of components of the Pentagon's missile
defense system, designed to shoot down hostile ballistic
missiles in flight — not kill satellites.
The operation was so extraordinary, with such intense
international publicity and political ramifications, that
Defense Secretary Robert Gates — not a military com
mander — made the decision to pull the trigger.
Gates had arrived in I lawaii a few hours before the
missile was launched. 1 le was there to begin a round-the
world trip, not to monitor the missile operation. His press
secretary. Geoff Morrell. told reporters traveling with
Gates that the defense chief gave the go-ahead at 1:40
p.m. EST while en route from Washington.
Morrell said Gates had a conference call during the
flight with Air Force Gen. Kevin Chilton, head of Strate
gic Command, and Marine Gen. James Cartwright, vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. TTiey told him that
"the conditions were ripe for an attempt, and that is
when the secretary - gave the go-ahead to take the shot,
and wished them good luck," Morrell said.
At 10:35 p.m. EST, Gates spoke to both generals again
and "was informed that the mission was a success, that the
missile had intercepted the decaying satellite, and the sec
retary was obviously very pleased to learn that," said
Morrell.
The government organized hazardous materials
teams, under the code name "Burnt Frost," to be flown to
the site of any dangerous or otherwise sensitive debiis
that might land in the United States or elsewhere.
Also, six federal response groups that are positioned
across the country by the Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency were alerted but had not been activated
Wednesday, FEM A spokesman James Mclntyre said be
fore the missile launch. "These are purely precautionary

and preparedness actions only," he said.
President Bush gave his approval last week to at
tempt the satellite shootdown on grounds that it was
worth trying to destroy the toxic fuel on board the satel
lite before it could possibly land in a populated area.
The three-stage Navy missile, designated the SM-3,
has chalked up a high rate of success in a series of tests
since 2002, in each case targeting a short- or medium
range ballistic missile, never a satellite. A hurry-up pro
gram to adapt the missile for this anti-satellite mission
was completed in a matter of weeks; Navy officials said
the changes would be reversed once this satellite was
down.
The government issued notices to aviators and
mariners to remain clear of a section of the Pacific
Ocean beginning at 10:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, indicat

ing the first window of opportunity to launch the missile.
Having lost power shortly after it reached orbit in late
2006, the satellite was out of control and well below the al
titude of a normal satellite. The Pentagon determined it
should hit it with an SM-3 missile just before it re-entered
Earth's atmosphere, in that way minimizing the amount
of debris that would remain in space.
Left alone, the satellite would have been expected to
hit Earth during the first week of March. About half of
the 5.000-pound spacecraft would have been expected
to survive its blazing descent through the atmosphere
and would have scattered debris over several hundred
miles.
