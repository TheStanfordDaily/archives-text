## Study finds subconscious racial discrimination African Americans linked with apes by some 
### ROBERT TOEWS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite significant strides made
against racial discrimination in the
post-Civil Rights era, a new psychol
ogy study reveals that many
Americans — including participants
at Stanford — subconsciously associ
ate African Americans with apes.
Ibis association also makes indi
viduals more likely to condone vio
lence against black criminal suspects,
which researchers attribute to soci
ety's broader inability to see African
Americans as fully human.
The research consisted of six
related studies taking place over six
years at both Stanford and
Pennsylvania State University, and it
involved mostly white male under
graduate participants.
"The context that we're in here [at
Stanford) is pretty good," said
Psychology Associate Prof. Jennifer
Eberhardt, co-author of the study,
who is herself African American.
"But as we see, being in this context
did not protect the participants from
this association."
The researchers' paper, entitled
"Not Yet Human: Implicit
Knowledge, Historical
Dehumanization and Contemporary
Consequences," was published earli
er this month in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
"This study seems to suggest that,
despite the progress that we've made,
despite the passage of anti-discrimi
nation laws in this nation, deep-root
ed racial bias remains with us,"
Eberhardt said. "African Americans
continue to be dehumanized."
In one study, individuals sublimi
nal ly exposed to photographs of
black male faces were much more
likely to identify blurry ape drawings
than those who had been primed with
white faces. This "ape-black connec
tion" was present even when partici
pants said they had no prior knowl
edge of the historically discriminatory
characterizations of African
Americans as apes, according to the
study.
Researchers found no connection
associating African Americans with

other dark-skinned animals, which
Eberhardt said indicates that the sub
conscious link in people's minds goes
beyond similarities in skin color. No
connection was found between apes
and members of other non-white
groups, such as Asian Americans.
In another study, participants
were shown a two-minute video clip
depicting several police officers vio
lently beating a man of an undeter
mined race. A mugshot of either a
black man or a white man was shown
at the beginning of the clip to indi
cate who was being beaten.
If the suspect was identified as
black, participants were more likely
to support the policemen's use of vio
lence when they had been primed
beforehand with ape-related words
— such as "monkey" or "gorilla" —
than when no priming had occurred.
If the suspect was identified as white,
the priming made no difference,
Eberhardt said.
But participants were just as like
ly to condone violence against black
suspects as they were against whites
when no priming had occurred.
Eberhardt said these findings suggest
that the dehumanizing racial bias
against African Americans remains
latent until it is triggered by ape asso
ciation.
Historical representations of
African Americans as subhuman or
apelike were once prevalent in
American culture, but these charac
terizations have largely disappeared,
according to the study.
But Eberhardt said some vestiges
remain, citing the fact that standard
illustrations depicting evolution tend
to represent the most advanced stage
of development as a white man.
The research study also suggests
the media may play a role in subtly
perpetuating this discriminatory
association. A review of hundreds of
news stories that appeared between
1979 and 1999 in the Philadelphia
Inquirer indicated that blacks con
victed of capital crimes were roughly
four times more likely than whites
convicted of the same crimes to be
described with apelike adjectives
such as "brute," "beast" and "savage."
Those who were implicitly depicted
as "apelike" in the articles were more
likelv to be executed bv the state.
