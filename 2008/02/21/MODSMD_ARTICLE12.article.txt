## GSC approves special fees ballot requests 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
'I he Graduate Student Couneil (CISC)
voted hist night on a number of student
groups hoping to appear on the ASSU
Special Fees ballot in the spring elections.
Placement on this ballot — which
requires a three-fifths majority vote of GSC
members present at the meeting — allows
the student body to vote against or in favor
of allocating the recommended amount of
money to the student groups from Special
l ees funds.
Funding recommendations were made by
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Appropriations Committee. For groups that
are requesting funds from both the under
graduate and graduate populations, the rec
ommendations were made by a joint commit
tee consisting of GSC and ASSU members.
Seven groups were under consideration
at last night's meeting: the ASSU Legal
Council, the Comedy Club, K.ZSU Radio
Station. Pacific Free Clinic, the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau. Club Sports and Stanford
Outdoors. All were approved for the ballot
with three-fifths majority roll-call votes by
GSC members.
Although all student groups passed by
majority votes last night, there was a lone
student at the meeting that either abstained
from or opposed to voting in favor of all stu
dent groups. Second-year business school
student Rhyan Uy, a member of the GSC,
claimed he would not vote in favor because
the revised student groups "are not even
known" by his constituents.
"If they [student groups] want to get a
vote to be on next spring's Special Fees bal
lot." Uy said, "then they should make sure
that graduate students know about them."
Following long deliberations between
GSC members, the meeting concluded after
Stanford Outdoors was also voted to be an
umbrella organization for a handful of other
smaller student outdoor groups.
According to Chris Elmone, financial
officer of the Climbing Wall, if Stanford
Outdoors passes on the Special Fees ballot,
the group will financially oversee the Alpine
Club, the Climbing Wall, the Kayak Club, the
Outdoor Education Program, the Outing
Club, the Redwood Outdoors Club, the
Stanford Outdoor Outreach Program
(SOOP) and the Stanford Pre-Orientation
IVips (SPOT).
