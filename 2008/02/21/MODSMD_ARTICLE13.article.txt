## Editorial Board Staffing reforms needed on the Row 
### 
Autumn quarter may seem like it is
worlds away, but eager applicants
across campus have begun the Row's
annual manager selection process. Scores of
students hoping to obtain highly-coveted
Row house staff positions are currently com
peting for jobs, some of which include
kitchen manager, house manager and social
manager, while those wishing to be a Resi
dent Assistant (RA) or an academic staff
member will begin the application process
later this quarter. As a result of hiring and
training discontinuities, including the sepa
rate application processes, each group of
Row house staff members is often divided
before the school year even begins, leading to
negative consequences for staff and resi
dents alike.
In the weeks before the new school year
begins, staff members pour onto campus for
training. However, due to conflicting sched
ules and different meal plans for various po
sitions, coordination among house staff
members proves to be a challenge. While it is
understandable that each house's staff must
split up to attend job-specific meetings — all
kitchen managers attend one workshop
while financial managers attend another —
these events do separate house team mem
bers from the start of their time spent togeth
er.The workshops are often scheduled at dif
ferent times on different days, taking away
from time that could be spent accomplishing
house-specific tasks as a group.
The division in eating plans further sepa
rates house staff members during this forma
tive training period. In the weeks leading up
to the start of school, managers' meals are
provided via per-diem cash reimbursements,
while the meals of RAs and academic staff
members are provided via the dorm system.
Thus, some staff members eat meals in
Tresidder while others head to Wilbur Din
ing, making mealtimes — which could be op
portune settings to build social capital be
tween house staff members — a wasted op
portunity to build such necessary connec

tions.
These first days set a precedent for a more
independent style of teamwork, making
event-planning and theme-choosing a toil
some chore for some groups of staff mem
bers. If teams do not have a chance to spend
time and become friends with one another,
the house staff members will suffer setbacks
working for the residents throughout the
year.
Social capital is an important aspect of
any successful team. If teammates hope to
accomplish anything worthwhile, they must
trust each other and feel a sense of commit
ment to the collective cause. Not building up
this capital during staff training can be fatal
to the implementation of events as minor as
house meetings and as significant as special
dinners.
Residents are the people who suffer the
most from a lack of staff cohesiveness. In ad
dition to coveting a good location on campus.
Row house residents often seek the intimate
atmosphere and special social circumstances
that come with living on the Row.
Unlike Row staff members, dorm staffs,
especially those of freshman dorms, tend to
be extremely close-knit. These staffs, which
have a plethora of opportunities to spend
time together, set an example of how a group
of people can work together to provide an
excellent living environment for residents.
Perhaps the Row administration could learn
from a similar form of organization and initi
ate more structured events for all house staff
members — such as providing them all with
a single meal plan during staff training.
As the Row administration proceeds into
another application cycle, it must heed these
accounts.The situation will not improve until
changes are made to the training process so
that staff members are not split apart during
this crucial social capital-building time. Cur
rent students applying for next year's Row
staff positions should also take these points
into consideration.They may just decide that
the hassle outweighs the potential gain.
