£ £ A virulent anti-smoker in Germany
/\ was so angry when his girlfriend
JL \jit up, he emptied a fire extin
guisher to put out the cigarette, caking her
and their apartment in powder," Reuters
news service reported on Tliesday. The man
later told police he didn't care about the dam
age to the apartment, and that the relation
ship with his girlfriend was over. But isn't that
stuff bad for you? Was there nothing in the
apartment worth saving from the flame retar
dant chemicals?
President George W. Bush elicits the same
sorts of violent emotions for a lot of Ameri
cans, especially Democrats — they'd love to
unleash a fire extinguisher on him, they don't
care about the residual damage and their re
lationship with him is (almost) over.
But is there anything worth saving? I'm
worried that the virulent anti-Bush groups,
and even moderates who are just tired of
him, would say everything connected with
Bush should just be tossed out.
It is no coincidence that every primary
campaign has gravitated to themes of hope
and change. That is what resonates. On both
sides of the political spectrum, people want
to get past the Bush administration and all of
its negative associations. Tear-off calendars
that count down the days until it's over have
sold like crazy.
In typical lame duck fashion. Bush has de
cided that now is a fine time to go on a good
will tour in Africa — this is what presidents
do when they're worried about their legacy,
and on that front, things don't look too good.
Conservative commentator William F. Buck
ley has said "Bush will have no legacy," and
MSNBC's left-leaning Keith Olbermann
called the administration "a presidency of
Cliffnotes."
The Bush administration has had the op
posite of the Midas touch, so the disdain is
easy to understand. From Iraq to Katrina, No
Child Left Behind to immigration reform,
most high profile issues have not gone well.
During his two terms. Bush has angered a
lot of people. It was only last year that
Google finally disabled a user generated
trick where the first search result for "miser
able failure" was the White House Web page
with Bush's official biography. Amazingly, he
once hit a record 90 percent national ap
proval rating, albeit immediately after 9/11.

More recently, though, his approval rating
has dropped to 24 percent. This was the low
est rating since Nixon, and Nixon resigned in
a scandal.
Yet even with all of the negatives, the
Bush Administration started the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC), one major
policy accomplishment that should not be
swept away with the rest of the Bush rubble
— it should also not be forgotten by a new
administration eager to start its own initia
tives. Don't worry if you've never heard of it.
I did not know much before I interned at the
corporation, located in Washington, this fall.
The MCC was created in 2004 to adminis
trate a better, smarter U.S. foreign aid, and it
operates on two premises. First, the best way
to help poor countries develop is to help pro
mote their economic growth. Second, foreign
aid should be treated like an investment, and
should be given to countries that can use it
well. Only countries meeting minimum re
quirements for measures like low govern
ment corruption are eligible, so that the
money will actually be used for citizens and
not on private jets.
The MCC has received very little atten
tion when compared to most Bush policies.
In fact, it's not even mentioned on the
Wikipedia page detailing Bush's initiatives.
But it deserves notice for two reasons: the
mission is important, and the MCC is suc
ceeding. Just this week, Tanzania became the
16th country to receive a Millennium Chal
lenge Compact. It was the biggest grant to
date, worth $698 million over five years.
Countries that don't qualify have been
scrambling to make reforms, and according
to the International Finance Corporation,
over 24 countries specifically mentioned the
MCC as a reason for improving their busi
ness climate.
When it comes to Bush's legacy, the MCC
