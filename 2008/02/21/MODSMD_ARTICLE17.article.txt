## When does not having a real job get embarrassing? 
### 
There are those that are super-prepared.
The make-you-feel-badders. They go
from Stanford Consulting to Gold
manSachs, from a bio and philosophy double
major straight into Harvard Med. They are
the ones that followed that natural flow of
job-getting — they interned at a great firm
and then Apple swooped down from the Job-
Filled Heavens and carried them off to its
cushy, dog-friendly workplace. They were the
super-dedicated hum bio studiers who
worked in free clinics and shadowed doctors
then had so many fat envelopes stuffing their
little P.O. boxes that annoyed post office
workers stopped trying to kick more med
school acceptance letters into them and just
permanently gave out keys to the big boy
lockers in the back.
I am a make-you-feel-badee. All I get in
my mail box is a warning that my GERs have
yet to be satisfied and weekly Lively Arts up
dates. (F your I, the dance companies have
been wonderful.) No, 1 haven't completed my
GERs, nor have I taken the GREs, although I
do own a Kaplan get-you-prepared-or-your
money-back book. I'd like to think thousands
— no, millions — of others out there are just
like me. As the judicious John Mayer once
sang, we are going through a "quarter-life cri
sis," and it takes time to find a true calling. In
fact, my wishy-washy post-grad plans have in
cluded becoming a ski patrol, hiking the Ap
palachian IVail and working on organic farms
in South America.
I'd like to think, however, that it is general
ly accepted to take some time off, do some
traveling, work at a cool (though not real) job.
It is exciting and fun when someone says he's
going to join the Peace Corps, teach art class
es, bartend for a year in New York or work as
a yoga instructor. When a friend mentions she
has plans to work as an au pair in Berlin or as
a ranch hand in Wyoming, you begin to wish

you had a command over two languages or
were living out the "Brokeback Mountain"
fantasy (minus the tragic ending, that is.) Why
not buy a flight around the world? Or live
with a cool pack of friends in Frisco?
The question is, will it be embarrassing at
my five-year high school reunion when I'll
have an ethnic embroidered bracelet and a
strange pair of leaf earrings to show for my
year abroad? A year abroad coupled with no
concrete plans lying patiently in its wake. And
so I stand there, punch in hand, wondering
when it will be embarrassing not to have a real
job. Will it be awkward talking to Rilla Mc-
Scrilla in my from-high-school-jeans and
Guatemalan tie-dye while she looks stunning
in Louis Vuitton? Will the med students, the I
bankers and the consultants make me feel
bad? Perhaps more importantly, will they feel
bad for me?
When do you go from becoming the cool
world traveler to the pitiably unfocused guy
who still has a sort-of funny blog with "Are
you jealous, suckas?" titling his pictures of ex
otic locales?
I have to wonder how long of a grace peri
od we as 20-somethings actually have be
tween college and the work force. I think,
sadly, that for many there is no wiggle room,
no time for adventures or jobs that don't build
to a bigger and better job. For them, it is either
higher education or a career worthy of the
400 Benjamins your parents shelled out each
year. Clearly, many think a year off is accept

able, maybe even two. In fact, I'd like to think
that in general the interim grace period be
tween college and the real world keeps in
creasing. In my parents' age, the linear pro
gression of growing up went from college to
immediately getting hitched, popping out ba
bies, grooming them to go to good colleges,
and then getting divorced. Now, we get much
married later, travel, go to grad school and
then get divorced.
Wonderfully, the average age of an enter
ing med student is 24 — that means people
are taking their time and taking two years off
before jumping head-long into post-grad pro
grams (or they are getting held back in ele
mentary school, either one). For all the Doo
gie Howsers, there is also Pa McGraw, scrag
gle-toothed and arthritic, learning right along
side the babes.
From the man who brought us "Strictly
Ballroom" and "Moulin Rouge," Aussie Baz
Luhrmann also gave us the 1999 radio sensa
tion the "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sun
screen)," which advises us, quite inspirational
ly, not to "feel guilty if you don't know what
you want to do with your life. The most inter
esting people I know didn't know at 22 what
they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the
most interesting 40 year olds I know still
don't."
So there you have it, folks, from an incon
trovertible source. From a summer to almost
two decades, clearly there are no right answers
to what you should be doing after college. The
world is our oyster, and let's enjoy it while we
can. All I know is that you won't find me em
barrassed as I am picking bananas in Costa
Rica. Or maybe teaching on the slopes of
Tahoe....Or maybe hiking the AT..Actually,
speaking of oysters, deep-sea diving sounds in
triguing t00...
