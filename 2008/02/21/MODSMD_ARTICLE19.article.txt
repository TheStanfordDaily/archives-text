Stonford football's
schedule is set
Stanford will begin the 2008 col
lege football season front and center
on the national stage.
It was announced today that the
C ardinal will open its season on
Thursday. Aug. 28 when it takes on
Pacific 10 Conference foe, Oregon
State. The game will be televised na
tionally on ESPN2.
'"We are thrilled to open the sea
son with a nationally televised ITiurs
day night ESPN game," Stanford
head coach Jim Harbaugh told
GoStanford.com."The national tele
cast will certainly give our fans and
alumni across the country a chance
to watch us play.
"Additionally, the opportunity to
be one of the first college football
teams to kick off the 2008 season is
certainly a plus for our program. We
know there will be challenges host
ing a weeknight home game, but we
hope our fans and our community
will embrace the opportunity and
help set the tone for a great year of
college football."
After a 4-8 campaign this past
year — which happened to see mon
umental wins over both USC and Cal
— Stanford looks to continue the
progress made under Harbaugh, now
in his second year at the helm of the
Cardinal football program.
Ray named International
Team coach
After winning a national champi
onship last year, Stanford golf coach
Conrad Ray will have a chance to
represent his country.
Ray, in his fourth season at the
Farm, was recently chosen to lead the
national squad as one of three 2008
International Team Coaches desig
nated by the Golf Coaches Associa
tion of America (GCAA).
Ray will coach the U.S. team
against Europe at the Palmer Cup,
which will take place from June 26-27
at the Glasgow Golf Club Gailes
Links in Scotland. The competition
models that of the Ryder Cup, pitting
the best collegiate golfers from the
United States and Europe against
one another.
The Stanford coach was thrilled
to be honored with the opportunity.
""It is a great honor to be selected
as the coach of the Palmer Cup," he
told GoStanford.com. "It will be ex
citing working with the nation's elite
college players and I am passionate
about bringing home a victory. It is
going to be a lot of fun. Mr. Palmer
should also be recognized for his
generous contributions to the colle
giate game."
