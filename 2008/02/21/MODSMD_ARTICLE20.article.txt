# BEARS UPSET NO. 3 CARDINAL
## "That's what happens sometimes and we have to regroup" â€”LELE FOROOD, Stanford Coach 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 3 Stanford women's tennis
team wanted to send a message to the
tennis world on Wednesday. Unfortu
nately, it was lost in translation along
the way.
Looking for an auspicious start to
Pacific-10 Conference play and to a
tough five-game road trip, the Cardi
nal faltered in a big way after suffer
ing a surprising 6-1 loss to archrival
No. 11 California. Stanford had led
the all-time series 58-7 and won the
last 12 consecutive meetings with Cal
coming into yesterday's match-up.
Though the score itself says a lot,
the match wasn't as clear-cut as it may
seem.
"We had our chances clearly,"
Stanford coach Lele Forood said. "We
started well in a bunch of those
matches and they climbed their way
back."
Despite losing two matches at the
Indoors last weekend, Cal refused to
give up against Stanford.
'"Their players play very consis
tent, long points and that's not used in
the Indoors," Forood said."They took
their losses at indoors, but they're cer
tainly more comfortable outside, es
pecially on their home court today.
"That made for a very different ex
perience for them."
On the day, Stanford lost three
matches in three sets, including soph
omore Lindsay Burdette at the num
ber one spot. Serving for the match at
5-4 in the third set against 2005
NCAA singles champion Susie
Babos, Burdette would soon fall 7-5 in
the final frame.
At number four, senior Celia
Durkin fell 6-3 in the third set. Fresh
man Carolyn McVeiuh lost 6-7.6-2.6-
2.
"We know who their players are
for sure." Forood said. "We knew that
we were in for a tough match. 1 cer
tainly don't think we expected to lose
to them 6-1. that's for sure."
In the match, Stanford definitely
showed its youth and inexperience at
times.
"We're a young team," Forood
said. "We're finding out that we have
to finish matches a little better."

the Cardinal women also entered the
match at a disadvantage with injuries.
"I don't want to dwell on excuses,

With the season currently in full
