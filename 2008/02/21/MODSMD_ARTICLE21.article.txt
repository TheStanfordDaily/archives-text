## Trying MPSF slate ahead No. 2 women face daunting conference schedule of nationally ranked opponents 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In many college sports, teams can go through an entire season
without truly earning their ranking. In football, for example, the
No. 1 ranked team in the NCAA will often face a few tough chal
lenges in their conference, maybe even another top-5 team, but
we rarely know with any certainty whether or not they would
beat the teams ranked No. 2 through No. 8. Luckily for fans of the
sport, women's water polo does not have this problem.
Currently, the top eight teams in the nation all compete in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, including our very own No.
2 Stanford squad. The conference also boasts the No. 10,12, 14
and 17 programs, meaning that even teams that finish with
mediocre conference records will still be some of the best in the
country.
"The MPSF is brutal," Stanford coach John Tanner said.
Tanner points to No. 8 — in both the conference and country
— Arizona State's recent victory over then-No. 2 USC as an ex
ample of the conference's parity. For the Stanford women, this
means that even though the Cardinal is considered one of the
early favorites for the national championship, it will need to be on
top of its game for the whole season just to finish as one of top
teams in its conference.
At the moment, UCLA sits at the top of the MPSF standings.
The Bruins are the defending MPSF and national champions and
have played like it so far. They have compiled a perfect 13-0
record, with eight of those victories coming by eight points or
more. Stanford has yet to play UCLA this season, but the Card
can gain confidence from the fact that many of the other MPSF
teams that UCLA has beaten have played them close.
