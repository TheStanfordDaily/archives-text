# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Trying MPSF slate ahead No. 2 women face daunting conference schedule of nationally ranked opponents 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In many college sports, teams can go through an entire season
without truly earning their ranking. In football, for example, the
No. 1 ranked team in the NCAA will often face a few tough chal
lenges in their conference, maybe even another top-5 team, but
we rarely know with any certainty whether or not they would
beat the teams ranked No. 2 through No. 8. Luckily for fans of the
sport, women's water polo does not have this problem.
Currently, the top eight teams in the nation all compete in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, including our very own No.
2 Stanford squad. The conference also boasts the No. 10,12, 14
and 17 programs, meaning that even teams that finish with
mediocre conference records will still be some of the best in the
country.
"The MPSF is brutal," Stanford coach John Tanner said.
Tanner points to No. 8 — in both the conference and country
— Arizona State's recent victory over then-No. 2 USC as an ex
ample of the conference's parity. For the Stanford women, this
means that even though the Cardinal is considered one of the
early favorites for the national championship, it will need to be on
top of its game for the whole season just to finish as one of top
teams in its conference.
At the moment, UCLA sits at the top of the MPSF standings.
The Bruins are the defending MPSF and national champions and
have played like it so far. They have compiled a perfect 13-0
record, with eight of those victories coming by eight points or
more. Stanford has yet to play UCLA this season, but the Card
can gain confidence from the fact that many of the other MPSF
teams that UCLA has beaten have played them close.
Stanford is currently second in the
rankings, one spot ahead of the team
that handed the Card its only loss of
the season. USC. After beating the
Cardinal, the Trojans lost two close
games in the Stanford Invitational to
Arizona State and UCLA.They have
bounced back of late, however, de
feating Irvine and winning their re
match with the Sun Devils, both on
the road, showing why they are still
ranked in the top three.
Hawaii and Cal hold the No. 4 and
5 spots in the rankings, respectively.
ITie Cardinal women topped both in
hard fought games at the Stanford In
vitational. beating Cal 11-6 and
Hawaii 10-6.
Rounding out the top eight are
San Diego State, San Jose State and
Arizona State. All three have started
the season strongly, especially the
Aztecs, who have amassed an 11-0
record.although they have yet to play
any teams in the top five.
As if having the top eight teams in
the country were not enough. No. 10
UC-Irvine, No. 12 Long Beach State,
No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara and No. 17
Cal State Northridge all play in the
MPSF as well.These four teams may
well find themselves in the awkward
position of being top-20 mainstays
while not even posing a serious threat
for their conference title.
In fact, only one of the confer
ence's 13 teams is unranked — Pacif
ic. It is without a doubt one of. if not
the strongest conferences in all of Di
vision I athletics.

ITiis concentration of power has
both good and bad consequences for
Stanford, along with the other top
teams in the MPSF. One negative ef
fect is that Stanford has very little
room for error if it wants to win the
conference title. If the Cardinal
women don't play up to their full po
tential against any given conference
opponent — and even if they do
sometimes — they will have a tough
time winning that game.
As coach Tanner said,"We have to

be sharp in every game against a con
ference opponent."
However, Stanford can also bene
fit from its strong conference. Be
cause the second-ranked women will
be playing the best of the best, they
will be able to measure themselves
against top-tier talent while finding
their weak spots and improving upon
them. Also, by the time the NCAA
tournament rolls around they will
have seen most of their fellow title
contenders already, and will know

what strategies work well against
them.
Ultimately, the difficulties posed
by the Cardinal's trying upcoming
conference schedule are exactly why
the team cannot wait to get started.
"Our athletes are here because
they love challenges," said Tanner.
"So we wouldn't want it any other
way."
