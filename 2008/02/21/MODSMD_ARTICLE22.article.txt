GAME NOTES: The No. 12 Cardinal
women will look to stay perfect in this
weekend's action in Fblrn Springs, Calif,
as Stanford will compete against a talent
ed field in the fblrn Springs Classic. Four
of six of Stanford's slated opponents are
nationally ranked, with No. 6 Oklahoma
being the most highly touted squad in the
field. The Cardinal have dominated their
competition thus far, outscoring their com
petition 57-4.

This 16-teani tourna
ment, played at the liig League Dreams sports complex — a col
lection of soft ball-proportioned replicas of Major League Base
hall stadiums — pits many of the best teams in the nation against
one another.

Ihc Cardinal looks to extend its longest winning streak to begin
a season since 2002 when it started 11-0. In 2001 Stanford began
12-0, the longest winning streak to start a season in school history.

to an easy Stanford Invitational crown last weekend.

plate and in the field, having won its
last six games by a combined score of
57-4. Five of those games were short
ened by the mercy rule.
Much of the Cardinal's early sea
son success can be attributed to jun
ior pitcher Missy Penna's domina
tion of opponents. Penna has al
lowed just two runs in 44.1 innings,
while striking out 58 batters on her
way to posting an 8-0 record. Her
performance the first week of the
season garnered national attention

when she was named USA Softball
National Player of the week.
Penna's pitching has been supple
mented recently by tremendous hit
ting from the Cardinal lineup. Eight
of nine regular starters are posting
an average .300 or better, and the
team is hitting .330 as a whole.
Freshman first baseman Melisa
Koutz and senior outfielder Anna
Beardman have led the way for
Stanford, each holding a .400 aver
age.
Koutz, as well as sophomores
Rosey Neill and Shannon Koplitz
have provided the run production,
with 11.13,and 14 RBIs respectively.
Neill, a catcher who leads the
team with three homeruns, feels like

the Cardinal lineup is just finding its
form.
"Each game it's a different part of
the lineup that is hitting," she said.
"Once we are all hitting.one through
nine. 1 think we'll be unstoppable."
Stanford will look to put it all to
gether this weekend, but it will not be
easy.
The Cardinal opens against un
ranked Florida Atlantic Thursday.
The Owls are the defending Sun Belt
Conference champions, and come
into the game holding a 4-5 record on
the season.
Florida Atlantic is led by sopho
more pitcher Amber Barton who is
3-2 with a 1.60 ERA on the season.
Despite the fact that Stanford

faces ranked opponents in its final
four games of the tournament, head
coach John Rittman is stressing to his
team to take the tournament one
game at a time.
"1 think we are prepared for the
challenge this weekend," Rittman
said, "A lot can happen in a tourna
ment like this, we have to make sure
not to look ahead or past any team
we play."
Stanford's toughest test will begin
tomorrow. After squaring off with 2-
3 Fordham in the morning, the Cardi
nal face the best team they will have
played so far this season. No. 6 Okla
homa.
ITie Soonerscome into the tourna
ment 9-2. holding a top ten ranking in

both national polls. Both of their loss
es have come to nationally ranked op
ponents.
Oklahoma is led offensively by
sophomore outfielder Amber Flores
who comes into the game hitting .375
with 3 homeruns. She also leads the
Big 12 Conference with 11 runs
scored.
In the circle, junior D.J. Mathis
leads the Sooners with a 6-0 record
and a 0.89 ERA.
On Saturday it won't get any easi

Ohio State owns an 8-2 mark for

plate and in the field, having won its
last six games by a combined score of
57-4. Five of those games were short
ened by the mercy rule.
Much of the Cardinal's early sea
son success can be attributed to jun
ior pitcher Missy Penna's domina
tion of opponents. Penna has al
lowed just two runs in 44.1 innings,
while striking out 58 batters on her
way to posting an 8-0 record. Her
performance the first week of the
season garnered national attention

when she was named USA Softball
National Player of the week.
Penna's pitching has been supple
mented recently by tremendous hit
ting from the Cardinal lineup. Eight
of nine regular starters are posting
an average .300 or better, and the
team is hitting .330 as a whole.
Freshman first baseman Melisa
Koutz and senior outfielder Anna
Beardman have led the way for
Stanford, each holding a .400 aver
age.
Koutz, as well as sophomores

with 11.13,and 14 RBIs respectively.

team with three homeruns, feels like

the Cardinal lineup is just finding its
form.
"Each game it's a different part of
the lineup that is hitting," she said.
"Once we are all hitting.one through
nine. 1 think we'll be unstoppable."
Stanford will look to put it all to
gether this weekend, but it will not be
easy.
The Cardinal opens against un
ranked Florida Atlantic Thursday.
The Owls are the defending Sun Belt
Conference champions, and come
into the game holding a 4-5 record on
the season.
Florida Atlantic is led by sopho
more pitcher Amber Barton who is
3-2 with a 1.60 ERA on the season.
Despite the fact that Stanford

faces ranked opponents in its final
four games of the tournament, head
coach John Rittman is stressing to his
team to take the tournament one
game at a time.
"1 think we are prepared for the
challenge this weekend," Rittman
said, "A lot can happen in a tourna
ment like this, we have to make sure
not to look ahead or past any team
we play."
Stanford's toughest test will begin
tomorrow. After squaring off with 2-
3 Fordham in the morning, the Cardi
nal face the best team they will have
played so far this season. No. 6 Okla
homa.
ITie Soonerscome into the tourna
ment 9-2. holding a top ten ranking in

both national polls. Both of their loss
es have come to nationally ranked op
ponents.
Oklahoma is led offensively by
sophomore outfielder Amber Flores
who comes into the game hitting .375
with 3 homeruns. She also leads the
Big 12 Conference with 11 runs
scored.
In the circle, junior D.J. Mathis
leads the Sooners with a 6-0 record
and a 0.89 ERA.
On Saturday it won't get any easi
er for Stanford as the Cardinal play
two more ranked teams, UNLV and
Ohio State.
The Rebels enter the tournament
with a 9-1-1 record, having won their
last six games.

Ohio State owns an 8-2 mark for
the year, and is coming off a defeat at
the hands of Florida International
Sunday.

more catcher Sam Marder — who is
hitting a gaudy .593 with 4 homeruns
and 19 RBl's on the season — and
