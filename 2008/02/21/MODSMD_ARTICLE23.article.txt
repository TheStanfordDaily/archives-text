GAME NOTES: The Stanford wrestling team's victory over
Arizona State was it's first in program history, ending
decades of frustration against the traditional Pac-10
powerhouse. The Cardinal finished the season with the
second best record in program history and the best
since 1975, and will now prepare to back that record
up at the Pac-10 Championships, which will determine
which wrestlers go on to take part in the NCAA tourna
ment.

Despite already securing the second-best
record in program history, Stanford wrestling
was looking to make yet another statement to
end the 2007-2008 regular season this past
Sunday. And with a 28-16 victory in Tempe,
Ariz., the Cardinal's first-ever win over Ari
zona State, Kerry McCoy's squad did just that
in their final tune-up prior to the all-impor
tant Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
beginning on March 2 in Eugene, Ore.
The Cardinal (13-4,6-3 Pac-10) got off to a
fast start against the Sun Devils (9-8. 3-5),
winning the opening match at 125 pounds by
forfeit before Porfirio Madrigal made per
haps his biggest statement of the year at 133
pounds. The Stanford freshman pinned his
ASU opponent at 6:44. with just 16 seconds
remaining, to put the Cardinal up 12-0 and
give Stanford the clear edge in momentum.
The win by fall was Madrigal's third such vic
tory of the year and first in a dual meet.
The Devils answered back at 141 pounds
with a major decision for four team points, but
Stanford rallied again with big wins in the
next two matches. At 149 pounds redshirt
freshman Lucas Espericueta notched his
third pin of the year at 4:30, improving his
record to 23-10 on the year. No. 10 senior Josh
Zupancic followed with a 19-5 major deci
sion, coming just one point shy of a win by
technical fall to boost the Cardinal's 22-4

lead.
Stanford suffered losses in three of the re
maining five matches, but a close 1-0 win by
junior Luke Feist at 174 pounds and an 11-4
victory by sophomore Jake Johnson at 197
pounds were enough for the Cardinal to hold

on for the match win and history.
"It was great, just being able to go down
there and beat "a team |like that]," McCoy
said. "It's funny, we were sitting there before
the match, and you look up at their banners,
like every gym has banners, and Arizona

State has about 20 Pac-10 Conference Cham
pionship banners. 'ITiere were a few series
where they won eight, nine. 10 in a row.
"To see that and then go out and win in
their gym. it's great," he continued. "Their
team has been a little bit down, they've got a

couple of kids out of their lineup, but to get a
win and have it on our stat-sheet as a win
against Arizona State really starts to solidify
how successful this year has been for us."

Junior Luke Feist helped cement the Cardinal's victory over ASU with a narrow, 1-0 victory at 174 pounds. Feist and his teammates will now prepare for the Pac-10 tourney, opening March 2.
And what a year it has been for
McCoy and the Cardinal. The third
year Stanford coach deferred much
of the credit for his team's increased
success since his arrival to the foun
dation laid by previous coaching
regimes, his assistants and the ath
letes who "bought in" to his philoso
phy. But whatever the reason, the
Cardinal wrestling team is on a path
it hasn't been for some time with the
all-important postseason tourna
ments fast approaching.
"1 think we're a little bit ahead of
[where we thought we'd be]," McCoy
said. "We had high hopes for the
year, we really thought we could be
undefeated in dual meets. And the
four losses that we had, three of those
matches were one match swing â€” if
we win one [more] match then we
win the dual."
"That's really not that bad of a
way to finish our season, with four
losses all within one match of a dif
ference," he continued. "The
biggest thing is that we beat a lot of
teams pretty soundly; that shows
that we have a lot of potential. And
we've had some injuries and some
guys in and out of the lineup, but
there's a Stanford pride going on
right now."
In laying out his team's training
strategy between now and the Pac
-10 tournament in just over a week,
McCoy emphasized the work his
team had already put in this season
and how far they had come collec
tively.

"I tell our guys, the work's been
done, the money's in the hank, now
we just need to fine-tune the way
we're going to go out and perform,"'
he said. "Getting individual strate
gies to each one of the guys, scouting
their opponents so they can have a
plan for who they're going to wrestle
and go out there and perform [is
going to be important]. The biggest
thing now is to get everyone a chance
to place in the tournament and get
everyone to the NCAA tourna
ment."
One thing's for sure: the Cardi
nal's prospects to do just that in the
Pac-10 this year are better than they
have been in a long time.
