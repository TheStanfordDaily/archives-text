### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During his final speech last month on free culture, a topic
that has garnered him national attention over the last
decade, Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig announced
that he would shift his focus to fighting political corruption.
Now, Lessig just might take the issue directly to Congress
himself.
Lessig is on the verge of running for a seat in the House
of Representatives left vacant by the death of Rep. Tom
Lantos (D-Calif.) in the state's 12th Congressional District.
The professor plans to announce his decision about a
potential run by about Mar. I.A special election will be held
to fill the seat on April 8.
"For someone who is studying corruption to go to the
seat of power to change things would be extraordinary," said
Harvard Law Prof. John Palfrey, who is organizing an
Internet-based "Draft Lessig" movement urging the profes
sor to run.
Regardless of whether or not he decides to run. Lessig
has made it clear that he is committed to changing Congress
in his fight against political corruption.
"What I've outlined is a strategy that, through a couple of
election cycles, will build a number of candidates that would
commit to three simple propositions that would radically
change how Congress works," Lessig told The Daily.

Lessig's three central reforms would ban earmarks, pro-

hibit politicians from accepting money from lobby-

ists and support public financing of cam-

paigns.
' "We can agree to disagree about
the Iraq war, but these three issues i
heed to be resolved," Lessig said.

*The bipartisan commitment [to
the three propositions] could

fommit enough congressmen
make a difference." i

Lessig's possible candidaq
Those telling him not to
fun have said that joining a

body of 435 rep

mired in the
partisan poli-

tics of
Washington
would be a
waste of

fcessig's famed 1
intellect. Some 1
supporters say he

could better use
his time by influ-

encing presidential

candidates and perhaps
securing a federal judgeship.

But Lessig said the federal bench is the wrong place for
his crusade against corruption.
"I certainly think the federal judiciary is the wrong place
to produce change " Lessig said.
Lessig is also skeptical of the ability of the President
