## Lessig may run for Congress Online movement urges Law prof. to declare candidacy for open House seat 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During his final speech last month on free culture, a topic
that has garnered him national attention over the last
decade, Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig announced
that he would shift his focus to fighting political corruption.
Now, Lessig just might take the issue directly to Congress
himself.
Lessig is on the verge of running for a seat in the House
of Representatives left vacant by the death of Rep. Tom
Lantos (D-Calif.) in the state's 12th Congressional District.
The professor plans to announce his decision about a
potential run by about Mar. I.A special election will be held
to fill the seat on April 8.
"For someone who is studying corruption to go to the
seat of power to change things would be extraordinary," said
Harvard Law Prof. John Palfrey, who is organizing an
Internet-based "Draft Lessig" movement urging the profes
sor to run.
Regardless of whether or not he decides to run. Lessig
has made it clear that he is committed to changing Congress
in his fight against political corruption.
"What I've outlined is a strategy that, through a couple of
election cycles, will build a number of candidates that would
commit to three simple propositions that would radically
change how Congress works," Lessig told The Daily.

Lessig's three central reforms would ban earmarks, pro-

hibit politicians from accepting money from lobby-

ists and support public financing of cam-

paigns.
' "We can agree to disagree about
the Iraq war, but these three issues i
heed to be resolved," Lessig said.

*The bipartisan commitment [to
the three propositions] could

fommit enough congressmen
make a difference." i

fcessig's famed 1

supporters say he

could better use
his time by influ-

encing presidential

candidates and perhaps
securing a federal judgeship.

But Lessig said the federal bench is the wrong place for
his crusade against corruption.
"I certainly think the federal judiciary is the wrong place
to produce change " Lessig said.
Lessig is also skeptical of the ability of the President

alone to create change.
"One of the things I've been focusing on is the limited
possibility of change through presidents," Lessig said.
"I've been a vocal supporter of Obama, and I certainly
hope he is president. But if he is president, he can't make
these changes alone; he needs support from people who
believe in his values."
Should Lessig decide to run. his most formidable
opponent would be California State Senator Jackie
Speier (D-San Francisco, San Mateo), who is currently
favored to win the seat. Speier was endorsed by Rep.
Lantos before his death and has received the backing of

9
Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.).
Although he does not underestimate the possibility of
a difficult race against Speier, Lessig said he is confident
of his chances.
"It's a very difficult challenge, and I do think it's possi
ble," Lessig said. "I voted for her for state senator. One of
the things I'm reviewing is how feasible it is."
Lessig cited his approach to money and his technolog
ical expertise as the two factors that will set him apart
from Speier.
. "She has a different ethic. She accepts money from the
interests she regulates," Lessig said, referring to reports

that Speier, who chairs ihe Senate's Insurance
Committee, received $250,000 from insurance companies.
"That's exactly the kind of practice that we need to
change," Lessig said.
Speier's campaign vigorously denied allegations that
the funding influenced the state senator's decision-mak
ing.
"This is a woman who is an independent voice," said
Alex Tourk, a spokesman for Speier. "We think the voters
are smart enough and educated enough to understand
that."
Lessig believes that his historv of involvement with

"We are pleasantly
surprised by the number of
people in his district and
people nationally and
internationally that support
him."

Harvard Law Professor
technology would be an important issue in an election,
especially because the 12th Congressional District
includes Silicon Valley.
"Speier would be a Silicon Valley representative, so it
is extraordinarily important that she actually knows
about technology," Lessig said. "I don't think of myself as
a geek, more a geek wannabe, but I have spent 10 years
on technology and know the topic intimately. 1 really do
know what conditions are needed for Silicon Valley to
flourish."
As Lessig makes his decision, he is carefully weighing
the support he has received over the Internet as well as
the opinions of some of his supporters that he should not
run.
Palfrey's "Draft Lessig" efforts include a Web site, a
wiki and a Facebook group with over 3,000 members. On
Monday the "Draft Lessig" group began accepting cam
paign donations through Act Blue, an online campaign
donation site.
Within two days Lessig had more than twice the num
ber of donors on the site of any other Democratic rival.
"I've been overwhelmed by the response," Palfrey
said. "We are pleasantly surprised by the number of peo
ple in his district and people nationally and international
ly that support him."
