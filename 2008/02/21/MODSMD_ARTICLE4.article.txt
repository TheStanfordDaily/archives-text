# WINFREY CHOSEN AS COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER
## Oprah for '08 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Unlike last year's highly criticized speaker choice,
this year's Commencement speaker will not be suf
fering from a lack of star power.
Oprah Winfrey, the world famous talk-show host
and philanthropist, has accepted the University's
invitation to speak at Stanford's 118 th
Commencement.
Oprah's choice to speak at Stanford may have
been influenced by the upcoming graduation of her
goddaughter. Kirby Bumpus '08.
"She doesn't really do commencements unless it's
for someone she knows," Bumpus said. "That's the
only reason she's coming. She gets asked a lot, so she
can really do it only when she has a special connec
tion."
Oprah's invitation follows last year's selection of
poet Dana Gioia, who many students complained
lacked sufficient name recognition.
"Obviously Oprah won't have that problem at
all," said Senior Class President Melinda Lee *08.
"She does have celebrity star power, but beyond that
she can provide seniors with a wonderful and enthu
siastic speech. Her whole life is based off of being a
motivational speaker."
Senior Class President Brent Pirruccello "08 said
this year's speaker selection process was not influ
enced by negative reactions to the choice of Gioia.
"1 would say every year, the class presidents and
the President's office do their best to bring in a
speaker that will really satisfy everyone, and it does
n't work out every year," Pirruccello said. "There was
a big effort put in [this year], but there is always a
large effort put in."

Many seniors were happy that this year's speaker
is a household name.
"It'll be fun to tell people later who our
Commencement speaker was and have them know
who it is," said Katie O'Neil '08.
Oprah, however, was not chosen to speak exclu
sively because of her fame.
"Each year at Commencement we encourage
graduating students to think about the skills they
have acquired and the impact they can have in the
world," Stanford President John Hennessy said in a
statement. "1 can think of few people who have put
such advice to better use than Oprah Winfrey."
Oprah's impressive philanthropic record and suc
cess as a businesswoman was a major reason the
University asked her to speak.
"She has relentlessly continued her education and
sought to improve the world in remarkable and var
ied ways," Hennessy said. "Her efforts in the areas of
philanthropy — and her heartfelt desire to improve
the lives of less fortunate people — serve as a model
to us all."
"She's a great role model for women," said
Lauren Falcao '08. "I'm really excited about it."
Still, not all seniors are enthusiastic about this
year's speaker choice.
"As an average college male, my universe and the
universe of Oprah don't intersect at all," said
Andrew Day '08. "I'm sure my mom will be happy,
but the only way I'll be happy is if she gives us free
cars."
The class presidents consider themselves fortu
nate that Bumpus has a close relationship with
Oprah.
"1 feel very lucky that Kirby was in the class of
2008." said Senior Class President Jessica Stanley '08.

"President 1 lennessy's office was working with Kirby
and us simultaneously."
Bumpus is confident that her godmother will pro
vide a memorable commencement address.
"She's an amazing speaker," Bumpus said, "and 1
know she'll have some great words for our class."
