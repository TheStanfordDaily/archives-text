## Pelosi takes trip to Farm Speaker discusses health, presidential election 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford played host yesterday to
one of the most recognizable figures in
the Democratic Party, who was on cam
pus to discuss the future of the
American health care system.
No, it wasn't Sen. Barack Obama (D
-111.) or Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.)
outlining the nuances of their respective
platforms, but rather Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who met
with President John Hennessy and a
group of health policy experts to talk
about the future of health care in the
United States.
In a press conference after the meet
ing, which was closed to the media,
Pelosi spoke to reporters about the
details of the day's Health Care Forum
and about the chaotic battle for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Even as she emphasized her own
neutrality in the race, Pelosi told
reporters that she believed the hotly
contested fight between Clinton and
Obama would be settled before the
party's convention in August — even
though neither candidate is within strik
ing distance of the 2,025 delegates need
ed to clinch the nomination.
"I believe this will be resolved before
we get to the convention." Pelosi said,
"and whether somebody has the 2,025
or not, they'll be in range and it will take
shape."
"I have confidence that this will fall
into place," she added.

Pelosi — who, as one of her party's
most prominent figures, could potential
ly play an influential role if neither
Obama nor Clinton arrives at the con
vention in Denver with the requisite
number of delegates — deftly avoided
further questions about the nomination
process but reaffirmed her support of
the two candidates and her confidence
in their electability.
"1 am absolutely, positively delighted
at both of the candidates," she said. "The
person we nominate at the convention
will be the next President of the United
States, whoever he or she may be."
The Speaker was flanked at the press
conference by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-

Calif.) — Pelosi's colleague in the
I louse of Representatives whose district
includes Stanford — and Medical
School Dean Philip Pizzo, both of whom
were participants in the Health Care
Forum.
Pelosi called the conference a
"breakthrough meeting" in the context
of health care reform, which is central to
the platforms of the two Democratic
presidential candidates, and said that the
conference was just as much about
health as it was about health care.
"We need a massive infusion of
resources into biomedical research. We

need a commitment to science and
technology," she said. "We're talking
about how we can have the best
health — not just health care — for
all Americans."
The Speaker also framed the
meeting in the context of the health
care reforms proposed by both
Clinton and Obama.
"1 think the two candidates'
health care proposals are very simi
lar," she said. "Whereas the candi
dates are talking about the accessi
bility of health care, we are talking

about the health of the American
people. Iliese things are comple
mentary."
In addition to Pelosi, Eshoo,
Hennessy and Pizzo, a number of
prominent health policy experts par
ticipated in yesterday's forum. They
included John Chambers, Cisco
Systems' chairman and CEO:
Benjamin Chu, regional president of
Kaiser Permanente Southern
California; John Freidenrich '59. the
director of Stanford Hospital and
Clinics and former Chairman of the
University's Board of Trustees; and
Elias Zerhouni, the director of the
National Institutes of Health.
