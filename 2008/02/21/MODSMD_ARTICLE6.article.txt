## Prof. seeks election reform Koza fights for end to Electoral College system 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
If John Koza would have had
his way eight years ago, Al Gore
would be president.
The consulting professor of
electrical engineering hopes to cir
cumvent the complexities of the
Electoral College and guarantee
that the next commander in chief
will he elected by popular vote
instead.
The National Popular Vote hill,
drafted in 2006 and endorsed by
The New York Times, Chicago Sun
Times, Minneapolis Star-Tribune,
Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe
and Sacramento Bee, would guar
antee the presidency to the candi
date who receives the most votes
out of all 50 states and the District
of Columbia. States that sign onto
the bill promise to award the
entire share of their electoral votes
to the candidate who wins the pop
ular vote nationwide, regardless of
which candidate carries that state.
"When the bill is enacted in a
group of states possessing 270 or
more electoral votes (enough to
elect a president]," said Koza in an
email to The Daily, "all of the elec
toral votes from those states would
be awarded, as a bloc, to the presi
dential candidate who receives the
most popular votes in all 50 states
and DC."
In less than two years, the
National Popular Vote bill has
been enacted into law in Maryland
and New Jersey and is on the gov
ernor's desk in Illinois.The bill has
passed 14 legislative houses, and
801 state legislators currently
endorse the bill.
Koza, chairman of National
Popular Vote Inc., believes that by
standardizing the way states award
their electoral votes, the bill will
give every voter equal influence
and keep candidates from ignoring
some states in favor of key battle
grounds like Ohio and Florida.
"Under the winner-take-all
rule, candidates have no reason to
poll, visit, advertise, organize, cam
paign or worry about the concerns
of voters of states that they cannot
possibly win or lose," Koza said.
"This means that voters in two
thirds of the states are effectively
disenfranchised in presidential
elections because candidates con
centrate their attention on a small
handful of'battleground' states."
In 2004, candidates concentrat
ed over two-thirds of their money
in live states, over 80 percent in
nine states and over 99 percent in
16 states, according to Koza.
Despite growing national
momentum, some political science
scholars are skeptical about the
proposal's future success.

"As much as I would prefer see
ing the president chosen by a
direct national popular vote and
do away with the Electoral
College entirely, 1 am very doubt
ful about this proposal," said
Political Science and History Prof.
Jack Rakove. "Because it involves
a fundamental change in the con
stitutional system, it really should
be done by Article V amendment,
rather than through a gimmick."
Rakove noted that there are
serious constitutional obstacles
that would hinder this proposal's
adoption by an interstate compact.
"Under the Constitution, such
compacts require the approval of
Congress. I understand that propo
nents can point to a line of cases in
which the Supreme Court has
allowed some compacts to be
exempted from that requirement,
but if challenged, as this one is
likely to be, I find it hard to
believe that such precedents
would cover this case — again,
because it implicates a core consti
tutional procedure, not akin to. say
regulating a watershed or whatev
er."
Laurel Harbridge, a doctoral
candidate in political science, said
that the proposal has more prob
lems than it has merits.
"It alters the strategy of candi
dates. in effect making fewer states
the focus of candidates and thus
less competitive," she said. "Under
the current system small and

medium-sized states get candidate
attention, particularly if they are
competitive like Ohio. Under the
national plan, candidates could
win elections by just focusing on a
few large states."
"The implications of this for the
types of candidates that are elect
ed and the policies they pursue
will depend on whether the large,
populous states are representative
of the rest of the country," she
added. "My guess is that they are
not."
Students and faculty agree that
in order to have an impact, a large
number of states would need to
sign on to the proposal. However,
they acknowledge that political
reality might make this difficult.
"There is a major collective
action problem," said Neil
Malhotra, a political science doc
toral candidate. "All states need to
move together to adopt the sys
tem. If only one state does it, then
it reduces the independent power
of that state."
Rakove agreed.
"One has to wonder about the
likelihood of states defecting from
any agreement based on partisan
considerations," he said, "so there
are genuine concerns as to how
stable such a compact — even if
forged and not successfully chal
lenged — would be."
