### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
If John Koza would have had
his way eight years ago, Al Gore
would be president.
The consulting professor of
electrical engineering hopes to cir
cumvent the complexities of the
Electoral College and guarantee
that the next commander in chief
will he elected by popular vote
instead.
The National Popular Vote hill,
drafted in 2006 and endorsed by
The New York Times, Chicago Sun
Times, Minneapolis Star-Tribune,
Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe
and Sacramento Bee, would guar
antee the presidency to the candi
date who receives the most votes
out of all 50 states and the District
of Columbia. States that sign onto
the bill promise to award the
entire share of their electoral votes
to the candidate who wins the pop
ular vote nationwide, regardless of
which candidate carries that state.
"When the bill is enacted in a
group of states possessing 270 or
more electoral votes (enough to
elect a president]," said Koza in an
email to The Daily, "all of the elec
toral votes from those states would
be awarded, as a bloc, to the presi
dential candidate who receives the
most popular votes in all 50 states
and DC."
In less than two years, the
National Popular Vote bill has
been enacted into law in Maryland
