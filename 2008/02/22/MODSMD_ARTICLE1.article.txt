CARDINAL RULE
No. 9 Stanford goes for Cal sweep at home
By DANIEL NOVINSON
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Give Cal basketball credit for clawing tooth and nail
with Stanford the past few seasons.The Cardinal has been
the stronger program over the last decade, is far-better
known outside the Bay Area, and — as many Cal fans
would say — has a better coach, as Bear head coach Ben
Braun is none too popular in Berkeley.
But, if recent history is any guide, none of that will mat
ter much when these two rivals tip-off Sunday at 6 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. Last year, No.9 Stanford (21-4,10-3) han
dled Cal (15-9, 6-7) l X)-71 in Berkeley, but lost 67-63 at
home. The year before, each team won at home. Stanford
by 14 and Cal by three. The season before that, 2004-05,
Stanford won both games, but lost guard Dan Grunfeld
for the season on an ACL tear, as he fouled from behind
on a fast break in the home game. He was never the same
player in his remaining 16 months at Stanford.
"With Cal,they always play us tough and we had to re
ally pull through last year in the stretch," junior forward
Lawrence Hill said.
The teams' last contest also came down to the final
minutes four weeks ago in Berkeley. Stanford came out on
top, 82-77, with sophomore centers Brook and Robin
Lopez leading the way with 23 points and 14 rebounds, re
spectively.
Cal outplayed the Cardinal on the perimeter. Five
Bears reached double figures, many on outside shooting
and quick drives to the hoop, and the Bears outshot Stan
ford 47 percent to 41 percent. But Stanford was too much
down low. with 21 offensive rebounds.24 made free throws
and 24 points in the paint. ,
Expect Stanford to pound it inside and attempt to ex
ploit its advantage in the post once again.The key match
ups then involve four players with bright futures at the
next level: the Lopez twins against
Cal's Ryan Anderson (22 points, 10
rebounds per game) and DeVon
Hardin (10 points, 8 rebounds per
game). Head coach Trent Johnson
won't say it. but again, if recent histo
ry's any judge, Stanford's duo should
have the upper hand.
"The biggest thing with [Ander
son] is our matchup ability to be tall
and quick, with the twins and other
guys that can guard him," said Hill of
the player he and Johnson called Cal's
best. "He's really good at taking it to a
big, slower guy: he just uses his athleti
cism and feel for the game. And then
out on the wing. Robin's done a real
ly good job of staying with him as op
posed to falling asleep because he's
only used to only guarding guys to the
free throw line."
Cal. meanwhile, will look to run it
with forward Patrick Christopher and

GAME NOTES; Stanford, currently a gome and a^l*
half out of first place in the Pac-10, looks to keep
pace with conference-leading UCLA. The Cardi -
nal will most likely be led by Brook Lopez, who
had 23 points in the team's 82-77 win at Cat
last month. Stanford (21 -4, 10-3 Pac-10) is cur
rently ranked No. 9 in the nation.

Women to baffle Bears
No. 7 Stanford faces off against
No. 8 Cal for Pac-10 supremacy
By WYNDAM MAKOWSKY and
SCOTT BLAND
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team may
be ranked ahead of No. 8 California, but the Bears
still hold a one-game lead over the Cardinal in the
Pacific-10 Conference standings. Stanford will be
looking to change that this Saturday when the team
travels to Berkeley for its rematch with Cal.
"Our team is excited about the rematch." Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said."We're play
ing well and they're playing well,so we expect it'll be
a great game."
In the teams' first match-up. Stanford blew out Cal at
home. 72-52.
California head coach Joanne Boyle acknowl
edged what that defeat meant and conceded that.de
spite holding the league lead, her squad might be an
underdog heading into this game.
"We didn't perform over there," Boyle said. "It
doesn't matter that we're a game ahead."
But VanDerveer feels differently and is treating
this game as a rare instance when the Cardinal is the
underdog.
"Last time 1 checked, they were in first place,"she
said.
Although the Bears have won every other game
on the conference schedule, the team hit a rough

Candidate
for Tree
disqualified
Jack Cackler removed from
Tree race after bold stunt
By STEPHANIE WERNER
STAFF WRITER
After a too daring stunt. Jack Cackler '09
has officially been disqualified from Tree
Week.
"[Cacklerj's being booted from Tree Week
and that's final." Scott Bland '10, director of
Public Relations for Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, told The Daily.
A group of former Trees informed Cackler
of the band's decision Wednesday evening.
"I talked to him
about the general
situation in the
sense of where the
band stands on all
of it and where I
stand on all of it,"
said John Whipple

"I'm not going to
make a comment
specifically about
what we talked
about."
Candidates
competing to be
next year's Tree were informed of the rules at
the beginning of Tree Week. Whipple said.
"They were given general guidelines," he
said. "You can't set yourself on fire. You can't
get yourself electrocuted."
"The other rule is that you can't send your
self to the hospital." he added."so [do] nothing
that will harm yourself so seriously that you
will need to go to the hospital. That's a general
guideline that can he interpreted however."
On Hiesday, Cackler charged through an
aisle of friends who struck him in the chest with
fluorescent light bulbs in White Plaza.
"Tree stunts are supposed to demonstrate
showmanship and uncommon creativity and
being smart," said Bland, representative of the
band. "All that he proved two days ago was that
he is not particularly creative and not particu
larly smart."
Cackler recognized that the light bulb stunt
was a little too extreme.
"I feel bad because I had intended the ulti
mate focus of my campaign to be more on what
I could bring to the community" he said, "but
all anyone could talk about was the reckless
ness of one of my early stunts.
"While the extremity of one stunt in partic

Cardinal Baseball Preview
STANFORD LEADS OFF
By ERIK ADAMS
DESK EDITOR
It may still be February, but the boys of summer
will be out in full force this weekend as Stanford
baseball kicks off its 2008 campaign with a four
game series against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at
the newly renamed Klein Field at Sunken Dia
mond.
The Feb 22 start is the latest that Stanford has
ever begun a season, as NCA A rule changes this
year pushed back the starting date to make the
schedule more fair to teams from colder climates.
The 2(X)8 Cardinal squad is looking to rebound
from a 2(X)7 season which saw them finish 28-28 (9-
15 Pac-10) and miss the NCAA tournament for the
first time since 1993. The Card struggled both on
the mound and in the field last year; however, the
bats got hot at the end of the season, plating 104
runs during a 9-1 finish.
Last season the struggles came not so much
from cold bats as they did from poor pitching and
shaky defense — especially in the infield. The
team's fielding percentage of .963 and ERA of 6.01
both ranked last in the Pac-10; the lofty ERA was
the worst in Stanford baseball history.
There is reason to be optimistic that these num
bers will improve, though, as Stanford is returning
29 players from last season's squad — including 13
of 14 pitchers.
"The teams that do well in any conference are
the teams that have veterans coming back," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We know we have
good players, and we'd like to think that they will
get the job done this year. F or as to have a good sea
son, our older players have to have their best years.
That's when you get into the postseason."
Probably the biggest returning name for Stan
ford is junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff. Ratliff hit
.339 last year while starting 55 games for the Card.
He also finished in the top-10 in the Pac-10 in runs,
total bases, triples, at-bats and slugging percentage.
Joining Ratliff in the outfield will be junior Joey
August (343,27 RBI last year) and senior Brent
Domaracki (.310,20 RBI). Junior Jeff Whitlow and
sophomore Toby Gerhart will also see time.
The infield is looking to put the sloppy defense
of last year behind it.and will be returning four
starters —junior Jason Castro, sophomore
Adam Gaylord, junior Brent Milleville and
junior Cord Phelps. As a rookie at shortstop
last year,Gaylord hit .283 and turned in some
spectacular plays in the field, but also record
ed 10 errors.
Phelps played at second, third and short last sea
son, but probably will stay at second this year. 1 le
has a solid bat — hitting .301 last season — but
needs to improve on his 16 errors. Castro and
