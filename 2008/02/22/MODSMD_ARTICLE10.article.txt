# Counting sheep with Dr. Dement
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN MANAGING EDITOR 
Ask William Charles Dement what his
middle initial stands for. and he'll tell
you "Crusader." A little eccentric but al
ways good-humored, the 79-year-old
Medical School professor is an evangel
ist — just not for Jesus.Three times a week, for 50
minutes, he espouses his message like a revivalist
preacher to a packed Kresge Auditorium.
"People are dying as I'm speaking whose lives
could be saved by sleep knowledge," said Dement.
"We need to lower the floodgates or blow up the
dam so knowledge can flow to people who need
it."
For almost four decades, he's been teaching
"Sleep and Dreams," one of the most popular
classes ever offered at Stanford. The first time, in
the winter of 1971. he spoke from the pulpit in the
stained glass-filled sanctuary of Memorial Church.
By his estimate, more than 20.000 students have
taken the class since.
He feels a calling to spread the gospel of slum
ber, as if the lives of his students depended on it.
"This may not seem like the highest intellectu
al level of teaching, but it's why three people came
up to me and told me I saved their lives," he said
last week, announcing to the class that he keeps a
folder of letters from former patients who credit
ed him for advice or treatment.
Driving while tired can be as bad. or worse, than
driving while drunk, he tells students. Behind al
most every major industrial failure, in his view, is
someone deprived of sleep.
If students take away only one thing from the
class, Dement insists that it be his creed. "Drowsi
ness is Red Alert."
The idea is that someone is almost asleep when
they start to feel the telltale signs of drowsiness.
This fatigue should be taken as a final warning sign
from a body desperate for rest. If you're driving
and start to feel drowsy. Dement tells his students,
immediately Dement is a true performer,
publicly embarrassing those who fall asleep during
his lecture by having one of his 10 teaching assis
tants spray them with squirt guns, take their pic
tures and ask about the last things they remember.
Dement talks about "sleep debt," his idea that
missing sleep night after night accumulates.
"Sleep debt can only be reduced by obtaining
extra sleep." he said.
Dement faults many doctors for misdiagnosing
sleep-related illnesses. He gets upset when police
characterize fatal car crashes caused by a driver
falling asleep as "accidents without a cause."
Each meeting, the names of students are
flashed onto the screen and they are told to shout

70% of Americans do not sleep alone.
25% of sleep is rapid-eye movement sleep, also
known as dreaming sleep.
■ More than 80% of all adult males snore.
■ 50 million people have serious sleep disorders.
■ 100 million people unknowingly carry a huge
sleep debt.
■ The average person dreams about two hours each
night.

out his I iallelujah chorus, the "Red Alert" mantra.
Students who don't belt it out properly get booed
by the crowd until they do it with more gusto.
"Is there any chance that in your later life you
will not remember this sentence?" he asked. "The
goal is to get it so etched into your mind that you
don't forget it."
To get students excited, he used to bring nar
coleptic dogs in for show-and-tell.
ITiat unorthodox teaching style, combined with
a widespread perception that the class is an easy
way to fulfill the natural science general education
requirement, makes him popular among students.
To spread the Good News about the benefits of
sleep. Dement employs his students as disciples.
One assignment is an "outreach project," through
which students relay his wisdom to the larger com
munity.
Some traveled to Menlo-Atherton I ligh School
to give 50-minute lessons to students on dozing.
Others produced videos or set up tables in White
Plaza. [Disclosure: a copy of this article will be sub
mitted as part of this reporter's project.]
"The evidence is piling up that, as people lower
their sleep debt, everything gets better from qual
ity of life to stamina." Dement said.
The pioneer in the scientific study of sleep is
now an old-timer. 1 le often references research-he
did at the University of Chicago during the 1950s
— before almost all of his students' parents were
born.
Dement insists he'll keep teaching as long as he
is able, even though he temporarily stopped in
2003, after announcing it would be his last year.
He still works at least 40 hours a week and
fundraises for the Sleep Disorders Clinic and Re
search Center that he directs. The fifth edition of
his textbook for medical students is "in the works."

I le'd like to see u major or a department dedi
cated to the study of sleep. Dement said in an in
terview that Psychiatry Associate Prof. Clete
Kushida might take over when he finally throws in
the towel on teaching.
Personally, Dement still tries to sleep seven
and-a-half hours a night.
"I'm very, very sensitive" he said, "to being
sleep deprived."
