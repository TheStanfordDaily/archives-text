## Kimball struck by scammers 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DUSK EDITOR 
Kimball Hall was targeted by a pair of men selling
magazine subscriptions, possibly as part of a nationwide
scam based out of New York.
According to residents, two unknown individuals
entered Kimball on Tuesday afternoon, going door-to
door soliciting students to purchase magazines and
donate to charities, requiring that they sign checks on
the spot. While residents and housing officials were con
vinced the individuals were con artists, the Department
of Public Safety, upon making contact with the pair,
deemed that "they were there conducting legitimate
business."
At 2 p m„ a Kimball resident contacted residence
officials about a young man trying to solicit magazine
subscriptions from students in the building, according to
Sue Nunan, director of housing assignments.
Nunan said in an email to The Daily that officers
were contacted immediately following the report and
that later in the afternoon residents were reminded to
enforce resident security measures by not propping
doors and first floor windows open.
Stanford Police Deputy Chris Cohendet said in an
email to The Daily that officers concluded after speak
ing with the suspects that their claims were authentic.
In an email sent out to the Kimball residence list,
however. Aram Zinzalian '10 claimed that the two men
tried to sell him magazine subscriptions on behalf of
Jaguar Sales LLC, and after researching the company
online, he became convinced they were frauds.
Jaguar Sales LLC has been the subject of numerous
accusations and legal disputes nationwide, ranging from
unlawful employment and sales practices to sales fraud,
according to the Office of the New York State Attorney
General.
In August 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo filed suit against the company in State Supreme
Court, charging that the company illegally recruits

young workers to sell magazine subscriptions, requires
them to travel far from home to solicit sales, withholds
their wages and prevents them from returning home.
Those residents who were propositioned by the mag
azine solicitors said that the men appeared very unpro
fessional and came across as extremely suspicious.
"I let them come into my room and talk to me for like
15 minutes." said one Kimball resident, who wished to
remain anonymous out of concern for her safety. "It was
not a good idea in retrospect."
According to the resident, the two individuals
knocked on her door and claimed that they were selling
magazine subscriptions as part of a contest through
which they could win a trip to Europe.
She said the two men were charming, but aroused her
suspicions. In addition to being dressed casually, she
said, they were unusually fast-paced in their presenta
tion and placed a great deal of pressure on her to buy
something. A sheet showing the list of magazines they
were supposedly selling also struck her as strange.
"It almost looked like a sheet of paper from a maga
zine cut out and laminated," the resident said.
After trying repeatedly to convince her to purchase a
magazine subscription — the cheapest one was $65 —
the men then tried to convince her to donate money to
an unrelated charity. It was then that she remembered
an email that had been sent out to the dorm list about
unidentified men trying to get residents to buy maga
zines.
"There had already been an email to the dorm about
possible magazine scammers, but it didn't register at
first," the resident said. "I checked it again as they were
talking to me."
Other residents approached by the magazine solici
tors gave similar accounts of their interaction. Megan Li
'08 had read the warnings of the possible scammers
before they approached her. and she tried several times
to get them to leave her room. When she refused to pur
chase any magazines, the men claimed that her neighbor
had donated a book to a children's hospital instead of

buying a magazine. Li later learned that her neighbor
had refused them as well.
"After about a good five to 10 minutes of refusal, they
finally left — after asking for my phone number and if 1
had a boyfriend," Li said in an email to The Daily. "At
the same time they left, someone on the Kimball email
list said that there were cops on the third floor looking
for these guys, so I sent back a response that the scam
mers had just left my room."
After approaching numerous residents on more than
one floor of Kimball, a staff member, who had been
