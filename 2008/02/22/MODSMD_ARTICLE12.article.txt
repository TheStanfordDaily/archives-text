# STUDENT GROUPS
## Crowds gather as Tree Week stunts continue 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Candidates campaigning to be next
year's Tree put on new round of stunts
and skits yesterday afternoon in White
Plaza.
The two main spectacles were led by
candidates Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09
and Forrest White '10. Fortune painted a
canvas with his head while hanging
upside from a tree, and White put on a

Star Wars-themed skit while being hit by
paintballs.
"All were novel," said Brandon
Farwell '08, a friend of White's, "but I'll
give [White] the win on the day. It's good
to see [him] get pummeled with pellets."
White, who ran for Tree last year as
well, stalked onto the lawn in White Plaza
clad only in a robe and his underwear,
accompanied by a similarly dressed

with his head in White Plaza on Thursday. Students helped him re-dip his head in paint.

Forrest White '10, a Tree candidate, performed a Star Wars-themed skit while being pelted
with paintballs as part of his stunt Thursday afternoon in White Plaza. White, who also ran for
Tree last year, performed a similar stunt then.
friend. The friend — playing the
role of Obi Wan Kenobi — insisted
on instructing White — playing the
role of Luke Skywalker —on the
uses of the force and proceeded to
nail White with a paintball gun.
"1 think Forrest [White] was just
beginning to feel the force," said
Adam Knepp "08. "It would have
been interesting to see how things
played out if Chewbacca hadn't
intervened."
White carried out a similar,
paintball-related event during last
year's Tree Week with current Tree
John Whipple "10.
"I just felt like doing something a
little old school to remind
[Whipple] of our running days,"
White said.
"I just want to run a playful,
funny campaign," he added. "[l'm]
just trying to make people smile.
That's my aim."
Fortune, on the other hand, took
a slightly messier approach to
today's events. Suspended by a rope
attached to his feet in a tree.
Fortune secured a mop to his head
and, dipping his head in buckets of
green, red and white paint, had
friends and spectators swing him
against a canvas. Spray-painted
across the canvas was the slogan
"Biggie Bangin' Bitches from BBQs
to Bar Mitzvahs."
The idea was inspired by a for
mer tree, and Fortune called it a
"throwback to olden times."
Alex Rich *10, a friend of

Fortune's, arrived when Fortune
"was already hanging and swing
ing."
"I like that it was related to the
tree in that he was in a tree and used
green paint, very tree-esque," Rich
said.
Fortune largely relied on other
people to re-dip his head in the
paint buckets and then swing him
into the canvas.
"I enjoyed [the event] a lot, but
the spinning made it difficult to get
the paint going," he said.
"The canvas looks good,"
Fortune added. "I think the colors
kind of blended well. It will make a
good piece hanging outside of
Whipple's room."
It took four separate shampoo
cycles to get the paint out of his
hair.
"I'm excited for the week,"
Fortune said. "I'm hoping every
body's going to bring it."
Jack Cackler '09 — known for
his stunts earlier in the week such as
eating a snake, running into fluores
cent light bulbs and drinking water
from the Claw — performed a sepa
rate charity fundraiser while the
other two stunts were taking place.
"Because of the publicity gener
ated by the earlier events," he said,
"I was able to hold a fundraiser that
raised some money for Colleges
Against Cancer. FACE AIDS and
Camp Kesem."
For every cash donation of a dol
lar or more made to one of the char
ities, Cackler ran a lap around
White Plaza. In total, he ran 46 laps
to raise $71.97.
