# STUDENT GROUPS
## Crowds gather as Tree Week stunts continue 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Candidates campaigning to be next
year's Tree put on new round of stunts
and skits yesterday afternoon in White
Plaza.
The two main spectacles were led by
candidates Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09
and Forrest White '10. Fortune painted a
canvas with his head while hanging
upside from a tree, and White put on a

Star Wars-themed skit while being hit by
paintballs.
"All were novel," said Brandon
Farwell '08, a friend of White's, "but I'll
give [White] the win on the day. It's good
to see [him] get pummeled with pellets."
White, who ran for Tree last year as
well, stalked onto the lawn in White Plaza
clad only in a robe and his underwear,
accompanied by a similarly dressed
