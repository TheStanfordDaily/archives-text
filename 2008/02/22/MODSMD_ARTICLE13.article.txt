## Faculty Senate looks at graduate diversity 
### BEN EPPLER STAFF WRITER 
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences Richard Sailer painted a bleak
picture of low minority representation in
University graduate programs in a presen
tation to the Faculty Senate yesterday
afternoon.
During the last academic year. Sailer
said, the School of Humanities and
Sciences matriculated 16 underrepresent
ed minority graduate students — African
Americans, American Indians and
Hispanics — out of an incoming cohort
of about 300.1 le displayed a graph of the
matriculation of such students, which indi
cated a decline from highs in the 20's and
30's during the late 1980's and early 1990 s
to the teens last year.
"At the graduate level, we're not very
diverse in terms of our domestic student
population," Sailer said.
Sailer's presentation on the state of the
School of Humanities and Sciences was
the highlight of the hour-and-a-half meet
ing of the fortieth Faculty Senate. The new
Dean, who noted that he arrived at
Stanford from the University of Chicago
eleven months ago yesterday, was mostly
upbeat about the School.
"I don't think there's any doubt about
the quality of the arts and sciences here."
Sailer said, pointing out that, of the ten
graduate student departments ranked by
U.S. News and World Report. Stanford
holds top-five positions in nine — includ
ing number one positions in biology,
chemistry, physics and psychology.
Despite this success, he said, "We know
that Humanities and Sciences has gaps
and areas of unevenness."
Graduate programs in the school were
one such area where Sailer called for
improvement.
"If we're trying to train the next gener
ation of the best researchers and teachers
in the world," he said,"then this is the way
we do it."
The decline in the numbers of graduate
students. Sailer said, has not been limited
to underrepresented minorities. The num
ber of matriculating graduate students in
the humanities declined from 115 in 1987-
88 to 76 in 2006-07.
The declining numbers of graduate stu
dents in some departments means that it is
more difficult for budding scholars to
reach a "critical mass" of intellectual fer
ment. he noted.
To improve the graduate program.
Sailer reported that his office was working
to increase the number of graduate stu
dents by 125 in the next five years — an
increase of 25 additional students per
year. About half of new graduate fellow
ships will hopefully go to underrepresent
ed minorities, he said.
Sailer also called for targeted faculty
increases in certain academic areas,
notably South Asian and Islamic studies.
"For historical reasons, Stanford is
kind of a Eurocentric university," he said.
"For the twenty-first century, that doesn't

seem like the right balance."
Despite the fact that Stanford possess
es an endowment valued at about $18 bil
lion. according to the Web site of the
Stanford Management Company, the
Dean explained the need for careful shep
herding of the University's resources.
"I do think we have to maintain our
focus — even though Stanford is a rich
university, we're up against super-rich uni
versities," Sailer said. "We feel that in
some of the competition."
Senators further discussed the Senate's
response to the new financial aid plan.
"This is quite a wonderful thing, and
I'm sure our current students and maybe
their parents are delighted with the news,"
said Biology Prof. Robert Simoni.
But the fate of graduate students also
played into the discussion of the new aid
package. Simoni said the change under
scored the need to increase funding for
graduate students, who he called "the
bedrock of our research enterprise."
Uennessy agreed that graduate fund
ing remained a major issue, especially with
a decline in federal research funding that
led to the announcement of 225 layoffs
from the Stanford Linear Accelerator ear
lier this year.
"I'm worried this is not a short-term
problem," Uennessy said. "I'm worried we
will see limited growth in the federal
research budget given the overall pres
sure."
With federal research spending limit
ed. the President said that Stanford would
need to explore more fundraising for
graduate programs. But fundraising for
graduate programs poses its own set of
problems.
"We don't have as natural a con
stituency as we do for undergraduate
fundraising." he said.
The Faculty Senate also unanimously
approved a measure allowing for experi
mentation in the freshman Introduction
to the Humanities (IHUM) program
beginning next academic year.
The measure, which was enacted by
voice vote, will allow faculty to propose
I HUM courses "whose structure may
exhibit a different form than prescribed in
the IHUM Legislation." Experimentation
will be allowed for the next three years
and response to the altered courses will be
monitored by the IHUM governance
board.
According to a memorandum distrib
uted to Senators by I lester Gelber, chair
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy, the experimentation
should not deviate from the basic objec
tives of the IHUM program. Care should
also be taken, the memo said, to maintain
"the sense of the common Freshman
experience that students value,"
Students participating in the experi
mental I HUM courses will receive the
same Area One credit as students taking
traditional programs.

exhibit a different form than prescribed in
the IHUM Legislation." Experimentation
will be allowed for the next three years
and response to the altered courses will be
monitored by the IHUM governance
board.
According to a memorandum distrib
uted to Senators by I lester Gelber, chair
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy, the experimentation
should not deviate from the basic objec
tives of the IHUM program. Care should
also be taken, the memo said, to maintain
"the sense of the common Freshman
experience that students value,"
Students participating in the experi
mental I HUM courses will receive the
same Area One credit as students taking
traditional programs.
