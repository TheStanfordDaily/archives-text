# STUDENT GROUPS
## Glitch erases special fees information 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES MANAGING EDITOR 
Student groups petitioning to be on the ASSU spe
cial fees ballot suffered a setback early yesterday
morning. A glitch with the petitioning Web site over
the past couple days invalidated hundreds of signa
tures. sending groups back to square one before the
Mar. 7 deadline.
Elections Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10
emailed the nine groups then petitioning for special
fees at 1:14 a.m. with the message that the commission
was "forced to close the petition ... until further
notice" and when reopened "[the Elections
Commission] will have to ask each petitioning group
to restart their petition."
Woessner later explained that numerous signa
tures accumulated over the previous two days were
completed without a working link to the budget
breakdown for each group applying.
While individual petition sites state the dollar
amount requested by a group, according to the ASSU
constitution by-laws, "the information pages in each
petition shall contain ... the detailed budget for the
organization submitted for the following fiscal year."
"The Elections Commission and the ASSU are
very sorry for any inconvenience that this error has
caused" Woessner told Hie Daily, noting that the
petition sites are expected to be back online today.
"The error was due to a miscommunication between
groups involved, and we're doing our best to fix the
problem."
According to Woessner. he was first notified about
problems with the petitioning sites by various stu
dents on Wednesday afternoon. Links for the peti
tioning sites had been sent to each group's financial
officer for publicity on Tuesday night: soon after, stu
dents noticed that the budget links for many groups
were broken.
"It's not a perfect system." Woessner said. "Once it
was obvious that multiple budgets were not available.
1 decided to shut down the process."
Student groups expressed disappointment over
the invalidation of hundreds of signatures. Leland
Quarterly had nearly 150 signatures out of 663
required: the Bridge Peer Counseling Group had 322
out of KXX); and Stanford Journal of International
Relations (SJIR) had nearly 200 out of 726. according
to group representatives.
Stanford News Readership Program (SNRP),
Volunteers in Latin America (VILA). Alternative
Spring Break (ASB). Stanford Comedy Club. Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and Stanford
in Government (SIG) were also affected.
"First of all. it's just shocking that this all hap
pened." said Nick Hoy '08, editor in chief of Leland
Quarterly. "Second, it's shocking that the ASSU's
solution is for student groups to start over again."
While group officials understand that Woessner
stood by constitutional bylaws in his decision, many
questioned the effectiveness and fairness of such
rules.
"1 don't really think having the budget makes or
breaks someone's signature," said Tommy Tobin '10,
financial officer for SJ IR. "I understand that it's part
of the constitution, but once people get to the site, it's
highly likely that they will sign anyway."
"The difficulty lies in getting people to the site."
Tobin added, "and often groups will include in their
emails information pertaining to their group or pro
vide links explaining why they should receive special
fees."
Aaron Qayumi '09. president of SNRP. also had
difficulty grasping the importance of students viewing
a budget. Even if the budget is available, few are like
ly to peruse it simply for petitioning, he said.
"People can already see the total amount we're
requesting, and there's lots of time before the actual
election for people to look at the budget."he said. "1
do see how there's a problem, but I don't see how it's
enough to throw out all those signatures."
Laurence Moore '08, financial officer for the
Bridge, added that the presence of an "amount
requested" sufficiently informed students of their
potential student fees liability. In addition, the fact
that so many students signed the petitions without an
available budget "obviously showed they're willing to
pay the money."
Ilie decision to invalidate signatures was further
complicated because many students likely did sign
petitions with working budget links. According to
Woessner, however, "there's just no way of differenti
ating the signatures ot people who were able to view
the budget."
1 le added that were the signatures counted, the
Elections Commission would be liable to a suit. He
was unable to cite a case similar to this situation —
and Hoy and Tobin expressed doubt that a suit would
occur over something like this — but Woessner said
there has been a history of suits against the commis
sion.
Student groups also took issue that a technical
glitch occurred with a site long in development.
"I'm surprised by this," Moore said. "They've had
about five months now to set up and test this site.
We've all written a paper and forgotten to save it, so
I'm somewhat understanding of technical glitches on
the part of the Elections Commission, but this is still a
big deal. For us. it's a whole year of funding on the
line."
According to Woessner. the special fees petition
ing site was developed by Stanford Student
Enterprises' Internet Solutions group. He said that
the site had been tested "on and off late last quarter
and at the beginning of this quarter.
Before sending out the petition
links to groups. Woessner himself also
checked that each page was fully
functioning. He added that miscom
munication between last year's and
this year's site developers contributed
to issues with the system and the lack
of a rapid fix over the past few days
before all the sites had to be shut
down.
With the sites expected to reopen
today, groups will have to restart their
efforts to rally members and reach
out to students for their signatures.
Woessner said that all students who
signed a petition and submitted a
valid email address will be officially
contacted by the ASSU and asked to
sign again, but group officials
expressed concern over potential con
fusion and a small return rate.
"Even if we explain the situation
to people when we send out another
email, we're going to lose a significant
number of people because of the
ASSU's debacle." Hoy said. He noted
that."the electronic petition is already
an onus on small groups like ours," as
email spamming is not as successful as
the paper petitioning of past years.
The daunting prospect of reclaim
ing signatures and garnering new
ones within the next two weeks led
groups to suggest further solutions,
including a reduction in the number
of signatures required by each group
as well as an extension of the Mar. 7
deadline to compensate for lost time.
Woessner said that the Elections
Commission did not guarantee
groups a set amount of time for peti
tioning— just a deadline — so he is
reluctant to consider an extension.
Extra days would mean more email
spam for the general student body,
and Woessner said he believes that
groups should be able to overcome
any confusion and have enough time
to collect all the necessary signatures.
Woessner added that noon today is
the official deadline for groups to
apply for petitioning, and the two
weeks of petitioning left are still more
than afforded in past years.
"It's not that we don't want to
work with groups," Woessner said of
the Elections Commission's decision
over the process. "It's that we want to
make sure things happen right."
Still, groups said that they hoped
there would be more understanding

from the ASSU, as well as greater
recognition of the effort put in by the
groups.
"Because the problem originated
on their part, I would hope they
would be more lenient and under
standing and help compensate for the
loss," Qayumi said."l understand a lot
of hard work is involved with this and
[the Elections Commission] puts in a
lot of hours — this is really regretful
for all of us. I just hope we can work
something out that makes more sense
from the student group perspective."
Like other student groups, though.
Hoy recognized that these concerns
now take a back seat to moving on
and collecting valid signatures.
"We don't have a choice," he said.
"We need to get signatures, we need
to get on the ballot and we need to get
approved."

over the process. "It's that we want to
make sure things happen right."
Still, groups said that they hoped
there would be more understanding

from the ASSU, as well as greater
recognition of the effort put in by the
groups.
"Because the problem originated
on their part, I would hope they
would be more lenient and under
standing and help compensate for the
loss," Qayumi said."l understand a lot
of hard work is involved with this and
[the Elections Commission] puts in a
lot of hours — this is really regretful
for all of us. I just hope we can work
something out that makes more sense
from the student group perspective."
Like other student groups, though.
Hoy recognized that these concerns
now take a back seat to moving on
and collecting valid signatures.
"We don't have a choice," he said.
"We need to get signatures, we need
to get on the ballot and we need to get
approved."

Student groups petitioning to be on the ASSU spe
cial fees ballot suffered a setback early yesterday
morning. A glitch with the petitioning Web site over
the past couple days invalidated hundreds of signa
tures. sending groups back to square one before the
Mar. 7 deadline.
Elections Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10
emailed the nine groups then petitioning for special
fees at 1:14 a.m. with the message that the commission
was "forced to close the petition ... until further
notice" and when reopened "[the Elections
Commission] will have to ask each petitioning group
to restart their petition."
Woessner later explained that numerous signa
tures accumulated over the previous two days were
completed without a working link to the budget
breakdown for each group applying.
While individual petition sites state the dollar
amount requested by a group, according to the ASSU
constitution by-laws, "the information pages in each
petition shall contain ... the detailed budget for the
organization submitted for the following fiscal year."
"The Elections Commission and the ASSU are
very sorry for any inconvenience that this error has
caused" Woessner told Hie Daily, noting that the
petition sites are expected to be back online today.
"The error was due to a miscommunication between
groups involved, and we're doing our best to fix the
problem."
According to Woessner. he was first notified about
problems with the petitioning sites by various stu
dents on Wednesday afternoon. Links for the peti
tioning sites had been sent to each group's financial
officer for publicity on Tuesday night: soon after, stu
dents noticed that the budget links for many groups
were broken.
"It's not a perfect system." Woessner said. "Once it
was obvious that multiple budgets were not available.
1 decided to shut down the process."
Student groups expressed disappointment over
the invalidation of hundreds of signatures. Leland
Quarterly had nearly 150 signatures out of 663
required: the Bridge Peer Counseling Group had 322
out of KXX); and Stanford Journal of International
Relations (SJIR) had nearly 200 out of 726. according
to group representatives.
Stanford News Readership Program (SNRP),
Volunteers in Latin America (VILA). Alternative
Spring Break (ASB). Stanford Comedy Club. Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and Stanford
in Government (SIG) were also affected.
"First of all. it's just shocking that this all hap
pened." said Nick Hoy '08, editor in chief of Leland
Quarterly. "Second, it's shocking that the ASSU's
solution is for student groups to start over again."
While group officials understand that Woessner
stood by constitutional bylaws in his decision, many
questioned the effectiveness and fairness of such
rules.
"1 don't really think having the budget makes or
breaks someone's signature," said Tommy Tobin '10,
financial officer for SJ IR. "I understand that it's part
of the constitution, but once people get to the site, it's
highly likely that they will sign anyway."
"The difficulty lies in getting people to the site."
Tobin added, "and often groups will include in their
emails information pertaining to their group or pro
vide links explaining why they should receive special
fees."
Aaron Qayumi '09. president of SNRP. also had
difficulty grasping the importance of students viewing
a budget. Even if the budget is available, few are like
ly to peruse it simply for petitioning, he said.
"People can already see the total amount we're
requesting, and there's lots of time before the actual
election for people to look at the budget."he said. "1
do see how there's a problem, but I don't see how it's
enough to throw out all those signatures."
Laurence Moore '08, financial officer for the
Bridge, added that the presence of an "amount
requested" sufficiently informed students of their
potential student fees liability. In addition, the fact
that so many students signed the petitions without an
available budget "obviously showed they're willing to
pay the money."
Ilie decision to invalidate signatures was further
complicated because many students likely did sign
petitions with working budget links. According to
Woessner, however, "there's just no way of differenti
ating the signatures ot people who were able to view
the budget."
1 le added that were the signatures counted, the
Elections Commission would be liable to a suit. He
was unable to cite a case similar to this situation —
and Hoy and Tobin expressed doubt that a suit would
occur over something like this — but Woessner said
there has been a history of suits against the commis
sion.
Student groups also took issue that a technical
glitch occurred with a site long in development.
"I'm surprised by this," Moore said. "They've had
about five months now to set up and test this site.
We've all written a paper and forgotten to save it, so
I'm somewhat understanding of technical glitches on
the part of the Elections Commission, but this is still a
big deal. For us. it's a whole year of funding on the
line."
According to Woessner. the special fees petition
ing site was developed by Stanford Student
Enterprises' Internet Solutions group. He said that
the site had been tested "on and off late last quarter
and at the beginning of this quarter.
Before sending out the petition
links to groups. Woessner himself also
checked that each page was fully
functioning. He added that miscom
munication between last year's and
this year's site developers contributed
to issues with the system and the lack
of a rapid fix over the past few days
before all the sites had to be shut
down.
With the sites expected to reopen
today, groups will have to restart their
efforts to rally members and reach
out to students for their signatures.
Woessner said that all students who
signed a petition and submitted a
valid email address will be officially
contacted by the ASSU and asked to
sign again, but group officials
expressed concern over potential con
fusion and a small return rate.
"Even if we explain the situation
to people when we send out another
email, we're going to lose a significant
number of people because of the
ASSU's debacle." Hoy said. He noted
that."the electronic petition is already
an onus on small groups like ours," as
email spamming is not as successful as
the paper petitioning of past years.
The daunting prospect of reclaim
ing signatures and garnering new
ones within the next two weeks led
groups to suggest further solutions,
including a reduction in the number
of signatures required by each group
as well as an extension of the Mar. 7
deadline to compensate for lost time.
Woessner said that the Elections
Commission did not guarantee
groups a set amount of time for peti
tioning— just a deadline — so he is
reluctant to consider an extension.
Extra days would mean more email
spam for the general student body,
and Woessner said he believes that
groups should be able to overcome
any confusion and have enough time
to collect all the necessary signatures.
Woessner added that noon today is
the official deadline for groups to
apply for petitioning, and the two
weeks of petitioning left are still more
than afforded in past years.
"It's not that we don't want to
work with groups," Woessner said of
the Elections Commission's decision
over the process. "It's that we want to
make sure things happen right."
Still, groups said that they hoped
