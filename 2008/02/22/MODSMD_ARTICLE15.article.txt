## Scholars speak on influence of Beatles Researchers examine band's tremendous legacy 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
A crowd of spectators packed
Kresge Auditorium yesterday
evening to relive the I%o's through
conversation about a band that cre
ated "the best music ever."
McGill University Psychology
Prof. Daniel Levitin, UMass-
Amherst English Prof. Nick Bromell
and moderator Stanford Associate
Music Prof. Jonathan Berger — all
three Stanford-educated scholars
who have dedicated time to
researching the Beatles — spoke
about the influence of the band.
"Beyond just the quality of voice
and production, there is something
inherently unique in everything they
sing," said Berger. Co-director of the
Stanford Initiative on Creativity and
the Arts.
The event was organized by the
Aurora Forum and was co-spon
sored with the Stanford Humanities
Center. Enthusiastic Stanford par
ents on campus for Parent's
Weekend formed a large majority of
the audience, reliving their youth of

growing up with the Beatles.
"Asking someone to name a sin
gle great Beatles song is simply a
wrong question," Levitin said. "The
sheer breadth that encompasses
Beatles songs is what makes them
special. The Beatles were constantly
pushing at boundaries of their space
and didn't allow themselves to be
defined by any musical constraints.
"It is because so many present
day musicians are trying to subtly
imitate their style that they have
transcended time and are loved so
much even today," he continued.
But Bromell had a slightly differ
ent opinion about the relevance of
Beatles music today.
"Music is inseparable from its
cultural context; we therefore need
to go back to the 60s to recover
their true meaning." he said.
"However, 1 also believe that the
60's aren't over yet; the 60's are here
in the sense that cultural wars are
continuing, which is the medium
through which the Beatles can live
on today."
The speakers proposed that the
era of political and cultural turmoil
had a major emphasis on Beatles
songs.
"The 60's were a schism in
American history that still hasn't
healed," Bromell said. "The Beatles

lasting appeal of the band's music
American culture, both in the 1 960's
incorporated this cultural setting
into their long, chaotic, eclectic
album and thus managed to induct
their audience into their world."
"Songs like Blackbird were
metaphors for racial inequality and
the hopeful rise of African
Americans," Levitin added. "The
Beatles were conscious of what was
going on and put together meaning
in their songs but address[ed] press
ing issues metaphorically to convey
a larger idea."
The speakers also commended
the Beatles' commitment to musical
ability and technology as "outstand
ing."

the significance of the Beatles before
torium. The researchers pointed to the
and the impact the group had on
and the present day.
"Their ideas in music far sur
passed their abilities as musicians
and [were] much larger than any
physical medium they could be
expressed through." Levitin said.
"They would squeeze five ideas into
one song when other bands would
have been stingy and written five
separate songs out of it."
"From a technological point of
view, their quality of sounds stood
above most others, as they created
music in a way that one could hear
and appreciate and love no matter
what medium one heard it though,"

he added.
Aria Florant '10, member of the
campus a cappella group Mixed
Company, enjoyed the forum.
"The talk was extremely interest
ing, hut there wasn't enough time to
explore in detail the implications of
a racially charged 60' s era on
Beatles' music," she said.- "I would
have liked the speakers to expand
more on the influence of social and

cultural happenings on their songs."
Zack Wettstein '11 was surprised
by the low student attendance at the
event.
"There is such an immense
potential to explore the Beatles
because there is so much about
them that is applicable to music of
today as well as of the future," he
said. "The fact that this talk is taking
place on our campus is great,
although it would have been nice to
see a larger student participation in
the event."
