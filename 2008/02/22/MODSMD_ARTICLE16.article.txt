## Editorial Board Rethinking 'Tree Week' 
### 
The arrival of February signals yet an
other wild and wacky annual Stanford
tradition: Tree Week. After the Dollie
selection, the LSJUMB turns its attention
toward picking the Stanford student who
will become the Cardinal's unofficial mascot
for an entire year. What may come as a trou
bling surprise to outsiders, however, is the
unusual audition process for becoming the
Stanford Tree.
"The fact of the matter is that Trees love
Stanford more than they respect their bod
ies," said then-senior Dan Bentley, a Band
press representative, in a 2004 Daily article
on Tree Week ["Students Try Out to be
Tree"]. "The sign of a true Tree is the ability
to commit sin against self... and physics."
This doctrine of physical sacrifice has been
manifested over the years in eye-popping
skydiving expeditions, self-amputations in
White Plaza and other stunts too varied to
catalogue here. The Tree selection process,
however, has come under new scrutiny in
light of this Tuesday's bloody Tree stunt in
White Plaza, and we think Tree Week is ripe
for re-examination.
Jack Cackler '09 was struck by nine friends
with long fluorescent light bulbs and
achieved instant notoriety on campus with
the publication of a picture showing his
blood-smeared chest on the front of Wednes
day's Daily. Generally, in the world of Tree
Week, exposure is always a good thing and
presumably makes Cackler the front-runner
for the upcoming selection. Current Tree
John Whipple' 10 was quoted in The Daily on
Wednesday as encouraging "not only gutsy,
painful things,but alsocreative"stuntsin light
of the incident — this from a Tree who re
ceived a dry-ice branding in White Plaza dur
ing his candidacy.
Proponents of this hair-raising selection
process say it weeds out all but the most seri
ous, dedicated candidates. If the Tree's role,
however, were to leap through hoops of fire
or swallow live animals during halftime
shows in Maples, perhaps Tree Week would

make more immediate sense. But as things
stand, the Tree's job is to create enthusiasm at
sporting events, and to dance during stop
pages in play. Given the erratic record of re
cent Trees on these two fronts, it seems wise to
introduce a practical element into the selec
tion process.
What if, instead of a series of dangerous
stunts, rumored backroom deals and the brib
ing of Dollies — all elements that character
ize the darker side of Tree Week — our mas
cot selection had more to do with the skills
candidates perform upon being selected?
Whipple's suggestions for more creativity
and ingenuity are a step in the right direction.
The band should highly encourage Tree Week
to evolve into a tradition encompassing both
creative demonstrations of school spirit and a
showcase of the performance abilities a can
didate will bring to the job for which he or she
is actually auditioning.
Ultimately, the wildness of Tree Week is a
recipe for trouble. Imagine the uproar if
something went tremendously wrong during
a stunt, this week or in the future? Although
candidates are free to do whatever they
please and are responsible for their own safe
ty during stunts, a tragedy during Tree Week
would reflect extremely poorly on the
LSJUMB and the University as a whole.
With the news that the band has decided
to remove Cackler from the running for Tree,
some may consider the problem solved. But
this may be a case of blaming the victim: the
ambiguous expectations for the Tree Week
campaign are only encouraging this type of
behavior. Some fundamental change in the
nature of the contest — not merely disquali
fying a candidate who crosses a very fuzzy
line — is the key to fixing Tree Week.
Certainly there will be some who resist
any type of change in the Tree selection
process and assert the LSJUMB's right to be
as wacky as possible. But the gory display in
White Plaza this week seems less and less rel
evant to being Tree and more and more rele
vant to making a scene — at any cost.
