## Let's grow tails! 
### 
Over the weekend, my friends and 1 got
onto the subject of vestigial body parts.
My friend Simon became particularly
entranced with the thought of our tailbones
growing out tails again. "I think it would be
pretty cool if we did have tails," Simon said.
"Then, on dates, we'd be able to hold tails." It's
a cute idea.
Hell, try to think of an animal species with
out a tail. It can make a human feel quite left out
to be the one of the few species without one. I
wonder if we would feel more camaraderie
with our animal friends if we had tails like
them.
What kind of tails would we have? Long,
substantial tails, like kangaroos? Or slim, sexy
tails, like stingrays? Maybe guys would want to
grow the former and girls the latter. Or maybe
we would all get stuck with little, curly, pig-like
tails. Would our tails be fleshy like the rest of
our skin, or furry like Zidane, the Final Fanta
sy character. I personally vote that our tails
l<H)k like a really big index finger.
We should think about the abilities our
tails will have. Can we hang off branches or
fight with our tails? Can we wrap them around
ourselves? What if we want to escape from en
emiesâ€” can we leave our tails behind and
grow new ones, like lizards? Or will our tails
be more decorative than functional?
Just imagine our current world with tails.
First of all. where the hell would we put them?
I'm assuming we would have "tail sleeves,"
right above our asses. Or maybe our sense of
propriety would be different,and we would just
bare our tails along with our asses, using thongs
to cover the rest of our junk. How about the
general act of sitting and lying down, would we
accommodate the tails with things like tail rests
or just situate ourselves in tail-friendly posi
tions?

We would probably decorate our tails with
jewelry, paint or tattoos, and for sure we would
use plastic surgery to enhance tail beauty. As
sassinations via poison-tipped tails would be
the ninja move of choice.
Tails would raise a host of new issues for
males, due to tails' similarities to the other
male appendage. Would assumptions be made
on the length of one's "front tail" by the length
of the back one? Lord knows that "EN
LARGE YOUR TAIL" messages would fill
our spam boxes. Would we get our tails circum
cised? Would our tails do funny things when
we became aroused? Boys would probably
scope out female tails, and I bet girls would do
the reverse. But the bigger question is, would
you be classified as an "ass, legs and tail" man,
or would tails have to compete separately
against the other notable parts of the female
body?
Yes, we would do a lot of things with our
tails, from facilitating romance to tail-wrestling
to using them as bait for fishing. Perhaps with
our ever-increasing knowledge of biotechnol
ogy, one day we'll stick it to natural selection
and genetically engineer our tails back into
their rightful place. But let's all decide now
what kind of tail we want before a few unfash
ionable biologists choose for us.
