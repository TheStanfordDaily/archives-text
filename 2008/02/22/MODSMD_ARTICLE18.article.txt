Stunts ill-advised in hindsight
To the editor,
I have been very touched in the last few
days by both the overwhelming support
and the concern I have received from the
Stanford community ["White Plaza Tree
stunt takes a bloody turn," Feb. 20], This
week has been one of the most exciting
weeks of my life, and I would like to clarify
a few things. First, I would like to use this
opportunity to reassure everyone that I am
well and took appropriate precautions be
fore and after every stunt I have performed
(and that the picture of me bleeding after
the light bulb stunt looked much worse
than it really was). I also think that in hind
sight that stunt in particular was ill-ad
vised. if only because I misjudged how it

might look, and I am truly sorry for that.
Additionally, 1 have performed each stunt
out of my own volition.
While extreme stunts can be fun to
watch (as long as they don't cross a line),
they do not fundamentally represent what
the Tree stands for. While 1 intended to
show my willingness to go above and be
yond the call of duty, 1 had also planned on
demonstrating how 1 would serve the Stan
ford community. For example, yesterday
the student body helped me raise money
for three charitable organizations on cam
pus as I ran laps around White Plaza.
Through the course of this week, I have
been given the opportunity to help those
less fortunate, have some fun — and learn
a few things. Here I stand, and can do no
other. Go Cardinal!

You're not clever: on ode to
condescending skeptics
To the editor,
Rahul Kanakia's main virtue is
his height. It allows him to look down
upon and boldly judge the people
around him without the slightest un
derstanding of their circumstances.
In his piece, ["You're Not Special:
An Ode to Hennessy," Feb. 20]
Kanakia arrogantly criticizes stu
dent activists for failing to take ade
quate risks for the causes they be
lieve in. Unfortunately this article
lacks real content and just adds to
the litany of anti-activism, privileged
nonsense that passes for discourse

on this campus.
A student with the most minimal
activism experience is aware of
Hennessy's habit of making false
promises, passing responsibility on
to ditsy university bureaucrats and
waiting the issues out. Yes, it is ex
tremely difficult to build institution
al knowledge in an organization
with a four-year turn-over rate. Yes.
we know that the University is moti
vated by money. Of course, the most
effective political actions are ones
that are expensive to the University.
And, yes, the DSP is essential to the
Sweat-Free campaign. Though
banal, Kanakia's insights are true.
His ignorance shines through
when he begins to comment on the
motivations of student activists. As a
participant in SLAC's fast and
Sweat-Free's sit-in last spring. 1
don't know one student activist who
thought his/her actions would in
stantly change the world. We are in
telligent people who go to the same
elite university as the prodigy
Kanakia, take the same history
classes and share an informed per
spective on history. Perhaps it is

Kanakia who needs the history les
son. To suggest that students must
flee to Canada or be clubbed by riot
police to be taken seriously is ahis
toric at best. Movements are not just
built on extreme sacrifice but on
measured planning, continual strug
gle and occasional failure.
Why should Stanford students
care about workers? Let me make
it plain: Much like the African
AIDS patients we love to wear a
ribbon for or the Latin American
orphans we are dying to save, cam
pus workers are human beings.That
may be easy to forget as we nearly
run over groundskeepers with our
bikes on our way to class. But 1
shouldn't have to explain that pre
school concept.
1 know I'm not going to save the
world. I just understand that my
cushy life at Stanford is facilitated
by a fleet of workers who often lack
fair wages, benefits and representa
tion. I refuse to quietly comply —
even for my short stay at this insti
tution — with their mistreatment.
Acknowledging my own limitations
as a student, 1 am proud of my cam

pus activism experiences, even it
they were not always the most
strategic. Kanakia is welcome to
criticize my actions so long as 1 may
condemn him and his ilk for their
jaded inaction.
