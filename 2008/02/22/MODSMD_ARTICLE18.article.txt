Stunts ill-advised in hindsight
To the editor,
I have been very touched in the last few
days by both the overwhelming support
and the concern I have received from the
Stanford community ["White Plaza Tree
stunt takes a bloody turn," Feb. 20], This
week has been one of the most exciting
weeks of my life, and I would like to clarify
a few things. First, I would like to use this
opportunity to reassure everyone that I am
well and took appropriate precautions be
fore and after every stunt I have performed
(and that the picture of me bleeding after
the light bulb stunt looked much worse
than it really was). I also think that in hind
sight that stunt in particular was ill-ad
vised. if only because I misjudged how it

might look, and I am truly sorry for that.
Additionally, 1 have performed each stunt
out of my own volition.
While extreme stunts can be fun to
watch (as long as they don't cross a line),
they do not fundamentally represent what
the Tree stands for. While 1 intended to
show my willingness to go above and be
yond the call of duty, 1 had also planned on
demonstrating how 1 would serve the Stan
ford community. For example, yesterday
the student body helped me raise money
for three charitable organizations on cam
pus as I ran laps around White Plaza.
Through the course of this week, I have
been given the opportunity to help those
less fortunate, have some fun â€” and learn
a few things. Here I stand, and can do no
