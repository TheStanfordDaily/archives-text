# CARDINAL RULE
## No. 9 Stanford goes for Cal sweep at home 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Give Cal basketball credit for clawing tooth and nail
with Stanford the past few seasons.The Cardinal has been
the stronger program over the last decade, is far-better
known outside the Bay Area, and — as many Cal fans
would say — has a better coach, as Bear head coach Ben
Braun is none too popular in Berkeley.
But, if recent history is any guide, none of that will mat
ter much when these two rivals tip-off Sunday at 6 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. Last year, No.9 Stanford (21-4,10-3) han
dled Cal (15-9, 6-7) l X)-71 in Berkeley, but lost 67-63 at
home. The year before, each team won at home. Stanford
by 14 and Cal by three. The season before that, 2004-05,
Stanford won both games, but lost guard Dan Grunfeld
for the season on an ACL tear, as he fouled from behind
on a fast break in the home game. He was never the same
player in his remaining 16 months at Stanford.
"With Cal,they always play us tough and we had to re
ally pull through last year in the stretch," junior forward
Lawrence Hill said.
The teams' last contest also came down to the final
minutes four weeks ago in Berkeley. Stanford came out on
top, 82-77, with sophomore centers Brook and Robin
Lopez leading the way with 23 points and 14 rebounds, re
spectively.
Cal outplayed the Cardinal on the perimeter. Five
Bears reached double figures, many on outside shooting
and quick drives to the hoop, and the Bears outshot Stan
ford 47 percent to 41 percent. But Stanford was too much

down low. with 21 offensive rebounds.24 made free throws
and 24 points in the paint. ,
Expect Stanford to pound it inside and attempt to ex
ploit its advantage in the post once again.The key match
ups then involve four players with bright futures at the

next level: the Lopez twins against
Cal's Ryan Anderson (22 points, 10
rebounds per game) and DeVon
Hardin (10 points, 8 rebounds per
game). Head coach Trent Johnson
won't say it. but again, if recent histo
ry's any judge, Stanford's duo should
have the upper hand.
"The biggest thing with [Ander
son] is our matchup ability to be tall
and quick, with the twins and other
guys that can guard him," said Hill of
the player he and Johnson called Cal's
best. "He's really good at taking it to a
big, slower guy: he just uses his athleti
cism and feel for the game. And then
out on the wing. Robin's done a real
ly good job of staying with him as op
posed to falling asleep because he's
only used to only guarding guys to the
free throw line."
Cal. meanwhile, will look to run it
with forward Patrick Christopher and

GAME NOTES; Stanford, currently a gome and a^l*
half out of first place in the Pac-10, looks to keep
pace with conference-leading UCLA. The Cardi -
nal will most likely be led by Brook Lopez, who
had 23 points in the team's 82-77 win at Cat
last month. Stanford (21 -4, 10-3 Pac-10) is cur
rently ranked No. 9 in the nation.

The Stanford Daily
Cal always puts up a
fight against their Bay
area rivals, and this
weekend's competition
will likely be decided by
the teams' post players.

Cal, meanwhile, will look to run it
with forward Patrick Christopher and
guards Jerome Randle and Jamal
Boykin. who combined for 42 points on
50 percent shooting in the Jan. 26
matchup. Stanford's difficulties stop
ping dribble penetration were all too
evident in last weekend's split in Ari
zona, with Arizona State's James Hard
en (23 points) and Arizona's Jerryd
Bayless (31 points, 16-of-16 free
throws) treating Stanford guards more
like green lights than red.
"They're explosive, they're quick,
and it's no secret with our basketball
team that teams like that have caused
us problems," Johnson said. "We're not
going to get quicker guys anytime soon.
If they hurt us. we'll go to a zone or
man-miss: when they miss, we'll go in a
man, and if they score, we'll get back in
a zone."
Johnson used Fred Washington —
the one Stanford defender who's
shown the ability to stay in front of
players that athletic — very sparingly
on the weekend. The senior logged
just two points and 32 minutes over
the two games. His poor shooting is an
offensive liability (just 5 points per
game and 51 percent free throw shoot
ing this season), but Johnson said his
hand was all-but-forced: Washington
has a hip flexor, and wasn't able to go
when the other team's star heated up
in crunch time.
"We got the best we could possibly
get out of Fred," Johnson said at a Tues
day press conference. "1 would have
liked to have put him in late, but I don't
believe putting him in injured like that.
He's had two days off and 1 don't antic
ipate him being anywhere near 80 per
cent, no matter what Fred tells you."
The one-game weekend couldn't
come at a better time for Stanford, with
Washington and his teammates afford
ed the only such opportunity to heal up
and rest in weeks. ITiis weekend is Stan
ford's first in four weeks with just one
game, and. barring an opening-round
upset in the Pac-10 tournament, their
last such weekend until their season
ends at least four weeks from now.
Stanford puts a 13-1 home record

on the line Sunday, with a 76-67 loss to
UCLA (22-3. 10-2) being the sole
blemish. The Bruins lead the Cardinal
by a half-game in the Pac-10, with 13
days before the teams' Mar. 6 battle in
LA. With third-place Washington State
(20-5,8-5) two games behind the Cardi
nal in the league, that game is all that
could keep the Bruins from their third
straight Pac-10 regular season title.
"I'm so happy to have four losses
right now." Hill said. "That's a two
week stretch of last year. That's all year
now. We could have three or two if you
took away Oregon, or one if you took
away Siena, but we're still in it."
As of this moment. Stanford —
with an RPI of 20 — is a projected two,
three or four seed in the NCAA Tour
nament, which starts on Mar. 20.
