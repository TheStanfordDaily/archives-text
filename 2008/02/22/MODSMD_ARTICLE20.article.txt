## Hail SATANford Hail 
### 
Satanists of Stanford University, unite!
From today forward, we shall no longer
lie in the shadows. Standing against the
backdrop of White Plaza, an enormous ban
ner reads "may the love of SATAN be with
you."The name "Jesus" has been crossed out.
and SATAN has, very cleverly, been placed
above it on a new piece of paper.
The fact that it was hung as part of Stan
ford's anti-intolerance Diversity Week cam
paign is but a clever ruse: our agenda is now
in the public light. This is a work of pure ge
nius. It may seem small, but it surely portends
greater evil to come. At first we have one
word substitutions on campus posters. But
then, when the word has gotten out. we can
openly disembowel sheep and study their en
trails in White Plaza — which won't be so
white when we're through with it. Bwahaha
hahaha.
This sends an undeniably powerful mes
sage to the Stanford community — we Sa
tanists are an intelligent group with a viable
presence at Stanford and a lot of interesting
things to say. In our gloriously evil act. we
have shocked and awed the populace into

recognizing our legitimacy. It is only a matter
of time before we have our own ethnic
themed dorm and Satanists Cultural Club.
After all. no one pays any attention to those
special fee request petitions anyway.
Yes, Stanford, there is a new religious
force on campus, and we are hell-bent on
raising hell (within the legal limits of the state
of California and the city of Palo Alto, of
course). We are the epitome of badass, nes
tled as we may be in the suburbs of Northern
California. Our Hot Topic jeans are a stark
black contrast to the bright spring sky. Our
pentagram necklaces, with the goat-god
Baphomet embossed upon them, are a sym
bol to the world that we mean business. And

our dyed black hair is a portal to our dark,
black souls.
As we hold our next meeting, housed in
the dark grotto that is the lower west stacks
of Stanford's Green Library, we will have
much on our plates. (1 should note that we
have been kicked out of our previous weekly
meeting spot, the Axe and Palm, because our
leader has decided that he doesn't like
crepes). What fiendish acts will we commit
next? As our ancestors have done for cen
turies, we will continue to put red food color
ing in the fountains during Big Game Week
— for red is the color of blood!
Provided the University staff allows us to,
we will also create storms of hellfire to rain
down upon passing bikers near Meyer Li
brary. We will evilly climb the stairs to reach
the roof, and from there we will throw down
symbolic red and yellow confetti. Red and
yellow because, even though real fire doesn't
really have red and yellow in it so much, this
is the way people typically draw fire on
paper.
