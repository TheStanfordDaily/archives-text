# 'Nat'-ural Philosophy
## Hail SATANford Hail 
### 
Satanists of Stanford University, unite!
From today forward, we shall no longer
lie in the shadows. Standing against the
backdrop of White Plaza, an enormous ban
ner reads "may the love of SATAN be with
you."The name "Jesus" has been crossed out.
and SATAN has, very cleverly, been placed
above it on a new piece of paper.
The fact that it was hung as part of Stan
ford's anti-intolerance Diversity Week cam
paign is but a clever ruse: our agenda is now
in the public light. This is a work of pure ge
nius. It may seem small, but it surely portends
greater evil to come. At first we have one
word substitutions on campus posters. But
then, when the word has gotten out. we can
openly disembowel sheep and study their en
trails in White Plaza — which won't be so
white when we're through with it. Bwahaha
hahaha.
This sends an undeniably powerful mes
sage to the Stanford community — we Sa
tanists are an intelligent group with a viable
presence at Stanford and a lot of interesting
things to say. In our gloriously evil act. we
have shocked and awed the populace into

recognizing our legitimacy. It is only a matter
of time before we have our own ethnic
themed dorm and Satanists Cultural Club.
After all. no one pays any attention to those
special fee request petitions anyway.
Yes, Stanford, there is a new religious
force on campus, and we are hell-bent on
raising hell (within the legal limits of the state
of California and the city of Palo Alto, of
course). We are the epitome of badass, nes
tled as we may be in the suburbs of Northern
California. Our Hot Topic jeans are a stark
black contrast to the bright spring sky. Our
pentagram necklaces, with the goat-god
Baphomet embossed upon them, are a sym
bol to the world that we mean business. And

our dyed black hair is a portal to our dark,
black souls.
As we hold our next meeting, housed in
the dark grotto that is the lower west stacks
of Stanford's Green Library, we will have
much on our plates. (1 should note that we
have been kicked out of our previous weekly
meeting spot, the Axe and Palm, because our
leader has decided that he doesn't like
crepes). What fiendish acts will we commit
next? As our ancestors have done for cen
turies, we will continue to put red food color
ing in the fountains during Big Game Week
— for red is the color of blood!
Provided the University staff allows us to,
we will also create storms of hellfire to rain
down upon passing bikers near Meyer Li
brary. We will evilly climb the stairs to reach
the roof, and from there we will throw down
symbolic red and yellow confetti. Red and
yellow because, even though real fire doesn't
really have red and yellow in it so much, this
is the way people typically draw fire on
paper.

Perhaps we will continue to
change pivotal words on campus fly
ers, ruining their message and exalt
ing our owr. DKE's 'DEKEs of the
Amazon" will become "SATAN of
the Amazon." Stanford Gospel
Choir will now he presenting
SATAN Extravaganza 2008 and peo
ple looking for nieHappyZork.com
will be redirected to TheHappySA
TAN.com. BWAHAHAHHA!!!!
Actually the word "Stanford" it
self is only one letter away from SA
TANford. Use this to your advan
tage. All it takes is the addition of a
single letter on a poster, and you
have instantly (and cruelly) ruined
the message of almost any organiza
tion that states our school name.
Oh yes, we are a powerful force to
be reckoned with. If there is any
doubt of this, you guys should totally
check out my bike. It's jet black, and
it has flames on it. It's soooo cool.

and my mom agrees (and she doesn't
think ANYTHING is cool!). You
should also see the papier-mache an
imal head mask that 1 made a couple
days ago. It's got five layers of news
paper on it. My roommate helped
me make it too, and he's an arts
major. A Dark Arts major.
If you would like to find out
more, we're having an info session in
which blood will be served as re
freshment (actually just hot choco
late with food coloring in it) in
Green's south stacks this Saturday. It
starts around 8, because I've got yo
galates until 7:50, but at exactly 8, we
will begin the mayhem! Bring your
papier-mache animal heads and we
welcome any new ideas you have to
spread our devious message across
campus — and beyond.

Nat would like to really emphasize
here that he is not actually a Satanist.
This info meeting is not really happen
ing. But he'd he happy to meet you
there anyway and check out what kind
of wackos actually do show up. Email
him to set up an appointment at
nat.hillard@stanford.edu.
