## Bias and higher education 
### 
The first thing to know about bias is that
it does not necessarily live in the hearts
of individuals. While we all know peo
ple who explicitly blurt out racist/sexist/ho
mophobic (or other) comments born of igno
rance and fear, much of the bias in our socie
ty is implicit. One way of describing implicit
bias refers to associations — between partic
ular groups and certain behaviors, attitudes or
ways of being — woven into the fabric of our
society. These associations affect outcomes
and lead to inequalities, including inequalities
on our campus.
One of the strongest associations you may
be familiar with is that women are not good at
science and math. Countless psychology stud
ies have found that simple things — like hav
ing significantly fewer women's bathrooms in
the Stanford math building — enforce these
associations and lead to women feeling out of
place. No one explicitly tells women that they
are in a "foreign" field, however. All women
have to do is notice the lack of female men
tors, or try to find a bathroom. Obviously the
math department architect did not intend to
make women feel uncomfortable in the math
building; this bias was implicit.
Even the way we talk about inequality in
our society is implicitly biased. Academics,
journalists and others usually say minority

groups are disadvantaged.This language does
two things: it implies that the problem is with
minority groups, and it leaves the dominant
group "off the hook." But policies such as
"legacy" admissions (recently documented
by sociologist Douglas Massey) allow advan
tage to contribute to inequality as well: alum
ni family members are more likely to have
been admitted when minorities were blatant
ly discriminated against. White Americans
even have the overlooked advantage of being
able to describe themselves as "regular"
"normal" and from"the typical American
family."The focus in our society on disadvan
tage. even though advantage certainly exists
and contributes substantially to inequality,
has contributed to our implicit associations
between minority groups and negative char
acteristics.
The Graduate Student Council Diversity
Committee started Diversity Week to inform
you of the specific ways Stanford University
can change to help ease these biases on our
campus. And. yes. these biases exist at Stan
ford. Consider these examples:
A prospective graduate student's family
has means to pay for a standard GRE prep
course (currently costing upwards of $1,000).
This student is more likely to take the course
than a student without economic privilege.

On average, these courses can add up to 210
points to one's score. Stanford departments
whose admissions decisions rely on these
scores risk admitting students whose merit
lies not only in their intellect but also in their
pocketbook.
And during the first round reviewing these
graduate applications, Stanford faculty and
graduate students (most likely pressed for
time and not specifically trained to review
them) reading these applications are suscep
tible to implicit associations, such as "women
are not good at math" and "black people are
unintelligent."They need only read the appli
cant's name (i.e. "Jenny" applying to Electri
cal Engineering or "Jamal" applying to Eco
nomics) to trigger these associations and
allow bias to unintentionally, unconsciously
color their evaluations. Hard to believe?
Look up economists Bertrand and Mul
lainathan of the National Bureau of Econom
ic Research. They sent 5000 job applications
to various companies.The otherwise identical
applicants had either a stereotvpically white
or a black name. White applicants received 50
percent more callbacks than black applicants.
Despite this bias, let's say Jenny gets into
Stanford Electrical Engineering. She is prob-
