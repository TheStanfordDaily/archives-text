# Hierarchy
## 
### 
In the long run, the higher always
precedes the lower. For millions of
years, the Spiritual Hierarchy; custodi
ans of planetary evolution, had openly
guided humanity in its first steps (leg
ends about god-kings and lost conti
nents attest to this). Once the rise of
mental faculties enabled the species to
take responsibility of its own destiny,
the Hierarchy retreated from open
view, guiding indirectly through their
disciples, humanity's great religious,
political, and scientific leaders.
The wrong application of the men
tal apparatus by millions in the list few
centuries has resulted in unprecedent
ed challenges and a looming collapse
in the planet's fabric. Since the end of
Mil. the Hierarchy, led bv the Christ

(also known as Messiah, Imam Mahdi,
and Maitreya Buddha), are gradually
preparing humanity for their reappear
ance in public view. The New Age
movement, the development of satellite
technology, the collapse of political
totalitarianism, and the rise of people
power, to name but a few, signal their
approach.
As the Alpha and Omega, the
Hierarchy guarantees the ultimate sur
vival of life on Earth. What they need is
a modicum of good will and co-opera
tion from humanity so that every life
form on the planet can fulfill its evolu
tionary purpose. Only with their advice
and stimulation can humanity trans
form its ailing institutions and restore
balance to the planet with lasting effect.
