## Stanford Shaky From The Line 
### PAT RICK FITZGERALD 
L. p seven points with 1:49 to play last Thurs
-7 day at Arizona State, Stanford seemingly
had the game in the bag. But the Cardinal
J hit only four of eight free throws during
S that final stretch and eventually lost to the
Sun Devils 72-68 in overtime.
Along with the occasional pressure defense and
poor perimeter play, free throws have been the Achilles
heel for Stanford this season. Shooting 68.3 percent
from the charity stripe this season, the Cardinal's free
throw percentage sits at seventh place in the Pac-10
conference.
But head coach Trent Johnson is not concerned.
"They're not trying to miss them." he said. "It's noth
ing I worry about. The law of averages is going to even
out."
Johnson, speaking to reporters Tuesday, defended
his decision to leave sophomore center Robin Lopez on
the floor down the stretch against Arizona State. Lopez,
shooting 67.4 percent from the line this season, made
one of two free throws with 31 seconds left in regula
tion. His brother Brook — the Card's second best free
throw shooter at 76.3 percent — also made one of two
with only 15 seconds left, and Arizona State went on to
force overtime.
Sophomore guard Drew Shiller,an 86.4 percent free
throw shooter and Stanford's best option from the line,
was on the bench.
"For me. the kid's been into the game, in a rhythm,"
Johnson said of his decision to go with Robin. "Who
would you put in? Shiller couldn't guard the post."
Shiller had only played 10 minutes in the game at
that point. Putting him in cold during the final seconds,
Johnson stressed, was no guarantee of success at the
line.
"I think you do that kid a disservice, asking him to
come in cold and hit free throws," he said. "That would
n't be fair to Drew."
To the Cardinal's credit, the squad has shown re
silience by bouncing back from defeats. Stanford has
not lost two games in a row all season, a testament to the
team's toughness. Johnson said.
"After [Arizona State], they were completely down,
they were disappointed in themselves," he said. "When
we came back out and got back to work on Friday,
though, it was the same group of guys. That's refresh
ing."
Junior forward Lawrence Hill wa.s up until four in
the morning thinking about the game Thursday night.
"Everyone was thinking about it,"he said."They had
to make some really good plays to take it away from us.
You can always point the finger at a player or a certain
play, but it can go either way."
Stanford fans feared the worst again on Saturday,
when Arizona slowly whittled down an eight-point Car
dinal lead in the final minutes. But Brook Lopez hit
three of four free throws in the last two minutes,and the
Cardinal held on for the win.
While he expressed chagrin about Thursday's loss.
Hill said there were lessons to be learned.
"In reality, no one's going to be perfect: it's so hard
to win every game." Hill explained. "I think we have to
take the opportunity to be better."
With five games remaining in conference play and
the Cardinal hanging on to second place in the Pac-10,
1 fill said the results on the court are all that matter.
"Talk is overrated at this time of year," he said. "We
all know what we need to do."
