## Extra innings heroics power Stanford over FAU 
### JACOB JOHNSON 
The undefeated Stanford softball
team needed extra innings to get past
Florida Atlantic on Thursday night. But
with the score tied 3-3 after eight innings,
the Cardinal finally broke out, scoring 6
runs in the top of the ninth en route to a
9-3 victory at the team's first game of the
Palm Springs Classic. Twenty-four teams
are competing in the four-day tourna
ment, including three of the teams from
last year's Elite 8 and the USA Softball
team.

2/2. Palm Springs, Calif.

The Cardinal came into the weekend
ranked No. 12 in the NCAA. The team's
first test of the weekend came against
Florida Atlantic, and. although the Owls
came into the game with a mediocre
record of 4-5. they gave the Card all it
could handle.
The scoring got underway in the fifth
inning when sophomore catcher Rosey
Niell hit a solo homerun off FAU's
Amber Barton.The Owls tied it up in the
bottom of the inning with an RBI single
from senior Lauren Crandall.
A throwing error in the top of the sev
enth led to two more runs for the Cardi
nal: a sacrifice fly from senior Anna
Beardman plated the first run, and a sin
gle from sophomore Alissa Haber made
the score 3-1.
Missy Penna, the ace of the Stanford
pitching staff, hit a speed-bump in the
bottom of the seventh that almost put an
end to the team's perfect record. A lead
off walk and a one-out double put run
ners at second and third base, and the
Owls capitalized on their best scoring op
portunity of the game. A groundout to
junior shortstop Maddy Coon drove in
one run, and senior first baseman Melissa
Moore hit a single off Penna to tie the
game at 3-3. Penna quickly recovered,
however, inducing a popout to end the in
ning.
Both sides went scoreless in the eighth.
With a runner at third and only one out,
Penna struck out two in a row to retire the
side.
The ninth inning belonged to Stan
ford. Senior Erin Howe plated the first
run with a single that scored sophomore
second basemen Shannon Koplitz.
Beardman singled to load the bases, and

Haber singled to center to score Neill.
Howe was thrown out when she tried to
score from second, but Haber and Beard
man advanced on the throw to give the
Cardinal runners on second and third
with only one out. Senior Tricia Aggabao
walked to load the bases, and Maddy
Coon stepped to the plate. Coon, 0-for-4
on the night, launched Barton's offering
into the right field stands for a grand
slam.
FAU could muster little offense in the
bottom of the inning â€” Penna retired the
side in order.
Stanford is off to a phenomenal start
to the 2008 season. En route to winning
its first 10 games, the team has outscored
its opponents 68 to 5. Before last night,
ace pitcher Penna had thrown seven
shutouts and only allowed two runs on
the season.
ITie Cardinal continues competition

this morning when it faces Fordham at
10:00 a.m., followed by Oklahoma at
12:30 p.m. Stanford faces UNLV and
Ohio State tomorrow and finishes the
weekend with Texas on Sunday.
Fordham is led by freshman standout
Jocelyn Dearborn, who was named the
Atlantic-10 Rookie of the Week on Feb.
18. Dearborn is hitting an incredible .476
with a slugging percentage of .714, al
though she has yet to take a walk this sea
son.
Oklahoma will pose a much greater
challenge for the Card. The Sooners are
No. 6 in the NCAA and enter the Palm
Springs Classic with a 9-2 record. After
beginning the season with losses to No. 10
UCLA and No. 21 Cal State-Fullerton,
the Sooners have won seven straight.
