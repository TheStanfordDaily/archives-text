# Stanford takes on top-ranked BYU
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Men's Volleyball Team will travel to Provo,
Utah, this weekend to take on No. 1 Brigham Young.
Last weekend. Stanford came away with a victory over the Uni
versity of the Pacific 3-2 (30-26,30-19,24-30,30-32,15-11), aveng
ing an earlier defeat in January.
About midway through the season, the Cardinal has shown an
interesting array of talent.
For the second consecutive year, sophomore opposite Evan
Romero leads the team in kills. At an impressive 216 — about 5 per
game — he is well on his way to trumping last year's 384. He is also
demonstrating incredible consistency, recording 20 kills in the
match against Pacific and 27 in matches against UC-Santa Barbara
and Northridge.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran is second in kills at 141, aver
aging just under 4 per game. He is equally strong on defense, accu
mulating a team-high 95 digs.
Sophomore Kawika Shoji is the current leader in assists, posting
385 so far this season. Though he primarily plays setter, he moved
to attacker against Pacific and did remarkably well at that position,
as well. Shoji posted 19 kills at a .368 hitting percentage and 4
blocks to go along with them.
Freshmen Spencer McLachlin and Charley Henrikson have
also proven themselves assets to the Cardinal team. After missing
the first seven games of the season due to injury, McLachlin re
turned to play against UCSB, Northridge and Pacific, posting 16
kills at a .314 hitting percentage in the last game.
Henrickson has been able to deliver when called upon, so far ac
cumulating almost 40 kills. He has only committed 4 errors of 65 at
tempts, achieving a .523 hitting percentage.
The B YU Cougars, however, are no easy team to beat.They are
currently undefeated, with only three of their 11 matches having
gone to 5 games.
They are coming off a much-needed 3-1 victory against UCI
(28-30,30-22,30-24,30-26). On Tliesday, All-American senior mid
dle blocker Russell Holmes was named the Mountain Pacific

Sports Federation Player of the Week (MPSF).'ITie week before
that, senior outside hitter Ivan Perez held the same title.
Perez leads the team in kills with 173 at a .364 hitting percent
age. Senior Jonathon Charette is not far behind, with 151 kills at a
.260 hitting percentage. ITie Cougars have four players who have
accumulated more than 100 kills on the season, and wield a .313
hitting percentage as a team.
Stanford will play BYIJ this Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m. at
Smith Fieldhouse in Provo, Utah. Next week, the team returns
home to play the University of Hawaii on Wednesday and Thurs
day at Burnham Pavilion.
