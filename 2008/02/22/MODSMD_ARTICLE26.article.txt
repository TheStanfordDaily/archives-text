# Women face UCSD, loaded field at Irvine
## 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's water polo team
will hit the road for the first time this season
when it travels to Irvine for this weekend's
Irvine Invitational Tournament. This will be
their second tournament of the year, and
while the team played well in the their third
place showing at the Stanford Invitational,
they go into this tournament with hopes of
doing even better.
Like the Stanford tournament, the Irvine
Invitational will showcase the top squads in
the country. It is double the size, however,
with 16 teams in the field. All 16 of the teams
competing in the tournament are ranked in
the top 17, so there will be plenty of opportu
nities for teams to move up or down in the
national rankings. That also means, though,
that there will be no easy games for any
team.
"Given the quality of the teams in the
tournament... we will have four challeng
ing games," said Cardinal coach John Tanner.
Right now, the only team Stanford is as
sured of playing is UC-San Diego, the team it
will face in its opening match on Saturday.
The Tritons are ranked No. 16 in the nation,
and although they have a sub-.500 record,
most of their losses have been close ones
against highly-ranked teams. They have also
picked themselves up by winning their last
two games, so they have some momentum
heading into the tournament.
If the Card gets past UCSD, it will face the

winner of No. 10 UC-Irvine vs No. 7 San Jose
State, the other two teams in its group. Coach
Tanner likens Irvine to UCSD in that they
both are "very good defensive teams, [yet
both have] several dynamic scoring threats."
Irvine is coming off back-to-back losses
against UCLA and USC, but the Anteaters
have the benefit of playing at home through
out the tournament. It will be interesting to
see how much that advantage helps them.
San Jose State, the Cardinal's other possi
ble second-round opponent, comes into the
tournament with an overall record of 6-4.
The Spartans will be hoping for a better
showing than the one they had in the Stan
ford Invite, where they went 1-3 and finished
sixth out of eight teams. Tanner, however,
sees past their mediocre record.
"San Jose [State] is extremely strong and
determined," he said. "[They have] gone toe
to-toe with several top-five teams, losing by a
single goal to [No. 4] Hawaii and
[No. 5] Cal."The Spartans also lost
to No. 1 UCLA in the Stanford In
vitational but actually played the
Bruins even for three of the four
periods in that match.
If Stanford can win its first two
games, there is a chance that it
could face No. 3 USC in the semifi
nals. But while the Cardinal will he
relishing a chance to avenge its onlv

loss of the season thus far. the Tro
jans are by no means guaranteed a
spot in the semifinal. No. 10 UC-
Davis and No. 6 San Diego State —
who is currently undefeated — are
also in their group and will be look
ing to spring an upset.
On the other side of the bracket,
top-ranked UCLA is the favorite to
make it to the tournament's cham
pionship game, though Hawaii and
Cal can also be considered con
tenders. If the tournament happens
to play out according to ranking,
the No. 2 Cardinal will meet the
Bruins in the title match. And while
it would be a daunting task for any

team to play against the currently
undefeated defending champions,
it would also be a great early-sea
son test for Stanford — not to men
tion a chance to possibly take over
the No. 1 ranking.
Tanner, however, refused to
speculate on his team's possible op
ponents beyond the second round.
If anything, that tells us that while
the Cardinal will be looking to win
the tournament championship,
their strategy remains the same:
One game at a time.
