Stanford will participate in one of the fastest and
most anticipated dual meets in the nation tomor
row when it hosts rival Cal at the Avery Aquatic
Center.
The dive team won a meet at BYU last Friday,
but the swim team has not seen action since the
weekend of Feb. 8 when it won against CSU-Bak
ersfield and USC.
The No. 3 Stanford men's swim team has one of
the most impressive streaks in college, as it has cur
rently won 26 straight Pac-10 titles.
The team has won the Pac-10 conference ever)'
year since 1982. Since then. No. 11 Cal has proven to
be its biggest rival,often recruiting foreign talent to
compete with Stanford's best. This will be the last
dual meet of the season for both teams as they pre
pare for the Pac-10 and NCAA Championships.
'ITiis meet and the Pac-10s will be the last oppor
tunities for team members to swim NCAA quality

ing cuts in their respective events.
Junior backstroker David Russell, freshman
hreaststroker Damir Dugonjic, junior diver Sam
Helvie and senior 2(X) freestyle NCAA runner-up
Dominik Meichtry anchor the Cal team. Russell is
the defending Pac-10 champion in the 1 (K) hack and
has the nation's second and third fastest times in the
1 (K) and 200 back events. Stanford counters with its
own breaststroke squad of freshman John Criste,
junior captains Paul Kornfeld and Nate Cass, and
juniors Chris Ash and Paul Zaich.The breaststro
kers all have the potential to make NCAA finals
and should cement valuable points for the Cardinal
at upcoming meets.
"The great thing about Stanford swimming is it
has been in the top three in the country for the past
20 years," explained Kornfeld. "Every year we have
a team with potential to challenge for the title. Last
year we graduated one of the best classes to ever
come through Stanford, so replacing them is not
easy, but every year brings new challenges and new
excitement."

"One thing [head swimming coach] Skip [Ken
ney] talks a lot about is always working for the guy
next to you, trying to beat him not just for yourself,
but to make him better." said Cass.
"1 think that's what sets Stanford swimming
apart from other programs. Jason (Dunford] and
Paul [Kornfeld] aren't afraid to get in your face and
call you out if they think you aren't swimming fast
enough — they value your success and the success
of the team more than they value what you think of
them.
"And. after you've finished getting angry and
simply going faster than you thought you could, you
thank them for it,because you know they really care
about you and about the team."
With the Pac-10championships in Southern Cal
ifornia and the NCAA championships in Washing
ton coming up, tomorrow's meet against the Bears
will be the last home meet of the season for the Car
dinal.
