# Women to baffle Bears
## No. 7 Stanford faces off against No. 8 Cal for Pac-10 supremacy 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SCOTT BLAND 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team may
be ranked ahead of No. 8 California, but the Bears
still hold a one-game lead over the Cardinal in the
Pacific-10 Conference standings. Stanford will be
looking to change that this Saturday when the team
travels to Berkeley for its rematch with Cal.
"Our team is excited about the rematch." Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said."We're play
ing well and they're playing well,so we expect it'll be
a great game."
In the teams' first match-up. Stanford blew out Cal at
home. 72-52.
California head coach Joanne Boyle acknowl
edged what that defeat meant and conceded that.de
spite holding the league lead, her squad might be an
underdog heading into this game.
"We didn't perform over there," Boyle said. "It
doesn't matter that we're a game ahead."
But VanDerveer feels differently and is treating
this game as a rare instance when the Cardinal is the

underdog.
"Last time 1 checked, they were in first place,"she
said.
Although the Bears have won every other game
on the conference schedule, the team hit a rough

GAME NOTES: It doesn't get much bigger than this for Stan

Sophomore center Jayne Appel was named Pac-10 Player of the Week for her
performances against Arizona and ASU last weekend. Appel averaged a dou
ble double as the Cardinal routed both the Wildcats and the Sun Devils.
patch starting with that game against
Stanford. Cal needed overtime to
beat USC at home the next weekend
and participated in one of the ugliest
halves of basketball — the score was
13-11 for ( ;il at halftime — in Pac-10
history at Oregon State, the confer
ence's second-worst team.
By contrast, the Cardinal has been
rolling as of late: last weekend against
the Arizona schools, Stanford domi
nated on defense and on offense in
back-to-back routs.
On offense, Stanford asserted it
self both on the perimeter and in the
post. Senior guard Candice Wiggins, in
her last regular season games at
home, led all scorers in both games,
and sophomore center Jayne Appel
averaged a double-double over the
two contests.
Appel was named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for her performance.
Against Arizona, sophomore guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude erupted for a
career-high 17 points. As per the
norm, Stanford dominated the boards
and forced its opponents to make er
rant passes and bad decisions all
game.
The Cardinal will face a tough test
in the post:Cal forwards Ashley Walk
er and Devanei 1 lampton are first and
second on the team in both scoring
and rebounding, respectively. Walker
averages 16 points per game to go
with 9.4 boards, while I lampton is av
eraging 13.5 points and 7.9 rebounds
per game.
But Stanford is one of the few
teams in the Pac-10 that can counter
the Bears with a pair of elite post play
ers of its own. Appel (14.6 points per

game. 9 rebounds per game) and
freshman forward kayla Pedersen
(12.9 points per game, 8.3 rebounds
per game) will be all over Cal's for
wards at both ends of the court, while
leading scorer Wiggins (19.4 points
per game) darts inside and out from
her guard position.
Control of the ball in this regard,
and in all other ways throughout the
game, will be crucial for Cal. Stanford
excels on defense at forcing its oppo
nents into perilous situations — if the
Bears cannot assert themselves on the
boards, then Cardinal put-backs be
come inevitable; if they turn the ball
over, then Stanford can run away with
the game through its transition of
fense.
The latter point doesn't bode well
for Cal: they are eighth in the Pac-10
in turnover margin. Stanford is first.
Starting Bears guard Natasha Vital
has turned the ball over 73 times
alone, and Wiggins — fourth in the
Pac-10 in steals — and the rest of the
Cardinal will look to exploit this
weakness.
But the Cal defense is the best in
the Pac-10. and their stoppers will be
more than a formidable opponent for
the Cardinal.Their main objective will
be to shut down Wiggins, who is on an
offensive tear at the moment. If they
can do that and force Appel and Ped
ersen to take difficult shots, then the
Bears can put themselves in an excel
lent position to beat their rivals.
Wiggins will also continue her
quest for the Pac-10 career scoring
record. Ihe star guard has 2.365 ca
reer points, 49 points behind the
record set by I Jsa I xjslie over 10 years
ago.
