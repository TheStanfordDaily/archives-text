## Editor's Note 
### 
Gentle Reader,
You hold now in your hot, probably influenza-covered hands (seriously, there's an epidemic going around<\p>--<\p>when it comes to hand-washing, vigor and frequency are the order
of the day) the second edition of the quasi-annual Intermission Short Story Contest. Over the past few weeks, I have received dozens of stunning applications and here, presented for
your approval, are some of the best pieces of original fiction that your peers have to offer.
Unfortunately, there were far more submissions than could possibly fit in these pages, so judged them we must...have. The winners were selected by a judging panel composed equally of
poets, philosophers and economists (dude, someone had to crunch the numbers) who read each anonymous submission thoroughly and tried not to spill too much wine on it. Obviously
there is no objective way to rank prose<\p>--<\p>one man's Faulkner is another man's, ugh, Faulkner. But hey, somebody had to win the fabulous cash and prizes:
Ist place: $50
2nd place: $20 Compadre's gift certificate and any CD in our sample drawer (" Best of Rod Stewart," anyone?)
3rd place: $20 Compadre's gift certificate and a picture of a llama
Turn to the spread on pages six and seven to see who walked away with the loot. If you disagree with our selections, feel free to send your objections via email. I can't promise to actually
read them, but I will definitely forward them to the economist, who might agree to do your taxes to ease your disgruntlement. You can also read four more stellar original stories on
pages four and five, and. just so no one will claim we're bigoted against poets (except Coleridge<\p>--<\p>l want to punch Coleridge right in his prissy face), a small selection of original
poetry is included below.
And if you're interested in writing prose or poetry, or if this inspires you, keep in mind that Intermission is constantly looking for new writers. Beginning last week. Intermission started
publishing a regular original fiction section in which I hope to continue featuring your ridiculously fantastic writing. If you're interested in more details or want to hit me up with a limer
ick or eight, shoot me an email at intermission.daily@stanford.edu
Okay, now stop reading this and get to the good stuff. Enjoy!
