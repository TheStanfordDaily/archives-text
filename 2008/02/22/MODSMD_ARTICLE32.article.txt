# The 						Braggadocia

### BETSY WALLS 
I was a grocery girl before I read Ginsburg
and these days I'm thinking about banking —
soothing the wealth of the rich right into
my own pocket, with their grateful nods
to my sacred touch like double-hand dice.
Perhaps something else — so many chances
for my genius greatness grandest glorious
mind that can lose itself alliteratively.
1 tip my hat to you ladies who marched for me,
though it seems the most tread oppositely
of whichever way 1 vote,
if we still wore hats or anybody tipped them.
Even to you more recent wonderfems,
even the ones who saved my sisters
from being wives to make them whores,
from being cooks to make them fools.
I'm sure you meant well, sugars —
daresay I'll be all of the above,
all above what and where you ever dreamed
we could. I will bank not to out-bank a bank
but to make bankers wish they could
forget like me, bake like me, break like me
away from lick-addled siren success.
Then I will litigate — litigate both for and against
you or he or she — litigate, literate that 1 am,
in iamb and rhyme and doubletime
be home, retired like Salinger in his
New England den of ornery ordinary.
1 was born in California and have made it
to California. I know my own name.
