# you are the fugue in the other room

### KARMIA CAO 
now, and i open my windows wide.
below, the streets are irritated:
a rash of yellow light is spreading quickly and
night sounds: croaking men, churning women, chirping children
night noises invade, escape into my pores
to seek solace and distill doubt
chase the note before the first.
you are playing in the other room now
(and not in the radii of urgent remembrance)
some song you caught and branded for me
but only in the other room
sometimes, i pick up limbs of chords with my little earhands
trembling and blood-trot, you are shards from
the shattered glass ulcer, broken symbols
gather as sand of seventeen thousand shores gyrating atop one another
all breathing in total earnest.
we share one last wall
you are in the other room
some days the city nods off facedown, drowning briefly in its own filth
under the absent sky, i hear nothing but your blue eyes moving along the wall
i hear you reading the fallow concrete
from corner to corner
eyehands feeling for the last hole
i swore i had closed.
you are music in the next room now
and i open my windows wide
below, old men walk backwards
toddlers preach on street corners
the moon is a kite
tangled in the lines we drew between the stars
i am afraid
to hear you from the outside.
now, and i open my windows wide.
