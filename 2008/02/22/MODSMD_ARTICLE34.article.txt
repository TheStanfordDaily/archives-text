## Battle of the Literary Badasses 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION BOOKISH HOOKIE 
This week, in honor of Intermission's short story competi
tion. Bracketology takes on a literary theme. More specifically,
I'm concerned with finding out which character, in all of world
literature, is the biggest badass of them all. And what, you say,
makes a literary badass? Is it heroic deeds? Sexual prowess? A
cool disability? Don't turn that page, dear reader â€” your an
swers are right here.
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Atticus Finch vs. 16. Johnny Tremain
Two American heroes square off! Johnny Tremain has a
molten silver disfigured hand and my little sister had a crush
on him. Pretty badass. But Atticus a) inspires millions of peo
ple to go to law school every year, b) secretly started the civil
rights movement and c) makes me stand up just thinking
about him. Respect. EDGE: Atticus.
8. Nurse Ratched vs. 9. Chief Bromden
These two characters from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" get major bonus points since a tripped-out Ken Kesey
actually invented them on this very campus. I have this men
tal picture of him slaving over the manuscript while he downs
a spiked Jamba Juice at Tresidder. Anyway, as far as the
match-up goes: lobotomies are a hell of a lot freakier than pil
lows. EDGE: Ratched.
5. Gandalf vs. 12. Old Ben
We all know that Gandalf struggles with huge monsters, as
evidenced by his little run-in with the Balrog. And Old Ben,
William Faulkner's ferocious Escalade-sized bear, is as
beastly as they come. Add in the fact that 12 seeds historical
ly upset fives during March Madness, and it all leads to one
shocking conclusion. Gandalf, you shall not . .. pass! EDGE:
Old Ben.

4. Sherlock Holmes vs. 13. Odysseus
Cunning versus Crafty. It all comes down to their vices.
Odysseus had a nasty habit of getting "trapped" on islands for
years with beautiful goddesses. Sherlock's major weakness was
his dependence on cocaine. But this was only because his brain
was too awesome for normal states of consciousness. Sherlock
puts Odysseus in his pipe and smokes him. EDGE: Sherlock.
3. Jay Gatsby vs. 14. Holden Caulfield
Gatsby is an opulent stud who throws better parties than
Hefner. Holden is a self-obsessed prep school drop-out who
forever enabled our nation's teenagers to be angsty. I've got to
go with the American Dreamer over the American Emo-er.
EDGE: Gatsby.
6. Captain Ahab vs. 11. Beowulf
Ahab lamely lost his manhood to Moby Dick, while Be
owulf, at least according to Robert Zemeckis, concealed his
naked lower half behind a variety of goblets and candles
(Austin Powers-style!). I've got to reward that penile ingenu
ity. EDGE: Beowulf and Little Beowulf.
7. Dean Moriarty vs. 10. Florentino Ari/.a
A contest of Casanovas. Florentino, of Gabriel GarciaJVlar
quez's "Love in the Time of Cholera," literally bedded 622 dif
ferent women. Wilt Chamberlain approves. But that's not as
good as this: Dean, from Jack Kerouac's "On the Road." lost
his virginity when he was nine. Nine! Reader, what were you up
to when you were nine? 1 was collecting Beanie Babies. Not
babes. EDGE: Dean.
2. Mr. Darcy vs. 15. Mr. Rochester
Darcy set frustratingly unrealistic standards for men. He's
somehow convinced womankind that all guys look like young
Colin Firth, ooze with cash and secretly love them. Meanwhile,
Jane Eyre's Edward Rochester knows the two secrets to being
a badass: 1. Get blinded in a fire. 2. Lock your crazy wife in the
attic and pretend she doesn't exist. EDGE: Rochester.

ELITE EIGHT:
1. Atticus vs. 8. Ratched
Good > Evil. Atticus is my boy. EDGE: Atticus.
12. Old Ben vs. 4. Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock could easily outsmart a bear, high out of his mind
or ijot. EDGE: Sherlock.
3. Gatsby vs. 11. Beowulf
Gatsby is a certifiable G. And no one actually wants to read
Beowulf. EDGE: Gatsby.
7. Dean vs. 15. Rochester
Nine. Nine. Nine! EDGE: Dean.
FINAL FOUR:
1. Atticus vs. 4. Sherlock
The one mystery Sherlock can't solve is why Atticus Finch is
so perfect. EDGE: Atticus.
3. Gatsby vs. 7. Dean
Dean gets all the action. Gatsby's got all the cash. My ver
dict? All about the Benjamins. EDGE: Gatsby.
CHAMPIONSHIP
1. Atticus vs. 3. Gatsby
Gatsby wastes his time and money pining for long-lost love.
Atticus fights for racial justice, reads to his kids and shoots
rabid dogs. Ladies and gentlemen, the baddest mofo in litera
ture.
CHAMP: Atticus.
MVP: Gregory Peck's forceful stare.
