## No One is Coing to Die 
### SARAH THOMAS 
Eloise Hamada-Simms, age eight, is sitting in the operating
chair waiting to die.
The past couple of weeks have felt like an inescapable night
mare, squeezing tighter the more she struggles. Eloise once had
a nightmare about being strangled by a boa constrictor until she
popped like a balloon. She would like to think that this is just a
dream, too, that she'll wake up soon to find Mom doing the cross
word and Dad frying hashbrowns and Nina happy and healthy
and wanting to play dolls. But she knows it's not. 1 ler little sister
hasn't had the energy to play dolls for a while now.
Eloise's parents are sitting against the wall to her left in blue
chairs of textured plastic, silent and exhausted. Her father's
bedraggled blond hair looks as though it hasn't seen a shower in
days, and his right leg keeps jumping from a nervous twinge. The
fingers of his opposite hand drum on his wife's knee. She is a stat
ue, almost lifeless except for the residual redness around her al
mond-shaped eyes. The wall behind them is white and bare, en
dorsing the room's cleanliness but intimidating its occupants with
impersonality. The air is stale from endless recycling and filtra
tion.
Eloise adjusts her hold on her stuffed polar bear, the one that
she got from Grandpa on her last birthday. She named it Huggy
and it has slept in her bed ever since. She keeps her movements
slow so as not to disturb her parents. Not long ago she would have
turned to them for comfort, naively confident in their ability to
solve any problem. Recent events, however, have imposed the
stomach-lurching realization that her parents are not invincible.
They cannot help her this time. Now Eloise has to help them by
saving Nina.
She jumps as the door opens to admit a white-coated doctor

and nurse. The doctor smiles at Eloise through
thick round glasses, reminding her of a frog she
saw squished in the road outside her house. She
clutches Huggy and doesn't smile back. Unper-

turbed, the doctor turns to Eloise's parents.
"Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Simms," the doctor greets
them warmly.
"Hamada, please," Eloise's mother responds automatically.
"Ah ..." The doctor withdraws a clipboard from under his
arm and scans the top page. "Mrs. 1 lamada, yes. Excuse me." He
redirects his smile toward the couple. "My name is Dr. Larson.
I'll be performing the procedure today. I'd like to answer any last
questions you might have."
Eloise's father sighs, a helpless sound that chills his daughter.
"I know there aren't many options, but she's so young — "
"It's unusual, yes, but she should suffer no worse side effects
than from a flu," the doctor reassures him placidly. "And you
know it's very difficult to find a matching donor for mixed-race
patients. Siblings are the best bet. You're very lucky to have a
perfect match here with Eloise."
Eloise feels uncomfortable hearing her name come out of the
mouth of a stranger like that. The round nurse is gently but effi
ciently extracting Huggy from Eloise's arms. Eloise lets go
without much of a struggle. Goodbye, Huggy, she tells him silent
ly. The bustling nurse begins to swab the inside of Eloise's elbows
with a piece of fluffy wet cotton.
"This will make you sleepy so that you won't feel anything.
It'll only hurt a little bit," she tells Eloise as she assembles the
contraption of tubes and needles. "Just look the other way,
sweetheart." Eloise obediently turns her head and feels a tiny
prick ?ts the needle slips into the vein.
Eloise wants to believe her, but she isn't convinced. She
checks to make sure that her parents are busy with the doctor be
fore turning to the nurse and whispering, "Does it hurt to die?"
The nurse's expression melts with sympathy. "Oh, honey,
there's no need to talk like that. Your little sister is going to be

just fine. No one is going to die." She pats Eloise on the shoulder
and adjusts the tubing sticking out of her arm.
Eloise knows the nurse is lying. Of course someone's going to
die, she thinks with annoyance. But she doesn't say anything. The
anesthesia is beginning to fog her brain. People die all the time.
After all, that's how she knows that her parents love Nina more:
upon learning that their younger daughter would die without
fresh bone marrow, they chose to sacrifice Eloise in her stead.
Eloise isn't sure what "marrow" is, but she knows that bones are
definitely necessary to survive; she had broken her right arm two
years ago and had barely gotten by with just the left for six weeks.
Eloise watches with detached interest the florescent light
above her. There are colors swimming across its surface like on a
soap bubble. It's all right, really, she tells herself, the words fuzzy
with static in her own head. Nina is much better at gymnastics,
anyway.
Eloise is still in the operating chair, her brain full of cobwebs.
She slits her eyes to find the room empty and the door ajar with
subdued voices wafting in. She continues to gaze vacuously at the
door until her mother's face appears around it.
"Eloise, you're awake!" Her mother is invigorated by relict.
She is at Eloise's side instantly.
"Is — is Nina ... " Eloise is having trouble getting her mouth
to cooperate.
"Nina is doing fine," her mother croons, smoothing Eloise's
hair.
The doctor has entered the room behind her. "We won't
know for a few weeks whether the cancer is improving, but she's
stable for now," he supplements.
"Now hush, darling." Her mother is smiling, really smiling, for
the first time since Nina got sick. "Everything will be all right."
Eloise's eyelids slide closed as her mouth curls upward. She
marvels at the second chance that she has been able to give her
sister, a gift that she herself has received as well, and she admires
the stubborn vitality in her blood and bones and marrow.
