## GABRIEL SELLS HIS BUCKET ON CRAIGSLIST 
### MATTHEW GILLESPIE 
Gabriel sat in his chair as the sun perched high in the sky
over the bay. Looking out his window from high atop Pacific
Heights, he thought for a moment of his mother, no more
than twenty blocks from him then, on the ninth floor of that
great white hospital building looming high over the Sunset
District in the southern San Francisco hills. Was she, he won
dered, watching this same scene? He'd call her later, but first
there was more pertinent business to set his mind to. Gabriel
put his red-socked feet up on the windowsill and kicked off,
gliding over the hardwood floors in his desk chair and back to
his computer screen to finish today's blog entry.
And so, dear readers, today I woke in my bed and felt within
my brain a singular purpose for my day. As it were, this was a
welcome change from just one day preceding, for as you well
know I spent that day wrapped tightly in my bedclothes as I
wrestled in my mind with the dialectic of existence versus nonex
istence and epiphany versus catastrophe until the early evening
hours, when I finally roused from my mattress to satiate myself
with a bag of sour cream and onion potato crisps and a tonic
water. Not today though, no no — today my purpose be as clear
as can be, as salient as a master chemist's new discovery and as
concrete as the sidewalk; today, my dear reader, I'm going to sell
my bucket.
Gabriel Mathison was a curved wisp of a man, six feet five
inches tall and barely one hundred thirty pounds ("congested
glands," he wrote in the blog, are what arrested him forever in
the body of a gawking prepubescent that grew far too quickly
into a grown-up's body). He was sharp but lonely, an educated
man with a penchant for preproccssed potato chips and slight
ly more master's degrees (one) than friends. His blog received
around fifty or so hits per month, although the majority of these
were from him checking for other peoples' comments. He or
dered his groceries online and had them delivered. Gabriel
hadn't left his apartment in seven months.
Yes, J, your noble hero, am selling my bucket. Not because I
need the money, no, no, but as an experiment, a test to see what
decrepit vagabonds wandering aimlessly through the dimly lit
and disease infested back alleys of cyberspace will actually re
spond to so preposterous an announcement. Fear not, though,

for I will be safe — / assure you that I will not meet face to face
(indeed, if a "human" being lost enough in the folds of the uni
verse to come seeking my galvanized merchandise even lias a
face) with these people, merely wait by my telephone for their
phone calls and then duly report their contents on these very
pages. I've no doubt that, once again, my deft maneuvering to
and fro about the darkest and most sinister of peoples populat
ing this earth will again prove the horrific, abhorable state I see
culture/society/etc. currently in. Until then, as always, The
Angel.
He munched some sour cream and onion chips. As the sun
seemed just ready to dip below the rows of houses off to the
West, Gabriel got his first call. "Hello?"
"Yeah hi. I'm calling about the bucket, the. uh, the one you
put on the Internet."
"Hm, well, you certainly sound like the type that might."
Gabriel said, tipping the phone receiver away from his mouth
as he stuffed in a handful of chips. "What'd you like to know?"
"Oh well, you know, your ad makes it kinda hard to know a
lot about it. I had'a bucket I used for lots around here but, you
know, now 1 can't find it no more, so I need a new one."
Gabriel ran his tongue across the backs of his teeth looking
for errant chip mush. "Well, again, you certainly sound like the
type that would call for my bucket. However, I — "
"Oh, I don't know yet, you still gotta tell me a few things."

the caller interrupted.
He blew air out his nostrils. "What else is there to know. It's
just as it says in the ad. Metal bucket, eight quarts. The human
body only has five point five quarts of blood in it, so you'd still
have some room to spare in there after you carry out whatever
horrific and murderous deed is no doubt your true-hearted mo
tive for inquiring to me as to the use of the bucket — 1 assure
you, it will be more than able to accommodate your reprehen
sible and morally bankrupt needs for this galvanized recepta
cle 1 am offering."
"Urn, well, you know."the caller paused, "I'm really just
callin' about your bucket. I don't need to know any doctor stuff
'bout blood or anything. But since you mentioned it and stuff,
just like, you know, I gotta ask you what's galvanized mean? It
just sounds kinda fancy and, I mean, I know I paid way less than
five dollars for my last bucket. I'm on a budget, you know, I
don't wanna pay for somethin' I don't need."
Gabriel leaned back in his chair. "Ah, now this front you put
on is bold, charlatan, but you should know assuredly that I am
onto your devious scheme," he said, kicking his desk and spin
ning once in the chair. "Thorough is the downfall of civilization
when one would spend any amount of one's waking hours in
swift pursuit of a trivial five dollar trinket of the modem age. 1
feel our work here is done, harlot — I've gotten all that 1 need
from this exchange."
"Oh, no, no, sorry, my name isn't Charlotte, it's Denise.
Look I think our connection must be bad maybe, but I'm havin'
a real hard time hearing you. I just wanna know what gal-ven
ized means so 1 know if 1 wanna spend any extra money on it.
I'm between the jobs right now and I gotta just be careful —
only reason I'm callin' you in the first place is that I just made a
sale myself, sold a red New Year's dress to some lady over in
Milbrae for a hundred and fif — "
"Miss, we're done here. 1 feel yet more disquieted than ever
right now, and I must go swiftly to lament at the current state of
our society in my Weblog. I say goodbye now."
Gabriel clicked the phone off as the sun set behind him in

put his red-socked feet up on the windowsill and kicked off,
gliding over the hardwood floors in his desk chair and back to
his computer screen to finish today's blog entry.
And so, dear readers, today I woke in my bed and felt within
my brain a singular purpose for my day. As it were, this was a
welcome change from just one day preceding, for as you well
know I spent that day wrapped tightly in my bedclothes as I
wrestled in my mind with the dialectic of existence versus nonex
istence and epiphany versus catastrophe until the early evening
hours, when I finally roused from my mattress to satiate myself
with a bag of sour cream and onion potato crisps and a tonic
water. Not today though, no no — today my purpose be as clear
as can be, as salient as a master chemist's new discovery and as
concrete as the sidewalk; today, my dear reader, I'm going to sell
my bucket.
Gabriel Mathison was a curved wisp of a man, six feet five
inches tall and barely one hundred thirty pounds ("congested
glands," he wrote in the blog, are what arrested him forever in
the body of a gawking prepubescent that grew far too quickly
into a grown-up's body). He was sharp but lonely, an educated
man with a penchant for preproccssed potato chips and slight
ly more master's degrees (one) than friends. His blog received
around fifty or so hits per month, although the majority of these
were from him checking for other peoples' comments. He or
dered his groceries online and had them delivered. Gabriel
hadn't left his apartment in seven months.
Yes, J, your noble hero, am selling my bucket. Not because I
need the money, no, no, but as an experiment, a test to see what
decrepit vagabonds wandering aimlessly through the dimly lit
and disease infested back alleys of cyberspace will actually re
spond to so preposterous an announcement. Fear not, though,

for I will be safe — / assure you that I will not meet face to face
(indeed, if a "human" being lost enough in the folds of the uni
verse to come seeking my galvanized merchandise even lias a
face) with these people, merely wait by my telephone for their
phone calls and then duly report their contents on these very
pages. I've no doubt that, once again, my deft maneuvering to
and fro about the darkest and most sinister of peoples populat
ing this earth will again prove the horrific, abhorable state I see
culture/society/etc. currently in. Until then, as always, The
Angel.
He munched some sour cream and onion chips. As the sun
seemed just ready to dip below the rows of houses off to the
West, Gabriel got his first call. "Hello?"
"Yeah hi. I'm calling about the bucket, the. uh, the one you
put on the Internet."
"Hm, well, you certainly sound like the type that might."
Gabriel said, tipping the phone receiver away from his mouth
as he stuffed in a handful of chips. "What'd you like to know?"
"Oh well, you know, your ad makes it kinda hard to know a
lot about it. I had'a bucket I used for lots around here but, you
know, now 1 can't find it no more, so I need a new one."
Gabriel ran his tongue across the backs of his teeth looking
for errant chip mush. "Well, again, you certainly sound like the
type that would call for my bucket. However, I — "
"Oh, I don't know yet, you still gotta tell me a few things."

the caller interrupted.
He blew air out his nostrils. "What else is there to know. It's
just as it says in the ad. Metal bucket, eight quarts. The human
body only has five point five quarts of blood in it, so you'd still
have some room to spare in there after you carry out whatever
horrific and murderous deed is no doubt your true-hearted mo
tive for inquiring to me as to the use of the bucket — 1 assure
you, it will be more than able to accommodate your reprehen
sible and morally bankrupt needs for this galvanized recepta
cle 1 am offering."
"Urn, well, you know."the caller paused, "I'm really just
callin' about your bucket. I don't need to know any doctor stuff
'bout blood or anything. But since you mentioned it and stuff,
just like, you know, I gotta ask you what's galvanized mean? It
just sounds kinda fancy and, I mean, I know I paid way less than
five dollars for my last bucket. I'm on a budget, you know, I
don't wanna pay for somethin' I don't need."
Gabriel leaned back in his chair. "Ah, now this front you put
on is bold, charlatan, but you should know assuredly that I am
onto your devious scheme," he said, kicking his desk and spin
ning once in the chair. "Thorough is the downfall of civilization
when one would spend any amount of one's waking hours in
swift pursuit of a trivial five dollar trinket of the modem age. 1
feel our work here is done, harlot — I've gotten all that 1 need
from this exchange."
"Oh, no, no, sorry, my name isn't Charlotte, it's Denise.
Look I think our connection must be bad maybe, but I'm havin'
a real hard time hearing you. I just wanna know what gal-ven
ized means so 1 know if 1 wanna spend any extra money on it.
I'm between the jobs right now and I gotta just be careful —
only reason I'm callin' you in the first place is that I just made a
sale myself, sold a red New Year's dress to some lady over in
Milbrae for a hundred and fif — "
"Miss, we're done here. 1 feel yet more disquieted than ever
right now, and I must go swiftly to lament at the current state of
our society in my Weblog. I say goodbye now."
Gabriel clicked the phone off as the sun set behind him in
the western sky.
