# The
						Accident
## 
### WILLIAM EAST 
It was green and gray and the air hung heavy with the rem
nants of rainfall. The last shimmering rays of day were succumb
ing to dusk as the unbeliever drove across North Carolina's mid
dle land. This was a trip from the cramped city to the rolling
serenity of the beach, and getting there required passage through
mile after mile of dense woods and wide open tobacco fields.
Along the way there was very little to be found expect gas stations
and a varied profusion of churches. Texaco and Cross and Crown
Methodist, $3.23 a gallon and John 3:14. The unbeliever still had
a half tank of gas and so had use for neither of these.
It was now quite dark and there was nothing to be seen except
the small patch of road that was illuminated by his headlights. He
passed mile after mile, feeling a little drowsy, but content in the
knowledge that before too long he would arrive at his destina
tion. Then quite suddenly his headlights extinguished and he
found himself hurtling around a corner unable to see anything. In
the half second of darkness that followed he made up his mind
quite definitively that he was going to die. And then, he saw a
great wooden cross lit up in the sky. He would later notice that
across the horizontal part it read "He Died" and down the verti
cal part it continued, "For Your Sins," but right now the light al
lowed him to realize that lie had lost the road and was headed for
a large tree. He swerved, and with the sickening sound of metal
lic scraping, came to a stop.
After a good deal of waiting and pleading on the phone the un
believer was able to get a tow truck dispatched to his car. But the

truck thai came to his salvation was no ordinary one. In the or
ange dim of the emergency lights he could see that the truck had
an extensive custom paint job. The artist had evidently begin
something along the lines of the Sistine Chapel in mind. There
was Jesus bringing up the righteous with his right hand and push
ing the sinners into hell with his sinister one. The mural spread
outward exploring a variety of biblical themes. There was the red
dragon, the judgment, and the lake of fire, complete with an ex
cessively muscular Satan. But more cheerful chords were also
struck including the distributing of the loaves and fishes and the
parable of the prodigal son. And there on the cab door, barely no
ticeable in block lettering: "Carl's Towing and Repair." And here
was Carl himself.
"It looks like you did a number on your car there." The unbe
liever agreed.
Carl attached the car to the tow truck and hoisted it up and
soon the two of them were heading back to town. Carl was quite
friendly and told him that though there weren't any motels near
by he was quite welcome to stay at Carl's house. The unbeliever
was warming up to this fellow and recounted to him what hap
pened to his car.
"You know 1 always told James that cross was too much, not
to mention a right waste of electricity," Carl said. "But he always
had a stubborn holier-than-thou way about him."
The next morning Carl's wife fixed a really delicious breakfast
with warm biscuits and jam.
"This being Sunday, 1 won't be able to start on your car till
after church is done, but 1 was wondering if you'd like to join me
and Mrs. Pinkston at worship services," Carl asked. "Our church
ain't much to look at at, hut the Reverend knows his Good
Book." The unbeliever wasn't much for church going. However,

given the position he found himself in. he thought that it proba
bly wouldn't hurt to go along with them.
The sanctuary couldn't have had more than a dozen rows of
pews but there were high arched ceilings and stained glass win
dows. Light streamed in on all sides and illuminated floating par
ticles in the air, lending the room a dusty grandeur. The service
was more antiquated and rough than those his mother had
brought him to growing up, but the familiar themes and word rep
etitions brought him back to those childhood days. As the rev
erend delved into his sermon it began to develop an appealing ca
dence. His cheeks became Hushed and a rivulet of sweat ran
down his forehead as he worked to engulf the room in the boom
of his voice.
" This is the promise that the Lord makes to us. It doesn't mat
ter that you and 1 are sinners. Every single last person born unto
this world is marked by the stain of original sin. It doesn't matter
what act of vileness we wretched beings have taken upon our
selves to do, what commandments we have broken, what perver
sions of God's holiness we have committed. If we accept the gift
that Christ has given us all can be forgiven. There is only one un
forgivable sin, and that is to have God's spirit shine down upon
you and to turn away from it. To be confronted face-to-face with
His glory and still deny 1 lim. For he that blasphemes against the
Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven."
After church, it only took Carl a few hours to finish repairing
the car. The unbeliever thanked him warmly for his hospitality
and his speedy work. He got back in his car and once again took
up his journey. As he hurtled down the road the unbeliever
smiled, glad to be back on the way to the beach.
