## First Place THAT BABCOCK TOE 
### MATTHEW GILLESPIE 
Today is Thursday, and on Thursday mornings I have to get to the hospital
early so I can watch Dr. Daboub pull thick bags of red and black meat out of
people's chests. I've had this job for a while now, collecting samples of people's
dead lungs, stained jet black with wet tar and shit-caked with cancer. I get lit
tle pieces of the lung, stuff them into special plastic tubes, and then bring them
back to a lab where a team of researchers give each set of tubes a number —
vou can never know the name that belongs to a set of tubes. It doesn't matter
if #529 kept a garden in its backyard, drove its grandkids to soccer or loved the
Yankees; all that matters is that 529 had a 12 inch malignant tumor in its right
lung and that it died 17 days after surgery. That's it.
I'm jolted back to reality bv Daboub barking a command at one of his nurs
es and I look to see the patient's name projected up on the screen: M ARVIN
BA BCOCK/M A LE/69/DO B 12/22/1938/LEITPNEUNECTOMY. They all
have names like that: Marvin, Ethel, Gladys, Walter; names that make you
wonder if these people were ever, at any time during their lives, under the age
of fifty-five. Marvin's entire face and body are covered; all that's exposed is a
gaping hole in his side, held in place by a surgical rib splitter, and the large and
second toes of his left foot poking out from underneath the sheets. They're big
toes, and interesting ones — the second is decidedly longer than the first, with
a proud hammer shape and a decent ring of calluses around the bottom. It's the
kind of toe that runs in a family, the kind of toe that Marvin's daughter proba
bly also has and has always told people is a "Babcock toe."
Like 1 said, on Thursdays I pick up pieces of people's lungs and bring them
back to the team of Scientists so that they can do Science on them in the Sci
ence Lab. I see Daboub reach into Marvin's chest now with the big longs, the
ones that look like they should be turning burgers on the grill but instead are
used to pull loose lungs out of chest cavities. Out it comes, a big black testa
ment to forty-five years of indulgence. 1 wonder how Marvin ended up here. I
wonder if, forty-five years ago, when Marvin was leaning on the jukebox al
Hamburger I leaven after 7th period and waiting for his vanilla shake, when he
took that first Marlboro Red from Peggy the Cute Girl from Math Class and
suckeu it in long and deep, if, you know, he ever thought il would get him here,
in OR#4 of Lutheran I lospital, in 2(M)8 — my God! He must have thought that
we'd all have our own spaceships by now!
Daboub's cutting up the lung now so I can put the pieces of it into tiny tubes
and freeze them in a freezer with three thousand other sets of tiny tubes, all full
of pieces of other people's lungs. The thing sits in a big blue tray filled with ice,
and pretty soon the whole thing — ice, water and the tray — has been stained
bright red. He fiddles with his scalpel and makes some cuts into the tissue, and
it sounds like a bunch of kids stomping around a big mud patch in the rain. He's
telling me to do something, to hold the tubes differently or to give them to him

faster or to stand up straight or to wash behind my ears — whatever it is, 1 don't
hear him. I just keep staring at Marvin's toe. That Babcock toe. Who's waiting
for him in the waiting room? Is it his daughter, the one that always told her
friends that her funny giant second toe was a Babcock thing? What does she
look like? She's probably thin, and I bet she has brown hair down to her shoul
ders and is wearing an aggressive pair of pants. She probably had to resched
ule a meeting to be here with her dad, to be here when they put him under and
wake him up and he realizes that he'll have to wheeze his way through every
day that's left to add to his sixty-nine-year-long life.
I bet that she and I could have been good together — I'd push her hair away
from her eyes and pull her into me tight and tell her that he lived a Long and
Wonderful Life and that this was nothing to be sad about, that we all have our
time and that this was just Marvin's and that she needs to focus on herself —
that's what Marvin would've wanted. I know that if I knew her, if she was my
wife or at least we'd been on a few dates, that I'd have the chance to say these
things to her because I know that Marvin is going to die. 1 know this because
when Daboub cuts into the lung in the dissection tray he usually can make a
deadly accurate snap assessment on somebody's chances: an, "Oh, would you
look at that?" coupled with his thick grey eyebrows pushing up over his large
rimmed glasses was usually a reason to think optimistically, to think that the
cancer hadn't seeped out of the lungs and leaked like sewage into the patients
brain or stomach or bones. L.ikewise, hearing a sigh followed by a, "Shit, he's
dead," was typically reason to think less optimistically. Marvin got a "Shit."
She's sitting outside and she has no one to help her through all this. The doc
tors are going to tell her the same cold way that they tell everybody everything.
I think I really could've softened the blow of this bad news to Rebecca, or
Claire, or whatever his daughter's name ended up being.
Daboub finishes cutting through the lung while a heart rate monitor pulses
loudly. At first I think Marvin got the short end of it here — there's a whole lot
of cancer in there, and no way he can last too much longer with that shitstorm
of filthy disease coursing through him. Then I got to thinking: he's 69, and he's
got a lung full of tar and probably a liver soaked in gin to go with it, all going It)
show that he always knew how to have a good time — what's to mourn about
that? I'm sure there's plenty to look back on — that huge grouper he caught
up on Lake Winnipeckia in '77, that time he won Bears tickets and got to go to
the game with his best buddy Hank six months before Hank's heart attack, the
way Ol' Marvin was always up for a cold beer and some warm conversation.
I'm still thinking of this as the elevator opens and I walk out onto Ontario
Street with fourteen tubes of Marvin's lung tissue tucked under my right arm
in a styrofoam cooler. It's freezing outside; I zip up my too-thin jacket, and just
then, I sec him, up in the O.R. with his face still hidden under surgical dress
ings. The old man is smiling, tucked away warm and safe from the brutal city
winter. I think he'd have made a great father-in-law.
