## Jack Cackler removed from Tree race after bold stunt 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
After a too daring stunt. Jack Cackler '09
has officially been disqualified from Tree
Week.
"[Cacklerj's being booted from Tree Week
and that's final." Scott Bland '10, director of
Public Relations for Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, told The Daily.
A group of former Trees informed Cackler
of the band's decision Wednesday evening.

"I talked to him
about the general
situation in the
sense of where the
band stands on all
of it and where I
stand on all of it,"
said John Whipple
'10. this year's Tree.
"I'm not going to
make a comment
specifically about
what we talked
about."
Candidates
competing to be

next year's Tree were informed of the rules at
the beginning of Tree Week. Whipple said.
"They were given general guidelines," he
said. "You can't set yourself on fire. You can't
get yourself electrocuted."
"The other rule is that you can't send your
self to the hospital." he added."so [do] nothing
that will harm yourself so seriously that you
will need to go to the hospital. That's a general
guideline that can he interpreted however."
On Hiesday, Cackler charged through an
aisle of friends who struck him in the chest with
fluorescent light bulbs in White Plaza.
"Tree stunts are supposed to demonstrate
showmanship and uncommon creativity and
being smart," said Bland, representative of the
band. "All that he proved two days ago was that
he is not particularly creative and not particu
larly smart."
Cackler recognized that the light bulb stunt
was a little too extreme.
"I feel bad because I had intended the ulti
mate focus of my campaign to be more on what
I could bring to the community" he said, "but
all anyone could talk about was the reckless
ness of one of my early stunts.
"While the extremity of one stunt in partic
ular may have been a little misguided," he
added, "each stunt so far has had a specific

quality of character that 1 intended
to demonstrate."
Both Bland and Nanci Howe,
student affairs director in the Office
of Student Activities (OSA), want
ed to stress that this decision was
made solely by the band leadership,
with no involvement on the part of
the OSA.
"1 was certainly concerned
because ... his stunt is something
that the University wouldn't
encourage." Howe said. "But the
band management staff made that
decision [to ask him to step down]."
"The OSA was not involved at
all," Bland seconded. "This was an
internal band decision."
Cackler said that he would not
appeal the band's decision.
"The band has to cover them
selves, and 1 understand that," he
said.
Mostly, though, Cackler wanted
his supporters to know the follow
ing:
"I have greatly enjoyed the
week." he said, "and humbly thank
everyone who helped and support
ed me."
