# Titanic victim speaks through waterbed
## Second Place 
### SCOTT BOLKAN 
II you'd just please listen for a moment, I've a few things to say.
First, I must assure you this was no choice of mine. That is, this whole waterbed busi
ness. If it'd been up to me, I'd have come back as a lion. Best even a young one just ris
ing into his own pride. And if not this, I'd have preferred at least something with some
manner of honor about it.
I explained all this to the secretary at Mediumship when 1 decided I had some things
to communicate to the living. "Edward Moody, 1912," I said, grasping my officer's cap
with my two hands and resting it over my lap. I was handed a form and under "Medium
Preferences," I wrote: Large cats and stately creatures of ocean and land.
Ten years I wait, enduring countless screenings and interviews, and they finally settle
on a waterbed. Of all things, a waterbed! I've yet to make any sense of it. If it's within the
bounds of your imagination, I'd advise you to just as well forget this part of things alto
gether. I am Edward Moody, Seventh Officer of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic.
Oh, for almost one hundred years I was perfectly fine with the state of my being. I'd
left the world young, only a junior officer yet, but I'd carried myself into the next exis
tence with dignity. A test of proper conduct in the face of a civil disaster of great historic
proportions. An officer (rank is of no importance in matters of life and death) down with

his ship. A simple, dignified end. My legacy in the world settled. And then comes along
this American film hell-bent on re-writing history! 1 can tell you. l'rom my own personal
experience on the very ship, the RMS Titanic, that that film is all drama and 110 historical
fact. It's just a film, yes. but it's accuracy is a matter of importance. It's a matter of histo
ry. Of legacy.
It was night. The film managed this correctly. It was quiet too. I didn't wake to the
noise of the collision with the berg. I was awoken by the Second Officer instead. I le took
me to the starboard side where ice piled 011 the deck. Not once did he show alarm. I tell
you, things were orderly and calm. On the deck, the orchestra began to play. (That was
true also, but mind you, it was some lively tune and not that hymnal paced orchestral
from the film.) Women and children were placed on the lifeboats and things were calm
and in order. I'm telling you this because I was there.
The officers had guns. Yes, this is true as well. It is a standard precaution to carry guns
on ship of course. It was important to keep order, understand. Especially under such cir
cumstances. Believe me, the first cabin was calm, but there was panic in the steerage and
it was that portion of the ship that shooting was necessary.
Eight or ten steerage passengers were shot. I shot one. And I had to. It was strictly
women and children in the lifeboats, see. Despicable! 1 low they'd dart left and right for
a boat. Sure there were a handful of male stewards on the boats. But this is all in good
order. It was necessary, please understand. Order was necessary.
