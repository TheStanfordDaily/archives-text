Mrs. Kirkpatrick said that she would buy the beads herself.
For she felt guilty sending the parents out of the classroom while their children
were there, as if she would take advantage of the time alone with them to plant little
pagan seeds of indifference and radical thinking deep in the soft primordial soil of their
brains, so she would go before class. She would buy the beads herself, an early morning
errand, bright sunlight and a deep sense of yawning satisfaction. Jeane could see her ac
tions extending out into the morning, twisting and dividing like oak branches; and it put
a happy tear in the corner of her eye.
She pulled her car through the narrow cement lane next to a drive-thru coffee
shop. Mr. Elva, the morning manager, would tell her about his trysts into the city the
night before when she was a girl working in the shoe store on First street;she would mar
vel at his bravery. "If I'm not here tomorrow, it's because I've been arrested," he would
say. Jeane could tell by his shoes that he would never be arrested. They were too sup
portive, orthotically sound, not the shoes of a miscreant — loosely tied, thinly worn af
fairs. Homeless shoes. Shoes predictive of where a person was going, they were told to
tell their customers. A shoe salesman had never been arrested; Jeane was almost sure
of it, certainly not Mr. Elva. Then again, neither had a Kindergarten teacher. She tipped
a whole dollar and stepped smartly on the accelerator.
The boy in the bead store sat shivering and perched in the corner, loosely draped
with faded sweatshirts. He was watching the drums of beads as one person, somewhere,
must sit watching barrels of wine ferment. He nodded when she came in through the
door, erect, caffeinated, a picture of feminine efficiency, Jeane thought. She saw herself,
as she picked through the drums, and the line of her present actions extending glorious
ly out of the half opened door. There it split and diverged again, seeking a thousand in
dividual paths, each sundered again and again.
Mrs. Kirkpatrick squinted through the harsh sunlight angling in through the win
dows, past the grotesque wooden statues draped with necklaces. The beads watched her
large teeth admiringly with their eyelets. She scooped them up out of their barrels and
then let them slide by the small webbings of her fingers and down to her billowy sleeves.
She longed to buy the beads by the bucket, by the dump-truck full, and fill an old claw
footed bathtub with them, then burrow into the dark, fragrant dryness, wriggle in them
as if they were coffee beans. Oh!
"Three of these then," Mrs. Kirkpatrick said quietly to herself, nodding inwardly

to her self-restraint. She placed the beads in her basket. These beads, she could see
them, carefully made by an indigenous, artistic couple deep in some fragrant jungle,
there are no roads. The beads have to be carried out in a basket balanced on top of
Sada's head. They are so happy together, she thinks, and they give thanks over their
meat to the people who buy these beads. Jeane politely intones, "It's nothing, really."
Mrs. Kirkpatrick will have an activity today, and the results are clear to her. The
beads from the village, from Sada and Seraphim, would be made into necklaces by her
class. She will plant the beads in their soil. Beads and seeds! Two words that sound bliss
fully alike, delving further into the Immaculate Conception that was the English lan
guage. This, too, she felt a part of, a birthmother of first the recognition of letters and
then the foreman of the construction of words. She was helping them string letter-beads
on the string of, the string of what? Jeane wondered. Meaning?
Jeane could see her actions extending. There would be necklaces, heartbreaking
ly clumsy and sincere. They would be, Mrs. Kirkpatrick saw. gifts in a bright sunburst of
baby teeth. Before, quickly, the sediment of years would form. Then, far in the future
the mothers (O mothers! the word, especially in its plural, set her heart fluttering) would
be digging, through the crate paper and clay handprint sediment and they would find
the lost beads, her beads, strung together crudely by a child long since grown. The lined
fingers would caress the beads (these very beads!) They would be tied to such signifi
cance, the same beads she bought on this cold and bright morning. Her responsibility
for these emotions made Jeane smile. She was tied to those mothers, as if she were the
first bead, and they were all subsequent beads — strung together by a definite, individ
ual trajectory. But who would wear my-necklace, the many necklaces created by my life,
Mrs. Kirkpatrick wondered.
She quickly dived her hands ink) another bin, sifting and feeling the beads; these
were long, thin and smooth. A few of these would do. There were olive-beads in the bar
rel adjacent, and chive beads across from those. Candy beads, elephant beads (at quite
a price — perhaps they would lose their simple charm, she thought). The wooden to
kens piled up in her basket. She could see her actions extending haphazardly, crazily.
Would someone ever come digging thought the sediment to find her necklace?
She stopped suddenly, wrist deep in wooden droplets. Can my path — my arrangement
(a masterful one at that!) — ever be examined with wistful, flat-footed nostalgia? Mrs.
Kirkpatrick suddenly felt foolish with her purposeful bag. Some bead crept down her
cheek, its path punctuated by stops and starts, immediately buried deep in the seconds
of the morning.
