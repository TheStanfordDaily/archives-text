## Titus Andronicus: glitz, guts, glamour, iambic pentameter 
### BEN CASEMENT INTERMISSION HAMLET 
The Stanford Shakespeare
Company's production of "Titus
Andronicus" is a visually sumptu
ous, strongly acted rendering of
one of Shakespeare's least popular
plays. Full disclosure: I designed
the costumes. As I watched the play
unfold from in Elliot Program Cen
ter last night. I was impressed, as I
nearly always am. by the depth and
dedication the Shakespeare Com
pany (also known as StanShakes)
brings to their performances. At
the same time. I couldn't help but
reflect on the difficulties of putting
on a difficult play like "Titus," and
the particular problems of student
theater at Stanford.
One critic calculated the accu
mulated atrocities of "Titus": "It
has 14 killings, nine of them on
stage, six severed members, one
rape (or two or three, depending on
how you count), one live burial, one
case of insanity and one of cannibal
ism — an average of 5.2 atrocities
per act, or one for every 97 lines."
I'm not entirely certain of this crit
ic's math (critics do, after all. get
their jobs for being able to write,
not count) and I wonder if the one
act of cannibalism should be count
ed as two — is it how many people

arc eaten, or who eats them?
The point is that "Titus" is a
bloodbath (in fact, during last
night's show a man in the audience
fainted.) It begins like a soap opera,
with family feuds, betrayals and an
elopement, becomes a strangely
contemporary psycho-drama about
the effects of violence and ends in
macabre madness. Throughout, the
audiences wrestles with killing, re
venge and the way both can become
unintentionally hilarious. The
biggest problem with stage violence
today is that everyone's seen it done
better on film. Directors have to
work, then, to get the importance of
violence across in emotional and
psychological terms, rather than
purely visual ones. Instead of enact
ing realistic killings, the actors have
to show its consequences, which I
thought this production did ad
mirably.
"Titus Andronicus" is about
nothing if not the consequences of
violence. At the beginning of the
play, the Roman general Titus (Joe
Camp) returns home from his con
quest of the Goths, bringing as his
captive Tamora, Queen of the
Goths (Anna Terteryan) and her
three sons. He also brings five of his
own sons in coffins and sacrifices
one of Tamora's over their graves.
Meanwhile, a power struggle

plays out between the two sons of
the late Emperor. Decisively, Titus
backs Saturnine (Leo Gold
makher) over his brother
Bassianus (Sashendra Aponso);
Saturnine proposes to Titus's
daughter Lavinia (Roselyn Hal
lett), who instead elopes with
Bassianus, causing Saturnine to
free Tamora and marry her instead.
This allows Tamora, her black
lover Aaron (Fareez Giga) and her
two surviving sons, Chiron and
Demetrius (William Lindeman and
Michael Bateman) to pursue a cam
paign of revenge against Titus and
his family, setting off the string of
rapes, murders and mutilations
which occupy the rest of the play.
And if the events described above
sound frenetic and complicated,
they arc even more so because it all
happens in one extended scene.
More unusual than the play's vi
olence is its strangely inverted nar
rative arc: instead of beginning qui
etly, building to a climax and then
winding down, as a traditionally
formed story does, "Titus" begins
with a near-inexplicable flurry of
action, then enters a quieter middle
section which focuses on the grief
and horror felt by Titus and his re
maining family. In the final acts,
Titus's last remaining son returns to
Rome with an army of Goths, set

ting off the final round of action
which ends, predictably enough for
a Shakespeare tragedy, with a heap
of bodies.
Director Nisa Ari brought an
unusual twist to this production by
including a soundtrack of Baroque
opera. Surprisingly, it's the perfect
complement to the play's grit and
squalor: Rome comes alive in a
wash of gold and red, arias and or
chestral interludes washing over
the audience with an aural sumptu
ousness that envelopes the action
on-stage. Further subtext is provid
ed by short video clips projected
onto an ornate screen above the ac
tors' heads; though sometimes
roughly transitioned, they provide
an innovative way out of some the
play's problems, such as how to
convincingly show a rape.
On the whole, the production is
very strong, the greatest limiting
factor being the space in which it is
staged. The Elliot Program Center
is ideal for dance rehearsals and
other smaller events, but staging a
play in its cramped confines is a
challenge on all sorts of levels, not
least of which is making room for

an audience.
The Shake
speare Company

always searches
for larger spaces for

its Winter show and usu-
ally fails, because there sim-

ply are not enough medium- ~
sized performance spaces on

campus made available to stu
dents. If the University is as serious

as it claims about promoting the
arts, it might hold off on its new
performing arts center — proba
bly reserved for visiting whiz
bangs like Itzhak Perlman and the
St. Laurence Quartet — and work
on giving more support to the stu
dent-run groups, which, as last
night showed, have no shortage of
audience members, but nowhere to
put them.
Titus Arulronicus runs through
Sunday. Shows arc at 8 PM, with an
extra show Friday at 10. Tickets are
free and can he reserved online at
