### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEXY SCRIBE 
Roxy is not really the literary type. She's al
ways found that time spent lost between pages is
not nearly as much fun as time spent writhing be
tween sheets. However, there are exceptions —
Roxy is quite the fan of erotic literature.
While there is some high-end product in the
field (think DH Lawrence). Roxy's tastes tend to
be a little more down market. She prefers porno
pulp to erudite erotica — as one enlightened boy
pointed out a few years back, you don't want to
have to worry about staining leather bound hard
backs if you get involved in the text.
These days, Roxy gets her fix from the Inter
net. There arc many places a girl can have fun, but
Roxy's personal favorite is literotica.com. Oh,
Literotica, with your carefully indexed stories in
easy-to-understand categories, how Roxy loves
you. As best as Roxy can figure, the authors are all
amateurs who take time out of their days to help
keep her hot and bothered. (Roxy finds the ama
teur authorship pleasing; professionals are all too
often concerned with pretty prose instead of pro

ducing suitably pulsating pornography.)
As Roxy has alluded to above, her most fa
vorite thing about literotica.com is the careful cat
egorization of stories. Topics vary from the mun
dane ("Erotic Couplings") to the ever-so-slightly
less mundane ("Group") all the way to the inter
esting ("Incest" and "Non-Consent/Reluc
tance"). Needless to say, Roxy's interest lie with
the interesting.
Now, Roxy is certainly no shrinking violet
when it comes to other forms of porn. She's defi
nitely into dirty pics and videos. Especially the
homemade kind. However, she finds that pictures
of double penetration aren't quite as stimulating
as the proverbial thousand words on the same
subject. It's so much easier to put yourself in the
scene when it's on paper (hey. if it's electronic,
you can even produce a personalized version),
and Roxy's always liked to join in.
What's more, while the pause, fast forward,
rewind and slow motion buttons get extensive use
on Roxy's DVD player, she finds it distracting to
have to push buttons when she'd prefer to be
pushing buttons. With words on the page, Roxy
can read the bits she likes over and over and over
again; sometimes slow, sometimes fast. She can
skip the plot, or edge her way through the tantaliz
ing build up, eventually reaching the spectacular
climax. So many options.
Actually, Roxy's real reason for favoring erot

ic lit over other forms of pornography is discre
tion. It's pretty hard not to freak out your room
mates when you start watching "Jenna Does Car
men" on the big-screen TV. And trust Roxy when
she tells you that portable DVD players arc not
nearly as private as you might think.
With printouts, on the hand — well, it just
looks like you're reading a paper. Roxy flies a lot,
and she gets restless on planes. However, armed
with a few pieces from Literotica, a good blanket
and a spare hand, she finds that flights go by so
much quicker. Likewise <mi the train, or in the
backseat while the parents drive to Grandma's.
Class, too, is a lot more fun when "Double Trou-

ble" is deftly inserted into the
Physics 41 textbook.

So if you're like

thing, follow her I

you're struck by a I
desire to curl up

with a good book, try a
more exciting genre.
