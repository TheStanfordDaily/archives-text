## "Barlett" doesn't cure blues 
### KAT LEWIN INERMISSION PILL POPPER 
It must be difficult to make a
quirky, bittersweet high-school black
comedy while standing in the shadow
of "Juno" — one of the most success
ful (and rightfully so!) examples of the
genre ever made. Had "Charlie
Bartlett" been released a year, or
even six months ago, perhaps it would
have smaller shoes to fill. Or maybe it
just wouldn't be getting any attention
at all.
The film centers on the title char
acter (superbly played by Anton
Yelchin), a troubled but idealistic
teenager who has gotten kicked out of
every private school he has ever at
tended. His mother (Hope Davis) is
too absorbed with new-age psychoba
bble to figure out how to raise him, his
father is out of the picture for reasons
that slowly become evident and Char
lie is left to the whims of public school
and his own almost dangerously en
trepreneurial spirit.
At first, Charlie is ridiculed by his
public school peers for wearing a blaz
er and carrying an attache — offenses
that end in those standard-fare issues
of high school torture that movies
love to portray but that no one has ac
tually witnessed. (Have you or any
one you know ever gotten a swirlie?
And if Stanford kids aren't the
picked-on poindexters of high school
movie lore, I don't know who is.) But
Charlie finally achieves the populari
ty he seeks by doling out psychotrop
ic drugs to the lonely, alienated teens
around him. Which, in high school, is
just about everybody.
1 le also runs afoul of substance
abusing Principal Gardner (Robert
Downey, Jr., brilliant as always) — in
no small part by dating his daughter,
Susan (the luminous Rat Dennings).
But don't go thinking that
"Bartlett" is just "Rushmore" on Ri
talin: it straddles the line between
comedy and drama, and it deals with
serious issues — substance abuse,
family dynamics, clinical depression
— reasonably well before dashing to
its inevitably hey-guys-life-is-awe
some-because-high-school-doesn't-
last-forever last act.
"Charlie Bartlett" is a smart
movie, but it isn't a smart comedy.
The movie makes a big deal of chron
icling our flippant, pill-popping, high
ly insecure generation, then tries to
fool our modern sushi-and-Red-Bull
psyches with clunky, heavy, pot-roast
comedy. It preaches that young peo
ple are lonely and more sophisticated
than they are given credit for. then ex
pects us to laugh at predictable
nuggets of dramatic irony, menstrual
blood and. not one, hut two sequences
of naked Ritalin dancing. The lowest

point of the film's humor comes with
a character who plays Down's Syn
drome for comedy — did I miss some
thing, or is this still in incredibly bad
taste? —in a series of scenes that
grow increasingly strained and un
pleasant.
But for every questionable joke,
there is a moment of quiet drama that
works supremely well. Yelchin is im-

possible to
take your eyes
off of. His
physical come
dy is delightful
ly high-energy,
and his every
gesture con
tributes to a
character who
is likeable and
authentic. If

nothing else, this movie is a staggering
recommendation for checking his
complete filmography out of Green.
(Start with "Alpha Dog.")
The best scenes in the movie fea
ture Yelchin squaring off against
Robert Downey, Jr.: both men are
dramatic powerhouses, and their rap
port is tense and stunning. Their final
stand-off at the movie's climax man
ages to be both funny and deeply
moving.

The other standout performance is
Charlie's bully-turned-business-part -
ner Murphey Bivens (Tyler Hilton —
not that Hilton, though), who begins
the film as a rather one-note character
but rapidly evolves to show surprising
roundedness. He will steal your heart
like he stole your bike.
This is a movie that leaves you
thinking of other, better movies. The

idea of a naive
teen struggling
to find his
place with a
substance
abusing au
thority figure is
compelling —
but why not
just watch
"Wonder
Bovs," which

does all that with better writing? And
still features Robert Downey, Jr. to
boot.
But the superb ensemble perfor
mances arc what ultimately save
"Charlie Bartlett" from its clumsy,
sometimes trite construction and
comedic misfires. Although 1 didn't
walk out of the theatre with a satisfy
ing, unified view of "Charlie" as a
film, it is impossible not to leave a lit
tle in love with Charlie as character.
