# The 						director is in: Q & A with John Poll
## 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION PATIENT 
INT: What drew you to this pro
ject?
JP: Well, 1 spent a long time look
ing for it. 1 read a hundred scripts try
ing to look for the one that would re
ally connect, and in that time 1 read
two 1 really liked. One was "Juno,"
ironically, which a few people have
seen now. What "Charlie" had that
got me excited was that 1 laughed and
I was moved. It had a lot of humor
and a lot of heart. It had a lot on its
mind. 1 liked the challenge of making
a film with a lot of mixed tones that
had serious issues. The thing that re
ally got me was that it was optimistic.
INT: "Charlie" does have a lot on
its mind. How did you strike the bal
ance between comedy and the very
serious themes?
.IP: I went with my gut. When we
were in prep 1 told the cast and crew
that we weren't really making a com
edy and we went with that — it sur
prised people. Really it's a character
piece, and if we went with drama, the
comedy would come from that. In
terms of performances, we were
never reaching for jokes — except in
some of the physical comedy with
Anton [Yelchin]. I encouraged him to
act like a 17 year old, which really he
was. But he usually plays older in
movies and he's kind of the father in
his own family. Both Anton and
Charlie have a wisdom beyond their
years and that's a lot of what helped
make the movie work.
How did 1 balance it? 1 cast Anton
and Robert (Downey, Jr.] and Kat
Dennings. They were all really good,
especially Anton and Robert, at mix
ing the tones in scenes. They had the
ability to play a serious scene with
comedic elements

INT: I've got to ask. Robert
Downey, Jr.: greatest actor of our
time. What was it like working with
him?
.IP: I hat's an understatement. It
was amazing. I got everyone in the
movie I wanted in every part. To have
Robert Downey, Jr., in your first
movie? I think it's all downhill from
here. Actors respond to material and
this was a strong script. I know he had
read the script and he liked it. 1 was
scouting locations in Toronto and the
crew were watching me, thinking: "Is
he going to be able to talk Robert
Downey, Jr., into being in the
movie?" The first thing I said to him
was: "Twenty years ago, you would
have been the star of this movie," and
he was not unaware and he didn't dis
agree.
I asked if he'd play an authority
figure, which he's never done before.
He was aware of all the ironies of it.
He does some stuff in this movie that
deals with his own troubled past, and
he didn't shy away from that. He went
for it. Robert used to say: "As long as
I get to play, I'm happy," and that's
really what he wanted. He just want
ed the room to try things and I'd be an
idiot not to let Robert Downey, Jr.,
try anything he wanted.
INT: What was your inspiration
for the movie?
.IP: Can I talk about Gustin [Nash,
the screen-writer and co-producer]?
I'm not 26 and he's not even 26 any
more, I'm 49 and he was 26 four years
ago. He went to USC film school like
1 had and was trying to figure out
what he was doing with his life. He
was at the mall working with
teenagers, and when he talked to
them, they would say that they saw
every teen movie and they were al
ways disappointed. They felt spoken
down to, like there weren't people
