they knew on the screen. Part of his
inspiration for making the film was to
make a movie that those people
would feel was authentic, and I think
that's an inspiration everyone in
volved in the film felt in line with. 1
hope we're putting something out
there that does have an authentic teen
voice even though we're not a terribly
realistic movie — we do play fast and
loose for the sake of humor — I think
it's grounded.
INT: I've heard a lot of buzz that
Charlie Bartlett is the new Ferris
Bueller. How much inspiration did
you draw from classic teen come
dies?
JP: I'm not a huge teen movie fan
and it's a huge compliment to even
be mentioned in the same sentence
as John Hughes, who is so beloved
and has created a series of films that
a whole generation responded to.
There's a lot of discussion on the in
ternet of films "Charlie Bartlett"
supposedly references, most of
which I've never seen. One that was
a real inspiration and I used in my
pitch as an example of how I wanted
it to play was the Hal Ashby film

"Harold and Maude." It was the mix
of tones and having scenes that had
darkness and light mixed together
and tones that shift radically. I think
in some cases we did very well with it,
and in some we did not so well. But
we always kept trying to have some
humor in the midst of darkness and
vice versa.
There's all this stuff on the inter
net about how Charlie has sunglasses
on and his arms behind his neck and
that's a direct steal from "Ferris."
And Ferris and Charlie do both be
come the oddball messiah leaders in
their school, but the only thing I can

say is that Ferris pulls it off and Char
lie fails miserably. The thing I like
about Charlie is he starts off looking
for popularity and that's what leads
him down the paths to these unusual
ways to be popular. What he finds is
he has a gift of empathy and he lis
tens to people, and really that's what
the movie's about. Wouldn't it be
nice if everybody had somebody to
listen to them? Gustin and I always
believed Charlie would go on with
this gift, and 1 hope if we check in
with Charlie Bartlett 20 years from
now, he wouldn't be dealing drugs.
He would be helping people.

Write for Intermission! Intermission writers get
paid (not a lot) to: interview celebrities, preview
hot movies, go out to dinner, listen to albums and
make fun of lame things they hate. Writing for In
termission will basically be the greatest romance of
your collegiate career.
