## "Be Kind Rewind" steels year heart like it stole its premise 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION POP CULTURE BARON 
It has all been
done before.
Everything that

there is to be said has been said, to be
thought or felt or considered

has been thought and felt
and considered. Nowhere
is that more apparent

than in the world
of entertainment,
where any film
that is successful

is promptly copied
by every other studio in Hol
lywood. When lamenting
the fact that there

is no new materi
al left, most Hol
lywood types will
say things like "The
Simpsons already

did it" or "That's
just Star Wars meets

James Bond." "Be Kind Rewind," the new movie by "Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" director Michel Gondry, doesn't copy any of
these things. But it does copy Nickelodeon.

That's right. The Amanda Show, the Nickelodeon sketch-com
edy show that launched Amanda Bynes into the troposphere
of C-list teen stardom, was doing "Be Kind Rewind" long
before it was considered cool. In one of the show's sketch
es, Bynes and her co-stars played a family of video store
owners who film their own versions of popular movies.
Though the mis-

guided entre
preneurs claim

that their ver
sion is "better;
much better!!" than
: • i *i_ _ •

the original, their cus-

tomers often don't feel the same
way. Hilarity ensues.

Set this skit in Passaic, New Jersey,
throw in Jack Black magnetized by a bat-

tle with a power transformer and drive the plot with the threat of
the store's closure, and you've got "Be Kind Rewind." The
movie, which also features Mos Def and Danny Glover, centers
around Be Kind Rewind Video Store, which rents VHS tapes for
a dollar a night. Needless to say, in the modern era of DVDs and
High Definition, the store makes about a dollar a day. It is also
located in a crumbling tenement, which city developers want
to demolish, despite owner Mr. Fletcher (Glover)'s claims

that jazz pianist Fats Waller was born in the building. The
store's troubles are only increased when the aforementioned
magnetized Jerry (Jack Black) comes into the store and de
magnetizes all the tapes. Desperate, store manager Mike
(Mos Def) and Jerry begin to film themselves all the tapes

that people want to rent. They figure that it is a useless at
tempt to maintain business, but within days these "swed
ed" films (that's what they call them; don't ask me why)

are a cult hit sweeping Passaic

Soon, the whole town is involved

in filming the quirky re-makes, and it

is at this point in the movie that "Be

Kind Rewind" begins to rise above its
fun but rather silly premise. Through the in-

creased business that has come from "swed-,
ing" such films as "Ghostbusters," "Rush/
Hour 2" and "Driving Miss Daisy," Bey

Kind Rewind is on its way to raising
money to save itself from demolition and 1

rekindling in the citizens of Passaic a

sense of community and self-ex-

pression. In developing the quiet.
and melancholy hope of the^

town, "Be Kind Rewind" truly j
excels. The movie's final J

scene, which features the,
whole town watching a Fats J
Waller documentary they I

all made, is one of the most
sincere and touching mo- i

ments in recent cine-,
matic memory. Paying!

homage to a scene from "Cinema Par
adiso," Michel Gondry shows us the main
characters watching the movie inside, then
pans to reveal the entire town looking in from
the street, watching through the window. It isj
an evanescent, transcendental moment,^

which very nearly saves "Be Kind a

Rewind" from mediocrity.

Unfortunately, otherj

aspects of the film pull it back down into the®
moray. The first is its aforementioned lack of

originality. Now. it may seem nit-picky or even objection
able for me to harp on a comparison to a show that no
body remembers and few even watched, but when a
movie centers itself so strongly on a "hook," it is impossi
ble not to be annoyed at the fact that the moviemakers
aren't quite as clever as they thought they were. The sec
ond problem with "Be Kind Rewind" is that it is simply
full of holes. Characters pop in and out of the movie at

random. Relationships arc begun arbitrarily and then just as arbitrarily ended.
Sigourney Weaver comes out of God-knows-vvhere wielding a copyright in
fringement lawsuit and runs over all the "sweded" tapes with a bulldozer. It
seems clear that Michel Gondry and the editors of "Be Kind Rewind" were
much less interested in the veracity and continuity of the film than its emotion
al core; while they succeeded in creating a strong sense of character and place,
in doing so they made a film that is frustratingly random.
"Be Kind Rewind" appeals to audiences as a quirky, kind of dorky comedy
with a premise that at least most people have not seen, but it soon realizes that
man cannot live on watching two idiots try to recreate "Men in Black" alone;
it has to take the movie to a place that actually resonates with people. It docs
so, and in doing so nearly achieves greatness. But along the way, it sacrifices
the things that achieve goodness. Ultimately, "Be Kind Rewind" is probably
worth watching, but it could be "better; much better!!"
