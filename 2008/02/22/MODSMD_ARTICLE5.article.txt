# Cardinal Baseball Preview
## STANFORD LEADS OFF 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It may still be February, but the boys of summer
will be out in full force this weekend as Stanford
baseball kicks off its 2008 campaign with a four
game series against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at
the newly renamed Klein Field at Sunken Dia
mond.
The Feb 22 start is the latest that Stanford has
ever begun a season, as NCA A rule changes this
year pushed back the starting date to make the
schedule more fair to teams from colder climates.
The 2(X)8 Cardinal squad is looking to rebound
from a 2(X)7 season which saw them finish 28-28 (9-
15 Pac-10) and miss the NCAA tournament for the
first time since 1993. The Card struggled both on
the mound and in the field last year; however, the
bats got hot at the end of the season, plating 104
runs during a 9-1 finish.

Last season the struggles came not so much
from cold bats as they did from poor pitching and
shaky defense — especially in the infield. The
team's fielding percentage of .963 and ERA of 6.01
both ranked last in the Pac-10; the lofty ERA was
the worst in Stanford baseball history.
There is reason to be optimistic that these num
bers will improve, though, as Stanford is returning
29 players from last season's squad — including 13
of 14 pitchers.
"The teams that do well in any conference are
the teams that have veterans coming back," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We know we have
good players, and we'd like to think that they will
get the job done this year. F or as to have a good sea
son, our older players have to have their best years.
That's when you get into the postseason."
Probably the biggest returning name for Stan
ford is junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff. Ratliff hit
.339 last year while starting 55 games for the Card.

He also finished in the top-10 in the Pac-10 in runs,
total bases, triples, at-bats and slugging percentage.
Joining Ratliff in the outfield will be junior Joey
August (343,27 RBI last year) and senior Brent
Domaracki (.310,20 RBI). Junior Jeff Whitlow and

sophomore Toby Gerhart will also see time.

The infield is looking to put the sloppy defense
of last year behind it.and will be returning four

starters —junior Jason Castro, sophomore

Adam Gaylord, junior Brent Milleville and

junior Cord Phelps. As a rookie at shortstop
last year,Gaylord hit .283 and turned in some
spectacular plays in the field, but also record
ed 10 errors.

Phelps played at second, third and short last sea
son, but probably will stay at second this year. 1 le
has a solid bat — hitting .301 last season — but
needs to improve on his 16 errors. Castro and

GAME NOTES: This is the first game of the sea
son for Stanford. The Cardinal finished with
a .500 record last season and missed the
playoffs for the first time since 1993. Stan
ford returns 29 players from last year's team

Stanford Daily File Photo
Stanford will rely on returning
players, and more specifically,
their pitching and improved
defense this season as they

look to succeed in
the highly competi
tive Pac-10.


Milleville will rotate between first and
catcher and are solid defensively at both
positions. Castro is hoping to bounce
back from a sophomore season that saw
his average drop from .283 to just .167.
Senior Randy Molina will also see time
at first as well as DH. Junior Austin
Yount will man third base.
"We flat out need to play better de
fense on the infield this season,"stressed
Marquess."Playing good defense in the
infield will be one of the keys in deter
mining how much success we have in
2008."
llie other area which needs to show
significant improvement is the Cardi
nal's production on the mound. Junior
southpaw Jeremy Bleich will be the
opening day starter, and is looking to
improve last year's 2-8 record and 5.56
ERA. Right-handers sophomore Jef
frey Lnman (4-4,5.74 ERA) and senior
Erik Davis (4-2,5.29 ERA) also return
from last vear's rotation and will look to

trim down their ERAs. Senior right
hander David Stringer (3-2,4.70 ERA,7
5V.61.1 IP. 41 K) returns to anchor the
bullpen and could also be seen in the ro
tation on occasion.
"The name of the game is pitching,"
Marquess said." We weren't very consis
tent there, as well as on defense. We
need to shape that up to be successful."
To complement these four, the Car
dinal has loaded its roster with 19 more
pitchers, and many of them will see sig
nificant action this season with the ab
breviated schedule. The season is start
ing three weeks later than it has in the
past, but will still consist of 56 games,
making the need for extra arms great.
"No one knows how much the con
densed season will affect any of us," said
Marquess." We are going to be forced to
pitch lots of guvs. Playing four games a
week is difficult on the players academ
ically.and with five games a week we just
don't know how they are going to react
to it."
Stanford has the challenge of playing
in one of the country's best conferences.
The Pac-10 has four teams ranked in
the preseason top 10 (No. 1 UCLA, No.
2 Arizona. No. 7 Oregon State and No. 9

Arizona State), and these opponents
will account for half of the Cardinal's 24
conference games. Oregon State has
also won back-to-back College World
Series championships.
"The Pac-10 is probably the
strongest it has been in 25 years," Mar
quess said. "Most of the teams in the
conference have almost everyone back
and are really pitching rich. We think
we're stronger, more capable and more
talented than we were last year, but so
does just about everyone else.This con
ference is going to just be a monster."
But before Stanford has to contend
with its conference foes.it must navigate
a difficult pre-conference play schedule,
starting this weekend against Nebraska.
Nebraska ended last season hot as well,
winning five of their last six, and reached
the finals of the NCAA Tempe Region
al.lhe Huskers are relatively young, re
turning just 14 of their 34-man roster.
Nebraska comes into this weekend's
opener ranked No. 38 after finishing
sixth in the Big-12 last season. The
Huskers have also won six consecutive
season openers, although this is the first
time they have opened a season in Cali
fornia.
Senior right-hander'lliad Weber will
start the opener for the Huskers. Weber
didn't allow a run in his first 12 inning of
work last year before finishing 1-2 with
a 5.62 ERA in 24 innings. Stanford leads
the all-time series with Nebraska 4-1.
and the two teams haven't met in the
regular season since 1993.
The season begins with a double
header at Sunken Diamond today, with
the first game scheduled for 2 p.m.. and
the second to start 30 minutes after the
conclusion of the first. The teams will
then face off again on Saturday at 2 p.m.
and Sunday at 1 p.m.

will be out in full force this weekend as Stanford
baseball kicks off its 2008 campaign with a four
game series against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at
the newly renamed Klein Field at Sunken Dia
mond.
The Feb 22 start is the latest that Stanford has
ever begun a season, as NCA A rule changes this
year pushed back the starting date to make the
schedule more fair to teams from colder climates.
The 2(X)8 Cardinal squad is looking to rebound
from a 2(X)7 season which saw them finish 28-28 (9-
15 Pac-10) and miss the NCAA tournament for the
first time since 1993. The Card struggled both on
the mound and in the field last year; however, the
bats got hot at the end of the season, plating 104
runs during a 9-1 finish.

Last season the struggles came not so much
from cold bats as they did from poor pitching and
shaky defense — especially in the infield. The
team's fielding percentage of .963 and ERA of 6.01
both ranked last in the Pac-10; the lofty ERA was
the worst in Stanford baseball history.
There is reason to be optimistic that these num
bers will improve, though, as Stanford is returning
29 players from last season's squad — including 13
of 14 pitchers.
"The teams that do well in any conference are
the teams that have veterans coming back," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We know we have
good players, and we'd like to think that they will
get the job done this year. F or as to have a good sea
son, our older players have to have their best years.
That's when you get into the postseason."
Probably the biggest returning name for Stan
ford is junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff. Ratliff hit
.339 last year while starting 55 games for the Card.

He also finished in the top-10 in the Pac-10 in runs,
total bases, triples, at-bats and slugging percentage.
Joining Ratliff in the outfield will be junior Joey
August (343,27 RBI last year) and senior Brent
Domaracki (.310,20 RBI). Junior Jeff Whitlow and

sophomore Toby Gerhart will also see time.

The infield is looking to put the sloppy defense
of last year behind it.and will be returning four

starters —junior Jason Castro, sophomore

Adam Gaylord, junior Brent Milleville and

junior Cord Phelps. As a rookie at shortstop
last year,Gaylord hit .283 and turned in some
spectacular plays in the field, but also record
ed 10 errors.

Phelps played at second, third and short last sea
son, but probably will stay at second this year. 1 le

GAME NOTES: This is the first game of the sea
son for Stanford. The Cardinal finished with
a .500 record last season and missed the
playoffs for the first time since 1993. Stan
ford returns 29 players from last year's team

Stanford Daily File Photo
Stanford will rely on returning
players, and more specifically,
their pitching and improved
defense this season as they

look to succeed in
the highly competi
tive Pac-10.


Milleville will rotate between first and
catcher and are solid defensively at both
positions. Castro is hoping to bounce
back from a sophomore season that saw
his average drop from .283 to just .167.
Senior Randy Molina will also see time
at first as well as DH. Junior Austin
Yount will man third base.
"We flat out need to play better de
fense on the infield this season,"stressed
Marquess."Playing good defense in the
infield will be one of the keys in deter
mining how much success we have in
2008."
llie other area which needs to show
significant improvement is the Cardi
nal's production on the mound. Junior
southpaw Jeremy Bleich will be the
opening day starter, and is looking to
improve last year's 2-8 record and 5.56
ERA. Right-handers sophomore Jef
frey Lnman (4-4,5.74 ERA) and senior
Erik Davis (4-2,5.29 ERA) also return
from last vear's rotation and will look to

trim down their ERAs. Senior right
hander David Stringer (3-2,4.70 ERA,7
5V.61.1 IP. 41 K) returns to anchor the
bullpen and could also be seen in the ro
tation on occasion.
"The name of the game is pitching,"
Marquess said." We weren't very consis
tent there, as well as on defense. We
need to shape that up to be successful."
To complement these four, the Car
dinal has loaded its roster with 19 more
pitchers, and many of them will see sig
nificant action this season with the ab
breviated schedule. The season is start
ing three weeks later than it has in the
past, but will still consist of 56 games,
making the need for extra arms great.
"No one knows how much the con
densed season will affect any of us," said
Marquess." We are going to be forced to
pitch lots of guvs. Playing four games a
week is difficult on the players academ
ically.and with five games a week we just
don't know how they are going to react
to it."
Stanford has the challenge of playing
in one of the country's best conferences.
The Pac-10 has four teams ranked in
the preseason top 10 (No. 1 UCLA, No.
2 Arizona. No. 7 Oregon State and No. 9

Arizona State), and these opponents
will account for half of the Cardinal's 24
conference games. Oregon State has
also won back-to-back College World
Series championships.
"The Pac-10 is probably the
strongest it has been in 25 years," Mar
quess said. "Most of the teams in the
conference have almost everyone back
and are really pitching rich. We think
we're stronger, more capable and more
talented than we were last year, but so
does just about everyone else.This con
ference is going to just be a monster."
But before Stanford has to contend
with its conference foes.it must navigate
a difficult pre-conference play schedule,
starting this weekend against Nebraska.
Nebraska ended last season hot as well,
winning five of their last six, and reached
the finals of the NCAA Tempe Region
al.lhe Huskers are relatively young, re
turning just 14 of their 34-man roster.
Nebraska comes into this weekend's
opener ranked No. 38 after finishing
sixth in the Big-12 last season. The
Huskers have also won six consecutive
season openers, although this is the first
time they have opened a season in Cali
fornia.
Senior right-hander'lliad Weber will
start the opener for the Huskers. Weber
didn't allow a run in his first 12 inning of
work last year before finishing 1-2 with
a 5.62 ERA in 24 innings. Stanford leads
the all-time series with Nebraska 4-1.
and the two teams haven't met in the
regular season since 1993.
The season begins with a double
header at Sunken Diamond today, with
the first game scheduled for 2 p.m.. and
the second to start 30 minutes after the
conclusion of the first. The teams will
then face off again on Saturday at 2 p.m.
and Sunday at 1 p.m.
