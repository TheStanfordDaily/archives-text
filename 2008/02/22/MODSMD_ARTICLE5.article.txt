# Cardinal Baseball Preview
## STANFORD LEADS OFF 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It may still be February, but the boys of summer
will be out in full force this weekend as Stanford
baseball kicks off its 2008 campaign with a four
game series against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at
the newly renamed Klein Field at Sunken Dia
mond.
The Feb 22 start is the latest that Stanford has
ever begun a season, as NCA A rule changes this
year pushed back the starting date to make the
schedule more fair to teams from colder climates.
The 2(X)8 Cardinal squad is looking to rebound
from a 2(X)7 season which saw them finish 28-28 (9-
15 Pac-10) and miss the NCAA tournament for the
first time since 1993. The Card struggled both on
the mound and in the field last year; however, the
bats got hot at the end of the season, plating 104
runs during a 9-1 finish.

Last season the struggles came not so much
from cold bats as they did from poor pitching and
shaky defense — especially in the infield. The
team's fielding percentage of .963 and ERA of 6.01
both ranked last in the Pac-10; the lofty ERA was
the worst in Stanford baseball history.
There is reason to be optimistic that these num
bers will improve, though, as Stanford is returning
29 players from last season's squad — including 13
of 14 pitchers.
"The teams that do well in any conference are
the teams that have veterans coming back," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We know we have
good players, and we'd like to think that they will
get the job done this year. F or as to have a good sea
son, our older players have to have their best years.
That's when you get into the postseason."
Probably the biggest returning name for Stan
ford is junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff. Ratliff hit
.339 last year while starting 55 games for the Card.

He also finished in the top-10 in the Pac-10 in runs,
total bases, triples, at-bats and slugging percentage.
Joining Ratliff in the outfield will be junior Joey
August (343,27 RBI last year) and senior Brent
Domaracki (.310,20 RBI). Junior Jeff Whitlow and

sophomore Toby Gerhart will also see time.

The infield is looking to put the sloppy defense
of last year behind it.and will be returning four

starters —junior Jason Castro, sophomore

Adam Gaylord, junior Brent Milleville and

junior Cord Phelps. As a rookie at shortstop
last year,Gaylord hit .283 and turned in some
spectacular plays in the field, but also record
ed 10 errors.

Phelps played at second, third and short last sea
son, but probably will stay at second this year. 1 le
has a solid bat — hitting .301 last season — but
needs to improve on his 16 errors. Castro and
