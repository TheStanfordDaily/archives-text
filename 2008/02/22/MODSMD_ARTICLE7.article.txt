■ tanford women's basketball team's
at-home winning streak may be due
to a lueky halftime show, according to
■ members of a Stanford dance class.
m The Stanford soul line dancers have
112 appeared at games in Maples Pavil
ion over the last three years.
"Each time that we've danced, the Stan
ford women have won," said LaDoris
Cordell J.D. '74, special counselor to the
President for campus relations and the
founder of the soul line dancers.
Cordell joked that the group brings
about the sporting successes.
"We dance, they win?' she said. "Is there
is a causal link? Absolutely."
The line dancers practiced last Saturday
morning in a near-empty Maples Pavilion
before the women's basketball game
against Arizona State.Twenty-odd dancers,
mostly middle-aged, hurried to the middle
of the court and began moving to Michael
Jackson's "Bad."
Wearing red or maroon shirts embla
zoned with "Stanford" or "Stanford soul
line dancer," the dancers grinned and
grape-vined. They danced in two parallel
rows, all doing the same move at the same
time.
"I'm bad, I'm bad. I'm really bad," sang
Michael Jackson.
The line dancers concluded their per
formance with a bow.
"Check your shoes." Cordell called.' We
can't leave any marks on the court."
Line dancer Sally Hayman said when
she first joined the dance group, she asked
about the difference between line dancing

and soul line dancing.
"They told me 'Soul line dance is line
dance with attitude,'" she said.
Jewel Lucas is a retired security-trading
specialist and the instructor for the Stan
ford soul line dancers. She also teaches soul
line dance classes on weekdays in Oakland.
"It's good exercise and good people,"
she said, adding that Stanford's line
dancers come from places as far away as
Hayward, Oakland and San Francisco.
Cordell started the group in 2002 after
participating in a soul line dance class in
San Jose.
"We have all colors, sizes and shapes,"
she said, adding that the dancers range in
age from their 20s to their 80s. Cordell said
the group is about more than just dancing
"We're about bringing people together
who ordinarily would not have even spo
ken to one another," she said. "We're about
bridging the gap between the Stanford and
non-Stanford communities."
Cordell said that the class started with a
half-dozen people but now has 40-50 regu
lars at class each week. More than 400 peo
ple have come to the class at least once
since it began. In addition to performing at
women's basketball games, the line dancers
also perform every year at Stanford's
Dance Marathon.
The line dancers have class for two
hours every Saturday morning in the Elliot
Programming Center. Newcomers are wel
come and advised to bring water and soft
soled shoes.
The group has a devoted following at
the women's basketball games, according
to Cordell.
"The crowd goes nuts," she said.
