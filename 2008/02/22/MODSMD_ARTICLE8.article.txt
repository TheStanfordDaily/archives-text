# Broaden your eHorizons
## Student group explores venture capitalism 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
Does Silicon Valley — a
world of startups in our
own backyard — make
Stanford students feel a
greater pressure to per
form? Undeniably, our ties to this in
dustry offer extraordinary opportuni
ties. But what if you're not an over
achieving student, one who has al
ready started a company balancing
both work and academics? What if you
want to explore the world of startups
but don't know where to begin? I low
do you approach the right people for
guidance?
That's where the BASES e-Hori
zons program — a campus organiza
tion aimed at providing a more realis
tic portrayal of entrepreneurial life
after Stanford — comes into the pic
ture.
The program, comprising 15 core
members and 30 auxiliary ones, is de
signed with an emphasis on exploring
the workings of both biotech and
cleantech startups. In winter, the group
concentrates on the biotech industry,
and in spring, the focus shifts to the
cleantech, or alternative energy, indus
try.
"There is too great a focus on high
tech entrepreneurships while biotech
and cleantech startups have such great
growth potential," said Khurram Ma
schkl M.S. '08. vice president of com
munity development in e-Horizons.
"This is why the e-Horizons program is
focusing on introducing Stanford stu
dents to entrepreneurships within
these industries that are under-tapped
and have an immense future."
Thee-Horizons program involves
trips to startup campuses around the
area, where students interact with
company management and are ex
posed firsthand to the inner workings
of Silicon Valley.The field trips are fol
lowed by mentored discussions over
dinner with the company representa
tives, when the participants can reflect
upon their understanding of the busi
nesses explored that day.
"These are invaluable opportuni
ties for students at Stanford to learn
about these growing industries,debrief
with fellow students and understand
how they can play an active part in the
growth of startups in the Valley," said
Ryan Tong '09, an officer of the pro
gram. "And although the members
vary in experience level, the events as
sume the students know nothing and
start from scratch so students aren't

overwhelmed by the information but
instead understand the entrepreneur
ial process in its entirety"
Thee-Horizons program, which
was T<>ng's brainchild, was co-founded
by Masood and Richard Lo '11. In its
first year, the program has attracted
immense talent and interest in venture
capital (VC). with the members rang
ing from freshmen to business and law
school students.
"Diversity is an important aspect of
the group we select because startups
are never founded only by technical
students," Masood said."We hope that
by bringing together students with
such diversity in interest,ideas and age,
they will combine to form compatible
teams and start companies of their
own."
On Feb. 6, 18 members of thee-
Horizons program had dinner with a
panel of four patent lawyers at Bing
ham McCutchen, a nationwide law
firm.The panel was led by Bill Abrams,
a consulting professor of Law at Stan
ford and the new managing director of
the Silicon Valley division of Bingham.
The panel discussed a number of legal
issues involved in starting, funding and
exiting startups, including approaching
VCs with ideas, obtaining technology
patents and structuring businesses.
Varun Sivaram' 11, who has been inter
ested in VC funding since interning at
a solar energy firm, Nanosolar, last
summer, considered the law firm visit
an invaluable experience.
"Management at the law firm took
us through all stages of what an entre
preneur would have to do to establish
a startup, from the seed to the exit and
both from the legal as well as the VC
point of view," he said. "Their explana
tions on how to finance such a compa
ny, with an emphasis on financials,
were so meticulous in description and
analysis that it felt like it was a quarter
long course condensed into two
hours."
"Thee-Horizons program is about
learning about companies firsthand,
about getting an inside view and actu
ally seeing versus just hearing about
it,"Tong said. "It's great to hear speak
ers talk about the entrepreneurial spir
it within the appropriate context; this
experience takes entreprcneurship to
another dimension leading into a sus
taining discussion about the intricacies
of establishing startups."
On Feb. 15, e-Horizons visited Mohr
Davidow Ventures, a VC firm that in
vests in biotech, cleantech and other
technology companies. The talk was
about different types of investing in
biotech space, future development of

biotech industries, biotech diagnostics
and the role they would play in person
alizing treatment.
Douglas Jones, a doctoral student in
Bioengineering, found it interesting to
get direct insight into the business and
legal aspects of startups.
"Sitting down for a small group dis
cussion with the VCs gave great insight
into how they think: how they look at a
new venture and why they have shifted
to funding later stage startups and
shorter payback periods," Ji >nes said." I
think a key advantage of the e-Hori
zons programs is that the informal,
roundtable format enables a focused
discussion targeted to the young entre
preneur about the practical business
and legal considerations involved in a
biotech startup."
Upcoming events include a visit to I>S9
Renewable Petroleum, a biotech com
pany that develops technology to
make biodiesel, and afterwards, a trip
to Plug and Play, a technology incuba
tor.
"Thee-Horizons program is more
than just a talk; it is a tour of the facili
ties, concrete discussions in the appro
priate setting and an interactive oppor
tunity' for students to learn from the

expe
riences of
professors
and employ
ers as well as
fellow stu
dents," Tong
said.
Excited
about ex
ploring the
world of
startups
and
proa c h -
ing VCs —
for all
that -
money ?

Does Silicon Valley — a
world of startups in our
own backyard — make
Stanford students feel a
greater pressure to per
form? Undeniably, our ties to this in
dustry offer extraordinary opportuni
ties. But what if you're not an over
achieving student, one who has al
ready started a company balancing
both work and academics? What if you
want to explore the world of startups
but don't know where to begin? I low
do you approach the right people for
guidance?
That's where the BASES e-Hori
zons program — a campus organiza
tion aimed at providing a more realis
tic portrayal of entrepreneurial life
after Stanford — comes into the pic
ture.
The program, comprising 15 core
members and 30 auxiliary ones, is de
signed with an emphasis on exploring
the workings of both biotech and
cleantech startups. In winter, the group
concentrates on the biotech industry,
and in spring, the focus shifts to the
cleantech, or alternative energy, indus
try.
"There is too great a focus on high
tech entrepreneurships while biotech
and cleantech startups have such great
growth potential," said Khurram Ma
schkl M.S. '08. vice president of com
munity development in e-Horizons.
"This is why the e-Horizons program is
focusing on introducing Stanford stu
dents to entrepreneurships within
these industries that are under-tapped
and have an immense future."
Thee-Horizons program involves
trips to startup campuses around the
area, where students interact with
company management and are ex
posed firsthand to the inner workings
of Silicon Valley.The field trips are fol
lowed by mentored discussions over
dinner with the company representa
tives, when the participants can reflect
upon their understanding of the busi
nesses explored that day.
"These are invaluable opportuni
ties for students at Stanford to learn
about these growing industries,debrief
with fellow students and understand
how they can play an active part in the
growth of startups in the Valley," said
Ryan Tong '09, an officer of the pro
gram. "And although the members
vary in experience level, the events as
sume the students know nothing and
start from scratch so students aren't

overwhelmed by the information but
instead understand the entrepreneur
ial process in its entirety"
Thee-Horizons program, which
was T<>ng's brainchild, was co-founded
by Masood and Richard Lo '11. In its
first year, the program has attracted
immense talent and interest in venture
capital (VC). with the members rang
ing from freshmen to business and law
school students.
"Diversity is an important aspect of
the group we select because startups
are never founded only by technical
students," Masood said."We hope that
by bringing together students with
such diversity in interest,ideas and age,
they will combine to form compatible
teams and start companies of their
own."
On Feb. 6, 18 members of thee-
Horizons program had dinner with a
panel of four patent lawyers at Bing
ham McCutchen, a nationwide law
firm.The panel was led by Bill Abrams,
a consulting professor of Law at Stan
ford and the new managing director of
the Silicon Valley division of Bingham.
The panel discussed a number of legal
issues involved in starting, funding and
exiting startups, including approaching
VCs with ideas, obtaining technology
patents and structuring businesses.
Varun Sivaram' 11, who has been inter
ested in VC funding since interning at
a solar energy firm, Nanosolar, last
summer, considered the law firm visit
an invaluable experience.
"Management at the law firm took
us through all stages of what an entre
preneur would have to do to establish
a startup, from the seed to the exit and
both from the legal as well as the VC
point of view," he said. "Their explana
tions on how to finance such a compa
ny, with an emphasis on financials,
were so meticulous in description and
analysis that it felt like it was a quarter
long course condensed into two
hours."
"Thee-Horizons program is about
learning about companies firsthand,
about getting an inside view and actu
ally seeing versus just hearing about
it,"Tong said. "It's great to hear speak
ers talk about the entrepreneurial spir
it within the appropriate context; this
experience takes entreprcneurship to
another dimension leading into a sus
taining discussion about the intricacies
of establishing startups."
On Feb. 15, e-Horizons visited Mohr
Davidow Ventures, a VC firm that in
vests in biotech, cleantech and other
technology companies. The talk was
about different types of investing in
biotech space, future development of

biotech industries, biotech diagnostics
and the role they would play in person
alizing treatment.
Douglas Jones, a doctoral student in
Bioengineering, found it interesting to
get direct insight into the business and
legal aspects of startups.
"Sitting down for a small group dis
cussion with the VCs gave great insight
into how they think: how they look at a
new venture and why they have shifted
to funding later stage startups and
shorter payback periods," Ji >nes said." I
think a key advantage of the e-Hori
zons programs is that the informal,
roundtable format enables a focused
discussion targeted to the young entre
preneur about the practical business
and legal considerations involved in a
biotech startup."
Upcoming events include a visit to I>S9
Renewable Petroleum, a biotech com
pany that develops technology to
make biodiesel, and afterwards, a trip
to Plug and Play, a technology incuba
tor.
"Thee-Horizons program is more
than just a talk; it is a tour of the facili
ties, concrete discussions in the appro
priate setting and an interactive oppor
tunity' for students to learn from the

expe
riences of
professors
and employ
ers as well as
fellow stu
dents," Tong
said.
