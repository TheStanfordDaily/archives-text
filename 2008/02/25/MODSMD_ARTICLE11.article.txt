## Students initiate new round of compostable ware 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Starting this week, Olives and The
Alumni Cafe will use only compostable
service ware, thanks largely to the efforts of
Dawn Kwan '09 and Dayoung Lee *09 of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford.
Kwan and Lee originally came up with
the idea of introducing compostable prod
ucts to campus eateries in their freshman
Program in Writing and Rhetoric class,
"The Politics of Food." Over the past two
years, they have worked with Moonbean's,
Ciao! and Stanford Dining to try to get as
many campus eateries as possible to adopt
compostable products.
Last year, with help from other students
and dining staff. Kwan and Lee constructed
cost-benefit analyses of using composta
bles, organized volunteers to monitor eater
ies and began educating fellow students
about the importance of using compost
bins correctly. Despite their efforts, imple
mentation of compostable service ware in
large dining facilities like Tresidder proved
unmanageable, and the service ware was

discontinued.
"The problem is that if
compostables go into a nor
mal trash can, they won't
compost," Kwan said. "Even

though we had volunteers
directing people about what to
do with their trash at lunch [at
Tresidder], when we weren't
there, people were throwing

the wrong things in bins."
Undeterred, the pair has
continued working to find
an ideal sustainable launch
ing ground for com-

postable products.
"Right now we're
starting out small, and try -

ing to expand." said Kwan
regarding the pair's efforts

at The Alumni Cafe and
Olives. "At these places, the
program will be more con
tained and easier to control."

The compostable forks, knives, spoons
and take-out containers are made from
sugar-cane fiber bagasse, potato and corn

starch.
According to Erin
Gaines, sustainable foods
Ct.. r, f,l

coordinator tor Mantord
Dining, using these com
. postable products has a

112 number of positive envi
ronmental impacts, in
addition to reducing the
amount of waste that sits
in a landfill.

Though Stanford dining
will incur a slightly higher
cost by switching to com
postables, Kwan said that the
pay-off is worth it.

I"The compost service
[ ware is slightly more expen
sive than regular, but, on the
other hand, it's good publicity
for the cafes," she said. "Also.

the cost of dumping normal
waste in a landfill is measured by

weight. The weight of waste in
both of these cafes will he a lot lower with
so much going to composting."
Many employees and students that fre-

quent these facilities are already on board
with the new program.
"Before we launched the compostables
program at Olives and Alumni, we received
numerous comments a week from students
complaining about waste in the cafes," said
Gaines. "The managers of Olives and
Alumni — Lupe Pena and Ani kish — are
very dedicated to reducing waste by using
compostables. They believe it is the right
thing to do despite the higher costs."
But for kwan and other members of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Olives
and I"he Alumni Cafe are only the begin
ning.
"Stanford is a big community, and using
entirely compostable products would set a
good example for other universities and
institutions," kwan said, 'if feedback is
positive, we could get Axe and Palm and
then maybe Tressider in the coming
months."
"We really want before we graduate for
all cafes to use compostables," she said.
