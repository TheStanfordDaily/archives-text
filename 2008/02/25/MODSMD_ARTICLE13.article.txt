## Law Prof. Lessig decides not to run for Congressional seat 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig announced
on his blog today that he would not run for the
I louse of Representatives seat vacated by the death
of Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.).
Just five days ago, Lessig launched an Internet
frenzy by posting a video on his blog announcing
that he was considering a Congressional run. This
time, a more somber video explained that defeating
former state senator Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) in the
campaign would be nearly impossible.
In his video, Lessig said that it would be a chal
lenge to convince voters "to vote for me instead of a
person who has spent 30 years of her life in extraor
dinary public service."
Winning votes in a district that had never heard
of him and never heard his message would be too
difficult, Lessig said, especially in a compressed 30-
day campaign leading up to the Apr. 8 special elec
tion.
Lessig was blunt about his chances of defeating
Speier. saying in his video that there was "no possi
ble way" he would succeed against the most popular
politician in the area.
The professor, however, remained optimistic that
his efforts to change Congress would succeed. He
said that he was humbled and inspired by the out
pouring of support for his campaign.
Ultimately. Lessig decided that losing big in the
first step of his Change Congress crusade would do
more harm than good to his movement.
"We need to recognize that changing Congress is
the hardest political challenge we as a nation face,"
Lessig said in the video. "It's not something that can
happen overnight. It's not something that can hap
pen in even 30 days."
