While many bemoan the high cost of movie the
ater popcorn, a new study from researchers at
Stanford's Graduate School of Business (GSB) and
UC-Santa Cruz says that, in fact, high prices help the
average moviegoer in the end.
Hie study found that by charging more for con
cessions such as popcorn, movie theaters were able
to keep ticket prices lower. Because secondary prod
ucts like popcorn cost more, the primary product, the
movie experience itself, can be cheaper — and. as a
result, more people are able to experience the silver
screen magic. For the theaters, this means more peo
ple come to the movies in general, as well as greater
profits from those willing to pay for concessions.
While concessions account for only about 20 per
cent of gross revenues, they represent some 40 per
cent of theaters' profits.
GSB Associate Prof. Wesley Hartmann and
Ricard Gil. assistant professor in economics at UC-
Santa Cruz, looked at detailed revenue data from a
chain of movie theaters in Spain to conduct their
