## Nader announces White House bid 
### HOPE YEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Ralph
Nader on Sunday announced a
fresh bid for the White House,
criticizing the top contenders as
too close to big business and dis
missing the possibility that his
third-party candidacy could tip
the election to Republicans.
The longtime consumer advocate
is still loathed by many
Democrats who accuse him of
costing Al Gore the 20(H) election.
Nader said most people are
disenchanted with the
Democratic and Republican par
ties due to a prolonged Iraq war
and a shaky economy. He also
blamed tax and other corporate
friendly policies under the Bush
administration that he said have
left many lower- and middle-class
people in debt.
"You take that framework of
people feeling locked out, shut
out, marginalized, disrespected,"

he said. "You go from Iraq, to
Palestine/Israel, from Enron to
Wall Street, from Katrina to the
bungling of the Bush administra
tion. to the complicity of the
Democrats in not stopping him on
the war. stopping him on the tax
cuts."
Nader, who turns 74 later this
week, announced his candidacy
on NBC's "Meet the Press."
In a later interview with The
Associated Press, he rejected the
notion of himself as a spoiler can
didate. saying the electorate will
not vote for a "pro-war John
McCain." He also predicted his
campaign would do better than in
2004. when he won just 0.3 per
cent of the vote as an independ
ent.
"This time we're ready for
them," said Nader of the
Democratic Party lawsuits that
kept him off the ballot in some
states.
Democratic candidates Barack
Obama and Hillary Rodham

Clinton quickly sought to portray
Nader's announcement as having
little impact.
"Obviously, it's not helpful to
whomever our Democratic nomi
nee is. But it's a free country," said
Clinton, who called Nader's
announcement a "passing fancy."
Obama dismissed Nader as a
perennial presidential campaign
er. "He thought that there was no
difference between Al Gore and
George Bush and eight years later
I think people realize that Ralph
did not know what he was talking
about," Obama added.
Republican Mike Huckabee wel
comed Nader into the race.
"I think it always would proba
bly pull votes away from the
Democrats, not the Republicans,"
the former Arkansas governor
said on CNN.
