## Editorial Board Evaluating the new Old Union 
### 
It has been about six months since Old
Union was completed after years' worth
of ongoing — and sometimes frustrating
— construction.To the relief of students and
administrators alike. Old Union has general
ly become a place students are using and
using often. Scarcely a moment passes when
students are not stopping by the Axe & Palm
for a snack, sprawling out on the lobby's
couches to finish a problem set. meeting in
one of the many conference rooms or drop
ping off checks at the Stanford Student En
terprises office.
That said. Old Union has by no means
gone off without a hitch. Students still com
plain bitterly about the closing of the Col 10.
lamenting the loss of its cozy warmth. The
overly simplistic system of reserving meeting
space favors the first group that reaches the
schedule sheet, leaving many without access
to space. Blank, sterile walls give the en
trance hallway a sense of impatient formality
— a formality that many argue does not befit
a student union.
Now. before institutional inertia freezes
Old Union in its current state, we must eval
uate how happy — or unhappy — we are
with our new student union. Most important
ly. how can we change the space to make it
better?
The sterile atmosphere that pervades the
union is easily the number one student com
plaint about Old Union, and adding some
sense of warmth would be neither difficult
nor expensive. The walls can easily be filled
with art produced by students, but the ques
tion is what sort of style we want. Perhaps the
walls should feature pictures of sporting
events, student groups in action or famous
Stanford traditions and rites of passage.
Meeting Services, which runs the operation
of the unions themselves, should consider
asking student groups to submit art to deco
rate Old Union. SOCA, the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts, would proba
bly welcome the opportunity to have its
members begin a rotating arts display.
We are not qualified to be interior design
ers. but the bottom line is that Old Union still
feels more like Meyer Library than the
CoHo, and something should be done to rem

edy this problem. Already, students are read
ing and talking about the temporary exhibit
in Old Union titled "Speak Up. Speak Out:
I low Much Are You Willing to Tolerate?" —
making it clear that students welcome such
displays. Finding a way to adorn the empty
yellow walls would be a giant step in the right
direction. Either the ASSU or Meeting Ser
vices should make this a continuing priority
while improving the "atmosphere" may
seem like a less tangible project than others,it
is obviously something that students care
about and a topic on which students have
consistently voiced concerns.
The procedure for securing meeting space
is another major concern regarding Old
Union.To be fair, one of the great advantages
of the new Old Union is the wide variety of
places for meetings and conferences. One of
the equally great disadvantages is that stu
dents have a hard time taking advantage of
this space. Meeting space has been hit-or
miss for most groups. The schedule sheet
process, which requires someone to physical
ly come to the Union to sign up for space,
would be much more user-friendly if it were
available online.
Admittedly, putting the process online
might open a can of worms. Because the cur
rent process for reserving rooms elsewhere
on campus is notoriously difficult — requir
ing dual levels of approval — the simplicity
of reserving meeting rooms at Old Union is
welcome. Hopefully, we can avoid this level
of red tape for Old Union while simultane
ously making the system more accessible.
In addition to those spaces that are incon
venient to reserve, other spaces are difficult
to access at all. The large common room on
the third floor, for example, requires a code
to get in. Why can't this space be made avail
able to students and student groups through
out the day?
Overall, we are happy with the way Old
Union has turned out. The building includes
good study spaces, a significant number of
group work areas and the gorgeous third
floor Sanctuary. Given these successes, it is
time to focus on improving the remaining de
ficiencies to make Old Union a place that
everyone can utilize and enjoy.
