# Pleading Inanity
## O, my God 
### 
In 1 11 days, 15 hours, 12 minutes, and 4.3 sec
onds, the 54-year young Oprah Gail Win
frey-Sridharan will descend on a cloud,
thunderbolt in hand, to address the denizens of
this fair University Some claim that the pres
ence of her goddaughter in the graduating
class was the "hook," others wonder aloud if it
was my favorable mention of the O, the Oprah
Magazine piece, in "The Love List," in my col
umn two weeks ago. No need to split hairs, I
say, let's just get ready to go O-to-O with this
mbgul.
If the latest issue of O is any guide, Oprah's
speech will be filled with pithy, ostensibly
vapid exhortations to help us find breathing
space, lose weight and build up our self-worth,
which hopefully one day will also approach the
2.5 billion dollar mark. In anticipation of her
arrival, I decided to work up some ideas for her
remarks. O-Dubbs, if you're reading this, and 1
know you are, feel free to quote liberally come
June.cuz I 'm 'bout to gift you some change you
bet you can Xerox.
(Standingovation] "Thank you.'Thank you.
Thank you. You're too much, thank you.
Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.
"Thank you. President Hennessy. honored
faculty.distinguished alumni who have donated
more than $300,000, other alumni,and the most
important people here today, the future of this
great nation, the ('lass of 2(X)8. undergraduates
of Stanford University!
"I know there are graduate students here
too, but no one cares about them, am I right?
[Standing ovation] That's right! Lemme hear
it! [pause for effect]
"Ya know, it was only 21 some odd years
ago that I sat where you do now. eager, grin
ning. brimming with potential, ready to take
the world by the sack, tie it to a stick and toss
it over my shoulder. Like many of you. I had to
overcome many an obstacle just to get to this
point. I was born to a poor unwed teenage
mother. I became pregnant as a teen. I exper
imented with hard drugs. But let me tell you, I
don't regret a single day of it. for on the way
from rural Mississippi to a 170,(XX) square
meter ocean-view estate in Montecito, I

learned a thing or two. So if you want to make
$80 million a year — and I know you do, you
money-hungry, soulless sell-outs — listen up
and take notes.
"The first lesson I learned from my times of
turmoil is to be open to all kinds of love. My
closest companions don't fit society's mold —
my main man, Stedman Graham, is my life
partner and nothing more. People often con
fuse my extremely intimate relationship with
Gayle King as being sexual. I imagine at least
partly because her name starts with "gay" Best
of all, when I say "Jump!" 45 million middle
aged housewives say "Off what?" and it's this
unconditional love and support that makes my
life joyous.
"My second message for all you kids
about to hit the job market is not to change
yourself to fit your job, but to change your
job to fit you. When 1 first started out in
broadcast journalism, I was criticized for cry
ing on the air while reporting tragedies and
for my extensive ad-libbing. I stuck to what
felt right, however, and look at me now!
Every time I goad a guest on my show into a
maudlin confession, one of Oprah's Angels
gets its wings.
"Which leads me to my last and most impor
tant point. If you remember nothing else from
this speech, which is probably the most elo
quent oratory since the Odyssey, remember
this: give generously to those who are less for
tunate than you. Stanford Class of 2008,1 think
that if you take a long, hard look at the world
around you. you'll see that the category of the
less fortunate includes almost evervone."
