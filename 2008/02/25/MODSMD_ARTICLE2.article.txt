# Prof. hopeful on N. Korea
## Hecker visits nuclear facility, declares progress being made in disarmament 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
North Korea is serious about taking steps
to denuclearize but will not proceed much
further until the US. makes several impor
tant concessions, reported Management
Science & Engineering Prof. Siegfried S.
Hecker. the former director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory, after a private trip to
the country earlier this month.
Accompanied by Joel Wit. a former State
Department official, and Keith Luse, a
staffer for Senator Richard Lugar (R-lnd.),
Hecker spent four days in North Korea to
assess compliance with an Oct. 3 six-party
agreement.
The extraordinary level of access granted
to Hecker led him to believe that North
Korean denuclearization will be permanent.
"The access we were granted to the

nuclear facilities combined with the serious
ness of the disablement actions convince
me that North Korea is prepared to perma
nently shut down its nuclear facilities in
Yongbyon," Hecker told The Daily in an
email. "That will mean no more bombs and
no better bombs as long as they don't test
again."
A visit to the Yongbyon Nuclear Center
left Hecker satisfied that the North Koreans
are making real progress.
"The disablement actions at the three
key nuclear facilities are almost complete,"
Hecker told reporters at a Stanford press
conference on Feb. 20. "I judge these to be
serious actions that will require significant
time and effort to restart the facilities."
Hecker described the process of shutting
down the Center as a positive one.
"We found the level of cooperation
between the DPRK [Democratic People's

Republic of Korea] nuclear specialists and
the U.S. team that is supervising the disable
ment to be excellent," he said. "Until the
slow-down, the two sides struck the proper
balance between doing the job expeditious
ly and doing it safely."
The slow-down is a result of North
Korea's perception that the United States is
not fulfilling terms of the Oct. 3 six-party
talks, along with lingering frustration at

being labeled part of President Bush's "axis
of evil."
The North Koreans are refusing to offer
a complete declaration of their nuclear pro
gram until they feel that the terms of the
Oct. 3 agreement are met and their nation is
removed from the official U.S. list of state
sponsors of terror.
"The DPRK is not prepared to present a
complete list [of their nuclear capabilities]

until the other parties meet their obliga
tions in the Oct. 3 agreement," I lecker said.
The disagreement over fulfillment of the
agreement is relatively straightforward.
North Korean officials allege that they have
not received 300,000 tons of heavy fuel and
other energy-related equipment that was
promised in the six-party talks, which
