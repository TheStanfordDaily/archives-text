# Prof. hopeful on N. Korea
## Hecker visits nuclear facility, declares progress being made in disarmament 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
North Korea is serious about taking steps
to denuclearize but will not proceed much
further until the US. makes several impor
tant concessions, reported Management
Science & Engineering Prof. Siegfried S.
Hecker. the former director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory, after a private trip to
the country earlier this month.
Accompanied by Joel Wit. a former State
Department official, and Keith Luse, a
staffer for Senator Richard Lugar (R-lnd.),
Hecker spent four days in North Korea to
assess compliance with an Oct. 3 six-party
agreement.
The extraordinary level of access granted
to Hecker led him to believe that North
Korean denuclearization will be permanent.
"The access we were granted to the

nuclear facilities combined with the serious
ness of the disablement actions convince
me that North Korea is prepared to perma
nently shut down its nuclear facilities in
Yongbyon," Hecker told The Daily in an
email. "That will mean no more bombs and
no better bombs as long as they don't test
again."
A visit to the Yongbyon Nuclear Center
left Hecker satisfied that the North Koreans
are making real progress.
"The disablement actions at the three
key nuclear facilities are almost complete,"
Hecker told reporters at a Stanford press
conference on Feb. 20. "I judge these to be
serious actions that will require significant
time and effort to restart the facilities."
Hecker described the process of shutting
down the Center as a positive one.
"We found the level of cooperation
between the DPRK [Democratic People's

Republic of Korea] nuclear specialists and
the U.S. team that is supervising the disable
ment to be excellent," he said. "Until the
slow-down, the two sides struck the proper
balance between doing the job expeditious
ly and doing it safely."
The slow-down is a result of North
Korea's perception that the United States is
not fulfilling terms of the Oct. 3 six-party
talks, along with lingering frustration at

being labeled part of President Bush's "axis
of evil."
The North Koreans are refusing to offer
a complete declaration of their nuclear pro
gram until they feel that the terms of the
Oct. 3 agreement are met and their nation is
removed from the official U.S. list of state
sponsors of terror.
"The DPRK is not prepared to present a
complete list [of their nuclear capabilities]

until the other parties meet their obliga
tions in the Oct. 3 agreement," I lecker said.
The disagreement over fulfillment of the
agreement is relatively straightforward.
North Korean officials allege that they have
not received 300,000 tons of heavy fuel and
other energy-related equipment that was
promised in the six-party talks, which

involve North Korea, South Korea,
China, the U.S.. Russia and Japan.
The issue of North Korea's
place on the list of state sponsors
of terror is more complex. The
Bush administration has refused
to remove North Korea from the
list until it complies with the Oct. 3
agreement and officially declares
its nuclear program. North Korea
will not submit a declaration
unless Bush removes it from the
list first.
Despite these roadblocks.

Hecker indicated that North Korea
hopes to make progress on the path
to denuclearization and complete
fulfillment of the terms of the six
party talks.
"We were told that the DPRK
wants these obligations [to deliver
fuel and energy equipment] to be
met quickly so they can move into
the dismantlement stage," Hecker
said.
While in North Korea, Hecker
and his colleagues also discussed the
future of the North Korean workers
at the Yongbyon center.
"At Yongbyon, we discussed a
range of possibilities for the future
of the workers once the facilities
are dismantled," Hecker said.
"These discussions represent a

good first step. Our DPRK hosts
mostly listened and responded to
our ideas."
Meeker is hopeful for the future
of North Korean denuclearization.
"I remain optimistic about denu
clearization on the Korean
Peninsula, but it will most likely
take a long time," I lecker told The
Daily.
"Nevertheless, right now we are
moving in the right direction," he
added. "It was only 15 months ago
that North Korea defied the world
and detonated a nuclear device. We
have made a lot of progress since
that time."
