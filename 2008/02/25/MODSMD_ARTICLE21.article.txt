## Pick me for vice president! 
### 
The leading presidential candidates —
Barack Obama and John McCain —
have probably created vice-presiden
tial search committees by now, in order to
scope out the minor governors and lesser sen
ators who will best allow the candidates to
pander specifically to one geographic region
or demographic.
So many names are being tossed about
that it's hard to keep track of who is even a se
rious VP candidate. Obama seems to be con
sidering everyone from Ohio Governor Ted
Strickland to Kansas Governor Kathleen
Sibelius to Arizona Governor Janet Napoli
tano. McCain appears to be considering Min
nesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and pretty
much every Southern governor. Has anyone
heard of these people? Didn't think so.To the
average American voter, I am as well-known,
which is to say. not at all. Ibat's why 1, Stuart
Baimel, should be considered for Vice Presi
dent of the United States of America.
Hie search for a vice president is always
fraught with high drama — John Kerry
picked the Southerner John Edwards as his
running mate, and they proceeded to lose
every Southern state by at least 10 points.
George W. Bush, if you remember, put Dick
Cheney in charge of his V.P. search commit
tee, and Cheney promptly chose himself. A 1
Gore picked Joe Lieberman, who was so
scarred by the experience that he now en
dorses John McCain.
The amount of time it takes a presidential
candidate to choose a vice president, howev
er, has no relation to the amount of power the
office holds. Anyone who watches football
knows the role of the backup quarterback: to
hold the clipboard and attempt to look rele
vant. Everyone knows he isn't. Cheney has, to

a great degree, redefined the office, but it's
much more due to Cheney-as-political-oper
ator than Cheney-as-Vice-President. He
would be just as powerful if he were in the
Cabinet. Whoever will be next V.P.. the office
will be far less relevant.
Barack Obama or John McCain should
still pick me for vice president, though —
both of them, preferably, or at least one. I
think I am a good candidate for the job and
will be an asset on the campaign trail.
It's unlikely, however, that either will put
me in charge of their vice-presidential search
committee. This is a shame. A travesty. I'm
pretty much overqualified for it, as I clearly
think about being vice president a lot. and, as
I have discovered throughout my life, think
ing about things generally makes you good at
them. Maybe they are hesitant because they
know that 1 would dispense with the formali
ties and just pick myself.
"Obama-Baimel 2008" has a ring to it,
doesn't it? In any case, Obama makes the
case that there is an inverse relationship be
tween judgment and experience. Hillary
Clinton is more experienced and therefore
possesses worse judgment (or is she less judg
mental?). No one has less political experi
ence than I do. Thus, no one has better judg
ment than I do. Whenever I offer an opinion,
I offer it assertively and forcefully, usually

with no evidence or past experience at all. I
am always right.
I can offer John McCain a lot as well. He's
71. I'm 21. Nothing spells "successor" like a
vice president who is significantly younger
than the president. McCain appears to be
considering Minnesota Governor Tim Paw
lenty, who is 47 and would clearly be his
anointed heir. Forty-seven is still pretty old,
though, and he'll be pushing 55 in 2016. But 1
can offer youth now and youth two terms
later. Plus, McCain is sometimes regarded as
a Washington insider, and there is no one, no
one, who is farther from the Beltway than I
am. unless you count people in Alaska and
Hawai'i (and I don't).
There will be one little problem with the
Constitution — apparently you have to be 35
to be the Veep.The Paultards. during my war
of attrition on them,claimed I "don't have re
spect for the Constitution," but they're
wrong. I have a lot of respect for the Consti
tution, but 1 know it can be changed. Maybe I
can slip in unnoticed on an Obama-Baimel or
McCain-Baimel ticket. I can even grow an
enormous moustache to look older. I'll have
to face the law in 2016. though, when I run for
president and face greater scrutiny. But by
then I'm sure the Constitution will be
amended to allow Arnold to run for presi
dent, just in time for me to defeat him in a na
tionally televised best-of-seven arm
wrestling match.
TWo-term Kansas Governor Kathleen
Sibelius has a chance — why not me?

is currently waiting by his cell phone, expecting
some calls any minute now. You can also reach
