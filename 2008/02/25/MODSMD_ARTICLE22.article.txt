## Nader announces pres. candidacy 
### HOPE YEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€” Ralph Nader
on Sunday announced a fresh bid for
the White House, criticizing the top
contenders as too close to big busi
ness and dismissing the possibility
that his third-party candidacy could
tip the election to Republicans.
The longtime consumer advocate is
still loathed by many Democrats who
accuse him of costing A 1 Gore the
2000 election.
Nader said most people are disen
chanted with the Democratic and
Republican parties due to a pro
longed Iraq war and a shaky econo
my. He also blamed tax and other cor
porate-friendly policies under the
Bush administration that he said
have left many lower- and middle
class people in debt.
"You take that framework of peo
ple feeling locked out, shut out, mar
ginalized, disrespected," he said.
"You go from Iraq, to Palestine/Is
rael, from Enron to Wall Street, from
Katrina to the bunuling of the Bush

administration, to the complicity of
the Democrats in not stopping him
on the war, stopping him on the tax
cuts."
Nader, who turns 74 later this week,
announced his candidacy on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
In a later interview with The Asso
ciated Press, he rejected the notion of
himself as a spoiler candidate, saying
the electorate will not vote for a "pro
war John McCain." He also predicted
his campaign would do better than in
2004, when he won just 0.3 percent of
the vote as an independent.
"This time we're ready for them,"
said Nader of the Democratic Party
lawsuits that kept him off the ballot in
some states.
Democratic candidates Barack
Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton
quickly sought to portray Nader's an
nouncement as having little impact.
"Obviously, it's not helpful to
whomever our Democratic nominee
is. But it's a free country," said Clin
ton, who called Nader's announce
ment a "passing fancy."
Obama dismissed Nader as a

perennial presidential campaigner.
"He thought that there was no differ
ence between AI Gore and George
Bush and eight years later 1 think
people realize that Ralph did not
know what he was talking about,"
Obama added.
Republican Mike Huckabee wel
comed Nader into the race.
"1 think it always would probably
pull votes away from the Democrats,
not the Republicans," the former
Arkansas governor said on CNN.
Nader said Obama's and Clinton's
lukewarm response was not surpris
ing given that both political parties
typically treat third-party candidates
as "second-class citizens." Nader said
he will decide in the coming days
whether to run as an independent.
Green Party candidate or in some
other third party.
Pointing a finger at Republicans,
he described McCain as a candidate
for "perpetual war" and said he wel
comed the support of Republican
conservatives "who don't like the war
in Iraq, who don't like taxpayer dol
lars wasted, and who don't like the
