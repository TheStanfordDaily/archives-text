## Wyndam Makowsky Combine: 40-yard relevant? 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Scouts, coaches and general man
agers Hooded the RCA Dome in In
dianapolis last weekend to watch the
NFL Combine, the annual draft eval
uation event. Although many schools
hold pro-days and players participate
in individual workouts, the Combine
is believed to provide the best pre
draft assessment: the conditions are
the same for all the athletes invited to
attend.
It is an unforgiving process in
which draft stocks can shoot up or
plummet in a matter of minutes — as
soon as a player finishes a drill, he is
instantly compared to his peers.Their
college successes are put on hold as
they try to prove that they have the
strength, speed and agility to succeed
at the next level.
In addition to weigh-ins and team
interviews, there are seven workouts
at the Combine, although no one is
forced to do any of them. The sexiest
drill is the 40-yard dash, whose name
is fairly self-explanatory: players run
40 yards in a straight line and are
timed at the 10.20 and 40 yard marks
to see how well they accelerate. For a
skill position player,anything 4.5 sec
onds or below is very good. A time
lower than 4.25 seconds is inhuman,
but a finish above 4.65 will raise some
question marks.
Because, 1 reckon, of how easy it is
to understand, the 40-yard dash is the
most popular measurement of speed
by fans and media alike.
But its simplicity is also its down
fall: it is not an accurate judge of
game speed.
Rarely will a player run 40 yards
untouched in a game. The play with
the most amount of straight running
is a wide receiver on a fly route. Even
then, he will likely hump with thecor
nerback within the first 10 yards and
will continue to grapple with him as
they race down field. It is hardly in a
straight-line, and a fists-pumping,
head forward motion almost never
accompanies it.
Frankly, the only time a player will
cover 40 yards undeterred is on the
rare occasion when they bust through
coverage and would-be tacklers on a
beeline to the end-zone.
And let's not forget that linemen
and quarterbacks are also tested in
this drill — the chances of them run
ning 40 yards on one play at all. much
less in a straight line, are very low.
There is something to be said for
acceleration — the best linemen can
move quickly from their primary
blocks to their secondary ones, and
