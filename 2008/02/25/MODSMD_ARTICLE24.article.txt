## Wyndam Makowsky Combine: 40-yard relevant? 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Scouts, coaches and general man
agers Hooded the RCA Dome in In
dianapolis last weekend to watch the
NFL Combine, the annual draft eval
uation event. Although many schools
hold pro-days and players participate
in individual workouts, the Combine
is believed to provide the best pre
draft assessment: the conditions are
the same for all the athletes invited to
attend.
It is an unforgiving process in
which draft stocks can shoot up or
plummet in a matter of minutes — as
soon as a player finishes a drill, he is
instantly compared to his peers.Their
college successes are put on hold as
they try to prove that they have the
strength, speed and agility to succeed
at the next level.
In addition to weigh-ins and team
interviews, there are seven workouts
at the Combine, although no one is
forced to do any of them. The sexiest
drill is the 40-yard dash, whose name
is fairly self-explanatory: players run
40 yards in a straight line and are
timed at the 10.20 and 40 yard marks
to see how well they accelerate. For a
skill position player,anything 4.5 sec
onds or below is very good. A time
lower than 4.25 seconds is inhuman,
but a finish above 4.65 will raise some
question marks.
Because, 1 reckon, of how easy it is
to understand, the 40-yard dash is the
most popular measurement of speed
by fans and media alike.
But its simplicity is also its down
fall: it is not an accurate judge of
game speed.
Rarely will a player run 40 yards
untouched in a game. The play with
the most amount of straight running
is a wide receiver on a fly route. Even
then, he will likely hump with thecor
nerback within the first 10 yards and
will continue to grapple with him as
they race down field. It is hardly in a
straight-line, and a fists-pumping,
head forward motion almost never
accompanies it.
Frankly, the only time a player will
cover 40 yards undeterred is on the
rare occasion when they bust through
coverage and would-be tacklers on a
beeline to the end-zone.
And let's not forget that linemen
and quarterbacks are also tested in
this drill — the chances of them run
ning 40 yards on one play at all. much
less in a straight line, are very low.
There is something to be said for
acceleration — the best linemen can
move quickly from their primary
blocks to their secondary ones, and
backs and receivers can get past de
fenders with a burst of speed — but
so much goes into running during a
game that the 40-yard dash doesn't
measure: agility, lateral quickness
and coordination, just to name a
few.
However, there are other (and
better) workouts that measure these
qualities.The best is the 3-cone drill,
where three markers are set up in an
"L" shape. Players must start at one
cone, run five yards to another, run
back, then run around the second
cone to the third, and then back
again. This drill tests speed in short
intervals (which are more useful for
comparison to game speed and aceel

eration), as well as cutting ability, co
ordination and agility.
There are also the 20- and 60-yard
shuttles, which test how well a player
moves across the field and whether
he can change direction rapidly.
NFL general managers are begin
ning to place a lot of their faith in the
3-cone drill and the two shuttles over
the 40-yard dash. For example. New
York Giants GM Jerry Reese — who
had the draft's best class hands down
last year, with all eight draftees log
ging significant minutes during the
Giants' Superbowl run — is a big
proponent of the three lesser-known
tli ills.
Mis last selection in the draft was
running back Ahmad Bradshaw, who
had an average 40 time of 4.60 sec
onds but was among the top finishers
in the 3-cone and 20-yard shuttle.
Bradshaw became a key member of
the Giants' offense during the play

offs: his smooth running across the
field and his ability to change direc
tion on a dime (skills measured by
the two drills) made him a valuable
asset in the back field. Along the way.
he drew comparisons to the leg
endary Barry Sanders.
The infatuation with the 40-yard
dash may be coming to a close inside
of Ni l. front offices, but analysts and
many fans still treat it as gospel
when Arkansas back Darren McFad
den.the top runner in the draft.timed
in at (an unofficial) 4.27 seconds in
the 40 on Sunday, the commentators
couldn't contain their excitement.
But the scouts barely flinched
there was more important testing left
to do.
