## Bruins top Card in 2 OT Stanford takes 2nd at Irvine Invitational after falling to UCLA 7-6 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie script was almost perfect: it
was the tournament championship
game, and the No. 2 Stanford
women's water polo team was neck
and-neck with the No. 1 team in the
country. UCLA. The score could not
be settled after regulation, and the
first overtime went scoreless. Then,
in the second overtime period, Stan
ford scored, and one hand was on the
trophy.
Alas, that hand was soon de
tached, as UCLA scored once in the
second overtime and first in the sud
den-death period, claiming the
game and the title. There is good
news for the Card, though — the
championship in question was not
that of the NCAA tournament, but
only the Irvine Invitational.
Stanford started the tournament
on Saturday morning against No. 16
UC-San Diego. The Card came out
strong, netting three goals in the first
period while shutting out the Tri
tons. The game slowed down a bit in
the second period, with each team
only scoring once, but Stanford went
on to outscore UCSD 7-2 in the sec
ond half for the 11-3 win. Senior
Jackie Gauthier posted a hat trick
for the Card while junior Kira Hill
man, sophomore Kelsey Holshouser
and junior Megan May each added
two.
Stanford faced No. 7 San Jose
State in its next match. The score
was 3-2 in favor of Stanford after
one period, but the second period
was key as the Card outscored the
Spartans 5-1. Stanford kept the pres
sure on throughout the rest of the
game and ended up with a convinc
ing 15-8 victory.
Gauthier again led the way for
the Cardinal, this time scoring four
goals. Three of her goals came on
extra-attacker situations, which was
a strong point for the Cardinal as it
converted 9 out of its 13 6-on-5 op
portunities. Nine different Stanford
players scored against San Jose
State, and freshman goalkeeper
Amber Oland saved seven shots,
one of which was a penalty shot.
The victory over SJSU put Stan
ford into the semifinals, where the
Card faced No. 3 USC.The Cardinal
had already met the Trojans in a
tournament setting this year: Stan
ford's comeback fell short by just a
single goal as junior Lauren Silver's
last second shot bounced off the
post. As expected, the rematch was
just as hard-fought.
The first period ended 2-1 in
favor of USC, but the second period
had the same score in favor of the
Card, and the teams went into half
time tied at three goals apiece. How
ever, USC heated up in the third pe
riod, scoring three goals and keep
ing Stanford out of the net.
The fourth period was beginning
to look like deja vu. Just as it had in
its last meeting, the Cardinal came
into the final quarter down by three,
and again the team started to make
a late comeback. On this day,
though, the comeback attempt did
not fall short, and Stanford was able
to tie the game up at six and force
overtime.
Neither team was able to score in
the first overtime, but junior driver
Koree Blyleven broke the deadlock
with 2:01 remaining in the game.The
Cardinal would hold on to the lead,
coming out with a 7-6 victory and a
ticket to the championship game
against UCLA. Oland was again in
strumental for the Card, stopping 10
shots in goal in what was a great de
fensive effort from Stanford.
The pre-tournament rankings
held true as the No. 2 Cardinal
squared off against the top-ranked
— and undefeated — Bruins. After
a 1-1 first period, UCLA scored two
in a row in the second to make the
score 3-1, but then Silver — who
had been relatively quiet by her
standards in the tournament —
scored on both sides of halftime to
tie the game at three. After UCLA
had scored another goal, Silver
would score again during the third
period to complete her hat trick.
Going into the fourth period, the
clash of the titans was knotted up at
4-4.
The Bruins twice took the lead in
the fourth period, but the Cardinal
would not let them get ahead by
more than a goal. The score was tied
at 5-5 and then 6-6, which is how reg
ulation would end.
Both teams were determined not
to allow an overtime goal, and the
first period of extra time was score
less. Stanford broke through in the
second overtime period, though,
courtesy of a Blyleven backhander.
However, UCLA got a six-on-five
situation in the final minute, and,
with just 46 seconds left, senior Jil
lian Krause put the Bruins back on
even terms. Hie game then moved
into sudden death, where senior
Gabrielle Domanic scored the
game-winner after almost three
minutes.
It was a heartbreaking loss for
the Cardinal, but there are many
positives to take out of the tourna
ment. The women beat three very
good teams, got revenge for their
earlier loss against USC and played
even with the much-vaunted Bruins
for six-plus periods, llie Cardinal's
record now stands at 9-2, and the
team is in little danger of losing its
No. 2 ranking.
As for UCLA, the Card will get
at least one more shot at them this
season, and possibly as many as
three. Stanford has already avenged
one dramatic single-goal loss this
season — who says the team can't
do it again?
