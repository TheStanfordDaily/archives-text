### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford fell 4-2 to St. Mary's yesterday
at Klein Field at Sunken Diamond in a
game scheduled last Sunday to make up
for a rained out game last weekend against
Nebraska.
Stanford junior catcher Jason Castro
started the scoring with a homer — his
second in as many days — in the second
inning off St. Mary's starter Scott Schnei
der to give the Cardinal a 1 -0 lead.
"It's a relief to come off of a good sum
mer season last year and then get off to
such a good start." said Castro, who is hit
ting .429 with two homers and five RBI in
the team's first four games. "I just want to
keep rolling offensively and defensively to
help the team."
Hut that lone run was all Stanford
would get oft Schneider, who scattered
five hits and a walk over six innings to get
the win.
Starting pitcher sophomore Brandt
Walker went just two innings for the Card,
allowing one hit hut walking five before
yielding to freshman Drew Storen. Storen
walked the first man he faced in the fourth,
and St. Mary's used small ball and a two
out RBI single from catcher Ryan Mulli
gan to tie the score at 1.
Storen sent the Gaels down quietly in
the fifth but allowed one-out singles to
outfielders Kenny Fuglerud and Cory
Miller before Mulligan laid down a sacri
fice bunt to put two in scoring position
with two outs for second baseman Randv
Wells.
Wells worked a 3-1 count before dou-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is 2-2 on the season after tak
ing two out of three from Nebraska last weekend
and dropping a makeup game to St. Mary's yester
day, which was scheduled to make up for rainouts
suffered by both teams last weekend. Junior Jason

with two home runs and 5 RBI so far. Nevada
dropped two games to UC-livine last weekend in

Junior catcher and first baseman Jason Castro watched one of his hits soar. Castro hit a solo homerun
yesterday and has now hit two in two days.

pies' groundout scored Jensen and
made the score 4-1 in favor of the
Gaels. Pracher then settled down, al
lowing two hits and one walk in the
final two and two-thirds innings.
Stanford was able to load the
bases with no out off Gael's reliever
Justin kuks in the seventh, but only
got one run across the plate. Alex
Jensen took over for Kuks and fin
ished the inning, allowing just one run
on a sacrifice fly by Stanford fresh
man shortstop Jake Schlander, bring
ing the score to 4-2.
Stanford threatened again in the
eighth, but that would be all for the
scoring, as Jensen was able to work
out of the jam after walking Castro
and hitting junior left fielder Joey Au
gust to bring the go-ahead run to the
plate with no out. Jensen then buck
led down and retired senior first base
man Randy Molina,senior right field
er Brendan Domaracki and sopho
more DHToby Gerhart to end the in
ning.
Gaels' Closer Anthony Selden
came on and shut the door in the
ninth, retiring the Cardinal in order to
record the save for the Gaels.
'ITie loss took Stanford's record to
2-2 on the year. St. Mary's is now 2-1,
after having two games rained out
last weekend. Stanford next plays at
Sunken Diamond today against
Nevada at 3 p.m. The game will be
Stanford's fifth in as many days, and
coaches have expressed concern
about how this vear's condensed

Stanford was able to load the
bases with no out off Gael's reliever

on a sacrifice fly by Stanford fresh

Stanford fell 4-2 to St. Mary's yesterday
at Klein Field at Sunken Diamond in a
game scheduled last Sunday to make up
for a rained out game last weekend against
Nebraska.
Stanford junior catcher Jason Castro
started the scoring with a homer — his
second in as many days — in the second
inning off St. Mary's starter Scott Schnei
der to give the Cardinal a 1 -0 lead.
"It's a relief to come off of a good sum
mer season last year and then get off to
such a good start." said Castro, who is hit
ting .429 with two homers and five RBI in
the team's first four games. "I just want to
keep rolling offensively and defensively to
help the team."
Hut that lone run was all Stanford
would get oft Schneider, who scattered
five hits and a walk over six innings to get
the win.
Starting pitcher sophomore Brandt
Walker went just two innings for the Card,
allowing one hit hut walking five before
yielding to freshman Drew Storen. Storen
walked the first man he faced in the fourth,
and St. Mary's used small ball and a two
out RBI single from catcher Ryan Mulli
gan to tie the score at 1.
Storen sent the Gaels down quietly in
the fifth but allowed one-out singles to
outfielders Kenny Fuglerud and Cory
Miller before Mulligan laid down a sacri
fice bunt to put two in scoring position
with two outs for second baseman Randv
Wells.
Wells worked a 3-1 count before dou-
