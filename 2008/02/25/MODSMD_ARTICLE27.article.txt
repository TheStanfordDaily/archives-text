Sometimes the world just looks a little bet
ter through rose-colored glasses, but in a sport
where glasses just get in the way, the No. 7 Stan
ford women's gymnastics team settles for pink
leotards. ITiings are definitely looking up for
the Card after its stunning victory over Cal,
197.375-193.100, on Sunday at Burnham Pavil
ion.

Sunday also marked Stanford's last home
meet in Burnham Pavilion, where the lady
Card loves to compete.The pink leotards were
more than just eye-catching uniforms for the
crowd; they were part of the team's effort to
raise awareness for breast cancer.
"It definitely gave me a reality check before
the meet. 1 have so much to be thankful for —
especially my health — and this meet made me
reflect more appreciatively on all of the bless
ings 1 have," said junior Kelly Fee.

Depth of skill and depth of character is an
element of the Card that keeps the girls cohe
sive and able to approach even the most trying
of seasons with a positive attitude. Stanford re
turned to its last home competition of the sea
son after spending a difficult month on the
road, falling in three of its away meets by just
tenths of a point.
After last weekend's heartbreaking loss to
Oregon, head coach Kristen Smyth realized the
team needed to step back and take a little

breather. So last weekend, the women took a
surprise drive up to Half Moon Bay, where they
lightened the mood and reassessed how to ap
proach the rest of the season.
"There was just a lot of pressure and high
expectations weighing on us. We weren't letting
our great work show. So we went to the beach
last Sunday to clear our heads and enjoy being
together," coach Smyth said.
