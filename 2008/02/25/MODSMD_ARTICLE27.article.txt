## Beach trip clears heads, ups scores 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes the world just looks a little bet
ter through rose-colored glasses, but in a sport
where glasses just get in the way, the No. 7 Stan
ford women's gymnastics team settles for pink
leotards. ITiings are definitely looking up for
the Card after its stunning victory over Cal,
197.375-193.100, on Sunday at Burnham Pavil
ion.

Sunday also marked Stanford's last home
meet in Burnham Pavilion, where the lady
Card loves to compete.The pink leotards were
more than just eye-catching uniforms for the
crowd; they were part of the team's effort to
raise awareness for breast cancer.
"It definitely gave me a reality check before
the meet. 1 have so much to be thankful for —
especially my health — and this meet made me
reflect more appreciatively on all of the bless
ings 1 have," said junior Kelly Fee.

Depth of skill and depth of character is an
element of the Card that keeps the girls cohe
sive and able to approach even the most trying
of seasons with a positive attitude. Stanford re
turned to its last home competition of the sea
son after spending a difficult month on the
road, falling in three of its away meets by just
tenths of a point.
After last weekend's heartbreaking loss to
Oregon, head coach Kristen Smyth realized the
team needed to step back and take a little

breather. So last weekend, the women took a
surprise drive up to Half Moon Bay, where they
lightened the mood and reassessed how to ap
proach the rest of the season.
"There was just a lot of pressure and high
expectations weighing on us. We weren't letting
our great work show. So we went to the beach
last Sunday to clear our heads and enjoy being
together," coach Smyth said.
"We decided to break things down
into smaller parts,have everyone save
half a tenth. It's something manage
able, and it's also about not getting
ahead of ourselves," she added.
And that is exactly what the Card
did against Cal in Burnham Pavilion
Sunday afternoon.
Stanford pulled out early with stel
lar routines on vault and bars.The Car
dinal hit all six routines on vault, earn
ing a cumulative team score of 49.425.
Senior LizTricase made her first home
appearance of the season, leading the
Card's score on vault with a 9.950. Co
captain and fellow senior Tabitha Yim
followed Tricase with a 9.9(H) while
redshirt freshman Allyse Ishino was a
solid competitor yet again, earning a
9.875. Senior Alex Pintchouk and jun
ior Nicole Ourada also contributed
depth, rounding out the team's overall
score by each earning a 9.850.
On the second rotation, the Card
moved to the bars. Stanford held its
lead over Cal with two 9.900 scores
from Tricase and Ishino. Yim also had
an exciting routine and earned a
9.875.
ITie Card held a solid lead heading
into the beam, an event Stanford has
been struggling with all season. But
Sunday marked a turn of events for
the ladies. Yim's consistency and al
most flawless routine earned her a
9.950 on beam. The highlight of the
beam rotation was Ourada, who hit a
difficult beam routine that she has
been working on all season. She fol
lowed just behind Yim, earning a
9.925.
"1 was really proud of Nicole
Ourada and how she competed this
afternoon especially on balance
beam. She performed with poise and
confidence," Smyth said.
Fee, a stalwart on beam last sea
son, reentered the beam lineup a few
weeks ago and reasserted her
prowess, earning a 9.850.
Stanford ended its fourth and final
rotation on floor, where it kept up its
momentum. Seniors Lauren Elmore
and Yim tied for the team's top scores
with 9.9(H).
Never a team to settle despite its
impressive win, the Card is taking in
this weekend's success and looks to

make the next one even better.
"Reaching a team score of 197.375
shows that we're a team who will he
competing lor the national title. That
idea gives us great confidence going
into the rest of our competitions this
season, as well as for post-season
competition." said Iricase.
"We definitely want to build from
this weekend. We still have room for
improvement, and we'd like to make

those changes against ASU," Fee
added.
There will be no rest for the Card
as the team makes the quick turn
around to travel to its next meet.
Stanford will head down to Arizona
to face the Arizona State Sun Devils,
Friday at 6:00 p.m.
