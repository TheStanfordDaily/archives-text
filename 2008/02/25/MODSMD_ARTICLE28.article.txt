# Cardinal outlasts Broncos
## Cord takes eight-hour, rain delayed match 4-3 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Eight hours and two rain delays were just
what Stanford needed to down No. 28 Boise
State in a very close match last Friday.
ITie No. 37 Cardinal overcame the cold and
wet weather and a resilient Bronco team to pick
up its third win of the season and its first against
an opponent ranked in the top 30. Freshman
Greg Hirshman's match at No. 6 singles was the
deciding point, as he downed Paul Koenke of
Boise State in a three-set thriller, 6-1,5-7,6-2.
After the original start time was delayed two
hours. Stanford came out strong in doubles play.
Hirshman and sophomore Richard Wire easily
won at No. 3 doubles over Blake Boswell and
Steve Robertson, 8-5. With both of the other
doubles matches at 7-6 (one in favor of each
team), the rain returned, and the matches were
suspended.
T\vo hours later, when play resumed, junior
Matt Bruch and freshman Ted Kelly defeated
koenke and Fric Roberson, l >-7, to secure the
doubles point for Stanford. Almost six hours
after the original start time, singles play began
with Stanford holding a 1-0 lead.
The two teams played some great tennis in
the singles matches under the lights, and the rain
never returned, allowing the teams to fight it out
uninterrupted.
Wire quickly put Stanford ahead 2-0 with his
win at No. 3 singles, 6-4,6-3 over Brent Werbeck
of Boise State. After senior Phil Kao's loss at No.

-5 singles to Robertson, freshman Alex Clayton
defeated Luke Shields, 6-4, 7-6 at No. 1 singles,
making the score 3-1 in favor of the Cardinal.
Shields' brother, Clancy, pushed Bruch to the
limit after winning a three-setter at No. 2 singles,
cutting the Cardinal's lead in half. A three-set
loss by junior Blake Muller left the score tied at
3-3.
But Hirshman — playing on the lone indoor
court and thus isolated from the rest of the
matches — would rise to the occasion, toughing

it out in three sets to claim the decisive fourth
point, sealing the victory for the Cardinal.
"I heard at one point that we were up 3 to 1.
meaning that we needed just one more win,"
I lirshman said. "I was really excited about that,
considering that 1 potentially could win the
match for us.
"For all the fun that I had in junior tennis,
there was no time as great as having all my team-

mates and everyone else in the
stands focused on my match, realiz
ing that it would likely determine the
fate of the overall match."
"It's good to get wins in different
positions of the lineup," Wire said of
Stanford's victories ;it the No. 1, 3,
and 6 singles spots. "(Boise State]
was a tough team all the way through
[the lineup]."
Stanford returns to the court
today to face rival California. The
match was supposed to be played on
Saturday, but the rainy weather
forced the teams to wait until today.
"It will be a similar match to
Boise," Wire said. "We are confident

we can win. The doubles point was
crucial against Boise and will he big
again."
Stanford will he going for its sec
ond straight victory over a higher
ranked opponent. No. 24 Cal is led by
freshman Bozhidar katsarov and sen
ior Ken Nakahara, who have 17 and
13 singles wins this year, respectively.
It will take the same energy from
the Cardinal players that got the cru
cial doubles point last weekend to
defeat the Golden Bears, who fea
ture a strong middle of the lineup.
Stanford lost to California twice last
year, making this match all the more
meaningful for the Card.
