## Stanford bounces back Card sweeps Washington schools 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
"It was the first day of our new sea
son," said junior Jessica Nguyen.
After a shocking loss to rival Cali
fornia, the No. 3 Stanford women's
tennis team had little time to recuper
ate amidst a four-day span of three
road matches.
But, just after its stunning loss to
Cal last week. Stanford showed the re
silience of a veteran team as it swept
the Washington schools this past
weekend.
"After Cal, we had a tough day with
a few injuries and sicknesses," Nguyen
said. "I think it's really important to
know that we came hack on the road
and performed well. Everyone played
well, and we worked together as a
team, just recovering from that loss
and moving forward."
In Seattle, the Cardinal earned its
first shutout of the year against the No.
43 Huskies on F-'riday.
The next day, Stanford defeated
No. 44 Washington State. 5-1, in Pull
man, Wash. The team is currently 2-1
on its five-game road trip.
"We shuffled around the lineup a
little hit," Nguyen said. "I think we're
playing to the best of our ability in this
transition we have. We're adjusting
and feeling who plays best at what po
sition."
Over the weekend, freshman Hi
lary Barte played and thrived at the
number one spot, picking up wins
against Pac-10 Player of the Week
Venise Chan and Washington State's
lone ranked player, Ekaterina Bur
duli.
"As a freshman, it's always difficult
going from playing at an individual
basis to having five other teammates
on the court next to you." Nguyen
said. "She's doing a really great job of
adjusting, and she'll only get better
because she's extremely talented. As a
freshman, she's doing very well."
In doubles, Nguyen and senior
Whitney Deason continued their tear
at the number two spot.They are cur
rently 14-5 on the year after picking
up two more wins over the weekend.
"We're just a solid team at the
number two position," Nguyen said.
"We are steady performers, and if one
person's off a little bit, the other per
son will balance it out. We have a good
balance and stability on the court as
far as our games go."
In singles, Nguyen also picked up
two more wins for a team-leading 16
on the season. Nguyen played at the
number three spot due to a lingering
wrist injury suffered at the National
Indoors.
"I'm feeling great on the court,"
Nguyen said. "I played last weekend.

with no left arm and just hitting hack
hand slices the entire time. It was a
good confidence booster for me to
know that 1 can play at the number
two position with half of my game, ba
sically."
"I'm looking forward to this week
end with my wrist healed and being
able to get hack to my game, which 1
feel is really strong at this point,"
Nguyen added.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
road victories came just in time, with a
road trip to Los Angeles looming on
the horizon.
Next weekend. Stanford will head
down to Southern California to face
No. 7 UCLA and No. 12 USC.
"It's great for us to be winning on
the road, and it's important for us
right now coming off the few losses
we've had," Nguyen said. "It'll only
help us next weekend when we're on
the road. We're always really excited
to play them and beat up on them."
For further incentive to win, the
Los Angeles road trip will be a home
coming of sorts for many of the Cardi
nal women.
Barte, Nguyen, junior Megan Do
heny and senior Celia Hurkin arc all
originally from the area.
"We're always excited to go down
there and play people we know,"
Nguyen said. "We always look for
ward to playing our huge L.A. rivals.
It'll be exciting for all of us and a great
experience for our freshmen."
Stanford plays at UCLA at 130
p.m. on Friday and at USC at noon on
Saturday.
