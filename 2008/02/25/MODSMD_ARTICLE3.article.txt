## More postdocs seek jobs in private sector Degree candidates increasingly eschew academe post-graduation 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
As more Ph.D. graduates are choosing jobs
in the private sector over academia, attitudes
and programs at Stanford are adapting to meet
the changing needs of graduate students.
According to the Career Development
Center (CDC) Web site, in 2004-2006, over 50
percent of graduating Ph.D. students in the
School of Engineering went on to the private
sector. For some departments, such as
Computer Science, the number was over 90
percent. About a third of graduates in the nat
ural sciences also entered private industry.
By contrast, only about 10 percent of doctor-

al students in education
entered the private sector.
I*hat number was less than 10

percent for the departments in
humanities and social sciences.
According to Associate Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Chris Golde, this change
in the job market has been occurring on a
national scale for quite some time. Golde
pointed to a rise in Ph.D. candidates — despite
static availability of academic jobs —as a
potential cause for this shift.
"In 1985, the undergraduate and graduate
populations at Stanford were about equal."

Golde said. "Since then, the graduate
population has grown by 25 percent
while the undergraduate population has
grown by only 5 percent. Graduate stu
dents now make up about 55 percent of
the student body."
As jobs in academia become more
scarce, graduates are forced to look
elsewhere for employment.
"I know people who have only pur
sued private sector jobs after two or
three unsuccessful rounds in the aca
demic job market," said Cullen Buie, a
fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in
Mechanical Engineering.
As a result, the services offered at
Stanford's Career Development Center
have adapted to the changing job mar
ket.
"I do traditional career counseling
tasks like looking at [resumes]," said
Stephanie Eberle, the graduate career
counselor at the CDC, "but I also help
graduate students to determine what
about their current career path isn't sat
isfying and figure out what they really
want to do."
The CDC has also created a variety
of new programs to help doctoral stu
dents with alternative careers. Called
"Ph.D. Pathways," these workshops
focus on everything from creating pri
vate-sector resumes to networking with
alumni.
Recently, the CDC has adjusted
these programs to combat the idea that
only students in engineering and the
natural sciences can move to the private
sector.
"There is traditionally more accept
ance of private sector work for engi
neering and biotech students." Eberle
said. "But it's erroneous to say that
humanities students cannot or do not

want to leave academia — they just
have to put more effort into self-mar
keting."
In fact, many students gravitate
toward the private sector for other rea
sons, including compensation.
"Although the starting salaries are
similar, long-term compensation is larg
er in the private sector," Buie said.
But, as Buie observed, there are
trade-offs to the financial advantages.
"Personally, I enjoy the intellectual
freedom of the university environment.
If you want to be highly compensated,
the private sector is the way to go," he
said. "In terms of lifestyle and other
benefits, academia is probably more
attractive."
Second-year Ph.D. candidate in
Mechanical Engineering Polina
Segalova expressed a different motiva
tion for being drawn to the private sec
tor: immediate impact.
"If I do research, I want it to have
immediate impact and application,
which is often the goal in industry,"
Segalova said.
Some students declined to speak
publicly about their career plans
because they did not want their advisors
to know they were considering work
outside of academia.
Attitudes toward private sector work
are still mixed but have generally
become more favorable in recent years,
Segalova said.
"I think the message in my depart
ment is to do whatever you want as long
as you're good at it," Segalova said.
"The Engineering Department rec
ognizes that many or most students
won't end up in academia," Buie added.
