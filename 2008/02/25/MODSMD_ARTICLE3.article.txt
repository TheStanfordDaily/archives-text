## More postdocs seek jobs in private sector Degree candidates increasingly eschew academe post-graduation 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
As more Ph.D. graduates are choosing jobs
in the private sector over academia, attitudes
and programs at Stanford are adapting to meet
the changing needs of graduate students.
According to the Career Development
Center (CDC) Web site, in 2004-2006, over 50
percent of graduating Ph.D. students in the
School of Engineering went on to the private
sector. For some departments, such as
Computer Science, the number was over 90
percent. About a third of graduates in the nat
ural sciences also entered private industry.
By contrast, only about 10 percent of doctor-

al students in education
entered the private sector.
I*hat number was less than 10

percent for the departments in
humanities and social sciences.
According to Associate Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Chris Golde, this change
in the job market has been occurring on a
national scale for quite some time. Golde
pointed to a rise in Ph.D. candidates — despite
static availability of academic jobs —as a
potential cause for this shift.
"In 1985, the undergraduate and graduate
populations at Stanford were about equal."
