Cal's Sam Hel vie won the I-meter

place Sean Mahoney in the 200-meter

Pleased with the win. Kornfeld
praised the performance of the Cardi
nal freshmen.
"We definitely have the best fresh
men class in the country, and they are
an integral part to our success this sea
son." said Kornfeld. "We are a young
team this year that will only get better
with the more experience we have.
"It will be exciting to see the fresh
men exceed their expectations these
next few meets and hopefully spark
the rest of the team to do the same. All
seven of our freshmen have a chance
to go to NCAAs. and that is very rare
to have happen. Yet we still have a lot
of growing up to do if we want to reach
our goals."
The meet against Cal was the last
dual meet of the regular season and
signals the coming of the Pac-10
Championships next week in Long
Beach. Calif. After Pac 10s. where
Stanford will look to extend its win
ning streak to 26 years, the Cardinal
will compete in the NCAA champi
onships, held in Federal Way. Wash.
To be successful there, Stanford
will have to find a way past five-time

defending champion No. 5 Auburn, as
well as the other national powerhous
es: No. 1 Texas. No. 2 Arizona and No. 4
Michigan.
"The key to a team effort is to per
form well in the preliminaries of the
next two meets [Pac 10s and
NCAAs]," explained junior Paul
Zaich. "Everyone needs to be at the
top of their performance and focus so
that the team can maximize the points

it can score by placing as many people
into the finals as possible.
"Therefore, we will be focusing on
getting eighth vs. ninth or 16th vs. 17th
so that we have the opportunity to
score more points in finals," he added.
"Ultimately, if we're able to place two
swimmers in the top eight of an event
in which Auburn wins, we would still
end up outscoring them for that heat."
Ihe Pac-10 diving championships

will start tomorrow at Federal Way,
Wash., and the swim championships
will be held March 5 through March 8.
ITie NCAA Championships will begin
on Mar. 27 and end on Mar.29. Like this
week's diving championships, the
NCAAs will also be held in Federal
Way.
