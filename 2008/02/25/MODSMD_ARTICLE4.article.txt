# STUDENT GROUPS
## Tree candidates make final push Lake stunt, boxing match among events 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Tree Week Stunts continued
over Parents' Weekend and yester
day, building up to the climax of
the festivities — the selection of
the new Tree on Wednesday
evening.
Late Saturday afternoon. Jesus
visited Lake Lag. Or, rather, Tree
candidate Forrest White '10,
dressed as Jesus, visited Lake Lag.
Two of White's friends were
paddling around Lake Lag in a
rowboat when White appeared on
the scene. White began to wade out
to them when he "realized he
could walk on water," according to
the video of the skit, and stepped
up onto the surface.
I lalfway toward the boat. White
stopped to fill a small bottle with
lake water and gulp it down. Upon
arriving at the rowboat, White
accepted a bottle of an indeternii

nate liquid from his two friends
and chugged it, accompanied by
chants of "Jesus! Jesus!" from the
shore.
Afterwards, White stripped off
his robe to reveal a "Cal Sucks" t
shirt and black shorts and proceed
ed to do push-ups on the surface of
the lake.
White then climbed into the
boat with his compatriots and
returned to shore.
The other Tree candidate.
Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09, dis
played his latest stunt yesterday
afternoon in White Plaza. Fortune
staged a boxing match with friend
and challenger Sammy Franco '() l >.
"That was my first time [box
ing]," Fortune said. "Sammy
Franco challenged me, and I decid
ed to accept it."
Adam Klotz '09 eniceed the
match and — dressed in a tuxedo
and armed with a megaphone
introduced each of the competitors
to the crowd. Fortune, decked out
in a new Mohawk, was labeled as
the reigning champion.

Patrick Fortune '09 delivered a devestating left hook to his friend and challenger Sammy Franco '09
during one of Fortune's stunts in his campaign for Tree. Next year's Tree will be chosen on Wednesday.
When he discarded his robe, the word
"tree" and an outline of a tree were
revealed in green paint on his back.
Over the course of three neck-and
neck rounds, the cheers of the audience
became louder and more vehement, with
supporters cheering both candidates. In
the end, though. Fortune landed a few
strong punches and triumphed over his
opponent.
"I'll say that he's a very worthy com
petitor," Franco said after the match. "He

has had a Herculean body imposed upon
his frame."
Toward the end of the match, a tour
group of small children showed up to line
the other end of the White Plaza lawn.
They stared on in a mixture of awe and
disbelief at the raucous crowd of college
students watching a thoroughly violent
boxing match.
