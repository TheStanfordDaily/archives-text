an American Civilization and Africana
Studies professor at Brown University, will

History Department, where he will contin
ue to pursue his research or African-
American history.
At Brown, Campbell serves as chair of
the University Steering Committee on
Slavery and Justice, which has researched
Brown's relationship to slavery and the
slave trade.
Campbell has also studied South Africa,
the role of race in the American
Revolution and the Civil Rights move
ment, among other issues.
"He's created a very unique scholarly

niche," said History Prof. David Kennedy
'(i3. "He's one of the few people anywhere
who is equally at home in African Studies
and American history."
Campbell's appointment comes at a
time when Stanford is making a push to
recruit faculty who study ethnic minorities.
It also follows recent departures of profes
sors who specialized in such research,
including Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga.
Sociology Prof. Lawrence Bobo and
Associate Communication Prof.
Marcyliena Morgan.
Hie appointment is independent of

Stanford's Faculty Diversity Initiative,
which aims to appoint 10 young scholars to
the Center for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CCSRH) within the
next five years, though Campbell will
nonetheless coordinate with the CCSRIi.
"James is likely to he a very key player
at th;it center for the next few years." said
History Professor Albert Camarillo.
"We've been trying to get James for a
year and a half," Camarillo added, "lie's
really emerged as a leading scholar and a
major public historian on these
issues."
Campbell's appointment also
comes at a time when the History
Department may be entering a cru
cial transition period.
"In the next five or six years,
we're going to be facing many retire
ments." Camarillo said. "And we're

going to continue to search for histo
rians across the fields."
Campbell — whose scholarship
took shape while studying under
Stanford History Professor
Emeritus George Fredrickson —
praised the chance to become part of
the program at this time.
"I'm obviously only going to be
one person among many." Campbell
said."But I'm really looking forward
to being a part of a conversation
about how to teach American histo
ry in the 21st century."
As he makes his preparations to

return to Stanford. Campbell noted
his continued respect for his alma
mater and its potential.
"The History Department at
Stanford remains one of the
strongest in the nation," Campbell
said. "And right now I think the insti
tution has a unique opportunity to
build a program in American history
that is at once sensitive to the diver
sity of the American experience and
to America's place in the world."
