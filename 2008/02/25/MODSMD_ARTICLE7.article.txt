## POLITICS IN ACTION Four recent graduates shape California policy 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Four Stanford alums are already making their
mark on the California political scene — and
they just graduated last June. "A lot of people
complain about what the government's doing, but
they don't really do anything," said Chris Nguyen
'07. "I'm actually able to change the laws and
change the system."
As participants in the competitive, yearlong Capital Fel
lows program. Nguyen and Anthony Sanchez '07 work as leg
islative aides in the offices of Sen. George Runner (R-Calif.)
and Sen. Joe Simitian (D-Calif.),respectively Dontae Rayford
'07 is a legislative aide in the California State Assembly, and
Loretta Hickman '07 works at the State Board of Education
office.
The program includes IS Assembly Fellows, 18 Senate Fel
lows. 18 Executive Fellows and 10 Judicial Administration Fel
lows. After an intensive orientation, fellows are placed in state
executive, legislative and judicial offices.
"We engage in the process of carrying legislation." Rayford
said. "From the inception of an idea, you mold it, you prepare
it to be presented, you respond to different concerns from all
over — stakeholders, constituents, interest groups, lobbyists.
You just have to become a guru in that area to the best of your
ability."
His office is working on bills about health insurance, multi
track year-round schooling in California and CalGrant revi
sion.
In the office. Nguyen does research on issues, drafts the lan
guage of bills and talks to both supporters and opponents,
though he emphasized that his job is different every day.
"There is no typical day in the office," he said.
Over the past month. Sanchez has been researching a bill
proposal."lt's very humbling to, today,finally take that bill and
'bring it across the desk' to the Senate chambers," he said. "I
handed it in, and I realized I'm actually part of the process now
of making law."
Rayford added that another rewarding part of the fellow
ship is the access it grants to influential individuals in state gov
ernment.
"By throwing around the term fellow,' you can get a meet
ing with a lot of bigwigs in Sacramento," he said.
It's not all fun and games, however, I lickman said, recalling
her first board meeting.
"I was so excited,even though everyone told me I was going
to hate the board meetings because they're so long and te
dious,"she said."l love talking about education. 1 love working
with kids — I thought 1 could never be bored by this at any
level. Sure enough, what I will never forget was getting bored
at this meeting. It just kind of hit me that there are ups and
downs to every job."
The six-week orientation period allowed fellows to "hit the
ground running," said Rayford, and Sanchez agreed that the

transition into the Senate office was smooth.
"The fellowship is designed in such a way to take people
who have little or no experience in politics and get them to
work in the building," he added. "You can't really learn in a
class at Stanford what you need to succeed here. You can learn
a lot about politics in the classroom, but when you get into the
actual environment, it's entirely different, and there are so
many things you couldn't have prepared for."
Hickman believes her experience as a fellow has encour
aged her to think more realistically.
"You just realize [after working in the office] we really
don't have the resources to provide for everyone in the

way that we would really like," she said."What do you
do? You have to make a lot of tough decisions. It's
grounded me a little bit in the reality of things —
things take time, and you can't just snap your fin
gers and have something happen."

Nguyen, who added that he plans to con
tinue his involvement in politics after the
fellowship ends, said he would encourage
Stanford students to consider opportu
nities such as the Capital Fellows Pro
gram.

"A lot of people want to get jobs
with really high salaries, but public
service is not a bad thing," he said.

"The fellowship only lasts a
year, so people could do this

and take a stab at giving back to
the community. You can make
the six figures later — the Stan
ford degree won't go away."
