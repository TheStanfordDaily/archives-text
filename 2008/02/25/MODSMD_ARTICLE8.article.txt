# A 						whole new world
## Morehouse sophomore studies psychology, life at Stanford 
### ALEX ARMAND AKBARI 
Sophomore Alex Akhari is from Nashville, Tennessee.
An undergrad at Morehouse College, he is studying
at Stanford this year through Diversity Exchange.
The first day of my exchange at
Stanford was a true welcome
into a new world. I rode onto
Palm Drive beneath the "Wel
come to Stanford" banner in
awe of a street lined with palm
trees leading up to one of the top universi
ties in the nation. ITiis beginning was
markedly different from the bumpy, jar
ring, unmarked roads that welcomed me to
my home college last year. On my first day,
a water pipe burst inside my dorm room
filling the room with over a foot of water in
less than fifteen minutes — I call it "Wel
come to an HBCU" (Historically Black
College and University).
With Black History Month un
\derway, now seems like an appro
priate time to take note of
Stanford's relation
ship with

Morehouse College. Morehouse, like Stan
ford, has quite a list of accomplished grad
uates— including alumni such as Martin
Luther King Jr., Spike Lee, Samuel L.Jack
son. Andrew Young, the first black mayors
of Atlanta and San Antonio, Olympic gold
medalists, two U.S. Surgeon Generals and
several congressmen. Morehouse has also
consistently ranked near the top academi
cally among HBCU's, just as Stanford has
among national universities.
But that may be where the similarities
end. Morehouse is an all-male, historically
black college in Atlanta, Georgia, and is
part of the Atlanta University Center
(AUC), which is the largest contiguous
consortium of black colleges in the world
with five HBCU's representing over
M.(MM) students.
As I get well into the second quarter of
my yearlong exchange at Stanford, I've
found that Stanford students are often not
familiar with Morehouse, and even fewer
know about the exchange program that al
lowed me to come here for a year. The
Morehouse-Stanford Exchange, which is
part of the Stanford Diversity Exchange,
has been going on for over thirty years, of
fering students from Morehouse and Stan
ford the chance to domestically exchange
for up to a year.The program allows partic
ipants to experience the opportunities,
benefits and differences of stepping out of

their comfort zones and entering a totally
different environment — geographically,
socially and culturally.
Outside of the obvious demographic
and geographical differences, Morehouse
and Stanford are dissimilar in size as well.
Morehouse's student body consists of 3,000
men. while Stanford has close to 20,0(X) stu
dents, including both undergraduate and
graduate students. College life in general is
a totally different experience at the two
schools. Some of the differences lie in the
living arrangements, as the vast majority of
Stanford students live on campus for all
four years; at Morehouse, I d venture to say
that about half the student body moves off
campus into Atlanta before graduation.
Another difference to note between
the schools is the students' reasons for at
tending, since both institutions have a tra
dition of success but a very different tradi
tion of how students get there. With over
24.000 undergraduate applicants this year,
there are various reasons why students
choose to go to Stanford, including diversi
ty, academic reputation,notable alumni re
sources, parental lineage and ranking.
Ironically, despite apparent differences,
those are some of the same reasons I and
others chose to go to Morehouse.
As a black male in America, I wanted to
go to the best school for black males in
America. Like me, others at Morehouse

turned down Ivy League schools that of
fered consistent hot water, reliable Inter
net and working heat in favor of the "char
acter building" that young men undergo
during their years at Morehouse. More
house is often referred to as one big frater
nity because of the brotherly, "1 am my
brother's keeper." cult-like feeling of
events such as New Student Orientation
(NSO). During one program, organizers
take all freshmen on a torch lit tour of cam
pus at 4 a.m., giving a Morehouse history
lesson and introduction to the nationally
recognized alumni buried on the grounds.
Also at NSO, freshmen are instilled
with mottoes such as "If a Morehouse Man
can't do it, it can't be done" and"The clos
est thing to God...is a Morehouse Man."
These inspiring phrases give students self
confidence that they carry with them for
the rest of their lives as Morehouse Men.
Now, after my time at Stanford, I find
myself as not just a sophomore psychology
pre-med from Nashville, not only a "Man
of Morehouse," but a "Man of Stanford" as
well. I feel that my exchange and experi
ences will allow me to be successful wher
ever and through whatever life throws at
me.
