Human Body
Surgeons currently use common
industrial materials inside the body
to replace damaged body parts. By
hijacking Nature's material-making
machines, we can engineer new
materials that communicate with
our cells to promote healing and
regeneration.
Join Sarah Heilshorn, Assistant Professor, Materials Science and Engineering
at Stanford University, as she discusses these tiew materials and how they can
communicate with cells in order to heal damaged tissue. She will also discuss
specific applications that her laboratory is studying including the heart, brain,
and spinal cord tissues.
