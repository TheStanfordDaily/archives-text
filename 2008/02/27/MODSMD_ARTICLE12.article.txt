# "HOW MUCH WILL YOU TOLERATE?"
## 
### 
LEAD selects students from these
four communities to come together
and devise social change projects.
The members of "How Much Will
You Tolerate?" are Phillip Hon 10,
Julian Kelly '10, Kimberly McKinson
'10, Natalia Ricotta '10 and Diana
Huynh'll.
The exhibit features four power
ful pictures that are reenactments of
acts of intolerance that happened in
recent history right here on campus.
One image depicts the Azia Kim in
cident and the backlash on Okada
that followed in May 2007.
The other three recreate acts of
vandalism — an attack on religion
during Thanksgiving 2(X)4, when a
banner was slashed and replaced
with the phrase "Satan wishes you a
Happy Thanksgiving;" an attack on a
student's sexuality by writing the
word "FAG" on a bathroom wall in
Toyon in October 2004; and the writ
ing of "Klu Klux Klan" in Arrillaga
Sports Center last October.
Ricotta's experience in Okada
last year was the inspiration for the
group's project. After picking the
easiest to depict and most recent acts
of intolerance, the students decided
to make their project a photo exhibit

'it feels fantastic" Ricotta added.
"It's really cool to see it set up. We've
been working on it for so long, it's
great to see it actually accom
plished."
The group is already planning to
develop this project on a larger scale
in the future — the members have
already contacted the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) and Students Promoting
Ethnic And Cultural Kinship
(SPEACK) in an effort to continue
these projects to bring more aware
ness about acts of intolerance.
Students have noticed the exhibit
and experienced different reactions.
"I think it's starting to do what
should have been done many years
ago," said Charlie Wang '08.
"When I first saw it, 1 was furious,
which was great, I was supposed to be
angry" said Takeo Rivera '08. "It
elicited such a strong and thought
provoking response from me. We as
students have responsibility to recog
nize and confront not just the acts of
intolerance themselves but the cultur
al problematics that can incite them."
