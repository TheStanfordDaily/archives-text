## Univ.prioritizes sustainability in construction 
### ROBERT TOEWS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As widespread campus construc
tion forges ahead. Jack Cleary, asso
ciate vice president for academic
projects and operations, assured The
Daily that long-term sustainability is
a priority.
Unlike many other universities,
which use Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED)
standards as a guide for sustainabili
ty, Stanford has designed custom
standards.
Yale recently made headlines
when it announced it was reevaluat
ing its pursuit of LEED certification
for all new campus buildings, which
Stanford policy planners have also
decided is not well-suited for the
University. Cleary said that LEED
was designed primarily to address
sustainability specifically in new
office buildings and does not trans
late well to campus projects such as
classrooms, auditoriums, perform
ances spaces and libraries. Cleary
also said campus-wide initiatives
such as storm water management
plans and transportation programs
are excluded from LEED's certifica
tion process.
"We believe that by following
our own sustainability guidelines, a
typical Stanford building is LEED
silver equivalent," Cleary said, refer
ring to the ranking system's use of
gold, silver and platinum certifica
tions. "We know this because 90 per
cent of the professional project
management staff at Stanford is
LEED accredited, which means all
of our projects have a Stanford
LEED professional providing guid
ance to the process."
The Graduate School of Business
Knight Management Center, slated
to open in 2010, will pursue LEED
certification for its new buildings.
Achieving certification will require
approximately $500,000 in addition
al fees and certification costs.
"This certification will help [the

business school] in telling the story
about sustainability on the project,
but it does not necessarily guarantee
a higher performing building than if
our typical process was followed."
Cleary said.
Instead, three documents — the
Project Delivery Process at Stanford
(PDP), the Guidelines for
Sustainable Buildings (GSB) and
the Life Cycle Cost Analysis
Guidelines (LCCA) — are designed
to ensure that proven sustainable
features and practices are consid
ered during the design process at
Stanford.
"Essentially, the PDP provides
the roadmap, the GSB outlines sus
tainable priorities and opportunities

at key points in the process and the
LCAA ensures that we are making
sound, responsible decisions that
make good financial sense through a
simply payback analysis," Cleary
said.
According to Cleary. the docu
ments provide specific criteria for
five environmental aspects of
University construction, which
include sustainability of the site
design and planning, water manage
ment, minimization of energy use.
materials, resources and waste, and
indoor environmental quality.
Specific criteria to be applied to
the construction includes optimizing
the use of natural lighting, reducing
energy use. maximizing local prod

uct procurement and recycling at
least 70 percent of construction
waste.
Although he maintained that sus
tainability remains a priority when
constructing University buildings,
Cleary said it is not the only objec
tive.
"[Competing priorities] also
include academic program, level of
quality, aesthetics, cost, schedule,
code requirements, land use and
operations." he explained. "The
projects we build are first and fore
most to house research that will fur
ther our academic mission."

Unlike other universities, Stanford uses custom standards for ensuring long-term sustainability in new buildings, includ
ing graduate student housing. Many schools puruse LEED certification, which Stanford planners deem unsuitable.
