and is unrestricted, meaning it will be spent at the

University's multidisciplinary programs in these
schools," Wachtel said."l think it covers a broad cross
section of departments and programs throughout the
University."

to the LGBT Community Resources Center.

million of which was given to gay-rights groups,
according to The Chronicle.
