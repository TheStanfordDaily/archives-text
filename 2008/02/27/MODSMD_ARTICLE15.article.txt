## ASSU welcomes student input Senate fields complaints, increases office hours 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At last night's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, senators discussed ways to
bridge the gap between the student body
and ASSU officials while also preparing for
the transition to the new Senate.
Today, the Senate will be hosting an
event — "Come Complain Here" — that is
focused on receiving feedback from under
graduate students across campus. Students
will be able to come to White Plaza between
noon and 1 p.m. to provide input regarding
the Senate's role on campus while eating
free Krispy Kreme donuts.
"We find it very hard to get people to
send us an email or personally give us feed
back." said Senator Jose Benchimol 'O.S
regarding the event. "We need to go out and
make it easier for them to come to us."
Senators will compile all of the com
ments they receive and present them to the
Senate and University administration.
"1 think it is a good opportunity for us
and the incoming Senate for next year to be
able to discuss the concerns and issues that
are important to students," said Senator
Vang Kou khang '08.
Aside from hosting today's "Come
Complain Here," the Senate will also

increase the frequency of its previously
weekly office hours to a daily schedule.
Each day a senator will be in the Senate
office in Old Union between noon and 1
p.m.
"We have office hours in order to pro
vide open doors for students to come talk to
us about concerns, issues or anything that
they want to do," khang said. "It is a very
important statement to give [to students]
that we are here to help and represent
them."
The Senate is also looking to increase its
involvement with next year's Nominations
Commission, which selects students to rep
resent the student body in permanent
University committees.
"The ASSU has an incredible asset in the
nominations commission," said Senator
Luukas lives '09. "We have over 100 stu
dents sitting on every faculty-Senate com
mittee, every Hoard of Trustees committee,
most University governance committees
and a lot of important advisory commit
tees."
lives said students on the committees
currently do not communicate effectively
with the ASSU
"We can improve the communication
between the student members of these com
mittees and the ASSU," he said, "so that
they can know the collective interests of the
student body and can actually advocate for
the collective interest of students."
