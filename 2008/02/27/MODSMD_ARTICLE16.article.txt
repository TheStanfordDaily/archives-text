## Editorial Board The 						harm of diversity 
### 
Over the last couple of decades, there
have been many politically correct
catch-phrases. Few have been more
parroted, however, than "diversity."
What exactly is the übiquitous concept of
"diversity?" By definition, something which
is "diverse" is made up of distinct or unlike
parts or elements. A portfolio is diverse if it
contains investments from a wide range of
business sectors. Diversity often leads to
many positive diverse outcomes — a diverse
portfolio is safer from bad investments, a di
verse workplace provides a myriad of back
grounds and experiences with which to ap
proach business projects. But what happens if
you don't have the experience to create a di
verse portfolio or if you don't have a diverse
applicant pool from which to select employ
ees?
Stanford's Diversity Week is calling atten
tion to a very real and important issue of ho
mogeneity in academia. Monday's op-ed by
ASSIJ Executives Hershey Avula '08 and
Mondaire Jones '09 called for "a more vigor
ous expansion of typical applicant pools and
greater energy devoted to attracting under
represented groups to Stanford." It is a noble
ideal and one that the Editorial Board sup
ports whole-heartedly.
In the same editorial, Avula and Jones
state that an integral part of promoting diver
sity is to "make departments — which are re
sponsible for hiring faculty — accountable
for their lack of diversity." This well-inten
tioned idea, however, will lead to a forced di
versity, which will ultimately do more harm
than good for the Stanford's academic envi
ronment.
Making a department "accountable" for a
lack of diversity is equivalent to punishing it
for its homogenous applicant pool. It is not
the fault of a Stanford University department

that applicant pools are skewed toward white
males. While societal issues and cultural prob
lems have lead to this problem with diversity,
Stanford is not to blame.
Avula and Jones claim that they don't wish
to see "admission of a less qualified ethnic mi
nority or female applicant into a graduate
program or into the ranks of a given academ
ic department over someone more qualified."
But then what kind of accountability are we
talking about? If a department doesn't have a
qualified minority applicant pool, can it real
ly be punished for not hiring them?
Punishing a department for not hiring mi
norities will lead to one of two things. If a de
partment doesn't fill its "diversity quota" —
the concept of accountability appears to be
nothing more than a reworked definition of a
quota — then the department may lose fund
ing. If it hires under-qualified employees, the
quality of the program suffers.
In June 2(K)7. the Supreme Court of the
United States made a very simple, yet pro
found statement when ruling on public school
programs which consider race. Chief Justice
Roberts wrote in his majority opinion that
"the way to stop discrimination on the basis
of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of
race."This statement holds true and pertinent
to any issue of diversity — race and gender
should never come into the equation. Forcing
the hand of employers to hire based on race
or gender does nothing but cause harm to the
industry in question.
Calling for an expansion of recruitment
into the applicant pool in the hopes of making
it more diverse is something that Stanford
should work on as actively as possible. The
concept of accountability or enforced diversi
ty. however, should be thrown out much like
the affirmative action and quota mandates of
the past.
