## Expanding the discourse on expansion 
### 
In this space last week, my colleague Bren
dan Selby wrote about the veil of secrecy
that has surrounded the University task
force set to explore the possibility of expand
ing the undergraduate population. Brendan
reported that Senior Assistant to the President
Jeff Wachtel '79 declined to offer any clarity on
the school's thinking. More surprising was the
silence from ASSU President I iershey Avula
'08.
Avula is the lone student on the expansion
task force, but he cheerfully toes the company
line, informing Brendan last week that he
couldn't talk about the process because it's
"strictly confidential." This is the same Avula
who wrote in his election platform that "we
hope that our sustained involvement in vari
ous non-ASSU campus organizations, along
with our proven accessibility to students over
the years, will convey our unwavering commit
ment to incorporating student input into im
portant decisions." Pathetic.
The University has a tendency to spring big
announcements on the student body — Hey,
no bikes in the arcades this year!; I ley. no more
drinking in freshman dorms! — with little or
no warning. And now. to borrow a phrase from
the FBI. there is a lot of "chatter" from the
University administration — something big is
afoot.
Last Friday during his annual Parents'
Weekend speech. President I lennessy said he
imagines increasing the undergraduate popu
lation by 10 to 12 percent. It was the first time
he has publicly described the scope of his vi
sion.
There are 1 ,b4S students in this year's fresh
man class. An 11 percent increase would add
about 181 new freshmen. Multiply that out by
four, and it will eventually mean a total of 724
more Stanford undergraduates.
Since few other details have emerged re
garding about the University's deliberations, I
conducted my own one-man task force. We al
ready know that housing will be an issue, so I
decided to l(x>k at less visible areas of the Uni
versity that will nonetheless be strained by 724
additional students.
First, Memorial Auditorium — is there
enough room to host all-freshman events?
No. Ihe seating capacity of MemAud is
1714, and the proposed increase would bump
the freshman class size to over IKOO.
There was not even enough room in
MemAud this fall, according to one Resident
Assistant. The larger-than-usual freshman
class, plus dorm staff and administrators,
forced Orientation coordinators to set up an
auxiliary viewing site in the adjacent Piggott
Theater. Nothing says "Oh-leven!" like watch
ing "The Real World: Stanford" on a l ( >-inch

TV. Luckily, because a few froshies inevitably
skip these events, the Piggott back-up plan was
not used.
" 1 hope an increase in class size would come
with a new auditorium to put them in," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
transfer students.
The impact of the expansion on events like
all-frosh night at Gaieties is unclear (an email
to producers went unanswered at press time).
What about Sophomore College — are
there enough spaces?
Stanford boasts about SoCo in brochures
and campus tours, but there is already much
more demand than supply. According to
Sharon Palmer, assistant vice provost for un
dergraduate education, 500 students —or
about 30 percent of freshmen — apply for
Sophomore College every year.The admit rate
for this popular program is around 50 percent.
Under the proposed expansion, that would
mean roughly 50 more applicants per year —
and 50 more rising sophomores that have to
spend the last three weeks of summer sitting at
home in Palookaville, USA.
Palmer was quick to add that "an expansion
in Sophomore College would be discussed if
the entering class increase occurs." A parallel
increase in Sophomore College would only
maintain the present shortage of space, how
ever. instead of alleviating the problem.
Residential Computing — will we have
enough bandwidth to go around?
1 got conflicting answers from the experts.
Eithan Rikleen, a senior network administra
tor with Residential Computing, explained
that residential bandwidth is "already at ca
pacity." Director of Networking Systems Mark
Miyasaki emailed me a nifty usage graph to re
fute Rikleen's claim.The difference of opinion
is a major one. The purchase of more band
width would cost millions, according to Rik
leen.
Stanford Post Office —just when you
thought the federal government can't solve
your problems, the United States Postal Ser
vice delivers a welcome rejoinder. Customer
Service Supervisor Kdgar Segovia said that the


Dave&
Brendan
Post Office would probably have
enough mailboxes to accommodate
the proposed undergraduate increase.
This informal study is not meant to
be exhaustive. There are plenty of
other areas that need examining. Can
popular departments like Human Bi
ology and Economics withstand 10 to
12 percent more majors? How will the
new financial aid policies be affected?
Can Red Zone seating accomodate 10
to 12 percent more fans?
1 am not arguing that these are in
surmountable obstacles to expansion.
With enough money, bandwidth can
be purchased, SoCo can be enlarged
and professors can be hired.
What I am saying is that students
are uniquely poised to offer a ground
level assessment of where our campus
infrastructure stands. Instead of meet
ing behind drawn curtains with big
time donors and one mealy-mouthed
politician, the University ought to tap
into the wisdom of current students
when deciding if expansion makes
sense for Stanford.

Dave is unsure if bigger is always better.

in Sophomore College would be discussed if
the entering class increase occurs." A parallel
increase in Sophomore College would only

Residential Computing — will we have
enough bandwidth to go around?
1 got conflicting answers from the experts.
Eithan Rikleen, a senior network administra
tor with Residential Computing, explained
that residential bandwidth is "already at ca
pacity." Director of Networking Systems Mark
Miyasaki emailed me a nifty usage graph to re

This informal study is not meant to

when deciding if expansion makes
sense for Stanford.

Dave is unsure if bigger is always better.
