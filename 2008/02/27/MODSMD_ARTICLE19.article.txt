# You're Not Special
## Activists focus on superficial change

Un resident Hennessy is certainly
of SLAC's opinions... But
.A. intense feelings and strong opin
ions cannot be the sole basis for making deci
sions that affect the health and well-being of
the entire university."
This was written by Diane Peck, Executive
Director of Human Resources at Stanford
University, in an op-ed published by the Daily
in April of last year.
I ler statement cuts to the core of my con
cern with student activists.The programs they
champion, from Israel divestment to wage in
creases, are short-sighted and superficial, and
Stanford will have to face the programs' fi
nancial consequences long after these stu
dents have graduated. And, that revenue loss
will adversely affect other, potentially far
more effective, programs.
Student activists see Stanford as a large
pot of money that can be used to help those in
need. But because students will not be here
for very long, they demand immediate, flashy
change. Most of that change is designed to al
leviate their guilt from being ensconced in a
bastion of American privilege. They want to
know that their dorms are being cleaned by
workers who make enough money, and that
no Indonesian children are knitting their
sweaters, and that their grant wasn't financed
by the sale of weapons to Israel.
But every dollar that our endowment
doesn't make because we refuse to invest in
defense contractors and every extra dollar we
spend on wage increases comes directly out of
other spending, like expanding financial aid
or conducting groundbreaking research.
I low can anyone look around this campus
and not see the parade of good that it pro-

This is not Wal-Mart.
This is a non-profit. And
the money that gets spent
on these student causes
does not come out of
some fat-cat's dividend.

duces? This is not Wal-Mart. 'Ibis is a non
profit. And the money that gets spent on these
student causes does not come out of some fat
cat's dividend.
ITie money comes from programs that
students are generally less invested in than

the administration and faculty. Research
happens in laboratories far from Tresidder
Union, and generally takes years to com
plete. Even then, the results are usually not
spectacular. It's hard for a student to say,"My
tuition was responsible for l/5,(XH)th of a new
computer program that models protein-fold
ing."
Student activists will never know which
brilliant professor wasn't hired because Stan
ford could not afford a new slot in the biolo
gy department.The increased tuition and de
creased financial aid that pays for activist
causes will affect students who are still in
grade school right now.
It is Stanford's responsibility to make the
tough decisions that students cannot, the de
cisions they don't have the information, ex
pertise or foresight to understand. The peo
ple who run this university are not soul-less.
They routinely outlay money for things that
will have great social but little financial ben
efit, such as the performing arts, or astro
physics. They do, however, have the courage
to calculate where each dollar will best be
spent.
If you want to increase the maximum
amount of good in the world, it is silly to redi
rect money from Stanford's core priorities.
Anything that leeches money from those pri
orities will do the world a disservice, no mat
ter how good it may make you feel.

Fun Fact: President Hennessy does not have the
highest salary at Stanford, not even close. Sever
al wed school profs make significantly more
than he does. Request a copy of Stanford's 99()
