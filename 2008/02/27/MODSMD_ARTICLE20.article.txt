## MEN'S VOLLYBALL Familiar faces to visit Farm 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the No. 9 Stanford men's volleyball
team takes the court tonight, it will be a re
union of sorts for several of the Cardinal play
ers. Four of them will be facing off with their
hometown team, the Honolulu-based Hawaii
Warriors.
Sophomore Kawika Shoji and freshmen
Spencer McLachlin, Max Halvorson and Jor
dan Inafuku all came to Stanford from
Hawaii, where they played for rival high
schools in Honolulu. Shoji has a particularly
strong connection to the University, where his
father Dave has been the women's vollevball

coach since 1975.
ITie four w ill see some familiar faces across
the net — Hawai'i's setter Sean Carney at
tended lolani School with Shoji, while middle
blocker Keali'i Frank played with McLachlin
and Halvorson at Punahou School.
"1 think it helps us. especially with our
younger players, because it adds a little more
motivation." head coach John Kosty said of
the familiarity between the teams. "A lot of the
teams we play they have never seen before.
For instance, Pepperdine— our freshmen
have never played against those guys even in
club.
"Also, it's the University of Hawaii — for
Kawika. he has been a part of that university

for a long, long time with his dad coaching
there. He's seen a lot of UH volleyball and
likes competing against them because he
knows the program so well."
The Cardinal (10-6,6-6 MPSF) come into
the midweek doubleheader against the War
riors riding the momentum of a dominating
sweep of then-top-ranked Brigham Young
last weekend. Stanford lost to the Cougars in
five games on Friday before stunning them in
only three on Saturday. Though the Cardinal
stayed at No. l ) in the rankings. BYU dropped
from first to third.
"It was another night, but a similar game,

NOTtS: The No. 9 Stanford men's volleyball team returns
home after splitting two weekend matches with No. 1 BYU.
The Cardinal dropped a five game thriller to the Cougars on
Friday, but came back with a 3-0 sweep on Saturday. In that
victory, freshman Spencer McLachlin had 16 kills and senior
Matt Ceran had 15 to lead the way. Sophomore Kawika
Shoji had 53 assists and chipped in 15 digs. The Cardinal
will play Hawaii tonight and again tomorrow night.
because BYU was pretty good both
nights," Kosty said. "We didn't make
changes [from Friday to Saturday],
but reiterated what we needed to do
better. 1 thought our middles played
better on the second night and [soph
omore opposite] Evan Romero was
better the second night. So our game
was better and we were also more
comfortable with the surroundings
and the team we were playing."
The Hawaiian trio of Shoji.
McLachlin and lnafuku were key to
that win. Shoji dished out 53 assists
and notched 15 digs, McLachlin
pounded 16 kills and had a team-high
eight blocks, and lnafuku dug a per
sonal-best 16 balls. McLachlin was
named MPSF Player of the Week
after the win. the first such honor of
his career.
'it's a good indication of where we
are at. with this team and with our
program," Kosty said. "We are build
ing confidence and winning at BYU is
just huge. Not too many teams have
done it over the past few years. They
have been a really solid team at home
this decade and have won two nation
al championships. [Before this week
end.] they hadn't lost in Provo in two
years."
With a 6-6 record in conference,
the Cardinal still sits in the middle of
the pack, but has a chance to make a
move with this week's pair of match
es. Tlie Warriors (6-7,5-5) beat Pacific
twice this past weekend for their first
road wins of the season. They upset
No. 7 UCLA two weeks ago. but that
remains their only win against a cur
rently ranked team.
1 .ast year, Stanford's season ended
with a pair of losses to Ilawaii, one in
three games and the other in four. It
will be a very different Warriors team
this time around, though, as the top
three hitters and the setter from that
team have all since graduated.
"Their team is similar to ours,"
Kosty said of the Warriors' young ros
ter. "They are starting to gel. They
split with UCLA and just beat UOP
twice, so they are coming off good
wins and gaining confidence. Hiey are
a good team and they run a fast of
fense."
Jacob Schkud leads Hawaii with
157 kills on the season, while Joshua
Walker and Jim Clar are each averag
ing 3.5 kills per game. Schkud is also
the team's top server with 14 aces.
Carney has handled the hulk of the
setting duties for the Warriors and is
also their second-leading digger be
hind libero Ric Cervantes. Steven
Grgas is the team's top blocker.

On the Cardinal side of the net, the
top hitter is sophomore opposite hit
ter Evan Romero with 240 kills. Shoji
has been splitting time with junior
Miki Groppi at setter and the pair
have combined for 12.5 assists per
game. Romero is also the team's top
server while Shoji leads in digs. Junior
Brandon Williams anchors the Cardi
nal blocking with 44. while six other
players have registered at least 20 on
the season.
For the second week in a row.
Stanford will he in the unusual posi
tion of playing the same team two
nights in a row. a situation caused by
the wide geographic range of the

MPSF.
I think it is a good thing and we
can't do it too much in our league."
Kosty said."You get to try something
and see if it works and then make
changes. It's similar to halftime in a
football game, when you get to ana
lyze what you just did and change
what you need to."
The Cardinal and Warriors face off
tonight at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion
and again tomorrow night, also at 7
p.m. Admission to all of the team's
games is free to the public.
