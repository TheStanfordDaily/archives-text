### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
When the No. 9 Stanford men's volleyball
team takes the court tonight, it will be a re
union of sorts for several of the Cardinal play
ers. Four of them will be facing off with their
hometown team, the Honolulu-based Hawaii
Warriors.
Sophomore Kawika Shoji and freshmen
Spencer McLachlin, Max Halvorson and Jor
dan Inafuku all came to Stanford from
Hawaii, where they played for rival high
schools in Honolulu. Shoji has a particularly
strong connection to the University, where his
father Dave has been the women's vollevball

coach since 1975.
ITie four w ill see some familiar faces across
the net — Hawai'i's setter Sean Carney at
tended lolani School with Shoji, while middle
blocker Keali'i Frank played with McLachlin
and Halvorson at Punahou School.
"1 think it helps us. especially with our
younger players, because it adds a little more
motivation." head coach John Kosty said of
the familiarity between the teams. "A lot of the
teams we play they have never seen before.
For instance, Pepperdine— our freshmen
have never played against those guys even in
club.
"Also, it's the University of Hawaii — for
Kawika. he has been a part of that university

for a long, long time with his dad coaching
there. He's seen a lot of UH volleyball and
likes competing against them because he
knows the program so well."
The Cardinal (10-6,6-6 MPSF) come into
the midweek doubleheader against the War
riors riding the momentum of a dominating
sweep of then-top-ranked Brigham Young
last weekend. Stanford lost to the Cougars in
five games on Friday before stunning them in
only three on Saturday. Though the Cardinal
stayed at No. l ) in the rankings. BYU dropped
from first to third.
