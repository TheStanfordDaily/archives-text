# For love of THE POOL

Under the fiery afternoon sunlight
the swimmers' tightly intertwined
muscles and veins seem carved
out of bronze and anointed with
gasoline as they plunge into the
rippling waves at strict rhythmical cadences.
With each rise and fall of the syncopated limbs
the lanky bodies glide headlong within the 15
lanes of Avery Pool.
One lap. Flip turn.Two laps. Flip turn.Three
laps. After ten laps. Stanford senior Karl
Boehringer accelerates towards the end with a
grandiose double-kick — a coup de grace —
lifts his head out of the water to glance at the
sun through his dark-tinted goggles with a sat

It's true that professional and college-level
sports can be grueling on the body and grue
some to the senses. For swimmers, it's even
more the case. According to Stanford swim
ming assistant coach Ted Knapp. Cardinal
swimmers sometimes practice up to four
hours on critical competition days. The team
still maintains an average G PA of 3.2 and a 100
percent graduation rate, however.
"It takes tremendous discipline and work
ethic to be a Stanford student-athlete," Knapp
said.
Karl Boehringer's typical day during the
swimming season — which is coming to a
head with the Pac-10 Championships in less
than a week and the National Championships
in less than a month — starts with morning
practice from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, followed by after
noon practice from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. every

day of the week. Saturday morning practices
often start at 7:3oand continue until 9:30 or 10.
Meets occur once during November.once dur
ing December, while dual meets take place
every January and February. After the season
ends in late March, the Cardinal swimmers
will take a two to three week break before re-

intense schedule of collegiate athletics. He
competes for the love of the sport, and any
