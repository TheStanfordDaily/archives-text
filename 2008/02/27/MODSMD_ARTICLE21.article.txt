# For love of THE POOL

### BY DONG LIU 
Under the fiery afternoon sunlight
the swimmers' tightly intertwined
muscles and veins seem carved
out of bronze and anointed with
gasoline as they plunge into the
rippling waves at strict rhythmical cadences.
With each rise and fall of the syncopated limbs
the lanky bodies glide headlong within the 15
lanes of Avery Pool.
One lap. Flip turn.Two laps. Flip turn.Three
laps. After ten laps. Stanford senior Karl
Boehringer accelerates towards the end with a
grandiose double-kick — a coup de grace —
lifts his head out of the water to glance at the
sun through his dark-tinted goggles with a sat
isfied smile — the triumph of an unrelenting
athlete.

It's true that professional and college-level
sports can be grueling on the body and grue
some to the senses. For swimmers, it's even
more the case. According to Stanford swim
ming assistant coach Ted Knapp. Cardinal
swimmers sometimes practice up to four
hours on critical competition days. The team
still maintains an average G PA of 3.2 and a 100
percent graduation rate, however.
"It takes tremendous discipline and work
ethic to be a Stanford student-athlete," Knapp
said.
Karl Boehringer's typical day during the
swimming season — which is coming to a
head with the Pac-10 Championships in less
than a week and the National Championships
in less than a month — starts with morning
practice from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, followed by after
noon practice from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. every

day of the week. Saturday morning practices
often start at 7:3oand continue until 9:30 or 10.
Meets occur once during November.once dur
ing December, while dual meets take place
every January and February. After the season
ends in late March, the Cardinal swimmers
will take a two to three week break before re-

suming practice for USA club swim
ming during the summer.
Even in face of all such demand
ing obligations, Boehringer's love for
swimming remains strong. Growing
up in his hometown of Baton Rouge,
La., his most vivid childhood memo
ries include playing in the pool in the
summer with his neighborhood
friends.
"It's what all kids do, you know,"
Boehringer said. "For me to be able
to swim competitively was never a
dream. I just loved swimming for
what it is."
His passion for competitive swim
ming didn't blossom until he joined
his high school swimming team dur
ing sophomore year. Having friends
to push one another in getting ahead
made his team experience both re
warding and entertaining. His three
years on the high school team sharp
ened his physical technique as well
as his mental preparation;swimming
became a way of fraternal bonding,
personal accomplishment and daily
excitement.
"Pretty soon 1 got to really enjoy
the competition." he said."l was hav
ing fun as well as achieving success.
"But personally, I would rather
have fun," he continued. "Because
you could never be successful doing
something that you do not love. And
wanting to be successful is some
times not as enjoyable as it seems."
Boehringer got to enjoy the best of
both worlds. By the time he graduat
ed from high school in 2004,
Boehringer had won three letters,
was twice a high school All-Ameri
can and twice the Outstanding
Sprinter for his community club
team. Although primarily a breast
stroker. his physical versatility al
lowed him to switch between differ
ent strokes with minimal difficulty.

and he was state champion in both
the 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard
breaststroke.
Boehringer's capabilities attract
ed the Stanford swimming coaches
at the all-state high school meet his
senior year, prompting their decision
to recruit him. Although currently
on partial scholarship as a swimmer,
he says he swam at Stanford for the
fun of the sport and love for the
team. The scholarship opportunity
was merely an extraneous benefit.
"1 don't think about, have never
thought about, the scholarship as a
way to allow me to come to school."
Boehringer said.
Assistant coach Ted Knapp,
Boehringer's coach for all four years
at Stanford, observed that he had
outstanding butterfly potential de
spite his specialization in breast
stroke. While most breaststrokers
are distinguished by the power of
their kicks, Knapp said that
Boehringer had "wonderful upper
body strength." which enabled him
to push off the pool wall every 25
yards with aggressive speed and
streamlined smoothness — in effect
getting a head start over other com
petitors.
"He is right there with the very
best at pulling-down from the walls,"
Knapp said.
'Throughout his all four years on
the Stanford swimming team,
Boehringer has compiled an impres
sive list of honors and awards, includ
ing competing in the 100-yard
breaststroke and 50-yard freestyle in
the Pac-10 Championship from his
freshman to junior years. He also
swam the 100-meter breaststroke at
the Summer Nationals from 2005-07
and was a member of the winning
800-meter freestyle relay at the 2004
Sectionals Meet.
Yet to Boehringer, personal
achievement means little when com
pared to teamwork and genuine ap
preciation of the sport. He claims
that the best part of being on the
Stanford swim team is seeing the rest

of the team "cheerful and excited to
swim fast at the end of the year,
[while] hoping for them to achieve
and hoping to achieve the same for
myself.
"1 wouldn't call myself the vocal
and the dominating kind on the
team," Boehringer said."! just want
to fit in and hang out with the guys.
It's all about being part of the team."
His friendships with other accom
plished swimmers such as junior
Chris Ash, sophomore Sven Hinrich
sen and senior Egan Gans were ce
mented during his years on the Farm.
Currently a senior preparing to
graduate in June, Boehringer sum
marized his collegiate professional
swimming career: "Swimming is un
predictable," he said.
"Sometimes you have a great sea
son but your times disappoint;some
times you have a mediocre season
but your times astonish. But coming
to Stanford and swimming on the
team allowed me to explore the
sport that I love."
When asked where the sport of
swimming will take him, Boehringer
said,"These are the last few weeks of
my swimming career — competi
tively — at least."
And so he beats on, arms against
the current, charging ceaselessly into
the future.

at the all-state high school meet his
senior year, prompting their decision
to recruit him. Although currently
on partial scholarship as a swimmer,
he says he swam at Stanford for the
fun of the sport and love for the
team. The scholarship opportunity
was merely an extraneous benefit.
"1 don't think about, have never
thought about, the scholarship as a
way to allow me to come to school."
Boehringer said.
Assistant coach Ted Knapp,
Boehringer's coach for all four years
at Stanford, observed that he had
outstanding butterfly potential de
spite his specialization in breast
stroke. While most breaststrokers
are distinguished by the power of
their kicks, Knapp said that
Boehringer had "wonderful upper
body strength." which enabled him
to push off the pool wall every 25
yards with aggressive speed and
streamlined smoothness — in effect
getting a head start over other com
petitors.
"He is right there with the very
best at pulling-down from the walls,"
Knapp said.
'Throughout his all four years on
the Stanford swimming team,
Boehringer has compiled an impres
sive list of honors and awards, includ
ing competing in the 100-yard
breaststroke and 50-yard freestyle in
the Pac-10 Championship from his
freshman to junior years. He also
swam the 100-meter breaststroke at
the Summer Nationals from 2005-07
and was a member of the winning
800-meter freestyle relay at the 2004
Sectionals Meet.
Yet to Boehringer, personal
achievement means little when com
pared to teamwork and genuine ap
preciation of the sport. He claims
that the best part of being on the
Stanford swim team is seeing the rest

of the team "cheerful and excited to
swim fast at the end of the year,
[while] hoping for them to achieve
and hoping to achieve the same for
myself.
"1 wouldn't call myself the vocal
and the dominating kind on the
team," Boehringer said."! just want
to fit in and hang out with the guys.
It's all about being part of the team."
His friendships with other accom
plished swimmers such as junior
Chris Ash, sophomore Sven Hinrich
sen and senior Egan Gans were ce
mented during his years on the Farm.
Currently a senior preparing to
graduate in June, Boehringer sum
marized his collegiate professional
swimming career: "Swimming is un
predictable," he said.
"Sometimes you have a great sea
son but your times disappoint;some
times you have a mediocre season
but your times astonish. But coming
to Stanford and swimming on the
team allowed me to explore the
sport that I love."
When asked where the sport of
swimming will take him, Boehringer
said,"These are the last few weeks of
my swimming career — competi
tively — at least."
And so he beats on, arms against
the current, charging ceaselessly into
the future.

Under the fiery afternoon sunlight
the swimmers' tightly intertwined
muscles and veins seem carved
out of bronze and anointed with
gasoline as they plunge into the
rippling waves at strict rhythmical cadences.
With each rise and fall of the syncopated limbs
the lanky bodies glide headlong within the 15
lanes of Avery Pool.
One lap. Flip turn.Two laps. Flip turn.Three
laps. After ten laps. Stanford senior Karl
Boehringer accelerates towards the end with a
grandiose double-kick — a coup de grace —
lifts his head out of the water to glance at the
sun through his dark-tinted goggles with a sat
isfied smile — the triumph of an unrelenting
athlete.

It's true that professional and college-level
sports can be grueling on the body and grue
some to the senses. For swimmers, it's even
more the case. According to Stanford swim
ming assistant coach Ted Knapp. Cardinal
swimmers sometimes practice up to four
hours on critical competition days. The team
still maintains an average G PA of 3.2 and a 100
percent graduation rate, however.
"It takes tremendous discipline and work
ethic to be a Stanford student-athlete," Knapp
said.
Karl Boehringer's typical day during the
swimming season — which is coming to a
head with the Pac-10 Championships in less
than a week and the National Championships
in less than a month — starts with morning
practice from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, followed by after
noon practice from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. every

day of the week. Saturday morning practices
often start at 7:3oand continue until 9:30 or 10.
Meets occur once during November.once dur
ing December, while dual meets take place
every January and February. After the season
ends in late March, the Cardinal swimmers
will take a two to three week break before re-

ming during the summer.
Even in face of all such demand
ing obligations, Boehringer's love for
swimming remains strong. Growing
up in his hometown of Baton Rouge,
La., his most vivid childhood memo
ries include playing in the pool in the
summer with his neighborhood
friends.
"It's what all kids do, you know,"
Boehringer said. "For me to be able
to swim competitively was never a
dream. I just loved swimming for
what it is."
His passion for competitive swim
ming didn't blossom until he joined
his high school swimming team dur
ing sophomore year. Having friends
to push one another in getting ahead
made his team experience both re
warding and entertaining. His three
years on the high school team sharp
ened his physical technique as well
as his mental preparation;swimming
became a way of fraternal bonding,
personal accomplishment and daily
excitement.
"Pretty soon 1 got to really enjoy
the competition." he said."l was hav
ing fun as well as achieving success.
"But personally, I would rather
have fun," he continued. "Because
you could never be successful doing
something that you do not love. And
wanting to be successful is some
times not as enjoyable as it seems."
Boehringer got to enjoy the best of
both worlds. By the time he graduat
ed from high school in 2004,
Boehringer had won three letters,
was twice a high school All-Ameri
can and twice the Outstanding
Sprinter for his community club
team. Although primarily a breast
stroker. his physical versatility al
lowed him to switch between differ
ent strokes with minimal difficulty.

and he was state champion in both
the 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard
breaststroke.
