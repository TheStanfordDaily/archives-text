## Card ready to defend Pac-10 title 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach, Calif,
has a long and storied tradition of world-class
swimmers, broken records and fast swimming.
The evidence displayed on the wall of Olympic
trials banners and yearly high school records re
veals Belmont to be a place where the best swim
mers compete. Although the facility itself is
slightly outdated and anything but cutting edge,
the pool's traditions have long roots. One of
them is the Stanford men's swim team's 25 con
secutive Pacific-10 Conference titles.
No. 3 Stanford will seek to extend the streak
to 26 beginning next Wednesday, Mar. 5 in Long
Beach. Coming off a comfortable win over Cal
over the weekend, the men's team has tremen
dous confidence going into the meet. Stanford
has a record of 7-1 with its only loss coming
against Arizona and a 6-0 record in the Pac-10.
"There is always a certain pressure to keep
the streak alive as the team does not want to be
remembered as the team that broke it." ex
plained junior Jason Dunford. "However, that
said, the ultimate goal is to peak at NC'AAs.
ITiose who need cuts [to compete at NCAAs]
must be focused on getting them at Pac-lOs so
they can go to the bigger meet, [so] that we can
have as strong a team as possible there."
Stanford swimmers will be focused on the
Pac-10 meet to swim for NCAA cuts. Only those
who qualify for NCAA cuts may swim at the
NCAA championships. Last year's national high
school swimmer of the year, freshman Austin
Staab. has the team's top time in the 50 free fol
lowed by Dunford. Jason is a member of the

Long Beach, Calif.
All Day
NOTES: The Stanford men's swimming team prepares for
the Pac-10 Championships beginning on Wednesday
next week. Stanford has won 25 consecutive Pac-10 titles
and looks to make it 26 nexl week. The No. 3 Cardinal is
led by junior Jason Dunford and freshman Austin Staab.
They are 6-1 in the Pac-10, with their only loss against un
defeated No. 2 Arizona. The diving team begins its Pac
-10 Championships today in Federal Way, Wash.
Kenyan national team and will be
competing in the 2008 Beijing
Olympics.
Staab, Dunford. and senior Daniel
Beal will lead the group in the 100
free while Beal. Dunford. sophomore
Andrew Trepp, freshman David
Mosko and senior captain Phillip
Morrison provide depth in the 200
free. Beal, Mosko and Morrison will
also hope to swim the 500 free at
NCAAs. Distance aces Mosko, fresh
man Scotty Korotkin,and senior Noa
Sakamoto will swim for cuts in the
1650 free. Sophomore Eugene
Godsoe, freshman Josh Charnin-
Aker and junior Scott Lathrope are
the Cardinal's main 1 (X) and 200 back
stroke rs.
"Our biggest strength is our ability
to come together as a team to win
meets," said Charnin-Aker. "I would
argue that we do have some 'big guns'
this year, but every single member of
the team is intently focused on the
team victories in the upcoming weeks.
"Although we don't really have a
weak event this year, next year's class,
including the nation's top young
breaststroker and distance freestyler,
will add needed points across
the board."
In particular, Stanford will be even

stronger next year with top distance
recruit Chad La Tourette, who opted
to train at his native Mission Viejo
club in preparation for Olympic Trials
rather than enter the college season.
Curtis Lovelace of Nashville
Aquatic Club will bolster the already
strong Stanford breaststroke squad of
junior captain Nate Cass, junior cap
tain Paul Kornfeld, senior Egan Gans,
freshman John Criste, senior Karl
Boehringer, junior Chris Ash and jun
ior Paul Zaich. This year, all seven
breaststrokers have the potential to
achieve NCAA cuts, and will attempt
to do so at Pac-lOs.
"We can only worry about what
we can do as a team to get better and
take care of our business in the pool
and not worry about what the other
teams are doing." said Kornfeld. "If
everyone on the team goes best times
and achieves their goals we will put
ourselves in excellent position to win
NCAAs and that is all we can control.
"These next few weeks we will be
making small adjustments and really
beginning to swim fast setting ourselves
up for the Pac-10 Championships and
NCAAs."
The men's dive team will travel to
Federal Way. Wash, for Pac-lOs today
while the swim team will leave next
week. The NCAA championships
will be held at the same site. Mar. 27-
29.
