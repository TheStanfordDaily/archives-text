# MEN'S SWIMMING
## Card ready to defend Pac-10 title 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach, Calif,
has a long and storied tradition of world-class
swimmers, broken records and fast swimming.
The evidence displayed on the wall of Olympic
trials banners and yearly high school records re
veals Belmont to be a place where the best swim
mers compete. Although the facility itself is
slightly outdated and anything but cutting edge,
the pool's traditions have long roots. One of
them is the Stanford men's swim team's 25 con
secutive Pacific-10 Conference titles.
No. 3 Stanford will seek to extend the streak
to 26 beginning next Wednesday, Mar. 5 in Long
Beach. Coming off a comfortable win over Cal
over the weekend, the men's team has tremen
dous confidence going into the meet. Stanford
has a record of 7-1 with its only loss coming
against Arizona and a 6-0 record in the Pac-10.
"There is always a certain pressure to keep
the streak alive as the team does not want to be
remembered as the team that broke it." ex
plained junior Jason Dunford. "However, that
said, the ultimate goal is to peak at NC'AAs.
ITiose who need cuts [to compete at NCAAs]
must be focused on getting them at Pac-lOs so
they can go to the bigger meet, [so] that we can
have as strong a team as possible there."
Stanford swimmers will be focused on the
Pac-10 meet to swim for NCAA cuts. Only those
who qualify for NCAA cuts may swim at the
NCAA championships. Last year's national high
school swimmer of the year, freshman Austin
Staab. has the team's top time in the 50 free fol
lowed by Dunford. Jason is a member of the
