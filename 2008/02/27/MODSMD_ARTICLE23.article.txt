# Baseball on the horizon

### 
You'll forgive its earliness, I
know, because you're probably
a lot like me. Sure, the NBA is
entertaining, and the Hurry of deadline
deals and marquee players changing
hands makes it all the more so. But
with more than a month and a half be
tween now and the playoffs it's hard to
get too excited about the Association
just yet. And even with March just
around the corner, it doesn't yet seem
like the annual madness is ready to set
in.
If you're like me.you're thinking it's
time for baseball. So. with the Cardinal
season already underway and Major
League spring training taking place,
maybe a preview of the 2008 MLB sea
son isn't completely uncalled for.
So who emerges to take the 2008
title? Obviously, it's too soon to ven
ture any sort of an educated opinion,
which is why readers should be glad
that my opinion is entirely uneducat
ed. So not only will 1 pick a winner for
you, I'll pick all the playoff teams
(probably with an astounding degree
of inaccuracy) months in advance.
In the American League, the story
is simply one of the haves and have
nots. On the one hand, there are the
squads everyone knows will be in con
tention all season long â€” the defend
ing champion Boston Red Sox and
New York Yankees in the East, the De
troit Tigers and Cleveland Indians in
the Central, and the Los Angeles An
gels of Anaheim in the West.
It's obvious that the East has to
come down to either the Yankees or
Red Sox.The two biggest financial jug
gernauts of baseball also boast per
haps its most talented rosters, blending
promising youth like Joba Chamber
lain and Clay Buchholz with reliable
veteran difference-makers like Manny
Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez.
Ultimately, look for the Red Sox's
slightly better rotation to make the dif
ference in the end. but depending on
how Chamberlain and Phil Hughes de
velop. that could change soon.
Whichever team doesn't win the divi
sion should have a nice Wild Card
prize waiting for it at the end of the sea
son.
In the AL Central and West, it's
much easier to call. Detroit's offseason
acquisition of one of the best hitters in
baseball in Miguel Cabrera should
vault them into the playoffs, while I see
Anaheim running away with the West
and the best record in the AL.
On the National League side, things
get a lot more interesting. To be sure,
there are plenty of teams that are out
of it from the start (our local San Fran
cisco Giants come, sadly, to mind), but
there are few true front-runners for the
NL crown. In the East, the experts say
you should take the Mets, and it's hard
to argue with them there. But as I've in
timated earlier, I'm no expert, so I'm
taking the Phillies. Look for Cole
1 lamels to take a big leap forward and
become one of the best starters in
baseball.
Aside from that, I just can't see an
offensive core made up of Chase
Utley, Ryan Howard. Jimmy Rollins,
and. yes, even Pat "The Bat" Burrell,
being denied from postseason play. It's
splitting hairs. 1 grant you. but 1 think
I'd rather have that group than the
Mets' amazing lineup featuring David
Wright. Jose Reyes and Carlos Bel
tran. New York will make the playoffs,
but they will have to be content to do it
as a Wild Card in both leagues.
In the Central, it's another two
team race with the Cubs versus the
Brewers. There's a lot of offense on
both sides of this battle, but the Cubs, at
least, have one truly dominant pitcher
on their staff in Quios Zambrano. I see
that making the difference down the
stretch. Cincinnati could sneak into the
race if youngsters like Homer Bailey
and Jay Bruce develop quickly, but it's
probably 'wait 'til next year' for the
Reds, whose fans can take heart that
next year truly could be spectacular for
a team with some very good players
now and more on the way.
Hie West is probably the most un
predictable division in baseball, with
only the Giants dead in the waters of
McCovey Cove before the season
starts. Yet even they have the kind of
rotation that would be the envy of
many contendiim teams.

Yes, pitching is the story of
the west, from the newly arrived Dan
Haren, to old standbys like Jake
Peavy and Brandon Webb, to young
sters like Chad Billingsley, Matt Cain
and Tim Lincecum. The West has
more guys with either pasts or possi
ble futures as staff ace pitchers than
any other division. In the end, I think
the Arizona Diamondbacks take the
division, thanks to a young offense
with a year under its belt that should
keep getting better and the afore
mentioned killer duo of Webb and
Haren.
So who takes it all? Well, you'll
have to wait until October to know
for sure. But if you want to know
where the dumb money (i.e. me) is
going, then be my guest.
Detroit over Arizona in six games.
Thanks to a perfect game by Justin
Verlander and five homers in
game six from Miguel Cabrera ...
.and any other extreme improbabili
ties you can conjure up to get your
selves excited. Because ladies and
gentlemen, baseball's back.
And not a moment too soon.

Denis Griffin is dreaming of October
in February. Email him at djgriff@stan
