Football begins Spring
Practice
Almost three months after claim
ing the Axe back from Cal, the Stan
ford football team began its annual
Spring Ball today. Coach Jim Har
baugh is back for his second year as
Stanford's head coach after record
ing a 4-8 record last season, which in
cluded monumental wins over
Southern California and the rival
Golden Bears.
Yesterday was the first of 15 prac
tices scheduled to take place within
the next month, culminating in the
team's Spring Game on April 12.
Ifiough many say that Harbaugh
achieved much success in his first

year, he is far from satisfied and has
set his sights much higher than in the
2007 season.
Stanford will return many key play
ers on defense, including 12 players
that made at least four starts last year
and 10 of its top 11 tacklers. The of
fense will have to cope with the loss
of quarterback T.C. Ostrander as
well as wide receivers Evan Moore
and Mark Bradford, hut returns the
top four rushers from last year, quar
terback Tavita Pritchard.and most of
the offensive line.
Women's cross country keeps
on winning
The awards and accolades keep
on coming for the Stanford women's

cross country team. The ladies cap
tured their third NCAA champi
onship in a row last fall, and earlier
this week were named the USTFCC
CA women's cross country All-Aca
demic team of the year. This is the
second straight year the team has
won the honor.
This year, the team maintained a
cumulative grade point average of
3.47 throughout the season. Addition
ally, four Stanford runners were
named USTFCCCA Academic All-
Americans: junior Katie Harrington
and seniors Arianna Lambie, Lindsay
Allen and Teresa McWalters.The four
selections for Stanford were the most
of any women's team in the country.
