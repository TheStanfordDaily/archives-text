# Diversity Week encourages discussion of underrepresented minorities
## Univ.addresses grad diversity 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
While Stanford often prides itself on the
diversity of its undergraduate student body,
data indicates that the University is failing to
maintain diverse graduate student and faculty
populations.
As part of Diversity Week at Stanford, Vice
Provost of Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport said in a presentation yesterday that
underrepresented minorities (URMs) such as
African-Americans and Hispanics account for
only 8.5 percent of the graduate population,
compared to 25.4 percent of the undergraduate
population.
"While the overall graduate population has
grown 23 percent since 1985, African-American
graduate students have declined by 22 percent
and Native American populations have
declined by 21 percent," she said.
Gumport said that advancing the amount of
diversity in graduate student population is one
of the main goals of her office.
"By diversity, we include race, gender,
socioeconomic status, sexuality and lots of
other things," Gumport said. "The overarching

view is that we will be more excellent in aca

diversity in life experience."
Gumport said that the biggest problem that
she faces in attacking this problem is that the
academic pipeline seems to filter out URMs
and women as the level of education gets high
er.
"That's the challenge with diversifying at
our level." she said. "We have to start in the

lower levels of education. This is a systemic
problem, from B.S. recipients to the Ph.D. to
faculty. For URMs there's a decline in partici
pation at these key points."
In order to raise the level of diversity.
Gumport has initiated a number of programs to
ensure a broader recruitment pool for Stanford
departments.
"The one I'm most excited about is the new
Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence
(DARE) fellows program," she said. "DARE
gives full support for students to complete the
last two years of their Ph.D. dissertation. The
objective of the program is to diversify the fac
ulty pipeline going up. preparing URM stu
dents for academic careers."
Gumport said DARE fellows will also be
able to participate in projects dealing with pro
motion of diversity in the undergraduate com
munity.
The shortage of URMs and women in the
graduate population mirrors the lack of diversi
ty in faculty. On Monday, Vice Provost of
Faculty Development Patricia Jones spoke
about the University's commitment to ensure
