# Diversity Week encourages discussion of underrepresented minorities
## Univ.addresses grad diversity 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
While Stanford often prides itself on the
diversity of its undergraduate student body,
data indicates that the University is failing to
maintain diverse graduate student and faculty
populations.
As part of Diversity Week at Stanford, Vice
Provost of Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport said in a presentation yesterday that
underrepresented minorities (URMs) such as
African-Americans and Hispanics account for
only 8.5 percent of the graduate population,
compared to 25.4 percent of the undergraduate
population.
"While the overall graduate population has
grown 23 percent since 1985, African-American
graduate students have declined by 22 percent
and Native American populations have
declined by 21 percent," she said.
Gumport said that advancing the amount of
diversity in graduate student population is one
of the main goals of her office.
"By diversity, we include race, gender,
socioeconomic status, sexuality and lots of
other things," Gumport said. "The overarching

view is that we will be more excellent in aca
demic pursuit the more diverse we are; that is.
diversity in life experience."
Gumport said that the biggest problem that
she faces in attacking this problem is that the
academic pipeline seems to filter out URMs
and women as the level of education gets high
er.
"That's the challenge with diversifying at
our level." she said. "We have to start in the

lower levels of education. This is a systemic
problem, from B.S. recipients to the Ph.D. to
faculty. For URMs there's a decline in partici
pation at these key points."
In order to raise the level of diversity.
Gumport has initiated a number of programs to
ensure a broader recruitment pool for Stanford
departments.
"The one I'm most excited about is the new
Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence
(DARE) fellows program," she said. "DARE
gives full support for students to complete the
last two years of their Ph.D. dissertation. The
objective of the program is to diversify the fac
ulty pipeline going up. preparing URM stu
dents for academic careers."
Gumport said DARE fellows will also be
able to participate in projects dealing with pro
motion of diversity in the undergraduate com
munity.
The shortage of URMs and women in the
graduate population mirrors the lack of diversi
ty in faculty. On Monday, Vice Provost of
Faculty Development Patricia Jones spoke
about the University's commitment to ensure
the retention of a diverse faculty.
"Commitment to faculty diversi
ty has been shown [in] statements
by the President and Provost," she
said, "as well as by the Board of
Trustees, which monitors how we do
in faculty diversity."
Jones said that current recruit
ment procedures pose a challenge
to ensuring diversity in faculty pop
ulations.
"What we find is that all the
departments don't necessarily
know what they should be doing,"
she said. " ITiey don't necessarily
know research that shows we all
have unconscious biases that influ
ence our decisions."
To correct these unconscious
biases, Jones and her office have
developed a program to educate
departmental leaders about these

issues.
"It doesn't necessarily work to
have training sessions for faculty,"
she said. "We were trying to figure
out how to engage faculty in con
versations and discussions to make
sure they're aware of both the chal
lenges in recruiting and the inap
propriate ways of evaluating candi
dates. We decided to pilot an
approach to engage our faculty in
conversations related to diversity
using interactive theatrical per
formances with sketches of aspects
of the faculty hiring department."
Jones developed the sketches,
now performed bv the Stanford
Interactive Theater Company (SIT
COM). with members of the drama
department. She said they have
received very positive feedback.
While the events being held dur
ing Diversity Week mainly address
the issues of diversity in graduate
and faculty populations, undergrad
uates are encouraged to attend the
events.
"1 think events are an excellent

starting point to get interest of
undergraduate students to pursue
academia as a profession," said
ASSU Vice President Mondaire
Jones '09, who co-organized
Diversity Week with members of
the Graduate Student Council.
"The problem of non-representa
tion is only going to be solved per
manently through the expansion of
the pipeline, and I think we as
undergraduates, if we are interested
in something like this, should
become very informed about it."
Jones said he hopes Diversity
Week becomes an annual event.
A meeting of student leaders
from various communities on
Stanford campus, including LGBT.
Women's Community Center and
the Ethnic Umbrella organization,
will be held tomorrow, followed by
a publicity campaign on Thursday
and a concluding call to action next
Tuesday.
