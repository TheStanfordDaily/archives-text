## Cardinal wins Big Smash Stanford downs Cal for second straight win 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
I"he Stanford men's tennis team knew
exactly how they could heat No. 28
California yesterday: come out hot and win
the doubles point. Keep the momentum
and play well in singles.
And after convincing 8-3 victories by
No. 37 Stanford at both No. 1 and No. 2
doubles, the Cardinal claimed the point, the
momentum, four singles victories, and ulti
mately the match.
Stanford downed rival Cal 5-2 yesterday
in "The Big Smash", a match that was post
poned three days due to inclement weather
over the weekend. Maybe the Cardinal
needed the rest, because it played some
great tennis last night and avenged two
losses last year to the Golden Bears.
"It was a really great team effort," said
head coach John Whitlinger. "It was a very
good win over a very good California team.
"I'm pleased with everyone tonight.
Everyone stepped up."
