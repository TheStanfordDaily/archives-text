Pack at the door without letting them in. and
Stanford held on to win 4-3 at home yesterday.
Stringer came on in relief of Stanford junior
starter Max Fearnow to start the sixth inning, and
shut down the Wolf Pack the rest of the way, going
four innings for his second save of the season.
Nevada did not go quietly into the night, however, as
they were able to put runners on the corners with just
one out in the top of the ninth inning, trailing 4-3.
"1 was thinking.'don't get beat with anything but
my best.'" said Stringer."! ended the game with nine
straight breaking balls, and put the pitching selection
in [catcher Jason] Castro and [pitching] coach Jeff
Austin s hands. I knew that my curveball and my
slider were my best pitches today, and if 1 was going
to [get] beat it was going to be with those."
