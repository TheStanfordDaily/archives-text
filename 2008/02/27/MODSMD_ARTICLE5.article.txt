GAME NOTES: Stanford bounced back from a loss
to Saint Mary's and beat Nevada yesterday, 4-3.
Junior Max Fearnow allowed just three runs on
two hits to pick up the win, and senior David
Stringer picked up his second save of the season
in four innings of relief.

The off-speed stuff did the trick in
the end, getting Nevada second
baseman David Ciarlo to pop out to
second and catcher Tyson Jaquez—
who launched a three-run homer to
put the Wolf Pack ahead 3-2 in the
fifth inning — to ground out to third
to end the game and seal the victory
for the Cardinal.
"He didn't see anything hut
curveballs," said Stringer of the final
at hat against Jaquez.
For Stringer, the four-inning save
was one of the longer ones of his ca
reer.
"1 had heen working myself as a
starter this winter, so it wasn't too
had." he said.
Stringer allowed four hits while
striking out three.
In setting up Stringer for the save,
starter Max Fearnow had to handle
the Nevada bats for the first few in
nings. Coming off a lights-out start
last weekend (no hits, one walk and
four strikeouts in three innings in a
game cut short due to rain), Fearnow
was nearly unhittable once again. 1 le
retired the first 10 Wolf Pack batters
he faced before finally allowing a
single to third baseman Jason Ro
driguez in the fourth.
The only bump in the road came
during the fifth, when Fearnow hit
shortstop Kevin Rodland and Ciarlo
to put two on with two outs. That

brought Jaquez to the plate, who
turned on a high fastball and
launched it over the left field fence
for the only Nevada runs on the day.
Fearnow finished out the inning, get
ting his only strike out of the day
against Nevada leadoff hitter Jason
Sadoian in a rather unorthodox way.
Fearnow was ahead in the count
1-2 to Sadoian when he tried to de
liver a pitch inside. Sadoian dangled
his elbow out over the plate and was
hit by the pitch, but before he could
take two steps towards first, home
plate umpire Ted Kovach called
Sadoian out on strikes for intention
ally getting hit by the pitch. Sadoian
was also injured on the play, and
came out of the game.
Fearnow earned the win, allowing
just two hits and three earned runs in
five innings. He attributed his suc
cess to his off-season preparation
with the team's new pitching coach,
Jeff Austin.
"1 am really prepared [this sea
son] mentally and physically," said
Fearnow. "Coach Austin has totally
restructured our workouts. 1 think
you will see the results this year with
our pitching staff. Instead of being
good for an inning, now we are good
for five or six innings because our
legs are stronger and we are stronger
mentally."
But of course it took contribu
tions from the Stanford offense to
win as well. Freshman shortstop Jake
Schlander hit an RBI single in the
first to put the Card up 2-0. In the
fifth, Stanford answered the Jaquez
home run immediately as junior cen

terfielder Sean Ratliff delivered an
RBI single to score junior Cord
Phelps. Catcher Jason Castro added
a sacrifice fly to score Brenden Do
maracki, making the score 4-3.
Phelps also had a career day, notch
ing four hits for the first time and fin
ishing 4-5.
"It was nice to squeak some balls
through holes." said Phelps. "I
thought I got a little bit lucky, but
that is kind of how baseball goes, and
it was really good to get a four-hit
day."
Phelps also credited his success so
far this season to being fully healthy
for the first time since his freshman
season.
"It's really nice to be healthy,"
said Phelps. "Playing with a hurt
back last year was hard, but it is real
ly good to be healthy this season."
Nevada starter Mario Rivera was
charged with the loss, allowing seven
hits and four runs in just four innings
on the hill for the Wolf Pack. With
the win Stanford is now 3-2. while
Nevada falls to 1-2.
Stanford returns to action with a
three-game series this weekend at
Klein Field at Sunken Diamond

put the Wolf Pack ahead 3-2 in the
fifth inning — to ground out to third
to end the game and seal the victory
for the Cardinal.
"He didn't see anything hut
curveballs," said Stringer of the final
at hat against Jaquez.
For Stringer, the four-inning save
was one of the longer ones of his ca
reer.
"1 had heen working myself as a
starter this winter, so it wasn't too
had." he said.
Stringer allowed four hits while
striking out three.
In setting up Stringer for the save,
starter Max Fearnow had to handle
the Nevada bats for the first few in
nings. Coming off a lights-out start
last weekend (no hits, one walk and
four strikeouts in three innings in a
game cut short due to rain), Fearnow
was nearly unhittable once again. 1 le
retired the first 10 Wolf Pack batters
he faced before finally allowing a
single to third baseman Jason Ro
driguez in the fourth.
The only bump in the road came
during the fifth, when Fearnow hit
shortstop Kevin Rodland and Ciarlo
to put two on with two outs. That

brought Jaquez to the plate, who
turned on a high fastball and
launched it over the left field fence
for the only Nevada runs on the day.
Fearnow finished out the inning, get
ting his only strike out of the day
against Nevada leadoff hitter Jason
Sadoian in a rather unorthodox way.
Fearnow was ahead in the count
1-2 to Sadoian when he tried to de
liver a pitch inside. Sadoian dangled
his elbow out over the plate and was
hit by the pitch, but before he could
take two steps towards first, home
plate umpire Ted Kovach called
Sadoian out on strikes for intention
ally getting hit by the pitch. Sadoian
was also injured on the play, and
came out of the game.
Fearnow earned the win, allowing
just two hits and three earned runs in
five innings. He attributed his suc
cess to his off-season preparation
with the team's new pitching coach,
Jeff Austin.
"1 am really prepared [this sea
son] mentally and physically," said
Fearnow. "Coach Austin has totally
restructured our workouts. 1 think
you will see the results this year with
our pitching staff. Instead of being
good for an inning, now we are good
for five or six innings because our
legs are stronger and we are stronger
mentally."
But of course it took contribu
tions from the Stanford offense to
win as well. Freshman shortstop Jake
Schlander hit an RBI single in the
first to put the Card up 2-0. In the
fifth, Stanford answered the Jaquez
home run immediately as junior cen

terfielder Sean Ratliff delivered an
RBI single to score junior Cord
Phelps. Catcher Jason Castro added
a sacrifice fly to score Brenden Do
maracki, making the score 4-3.
Phelps also had a career day, notch
ing four hits for the first time and fin
ishing 4-5.
"It was nice to squeak some balls
through holes." said Phelps. "I
thought I got a little bit lucky, but
that is kind of how baseball goes, and
it was really good to get a four-hit
day."
Phelps also credited his success so
far this season to being fully healthy
for the first time since his freshman
season.
"It's really nice to be healthy,"
said Phelps. "Playing with a hurt
back last year was hard, but it is real
ly good to be healthy this season."
Nevada starter Mario Rivera was
charged with the loss, allowing seven
hits and four runs in just four innings
on the hill for the Wolf Pack. With
the win Stanford is now 3-2. while
Nevada falls to 1-2.
Stanford returns to action with a
three-game series this weekend at

mond Red Out/Red Zone" night at
