## Profs. examine economic decline Experts assess future, Bush's fiscal policy 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President George W. Bush pub
licly stated yesterday that the U.S.
economy was not in a recession and
that he believed it would not fall
into a downturn. Given that eco
nomic reports show that U.S. con
sumer confidence has slumped to
its worst in five years, and home
prices fell 8.9 percent last year, his
view is not one that everyone
shares — including a number of
scholars at Stanford.
Emeritus Economics Prof.
Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize win
ning economist who formerly
served as vice president and chief
economist of the World Bank, said

Iliesday that the U.S. economy is
probably in a recession with the
housing-market collapse dragging
down consumer spending.
Michael Boskin, professor of
economics and senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, feels that the
economy will at best reach aspects
of recession in 2008 and may even
have already entered one.
"Whether we skirt recession or
not. it will not feel good economi
cally in the first half of the year." he
said. "The economy may well
rebound some in the latter part of
the year as primarily monetary, and
to a lesser extent fiscal stimulus
kick in."
Boskin went on to describe how
the epicenter of the problem is the
sharp deterioration in the housing
market and related financial instru
ments. most specifically, collateral
ized subprime mortgages. These
subprime mortgages were increas
ingly made with no money down,
no income verification and very
low starter teaser rates. Subprime
lending is the practice of making
loans to risky borrowers who do
not qualify for the best market
interest rates because of their defi
cient credit history.
The Federal Reserve "brilliant
ly" and "aggressively" lowered
interest rates to one percent to
combat the 2001 recession and
reduce the risk of outright defla
tion, Boskin explained. However,
he felt that they kept the rates
there for too long and raised them
too slowly once the economy
firmed in 2003.
"That easy money sparked a
housing price mini-bubble [in
which] prices went up far more
rapidly than income or rent,"
Boskin said. "That [bubble] is now
bursting and is a major but not the
only manifestation of paying the
price for the excessively easy mon
etary policy."
According to Boskin, the best
that can be hoped for is a growth in
net exports, which, driven by the
weaker dollar and growth abroad,
would offset the softer consumer
spending. Furthermore, if business
capital spending holds up, the blow
to the economy could be softened.
He said, however, that growth
abroad is likely to slow as well
because the notion that the other
economies have decoupled from
the American economy is
overblown, and many countries
have problems of their own, includ
ing unsustainable housing and land
prices.
A similarly negative view is held
by Nicholas Bloom, assistant pro
fessor of economics, who views the
future of the economy with pes
simism.
"Our economy at the moment is
at the same level as 9/11 and the
Cuban missile crisis put together,"
he said. "I don't think 1 have ever
seen a credit crunch of this size
before."
Not all professors have such a
somber outlook. Gavin Wright,
professor in American economic
history, was unsure of the future.
"1 do not know, and no one
knows with any confidence, how
severe or lasting the current down
turn will prove to be," Wright said.
But the fact that no one knows
the severity of the credit crunch is
what Bloom asserts is the very
problem.
"People wonder whether their
bank is the one that is going to go
under, which further generates
uncertainty," Bloom said.
People do not know where the
economy is heading and so uncer
tainty develops. He explained that

the surge of stock market volatility
is a good measure of uncertainty.
This uncertainty causes firms to
spend and invest cautiously.
Bloom gave the example of a
company planning to invest in new
machinery or employ new staff. In
a weak economy, the company will
want to wait before spending any
more money to see if the economic
situation improves. However, the
slowing of cash flow exacerbates
the situation.
"This is a direct effect of the
credit crunch," Bloom said. "The
uncertainty causes a rapid freeze in
activity. There have been 18 shocks
like this since 1960."
While Wright did not specifical
ly comment on the future, he felt
that some fiscal and monetary
stimuli may be justified in order to
improve the economy's outlook.
"The one outcome to be avoid
ed is using a temporary business
downturn as an excuse to exacer
bate and entrench a long-term fed
eral budget deficit," he warned.
Wright explained that such a
measure was introduced early in
the Bush administration, when
large tax cuts were implemented
shortly before a major expansion
of military spending.
"The resulting budget deficit is
the main proximate cause of the
trade deficit and the declining dol
lar," he said.
Wright added that all the talk of
recession should not divert peo
ple's attention away from what is,
in his opinion, the most serious
long-term problem facing the U.S.
economy — the high and widening
inequality of incomes. He said that
this was a problem to the extent
that median incomes have barely
changed even during a time of
business cycle recovery.
"Addressing that problem in a
serious way will have to involve an
entirely different policy toolkit,"
Wright said.
According to Bloom, during the
Clinton administration, when Alan
Greenspan served as chairman of
the Federal Reserve, productivity
grew at a rate of about one percent
a year. As a result, Americans are
now eight to ten percent wealthier
than their counterparts in Europe.
However, he said that the general
raise in productivity seems to have
ended around 2005, around the
same time that the U.S. appeared to
be heading toward a recession.
"The long-term beneficial
trends slowed down at the same
time as the other economic prob
lems kicked in, which makes the
future look even bleaker," Bloom
said.
However, the future may not be
entirely dreary.
"The silver lining is that, despite
its many problems, we have a
strong economic system —if we
can keep it," Boskin said, "and [we]
will get through these problems."

Greenspan served as chairman of
the Federal Reserve, productivity
grew at a rate of about one percent
a year. As a result, Americans are
now eight to ten percent wealthier
than their counterparts in Europe.
However, he said that the general
raise in productivity seems to have
ended around 2005, around the
same time that the U.S. appeared to
be heading toward a recession.
"The long-term beneficial
trends slowed down at the same
time as the other economic prob
lems kicked in, which makes the
future look even bleaker," Bloom
said.
However, the future may not be
entirely dreary.
"The silver lining is that, despite
its many problems, we have a
strong economic system —if we
can keep it," Boskin said, "and [we]
will get through these problems."

President George W. Bush pub
licly stated yesterday that the U.S.
economy was not in a recession and
that he believed it would not fall
into a downturn. Given that eco
nomic reports show that U.S. con
sumer confidence has slumped to
its worst in five years, and home
prices fell 8.9 percent last year, his
view is not one that everyone
shares — including a number of
scholars at Stanford.
Emeritus Economics Prof.
Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize win
ning economist who formerly
served as vice president and chief
economist of the World Bank, said

Iliesday that the U.S. economy is
probably in a recession with the
housing-market collapse dragging
down consumer spending.
Michael Boskin, professor of
economics and senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, feels that the
economy will at best reach aspects
of recession in 2008 and may even
have already entered one.
"Whether we skirt recession or
not. it will not feel good economi
cally in the first half of the year." he
said. "The economy may well
rebound some in the latter part of
the year as primarily monetary, and
to a lesser extent fiscal stimulus
kick in."
Boskin went on to describe how
the epicenter of the problem is the
sharp deterioration in the housing
market and related financial instru
ments. most specifically, collateral
ized subprime mortgages. These
subprime mortgages were increas
ingly made with no money down,
no income verification and very
low starter teaser rates. Subprime
lending is the practice of making
loans to risky borrowers who do
not qualify for the best market
interest rates because of their defi
cient credit history.
The Federal Reserve "brilliant
ly" and "aggressively" lowered
interest rates to one percent to
combat the 2001 recession and
reduce the risk of outright defla
tion, Boskin explained. However,
he felt that they kept the rates
there for too long and raised them
too slowly once the economy
firmed in 2003.
"That easy money sparked a
housing price mini-bubble [in
which] prices went up far more
rapidly than income or rent,"
Boskin said. "That [bubble] is now
bursting and is a major but not the
only manifestation of paying the
price for the excessively easy mon
etary policy."
According to Boskin, the best
that can be hoped for is a growth in
net exports, which, driven by the
weaker dollar and growth abroad,
would offset the softer consumer
spending. Furthermore, if business
capital spending holds up, the blow
to the economy could be softened.
He said, however, that growth
abroad is likely to slow as well
because the notion that the other
economies have decoupled from
the American economy is
overblown, and many countries
have problems of their own, includ
ing unsustainable housing and land
prices.
A similarly negative view is held
by Nicholas Bloom, assistant pro
fessor of economics, who views the
future of the economy with pes
simism.
"Our economy at the moment is
at the same level as 9/11 and the
Cuban missile crisis put together,"
he said. "I don't think 1 have ever
seen a credit crunch of this size
before."
Not all professors have such a
somber outlook. Gavin Wright,
professor in American economic
history, was unsure of the future.
"1 do not know, and no one
knows with any confidence, how
severe or lasting the current down
turn will prove to be," Wright said.
But the fact that no one knows
the severity of the credit crunch is
what Bloom asserts is the very
problem.
"People wonder whether their
bank is the one that is going to go
under, which further generates
uncertainty," Bloom said.
People do not know where the
economy is heading and so uncer
tainty develops. He explained that

the surge of stock market volatility
is a good measure of uncertainty.
This uncertainty causes firms to
spend and invest cautiously.
Bloom gave the example of a
company planning to invest in new
machinery or employ new staff. In
a weak economy, the company will
want to wait before spending any
more money to see if the economic
situation improves. However, the
slowing of cash flow exacerbates
the situation.
"This is a direct effect of the
credit crunch," Bloom said. "The
uncertainty causes a rapid freeze in
activity. There have been 18 shocks
like this since 1960."
While Wright did not specifical
ly comment on the future, he felt
that some fiscal and monetary
stimuli may be justified in order to
improve the economy's outlook.
"The one outcome to be avoid
ed is using a temporary business
downturn as an excuse to exacer
bate and entrench a long-term fed
eral budget deficit," he warned.
Wright explained that such a
measure was introduced early in
the Bush administration, when
large tax cuts were implemented
shortly before a major expansion
of military spending.
"The resulting budget deficit is
the main proximate cause of the
trade deficit and the declining dol
lar," he said.
Wright added that all the talk of
recession should not divert peo
ple's attention away from what is,
in his opinion, the most serious
long-term problem facing the U.S.
economy — the high and widening
inequality of incomes. He said that
this was a problem to the extent
that median incomes have barely
changed even during a time of
business cycle recovery.
"Addressing that problem in a
serious way will have to involve an
entirely different policy toolkit,"
Wright said.
According to Bloom, during the
Clinton administration, when Alan
Greenspan served as chairman of
the Federal Reserve, productivity
grew at a rate of about one percent
a year. As a result, Americans are
now eight to ten percent wealthier
than their counterparts in Europe.
However, he said that the general
raise in productivity seems to have
ended around 2005, around the
same time that the U.S. appeared to
be heading toward a recession.
"The long-term beneficial
trends slowed down at the same
time as the other economic prob
lems kicked in, which makes the
future look even bleaker," Bloom
said.
However, the future may not be
entirely dreary.
"The silver lining is that, despite
its many problems, we have a
strong economic system —if we
can keep it," Boskin said, "and [we]
will get through these problems."
