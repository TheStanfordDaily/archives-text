## Hoover acquires Baath Party records 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Shipping containers' worth of
records created by Iraq's Baath
Party — which ruled Iraq from
1%8 to 2(K)3 — will now find a new
home at the Hoover Institution.
Ilie Iraq Memory Foundation
(MF), a U.S.-based entity head
quartered in Washington, l).C'.,
went to Baghdad shortly after the
Iraq invasion and began gathering
and archiving as many documents
as it could. Initially, the Foundation
kept the materials in MF Director
Kanan Makiya's house, which is
within the Green Zone in Baghdad.
In February 20()5. Makiya allowed
the U.S. military to fly these materi

als to a military base in the U.S..
scan them and then transport the
materials to a storage facility of the
Foundation's choice. In January of
this year, the Hoover Institution
agreed to store this body of materi
als.
According to Richard Sousa,
senior associate director at the
Hoover Institution, the collection
consists of records from the Baath
Regional Command, from the
headquarters of the Baath Arab
Socialist Party and from the Special
Security Agency. However, they do
not comprise all of the records from
these entities.
"Thev constitute a considerable.
representative and very important
sample," Sousa said. "In addition,
the collection includes photos from
Iraqi newspapers and a few oral
histories."
However, there is some contro
versy regarding where the papers
should be held. Saad Eskander, the
director general of the Iraq
National Library and Archive, has
publicly argued that the records of
the Baath Party are inalienable
public property and should be
returned to Iraq's national archive
without delay.
Makiya does not agree, howev
er. While he feels that it is essential
that the documents are back among
the Iraqi people, he has publicly
stated that Iraq and Baghdad, while
mired in turmoil, are currently not
ready for the papers.
According to Trudy Peterson, a
former acting archivist of the

United States under President Bill
Clinton and an international
archival consultant, the records of
the government bodies and the
Baath party should be returned to
the government of Iraq to be main
tained as part of the official
records.
"The official records of the Iraqi
government need to go home to
Iraq, to the official custody of the
government of Iraq in its Iraqi
National Library and Archives."
she wrote on her Web site of the
decision to move the documents to
Hoover. ' The U.S. government
should be extremely careful as it
makes the determinations about
the destiny of the Iraqi materials in
its custody."
The MF came close to reaching
a deal with Harvard University in
2005, where it hoped to house a
digital copy of the collection,
according to the Chronicle of
Higher Education. Negotiations
fell through, however, because of
the complicated issues surrounding
the documents.
Sidney Verba, director of the

Harvard University Library at the
time, said to the Chronicle that it
was both a "relief" and a "great
regret" when Harvard pulled out of
the negotiations.
Sousa defended the Hoover
Institution's decision to store the
papers.
"The acquisition of this collec
tion is consistent with I loover's col
lecting philosophy since our incep
tion nearly ninety years ago," Sousa
said."[That philosophy is] to collect
and preserve material 011 political,
economic and social change in the
modern era and to provide access
— without conditions — to current
researchers and future genera
tions."
He explained that the Hoover
Institution's goal for the papers, as
with all their collections, is to pre
serve the materials and to under
take conservation efforts, which
would ensure that the papers will
be available to future scholars. Ik
added that they will retain digital
copies of these materials as well as
other material from Iraq that will
be made available to researchers.

According to Sousa, direct dis
cussions with the MF in efforts to
obtain the papers, which will not go
on exhibit, began about ten months
ago. However, he said that they had
been aware of the collection's exis
tence for a number of years previ
ously.
While some have publicly called
for the documents to be returned to
Iraq immediately, Sousa empha
sized that housing the papers at the
Hoover Institution is simply a
deposit agreement. He said he
agreed with those who felt that
conditions in Iraq today could put
the papers at risk. He explained
that the Hoover Institution is hold
ing these papers and will return
them to Iraq when it is agreed that
conditions in Iraq allow for their
return to a safe repository there,
which he hopes will be soon.
"The Hoover Institution does
not own these materials, it is a
repository for them," he said. "We
expect to return them to Iraq."
