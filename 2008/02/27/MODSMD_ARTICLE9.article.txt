Alex Hegyi "08 had not planned to be here.
To make it this far. He hadn't practiced, he
hadn't prepared, really, beyond maybe look
ing over the email of practice words. Now. here
he was. Behind him, his teammate, Sev
Guardado'o9. Before him. a sea of white
chairs, filled with people — parents and stu
dents, performers and already-eliminated
competitors — waiting, watching. Watching
him, standing behind the microphone.

Team Mariachi, as the MCs dubbed it. did
not appear at Old Union Saturday night with
designs on first place in the Project Read
Spelling Bee. In fact, Team Mariachi had little
to no spelling bee experience.They were a pair
of musicians, one a physics major and one a
psychology major, who wanted to reach out to
the community and help a good cause. That
was why Alex and Sev were here, in this ball
room, facing all these people—Charity.
Project Read, a student organization in its
infancy and young in both focus and history,
was recognized by the Office of Student Af
fairs only this month. The group is devoted to
promoting youth literacy in developing coun
tries, particularly India, by setting up school li
braries.
"Our goal," said Natasha Pereira '08, a
founder and co-president of Project Read, "is
to improve the access of traditionally disad
vantaged groups, like girls and lower income
students, by providing them with educational
materials."

In India, 17.8 percent of all schools have
fewer than 1(H) books available to students.
Project Read is committed to sending at least
500 non-school related books to each library it
supports.
The proceeds from the spelling bee, the
first incarnation of what the group hopes will
become an annual event, will go to obtaining
and shipping books to four different sites in
India. Eight Stanford students will also have
the opportunity to volunteer at those sites this
summer, leading English language programs
and helping organize free lending libraries.
Since the goal of the competition was simply
to raise money, the organizers didn't worry
about having some students compete solo and
others compete in teams.
"Most of the libraries we're setting up are
for children." explained Sarah Loaiza '09. the
group's event coordinator. Thus, the decision
to recreate the atmosphere of the übiquitous
elementary school spelling competition.
"B —A—"
Alex and Sev were two of 10 contestants in
the bee. Their competitors were Sarah Arora
'08: Peter Aim '08. representing Stanford's
competitive cheer squad; Hershey Avula '08.
the ASSU President; Sunil Parekh 08. from
Raagapella; Claudia Skieller '08 and Scott
Bland '10 from the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, who together
made "Team Band"; Pereira; and Calley
Means'oB. president of the Kappa Sigma Fra
ternity.
The Stanford Tree watched over ticket
sales outside the ballroom; a cappella groups
Fleet Street and Mixed Company performed
between rounds of intense — and amusing —
spelling challenges. And for almost a full hour.

contestants stood at the microphone, only six
or seven feet from the first row of the audi
ence, chuckling and frowning their way
through words from barista to distillate, statu
tory' to brassiere to phlegmatic.
ITie narrowing of the field was swift and
brutal. In this single-elimination competition,
a single misspelling, affirmed by the striking of
a gong by the official judge, Nobel Laureate
and Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff, was
enough to end any competitor's dreams of or
thographic glory.
At the end of the first round, all 10 contest
ants remained; by the end of the second round,
there were eight. By the end of the third, only
Team Mariachi, Hershey Avula and Sarah
Arora were left on stage. Confronted by the
polysyllabic challenge of "luminescence," Sev
and Alex shed their mariachi jackets in dis
tress, but in the semifinal round it was Sarah
Arora, confounded by the word "epochal,"
who left the stage, smiling and waving amidst
the echoes of the gong.
To the very end. the spellers were categori
cally modest.
"After 'tiramisu,'" Hershey admitted to the
crowd. "1 thought it was over." Despite his
dearth of confidence, Hershey came up
against Team Mariachi in the final round of
competition.
It was there, in the finals, that Hershey s
misspelling of "maraschino" brought Team
Mariachi within sight of spelling bee triumph.
As per typical bee rules, in the final round.
Team Mariachi would have to spell first the
word Hershey had missed, then another word,
to earn the title of champion. "Maraschino"
did not prove a problem for the dynamic duo.
But "rutabaga"?

By now, the room was silent.This one final
word stood between Team Mariachi and victo
ry. Only a couple letters to go.'lTie tension was
palpable.The gong was within reach.
"G — A."
And they'd done it. A hoot and a holler, a
rousing round of applause, some scattered
laughter and shaken hands, and Alex and Sev
were the first ever Project Read Spelling Bee
champions.
"I can't believe it," Alex said afterward,sur
rounded by family — it was, after all. Parents'
Weekend — and supporters. "It was totally
unexpected."
The prize for spelling prowess, in this case, was
no elaborate trophy or grand fame. Instead,
the winners derived their reward from the size
and support of the audience, from the satisfac
tion of a job well done.
"I feel great," Sev exclaimed."And we were
able to raise money for charity."

the ASSU President; Sunil Parekh 08. from
Raagapella; Claudia Skieller '08 and Scott
Bland '10 from the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, who together
made "Team Band"; Pereira; and Calley
Means'oB. president of the Kappa Sigma Fra
ternity.
The Stanford Tree watched over ticket
sales outside the ballroom; a cappella groups
Fleet Street and Mixed Company performed
between rounds of intense — and amusing —
spelling challenges. And for almost a full hour.

contestants stood at the microphone, only six
or seven feet from the first row of the audi
ence, chuckling and frowning their way
through words from barista to distillate, statu
tory' to brassiere to phlegmatic.
ITie narrowing of the field was swift and
brutal. In this single-elimination competition,
a single misspelling, affirmed by the striking of
a gong by the official judge, Nobel Laureate
and Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff, was
enough to end any competitor's dreams of or
thographic glory.
At the end of the first round, all 10 contest
ants remained; by the end of the second round,
there were eight. By the end of the third, only
Team Mariachi, Hershey Avula and Sarah
Arora were left on stage. Confronted by the
polysyllabic challenge of "luminescence," Sev
and Alex shed their mariachi jackets in dis
tress, but in the semifinal round it was Sarah
Arora, confounded by the word "epochal,"
who left the stage, smiling and waving amidst
the echoes of the gong.
To the very end. the spellers were categori
cally modest.
"After 'tiramisu,'" Hershey admitted to the
crowd. "1 thought it was over." Despite his
dearth of confidence, Hershey came up
against Team Mariachi in the final round of
competition.
It was there, in the finals, that Hershey s
misspelling of "maraschino" brought Team
Mariachi within sight of spelling bee triumph.
As per typical bee rules, in the final round.
Team Mariachi would have to spell first the
word Hershey had missed, then another word,
to earn the title of champion. "Maraschino"
did not prove a problem for the dynamic duo.
But "rutabaga"?

By now, the room was silent.This one final
word stood between Team Mariachi and victo
ry. Only a couple letters to go.'lTie tension was
palpable.The gong was within reach.
"G — A."
And they'd done it. A hoot and a holler, a
rousing round of applause, some scattered
laughter and shaken hands, and Alex and Sev
were the first ever Project Read Spelling Bee
champions.
"I can't believe it," Alex said afterward,sur
rounded by family — it was, after all. Parents'
Weekend — and supporters. "It was totally
unexpected."
The prize for spelling prowess, in this case, was
no elaborate trophy or grand fame. Instead,
the winners derived their reward from the size
and support of the audience, from the satisfac
tion of a job well done.
"I feel great," Sev exclaimed."And we were
able to raise money for charity."
