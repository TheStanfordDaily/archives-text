# STUDENT LIFE
## Interns confront tough job market Economic woes add stresses to applicants 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Applying to a summer internship
at a top management-consulting or
investment banking firm is like
applying to Stanford: there are
many qualified people for very few
spots. However, the competition has
not discouraged hundreds of
Stanford students from interviewing
for these coveted internships â€”
spending many hours revising their
resumes, practicing for the case
interviews and studying the Wall
Street Journal.
But as firms begin narrowing
their choices, some Stanford stu
dents worry that the weakened
economy has further decreased
their odds of being offered an
internship.
The mortgage crisis has had such
significant effects on some banking
firms that even their internship pro
grams have been affected. Earlier
this year, the investment-banking
arm of Citigroup, a major American
financial services company that
faced heavy losses after the mort
gage crisis, cancelled interviews at
Stanford after management placed
a hiring freeze on the company.
"All of the banks with the excep

tion of Goldman Sachs have laid off
full-time workers," said Randy Yang
'09, who is applying for a consulting
internship this year after working in
investment banking last summer.
Although recruiters have tried to
assure potential applicants that they
would maintain the number of sum
mer internships. Yang said he
expects investment banks to foresee
a market slow down and to react by
hiring less help.
The economic crunch and wide
spread layoffs at many prominent
investment banks may prove disad
vantageous even to those lucky
enough to receive a summer intern
ship, if they hope to translate their
summer work into full-time employ
ment. Paul Yun '09, a copy editor at
The Daily and a former investment
banking intern, said he expects that
firms will offer full-time positions to
a much smaller percentage of sum
mer interns.
"You're going to have to per
form at a much higher level to be
given a full-time position," Yun said.
Matt Kinskey '09. a public policy
major who applied to several lead
ing consulting firms, fears that the
dipping economy will affect the
number of consulting interns hired
this year. He worries that the sub
