# STUDENT LIFE
## Interns confront tough job market Economic woes add stresses to applicants 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Applying to a summer internship
at a top management-consulting or
investment banking firm is like
applying to Stanford: there are
many qualified people for very few
spots. However, the competition has
not discouraged hundreds of
Stanford students from interviewing
for these coveted internships —
spending many hours revising their
resumes, practicing for the case
interviews and studying the Wall
Street Journal.
But as firms begin narrowing
their choices, some Stanford stu
dents worry that the weakened
economy has further decreased
their odds of being offered an
internship.
The mortgage crisis has had such
significant effects on some banking
firms that even their internship pro
grams have been affected. Earlier
this year, the investment-banking
arm of Citigroup, a major American
financial services company that
faced heavy losses after the mort
gage crisis, cancelled interviews at
Stanford after management placed
a hiring freeze on the company.
"All of the banks with the excep

tion of Goldman Sachs have laid off
full-time workers," said Randy Yang
'09, who is applying for a consulting
internship this year after working in
investment banking last summer.
Although recruiters have tried to
assure potential applicants that they
would maintain the number of sum
mer internships. Yang said he
expects investment banks to foresee
a market slow down and to react by
hiring less help.
The economic crunch and wide
spread layoffs at many prominent
investment banks may prove disad
vantageous even to those lucky
enough to receive a summer intern
ship, if they hope to translate their
summer work into full-time employ
ment. Paul Yun '09, a copy editor at
The Daily and a former investment
banking intern, said he expects that
firms will offer full-time positions to
a much smaller percentage of sum
mer interns.
"You're going to have to per
form at a much higher level to be
given a full-time position," Yun said.
Matt Kinskey '09. a public policy
major who applied to several lead
ing consulting firms, fears that the
dipping economy will affect the
number of consulting interns hired
this year. He worries that the sub
prime mortgage crisis that signifi
cantly wounded the financial indus
try in the past year has weakened the
demand for management consulting.
" Ibere's a general sense that it was
going be tougher this year," said Dan
Steefel '09, who decided in early fall to
apply for summer internships at
investment banking and management
consulting firms.
Steefel said he knew both recruit
ing processes would be very competi
tive, especially consulting, which
recruits from a larger pool of appli
cants than investment banking.
"Consulting draws from a wider
range of majors because banking
relies more on the quantitative side."
he said.
The Stanford Career
Development Center will not have
information on the number of intern
ships offered by consulting or invest
ment banking firms until the begin
ning of spring quarter. However, sev
eral consulting firms have signaled
that the internship recruitment
process will remain consistent, even
during tougher economic times.
A consultant at Boston Consulting
Group (BCG) who recently recruited
at Stanford said that the firm was hir
ing no fewer interns this year than in
years past. Consulting firms took a lot

of backlash in the past when they
rescinded offers made, he said, and
they do not want to cut the ties that
they have at top universities. Bain

and Company has alsc
signaled via email .
that it will he "consis- 1
tent in [recruiting] j
approaches during i
the good times and
the bad." |
"We're offering H
as many or more \
internships than ever
before this year,"
said the consultant at
BCG. who ——

I)V WIIU
asked not to
be named so
that he could
speak candid-

ly. "Firms are
busy these days and are wary of over
reacting to a negative economic
downturn"
The BCG consultant said that the
candidates at Stanford tend to be the
most qualified and most prepared for
the interview process. Nevertheless,
the consultant said the application
process was still very competitive this
year and offers from BCG were only
extended to about six Stanford stu
dents of the approximately 80 that
applied.
Bev Principal, assistant director of
Employment Services at the CDC,
said that internship programs are very

EMILY VOGEL/The Stanford Daily
valuable to employees and are not
likely to be cut, even under severe
economic downturns. Undergraduate
internship programs allow employers
to prescreen future employees and to
create buzz on campus about a com
pany.
"An internship program is worth
its weight in gold when it works well
and gets good students to work for
you," Principal said.
