## GSC reviews graduate student living expenses 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At the Graduate Student Council (GSC) meeting last
night, much of the discussion centered on a graduate stu
dent survey conducted by GSC parliamentary Adam
Beberg.
Beberg explained the financial data he collected on
graduate students and highlighted that stipends granted
by the University do not cover the overall costs and living
expenses incurred by an average graduate student at
Stanford.
According to Beberg's presentation of the data, gradu
ate students' living costs exceed the amount of money
granted by the University.
"The quarterly stipend granted by the University to
graduate students is approximately or $2,192 a
month, so after taxes it's about $2,000." Beberg said.
Although the presentation did not provide detailed
information on how the survey was conducted, who the
students were that responded to it and how he selected
the survey's sample, Beberg said that the main idea of the
presentation was to demonstrate that monetary con
straints could prevent graduate students from focusing on
their research.
But Beberg also acknowledged that the survey needs
to be refined in order to provide more inclusive data. He
said that only 20 people provided him with their financial
information and added that the survey was sent to some
of his friends, random people and GSC members.
According to the results that Beberg's assessment
yielded, a quarter of the people surveyed are taking loans,
while others said they usually decide to work in order to
cover their expenses.
"We need something, we are falling behind because of
low increases |on the stipends]." he said. "Everyone who
responded said that they need help."
But Kristina Keating, co-chair of the GSC, said this
was not the case for her.
"I responded [to the survey| and 1 didn't say that,"
she said, adding that the GSC needs to provide visibility
of the financial aid office to make sure graduate stu
dents know where they should go and whom they should

talk to.
After the meeting adjourned,
Beberg told The Daily that the sur
vey was not statistically significant,
but that more data will be gath
ered.
When asked if he had a precon
ceived notion of the results before
conducting the survey, Beberg said
that this was not the case.
"The survey did not find any
thing different than all the past
data did, which is all it really need
ed to show," he said. "But we'll be
doing more data collection."
