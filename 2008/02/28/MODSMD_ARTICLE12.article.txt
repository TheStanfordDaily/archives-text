## Prof, pushes verifiable voting system 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
With the upcoming general presidential election
in November, the controversy surrounding elec
tronic voting machines has become a top national
priority, according to Computer Science Professor
David Dill.
Dill is the founder of VerifiedVoting.org, a non
profit organization that advocates for reliable and
publicly verifiable voting systems.
Partly as a result of the activism of organizations
like VerifiedVoting.org, there has been a wave of
state-wide legislation over the past few years
requiring that voter-verifiable paper ballots be
available to supplement electronic tabulations.
These ballots ensure a paper trail that can unequiv
ocally confirm election outcomes. Dill said that the
inability to reliably track and secure computerized
voting records has the potential to jeopardize the
validity of close wins and reduces public faith in the
electoral system.
"Transparency is a combination of two things:
one of those things is being able to watch things
happen, and the other is to be able to go back and
check," Dill said. "With electronic voting, from a
computer science perspective, there's no way to
inspect the externals or internals of the machine or
software and determine that it is accurate because
it is too complicated to do by the means."
California, one of 13 states requiring manual
election audits, has not been free of the electronic
voting controversy. California Secretary of State
Debra Bowen recently authorized a security
review of several electronic voting systems used in
the state.Hie investigation resulted in the decerti
fication of four separate vendors of voting equip
ment.
Although California requires electronic voting
machines to produce printed tabulations of the
votes registered in the machines. Dill said there
were severe problems with the equipment that
could have resulted in very serious consequences
for future elections.
"In every system it seemed that there was some
way to introduce a virus into the system during one
election that could completely take over the elec
tion system in the next election," Dill said. "The
person attacking the system just needed to have a
little alone time with the machines, which is easy
because a lot of these machines are just dropped
off at poll workers' houses."
The lack of oversight over electronic voting
equipment has had serious consequences in other
states, according to Dill. In Florida, which was the
focal point of the 2(MM) presidential election contro
versy, recent failures in electronic voting equip
ment may have contributed to an unresolved
wrongful election of a candidate.
"What you don't want is something like the 2006
election in Sarasota. Florida, where a lot of votes
just seem to be missing from the machine and it
determined the outcome of a Congressional race,"
Dill said. "I believe that the wrong person was
elected, and if you look at it statistically, that's the
way it works out, but a legal case could not be
made."
VerifiedVoting.org advocates for election trans
parency and verifiable voting by acting as an infor
mation resource to educate others. Dill said. The
organization points legislators to legislation passed
in other states as models for appropriate verifica
tion mechanisms and addresses claims regarding
the relative expense of paper ballots compared to
electronic voting.
"People will make incorrect claims about state,
and especially national, laws about electronic vot
ing," said Dill. "In one local state or community,
people could make some problem sound totally
insolvable, when in fact it's routinely solved in
other places. Once you know that and have that
perspective, it's easier to get something done."
In the 200N election. Dill plans to continue with
his advocacy by educating the public and legislators
and providing accurate information that can help
create reasonable solutions. Dill emphasized that
the intersection of politics with complex technical
challenges necessitates the involvement of techni
cal experts like computer scientists and engineers
in public policy debates.
