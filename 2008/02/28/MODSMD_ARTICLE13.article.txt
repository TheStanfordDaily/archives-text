## Fed. ready to cut interest rates again 
### JEANNINE AVERSA THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTONâ€” The Federal Reserve is
ready to lower interest rates again to brace the wob
bly economy even as zooming oil prices spread infla
tion, Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled to Congress
on Wednesday.
He is fighting to keep the economy afloat after
mighty blows from the housing and credit crises,
while trying to contain inflation.
For now, the priority is shoring up the economy,
Bernanke suggested in an appearance before the
House Financial Services Committee. He pledged
anew to slice a key interest rate and help the econo
my, which many fear is on the verge of a recession, if
not already in one.
"The economic situation has become distinctly
less favorable" since the summer, the Fed chief told
lawmakers.
Since then, the housing slump has worsened, cred
it problems have intensified and the job market has
deteriorated. Bernanke said that combination of bad
news has made people and businesses more cautious
about spending and investing, further weakening the
economy.
Ilie country should prepare for "sluggish econom

ic activity in the near term," Bernanke said. Concern
is growing about the possible return of stagflation,
when stagnant growth is combined with rising infla
tion. for the first time since the l l )70s.
Were energy prices to continue to rise at a sharp
clip - something the Fed does not anticipate - it
would "create a very difficult problem" for the econ
omy, Bernanke said. Inflation would spread and
growth would be further restrained, he said. If that
happened, it would be a "very tough situation," he
added.
The Fed is prepared to lower rates again to bolster
economic growth. Bernanke said. The Fed "will act in
a timely manner as needed to support growth and to
provide adequate insurance against downside risks,"
he said, sticking closely to assurances he offered ear
lier this month.
The central bank started lowering a key interest
rate in September. Over just eight days in January,
the Fed shaved 1.25 percentage points, the biggest
one-month reduction in a quarter-century.
Economists and Wall Street investors predict the Fed
will cut rates again at its next meeting. March 18.
Some analysts believe rates will drop again in April.
Brian Bethune, economist at Global Insight, said
Bernankes remarks "keeps the door wide open for
further rate cuts."
