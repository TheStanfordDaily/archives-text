## Editorial Board Petitioning the special fees process 
### 
This year's student groups are already
looking ahead to next year as they es
tablish budgets and search for fund
ing. Those student groups petitioning to be
on April's special fees ballot began the
process of acquiring student signatures last
week, and since then, have experienced a
setback.
Broken links preventing students from
viewing detailed budgets caused the Elec
tions Commission to temporarily shut down
the petitions Web site for reasons of consti
tutionality— technically, all students sign
ing a petition must have the opportunity to
read not only the dollar amount requested,
but also the detailed budget. Petitions signed
before links were fixed have been invalidat
ed, forcing the nine student groups affected
to completely restart their process of collect
ing signatures. In some cases, groups forfeit
ed over a quarter of the signatures needed.
To help atone for the mistake, the Elec
tions Commissar has committed to writing
emails to ask those students whose signa
tures were invalidated to re-sign. But affect
ed groups worry about a low return rate,
which may hurt their efforts to earn a spot
on the ballot. In any case, the ASSU's solu
tion of punting the consequences of its own
oversight onto students groups and the stu
dent body is troubling.
At the very least, the Elections Commis
sion should consider extending the Mar. 7
deadline to compensate for the lost signa
tures. The ostensible reasoning against such
an action is an effort to curtail the "spam"
that floods student in-boxes in the form of
petition requests. But once student groups
fulfill their signature quotas, they can stop
these online pleas. As a result, any extension
would see emails only from groups who have
not yet met their requirement, perhaps as
the result of the ASSU's mistake.
Also, the Election Commission and
ASSU Constitution's focus on the budget of
petitioning student groups is perplexing.
Even when the rare student actually does
take the time to peruse the proposed budg
ets, that student may not be able to really
learn anything from them. Breakdowns in
line items are meaningless to readers unfa
miliar with the typical costs of things like
honoraria, facility and event labor. ITirowing
out online signatures because some students
did not get the chance to look at budgets
they probably would have ignored — or

failed to understand upon reading — is a
shame for groups that now must accumulate
them again.
While this most recent controversy focus
es on budget links, the petitions Weh site in
explicably lacks another, more important
barometer. Besides the name, total budget
and contact information, the Web site does
not detail crucial information about the
group itself. Each petition page should dis
play the group's mission statement and a
brief summary of its budget proposals. In ef
fect. student groups should make pitches to
the student body for signatures. Currently,
some groups do justify their needs in the for
mal budgets, but text on the page itself
rather than mere links would force students
to consider the merits of the petition as op
posed to just signing off. This information
seems many times more important than ob
scure budget details, yet its absence does not
require the dumping of thousands of signa
tures.
Yet. the Editorial Board's concern about
the special fees process is unfortunately
more than just procedural. Some of the
process' broader issues are worth reviewing
as well. Most significantly, in the current
process, students also have no way of object
ing to just a portion of a student group's pro
posed budget or voting for a reduced budg
et. As a result, students caught supporting a
group, but not its entire proposed budget,
find themselves in a quandary. Though line
item by line item voting is impractical, the
ASSIJ should re-package some budgets to
allow students the option of voting for more
debatable budget proposals.
Additionally, student groups that reach
the ballot nearly always succeed in gaining
special fees. ITiis relative ease of passage
during the election heightens the impor
tance of the petition process. Therefore, stu
dents signing petitions now should consider
the consequences of their signatures longer
than just the mere seconds necessary tosign.
Active student groups are an essential
part of any campus, and it is no secret that ac
tive student groups require money. Petitions
occurring now and voting in April will deter
mine the distribution of a large amount of
money to student groups. With such sums of
money and the viability of several student
groups on the line. Stanford should have a
process that reflects its importance in both
policy and implementation.
