## What would you do?

Over winter break, I took a stupid risk.
After a late night with friends, I
locked the car and was walking up the
steps toward my front door when a man
called me from across the street.
"Excuse me." he said, "Can I ask you a
favor?" I turned around and looked at him.
ITie man was slight, and probably in his late
forties, with blond hair that was beginning to
turn white. 1 was apprehensive about getting
into a conversation with a random guy late at
night .This is how people get mugged, and be
sides, I really wanted to go inside and sleep.
Still, as I looked at him I thought, I'm big
ger than he is, he's kind of old and maybe he
actually needs help.
"What is it?" 1 asked.
"I'm really sorry," he responded hurried
ly,"but can you give me a ride? I would never
do this, but my father just had a heart attack,
and I need to get to the hospital. I was going
to walk but I just saw you get out of your car
and had to ask." The man told me he lived
about two blocks away, citing his exact ad
dress. He said that his teenage son was out
late with his car,couldn't be reached and that
he needed to get to Rose Medical Center im
mediately.
He wasn't wearing a heavy coat, which
seemed weird considering his plan to walk —
the hospital is about 25 blocks away and it
was below freezing. But this also made him
look less threatening — at the very least I
could tell he wasn't carrying any weapons.
"Ok," 1 responded, "let's go." I felt un
comfortable, but I wanted to help, and be
sides, if I blew him off, he knew where I lived.
The man looked relieved, stunned and
sheepish all at once, and we awkwardly got
into my car, an old. beaten-up Ford Explorer.
After some uneasy silence, he again gushed
his appreciation, and promised to drop ten
bucks in my mailbox the next morning for my
trouble. I assured him he didn't need to.
On the way, I asked about his father's con
dition. He said he wasn't sure, because they
wouldn't tell him over the phone. Colorado
does have strict rules about medical privacy.

so this was plausible. But are they really not
allowed to tell family members?
As we neared the hospital, he suddenly
said,"Wait a second, my grandmother lives in
these apartments, right here, and she turns
off her phone at night." He was speaking so
quickly his sentences seemed to overlap.
"She'd want to know about my dad. so I bet
ter get out here, and tell her. and I'll walk the
rest of the way."
It appeared I'd been had.
I felt resentful and stupid as I pulled into
the apartment complex. I started to worry he
was going to try to steal my car, but instead he
just got out awkwardly, thanked me again
and left. He was probably just a guy who
needed a ride, and he used the hospital story
to guilt me into it. I wondered why he didn't
have any friends he could call for a ride, or
money for a taxi.
Sometimes, deciding to give someone a
hand doesn't require any thought. A few days
ago I was filling my bike tires at the air hose
next to Tresidder, and the girl ahead of me
couldn't unscrew her tire valves. She embar
rassedly asked for help, we exchanged a bit of
awkward small talk, not even trading names,
and then she finished and rode away.
I think it is a natural instinct to want to
help. But there's a fine line between being a
good Samaritan, and putting yourself at un
necessary risk. I'm still not sure which cate
gory the winter break incident falls under.
Would I have driven him without the heart
attack line? I'm just not sure. What would
you have done?
