## Next steps for equal access to education 
### 
Last week. Stanford announced that it
would no longer charge tuition to stu
dents with family incomes below
$100,000 a year, taking a major step toward
equal access to education. The price tag of a
Stanford degree has long been a barrier for
low and middle-income families. By giving
such families a clear, bold and simple policy
statement instead of a mess of financial aid
forms, Stanford has made it more plausible to
apply and possible to attend.
This is great news, but it is frustrating to al
ways feel two years behind Harvard. If we
want to take the lead on educational equali
ty, we have to make it a core part of our mis
sion. Here are some ideas:
Free enrichment programs for incom
ing students
Applicants come from unequal back
grounds. Some didn't have SAT-prep classes,
their schools didn't offer AP and they had
jobs or had to help take care of younger sib

lings to help their families make ends meet.
Even though they didn't have the advantages
other applicants had, they may have the same
underlying ability. In other words, these ap
plicants may be just as able to succeed at
Stanford, even though their scores don't
show it. Fundamentally, this is the premise of
affirmative action.
But if you take that premise seriously, ro
bust affirmative action programs must be
coupled with efforts to close the preparation
gap. It doesn't make sense to acknowledge
that some students have less preparation
when we make admissions decisions and
then begin instruction assuming that every

student is on the same footing. We need to
admit new people and prepare them to suc
ceed.
One option would be a spring, summer
and/or fall program available to any incom
ing student providing some of the basic
things a high-achieving high school would â€”
AP math, intensive writing workshops, U.S.
and world history, and so on. It would hardly
stretch Stanford's capacity to offer this pro
gram to any admitted student who wanted it,
and it would be very effective in leveling the
playing field among incoming students.
A comprehensive approach to
diversity
Right now "diversity" is often a code word
for "people of different colors." That's great,
and it's a very important component of diver
sity, but it's not the whole story. Poor or rich,
male or female, urban or rural, one or two
