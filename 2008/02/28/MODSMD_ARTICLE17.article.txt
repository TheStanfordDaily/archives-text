## Next steps for equal access to education 
### 
Last week. Stanford announced that it
would no longer charge tuition to stu
dents with family incomes below
$100,000 a year, taking a major step toward
equal access to education. The price tag of a
Stanford degree has long been a barrier for
low and middle-income families. By giving
such families a clear, bold and simple policy
statement instead of a mess of financial aid
forms, Stanford has made it more plausible to
apply and possible to attend.
This is great news, but it is frustrating to al
ways feel two years behind Harvard. If we
want to take the lead on educational equali
ty, we have to make it a core part of our mis
sion. Here are some ideas:
Free enrichment programs for incom
ing students
Applicants come from unequal back
grounds. Some didn't have SAT-prep classes,
their schools didn't offer AP and they had
jobs or had to help take care of younger sib

lings to help their families make ends meet.
Even though they didn't have the advantages
other applicants had, they may have the same
underlying ability. In other words, these ap
plicants may be just as able to succeed at
Stanford, even though their scores don't
show it. Fundamentally, this is the premise of
affirmative action.
But if you take that premise seriously, ro
bust affirmative action programs must be
coupled with efforts to close the preparation
gap. It doesn't make sense to acknowledge
that some students have less preparation
when we make admissions decisions and
then begin instruction assuming that every

student is on the same footing. We need to
admit new people and prepare them to suc
ceed.
One option would be a spring, summer
and/or fall program available to any incom
ing student providing some of the basic
things a high-achieving high school would —
AP math, intensive writing workshops, U.S.
and world history, and so on. It would hardly
stretch Stanford's capacity to offer this pro
gram to any admitted student who wanted it,
and it would be very effective in leveling the
playing field among incoming students.
A comprehensive approach to
diversity
Right now "diversity" is often a code word
for "people of different colors." That's great,
and it's a very important component of diver
sity, but it's not the whole story. Poor or rich,
male or female, urban or rural, one or two



Kai
Stinchcombe
parents, white or blue collar family
— all of these have a critical impact
on how a child will score on stan
dard admissions measures, and just
as we don't want an all-white
Stanford, we don't want an all-sub
urban Stanford either, because it
would limit students' horizons. The
administration gets it — for exam
ple, Vice Provost Patricia Gumport
stated the value of multiple types of
diversity explicitly in yesterday's
Daily — but too often the numbers
and goals reflect only racial diversi
ty, and the money and focus follows
the numbers. We need to match our
programs and measurement tools to
our rhetoric.
Diversity in other areas of
academic life
We learn more from our peers
than from our professors, so a
diverse student body enriches the
experience of each student. That's
what we say. But Stanford's commit
ment to a diverse student experience
too often ends at the doorway. If we
wanted to increase the benefit each
student receives from the diversity
of the Stanford student body, we
need to find ways to pull different
people together. We can't force peo
ple to interact, but we can provide
enough pull to balance the natural
tendency of people to seek friends

similar to themselves.
What if each ASSU-funded stu
dent group had to submit a "diversi
ty plan" explaining how they were
going to involve people of different
backgrounds in their activities?
What if draw groups got a small
diversity bonus for bringing unlike
people together? What if academic
departments set diversity goals for
their major, or for their big intro
classes, and then thought about how
to meet them?
More diverse role models and
mentors
Much has been said about the
role of a diverse faculty in attracting
a diverse student body. The bottom
line, however, is that the Ph.D.
pipeline is one of the most un
diverse status groups in America.
Stanford has actually seen a signifi
cant decline in graduate representa
tion of black and Native American
students over the last two decades.
Why not set up a visiting leaders
program whose major purpose is to
enhance the undergraduate experi
ence — California's politicians,busi
ness leaders and media personalities
are a quite diverse group of people,
light years ahead of our faculty. We
could set up a public leadership sem
inar and a personalized advising
program where interested students
could meet with a diverse group of
people from the outside world.
