## A 						call for conservation 
### 
I don't think I've ever been as embarrassed
by and for my peers as I was yesterday
morning, when I woke up and stumbled
blearily into the shower to see an unfamiliar
device gleaming at me. The reward of our en
vironmental struggle, the shining prize for
which we overcame apathy and brought the
imperturbable administration to heel had
been replaced by the new, new handheld
showerheads.
This is what we're reduced to? Every year.

well-meaning student groups toil away for
good causes on campus — labor rights,
sweat-free gear, gender-blind housing, you
name it — and accomplish nothing except
the vaguest promises and meaningless com
mitments from Stanford.The student body as
a whole is perhaps vaguely supportive of
their goals, but wholly unwilling to demon
strate that support in any useful way.
But God help you, John Hennessy, when
you touch our showers. If anything is sacro

sanct, after all. it is our demand for maximal
luxury. The showerheads installed over win
ter break in every dorm may have used half
as much water as their predecessors, but they
are, God help us, slightly less comfortable to
use.
We're sucking the American West dry.The
Sierra snowpack — that thing you ski on
every January and is the basic source of our
water — has been shrinking in recent
years to all-time lows. Ihe Colorado
River, the mighty river that carved
the Grand Canyon into the Arizona
desert, no longer reliably reaches the
sea. This part of the world is just not
equipped to support so many people
living so inefficiently.
Demanding inefficient shower
heads for an incremental increase in

comfort is. quite literally, killing
America. We wash ourselves in the
lifeblood of the land. Out, out, damn
spot.
We're a student body of Paris
Hiltons. Spoiled rotten, we've some
how gotten it into our heads that
whatever sacrifices should be made
to maintain the extraordinary
lifestyles we enjoy, we're surely not
the ones to make them.
It's true that Stanford administra
tors sneaked the efficient shower
heads into our bathrooms on the sly,
which is not a great way to operate.
But. oddly. I find myself taking their

side in this case. After all, if we had a
functional student democracy it now
looks like student opinion wouldn't
have endorsed the new showerheads.
Maybe, though, if activists for sus
tainability had had a chance to make
the case for the showerheads in a
public discussion, they'd have per
suaded some people, and we would
n't have faced the backlash that
made the University back down.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter how
much students dislike the efficient
showerheads. It's like excusing driv
ing a Hummer by saying, "It's roomi
er. and I like being up above the traf

fic." Those are, in themselves, fine
sentiments, but they are nowhere
near worth the tradeoffs associated
with driving a Hummer. It takes you
an extra minute or two to wash your
hair? Stay in the shower for an extra
minute or two. And so long as you're
washed and good to go in under 200
percent of the time it took with the
inefficient showerheads, you should
n't whine about it. You'll certainly
survive. Too bad we can't say the
same about our environment.
