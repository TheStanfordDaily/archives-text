# HUSKIES LURKING
## No. 8 Stanford GOES FOR SWEEP OF Washington 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford basketball enjoys its last week
end at home and the lowest-profile game
left on its regular season schedule when
struggling Washington visits tonight.

Washington (15-13, 6-9 Pac-10) lost to
No. 8 Stanford (22-4.11-3). 65-51, in Seattle
four weeks ago. and has dropped six of its
last nine to fall out of contention for a bid in
the NCAA Tournament. Only woeful Ore
gon State (6-21, 0-15) has a worse confer
ence mark than the Huskies.

But just three games separate ninth
place Washington from their in-state rivals,
third-place No. 22 Washington State (21-6,
9-6) in the Pac-10—a conference whose
players, coaches and media are quick to call
the nation's best (the RPI ranks it third to
the ACC and Big XII. however). And what
the league may lack at the top (with just two
top-20 teams), it certainly makes up for in
depth: its top nine squads each have 15 wins
and NBA talent sprinkled across the rosters.

For Washington, senior guard Tim Mor
ris. a Stanford transfer, might make for the
most compelling storyline, but it's junior
forward Jon Brockman (18 points. 12
rebounds per game, 54 percent
shooting) who promises Stanford
sophomore centers Brook and
Robin Lopez a battle down low
and guards Ryan Appleby (11
points) Justin Dentmon (10
points) who will try to
out-quick their Stan
ford counterparts by
driving to the hoop.

"Explosive
quick, playing bet
ter, defending
better," coach
Trent Johnson
said Tuesday of the
Huskies."Any time a
team can beat UC LA, that says enough

So then why is Stanford a strong fa
vorite to beat Washington for the 15th
straight time at Maples Pavilion? Like
fellow Pac-1() would-bes Oregon and
Cal, the Huskies treat defense like it's
recess. The 69.3 points and 45 percent
shooting allowed are among the con
ference's worst, and an abysmal 59
percent accuracy rate from the free
throw line doesn't help matters either, i

Huskies 65-51 in Seattle. Heading into this game,
Washington has lost six of nine games, despite beat
ing No. 4 UCLA along that stretch. Tonight should
be a battle of the big men, as forward Jon Brock
man, Washington's best player, will face off against
the Lopez twins.
