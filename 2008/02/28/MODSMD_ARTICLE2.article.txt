# HUSKIES LURKING
## No. 8 Stanford GOES FOR SWEEP OF Washington 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford basketball enjoys its last week
end at home and the lowest-profile game
left on its regular season schedule when
struggling Washington visits tonight.

Washington (15-13, 6-9 Pac-10) lost to
No. 8 Stanford (22-4.11-3). 65-51, in Seattle
four weeks ago. and has dropped six of its
last nine to fall out of contention for a bid in
the NCAA Tournament. Only woeful Ore
gon State (6-21, 0-15) has a worse confer
ence mark than the Huskies.

But just three games separate ninth
place Washington from their in-state rivals,
third-place No. 22 Washington State (21-6,
9-6) in the Pac-10—a conference whose
players, coaches and media are quick to call
the nation's best (the RPI ranks it third to
the ACC and Big XII. however). And what
the league may lack at the top (with just two
top-20 teams), it certainly makes up for in
depth: its top nine squads each have 15 wins
and NBA talent sprinkled across the rosters.

For Washington, senior guard Tim Mor
ris. a Stanford transfer, might make for the
most compelling storyline, but it's junior
forward Jon Brockman (18 points. 12
rebounds per game, 54 percent
shooting) who promises Stanford
sophomore centers Brook and
Robin Lopez a battle down low
and guards Ryan Appleby (11
points) Justin Dentmon (10
points) who will try to
out-quick their Stan
ford counterparts by
driving to the hoop.

"Explosive
quick, playing bet
ter, defending
better," coach
Trent Johnson
said Tuesday of the
Huskies."Any time a
team can beat UC LA, that says enough

So then why is Stanford a strong fa
vorite to beat Washington for the 15th
straight time at Maples Pavilion? Like
fellow Pac-1() would-bes Oregon and
Cal, the Huskies treat defense like it's
recess. The 69.3 points and 45 percent
shooting allowed are among the con
ference's worst, and an abysmal 59
percent accuracy rate from the free
throw line doesn't help matters either, i

NOTES: In their first meeting, the Cardinal beat the
Huskies 65-51 in Seattle. Heading into this game,
Washington has lost six of nine games, despite beat
ing No. 4 UCLA along that stretch. Tonight should
be a battle of the big men, as forward Jon Brock
man, Washington's best player, will face off against
the Lopez twins.

conference's top three in scoring de
fense (58.3 points), field-goal per
centage allowed (38.3 percent),
three-point percentage allowed (32.2
percent), and rebounding margin
(+10.0). It has launched the Cardinal
to a top-ten ranking, second place in
the league, just one game behind
UCLA, and a probable top-four seed
come the NCAA Tournament.
"Some guys will check Bracketol
ogy or whatever they're saying," sen
ior forward Taj Finger said of his
teammates. "But we're more fo
cused on the Pac-10 championship,
more focused on the games coming
up."
After tonight's 7 p.m. tip, Wash
ington State will visit Maples Pavil
ion on Saturday at 1 p.m. The Cardi
nal has won two of its last three
against the Cougars, who started the
season 14-0, then dropped five of
eight, but have won four of their last
five.
I lowever, both Stanford victories

came in overtime, 67-65 in Pullman,
Wash, this year, and 71-68 at Maples
last year, with the Cougars' defense,
regularly the conference's best, giv
ing Stanford a 45-minute headache.
Stanford's last win in regulation? 39-
37 in Pullman two seasons ago, in a
game every hit a.-> ugly as it sounds.
Saturday's contest will he Senior
Day, the last home game for Finger,
center Peter Prowitt, forward Fred
Washington and guard Kenny
Brown. It will also be the last oppor
tunity for Stanford to catch its
breath, with the Pac-10 title poten
tially being decided in L.A. next
weekend, and the Pac-10 Tourna
ment and NCAA Tournament com
ing up in the following weeks.
None of that matters right now to
Finger, though. Me doesn't want to
be looking past Washington tonight,
let alone Washington State.
"I'll just be thinking about beat
ing WSIJ Saturday." Finger said."[lf]
you get caught up in all that stuff,
you're not going to play as well."
One game at a time. Given the re
sults this season, it's hard to argue.
