## Mayor Bloomberg not running for president 
### SARA KUGLER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK â€” After two years of playing
coy about his presidential ambitions. Mayor
Michael Bloomberg declared in a newspaper
editorial Wednesday that he will not run for
president but might support the candidate who
"takes an independent, nonpartisan approach."
The 66-year-old billionaire businessman, who
aides had said was prepared to spend $1 billion
to run as an independent, wrote in an editorial
on The New York Times' Web site that he will
work to "steer the national conversation away
from partisanship and toward unity: away from

ideology and toward common sense; away from
sound bites and toward substance."
Bloomberg, who has almost two years left in
his second term at City Hall, had publicly
denied any interest in running for president
since one of his political advisers first planted
the seed more than two years ago.
But his denials grew weaker in recent
months as aides and supporters quietly began
laying the groundwork for a third-party cam
paign.
"1 listened carefully to those who encour
aged me to run, but I am not - and will not be -
a candidate for president," he wrote.
Among his biggest obstacles was getting on

the ballot. The process varies wildly from state
to state and would have required Bloomberg to
collect hundreds of thousands of signatures
according to a strict timetable on which the first
key date is March 5.
Beginning next Wednesday, a Bloomberg
campaign would have had to begin gathering
signatures to get on the ballot in Texas, which
has one of the earliest deadlines.
Bloomberg underwent extensive preparation
for a presidential bid. The work included mass
polling and nationwide data collection to deter
mine his viability as a candidate, as well as
detailed study and preparation for a state-by
state ballot access drive.
