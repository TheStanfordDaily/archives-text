## Against competitive field, women finish ninth 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal made a hard push in the final round, but it proved
too little too late. Despite shooting +16 as a team yesterday — good
for sixth on the day — the No. 24 women's golf team could not over
come earlier setbacks and a tough field at the Arizona Wildcat Invi
tational in Ilicson, finishing in a tie for ninth place with No. 7 Auburn.

"I feel the team performed well this week. We got off to a rough
start, but we had a great finishing day," said junior Mari Chun.

shot +19 for the tourna

was fierce — of the 16
schools partaking in the
tournament, six were
ranked in top-10. including
the top four teams in the
country. As a result, despite
its respectable score, Stan

in 11th place.
Chun was the day one
leader for the Cardinal: she
finished at a remarkable -2
on the day, good for second
place in the individual
standings. Miller and sopho
more Angela King both shot
+6, while the final two Stan
ford participants, freshman
Rebecca Durham and jun
ior Ki-Shui Liao, scored +9
and +11 respectively.

estingly enough, the team moved up a slot to stand in tenth place. It
was an off day for all the top schools involved, as all of the teams in
the top-10 finished with lower scores than on the first day. However,
Stanford was not able to capitalize fully on the opportunity.
Both Chun and Miller said that weather and its subsequent effect
on the course contributed to the higher second day score.

nament "said Miller.
Still, the team had some strong
performances: Durham led the Car
dinal at four-over-par on the day, and
Chun shot six-over — although a
solid score, she fell from second to
sixth in the individual rankings.
By the end of the second day, it
became evident that Stanford had
little chance of finishing in the top
five — No. 3 Arizona State, who
stood in fifth after the second round,
was still 14 shots up on the Cardinal.
However, Stanford still had a shot at
finishing in the top-10, despite being
one of the lowest ranked teams in
the field.
On Wednesday, that's exactly
what they did.
I"he women's + 16 team finish was
their best of the tournament, bested
only by the likes of No. 15 Oklahoma
State, the Invitational's eventual
winner; No. 4 USC and No. 2 Duke,
who tied for second; the Sun Devils,
who led the tournament after day
one; and UCLA, the No. 1 team in
the country.
Hie Cowgirls won by two shots,
despite a fierce challenge from the
Blue Devils — who shot a round
low +6 — and the TVojans. The rest

of the field was distant from the top
three schools: Arizona, the fourth
place finisher, ended 13 shots behind
Duke and USC.
Chun and Durham led the Cardi
nal at two-over-par, but the rest of
the team wasn't far behind: Miller
shot +5, and King and Liao both fin
ished the round at +7 on the day.
Durham's overall +14 score for
the tournament was the lowest score
of her career.
Chun finished in fourth place in
the individual standings, at +6 over
all. She finished six shots behind the
leader, Amanda Blumenherst of
Duke.
Chun's finish was her best of the
season, and her third top-10 finish of
the year.
"1 felt like our team did a great
job persevering each day," said
Miller. "We all still kept trying to
play our best and make shots hap
pen, no matter how frustrating it was
at times."
Stanford will not compete for an
other month and a half, which leaves
extra time for practice.
"I am looking forward to fine tun
ing my game, so 1 can contribute
more to the team," said Chun.
The Cardinal will return to the
desert on April 4 for its next tourna
ment, the Arizona State Invitational.
