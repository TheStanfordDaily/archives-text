## Training, healing the Card 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For most of us. watching sports at
Stanford is a simple affair in which
we can lose ourselves in the wins and
losses of the moment and the thrill of
the competition taking place before
our eyes. It's no secret that our uni
versity boasts some of the top athlet
ic teams in the nation — 13 straight
Directors' Cup wins can attest to that
— and the sheer number of teams
that contribute to those titles is a
good reason why there is nearly al
ways some athletic event on campus

offering spectators a view of one of
the finest all-around programs in the
country.
But there is another side to the
Stanford sports scene that often goes
unnoticed. For every Cardinal squad,
there is a trainer assigned to make
sure that student athletes are not
only competing to the best of their
abilities, but are also receiving the
necessary treatment for the injuries
that afflict members of a team over
the course of a season. It is their job
to not only help the Cardinal athletes
heal, but also to make sure that they
do not hurt themselves more serious

ly or even permanently.
Perry Archibald has seen a lot in
his 22 years as an athletic trainer for
Stanford, having worked with almost
every sport at one point or another.
I le is currently assigned to the Cardi
nal soccer and wrestling teams, and
knows firsthand the complications
which come from a job description
that often calls for him to tell athletes
to ease up. when their entire lives of
competition have conditioned them
to push on.
"I have to approach things a little
differently depending on the ath
lete," Archibald said. "With some
guys you can he a bit more direct and
they will accept it [when they're
hurt], and with other guys you have
to be a little bit more convincing and
you may even have to use the aid of
the coach and the physician to in
crease the weight of what you're say
ing. Sometimes they're not even
going to believe you — sometimes
people need more than one person
to tell them."
His duties as the wrestling team's
trainer, in particular, have offered
him a different set of difficulties. As
anyone who's attended a collegiate
wrestling match can attest, the sport
is often a testament to an athlete's
ability to endure pain, as joints and
limbs are slowly twisted in ways they
were not designed to twist. Often,
coaches and trainers are left only to
plead with an official to stop the ac
tion as a hold becomes dangerous.
"It's hard for me to watch be
cause 1 know if something does hap
pen I'm going to be on the receiving
end, trying to take care of whatever
results from it," Archibald said."The
one sport that I did do through high
school and into college was
wrestling, so I did participate in that
even if I wasn't any good at it, I feel
as though I know something about
the sport, and 1 understand about
different kinds of holds that people
get put in.
"[There are] legal, control holds
in wrestling and then there are
things which are illegal, and we try
and stop the official when a hold

which is legal looks like it might be
come illegal."
As Archibald explained, the fact
that his work occurs outside of the
spotlight does not really bother him,
even given the obvious importance
and duty in keeping athletes healthy
and safe in their competitions.
"I really enjoy my job, 1 really
enjoy working here,"he said. "This is
a job, you do it for love, you don't do
it for money. I don't do it for prestige
anymore — I've been a trainer at
higher levels than here, 1 was a train
er with the San Francisco Giants at
one time — and I do enjoy working
with the kids and the coaches. When
1 was younger, 1 kind of had that
thought that, you know,'l want to be
the best trainer and 1 want every
body to know,' that kind of stuff, but
not anymore.
"All 1 care about is just taking
care of the athletes."
And as long as there are people
watching and competing in sports,
there will always need to be trainers
keeping the action going.
