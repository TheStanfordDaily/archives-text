## Training, healing the Card 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For most of us. watching sports at
Stanford is a simple affair in which
we can lose ourselves in the wins and
losses of the moment and the thrill of
the competition taking place before
our eyes. It's no secret that our uni
versity boasts some of the top athlet
ic teams in the nation — 13 straight
Directors' Cup wins can attest to that
— and the sheer number of teams
that contribute to those titles is a
good reason why there is nearly al
ways some athletic event on campus

offering spectators a view of one of
the finest all-around programs in the
country.
But there is another side to the
Stanford sports scene that often goes
unnoticed. For every Cardinal squad,
there is a trainer assigned to make
sure that student athletes are not
only competing to the best of their
abilities, but are also receiving the
necessary treatment for the injuries
that afflict members of a team over
the course of a season. It is their job
to not only help the Cardinal athletes
heal, but also to make sure that they
do not hurt themselves more serious

ly or even permanently.
Perry Archibald has seen a lot in
his 22 years as an athletic trainer for
Stanford, having worked with almost
every sport at one point or another.
I le is currently assigned to the Cardi
nal soccer and wrestling teams, and
knows firsthand the complications
which come from a job description
that often calls for him to tell athletes
to ease up. when their entire lives of
competition have conditioned them
to push on.
