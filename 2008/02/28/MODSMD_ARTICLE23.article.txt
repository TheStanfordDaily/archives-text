### JIMMY GOLEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Leßron James returned from a
first-half ankle injury to score 26
and become the youngest player
in NBA history to reach the
10,000-point milestone, hut the
Boston Celtics got 22 points from
Ray Allen to beat the Cleveland
Cavaliers 92-S7 on Wednesday
night.
Kevin Garnett scored 18 with
11 rebounds for Boston to help
the NBA's top team win its third
straight and improve to 2-2 for the
season against the defending
Eastern Conference champions.
.liimes sprained his ankle and
missed the last 4:24 of the first
half, but X-rays were negative and
he was back for the start of the
second. Cavs coach Mike Brown
took a longer break: I le was eject-

Ed with 42 seconds left in the third
quarter after he had to be re
strained by his assistants while ar
guing a foul call against James.
But neither James' perform
ance on the court or Brown's out
burst could help Cleveland close
what was a double-digit deficit
most of the game. After hitting the
first two baskets of the fourth
quarter to make it 75-66, the Cavs
never got closer than 10 points
until the final minute.
Delonte West's meaningless 3-
pointer at the buzzer counted be
cause of goaltending, making it
appear closer than it was.
James was hurt after driving
for a layup, either twisting some
thing on his way to the basket or
when he landed. He hobbled off
toward the Cavaliers bench and
then dropped onto the court in
front of the scorer's table with

4:24 left in the first half.
Brown and the training staff
rushed over to attend to James,
while the crowd hushed and the
players on both benches looked
over to see what was happening.
After being looked at on the floor
for a few minutes, he limped off to
the locker room, favoring his right
leg, getting a cheer from the
Boston fans.
James reached the 10,000-
point milestone at 23 years and 59
days. It took him 368 games to do
it — the ninth-fastest in league
history.
James reached the 10.000-
point milestone at 23 years and 59
days, more than a year younger
than Kobe Bryant was when he hit
the milestone in 2003 (24 years,
193 days). It took James 368
games to do it — the ninth-fastest
in league history.
