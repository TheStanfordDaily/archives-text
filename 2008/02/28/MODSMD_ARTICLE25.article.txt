Former Indiana coach Kelvin
Sampson's separation agreement
with the university will not be final
ized until March 17.
Sampson signed the deal Friday,
and university spokesman Larry
Maclntyre said Monday the
Hoosiers ex-coach waived his right
to a 21-day revocation period when
he signed the deal, which includes
provisions which prevent Sampson
from suing the university
Ihe agreement, which was ob
tained through a Freedom of Infor
mation request, also requires
Sampson to continue cooperating
with the NCAA investigation and
bars him from interfering with any
team activities.
"Sampson shall not interfere in
any way with the activities of the
men's basketball team and shall not
discourage the current members
from cooperating with the transition
to a new head coach, from remaining
active members of the team, and
from playing to their full potential in
all competition events," the agree
ment states.
Sampson took a $75().(XX) buyout
Friday in return for his immediate
resignation after the NCAA accused
him of five major rules violations.
The universitv also included a

clause saying that the deal does not,
in any way indicate Sampson be
lieved he had any legitimate legal
claims against the school.
Indiana has until May 8 to re
spond to the NCAA charges and is
scheduled to appear before the in
fractions committee June 14 in Seat
tle. A decision is expected within 30
days of the hearing, where Sampson
has said he looks forward to defend
ing himself.The university could also
ask the infractions committee to
move the hearing up to April al
though there is no guarantee the re
quest would be granted.
Sampson took the Indiana job in
March 2(X)6 and two months later
was penalized by the NCAA for
making 577 impermissible phone
calls between 2(XX) and 2(XH when he
was coaching Oklahoma.
The second wave of charges
emerged in October when a univer
sity investigation found Sampson
and his staff made more than I (X) im
permissible calls while still under re
cruiting restrictions and that Samp
son participated in at least 10 three
way calls, another violation of the
NCAA's punishment.
Athletic director Rick
Greenspan called the violations
secondary, imposing a one-year
extension of the NCAA's recruit
ing restrictions and pulling a
$500,000 raise.
