## Clinton links her fate to economy 
### MIKE GLOVER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ZANESVILLE, Ohio — Hillary Rodham
Qinton spent almost three hours Wednesday
trying to persuade a college gym full of
Ohioans that her detailed plans to revive the
failing economy can also resuscitate her dwin
dling campaign for the Democratic presiden
tial nomination.
"Obviously, the economy is the No. 1 issue
in the country, and it's unbelievably important
here in Ohio," said Clinton. "1 think, absent
any intervening circumstances, the economy
will be the domestic driver with all the related
issues like health care and energy costs and
home foreclosures."
Ihe former first lady said voters in key
swing states are beginning to focus on "the big
questions," such as bedrock economic issues,
that she said will drive both the remaining De
mocratic nomination contests and the fall gen
eral election.
"What's important is we have a lot of peo
ple yet to vote." said Qinton. "We've got four
states coming up on Tuesday, we've got 16 con
tests after that."
Trailing her rival Barack Obama in popu
lar vote, committed delegates and fundrais
ing, Clinton emphasized the struggling indus
trial economy throughout the upper Midwest
as she swung through Ohio less than a week
before its crucial primary. She is counting on
her performance in the March 4 contests in
Ohio and Texas to keep her candidacy afloat.
In this southeastern Ohio city that's been
hammered by plant closings, she held a near
ly three-hour round-table on economic issues
in the gymnasium of Ohio University-
Zanesville and Zane State College. In addi
tion to political heavyweights like Ohio Gov.
Ted Strickland. New Jersey Gov. Jon C'orzine
and former Sen. John Glenn who all have en
dorsed her. Clinton also heard tales of eco
nomic stress from workers in excruciating de
tail that reinforced her reputation as a policy
wonk.

Robert Landry, of Dayton, told Clinton
about how his home was foreclosed on Christ
mas Eve and the emotional struggle he faced.
"You feel alone and the bottom drops out
of your whole life." said Landry. "The bottom
line is you don't know what to do and you're
lost."
That underscored a core message of her
campaign.
"What are we going to do to improve the
lives of hardworking Americans." said Clin
ton. "That is my mission. I see a middle-class
comeback. 1 see it starting in places like
Zanesville."
She heard Florine Mark of Weight Watch
ers tell stories about obese children struggling

with self-image, Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher talk
about state economic development and Chris
tine Pambianchi of Corning Inc. talk about
change.
Clinton praised Corning for moving into
new product lines like fiber optics. "They used
to make glass," she said. "If they were still
about glass they wouldn't be around."
Diving into the deep details of a struggling
economy was aimed at reinforcing her argu
ment that she's ready to tackle the big prob
lems facing the nation, compared to Obama
whom she labels as inexperienced.
"What I intend to do is draw attention, not
only to the problem side but the solution side."
said Clinton. As the campaign moves to the in

dustrial Midwest, voters are responding, she
said.
"What I feel is happening is people are
starting toward the hig questions they should
have to answer, who can be the best com
mander in chief, who do you want in the White
House answering the phone at 3 a.m.," said
Clinton. "1 feel good about these upcoming
states. What keeps me optimistic is the success
I've had so far and what 1 think the prospects
are for Tuesday."
She emphasized the value of patience and
experience.
"Change does take consistent, concerted
effort " said Clinton. "The people of Ohio are
ready. We just need to stay with you."
