## John McCain retools stance on immigration 
### JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — John McCain faces
a dilemma on immigration as he works to
persuade conservatives he's tough enough
on the issue without erasing his historic ap
peal to Hispanic voters. Once a crusader
for offering the nation's roughly 12 million
undocumented immigrants a way to get
legal status. McCain now says his first pri
ority is fortifying U.S. borders.
The metamorphosis reflects McCain's
intensifying effort to consolidate his sup
port among conservatives, who deride the

Arizona senator's past proposals on immi
gration as offering amnesty to lawbreakers,
and bitterly resent his work with Democ
rats. including Sen.Ted Kennedy of Massa
chusetts, on the issue.
Coming off a primary season where his
immigration stance was seen as a major lia
bility and GOP opponents hammered him
for having an overly permissive approach.
McCain is remaking his image with an eye
toward the general election.
If he goes too far in the other direction,
though, he could alienate the I lispanic vot
ers who he's counting on to siphon support
from a Democratic rival in states like Ari

zona. Colorado. Nevada. New Mexico, and
to be competitive in California.
"He's focusing on enforcement, and in
this community, enforcement means de
portation. and that means separating more
families, and more racial profiling and
more of the incredible hardship that is af
fecting not just immigrants, but native-born
Latinos," said Cecilia Munoz of the Nation
al Council of La Raza.
McCain infuriated the Republican base
when he teamed with GOP moderates like
Sen. Arlen Specter. R-Pa. and Democrats
led by Kennedy in 2006 to push legislation
- with strong backing from President Bush

- that would have given illegal immigrants a
path to citizenship.That measure died after
the House, then dominated by conserva
tives. passed a bill that dealt only with bor
der security and refused to consider provi
sions to address undocumented workers
who are already in the United States.
The bipartisan group tried again last
year - but this time, McCain kept his dis
tance from the negotiations as he cam
paigned for president. He rarely showed
up for the marathon round of meetings
where the plan was shaped and seldom
spoke publicly on the effort until a deal
had been cut.
