## Obama fights false links to Islam 
### JIM KUHNHENN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€” For Barack
Ohama, it is an ember that he has doused
time and again, only to see it flicker anew:
links to Islam fanned by false rumors, innu
endo and association. Obama and his cam
paign reacted strongly this week when a
photo of him in Kenyan tribal garb began
spreading on the Internet.
And the praise he received Sunday from
Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan
prompted pointed questions - during Tues
day night's presidential debate and also in a
private meeting over the weekend with Jew
ish leaders in Cleveland.
During the debate, Obama repeated his
denunciation of Farrakhan's views, which
have included numerous anti-Semitic com
ments. And, after being pressed, he rejected
Farrakhan's support in the presidential
race.
The Democratic candidate says repeat
edly that he's a Christian who took the oath
of office on a family Bible. Yet on the Inter
net and on talk radio - and in a campaign in
troduction for John McCain this week - he is
often depicted, falsely, as a Muslim with
shadowy ties and his middle name, Hussein,
is emphasized as a reminder of Iraq's for
mer leader.
"If anyone is still puzzled about the facts,
in fact I have never been a Muslim," he told
the Jewish leaders in Cleveland, according
to a transcript of the private session.
The photo of Obama wearing Kenyan
tribal raiments - taken by an Associated
Press photographer during his visit in 2006
to the country where his father was born -
resurfaced on the Internet amid unsubstan
tiated claims that it was being circulated by
members of Hillary Rodham Clinton's cam
paign. Clinton and her aides said they had
nothing to do with it.The Obama campaign
accused them of "shameful, offensive fear
mongering."
On TUesday Republican candidate Mc-
Cain denounced the introduction he got in
Cincinnati that criticized Obama in vivid
terms. Talk show host Bill Cunningham re
ferred to Obama three times as "Barack
Hussein Obama" and called him a "hack,
Chicago-style" politician during the intro
duction of McCain.
The Obama campaign is closely attuned
to the rumors and insinuations. Information
on Obama's Christian faith is prominently
available on the"Know the facts" page of
his Web site. The campaign has distributed
flyers to churches in states with presidential
contests. And it encourages supporters to
flag any attack that may make its way into
cyberspace.
"Our campaign is vigilant in quickly re
sponding to any information about Senator
Obama that surfaces, be it on the Internet,
in the media or from our opponents,"
spokesman Bill Burton said Wednesday.
If there is confusion - and opportunity
for political mischief - it derives at least in
part from Obama's rich cultural back
ground.
