# Senior Impact
## 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD 
In terms of Stanford basketball. Fred
Washington has seen it all. He's seen
the highs. A fifth-year forward, Wash
ington was recruited by and played a
year under legendary Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery 1 . Washington saw limited
minutes but played on a team that won 30
games and was ranked No. 1 in the nation.
He's also seen the lows. During the 2005-06
campaign he played only six games before un
dergoing knee surgery, watching on the side
lines as the team sputtered into the NIT with
a 16-14 record.
Washington's fellow seniors, Taj Finger,
Peter Prowitt and Kenny Brown, never
played under Montgomery. But all four en
tered the program during an era of great suc
cess and high expectations, only to struggle
under a transition period with Trent Johnson.
Yet as each takes the floor for the final time

at Maples this weekend, Stanford is once again
a top-ten team. With the program again a con
tender in the Pac-10,and perhaps beyond, the
team in many respects reflects the influence
and impact of its senior leaders.
Taj Finger
Showing up on the Farm as a skinny 6-8
forward from Mt. Kisko. N.Y.. Finger carved
out a niche as an energy-providing spark off
the bench. While he averaged gaudy numbers
(18 points. 12 rebounds, 8 blocks, 5 steals and
4.5 assists) in high school. Finger soon found
and embraced his role as the hustle player, the
type of guy every coach wants on his team.
Finger often looked to the senior leaders
of those Cardinal squads, players like Rob Lit-

tie and now-assistant coach Nick
Robinson. Over the years, as he began
to assume the mantle of leadership
himself, he emulated the style of Chris
Hernandez, the demanding point
guard who would often lead by exam
ple.
"Everyone thinks the world of
Chris," Finger said. "If I could be
thought of like Chris Hernandez, that
would be pretty cool."
Like Hernandez, Finger's intensity
is one of his defining traits. His
propensity to dive for rebounds and
loose balls quickly endeared him to
the Maples Pavilion faithful.
A team co-captain. Finger has en
joyed a good relationship with head
coach Trent Johnson since the two first
came to the Farm in 2(X)4. Perhaps
more than any other player. Finger
has epitomized Johnson's hard-nosed,
defensive style of play.
"He kind of gets me.and 1 get him."
Finger said of his coach. "We get along
real well."
Johnson, for his part, described
Finger as "passionate" and"the ulti
mate team guy."
Much as his coach repeats the
mantra to take the season "one game
at a time." Finger is not dwelling much
on his final home stand in a Stanford
jersey. He plans to play overseas
somewhere after graduation, but for
now. Finger has his sights set squarely
on winning against Washington.
"If you get caught up in all that
stuff you probably won't play as
well." he said of the pre-game Senior
Night festivities. "1 probably won't
really think about it until the game's
over."
Fred Washington
Along with the ups and downs in
the win and loss columns, Washington
has seen just about every injury there
is. He's had three surgeries, one on his
wrist, one on one knee and two on an
other. Just this season, the Los Ange
les native has struggled with bronchi
tis,pulled a groin and jammed a thumb

several times.
Dealing with the injuries, as well as
the sometimes-difficult transition
from Montgomery' to Johnson, has
served Washington well. "I'm better
suited to notice the good stuff more,
and kind of block out the bad stuff," he
said.
One thing he blocks out is the
2005-2006 campaign. Recovering
from knee injury, he kept his distance
while the team struggled with injuries
and a lack of cohesiveness.
"I say I wasn't there," is his reply
when someone brings up the season.
"That year is blank for me."
Since then, both Washington and
the team have recovered.The growth
of Mitch Johnson, Anthony Goods
and Lawrence Hill, as well as the ar
rival of Brook and Robin Lopez,
helped the team rebound from the
disappointing NIT season in 2006.
Washington, meanwhile, started all
31 games while developing a reputa
tion as one of the team's best ball
handlers, most valuable perimeter
defenders and hardest workers.
"What he goes through to get him
self prepared to play, prepared to
practice, it's special," Johnson said.
"He's stubborn in a very very good
way. 1 le speaks his mind in a very very
good way."
For Washington, shifting expecta
tions has also taken work.
"1 thought we were going to win
the Pac-10 title every year," he said. "1
got greedy ... It's been weird to start
off at the very very top, then go pretty
far down, then come back up."
While he's not sure what exactly
lies in his future plans — he may play
overseas, and says he'll likely eventu
ally attend law school — Washington
will check in on his former teammates
next season to make sure the progress
continues.
"Stanford was good before the
twins. Stanford will be good after the
twins," he said of the team's prospects
if Brook and Robin Lopez declare for
the NBA Draft."They'll find a way."

"College basket
ball is kind of
baptism by fire.
I'm grateful for
my experience."

Peter Prowitt, senior

Kenny Brown
A self-described "late bloomer" in
high school. Brown was not recruited
by any colleges. Ihe Southlake, Tex.,
native took the initiative, however,
and sent materials to several Division
-1 coaches.
Mike Montgomery was one who
took notice. Even after Montgomery's
departure to the NBA, Brown talked
with Johnson and earned an invitation
to Stanford's morning workout in the
fall of his freshman year. Soon after, he
had worked his way onto the team as
a walk-on.
Brown played sparingly his first
two seasons at Stanford, but the
sweet-shooting guard broke out last
year with a 22-point performance
against Arizona on March 3. With sev
eral of his teammates battling food
poisoning, he seized the moment and
hit four three-pointers, including a
game-tying shot with 6.1 seconds left
in regulation, although the team even
tually' fell 85-80 in overtime.

"I was joking around before the
game, seeing if 1 could administer
lVs," the human biology major said." 1
had no idea what was to come."
Brown emerged as a viable option
off the bench, however, and soon be
came a fan favorite for his penchant
for hitting the longball. ITie 6th Man
honored him with calls for "Down
town Kenny Brown."
While Johnson was finally able to
offer him a scholarship for next sea
son. Brown will attend dental school
at Baylor University.
"I've gotten a lot of stuff from Stan
ford. the exposure to great players ...
academically,you can't put into words
how much I've benefited from that."
he said. "A school of this caliber will
get you a lot of places."
Peter Prowitt
What can Brown do for Prowitt? A
little dental work wouldn't hurt.
Served with the unenviable duty of
guarding the Lopez twins in practice.
Prowitt lost his two front teeth cour
tesy of a Brook Lopez elbow for his
troubles during a scrimmage last
spring.
"I looked like I was from Virginia
at that point." the Arlington. Va., na
tive said.
After a promising first two seasons
on the Farm, Prowitt suffered a bro
ken bone in his right knee his last fall.
By the time he recovered, the Lopez
twins had assumed most of the big
man minutes in the rotation — leav
ing Prowitt the role of guarding them
in practice, which is "a full time job."
he said.
"College basketball is kind of a
baptism by fire," the political science
major, currently interviewing for
Teach For America, said."l'm grateful
for my experience."
Said Washington: "It's just a mira
cle he's still alive."
He would know.
