Both the Cardinal bats and arms have been
in full throttle to begin the season, as the team
has started 16-1 seemingly with ease due to
dominant pitching and timely hitting.

pitch she saw over the center field

Providence pitcher Jennifer
Maccio was clearly rattled by the
rough start â€” the junior starter
walked the number two, three, and
four hitters to load the bases. But the
Cardinal had trouble converting,
and runners were thrown out at
home on back to back plays. Neill
would later single to left, though,
scoring freshman Melisa Koutz and
senior Michelle Smith.
Hie Card put the game on ice
with another three-run inning in the
fourth. Haber got things started
again, leading off with a single and
stealing second base. Senior Tricia
Aggabao reached first base on an
error that allowed Haber to advance
to third. Aggabao then stole second
to put two runners in scoring posi
tion for standout junior Maddy
Coon.
Coon singled to left, scoring
Haber. Smith scored Aggabao on a
sacrifice fly, also advancing Coon to
third. Koutz kept the carousel going
with a single that scored Coon, and
that would be the last of the scoring.
Sophomore Shannon Koplitz lined
out to shortstop to end the inning,
and neither team would plate anoth
er run.
Yesterday's victory was another
strong showing for Stanford, as it
builds on the momentum of last
weekend's success at the Palm
Springs Classic. The team will play
five games this weekend when it
travels to the Worth Classic in
Fullerton. Calif. The Card begin
