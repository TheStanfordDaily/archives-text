## Tuition increases by modest amount Including financial aid, average tuition costs per student expected to drop next year 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While some students will get a break
from Stanford's enhanced financial aid pro
gram. others might he facing sticker shock
next year. ITic University has announced a
decision by the Board of Trustees to increase
total undergraduate fees, which include
tuition, room and board, by 3.5 percent for
the 2008-2(X)9 academic year.
The announced change in costs repre
sents the smallest annual increase so far this
decade, which has not thus far seen an
increase smaller than 4.5 percent, according

to University data. But many students —
including the 36 percent of undergraduates
who do not currently receive any aid from
Stanford — could still be hit by an addition
al $1,604 next year.
The reduced tuition increase coincides
with a United States Senate Finance
Committee inquiry into rising college costs
that outpace inflation in universities nation
wide. In response to an eleven-point ques
tionnaire sent by the committee, the
University reported last week that average
tuition per student — after taking Stanford
aid into account — has been rising slightly
over the last five vears and will likely decline

next year.
While undergraduate tuition will
increase from $34,800 to $36,030 next year,
average tuition after Stanford support is
expected to fall from $20,597 to $18,572.
While actual tuition may be rising at a
rate higher than inflation, average tuition
has risen at a much smaller rate and will
decrease next year. In response to the
Senate Finance Committee's inquiry, the
University suggested that this means tuition
revenue does not cover University costs,
which are rising at a higher pace than that of
inflation.
Full tuition, for those who pay it. covers

only about two-thirds of the total cost to the
University per student. Average tuition,
which factors in Stanford aid, covers only 40
percent of costs. This number will drop to 35
percent once the new financial aid measures
are put into place, the University said in its
letter to the Senate committee. The balance
is paid from endowment spending and dona
tions.
Next year's drop in average tuition,
which will also likely occur at the several Ivy
League schools that have introduced new
financial aid initiatives for 2008, may
assuage much of the Senate's concern,
according to Stanford's Director of

Government Relations Larry Horton.
"I would not be surprised it' they don't
slow down their considerations in the mat
ter, or actually think things are in better
shape than they thought." 1 lorton said.
The discrepancy between increases in the
published tuition rate and declines in the
average tuition students pay can be attrib
uted to the various restrictions on the
University endowment, said Vice Provost
for Budget Management Tim Warner.
"It is the case that tuition is the largest
source of unrestricted funds," Warned said.
"If you are able to generate restrict
ed funds to pay for financial aid, the
question as to what the net amount
of tuition [the sticker price) is, is
really a different question."
Over 75 percent of the Stanford
endowment is restricted to specific
spending purposes, according to the
University's response to the Senate
inquiry, lliis compares with 70 per
cent for Princeton and 83 percent

for Harvard.
Because of these significant
restrictions, it is not the case that
this year's tuition increase is simply
covering the costs of a new financial
aid program, according to Warner.
"As you increase financial aid, if
you increase it with restricted funds,
then tuition is not redistributed to
financial aid." Warner said.
According to University officials,
pressure from the Senate Finance
Committee and lower tuition
increases by peer institutions did
not force the hand of the Board of
Trustees as it set next year's tuition.
"Each year we look at four or

live principle factors," Warner said.
"We look at the needs of the
University, we look at peer institu
tions' tuition increases, we look at
general economic climate, and
affordability of the Stanford educa
tion, and we also try to gauge what
the general public's perceptions are
about higher education."
Warner said that this year, the
poor health of the economy led to a
smaller tuition increase.
"It really becomes a judgment,"
Warner said. "Some years some fac
tors are used more heavily than oth
ers. This year in particular, we felt
that given the general economic

times we needed to have a more
modest tuition increase."
This year's modest increase is not
necessarily a harbinger of things to
come, said Jeff Wachtel, senior assis
tant to President Hennessy.
"We set it one year at a time,"
Wachtel said. "The trustees meet on
an annual basis to consider tuition,
room and board. It is difficult to pre
dict what the future will hold, but we
hope to set tuition at as low a level
as possible and still be able to meet
the University 's needs."
