## Grads seek health benefits Students hope to replace canceled policy for spouses, children 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Health care is one of the most hotly debated
issues among presidential candidates. But it is also
a sensitive issue for a more local constituency:
Stanford's graduate students.
Stanford University, in collaboration with the
Health Insurance Advisory Committee and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC), decided to dis
continue the Dependant Health Care Plan for
graduate students in 2006. Though the GSC.
Vaden and the graduate students themselves have
been searching for a solution to the dilemma of
providing adequate and affordable health insur
ance for graduate students' families, two years
later they have yet to settle on a plan of action.
"The University decided to discontinue the
dependant health insurance plan in 2006 because
the costs of the plan had escalated to an unsustain
able point." said Ira Friedman, Associate Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and director at Vaden
Health Center, in an email to The Daily.
"Relatively few people were enrolled in the plan."
In 2006, the dependant health insurance rate
was $475 per month for a spouse or domestic part
ner. The figure was projected to increase by more
than 50 percent in the 2006-2007 year before the
University decided to discontinue the program.
"Since 2(X)6. the Graduate Student Council has
tried to collect statistics of graduate student
dependant health care plans at other universities,"
said GSC Co-President Kristina Keating, a gradu
ate student in Environmental Sciences. "We fig
ured out that Stanford is the only top tier univer
sity in the states that doesn't offer dependant
health care for its graduate students."
"Even back when Stanford did offer depen
dant health care, the monthly premium rate was
much higher than those at other universities such

as MIT or Harvard," Keating added.
The main reason for this discrepancy is that,
unlike other universities, Stanford placed the
graduates' dependants in a separate health insur
ance pool. Since only around 100 dependants from
over 75 families were enrolled, costs were high.
And as the insurance rate increased, enrollment
declined, which caused the insurance rate to
increase even more â€” a phenomenon termed a
health insurance "death spiral," according to
Keating.
One potential solution that graduates have
suggested is to place the graduates' dependants on
the same health insurance plan as the entire stu
dent population. Although such a move would
drastically decrease the insurance rate for depen
dants, Friedman said it could potentially increase
rates across the board for all students.
"Combining the dependant program with the
lower-cost student plan Cardinal Care would lead
to an unfair burden in terms of increased premi
ums for the students in Cardinal Care," Friedman
said.
To compensate for the lack of a dependant
health care plan, Vaden and the GSC' have teamed
up to offer workshops and information sessions
introducing graduate students to local health
insurance programs.
"While these alternate plans aren't horribly
expensive, they're not that great either," said
Adam Beberg, a graduate student in computer sci
ence and GSC parliamentarian. "Health care com
panies don't want to insure women between the
ages of 18 and 30, so even if you can get insurance
here, you're constantly worried that they're going
to drop you. That adds a lot of stress to graduate
students with families."
For David Erickson, another graduate student
in computer science, this lack of dependant health
insurance seems frustrating. As a 27-year-old mar
ried masters student deciding amongst a number
of graduate programs, health care is one of his
main considerations in the decision.
"My wife is an elementary school teacher, and
this graduate program will be around four or five

years long," Erickson said. "Sometime in that peri
od. we would like to have a ehild or two."
After researching the finances, however,
Erickson soon realized that without affordable
dependant health care from Stanford, his wife
would have to keep working while they have chil
dren.
"If 1 stay here for graduate school, then 1 have
to take on a lot of student debt to cover my wife
and future child's health care," Erickson said.
"Otherwise my wife is going to be miserable. And
after all the stress and work, she would only be
bringing home approximately $600 per month if
you deduct health care costs, day care costs, taxes,
etc."
Keating said Stanford's lack of affordable
dependant health care could negatively affect the
attractiveness of Stanford to graduate students
choosing between different programs.
"The greatest concern is that graduate students
with families, or students who plan on starting
families in the course of their study, will choose

other schools over Stanford because
of this lack of dependant health
care," Keating said.
If Stanford loses its ability to
recruit top graduate students,
Erickson said the University's long
term prestige could be negatively
affected.
"I feel that since graduate stu
dents drive the prestige of the
University through research and
patents, the University would take
good care of its graduate students,"

Erickson said. "It seems wrong that
a school with a hospital and com
plete medical program can't deliver
a health care plan to graduates'
dependants."
The problem is even worse for
international students, who make up
approximately one-third of the grad
uate student population, according
to Keating.
"It's a loosely enforced rule that
graduates' dependants must have
health insurance," Keating said."But
the spouses of international students
cannot work, so it is even harder for
them to obtain or pay for health
care."
"It's a complex issue," Keating
added. "Vaden has been very sup

portive. and we continue to look for
solutions. We simply advocate that
the University do more research on
the issue and find a compromise in
the near future."
Friedman said the solution will
probably not reinstate the depen
dant insurance plan.
"Although we have continued to
search for solutions, the underlying
realities have remained the same."
Friedman said. "It's not affordable
to insure a small group of people
with very high medical costs, so 1
doubt that we can reinstate the
dependant insurance plan."
