# STUDENT GROUPS
## Changing lives, one rubber band at a time 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
A group of Stanford undergrads set out last Friday to fight
breast cancer.
Their strategy? Create the world's largest rubber band ball
in twenty-hour hours.

The group,
RubberßandTogether,
is one of 357 teams from
around the world, as
well as about 80 from
the Farm, competing in
the second annual
Innovation Tournament
as part of the
Entrepreneurship Week
(E-Week) at Stanford.
Participants are given
five days to create the
most value, broadly
defined, from an every
day object, which this
year are rubber bands.
Teams will submit their
entries today in the
form of a three-minute
video and post them to

campus and in the world at large.
After its successful debut last
February, the week-long program
returned to campus last Friday and
has featured speaking engagements
open to the public and several stu
dent activities, including a start-up
job fair and "speed dating" session
where would-be entrepreneurs have
an opportunity to pitch their business
ideas to Silicon Valley venture capi
talists.
Tina Seelig, professor of
Management Science and
Engineering and Executive Director
of Stanford Technology Ventures
Program, said that the Innovation
Tournament is designed to give stu
dents a taste of entrepreneurship.
"The goal is to give students a
chance to experiment with entrepre
neurial thinking," she said. "In order
to be successful, they must take risks,
challenge assumptions, identify
opportunities, leverage limited
resources and create value."
Two-time E-Week participant Jae
Joh '09 said that, more than just get
ting people interested in entrepre
neurship, E-Week immerses partici
pants into the entrepreneurial think
ing and gets them truly involved in
entrepreneurship in a fun way.
"As Tina [Prof. Seelig] always says,
it's an extreme sport," he said. "You
have to do it yourself to get anything
from it."
Teams, like
Rubber Band I'ogether. have taken
this advice to heart.
In a one-day effort to generate
awareness and help find a cure for
breast cancer, team members urged
students to "band together" against
breast cancer by signing their Web
site. For each name listed, the team
would add a rubber band to their
rubber band ball.
"The idea is to use rubber bands
in such a way that it would give each
individual band a significant mean
ing, basically creating social value
with every single rubber band." said
team member Ricky Yean 10, who
also participated in E-Week last
year. "We do that by assigning peo
ple's pledge to fight breast cancer to
each band and put it all together to
make a huge rubber band ball that
represents the collective desire to
spread awareness about and fight

breast cancer."
However, Yean maintains that
their project will do more than just
creating social value.
"We are creating economic value
by driving donations to the Susan G.
Komen Foundation, and we have
companies like Loopt signed on to
actually donate," he added. "We are
also making a video as the ball
grows, which will have considerable
entertainment value."
Joh hopes that in the coming
years, E-Week will expose more stu
dents to the lessons and innovation
of entrepreneurial thinking and
enable them to experience the art of
entrepreneurship firsthand.
"I want to never forget the power
of an idea and that value can be cre
ated from just about anything," Joh
said. "Next year I'd love it if every
one on campus participated some
how. making it sort of a Stanford tra
dition to have participated in E
week at least once before gradua
tion."
Winners of this year's Innovation
Tournament will be announced
tomorrow at the E-Week finale held
at 5 p.m. in the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center.
Although they look forward to
hearing the final outcome, partici
pants are just proud of their efforts
over the last five days.
"It's [RubberßandTogether| a
success regardless of the results," said
Yean. "The team worked great
together and it really shows how
much a team of entrepreneurs full of
energy and passion can do in five
days. These are the people that will
make changes in the world that we
live in."
