## Fundraising strong despite worries over economy 2007 donations unaffected by slump; effect unknown for '08 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With signs of an economic slowdown, the
eyes of university development officers
across the country are fixed on their dona
tion figures. But last year Stanford had lit
tle to worry about, raising $832.4 million,
the highest total of any U.S. college.
Harvard came in second, raising $614
million, according to the Council for Aid to
Education (CAE). The previous year.
Stanford raised $911 million, a record for
any college in a single year.
The University remains committed to
the Stanford Challenge, a five-year. $4.3 bil
lion fundraising initiative.
"So far we've having another good
year," said Martin Shell, vice president of
the Office of Development, of the current
cycle. "Based against the progress-to-date
of previous financial years, we haven't seen
any significant drop so far."
For donors. Shell believes the economy
is a secondary consideration relative to the
University's need for their gift.
"The most important driver for most
philanthropic institutions is the message
and how we're communicating to our con
stituency," Shell said. "You could have the
most robust economy in the world, but if
the organization can't tell its story then it's
not going to receive much."

Some experts agreed with this assess
ment.
"The economy doesn't drive giving." said
Ann Kaplan, director of Voluntary Support
of Education Survey at the Council for
Aids to Education.
As the year progresses, however, the
effects of the economic downturn will
become clearer.
"The donors where we might see some
strain would be with something like a
'stretch gift,'" Shell said of unusually large
donations. "When you're considering
whether to stretch when the economy is at
sea, that donor could feel a lot of pressure."
Foundations, a crucial set of institutions
for development, will see the least short
term fluctuations.
"Foundations in the short-run are going
to be the least affected," Shell said. "Any
serious drop in foundational giving will be a
lagging indicator, as the effects depend on
investment markets."
If giving drops amidst serious economic
difficulty, development offices will look to
apply the lessons of past experience, includ
ing the economic difficulties during the
early part of the decade.
"People in development offices will have
to be somewhat concerned," Kaplan said.
"But if you've been in the field long
enough, then you have a trust behind you.
and you learn to modify expectations and
to manage the expectations of those around
you."
