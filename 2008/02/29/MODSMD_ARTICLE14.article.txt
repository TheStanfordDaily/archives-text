PROVIDENCE. R.I. (AP) — Brown
University has become the latest
major university to make paying for
college easier.
The Ivy League school's governing
board on Saturday said grants will be
substituted for loans for families that
make less than $100.000 per year.
Parents who earn less than $60,000
also will no longer be expected to
make a financial contribution to fund
their child's education at Brown.
The policy reduces loans for all
students who receive financial aid,
regardless of income. The provisions'
apply to current students as well as
next fall's incoming class.
The new policy will bump Brown's
budget for financial aid by 20 percent
to more than $68 million next year.
Harvard, Princeton and Stanford
are among the schools that have
replaced loans with grants recently.
