## Supreme Court sides with Exxon-Mobil 
### MARK SHERMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court seemed inclined Wednesday
to let Exxon Mobil Corp. off the
hook for some of the $2.5 billion the
energy giant was ordered to pay as
punishment for a massive oil spill in
Alaska nearly 19 years ago.
The justices questioned lawyers
for the company and nearly 33,000
victims of the Exxon Valdez disaster
for 90 minutes, making only one
passing reference to Exxon's record
profits. The award represents less
than three weeks' worth of Exxon
profit, which was $11.7 billion in the
last three months of 2007.
Exxon has vigorously fought to
knock down or erase the punitive
damages verdict by a jury in Alaska
in 1994 for the accident that dumped
11 million gallons of oil into Prince
William Sound. The environmental
disaster fouled 1,200 miles of

Alaskan coastline and led to the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of
seabirds and marine animals.
The verdict has been cut in half
once by a federal appeals court.
Ilie problem for the people, busi
nesses and governments who waged
the lengthy legal fight against Exxon
is that the Supreme Court in recent
years has become more receptive to
limiting punitive damages awards.
Ilie Exxon Valdez case differs from
the others in that it involves issues
peculiar to laws governing accidents
on the water.
But several justices said that lim
its could be appropriate in this con
text too.
Justice Stephen Breyer, who has
voted to overturn damages awards,
said he worried how the court's deci
sion in this case would play in other
maritime accidents.
"This is a very dramatic accident.
