## Supreme Court sides with Exxon-Mobil 
### MARK SHERMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court seemed inclined Wednesday
to let Exxon Mobil Corp. off the
hook for some of the $2.5 billion the
energy giant was ordered to pay as
punishment for a massive oil spill in
Alaska nearly 19 years ago.
The justices questioned lawyers
for the company and nearly 33,000
victims of the Exxon Valdez disaster
for 90 minutes, making only one
passing reference to Exxon's record
profits. The award represents less
than three weeks' worth of Exxon
profit, which was $11.7 billion in the
last three months of 2007.
Exxon has vigorously fought to
knock down or erase the punitive
damages verdict by a jury in Alaska
in 1994 for the accident that dumped
11 million gallons of oil into Prince
William Sound. The environmental
disaster fouled 1,200 miles of

Alaskan coastline and led to the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of
seabirds and marine animals.
The verdict has been cut in half
once by a federal appeals court.
Ilie problem for the people, busi
nesses and governments who waged
the lengthy legal fight against Exxon
is that the Supreme Court in recent
years has become more receptive to
limiting punitive damages awards.
Ilie Exxon Valdez case differs from
the others in that it involves issues
peculiar to laws governing accidents
on the water.
But several justices said that lim
its could be appropriate in this con
text too.
Justice Stephen Breyer, who has
voted to overturn damages awards,
said he worried how the court's deci
sion in this case would play in other
maritime accidents.
"This is a very dramatic accident.
It involves oil spills, and they cause
an enormous amount of trouble," he
said. "But there are accidents every
day, and ships are filled with acci
dents like automobiles in other
places. And there are all kinds of
things that go wrong.... What princi
ples do you have to suggest, if any,
for creating a fair system that isn't
just arbitrary?"
Justices Anthony Kennedy and
David Souter suggested that per
haps a reasonable number would be
twice the amount of money the
company has paid to compensate
victims for economic losses, about
$500 million.
Overall, Exxon has paid $3.4 bil
lion in fines, penalties, cleanup costs,
claims and other expenses resulting
from the worst oil spill in U.S. histo
ry-
"Exxon gained nothing by what
went wrong in this case and paid
dearly for it," said lawyer Walter
Dellinger, who urged the court to
throw out the punitive damages
judgment that has been upheld by
the San Francisco-based 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Stanford University law profes
sor Jeffrey Fisher said the commer
cial fishermen, Native Alaskans,
landowners, businesses and local
governments he represents have
each received about $15,000 so far
"for having their lives and liveli
hood destroyed and haven't
received a dime of emotional-dis
tress damages."
Fisher said nothing in prior
Supreme Court decisions should
cause the justices to overturn the
$2.5 billion award, about $75,000 for

each plaintiff.
It was less clear how the court
would rule on the issue of whether
the company should have to pay
damages at all under the Clean
Water Act and centuries-old laws
governing shipping. Justice Samuel
Alito, who owns Exxon stock, is not
taking part in the case. A 4-4 split on
that or any issue would leave the
appeals court ruling in place.
The key element there is
whether Exxon can be held liable at
all for the acts of Exxon Valdez cap
tain Joseph Hazelwood. Hazelwood
was not on the ship's bridge when
the accident occurred and had been
drinking shortly before it left port,
both in violation of Coast Guard
rules and company policy.
"What more can the corporation
do other than say, 'Here is our poli
cies'? And try to implement them?"
Chief Justice John Roberts said.
Fisher said Exxon had many
warnings over three years that
Hazelwood, an alcoholic, was drink
ing and that it knew that "putting a
drunken master in charge of a
supertanker was a potential for dis
aster and incalculably raised the
chances of a disaster and a cata
strophic spill occurring."
Two brothers from Cordova,
Alaska, were in line in front of the
Supreme Court on Wednesday
morning, waiting to watch the argu
ments inside.
Commercial fisherman Steve
Copeland, who was 41 at the time of
the spill, said he cannot afford to
retire because his business has
never recovered from the steep
decline it suffered due to the disas
ter.
His brother, Tom, said that
Exxon "needs to get told they need
to be a better corporate citizen."
A decision is expected before
summer.
