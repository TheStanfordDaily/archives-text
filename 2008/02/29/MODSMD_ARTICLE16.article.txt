## Editorial Board Studying abroad: more options needed 
### 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) at Stanford offers students
wonderful opportunities to experi
ence- many countries around the world.
Stanford-run centers in Florence and Berlin
allow for controlled immersion, where local
living is supplemented by an Fnglish-speak
ing facility.Traveling programs, like the one
in Australia, expose students to a wide land
scape of the country, a luxury not afforded
though single-city abroad programs. But
however varied, these options are still limit
ed in number and location.
Many Stanford students do travel abroad
with BOSP programs. However, others
choose to enroll either in other college's
abroad programs or private study abroad
programs, demonstrating student interest
for a broader variety of programs than those
currently offered bv BOSP. Stanford should
form partnerships with other colleges
around the world, allowing students to study
abroad in more locales than are currently of
fered.
The Education Abroad Program offered
by the University of California partners with
local institutions, providing students with
opportunities to study abroad in 34 different
countries. The University of California takes
advantage of existing facilities in many loca
tions. The school does not set up centers and
hire its own staff, as Stanford does in most of
its locations, but instead relies heavily on
local university faculty. If Stanford invested
in similar partnerships, it could greatly ex
pand the number of study abroad sites avail
able to students.
Stanford should send students to local
universities in countries like Brazil. Israel,
Egypt and India. By attending such schools,
advanced-language students would have the
opportunity for substantial cultural ex

change. Furthermore, Stanford could ensure
that the quality of education would not by
sacrificed by approving a list of courses and
requiring a research paper or thesis. For stu
dents who have command of a foreign lan
guage, the opportunity to research in a for
eign country, coupled with the opportunity
for full cultural immersion, would provide a
valuable academic and cultural experience.

However wonderful
and varied, BOSP
programs are still
limited in number
and location.

With the recent addition of the Stanford
in Madrid program, the University is re
sponding to student desires for more study
abroad options. The recommendations of
fered here, however, would allow an even
greater number of students to study in the
country of their choice. Although these sug
gestions would force the character of BOSP
services to change fundamentally, we be
lieve such alterations would greatly benefit
the student body, allowing students to take
full advantage of their time spent at Stan
ford.
