## Good riddance

This past Monday, the government of
Pakistan ordered all of the ISPs in the
country to block its citizens' Internet
access to You Tube.com.
Predictably, this decision was met with up
roar. Charges of stifling free speech and qui
eting the masses soon rang across the U.S.
from the bell towers of Internet.TV and print
media conglomerates.
ITiis wasn't the first time something like
this has happened; Pakistan doesn't have the
best track record in terms of human rights.
Before and during its recent elections, the
government arrested hoards of protestors on
spurious grounds and engaged in mass police
beatings. Shortly before elections, the attor
ney general was caught on tape saying that
these same elections would be "massively
rigged." And several days ago, the leadership
imposed a ban on all live broadcasts within
the country - .
But this time. Pakistan's curtailing of free
dom in the name of an all-powerful central
state was right on target! Its subsequent inter
ference with You Tube's IP routing caused a
two-hour, worldwide You Tube blackout. For
two glorious hours, the rest of the world was
free from the yoke of You Tube's oppression.
Pakistan was actually the third country to
block its citizens' access to You Tube, follow
ing Turkey and Thailand. But that doesn't
make its act any less meritorious. It's ahead of
its time in realizing what a horrible, horrible
Web site You Tube is. ITiough Pakistan has
stated publicly that its decision was based on
blasphemous content, I think we all know
that at least part of the decision was based on
a clip of a dog humping a boy trying to play
Nintendo Wii.
I would go as far as to say that
YouTlibe.com is our society's worst cultural
creation since hampsterdance.com. the Web
site that helped us all to realize that 125 four
frame animated singing hamsters is the most
annoying thing mankind can experience.
You Tube is the dumpster of the Internet,
and that's saying a lot given that a significant
portion of the Internet is already trash. Oh
sure. I enjoy the occasional video. I enjoy clips
of fat people rolling down inclined surfaces as
much as the next man. but really now. is there
anything of actual quality on YouTUbe?
Searching YouTlibe is in many ways like fish
ing in a pond contaminated by toxic waste.
Ihe vast majority of fish you can catch are in
fected. and if you happen to enjoy eating a
fish once you catch it. you're probably going
to get cancer.
I think the bottom line here is that calling
the shutting down of Youllibe a stifling of
free speech is like calling the shutting down of
Fox News the stifling of freedom of the press.
Sure, both of these cases are technically valid,
but god. the world of journalism would be in-

finitely better off without Fox News and the
trash it broadcasts daily. And the world of
freedom of speech could get along perfectly
well without You Tube.
Perhaps the biggest problem with
YouHibe is the high-blown rhetoric that sur
rounds it. An extreme disparity exists be
tween the idealistic and romantic talk of the
potential of user-created Internet video and
the sad. sad reality. Commentators have
championed You Tube as a glorious vehicle
for democratic expression and have placed it
at the heart of an informed Utopian democra
cy. But... You Tube?
Time's 2(XW> Person of the Year was" You,"
certainly a nod to the Web site and its user
driven content. In the description of the
award, the magazine states: "It's about the
many wresting power from the few and help
ing one another for nothing and how that will
not only change the world, but also change
the way the world changes."
But You Tube? Sure, we had the You Tube
debates, and what a step forward it was for
democracy (even if the questions asked were
those that would have been asked anyway).
But really. You√üibe? You Tube should never
be used in the same sentence as "wresting
power from the few." Those selfsame debate
clips max out around 250,000 views, only sev
eral more than the number of views of a
shrimp running on an underwater treadmill.
Whatever happened to the day when our
culture was defined by such things as "litera
ture," "plays" and "music?" Gone are the
Gatsbies, swallowed instead by the instruc
tional video for the Soulja Boy Tellem's
"Crank That" dance.
And if the comments below the videos are
any indication, the English language itself is
doomed. The poor spelling and the rampant
racism, sexism, anti-scmitism and penis refer
ences are enough to make any first grade
English teacher weep.
So you can see that, in blocking
You'lUbe.com. the government of Pakistan
was doing its citizens a service. No more will
their ears be pierced by the shrill cry of "leave
Britney Alone!!" or the absurd and repetitive
chorus of "Chocolate Rain." And maybe.just
maybe, our own government should take a
page from Pakistan's b00k... at least this
time.
