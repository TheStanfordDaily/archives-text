# Little Ms. Modern
## Trying too hard 
### 
I'm not especially athletic, but thanks to
Title IX and the shared un-athleticism of
most of my classmates, 1 was able to be a
three-season varsity athlete for most of high
school. My sport was running.and 1 loved it in
all of its forms — the miserable absurdity of
winter track, the frightening intensity of
spring track and, most of all. the endless,
lonely pain of cross country in the fall. At
some points in my running career, 1 was de
cent. even though most of the time I was
merely not pathetically bad (although some
times I was that. too). Most of the time, I con
veniently ignored the fact that my enthusi
asm for the sport far exceeded my natural
ability.
That wasn't true for all the girls on the
team, though. While 1 determinedly put in
extra miles on the weekend, pushed myself to
the point of vomiting during track workouts
and obsessed over the math of split times 1
needed to achieve personal bests, others did
not. There was one teammate in particular
who was a downright slacker. She seemed to
lack any semblance of the mental toughness
that 1 had convinced myself was the corner
stone of success in running, and yet she was
an astonishingly successful racer. She also
seemed to lack basic social graces; one day
she asked me if I minded that even though I
trained much harder than she did. she kicked
my ass in every race.
And. oh. how 1 did mind. It was just so
heartbreakingly unjust! Up until that point. 1
had been happily convinced of the funda
mental. wonderful truth of the American
dream: if you work hard and play by the rules,
you will win. Competitive running shattered
this ideal for me, and as my loathsome team
mate beat me time and again, the first waves
of cynicism drowned out the idealism of my
sixteen-year-old worldview. 1 resigned myself

to a more jaded understanding of things: if
you work hard and play by the rules,you'll do
okay, but you'll probably lose to someone
with innate genetic advantage.
Meanwhile, though I wasn't born to run. 1
was born to take standardized tests and raise
my hand a lot in class. Academic triumph
compensated for athletic disappointment,
and while I certainly worked hard in school,
it seemed clear that much of my success was
thanks to an inherent talent I had nothing to
do with. Ever the hypocrite, I bemoaned the
unfairness of genetic advantage on the track
but was simultaneously eager to use my own
in the classroom. "I won without really even
training!"sounded distasteful.but "I got an A
without really even studying!"sounded quite
tasty indeed.
After five years in the academic big
leagues, however, most of this unbecoming
overconfidence has been bled out of me. But
even in grad school, a tendency to glorify nat
ural-born awesomeness manages to survive,
if not prevail. A friend recently told me that
she respects people who are incredibly intel
ligent and somewhat lazy far more than those
who embody the opposite combination. I
heartily disagree,but 1 can see why she might
feel that way. The romantic ideal of the bril
liant slacker is quite alluring in a modern
world that perpetuates a knows-it-all-but
doesn't-care apathy as hip and authentic.
Today's worst insult, far more embarrassing

than the now-obsolete "uncool," is "trying
too hard."
But really, what's so had about trying
hard? I*he suggestion that we should stick to
what we're good at and avoid everything else
sounds dangerously like some kind of fascist
genetic predeterminism. Should we only let
people born with fast-twitch muscles play
sports? Should we screen childhood IQs to
decide what career paths are allowed?
Should people who are mediocre at most
things that society values lock themselves in
their closets forever? This clearly becomes a
slippery slope that slides into a toxic cesspool
we'd rather avoid.
Furthermore, trying hard rather than rely
ing on innate ability is just plain good for us.
Struggle, to paraphrase Kanye, makes us
stronger. As I've climbed up the academic
ladder. I've reached a point where there are
no longer any easy A's without many inti
mate evenings with my textbooks. Increas
ingly, as I wage a difficult battle against my
coursework, 1 find more relevance in the
memories of the painful intensity of high
school running than in those of the easy bore
dom of high school academics. Resilience has
become much more valuable than talent, and
learning to be okay with myself even when
things go awry is the only way I maintain any
will to forge ahead. In the long run,effortless
success makes us happy but offers little po
tential for growth. In contrast, the experience
ot trying too hard (and failing) is what really
prepares us for the inevitable chaos that
modernity has in store for us.

C aitlin still feels jittery when she catches a whiff
of that rubbery track smell, and she welcomes
commiseration from other former mediocre
high school runners at niltiac@stanford.edu.
