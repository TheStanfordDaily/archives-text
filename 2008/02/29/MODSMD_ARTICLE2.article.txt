In 1975, 86 students graduated with
an undergraduate degree in communi
cation— a handful fewer than the KM)
undergraduates who graduated with
engineering degrees. In 2007, the num
ber of undergraduate degrees con
ferred in engineering outnumbered
those in communication almost tenfold
— 334 as compared to 36.
Over the years, some departments
have changed more than others: mathe
matics averaged eight majors during the
1990's but has averaged 40 since 2002.
Biological sciences and human biology,
however, have maintained stable levels
— around 150 to 160 degrees — since
1985.
Professors suggested a variety of
causes for these shifts — depicted in
annual degree conferral data from the
last quarter-century — citing elements
from the dot-com boom to chance fac
tors.
External forces
Many professors pointed to external

political and economic factors as cen
tral in student decision making.
"When the economy goes sour, stu
dents move away from 'softer majors'
such as those in the humanities, with
about a two-year lag," said History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, who has been at
Stanford since 1965.
The "dot-com boom" brought annu
al computer science (CS) majors to an
average of 139 between 2000 and 2003,
compared to an average of 59 in the
preceding decade.
"During this period, there were
some students who did it because they
would have done it anyway and they
love computer science," said Mehran
Sahami, associate chair for undergradu
ate education in the CS department.
"Others did it because they thought it
was a way of getting wealthy quickly.
The factor that seems to be most highly
correlated [to the number of majors]
once students get here seems to be what
they believe the economic outlook is."
Symbolic Systems (SymSys)
Director Ivan Sag attributed changes in
the symbolic systems program to an
economic boom as well.
"IT thrives on SymSys grads and
when we graduated 50 per year it was a
blip due to the boom, with subsequent
drop due in part to the bust," Sag said.
Sahami compared the number of

students declaring the CS major at
Stanford over the last 14 years with the
NASDAQ composite index, shifting the
number of declarations by six months
to account for time lag.
"If you put these on top of each
other, it's kind of astounding how well
these two track each other," he said,
pointing to the .6 correlation.
The data from 1993 to 2003, howev
er, has a .88 correlation; after 2003, the
graphs diverge, as the number of majors
decreased more rapidly than the NAS
DAQ index.
"2003 was around the time all the
news stories started appearing about
job off-shoring," Sahami said, adding
that this perception, though incorrect,
had a significant influence.
According to Dick Luthy, chair of
civil engineering, student understanding
of events since the dot-com boom has
also affected the number of civil engi
neering majors.
"Things like Enron, 9/11, the prob
lems with [Hurricane] Katrina, the
problems of our inner cities, the global
climate problems," Luthy said, "all of
that has resulted in students looking
back and thinking, 'Well, I'd rather
make the world a better place for peo
ple.'"
"In the early and mid-90's there
was much undergraduate interest in
civil engineering, which then waned
in the dot-com heyday," he contin
ued. "Now student interest is coming
back. Undergraduates today seem
more altruistic, desiring careers that
will help make the world a better and
safer place."
The number of international rela
tions majors, too. has risen and fallen
over the past quarter-century, reach
ing hitihs of 146 in 1988 anil 120 in
2003.
These trends map predictably to
international events, said chair ken
Schultz.
"It was high at the end of the Cold
War, dropped in the 19905, spiked
right after 9/11 and now appears to
have stabilized at a higher level than
before 2001." he said.
The economics department aver
aged 228 graduates between 1985
and 1991 and 168 graduates between
2002 and 2007.
Mordecai Kurz. economics direc
tor of undergraduate study, acknowl
edged some variation but denied that
the number of economics majors had
changed significantly.
"The composition of our gradu
ates has fluctuated as the external
factors have varied," Kurz said. "One
cannot make trends out of such fluc
tuations since they vary with the
issues which are of concern to our
society and to our students."
Swayed by chance factors
Aside from political and econom
ic forces, professors suggested that
students may be influenced by other
factors not directly tied to curricular
structure or pure intellectual interest.
"Mathematical subjects go
through phases of ups and downs."
said Brad Efron, chair of mathemati
cal and computational sciences
(MC"S). "You can't predict how these
things go. 1 never could figure out
why suddenly there are a lot of stu
dents or not many."
When the number of symbolic
systems graduates in 1997 more than
doubled from 1996. Todd Davies.
associate director of symbolic sys
tems, asked alumni why they thought
this happened.
"One of them told me that the
main student speaker at their frosh
convocation had been a very engag
ing symbolic systems major and that
she raved about our program," he
said. "So it might be that many stu
dents make their decisions based
partly on events like that."
Both Davies and Brian Wandell,
chair of the psychology department,
suggested that variation might also
be related to factors such as whether
an introductory course is taught by a
popular lecturer in a given year.
"We don't fully understand these
fluctuations," Wandell said. "Psych 1
had many people one year when
[Psychology Professor Emeritus]
Phil Zimbardo taught it.Then it went
down, and now it's back up again."
In addition to classes, entire
majors can be affected by shifting
student perceptions.
"CS is perceived as a hard major,"
said Bill Dally, CS department chair.
"This leads many students to major
in symbolic systems or MCS, both of
which require many of our courses
but are perceived as easier."
Because undergraduate admission.

unlike graduate admission, is largely
beyond a department's control.
Electrical Engineering (EE) Chair
Bruce Wooley acknowledged that
numbers are somewhat dependent on
the interests of admitted students.
"Among domestic students, engi
neering doesn't look as attractive or
as exciting as it should." he said. "I
think it's viewed as being hard. It's
quantitative, and in that sense it is
hard. But 1 don't think it's beyond
the capabilities of most or all of the
students who are admitted here. If it
looks too hard for them, however,
then that may be our fault."
DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES
A number of departments, includ
ing CS. physics, mathematics and IR.
have revised their curriculum in
recent years to offer more flexibility
to majors, and department represen
tatives expect that these changes will
positively impact the number of
majors.
"It wasn't in response to looking
at any numbers," Schultz said of
changes to economics requirements
in the IR major. "The change was in
response to a sense that the status
quo was unsustainable."
Wooley said that the EE depart
ment, concerned about the drop in
majors during the 1990s — from 125
in 1985 to 35 in 1997 — made several
changes to make the EE major more
appealing to undergraduates. These
changes included more flexibility in
upper division courses and an
increased involvement in the intro
ductory seminar program.
Engineering typically has many
math and science prerequisites for
first and second year students, and
Wooley said this "delayed gratifica
tion" has motivated his department
to create attractive courses for fresh
men and think about restructuring
the first two years.
"1 think that's the key — to figure
out how to get more freshmen
exposed to it without intimidating
them or making them do 20 hours of
work a week per four or five unit
course." he said.
Although Bernstein attributed
general trends to business cycles, he
emphasized that departmental activ
ities can make a difference.
"Even in a cyclical system, there's
some tug within where the people
go," he said, noting that students
deciding between history and. for
example, American studies, political
science or English could often move
in several directions. If one wanted to
improve the number of students in a
particular major, Bernstein added,
good freshman advising would be the
key.
Pat Burchat, chair of the physics
department, added that her depart
ment is trying to do more effective
pre-major advising, and Rafe
Mazzeo, chair of the mathematics
department, emphasized the publici
ty his department has done about the
value of a degree in mathematics.
Implications of trends
Departments that by and large do
not teach their own courses, such as
MCS and IR.say that changing num
bers have not affected the program.
Even for departments that do teach
their own courses, professors empha
sized the salience of overall course
enrollment rather than major decla
rations.
As many students in the introduc
tory sequences of psychology, CS and
mathematics are non-majors, enroll
ment has increased slightly with

declared major increases, but not
substantially.
"I wouldn't say that we alter our
courses based on the number of
majors as much as the number of
people that want to take them,
majors or not," Wandell said.
Wandell recalled the mid-19905,
when the number of psychology
majors hit a high.
"I was here, and 1 think we
noticed that our classes were a little
bit fuller, but surely it didn't have any
financial impact on us," he said.
According to Luthy, fluctuating
undergraduate levels lead to slightly
more or less money for teaching
assistant support in civil engineering,
which has a very large graduate pro
gram in comparison to its undergrad
uate program.
"Small changes or growing from
20 to 40 undergrads is good and we
certainly want that," he said. "But it
doesn't affect our budget in a big
way."
Though department finances are
not always impacted by enrollment
changes, programs may be affected in
other ways.
"Classes before the increase
would be 150 students and after
wards would be 300," Sahami said
regarding the increase in CS majors.
"That just creates logistical issues.
There's a different dynamic in the
class and we need to hire more staff."
Mazzeo said that due to enroll
ment increases, some classes have to
be offered more frequently and oth
ers might enroll more students.
"The sizes are such that they're a
bit malleable," he said. "Now there
might be 20 students where there
used to be 10, so that's not disas
trous."
According to Miizzeo. the number
of mathematics faculty has remained
relatively stable, with essentially no
increase in senior faculty. To accom
modate increasing enrollment and
maintain small classes, the depart
ment acquired funding from the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
for calculus instructors in the lower
level calculus series.
A threefold increase in MCS
majors over the past decade has
impacted departmental advising as
well. If the number of students in the
program doubled. Efron said. MCS
would have to hire more faculty.
"The present size is about as big
as we can handle comfortably." he
said.
Burchat said that the biggest
impact from increasing numbers of
physics majors has been on interme
diate laboratory classes. Increased
enrollment in these equipment
intensive classes led the department
to purchase more set-ups and offer
classes during multiple quarters each
year.
As the number of graduating
physics majors has doubled over the
past four years. Burchat also pointed
to a heavier advising load.
"We don't really consider that a
problem." she said. "In general we
like to see more majors. We'd like to
increase the number even further.
It's hard to predict, but I think we can
keep increasing the numbers."
DOES THIS MATTER?
"I will not in any way proselytize
students," Bernstein said, adding that
he was "not the least bit concerned"
about declining numbers, as long as
students ended up in the right intel
lectual place.
According to Sahami, the CS
department pays attention to major

declaration statistics to understand
what information students are using
to make their decisions.
"We're not just trying to increase
the numbers in CS — we want stu
dents to make a decision based on
accurate information," he said.
Yet Sahami added that a sharp
decrease in the number of majors
would be cause for concern.
"With Stanford as a leading insti
tution in the high tech sector, if we're
not producing those kinds of leaders
at the same rate that we used to, in
the long term that's going to have an
impact," he said. "We want to make
sure that computer science is a field
going forward and that the innova
tion it spurs is healthy."
Declines in the number of EE
majors influenced the department,
which had historically focused on
producing Ph.D.s, to pay closer atten
tion to undergraduates over the last
decade, said Wooley.
"The decline really worried us,"
he said. "All of a sudden, was [the
number of undergraduate majors]
just going to disappear?"
Eight majors — biological sci
ences, economics, English, history,
human biology, international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy — comprise a large share of
undergraduate majors and. as a
group, have declined since at least
1985. During this period, programs
introduced included computer sci
ence in 1987, science, technology and
society in 1994 and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity in 1998.
From 1985 to 1999, the proportion
of undergraduate degrees conferred
in the aforementioned eight majors
was between 57 and 60 percent. Since
2(XX). however, the proportion has
hovered between 48 and 53 percent.

Yet Sahami added that a sharp
decrease in the number of majors
would be cause for concern.
"With Stanford as a leading insti
tution in the high tech sector, if we're
not producing those kinds of leaders
at the same rate that we used to, in
the long term that's going to have an
impact," he said. "We want to make
sure that computer science is a field
going forward and that the innova
tion it spurs is healthy."
Declines in the number of EE
majors influenced the department,
which had historically focused on
producing Ph.D.s, to pay closer atten
tion to undergraduates over the last
decade, said Wooley.
"The decline really worried us,"
he said. "All of a sudden, was [the
number of undergraduate majors]
just going to disappear?"
Eight majors — biological sci
ences, economics, English, history,
human biology, international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy — comprise a large share of
undergraduate majors and. as a
group, have declined since at least
1985. During this period, programs
introduced included computer sci
ence in 1987, science, technology and
society in 1994 and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity in 1998.
From 1985 to 1999, the proportion
of undergraduate degrees conferred
in the aforementioned eight majors
was between 57 and 60 percent. Since
2(XX). however, the proportion has
hovered between 48 and 53 percent.

In 1975, 86 students graduated with
an undergraduate degree in communi
cation— a handful fewer than the KM)
undergraduates who graduated with
engineering degrees. In 2007, the num
ber of undergraduate degrees con
ferred in engineering outnumbered
those in communication almost tenfold
— 334 as compared to 36.
Over the years, some departments
have changed more than others: mathe
matics averaged eight majors during the
1990's but has averaged 40 since 2002.
Biological sciences and human biology,
however, have maintained stable levels
— around 150 to 160 degrees — since
1985.
Professors suggested a variety of
causes for these shifts — depicted in
annual degree conferral data from the
last quarter-century — citing elements
from the dot-com boom to chance fac
tors.
External forces
Many professors pointed to external

political and economic factors as cen
tral in student decision making.
"When the economy goes sour, stu
dents move away from 'softer majors'
such as those in the humanities, with
about a two-year lag," said History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, who has been at
Stanford since 1965.
The "dot-com boom" brought annu
al computer science (CS) majors to an
average of 139 between 2000 and 2003,
compared to an average of 59 in the
preceding decade.
"During this period, there were
some students who did it because they
would have done it anyway and they
love computer science," said Mehran
Sahami, associate chair for undergradu
ate education in the CS department.
"Others did it because they thought it
was a way of getting wealthy quickly.
The factor that seems to be most highly
correlated [to the number of majors]
once students get here seems to be what
they believe the economic outlook is."
Symbolic Systems (SymSys)
Director Ivan Sag attributed changes in
the symbolic systems program to an
economic boom as well.
"IT thrives on SymSys grads and
when we graduated 50 per year it was a
blip due to the boom, with subsequent
drop due in part to the bust," Sag said.
Sahami compared the number of

students declaring the CS major at
Stanford over the last 14 years with the
NASDAQ composite index, shifting the
number of declarations by six months
to account for time lag.
"If you put these on top of each
other, it's kind of astounding how well
these two track each other," he said,
pointing to the .6 correlation.
The data from 1993 to 2003, howev
er, has a .88 correlation; after 2003, the
graphs diverge, as the number of majors
decreased more rapidly than the NAS
DAQ index.
"2003 was around the time all the
news stories started appearing about
job off-shoring," Sahami said, adding
that this perception, though incorrect,
had a significant influence.
According to Dick Luthy, chair of
civil engineering, student understanding
of events since the dot-com boom has
also affected the number of civil engi
neering majors.
"Things like Enron, 9/11, the prob
lems with [Hurricane] Katrina, the
problems of our inner cities, the global
climate problems," Luthy said, "all of
that has resulted in students looking
back and thinking, 'Well, I'd rather
make the world a better place for peo
ple.'"
"In the early and mid-90's there
was much undergraduate interest in
civil engineering, which then waned
in the dot-com heyday," he contin
ued. "Now student interest is coming
back. Undergraduates today seem
more altruistic, desiring careers that
will help make the world a better and
safer place."
The number of international rela
tions majors, too. has risen and fallen
over the past quarter-century, reach
ing hitihs of 146 in 1988 anil 120 in
2003.
These trends map predictably to
international events, said chair ken
Schultz.
"It was high at the end of the Cold
War, dropped in the 19905, spiked
right after 9/11 and now appears to
have stabilized at a higher level than
before 2001." he said.
The economics department aver
aged 228 graduates between 1985
and 1991 and 168 graduates between
2002 and 2007.
Mordecai Kurz. economics direc
tor of undergraduate study, acknowl
edged some variation but denied that
the number of economics majors had
changed significantly.
"The composition of our gradu
ates has fluctuated as the external
factors have varied," Kurz said. "One
cannot make trends out of such fluc
tuations since they vary with the
issues which are of concern to our
society and to our students."
Swayed by chance factors
Aside from political and econom
ic forces, professors suggested that
students may be influenced by other
factors not directly tied to curricular
structure or pure intellectual interest.
"Mathematical subjects go
through phases of ups and downs."
said Brad Efron, chair of mathemati
cal and computational sciences
(MC"S). "You can't predict how these
things go. 1 never could figure out
why suddenly there are a lot of stu
dents or not many."
When the number of symbolic
systems graduates in 1997 more than
doubled from 1996. Todd Davies.
associate director of symbolic sys
tems, asked alumni why they thought
this happened.
"One of them told me that the
main student speaker at their frosh
convocation had been a very engag
ing symbolic systems major and that
she raved about our program," he
said. "So it might be that many stu
dents make their decisions based
partly on events like that."
Both Davies and Brian Wandell,
chair of the psychology department,
suggested that variation might also
be related to factors such as whether
an introductory course is taught by a
popular lecturer in a given year.
"We don't fully understand these
fluctuations," Wandell said. "Psych 1
had many people one year when
[Psychology Professor Emeritus]
Phil Zimbardo taught it.Then it went
down, and now it's back up again."
In addition to classes, entire
majors can be affected by shifting
student perceptions.
"CS is perceived as a hard major,"
said Bill Dally, CS department chair.
"This leads many students to major
in symbolic systems or MCS, both of
which require many of our courses
but are perceived as easier."
Because undergraduate admission.

unlike graduate admission, is largely
beyond a department's control.
Electrical Engineering (EE) Chair
Bruce Wooley acknowledged that
numbers are somewhat dependent on
the interests of admitted students.
"Among domestic students, engi
neering doesn't look as attractive or
as exciting as it should." he said. "I
think it's viewed as being hard. It's
quantitative, and in that sense it is
hard. But 1 don't think it's beyond
the capabilities of most or all of the
students who are admitted here. If it
looks too hard for them, however,
then that may be our fault."
DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES
A number of departments, includ
ing CS. physics, mathematics and IR.
have revised their curriculum in
recent years to offer more flexibility
to majors, and department represen
tatives expect that these changes will
positively impact the number of
majors.
"It wasn't in response to looking
at any numbers," Schultz said of
changes to economics requirements
in the IR major. "The change was in
response to a sense that the status
quo was unsustainable."
Wooley said that the EE depart
ment, concerned about the drop in
majors during the 1990s — from 125
in 1985 to 35 in 1997 — made several
changes to make the EE major more
appealing to undergraduates. These
changes included more flexibility in
upper division courses and an
increased involvement in the intro
ductory seminar program.
Engineering typically has many
math and science prerequisites for
first and second year students, and
Wooley said this "delayed gratifica
tion" has motivated his department
to create attractive courses for fresh
men and think about restructuring
the first two years.
"1 think that's the key — to figure
out how to get more freshmen
exposed to it without intimidating
them or making them do 20 hours of
work a week per four or five unit
course." he said.
Although Bernstein attributed
general trends to business cycles, he
emphasized that departmental activ
ities can make a difference.
"Even in a cyclical system, there's
some tug within where the people
go," he said, noting that students
deciding between history and. for
example, American studies, political
science or English could often move
in several directions. If one wanted to
improve the number of students in a
particular major, Bernstein added,
good freshman advising would be the
key.
Pat Burchat, chair of the physics
department, added that her depart
ment is trying to do more effective
pre-major advising, and Rafe
Mazzeo, chair of the mathematics
department, emphasized the publici
ty his department has done about the
value of a degree in mathematics.
Implications of trends
Departments that by and large do
not teach their own courses, such as
MCS and IR.say that changing num
bers have not affected the program.
Even for departments that do teach
their own courses, professors empha
sized the salience of overall course
enrollment rather than major decla
rations.
As many students in the introduc
tory sequences of psychology, CS and
mathematics are non-majors, enroll
ment has increased slightly with

declared major increases, but not
substantially.
"I wouldn't say that we alter our
courses based on the number of
majors as much as the number of
people that want to take them,
majors or not," Wandell said.
Wandell recalled the mid-19905,
when the number of psychology
majors hit a high.
"I was here, and 1 think we
noticed that our classes were a little
bit fuller, but surely it didn't have any
financial impact on us," he said.
According to Luthy, fluctuating
undergraduate levels lead to slightly
more or less money for teaching
assistant support in civil engineering,
which has a very large graduate pro
gram in comparison to its undergrad
uate program.
"Small changes or growing from
20 to 40 undergrads is good and we
certainly want that," he said. "But it
doesn't affect our budget in a big
way."
Though department finances are
not always impacted by enrollment
changes, programs may be affected in
other ways.
"Classes before the increase
would be 150 students and after
wards would be 300," Sahami said
regarding the increase in CS majors.
"That just creates logistical issues.
There's a different dynamic in the
class and we need to hire more staff."
Mazzeo said that due to enroll
ment increases, some classes have to
be offered more frequently and oth
ers might enroll more students.
"The sizes are such that they're a
bit malleable," he said. "Now there
might be 20 students where there
used to be 10, so that's not disas
trous."
According to Miizzeo. the number
of mathematics faculty has remained
relatively stable, with essentially no
increase in senior faculty. To accom
modate increasing enrollment and
maintain small classes, the depart
ment acquired funding from the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
for calculus instructors in the lower
level calculus series.
A threefold increase in MCS
majors over the past decade has
impacted departmental advising as
well. If the number of students in the
program doubled. Efron said. MCS
would have to hire more faculty.
"The present size is about as big
as we can handle comfortably." he
said.
Burchat said that the biggest
impact from increasing numbers of
physics majors has been on interme
diate laboratory classes. Increased
enrollment in these equipment
intensive classes led the department
to purchase more set-ups and offer
classes during multiple quarters each
year.
As the number of graduating
physics majors has doubled over the
past four years. Burchat also pointed
to a heavier advising load.
"We don't really consider that a
problem." she said. "In general we
like to see more majors. We'd like to
increase the number even further.
It's hard to predict, but I think we can
keep increasing the numbers."
DOES THIS MATTER?
"I will not in any way proselytize
students," Bernstein said, adding that
he was "not the least bit concerned"
about declining numbers, as long as
students ended up in the right intel
lectual place.
According to Sahami, the CS
department pays attention to major

declaration statistics to understand
what information students are using
to make their decisions.
"We're not just trying to increase
the numbers in CS — we want stu
dents to make a decision based on
accurate information," he said.
Yet Sahami added that a sharp
decrease in the number of majors
would be cause for concern.
"With Stanford as a leading insti
tution in the high tech sector, if we're
not producing those kinds of leaders
at the same rate that we used to, in
the long term that's going to have an
impact," he said. "We want to make
sure that computer science is a field
going forward and that the innova
tion it spurs is healthy."
Declines in the number of EE
majors influenced the department,
which had historically focused on
producing Ph.D.s, to pay closer atten
tion to undergraduates over the last
decade, said Wooley.
"The decline really worried us,"
he said. "All of a sudden, was [the
number of undergraduate majors]
just going to disappear?"
Eight majors — biological sci
ences, economics, English, history,
human biology, international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy — comprise a large share of

1985. During this period, programs
introduced included computer sci
ence in 1987, science, technology and
society in 1994 and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity in 1998.
From 1985 to 1999, the proportion
of undergraduate degrees conferred
in the aforementioned eight majors
was between 57 and 60 percent. Since
2(XX). however, the proportion has
hovered between 48 and 53 percent.

for calculus instructors in the lower
level calculus series.
A threefold increase in MCS
majors over the past decade has
impacted departmental advising as
well. If the number of students in the
program doubled. Efron said. MCS
would have to hire more faculty.
"The present size is about as big
as we can handle comfortably." he
said.
Burchat said that the biggest
impact from increasing numbers of
physics majors has been on interme
diate laboratory classes. Increased
enrollment in these equipment
intensive classes led the department
to purchase more set-ups and offer
classes during multiple quarters each
year.
As the number of graduating
physics majors has doubled over the
past four years. Burchat also pointed
to a heavier advising load.
"We don't really consider that a
problem." she said. "In general we
like to see more majors. We'd like to
increase the number even further.
It's hard to predict, but I think we can
keep increasing the numbers."
DOES THIS MATTER?
"I will not in any way proselytize
students," Bernstein said, adding that
he was "not the least bit concerned"
about declining numbers, as long as
students ended up in the right intel
lectual place.
According to Sahami, the CS
department pays attention to major

declaration statistics to understand
what information students are using
to make their decisions.
"We're not just trying to increase
the numbers in CS — we want stu
dents to make a decision based on
accurate information," he said.
Yet Sahami added that a sharp
decrease in the number of majors
would be cause for concern.
"With Stanford as a leading insti
tution in the high tech sector, if we're
not producing those kinds of leaders
at the same rate that we used to, in
the long term that's going to have an
impact," he said. "We want to make
sure that computer science is a field
going forward and that the innova
tion it spurs is healthy."
Declines in the number of EE
majors influenced the department,
which had historically focused on
producing Ph.D.s, to pay closer atten
tion to undergraduates over the last
decade, said Wooley.
"The decline really worried us,"
he said. "All of a sudden, was [the
number of undergraduate majors]
just going to disappear?"
Eight majors — biological sci
ences, economics, English, history,
human biology, international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy — comprise a large share of
undergraduate majors and. as a
group, have declined since at least
1985. During this period, programs
introduced included computer sci
ence in 1987, science, technology and
society in 1994 and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity in 1998.
From 1985 to 1999, the proportion
of undergraduate degrees conferred
in the aforementioned eight majors
was between 57 and 60 percent. Since
2(XX). however, the proportion has
hovered between 48 and 53 percent.

In 1975, 86 students graduated with
an undergraduate degree in communi
cation— a handful fewer than the KM)
undergraduates who graduated with
engineering degrees. In 2007, the num
ber of undergraduate degrees con
ferred in engineering outnumbered
those in communication almost tenfold
— 334 as compared to 36.
Over the years, some departments
have changed more than others: mathe
matics averaged eight majors during the
1990's but has averaged 40 since 2002.
Biological sciences and human biology,
however, have maintained stable levels
— around 150 to 160 degrees — since
1985.
Professors suggested a variety of
causes for these shifts — depicted in
annual degree conferral data from the
last quarter-century — citing elements
from the dot-com boom to chance fac
tors.
External forces
Many professors pointed to external

political and economic factors as cen
tral in student decision making.
"When the economy goes sour, stu
dents move away from 'softer majors'
such as those in the humanities, with
about a two-year lag," said History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, who has been at
Stanford since 1965.
The "dot-com boom" brought annu
al computer science (CS) majors to an
average of 139 between 2000 and 2003,
compared to an average of 59 in the
preceding decade.
"During this period, there were
some students who did it because they
would have done it anyway and they
love computer science," said Mehran
Sahami, associate chair for undergradu
ate education in the CS department.
"Others did it because they thought it
was a way of getting wealthy quickly.
The factor that seems to be most highly
correlated [to the number of majors]
once students get here seems to be what
they believe the economic outlook is."
Symbolic Systems (SymSys)
Director Ivan Sag attributed changes in
the symbolic systems program to an
economic boom as well.
"IT thrives on SymSys grads and
when we graduated 50 per year it was a
blip due to the boom, with subsequent
drop due in part to the bust," Sag said.
Sahami compared the number of

students declaring the CS major at
Stanford over the last 14 years with the
NASDAQ composite index, shifting the
number of declarations by six months
to account for time lag.
"If you put these on top of each
other, it's kind of astounding how well
these two track each other," he said,
pointing to the .6 correlation.
The data from 1993 to 2003, howev
er, has a .88 correlation; after 2003, the
graphs diverge, as the number of majors
decreased more rapidly than the NAS
DAQ index.
"2003 was around the time all the
news stories started appearing about
job off-shoring," Sahami said, adding
that this perception, though incorrect,
had a significant influence.
According to Dick Luthy, chair of
civil engineering, student understanding
of events since the dot-com boom has
also affected the number of civil engi
neering majors.
"Things like Enron, 9/11, the prob
lems with [Hurricane] Katrina, the
problems of our inner cities, the global
climate problems," Luthy said, "all of
that has resulted in students looking
back and thinking, 'Well, I'd rather
make the world a better place for peo
ple.'"
"In the early and mid-90's there
was much undergraduate interest in
civil engineering, which then waned
in the dot-com heyday," he contin
ued. "Now student interest is coming
back. Undergraduates today seem
more altruistic, desiring careers that
will help make the world a better and
safer place."
The number of international rela
tions majors, too. has risen and fallen
over the past quarter-century, reach
ing hitihs of 146 in 1988 anil 120 in
2003.
These trends map predictably to
international events, said chair ken
Schultz.
"It was high at the end of the Cold
War, dropped in the 19905, spiked
right after 9/11 and now appears to
have stabilized at a higher level than
before 2001." he said.
The economics department aver
aged 228 graduates between 1985
and 1991 and 168 graduates between
2002 and 2007.
Mordecai Kurz. economics direc
tor of undergraduate study, acknowl
edged some variation but denied that
the number of economics majors had
changed significantly.
"The composition of our gradu
ates has fluctuated as the external
factors have varied," Kurz said. "One
cannot make trends out of such fluc
tuations since they vary with the
issues which are of concern to our
society and to our students."
Swayed by chance factors
Aside from political and econom
ic forces, professors suggested that
students may be influenced by other
factors not directly tied to curricular
structure or pure intellectual interest.
"Mathematical subjects go
through phases of ups and downs."
said Brad Efron, chair of mathemati
cal and computational sciences
(MC"S). "You can't predict how these
things go. 1 never could figure out
why suddenly there are a lot of stu
dents or not many."
When the number of symbolic
systems graduates in 1997 more than
doubled from 1996. Todd Davies.
associate director of symbolic sys
tems, asked alumni why they thought
this happened.
"One of them told me that the
main student speaker at their frosh
convocation had been a very engag
ing symbolic systems major and that
she raved about our program," he
said. "So it might be that many stu
dents make their decisions based
partly on events like that."
Both Davies and Brian Wandell,
chair of the psychology department,
suggested that variation might also
be related to factors such as whether
an introductory course is taught by a
popular lecturer in a given year.
"We don't fully understand these
fluctuations," Wandell said. "Psych 1
had many people one year when
[Psychology Professor Emeritus]
Phil Zimbardo taught it.Then it went
down, and now it's back up again."
In addition to classes, entire
majors can be affected by shifting
student perceptions.
"CS is perceived as a hard major,"
said Bill Dally, CS department chair.
"This leads many students to major
in symbolic systems or MCS, both of
which require many of our courses
but are perceived as easier."
Because undergraduate admission.

unlike graduate admission, is largely
beyond a department's control.
Electrical Engineering (EE) Chair
Bruce Wooley acknowledged that
numbers are somewhat dependent on
the interests of admitted students.
"Among domestic students, engi
neering doesn't look as attractive or
as exciting as it should." he said. "I
think it's viewed as being hard. It's
quantitative, and in that sense it is
hard. But 1 don't think it's beyond
the capabilities of most or all of the
students who are admitted here. If it
looks too hard for them, however,
then that may be our fault."
DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES
A number of departments, includ
ing CS. physics, mathematics and IR.
have revised their curriculum in
recent years to offer more flexibility
to majors, and department represen
tatives expect that these changes will
positively impact the number of
majors.
"It wasn't in response to looking
at any numbers," Schultz said of
changes to economics requirements
in the IR major. "The change was in
response to a sense that the status
quo was unsustainable."
Wooley said that the EE depart
ment, concerned about the drop in
majors during the 1990s — from 125
in 1985 to 35 in 1997 — made several
changes to make the EE major more
appealing to undergraduates. These
changes included more flexibility in
upper division courses and an
increased involvement in the intro
ductory seminar program.
Engineering typically has many
math and science prerequisites for
first and second year students, and
Wooley said this "delayed gratifica
tion" has motivated his department
to create attractive courses for fresh
men and think about restructuring
the first two years.
"1 think that's the key — to figure
out how to get more freshmen
exposed to it without intimidating
them or making them do 20 hours of
work a week per four or five unit
course." he said.
Although Bernstein attributed
general trends to business cycles, he
emphasized that departmental activ
ities can make a difference.
"Even in a cyclical system, there's
some tug within where the people
go," he said, noting that students
deciding between history and. for
example, American studies, political
science or English could often move
in several directions. If one wanted to
improve the number of students in a
particular major, Bernstein added,
good freshman advising would be the
key.
Pat Burchat, chair of the physics
department, added that her depart
ment is trying to do more effective
pre-major advising, and Rafe
Mazzeo, chair of the mathematics
department, emphasized the publici
ty his department has done about the
value of a degree in mathematics.
Implications of trends
Departments that by and large do
not teach their own courses, such as
MCS and IR.say that changing num
bers have not affected the program.
Even for departments that do teach
their own courses, professors empha
sized the salience of overall course
enrollment rather than major decla
rations.
As many students in the introduc
tory sequences of psychology, CS and
mathematics are non-majors, enroll
ment has increased slightly with

declared major increases, but not
substantially.
"I wouldn't say that we alter our
courses based on the number of
majors as much as the number of
people that want to take them,
majors or not," Wandell said.
Wandell recalled the mid-19905,
when the number of psychology
majors hit a high.
"I was here, and 1 think we
noticed that our classes were a little
bit fuller, but surely it didn't have any
financial impact on us," he said.
According to Luthy, fluctuating
undergraduate levels lead to slightly
more or less money for teaching
assistant support in civil engineering,
which has a very large graduate pro
gram in comparison to its undergrad
uate program.
"Small changes or growing from
20 to 40 undergrads is good and we
certainly want that," he said. "But it
doesn't affect our budget in a big
way."
Though department finances are
not always impacted by enrollment
changes, programs may be affected in
other ways.
"Classes before the increase
would be 150 students and after
wards would be 300," Sahami said
regarding the increase in CS majors.
"That just creates logistical issues.
There's a different dynamic in the
class and we need to hire more staff."
Mazzeo said that due to enroll
ment increases, some classes have to
be offered more frequently and oth
ers might enroll more students.
"The sizes are such that they're a
bit malleable," he said. "Now there
might be 20 students where there
used to be 10, so that's not disas
trous."
According to Miizzeo. the number
of mathematics faculty has remained
relatively stable, with essentially no
increase in senior faculty. To accom
modate increasing enrollment and
maintain small classes, the depart
ment acquired funding from the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
for calculus instructors in the lower
level calculus series.
A threefold increase in MCS
majors over the past decade has
impacted departmental advising as
well. If the number of students in the
program doubled. Efron said. MCS
would have to hire more faculty.
"The present size is about as big
as we can handle comfortably." he
said.
Burchat said that the biggest
impact from increasing numbers of
physics majors has been on interme
diate laboratory classes. Increased
enrollment in these equipment
intensive classes led the department
to purchase more set-ups and offer

year.
As the number of graduating

to a heavier advising load.

noticed that our classes were a little
bit fuller, but surely it didn't have any
financial impact on us," he said.
According to Luthy, fluctuating
undergraduate levels lead to slightly
more or less money for teaching
assistant support in civil engineering,
which has a very large graduate pro
gram in comparison to its undergrad
uate program.
"Small changes or growing from
20 to 40 undergrads is good and we
certainly want that," he said. "But it
doesn't affect our budget in a big
way."
Though department finances are
not always impacted by enrollment
changes, programs may be affected in
other ways.
"Classes before the increase
would be 150 students and after
wards would be 300," Sahami said
regarding the increase in CS majors.
"That just creates logistical issues.
There's a different dynamic in the
class and we need to hire more staff."
Mazzeo said that due to enroll
ment increases, some classes have to
be offered more frequently and oth
ers might enroll more students.
"The sizes are such that they're a
bit malleable," he said. "Now there
might be 20 students where there
used to be 10, so that's not disas
trous."
According to Miizzeo. the number
of mathematics faculty has remained
relatively stable, with essentially no
increase in senior faculty. To accom
modate increasing enrollment and
maintain small classes, the depart
ment acquired funding from the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
for calculus instructors in the lower
level calculus series.
A threefold increase in MCS
majors over the past decade has
impacted departmental advising as
well. If the number of students in the
program doubled. Efron said. MCS
would have to hire more faculty.
"The present size is about as big
as we can handle comfortably." he
said.
Burchat said that the biggest
impact from increasing numbers of
physics majors has been on interme
diate laboratory classes. Increased
enrollment in these equipment
intensive classes led the department
to purchase more set-ups and offer
classes during multiple quarters each
year.
As the number of graduating
physics majors has doubled over the
past four years. Burchat also pointed
to a heavier advising load.
"We don't really consider that a
problem." she said. "In general we
like to see more majors. We'd like to
increase the number even further.
It's hard to predict, but I think we can
keep increasing the numbers."
DOES THIS MATTER?
"I will not in any way proselytize
students," Bernstein said, adding that
he was "not the least bit concerned"
about declining numbers, as long as
students ended up in the right intel
lectual place.
According to Sahami, the CS
department pays attention to major

declaration statistics to understand
what information students are using
to make their decisions.
"We're not just trying to increase
the numbers in CS — we want stu
dents to make a decision based on
accurate information," he said.
Yet Sahami added that a sharp
decrease in the number of majors
would be cause for concern.
"With Stanford as a leading insti
tution in the high tech sector, if we're
not producing those kinds of leaders
at the same rate that we used to, in
the long term that's going to have an
impact," he said. "We want to make
sure that computer science is a field
going forward and that the innova
tion it spurs is healthy."
Declines in the number of EE
majors influenced the department,
which had historically focused on
producing Ph.D.s, to pay closer atten
tion to undergraduates over the last
decade, said Wooley.
"The decline really worried us,"
he said. "All of a sudden, was [the
number of undergraduate majors]
just going to disappear?"
Eight majors — biological sci
ences, economics, English, history,
human biology, international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy — comprise a large share of
undergraduate majors and. as a
group, have declined since at least
1985. During this period, programs
introduced included computer sci
ence in 1987, science, technology and
society in 1994 and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity in 1998.
From 1985 to 1999, the proportion
of undergraduate degrees conferred
in the aforementioned eight majors
was between 57 and 60 percent. Since
2(XX). however, the proportion has
hovered between 48 and 53 percent.
