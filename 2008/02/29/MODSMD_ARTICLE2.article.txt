In 1975, 86 students graduated with
an undergraduate degree in communi
cation— a handful fewer than the KM)
undergraduates who graduated with
engineering degrees. In 2007, the num
ber of undergraduate degrees con
ferred in engineering outnumbered
those in communication almost tenfold
— 334 as compared to 36.
Over the years, some departments
have changed more than others: mathe
matics averaged eight majors during the
1990's but has averaged 40 since 2002.
Biological sciences and human biology,
however, have maintained stable levels
— around 150 to 160 degrees — since
1985.
Professors suggested a variety of
causes for these shifts — depicted in
annual degree conferral data from the
last quarter-century — citing elements
from the dot-com boom to chance fac
tors.
External forces
Many professors pointed to external

political and economic factors as cen
tral in student decision making.
"When the economy goes sour, stu
dents move away from 'softer majors'
such as those in the humanities, with
about a two-year lag," said History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, who has been at
Stanford since 1965.
The "dot-com boom" brought annu
al computer science (CS) majors to an
average of 139 between 2000 and 2003,
compared to an average of 59 in the
preceding decade.
"During this period, there were
some students who did it because they
would have done it anyway and they
love computer science," said Mehran
Sahami, associate chair for undergradu
ate education in the CS department.
"Others did it because they thought it
was a way of getting wealthy quickly.
The factor that seems to be most highly
correlated [to the number of majors]
once students get here seems to be what
they believe the economic outlook is."
Symbolic Systems (SymSys)
Director Ivan Sag attributed changes in
the symbolic systems program to an
economic boom as well.
"IT thrives on SymSys grads and
when we graduated 50 per year it was a
blip due to the boom, with subsequent
drop due in part to the bust," Sag said.
Sahami compared the number of

students declaring the CS major at
Stanford over the last 14 years with the
NASDAQ composite index, shifting the
number of declarations by six months
to account for time lag.
"If you put these on top of each
other, it's kind of astounding how well
these two track each other," he said,
pointing to the .6 correlation.
The data from 1993 to 2003, howev
er, has a .88 correlation; after 2003, the
graphs diverge, as the number of majors
decreased more rapidly than the NAS
DAQ index.
"2003 was around the time all the
news stories started appearing about
job off-shoring," Sahami said, adding
that this perception, though incorrect,
had a significant influence.
According to Dick Luthy, chair of
civil engineering, student understanding
of events since the dot-com boom has
also affected the number of civil engi
neering majors.
"Things like Enron, 9/11, the prob
lems with [Hurricane] Katrina, the
problems of our inner cities, the global
climate problems," Luthy said, "all of
that has resulted in students looking
back and thinking, 'Well, I'd rather
make the world a better place for peo
ple.'"
