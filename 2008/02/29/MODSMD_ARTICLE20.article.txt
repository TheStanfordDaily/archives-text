Diversity not harmful
To the Editor.
WecommendThe Daily's Editorial Board
for recognizing diversity as an important
issue in academia ["The harm of diversity,"
Feb. 27], However, several misconceptions in
the editorial must he addressed.
There is no harm in diversity. Diversity
(racial, ethnic, gender, class and ideological)
is a good that enhances the breadth, depth
and quality of research and teaching by in
creasing the variety of experiences, perspec
tives and scholarly interests among faculty,
graduate students and undergraduates.
The only way that one could say that racial

or gender diversity might be harmful to the
university is to imply that some people, by
virtue of their racial or gendet group associa
tions, might be unqualified to be here.This is
a pernicious and unwarranted assumption,
and, moreover, it demonstrates a dishearten
ing lack of knowledge on the part of The
Daily's Editorial Board about admissions
and hiring procedures here at Stanford.
We teach a course called "Introduction to
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity."
ITie course includes 18 faculty members from
nine departments across two schools who
demonstrate, through their research, that
race and gender have been used throughout
our country's history as the basis for catego
rizing. organizing and excluding people —

often with dire consequences. Decades of so
cial science research documents that race
and gender always "come into the equation"
when people are making decisions about
who to hire, educate, help, discipline, incar
cerate, care about or even just believe —
whether or not people are conscious of how
race and gender affect their decisions. Rather
than moving past race and gender, we should
be aware of the basic ways in which they
shape society and individual experience.
Furthermore, to suggest that "Stanford is
not to blame" for failing to hire a diverse pro
fessoriate or admit a diverse graduate stu
dent body is to profoundly misunderstand
the situation we are in. Diversity will
not happen by itself, and it will not
happen without a concerted effort
on the part of those best situated to
effect social change. Universities as a
whole are powerful mechanisms of
credentialing and upward mobility
in our society.This is why institutions
like Stanford must consciously and
deliberately "do" diversity if we ever
hope to ameliorate racial and gender
inequality in our society.
Since Stanford wants to achieve
educational excellence, it will pay at
tention to the race and gender of its
graduate student applicants and its
faculty job candidates. It will set am
bitious goals for increasing diversity
and encourage students, faculty and
staff to recognize that here at Stan
ford, as in the larger global context,
we are all in this together. Learning
how to create and sustain effective
and diverse communities is perhaps
Stanford's most pressing education
al challenge.

Shame on the Editorial Board
To the Editor.
The Editorial Board of The Stan
ford Daily erred in a recent editorial
("The harm of diversity," Feb. 27], As
though the title of the piece were not
inappropriate and offensive enough,
the editorial content lacks substan
tive research into the solutions advo
cated by the student-led campaign to
improve faculty and graduate stu
dent diversity.
After making the obligatory ac
knowledgement that diversity is a
"noble ideal," Wednesday's article
proceeds to wrongfully assert — in
reference to one of our suggestions
in an op-ed published on Monday —
that "making a department 'account
able' for a lack of diversity is equiva
lent to punishing it for its homoge
nous applicant pool."
Perhaps we should have been
more specific when we called for a

comprehensive plan that included a
way to make departments account
able for their lack of diversity. Never
theless, the Editorial Board's pre
sumption that our calls for accounta
bility would amount to a punitive
measure imposed on academic de
partments at Stanford is inexcusably
misconstrued. We regret that no Ed
itorial Board members emailed us to
ask for clarification on our use of the
word "accountability" before the
Board decided to harp on this aspect
of the op-ed.
In reality, our ideas for accounta
bility cannot fairly be analogized to
punishment. Is it so unconscionable
to ask the Provost to mandate that
there be someone in charge of diver
sity outreach on every graduate ad
missions or faculty search committee
convened at Stanford, or that they be
required to submit formal plans for
increased outreach to women and
minorities? Does it amount to "pun
ishment" to have to undergo training
exercises to help ensure that uncon
scious biases do not factor into selec
tion decisions? Given that very high
ranking administrators have private
ly conceded that some department
chairs care more than others about
outreach, these are all ways of mak
ing departments accountable to their
lack of diversity and are in no wav

"punishment."
We reiterate that our position on
the issue of diversity is one that does
not advocate the admission of a less
qualified woman or underrepresent
ed minority applicant over others
more qualified. We further clarified
our position when we called for "a
more vigorous expansion of typical
applicant pools and greater energy
devoted to attracting underrepre
sented groups to Stanford" in our
op-ed.
We would be remiss to not ad
dress the frustrating title of the edi
torial: "The harm of diversity." The
title is disgusting, and it casts a shad
ow over whatever homage the Edi
torial Board perfunctorily pays to di
versity efforts.
We do not and have never sup
ported quotas throughout our in
volvement in the diversity campaign,
so the Editorial Board's decision to
introduce this term is peculiar at
best. What we do support is the idea
that Stanford must hold itself ac
countable to the high-minded ideals
it has publicly espoused.
