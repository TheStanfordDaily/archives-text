Diversity not harmful
To the Editor.
WecommendThe Daily's Editorial Board
for recognizing diversity as an important
issue in academia ["The harm of diversity,"
Feb. 27], However, several misconceptions in
the editorial must he addressed.
There is no harm in diversity. Diversity
(racial, ethnic, gender, class and ideological)
is a good that enhances the breadth, depth
and quality of research and teaching by in
creasing the variety of experiences, perspec
tives and scholarly interests among faculty,
graduate students and undergraduates.
The only way that one could say that racial

or gender diversity might be harmful to the
university is to imply that some people, by
virtue of their racial or gendet group associa
tions, might be unqualified to be here.This is
a pernicious and unwarranted assumption,
and, moreover, it demonstrates a dishearten
ing lack of knowledge on the part of The
Daily's Editorial Board about admissions
and hiring procedures here at Stanford.
We teach a course called "Introduction to
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity."
ITie course includes 18 faculty members from
nine departments across two schools who
demonstrate, through their research, that
race and gender have been used throughout
our country's history as the basis for catego
rizing. organizing and excluding people —

often with dire consequences. Decades of so
cial science research documents that race
and gender always "come into the equation"
when people are making decisions about
who to hire, educate, help, discipline, incar
cerate, care about or even just believe —
whether or not people are conscious of how
race and gender affect their decisions. Rather
than moving past race and gender, we should
be aware of the basic ways in which they
shape society and individual experience.
Furthermore, to suggest that "Stanford is
not to blame" for failing to hire a diverse pro
fessoriate or admit a diverse graduate stu
dent body is to profoundly misunderstand
