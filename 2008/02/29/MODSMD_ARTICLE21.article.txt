## CLASHING WITH THE TITANS Fullerton pays visit to Farm 
### ERIK ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season may only be one week old and the playoffs distant,
but one of the best teams in the country is already coming to town
to square off against the Cardinal. No. 16 Cal State-Fullerton ar
rives this weekend for a three-game series at Sunken Diamond.
TheTitans got off to a fast start to the season, taking two of three
in their opening weekend at TCU and shutting out Loyola Mary
mount 4-0 at home on Tuesday. Fullerton's pitching has been stel

lar thus far, allowing a
total of just 13 runs in
four games, while its of
fense has produced 24
runs in that same span.
"[Cal State Fuller
ton] is very good," Stan
ford coach Mark Mar
quess said. "When you
play Fullerton, they are
used to winning and
they know how to play.
They may be stronger
some years than others,
but even if they are
young and inexperi
enced. they know how
to play. Fullerton always
plays well."
Ihe Titans certainly

Cal State-Fullerton has

victories in 22 of those

GAME MOTES The Cardinal baseball team
will host a perennially solid Fullerton team
for a three-game series this weekend at
Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal has been
paced by solid pitching so far this year, and
the bats will be looking to catch up this
weekend against the Titans, particularly with
men on base, where Stanford has struggled
to start the year. Saturday's and Sunday's
contests are both slated to start at 1 p.m.

Junior catcher Brent Milleville will take his .364 average to the plate against a perenially tough Fullerfon team this weekend, hoping to start the year hot at the plate.

end of the summer to make the Col
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb, be
fore eventually falling to UC-Irvine. Of
particular interest in this weekend's ac
tion, however. is the 3-0 mark the Titans
earned against the Cardinal in an series
sweep early in the season.
But the Cardinal refuses to allow
the Titans' success its a program con
cern them too much as they prepare for
the weekend and is instead focusing on
its own game.
"We don't focus that much on the
opponent [when we prepare for
games]," said Marquess."[Our focus] is
on what we need to improve to be suc
cessful."
So far this season for the Cardinal,
that would mean getting the bats to de
liver hits more consistently, according
to Marquess.
"We need to do a better job with the
bat." he said. "We can improve on a lot
of things, but we really need to be able
to bunch hits. We don't have a lot of
scoring opportunities throughout the
game. You may not always score, but
you only get a chance to score slx or
seven times a game, so we need to im
prove on [getting hits in those opportu
nities]."
The hits are coming for the Cardi
nal. as seven of its regulars are batting
over .300. hut getting those hits with
men on base has been another matter
all together. Stanford will hope that
starts to happen as junior centerfielder
and perhaps the Cardinal's best return
ing hitter. Sean Ratliff. begins to heat
up after his slow start. Ratliff went hit
less in the opening weekend against
Nebraska before recording his first hit
of the season against St. Mary's on
Monday. On Tuesday, he went 2-3
against Nevada.
But the Cardinal pitching will have
to match up as well — the Titans are
bringing three quality arms with them
to the Farm. On Friday, Stanford junior
Jeremy Bleich (1-0, 0.00 ERA) will
take the hill against Jeff Kaplan (1-0,
J. 18 ERA); Saturday, senior Erik
Davis (0-1,23.62 ERA) duels Fuller
ton 's Cory A rbiso (0-1.1.50 ERA); and
the Sunday contest features Cardinal
sophomore Jeffery Inman (1-0, 2.25
ERA) against Adam Jorgenson (0-0,
6.23 ERA). With the exception of the
southpaw Bleich. all are right-handers.
If history is any indication, Stanford
should feel confident. The teams have
met <S6 times, and the Cardinal holds a
48-3K record against the Titans. But
even more telling is Stanford's 24-11
record when playing Fullerton at
Sunken Diamond. Most of that success
has come recently, as the Marquess
squad has won six straight at the Dia
mond and is 14-1 in the last fifteen
times the Titans have come to call.
The first pitch is scheduled for 5
p.m. today, with the Saturday and Sun
day contests slated to start at 1 p.m.
Tonight is "Pack the Diamond" night,
and all students with IDs will receive
free admission and food.The Saturday
game can be heard on KZSU 90.1 EM,
while the Friday and Sunday contests
will be on KZSU's Internet-only web
streams.
