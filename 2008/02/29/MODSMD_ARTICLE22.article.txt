## Warriors walloped by No. 9 Cardinal, 3-0 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
For the second week in a row, the No. 9
Stanford men's volleyball team followed a
close five-game match with a dominating
sweep. But while the Cardinal split with then
top-ranked BYU last weekend, the team got a
pair of wins over Hawaii this week, following
Wednesday's 3-2 win with a 30-22,30-23,30-25
victory last night.

Powering the Cardinal (12-6, 8-6 MPSF)
past the Rainbow Warriors (6-9,5-7) was soph
omore opposite hitter Evan Romero, who fin
ished with a match-high 20 kills and an as
tounding .692 hitting percentage.
"Evan had a great hitting night," head
coach John Kosty said. "1 actually thought we
could have utilized him even more, but we had
a lot of people playing well tonight. For in
stance, Spencer McLachlin came back and
played really well on the left side for us."

McLachlin, a freshman, finished lied with
junior middle blocker Brandon Williams with
11 kills and also served an ace on match point
to seal the victory, his fourth of the night.
The four Hawaiians on the squad got the
first wins of their careers over their home

GAME NOTES: No. 9 Stanford took its second
match over the Warriors in as many days,
winning 3-0. The Cardinal was led offensive
ly by sophomore Evan Romero, who put forth
a dominant 20 kill effort while hitting .692.
setter Kawika Shoji saw the team
lose to the Rainbow Warriors twice
last season.
Stanford has now won three
matches in a row, including last Sat
urday's victory over BYU. That ties
the longest streak of the Cardinal's
season to date.
"We're getting into a good
groove," Kosty said. "The guys are
really communicating well and play
ing as a team, supporting each other.
It has been a long process because
we have had some injuries along the
way, which don't help the cohesive
ness and team chemistry."
After almost letting it get away
from them on Wednesday, when the
Cardinal won 16-14 in the fifth game,
Stanford put pressure on Hawaii
from the beginning and did not let
up last night.
"I think tonight we played
smarter than we did last night,"
Kosty said. "We had a go-for-it atti
tude last night that created some er
rors for us. I liked how we got after it,
but we've got to make sure that we
are doing it constructively and intel
ligently, playing a good solid game
and not getting overly hyped and
making mental errors. That cost us
some pretty crucial points last
night."
Shoji started things off with an
ace and the Cardinal jumped to a 10-
5 lead to start the match. Stanford
would hold at least a five-point lead
for the rest of the first game until
kills by Romero and McLachlin
ended the game, 30-22.
Stanford kept in control in the
second game, reeling off five straight
points — one kill each by Romero
and Shoji and three by McLachlin.
The Rainbow Warriors pulled within
four twice, but Shoji and Williams

notched kills for a final score of 30-
23 in the second frame.
Hawaii made some lineup
changes in the third game and stayed
with the Cardinal through the first
half of the game, tying the score at
14-all and then taking the lead. Stan
ford took back the lead for good at
21-20 on a Romero kill and McLach
lin served out the game for the 30-25
win and the match sweep.
"The key to our success right now
is just playing simple serving and
passing," Kosty said. "1 thought we
did a really good job of serving them
well and efficiently, and our passing
game withstood some of their tough
serves."
McLachlin led the way with four
aces while Williams and Shoji added
one apiece. On the defensive side of
the ball, Inafuku anchored the Car
dinal, leading all players with 12 digs
with Shoji adding 10 more.
The Cardinal also outblocked
Hawaii, led by Williams and senior
outside hitter Matt Ceran who had
four and three, respectively.
After the pair of wins this week
end. Stanford will not play at home
again until April 4, with four road
matches and a break for final exams
in the upcoming weeks.
Saturday's match in Santa Cruz
will be a rematch against a Banana
Slugs team that the Cardinal swept
at home in January. After that match,
Stanford will visit No. 2 Long Beach.
UC-San Deigo and No. 8 Southern
California.
"I'm sure there are going to be a
couple more bumps along the road
— we are playing some good teams
and they are going to test us," Kosty
said. "So our bench play needs to be
strong [in addition to the starters).
We've got a tough road ahead of us,
but we are playing well and confi
dently. 1 am excited about the rest of
the season."
