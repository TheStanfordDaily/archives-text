### SCOTT BLAND SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After seven weeks of chasing the leaders,
the No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team is
finally back on top of the Pacific 10 Conference
at just the right time.
"We're excited about finishing off the regu
lar conference schedule," Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We're excited to get to the
tournament."
The Cardinal (25-3,14-2 Pac-10) can guar
antee its eighth consecutive regular season title
with a pair of wins on its Northwest road trip
this weekend against sub-.500 Washington and
Washington State.
Stanford pulled even with California after
defeating the Bears last weekend, but the Car
dinal hold first place in the Pac-10 by virtue of
their 2-0 head-to-head record against Cal.
"Our team, in a good way, has not really
been up and down this season." VanDerveer
said. "This (weekend) doesn't feel any differ
ent."
Washington is on tap first, tonight, for the
Cardinal.The Huskies (12-16,7-9) fell victim to
Stanford by a 77-42 score at Maples Pavilion
earlier this season.
"This is going to be a great challenge for our
young team, playing against some of the na
tion's best," Washington coach Tia Jackson
said. "We'll see how we've improved since we
last played them."

GAME NOTES: The No. 7 Stanford women will take to
the road for the final time this regular season as they
travel to the Pacific Northwest to take on the Huskies
and Washington State this weekend. The Cardinal is
fresh off of its hard-fought 60-50 victory over arch
rival Cal, then ranked No. 8 in the nation. Senior
guard Candice Wiggins should have a good chance
to break Lisa Leslie's Pbc-10 career scoring record of
2,414 points, as she cumently stands just 37 points
back. Wiggins is averaging 19.1 points per game this
season.
before dropping one to Arizona State last
weekend, 69-53. But Washington is still all but
assured of finishing the Pac-10 season with a
losing record, as its women will face the top two
teams in the conference this weekend.

points per game, and sophomore guard Sami

Senior guard Cissy Pierce and the Cardinal will look to stay atop the conference standings
this weekend in Washington against the Huskies and Cougars. The Huskies had been on a
roll of late, winning three in a row, before falling 69-53 against Arizona State last weekend.
Emily Florence leads the team in re
hounding with 6.4 boards per game.
Stanford, by contrast, had three
players averaging more points per
game than Washington's leader. Senior
guard Candice Wiggins (19.1 points per
game). sophomore center Jayne Appel
(14.7 points per game) and freshman
forward Kayla Pedersen (12.8 points
per game) lead the Cardinal.
Stanford has had to make up for the
absence of junior forward Jillian 1 lar

stress reaction in her foot, but sopho

percent clip.
The Cardinal, however, is still miss
ing Harmon in the rebounding depart
ment. Appel and Pedersen have com
bined for 17.4 rebounds per game, but
there is a sharp drop off after that on
the stat sheet. Stanford rarely gets out
rebounded, averaging 7.2 boards per
game more than its opponents but Cal
grabbed 10 more rebounds than the
Cardinal last weekend.
Besides Stanford's chase for yet an
other regular season crown and the No.

1 seed for the Pac-10Tournament, the
other major story this weekend is Wig
gins's continued assault on the record
books. I leading into the Washington
game, Wiggins is just 36 points shy of
Lisa Leslie's all-time Pac-10 scoring
record of 2.414 points.
Tip off against the Huskies is sched
uled for 7 p.m. tonight in Seattle, Wash.
