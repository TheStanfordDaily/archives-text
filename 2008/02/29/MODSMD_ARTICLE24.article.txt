son, having posted a 16-1 record with three
wins over nationally-ranked opponents to
open the 2008 campaign.

the way for Stanford offensively, going 2-4
with two runs scored, including a homerun to
lead off the game. Sophomore catcher Rose}
Neill chipped in a pair of hits and two RBI.

its opponents with hot hitting and exceptional
pitching thanks, in large part, to several strong
individual performances.

thus far this season, leading the team in all
three Triple Crown categories. For the year,
she is batting .391 with five homers and 20
RBI. Senior third baseman Michelle Smith is
also off to a stellar start hitting .375 with four
