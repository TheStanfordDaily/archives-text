## Cardinal sends top squad to Pac-10 tourney 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For Stanford wrestling, in this crucial year for
the program, it all comes down to this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference Championships.
The Pac-10 tournament, scheduled to open
Sunday in Eugene, Ore., is the chief factor in de
termining which wrestlers will have the chance to
compete for All-American honors and national
championships at the NCAA Championships in
St. Louis. Mo., March 20-22. But there's also
something more at stake, as the Cardinal (13-4,6-
3 Pac-10) looks to make a statement about just
how far the program has come in recent years.
The Cardinal will have its best chance in recent
memory to make a serious dent in the traditional
Pac-10 pecking order — the team will send an ex
perienced and talented squad to Eugene that has
been building all season for this competition. As
athletes and coaches are fond of repeating often,
it's all just practice' until the conference tourna
ment, which can, of course, be a two-edged sword.
Stanford's best regular season record in three
decades is now. essentially, meaningless in deter
mining how many wrestlers will get their chances
on the national stage.
The Cardinal's rise as a program has been par
ticularly noticeable in recent years — Stanford
athletes have won All-American honors four
times in the last four seasons. And now, for the
first time since the 19605, Stanford has two return
ing All-Americans headed to the conference
tournament in senior No. 6Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds and senior No. 9 Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds. Coupled with promising seasons from
several underclassmen, the impending graduation
of Gardner and Zupancic and their combined
three All-American seasons have lent the 2007-08
Cardinal season a certain air of urgency. While it
may not be 'now or never,' a fair question, given
Stanford's strong mix of talent, would be 'if not
now, when?'
Third year head coach Kerry McCoy has seen
much of the Cardinal's recent rise first-hand, but
he was quick to give plenty of credit to his prede
cessors when asked about his role in the pro
gram's return to relevance on the mat.
"1 always say it's a credit to the guys who were
here before me," he said. "Chris Horpel, who was
a real help to me in my competitive career, laid the
foundation of the program, keeping it alive and
keeping Stanford wrestling on the map. And then
Steve Buddie and those guys ... when they were
here they really started bringing it up. [They
coached j here obviously when Matt Gentry was a
national champion [in 2004], getting the program
to that next level."
"Really what it comes down to is the athletes
themselves," said McCoy after giving still more
credit to his various assistant coaches. "I came in.
