## Cardinal sends top squad to Pac-10 tourney 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
For Stanford wrestling, in this crucial year for
the program, it all comes down to this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference Championships.
The Pac-10 tournament, scheduled to open
Sunday in Eugene, Ore., is the chief factor in de
termining which wrestlers will have the chance to
compete for All-American honors and national
championships at the NCAA Championships in
St. Louis. Mo., March 20-22. But there's also
something more at stake, as the Cardinal (13-4,6-
3 Pac-10) looks to make a statement about just
how far the program has come in recent years.
The Cardinal will have its best chance in recent
memory to make a serious dent in the traditional
Pac-10 pecking order — the team will send an ex
perienced and talented squad to Eugene that has
been building all season for this competition. As
athletes and coaches are fond of repeating often,
it's all just practice' until the conference tourna
ment, which can, of course, be a two-edged sword.
Stanford's best regular season record in three
decades is now. essentially, meaningless in deter
mining how many wrestlers will get their chances
on the national stage.
The Cardinal's rise as a program has been par
ticularly noticeable in recent years — Stanford
athletes have won All-American honors four
times in the last four seasons. And now, for the
first time since the 19605, Stanford has two return
ing All-Americans headed to the conference
tournament in senior No. 6Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds and senior No. 9 Josh Zupancic at 157
pounds. Coupled with promising seasons from
several underclassmen, the impending graduation
of Gardner and Zupancic and their combined
three All-American seasons have lent the 2007-08
Cardinal season a certain air of urgency. While it
may not be 'now or never,' a fair question, given
Stanford's strong mix of talent, would be 'if not
now, when?'
Third year head coach Kerry McCoy has seen
much of the Cardinal's recent rise first-hand, but
he was quick to give plenty of credit to his prede
cessors when asked about his role in the pro
gram's return to relevance on the mat.
"1 always say it's a credit to the guys who were
here before me," he said. "Chris Horpel, who was
a real help to me in my competitive career, laid the
foundation of the program, keeping it alive and
keeping Stanford wrestling on the map. And then
Steve Buddie and those guys ... when they were
here they really started bringing it up. [They
coached j here obviously when Matt Gentry was a
national champion [in 2004], getting the program
to that next level."
"Really what it comes down to is the athletes
themselves," said McCoy after giving still more
credit to his various assistant coaches. "I came in.
1 brought a system in, they bought
into the system and followed
through. And when you have that, if

you ask any of those other coaches
that have been real successful here,
you have a system, have a philoso
phy and the athletes buy into it,
you're going to be successful."
Gardner (35-1) and Zupancic
(33-5) have, expectedly. anchored
the Cardinal lineup this season, with
Gardner needing just one more pin
to match the single season Stanford
record and one win to tie the
school's career victories record. But
contributions have come from near
ly every weight class in making this a
season to remember for the Cardinal
thus far.
Redshirt freshman Lucas Esper
icueta (23-10) at 149 pounds and
sophomore Jake Johnson (24-11) at
197 pounds will each take part in
their first Pac-10 tournament after
strong debut seasons as regular
starters in the Stanford lineup. Ju
nior Luke Feist (13-9) at 174 pounds
overcame an early season injury and

came on strong down the stretch,
winning 10 of his last 12 matches to
earn the second rank in the confer
ence. Sophomore Zach Giesen (22-
8) at 184 pounds has had a solid fol
low-up season to his 2006-07 effort,
which earned him Pac-10 Co-Fresh
man of the Year honors, and has al
ready tallied his 50th career victory.
Senior heavyweight Phil Doerner
(16-19) has more than doubled his
career win total with this season's ef
fort and will look to close out his col
legiate career with a hang.
Rounding out the 10 likely
wrestlers for the Cardinal at the con
ference tournament are freshmen
Porfirio Madrigal (9-10) at 133
pounds. Max Rosefigura (12-13) at
141 pounds and Kyle Barrett (4-4),
who stepped in late in the season for
injured redshirt sophomore Peter
Miller at 165 pounds.They all look to
make strong first impressions on the
conference's biggest stage.
Fans can watch the Cardinal go
for their first ever Pac-10 title start
ing Sunday at 11 a.m. as for the sec
ond straight year matches will be
