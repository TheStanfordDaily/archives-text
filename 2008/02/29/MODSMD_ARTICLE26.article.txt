Several Stanford athletes enter
the competition highly ranked in
their events. Redshirt senior Arianna
Lamhie has the fastest time in the
women's 3000 meter run in the na
tion. Lambie will also be competing
in the mile, where she is ranked sec
ond in the MPSF field. Lambie said
she hopes to improve her mile time
from last week's mark of 4:38 and
score well in both of her events.
"It's my second-to-last competi
tion in Stanford uniform, so I've got
to make it count." Lambie said.
Sophomore Griffin Matthew sits
atop the rankings for the women's 60
meter dash, ahead of Cal's Cherrelle
Garrett and ASU's Charonda
Williams by a mere hundredth of a
second. Freshman Alexandra Gits

holds the top position in the women's
5000 meter run, and Stanford also
possesses the top spot in the
women's distance medley relay. In
the jumping arena, senior Krica
McLain holds the number one posi
tion in the women's long jump.close
ly followed by freshman teammate
Arantxa King. TTie duo of female
jumpers dominates the rankings in
the triple jump as well, as McLain
and King hold the first and second
positions respectively.
On the men's side, the Cardinal
holds notable positions in numerous
events. Junior Myles Bradley has the
number one spot in the men's 60
meter hurdles, with a time of 7.90 sec
onds. In the mile, freshman Garrett
Heath, who had an incredible per
formance two weeks ago on the same
indoor track at which he will com
pete this weekend, will race hard to
retain his first place position at the
MPSF meet. Heath is currently
ranked second in the nation in the
event.
Speaking of the team as a whole.
Heath said. "Our team is using this
meet as another opportunity to try
and get a lot of individual qualifiers
for indoor nationals in two weeks,"
Heath said. "We have a lot of people
right on the brink of making it at this

point, so putting together a strong
performance this weekend at [the
MPSF Championships] will put us in
a great position to do well as team in
nationals."
I leath exemplifies the spirit of the
Cardinal, focusing on individual suc
cesses that bolster the team. Person
ally. he hopes to focus on the distance
medley relay, as three of the runners
on the relay team are seniors hoping
to have a successful final run togeth
er. That relay team, hoping to qualify
for nationals, is currently ranked sec
ond in the MPSF meet.
Senior pole vaulter Graeme
I ioste enters the meet in a first place
position for the event.
"[Mv] first goal is to win [the
event]." Hoste said."But I'm going to
go out there and focus on the few
things we've been working on techni
cally and try to have some fun. Hope
fully that will lead to a good perform
ance."
Following the MPSF Champi
onships the Cardinal will have some
breathing room before the UW Last
Chance Meet on March 8 and the
NCAA Championships in Fayat
teville. Ark., which begin March 14.
