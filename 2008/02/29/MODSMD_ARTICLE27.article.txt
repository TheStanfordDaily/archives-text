# Cardinal almost home free
## No. 6 women look to finish grueling road trip on a winning note in L.A. against Nos. 11 USC and UCLA 
### ABy ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
First, the good news.
The No. 6 Stanford women's tennis team is almost home after an epic
five-game road trip.
Now, the bad.
ITie Cardinal will first have to go through UCLA and Southern Cali
fornia, tied for the No. 11 ranking in the most recent polls.
A week after a stunning loss to then No. 11 California and a Washing
ton sweep, Stanford will head south to Los Angeles to face two power
house Pac-10 rivals, finishing off their five game swing down the Western
seaboard.
"I guarantee you this is the worst month we've ever had." head coach
Lele Forood said. "I don't ever remember a month where we've had to
travel quite like this."
Stanford faces UCLA this afternoon in a rematch of last year's NCAA
semifinal round, where the Bruins ousted Stanford from its attempt at a
fourth consecutive title.
Unfortunately, not much has changed as far as the UCLA roster is con
cerned.
"They're essentially last year's team and they've added one talented
junior player," Forood said. "They're quite a solid team and they haven't
played with quite a full deck since Indoors. I'm not really sure what we'll
see tomorrow with regards to their health but they have a lot of players. [.
.. ] They're pretty solid no matter who they put out there."
Stanford, however, may have the benefit of momentum on its side, as it
will face a UCLA squad mired in a two game losing streak after dropping
a 5-2 decision to No. 4 Baylor.
The Cardinal, which defeated the Bears in the opening rounds of the In
doors, is currently ranked behind them, but that doesn't necessarily bother
Forood.
"I don't think we look at who's ahead of us. [or] who we've beaten,"
Forood said. "It's more of what our points are after losing to #11 .That's just
where we are right now."
On Saturday, Stanford will face the Women of Troy who are looking for
their first win against the Cardinal since April 4.1986.
Led by the 2007 Pac-10 singles champion. Lindsey Nelson, the USC
squad is certainly comparable to a young Stanford team.
"They're a little bit like us right now," Forood said."They're a mix of some
veteran players and two or three freshmen in the lineup. 1 feel they're in the
same boat we are — they're playing well and it's going to be a gtxxJ battle."
And as for the winning streak?
"We haven't lost to them in a long time," Forood said. "But we were on
the road three years ago and [played] our closest match of that year down
there."
For an extra morale boost. Stanford brought its entire squad to Los An
geles — two more players than usual.
Adding to that support are the families of four local players, freshman Hi
lary' Barte, junior Megan Doheny, senior Celia Durkin and junior Jessica
Nguyen, who make their return to the Los Angeles area.
"Everyone's very excited," Forood said. "We're just looking forward to
playing these teams. We love playing down there and it's going be a lot of
fun."
Leading the way for the Cardinal is Nguyen, who has been battling a
wrist injury since Indoors.
Despite her injury, Nguyen fought her way to a perfect week of match
play, earning the praise of her coach and teammates.
"She's been incredible the last week, playing without hitting a two
handed backhanded," Forood said. "That's two singles matches and a dou
bles match, and for her, who's not a big girl to begin with, to play without
two hands — what an incredible statement. Not only that she knew she
had to play, but just her ability to play that one-handed slice so well and
dominate her opponents [was incredible]."
With Nguyen near or at 100% and the squad raring to go, Stanford has
the chance to close out the trip 4-1.
"We're pretty resilient because we haven't been anywhere near full
health going back to our final match at the Indoors," Forood said.'Tf we can
