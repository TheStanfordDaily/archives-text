# Fortune planted as band mascot
## Dollies initiate "Patchez" into sylvan order, ready Tree for Saturday debut 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
In the wee hours of yesterday
morning, the decision was made:
Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09 will
be the next Tree.
How does he feel about it?
"Really damn good," Fortune
said. "Little tired, little sore, but feel
ing strong in the soul."
This year's Tree, John Whipple
'10, made the final decision in con
junction with band manager Liz
Schackmann '08, assistant band
manager Nate Foorman '09 and
incoming drum major David
Borowitz '08.
Immediately prior to the deci
sion, all candidates go through a

final interview before the four men
tioned band members. Once the new
Tree has been selected, band mem
bers assemble at the Shack and head
out en masse to initiate the new
Tree.
"There were probably 50 or so
people there," Whipple said. "All the
new Dollies, all the current Dollies."
"It was a lot of dancing, a lot of
revelry, a ton of fun," Fortune
added.
As part of the initiation rites.
Fortune said he received his vest, a
symbol that's been around since the
Tree's inception, which Whipple
wore proudly every day during this
year's Tree Week.
