# Fortune planted as band mascot
## Dollies initiate "Patchez" into sylvan order, ready Tree for Saturday debut 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
In the wee hours of yesterday
morning, the decision was made:
Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09 will
be the next Tree.
How does he feel about it?
"Really damn good," Fortune
said. "Little tired, little sore, but feel
ing strong in the soul."
This year's Tree, John Whipple
'10, made the final decision in con
junction with band manager Liz
Schackmann '08, assistant band
manager Nate Foorman '09 and
incoming drum major David
Borowitz '08.
Immediately prior to the deci
sion, all candidates go through a

final interview before the four men
tioned band members. Once the new
Tree has been selected, band mem
bers assemble at the Shack and head
out en masse to initiate the new
Tree.
"There were probably 50 or so
people there," Whipple said. "All the
new Dollies, all the current Dollies."
"It was a lot of dancing, a lot of
revelry, a ton of fun," Fortune
added.
As part of the initiation rites.
Fortune said he received his vest, a
symbol that's been around since the
Tree's inception, which Whipple
wore proudly every day during this
year's Tree Week.

Patrick "Patchez" Fortune proudly sports a ceremonial helmet after being
declared the official Stanford Tree early Thursday morning. Fortune was
given the title of Tree after more than a week of campaigning and stunts.
"The same one has been passed
down," he said. "It's never been
washed, from what I've been led to
understand, and I'm going to con
tinue that."
Interestingly, Fortune comment
ed that the vest did not smell too
bad, "not as bad as I would have
thought it would."
At tomorrow night's basketball
game, the title of Tree will officially
pass from Whipple to Fortune.
Whipple has fond memories of
his own first appearance as Tree, an
event that is annually entitled
"Sprout Night."
"Either at halftime or towards
the end of the game, [last year's
Tree and IJ ran out there and had
planned that he would throw off his
costume and I would throw it on,"
Whipple said. "That was the first
time I had ever put on the Tree. But
I think he actually got in trouble for
doing that because he's not sup
posed to take the costume off."
After attending last night's bas
ketball game. Fortune said that he
saw the Tree in a whole new light.
"Now I'm just ready to put it on
and see how it feels," he said. "I'm
just ready for my year. It's going to
be the best year of my life."
Fortune also said that he has lots
of design ideas in mind for creating
his own costume.
"I'm definitely not going for a
palm tree design," he said. "But I'm
hoping for changeable faces. I want
to give lots of expressions."
Whipple said that the selection
committee took all three original
Tree candidates, including Jack
Cackler, into consideration when
making their decision.
"We didn't only just consider
Forrest White '10] and Patchez
Fortune , we also considered Jack
Cackler ," he said. "Patrick
Fortune was the one we chose
because he displayed all the things
we wanted to see."
