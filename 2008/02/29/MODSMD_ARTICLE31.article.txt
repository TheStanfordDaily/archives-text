## Pausing for Pinter: Stanford Drama Department's "Betrayal" 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION ANGLOPHILE 
Not many 20th-century writers can count themselves among
those who've lent their names to adjectives, hut the Nobel laure
ate Harold Pinter has that distinction under his belt. To him be
longs the dubious honor of the Pinteresque pause: uncomfort
able, deafening silences punctuate his plays, reminiscent of dead
air on the radio. Pinter's plays are notoriously difficult both to
perform and to watch. But the Drama Department's latest pro
duction of "Betrayal" does an admirable job with the mercurial
— often intractable — text.
"Betrayal" is Pinter's exploration of infidelity. Jerry cheats on
his wife with Emma, who just happens to be his best friend
Robert's wife. Straightforward? Well, not quite. In typical Pinter
style, the action unwinds backwards. The first scene is a glimpse
of Jerry and Emma discussing their affair long after it has fallen
apart, and the last is Jerry making his first move on Emma.
Kudos must go to director Daniel Sacks for his sensitive ren
dering of Pinter. When you walk into the theatre, you're con
fronted by masses of furniture draped in white cloth, and you feel
like you've walked into a flat being renovated. As the action un
winds, the actors take turns removing bits of cloth, revealing a hit
more of the set, and, in the last scene, everything is uncovered.
You can't help but look back to the start of the play (which is the
end of the affair) and feel a kind of wistfulness: empty apartments
once housed people, too. And that is why '•Betrayal" beguiles
anyway. So much is lost because of the stiff English upper lip, peo
ple not being truthful to themselves or each other, the traitorous-
Imagine if Bach were a student at Stanford. Late at night, he's
rocking out. The stereos vibrate with staccato beats, while his vi
olin chimes with a churchlike aria. His wig flies across the dorm
room floor. 11 is head bangs. He trips over old records of Led Zep
pelin and jazz. As we pass the halls, what would it sound like? A
cacophony! But even dissonant and erratic, the sounds are so
skillfully stirred that they somehow make sense.
This is precisely how the Meridian Arts Ensemble stirred
things up in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Sunday afternoon. Five
brass players and one percussionist from New York kept the au
dience spellbound with the interweaving of both familiar and un
familiar sounds. For example, the first piece, "Ocho por Radio"
(1933) contained a recognizable Latin American pulse, with
mariachi tunes and maraca shakers. Then, somehow, the trumpet
emerged with a rhapsody like the tunes of Doris Day. As soon as
the ear was willing to latch onto the melody of Doris Day, a slow
sonorous snare drum crept in. The cheerful Doris Day was gone,
and the patriotic grief of the drumbeat took over.
The showstopper was "Magnetic North" (2006) by Mark Ap
plebaum (Associate Professor of Composition and Theory here
at Stanford). The piece was as much visual as audio, from the mo
ment Applebaum entered the cluttered stage with his wild, dark,
curly mane. The mad professor poked his concoction, the
"mouseketier." An instrument of his creation, it looked like
"ET" with its antenna, maze of wires, wheels and sticks, all con
nected to a laptop.
The Ensemble players behind him, with their gleaming trum
pets, horn, tuba and trombone, occasionally smacked their lips,
bent over to tap their Pellegrino bottles, and hurled out a Kung fu
"Huh!" They made an exaggerated look at their wristwatches
and counted loudly, "47...48."
The "mouseketier" instrument made noises like birds flutter
ing around their cages, the echoes of galaxies or the stomach gur

ness of it all. And you can't help but feel their loss as your own:
during the long pauses the actors look out onto you in the audi
ence, and you're intimately implicated in the dramatic moment.

The actors handle the lines bravely. Amin El Gamal's Robert
is a fey, delicate and ethereal creature whose deviousncss is a de
licious foil to the earthy seriousness of George Wyhinny's Jerry.
At the center of the infidelity is Emma, sympathetically portrayed
by Clea Alsip. Their ensemble work is snappy and brings out the

gling inside the human body. In the middle of the piece, Apple
baum bolted to his feet. Suddenly, he was the conductor. He
pointed up, pointed down and then flicked his middle finger be
fore resuming his seat behind the "mouseketier" contraption.
