# Cacophony, With Confidence

### MELANIE REYNARD INTERMISSION MERIDIAN PRIMER 
The horn ranted off with a series of urgent calls. Then the
trumpet player stood up to debate. His eyebrows jumped up and
down as he bounced with his trumpet clucking away breathlessly,
before he stuck the instrument between his legs and flicked his
finger about.
During the intermission, the composer's score was displayed
at the edge of the stage. It lookedmore likelplaUcrs by Joan Mir6
than a sheet of music notation.. Applebaum explained that this
"evocative pictograph could be interpreted rigorously, consulted
casually or ignored completely.'||| 1 "WWi
As a nice antithesis to Applebaum, Stanford graduate student
Per Bloland introduced the world premiere of his"Stillas" (201$),
as "almost the opposite." He advised the audience to "dive into

This piece was comprised of quartertones (as Bloland explained,
quartertones are the sounds in between conventional notes. They
don't exist on a piano, but agile lips can find them on wind instru
ments). If Applebaum's piece had been a circus of alarm bells,
Bloland's piece was reduced to the singular peal of one bell, ex

uneasy triangulation of the relationships: Jerry cheats on his wife.
Emma cheats on Robert, Robert cheats on Emma, Jerry betrays
his best friend. Robert knows of Jerry's betrayal but doesn't tell
him. It all comes to a head when Emma asks Jerry, provocatively,
if he thinks his wife is cheating on him. Both don't seem to realize
the lies that they're living have become a sort of reality and that
they're cheating on each other with their respective spouses.
Meanings multiply: just who's betraying whom?
A little complaint: time and place are a bit too heavily handled
in this production of "Betrayal." Pinter's work, though set in the
late '60s and '70s, seems to exist curiously outside of time. The ob
vious announcing of the procession of time by having the year
printed on the undraped cloths disrupts Pinter's own subtle han
dling of chronology. The play's time should be allowed to unwind
on its own. So also with the place: your reviewer's un-American
ears were piqued each time he caught wind of the American ac
cent attempting to anglicize itself in order to deal with the
Britishisms that color the text. Either choose to do the English ac
cent well, or abandon it altogether; anything in between sounds a
bit off-key.
But these are minor quibbles for an otherwise clever produc
tion of "Betrayal." Watch it: the one and a half hours you spend
in the theatre will seem a bit longer, but, then again, it's Pinter.
You don't watch Pinter to while the time away. No, he's just a bit
too serious for that: you watch the plays to see Pinter whittle life
down to the very bone, the dry and dusty bone. You leave feeling
a bit more human, a bit more unsure of yourself and the silences
that you have faced, and will have to face.
traded and stretched out in a zen-like trance. The strange sounds
were thus distilled into a meditation, lulled along by sweet bangs
on the vibraphone.
Another piece to mention was "Corpus" (2007), inspired by
Bach's music for church on Sunday, reconstructed to take us
through genres of the 21st century. The jazz drums and repetitive
phrases formed a mixed soundtrack of "Westside Story" meets
Batman meets Disney.
AU in all, the musicians slapped balloons, hung over quarter
tones, flicked each other off and bellowed notes that rubbed with
intense friction. With all the recognizable and unrecognizable
pitches, melodies and arrangements, the enchanted audience
member asks himself, "Why isn't all this a complete descent into
discord? Why did my ears reach for the next sound, rather than
recoil in shock ? What made it music, rather than just noise "'
