### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION SOCIAL SNIFFLER 
There's been a lot of talk lately
about the "flu," which people

seem to have been getting
from somewhere. Now, I
like to take walks every
once in a while as a way of
shaking out my legs,
which aren't as strong as
they used to be. That's
what happens when you get

old — your body gets tired. "
Also, urinating requires more
concentration. At least that's
what I've noticed.

What do I see when I take these walks? I
see people blowing their noses into Kleenex

tissues or, less commonly these days, into hand
kerchiefs, which I've always preferred. I don't un
derstand this. I'm not coughing. Why is everyone
else?

Scientists tell us that these sick people have caught some sort
of "virus," which is. as far as 1 can tell, a kind of very small gerbil
or hamster inside our body. See. I don't understand hamsters.
They're not very entertaining and die quickly when sat upon.
And I don't know anything about medicine. But I don't think
these people are sick. That doesn't sound right to me. Maybe

Since there are a limited number of singles in
Manzanita, I assume that most of you will have to
be more creative in your attempts to avoid all
human contact. If you have a roommate, 1 suggest
you use dorm programming to your advantage
and find them a hot date for Screw Your Room-

mate. With any luck, they will be flung into a
romance and will end up in their newfound
love's room. Then you will have a really
sweet single. This works best when the date
does not live in the dorm so they won't both
be around you the whole time.

The next thing to do is to make sure you cut
out all partying whatsoever, especially any par
ties at SAE. The combination of alcohol, cold

weather and skimpy clothes at midnight in February is
the perfect storm for illness. This is also the perfect op
portunity for someone with a cold to cozy up you.
Stay away from them. I promise they have
cooties.

Dining is another potential disaster zone
for contact with people because most people

The best way to avoid getting sick is to become as
anti-social as humanly possible. In the best-case sce
nario, you've somehow managed to cheat the Draw
and have your own room. This way, you can avoid
catching any of the germs that your roommate or
roommate's significant other is going to bring into
your room. Hopefully, you also drew into Manzanita,
where contact with your fellow dormmates is going to
be unlikely. Once you've accomplished this, hole
yourself up in your room for the remainder of the
quarter, and this should prevent the flu.

they're ill. "Ill" is a better word than "sick," but 1 never know
when to stop writing it. Is it one L? Two L's? Four? Nobody
knows.

1 do know a lot of things can make you sick. Bad music can
make you sick. A haggard, 70-year-old woman, now un-

recognizable as your wife, in bed with you. Gerbils, ap
parently.

Do you know what makes me sick? Just take a look
' at this headline from the Topeka Capital-Journal:
m "Critics Say Dairy Labels a Confusing Cash Cow."

I don't like this headline. It's eonfusing. Critics
say what now? Why do I care about dairy la-

bels? I can't imagine a topic I'm less interest
ed in reading about. I don't own any cows.

I'm not going to put any effort into reading
that, because I'm a busy man with other
headlines to read.

make no eye contact with anyone at all, and appear ir-

I'm not going to read this one, though,
either: "Castro Steps Down." Who's

Castro? Steps down from what? Why
do I care? I don't, that's why.

What's this one say? "DIS
ASTER!" Just nonsense.

Or look at this sign, for in

ritated if someone

to you. And. whatever you do, make sure you check
your dishes in the dining hall. 1 can't remember how
many times 1 have found dirty dishes in with clean
ones. My friend swears that she got mono this way and
not from the boys she'd been kissing.

You should also avoid going to class, es
pecially in the rain. In fact, the next time it
is raining you should stay in and take a nap.
If you absolutely must go to class, ".it as far
away from your peers as possible. Which
probably means you should sit right in front
of the room in the center where the lectur
er can see you. Or you can become I HUM
girl or boy and then people will avoid you
entirely.

Another way to get to people to avoid
you is to refuse to dress yourself properly
in the morning and to appear considerably
angry with the world. People will be an
noyed by your dark demeaner and will not
want to touch you. I don't recommend not
bathing, however, because then you will be
dirty, and that just means a lot of germs.

If you manage to he completely anti-so
cial, then you probably won't have to go to
Vaden at all during this lovely flu season and will
avoid any and all embarrassing questions about
whether you could be pregnant or not, and fur
ther contact with sick people in the waiting
room.
Happy Flu Season!

stance: "Caution: High Voltage." Hoozywhatsit? Blahblahblah
blah? That's all this is to me. It's no Thurber, I can tell you that
much. Sounds like a load of futuristic horse flop, if you don't mind
the coarse language. 1 remember a time when signs said some
thing and pecan pie was a nickel. And women couldn't vote.
Another thing that makes me sick is basketball. Bunch of peo
ple in ridiculous outfits just running around looking for the goal.
Who designed those sticks they carry? Those look just plain
dumb. And whose idea was it to put the game on ice? Ice is for
Wisconsin, is what I've always said. And raccoons! You'll find
them in Wisconsin, too.
Can you imagine what the world would be like if Wisconsin
were real? What a crazy universe that would be! Unicorns, elves
and Wisconsin. I'd be sick all over the place.
Another thing that makes me sick is corndogs. I've eaten a
corndog for lunch every Thursday since 1958. Do you know the
name of the man who invented the corndog? We know Thomas
Alva Edison's name, and he invented the peanut, but we don't
know anything about corndogs. They could be from anywhere.
And 1, personally, think they are from anywhere. Every time I eat
one, I end up ralphing six ways from Sunday. But 1 keep eating
them, and 1 will continue right on eating them until someone
passes a law against it.
That's just the way I feel about this.

your dishes in the dining hall. 1 can't remember how

not from the boys she'd been kissing.

You should also avoid going to class, es
pecially in the rain. In fact, the next time it
is raining you should stay in and take a nap.
If you absolutely must go to class, ".it as far
away from your peers as possible. Which
probably means you should sit right in front
of the room in the center where the lectur
er can see you. Or you can become I HUM
girl or boy and then people will avoid you
entirely.

Another way to get to people to avoid
you is to refuse to dress yourself properly
in the morning and to appear considerably
angry with the world. People will be an
noyed by your dark demeaner and will not
want to touch you. I don't recommend not
bathing, however, because then you will be
dirty, and that just means a lot of germs.

If you manage to he completely anti-so
cial, then you probably won't have to go to
Vaden at all during this lovely flu season and will
avoid any and all embarrassing questions about
whether you could be pregnant or not, and fur
ther contact with sick people in the waiting
room.
Happy Flu Season!

stance: "Caution: High Voltage." Hoozywhatsit? Blahblahblah
blah? That's all this is to me. It's no Thurber, I can tell you that
much. Sounds like a load of futuristic horse flop, if you don't mind
the coarse language. 1 remember a time when signs said some
thing and pecan pie was a nickel. And women couldn't vote.
Another thing that makes me sick is basketball. Bunch of peo

Who designed those sticks they carry? Those look just plain
dumb. And whose idea was it to put the game on ice? Ice is for
Wisconsin, is what I've always said. And raccoons! You'll find
them in Wisconsin, too.
Can you imagine what the world would be like if Wisconsin
were real? What a crazy universe that would be! Unicorns, elves
and Wisconsin. I'd be sick all over the place.
Another thing that makes me sick is corndogs. I've eaten a
corndog for lunch every Thursday since 1958. Do you know the
name of the man who invented the corndog? We know Thomas
Alva Edison's name, and he invented the peanut, but we don't
know anything about corndogs. They could be from anywhere.
And 1, personally, think they are from anywhere. Every time I eat
one, I end up ralphing six ways from Sunday. But 1 keep eating
them, and 1 will continue right on eating them until someone
passes a law against it.
That's just the way I feel about this.


There's been a lot of talk lately
about the "flu," which people

seem to have been getting
from somewhere. Now, I
like to take walks every
once in a while as a way of
shaking out my legs,
which aren't as strong as
they used to be. That's
what happens when you get

old — your body gets tired. "
Also, urinating requires more
concentration. At least that's
what I've noticed.

What do I see when I take these walks? I
see people blowing their noses into Kleenex

tissues or, less commonly these days, into hand
kerchiefs, which I've always preferred. I don't un
derstand this. I'm not coughing. Why is everyone
else?

Scientists tell us that these sick people have caught some sort
of "virus," which is. as far as 1 can tell, a kind of very small gerbil
or hamster inside our body. See. I don't understand hamsters.
They're not very entertaining and die quickly when sat upon.
And I don't know anything about medicine. But I don't think
these people are sick. That doesn't sound right to me. Maybe

Since there are a limited number of singles in
Manzanita, I assume that most of you will have to
be more creative in your attempts to avoid all
human contact. If you have a roommate, 1 suggest
you use dorm programming to your advantage
and find them a hot date for Screw Your Room-

mate. With any luck, they will be flung into a
romance and will end up in their newfound
love's room. Then you will have a really
sweet single. This works best when the date
does not live in the dorm so they won't both
be around you the whole time.

The next thing to do is to make sure you cut
out all partying whatsoever, especially any par
ties at SAE. The combination of alcohol, cold

weather and skimpy clothes at midnight in February is
the perfect storm for illness. This is also the perfect op
portunity for someone with a cold to cozy up you.
Stay away from them. I promise they have
cooties.

Dining is another potential disaster zone
for contact with people because most people

The best way to avoid getting sick is to become as
anti-social as humanly possible. In the best-case sce
nario, you've somehow managed to cheat the Draw
and have your own room. This way, you can avoid
catching any of the germs that your roommate or
roommate's significant other is going to bring into
your room. Hopefully, you also drew into Manzanita,
where contact with your fellow dormmates is going to
be unlikely. Once you've accomplished this, hole
yourself up in your room for the remainder of the
quarter, and this should prevent the flu.

they're ill. "Ill" is a better word than "sick," but 1 never know
when to stop writing it. Is it one L? Two L's? Four? Nobody
knows.

1 do know a lot of things can make you sick. Bad music can
make you sick. A haggard, 70-year-old woman, now un-

recognizable as your wife, in bed with you. Gerbils, ap
parently.

Do you know what makes me sick? Just take a look
' at this headline from the Topeka Capital-Journal:
m "Critics Say Dairy Labels a Confusing Cash Cow."

I don't like this headline. It's eonfusing. Critics
say what now? Why do I care about dairy la-

bels? I can't imagine a topic I'm less interest
ed in reading about. I don't own any cows.

I'm not going to put any effort into reading
that, because I'm a busy man with other
headlines to read.
