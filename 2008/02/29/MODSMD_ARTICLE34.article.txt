# The 						Doctor is In
## 
### 
Stanford is currently infested with diseases of every shape and size. But could there be a way to cure this campus? Prognosis: yeah. In this week's
Bracketology, I've assembled a diverse collection of men, women, children, a cannibal and an ape to see which among them is the best doctor.
And yes, I realize that everyone in the bracket is either fictional, dead or not actually a medical doctor, but, as a general rule, I automatically trust
people with "Dr." in their name. Don't you?
