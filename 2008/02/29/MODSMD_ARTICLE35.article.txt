## Chinese with a touch of class 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION SNEEZE'N'SIPPER 
Before the winter is over, most stu
dents on campus will be hit by one of
the colds going around. When that
happens, few things are better for re
lief than a cup of tea and a bowl of
soup. But when a can of chicken soup
won't quite cut it. a Chinese restau
rant might be the place to go. Palo
Alto offers a number of options, but
the nicest is Mandarin Gourmet, lo
cated off of University Avenue.
Mandarin Gourmet does not look
like your typical neighborhood Chi
nese restaurant, with its bow-tie
sporting wait staff and art deco interi
or. Besides having white tablecloths,
the elegance of the space is accented
by large murals with Chinese motifs
and light fixtures and chairs that
evoke the style of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh or Frank Lloyd Wright.
While the space is not intended to be
the center of attention, a lot of
thought clearly went into the design.
One side of the dining room is a few
steps higher than the other and is set
off by a wall with a few windows that
cuts down noise without unnecessari
ly isolating either side. Clever inter
locking booths in the middle of the
dining room allow for a surprisingly
large number of tables without mak
ing patrons feel the least bit crowded.
Surprisingly, Mandarin Gourmet
does not have high-end prices that

appetizers around $<Sand the majori
ty of entrees below $15, it is barely
more expensive than the average Chi
nese restaurant. Unfortunately, you
can't have the best of both worlds,
and the quality of the food seemed
more in line with the prices than the
decor.
If you're looking for magical relief
from a cold or flu, you'll want to start
with some soup. At first, the $8 price
tag for a "small" bowl might seem a
bit high, but even a small serves two to
three people, so it's actually quite rea
sonable. The hot and sour soup in
cluded well prepared chicken, veggies
and tofu with a surprisingly good tex
ture. The broth and seasonings, how
ever, failed to provide anything spe
cial. Overall, the soup might have
been a step up from the hot and sour
soup served at most places, but it
failed to distinguish itself in a mean
ingful way.
When you want something spicy
(probably not while you have the flu),
a good standby is usually an order of
wontons in hot oil. Mandarin
Gourmet's rendition, however, was
disappointing. The wontons them
selves were good — they seemed
fresh and were filled with properly
cooked meat. However, whereas
most restaurants that serve this dish

use a red chili oil, Mandarin Gourmet
uses a peanut-based sauce. While I
generally have nothing against
peanuts, the thickness and stickiness
of the peanut sauce masked the tex
ture of the smooth wontons. Sadly, it
left me reaching for my water glass,
not on account of the spiciness, but
because of all the salt. Also, in a
restaurant that prides itself on ap
pearances, the presentation of the
wontons left something to be desired.
The highlight of the meal was the
sesame chicken. The chicken is cut
into small pieces before being fried,
allowing for maximum crispy surface
area. The flavor, which avoided the
artificial taste which is all too com
mon with sesame chicken, was in the
meat itself, rather than in the sauce.
While a meal at Mandarin
Gourmet is undoubtedly a nicer expe
rience than at some of the other local
offerings — in addition to the nice in
terior, the service was absolutely on
its game — the food doesn't quite
measure up to the surroundings. The
food may be a little better than the
competition, but it's also slightly more
expensive. So, at the end of the day.
you get what you pay for, and, dollar
for dollar, the food at Mandarin
Gourmet is on par with the food
everywhere else.
