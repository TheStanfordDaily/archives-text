# Beach House earns our "Devotion"
## 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION BEACH BUM 
"Devotion" (Car Park) by
Beach House is a perfect head
phones album, but not in the tradi
tional sense. It is not overstuffed
with details like sound effects or
found sound. Rather. "Devotion"
is built around rich textures that
slowly unfurl themselves to reveal
a sad, quiet core. It is its minimal
ism that makes it so captivating.
There is a deep loneliness that
seems to echo through the album,
not least in the voice of female lead
vocalist Victoria Legrand, a bar
tender originally from Paris. Her
voice is often layered to create
ethereal melodies, as if it were an
other instrument in the mix. But
her lead singing is most captivating
of all. She sings with a dreamy, va
cant quality reminiscent of Grace
Slick of Jefferson Airplane. The
instrumentals, meanwhile, are
low-key in a bright, psychedelic
way. Bandmate Alex Scally. a car
penter from Baltimore, assembles
gauzy synths, simple, reverb
laiden guitar lines and plodding
percussion that meld into the larg
er atmosphere of the song. Fans of
Slowdive, an early 1990s shoegaze
band, will feel comfortably at
home. Even so, Beach House has
carved out a sonic niche all their
own.
Beach House's standout songs
are distributed evenly throughout
the album. The third song, "Gila,"
quivers with organ and a slow, 10-fi
guitar riff, the best riff on "Devo

tion." The best of Legrand's vocals
come in the song "Turtle Island."
The verse melody is sing-songy.
oscillating between high and low
notes. But at certain parts,
Legrand's voice overwhelms
everything with a distant, piercing
beauty. Everything but the drums
drop out, leaving simple, pleading
questions: "How?/ What?/ What?/
When?"
"D.A.R.L.1.N.G.," meanwhile,
is stunning. Repetitive organ notes
create a slightly livelier pace be
neath the sound of wind chimes.
Bass drums heighten the drama
with a heartbeat-like rhythm. This
heart motif is no coincidence.
The theme of the album, as the
title suggests, is the emotional in
tensity of commitment. The emo
tional terrain of Legrand's love life
is not the lust of the dance floor or
even the infatuation of young love,
which dominate most pop songs,
but instead the bittersweetness of
long-term devotion. Her lyrics and
delivery are replete with shades of
sorrow and joy alike. In "Wedding
Bells," she sings both hopefully
and angrily, "Your wish is my com
mand." In "Turtle Island," she
arranges to meet her lover at Tur
tle Island, promising that "I will
wait for you there/ Waiting silent
ly/ 1 can keep you/ Right behind
me/ All my days and nights."
Legrand, then, is not singing about
the difficulties of falling in love,
but in keeping it.
This is a sentiment worth listen
ing to closely, headphones firmly
in ears.
