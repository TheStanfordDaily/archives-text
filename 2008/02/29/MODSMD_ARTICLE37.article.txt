## THE 						CURE 
### MELANIE REYNARD 
I have been trying to cure you. For a long time now.
Well, from the day we started business school 1 noticed some
thing about you. Quiet. You were quiet and pensive. You'd walk
around with a still, steady sway, like a tall palm tree in a desert. I
wasn't having the greatest time either — I'd spend the nights
stuffing myself with Chinese take-out as I sifted through spread
sheets.

One day after class, I sat near you on the con
crete bench, my notes blinded by the stark rays

of the sun. I looked up at you to ask what

time it was, and you just erupted. Tears

shot down your cheeks. You rubbed
your palms together in your lap. Fi-

nally, you stared straight into space.
Your face was completely drained.

I didn't talk to you for a week after
that. Every time 1 thought of calling
you, 1 felt claustrophobic. So I went
back to wandering alone, but then
everything in my life seemed even
more superficial, especially the for
tune cookies. So one night I called
you up. "Wanna go get some paella?"
1 asked cheerfully.

That night in the restaurant, under
the glow of red lights, you were quiet
as usual. I shoved a piece of shrimp in
my mouth. Quiet. But I didn't let it
bother me. 1 chewed as loudly as pos
sible to fill the silence. Then I talked.
And talked. You stared at your food
and swallowed slowly. As 1 was mid
sentence —
"Could you please turn your voice
down?" the waitress said. Abruptly
her face came into view and then van
ished. I buried my head in my hands
and I writhed uncomfortably in my
own skin. You slowly sunk away from

the table. 1 looked up at you,

embarrassed for having
made a scene. "I'm a
sorry, I just — " '

"No," you shrugged.

And that was all you said, but suddenly I loved you.
"There's just so much inside of me!" I sighed. I grunted. You
nodded.
You put your hands on the chair and keeled over, as if your
torso was caving in. You confessed that you envied me, because
there wasn't much inside of you. You said you could sense a par
asite in your mind, eating away, making "empty holes" where
words had once been. So you could no longer name your feelings.
Anonymous feelings, you reported, but you could somehow
carry on with business as usual. Again, I decided I loved you and
1 took great pity on you.

We took a taxi home. You were quiet, so I chatted garrulous
ly. We stared at each other through our reflections in the dark
window as the sky went from periwinkle to plum.

When we paid the taxi, my mind was filled with chatter. If any
one could cure you, I could cure you. I told you I understood, just
like you understood me. You sighed with relief. I was ecstatic.

and I anxiously scribbled you down: my Project.

1 instructed you to text me every evening at
9pm. 1 took you to Quaker service and spinning

class. I took you for walks to get some

jo
fresh air. I called to check in on you. and

spilled words into your

cars whenever I could. I
knew exactly what vou

needed. You would be cured

in no time. 1 mused to myself about
more vitamins and rituals to add to our

checklist. I would make
you a book of my most in
spirational poems... I
would insist you eat raw
garlic...
And then one night, 9
p.m. passed and there was
no text from you. I waited.
10 p.m. 11 p.m. Finally, 1
got a blank message from
you. 1 stared at the screen.
Dismal. White.

Failure. Crisis. Sirens
went off. Like a firefighter
called to the fire, 1 threw
on my jacket. It was rain
ing hard, but 1 was imper
meable as I raced through
the downpour. I knocked
my knuckles almost

through the door.

My heart
|W a s
thumping.

The door peeled

open. You were still in your suit, your
neck choked with a green tie. You stared down at me
with that blank, pale face.
"How beautiful the rain is!" I chirped. Your eyes
emptied like a Hushing toilet bowl.
And then, I decided to try the last cure I had in
side me. "Can 1 hold you?" I shouted.
Without waiting for a response, I lunged at you. I
grabbed you, as you stood there soft and still. I was
ready to cradle you like a baby in my arms, but 1 had
overestimated my size. My head jammed in the
crook of your armpit. After ten minutes, the rain

continued to pour. 1 squeezed onto you for dear life.
You said nothing.
1 let go. I stepped back, drenched and my teeth clattering. 1
looked at you from afar. There was that quiet stillness in your
eyes, even though they were glassy and the moisture trembled on
their surface. And as the rain continued to clamor, 1 smiled at you
as if I understood.
"Don't worry," 1 said. "I know exactly how you feel. It's not
empty!"
But you just shrugged and said, "Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks."
You closed the door slowly, with a serene calmness. 1 staggered
away, drunk with exhaustion. 1 nibbled the skin around mv nails.
Just like you, I was at a loss for words. And for the first time, I
questioned whether or not I could really cure you.
And then it hit me. Who am 1 trying to cure?
