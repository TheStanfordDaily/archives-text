## "City of Men" not quite godly but still a helluva movie 
### JEFFREY GILLILAND 
In 2002, Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles brought the
world "Cidade de Deus" ("City of God"), a spectacular, rivet
ing and often shocking look at life in the shantvtowns, or fave
lus, of Rio de Janeiro. The film introduced viewers to life in
these poor villages, giving them a heart-rending glimpse of the
meagerness, the difficulty and, above all, the violence that per
vades there. Images of gangs of elementary school-age boys,
killing while laughing with glee, scored themselves on the
minds of all who watched Meirelles' masterpiece. The film was
a revelation, simultaneously crafting a brilliant movie and
showing the world a side of life they may have never imagined.
"Cidade dos 1 fomens" ("City of Men"), the follow-up to the
2002 shocker, takes a different approach to exploring life in the
favelas. While drug deals and gang violence are still a major
theme, they are not the focus of the film as they were in "City
of God." Instead, they provide a backdrop to a more intimate,
personal story about two friends dealing with becoming men in
a place where people often don't see adulthood.
The story centers on Acerola. or Ace — played by Douglas
Silva — and Laranjinha. or Wallace, played by

Darlan Cunha. The two are best friends who
have been inseparable since childhood and are
both turning 18. Each character faces this com
ing of age differently: Wallace sets out to find
his long-lost father, while Ace attempts to come
to grips with his own fatherhood and accept re
sponsibility for his young son. As the two search
for their own answers — and as a gang war tears

their favela apart behind them — Ace
and Wallace encounter a secret that
threatens to destroy the friendship
they have shared for so long.

Even from a brief synopsis of the
plot, it can be seen that "City of Men'

is a much different movie than "City of
God": it is a softer story, quieter and

more interested in exploring

character than horri

fying the viewer. Its overarching themes are not those of blood
shed and lawlessness, hut those of fatherhood, the community
of the favelas and the resilience of hope. Put simply. "City of
Men" leaves those who watch it with a sense of optimism and
humanity not seen in "City of God."
Humanity is what separates "City of Men" from "City of
God," and humanity is what prevents it from ever being the
kind of earth-shattering movie "City of God" was. "City of
Men" is a story about friends and fathers, while "City of God"
was a story about everyone killing everyone else; the first can
simply never make the kind of impact the second can. Ulti
mately. though. "City of Men" is not trying to be the kind of
movie "City of God" is: it is a companion piece, attempting to
be a more intimate look at a pervasive societal problem, and it
accomplishes that goal with Hying colors. Unfortunately for
"City of Men." being such a piece forever condemns the movie
to the mire of "good" cinema. "City of Men" is a good movie,
but it is not, and can never be, a great movie. For the rest of its
existence, "City of Men" will be compared to its predecessor,
and the comparison will almost never be favorable.

That said, "City of Men" is a good
movie. Douglas Silva and Darlan
Cunha give rich, mature performances,
and director Paulo Morelli and cine
matographer Adriano Goldman com
bine sweeping shots of Brazil's beauty
with frantic, shaky scenes of street
fighting to impart a complete and stun
ning image of life in the favelas. Every-

body involved in the creation
of "City of Men" has done
everything right, and the re
suit is a beautiful depiction of
the friendship and love at the

core of a hysterical world. "City
of Men" can never be "Citv of

God," but it is still a tremendous film,
and that's all that reallv matters.
