# SHARP SHOT
## No. 8 Card holds off Huskies, 82-79 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anthony Goods caught fire from outside, Brook Lopez was as
hot as ever down low and Stanford overcame 16 Washington
points in the last 2:20 with lights-out shooting to down the Huskies
82-79 in Maples Pavilion last night.

"This is the third game
in a row where we've been
out-physicaled and our
rebounding took a step
back," said coach Trent
Johnson, whose team has
won 10 of its last 11 games.
"We're a lot better than
that in rebounding and fin
ishing and the kids under
stand that. Make no mis
take. I'm excited we won,
but we know we need to
play better this time of
year."
Lopez scored 21 points
(7-of-14 shooting, 7-of-7
free throws) on another
efficient performance,
which is quickly becoming
the norm for him and for
Stanford. Ilie bigger sur
prise was Goods, who fol
lowed up a 20-point effort
versus Cal (15-11, 6-9) last
Sunday with 16 points
thanks to exceptional
accuracy (6-of-12 overall,
4-of-7 three-pointers). The
junior's stroke had
regressed after a hot soph
omore season, but Goods
has been taking extra shots
in practice over the past
few weeks and the effort
showed tonight.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal held off a late
surge by the Huskies to come out on top in
an often ugly, 82-79 win. Brook Lopez's typi
cally solid performance was buoyed by strong
support from Anthony Goods, who seemed
to regain his stroke, shooting 6-12 from the
field and 4-7 from beyond the arc. Stanford
faces its next key Pac-10 test tomorrow, when
Trent Johnson's eighth ranked squad hosts
the No. 22 Cougars, as the Cardinal look to
catch up with UCLA for the conference lead
down the stretch.

"I feel like I've got my
touch hack," he said. "That's what happens with hard work."
Stanford (23-4, 12-3 Pac-10) shot a superb 50 percent from the
field (27-of-54) and deep (7-of-14), but it was their marksmanship
from the free-throw line (21-of-30,70 percent) that iced their 15th
straight home victory over Washington (15-14,6-10). The Cardinal
made 15 consecutive free throws over a 17-minute stretch of the
second half to run their home record to 15-1.

Anthony Goods complemented the efforts of Brook Lopez with deadly accuracy
from the perimeter last night, helping to pull out a win against Washington despite
a late run by the Huskies. Goods and the Cardinal face the Cougars tomorrow.

"We kept matching their intensity," said junior
point guard Mitch Johnson. Stanford's unsung
hero (14 points, 6-of-8 free throws, 2-of-2 three
pointers). "They kept coming down and Coach
kept saying, "It's on the five guys out there to
match them; we can't depend on the crowd and we
can't worry about the refs,' which we honestly had
been doing a little."
The Huskies, meanwhile, made each of those
free throws count with an incredible late-game
spurt of their own. They scored on their last seven
possessions in the contest to total 16 points in the
last 2:20, which would translate to a 274-point pace
over a 40-minute game. Forward Quincy Poindex
ter (19 points, 8-of-l 1 shooting) and guard Justin
Dentmon (12 points) had four points apiece down
the stretch.
Four straight buckets from bulky forward Jon
Brockman (20 points, 14 rebounds) cut Stanford's
lead from 56-51 nine minutes into the second to
60-59 with 7:08 remaining. But the Cardinal's de
fense stiffened, allowing Washington just four
points in the next 4:48, as Stanford reestablished it
self with a 71-63 lead with 2:42 left.
"We kind of had that bend-but-don't-break de
fense." Mitch Johnson said. "We made big plays

when we needed to."
Two Goods three-pointers propelled Stanford
to a 13-3 lead early and Johnson's squad never
trailed. The Cardinal led by a similar margin
throughout the rest of the half, as they rotated in
reserve guards Drew Shiller and Landry Fields
and backup center Peter Prowitt. building a 41-34
halftime lead behind 13 points from Brook Lopez.
"Quite frankly, 1 think we're probably doing
too much to let them be fresh — we've got to get
back to 4-on-4. 5-on-5. being physical," Coach
Johnson said of practices. "Ihis time of year you
worry taking guys legs away, and yes, Anthony's
banged up a little, Brook's banged up a little, but
you play like you practice."
Stanford remains one game behind UCLA (25-
3. 13-2) in the Pac-10 standings, with the Bruins
throttling Arizona State (17-10, 7-8) 70-49 last
night. Saturday, the Cardinal will host No. 22
Washington State (22-6, 10-6), 70-49 winners at
Cal last night, before next Thursday's monster
showdown at UCLA. Win out, then beat USC (18-
9, 9-6) two days later, and Stanford no less than
clinches a share of the Pac-10 title.

"We kept matching their intensity," said junior
point guard Mitch Johnson. Stanford's unsung
hero (14 points, 6-of-8 free throws, 2-of-2 three
pointers). "They kept coming down and Coach
kept saying, "It's on the five guys out there to
match them; we can't depend on the crowd and we
can't worry about the refs,' which we honestly had
been doing a little."
The Huskies, meanwhile, made each of those
free throws count with an incredible late-game
spurt of their own. They scored on their last seven
possessions in the contest to total 16 points in the
last 2:20, which would translate to a 274-point pace
over a 40-minute game. Forward Quincy Poindex
ter (19 points, 8-of-l 1 shooting) and guard Justin
Dentmon (12 points) had four points apiece down
the stretch.
Four straight buckets from bulky forward Jon
Brockman (20 points, 14 rebounds) cut Stanford's
lead from 56-51 nine minutes into the second to
60-59 with 7:08 remaining. But the Cardinal's de
fense stiffened, allowing Washington just four
points in the next 4:48, as Stanford reestablished it
self with a 71-63 lead with 2:42 left.
"We kind of had that bend-but-don't-break de
fense." Mitch Johnson said. "We made big plays

when we needed to."
Two Goods three-pointers propelled Stanford
to a 13-3 lead early and Johnson's squad never
trailed. The Cardinal led by a similar margin
throughout the rest of the half, as they rotated in
reserve guards Drew Shiller and Landry Fields
and backup center Peter Prowitt. building a 41-34
halftime lead behind 13 points from Brook Lopez.
"Quite frankly, 1 think we're probably doing
too much to let them be fresh — we've got to get
back to 4-on-4. 5-on-5. being physical," Coach
Johnson said of practices. "Ihis time of year you
worry taking guys legs away, and yes, Anthony's
banged up a little, Brook's banged up a little, but
you play like you practice."
Stanford remains one game behind UCLA (25-
3. 13-2) in the Pac-10 standings, with the Bruins
throttling Arizona State (17-10, 7-8) 70-49 last
night. Saturday, the Cardinal will host No. 22
Washington State (22-6, 10-6), 70-49 winners at
Cal last night, before next Thursday's monster
showdown at UCLA. Win out, then beat USC (18-
9, 9-6) two days later, and Stanford no less than
clinches a share of the Pac-10 title.

Anthony Goods caught fire from outside, Brook Lopez was as
hot as ever down low and Stanford overcame 16 Washington
points in the last 2:20 with lights-out shooting to down the Huskies
82-79 in Maples Pavilion last night.

"This is the third game
in a row where we've been
out-physicaled and our
rebounding took a step
back," said coach Trent
Johnson, whose team has
won 10 of its last 11 games.
"We're a lot better than
that in rebounding and fin
ishing and the kids under
stand that. Make no mis
take. I'm excited we won,
but we know we need to
play better this time of
year."
Lopez scored 21 points
(7-of-14 shooting, 7-of-7
free throws) on another
efficient performance,
which is quickly becoming
the norm for him and for
Stanford. Ilie bigger sur
prise was Goods, who fol
lowed up a 20-point effort
versus Cal (15-11, 6-9) last
Sunday with 16 points
thanks to exceptional
accuracy (6-of-12 overall,
4-of-7 three-pointers). The
junior's stroke had
regressed after a hot soph
omore season, but Goods
has been taking extra shots
in practice over the past
few weeks and the effort
showed tonight.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal held off a late
surge by the Huskies to come out on top in
an often ugly, 82-79 win. Brook Lopez's typi
cally solid performance was buoyed by strong
support from Anthony Goods, who seemed
to regain his stroke, shooting 6-12 from the
field and 4-7 from beyond the arc. Stanford
faces its next key Pac-10 test tomorrow, when
Trent Johnson's eighth ranked squad hosts
the No. 22 Cougars, as the Cardinal look to
catch up with UCLA for the conference lead
down the stretch.

"I feel like I've got my
touch hack," he said. "That's what happens with hard work."
Stanford (23-4, 12-3 Pac-10) shot a superb 50 percent from the
field (27-of-54) and deep (7-of-14), but it was their marksmanship
from the free-throw line (21-of-30,70 percent) that iced their 15th
straight home victory over Washington (15-14,6-10). The Cardinal
made 15 consecutive free throws over a 17-minute stretch of the
second half to run their home record to 15-1.
