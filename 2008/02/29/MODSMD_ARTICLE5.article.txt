## Faculty to experiment with IHUM curriculum Proposals include single three-quarter sequence 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Hie structure of the Introduction
to the Humanities Program may get a
face-lift for the second year in a row,
with options like a three-quarter
sequence and smaller courses under
consideration.
Under a proposal approved by the
Faculty Senate last Thursday, faculty
may experiment with the structure of
courses in the Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) program for

three years, starting in the 2008-09
academic year
Students who complete the exper
imental courses will receive full cred
it for satisfying the first-year General
Education Requirement.
Russell Berman. director of the
I HUM program and a professor of
comparative literature and German
studies, said that there are a couple of
ideas already in the works, including
extending the I HUM sequence to
three-quarters. IHUM students cur
rently enroll in a fall quarter course
and a separate winter and spring
quarter sequence.
"One idea that has come up has
been a single, three-quarter
sequence," Berman said. "Instead of a
one plus two sequence, we want to
have something that builds on thirty
weeks of instruction. It would be sim
ilar to the SLE [Structured Liberal
Education] program, which has
proven itself to be very successful."
Berman added that individual
IHUMs may limit their enrollment
to 50 or 60 students per program,
with a greater focus on incorporating
various areas of seemingly non-relat
ed disciplines.
"A second idea would be to
explore whether we could have small
er IHUMs, where the difference
between lectures and sections may
not be as great," he said.
He further proposed that I HUM
courses may incorporate disciplines
that have not been traditionally
included.
"Imagine IHUM developing as a
venue for dialogue between humani
ties and sciences or other parts of the
University," he said. "It would still be
an introduction to the humanities, but
humanists and natural scientists
would be able to talk and learn from
each other."

Berman said that although these
experiments were designed to
improve the IHUM program, he
admitted to the possibility of some
failures.
"I don't know if all of these exper
iments will succeed," he said, "but we
would like to try and learn from
them."
Berman said that the idea for
greater flexibility within the program
resulted from a survey students com
pleted in January of last year.
Between 5,000 and 5,500 surveys
about the IHUM program were dis
tributed and 1,400 were returned. In
addition to filling out the survey. 9(X)
students gave qualitative responses.
"What came out of the study was a
series of ideas that are different from
what IHUM has been in the past —
and which we want to try out,"
Berman said.
Major changes have already taken
place as a result of the survey, includ
ing a reduction in section times from
90 minutes to 50 minutes.
"We learned from the self-study
that the length of sections was an
enormous irritant to most students
because it blocked people's schedules,
it was difficult to get enough rooms
and so on," Berman said. "While they
were often wonderful, they were also
often less than wonderful."
Berman added that, so far,
responses to the changes that have

already been made have been uni
formly positive.
"I'm convinced that we are mak
ing progress in IHUM. which has
been integral to the Stanford tradi
tion," he said. "I know a lot of stu
dents [who] love IHUM and a lot of
students who resent it. There will
always be students who resent
requirements, but what I'm hearing
is greater appreciation for the oppor
tunities that IHUM is presenting to
the freshmen class. And I'd like to
build on that with a wider range of
courses."
In general, students reacted posi
tively to the potential changes
Berman discussed.
"I really hated IHUM fall quar
ter, so I'm glad that I could switch
out for the next two quarters." said
Michael Wheet '11. "I think it is
important to have the chance to
change your IHUM if you really
don't like it."
Jean Ansolabehere *11 said that a
smaller lecture size would make
learning more effective and allow for
greater student-professor interac
tion.
"I really enjoy section, but I feel
like lectures are so anonymous that it
is really easy for people to have huge
ly different experiences," she said.
