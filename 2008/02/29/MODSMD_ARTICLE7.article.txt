## Stanford Turf invades campus

a s hundreds of troops do
battle across the campus,

I \ key landmarks and even golf
JL JLcourses, the question gripping
many concerned students is: why won't my
map refresh faster?

Since Sunday, many students across campus
have been playing Stanford TUrf, an Internet-

based game created by Space Cap
sule Games. Students can track
progress and log in at Stanford-
TUrf.com.
The game plays much like the

classic board game Risk. It divides the
campus into territories, assigns colors to teams and
asks them to do battle by moving their troops to
attack and defend. Each additional player for a
team contributes trixips to its total, and bonuses
for good combat or control of "continents" can
bring even more soldiers to the ranks.Teams have
taken to appointing war commanders to organize
their strategic operations, which can involve close
to 300 students fighting under one banner.
As of Thursday, team Roble/Lag has pulled
ahead, boasting twice as many territories and
troops as its nearest competitor, Branner/Toyon.
But with teams representing
Sterling/GovCo, Wilbur, Mirrielees and others
still in the game, none of the players are ready to
count anyone out.Team moves are locked in each
day at midnight, and live results are compiled
within a half hour.
"Every morning when I wake up and see the
results, I have no idea what will happen next," said
Austin Lyon '09, Wilbur commander. "Any of the
teams could have a chance."
From the start, the game has been a tale of one
Goliath and many would-be Davids,as
has marshaled superior recruitment and solid tac
tics to steamroll its opponents and defend its bor-

Roble/Lag

ders.
Postings on the game's
official blog have tracked the development of the
powerhouse, which has so far eliminated all three
teams that have perished and earned the coveted
"hot pink" that had adorned one of the van
quished.
"We're feeling pretty safe," said Dean Lowell
Young Tl, commander for Roble/l.ag."The only
thing I've been surprised at is that everyone's
been friends with Branner."
The game has provided both a study break
and a social venue for a lot of students.
"It's week eight, and everyone's kind of
stressed," said Brian Wang 4 10."It's a good way to
divert attention and show some dorm pride."
"I like it because you get to really engage with
people, as opposed to just playing a game by your
self." added Jeff Chern' 10,Toyon commander.
The game originated with Gabe Smedres
man, a student at Yale, where it took the campus
by storm in Jan. 2007. Then called "Old Campus
Tree Risk," it migrated to Harvard as "Harvard
Risk" for spring 2007. The code has evolved and
now rests in the hands of Harvard alums Matt
O'Brien and Andrew Fong, founders of Space
Capsule Games. The two then brought their po

quarter.
"Stanford seemed like the
next natural choice," said
O'Brien.

The game faced a difficult
transition, as Harvard and Yale operate Res
idential Houses and Colleges, respectively, which
provided natural teams and territories. Dividing
up Stanford's variety of housing options regfuijsd DE
some innovations.
"It was certainly a big challenge," said
O'Brien.
Teams have been organized along rough bor
ders. Some complexes, such as Wilbur, Stern and
Florence Moore, fight on their own, while Bran
ner/Toyon and Roble/Lag were unified, creating
the two largest power players.
Students quickly moved to appoint team com
manders, who had to coordinate strategies and
troop assignments for large groups of dorm
mates. Some have found the workload surprising
ly large, and commanders have taken to appoint
ing temporary replacements when they need
breaks.
"It's way more of an effort than I thought it
would be," Lyon said.
"I've not been sleeping much," added Chern.
As the fight progresses, the game's culture has
taken shape. Roble/Lag strategy sessions refer,
not too seriously, to tactics and maneuvers like
"The I lammer," "The Polish Rifle," "Brainz."
"The Frenchman" and "Stonewall Tram."Traffic
on dorm email lists has also increased as midnight
approaches, with exhortations from commanders

fight on
despite long

odds and paper deadlines.
The game has prompted large outreach ef
forts within dorms, as teams rally to expand
their ranks.
"What everyone spends their time on is get
ting people to sign up," said Lyon. "I've been
going door-to-door trying to get busy upperclass
men to play."
"It's been a great way to get the whole campus
involved," added Young.
Also central to the concerns of players were is
: lstrt£>Nff 11 y
espionage. Holes in security for team communi
cations have led to teams intercepting troop
movements ahead of time.
"We've all been exploiting so many windows
of opportunity to one-up each other," Young said.
"And we've had successful espionage, which led
to Branner accusing me of some pretty outra
geous things."
"Some of which aren't true" he added.
While some have floated the idea of playing in
spring quarter, most students saw Turf as a natu
ral choice to become a yearly tradition, joining
other Stanford institutions like Secret Snowflake.
"Spring quarter maybe, but next year definite
ly," said Lyon. "It could be an annual thing that
dorms can rally around and get excited for."
Although the game has attracted enormous
energy, the players are doing their best to keep
their perspective.
"It's all in g(xxl fun," said Lyon. "There's no
prize except glory in the realm of online gaming."
"It's just a great way to procrastinate." he
added.

has marshaled superior recruitment and solid tac
tics to steamroll its opponents and defend its bor-

Roble/Lag

ders.
Postings on the game's
official blog have tracked the development of the
powerhouse, which has so far eliminated all three
teams that have perished and earned the coveted
"hot pink" that had adorned one of the van
quished.
"We're feeling pretty safe," said Dean Lowell
Young Tl, commander for Roble/l.ag."The only
thing I've been surprised at is that everyone's
been friends with Branner."
The game has provided both a study break
and a social venue for a lot of students.
"It's week eight, and everyone's kind of
stressed," said Brian Wang 4 10."It's a good way to
divert attention and show some dorm pride."
"I like it because you get to really engage with
people, as opposed to just playing a game by your
self." added Jeff Chern' 10,Toyon commander.
The game originated with Gabe Smedres
man, a student at Yale, where it took the campus
by storm in Jan. 2007. Then called "Old Campus
Tree Risk," it migrated to Harvard as "Harvard
Risk" for spring 2007. The code has evolved and
now rests in the hands of Harvard alums Matt
O'Brien and Andrew Fong, founders of Space
Capsule Games. The two then brought their po
tent procrastination tool to Stanford for winter

B ran ner/Toy on

quarter.
"Stanford seemed like the
next natural choice," said
O'Brien.

The game faced a difficult
transition, as Harvard and Yale operate Res
idential Houses and Colleges, respectively, which
provided natural teams and territories. Dividing
up Stanford's variety of housing options regfuijsd DE
some innovations.
"It was certainly a big challenge," said
O'Brien.
Teams have been organized along rough bor
ders. Some complexes, such as Wilbur, Stern and
Florence Moore, fight on their own, while Bran
ner/Toyon and Roble/Lag were unified, creating
the two largest power players.
Students quickly moved to appoint team com
manders, who had to coordinate strategies and
troop assignments for large groups of dorm
mates. Some have found the workload surprising
ly large, and commanders have taken to appoint
ing temporary replacements when they need
breaks.
"It's way more of an effort than I thought it
would be," Lyon said.
"I've not been sleeping much," added Chern.
As the fight progresses, the game's culture has
taken shape. Roble/Lag strategy sessions refer,
not too seriously, to tactics and maneuvers like
"The I lammer," "The Polish Rifle," "Brainz."
"The Frenchman" and "Stonewall Tram."Traffic
on dorm email lists has also increased as midnight
approaches, with exhortations from commanders

t O
fight on
despite long

odds and paper deadlines.
The game has prompted large outreach ef
forts within dorms, as teams rally to expand
their ranks.
"What everyone spends their time on is get
ting people to sign up," said Lyon. "I've been
going door-to-door trying to get busy upperclass
men to play."
"It's been a great way to get the whole campus
involved," added Young.
Also central to the concerns of players were is
: lstrt£>Nff 11 y
espionage. Holes in security for team communi
cations have led to teams intercepting troop
movements ahead of time.
"We've all been exploiting so many windows
of opportunity to one-up each other," Young said.
"And we've had successful espionage, which led
to Branner accusing me of some pretty outra
geous things."
"Some of which aren't true" he added.
While some have floated the idea of playing in
spring quarter, most students saw Turf as a natu
ral choice to become a yearly tradition, joining
other Stanford institutions like Secret Snowflake.
"Spring quarter maybe, but next year definite
ly," said Lyon. "It could be an annual thing that
dorms can rally around and get excited for."
Although the game has attracted enormous
energy, the players are doing their best to keep
their perspective.
"It's all in g(xxl fun," said Lyon. "There's no
prize except glory in the realm of online gaming."
"It's just a great way to procrastinate." he
added.
