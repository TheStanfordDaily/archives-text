## Habeas Gradeus: Students debate the sine qua non of law school 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
I aw school isn't known for being a particularly
joyful place, but the winter months can be es
pecially forbidding.
During December and January, first-year law stu
dents ("lLs") take their first exams and receive
their first grades. At most law schools,first-semester
grades are based entirely on one final exam that is
graded on a curve, with a set mean. At Stanford Law
School (SLS), the mean is 3.4. Inevitably, half of
these over-achievers — most of them accustomed to
the padded GPAs of liberal arts majors — will find
themselves below the mean.
Not surprisingly, during the weeks before exams
and again before grades are released, chaos ensues.
Stress-related illnesses are common (I developed a
twitch under my left eye that made me look less like a
law student and more like a patient at the Cirque
Lodge in Utah). Sleep is nonexistent. Alcohol is un
doubtedly abused.
But this fall at SLS,change was in the air.The facul
ty had begun to consider reforming the grade policy.
"Every summer 1 meet independently with every
faculty member," said Larry Kramer, dean of the law
school. "This past year I found that many of them were
commenting about the grading system and seemed to
agree that the law school should transition to a system
more like Yale's."
At Yale Law School, during the first semester all
classes are graded on a credit-failure basis. After that,
students are given a grade of honors, pass, low pass or
failure.There are no GPAs.
The prospect of a new grading system led many 1 Ls
like myself to entertain grandiose visions of a new type
of law school: one where we would learn for the sake
of learning, not for a grade; where we wouldn't con
stantly wonder if we could best fifty percent of our
classmates; where the weeks leading up to winter
break wouldn't be shrouded in a sense of impending
doom. Could it be true?
Not so fast. In the past few months, the push for
grade reform at SLS has slowed considerably. Students
and faculty point to several reasons, including student
opinions and a concern about the impact of grade re
form on study habits.
It turns out that not all students are in favor of the
change. 1L Mark Gaber. a member of the student liai
son committee on grade reform, is one of many stu
dents who prefer the traditional system.
"A lot of learning goes on in that crunch time before
exams," Gaber said. "Although you might be able to
pass by just going to class and doing the reading, the in
centive to do well on the exam pushes you to really

synthesize the material."
Gaber also expressed concern
about the message grade reform
would send to other law

schools.
"1 think it's a
little institu-

tionally

arrogant
to assume that
since we go to Stan
ford. we don't need
grades," Gaber said. "It might
insulate us from our peers at other
schools whom we will work with
throughout our entire careers."

Most students, however, still seem to support
reform.
"1 don't understand who wouldn't be in favor of
it,?" said IL. Matt Levy. "All of the students worked
hard to get here, and I think they will continue to work
hard whether or not they get a numerical grade."
The impact of grade reform on study habits unex
pectedly became the center of the debate when an un
precedented number of the 1L class — almost 25 per
cent — elected to take all of their first-semester class
es on a pass-fail basis. Many students believe that
choice led to below-average performance on exams,
and professors are now skeptical of grade reform.
Kramer, however, thinks that belief is unfounded.
"I heard nothing but positive remarks from the fac
ulty about the first-year class," Kramer said. "There is
no reason to believe that students who performed well
all semester decided not to study for their exams. Last
semester will not impact our decision on grade re
form."
1L Katrina Eiland, who took her classes pass-fail,
thought that it actually improved her study habits.
"I was better able to concentrate because I wasn't
so stressed about grades," Eiland said.
Eiland also dismissed another common fear that a
lack of grades will disappoint employers.
"Not one organization asked about my grades," Ei
land said. "They were only concerned with my resume
and writing sample. One employer told me that he as
sumed that since I went to Stanford I had the requisite
skills."
Ultimately, the decision will be made by an up-or
down faculty vote, and. if passed, it won't be imple
mented for some time.
"Even if the faculty votes this spring, a new system
would not be in place until fall 2009," Kramer said.
By that point, most members of the current 1L class
will already have jobs, based in part on their grades
from their first and second years. Time to get back to
studying.
