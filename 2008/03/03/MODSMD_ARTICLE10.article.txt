# Russia's NEXT PRESIDENT Dmitry Medvedev SCORES A CRUSHING VICTORY
## Power duo's evolving relationship will determine Russia's future

MOSCOW (AP) — As Russia's next president, Dmitry
Medvedev appears set to play good cop to Vladimir
Putin's bad cop.
Medvedev scored a crushing victory in Russia's presi
dential elections Sunday, taking more than 69 percent of
the vote with ballots from 80 percent of precincts count
ed. His victory was never in serious doubt once Putin
backed him in December.
The youthful lawyer has suggested he will ease some
of the repressive measures used to roll back democracy
under his predecessor, and seems likely to present a
friendlier face to the West.
But Putin, the stern former KGB officer who has ruled
Russia for the past eight years, is expected to remain by
his side as prime minister — and quite possibly still call
ing the shots.
Medvedev's main job will be to "rebrand" Russia, es
pecially for foreign investors, said Chris Weafer, chief
strategist at Ural Sib investment bank.
"He will try to change the perception of Russia from a
corrupt, inefficient country lacking legal protections to a
country more open for business," Weafer said.
The question is how mentor and protege will share
power and whether Medvedev's rise indicates a funda
mental shift in the Kremlin game plan,or is simply a pub
lic relations move.
Will Medvedev remain subservient to Putin after his
inauguration in May? Or will Putin fade into the shadows
once he is confident Medvedev has established control?
Putin also has left open the option of returning to the
presidency when elections are held in four years' time.
Some believe Putin could serve as the president's sen
ior adviser with strong influence over policy — reminis

cent of the role played by Vice President Dick Cheney in
the administration of President Bush.
Bush has himself expressed uncertainty about
Medvedev's role, although he says he does not expect
him to be Putin's puppet. He said it would be interesting
to see who represents Russia at the Group of Eight sum
mit in Japan in July. In the past, it has always been the
president.
It is possible that Putin himself does not yet know how
his role will evolve. In the coming months and possibly
years, how he and Medvedev share power will be closely
watched for signs of where Russia is heading.
During the Putin presidency, Medvedev diligently fol
lowed orders, whether as chief of staff or in recent years
as first deputy prime minister and chairman of the state
controlled gas behemoth Gazprom.
Demonstrating his loyalty, Medvedev based his cam
paign on a pledge to carry out "Putin's plan." Most Rus
sians support Putin, credited with bringing steady eco
nomic growth and expanding Russia's global influence,
and Medvedev has been eager to reassure them there will
be continuity.
But once Medvedev is installed as president, with
powers that include the right to fire his prime minister,
there is no way of knowing whether one day he might
turn on his mentor in a bid to concentrate real authority
in his own hands.
Medvedev in recent weeks has been speaking out in
unanticipated ways. Seeming to cringe at what he calls the
"disregard for the law" in Russia, he has talked about the
need for independent courts, a free press, protection of
private property and an end to the "extortionary" bribes
paid to officials by small business.
His pronouncement that "freedom is better than non
freedom" has been grasped at by some Russians dis
mayed by Putin's increasingly authoritarian rule.

But Medvedev's righteous indignation over corrup
tion and curbs on freedoms clashes with his record. He
worked closely with Putin as the Kremlin used compliant
courts to silence opponents and take over companies
whose owners failed to show sufficient loyalty.
He voiced support for the closing of independent tel
evision networks and other measures that strengthened
the Kremlin's political control.
At OAO Gazprom, he helped to restore state control
over the gas monopoly, the heart of what has become
known as Kremlin Inc. Russia has been accused of using
Gazprom to put political pressure on neighboring coun
tries that depend on it for their gas supplies.
Under Putin, the Kremlin was focused on regaining
the strategic sectors of the economy, including its energy
and armaments industries. Foreign firms have been
forced to relinquish control over major oil and gas proj
ects.
But with raw materials still accounting for the bulk of
Russia's exports, Putin has said that Russia needs to di
versify its economy and modernize its manufacturing to
maintain growth.
To do so Russia must improve its investment climate,
and this is where Medvedev seems to come in.
However, Russia's liberals have dismissed the notion
that Medvedev might about bring a thaw as naive.
"This rhetoric is just for stupid foreigners," said
Vladimir Ryzhkov, a liberal who lost his seat in parlia
ment when the Kremlin changed electoral laws,effective
ly excluding independents.
"Look around: There is no thaw and there will be
none," Mikhail Kasyanov.a former prime minister, wrote
recently in one of the few remaining independent news
papers. He was excluded from Sunday's race on a techni
cality in what was widely regarded as part of the Krem
lin's effort to ensure Medvedev faced no real challenge.
