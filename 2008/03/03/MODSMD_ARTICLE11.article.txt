GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” The Palestinian
president suspended peace talks Sunday as Israel brushed
off international criticism and vowed to press ahead with
its Gaza offensive until militants halt rocket attacks.
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said an even
broader Gaza operation was possible, aimed at crushing
militant rocket squads but also to "weaken the Hamas
rule, in the right circumstances, even to bring it down."
TTic Palestinian death toll rose by 26, bringing the num
ber killed to 114 since the latest bout of fighting erupted
on Wednesday according to Palestinian medical officials
and militant groups. At least 54 Palestinians and two Is
raelis were killed on Saturday, the single deadliest day in
more than seven years of fighting.
The Gaza onslaught has failed to protect southern Is
rael. where residents have faced repeated rocket attacks
since 2(X)1. Gaza militants fired more than 25 rockets at
southern Israel Sunday, the military said, scoring direct
hits on houses in the city of Ashkelon and the town of

Sderot. Nine Israelis were injured, rescue services said.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said peace talks
with Israel had been halted.
"For the time being, the negotiations are suspended
because we have so many funeralshe said. It was unclear
when the talks, relaunched last November at a U.S.-host
ed summit, would resume.
I"he violence clouded an upcoming visit by Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice.
The Israeli and Palestinian leaders have set a Decem
ber target for concluding a final peace deal. But instead of
promoting peace. Rice will likely spend her visit this week
trying to put out the latest fire.
The Bush administration demanded a halt to the fight
ing.
"The violence needs to stop and the talks need to re
sume," Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National
Security Council, said in Texas.
In the early hours of Monday, Palestinians counted nine
separate Israeli airstrikes all over Gaza, and five Hamas
militants were killed. One attack was near the office of
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, who was not in the
area at the time. The Israeli military said aircraft targeted
weapons storage and manufacturing facilities.
Before midnight, Israel had moved additional ground
forces and armored vehicles into northern Gaza, widen
ing its area of operation to about a mile, witnesses and
Palestinian security officials said. Also, aircraft attacked
two metal workshops in northern Gaza, wounding 10,
they said.
The military said two weapons caches were hit and that
the troop rotations were routine. The Israeli ground
troops pulled out of northern Gaza before daybreak
Monday, the military said.

On Sunday, 11 Palestinians, including a 21-month-old
girl, were killed, and 10 others died of earlier wounds or
were found dead, Palestinian medical officials said.
Roughly half of those killed since Wednesday were
civilians, medical officials said. On Saturday, Palestinian
leaders called the killings "genocide" and a "holocaust."
"We are following the aggression against our people
in Gaza," Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told re
porters. He said he had contacted the UN. Security Coun
cil, the EU and Arab leaders "to work to stop this aggres
sion."
Abbas has wielded little influence in Gaza since Hamas
vanquished his forces and took over last June. In a symbol
ic move, he donated blood for Gaza residents at his West
Bank office.
The normally bustling streets of Gaza City were eeri
ly empty.The sound of verses from the Muslim holy book,
the Ouran, sounding from mosque loudspeakers mingled
with the roar of Israeli warplanes and unmanned drones
in the sky.
Hundreds gathered outside Gaza hospitals waiting for
bodies to be brought out of morgues for burial. Many, like
schoolteacher Tawfek Shaban.A 44-year-old father of five,
were holding small radios, listening to the news.
"Shame on the Arabs, shame on the Muslims, shame on
humanity ... When will they act to stop Israel?" Shaban
asked.
The reduced casualty count may have been the result
of new measures imposed by Hamas. It told its fighters to
use alleys for cover and avoid moving in large groups, or
dered schools closed and set up roadblocks to keep civil
ians out of battle zones. In recent days,schoolchildren had
left their studies to watch the fighting. Ihc order forced
children to stay at home.
