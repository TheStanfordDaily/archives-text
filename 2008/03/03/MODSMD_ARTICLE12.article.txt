## Row staff selection revised Co-op staffers say new group interview not beneficial 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
This year's Row house staff applica
tion process included a new step that
aimed to expose all applicants to all
houses. In the new process, prospective
Row staff applied to particular resi
dences, hut participated in group inter
views for all of the houses, due to a new
Residential Education policy. Current
staff interviewed rotating groups of
about a dozen candidates for three
hour stints, four nights in a row. The
new process allowed applicants to gain
exposure to other residences and later
express interest in additional houses to
which they did not originally. Row staff
then extended individual interviews to
selected candidates.
Though this process increased appli
cants' exposure to co-ops, several of the
houses are nonetheless struggling to
find staff.
Many self-op Row houses, including
Phi Sig, Bob and Mars, had vastly more
applicants for staff positions than many
co-ops, which meant that self-op appli
cants outnumbered their co-op coun
terparts in group interviews.
Stanford co-ops differ from self-ops
in that co-op residents are responsible
for the house's cooking and cleaning,
while self-op residents have a hired
cooking and cleaning staff.
Co-op house managers in houses
such as EBF and Kairos were confident
they had a good selection of qualified
applicants, but staff in Terra worried
that despite the new interview sys
tem. their applicant pool was small
er than last year and it looked like
they would lack a Residential
Computing Consultant (RCC)
"1 think we had one applicant for
RCC. but 1 think he was applying to
all Row houses," said current Terra
RCC Amanda Christian 08. "We've
asked other co-ops to tell any co-op
minded RCC applicants we would
like to interview them."
Justine Seidenfeld 'OS, a fellow
Kairos staffer, said that in theory,
introducing all applicants to all

house staff allowed co-op staff to
recruit more potential applicants.
"If you see someone during the
interviews who you think would
make a good candidate for your
house, you could invite them to an
individual interview," she said, as
applicants could potentially
approach a staff member of a house
where they had not applied and
arrange an interview with them.
Co-op staff nonetheless
expressed dismay that many partici
pants in the group interview process
were not interested in living in a co
op.
"It would have been helpful if
they had had a separate group inter
view process for co-ops," said
Seidenfeld, who is the Kairos
kitchen manager. "There were times

when everyone would introduce
themselves and list the houses they
were applying to. and there would
n't be anyone in the group applying
to a co-op."
EBF kitchen manager Ruth
Levine *08 estimated that only
about five percent of total appli
cants applied to both co-ops and
self-ops, and the majority of partici
pants in the group interview process
were only interested in self-ops.
"It's a waste of our time to sit for
three hours to hear from applicants
not applying to co-ops." she said. "1
don't want to hear the life story of a
sophomore applying to Bob when I
need to be studying for midterms."
