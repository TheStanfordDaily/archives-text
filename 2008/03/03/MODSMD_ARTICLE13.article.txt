## Row kitchens face health inspections 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some Row house staff are facing a
different kind of midterm in the com
ing weeks — every quarter, the state
of California sends a health inspector
to check up on the kitchens at all Row
houses.
"Our main job as kitchen managers
is to make sure the house kitchen is
clean, safe and sanitary." said Niko
Malkovich "08. a kitchen manager at
Casa Italiana. "But sometimes, even if
what we were doing before was per
fectly sanitary, we still have to jump
through some hoops to meet state reg
ulation."
Kerry Ann Hamilton, a health
inspector for Santa Clara
Environmental Health, makes the
rounds to all Stanford residential
houses every quarter. After marking
any kitchen violations during the fall
quarter visit, Hamilton projects a ball

park date when she will visit the
kitchens again during Winter Quarter.
Malkovich said Hamilton's projected
date was Feb. 25, so he expects Casa
Italiana will be inspected this week.
Terra also expects its kitchen to be
inspected soon. Kitchen manager
Michael Peterson '07 said that usually
when inspectors report violations,
their complaints deal more with the
state of equipment in the kitchen than
kitchen management.
"Bob had its inspection in the fall,"
said Lane Barrasso '08, the Row
house's kitchen manager. "And the
results were fine: the big thing that she
really wanted us to get was sneeze
guards, which are for when someone
has to cough or sneeze while in the
food line."
Terra kitchen manager Mariel
Bailey '08 said Terra had to tidy up
after its kitchen's inspection. "They

told us we had too much trash out
side the back door," she said.
Other kitchen managers said
that while most inspections are fair
ly routine, inspectors have shut
down kitchens in the past if they did
not meet state regulations.
"1 heard that they really don't
like to close down kitchens," said
Nisha Vasavada '09, ZAP kitchen
manager. "Kerry was a pretty nice
and cooperative inspector. I imag
ine a kitchen would have to be real
ly bad for her to close it down."
Peterson remembers that the
EBF kitchen was closed in the past.
"It was in the 2004-2005 school
year," Peterson said. "The health
inspector then came in multiple
times, and each time the kitchen
was too messy, so she decided to
close the kitchen."
Asked what alternatives exist
for a house without a kitchen.
Peterson said. "I'd think that their
only other option is to get take-out,
and that's very expensive."
