### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University's Web sites will be
undergoing major changes in months to
come, focusing mainly on design changes
and content overhaul. Hie finalized version
of the project is set to launch around mid-
June 2C)08.
Project 8180 is the codename for a effort
aiming to redesign the Stanford University
homepage and Web sites for the Offices of
Undergraduate Admission, Financial Aid,
and Visitor Information. Scott Stocker, the
director of web communications at
Stanford, said "8180" refers to the total
acreage of the Stanford campus and reflects

the project's mission to include all aspects
of University life.
Proposed changes can be viewed at

stressed that the team wants students and
faculty members to provide feedback by
leaving comments on the Web site.
"By early April we hope to have full
color mockups that we hope students will
look at," said Stocker.
The project is co-sponsored by the Office
of University Communications and the
Office of Undergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid. The project began last
November, and Stocker explained that it
aims to create a more consistent aesthetic
online that will unite all aspects of the uni

versity. In the new Web site, for example,
the Admissions Web site for the first time
will have the same format as other Stanford
web pages.
Content categories on the SU
Homepage will be altered, with the naviga
tion bar going from eight categories to five.
"About Stanford," "Admission,"
"Academics," "Research" will stay; "Life on
Campus" will be added; and the current cat
egories "Medical Center,"
"Administration," "Arts & Events," and
"Athletics" will be removed. Stocker said
the change will help users locate informa
tion on specific departments and programs
more efficiently.
The Web site is planned to emphasize the

newer initiatives of the University, such as
the Stanford Challenge, as well as including
more features about research on campus
and student life.
The homepage also will have a special
section at the bottom called "On the
Stanford Web," where selected Web sites
from across the university will be highlight
ed.
The latest changes to the site will also
reflect Stanford's importance in the world
of technology. Though specific plans are still
being ironed out, Stocker said the redesign
will showcase Stanford's involvement to the
development of the Internet and the web
