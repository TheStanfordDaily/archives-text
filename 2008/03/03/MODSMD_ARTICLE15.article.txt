The student found his name on the
Web site beside a rambling, filthy pas
sage about his sexual exploits, posted
by an anonymous student on campus
The young man could only hope the
commentary was so ridiculous nobody
would believe it.
"1 thought. Is this going to affect
my job employment? Is this going to
make people on campus look at me?
Are people going to talk about me
behind my back?" said the student,

wondered about his 11 -year-old sister,
who is spending more time on the

Juicy Campus' endless threads of
