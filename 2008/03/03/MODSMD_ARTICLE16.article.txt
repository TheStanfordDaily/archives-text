## Editorial Board ASSU executive slate evaluation 
### 
Last year, the ASSU executive election
was decided by a total of 38 student
votes, and a subsequent vote by the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) in a run-off between
the top two slates. Ultimately, llershey
Avula and Mondaire Jones won the execu
tive jobs in an election rife with controversy.
They took office promising to restore the
credibility of the ASSU through advocacy
work and the creation of large-scale social
events on campus.
Before the year began. Avula/Jones start
ed work on large-scale social events through
their summer party initiative. I"he ASSU
threw two parties over the summer in hopes
of creating a more social campus-wide at
mosphere during the months when few are
on campus. These parties were relatively
successful, though we question whether or
not it is the ASSU's place to throw parties
over the summer when most people paying
for it are not present.
The party theme continued with the re
vived Mausoleum party and the Big Party
before Big Game. Both enhanced the credi
bility of the ASSU in its ability to hold large
scale social events — these parties were
hugely successful. This year's version of
Mausoleum party went without some of the
problems from last year's, so the lower
turnout can be at least partially attributed to
the fact that it was held in the middle of the
week. Big Party, while not the Big Game
bonfire the electorate had been promised,
was a good substitute. No one really "in the
know" thought the bonfire was going to hap
pen anyway, and Big Party demonstrated
impressive coordination between many
groups on campus. There is no doubt that
Avula/Jones come through with campus so
cial events.
One of the first advocacy successes for
the pair was to revitalize the course guide on
Axess. Now students can see the results from
the evaluations that each student must take
at the end of a quarter. Students have been
asking for this service since it was shut down
in 2005 due to poor quality. Avula/Jones
even went a step further working with the
creators of Courseßank, which is a site
where students can find more relevant feed
back about student experiences in a certain

class.
Yet. there are other advocacy issues
where the executives have not been so suc
cessful. The University is still refusing to pro
vide health care to dependents of graduate
students. This issue was a large part of the
Avula/Jones campaign, and the pair won a
large percentage of the graduate student
vote. I lowever. most of the successes of this
administration are clearly geared towards
undergraduates. The executive team is sup
posed to represent all students on campus
and the differences between undergraduate
and graduate student concerns need to be
reconciled more fairly.
One service that Avula/Jones has provid
ed both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents is the ASSU airport shuttle. Despite a
somewhat rocky start during the spring trial
run.the shuttle program has grown to just
over 800 patrons with more expected over
spring break. There is also talk of starting a
return shuttle service from the airport. This
program has given students a more conven
ient option than public transportation and a
cheaper alternative to Super Shuttle.
The final measure of the executive team's
success is the response to students. In this,
Avula/Jones faces a tough task: student sen
timent is hard to track and even harder to re
spond to. 1 lowever. they have made some
concrete changes based on response to stu
dent voices. Through advocacy efforts, the
pair has worked with the Axe & Palm to in
crease its vegetarian and vegan options. The
Axe & Palm is still finding it hard to com
pete for the hearts and minds of students in
the shadow of its predecessor, the C'oHo, but
the recent addition of crepes to the menu
has many students smiling.
Overall, this executive slate has delivered
on its promises and goals. A tense election
season seems to have brought more ac
countability to this team, and Avula/Jones
has brought back more credibility to the
ASSU. But there is still much more work to
be done; as this election season kicks off with
seven executive slates, we hope these candi
dates look to build on the work that has been
done. The slates should look to run with a
platform of concrete, realistic changes that
will better serve the students with a particu
lar eye towards graduate student needs.
