## The 						breakfast club 
### 
Remember those action-packed TV
commercials advertising breakfast
foods back when we were younger?
Whether they were pushing toaster waffles or
some sugary cereal, they all had the same
mantra: "part of a complete breakfast," con
juring up images of a hearty three-course
meal. Maybe I don't notice these ads any
more because 1 don't really watch television
and am no longer susceptible to the whimsi
cal powers of Snap, Crackle and Pop. but I feel
as if that mantra doesn't hold up nowadays
anyway
Most of us don't have time for "complete."
Even a howl of cereal has become a luxury in
itself; the once convenient breakfast grain has
been sucked dry of its milk and compressed
into bite-able bars. Unfortunately, "part of a
convenient breakfast" just doesn't have quite
the same ring to it.
Has breakfasting become a dying art?
Whether or not breakfast is the most impor
tant meal of the day, it has certainly become
the most expendable. It's rare that you see
people arguing over the merits of dinner.
Because 1 have enjoyed eating breakfast
pretty much every day of my life, I am always
slightly aghast when I learn that many people
don't break the fast until lunchtime. I under
stand that for some, eating after waking up
can cause a feeling akin to morning sickness.
And that others have never eaten breakfast
and find it unnecessary Hut for a good major
ity of people (students or not), the issue of not
eating in the morning is directly correlated to
a lack of time. And that worries me.
As college students, we live in the kind of
culture where breakfast fare is more likely to
be eaten at night than in the morning. Late
night escapades to greasy-spoon diners for a
breakfast burrito, downing bowls of frosted
flakes for dinner when nothing else looks ed
ible at the dining hall,preparing an omelet for
a midnight snack in open kitchens. Even the
Axe & Palm's newly arrived crepes aren't of
fered until the hours of 6 p.m. and 2 a.m.
F.very morning we can make a bargain
with our body. I'll give you sleep instead of
food if vou don't fail on me, ok? We are all

aware of breakfast's nutritional value in fuel
ing our brains,preventing us from consuming
more calories throughout the day, helping us
maintain a good weight yadda yadda health
jargon. But we are tired.
Regardless of its nutritional value, eating
breakfast can lend itself to a certain kind of
ritual experience that might be just as impor
tant — if not more so — than the fuel it pro
vides. And that's what we deprive ourselves
of when we choose to blaze through the day
without stopping first.
On many mornings last year, my room
mate and I would curl up on our lumpy couch,
precariously balancing a bowl of Special K on
our legs as we hunched over our laptops.
While we slurped away at our soymilk
soaked cereal, we didn't even exchange many
words — I am a morning person and she is
not — yet there was something comforting
about starting every day together over a
shared meal.
After eating breakfast alone at the begin
ning of this year in my single, 1 later ventured
into the dining hall in search of friendly faces
and discovered another sort of morning ca
maraderie. I became a part of the breakfast
crew. Our bleary-eyed banter begets a bond
that doesn't occur during other meals of the
day.
Clad in plaid PJ pants or ratty robes with
hair akimbo, we are wrapped in the uninhib
ited intimacy of the morning. It is far too early
to put effort into filtering conversation. If
someone makes several bad puns, we will all
let it go. We may even giggle uncontrollably
for a minute.
There is an interesting sort of accountabil-

ity in eating with the same people
every morning. If someone's missing,
you notice. On some days, I can only
abstain from hitting my life-giving
snooze button again because of my
breakfasting friends — 1 wouldn't
want to be marked absent or miss an
other conversation on just how much
Family Circus sucks.
It's that slowed-down, ritual as
pect of the morning that also makes
me question the satisfaction of a
grab-and-go kind of breakfast.
Granted, eating something is better
than eating nothing, regardless of
whether it's an Egg McMuffin (ew) or
a hemp seed granola bar (ew again).
I'm not trying to champion the nu
clear family with a pert mom whip
ping up pancakes on the griddle, but
to me, there's something slightly de-

pressing about chucking a Nutri-
Grain bar at a kid before sending him
or her off to school. Or brainfreezing
yourself with a Jamba Juice fix in the
hurried minutes before class. The
world wants me to move faster than 1
can go. Eating breakfast is my way of
stopping the motion, even if just for
half an hour.
And so, dear reader, if you nor
mally wake up five minutes before
you hike to lecture. I urge you try
breakfasting just once in the near fu
ture. Wake up earlier for yourself, not
for class. Start the day off slowly.
Savor what's ahead of you, as over
whelming as it may be. Make friends
with an early bird. You might even
catch a worm or two.
