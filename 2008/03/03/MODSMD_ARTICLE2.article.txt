# Farm may host FCC debate
## Controversial forum held at Harvard might get a second chance at Stanford 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) joined Comcast
and Verizon for a hearing on "net
neutrality" last Monday at Harvard
University, sparking a firestorm of
controversy when the cable giant
admitted to hiring people to fill seats
at the event. Now. the FCC might be
taking a second stab at hosting a
forum — this time at Stanford.
Jordan Golson, the journalist for
blog Valley Wag.com who broke the
news about the potential Stanford
hearing, told The Daily that his
source was someone from within the
FCC. He added that the hearing is
not confirmed, but that the FCC is
considering the possibility of hosting
the event on the Farm, with Comcast
and Verizon again attending.
"I heard from a source who has
knowledge of the situation." Golson
said. "We are confident in the quality
of the information."
However, this news comes as a
surprise to many at Stanford. Both

Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig, founder
of Stanford Law School's Center for
Internet and Society (CIS), and
Executive Director of the CIS
Lauren Gelman were unaware of any
such event. Neither had been con
tacted by the FCC or Comcast.
Net neutrality is the principle that
Internet users should be in control of
what content they view and what
applications they use on the Internet.
Last year. The Associated Press
revealed that Comcast — the largest
cable television company and the
second largest Internet service
provider in the United States — was
secretly limiting customers' Internet
traffic for certain services, such as
peer-to-peer file sharing.
The Harvard hearing was part of
the FCC's ongoing investigation into
Comcast's regulation of Internet
traffic. Comcast spokeswoman
Jennifer Khoury publicly admitted
that Comcast had paid some people
to arrive early for the hearing in
order to hold places for Comcast
employees who wanted to attend the
hearing.

According to the Web site
PCWorld.com, a computer magazine,
many of those people attended the
meeting and took places that would
otherwise have gone to members of
the public. Some even fell asleep.
Reports suggest that up to 100 mem
bers of the public were not able to
attend because the event was full
with those who had been paid to sit
there.
Timothy Karr, campaign director
of Savethelnternet.com, a coalition
that works to preserve net neutrality,
issued a public statement voicing his
opinion of Comcast.
"First, Comcast was caught blocking
the Internet," he wrote. "Now it has
been caught blocking the public from
the debate. The only people cheering
Comcast are those paid to do so.
Clearly, Comcast will resort to just
