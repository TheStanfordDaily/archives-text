# Sick Sad World
## Thrown to the urban wolves 
### 
In the last four years. I have suckled hard
and fast on the teat of Ihe Stanford Expe
rience. In the name of an elite education. I
have talked with the President of Latvia,
swum with seals, and bathed naked in hot
springs at a monastery. My experiences are
not unique: I know people who have been
flown to China, held video-conferences with
Audi reps and photographed penguins in
Antarctica, all on the Stanford dollar.
Yet as 1 look back on a recent adventure. I
find myself facing a cruel reality: Although
Stanford may excel at grooming its under
graduates to comfortably prowl the world of
privilege, there is one area in which our urban
brethren — Berkeley, Columbia and the like
— have us trumped: The Farm is quite possi
bly the worldis worst place to learn street
smarts and urban savvy.
I came to this conclusion after spending
Spring Break in Berlin in order to finish a re
search project from last summer. I forgot to
outline housing in my budget, so I crashed at
my friend Sarafs for a few days. This would
have been super if Sara lived in one of those
historic European apartments, with ox-eye
windows and faux-rococo molding along the

tops of the walls. However, Sara lived in a con
verted cement factory with 14 of her artist
type friends. When I explained my living situ
ation to my Berkeley friends, every one of
them asked me if I was bringing pepper spray.
Ihis should have been a clue.
When 1 arrived at the commune,a group of
five members were just on their way out. Car
rying large, plastic bags, they told me that they
were going bottle-hunting. My hosts ex
plained that they needed the recycling money
to buy dinner and iskag.i
I consider my German to be pretty good,
but I had no idea what iskagi was — all I
could tell was that my hosts seemed infinitely
more concerned about buying iskagi than eat
ing that night. I figured iskagi was some type

of expensive art supply. I was excited to watch
them work with iskagi and maybe take some
new artistic knowledge back with me to the
United States.
About two hours later, the artist-types re
turned with their groceries. Eagerly wanting
to bond, I asked to see the iskag.i One of the
men in the group, Freddy, a late-20-something
with mini conch shells weaved into his dread
locks, laughed and pulled out a zip-lock bag
with a box of baking soda, a test tube and
some stuff in little bottles. 1 asked in German
if iskagi was like papier-mache. Everyone gig
gled. This is when I finally began to get un
comfortable.
1 watched as Freddy brought out some
taupe-colored powder, and began an elabo
rate series of mixing it with the liquid in the
little bottles, then the baking soda, then again
with more stuff in little bottles.The bottom of
a coke can came out from someonei's pocket,
then the Bunsen burner that earlier weid used
to make tea was turned on. Freddy took off
his belt and looped it around his arm. I finally
got it: iSkagi meant heroin. I was about to

watch a circle of junkies get their fix.
1 remember during my freshman
year at Stanford, people in my dorm
went nuts when some people made a
gravity bong in the courtyard. They
said that they could smell the smoke
and that they were allergic to pot.
What would they do if they found
themselves in my situation — stuck
in a junky circle in an abandoned
factory in Berlin?
The bucolic setting of our school
is ideal for incubating us against the
harsh realities of life. As a tour
guide. 1 push our isolation as a huge
selling point for protective parents. I
like that my biggest fear at 3 a.m. on
a Friday is that 5-SURE will take
forever and 1 might have to walk the
10 minutes home in the California
cold.
However, at the moment when 1
found myself stranded on a foreign
continent with artist-hobos cooking
up heroin in front of me. 1 sort of
wished that 1 had experienced some
thing comparable in the safe and fa
miliar confines of The Farm.

Obviously, 1 am not saying that
people should do more hard drugs at
Stanford. It is just a reality that Stan
ford students are kept blessedly un
aware of lifei's realities, while my
friends at Columbia had their RAs
warn them about pushers during
week one of school.
I still think that our isolation from
the real world, accurately referred to
as the Stanford Bubble, is a precious
and delightful part of The Stanford
Experience. The Bubble encircles
everything. It has followed me
around the world, keeping me safe in
Latvia and warm in the Rocky
Mountains. The Bubble has let me
keep my innocence far longer than
even my parents thought possible.
It's just that as 1 look back on my
time at Stanford, 1 wonder how dif
ferent it would have been if I had ex
perienced everything with my
newly-opened eyes. Certainly
Poland would have seemed less
cheery. I suppose that after a few
weeks back in the Bubble, this ques
tion will fade away from my mind,
but right now all I can think about is
how I thought that heroin was papi
er-mache.
