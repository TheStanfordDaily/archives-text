Educational equity not so simple
To the Editor,
Kai Stinchcombe's article (" The Left
Coast: Next steps for equal access to educa
tion," Feb. 28] frames the argument for educa
tional equity in overly simplistic terms, reveal
ing a fundamental lack of understanding of the
complexities of genuine diversity, while posing
a set of solutions that are neither feasible nor
appropriate.
Stinchcombe's misguided opening state
ment sets the tone for the poorly-researched
article. While Stanford's new financial aid pol
icy does deserve the praise it has received, ad
mission to the University still remains selec
tive; providing greater and more nuanced fi
nancial assistance to students is not the harbin
ger of lower standards yet to come. With this in
mind, then, the tacit assumption that lower-in
come students will need remedial sessions

prior to enrollment undermines the intention
of the policy, which is to acknowledge that
lower-income students have performed and
will continue to perform well academically.
Conceding that such students "may have the
same underlying ability... even though their
scores don't show it" adds an extra layer of pa
ternalistic insult to the already injurious notion
that certain students are admitted in spite of
(and not because of) their previous academic
performance.

To the Editor:
7\vo recent columns in the Daily have given
an entirely incorrect impression about the

process for discussion and consideration of the
possible expansion of the size of Stanford's un
dergraduate class. As co-chairs of the task
force responsible for considering this issue, we
felt we should correct the record as well as
state the critical importance of the student
community's broad participation in this
process.
From the very first time the subject was
raised by President I lennessy during the fall
quarter in Stanford Magazine, it has been
clearly stated that this would be an inclusive
process involving as many members of the
Stanford community as possible.The first step
in establishing this process came late last year
when President Hennessy appointed a task
force with student, faculty, staff and trustee
representation. The task force has now met
twice and an integral part of its work thus far
has been to create a structure that ensures
