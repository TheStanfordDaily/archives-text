Educational equity not so simple
To the Editor,
Kai Stinchcombe's article (" The Left
Coast: Next steps for equal access to educa
tion," Feb. 28] frames the argument for educa
tional equity in overly simplistic terms, reveal
ing a fundamental lack of understanding of the
complexities of genuine diversity, while posing
a set of solutions that are neither feasible nor
appropriate.
Stinchcombe's misguided opening state
ment sets the tone for the poorly-researched
article. While Stanford's new financial aid pol
icy does deserve the praise it has received, ad
mission to the University still remains selec
tive; providing greater and more nuanced fi
nancial assistance to students is not the harbin
ger of lower standards yet to come. With this in
mind, then, the tacit assumption that lower-in
come students will need remedial sessions

prior to enrollment undermines the intention
of the policy, which is to acknowledge that
lower-income students have performed and
will continue to perform well academically.
Conceding that such students "may have the
same underlying ability... even though their
scores don't show it" adds an extra layer of pa
ternalistic insult to the already injurious notion
that certain students are admitted in spite of
(and not because of) their previous academic
performance.

Expansion task force embracing
openness
To the Editor:
7\vo recent columns in the Daily have given
an entirely incorrect impression about the

process for discussion and consideration of the
possible expansion of the size of Stanford's un
dergraduate class. As co-chairs of the task
force responsible for considering this issue, we
felt we should correct the record as well as
state the critical importance of the student
community's broad participation in this
process.
From the very first time the subject was
raised by President I lennessy during the fall
quarter in Stanford Magazine, it has been
clearly stated that this would be an inclusive
process involving as many members of the
Stanford community as possible.The first step
in establishing this process came late last year
when President Hennessy appointed a task
force with student, faculty, staff and trustee
representation. The task force has now met
twice and an integral part of its work thus far
has been to create a structure that ensures
maximum participation and thorough
discussion among members of the
Stanford community.
To that end, the task force will soon
begin a process of outreach that will
continue throughout spring quarter
— and longer if necessary. We expect
these conversations to identify the
pros and cons of expansion as well as

the impact on Stanford's academic,
residential and social life should such
an expansion be pursued. This out
reach effort will include public meet
ings, discussions with faculty, and arti
cles in The Daily and Stanford Report.
We are also contemplating the use of
technology as a way of gathering addi
tional input from interested members
of the Stanford community
It should be noted that when Pres
ident Hennessy initiated this discus
sion last year, he raised a number of is
sues that would need to be addressed
should Stanford move forward with

any such plan, among them:
• How would we ensure that we main
tain the small classes and seminars
for undergraduates?
•Where would the resources come
from to maintain the faculty-to-stu
dent ratio?
• Where would we house the addi
tional students and how would we fi
nance new housing?
• How would we provide the addi
tional financial aid to ensure that
Stanford remains need-blind?
These are just a few of the issues in
which we hope to engage the Stanford
community as we begin our discussions.
We know others will be raised and we
look forward to creating useful forums
for good interactive discussions.
While President Hennessy has indi

cated a desire to have a report from the
task force sometime in the fall quarter,
he understands that the work may ex
tend beyond the fall term and supports
a longer timeline. He recognizes the se
riousness of the question at hand and
the critical importance of hearing from
as many people as possible before any
final decisions are made.
This is a conversation that will have
a serious impact on the future of our
university and we do not take it light
ly. We all have a stake in the outcome
of that conversation and we look for
ward to your engagement in the
process.
