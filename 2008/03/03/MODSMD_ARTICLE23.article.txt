"To win three from a strong oppo
nent is huge for us." head coach Mark
Marquess said. "This was a big week
end for us. The weather was great and
we played well. We gave them a lot
with pitching, used a lot of guys that
didn't have much experience, but we
got the job done."

put a run on the scoreboard first when

JEFF KFACHER/The Stanford Daily
Senior first baseman Randy Molina hit the first home run of his career in the first of three Stanford wins
over Cal State Fullerton this weekend. The Cardinal won on Friday and Saturday by wide margins
and held on to take the rubber game with a tie-breaking RBI double in the eight inning yesterday.
back up. and the game ended with a
Cardinal victory after eight and a hall
innings with a score of 12-5.
Fullerton took a similar beating on
Saturday afternoon, when the Titans
were out-hit by the Cardinal. 15-7. As
in the first game. Stanford racked up
four runs in the first inning. I lowever,
the Titans came prepared for Stan
ford's early attacks and cut the lead in
half in the fifth.
Stanford's pitcher, senior Erik
Davis, allowed two unearned runs
when Fullerton's Jeff Newman and
Josh Fellhauer had back-to-back sin
gles to make it on base and the next
hitter. Christian Colon, hit a grounder
to Davis, who overthrew the ball to
Molina at first.
Stanford extended its lead after
the Titan threat by earning four more
runs in the fifth and adding an un
earned run in the sixth.The Titans ral
lied in the seventh to close the gap to
9-7 when Stanford senior reliever
David Stringer hit the first two batters
and walked the third batter to load the
bases.
Freshman Alex Pracher came in
to nail down two outs, but allowed
five runs to score. It was freshman
Drew Storen who finally closed out
the inning, recording his first colle
giate save by getting seven straight
outs. Junior Sean Ratliff would con
clude Stanford's offensive outing by
hitting a clutch two-out. RBI home
run. his first of 2008, to bring the final
score to 11-7.
Sunday's nailbiter was truly a team
effort as it took eight pitchers, multi
ple hits from five different players and
five lead changes to finally sweep the
Titans. The game was scoreless until
the bottom of the third when Jones hit
a single to left field and was brought in
by junior Cord Phelps' two-out RBI
single to center.
Fullerton's bats heated up in the
fourth after two outs when Stanford's
first relief pitcher, sophomore Cory

Bannister, walked Dustin Garneau
and Jeff Newman. Fullerton's Gary
Brown hit a two-RBI double to right
field, hut stole an extra hase due to an
error on the relay throws to home.
Bannister got out of the jam after
Colon urounded out with the score to
2-1.
Stanford would rally hack in the
sixth when Ratliff led off the inning
with a double to center followed by
Castro's third home run of the sea
son, bringing the score to 4-2 in favor
of the Cardinal. It then took three
Stanford pitchers to end the seventh
inning. Fullerton's Brown started off
the inning with his first collegiate
homerun to left field which was fol
lowed by a pair of singles by Colon
and Fellhauer. The Titans fell just
one batter shy of making it around
their batting order and added a run in
the eighth to take the lead at 5-4.
From the eighth inning on, the
game was all Stanford.The Cardinal
settled their pitching by bringing in
Ratliff from center field to pitch two
scoreless innings. Ratliff hadn't
pitched in a game since his fresh
man year in 2006 and he exited the
field pumping his fist after the last
fly out.
Sophomore Toby Gerhart began
the eighth inning with a single shot to
left field which tied the game at 5-5,
but it would be Jones scoring Whitlow
with a double to win the game, 6-5.
"Nine [Marquess] always asks us
to get the job done," Ratliff said. "Al
though I didn't have much time to
warm up. you just have to let your
adrenaline take over and let your stuff
do the rest to get the job done.
"I low better to get job done than a
solo bomb to tie in the eighth? We bat
tled all day. We had easv wins with the

hats on Friday and Saturday, but today
we played from behind and had to
overcome adversity to get the job
done."
"Today's game was a nip and tuck
game where Fullerton was fighting for
their lives" Marquess said. "'A school
where you have such a rich baseball
tradition is hard to beat anytime. I was
more impressed with us offensively in
today's game because we had to bat
tle. We had some big hits, then we
would get behind and then we would
retake the lead. But I'm glad that we
were able to finally win in the bottom
of ninth."
Stanford will need this momentum
as the team has a tough week ahead.
The Cardinal will head to Berkeley to
morrow to take on California and
then Moraga, Calif., on Wednesday to
face St. Mary's. The last series before
final exams will be against Texas in
Austin.
"St. Mary's is a great ball club and
we have a little rivalry from region
als." Ratliff said. "It is always great to
go to Moraga. They have loud fans
that hate you and it's a great environ
ment for baseball. We always hate
playing at Cal because it gets so
windy. Both the games on Tuesday
and Wednesday should test us."
"We get another good test like
this series right before we break for fi
nals." Marquess said."Texas is difficult
to play anytime, especially at Texas.
TTiis will help us find out where we are.
Texas just lost two games so they
won't be happy which means they'll
be ready to go when we get there. It
should be fun. but it should be diffi
cult."
