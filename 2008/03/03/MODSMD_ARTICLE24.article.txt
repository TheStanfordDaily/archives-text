'ITie No. 9 Stanford men's volley
ball team added another win to its cur
rent four-game streak last Friday,
bringing down Division-Ill's No. 2
ranked team, UC-Santa Cruz, in three
games: 30-21,30-16,30-21.
Santa Cruz is home to some of the
smaller and older gyms among west
coast schools, with hard floors and
poor lighting, wheeled-in bleachers
and fans sitting on the floor and stand
ing against the walls, but the Cardinal
did hot let that affect its play.
"When you play in a small gym,
even a small crowd seems like a big
crowd," said freshman Garrett Dobbs.
"It did get loud, there was definitely a
lot of energy, a lot of heckling. But our
players did a good job of keeping cool
headed. staying consistent with play
ing."
Freshman outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin led the team with 12 kills at
an impressive .478 overall attack per
centage. Junior middle blocker Bran
don Williams wasn't far behind with
nine kills at a stellar .818 attack per
centage. while senior outside hitter
Matt Ceran and sophomore opposite
Evan Romero added nine and seven
kills, respectively.
The Cardinal tallied 51 kills to the
Banana Slugs' 30. Furthermore, the
Cardinal attack percentage did not dip
below .300 in any one of the three
games: the team hit .429 on the first
game. .357 on the second and .533 on
the third.
"Our hitting has been better be
cause our passing has been better in
practice and in games," said Ceran.
"We're more consistent as a unit."
Sophomore setter Kawika Shoji
had a team-high 42 assists. On de
fense, freshman libero Jordan Ina
fuku posted a team-high 11 digs.
Romero and McLachlin also con
tributed four digs each on the night.
The Cardinal held the Banana
Slugs to a low attack percentage the
entire match. In the second game,
Stanford held the Banana Slugs to
just four kills on 22 attempts, while
forcing 10 errors, for a -.273 attack
percentage.
The Cardinal had eight team
blocks,compared to 9.5 for the Slugs.
"One of their better qualities as a
team was blocking," said Dobbs. "We
dealt with that pretty well, attacking
the block and covering our hitters.
"Our blockers, on the other hand,
are doing a pretty good job taking
away areas of the court, so we're get
ting hit around a lot. which gives our
defense good chances of gettine the
ball."
The first game saw the Cardinal
play a few long rallies, committing
few errors on passing and attacking.
The Cardinal's consistency proved
too much for the Banana Slugs, and
Stanford took the game 30-21.
The team set the tone in the first
play of the second game after a dump
kill by Shoji.The Cardinal maintained
the momentum and the lead for the
rest of the game, closing it out, 30-16.
The third game saw the Banana
Slugs rally back late in the game, with
the score close in the 20s, but the Slugs
passed the ball over the net. and
Ceran responded with a definitive
closed-fisted kill. The Cardinal went
on to finish the game at 30-21, sealing
the win at 3-0.
Stanford returns to action this Fri
day when it travels south to face I .ong
Beach State.
