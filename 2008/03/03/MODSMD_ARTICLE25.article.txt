### REBECCA HARLOW DESK EDITOR 
In a nationally televised match-up, the
Stanford women's lacrosse team handed No.
10 Notre Dame its first loss of the season with
a 13-9 win yesterday at Laird O. Cagan Field.
The Cardinal had lost in overtime to the

Fighting Irish the last two years,but controlled
Sunday's game from the very beginning. Se
nior Megan McClain scored the first of her
four goals just one minute into the game and
trailed for only two and a half minutes in the
hour-long game.
Ihe win broke a two-game losing streak
for Stanford (4-2.2-1 MPSF) and halted Notre
Dame's undefeated opening to the season at
three games.
McClain and junior midfielder Jamie Nes
bitt both struck in the first two minutes of the
game, but the Fighting Irish responded goal
for-goal to tie at two apiece. Freshman mid
fielder Karen Nesbitt scored the first of her

two goals ten minutes later, before Notre
Dame took its first lead with two goals in just
30 seconds.
Freshman attacker Sarah Flynn. who
ended the game with a hat trick, made it 4-all,
but the Irish again took the lead at 5-4.1 low
ever, in the final 11 minutes of the first half, the
Cardinal exploded with back to-back goals by
McClain, one by Flynn and another by sopho
more Dana Lindsay to give Stanford a com
manding lead. Notre Dame scored once more
in the half, cutting Stanford's lead to 8-6.
The Cardinal offense kept rolling after the
hulftime break, though, as sopho
more Bess Siegfried, Lindsay, Karen
Nesbitt and McClain all found the
net. Notre Dame did not score until
15 minutes into the half, but the
deficit was too big. After a 1 lvnn goal
put Stanford up 13-8. the Irish scored
once more for their final score of the
game.
Notre Dame took more shots than
the Cardinal, but senior Laura
Shane's stellar performance in goal
frustrated the Irish offense â€” she fin
ished with 17 saves.
'ITie Cardinal will be back in action
Wednesday afternoon against
Boston College and then host No. 8
Pennsylvania on Sunday to close out
its schedule for the quarter.
