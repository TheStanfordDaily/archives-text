GAME NO i [S. After coming in sec
ond at this weekend's conference
meet, the Cardinal women are now
setting their sights on the National
Championships. The divers will
need to qualify at the Zone E Diving
Championships in order to join the
rest of the team in Ohio. Last year

nation behind Auburn, Arizona and
California.

as usual.continued their winning tradition at the Pac-10
Championships, it was the divers who turped heads.
The Stanford divers not only claimed the win in two of
the three diving events, but also had the depth to rack
up valuable points for the team. Junior Sarah Ohr
earned her first postseason victory in the one-meter
competition to get the diving squad off on the right
foot.
"Winning the one-meter was an incredible way to
start off the meet," said Ohr.'lt gave me great momen
tum going into the other events. It was my best Pac-lOs
showing thus far and is a great boost going into
| NCAA] Zones.That's a whole new ball game though."
Freshman Meg I iostage led a strong Cardinal con
tingent by posting a Pac-10 title in the three-meter, fol
lowed closely by teammates sophomore Carmen Stel
lar. freshman llallie Ivester and Ohr. who finished
third, fourth and fifth, respectively.
Hostage also finished second in the
one-meter competition.
Despite such a strong showing, Ohr
did not let the success get to her head.
The divers still must perform well at
the NCAA Zone E Diving Meet on
March 13-15 to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
"Everyone did a great job this
weekend and ever)' single member of
the team has a very good shot at mak
ing NCAAs," Ohr said. "It is going to
come down to who shows up ready to
compete that day. ITiis is an exciting
year for us. having the potential to
qualify so many divers for NCAAs.
and I am thrilled to be a part of it."
Head diving coach Dr. Rick
Schavone agreed that the divers must
keep their heads in the game.
"It was obviously a very successful
meet for our divers." said Schavone.
"We had two divers final in all three
events, but we still have improvements
to make before the NCAA Zone E
Meet."
While the divers were dominating
the diving well, the swimmers were
doing their job in the pool. Sophomore
Elaine Breeden and freshman Kate
Dwelley led the Cardinal effort, each
winning one event. In perhaps the
most exciting race of the weekend,
Breeden out-touched Cal's Olympic
gold medalist Dana Vollmer for the
second time this season in the 200-yard
butterfly, breaking her own Stanford
record in the process.
"Dana [Vollmer] is one of my

toughest competitors and also one of
my oldest friends in swimming," Bree
den said. "We have been racing since
we were twelve, going back and forth
in the butterfly events ever since then.
Having an incredible swimmer like
Dana to race is the best thing 1 could
ask for. She continually pushes me to
explore new strategies and forces me
to race my best ever)' time we are in
the pool together."
Breeden's 2(H) butterfly time is cur
rently the fastest in the nation this sea
son. Breeden also finished second in
the 200 individual medley and third in
the 100 butterfly.
" Pac-10s is an awesome experience
because we have the whole team there
cheering every swimmer on and cele
brating every victory."she said."lt is so
much easier to swim fast and race hard
when you have 20 other people count
ing on you."
Dwelley took home a Pac-10 title in
her first-ever conference champi
onships in the 200 freestyle, making
her the second-fastest Stanford swim
mer of all time in that event. She also
placed second in the 500 freestyle and
eighth in the 100 freestyle.
The 200 medley relay team of jun
ior Fiona O'Donnell-McCarthy, fresh
man Liz Smith. Breeden. and senior
Brooke Bishop also made the books
by breaking a Stanford school record,
despite finishing second behind a
quick Arizona squad.
But the swimmers' success did not
stop there. Sophomore Julia Smit fin
ished in the top three in each of her
events â€” second in the 400 individual
medley and third in the 2(X) individual
medley and 2(K) backstroke. Smith and
junior Caroline Bruce finished second
and third, respectively, in the 200
breaststroke behind USC's Rebecca

Soni. who broke former Cardinal Tara
Kirk's ('O4) NCAA record. Smith cur
rently holds the nation's second
fastest time this season in that event
behind Soni. Bruce logged a third
place finish in the 100 breaststroke as
well.
Senior captains Bishop and Eliza
beth Durot both had strong showings
in their fourth and final Pac-10 meet.
Bishop finaled in all three of her indi
vidual events, with a fourth place finish
in the 50 freestyle, fifth in the 100 bac
kstroke and seventh in the 100 freestyle.
Durot moved herself up to the fifth
fastest Stanford swimmer ever in the
mile with her second place finish.
Other finalists for the Cardinal in
cluded junior Laura Wadden in the
200 backstroke and 2(H) butterfly, jun
ior Andrea Axtell in the 2(X) back
stroke, sophomore Whitney Spence in
the 200 and 500 freestyles and O'Don
nell-McCarthy in the 1(X) backstroke.
Coming out of Pac-10s. Breeden is
confident that the team is in a great po
sition going into the NCAA meet in
three weeks.
"I have no doubt that Stanford is
going to have an awesome meet at
NCAAs." Breeden said. "Everyone
did well despite not being rested this
weekend. This was a breakthrough
meet for several of my teammates,
and those achievements are going to
help motivate the team to continue
swimming well until the end of the sea
son.
"NCAAs is going to be a tough and
highly competitive meet, but we are
confident that we have put in the work
and that we will be ready when it
comes time to race."
