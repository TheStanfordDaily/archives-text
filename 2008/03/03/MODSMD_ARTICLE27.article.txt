Senior Mary Ratliff hit a walk off
three-run home run for the seventh
ranked Florida Gators (24-1) to power
them to a 4-3 victory over the No. 8 Stan
ford softball team (20-2) yesterday.
Hie Cardinal scored three runs — two
on bases-loaded walks — in the top of the
sixth to take a 3-1 lead,setting the stage for
Ratliff s heroics.
After a lead-off single and a walk,
Ratliff drove a 2-2 pitch over the left cen
ter field fence to end the game.
Stanford was playing its fifth game of
the Worth Classic in Fullerton, Calif. The
Cardinal had dominated its first four
games of the tournament, winning by a
combined score of 37-8. No team Stanford
played was nearly as good as the Gators,
however.
During the tournament junior pitcher
Missy Penna became only the second
Stanford pitcher ever to record 600 career
strikeouts.
The Cardinal managed only five hits
against Gator pitcher Stacey Nelson,
squandering the few opportunities Nelson
gave Stanford after she walked five bat
ters.
It was only the second loss in what has
been an extremely impressive season thus
far for the Cardinal. The other loss also
came in the last game of a tournament one
week ago to No. 25 Texas.
Head coach John Rittman was im
pressed with his team's performance over
the course of the weekend, but stressed
the need for Stanford to close out its final
games better.
"It was a tough loss. We have to be re
silient and figure out how to win close
games on Sundays," Rittman said.
Stanford can take some positives from
the weekend, though: especially its domi
nance in the first four games.
The Cardinal opened the tournament
Friday with a resounding 13-5 victory over
St..John's.

Stanford began the game with a bang
as sophomore center fielder Alissa Haber
hit her first of two home runs to lead off
the game for the Cardinal. Three batters
later, Michelle Smith hit a three-run blast
— her first of four home runs on the
weekend — to continue what would be
come a six-run first inning.
Sophomore second baseman Shannon
Koplitz also homered for the Cardinal,
while junior shortstop Maddy Coon filled
up the box score with four walks.a hit, two
runs scored and an RBI,
Freshman Ashley Chinn picked up the
victory in the circle, going 5.2 innings and
allowing just four hits and three runs.
Stanford picked up right where it left
off in the second game, run-ruling the
Louisville Cardinals, l )-1.
Sophomore catcher Rosey Neill home
red — as she would also do in the next two
games — and freshman first baseman
Melisa Koutz had two hits and four RBI to
lead the Cardinal offense.
Iliis was more than enough support for
Penna, who did not allow an earned run
while striking out 13 en route to her 12th
win of the season.
On Saturday Stanford swept another
doubleheader, taking the first game from
Texas Tech, 9-2, and the second from Pur
due, 6-0.
In the first game, the Cardinal de
stroyed Red Raider pitching to the tune of
15 hits including three home runs — one
each for Smith. Neill and senior left field
er Tricia Aggabao.
Coon and Smith each had three hits in
the win.
In the second game of the doublehead
er. Penna allowed just one hit and one
walk, while striking out ten in the com
plete game shutout.
With her second strikeout of the day
— a second inning punch-out of Purdue
right fielder Beth Cinadr — Penna
eclipsed the 600-strikeout plateau. The
only other Cardinal pitcher to ever reach
that total was three time All-American
