## Outreach to evaluate expansion Task force seeks reaction to increasing class size 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
ITie task force created to weigh the
pros and cons of expanding the fresh
man class will begin a formalized
spring outreach program to gauge the
perspective of the University commu
nity, said Senior Assistant to the

President Jeff Wachtel to 'ITie Daily
yesterday.
In his September 2007 column in
the Stanford Magazine, President John
Hennessy said that expanding the
freshman class would enhance the
diversity of the student body and per
mit Stanford to turn away fewer quali
fied students.
The committee, which has met twice
and plans to meet three times more,
has previously discussed the largest
hindrance to freshman expansion —
the lack of undergraduate housing, or

what Wachtel called the "stuffing prob
lem" — but will now look to students,
faculty, alumni and staff for input.
"Right now there is no predetermined
outcome about whether we are going
to do expansion or not." Wachtel said,
"so we are going to try to have a com
prehensive outreach."
The outreach program will be the
topic of discussion at the committee's
next monthly meeting. Wachtel said
there is not yet a formalized structure
for the program, but "public meet
ings and something with electronic
media" will be involved.
"We will talk about how to make
the outreach most effective," he said.
"We want to make sure we have a com
prehensive plan after the meeting."
Wachtel also said any expansion
of the freshman class will have to be
consistent with the University's

recent decision to increase financial
aid for middle- and lower-income
students.
"Financial aid is a given cost of
any expansion," he said. "The two go
hand in hand."
"We would have to anticipate a
significantly greater amount of the
aid we have announced ," he added,
hut did not comment further.
The committee's outreach pro
gram is anticipated to begin as soon
as spring quarter is underway.
