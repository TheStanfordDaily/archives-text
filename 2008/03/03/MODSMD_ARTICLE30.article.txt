### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
As time wound down in the first half against Washington
State yesterday, Stanford's senior guard Candice Wiggins
took the ball down the baseline, avoided a defender and,
once she crossed under the hoop, leaped and laid the ball in.
drawing a foul in the process
With that basket, Wiggins broke Lisa Ix'slie's Pacific-10
Conference career scoring record.
"1 think it's a great accomplishment," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We're all really happy for her. It
could not happen to a better person, a better basketball
player, a better leader."
The hype surrounding the occasion had been building
for weeks, ever since Wiggins broke Kate Starbird's Stan
ford career scoring record against Southern California in
late January and supporters realized that Leslie's mark was
in reach.
"This feat has been looming for a while," said Wiggins.
"I'm very happy."
But Wiggins paid it little mind along the way;instead,she
was focused on securing the Cardinal's eighth straight Pac
-10 regular season title.
"Today was just about playing." she said. "Sometimes
you try to do too much, but you have to let the game come
to you."
Wiggins entered the weekend series against WSU and
Washington needing 37 points to break Leslie's record. She
finished with 46, and now has 2,424 points for her career, 10
more than Leslie. She'll be able to add to her total in the Pac
lOTournament next weekend, and the NCAA Tournament
later in the month.
Wiggins led all scorers in both games, but was quick to
distribute credit for both the team's success and her own
personal accomplishment.
"Tara said this in the locker room,and it's true: I couldn't
be the player I am without the teammates I have," she said.
She pointed specifically to a sequence in the first half
when sophomore center Jayne Appel received a pass in the
key and. despite being left wide open for an easy layup.
threw the ball back to Wiggins, who was left alone beyond
the arc. Wiggins promptly knocked down one of her five
three-pointers on the day.
"TTiat's the unselfish play that I've been around," Wig
gins said. "I love playing for Stanford — I'm so proud."
That basket and her record-breaking layup were em
blematic of a superb weekend for Stanford's star, as Wiggins
dominated not onlv from inside the lanes, but from the

perimeter as well. I ier "performance earned her praise not
just from her coach and teammates,but from her opponents
as well.
"She's a great player and a great team leader," said WSU
guard Katie Appleton. "1 respect her a lot as a player."
The Cougars' coach June Daugherty, concurred:
"She's phenomenal. I'm so glad that we'll hopefully
never have to face her again, because she's that special of a
player."
Wiggins received her rightful accolades from tans as well.
After she nailed her free throw, the officials stopped time
momentarily as the crowd of WSU supporters and Cardinal
die-hards rose to their feet.The game ball was given to Wig
gins, who promptly handed it over to the Stanford bench.
Wiggins would have been afforded a longer celebration
— Stanford already had the game well in hand — but in
stead the ever-selfless senior headed right back to the court.
There was a game to be won.
