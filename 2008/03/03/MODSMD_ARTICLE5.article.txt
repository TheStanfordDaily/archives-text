# COMEBACK
## Card recovers from early 14-point deficit 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford started off slow before finishing strong in Saturday's 60-53 vie
tory over No. 22 Washington State, setting up a de facto Pac-10 title game
this Thursday at UCLA. But the game's trajectory was nothing new for

Taj Finger, Fred Washington. Peter Prowitt or Kenny Brown on Senior
Day. It was a perfect microcosm for their four years on the Farm.

Big man Brook Lopez started alongside those four seniors, and
though the projected top-five pick in this June's NBA Draft is only

a sophomore, it was almost assuredly his final home game too. He

certainly played like it. scoring I 1 ) of his 25 points in the second

half as Stanford tallied 43 of the game's final 65 points to crawl

out of a 31-17 first-half hole.
"1 just didn't want to let the seniors go out like that," said

Sophomore Robin Lopez drives over Washington State's Caleb Forrest in the second half of Stanford's come
back win in the Cardinal's last home game of the 2007-2008 season. Lopez finished the night with 11 points.
Lopez, who finished with 11-of-16 shooting, six re
bounds and four blocks. "We wanted to stay in the race
for a Pac-10 championship. 1 was just trying to go as hard
as 1 could possession by possession, score, get a stop,
score, get a stop."
He did just that when the game mattered most,
throwing down a dunk off junior guard Anthony Goods'
missed three to give Stanford (24-4. 13-3 Pac-10) the
lead for good, 54-53 with 2:54 left. His two free throws
extended the lead to 56-53 a minute later, and four free
throws by Goods (10 points) off intentional Washington
State (22-7.10-7) fouls iced the contest.
"It's probably as good of a win in terms of emotion,
in terms of what we were playing for. as we've had all
year." said coach Trent Johnson. "I thought from the 10-
minute mark on. we were as good as we've been all year
defensively. If we can keep it in the halfcourt. regardless
of who or where we play, 1 think we have a chance."
Stanford went into halftime down 33-22 after a
Robin Lopez alley-oop dunk, and came out of halftime
with a 10-4 run that cut WSU's lead to 37-32 with 14:54
left. Washington State held on to its narrow lead until
Finger (eight points) drained his first three-pointer of
the season, pumping both fists above his head in cele
bration after tying the game at 51-all with 4:06 left.
Then, a Goods free throw gave Stanford its first lead of
the afternoon. After two Kyle Weaver free throws for
WSU. Brook Lopez's dunk gave the Cardinal the lead
for good.
UCLA (25-3. 13-2). 68-66 winners over Arizona yes
terday. holds a one-game lead over Stanford heading into
their 8 p.m.Thursday tilt at Pauley Pavilion; Washington
State is four games back in third. Assuming UCLA wins
its season finale versus California (15-12.6-10) on Satur
day. Stanford needs a win at Pauley and a win Saturday at
USC (18-10,9-7) to split the Pac-10 title with the Bruins.
It would be Stanford's first piece of the Pac-10 champi
onship since winning it outright in 2003-04.
"At the beginning of the year, we laid out goals to
achieve and I'd say we've achieved about all of them, all
the possible goals at this point." said sophomore center
Robin Lopez (11 points). "The Pac-10 championship is
just one more goal."
Early on against the Cougars, this week's game with
UCLA game looked like it would be a mere formality,
not a title-deciding bout. That's because Washington
State scored the game's first nine points, and pushed
that lead to 14-3 on a Derrick Low three. Low, who ter
rorized Stanford in the team's meeting four weeks ago
alongside fellow senior guard Weaver, scored 14 first
half points as Washington State shot 50 percent overall
(13-of-26) and from deep (4-of-8) to build a 33-22 half
time lead.
But Low would not score in the second half, and
Weaver finished with just four points.
"You can't play the No. 8 team in the country on their
home court and expect to win if you don't play your best

the entire 40 minutes," Cougars coach Tony Bennett
said. "It was frustrating for us because we played such a
great first half, but we couldn't hold them off."
Stanford breakdowns in defense and rebounding, for
the fourth straight game, allowed the Cougars to take
the early advantage. The Cardinal players really lost
their cool during a 3:30 stretch in the late first half that
saw them whistled for eight straight fouls, including a
technical on Trent Johnson, just his second this year.
"I've got six technicals in four years, and one of them
this year was for I don't know, jumping up and down,"
he said postgame of his ability to stay in control on the
bench. "1 don't measure it in terms of technicals, 1 meas
ure it in terms of keeping my composure."
Stanford finishes the season with a home record of
16-1. Now. the team will likely spend the next three
weekends (the end of the regular season, the Pac-10
Tournament and the first two rounds of the NCAA Tour
nament in Anaheim, Calif.) in the greater Los Angeles
area, where they've lost their last seven games, dating
back to the 2004-05 season. Before that stretch though,
Stanford had won its last nine in the City of Angels.
