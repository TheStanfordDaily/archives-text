# For the 8th straight time, Stanford is
## PAC-10 CHAMP 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
'The women's basketball team completed its regular season on
the road this weekend, as it traveled north to face Washington and
Washington State. The Cardinal downed the Huskies on Friday
and the Cougars yesterday. The victories, along with California's
loss on Sunday, gave Stanford the Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship outright. It is Stanford's eighth straight regular season title.
'The Cardinal began the series against Washington in Seattle,
and for the first half of the game, the I luskies went basket-for-bas
ket with Stanford. Washington trailed by just two at halftime and
the lead changed 10 times in the half.
"We played the No. 7 team in the country to two points in the
first half — that's phenomenal," said Washington coach Tia
Jackson.
Hie Huskies didn't shoot particularly well, draining only 35.9
percent of their shots from the field, while the Cardinal shot 53.3
percent.
But Washington succeeded because it was able to control the
glass — the Huskies out-rebounded Stanford 24-13 in the first
half, with the majority (14) of their boards coming on offense. As
a result, they attempted nine more field goals and five more free
throws than Stanford.

GAME NOTES: Stanford clinched the top seed in
next week's Pac-10 tournament and Candice
Wiggins broke the conference career scoring
record on Sunday in Pullman, Wash. After losing
a pair of games in early January, Stanford has
won its last 15 in a row heading into the post
season, with all but two double-digit victories
"Our defense was pretty good, but we gave them too many
shots." said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
ITie Cardinal's struggles were surprising, since Stanford
is one of the best rebounding teams in the conference. And
VanDerveer's halftime message to her team was clear.
"I think you can probably guess it," she said after the
game."lt started with an" R' and ended with a 'D', with seven
letters in there."
The Cardinal responded by pulling down two more
boards than the Huskies in the second half, although Wash
ington still had more rebounds overall.
It wasn't necessarily rebounding, but timely shooting
that led Stanford to victory.The Cardinal began the half on
a 12-0 run. holding Washington without a basket for nearly
six minutes. After that, the lead was never threatened —
Stanford pushed its advantage to 25 points, and won by a
final score of 73-53.
"We didn't come out in the second half the way we want
ed to," said Washington guard Emily Florence. "You can't
get down with a team like that. They won't let vou come
back."
Senior guard Candice Wiggins and sophomore guard J.J.
Hones led Stanford with 22 and 16 points, respectively.
Hones shot 6-for-9 overall and 4-for-6 from three-point
range.
"I was left open, and so I tried to take a shot because
that's what the team needed," said Hones.
"The guards led the way for us. which is what it's going to
take down the stretch," said VanDerveer. But. she added,
"we need guards rebounding more."
She pointed specifically to the success of Florence who,
despite being one of the smallest players in the conference
(at 5'5), is the ninth-best rebounder in the Pac-10.
Still, it was Wiggins who led the Cardinal on the boards,
as she notched a double-double with 10 rebounds. Sopho
more center Jayne Appel and freshman forward Kayla Ped
ersen — who both scored in double figures — had unchar
acteristic off-nights on the glass.
But the post players' stingy defense made up for it: Appel
had three blocks, and junior reserve forward/center Morgan
Clyburn led all players with a career-high four rejections.
Washington center Andrea Plouffe was the only Husky
to reach double figures (11 points),and even she was held to
a single basket in the second period.
"Our team really focused in the second half," said Van-
Derveer.
That intensity carried over to Sunday's game in Pullman
against the Cougars, the Pac-10 bottom-dwellers.
Stanford has never lost to Washington State, and in their
previous meeting, the Cardinal blew out the Cougars 105-47
in their first game of Pac-10 play. Yesterday's match didn't
approach those numbers, but Stanford was dominant from
the start in a 74-52 win.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 14-4 lead about five min
utes into the contest, and its lead was never seriously chal
lenged from that point on.
Stanford outplayed Washington State in every possible
way: they shot effectively, rebounded well and held the
Cougar offense in check throughout the game.
The Cardinal attack relied on three-point shooting —
Stanford shot a remarkable 50 percent from three-point
range. In their last regular season games, seniors Cissy
Pierce and Wiggins were a combined 7-of-10 from behind
the arc.
Wiggins was the only Cardinal to reach double-digits in
points, two of which gave her the Pac-10 career scoring
record, which had stood for nearly 14 years.
Cougar guard Katie Appleton. who led WSU with 17
points, said, "Stanford did a good job of exploiting some of
our weaknesses."
Washington State coach June Daugherty felt that her
team was able to play with Stanford through much of the
first half, and indeed, they did: unlike in their first meeting,
the Cougars never let Stanford completely run away with

the game.
But Daugherty and her squad were dealt a massive blow
toward the end of the first half when forward Heather
Molzen. one of the Cougars' best players, fell backwards
into Appel when the two were fighting for a rebound.lTieir
limbs became tangled, and Molzen's elbow slammed into
the floor. She left the game and did not return — Daugher
ty said she had severe swelling and. after the contest. Molzen
was seen in a sling.
"It really hurt us when she went off the floor," Daugher
ty said. "You saw us give up the baskets to start the second
half, and I don't think that would have happened if 1 leather
had been out there."
Molzen's injury essentially ended any chance the
Cougars had of pulling off an upset.
With the game in hand. Van Derveer was able to give her
reserves increased minutes.
"I was excited about the play ofour bench, "she said."We
had Morgan playing the minutes that she played. We got
[freshman | Ashley Cimino in there to play some major min
utes and make some nice plays. [Freshman] Jeanette Pohlen
had a really great weekend.
"We haven't really played a deep rotation, but we were
able to do that and rest some people going into the Pac-10
[Tournament] and also get people some more confidence."
Ihe Pac-10 Tournament will be held next weekend in
San Jose. Stanford will be the top seed and will play Satur
day against the winner of a play-in game between Oregon
State and Arizona.
VanDerveer does not foresee any massive changes to the
Cardinal's game plan for the tournament.
"I think the adjustments we're going to make are going
to be subtle." she said.
The team is awaiting the return of junior forward Jillian
I larmon, a regular starter who is one of the team's best re
bounders and scorers. She has missed over a month with an
injury. Harmon traveled with the team to Washington, but
did not play.
VanDerveer said that she might not play 1 larmon in the
early rounds of the Pac-10 because she wants her to be at full
strength for the NCAA tournament.
It's one of only a few predicaments for the I (all of Fame
coach: her team is peaking, and Pac-10 and NCAA tourna
ment glory are within their grasp.
