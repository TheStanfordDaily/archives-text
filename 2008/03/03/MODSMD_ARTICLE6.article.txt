# For the 8th straight time, Stanford is
## PAC-10 CHAMP 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
'The women's basketball team completed its regular season on
the road this weekend, as it traveled north to face Washington and
Washington State. The Cardinal downed the Huskies on Friday
and the Cougars yesterday. The victories, along with California's
loss on Sunday, gave Stanford the Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship outright. It is Stanford's eighth straight regular season title.
'The Cardinal began the series against Washington in Seattle,
and for the first half of the game, the I luskies went basket-for-bas
ket with Stanford. Washington trailed by just two at halftime and
the lead changed 10 times in the half.
"We played the No. 7 team in the country to two points in the
first half — that's phenomenal," said Washington coach Tia
Jackson.
Hie Huskies didn't shoot particularly well, draining only 35.9
percent of their shots from the field, while the Cardinal shot 53.3
percent.
But Washington succeeded because it was able to control the
glass — the Huskies out-rebounded Stanford 24-13 in the first
half, with the majority (14) of their boards coming on offense. As
a result, they attempted nine more field goals and five more free
throws than Stanford.
