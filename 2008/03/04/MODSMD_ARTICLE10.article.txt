# Startup looks at the big picture
## CoolIris/PicLens employs mostly undergraduates 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford is known for its startups, yet few are run by a team of
40 people — half of whom are Stanford undergraduates. Coollris,

founded by three Stanford alumni and affiliates, is the creator of Pi
c Lens, software that, according to its developers, "instantly transforms
your browser into a full-screen 3-D experience."
Among other uses, Pic Lens allows viewers to zoom in on specific pho
tos. Using the 3D Wall function, users can drag,click and zoom their way
through many images.
Because the team is so small, every person is involved; even freshmen
sit in on executive meetings.The founders repeatedly stressed the impor
tance of their young interns.
"Our interns are not treated as employees but as team members." said
co-founder Soujanya Bhumkar, a 1999 graduate of the University of
Chicago. "They bring energy to the team. They all have a piece that they
own and run. They are not being managed."
The team is divided into what members call "buckets," small groups
that handle different elements of marketing, as well as the management
of the software itself.
"On such a small team, every contribution you make is important,"
said Sarah Arora 'OS. "You learn so much from everyone around you."
Because of this atmosphere, many students enjoy working at the com
pany.
"It is awesome working for a startup because they allow us to be cre
ative, which we may not get to be otherwise," said Christopher Anderson
•11.
As Stanford alums themselves, the founders have good reasons for hir
ing so many enthusiastic Stanford students.
"Stanford — which happens to be right here — also has a lot of smart
people!" added Josh Schwarzapcl '07, a Stanford Mayfield fellow and one
of Coollris's co-founders. "Also, Stanford students are very interested in
start-ups. It is the first university to initialize entrepreneurship.The Stan
ford Technology Ventures Programs (STVP) is responsible for evangeliz
ing entrepreneurship on campus."

Though publicity presents a significant challenge, the team is not wor
ried about getting the word out. In order for the product to be a success,
however, the company must expand its clientele to include larger Web
sites. At the same time, Pic Lens needs to make sure people who have al
ready downloaded the program continue to use it.
According to Bhumkar, the startup has yet to spend any money on
marketing.
"We get users who give us feedback, and we are extremely conscious
about engaging them," he said."lf you build a good product.it will spread
naturally."
At this point, the company's advertising is done primarily through var
ious YouTUbe videos, uploaded by bloggers and Pic Lens fans.
The team claims that it is more about the vision than profits.
"What motivates us is what we can do for users and change their lives,
and that's how we can make money." said Austin Shoemaker '07. "If you
focus on money, you end upon a short-term chase. We want it to be a long
term track and do not want to fall into the money track that a lot of large
companies fall into."
As for the future, the team members plan to expand Pic Lens so that
users can not only view pictures, but videos, emails and other media as
well. In their words, they want to create a new kind of Web browser.
"Whatever Website you go to,"said Paul Doersch 10."we will present
it in a more visually appealing way."
