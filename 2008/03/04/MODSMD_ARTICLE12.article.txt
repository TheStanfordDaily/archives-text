## Stanford outbound email blocked 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
In response to recent compro
mises to campus email security,
Stanford has set up a new monitor
ing program designed to eliminate
spam coming from Stanford email
addresses.
This wave of spam from compro
mised Stanford accounts prompted
Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
Hotmail, Yahoo! and America
Online to block all incoming emails
from Stanford addresses. In
response, on Feb. 29, ITS began fil
tering outgoing campus emails,
rejecting those that displayed a high
probability of being spam. Since
then, the ISPs have ceased to block
Stanford emails.
Over the last month, numerous
email accounts on campus have
been targeted by phishers claiming
to represent the "Stanford Team."
Hie phishers' requested the
addressees' usernames and pass
words, which the phishers used to
flood off-campus email accounts
with spam from the stanford.edu
addresses, according to ITS. Since
Feb. 18. approximately 50 student,
faculty and staff email accounts
have been compromised.
"You should always be wary
when asked to provide any type of
account and password information
when you yourself have not initiated
the correspondence," Nancy Ware,
director of strategic planning and
communication for ITS, wrote in an
email to Ibe Daily. "Stanford does
not send emails which request that
you provide your password via
email."

ITS will continue to
monitor outgoing emails
for spam indefinitely.

according to Ware. As for
the phishers. Ware stated that

it is unlikely that they will be
identified or charged for compro
mising Stanford emails.

"Attacks like this one usually
come from 'rented' bot-net address
es, which change frequently and are
distributed throughout the world ,"
she said. "Tracking them down
would take international law
enforcement cooperation, which,
while possible, usually only happens
in cases where there is a demonstra
bly large amount of worldwide dam
age."
The "threshold" for determining
the probability that an email going
out from a Stanford address is spam
will be determined using the same
anti-spam program that ITS has
used since October 2006 to keep
spam from being delivered to cam
pus accounts. Outgoing emails regis
tering a 90 percent or higher chance
of being spam are automatically dis
carded, while those from 80 to 90
percent are routed to a dedicated
server for evaluation by the respec
tive ISP.
"There is a very limited possibili
ty that legitimate outbound email
would be deleted," Ware said. "But
we feel the likelihood is slim."
According to Ware, despite
emails sent Friday to all student res
idences warning of the scam, five
additional accounts were compro
mised over the weekend.
In an effort to better communi
cate the danger of being phished to
residences. Resident Computer

Consultants (RCCs) will be meeting
with Residential Computing over
the next week to discuss how to
inform residents about both the
dangers of phishing and the new
spam filter.
"Just like any other changes in
the system, RCCs will inform their
residents about them." said Jennifer
Ly. RCC manager and computing
info systems analyst.
Trancos RCC Mike Chung 08
claimed he and other RCCs were
notified following the latest round
of phishing and were told to inform
their residents about the risks pres
ent.
"This is the first time that I've
seen something of this scale hap
pen." Chung said. "It does happen
on a considerable level, but it's usu
ally not a very widely blown thing."
In the coming weeks, he expects
that he and his fellow RCCs will
begin to communicate the risks and
warning signs of being phished more
thoroughly to residents.
"Just forwarding an email may
not be sufficient," he said. "1 believe
RCCs will be taking the steps to
make sure the residents understand
the situation."
