## Gingrich to open Menlo Park office 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
American Solutions, an organiza
tion chaired by Distinguished
Visiting Hoover Fellow and Former
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich, recently announced the
opening of a new office in Menlo
Park.
Gingrich made the announce
ment via YouTuhe, in keeping with
the group's commitment to expand
the use of the Internet and technolo
gy in political organization.
Hie organization's Director of
Internet Strategy, David Kralik. told
The Daily that American Solutions
hopes to address H 'a deficit of techno
logical use in online organization."

"We want to hear
from the people who
made Silicon Valley''

— DAVID KRALIK,
American Solutions

"Online political technology is a
generation behind the times" he
said.
The organization hopes to capi
talize on regional opportunities to

apply technological knowledge and
methods to political problems.
"We want to learn from the best
of the private sector," said Kralik.
"We want to hear from the people
who made Silicon Valley, and who
have the best ideas."
Some Stanford faculty saw the
organization's goals as a response to
the political reality of the 21st centu
ry-
"The Democrats, especially
Obama, have been very successful at
generating money online," said
Political Science Prof. Barry
Weingast. "Whether or not the
Internet is a viable way of generating
public opinion remains to be seen."
"l think there's a sense that the
entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon
Valley might help in showing how to
adapt the Internet — this very pli
able resource — to political action,"
he added.
The office attempts to take
advantage of its proximity to
Stanford and Hoover. American
Solutions has already reached out to
some members of the faculty, includ
ing Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig. The
group also hopes to endow an
undergraduate scholarship that will

include IS months of work with the
organization following the student's
graduation.
"We'd like more than anything to
find a student who is technically
adept and politically savvy," Kralik
said. "We see it as a kind of modern
day G.I. bill."
The organization also hopes to
interact with Stanford students in a
broader sense.
"We want to reach out to every
one," said Kralik. "The country is
tired of red versus blue, and to the
degree that the Stanford student
body is receptive to our message
we'd love to have their help."
Gingrich also plans to give a talk
to the Hoover Institution in July that
will in part address the organiza

tion's concerns. Despite Gingrich's
connections, the organization has
made no official contact with
Hoover so far.
"American Solutions is totally
independent [from Hoover]," said
Hoover Director John Raisian. "It
has nothing to do with Hoover, and.
therefore, as far as I know nothing to
do with Stanford at large. Nor has
there been any discussion of how
Hoover or Hoover fellows might be
engaged, whatsoever."
"I know that Newt has always been
interested in the Silicon Valley scene,"
Raisian added. "I think what this is
about is to try to spark something that
would be located regionally."
Nonetheless, American Solutions
expressed an interest in following up

on Gingrich's ties with Hoover.
"Looking forward, we're certain
ly going to be focusing on Hoover,"
Kralik said.
Kralik said Gingrich has a long
held interest in the region.
"The most attractive thing is that
it's so close to the tech sector," he
said. "The Internet has obviously
broken down many barriers of com
munication. but there's a level of
trust that you get with having face
to-face contact."
"It's a regional advantage," he
added. "There aren't that many
political organizations that have an
office out here in Silicon Valley."
