## Day of reckoning for Clinton, Obama 
### TOM RAUM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HOUSTON — Barack
Obama approached Tuesday's
voting in Texas, Ohio, Rhode
Island and Vermont as a chance
to drive rival Hillary Rodham
Clinton out of the Democratic
presidential contest for good.
Clinton looked at the same con
tests as a way to end Obama's
streak of 11 straight victories and
keep her candidacy alive.
Spending the night in the
same Texas city, both expressed
confidence in their chances. But
both teams acknowledged that
split decisions and close votes
could prolong the battle for at
least another month - or more.
"We know this has been an
extraordinary election. It contin
ues to be. We're working hard to
do as well as we can," said
Obama, who planned to await
Texas returns in San Antonio.
"I'm just getting warmed up,"
Clinton told reporters, a clear
sign that she expects to press the
campaign on beyond TUesday no
matter the outcome.
She was opening Election
Day in Houston, but then head
ing back to Ohio for more cam
paign events. She will await
results in Columbus before
returning to Washington.
Polls show tight races in both
Texas and Ohio. The Obama
campaign saw Texas as their best
opportunity, while the Clinton
campaign saw Ohio as theirs.
Texas offers 228 delegates. Ohio

164.
"Your voice can win an elec
tion," Obama told a noisy late
night rally in Houston. Repeating
a signature election refrain, he
shouted: "I have only one ques
tion for you: Are you fired up?
Ready to go?" When the crowd
roared its approval, he added:
"Let's go change the world."
His wife, Michelle, had a more
subdued message for the cheer
ing supporters: "We have a lot of
work to do."
Obama spent Monday cam
paigning in Texas, emphasizing
his readiness to take over as com
mander in chief.
But he was dogged by allega
tions that he had overstated his
opposition to the North
American Free Trade Agreement
to win votes in Ohio; and his ties
to Chicago businessman Antoin
"Tony" Rezko on the day that
jury selection began in the politi
cal corruption trial of the real
estate developer and fast-food
magnate.
"Tony Rezko was a friend and
supporter of mine for many
years. These charges are com
pletely unrelated to me. and
nobody disputes that," Obama
said at a news conference in San
Antonio.
Obama did receive a $1(),(MX)
contribution made by a Rezko
associate that is mentioned in the
indictment. But Obama's cam
paign has long since sent the
money to charity.
