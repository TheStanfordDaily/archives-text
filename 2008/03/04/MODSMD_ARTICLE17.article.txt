## Editorial Board Create more ASSU undergrad positions 
### 
The Associated Students of Stanford
University (ASSU) Undergraduate
Senate includes only 15 elected mem
bers, excluding class officers. This means that
less than a quarter of a percent of the under
graduate population of approximately 65(X)is
part of an elected government that has budg
etary discretion over $250,000 in general fees.
ITiese 15 at-large undergraduate students are
expected to represent the entire undergradu
ate population. An increase in the size of stu
dent government could allow more willing
and viable candidates to serve and allow for
increased specialization.
Our peer institutions feature more under
graduate representation. At Harvard, the
Undergraduate Council consists of 35 elected
members, more than double the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate's size. It includes a presi
dent and vice-president of the undergraduate
body, while our executive team represents
both the graduate and undergraduate popu
lations. Princeton has a representation similar
to Harvard's, with a smaller student popula
tion and 24 elected positions split between
Executive Officers, Senators and U-Coun
cilors. At Yale, excluding the Ereshman Class
Council (similar to the Frosh Council here at
Stanford), there are 42 elected positions, in
cluding those on the Executive Board, the
Yale College Council and the Yale Student
Activity Committee.
Increased opportunities to join student
government are in high demand here on the
Farm. There are currently 60 undergraduates
petitioning to be on the ballot for the Under
graduate Senate election, but only 15 will win
the privilege to serve the undergraduate stu
dent population next year. Were the Under
graduate Senate larger, the work could be dis
tributed between members and, in theory,
more could be accomplished. Further, many
of the candidates who lose the ASSU Senate
elections are viable vote-getters with popular
support. In 2007,2 ft votes separated the 15th
and 16th most popular candidates for the Un
dergraduate Senate, with the 15th candidate
being the last selected to the Senate. In the

same election, the 15th and 30th candidates
were separated by less than 200 votes.
In addition, seven pairs are petitioning to
he a part of the 2008 Executive Slate election.
If a new position of Undergraduate Execu
tive existed, some of these candidates would
run for this instead. This change would allow
the currently existing Executive position to
focus more on joint undergraduate and grad
uate initiatives, like the Airport Shuttle and
faculty diversity, to better serve both popula
tions.
Adding members to the Undergraduate
Senate and creating an Executive team for
undergraduates are not the only changes the
ASSU should be considering. One common
complaint about the ASSU is that students
feel disconnected with and misrepresented
by the Undergraduate Senate. Our peer insti
tutions structure their undergraduate repre
sentative bodies differently to address this
problem. Harvard's body elects members
from each house or district of campus. Prince
ton has two representative bodies, the Senate
and the U-Council.The Senate has two mem
bers elected from each of the sophomore, jun
ior and senior classes, while the U-council is a
10-member at-large body much like our Un
dergraduate Senate.
These models are not perfect, but they
should be considered, as they would increase
responsiveness. If each Senator had a smaller
constituency (one class or one dorm, for ex
ample), the Senator would be able to respond
to concerns more easily, and students would
feel more connected to at least one represen
tative on the Senate.
Hie number of students petitioning to be
part of the upcoming election is an indication
that many people are excited about student
government. Asa student body, we should en
courage more participation by increasing the
size of the undergraduate governmental
body to bring it more in line with those at
other universities. In addition, the ASSU
should look at how it is representing the stu
dent body and consider electing Senators to
represent smaller constituencies.
