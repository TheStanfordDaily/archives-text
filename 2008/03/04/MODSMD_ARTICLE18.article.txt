# Stu's Views
## Time to leave? 
### 
Today, Ohio, Texas, Vermont and
Rhode Island are voting in the Demo
cratic primaries. The media has, cor
rectly, played it as the last stand of Hillary
Clinton's campaign against Barack Obama's
increasing momentum. With 11 straight de
feats, if she cannot emerge after today as the
overall winner, both in terms of delegates
and popular votes, it is unlikely her cam
paign will he able to continue. Although
Clinton herself has shown little, if any. indi
cation she will leave the race, rumor has it
that a large contingent of her staff will resign
en masse tomorrow if she does not win both
Ohio and Texas, l ike the Final Four, this is
truly "win or go home" for Clinton.
Polls show that she leads Ohio by a small
margin, by around 5 percent, and that Texas
is a tossup. Texas, however, has a complicat
ed "hybrid" primary caucus system, which
will give an edge to Obama due to his prior
dominance in all of the caucus states except
New Mexico. If Clinton wins Ohio and
Obama wins Texas, the day will likely be a
draw overall in terms of delegates, but it will
not be enough for Clinton to secure the
nomination. She has not won one state in
one month — an eternity in the primary sea
son — while Obama has won 11. At this
point, his winning streak may already be un
stoppable.
If Clinton cannot win convincingly today,
she needs to bow out of the race for the good
of the Democratic Party. One of the golden
rules of politics is that the party comes first.
A protracted and divisive nomination fight,
extending into late April, when Pennsylva
nia votes, or even beyond, would greatly
damage the Democrats' momentum as the
race continues into the fall. John McCain is a
real challenge who cannot be considered
lightly — a unified party will be necessary
for a victory in November, both for the
White I louse and for Congress. All Congres
sional candidates know that their chances of
victory will be influenced by the presidential
race; a strong, legitimate nominee helps
them.
A Clinton victory based on superdele
gates would be morally illegitimate (al
though technically legitimate), but, unless
she can stage another miracle comeback like
New Hampshire, it seems to be the only way

she could win. Although the primary system
has many flaws, a Clinton victory based on
party insiders would not only keep Democ
rats at home, but it would also give John Mc-
Cain and the Republican National Commit
tee another angle from which to attack her.
If Clinton wins because of superdelegates,
she risks alienating the thousands of new
voters, and donors, who have entered the
party because of Obama.
The Democratic primary system was not
designed to sustain a two-person horserace
in what is now its third month. It was de
signed to pick a winner quickly, pull the
party elders behind the winner, and move
forward into the general election — John
Kerry won lowa and never looked back.This
two-person contest, however, is now on the
verge of hurting the party, rather than help
ing it through an honest debate of ideas.
Both candidates must remember that the
object is not the nomination, but the presi
dency. ITie two months of sleepless nights
will only continue for another eight.
Clinton has waged a strong but flawed
campaign, especially in large states like Cal
ifornia and Massachusetts. One wonders
what would have happened if Bill Clinton
hadn't become too involved before the
South Carolina primary, where African-
American voters turned away from the Clin
tons. After South Carolina, the primaries be
came a rhetorical referendum of the Clinton
Years — eight years of divisive politics, the
Republican Revolution and Monica Lewin
sky. Perhaps Hillary Clinton could have won
on her own merits, as she did in New I lamp
shire, with an impressive Senate record. She
proved that winning on her husband's was
far more difficult.

Stuart already knows the results of the primar
ies. He's sad. Comfort him at shaimeKf
