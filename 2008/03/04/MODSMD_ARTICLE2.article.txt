### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Eat food. Not too much. Mostly
plants. So goes the motto of Michael
Pollan's latest book. "In Defense of
Food: An Eater's Manifesto," which
he spoke about to a packed Kresge
Auditorium last night.

Pollan. a journalism professor at
UC-Berkeley and author of the
best-selling book "The Omnivore's
Dilemma," spoke about America's
problem with food, offering guide
lines about how to decide what to
eat. The take-home message: eat
whole foods rather than highly
processed "edible food-like sub
stances." learn to eat in moderation
and focus less on marketed health
claims when deciding what to eat.
"It's kind of astounding that you
can write a best-selling book

defending food and meals." Pollan
said in his lecture, part of the series
on The Ethics of Food and the
Environment. "But we have gotten
to where we can no longer eat on
our own: we have professionalized
it."
Pollan met with representatives
from Stanford Dining in a public
panel earlier in the day to discuss
ways to make the dining service
healthier and more sustainable.
