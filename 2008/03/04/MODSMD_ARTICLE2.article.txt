## Pollan stresses healthy living Writer encourages crowd to eat whole, natural foods 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Eat food. Not too much. Mostly
plants. So goes the motto of Michael
Pollan's latest book. "In Defense of
Food: An Eater's Manifesto," which
he spoke about to a packed Kresge
Auditorium last night.

Pollan. a journalism professor at
UC-Berkeley and author of the
best-selling book "The Omnivore's
Dilemma," spoke about America's
problem with food, offering guide
lines about how to decide what to
eat. The take-home message: eat
whole foods rather than highly
processed "edible food-like sub
stances." learn to eat in moderation
and focus less on marketed health
claims when deciding what to eat.
"It's kind of astounding that you
can write a best-selling book

defending food and meals." Pollan
said in his lecture, part of the series
on The Ethics of Food and the
Environment. "But we have gotten
to where we can no longer eat on
our own: we have professionalized
it."
Pollan met with representatives
from Stanford Dining in a public
panel earlier in the day to discuss
ways to make the dining service
healthier and more sustainable.

Writer Michael Pollan, a professor at UC-Berkeley, addressed a full crowd at Kresge Auditorium last night. He emphasized
the importance of avoiding "edible food-like substances" and focusing on the more wholesome food of past generations.
Sustainability is a main priority of
Stanford Dining, and Pollan charged
Stanford with the mission of being a
model program for other universi
ties.
"Stanford can be one of the lead
ers if they can show that students
support the program and that it is
economical," Pollan told The Daily
in an interview yesterday. He
explained that Stanford is in a good
position to make food choice
changes, noting that it is a wealthy
institution in the center of
California, with lots of buying
opportunities.
Pollan argued that people have
succumbed to what he terms
"nutritionism," an ideology that
focuses on nutrients and not entire
foods. Nutritionism tells them that
food is only the sum of the key
nutrients. This nutrient world is
often divided into good and evil,
with nutrients switching camps fre

quentlyâ€” requiring scientists,
dieticians and other experts to
decipher it all.
Pollan has developed a list of 12
commandments to help eaters navi
gate the distinction between food
and edible food-like substances,
including, "Don't eat anything your
great-grandmother wouldn't recog
nize as food" and "Don't eat food
that won't eventually rot."
Putting these guidelines into
practice can get tricky, though, espe
cially for institutions like Stanford
Dining, which serves about 18,000
meals a day. Stanford Dining has a
program that prioritizes sustainabil
ity and works to buy locally and eco
logically when possible.
Pollan said that what he terms as
"real food" is more expensive than
industrial food, making affordability
a challenge.
"You have to convince [people]
that this is worth paying more for,
that it is actually part of the educa
tional mission." he said. "There are
important implications of what col
lege dining services serve students:
we are talking about establishing
food habits that thev will hold on

to."
Eric Montell, Acting Executive
Director of Stanford Dining
Services, outlined some of the steps
Stanford Dining is taking to provide
healthier, more sustainable food to
students. Stanford Dining tries to
work directly with farmers as much
as possible, avoiding costly middle
men.
Sustainable Foods Coordinator
Erin Gaines explained that student
support is crucial for any new initia
tives. Even if Stanford Dining prior
itizes sustainability, it has to listen to
student reactions.
"If we pulled all of the tomatoes
in winter, students would complain,"
she said, even though tomatoes are
not in season in California during
winter months.
Montell explained that the pro
gram has to bring students along,
rather than leaving them behind.
"Are we here to force students to
change their eating habit? To edu
cate them?" he asked.
For students who are on meal
plans and cannot voice their opinion
with purchasing power, Pollan
advised that they educate them

selves about what is in season in
their region and pressure their din
ing service to provide those foods.
"Ask lots of questions," he told
The Daily. "They help move the
food service program in the right
direction and show student support
for the movement."
Pollan recognized a "huge sense
of befuddlement" about what to cat
and stressed that right now we can
not rely on science or the govern
ment to tell us, though science, he
said, is making progress in under
standing the mechanics behind food
and health.
"I think nutrition science is today
where surgery was around 1650:
promising, interesting to watch, but
I'm going to wait to get on the
table," Pollan said last night,
explaining that we still do not com
pletely understand what makes
foods healthy or how they change as
they go through the human diges
tive system. "We don't know what is
going on deep in the soul of a car
rot."
