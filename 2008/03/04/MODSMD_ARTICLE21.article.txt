# Pleading Inanity
## Ain't I a woman? 
### 
If any of you guys (or girls) out there art
looking to score points with that special
woman in your life — or if you're like me
and are trying to attract one — be sure to
make a big fuss over this coming Saturday.
March 8. Buy her flowers, tell her you like
her for her, and try your hardest to listen to
what she says while nodding obsequiously.
If you're really aiming for the stars, do that
thing in bed she likes when you cross your
legs standing on your head. Ya know, so that
she can [CENSORED BY THE STAN
FORD DAILY] until there's confetti every
where and you both climax in a double
fugue? It'll make her weak.
What's so special about Saturday? First
off, it very well may be the week, month or
anniversary of some special occasion in
your relationship, in which case you're
screwed if you don't do something. More
importantly, though. March 8 is recognized
by the United Nations as International
Women's Day.
According to a pop-up window that I
can't get to close on my browser, every
March 8 since the early 1900s, women
throughout the world have held events to
celebrate their achievements and bring at
tention to their continued struggles. While
many large-scale festivities mark this occa
sion. the pop-up window continues, there is
also a rich and diverse fabric of local activity
on this day — from political rallies and busi
ness conferences to local craft markets and
theatrical performances — which aims to
connect and inspire women across the globe.
Now. I've made perfectly clear that I
don't buy this whole "male/female" binary;
after a healthy dose of Saturday Night Live

"Pat" sketches and Vegas exotic dancer con
fusions, I've learned not to ask for defini
tions where none may exist. Nevertheless,as
I'm sure many of you know (from personal
experience), I have quite a soft spot for that
group with amorphous boundaries that I'm
told are commonly referred to as "women."
You're probably thinking to yourself,
"Vishnu, if you love women so much, then
why do you endorse Barack Obama, con
demning Hillary to irrelevancy? As a direct
result of your actions, she'll soon drop out of
the race with the endorsements of The New
York Times and 'Stu's Views' as the only
thing she'll have to show for her campaign."
Hey Hills, you wanna know why I didn't
support you? I'll keep it simple: you once
!>iiid that you were delighted to be the Sena
tor from Punjab. Well guess what, akku. this
thumbi is from Tamil Nadu. We have no love.
That being said, friends. International
Women's Day gives us a lot upon which to
reflect. It's undeniable that the world's fe
males face a unique set of challenges, and
it's undeniable that the primary source of
many of their aggravations is men. Although
this 750-word article can't even begin to
scratch the surface of women's problems
and the way in which men can be part of the
solution. I'd like to discuss a couple of sad

news items that recently caught my eye.
Sad news item #1: In January, Mexico
City began running women-only buses to in
sulate them from all-too-frequent male
gropers. Women filed about one complaint
every day regarding sexual incidents on
public transportation. The full extent of the
problem is likely much greater, since — ei
ther because of cultural assumptions or
their belief that the police don't care —
most women don't report men's lecherous
behavior.
Simple solution: Sandbox rules, fellas.
Keep your hands to yourself!
Sadder news item #2: A recent World
Health Organization survey found that
more than one in five Namibian women re
port being sexually abused before the age of
15, with the perpetrators often being rela
tives. African children also face the risk of
sexual abuse at school. Half of Malawian
schoolgirls surveyed claimed that male
teachers or classmates had touched them in
a sexual manner without their permission.
Tragically, the amount of sexual abuse in
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda,
Kenya, Sierra Leone and other African
countries appears to be on the rise.
Oversimplified solution: See supra.
Of course, it's worth noting that the cul
tural barriers to the implementation of what
Westerners consider gender equality are
quite formidable. I hope that what's equally
obvious, however, is that addressing
women's issues across the globe will take
more than a day.
