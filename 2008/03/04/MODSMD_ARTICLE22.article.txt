## Wyndam Makowsky Beware: Card on the prowl 
### 
Wildcats. Trojans and Bears
alike, you have been
warned: fear the Cardinal.
You shouldn't need me to tell you.
Look at the past 15 games — can you
spot a loss? No?
But I 'm sure you see two wins over
then-Pac-10 leader Cal. authoritative
revenge victories over UCLA and
USC,and all the drubbings in between.
Since early January, no one has
been able to beat the Stanford women.
And with each game comes more mo

fall to the wayside.The team is peaking
pity the squad that tries to stop

in the NCAA Tournament. But unlike
other top teams such as No. 8 Baylor or
No. 10 Cal. the Cardinal is not slowing
down and dropping games as the sea

is constantly improving.
It starts with senior Candice Wig
gins, the newly anointed Pac-10 career
scoring leader. Wiggins has rebounded
from some early season troubles,
when, despite putting up a good num
ber of points, she shot poorly from the
field.
Now. not only is she scoring at will,
but she's doing it efficiently, as well.
Against the Washington schools this
weekend — albeit, not the toughest of
competition — she went a combined
18-32 from the field and 9-17 from be
