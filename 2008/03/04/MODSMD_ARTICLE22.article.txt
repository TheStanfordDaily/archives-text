## Wyndam Makowsky Beware: Card on the prowl 
### 
Wildcats. Trojans and Bears
alike, you have been
warned: fear the Cardinal.
You shouldn't need me to tell you.
Look at the past 15 games — can you
spot a loss? No?
But I 'm sure you see two wins over
then-Pac-10 leader Cal. authoritative
revenge victories over UCLA and
USC,and all the drubbings in between.
Since early January, no one has
been able to beat the Stanford women.
And with each game comes more mo
mentum, as more and more opponents
fall to the wayside.The team is peaking
pity the squad that tries to stop
them now.
Washington thought they could
hang with them this weekend. They
grabbed board after board and hoisted
up shot after shot and only trailed by
two at the half.They sprinted into their
locker nx>m, giddy over the thought
that they could be the first team in
nearly two months to knock off No. 6
Stanford.
The Cardinal had a quick fix for
that: it started the second period on a
12-0 run. Bye bye, Huskies.
The Stanford women will carry that
dominance into the Pac-10 Tourna
ment this weekend in San Jose and the
NCAA Tournament after that.
Schools along the western seaboard
and across the country must take note
of the Cardinal.
It's hard for them not to: Stanford
will be the top team at the Pac-10 Tour
ney and will most likely be a two seed
in the NCAA Tournament. But unlike
other top teams such as No. 8 Baylor or
No. 10 Cal. the Cardinal is not slowing
down and dropping games as the sea
son progresses; instead. Stanford's play
is constantly improving.
It starts with senior Candice Wig
gins, the newly anointed Pac-10 career
scoring leader. Wiggins has rebounded
from some early season troubles,
when, despite putting up a good num
ber of points, she shot poorly from the
field.
Now. not only is she scoring at will,
but she's doing it efficiently, as well.
Against the Washington schools this
weekend — albeit, not the toughest of
competition — she went a combined
18-32 from the field and 9-17 from be
hind the three-point arc to lead all
scorers in both games. Shooting over
50 percent as a guard is a great
achievement on its own; to do it from
three-point land as well is outstand
ing.
But Wiggins isn't solely a jump
shot artist: she is quick, smart and
strong enough to drive the lane and go
right at her opponent's post players.
Of course, if the other team tried to
do this to Stanford, chances are they'd
have their shot swatted. Sophomore
Jayne Appel anchors a front line that
not only scores with ease but defends
and rebounds seamlessly, as well.
Appel, freshman Kayla Pedersen and
junior Morgan Clyburn work in tan
dem to clean the offensive and defen
sive glass, score in the paint and pre
vent opposing bigs from getting easy
buckets — or any points at all. for that
matter.
And when the Cardinal post play
ers take care of business down low, the
guards are freed up to create along the
perimeter. JJ Hones, Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude and Wiggins can thread pass
es through mobs of defenders, and
Jeanette Pohlen, Cissy Pierce. Hones
and Wiggins can shoot the lights out.
Meanwhile, Ashley Cimino and
Hannah Donaghe — who have seen a
recent increase in their minutes —
have proven versatile at both ends of
the floor. And Stanford's recent suc
cess is more eye-opening because it
comes without forward Jillian Har
mon — a starter who is a leader in the
transition offense and a major con
tributor on the boards — who has
been out for over a month. But oppo
nents shouldn't rest easy: she'll be
back by the end of the Pac-10 tourna
ment. at which point the Cardinal at
tack will only improve.
The overall message is this: not
only is the Cardinal bench deep down
to the very last player, but Stanford is
a team in the truest sense of the word
— players feed off of and rely on each
other for success. Their star isn't the
moody caricature that permeates the
professional men's game — instead,
Wiggins is a selfless leader who would
just as soon pass the ball to a better
positioned player than shoot it herself.
And every player is comfortable in
her role.
From the starters through the re
serves, all the players seem to value
team success over individual gain.
Such a mentality will serve them well
in post season piay.
It certainly has so far.
