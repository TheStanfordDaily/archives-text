## Stanford, Cat UCLA, USC stand together atop Pac-10 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Who's on top in the Pac-10?
After the No. 6 Stanford women's tennis team,
No. 8 California and Nos. 11 UCLA and Southern
California all convened in Los Angeles over the
weekend, we still haven't a clue, and probably won't
until the final weeks of the season.
Each team finished the weekend with a 1-1
record. On the weekend, Stanford beat USC. USC
beat Cal,( 'al beat IJCLA, and UCLA beat the ()ar
dinal.
So. as that merry-go-round of results indicates,
there is no clear leader in the Pac-10.
"I have no idea [who is the best] because, techni
cally, those were our non-counters." head coach Lele
Forood said. "But right now it's all over the place. It's
pretty crazy."
The weekend proved to be a bittersweet home
coming for the Cardinal squad, which features four
players from the area — freshman I lilary Barte. jun
ior Megan Doheny, senior Celia Durkin and junior
Jessica Nguyen.
On the bright side, Stanford finished a grueling
five-game stretch away from the Farm which had the
team traveling up and down the coast. Seven of their
final 11 games will be at home, including rematches
against Cal, UCLA and USC.
With the 4-3 loss to UCLA on Friday, the Cardi
nal lost its third game of the season; the team had not
lost three games in a season since 1995 when it fin
ished 23-3.
And Stanford has yet to reach the midpoint of its
season.
"I'm not happy, and our team's not happy,"
Forood said of the losses. "We're trying to find the
formula a bit this year and get to a point where we
can produce a little more consistently on each court,
and that's something we haven't found yet."
The Cardinal was able to salvage the weekend
with a 4-3 victory over USC on Saturday, finishing 3-
2 on the road trip.
"It was a tough-fought win at LISC," Forood said.
"They had just drilled Cal the day before, and they
were waiting for us. We needed a correction match,
and while it wasn't the way we wanted — we had
match point at number five, as well, so it could have
easily been 5-2 — we need to start getting it done on
all courts."
On the season. Stanford is 2-2 in matches decided
by one-point, with wins against the University of
Miami and USC and losses to Georgia Tech and
UCLA.
Against the Bruins. Barte shined in an impressive
7-5.6-1 upset of No. 10 Riza Zalameda for Stanford's
first point of the day.
However, with Stanford trailing 3-1. Nguyen fell
6-4.6-3 to Tracy Lin to clinch the match for the Bru
ins.
Nguyen, who leads the team with 17 victories, is
coming off a wrist injury at the Indoors, which pre
vented her from hitting a two-handed backhand last
weekend in Washington.
"She's hitting her two-hander. but she's not at 1 (K)
percent yet," Forood said of Nguyen. "I think when
you're not healthy,it could either hurt or be a distrac-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is returning home after playing five straight
matches on the road, compiling a 3-2 record during its trip to Cal,
Washington, Washington State, UCLA and USC. Starting with the
match today, Stanford will play seven of its final 11 matches at
home.

tion because you feel something every time you
swing. An injury is always tough because you're con
stantly aware of it."
With the victory. UCLA has won two of its last
three meetings against Stanford, including a 4-2
upset at last year's NCAA semifinals.
Hie next day, Stanford took on the Trojans, look
ing to preserve a win streak spanning two decades —
the team's last loss to USC came on April 4,1986.
Barte continued her dominance at the No. 1 spot
with a 6-2, 7-6 (2) upset over Lindsey Nelson, who
was the 2(X)7 Pac-10 Singles Champion and Pac-10
Player of the Year.
With the doubles point and singles victories in the
top three spots, Stanford took the match from USC.
Barte is now 12-5 on the season. She is currently
on a four-game win streak, all at the team's number
one spot. The streak includes impressive victories
against Washington's Venise Chan and Washington
State's Ekaterina Burduli, as well as this weekend's
defeats of Zalameda and Nelson.
"She's really stepped up," Forood said. "We need
ed to change the lineup around a little bit because
I jndsay [ Burdette] was doing a good job. but she was
just losing some close matches at one. [Barte] was
next up because she was our most healthy player, and
she did a great job.
She's going to stay right there for a while, maybe
all season."
On the weekend, Durkin and freshman Carolyn
McVeigh also shined in doubles with two victories at
the No. 3 spot. They are currently on a four-match
win streak and are now 7-2 on the season.
Though easier said than done, Forood knows
what the Cardinal needs to improve.
"Well we have to win the doubles point, that's the
first thing," Forood said. "That's where part of our ef
fort is right now — to start winning the doubles point
again consistently. The second thing is finding the
formula particularly for our lower lineup spots."
ITie Cardinal is looking forward to being able to
make those corrections in the friendly confines of
Taube Tennis Center, rather than on the road.
The team will get a chance to do just that when it
hosts William & Mary at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon in
its first home match since Feb. 14.
