### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's tennis team has en
joyed very strong doubles play over its last
three matches, and that continued last
weekend at the Pacific Coast Classic dou
bles tournament in La Jolla, Calif.
Unlike dual matches, where there is an
eight-game pro set, these doubles matches
were played like those in the pros: a best
of-three match with sets that are six games
long each.
The duo of sophomore Richard Wire
and freshman Greg Hirshman that has
been playing solidly at No. 3 doubles all
year reached the quarterfinals of the tour
nament before losing to Sam Beidas and
James Lemke of Pepperdine on Saturday.
"[Greg and Richard] did a great job this
weekend." head coach John Whitlinger
said."l really like the way they are comple
menting each other. They got through
some tough matches [this weekend). And
the Pepperdine guys played really well."
Wire and Hirshman. unseeded to start
the tournament, began Friday with a big
upset 6-2, 6-1 win over fifth-seeded Gary
Sacks and Jaak Poldma of USC — the only
major upset of the first round. They then
won their second round match over Rices
Dennis Polyakov and Bruno Rosa, 6-4,4-6,
6-4.
On Saturday in the round of 16, they
were again victorious, this time over the in
dependent team of Charles Hoeveler and
Bijan Moallemi,7-6 (7-5),6-3. But their run
would end in the quarterfinals when they
ran into Beidas and Lemke, the eventual
runners-up of the tournament.
"We played well," Wire said. "We won
some tight matches. The quarterfinal was
tough. The other guys played really well.
We weren't used to playing a team that was
playing so well."
In other Stanford action, junior Blake
Muller and freshman Ted Kelly — who
won the ITA West Regional Doubles
Championship together last Fall — won
one match before losing in the second

Morrissey fell in their first round match to
Josh Miller and Ahmed Ismail of UCLA,
but then came hack to make it to the fourth
round of the consolation bracket before
falling to Pierre Moullion and Eoin
Heavey of California.
In a rare occurrence, assistant coach
Brandon Coupe got to enter in the draw
and play alongside senior Phil Kao. The
team fought hard to win its match over
Moodie Kamel and Stuart Keplar of Pep
perdine.6-7.7-5,6-1. But the duo fell in the
second round to Nick Meister and I larel
Srugo of UCLA, 6-0,7-5.

on the year in doubles together, the best
record on the team. Kelly and Muller are
now 8-7 on the year.

[lately]," Whitlinger said. "We have been
doing some positive things on the court. I
liked what everyone did this weekend. We
got some good matches in."
