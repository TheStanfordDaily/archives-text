# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Team effort leads to two wins for Card 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last weekend's
gut-wrenching sudden
death loss to UCLA in the
Irvine Invitational Cham
pionship, the Stanford
women's water polo team
had two options: they
could either dwell on
being so close to defeating
the No. 1 Bruins, or they
could forget about the loss
and come back even
stronger for tough match
es against San Diego State
and Arizona State. Two
victories later, it is clear
which path they chose.
The Cardinal got back
to its winning ways by de
feating the No. 7 Aztecs on
Saturday and the No. 10
Sun Devils on Sunday at
Avery Aquatic Center.
Both of those teams are in
the MPSF, so Stanford's
conference record now
stands at 3-0, while its
overall record is 11-2.

GAME NOTES. Stanford has won two in a row
and nine of its last 10 after defeating San
Diego State and ASU at home last weekend.
This is just the fifth away match for the Card
this year, and the team has o 3-1 record on
the road so far. Santa Barbara won their first
four matches of the year before dropping
their last nine.

San Diego State actually came into Saturday's match-up with a
better record than the Cardinal, at 13-1.1 lowever, there was a rea
son they were not ranked higher than No. 7 — they had yet to play
a school ranked in the top eight. Stanford was by far their toughest
match-up of the season thus far, and the Card made sure the Aztecs
knew that from the beginning.
Stanford took a 3-1 lead by the end of the first period, courtesy
of goals by senior Jackie Gauthier and juniors Heather West and
kira Hillman. Stanford would dou
ble its tally in the second quarter, hut
the Aztecs were able to stay within
two goals by scoring three of their
own.
At 9-6 after the end of the third
period, the score was still close, but
Stanford used a 3-1 run in the fourth
to put the game beyond doubt. Gau
thier and junior Lauren Silver com
pleted hat tricks in the final period,
and freshman Kim Krueger bagged
her second goal of the day with 3:51
remaining to make the score 12-7.
San Diego State would add two goals
in the last 40 seconds of the game to
make the score 12-9.
Stanford looked for more of the
same the next day against Arizona
State as it put together another 3-1
first quarter.The Card demonstrated
its offensive range in the opening pe
riod, scoring in transition: Jackie
Gauthier on a 3-on-2 from inside,
junior Koree Blyleven from close
range and sophomore Kelly Eaton
with a lob from outside.
The second quarter mirrored the
first, and ended up 3-1 again. After
Blyleven added her second goal with
a backhand, Stanford showcased its
fast breaking ability: freshman goal
keeper Amber Oland was able to
pick out both Hillman and Eaton
ahead of the pack for easy goals. The
Sun Devils again scored a late goal to
keep things close, and the half ended
6-2.
However, the score would not
stay close for long, as Stanford
pushed its lead to 9-2 by the 3:13
mark of the third quarter.The teams
would trade goals before the end of

the period, and the Card went into
the final quarter with a fairly com
fortable 10-3 lead.
Sophomore Alex Koran got her
first goal of the season less than a
minute into the fourth period, and.
although Arizona State would
outscore the Cardinal 3-1 the rest of
the way, the result was never in
doubt.
Stanford coach John Tanner was
happy about his team's offensive
performance over the weekend —
his team totaled 24 goals over just
two games.
"This weekend we played pretty
well on offense," he said.' [We] had a
lot of people involved in creating
chances and scoring."
The Cardinal had seven players
score against SDSU and eight play
ers score against ASU — offensive
balance that will be extremely im
portant for the rest of the season.
Tanner also praised the Cardinal's
work in 6-on-5 situations, as the Car
dinal took advantage of its extra-at
tacker situations throughout the
weekend, yet did not allow its oppo
nents to do the same.
The only problem Tanner saw was
that the team was not always consis
tent on defense.
"We had a few defensive lapses in
each game, losses of focus and inten
sity, and that's a concern," he said.
While the team can afford to get
away with lapses in some games, an
ill-timed loss of concentration could
be very costly down the line.
Nonetheless, the Card was happy
to pick up two wins this weekend,
and with a four-game weekend com
ing up — including a rematch
against UCLA — the team will take
all the momentum it can get.

two games.
"This weekend we played pretty
well on offense," he said.' [We] had a
lot of people involved in creating
chances and scoring."
The Cardinal had seven players
score against SDSU and eight play
ers score against ASU — offensive
balance that will be extremely im
portant for the rest of the season.
Tanner also praised the Cardinal's
work in 6-on-5 situations, as the Car
dinal took advantage of its extra-at
tacker situations throughout the
weekend, yet did not allow its oppo
nents to do the same.
The only problem Tanner saw was
that the team was not always consis
tent on defense.
"We had a few defensive lapses in
each game, losses of focus and inten
sity, and that's a concern," he said.
While the team can afford to get
away with lapses in some games, an
ill-timed loss of concentration could
be very costly down the line.
Nonetheless, the Card was happy
to pick up two wins this weekend,
and with a four-game weekend com
ing up — including a rematch
against UCLA — the team will take
all the momentum it can get.
