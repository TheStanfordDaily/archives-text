# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Team effort leads to two wins for Card 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last weekend's
gut-wrenching sudden
death loss to UCLA in the
Irvine Invitational Cham
pionship, the Stanford
women's water polo team
had two options: they
could either dwell on
being so close to defeating
the No. 1 Bruins, or they
could forget about the loss
and come back even
stronger for tough match
es against San Diego State
and Arizona State. Two
victories later, it is clear
which path they chose.
The Cardinal got back
to its winning ways by de
feating the No. 7 Aztecs on
Saturday and the No. 10
Sun Devils on Sunday at
Avery Aquatic Center.
Both of those teams are in
the MPSF, so Stanford's
conference record now
stands at 3-0, while its
overall record is 11-2.

GAME NOTES. Stanford has won two in a row
and nine of its last 10 after defeating San
Diego State and ASU at home last weekend.
This is just the fifth away match for the Card
this year, and the team has o 3-1 record on
the road so far. Santa Barbara won their first
four matches of the year before dropping
their last nine.

San Diego State actually came into Saturday's match-up with a
better record than the Cardinal, at 13-1.1 lowever, there was a rea
son they were not ranked higher than No. 7 â€” they had yet to play
a school ranked in the top eight. Stanford was by far their toughest
match-up of the season thus far, and the Card made sure the Aztecs
knew that from the beginning.
