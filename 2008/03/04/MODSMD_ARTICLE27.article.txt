# Card takes first, comes home for Senior Night

### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The mark of a great family is one that can
relish in the great times and survive with a pos
itive attitude through the hardest.
The No. 7 Stanford women's gymnastics
team has not had an easy season, but last week
end it managed to continue its winning streak,
placing first at the UNO "Flip for a Cure" in
Tempe, Ariz., with a strong score of 195.800.'1he
Cardinal competed against the No. 17 Arizona
State Sun Devils and San Jose State.
Although the women's gymnastics team
was coming off of a solid win against Cal last
week, the Card wasn't going to look past the
Sun Devils — Arizona State has been a tough
competitor over the last couple of years.
"ASU is definitely a good team, but we try
not to focus so much on who we are competing
against," said senior Alex Pintchouk. "We strive
to do our best against any opponent. In past
years, there has definitely been a home-court
advantage in the scores at ASU. but I think that
scores were fair this past weekend."
The Cardinal kept up its solid performance
on vault this week. Junior Nicole Ourada led
the team with a 9.925. Redshirt freshman Allyse
Ishino contributed to Ourada's solid routine
with a 9.875, followed closely by freshman Shel
ley Alexander and senior Stephanie Gentry,
both of whom earned a 9.825.
But for Stanford, the uneven bars routines
were the highlight of the meet.
"The bar performance was exciting as we
swung ourselves to the highest bar score of the
year," said senior Aimee Precourt. "It was awe
some to see the girls execute all the hard work

they have been putting in the gym and to do so
all together."
Seniors LizTricase andTabitha Yim led the
team on the bars.Tricase earned a 9.925 while
Yim received a 9.900. The two were not alone,
however: sophomore Carly Janiga and Oura
da followed closely behind, each earning a
9.875.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal struggled with
beam, which has been causing difficulty for the
team all season. Ishino had the team's stand
out performance, earning a 9.875. Junior Kelly
Fee also showed her strength on beam with
the team's second highest score of 9.825.
On floor, senior Lauren Elmore shined for
the second week in a row, earning the team's
highest score of 9.875. Fee and Pintchouk fol
lowed closely behind, earning 9.825 and 9.8(X).
respectively.
"We started out this season with a higher dif
ficulty level than in past years, and it was great
to get some experience early with that,"saidTri
case."Now our first priority is to maintain con
sistency. Once we have that down and we com
bine it with a few more upgrades, we'll be on our
way to NCAA Super Six Team Finals."
This last weekend was about proving the
Card's consistency and wanning up for this
coming weekend, which marks Senior Night at
Maples Pavilion.
Senior Night will be the last time the seniors
compete at home, and, though it marks the be
ginning of the end of the seniors' careers, it is
also about honoring the beginning of a great era
in Stanford women's gymnastics.
"It will be a little sad to feel like we're saying
goodbye, but it will really be a celebration of our
time here with [Stanford women's gymnas-

tics]," said Tricase. "You know it goes by fast,
and people tell you it goes by fast, but there isn't
much you can do to slow it down. You just have
to appreciate, savor and learn from each expe
rience as it happens," she added.
Stanford will be competing against No. 15
Nebraska and No. 5 Alabama, two teams that
have been powerhouses in NCAA gymnastics
since the beginning of the seniors' careers here
on the Farm.
"We still haven't gone 24 out of 24 this year,
so that would be nice, said Gentry." And we've
never beat Alabama here. That would be nice,
especially since it's Senior Night. Then from
there, we need consistency. If we're consistent,
we will win."
But what it really comes down to for these
seniors is leaving for future generations the
Super Six's legacy and love for the sport.
"We hope to leave our passion and love for
gymnastics."said Pintchouk."We also hope that
the up-and-coming team members know how
much we care about this team and what it
means to be a part of [Stanford women's gym
nastics]. We really enjoy doing what we do, and
we also have fun while doing it. [This] is a fami
ly, and we have amazing chemistry as group. We
hope that that continues with each new incom
ing class."
