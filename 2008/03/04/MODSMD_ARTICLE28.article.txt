## Cardinal men dive into Pac-10s 
### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's swim
ming team will face stiff competition
going into the Pac-10 Champi
onships, which start tomorrow. I low
ever. tough opposition didn't stop
the men's dive team last week at its
own Pac-10 Championships.
Competing in Federal Way,
Wash., the Stanford divers capped
off a strong showing at the Pac-10
Championships last Saturday.
The first day of competition fea
tured the three-meter competition,
in which Stanford freshman Brent
Eichenseer placed second and senior
Nathan Kim finished fourth.
Eichenseer placed a solid 365.85
while Kim entered a 335.85. Arizona
State's Mickey Benedetti won the
Pac-10 three-meter competition with
an incredible 398.85.
The second day of Pac-10 diving
championships featured the one
meter competition. Kim finished
third with 356.65 while Eichenseer
finished fifth with 308.35. Benedetti
won the one-meter again with
366.20.
The final day featured the plat
form competition. Kim finished
fourth with 344.00 while Eichenseer
finished third with 344.75.
Eichenseer and Kim both garnered
three top-five finishes on the week

end, giving the Cardinal swim team
great momentum heading into its
own Pac-10 Championships, which
begin tomorrow and run through
Saturday.
Skip Kenney, head coach of the
men's swim team, has won 26 consec
utive Pac-10 championships. Tradi
tion is certainly a big part of the pro
gram and contributes to Stanford's
amazingly strong team mentality in a
largely individual sport.
"By having a great team like the
one we have at the moment, each
time you step up on the blocks it is
not about racing for yourself, you do
it for your teammates," said junior
Jason Dunford."This enables people
to do extraordinary things, things
they did not think they were capable
of."
The main goal of the team will be
to get as many people qualifying for
NCAA cuts in order to bring as big
and strong a team as possible to the
NCAA Championships — which
will also be held in Federal Way —
on March 27. Junior captain Nate
Cass has an automatic A cut in the
2(X) breaststroke, while Jason Dun
ford and freshman Austin Staab have
A cuts in the KM) butterfly.
An A cut means that a player is
automatically eligible to compete in
the NCAA Championships, while
the fastest B cuts will be allowed to
compete to form 22-23 competitors

with A and B cuts in any single event.
Currently, Stanford is focusing on
the taper period, when swimmers
rest their bodies after intense work
outs earlier in season. Taper also
refers to focusing on little things like
turns, underwater kicking and starts
as opposed to building aerobic ca
pacity with lots of yardage.
"Training for sprinters differs in
that we lift weights during the mid
part of the season and then during
our taper period focus on short, fast
quality sets." said Dunford. "There is
less yardage swum by the sprinters
than distance and mid distance
swimmers, with more of an emphasis
on power and quickness in short
bursts."
"On our team, the only people to
have made 'A' cuts thus far are Nate
Cass in the 200 [breaststroke] and
Jason Dunford and Austin Staab in
the KM) [butterfly]," explained junior
captain Paul Kornfeld. "The 400
medley relay from this weekend was
just off the A cut by a couple tenths. 1
believe, so that also means that Eu
gene and I should qualify easily."
The men's swim team will seek to
extend its consecutive Pac-10 win
streak to 27 tomorrow when compe
tition starts at the Weyerhauser
Aquatic Center.
