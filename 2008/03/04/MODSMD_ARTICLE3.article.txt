## Students face rise in Pill prices Birth control pill prices rise after federal law 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vaden I lealth Center began stock
ing up on oral contraceptives when
Congress announced an act that
would cause costs to skyrocket. But
now, the low-cost pill packs stockpiled
at Vaden are on the verge of expiring.
Before the Deficit Reduction Act
of 2(X)5. which went into effect in
2007. pharmaceutical companies
received government subsidies to
reduce the price of oral contracep
tives at college health centers and
low-income health clinics. These clin
ics no longer receive the pills at sub
stantial discounts, resulting in a cost
increase for patients.
College campuses and over 4(H)
health clinics that provide health care
for underprivileged women have
been affected. Some colleges, like
Bowdoin College in Maine, have
stopped stocking contraceptives alto
gether. Others are stocking only the
morning after pill.
Robyn Tepper, director of Medical
Services at Vaden, said that while
costs have been creeping up over the
years, Vaden has no plans to stop pro
viding contraceptives.
"That won't ever be an issue
here," she said. "It's just not some
thing we would do. I don't ever have
to worry that a student can't get what
they need."
Previously, students paid at most
about $25 per month for birth control
pills purchased at Vaden. Patients
with Stanford's Cardinal Care insur
ance plan paid $10 per month for
generic pills and $25 for brand name
medications. Those without Cardinal
Care could still buy generic pills at
Vaden for $10 per month out of
pocket.
Once the low-cost pill packs run
out all students purchasing pills at
Vaden must pay the full price for oral
contraceptives. Some drugs have
doubled in price. Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Lo has i|uintupled in price — from
$10 to $50 per month.Those with out
side insurance plans may get reim
bursed. however.
While some students are already
paying the full price of the medica
tions. depending on brand, others
may be unaware of the changes. One
Stanford student, who wished to
remain anonymous due to privacy
issues, was shocked by the impending
dramatic increase in price. After find

ing out that her monthly supply of
medication may no longer cost $10,
she is now considering switching the
brand of her birth control.
"I'm going to use the two packs
they gave me, and then check out my
insurance policy," she said, referring
to the stockpiled clinic packs she
received from Vaden. "It I can't get
subsidized by insurance, then I'll
have to switch birth control."
Staff at the student-run Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center
(SHPRC) said the organization has
been unaffected by the legislation. Its
funds are already limited, and while
the SHPRC provides contraceptive
barrier methods, it can neither afford
to provide oral contraceptives nor is
it licensed to prescribe them. At the
moment, the SHPRC has no plan of
increasing its stock in condoms or
spermicide to counteract the avail
ability of other contraceptives.
At Vaden, however, Tepper saiil
the staff is trying to do everything it
can.
"We're willing to help out stu
dents to figure out what would be
most economical for them," she said.
