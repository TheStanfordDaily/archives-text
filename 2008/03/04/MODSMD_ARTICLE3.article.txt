## Students face rise in Pill prices Birth control pill prices rise after federal law 
### ANNEKE NELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vaden I lealth Center began stock
ing up on oral contraceptives when
Congress announced an act that
would cause costs to skyrocket. But
now, the low-cost pill packs stockpiled
at Vaden are on the verge of expiring.
Before the Deficit Reduction Act
of 2(X)5. which went into effect in
2007. pharmaceutical companies
received government subsidies to
reduce the price of oral contracep
tives at college health centers and
low-income health clinics. These clin
ics no longer receive the pills at sub
stantial discounts, resulting in a cost
increase for patients.
College campuses and over 4(H)
health clinics that provide health care
for underprivileged women have
been affected. Some colleges, like
Bowdoin College in Maine, have
stopped stocking contraceptives alto
gether. Others are stocking only the
morning after pill.
Robyn Tepper, director of Medical
Services at Vaden, said that while
costs have been creeping up over the
years, Vaden has no plans to stop pro
viding contraceptives.
"That won't ever be an issue
here," she said. "It's just not some
thing we would do. I don't ever have
to worry that a student can't get what
they need."
