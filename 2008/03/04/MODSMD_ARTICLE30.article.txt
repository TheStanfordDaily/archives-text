Cardinal men hold off Wolverines
The No. 1 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team beat the No. 6 Michigan
Wolverines 361.300-361.150 in Ann
Arbor last Sunday, despite the ab
sence of top competitors junior Sho
Nakamori and senior Dave Sender.
Michigan defeated No. 2 Penn State
earlier in the season, and the Wolver
ines gave the Cardinal all it could han
dle in a closely contested meet.
Nakamori and Sender are in Doha,
Qatar, competing for the US National
Team in the 2008 World Cup.
Stanford began on floor exercise,
one of the team's strongest events.
Redshirt sophomore Greg Ter-Za
khariants's score of 15.500 won the
event, in which he is currently ranked
fifth in the nation. Pommel horse fol
lowed. and Stanford's first competi
tors struggled. Freshman Josh Dixon
only managed a 13.350, Ter-Zakhari
ants scored 13.500 and freshman Ryan
Lieberman disappointed with a
12.150.
Freshman Kyle Oi. who has fought
all season to earn a spot in the lineup,
came through with a very good set that
earned him a score of 14.650. His rou
tine put some wind back in the Cardi
nal's sails, and senior Chris Harper
capped off the event with a high score
of 15.150.
"We were a little sloppy," said
Harper. "Lieberman had a bad set on
horse, but he stuck his set on [parallel
bars] and finished the meet really
well."
On rings, strong performances
from freshman Tim Gentry, junior
Bryant Hadden and Lieberman kept
the Stanford men close. But it was on
vault that they put themselves in posi
tion for victory.
Stanford is ranked fourth in the
NCAA on vault, and the team showed
off its depth on Sunday. Competitors
turned in high scores across the board,
with ler-Zakhariants, Dixon. Lieber
man. freshman Alex Buscaglia and
seniors Eli Alcaraz and Dylan Carney
all earning scores of 15.450 or higher.
Lieberman went on to win parallel
bars with a stellar routine that earned
a score of 15.500, while co-captain
Carney exhibited his consistent excel
lence en route to winning high bar
(15.400).

competes in its final dual meet of the
season this Saturday when it hosts the
Cal in "The Big 112 lip Off." The meet
