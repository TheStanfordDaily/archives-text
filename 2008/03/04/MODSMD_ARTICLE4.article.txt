# Law Prof. Lessig to launch new initiative
## Web site will advocate reforms to Congressional finance

Lawrence Lessig will not be run
ning for a seat in the House of
Representatives, but that does not
mean that he is slowing down his
campaign to change Congress.
Instead of pursuing public serv
ice as a means of furthering his
anti-corruption agenda. Lessig will
address the problems he thinks are
crippling Congress in much the
same way he approached copyright
reform over the last decade —
through the Internet.
Lessig will concentrate on build
ing a new Web site: www.change
congress.org.The site will include a
tool that will allow Congressional
candidates to select their level of
commitment to the Change
Congress reforms, an application
that will enable people to make
donations to candidates who have
committed to reform and a Web
page that will encourage people to
run against candidates who do not
support reforms.
"The Internet is just a tool."
Lessig said to'lTie Daily, describing
his intention to create a bipartisan
advisory board that would supple

ment the Web site. "It exists in par
allel with talking to people about
the changes face to face."
Lessig hopes that the advisory
board and Web site will build broad
bipartisan support for his three
core reforms — getting
Congressmen to stop accepting
money from Political Action
Committees (PACs) and lobbyists,
ban earmarks and eventually get
public financing for Congressional
campaigns.
"I don't think this is something
that all Democrats or all
Republicans will sign up for."
Lessig said. "We need more and
more people to recognize that we
can have strong, heated disagree
ments over issues, but core agree
ments about these reforms."
Hut not everyone agrees that
Lessig's proposals are realistic.
"These are all low probability
outcomes," said Political Science
Prof. Morris Fiorina. "You are ask
ing people to go against their
incentives — their electoral incen
tives— and you would have to
have some sort of massive outside
pressure."
Banning earmarks, which politi
cians use to set aside funds for spe
cific purposes that will help their

districts or states, would force
politicians to compromise their
interests.
" ITiere has been a radical explo
sion of earmarks," l.essig said.
" Ihis gives incumbents a dramatic
advantage. "Hie closest thing to real
corruption is earmarks. Iliey are
totally perverse in a democracy."
Fiorina agreed with I essig but
cautioned that some earmarks can
be appropriate, and even necessary,
pointing to the federal research
grant process. Before earmarks
became prevalent, the vast majori
ty of grants were given to universi
ties like Stanford and Harvard.
Now, smaller schools like Marshall
and Texas A&M are given more
federal money.
"It is completely out of hand,"
Fiorina said. "But not all earmarks
constitute corruption, though some
clearly do."
Fiorina was skeptical that
Lessig's Web site would be effec
tive in banning earmarks.
"It's kind of like unilateral dis
armament." he said. "Any number
of candidates will be able to finesse
the issue that way by saying there
will have to be a universal commit
ment to ban earmarks, otherwise I
will have to hurt my constituents."
Lessig admitted that public
financing for campaigns is a vague
goal, though he still has high hopes
for reform.
"There have been a lot of great
experiments [with public financing]
at the state level," Lessig said, point
ing to programs in Arizona and
Maine. "What we need to see is
more of that experimentation, prob
ably starting at the Senate to see
exactly how it should be structured."
Fiorina, however, also doubted
the feasibility of public financing.
"Most people I know are in favor
of it,"he said. "But it is hard to get
incumbents to provide enough
financing to make their challengers
credible. I"hey are well-meaning
reforms, but you have to have a lot
of pressure to overcome the elec
toral incentives of candidates."
Although Lessig is committed to
continuing his Change Congress
campaign from an academic per
spective, he still wonders about
what could have been if he had
decided to run for Congress in the
Apr. 8 special election for
Congressional District 12.
"It's impossible to make a deci
sion like that without fearing that

you made a fundamental mistake."
Lessig said. "Succeeding could have
been amazing. It's not a decision 1
will ever feel 1(X) percent comfort
able with."
Fiorina agrees that the decision
was a prudent one.
"When 1 heard he was thinking
of running, 1 thought he didn't have
a prayer," Fiorina said. "He's a very
qualified guy and well-known, but
she [his would-be opponent Jackie
SpeierJ is a very popular and experi
enced politician, and it was going to
be a long shot."
Lessig says he now has no plans
to enter public service.
"I will continue to play the role 1
play academically by working on
these programs in an academic
manner," Lessig said. "1 have not
had any conversations with the
Obama campaign about accepting a
role in the administration. 1 would
be very surprised if they ask me to
do anything in the administration
because I am extremely controver
sial in a number of circles."
Lessig is settling in for a long
fight as he attempts to change
Congress.
"1 never expected that this would
happen quickly," Lessig said. "1
think it is going to take many years
and many cycles. It's going to take
many more people becoming
involved."
