Lawrence Lessig will not be run
ning for a seat in the House of
Representatives, but that does not
mean that he is slowing down his
campaign to change Congress.
Instead of pursuing public serv
ice as a means of furthering his
anti-corruption agenda. Lessig will
address the problems he thinks are
crippling Congress in much the
same way he approached copyright
reform over the last decade —
through the Internet.
Lessig will concentrate on build
ing a new Web site: www.change
congress.org.The site will include a
tool that will allow Congressional
candidates to select their level of
commitment to the Change
Congress reforms, an application
that will enable people to make
donations to candidates who have
committed to reform and a Web
page that will encourage people to
run against candidates who do not
support reforms.
"The Internet is just a tool."
Lessig said to'lTie Daily, describing
his intention to create a bipartisan
advisory board that would supple

ment the Web site. "It exists in par
allel with talking to people about
the changes face to face."
Lessig hopes that the advisory
board and Web site will build broad
bipartisan support for his three
core reforms — getting
Congressmen to stop accepting
money from Political Action
Committees (PACs) and lobbyists,
ban earmarks and eventually get
public financing for Congressional
campaigns.
"I don't think this is something
that all Democrats or all
Republicans will sign up for."
Lessig said. "We need more and
more people to recognize that we
can have strong, heated disagree
ments over issues, but core agree
ments about these reforms."
Hut not everyone agrees that
Lessig's proposals are realistic.
"These are all low probability
outcomes," said Political Science
Prof. Morris Fiorina. "You are ask
ing people to go against their
incentives — their electoral incen
tives— and you would have to
have some sort of massive outside
pressure."
Banning earmarks, which politi
cians use to set aside funds for spe
cific purposes that will help their

districts or states, would force
politicians to compromise their
interests.
" ITiere has been a radical explo
sion of earmarks," l.essig said.
" Ihis gives incumbents a dramatic
advantage. "Hie closest thing to real
corruption is earmarks. Iliey are
totally perverse in a democracy."
Fiorina agreed with I essig but
cautioned that some earmarks can
be appropriate, and even necessary,
pointing to the federal research
grant process. Before earmarks
became prevalent, the vast majori
ty of grants were given to universi
ties like Stanford and Harvard.
Now, smaller schools like Marshall
and Texas A&M are given more
federal money.
"It is completely out of hand,"
Fiorina said. "But not all earmarks
constitute corruption, though some
clearly do."
Fiorina was skeptical that
Lessig's Web site would be effec
tive in banning earmarks.
"It's kind of like unilateral dis
armament." he said. "Any number
of candidates will be able to finesse
the issue that way by saying there
will have to be a universal commit
