## Calories in eatery fare scrutinized Some students surprised by online nutrition information 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In January.'Hie Daily reported that the
Axe & Palm was rolling out plans to add
more vegetarian options to its dining
menu ("Axe iV: Palm to freshen menu").
But the question remains: does vegetarian
mean healthy?
A number of options at the Axe &
Palm, the Alumni Cafe. Union Square at
Tresidder and Olives contain a high num
ber of calories (see table). While junk food
staples such as onion rings and desserts
pack in the fat content. Ilie Daily found
that so do many options like salads — the
Axe & Palm's California Cobb Salad, for
example, contains l )()5 calories.
Even many vegetarian options are high
in calorie content. A Grilled Garden
Burger at the Axe & Palm contains .*24
calories — 33 more than the basic A\c &
Palm Burger. The "l.ittle Venice"
Vegetarian Sandwich at Olives contains
7l l > calories; Olives' Pita I'alafels: 1.1X5
calories. The Farmer's Market Grape
Salad at Union Square: SI I calories.
Acting Executive Director of Stanford
Dining Eric Montcll. however, defended
Stanford Dining's offerings and insisted
that there .ire no "hidden calories" in any
of the cafe menus at Stanford. Stanford
Dining provides nutritional infoimation
for its eateries at dining.stanford.edu.
"We firmly believe in providing healthy
and nutritious food at all of the campus
restaurants that Stanford Dinintr man
ages." Montcll said. "Our team of award
winning chefs, registered dietitians
and culinary professionals work
hard to ensure that students are
offered a nutritious and outstanding
meal each and every day."
Montell said that some of the less
healthy options are offered because
of customer interest. He insisted
that students have a variety of din
ing options, many of which are
healthy. The Axe & Palm Veggie
Melt contains only 262 calories, and
an Athenian Salad at Olives con
tains a mere 48 calories. A six-inch
Veggie Delite at Subway contains
about 230 calories.
Montell added that Stanford
Dining is very receptive to student
input, and students can provide
feedback to the dining staff via the
dining Web site, comment cards or
dining committees.
Some students, nonetheless, were
surprised to hear about the high
calorie content of some offerings on
campus.
"1 think that the names of the
foods are misleading," said Taylor
Thibodeaux "11. "A salad should not
have that many calories [as the
California Cobb Salad does]. For
people trying to eat healthily, this
doesn't help."
Students pointed out that eating
healthy at campus eateries is a chal
lenge in particular for students who
depend on them as their main
source of meals.
"1 feel that Stanford does a good

job with providing a variety of
foods," said Nick Hartfield '09. "But
the Axe & Palm caters to a group
that has to eat there everyday, like
grad students or people who have
classes during normal dining hall
lunch times, so it's especially impor
tant that they provide a variety of
healthy options as well."
"Also, there are almost no vegan
options," Hartfield added.
William Lindemann '11 suggest-

Ed that nutritional information
should be more readily available, as
many students will not make the
effort to view Stanford Dining's
Web site.
"But." he pointed out."as long as
there are healthy options, then it
should be up to those healthy eaters
to seek out healthier options."
