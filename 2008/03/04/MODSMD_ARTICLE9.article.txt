## How low can you go? Sophomore slump kills. Slowly. 
### CHELSEA MA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
B t gives distraught freshmen some comfort to think of their first year at Stan
ford as experimental. There are still interests to dig into, study skills to try out.
I HUM and Math 51 to take. A couple of low grades aren't the end of the world.
But perhaps these frosh year GPAs will start to look quite nice once next year
comes along — and with it. a sophomore slump.
So what exactly is this slump? Is it a condition from which the shoulders droop
from the weight of carrying too many books? Or is it a state of post-freshman year
disenchantment and self-doubt?
"1 think everyone has their own idea about the sophomore slump because it
manifests itself in varying degrees in different people," said Chris Baclig '09, a
Resident Assistant (RA) in Toyon,an all-sophomore dorm."lf freshman year is
adjusting to Stanford as a college and a home, I would say sophomore year is
more like adjusting to the rest of your life at Stanford, academically and so
cially."

The transition from freshman to sophomore year is a big one. Classes
tend to get harder as they become more geared towards a specific
major, leaving students with doubts about the compatibility of their
goals with their capabilities. Many fear that they are trekking the
wrong academic path, or that they will never find the right one
at all.
"Clearly, sophomores are not freshmen, yet, neither are they
quite full-fledged major-declared upperclassmen," said Toyon Res
ident Fellow (RF) Amy Friedman. "It's a sort of in-between year, if
you will, and with that comes some ambivalence."

Baclig observed the increased pressure on residents to discover sub
ject areas in which they are genuinely interested.
"In Toyon, I have noticed many residents coming to me and asking academic
questions regarding picking a major and finding classes to take," he said." It seems
like there is a general concern about having a planned academic future, especial-

It's particularly difficult to stay as excited as
you were as a freshman.

ly since sophomore year is usually the time to declare a major."
The slump may also entail social dissatisfaction resulting from the
changed dynamic within the dorm. Friends made the year before
may wind up on the opposite side of campus. Even forming new
friendships can be tough, as students tend to stay within the confines
of their draw groups.
Tommy Tobin TO noted that he and many of his peers are also bur
dened by over-commitment to too many extracurriculars.That, plus
an elevated sense of responsibility to coursework and urgency to
pick an academic track,can throw students into what Tobin describes
as a sort of "turmoil."
"1 think the sophomore slump is a very real thing — I see a lot of
my friends going through it, and 1 imagine a lot of it has to do with
picking majors," he said. "To a point. I don't feel like it's nearly as
bad for me as it is for my fellow sophomores, but it's particularly dif
ficult to stay as excited as you were as a freshman."
Yet. the slump isn't like some virus that attacks students in a sim
ilar manner.The academic and social lull affects people to varying
degrees, and not all sophomores are afflicted with the slump —
many get it later in their college careers, or not at all.
For those who do feel lost in this limbo between exploring and
pursuing, there's always help. Students are encouraged to scope
out resources that were advertised freshman year — The Bridge,
Vaden's Counseling And Psychological Services, Sweet Hall — as
well as tutors, residence staff and faculty. Students can also attend
"Sophomore Slumpßusters," designed to help relieve stress, build
community and hone various skills.
"I think there are ways that people can work with it and
through it," Friedman said of the sophomore slump. "New
this year at Toyon, we have a sophomore academic advi
sor who has office hours here a couple of days a week to
talk with students about their academic concerns."
So while the sophomore slump may not be avoid
able. it's important to note that there's plenty students
can do to ease it. Find a balance in life,figure out what ac
tivities are most important and seek the help of friends,
faculty and counselors. Besides, the general consensus is
that we are faring much better than our friends back east, be
cause for the most part, we have nice weather.
