The Jewish holiday of Purim will be here in two weeks.
In light of the recent violence in the Middle East, the Jewish Student Association
! and the Stanford Israel Alliance are partnering with the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network and the Islamic Society of Stanford University to create Purim gifts
and care-packages for the children living in fear in Israel and in Gaza. Each day
the citizens of Sderot and Gaza live in fear and terror, as rockets and missiles are
directed towards their homes. As a result, these children must constantly live in
fear as they await the next act of violence in their town.
Let us stand together in solidarity and do our share as part of a humanitarian ef
s-m. fort to help bring comfort to these children. In the spirit of giving for the upcoming
9 Purim Holiday, come to White Plaza and help SIA, JSA, MSAN, and ISSIJ send
"Mishloach Manot" (Purim gift baskets) and care-packages to the children of
Sderot and Gaza.
S We alone cannot bring Peace to the Middle East;
but we can give these children just a little *
1 Peace of Mind for the upcoming holidays. w3t
