## ASSU addresses errors in special fees process Senators to exempt font groups from petition 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate discussed last night how to
best approach errors made in the
special fees process.
Hie constitutional by-laws state
that any group that has a significant
increase — over 10 percent — in its
special fees allocations must then
petition in order to receive funding
in the current year.
The 10 percent was to be calculat
ed based only on the amount of spe
cial fees funding that the group had
the previous year. However, while
making calculations, the Senate
based the 10 percent figure on the
sum of the special fees funding and
reserves money combined.
As a result, the amount of money
that the Senate allocated to each of
four groups — KZSU, AASA,
Stanford NAACP and Stanford
Dance Marathon — was beyond the
10 percent increase.
"In extenuating circumstances,"
Senator Luukas lives '09 said, "the

ASSU legislatures are able to place a
special fee group on the ballot with
out petitioning even if their budget
has increased by more than 10 per
cent. We will be voting on resolu
tions to do so for KZSU, Dance
Marathon, A ASA and NAACP next
week."
Senators felt that asking the
groups to petition was unreasonable
this late in the process.
"Because of some accounting
errors in the appropriations process,"
lives continued, "it didn't come to
our attention that these groups
would have to petition for their
budget increases. By the time this
came to the undergraduate senate's
attention, we felt that it was too late
to force these groups to petition."
The Senate also discussed the
success of its event last week. "Come
Complain Here."
"We held office hours every week
this last quarter, and we didn't get
one comment," Senator Jose
Benchimol '08 said. "And. then, one
day. we hold an event and we get
fifty comments. 1 think this is some
thing that needs to be done every
quarter."
