## Tour program travels the world Alumni take trips with noted public figures 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF-WRITER 
Alumni tours made national
headlines earlier this month when
The Wall Street Journal reported
that many college alumni groups
are enhancing their travel pro
grams. But Stanford's program is far
from new — alumni have been glo
betrotting together since 1968.
Stanford Travel/Study was start
ed in 1968 by then Dean of
Admission Rixford Snyder in con
junction with the Stanford Alumni
Association. Today the program
runs year-round, offering 60 trips to
80 countries for its alumni.
"[Snyder] wanted to offer alumni
the opportunity to study abroad —
something they didn't have the
opportunity to do when they were
students at Stanford," said
Travel/Study Director Brett
Thompson '83. "The purpose then.

and continues now, is to engage
alumni with the educational vitality
of the University.
Stanford groups were among the
first tourists to China when it
opened to the West in 1978, and
among the first to visit Cuba, Libya,
Antarctica and even the North Pole.
Next month, Stanford graduates,
along with those from Harvard and
Yale, will join President George
H.W. Bush on a cruise ship bound
for Hong Kong.
Other influential individuals
who have been part of Travel/Study
trips include Mikhail Gorbachev.
Lech Walesa, Madeleine Albright.
George W. Bush. Peruvian
President Alejandro Toledo A.M.
'72 and U.S. Ambassador to Italy
Ron Spogli '70.
Thompson said the program also
allows faculty to travel to the same
locations where they conduct
research.
"On one trip alumni travelers
helped [Anthropology] Prof, John
Rick excavate his dig at Chavin de
Huantar," Thompson said. "On
other trips, [Classics] Prof. Marsh

McCall has given a reading of the
slaying of Hector by Achilles from
Homer's Iliad at the theater in
Troy."
"Education is the key to our suc
cess," he added. "[Stanford] is
known in the industry for its innova
tion, which is often inspired by our
faculty leaders who are our valued
partners and the highlight of our
trips."
I"he Travel/Study program, how
ever, is not restricted only to alumni.
Thompson said certain trips are also
open to families of alumni.
"For 12 years we have been run
ning family trips to China, the
Galapagos, Tanzania, Italy, Egypt,
Greece and Costa Rica," TTiompson
said. "Parents enjoy sharing a bit of
their Stanford educational experi
ence with their kids, and the kids
have a great time communicating
with local pen pals, having their own
Olympics in Greece and learning
how to make pasta and gelato in
Italy, among other activities."
