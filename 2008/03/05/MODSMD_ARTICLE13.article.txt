## Editorial Board Students would benefit from service-based "bridge year" 
### 
Recently, Princeton University pro
posed the creation of a "bridge year"
program, in which admitted students
could participate in a year of University
subsidized service in a foreign country prior
to beginning their freshman year. The Daily
commends Princeton's initiative and rec
ommends instituting a similar program to
complement Stanford's study abroad pro
grams.
Many students already take a "gap
year," a year between high school and col
lege spent working, traveling or doing com
munity service. Holly Bull, president of the
Center for Interim Programs, a support
service that aids students in planning gap
years, discussed the merits of taking such a
year in a 2006 article in The Chronicle of
Higher Education. Bull called the gap year
"a jewel of a period of time for students to
creatively step away from the lock-step
path of high school to college to graduate
school or job."
Princeton is attempting to further en
courage the gap year by formally institu
tionalizing it. The purpose of the universi
ty's plan for a so-named "bridge year,"
which would emphasize community service,
would be many-fold. It would offer a year
away from academic studies, promote a
global outlook, help students become more
acutely aware of global disparities and
allow students to learn first-hand about the
issues facing those less fortunate around the
world.
Princeton plans to offer free tuition to
students during their gap year. Financial as
sistance, combined with logistical aid in
planning the year, will make taking a bridge

year an accessible and practical option for
interested students.
Stanford already recognizes the value in
taking time off for study, work, religious,
health and other reasons — students are al
lowed to take leaves of absence for a cumu
lative total of two years. Thus. Stanford al
ready supports students who take years off
for un-institutionalized personal explo
ration; encouraging students to take a gap
year could further enhance this self-explo
ration that the University encourages.
Working to improve the world is a core
value for many Stanford students, and a
service year would broaden many students'
understanding of the world as they prepare
to immerse themselves in their studies, and
the Stanford Bubble, for the next four years.
The Bing Overseas Study Program (BOSP)
offers students a wide variety of countries in
which to study, but the advantages of expe
riencing another culture and gaining an in
ternational perspective could be even
greater when coupled with a service ele
ment. Additionally, living in one country for
an entire year, as opposed to a few months,
would help students thoroughly learn its
foreign language and culture.
The Daily by no means wishes to deni
grate the value of studying abroad — BOSP
is an essential part of the Stanford experi
ence. A wider selection of study and service
abroad programs, however, would allow
students different opportunities and experi
ences. Both the University and its students
would greatly benefit from supplementing
its existing overseas study opportunities
with a Stanford-sponsored, service-orient
ed bridge year option.
