My main goal in life is to he happy.
Unfortunately, 1 have no clue how
to achieve this goal. So, I turned to
the Internet for answers. On that vast and
wonderful resource I found a survey con
ducted by the UK's New Scientist magazine,
which concluded that Nigeria was the happi
est country of the 65 surveyed, followed by
Mexico, Venezuela and El Salvador.
Now, this may be ringing alarm bells in
your mind. Nigeria is poor: it's citizens have
a lower average income, educational attain
ment and life expectancy than the United
States. How could they be happier than us?
The researchers who conducted this sur
vey also concluded that happiness has not
risen appreciably in the West since World
War 11, despite massive increases in income.
It appears that income is unrelated to
happiness. Perhaps, then, the average level
of happiness has always been constant.
Maybe the cavemen were exactly as happy
as we are today.They didn't live as long, and
their lives were full of physical exertion and
constant struggle, but because they didn't
know any better, they thought their lives
were just hunky-dory. Those cavemen lived,
learned and loved in exactly the same way
we do. Perhaps they found their struggles to
be just as fulfilling as we find our own.
And if that is true, then what is the point
of helping those less fortunate than our
selves? Are the metrics by which we meas
ure human welfare actually worth anything?
What is the point of increasing life expectan
cy or raising income if it doesn't make peo
ple any happier?
The purpose of humanitarian effort is
mostly aimed at alleviating suffering, thus
increasing the net amount of happiness in
the world. Granted, there are tens of mil
lions of people who struggle to find food,
and international aid helps decrease their
suffering. Once basic needs such as food and
shelter are met, however, the survey implies
that material gain may not necessarily in
crease happiness.
Perhaps we would be better served by
finding the root causes of happiness, and
then working within that framework. What if
happiness is largely relative?
What if our happiness is largely derived
by comparing our situation to those of other
people around us? If we consider our situa-

tion to be above average, we are satisfied,
and if we view it as below average, then we
are not. If happiness is largely relative, then
efforts to increase global communication
will only decrease happiness in poorer areas.
What if ignorance really is bliss? What if
poorer people within the United States did
not know the relative wealth of their fellow
countrymen? They would view their state,
which is objectively worse in terms of mate
rial wealth, as being the natural order of
things.
What if each generation is just as dissatis
fied as the one before it? If that is true, then
nothing we strive for will benefit our descen
dants. They will take for granted what they
are born with, and seek even more.
I have been given the good life, one with
every conceivable advantage. Yet is my
chance of achieving happiness no greater
than that of anyone else?
