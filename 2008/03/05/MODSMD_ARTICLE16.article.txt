# Co-terminal Illness
## The 						herbivore's dilemma 
### 
1 guess 1 was never aware of the visceral dis
like many people have of vegetarianism
until I started turning down meatball subs
and bi-weekly trips to In-N-Out.To some of
my friends, it was as if 1 had become a Pod
Person: "Not you, too!"
I'm not a strict vegetarian. I'm more of a
pseudo, half-assed, quasi-tarian. I try to avoid
meat, but I don't go out of my way to avoid it.
Sometimes I shamelessly gorge myself, like
when I traveled to Argentina, where beef is
served in two-foot long slabs and where eat
ing mashed potatoes is considered "eating
your greens."
It's a relatively recent decision, and one I
made with shockingly little research before
hand to back it up. Basically. I read a few arti
cles about the negative environmental impact
of the meat industry, as well as the book "The
Lives of Animals" by the Nobel Prize-win
ning author J.M. Coetzee. I figured I'd give it
a trial period.no purchase necessary.
At first it was tough. 1 discovered that Safe
way's meatless options were terrible and over
priced. (Plus, they raised their prices on beer,
which is crap ... and what's the deal with that
random Club Card system?) 1 also learned
that a lot of restaurants and retailers have no
idea how to deal with vegetarians. Until re
cently. the Tresidder Subway was charging
more for a veggie sub than for their Italian
sub, which included all of the same vegetables
in addition to two different kinds of processed
meat. I didn't understand why you wouldn't
just order the Italian sub with "no meat."
I think some people are at least a little sus
picious of vegetarians. This suspicion. I think,
is rooted in pernicious belief that all vegetar
ians in fact are emasculated, driven by guilt
and think of themselves as ethically superior.
The emasculation rhetoric has a long and
storied history, but my favorite example
comes from the philosopher William James in
a barbed comparison of Christian saints to

&
Brendan

more Machiavellian types. He writes: "Com
pared to these beaked and taloned graspers
of the world [the Machiavellians], saints are
herbivorous animals, tame and harmless
barnyard poultry."
ITiis boils down to a sophisticated take on
an old schoolyard taunt:"Chicken!"
Ihe complaint that vegetarians are driven
by guilt is fed by organizations like PETA,
ultra-utilitarian rationalists like Peter Singer
(who will be speaking at Stanford in the
spring), and intellectuals like the fictional
Elizabeth Costello from Coetzee's "Lives of
Animals," who outrageously likens the killing
of animals to the Holocaust. Unfortunately,
most people associate vegetarianism with
such burdensome guilt-tripping.
Guilt is always a bad starting point in ethics,
and my philosophy is to avoid it at all costs. For
people who love meat but think that they
should generally cut down on their consump
tion of it, there's no reason to feel guilty about
a half-assed approach. That's like saying we
should all stop driving cars tomorrow (or ever)
because we know oil consumption is fueling
political instability and global warming. In
many cases, one ass-cheek is better than two.
The third great pet peeve against vegetar
ians is their holier-than-thou attitude. When 1
turn down meat in the company of friends,
they often become really defensive, as if my
decision carried an implicit judgment on their
own preferences (which it shouldn't). You'd
think the vegetarian option was the ethical
nuclear option.

When I was working in Yellowstone Na
tional Park last summer, I lived with a couple
of guys who loved hunting. One of them, an
ex-Marine, had even carted a dead elk up
from Colorado in the back of his pickup
truck. (By the way, elk burgers: delicious).
When he saw me cooking a tofu stir-fry one
night, he seemed personally offended. He
proceeded to tell me a tale of woe about how
he had grown up next to a foul-smelling, un
sanitary, unhealthy tofu factory. (If only Sin
clair Lewis were alive today, he could write a
muckraking expose on BigTofu.)The point is
that even eating certain tell-tale vegetarian
foods can make other people feel defensive,
especially if they think you're trying to act
hippy-dippy and superior.
The good news is that American society
seems to be moving away from its strict divi
sion between meat-eaters and vegetarians or
vegans. More nuanced thinkers like Michael
Pollan have drawn attention to how the food
industry relates to other social issues like agri
cultural subsidies and the health care system.
Besides, as The Economist pointed out in a re
cent cover story, the global rise in commodity
prices (spurred by rising energy costs) means
that the age of super-cheap food might be
over. I suspect this will make people increas
ingly thoughtful and picky about what they
eat, since they're going to shell out more for it
anyway.
As the campus continues to pay attention
to the politics of food, I hope people realize
that eating less meat isn't some form of
haughty exceptionalism. It's just a choice
some of us make.

Eating less meat doesn't make you a Pod Per
son although this does raise an interesting ques
tion: Since Pod People are grown from seeds,
does that mean it would he OK for vegetarians
to eat them ? Email Brendan with your thoughts

Pollan have drawn attention to how the food
industry relates to other social issues like agri
cultural subsidies and the health care system.
Besides, as The Economist pointed out in a re
cent cover story, the global rise in commodity
prices (spurred by rising energy costs) means
that the age of super-cheap food might be
over. I suspect this will make people increas
ingly thoughtful and picky about what they
eat, since they're going to shell out more for it
anyway.
As the campus continues to pay attention
to the politics of food, I hope people realize
that eating less meat isn't some form of
haughty exceptionalism. It's just a choice
some of us make.

Eating less meat doesn't make you a Pod Per
son although this does raise an interesting ques
tion: Since Pod People are grown from seeds,
does that mean it would he OK for vegetarians
to eat them ? Email Brendan with your thoughts
