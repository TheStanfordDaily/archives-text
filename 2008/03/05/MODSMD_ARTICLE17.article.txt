GAME NOTES: The Stanford baseball team
could not continue its win streak yesterday
against rival California. The Cardinal pitching
faltered, giving up 12 hits and eight runs.
Stanford was led by freshman third baseman
Zach Jones, who drove in all three of Stan
ford's runs with his second homerun of the
season in the seventh inning. The Cardinal will
look to pick up a win today against Saint
Mary's, who beat Stanford 4-2 a week ago.

damage to just those three runs on eight hits
and three walks over 5.1 innings pitched.
The real problems for the Cardinal (6-3)
came at the plate and from the bullpen.
Freshman Michael Marshall started strong,
getting Fearnow off the hook when he came
on in relief to get out of a one-out. bases
loaded jam. But Marshall would go on to fal
ter in just his second collegiate appearance,
allowing five runs over the next 1.1 innings of
work.
Offensively, the Cardinal did manage to
tie the game at three runs thanks to freshman
Zach Jones' three-run homer in the seventh.
It was Jones' second career homerun for
Stanford, who notched his first in the first at
bat of his collegiate career against Nebraska.
But Jones' heroics stood alone as Stanford's
bats went cold,collecting just one more hit in
the remainder of the game.
The Bears battled back with all the runs
they'd need in the bottom half of the inning,
as Rich Gorman was hit by a pitch to lead off
the inning before advancing into scoring po
sition on a sacrifice bunt.The Cardinal, in an
attempt to set up a potential inning ending
double play, intentionally walked David
Cooper before a single loaded the bases with
one out. Brett Jackson's subsequent two RBI
single down the right field line would effec
tively seal the win for the Bears.
On the whole, California out-hit the Car
dinal 12-8 and allowed just two walks to
Stanford's five. Five Stanford starters went
hitless on the day, with only Jones, junior left
fielder Joey August and junior second base
man Cord Phelps collecting multiple hits on
the afternoon.
Stanford will stay on the road tomorrow
with a trip to face the Gaels of Saint Mary's,
who surprised the Cardinal with a 4-2 win at
Sunken Diamond last week. Stanford then
takes a longer trip, heading to Austin. Tex.
this weekend to take on the Longhorns in a
three-game series.
