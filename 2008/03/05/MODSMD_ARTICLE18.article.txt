# Believe in the Warriors
## 
### 
There are times watching sports
when you can't help but think
you're witnessing a once in a
lifetime occurrence. The moments
you know you'll remember 10 years
from now, or quite possibly for the
rest of your life. Sometimes those mo
ments are a buzzer-beating shot or a
last-second touchdown. Other times
it's an entire game where the under
dog somehow beats the heavy fa
vorite, or even a season when a team
does more than you could have ever
expected.
The funny thing is that how often
these moments occur apparently has
very little to do with how good a team
actually is. For evidence there, look
no further than our recent Bay Area
sports history, where we've seen the
collapse in recent years of local teams
in just about every sport imaginable.
The 49ers, Raiders, Giants, Athletics,
Cardinal football team, and Golden
State Warriors are all either emerging
from, entering or in the midst of truly
trying times for their respective fan
bases.
And yet, there has been a multi
tude of moments, games and late sea
son-surges here in recent years that
we've all been privileged enough to
witness. Who will ever forget Stan
ford's win over USC this fall? How
many members of the Class of 2008
will forget the one year that they got
to see a Big Game win?
And yet, perhaps the most memo
rable local upset in recent years has
come on the hardwood off-campus,
as the Golden State Warriors were
the first eighth-seeded team to defeat
a No. 1 seed in a seven-game playoff
series last year when they downed
Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Maver
icks in six.


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Roves
It was a classic match-up between
the brash owner and his jilted coach,
a monster scorer in Dirk and the Dr.
Frankenstein who cobbled his game
together in Don Nelson. And when
the Warriors' fearless, nothing-to
lose attitude won out convincingly
over the all-hat. no-cattle Mavs, we
all knew we'd witnessed something
special. It was the ultimate story of
chemistry over talent, scheme over
size, the hope of a formerly mori
bund organization against the ex
pectations of one of the flagship
franchises of the NBA.
But what made the Warriors
upset so memorable wasn't just what
it signaled for that moment — the
downfall of the top seed in the West
and Golden State's hard-fought op
portunity to lose in the next round to
Utah — but rather what it signaled
for the long term future of the Asso
ciation, the Western Conference and
the Warriors.
Because unlike so many Cin
derella stories, the Warriors followed
through and kept winning.They took
one magical postseason series, and
transformed it into a new brand of
basketball. If anything, the Warriors
are better now then they were last
year, given the continued develop
ment of guard Monta Ellis and the
addition of Brandan Wright via the
draft. 'ITiey're currently on pace to
make their second playoff appear
ance in as many years after more
than a decade of losing.
Golden State's ascent, though,
meant more than just the rise of a
single NBA franchise. No, it was the
biggest sign to date that the West is
where the league will be won for the
foreseeable future. If the eighth seed
in the West is capable of knocking
out its first seeded counterpart, a
great deal can be said about the
depth and talent of the conference.
And those circumstances have only
grown more pronounced since last
year.
Indeed, if we were truly taking
the best 16 teams from the whole of
the NBA. how many Eastern Con
ference teams would make the post
season? Probably no more than
three, almost certainly no more than
four.
When's the last time a Cinde-rally
story has carried that much weight
going forward? Did Boise State's
victory over Oklahoma in the Fiesta
Bowl signal the end of the BCS? Will
the Giants win over the Patriots in
the Super Bowl mean an end to the
AFC dominance of the past decade?
Did the Red Sox's triumph in 2(X)4
mean the death of all talk of curses in
sports? Heck no, probably not, and
ask a Cubs fan.
But the Warriors? Their victory
put an exclamation point on the
most important trend in the NBA,
and they followed through next sea
son by picking up exactly where they
left off. They're 36-22 and on track to
be some highly seeded team's worst
nightmare in the playoffs.
As grim as things have been for
Bay Area sports, fans can at least still
take comfort in that. They've got at
least one team that is setting trends
and making the rest of the nation
take notice.
