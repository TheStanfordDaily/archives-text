# Believe in the Warriors

### 
There are times watching sports
when you can't help but think
you're witnessing a once in a
lifetime occurrence. The moments
you know you'll remember 10 years
from now, or quite possibly for the
rest of your life. Sometimes those mo
ments are a buzzer-beating shot or a
last-second touchdown. Other times
it's an entire game where the under
dog somehow beats the heavy fa
vorite, or even a season when a team
does more than you could have ever
expected.
The funny thing is that how often
these moments occur apparently has
very little to do with how good a team
actually is. For evidence there, look
no further than our recent Bay Area
sports history, where we've seen the
collapse in recent years of local teams
in just about every sport imaginable.
The 49ers, Raiders, Giants, Athletics,
Cardinal football team, and Golden
State Warriors are all either emerging
from, entering or in the midst of truly
trying times for their respective fan
bases.
And yet, there has been a multi
tude of moments, games and late sea
son-surges here in recent years that
we've all been privileged enough to
witness. Who will ever forget Stan
ford's win over USC this fall? How
many members of the Class of 2008
will forget the one year that they got
to see a Big Game win?
And yet, perhaps the most memo
rable local upset in recent years has
come on the hardwood off-campus,
as the Golden State Warriors were
the first eighth-seeded team to defeat
a No. 1 seed in a seven-game playoff
series last year when they downed
Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Maver
icks in six.
