### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a dramatic day filled with hopes and
nerves, the Stanford men's golf team took third
place with a team score of 890 in the Ashworth
Collegiate Invitational in Westlake Village,
Calif. The Cardinal fell by only five strokes to
tournament champion No. 8 Southern Califor
nia; it was only one stroke behind second place
No. 10 Tennessee.

"We really had a chance to win," said head
coach Conrad Ray. "The tournament was decid
ed by the nine holes, hut we just did OK coming
down the stretch. We had a few bogeys and it was
tough, but all in all it was a good tournament for
us. |Junior] Dodge [Kemmerj and [freshman] Si
hwan [Kim] had a good week and USC had a
top-notch performance, so hats off to them."
