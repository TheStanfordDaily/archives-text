Collegiate Invitational in Westlake Village,
Calif. The Cardinal fell by only five strokes to
tournament champion No. 8 Southern Califor
nia; it was only one stroke behind second place
No. 10 Tennessee.

"We really had a chance to win," said head
coach Conrad Ray. "The tournament was decid
ed by the nine holes, hut we just did OK coming
down the stretch. We had a few bogeys and it was
tough, but all in all it was a good tournament for
us. |Junior] Dodge [Kemmerj and [freshman] Si
hwan [Kim] had a good week and USC had a
top-notch performance, so hats off to them."

finish in a tie for 20th. Grube posted
a six-over-par 77 and a five-over-par
76 on Monday. He posted six bogeys
and four birdies in the final round for
a two-over 73, and a total of 226 for
the tournament.

Due to windy conditions, many
teams had trouble controlling the
ball, contributing to a high scoring
trend in the first round. Stanford
checked in at second place with a 21-
over 305 after the first half of the day,
trailing Southern California by 21
strokes. Weather conditions calmed
for the second round but the Cardi
nal dropped to fourth overall, scor
ing a 13-over 297. The first two
rounds of the tournament on Mon
day exhibited fairly mild competi
tion. USC adhered to expectations
by managing a strong performance
to put the Trojans 11 strokes ahead of
the Cardinal going into yesterday's
final round.
Little did the Trojans know that
both Stanford and Tennessee would
give them a run for their money in
the final round. Southern California
came in with a 10-over 294 for the
day while the Cardinal posted a four
over score of 288.Tennessee checked
in with a one-over 285 to squeak by
Stanford in the closing moments of
tournament.
"The second day presented better
weather conditions, which made the
course more available for scoring,"
coach Ray said. "It was great to see
the whole team scoring well in the
final round.This is the type ot course
where if you hit it well, you can get a
good score. You just have to hit the
right spots."
The Cardinal was led by Kim and
Kemmer. Kemmer finished in third
place for the tournament, while Kim
tied for fourth.The final holes of the
tournament were filled with high
pressure and excitement as both
Kim and Kemmer concluded the
final round at a seven-over-par 220,
only two strokes behind the individ
ual tournament winner, Tim Sluiter
of USC.
Kim had a tough first round, post
ing a seven-over 78 but improved in
the second round with a two-under
69. He concluded the tournament
with a two-over score of 73, for a
total of 220 for the tournament.
Kemmer began the tournament
strong with a one-over 71 but lost his
groove in the second round, posting
a seven-over 78. He gained momen
tum in the third round, compiling
four birdies in the last 11 holes to fin
ish with a one-under score of 70, for
a total of 219.
