## S.F. mayor talks policy successes Newsom makes tie between business and polities 
### PRACHI PRIYAM 
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom
spoke in Bishop Auditorium yesterday at
an event hosted by the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) Government and
Politics Club.
Newson focused on the relationship
between graduate students' business
interests and politics. He also spoke
about San Francisco's success since he
became mayor in 2(X)4 and how he was
able to achieve success in the public sec
tor through his experience in the private
business sector.
Newsom. who said he is known as
"the gay marriage mayor," spoke the
same day the California Supreme Court
heard San Francisco's case for allowing
same-sex marriage within the city — a
policy pursued by Newsom during his
time in office.
When attending the 2(X)4 State of the
Union address soon after becoming
mayor, Newsom said he was "disgusted"
by the general attitude of audience
members toward the Lesbian Gay
Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) commu
nity Newsom was surprised to find that
Democrats and Republicans alike "pub
licly condemned" his actions.
As part of a question and answer ses
sion with audience members, Newsom
was asked about the effect of his revolu
tionary policies on his personal life.
"To this day, there are politicians,
both Republicans and Democrats, who
want nothing to do with me," Newsom
said. "I have family members who are
still outraged with me."
Newsom credited his other policy
successes to his accomplishments in the
private sector. He said the most impor
tant application of the business mind to
politics is taking risks, and described the
political scene as "risk-averse," partly
because constituents are not willing to
let politicians make mistakes.
"Let [politicians] try something and
watch it fail," Newsom advised. "At least
give them the opportunity to learn from
their mistakes."
He warned that change is not some
thing easily accepted in politics, which he
described as "prescriptive and simple."
He also said that politicians need to
"stop talking about [change] and get
things done."
Newsom described how he was able
to implement universal healthcare with-

in San Francisco through federal
grants, which politicians often ignore
among budget deficits.
For example, San Francisco has
put more money into rebuilding
public housing than has been allo
cated for the entire United States by
the federal government. According
to Newsom, the city will need about
one billion dollars to complete its
rebuilding projects while the entire
United States budget for rebuilding
public housing is only 95 million

dollars.
In terms of leadership, Newsom
advocated being passionate about
one's interests and then finding an
appropriate vessel for earning out
those interests. In an interview with
The Daily, Newsom called this
process an "artistic expression" that
results in "bliss."
Audience members, who were pri
marily GSB students, found
Newsom s talk inspiring. Frederick
Antwi MBA '08 said the speech
allowed him to get "a keener sense of
[Newsom's] authenticity and convic
tion."
Marc Stad MBA "08. who organ
ized the event, invited the mayor
because he thought Newsom "would

be good for the school because he
could talk about the cross-section
between business and politics."
"I think he was a big hit among
the students," Stad added.
Newsom also told The Daily that
he enjoyed coming to Stanford
because he has a "great admiration
for what Stanford represents not just
to the region but to the world."
His advice for the Stanford com
munity echoed his advice for GSB
students when he said that students
should "take risks and learn from
them, and that should be a lifelong
pursuit."
