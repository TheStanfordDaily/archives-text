### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling entered the Pacific-10 Champi
onships with high hopes, in search of their first Confer
ence title in team history. And while a rocky finish to the
first day of competition on Sunday precluded the Cardi
nal from achieving that goal, third-year head coach Kerry
McCoy's squad nevertheless rallied back and came as
close as they possibly could, coming in second in the pro
gram's best finish ever.
The tournament opened with a strong initial showing

NOTES: The Stanford wrestling team made history this weekend, finish
ing second at the Bac-10 championships for the highest finish in pro
gram history. The Cardinal was led by senior Tanner Gardner, who
was the champion of the 125-pound class. Gardner improved his
record to 38-1 on the season. Senior Josh Zupancic and junior Luke
Feist also did well, both finishing third in their respective weight class
es. Stanford will send five athletes to the NCAA championships
March 20 in Saint Louis, again one of the highest totals in program
history.

place at the Pac-10 Championships and earn a crucial point for Stanford in the team race.
for the Cardinal, but by the end of the
first day's action, only No. 6 senior
Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds re
mained in the championship bracket
and Stanford sat a disappointing sixth
in the overall standings. It was do-or
die for the Cardinal on Sunday, and
the team knew it.
"The thing is, we've been trying to
build this team attitude for a long
time, and this weekend it all finally
came together, which is when it
should," McCoy said. "The guys
stepped up and supported each other.
"After the disappointments on
Sunday night it would have been real
ly easy for our guys to roll over and say.
'You know what, we're done. Our best
guys got beat. We'll just roll over and
go away,"' he continued. 'But we had a
team meeting, and 1 didn't really want
to blow it out of proportion, but I just
said. Hey. this is where we're at. we're
in sixth place, and that's it, bottom line,
I don't want to talk about it. Let's just
go out and do what we can do.' And it
was actually guys on the team.Tanner
in particular, who stepped up and said,
'No. we can do this."'
And so they did, as the Cardinal
romped through the final day of com
petition en route to its second place
team finish behind only Boise State, a
result that saw five individual Stan
ford wrestlers earn their way to the
NCAA Championships in St. Louis,
Mo. later this month.
The format of the Pac-10 tourna
ment is such that the top three finish
ers in a weight class are all guaranteed
spots in the national tournament,
with coaches selecting eight addition
al "wild card" winners to make the
trip. With all Stanford wrestlers but

Gardner out of the championship
bracket, then, the stakes were high as
Cardinal athletes needed to be per
fect on the day to assure themselves
of a chance at an NCAA bid.
No. 9 redshirt senior Josh Zupan
cic bounced back beautifully in the
consolation bracket at 157 pounds
after a disappointing loss on day one
to earn a third place conference finish
as did redshirt junior Luke Feist at
174 pounds. Redshirt freshman Lucas
Espericueta and sophomore Zach
Giesen, meanwhile, fell in their con
solation finals matches to finish
fourth at 149 and 184 pounds, respec
tively. but were each awarded wild
card spots, qualifying them for the
NCAA tournament.
Gardner, meanwhile, was perfect
in Eugene, winning his first two
matches by fall before rallying in the
finals to come out on top, 7-6, over
second-seeded Anthony Robles of
Arizona State. Gardner's record on
the year improved to an astounding
38-1, as the Berryton, Kans. native
also set new Stanford records for ca
reer victories (140) and pins in a sin
gle season (19) en route to his second
consecutive conference title â€” a feat
which no Stanford wrestler has
achieved in over two decades. If
Gardner can repeat as an All-Ameri
can at the national tournament for
the third consecutive year, he would
be the first Cardinal wrestler ever to
do so.
In calling Gardner the "poster
child" for the Stanford program going
forward, however, McCoy was also
quick to point out the total team ef
fort that was required for Stanford to
earn its highest finish in program his
tory'. Even wrestlers who didn't quali
fy' for the NCAA field made big con
tributions to Stanford's overall score.

One such example was Kyle Bar
rett, a freshman at 165 pounds who
was forced into the starting lineup
after an injury' ended redshirt sopho
more Peter Miller's season. Despite
only wrestling in eight collegiate
matches prior to the tournament,
Barrett went 3-2 against the best of
the Pac-10 to finish fourth in the con
ference.
Despite the program record finish,
however, make no mistake, McCoy
and his team still recognize just how
far they have to go.
"It's kind of funny because I've
said this to our team but our goal was
to win the Pac-10," he said. "But if
you're not going to win, you can't do
better than finishing second. So it's
huge in that our guys stepped up and
performed at a high level. We had
some ups and downs, but the biggest
thing is that we continued to break
records and set new levels of excel
lence for this program."
For the five wrestlers making the
trip to the NCAA tournament,the ac
tion will begin on March 20 at the
Scottrade Center in St. Louis.
Also notable was the announce
ment that volunteer assistant coach
Matt Gentry's '05 will join the Cana
dian Olympic team competing in Bei
jing this summer. Gentry finished
third at the Pan Am Games in Col
orado Springs, Colo, on Sunday to se
cure the honor. The former Cardinal
standout is the only NCAA Champi
on in program history, winning the
title at 157 pounds in 2004; he secured
his chance to make a bid for an
Olympic medal on the same day his
career victories record at Stanford
was broken by Gardner.
