onships with high hopes, in search of their first Confer
ence title in team history. And while a rocky finish to the
first day of competition on Sunday precluded the Cardi
nal from achieving that goal, third-year head coach Kerry
McCoy's squad nevertheless rallied back and came as
close as they possibly could, coming in second in the pro
gram's best finish ever.

NOTES: The Stanford wrestling team made history this weekend, finish
ing second at the Bac-10 championships for the highest finish in pro
gram history. The Cardinal was led by senior Tanner Gardner, who
was the champion of the 125-pound class. Gardner improved his
record to 38-1 on the season. Senior Josh Zupancic and junior Luke
Feist also did well, both finishing third in their respective weight class
es. Stanford will send five athletes to the NCAA championships
March 20 in Saint Louis, again one of the highest totals in program
history.
