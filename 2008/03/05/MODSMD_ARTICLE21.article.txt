Tuesday was Ashley Chinn's day.
After having spent much of a very
successful first season in the shadow of
star pitcher junior Missy Penna, fresh
man Ashley Chinn broke out Tuesday,
overpowering Boston College hitters to
lead Stanford to a 5-1 victory in its first
game of a 16 game home-stand.
Chinn struck out a career high 11
batters while allowing just two hits and
one walk in the complete game win.
Sophomore centerfielder Alissa
Haber led the somewhat sluggish Stan
ford offense with two hits — including
a massive opposite field three-run
home run — two runs scored, and three
RBI.
But it was Chinn who stood out.
The freshman pitcher began the
game by striking out the first two bat
ters, and took a no-hitter into the fourth
inning.The Eagles only managed to get
on the board with two outs in the bot
tom of the seventh when Irene Dela
grammaticas doubled home pinch run
ner AllieThurnstrom following Chinn's
lone walk of the day.
