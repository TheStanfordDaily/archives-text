Tuesday was Ashley Chinn's day.
After having spent much of a very
successful first season in the shadow of
star pitcher junior Missy Penna, fresh
man Ashley Chinn broke out Tuesday,
overpowering Boston College hitters to
lead Stanford to a 5-1 victory in its first
game of a 16 game home-stand.
Chinn struck out a career high 11
batters while allowing just two hits and
one walk in the complete game win.
Sophomore centerfielder Alissa
Haber led the somewhat sluggish Stan
ford offense with two hits — including
a massive opposite field three-run
home run — two runs scored, and three
RBI.
But it was Chinn who stood out.
The freshman pitcher began the
game by striking out the first two bat
ters, and took a no-hitter into the fourth
inning.The Eagles only managed to get
on the board with two outs in the bot
tom of the seventh when Irene Dela
grammaticas doubled home pinch run
ner AllieThurnstrom following Chinn's
lone walk of the day.
Head coach John Rittman was
thrilled with the performance of his
young right hander.
"Ashley finally pitched the way
she is capable of pitching in a game
situation," Rittman said. "We've all
seen her throw like that in inter
squad games, but today was the first
time she has put it all together in a
real game."
Chinn moved to 7-0 on the sea
son with the victory, as the Cardinal

bounced back from a heart-break
ing loss Sunday to improve its im
pressive record to 21-2.
Chinn was happy to see it all come
together today
"I've been struggling a bit lately."
she said."Today I just went out there
with a confident, comfortable atti
tude, and pitched the best game I
have in while."
Stanford got on the board quick
ly in the first inning. After I laber sin
gled through the right side, senior
left fielder Tricia Aggabao bunted
safely for a base hit. When no one
covered third, Haber alertly scam
pered over to put runners on the
corners with nobody out. Junior

shortstop Maddy Coon then fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly to right
field, scoring Haher.
That was all the Cardinal would
manage that inning, as well as for the
next four, until finally figuring out
Eagle pitcher Allison Gage.
Holding a slim 1 -0 lead in the bot
tom of the sixth, sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill led the inning with her
team-leading ninth home run. With
one out, sophomore second base
man Shannon Koplitz singled. Se
nior pinch hitter Erin Howe then
slapped a single to left, setting the
stage for Haber.
The preseason Ail-American
took the first pitch she saw, a high
fastball, and drove it the opposite
way over the left field fence to put
the Cardinal up 5-0.
" Hie new pitcher threw harder,
so I just figured I'd go up there and
swing at the first pitch and see what
happened," Haber said.
What happened was her fifth
home run of the year.
Rittman has been extraordinarily
pleased with the play of Haber and
Neill.
"Rosey and Alissa are a couple of
sophomores who have really ma
tured as hitters this year," Rittman
said. "Every game it has been a dif
ferent part of our lineup hitting, but
the two of them have been great all
year."
The two sophomores are the
team's two leading hitters, as Neill is
hitting .409 with nine home runs and
26 RBI, while Haber is hitting .365
with five home runs and 14 RBI
from the leadoff spot.
Despite her own play, Haber felt
that the most important thing that
came from Tuesday's game was
Chinn's performance.
"Today was really promising,"
said Haber. "Missy can't do it all.
and come Pac-10 season we are
going to need two dominant pitch
ers. and Ashley showed she could be
one today."
C'hinn understands that even
when the Stanford offense is strug
gling like it did in the middle innings
Ibesday, it has the ability to explode
at any time.
"This team has great chemistry,
and I know as long as I keep the
team in the game, good things will
happen," Chinn said.
Hie Cardinal will need Chinn to
pitch well this weekend as the team
prepares for The Stanford Classic, a
four-day tournament in which it will
play six games.
The team opens in the tourna
ment tomorrow at 4 p.m. against
Campbell University at Smith Fami
lv Stadium.
