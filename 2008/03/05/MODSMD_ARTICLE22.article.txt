## Lopez named Player of the Week 
### 
Brook Lopez was named the Pac-10
Player of the Week Monday, after pour
ing in 46 points, 13 rebounds and eight
blocks in the Cardinal's sweep of Wash
ington and No. 22 Washington State this
past weekend.
Lopez posted a team-high 25 points
and six rebounds in a come-from-be
hind 60-53 victory over the Cougars (22-
7, 10-7 Pac-10) Saturday to keep Stan
ford's (24-4, 13-3) Pac-10 title hopes
alive. He made 11-of-16 shots in the con
test, scoring 19 of his points in the sec
ond half. Lopez added 21 points and
seven rebounds in Thursday's 82-79 vic
tory over Washington (16-14,7-10).
The honor is Stanford's first since
Lopez won the award in Jan. 2007, and
the second of the sophomore center's
career. It catapults the likely NBA lot
tery pick this June into elite territory,
with Washington's Jon Brockman
(three times), UCLA's Kevin Love
(three times), Cal's Ryan Anderson
(two times) and USC's OJ Mayo as the
other players who've won Player of the
Week honors this season.
Stanford visits No. 2/3 UCLA (26-3,
14-2) this Thursday at 8 p.m. The Bruins
can clinch the Pac-10 title outright with
a win. while a Stanford sweep of UCLA
and USC (18-10,9-7) Saturday will give
the Cardinal no worse than a share of its
first Pac-10 title since 2003-04.

and three home runs in leading her team
to four decisive wins last week.

15.500 in the parallel bars to win the
event, pushing Stanford ahead of the
Wolverines to close out the victory.
