### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
200 victories.
I lead coach Lele Forood of the No.
6 Stanford women's tennis team
reached this major milestone in wins
yesterday after the team's 5-2 victory
over No. 26 William & Mary.
With a career record of 200-8 for a
.%2 win percentage, Forood has set the
bar of excellence in her eight years as
head coach of the program.
"1 guess I'm happy about that,"
Forood said of her teat. " I look forward
to 2(X) more."
After a rough five-game road swing
up-and-down the West Coast, the Car
dinal found itself at home for the first
time since Valentine's Day.
Fortunately, Stanford was able to se
cure the victory for Forood in front of
the home crowd.
"It was a lot of fun to be back on our
courts," Forood said. "It was definitely
nice to play at home."
The victory also pushed Stanford's
home win streak to 98 straight dual
matches.
On the day, Stanford heeded Fonxxi's
guide to success and took the doubles
point early with wins at the No. 2 and
No. 3 spots. However.sophomore Lind
say Burdette was lost to injury and was
replaced by senior Celia Durkin at
court three.
In singles. Durkin and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh quickly won their
matches for a 3-0 lead and junior Jessica
Nguyen clinched the match with a 6-4,
6-2 victory over Katarina Zoricic at the
No. 2 spot.
With the match already won. fresh
man 1 lilary Barte put the icing on the
cake for her squad.
After losing the first set 6-1. Barte
came back from a 5-2 deficit in the third
set to take the match 2-6,6-1.7-5.
"A very gutsy win," Fonxxl said of
Barte's match. "She lost the first set
pretty handily and didn't play very well.

She found her game in that second set
and it was a great effort.
"She got more aggressive (in her
play and it wjls a really gtxxl effort for
her to fight back in the third set,"
Forood said.
After dominating at the top spot for
the entire road trip, William & Mary's
Megan Moulton-Levy appeared to
have found a chink in Barte's armor.
But Barte battled back to take her
fifth consecutive victory, all of which
have been against No. 1 players. Moul
ton-Levy is ranked 11th in the latest
ITA polls.
William & Mary secured its two wins
at the four and six positions in tiebreak
er wins over senior Whitney Deason
and freshman Jennifer Yen.
According to Forood, there is much
to be taken from the match.
"The positives were that in the
matches we won, we really problem
solved and turned them into wins,"
Forood said. "'The ones we lost, we have
to do a better job at doing that."
Fortunately, despite its weekend loss
to then-No. 11 UCLA, Stanford re
mained sixth in the last ITA polls.
I lowever. Southern California, Cali
fornia, and UCLA now precariously
linger behind the Cardinal in the rank
ings.
USC closely trails at seventh after
upsetting Cal and nearly defeating
Stanford over the weekend while Cali
fornia and UCLA fall in at eighth and
ninth, respectively.
This weekend, Stanford will face fellow
Pac-10 foes No. 63 Arizona and No. 13
Arizona State.
"They're both pretty solid teams,"
Forood said. "ASU has beaten UCI-A
and Arizona usually has some players
with different styles that present a chal
lenge as well."
With the next three matches at home,
the Cardinal will try to regain its cham
pionship form that has eluded it this
season.
"We're continuing to find the an
swer to get us to a point where we're
playing really consistently," Forood
said. "Hopefully we keep moving this
weekend in that direction."
