# McCain sweeps primaries to earn GOP nomination
## Clinton stops Obama's streak 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
regained some of the momentum she had lost
to Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in the pro
tracted fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination Tuesday night, Stanford support
ers from both camps offered positive out
looks on the evening's results and were opti
mistic about what the future holds.
Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain
clinched his party's nomination with sweep
ing victories in all four states that voted last
night — Ohio, Rhode Island. Texas and
Vermont — prompting his main challenger,
former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to
concede the GOP nomination. But the
Democratic picture is far murkier after last
night's results.

single primary or caucus.
Mishan Araujo '08, the Northern
California chair of Women for Hillary — a
branch of Clinton's national presidential
campaign — said that Clinton's wins in
Texas and Ohio were important in her con
tinued fight for the Democratic nomination.
There was intense speculation in the days
leading up to yesterday's vote that il Clinton
had lost either Texas or Ohio she might eon
cede the nomination to Obama.
"1 think it's a really good thing that she
won [yesterday]," Araujo said. "1 lad she not
won. it would have been a big blow to the
campaign because so much time and energy
was poured into Texas and Ohio."
While Clinton supporters were relieved
and excited with the New York Senator's
wins yesterday, Obama backers pointed to
