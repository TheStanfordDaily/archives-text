# McCain sweeps primaries to earn GOP nomination
## Clinton stops Obama's streak 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
regained some of the momentum she had lost
to Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in the pro
tracted fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination Tuesday night, Stanford support
ers from both camps offered positive out
looks on the evening's results and were opti
mistic about what the future holds.
Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain
clinched his party's nomination with sweep
ing victories in all four states that voted last
night — Ohio, Rhode Island. Texas and
Vermont — prompting his main challenger,
former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to
concede the GOP nomination. But the
Democratic picture is far murkier after last
night's results.
Obama handily won Vermont, but he lost
a close race to his rival in Texas and dropped
the contests in Rhode Island and. more
importantly, in Ohio by significant margins,
ceding much of the momentum he had
earned with wins in 11 straight contests
going into last night's primaries.
Despite wins in three of the four states
votinn yesterday, however. Clinton still trails

Obama in the delegate count because of the
complicated nature of the Democratic
Party's delegate allocation system.
What fhe wins mean
Clinton supporters on campus were
relieved that the New York senator was able
to post wins in Ohio and Texas after going
nearly a full month without a victory in a
single primary or caucus.
Mishan Araujo '08, the Northern
California chair of Women for Hillary — a
branch of Clinton's national presidential
campaign — said that Clinton's wins in
Texas and Ohio were important in her con
tinued fight for the Democratic nomination.
There was intense speculation in the days
leading up to yesterday's vote that il Clinton
had lost either Texas or Ohio she might eon
cede the nomination to Obama.
"1 think it's a really good thing that she
won [yesterday]," Araujo said. "1 lad she not
won. it would have been a big blow to the
campaign because so much time and energy
was poured into Texas and Ohio."
While Clinton supporters were relieved
and excited with the New York Senator's
wins yesterday, Obama backers pointed to
the Illinois Senator's still commanding dele-

gate lead as evidence that he is still on track
to the nomination despite losses in yester
day's contests.
Debashish Bakshi '08, the Stanford chap
ter coordinator of Students for Barack
Obama, said he was disappointed with the
results but cautiously optimistic about the
future.

"Well I'm a little disappointed," he said.
"It seemed yesterday that the last polls com
ing in indicated that we would he disap
pointed in Ohio. For Texas, we knew it
would he close, and it is going to he close.
But really what it comes down to after the
dust settles tomorrow is the Obama
campaign maintaining a healthy
lead in delegates, and from what I
understand there is going to he
another batch of superdelegates
ready to endorse Obama."
Bakshi downplayed Clinton's
wins yesterday in light of what he
sees as Obama's insurmountable
delegate lead.
"[Winning yesterday] helped
Hillary a lot in terms of the media
narrative," he said, "but when it
comes down to the delegate arith
metic, 1 don't see how tonight really
helped Clinton."
The road ahead
As the two Democratic candi
dates march on to Wyoming, which
votes Saturday, and Mississippi,
which votes next lliesday. they are
undoubtedly looking forward to the
next — and final — big battle
ground state: Pennsylvania, which
will not vote until Apr. 22.
Araujo stressed the importance
of establishing a strong network of
on-the-ground organizers as early
as possible.
"I think the campaign needs to
get into Mississippi and
Pennsylvania early to establish
groundwork early," she said.
"Hillary fails when she doesn't have
a strong presence in a state, so the
most important thing for her is hav
ing field operations in those states
coming up."
Bakshi said that while a drawn
out primary contest helps the
Democratic Party build infrastruc
ture in key swing states like Ohio
and Pennsylvania, it is on the whole
bad for the Party. As a result, Bakshi
said, he believes Clinton will feel an
increasing amount of pressure from
senior Democratic officials to with
draw from the race before voters in
Pennsylvania cast their ballots six
weeks from now.
"I think continuation from this

point forward really detracts from
the ultimate goal of beating John
McCain and taking back the White
House in November," he said. "1
think party leaders like [Speaker of
"When it comes down
to the delegate
arithmetic, I don't see

the House] Nancy Pelosi [D-Calif.]
and others will see that and will
urge Clinton to back out. I person
ally don't think Hillary Clinton will
go into Pennsylvania as a candidate
for the nomination."
What role will superdelegates
play?
Despite Bakshi's prediction that
Clinton may drop out of the race
before the Pennsylvania primary,
with her wins yesterday in Texas
and Ohio, the New York senator
appears poised to contest the nomi
nation all the way to the
Democratic convention in late
August.
It appears increasingly likely
that neither Clinton nor Obama
will earn the 2,025 delegates need
ed to clinch the nomination by the
convention and that the so-called
superdelegates — Democratic
members of Congress and Party
officials who are free to vote as
they want — will ultimately decide
the nominee.

Araujo argued that the
Democratic National Committee
(DNC) would have no choice but to
seat at the convention delegates
from Michigan and Florida — two
states which moved their primaries
up in the calendar against Party
rules and were subsequently
stripped of their delegates as pun
ishment. Clinton won both states by
wide margins and has argued that
their delegates should be seated.
"1 think [a brokered convention]
is going to be really hard for the
Party to take in many ways,"
Araujo said. "1 think the role of
superdelegates is really difficult to
translate to the average
Democratic Party member. I worry
a little bit about that. I think there's
going to be a lot of pressure on
DNC members to allow Florida
and Michigan to seat their dele
gates at the convention."
Bakshi, though, said that
Obama's lead in pledged delegates
— which he is expected to maintain
all the way into August — would be
impossible for superdelegates to
ignore.
"Given our pledged delegate
lead and overall delegate lead and
money raised in February ... given
all these factors it's going to come
down to what superdelegates are
persuaded by." he said. "I think it
would be difficult for superdele
gates to go for a candidate that did
n't have more pledged delegates."
Bakshi called for the New York
senator to withdraw from the race
in an effort to promote Democratic
Party unity entering the general
election in November.
"While Clinton can continue
this, 1 don't think it's in the best
interest of the Party for her to do
so," he said."l'll be interested to see
what happens."

Bakshi said that while a drawn

and Pennsylvania, it is on the whole
bad for the Party. As a result, Bakshi
said, he believes Clinton will feel an
increasing amount of pressure from
senior Democratic officials to with
draw from the race before voters in
Pennsylvania cast their ballots six
weeks from now.

the ultimate goal of beating John

the House] Nancy Pelosi [D-Calif.]
and others will see that and will
urge Clinton to back out. I person
ally don't think Hillary Clinton will
go into Pennsylvania as a candidate
for the nomination."
What role will superdelegates
play?
Despite Bakshi's prediction that
Clinton may drop out of the race
before the Pennsylvania primary,
with her wins yesterday in Texas
and Ohio, the New York senator
appears poised to contest the nomi
nation all the way to the
Democratic convention in late
August.
It appears increasingly likely
that neither Clinton nor Obama
will earn the 2,025 delegates need
ed to clinch the nomination by the
convention and that the so-called
superdelegates — Democratic
members of Congress and Party
officials who are free to vote as
they want — will ultimately decide
the nominee.

Araujo argued that the
Democratic National Committee
(DNC) would have no choice but to
seat at the convention delegates
from Michigan and Florida — two
states which moved their primaries
up in the calendar against Party
rules and were subsequently
stripped of their delegates as pun
ishment. Clinton won both states by
wide margins and has argued that
their delegates should be seated.
"1 think [a brokered convention]
is going to be really hard for the
Party to take in many ways,"
Araujo said. "1 think the role of
superdelegates is really difficult to
translate to the average
Democratic Party member. I worry
a little bit about that. I think there's
going to be a lot of pressure on
DNC members to allow Florida
and Michigan to seat their dele
gates at the convention."
Bakshi, though, said that
Obama's lead in pledged delegates
— which he is expected to maintain
all the way into August — would be
impossible for superdelegates to
ignore.
"Given our pledged delegate
lead and overall delegate lead and
money raised in February ... given
all these factors it's going to come
down to what superdelegates are
persuaded by." he said. "I think it
would be difficult for superdele
gates to go for a candidate that did
n't have more pledged delegates."
Bakshi called for the New York
senator to withdraw from the race
in an effort to promote Democratic
Party unity entering the general
election in November.
"While Clinton can continue
this, 1 don't think it's in the best
interest of the Party for her to do
so," he said."l'll be interested to see
what happens."

As Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
regained some of the momentum she had lost
to Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in the pro
tracted fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination Tuesday night, Stanford support
ers from both camps offered positive out
looks on the evening's results and were opti
mistic about what the future holds.
Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain
clinched his party's nomination with sweep
ing victories in all four states that voted last
night — Ohio, Rhode Island. Texas and
Vermont — prompting his main challenger,
former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to
concede the GOP nomination. But the
Democratic picture is far murkier after last
night's results.
Obama handily won Vermont, but he lost
a close race to his rival in Texas and dropped
the contests in Rhode Island and. more
importantly, in Ohio by significant margins,
ceding much of the momentum he had
earned with wins in 11 straight contests
going into last night's primaries.
Despite wins in three of the four states
votinn yesterday, however. Clinton still trails

Obama in the delegate count because of the
complicated nature of the Democratic
Party's delegate allocation system.
What fhe wins mean
Clinton supporters on campus were
relieved that the New York senator was able
to post wins in Ohio and Texas after going
nearly a full month without a victory in a
single primary or caucus.
Mishan Araujo '08, the Northern
California chair of Women for Hillary — a
branch of Clinton's national presidential
campaign — said that Clinton's wins in
Texas and Ohio were important in her con
tinued fight for the Democratic nomination.
There was intense speculation in the days
leading up to yesterday's vote that il Clinton
had lost either Texas or Ohio she might eon
cede the nomination to Obama.
"1 think it's a really good thing that she
won [yesterday]," Araujo said. "1 lad she not
won. it would have been a big blow to the
campaign because so much time and energy
was poured into Texas and Ohio."
While Clinton supporters were relieved
and excited with the New York Senator's
wins yesterday, Obama backers pointed to
the Illinois Senator's still commanding dele-

Debashish Bakshi '08, the Stanford chap
ter coordinator of Students for Barack
Obama, said he was disappointed with the
results but cautiously optimistic about the
future.

"Well I'm a little disappointed," he said.
"It seemed yesterday that the last polls com
ing in indicated that we would he disap
pointed in Ohio. For Texas, we knew it
would he close, and it is going to he close.
But really what it comes down to after the
dust settles tomorrow is the Obama
campaign maintaining a healthy
lead in delegates, and from what I
understand there is going to he
another batch of superdelegates
ready to endorse Obama."
Bakshi downplayed Clinton's
wins yesterday in light of what he
sees as Obama's insurmountable
delegate lead.
"[Winning yesterday] helped
Hillary a lot in terms of the media
narrative," he said, "but when it
comes down to the delegate arith
metic, 1 don't see how tonight really
helped Clinton."
The road ahead
As the two Democratic candi
dates march on to Wyoming, which
votes Saturday, and Mississippi,
which votes next lliesday. they are
undoubtedly looking forward to the
next — and final — big battle
ground state: Pennsylvania, which
will not vote until Apr. 22.
Araujo stressed the importance
of establishing a strong network of
on-the-ground organizers as early
as possible.
"I think the campaign needs to
get into Mississippi and
Pennsylvania early to establish
groundwork early," she said.
"Hillary fails when she doesn't have
a strong presence in a state, so the
most important thing for her is hav
ing field operations in those states
