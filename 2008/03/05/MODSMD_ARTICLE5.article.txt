## Candidates in favor of ROTC on campus Presidential hopefuls pledge support for Solomon Amendment 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Nearly forty years after the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) left the Stanford campus
at the height of the anti-war movement, the presi
dential election has brought the debate over
ROTC programs and on-campus military recruit
ing back into the national spotlight.
All three major presidential candidates have
expressed their support for the Solomon
Amendment, which allows the government to
withhold funding from universities that do not
allow military recruiters or ROTC programs on

on Jan. 15. presidential candidates Barack Obama
(D-Ill.) and Hillary Clinton (l)-N.Y.) both said that
they would enforce the Solomon Amendment if

how disproportionately they are carrying the load
in this war in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan," said
Obama at the debate. "And it is not fair."
In 2003, Stanford Law School joined a suit chal

Amendment. Hie plaintiffs in the case argued that
colleges should not be required to assist military

tell" policy, which prohibits gays from serving
openly, is discriminatory.
"Our objection was not to military recruitment
on campus, only to the military discrimination pol

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor
of the government, thereby making the military the
only employer that does not have to pass
Stanford's anti-discrimination policy to recruit on
campus.
Republican presidential nominee John McCain
(R-Ariz.) has spoken adamantly in support of the
Solomon Amendment and the presence of ROTC
units on college campuses. When Columbia
University hosted Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad in September 2007. McCain criti
cized the school for inviting a suspected terrorist
but preventing ROTC to return to campus.
