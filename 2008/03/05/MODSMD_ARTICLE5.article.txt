## Candidates in favor of ROTC on campus Presidential hopefuls pledge support for Solomon Amendment 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Nearly forty years after the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) left the Stanford campus
at the height of the anti-war movement, the presi
dential election has brought the debate over
ROTC programs and on-campus military recruit
ing back into the national spotlight.
All three major presidential candidates have
expressed their support for the Solomon
Amendment, which allows the government to
withhold funding from universities that do not
allow military recruiters or ROTC programs on
campus. At the Democratic Debate in Las Vegas
on Jan. 15. presidential candidates Barack Obama
(D-Ill.) and Hillary Clinton (l)-N.Y.) both said that
they would enforce the Solomon Amendment if
elected.
"One of the striking things, as you travel around
the country, you go into rural communities and see
how disproportionately they are carrying the load
in this war in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan," said
Obama at the debate. "And it is not fair."
In 2003, Stanford Law School joined a suit chal
lenging the constitutionality of the Solomon
Amendment. Hie plaintiffs in the case argued that
colleges should not be required to assist military
recruiters because the military's "don't ask. don't
tell" policy, which prohibits gays from serving
openly, is discriminatory.
"Our objection was not to military recruitment
on campus, only to the military discrimination pol
icy." said Stanford Law Prof. George Fisher.
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor
of the government, thereby making the military the
only employer that does not have to pass
Stanford's anti-discrimination policy to recruit on
campus.
Republican presidential nominee John McCain
(R-Ariz.) has spoken adamantly in support of the
Solomon Amendment and the presence of ROTC
units on college campuses. When Columbia
University hosted Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad in September 2007. McCain criti
cized the school for inviting a suspected terrorist
but preventing ROTC to return to campus.
"It is unconscionable that Columbia, Harvard
and other great American universi
ties remain closed to ROTC. whose
graduates represent the bulk of the
officers commissioned into our
Armed Forces each year." said
McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam
War. in a speech at the Hudson
Institute on Sept. 27.2007.
In addition to Columbia and
Harvard, neither Yale nor Stanford
offer on-campus ROTC programs.
Since the Stanford faculty senate
stripped the ROTC program of its
University affiliations in 1969.
Stanford's ROTC students have had
no choice but to commute to nearby
universities to fulfill their ROTC
obligations. They drive to UC-
Berkeley, San Jose State or Santa
Clara University to participate in the
Navy, Air Force or Army programs,
respectively.
Jeff Wachtel. senior assistant to
President John Hennessy. said that
there is currently no plan to bring
ROTC back to campus. Any effort to
convince the military to bring the
program back to Stanford would first
need to gain faculty support and
then show enough student interest,
he said.
"It has to start will the faculty,"
Wachtel said. "New programs do not
move forward without the support of
the faculty."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
testified against the ROTC before
the faculty senate in 1969. He
opposed the program on the grounds
that it did not meet the University's
academic standards and its purpose

was to "train for the military in an
unjust and brutal war."
Greg Boden '09. a naval cadet
who trains at UC-Berkeley, believes
that it is unfair to deny academic
credit to ROTC students for the mil
itary courses they take. 'ITie nine
quarter units he earns each year
through the ROTC program would
earn him a minor in Naval Studies if
he attended UC-Berkeley. He said
that the naval courses may not be
especially difficult, but they prepare
him to be a future naval officer.
"I would challenge students here
to take navigation and see how they
do." said Boden. "My navigation
class is harder than an IHUM
course."
History Prof. David Kennedy,
who supports the return of ROTC to
Stanford, believes that Stanford and
other elite universities that do not
offer on-campus ROTC programs
are missing out on a valuable source
of leadership.
"The universities that consider
themselves the primary incubators of
leadership have cut themselves off
from a valuable resource." said
Kennedy.
Some Stanford ROTC students
are nonetheless skeptical about the
viability of a Stanford unit. Ally Ha
'09, an Army cadet who trains at
Santa Clara University, believes that
the Stanford ROTC program has not
returned because there is not a lot of
interest in it.
"Having an ROTC program on
campus would take a lot of energy."
she said. "And I 'm not sure whether
there would be enough interest to
keep the program going."
