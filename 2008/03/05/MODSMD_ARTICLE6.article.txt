Jerry Yang '90 and Akiko Yamazaki '90
saw their $50 million gift finally put into
use at the dedication ceremony yesterday
for the building created in their name. The
Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki
Environment and Energy Building, known
by its acronym Y2E2, is the result of an
eight-year effort to create a multidiscipli
nary institution addressing environmental
sustainability and the effects of global cli
mate change.
'ITie ceremony — which was preceded
by a three-hour environmental symposium
in Memorial Auditorium — highlighted
the significance of the building in climate
change research and commemorated those
who made its construction possible.

Speaking at the event were Chair of the
Board of Trustees Burt McMurtry MS *5 l ).
President John Hennessy, Dean of the
School of Earth Sciences Pamela Matson,
Yahoo! Co-founder Jerry Yang and his
spouse Akiko Yamazaki.
As a center focused on environmental
sustainability. Y2H2's construction is aimed
at reducing its carbon footprint. The build
ing. located near Roble field, is projected
to use half of the energy used by similar
sized buildings.
All four speakers spoke extensively on
the revolutionary nature of the project,
both in the building's innovative design
and the groundbreaking nature of the
research that will be conducted at the cen
ter.
"Our efforts began with a core group of
environmental faculty, but eventually they

would grow to encompass all seven schools
at Stanford," Hennessy said. "[We had] a
broad range of engagement with people
focused on the issues of sustainability and
business in industry, questions of environ
mental education, and of course the funda
mental science that underlies any technol
ogy or [improves on] policies."
Yang and Yamazaki said they were
compelled to invest in the project due to
the scope and gravity of the environmental
problems it aims to address. Yamazaki
emphasized the importance of environ
mental research in creating a planet that
can support future generations.
"The complexity of today's global envi
ronmental questions requires that experts
from a variety of fields come together to

address different facets of the same
problem," Yamazaki said. "For our
children to be able to enjoy and
experience what we've been
blessed with, we cannot afford not
to do something today."
Matson enumerated the numer
ous groups of people involved in
the construction and development
of Y2E2. She remarked on the
importance of the building as a
meeting center for students, profes
sors and researchers across the
entire campus.
"As you walk around here, you
will see lots of meeting spaces, work
spaces and gathering places,"
Matson said. "We did that on pur
pose because we wanted this to be a
coming-together place not just for
the people who are actually in the
building, but for the whole universi
ty."
