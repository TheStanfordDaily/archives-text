Dorm lounge, ITiursday night.
A game of beer pong under way: the persistent
sound of a hollow plastic ping pong ball try ing in vain
to land inside the cup. Two long-lost friends catching
up on life, their chatter adding to the indistinct haze of
music playing in the background. Another student in
a corner working on an essay; the backspace key
speaking the loudest.
And then a moment of silence. Unwanted silence.
But silence that put that random medley of sounds
into a different light. In a unique way, these students
were creating a different genre of music. It was their
own Chicago Cell Block Tango: Pop — Six — Squish

— Uh-uh — Cicero — Lipschitz!
And Monday evening at the Toyon Eating Clubs
was the Pop — Six — Squish of Stanford's own face
of music, rising singer-songwriter Stephanie Milliard
'09.1 lilliard.a biomechanical engineering major from
Pay son, Ariz., officially released her first CD this
week. Called "Poker Face," it includes songs she com
posed and sang.
"1 would describe my music as indie rock with soul
ful vocals," Milliard said. "I was inspired by the music
and vocals of Jewel, Goo Goo Dolls, Fiona Apple and
Mariah Carey and would say that my music represents
a unique mix of all of theirs."
The audience was clearly impressed by Milliard's
talent, cheering her on through a small performance
at the CD release party. The concert also featured
duets with Milliard's friends Leia Lorica '09 and
Miguel Sugay '10, as well as guest performances by
Naomi Andebrhan '09. Winston Lofton '09. Isaac
Johnson '09. Girmay Zahilay '09 and the a capella
group Everyday People.
"That was incredible!" said Chris Baclig '09.
"Stephanie is a very talented and professional artist,
and the joy she gets when she sings and performs def
initely shone through tonight."

Lorica was excited for Milliard and looks up to her
talent as a musician.
"Steph's devotion to working on the CD the entire
summer as well as this year has been inspiring," Lori
ca said. "Her music is extremely relatable and she has
immense talent, and the whole reason for this party
was to give her music the level of exposure that it truly
deserves."
So what's the story behind Milliard's musical
prowess?
POP
Milliard's rendezvous with music began at an early
age, as her mom played the guitar and sang to her in
her native Filipino language of Tagalog. Milliard re
members listening to the radio by her bedside for
hours, and she gradually learned to recognize differ
ent song structures, gaining an ear for melodious
tunes.
SIX
As 1 lilliard's love for music grew, she started to re
alize music's expressive potential. A relatively shy stu
dent in high school, she was inspired by the musicians
she listened to: she began writing songs as a way to un

wind from an academically rigorous high school cur
riculum. Slowly, the POP and SIX built on each other
as she began developing her natural talent.
"During my junior year [of high school], 1 was in
spired by Michelle Branch and taught myself the gui
tar at age 16, just like she did." said Hilliard."Soon, I
started songwriting as a fun activity and allowed the
music 1 listened to to help me perfect my guitar chords
and complement the songs 1 wrote."
At first, Milliard — like many young musicians —
was afraid to let others hear her music. Once, during a
concert in high school, she surprised her friends and
family with "At the Edge," one of her first songs. The
audience loved it. Having received an overwhelming
ly positive reaction for a song she had written in only
10 minutes. Milliard discovered she had a true talent
for and love of writing and singing songs, of which she
has about 100 to date.
SQUISH
At Stanford, however, everyone is a class apart in
everything they pursue.
"As a freshman. I was nervous because there were few
independent singer-songwriters at my level, and there
didn't seem to be a large music scene for us at the
time," Hilliard said.
"I spent a lot of time watching bands and trying to
find other musicians until I got the opportunity to play
an hour long show at the CoHo. which 1 got through
one of my friends on the concert network." she contin
ued. "The audience seemed to really like it. which
opened a lot of doors for me. allowing me to get my
music out to Stanford and a lot of other bands."
Hilliard continued to explore the music scene,
opening for Chris Ayer. a local singer, and performing
for the CoHo series, which she still misses.
"The CoHo environment was great for singer
songwriters and musicians in general," she said.
"That's where I performed first, and I miss it because
the feel and comfort associated with it was perfect."
UH-UH
After being featured on two Stanford soundtracks,
opening for Indi-rock band Ted Leo and the Pharma
cists last year and performing at the Sophomore Tal
ent Show, Hilliard decided that it was about time she
had a CD to give people when they asked for her
music. So, with the help of her friend producer Jack
Conte '07, Hilliard produced her debut album. Poker
Face, which took six weeks over the summer to record
and an additional four months to fine-tune.
"The experience was great but challenging be
cause I liked to use intuition and music more than
technical terms.This didn't always work out in getting
my feelings across to my producer," she said. "I would
describe songs as 'angelic' or 'emphatic' which per
fectly described my tone and sentiment, but [Conte]

needed actual music terms to work
with."
"Also, a lot of people would often
tell me what they wanted my songs to
sound like, hut ultimately 1 had to use
own intuition to make my songs
sound like 1 wanted them to, and head
in that direction," she added.
CICERO
Her hard work seems to have paid
off, as Milliard 's CD release party saw
a good turnout and great apprecia
tion for her musical talent.
Priyata Mehra '09, friend and dor
mmate of Milliard, admires her music
and has seen her grow as a musician.
"Music has always driven Steph
and it has especially been an impor
tant part of her growth over her three

years at Stanford," Mehra said." 11 has
been great to see Steph grow as an
artist, from performing at the [for
mer] CoHo to working on her album,
and especially to see her love for
music come out as something tangi
ble in the form of her first CD."
Reflecting on the evening. Milliard
largely attributed her success to her
parents, who supported her through
out the production process.
"My mother manages my My-
Space account and my father helps
with the production and distribution
of the CD," she said. "Although 1 was
afraid to tell them of my musical in
terests as a freshman in high school,
they have been very supportive of my
endeavors once they found out."
Lipschitz!
Looking back on her years here,
Milliard notes a positive change in the
Farm's solo music scene.
"As my freshman year progressed,
a lot more performers began gaining

the courage to perform as Stanford
began to open the music scene to solo
acts rather than only bands," she said.
"Today I see that the campus widely
appreciates solo artists, especially
singer-songwriters, something 1 strug
gled with as a freshman."
Milliard believes that the trick is to
take advantage of every opportunity
that presents itself.
"Don't hold back with your
music," Milliard tells aspiring student
artists."Contact the Stanford Concert
Network, play shows at The Axe and
the Palm — even if it is just for half
hour — and invite your dorm to your
shows."
"People will definitely show you
their support when you play, not just
because you have the courage to per
form. but especially because you are
making music," she added. "And they
will love you."
