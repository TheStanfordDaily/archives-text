# Girls got game?
## A
						closer look at the role gender plays in video game culture 
### LAURA CHANG STAFF WRITER 
A recent study by the Stanford Medical
School might explain why those hoys down
the hall won't stop talking about Super
Smash Brothers. According to researchers,
gender differences in neural processes and
motivational states may clarify why males
are "more attracted to, and more likely to be
come 'hooked' on video games than fe
males."
Fumiko Hoeft, a researcher in the study.

has attributed males' fascination with video
games to their innate territoriality: a trait he
believes is more pronounced in men than in
women.
"You can, I am sure,easily imagine people
fighting over prime office space,bunk beds in
dorms and camps, etc. Territorial behavior is
maybe 'the' fundamental behavior in ani
mals/humans, and we all try to maximize
Darwinian (evolutionary) fitness," Hoeft
wrote in an email to The Daily.
But do Stanford gamers align with this
theory?

At first glance, it might seem so. In a re
cent Arroyo Super Smash Brothers Tourna
ment. 17 residents signed up, of which only
one participant was female.
The turnout made perfect sense to 'Tyler
Ketron '10. "Men are inherently more ag
gressive and competitive than women. Men
are pressured more to be the alpha male...lt's
leftover from mating, where the male has to
fight for the best woman."
Jane Huang '09, the tournament's coordi
nator, explained it as a difference of prefer
ence.
"They like different types of games," said
Huang. "Guys like first person games, like
shooter. Girls like puzzles, like Tetris. There's
actually a lot of market research showing
that a lot of women like to play flash games
or puzzle games — the kind of games you
might see on Shockwave.com."
Ricky Villarreal '09 agreed."! know more

men that like video games, but I know sever
al girls who have video game consoles, and
enjoy the sport of competition. Women find it
easier to play something more interactive or
intuitive, like the Wii, Guitar Hero or DDR,"
he said.
Some girls don't like video games at all.
"1 hate them — they make me dizzy," .

said Amara Humphry 09. "I don't know I
if most girls get dizzy when they play ]
video games, hut I know girls don't play
them as much as hoys do."
Inevitably, the argument invites an age
old question: Is this difference due to na
ture or nnrfiirp?

Hoeft and his fellow researchers pre- '
sumed it to be nature, and their experiment
was designed accordingly.
To monitor the neural activity associated
with territoriality, the team created a simple
computer game: Eleven men and 11 women
were connected to a functional magnetic res
onance imaging (fMRI) machine and in
structed only to "click on as many halls as
possible." If the player clicked a ball before
it reached a certain point, a wall in the J
game shifted to the right, granting the play- I
er more "territory." If they clicked too late, 1
the participants lost territory.

While both men and women were able to
decipher the game's mechanism, men ulti
mately accumulated a greater amount of
