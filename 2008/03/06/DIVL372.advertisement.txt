"America's immigration system is outdated, unsuited to the needs of our economy
and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish
hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses
willing workers, and invite chaos at our border." - President George Bush, State of the
Union Address, February 5, 2005
At American we agreed with the President's call for immigration reform,
so why has nothing been done for the last three years?
It's time to give a voice to the voiceless. Businesses are afraid to speak to the media
about immigration, frightened of reprisals by government agencies. But we cannot just
sit in the shadows and watch the government and politicians exploit and misrepresent
this matter to advance their own careers.
Over 12 million human beings have become integral to our society, economy and
culture here in the USA, yet they do so in legal purgatory. While no serious political
voice calls to send them back to their previous home countries, very few have the
courage to admit that the only realistic option is some form of legal integration,
coupled with a legitimate, forward-thinking immigration policy.
Migration and economic experts generally agree that the productivity and hard work
of immigrants improves makes goods more affordable and available to
US citizens, and creates more jobs for US workers. Immigrants not only increase the
wealth of the nation, they have contributed significantly to major scientific, medical
and industrial advancements, as well as to the arts. Many of them have become great
entrepreneurs too. _
At what point are we going to recognize that the status quo amounts to an apartheid
system? At what point will America stop living in a state of denial?
At American Apparel we support our workers. We support our community. We support
Los Angeles. We support the pride of America and the American Dream.
Enough is enough.
It's time to Legalize LA, and Legalize the USA. , |§? I '
