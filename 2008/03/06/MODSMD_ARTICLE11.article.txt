# STUDENT LIFE
## No gap year program for pre-frosh Administrators have no plans for Princeton counterpart 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Princeton University announced last month that
it was developing an overseas bridge-year program
to send up to one-tenth of its incoming freshman
class to do a year of public service work abroad after
they graduate from high school. The pre-collegiate
program would be tuition-free and would provide
financial aid to interested students.
John Bravman. vice provost for undergraduate
education, said no similar program is in the works at
Stanford and that he does not anticipate its forma
tion in the foreseeable future.
Although Stanford has a larger endowment than
Princeton, the New Jersey school has twice as large
an endowment per student, with $2.2 million per
capita. Bravman said a program like Princeton's
would be very costly since it is tuition-free and that
funding such a program within the next five years
would be difficult.
"1 don't think that type of program will happen
anytime soon," Bravman said. "I think we can use
our resources in better ways."
Many universities, including both Stanford and
Princeton, offer study abroad programs to students
already on campus. But Princeton's service program
is the first to offer an abroad oppor
tunity to students that have not yet
even stepped foot on school
grounds. Bravman said Princeton
may be taking a risk in providing
travel funds to students with whom
they have had limited interaction.
"If [Princeton] is paying for it, it's
very difficult not to take on some
legal liability," Bravman said. "There
are going to be students all over the
world which they will have responsi
bility for but haven't really met."
Stanford has, however, worked to
provide more international service
opportunities for current undergrad
uates.
The University is offering a simi
larly themed program, albeit on a
smaller scale, through the Haas
Center's new summer international
service program. The program will
offer current undergraduate stu
dents who have not had extensive
travel experience the opportunity to
spend three to four weeks abroad on
a public service project.
"One of the needs we saw was
growing student interest in interna
tional service," said Jon McConnell,
director for public service education
at the Haas Center.
The program is offering three
trips to Latin America this summer
with 10 to 12 students in each group,
according to the Haas Center's Web
site. Student participants will focus

on microfinance and human rights in
Bolivia, healthcare in Nicaragua and
environmental conservation and
community development in Mexico.
The tradition of deferring school
for a year dates to the 17th century,
when young British nobles traveled
around Europe on an educational
rite of passage called the Grand
Tour.
Although the itinerary and par
ticipants have changed, this bridge
year remains popular in the United
Kingdom, as well as Australia, the
Netherlands and Israel. American
college students have traditionally
foregone a bridge year after high
school, jumping straight into the rig
ors of collegiate life.
Although Stanford does not offer
a formal program, there is a small
contingent of students every year
that are accepted to Stanford and
choose to defer enrollment in order
to spend a year pursuing their pas
sions.
Approximately 30 to 40 students
each year are granted permission to
defer their admission for up to two
years, according to Shawn Abbott,
director of admission at Stanford.
Students defer their admission for a
variety of reasons, but military serv
ice, travel, service and work tend to
be most common in requests to the
Office of Admissions. Abbott said.
Quinn Slack il always knew he
wanted to postpone college for a
year to travel. So two weeks after
graduating from high school, Slack
left for China because "it was the
only place that I thought was cheap,
safe and fun."

Some of his favorite memories
from the six months he spent in
China were of going to Chinese
karaoke bars with his new Chinese
and Korean friends. After returning
to the United States, Slack worked
at a tech start-up in Menlo Park
from January until May.
"1 came out of the year knowing
exactly what 1 did and didn't like,
academically and occupationally,"
he said.
Unlike most students who decide
to use a bridge year to travel, Travis
Kiefer il decided to defer enroll
ment for a year in order to start a
business. His company was centered
around an online program he creat
ed while in high school that helped
streamline the scholarship applica
tion process.
When the company folded after
four months, Kiefer worked as a
sales associate at Office Max and
then as a Web developer at a mar
keting firm.
Kiefer said the failure was initial
ly very discouraging but that it
taught him valuable lessons in busi
ness and entrepreneurship. He feels
like he matured during his bridge
year and came to Stanford better
prepared than he would have if he
came directly from high school.
"Being self-reliant and resource
ful has been very valuable at
Stanford," Kiefer said. "Also, having
such a huge failure has made me
appreciate the opportunities avail
able here."
