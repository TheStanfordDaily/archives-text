## GSC sends GO Pass referendum to voters Voters to consider fee for Cal Train subsidy 
### TAYLOR BULEY 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted 11-2 last night to
approve a referendum that will ask
graduate students to vote tin whether
to restart Stanford's GO Pass pro
gram. Before expiring in January, the
program subsidized the CalTrain
passes for all trains between San
Francisco and San Jose.
Since its inception, the GO Pass
program has been primarily funded
by the Office of the Provost.
However, graduate students have
since been asked to pay a larger pro
portion of the total costs. The cur
rent referendum, which will appear
on the ASSU spring ballot and
would take effect starting in January
2009. would require graduate stu
dents to pay fees to fund the pro
gram entirely.
When the program was offered
to Stanford graduate students at no
cost in 2005, the University issued
approximately 2.000 passes, accord
ing to numbers from the Graduate
Student Transportation Board. In
2006, students were asked to pay
$60. with the GSC chipping in an
extra $15 per student, and the total
number of participants dropped to
around 880.
In 2007, students were asked to
pay an additional $99.50 to get a

pass, and the University issued
approximately 50() passes.
Rhyan Uy. one of the two GSC
members who voted against the ref
erendum. said it would not make
sense to ask all students to pay for a
program that relatively few use.
"The last time it was available,
you only had less than 7(H) people
who actually claimed it out of the
3,500 people who could claim it," Uy
said. "So given that very small per
centage, it doesn't make sense to me
to implement it for everyone."
Uy also cited concerns about
electoral procedure, saying that low
voter turnout among graduate stu
dents eould mean that the relatively
few students who use the program
could force all other graduate stu
dents to pay the bill.
"During election time, less than a
third of graduate students go out
and vote," he said. "So if you dumb
down the numbers, they need only
1,000 or so votes to get the referen
dum passed."
To mitigate the concerns going
forward, GSC Co-chair Kristina
Keating stressed the importance of
increasing voter turnout.
"We really need to just get out
and inform voters," Keating said
during the meeting. "As the student
government body, it's our responsi
bility."
For now. the GSC is only seeking
students to vote on the program.
