## Editorial Board The
						joy of a syllabus 
### 
The Stanford Syllabus site is an excel
lent hut underused resource for hoth
professors and students. Developed
hy Academic Computing with the support
of many Stanford administrative depart
ments. this online repository of course syl
labi has generated a fair amount of public
ity Unfortunately, not all professors post
their syllabi on the site.
The syllabus site helps professors and
instructors organize their classes more ef
fectively. Having syllabi online could
greatly reduce the amount of chaos that
goes on during the first week of class. Stu
dents are less likely to come into class, pick
up a copy of the syllabus and leave imme
diately. This is especially important for pro
fessors who need accurate estimates of en
rolment numbers — estimates that affect
decisions like whether to hire an extra
teaching assistant or schedule extra office
hours.
Reducing the amount of chaos during
the shopping period also benefits students.
Being able to view course syllabi online al
lows students to make well-informed choic
es at the start of the quarter. This reduces
overall anxiety,especially for freshmen still
unfamiliar with Stanford academics. This
new online resource is also important for
students who have to choose between two
or more classes scheduled at the same time,
especially if both classes are small-group
seminars with limited enrolment.
Professors should note that they are hy
no means obliged to post course materials
in their entirety. Syllabi posted on the site
do not have to be perfectly complete. But
even the most minimal amount of informa
tion posted on the site will help the shop
ping process run more smoothly
At the very least, syllabi should provide
students with a good sense of the workload
required for the class. As such, they should
give an idea of the amount of reading per
week, the number of problem sets, papers,
quizzes, midterms,exams and projects. Pro
fessors should also consider including their
grading policies in their syllabi.
Posting a syllabus ahead of time is a
good way of getting some boring adminis
trative details out of the way. Syllabi can
also be used to specify mundane details,
such as the frequency of meeting times and
whether there is an optional section or ad

ditional field trips.
With this online system, professors can
easily modify the syllabus at any point, as
more details get confirmed.
Moreover, they can remove any infor
mation they don't want students to access.
Post an old syllabus. Post a draft syllabus.
Anything is better than nothing. Even after
the quarter is over, it's not too late for pro
fessors to post their syllabi online for fu
ture reference.
Professors would benefit from having
students who are more focused and more
likely to have read the syllabus ahead of
time. Students would be better prepared to
ask questions about the course content, in
stead of asking annoying questions about
what books to buy or how many papers
they have to write.
Currently, the Stanford Syllabus site
may duplicate some of the functions avail
able on Coursework. It would be a good
idea to have this site integrated with
Coursework or Axess, although this is con
tingent on the sustained popularity of the
site.
Until then, it is important for professors
to post their syllabi in both places. Some
courses are not open to self-registration on
Coursework. which prevents students from
viewing the syllabus unless they are al
ready enrolled. Also, students are general
ly unable to access syllabi from previous
years on Coursework.
It is also important that no class be ex
empt from posting their syllabi online —
neither large introductory classes like
I HUM, Math 51, Econ 1A or the Biology
core, nor obscure classes offered by bou
tique departments.
We recognize the hidden potential in
this Web site and hope that it will develop
into a valuable repository of information
for future students. 'ITiis quarter, students
should ask their professors to post their
syllabi online and we would be especially
grateful if professors would be willing to
spend the weekend scouring their hard
drives for old syllabi.
