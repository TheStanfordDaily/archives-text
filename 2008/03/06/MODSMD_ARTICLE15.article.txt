According to the Stanford Of
fice of Student Activities
Web site, there are currently
580 registered student groups. In
case you didn't know, we have every
thing from "85 Broads, Stanford
Chapter," an international, business
focused women's empowerment
group, to the "World Peace Bud
dhists." Other student groups with
cool names include the "Rubik's
Cube Association of Stanford," and
the "Troposomatic Breakdance
Crew." Isn't college great?
Beyond these perennial classics,
new groups are created constantly
— two more groups were registered
since I started this column last week.

Over time, however, many of these
new organizations cave when leaders graduate, funding dries
up or motivation wanes.
I fere in the Silicon Valley, in the land of start-ups, we hear
all the time that most new businesses fail. It would seem the
same is true for student ventures. New groups, like business
es, face an uphill battle of getting organized, recruiting labor
and finding their niches in the market. And as students,
everyone has classes to worry' about, too.
But for the founders of Right to Education for All Chil
dren (REACH), a new group launched this quarter, their
motivation to succeed is deeply personal. International stu
dents Aleya Dhanji, Thomas Igeme and Rowza Rumma
were inspired to create REACH out of a common apprecia
tion of their own top-rate education.
As all three can attest,getting into Stanford as an interna
tional student is tough — Dhanji and Igeme are from Kenya,
and Rumma from Bangladesh — and is even more difficult
if you come from a country without an advanced education
system.
"We definitely were the privileged few who could afford
to dream big," Rumma said in a RE AO I presentation last
week."But most of our populations can't."
"To have so many people be illiterate," she added,"it's al
most like they're blind for the rest of their lives."
Though it is still in its developmental stages, REACH
hopes to promote literacy initiatives in developing countries,
starting with Kenya and Bangladesh, where the founders
have roots and connections.
When I sat down with Rumma this week to talk about
RE ACH. I asked her why the founders of RE AC TI felt it was
necessary to create a new group instead of working with an
existing organization with similar goals. Rumma already

works with the Muslim Students
Awareness Network as well as
Asha Stanford, a national group
that raises money for education in
India.
"We didn't want it to be a pe
ripheral focus of another student
group," she replied, noting that
Kenya and Bangladesh tend to re
ceive less attention from Stanford's
social activist community. In case
this sounds territorial, it is worth
noting that one of REACH'S first
official functions was a mixer
where other student groups and
local NGOs were invited to discuss
possibilities for collaboration.
Rumma said she and the other

members of REACH are fully
aware of the challenges of building a new organization and
then making it last."Our motivation comes from a very clean
and very simple idea of service," she said. "You get what you
work for, and we know we want to work for REACH to suc
ceed."
Asked whether REACH would be able to outlast its
founders given their personal connections to the two target
counties, Rumma remained unfazed. "[The founders] all
know we're going to graduate in two years, and we don't
mean for REACH to vanish." she said. "We began with these
countries because we have the most experience with them
and the most knowledge on them. If there's anyone who
wants to focus on a different country, they're welcome to join
us and lead that initiative."
In our environment of hyperconsciousness about resume
boosting, it is easy to be skeptical about new student groups.
But the sheer size of the OSA list serves as a good reminder
that every year some of the start-ups survive, and even flour
ish. Another promising new organization. Project Read, re
cently held a highly publicized spelling bee fundraiser to sup
port school libraries in India.Though the official attendance
wasn't reported.The Daily described the audience as a "sea
of people."
Rumma hopes REACH will also be able to help give oth
ers the chance for a better education. "Even though we begin
our droplets small." she said,"these tiny droplets will form an
ocean some day."

Michael is in no way affiliated with hut is rooting for REACH,
and Project Read. He'd also like to know when the Troposomat
ic Breakdance Crew is performing. Let him know at wilker
