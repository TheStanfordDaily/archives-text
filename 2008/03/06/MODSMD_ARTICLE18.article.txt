## Judging juries 
### 
The framers of the Consti
tution considered jury tri
als the last bulwark of a
free people. Thomas Jefferson
called the jury trial "the only an
chor yet imagined by man by
which a government can be held
to the principles of its constitu
tion." If "the consent of the gov
erned" is the name, jury trials are

the game. Citizens judge the facts and interpret the law,
not the government.
But who exactly are your peers?
In the Jim Crow South, the "peers" serving on juries
were all white. Today, in capital cases, none of your
"peers" have an objection to the death penalty, though
once you step out of the court room, about one in three is
morally opposed. Of the one-in-four citizens who are not
registered to vote — the rough percentage of unregis
tered voters in most states — almost none will be exclud
ed from the juries of "peers" that judge you.
Every complexity that is added to the jury selection
process is an arrogation by the government of power that
belongs to the citizens. If the government picks the jurors,
the government picks the verdict; if the government picks
the verdict, we are no longer a free people.
Process as punishment
Although formally you are innocent until proven
guilty, it may not feel like you have due process rights
when you get a parking ticket. In fact you do — the sys
tem just makes it difficult to exercise those rights and
easy to waive your rights and accept a guilty verdict even
if you believe it is unfair.
The presumption of innocence is too important to sac
rifice in favor of better parking enforcement. The judicial
system should not be designed to steer people toward re
luctant compliance with the diktats of the state bureau
cracy. but instead to offer citizens a chance to state their
case and be judged by their peers. If our leaders put their
mind to it, surely they could design a process that would
make it as easy to plead innocent as to plead guilty.
More laws than we can enforce
Most people who violate speed limit laws are not
caught and punished. Laws like this, those that appear on
the books but are widely disregarded, are dangerous be
cause they lend themselves to selective enforcement. A
police officer may only pull over minorities, people driv
ing cheap cars or people that "look suspicious." A law

that everyone breaks makes
everyone a lawbreaker; when
everyone is a lawbreaker, our right
to privacy and the presumption of
innocence is at risk.
I am in favor of limit
laws. But, let's set the speed limit
to a level we would be comfort
able actually enforcing, and then
develop a system to give every

speeder a ticket. Laws that are not followed, not enforced
by the government and not respected by the public hard
ly deserve the name of "law."
Jury nullification
In the common law tradition the United States inher
ited from Britain, juries are empowered to judge not just
the facts, but also the law. In most cases, judges instruct
juries on which facts must be established in order to
prove the charges under consideration. Several hundred
years ago. juries were instructed to return a verdict of
"proven," that the facts had been established beyond a
reasonable doubt, or "not proven," that they hadn't
been. The verdict "not guilty" was an innovation by ju
ries themselves, used to state that, irrespective of the
tacts, the person should not be convicted. Before the
Civil War, juries often declined to convict Northerners
who did not return fugitive slaves to the South. During
Prohibition, juries consistently nullified alcohol control
laws.
Today, with a record prison population,drug laws that
tear our communities apart and politicians who promise
longer prison sentences, every citizen should understand
their right to interpret the law, and should understand
how it applies to them.
Updating jury service
Ihe solution to problems with the jury system is more
justice for citizens, not less. When juries are biased, as
often happened in the pre-Civil Rights South, the solu
tion should be to balance the make-up of juries, not re
duce their power. The government should develop laws
that the people believe in and then let the people enforce
them. If the government cannot enforce laws with juries,
those laws shouldn't exist.
Ilie jury is the final protection of a free society against
an overweening government — your liberties are pro
tected by the judgments of the people, not the inclina
tions of the rulers.
