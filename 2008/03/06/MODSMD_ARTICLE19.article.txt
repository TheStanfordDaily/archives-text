## OFF-CAMPUS Cardinal No. 7 in new rankings 
### JIM O'CONNELL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
North Carolina was back at No. 1 again Monday,
thanks to a memorable few days in the state of Ten
nessee.Tennessee started last week at No. 1 in The Asso
ciated Press' college basketball poll after defeating pre
viously top-ranked Memphis. But the Vols then lost to
Vanderbilt on Tuesday.
Up stepped North Carolina, which ran its record to
27-2 with a win over Boston College and returned to the
top spot it held for the first 10 weeks of the season.
Memphis (28-1), which held the top spot for five
weeks,stayed at No. 2. UCLA (26-3) moved up one spot
to third while Tennessee (26-3) three spots dropped to
No. 4.
North Carolina, which rallied from 18 points down to
beat BC 90-80 in its only game last week, received 38
first-place votes and 1,745 points from the 72-member
national media panel.
Memphis, which bounced back from its only loss with
wins over Tulsa and Southern Mississippi last week, had
21 first-place votes and 1,706 points.
UCLA, which swept Arizona and Arizona State on
the road last week, was No. 1 on 12 ballots while Ten
nessee, which beat Kentucky 63-60 on Sunday, had one
first-place vote.
Davidson (23-6) was 25th in the poll, the Wildcats'
first appearance since the final poll of the 1969-70 sea
son.
Many teams return to No. 1 in the same season but
North Carolina did it for the most part without starting
point guard'iy Lawson.The sophomore sprained his left
ankle early in a win over Florida State on Feb. 3. He
missed six games - including the loss to Duke - and re
turned against Boston College on Saturday, playing 21
minutes.
"We have gotten better defensively and have had to
withstand some adversity," Tar Heels coach Roy
Williams said Monday. "We had a player who went
through four years of adversity step up at the point in
Quentin Thomas. We've had a nice little run here with
defense and toughness. What I'm most proud of is they
always did the best they could for 40 minutes, 50 in one
case.
"If we can get Ty back completely healthy, our team
is stronger because guys who were forced in because of
the injuries have stepped up. I'm proud of the toughness
of our team."
Thomas, a senior who has battled injuries his whole
career, took over many of Lawson's
minutes, but it was junior forward
Tyler Hansbrough, who leads the At
lantic Coast Conference in scoring
and rebounding, who remained the
key to the Tar Heels returning to No.
1.
"I like it better later in the year,"
Williams said of the top ranking,"be
cause it shows you have accom
plished something."
Kansas, Duke and Xavier all
moved up one spot to sixth through
eighth. Texas, which had an eight
game winning snapped at Texas Tech
on Saturday, dropped four places to

ninth. Wisconsin remained No. 10.
Georgetown started a three-team
run by the Big East at No. 11 and was
followed by Louisville, Connecticut,
Butler, Purdue. Vanderbilt. Michigan
State, Indiana, Notre Dame and
Drake.
The last five ranked teams were
Marquette, Gonzaga, Washington
State and newcomers Clemson and
Davidson.
Clemson (21-7) returned after
being out of the poll for six weeks.
The Tigers, who have won six of eight
including Sunday's last-second win
at Maryland, were ranked for nine
weeks earlier in the season, reaching
as high as 15th.
Davidson (23-6) entered the
rankings on a 19-game winning
streak and having gone 20-0 in the
Southern Conference. The Wildcats'

losses included ones to North Caroli
na, Duke and UCLA, none worse
than 12 points and all competitive
games.
"People are aware of the chal
lenging early schedule hut we also
have a sense that we dropped off the
face of the Earth and people did not
pay too much heed to us as they did
in November and December,"
Davidson coach Bob McKillop said.
" But 20-0 in a conference schedule is
an extraordinary accomplishment
that gets people's attention."
Davidson was last ranked in the
final poll in 1969-70, ending a run of
two straight season in the Top 25. In
those 30 polls, the Wildcats, who
were coached by Lefty Driesell and
featured forward Mike Maloy, were
in the top ten 23 times and the top
five 13 times.
