# Sixth Man Shortage
## 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON 
Eighteen of the 28 people in line ninety min
utes before last Thursday's Washington
game were seniors.Two were freshman.
It's been that way the whole season.
"I feel like a lot of younger students love basket
ball but aren't into Stanford basketball," senior Tim
Caflisch said."When we were freshmen, we remem
bered 26-0. we remembered Josh Childress and
there were a lot of R As who had gone through it and
pumped us up But if I see someone playing at the
rec center and they're not at the games, that's unac
ceptable."
In an immediate sense, it will be the Sixth Man
section, and by extension the basketball squad, that
suffers when Caflisch and the dozens of diehard sen
ior fans graduate this June. But basketball's just the
tip of the iceberg.
The overall makeup of the student body is
changing, as plenty of then-seniors lamented in this
newspaper last year, and as plenty of recent alums
have been saying for the last five, ten years. Stan
ford's a little less party and a little more profession
al, a little less basketball, a little more biochem.a lit
tle more serious and a little less fun than it was just a
few short years ago.
The Graying Sixth Man
The graduation of its most devoted fans is bad
