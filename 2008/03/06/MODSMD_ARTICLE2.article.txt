# Sixth Man Shortage
## 
### BY DANIEL NOVINSON 
Eighteen of the 28 people in line ninety min
utes before last Thursday's Washington
game were seniors.Two were freshman.
It's been that way the whole season.
"I feel like a lot of younger students love basket
ball but aren't into Stanford basketball," senior Tim
Caflisch said."When we were freshmen, we remem
bered 26-0. we remembered Josh Childress and
there were a lot of R As who had gone through it and
pumped us up But if I see someone playing at the
rec center and they're not at the games, that's unac
ceptable."
In an immediate sense, it will be the Sixth Man
section, and by extension the basketball squad, that
suffers when Caflisch and the dozens of diehard sen
ior fans graduate this June. But basketball's just the
tip of the iceberg.
The overall makeup of the student body is
changing, as plenty of then-seniors lamented in this
newspaper last year, and as plenty of recent alums
have been saying for the last five, ten years. Stan
ford's a little less party and a little more profession
al, a little less basketball, a little more biochem.a lit
tle more serious and a little less fun than it was just a
few short years ago.
The Graying Sixth Man
The graduation of its most devoted fans is bad
news for a student section that's already slid from
among the best in the country to the Pac-10's sec
ond tier. Before you disagree, sit in the crowd at
Oregon or Washington. Or just show up to next
year's Arizona and UCLA games. Many students
i spoke with think that those hallowed front-row
bleachers will be a third empty,even for the biggest
of rivalries.
"It's going to suck next year." said Vikram Aru
milli "07, now an MS&H co-term. "It'll be like the
Dodgers â€” people will walk in for the third inning
and walk out in the seventh "
If Arumilli is wrong next year, check back the
season after that, if last Thursday's headcount was
any indication. Because the younger the class, the
fewer of its students who were in line when the
doors opened at 6 p.m.. an hour before tip-off.
The only group bigger than the seniors were the
alums and grad students, a sad reminder of what
this section once was. Ask an alum and he'll tell
you it was not long ago that people who showed up
an hour early would get turned away: the student
section was already full.
"Our fans don't deserve a good basketball
team," Caflisch said. "People just expect it and
don't support the team anymore."
A Student Body in Transition
But does the decline of Sixth Man show some
thing far more serious? Does it show that the stu
dent body is changing? Does it show that today's
Stanford students are too stressed, too busy or just
plain unable to pack a gymnasium for two hours of
good, old-fashioned fun?
I'm of two minds on this.
On the one hand, just because basketball has
served as my grade's water cooler doesn't mean
that younger grades can't bond over other activi
ties.
Far more freshmen went to football games this
year, now that the team has finally found its pulse.
They hang out at the Axe & Palm, which we never
had.and flock in their dorm groupings to the same
row parties that every class does.
Two years as a freshman R A have painfully re
minded me for quite some time that plenty of my
freshmen are cooler than I and many of my fellow
seniors are now. let alone three years ago. And I
don't want to become the world's youngest cur
mudgeon at the ripe old age of 21.
"I think it's pretty early to judge us versus the
senior class," said freshman Brett Buchalter.one of
the two freshmen outside Maples an hour and a
half before the game (not incidentally, the only
other one was dragged out by his senior older
brother). "I think every group, once they're sen
iors, feels it's not as cool now. It was the same in
high school."
Good for Buchalter, and good for the 20 other
freshmen who'll take offense to this piece. You're
not the problem. Now clone yourselves ten times
over, because you're becoming an endangered

species on the Farm.
"I feel like in Larkin my freshman year, we
were concerned with striking a balance between
academics and social life," said Darren Franich, a
2(X)7 alum who wrote columns in The Daily
lamenting the change in Stanford's culture. "Three
years later, the freshmen seemed less concerned
with the social part. 1 don't know if it's new rules on
alcohol or just that they admit more hyper-inten
sive type-A people each year because more peo
ple keep applying and there's less room for the
troublemakers."
Like Franich, many students are quick to blame
an administrative push against alcohol for making
our student body look less like a state school's and
more like MlT's by the year. For whatever reason,
the difference between the classes of 2010 and
2011 is vast.
"1 just feel like more freshmen last year came to
games,"sophomore Jessica Sellers said."l definite
ly feel this year they're not as' Whoo!' We're trying
with the Stanford TUrf game, but 1 just don't feel it."
When they write the epitaph for the Sixth Man
section, that will be the first line. Why camp out for
the Arizona game when there are IHUM papers
to proofread, labs looking for research assistants,
pre-med societies to join? And looking at their re
sumes and their grade-point averages, it's obvious
what these freshman have gained.
But what have they lost in return?
"It's something I look forward to all year, and
whenever we're together in other arenas we al
ways bring it up," said senior Carolyn Celio of
camping out with Caflisch and their friends since
their freshman year in Roble. "I was asked about
my time commitments at a Row manager inter
view. and they laughed out loud, but 1 said this was
one of my top priorities.
"It's the time I get to see this group. It's our
time."
What's indisputable is that, for better or worse.
Sixth Man won't be the same after this year. But
make no mistake: this campus has been changing
for some time.
