# CARD HOLDS COURT
## Squash defeats old-guard at their own game, finishes seventh 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the world of collegiate squash, the Stanford women's
team is still very much a figurative baby. The club was
founded just ten years ago in 1998, and was completely stu
dent-run until only three and a half years ago. On top of
that, the squad has only been recognized as a varsity team
for two years, and was the first-ever varsity squash team lo
cated west of the Mississippi River. However, the baby is
not taking baby steps — it's already running at full speed.
Stanford has taken the women's squash world, a world
traditionally dominated by small New England schools, by
storm recently, earning its first-ever top-10 ranking by fin
ishing this season ranked No. 7 in the country.
"It has been rewarding...to see the program go from the
last-ranked team to one that is challenging the top Ivy
[League] teams [in such a short time period]," said Stan
ford coach Mark Talbott.
Talbott, widely regarded as one of the greatest Ameri
can squash players ever, has been in charge of both the
men's and women's teams since Aug. 2004. when he was
named the squash program's director. I lis guidance, along
with an all-new squash facility in the Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation, has been instrumental in turning
the women's team into a national contender.
After a couple years of consistent improvement, the
Cardinal set a goal of cracking the top eight this year — a
pretty lofty objective, when you consider that the top-eight
teams in women's squash had remained the same for the
past 30 years. Nevertheless, the team scheduled a tough
regular season slate and finished with a record of 6-6. And
while a .500 record may not seem that impressive on the
surface, Stanford remained ranked in the top eight due to
the quality of its opponents. In fact, all of the team's victo
ries came against opponents that it had never previously
beaten, including Williams, Dartmouth and Bates.
Because the team ended the year in the top eight, it was

able to play in the I lowe Cup. the national championship
tournament for the sport. Stanford had never played in the
Howe Cup before, and the team's inexperience showed as
it was soundly beaten by No. I Penn and No. 5 I larvard in
the first two matches. 1 hnvever, Stanford still had one more
game to play: the seventh-place match against Brown.
The Card had lost a heartbreaking 5-4 match against
Brown just three weeks earlier.and was determined to end

its season on a winning note by taking revenge. As in the
previous meeting, the match remained close until the end,
hut this time Stanford took a 4-3 lead with just two games
remaining. The Cardinal only needed to win one of those
two games to clinch the match, and No. 4 Cecilia 1 lam beat

In only its second year as a varsity team, the Cardinal has already managed to knock off a number of northeasterr
schools, many of which have been squash powerhouses for decades, and place highly at the competitive Howe Cup
Brown's No. 4 Breck Haynes in just
three games (out of a possible five) to
give Stanford seventh place and its
highest finish ever. Cardinal No. 1 Lily
Lorentzen then won her match for
good measure to bring the final score
to 6-3.
It was fitting that Lorentzen
should end the season for the Card, as
she had been the team's number one
player for the whole year. The junior,
who won an individual championship
with Harvard before transferring to
Stanford after her freshman year, was
recently named a first team Ail-
American as well. Combined with
standout sophomore Katy Brewster,

the Card wielded a fearsome combi
nation at the head of its lineup.
Senior leadership has also been
important to the team, and this year's
seniors — Esther Cheng, Stephanie
Kwok. karissa Hazy and Brooksie
Riley — all have a deep appreciation
for how far the team has come: all of
them began their careers when squash
was still a club sport.
"[A|s a senior, it's been incredibly
exciting to be on the team the past few
years and sec and experience first
hand how quickly we've improved,"
said Kwok.
"1 could have never imagined the
squash program would have come this
far four years ago." added Cheng,
who, like Kwok and Hazy, played ten
nis in high school instead of squash. In
fact. Cheng won the Wetzel Trophy
this year, which is given to the best
player in the nation who started play

ing squash in college.
And although this was a history
making season for the Card, the team
hopes to do even better next season.
Lorentzen and Brewster will be back
to lead the line, and this year's fresh
men. a group of five players that Tal
bot t called "awesome," will have a full
year's experience under their belts.
They will be joined by four incoming
freshmen recruits next year who Tal
bott believes will "add tremendous
depth, and increase our chances of
being able to challenge the top five."
Kwok took it one step further: "In
squash, it's rare for a new team to
break into the top few and we've man
aged to do that in just a few years," she
said."l'm confident that the team will
be gunning for No. 1 verv. verv soon."
