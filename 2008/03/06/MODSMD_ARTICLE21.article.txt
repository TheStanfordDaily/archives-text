# Toe to Toe
## Breaking down the Bruins 
### 
Brook Lopez vs. Kevin Love and Co.
Even if you don't know a single
thing about the Cardinal or the Bru
ins, you probably know that the Car
dinal's hopes tonight — as they have
all season — ride on the shoulders of
Brook Lopez. I lowever.as rare as it is,
Lopez will meet his match tonight
when he takes on UCLA's Kevin
Love, probably the best big man he
will face all season.
Love is big (listed at 6-10,270). fu
ndamental (his footwork is flawless)
and skilled (he has great touch any
where around the basket, and even
out to 3-point range). But those aren't
even the most prominent of his tal
ents: the UCLA freshman is a phe
nomenal passer, whether it's a kick
out from the post or a full-court outlet
•" ; to a streaking guard for an easy
dunk.
All that said, Lopez has the advan
tage over Love when it comes to size.
Although Love is listed at 6-foot-10,
most believe that he doesn't stand
over 6-foot-8. Lopez (who stands at 7
feet tall) will have the advantage
when it comes to sheer size, and he
should be able to get his mid-range
shot without too much trouble.
The match-up won't just be Lopez
vs. Love, though. TTie Bruins double
the post indiscriminately, and will
send a number of bodies at Brook
throughout the game. 6-foot Alfred
Aboya. ft-foot-8 Luc Richard Mbah a
Moute and ft-foot-9 Lorenzo Mata-
Real will all rotate on Lopez, whether
they're guarding him in the post or
doubling down once he gets the ball.
Despite falling out of the starting line
up this season, Mata-Real may see
more minutes against Lopez as he is
the tallest and toughest defender in
the post for the Bruins.
Hie Cardinal's success will hinge
not only on whether or not Brook
(and Robin.for that matter) can score
in the post,but also how effectively he
handles the ferocious double teams
he's sure to face. Doubling down will
leave the Cardinal perimeter players
open, and although UCLA rotates

The game is being
billed as a
matchup of the
teams' big men

better than nearly any team out there
on defense. Goods and Hill will get
open looks from long-range if the
posts are able to pass out of the dou
ble teams.
Goods had 17 points last time out
in Stanford's January 76-67 loss to the
Bruins. A performance like that from
either him or I lill will go a long way in
keeping the Cardinal in tonight's
game. And it all starts in the post.
The battle of the backcourts
Junior point guard Mitch Johnson
has overachieved like no other this
season anil is a big reason behind
Stanford's 24-4 record. But he's going
to face two of the best defensive play
ers all year when he takes to the court
against UCLA's Darren Collison and
Russell Westbrook.
Aside from playing stingy on-ball
defense, both Collison and West
brook are ballhawks; Johnson will be
facing constant pressure from Colli
son when he's in the game and just as
much pressure from Westbrook when
he's out. The Bruins also like to trap
after on-ball screens,so the Cardinal's
effectiveness in handling the half
court pressure will go a long way in
deciding tonight's outcome. When
Stanford shocked lICLA at home last
season. 75-68, the team only got back
into the game after finding a remedy
for the Bruins' attacking defense.
