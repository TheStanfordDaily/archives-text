## Favre retires, leaving impact on fans 
### ROBERT IMRIE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GREEN BAY, Wis. â€” Wearing
a brand new No. 4 Packers jersey,
Dave Ellis sat at Curly's Pub at
Lambeau Field and watched the
sports shows on TV detail the great
career - and sudden retirement - of
Brett Favre.
Ellis had purchased the $75
Favre jersey just minutes earlier to
honor the Packers' retiring quar
terback, who called it quits Tuesday
after 16 seasons with Green Bay.
"You got to pay the man his re
spect," said Ellis, a somber look
across his face. "Nobody will ever
replace him.The athlete that he is. I
think he is the best of all time."
Ellis, 35, of Appleton. described
himself as depressed.
"It is hard to swallow with him
gone. 1 have watched him play foot
ball nearly half my life," Ellis said.
"Nah,you can't cry because he has
had an incredible career. We all
knew the end was going to be
here."
News of Favre's retirement
spread fast in this city of about
100,000 people - known as Title
town because of the Packers cham
pionship-rich history.
By early afternoon, a tribute to
Favre was already painted in green
and gold on a fence across the
street from Lambeau Field:"Brett -
Green Bay fans Thank You 4 all the
memories. Go Pack Go."
It was the handiwork of Christo
pher Handler, who promotes him
self as the Packer fence painter.
"1 feel sad that we are not going
to see him anymore. 1 am sure he
will do a lot for the community,"
Handler said.
Mohammed Heddaoui, general
manager of Brett Favre's Steak
house -just a long punt from Lam
beau Field on Brett Favre Pass - ex
pected the place to be full for din
ner TUesday night because of the
news about Favre. Business at a

souvenir shop was up 80 percent
from a normal Tuesday, mostly
more people buying autographed
items, he said.
Heddaoui runs Favre's business
but he got no early word of Favre's
retirement. "1 heard it on the news
like everyone else."
Heidi Berner, 21. of De Pere,
purchased 10 Favre jerseys from
the Packers Pro Shop hours after
Favre s retirement was announced.
It was her first Favre jersey and
some of her keepsakes will be kept
for her children, maybe even her
grandchildren, she said.

"He was just so amazing to
watch." she said. "He was the only
quarterback I know. I just want to
have them to remember the Favre
era."
Herman Reckelberg, 80. of
Green Bay. who serves on the
Packers Hall of Fame board, sat by
himself in the atrium at Lambeau
Field waiting for a meeting. It was
quiet and he found it easy to talk
about Favre.
"He was a great quarterback.
The Packers have to go on. We just
can't give up," Reckelberg said.
