## Former Cardinal Harris signs with Oak. 
### JOSH DUBOW THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ALAMEDA, Calif. â€”The Oak
land Raiders signed former Pro Bowl
receiver Javon Walker and free agent
offensive tackle Kwame Harris,
adding two offensive players the team
hopes will help quarterback JaMarcus
Russell.
Walker will receive a $6 million
signing bonus and $5 million in salary
in each of the first two years. The six
year deal could be worth up to $55
million, a person familiar with the
contract said on condition of
anonymity because the terms were
not released.
Harris is guaranteed $3 million in
the first year of his deal that would pay
him $16 million over three years, the
person said.
The signings fill positions of need
for the Raiders, who are trying to build
their offense around Russell, the first
overall pick in last year's draft.
Oakland also has renegotiated
running back Dominic Rhodes' con
tract this week, securing his return for
next season. Rhodes was due a $2 mil
lion roster bonus on Friday, but agreed
to restructure his deal.

Rhodes signed as a free agent last
year after helping Indianapolis win
the Super Bowl. He was suspended for
the first four games last season and
played sparingly until Justin Fargas
went down with a knee injury late in
the year. Rhodes ran for 237 yards the
last two games of the season and is ex
pected to share the load with Fargas
next season.
After losing receiver Jerry Porter to
Jacksonville through free agency, the
Raiders had only one wide receiver
under contract with more than six ca
reer catches.
Walker was released by Denver
last week after catching 26 passes for
287 yards and no touchdowns in eight
games last season. He started the sea
son with two 100-yard games before
missing two months following a third
operation on his right knee.
He was supplanted by Brandon
Marshall as the team's top receiver
and was released so the Broncos could
avoid paying him a $5.4 million option
bonus.
Coming off a torn knee ligament
that wiped out most of his 2005 season
in Green Bay, Walker piled up 1,084
yards and eight touchdowns on 69
catches in 2006 for Denver.

Walker made the Pro Bowl with
the Packers in 2004 after catching 89
passes for 1,382 yards and 12 touch
downs. He has 252 career catches for
3,815 yards and 30 scores.
Ronald Curry led the Raiders with 55
receptions for 717 yards last season,
but had only 11 catches in the final five
games last season. Curry has 174 ca
reer receptions for 2,166 yards and 11
touchdowns.
The other receivers under contract
are Johnnie Lee Higgins, who had six
catches as a rookie last season for 47
yards. Will Buchanon, who has one ca
reer reception, and Drisan James and
Todd Watkins, who have never caught
a pass in the NFL.
ITie Raiders also needed help at
tackle after cutting last year's starting
left tackle Barry Sims. They also re
signed free agent Cornell Green later
Wednesday. Green started at right
tackle for most of last season.
Harris, a first-round pick by San
Francisco in 2003. started all 32 games
in 2005-06 for the 49ers before being
relegated to a backup role last season.
Harris has been plagued by penalty
problems throughout his career, but
Oakland is hoping line coach Tom
Cable can resurrect him.
