# BIGGEST BATTLE
## No. 7 STANFORD TAKES ON No. 3 UCLA 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Any other weekend, the answer would be pre
dietable. "It's just another game," goes Stanford's
standard response to inquiries regarding the impor
tance of any particular contest. But tonight's game?
"It's a pretty big deal," senior forward Fred Wash
ington said.
No. 7 Stanford (24-4, 13-3 Pac-10) travels to Los
Angeles with a lot on the line. A conference regular
season title. A top seed in next week's Pac-10 Tourna
ment. Perhaps even the difference between a two or
three seed in the NCAA Tournament.
Tonight, the Cardinal takes on No. 3 UCLA (26-3,
14-2), a team that has been ranked in the top 10 all
year and likely a contender for the national champi
onship. But Stanford can control its own destiny
against the Bruins. A win tonight would put the team
in position for a co-regular season conference title
(provided Stanford takes care of business Saturday
against USC) for the Cardinal and give the team a top
seed in the Pac-10 tournament, which begins next

Wednesday.
But beating the Bruins will take scaling the bas
ketball equivalent of a brick wall. That is, 6-10, 270-
pound freshman big man Kevin Love.
Love, who averaged 21 points and 13.5 rebounds
as UCLA swept the Arizona schools last weekend, is
a rare match for the Lopez twins inside. Robin Lopez
will draw the defensive assignment, but both twins
fouled out struggling to contain Love the last time the
two teams met, a 76-67 UCLA win at Maples Jan. 3.
"We're going to do what we always do. and make
him work for everything he can get," head coach
Trent Johnson said of his strategy against Love. "We'll
play Robin on him and try to beat him to his sweet
spot. If he catches in the post, we'll try to stay down
and play hard and aggressive."
Playing hard and aggressive is the mantra for both
teams, especially on the defensive end. Stanford and
UCLA both rank among the top four in the confer
ence in points allowed, opponents' field goal per
centage, opponents' 3-point percentage, rebounding

NOTES: Brook and Robin Lopez will face a rare test tonight
when they go up against Kevin Love, one of the best big
men in the country. Both fouled out trying to contain Love
in the Cardinal's 76-67 loss on Jan. 3. On the line tonight
is a share of the Pac-10 regular season championship, in
addition to potentially higher seeding in both the Pac-10
and NCAA tournament.

defense,rebounding margin and blocked
shots. As physical as any team in the Pac
-10, the Bruins, Trent Johnson said, "don't
have any weaknesses."
That's because, along with Love in
side, the Bruins boast a potent presence
on the perimeter, including speedy
guards Darren Collison (14.3 points, 4.1
assists per game) and Russell Westbrook
(12.4 points, 4.6 assists).
"We have to play well," Johnson said.
" ITiere hasn't been a team that's beaten
them all year thu v hasn't played well. We
need to play well."
Stanford played well, but not well
enough, in January's loss. The Cardinal
hung tough until a late surge by the Bru
ins— fueled by junior swingman Josh
Shipp's five 3-pointers — put the game
out of reach.
Since then, however, Stanford players
said their squad has grown by leaps and
bounds. "It's night and day," junior guard
Anthony Goods said. "I think we're com
ing together, showing the team chemistry
that we've had. It's a completely different
team."
After coming short against the Bruins,
in subsequent games Stanford demon
strated an ability to rally from behind.
Just last Saturday, the Cardinal erased a
14-point first-half deficit to down then-
No. 22 Washington State 60-53.
"We have a strong mentality as a
team," Goods, a Southern California na
tive, said. "We've been down before,
we've come back, sometimes we haven't
comeback. We're going to keep
fighting regardless of what the score is."
Both teams are bearing down for
tonight's physical affair. The team that
limits mistakes and maintains poise and
composure among the hard screens and
flying elbows will likely emerge on top.
Neither, it seems, wants to be the first to
blink.
"I doubt they're going to switch up
their style of play for us," Washington
said,"Because we aren't going to do it for
them."
Goods agreed. Despite the ramifica
tions, he said, the team is approaching the
match-up like any other.
"We haven't done anything different
ly," he said."lt just feels like another Pac
-10 game."
Yet Goods could not omit the obvi
ous.
"It's probably,"he admitted,"the most
important game of the year right now."
