# BIGGEST BATTLE
## No. 7 STANFORD TAKES ON No. 3 UCLA 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Any other weekend, the answer would be pre
dietable. "It's just another game," goes Stanford's
standard response to inquiries regarding the impor
tance of any particular contest. But tonight's game?
"It's a pretty big deal," senior forward Fred Wash
ington said.
No. 7 Stanford (24-4, 13-3 Pac-10) travels to Los
Angeles with a lot on the line. A conference regular
season title. A top seed in next week's Pac-10 Tourna
ment. Perhaps even the difference between a two or
three seed in the NCAA Tournament.
Tonight, the Cardinal takes on No. 3 UCLA (26-3,
14-2), a team that has been ranked in the top 10 all
year and likely a contender for the national champi
onship. But Stanford can control its own destiny
against the Bruins. A win tonight would put the team
in position for a co-regular season conference title
(provided Stanford takes care of business Saturday
against USC) for the Cardinal and give the team a top
seed in the Pac-10 tournament, which begins next

Wednesday.
But beating the Bruins will take scaling the bas
ketball equivalent of a brick wall. That is, 6-10, 270-
pound freshman big man Kevin Love.
Love, who averaged 21 points and 13.5 rebounds
as UCLA swept the Arizona schools last weekend, is
a rare match for the Lopez twins inside. Robin Lopez
will draw the defensive assignment, but both twins
fouled out struggling to contain Love the last time the
two teams met, a 76-67 UCLA win at Maples Jan. 3.
"We're going to do what we always do. and make
him work for everything he can get," head coach
Trent Johnson said of his strategy against Love. "We'll
play Robin on him and try to beat him to his sweet
spot. If he catches in the post, we'll try to stay down
and play hard and aggressive."
Playing hard and aggressive is the mantra for both
teams, especially on the defensive end. Stanford and
UCLA both rank among the top four in the confer
ence in points allowed, opponents' field goal per
centage, opponents' 3-point percentage, rebounding

NOTES: Brook and Robin Lopez will face a rare test tonight
when they go up against Kevin Love, one of the best big
men in the country. Both fouled out trying to contain Love
in the Cardinal's 76-67 loss on Jan. 3. On the line tonight
is a share of the Pac-10 regular season championship, in
addition to potentially higher seeding in both the Pac-10
and NCAA tournament.
