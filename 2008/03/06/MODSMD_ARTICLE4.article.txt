# Longhorns pose threat to Cardinal
## Baseball heads to Austin for weekend series against UT 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball played the Saint Mary's Gaels to a
temporary tie on the road Wednesday, in a final tune-up
before the team's first major road trip of the season. Look
ing to avenge a previous 4-2 home loss against the Gaels,
Stanford rallied with three runs in the top of the ninth to
take a 7-6 lead before a lone St. Mary's run in the bottom
half of the inning forced the game to be postponed on ac
count of darkness. The action will resume before the
teams' next meeting on April 23 at Klein Field at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cardinal (6-3). meanwhile, will leave its friendly
Bay Area surroundings for the first time this season for a
weekend series against Texas in Austin. While the weath-

er promises to be
cool, the competi
tion will certainly
be blistering against
the always competi

NOTES: Stanford's game against St.
Mary's yesterday was postponed due to
darkness in the bottom of the ninth with
the score tied at 7-7. Stanford was trying
to avenge an early season 4-2 loss to the
Gaels. Junior Jeremy Bleich, the Cardi
nal's best pitcher so far this year, will start
on Friday in the first game of the weekend
series against the Longhorns.

and a 0.97 WHIP (Walks and hits per innings pitched).
Bleich, it seems, along with much of the rest of the Car
dinal pitching staff, has made great strides over the offsea
son. While the Metairie. La. native improved towards the
end of his sophomore season, he has already equaled his
win total from 2(X)7 (2-8) and has thus far cut down his
EiRA by over three runs. It's a transformation that has
made Bleich the bedrock of the Cardinal's rotation this
season and one he attributes to hard work, a focus on the
details of pitching and strong coaching along the way.
"I was in the Cape (Cod Baseball League] with Ware
ham again this summer, had a good time there and got
back on track," Bleich said. "1 had a little bit of an up-and
down season [in 2(X)7], but towards the end of last year
things started to come together and then I continued to try
to get better over the summer, and in the fall and spring
leading up to the games. You know, just trying to work tin
the little things."
It's that dedication that led to solid summer perform
ances in the Cape Cod League,where Bleich led the Gate
men in wins with a 4-2 record — a feat that was all the
more impressive given Wareham's overall record of 15-29.
I lis work towards the end of 2(K)7 and in the offseason led
to him being named the Cardinal's opening day starter
against Nebraska.
"I found out at the beginning of
the week [before the Nebraska se
ries], maybe Monday or Tuesday of
that week," the Stanford junior said.
"It's been very exciting. It's an honor
to try and lead the team. We have a
lot of strong guys on the pitching
staff, a lot of starting guys, so, yeah,
it's been an honor."
Stanford's pitching staff has made
a lot of improvements on the whole
so far this year.cutting its team ERA
from 6.01 to 4.84. It's a change Bleich
attributes to an urgency to improve
on last season's 28-28 record as well
as a fresh approach from a new
pitching coach.
"Obviously there's always an ex
pectation here to get better, because
of the program's prestige and all of
that," he said. "There's a new pitch
ing coach [former Major Leaguer
and Stanford standout Jeff Austin]
and a lot of new energy this season
just because we had a little bit of a
rough year last year. And yeah, we
believe we can win, and we can win
because we're good and it's just a
matter of bringing it to the ballpark
everyday."
As a junior who will be eligible
for the MLB draft this summer, it
would certainly seem as though
there could be an added layer of
pressure for Bleich as he attempts to
help lead the Cardinal back to the
College World Series in Omaha this
season. Indeed, a handful of Major
League scouts were rumored to be
on hand, in part at least, to watch
Bleich make his first start of the year
against Nebraska. But according to
the southpaw, thoughts beyond this
season of play aren't likely to be
much of a distraction.
"It actually really doesn't [weigh
on me], because you really [know]
how good we are and you realize that
we really can go to Omaha and just
winning and having fun with winning
is what's most important," Bleich
said of the extra eyes in the stands for
his first start. "The other stuff, if you
take care of the little things the other
stuff will take care of itself, so you
don't need to worry about it."
If things keep going for Bleich the
way they have so far, there can be lit
tle doubt of that.

NOTES: Stanford's game against St.
Mary's yesterday was postponed due to
darkness in the bottom of the ninth with
the score tied at 7-7. Stanford was trying
to avenge an early season 4-2 loss to the
Gaels. Junior Jeremy Bleich, the Cardi
nal's best pitcher so far this year, will start
on Friday in the first game of the weekend
series against the Longhorns.

and a 0.97 WHIP (Walks and hits per innings pitched).
Bleich, it seems, along with much of the rest of the Car
dinal pitching staff, has made great strides over the offsea
son. While the Metairie. La. native improved towards the
end of his sophomore season, he has already equaled his
win total from 2(X)7 (2-8) and has thus far cut down his
EiRA by over three runs. It's a transformation that has
made Bleich the bedrock of the Cardinal's rotation this
season and one he attributes to hard work, a focus on the
details of pitching and strong coaching along the way.
"I was in the Cape (Cod Baseball League] with Ware
ham again this summer, had a good time there and got
back on track," Bleich said. "1 had a little bit of an up-and
down season [in 2(X)7], but towards the end of last year
things started to come together and then I continued to try
to get better over the summer, and in the fall and spring
leading up to the games. You know, just trying to work tin
the little things."
It's that dedication that led to solid summer perform
ances in the Cape Cod League,where Bleich led the Gate
men in wins with a 4-2 record — a feat that was all the
more impressive given Wareham's overall record of 15-29.
I lis work towards the end of 2(K)7 and in the offseason led
to him being named the Cardinal's opening day starter
against Nebraska.
"I found out at the beginning of
the week [before the Nebraska se
ries], maybe Monday or Tuesday of
that week," the Stanford junior said.
"It's been very exciting. It's an honor
to try and lead the team. We have a
lot of strong guys on the pitching
staff, a lot of starting guys, so, yeah,
it's been an honor."
Stanford's pitching staff has made
a lot of improvements on the whole
so far this year.cutting its team ERA
from 6.01 to 4.84. It's a change Bleich
attributes to an urgency to improve
on last season's 28-28 record as well
as a fresh approach from a new
pitching coach.
"Obviously there's always an ex
pectation here to get better, because
of the program's prestige and all of
that," he said. "There's a new pitch
ing coach [former Major Leaguer
and Stanford standout Jeff Austin]
and a lot of new energy this season
just because we had a little bit of a
rough year last year. And yeah, we
believe we can win, and we can win
because we're good and it's just a
matter of bringing it to the ballpark
everyday."
As a junior who will be eligible
for the MLB draft this summer, it
would certainly seem as though
there could be an added layer of
pressure for Bleich as he attempts to
help lead the Cardinal back to the
College World Series in Omaha this
season. Indeed, a handful of Major
League scouts were rumored to be
on hand, in part at least, to watch
Bleich make his first start of the year
against Nebraska. But according to
the southpaw, thoughts beyond this
season of play aren't likely to be
much of a distraction.
"It actually really doesn't [weigh
on me], because you really [know]
how good we are and you realize that
we really can go to Omaha and just
winning and having fun with winning
is what's most important," Bleich
said of the extra eyes in the stands for
his first start. "The other stuff, if you
take care of the little things the other
stuff will take care of itself, so you
don't need to worry about it."
If things keep going for Bleich the
way they have so far, there can be lit
tle doubt of that.
