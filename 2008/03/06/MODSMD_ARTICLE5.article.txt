The No. 7 Stanford softball team hosts
the Stanford Classic this weekend at Smith
Family Stadium. Competition begins today
when the Cardinal takes on Campbell Uni
versity at 4:(H) pm. Stanford will play six
games over the weekend, facing both Camp
bell and the College of Charleston twice, in
addition to games against North Dakota

State and Texas Tech.
The Cardinal, 21-2 on the young season,
faces another busy weekend but has a de
cent chance of sweeping the competition.
None of the team's opponents are ranked,
and Stanford's only losses have come at the
hands of No. 5 Florida and a very dangerous
(and then-No. 25) Texas team. Combine that
with the fact that the Gators needed a walk
off three-run homer for the win. and Stan
ford should head into the weekend with

plenty of confidence.
It will be especially important for the
Cardinal to stay focused as it continues its
current 16-game homestand. Stanford won
the first game of the streak TUesday, defeat
ing Boston College 5-1 behind a dominant
performance from freshman pitcher Ashley
Chinn. I ler 11 strikeouts were a career high,
and Chinn limited the Golden Eagles to two
hits and one run.
Stanford doesn't face another ranked op

ponent until Pac-1() play begins with three
consecutive games against No. 7 Arizona
and top-ranked Arizona State on March 28-
30. But the Card should expect a challenge
when it faces off against Campbell this after
noon.
The Fighting Camels come to the Farm
with a 14-6 record, plenty of power —25
homeruns to Stanford's 26 — and a re-
spectable team batting average of
.293. I"he pitching staff is led by
freshman Lauren Stephan and soph
omore Brittany Stanley, who togeth
er have combined for three shutouts
and all of the team's 14 wins.
But Stanford's dominance on the
mound is clear. The Cardinal's 1.23

LRA is less than half of Campbell's
(2.76), and the Card has allowed
fewer walks (33 to 51) while striking
out almost twice as many batters
(177 to 90).
Stanford continues play tomor
row at 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Game
times for Saturday are scheduled for
the same time slots, and the Card's
final game will begin at 11:00 a.m. on
Sunday.
