## Former Mexican Pres. speaks at Farm Fox addresses NAFTA, immigration and democracy 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former Mexican President Vicente
Fox called for better treatment of
Mexican immigrants in the United States,
defended the North American Free
Trade Agreement and strongly criticized
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in a
wide ranging two-hour talk at the
Graduate School of Business on
Wednesday night.
Fox, who led the government from
2000 until 2(X)6, expressed concern about
the relatively slow rate of development in
Latin America.
The region "spent most of the 20th
century in the hands of military dictator
ships or authoritarian governments," he
said, "which caused high levels of corrup
tion and inefficiency."
Fox rebuked Chavez for his apparent
support of Columbian rebels and his fail
ure to learn the lessons from failed pop
ulist regimes of the past.
"We need a strong front to defeat
organized crime, terrorism and guerril
las." he said. "[Chavez] has been too close
to the guerrillas. He's part of the prob
lem, and he is not part of the solution."
Fox heaped praise upon the migrants
who come from Mexico to the U.S. in
search of a better life. He said that the
American economy would collapse with
out the more than 350,000 people who
cross the border each year.
"Politicians have to think long term."
said the 65-year-old Fox. "They have to
make sure they're working for the next
generation, not for the polls or the next
election."

Fox used the term "migrant" repeat
edly to describe those crossing the bor
der. Many conservatives, especially in
border states, have criticized the Mexican
leader for supporting what they see as
"amnesty for illegal aliens." One leading
critic of Fox has been CNN's Lou Dobbs,
who often talks about the negatives of
illegal immigration on his television
show.
Fox chided Dobbs and also implicated
Fox News host Bill O'Reilly for what he
said were xenophobic statements.
"1 am not calling for open borders"
Fox said. "Don't leave this issue in the
hands of xenophobes."
He declared that immigrants are not
terrorists.
"They are loyal. They are hard work
ing. They love their families. They love
Mexico. They're doing the best they can,"
he said. "They are contributing to the
well-being of tiiis economy.The quality of
life that U.S. families are enjoying mostly
comes from these hard working, loyal
people."
Fox called for "further innovation"
and unspecified improvements to
"change for the better" the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which
he said has been very beneficial for
Mexico. The debated success of the
treaty, negotiated during Bill Clinton's
presidency, has become a hot button issue
in the battle for the Democratic nomina
tion. Fox pointed to the European Union
as a successful example of how coopera
tion can lead to win-win for developed
and developing countries.
"Mexico's trade imports from the U.S.
are greater than what Italy, France,

Germany and the U.K. have together," he
said. "This $200 billion U.S. trade [sur
plus] creates jobs for millions of U.S. citi
zens."
Fox criticized ethanol and bio-fuel as
unsustainable forms of alternative ener
gy-
"Tortillas are more expensive than
ever." he said. "The demand for bio-fuel
and bio-energy has increased the prices
of corn, so it is not a wise decision in the
long term."
When asked about controlling the
llow of illegal narcotics. Fox said the U.S.
must do more to clamp down on demand.
The United States is the largest consumer
of drugs in the world, he said, and his
country is "caught" in the middle as drug
traffickers from South American nations
smuggle their contraband through
Mexico to drug consumers here.
"As long as there is a demand, there
will be a supply." he said. "1 often ask
myself what the U.S. is doing to limit the
transit of drugs. However, this is not a
case of blaming each other â€” it is a high
ly complicated issue."
Fox also outlined the importance of
education, citing it as a key factor in solv
ing many of the problems faced in Latin
America. He suggested scholarship
incentives to increase the high school
graduation rate, which he said is around
20 percent.
In an interview with The Daily, Fox
said that it was of "utmost" importance
that Mexicans feel the urge to return to
their homeland, given that many of the
country's more skilled workers and intel-
