## Student loans safe, Univ. says Stanford undergrads protected from impact of credit crisis on loan market 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the nationwide credit crisis spreads, students should
expect higher interest rates for federal loans and tight
ened access to private lines of credit. Growing concern has
driven some universities to draw up emergency strategies
in case the student loan market fails, but Stanford officials
say students here should not worry too much about it.
At Stanford, some of the University's 11 preferred
lenders have already increased rates for federal loans by
one percent, according to Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper. She said recently announced changes to
Stanford's financial aid program suggest that concerns
over the student loan market will not necessarily be a
problem for undergraduates.
"We are no longer expecting anyone to borrow as part
of their financial aid package," Cooper said. "It's our grad
uate students that will be impacted. Particularly, students
working on master's degrees, who are borrowing a lot,
could be impacted greatly."
Cooper added that some undergraduates may continue
to borrow to help with expected parent contributions.
However, she is confident that the nationwide credit
crunch will not have much of an impact on such students.
Nelnet. the Nebraska-based company that works with
the Stanford Federal Credit Union to provide the private
loans recommended by the University, has announced that
it will be more selective with the loan applicants it choos
es to accept.
Nelnet announced in January that it would be laying off
300 of its workers and begin retreating from the student
loan business. But Cooper said the announcement will
have a negligible impact on the so-called SNAP loans
offered to Stanford students, since these are funded by the
Stanford Federal Credit Union and will likely be insulated
from the nation's credit crisis.
"For our SNAP loans, when Nelnet made that
announcement they very quickly came to us and said, 'You
guys will be okay,'" Cooper said. "The SFCU is acting as
the funder: they are the source of the money. The credit
union has said they are very much in favor of keeping
things the way that they are."
Cooper said Stanford's default rate of 0.8 percent is so
low that there is little danger of lenders backing out of the
Stanford market. So far, none of the 11 companies
Stanford identifies as recommended lenders for federal
loans has decided to drop out of the student loan market.
