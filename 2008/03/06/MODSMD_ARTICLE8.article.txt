## Student loans safe, Univ. says Stanford undergrads protected from impact of credit crisis on loan market 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the nationwide credit crisis spreads, students should
expect higher interest rates for federal loans and tight
ened access to private lines of credit. Growing concern has
driven some universities to draw up emergency strategies
in case the student loan market fails, but Stanford officials
say students here should not worry too much about it.
At Stanford, some of the University's 11 preferred
lenders have already increased rates for federal loans by
one percent, according to Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper. She said recently announced changes to
Stanford's financial aid program suggest that concerns
over the student loan market will not necessarily be a
problem for undergraduates.
"We are no longer expecting anyone to borrow as part
of their financial aid package," Cooper said. "It's our grad
uate students that will be impacted. Particularly, students
working on master's degrees, who are borrowing a lot,
could be impacted greatly."
Cooper added that some undergraduates may continue
to borrow to help with expected parent contributions.
However, she is confident that the nationwide credit
crunch will not have much of an impact on such students.
Nelnet. the Nebraska-based company that works with
the Stanford Federal Credit Union to provide the private
loans recommended by the University, has announced that
it will be more selective with the loan applicants it choos
es to accept.
Nelnet announced in January that it would be laying off
300 of its workers and begin retreating from the student
loan business. But Cooper said the announcement will
have a negligible impact on the so-called SNAP loans
offered to Stanford students, since these are funded by the
Stanford Federal Credit Union and will likely be insulated
from the nation's credit crisis.
"For our SNAP loans, when Nelnet made that
announcement they very quickly came to us and said, 'You
guys will be okay,'" Cooper said. "The SFCU is acting as
the funder: they are the source of the money. The credit
union has said they are very much in favor of keeping
things the way that they are."
Cooper said Stanford's default rate of 0.8 percent is so
low that there is little danger of lenders backing out of the
Stanford market. So far, none of the 11 companies
Stanford identifies as recommended lenders for federal
loans has decided to drop out of the student loan market.
Several very large lenders not on Stanford's preferred
list — including College Loan
Corp. and the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency —
have announced that they will no
longer originate federal loans,
according to an article in the
Washington Post.
Cooper said Stanford currently
has no plans to replace federally
backed loans issued through the
Federal Family Education Loan
Program (FFELP) with a direct
loan system. Several universities,
including Georgetown, arc setting
up emergency plans to become
direct lenders in case the student
loan market continues to falter.
"I think the one-percent
increase [in rates] will be uniform
across our lenders, but that is still
less expensive than a direct loan
program," Cooper said.
Cooper was surprised that
Georgetown is considering a direct

loan plan.
"I'm surprised that they think
their lenders are dropping out of
the program because Georgetown
most likely has a similar default
rate to us," Cooper said. "I would
expect them to not have great diffi
culty finding lenders. When the
lenders are competing for students,
that's when you get borrower ben
efits tossed in. With direct loan pro
grams there arc no borrower bene
fits available."
Borrower benefits — the dis
counts that lenders throw in
beyond the low rates mandated by
the federal government — are the
biggest advantages of the federal
loan program for students.
"As long as we have lenders
competing for students," Cooper
said, "then the FFELP programs
are a better deal for our students,
for now anyway."
Lenders nationwide are scram
bling to gather funds as news of a
faltering student loan market
spreads discomfort across campus
es. Sallie Mae recently secured $34
billion in financing, and Chief

Executive Officer Albert Lord sent
an email this week to several
schools, including Stanford,
explaining that things are not as
bad as they may seem.
"Financial strength is often
more perception than reality, but
with today's 24/7 media, perception
can become reality," Lord wrote in
the email. "Sallie Mae worked hard
in the face of historically difficult
credit markets these past few
months to ensure that we have the
ability to meet the needs of your
students and families."
Cooper said Stanford students
should not be overly concerned
about the impact of the credit crisis
on their loans.
"Because Stanford is Stanford,
we have a very low default rate in
the federal programs," Cooper said.
"And also because of the academic
reputation of Stanford, the lenders
are just falling over each other to
establish relationships with our stu
dents."
