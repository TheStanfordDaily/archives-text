Come June, the class of 2008 will realize that their
relationship with Stanford does not end with gradua
tion. Following a trend among elite schools, develop
ment office officials are increasingly looking to
younger alumni for donations.
Last year. Stanford received more gifts than any
other school. To increase the so-called "participation
rate" of alumni — Stanford has long lagged behind Ivy
League stalwarts like Princeton — the University
wants to get recent graduates giving early and often,
even if their donations are not substantial to start.

"By asking young alumni to make an annual gift of
any size. Stanford is asking that young alumni continue
this tradition of helping make possible for the next
generation the opportunities that they had as stu
dents," said Rebecca Vogel, Senior Director of
Communications and Stewardship in the Office of
Development.
Over the past decade. Stanford has successfully
solicited alumni donations due in part to the launch of
aggressive fundraising drives, such as The Campaign
for Undergraduate Education, which ended in
December 2005 alter exceeding its goal of raising $1
