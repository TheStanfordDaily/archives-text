## Recent grads solicited for donations 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Come June, the class of 2008 will realize that their
relationship with Stanford does not end with gradua
tion. Following a trend among elite schools, develop
ment office officials are increasingly looking to
younger alumni for donations.
Last year. Stanford received more gifts than any
other school. To increase the so-called "participation
rate" of alumni — Stanford has long lagged behind Ivy
League stalwarts like Princeton — the University
wants to get recent graduates giving early and often,
even if their donations are not substantial to start.

"By asking young alumni to make an annual gift of
any size. Stanford is asking that young alumni continue
this tradition of helping make possible for the next
generation the opportunities that they had as stu
dents," said Rebecca Vogel, Senior Director of
Communications and Stewardship in the Office of
Development.
Over the past decade. Stanford has successfully
solicited alumni donations due in part to the launch of
aggressive fundraising drives, such as The Campaign
for Undergraduate Education, which ended in
December 2005 alter exceeding its goal of raising $1


LAURA CHANG/The Stanford Daily
billion, and The Stanford Challenge,
which was launched in October 2006
with the hope of raising $4.3 billion in
five years.
The class of 2007 has been the tar
get of the most recent University
efforts to solicit donations. Often
starting with lower salaries and bur
dened with student loans, some
young alumni find it financially diffi
cult to even consider such philan
thropic spending.
"They do target the most recently
graduated classes, since our Stanford
experience is still fresh — and likely
to engender warm, altruistic feel
ings," said Sarah Douglas '07. "But it
seems very inefficient, since we're the
group with the least access to dispos
able funds."
Anneli von Reinhart '07 said the
University made a large push to solic
it donations from its most recent
graduating class, offering small prizes
as an incentive to donate any
amount.
"1 understand that the percent of
graduating seniors who give to the
University is perceived as a referen
dum on how happy alumni are with
their undergraduate experience."
Reinhart said. "But my parents and 1
had just gone into some serious debt
to afford Stanford, and though 1
loved my time here and am incredi
bly grateful to the University, they've
got all the money that I can give at
the moment."
Recent graduates like Emily
Gerth '07 were encouraged to
donate, regardless of how small the
amount.
"1 haven't decided exactly how
much I'll give this year, but 1 received
money from The Stanford Fund as
part of my financial aid as well as by
being a member of student groups,"
Gerth said. "Even though I can't give
much. 1 feel |1] owe at least a little bit
of that back."
"It probably won't be more than
$100." she added, "but it's about the
thought for me."
Acknowledging that younger
alumni often have considerable
financial pressures post-graduation,
Vogel said that no gift is too small to
be appreciated.
"Small gifts really do matter,"
Vogel added. "Last year. 12,356 gifts
to The Stanford Fund under $100
added up to $422,663."

The push to begin donating begins
with the Senior Gift campaign, in
which seniors are encouraged to
make a donation to The Stanford
Fund. Last year, 46 percent of the
senior class contributed to this cam
paign. raising a total of $83,974.03,
which includes matching funds pro
vided by donors including Peter
Bing, the Parents' Advisory Board

"Even though 1
can't give much, I
feel [I] owe at least
a little bit of that
back."

and Atwell Match. The Class of
2007's senior gift campaign repre
sented a marked increase from the
2006 campaign, which raised dona
tions totaling $58,914.77.
"Tuition only covers about 60 per
cent of the real costs of a Stanford
education." Vogel said. "What this
means is that all students, even those
paying full tuition, are subsidized to a
degree by the generosity of alumni
and friends who support Stanford."
Kim Tran '07 said donations pro
vided her with the financial aid she
needed to attend Stanford.
"As a first-generation college stu
dent. and being from a lower middle
income family, the financial aid pack
age at Stanford was such an impor
tant reason why I came," Tran said.
"Without it. 1 would have never been
able to afford to come and have the
wonderful experiences of my under
graduate career."
While many recent grads con
tribute something right away, others
find requests for money hard to
stomach less than a year out of
school.
"I do plan on gladly donating to
Stanford in the future." Douglas said,
"but it's going to be a conscious deci
sion on my part, and not a spur-of
the-moment impulse sparked by a
phone call or a letter soliciting dona
tions."
