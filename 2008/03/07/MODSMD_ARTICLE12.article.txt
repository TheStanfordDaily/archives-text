## Faculty senate looks at NCAA certification 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a pre
liminary report on Stanford's
mandatory ten-year NCAA accredi
tation process at its meeting
Thursday afternoon.
"Athletic certification is simply a
means devised by the NCAA to pre
serve tlu integrity of college-level
athletics," said LaDoris Cordell, spe
cial counsel to President John
Hennessy for campus relations.
At the core of the certification
process — created by the NCAA in
1993 —is a self-study, Cordell
explained. The self-study involves
collecting feedback from coaches
and community members as well as a
survey of Stanford's more than 7(X)
student athletes themselves. 81 per
cent of varsity athletes responded,
Cordell said.
Psychology Prof. Lee Scott, a
member of the accreditation com
mittee, presented the survey's find
ings.
"The overall story is one of gener
ally very high levels of satisfaction,"
he said, summarizing athlete
responses to 22 questions about ath
letic support, advising and race and
gender equality of treatment in ath
letic programs.
Student satisfaction was lowest in
response to a question regarding
opportunities to participate in "pro
grams and courses that interest me
(e.g. overseas studies)."
Lee called the dip. which became
more pronounced by class year at
Stanford, "mildly disturbing." He
attributed it to realization among
athletes of "foregone opportunities"
— that conducting intensive
research or studying abroad was dif
ficult while participating in a varsity
sport.
Professors called for the creation
of more support programs for ath
letes.
"I'm realistic. I understand that
our student athletes have basically a
40 hour a week job." said Law Prof.

"Will Stanford
be certified?
Yes, we will."

LADORIS CORDELL,
Special Counsel to
President John Hennessy
Hank Greely, who discussed sched
uling more freshman and sopho
more seminars so they do not con
flict with common practice times.
"1 suspect that I myself and some
of my colleagues don't understand
the challenges facing Stanford ath
letes." said Music Prof. Mark
Applebaum, who noted the need for
a resource that would educate facul
ty about the issue.
Cordell expressed confidence
that Stanford would be reaccredited
by the NCAA in spring of 2009,
when the current ten-year cycle
comes to an end, but he told faculty
that the process represents an
opportunity for Stanford to identify
areas for improvement in its athlet
ics programs.
"Will Stanford be certified? Yes.
we will," she said. "We view the sur
vey as an opportunity to have an
open and honest discussion of athlet
ics at Stanford."
The Faculty Senate also approved
graduate degree "nominating
authority" for the new interdiscipli
nary department of Environmental
Earth System Science in the School
of Earth Sciences by a unanimous
voice vote, permitting the depart
ment to grant advanced degrees.
