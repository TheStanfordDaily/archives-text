						de-lightful solution 
### 
Workers from Stanford Facilities are
currently spraying trees around
campus with high-pressure water
hoses. They are trying to head off Stanford's
annual plague of caterpillars by knocking
moth larvae out of the trees.
But a more elegant solution to the cater
pillar problem may be to instead rein in light
pollution on campus. Much of the campus's
lighting radiates towards the sky. which both
obscures our view of the night stars and at
tracts insects (like moths) from miles around.
Solving Stanford's lighting problem would
both reduce energy use and conceivably help
solve our caterpillar problem. The matter
warrants further investigation by the Univer
sity.
Picture for a moment the lampposts in the
middle of campus. They are black poles
topped by glass domes that house the light
bulb. Under this design, about half of the light
emanating from each lamppost shines above
the horizontal plane, upwards into the sky.
These misdirected lights are not just wasteful
but also polluting.
The University ought to commission an
external evaluation of its outdoor lighting
system. Unnecessary use of stadium lights
must continue to be restricted. New lamp
posts should have "fully shielded" lamps that
block vertical light. And Stanford should
retrofit existing lightposts with covers, redi
recting stray light back towards the ground
where it belongs.
Hissock moths, the genus of caterpillars
and moths that swarm our campus each year,
have a long history of infesting urban areas.
An entry in American Naturalist from 1893
describes "myriads" of tussock moth caterpil
lars descending upon Chicago. The author
wrote that the moths are "attracted by artifi
cial lights" and congregate around lit shop
windows. Today's entomological literature
confirms that tussock moths are attracted to
lights and that moths will migrate from miles
away towards well-lit areas. These findings
may explain why well-lit Stanford teems with
caterpillars each year while dimly-lit nearby
Atherton. according to interviews with local
residents, does not.
Granted, the link between stray light and

Stanford's caterpillars is difficult to prove.
The damage caused by light pollution, how
ever. is beyond doubt. Studies demonstrate
that light pollution wreaks havoc on the
ecosystem by disorienting migrating birds,
distorting rodents' Circadian rhythms and
drawing insects (for instance, the tussock
moth) from miles away out of their natural
habitats. Students taking Prof. Dement's
"Sleep and Dreams" learn that light also dis
turbs humans' sleeping habits.
The stray light additionally obscures our
view of the stars. In relatively unlit areas, one
can still see the Milky Way. the tremendous
white band of our galaxy's stars that streaks
across the night sky. Yet from the Stanford
campus, one can hardly even make out the
constellations. The Lick Observatory outside
San Jose has been so affected by local light
pollution that San Jose has retrofitted most of
its streetlamps. The lamps are fully shielded
and have low pressure sodium bulbs that the
observatory can easily filter. Stanford can fol
low the local community's lead by introduc
ing light-dimming measures of its own. In
doing so, the University would probably save
money â€” Calgary's streetlamp retrofit saves
the city millions of dollars each year in ener
gy costs; as less light is wasted, less power is
needed to provide the same amount of illumi
nation.
On a happy note, not all of Stanford's
lamps pollute. Ilie lamps found outside Ilnci
na Commons, for example, are covered on
top with a reflecting surface. If a retrofit
proves unfeasible, hopefully the University
will employ this "fully shielded" design on at
least all new streetlamps.
At a time when the University inaugurates
a new building for the study of the environ
ment and sustainability, when it tells students
to conserve by replacing their incandescent
light bulbs with com pact-fluorescent lamps
and when it replaces students' high-flow
showerheads with low-flow showerheads, it
ought to get its own conservation house in
order. Stanford's light pollution damages the
environment and wastes energy, yet it can be
stopped quickly and cheaply, lliat way. Stan
ford might remove the caterpillars from the
ground and reestablish the stars in the skv.
