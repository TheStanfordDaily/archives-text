## The 						anti-hero 
### 
I'm sorry to admit, dear readers, but no. I
am not a hero.
ITiis last Wednesday, while heading over
to The Axe and Palm to enjoy sterile, fluores
cent lighting and sub-optimal overpriced
food, I happened upon a man biking away
from the nearby parking lot at speeds quite
astonishing for 11 p.m., especially given the
complete absence of a bike light. ITiese
speeds were even more astonishing given
that he was biking through a narrow, relative
ly populated hallway and. amazingly, down a
flight of stairs.
He was clutching a bag of something, hid
den under a large white and black camou
flage coat. He was being trailed by not one
but two Stanford police officers, driving large
SUVs with lights flashing and sirens blaring.
Now. I'm no suburban kid — I knew the full
significance of this situation.
This guy had clearly just stolen some
thing. And now he happened to be barreling
straight for me as I parked my teal 70s racing
bike near the entrance ofThe Axe and Palm.
I was in his way,seconds from having my styl
ish vintage bicyclc ruined. What would you
have done in this situation?
Well, here's where I have to admit that I
let the bastard pass me.True, part of this was
out of fear of being hit by his quickly moving
bicycle. But what do you do in a situation like
that? Throw something at the guy? Trip the
bicycle? Grapple him?
What followed was a tense few seconds,
filled with confusion for all involved. Person
ally, I was still awaiting the officer's go-ahead
to begin bear-hugging the petty thief in the
name of justice and the American Way. After
all, I am a relatively athletically fit individual.
Given the presence of the bag, I could have
easily put the punk off balance and then pro
ceeded to step on his face or something. I was
ready to make sure whose ever GPS was
stolen from their well-outfitted BMW could
feel a sense of justice at the valiant takedown
of the fearsome villain. But my courageous
rescue all hinged on the answer to one ques
tion: Mr. Officer, would it be OK for me to
take down this perp?
The perpetrator himself, on the other
hand, was probably quivering in his
metaphorical boots, noting that such an ath
letically fit individual as myself could easily
take him — "Perhaps this athletically fit in
dividual's sense of vigilante justice could at
least this once be overshadowed by his love
of soggy crepes, as he decides to enter that
building behind me!" he mused,clutching his

paper hag (potentially) filled with stolen
OPS devices. His actions themselves all
hinged on one question: "athletically fit indi
vidual in front of me. would it he OK for me
to continue on my merry way?"
Finally, the police officer, driving his vehi
cle in an area obviously designed for pedes
trian traffic, was probably himself wondering
if I would be stupid enough to intervene. His
actions hinged on this question: "Idiot who
happens to be standing between us and the
guy we're trying to catch, would it be OK to
let us take over and apply our years of ex
pertise?"
I had to conclude, in one instant, that
these potential concerns of the police officer
were the most valid here. But. by god, as I
watched the man in the camouflage jacket
rocket across the facade of the Old Union
and down the stairwell on the other side. 1
couldn't help but think of my cowardice. I
could have stopped this guy!
Reflecting later, some rational part of me
was able to justify my action ... or rather,
lack of action, in this situation: those "he
roes" we see on the news — those guys in the
right place at the right time who happened to
stop a criminal by tripping him or what have
you — well, those guys are nothing more
than lucky idiots.Think of all the people who
try to stop criminals and fail... they must
exist as well, but they're not so exceptional
and thus don't get as much press time.
It is only under the small possibility that I
try to stop this guy and succeed that 1 would
get fame and glory. Then I could write my
Daily column about actually heing a hero, in
stead. Barring the possibility of someone
finding out that 1 had made the whole thing
up. I could reap the infamy of my exception
al case and make people just like me believe
in the power of vigilante justice.
But no.it didn't turn out that way. Call me
a coward if you will, but 1 let the man go. I am
not a hero, and I do not claim to be. 1 chose a
soggy crepe instead.

Nat did not actually see this criminal appre
hended. If you have any idea of what became of
him, setid him an email at nat.hillardQPstan
