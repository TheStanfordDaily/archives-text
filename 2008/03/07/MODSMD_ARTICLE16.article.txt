## A 						case study on prejudice in today's world 
### 
An Asian friend of mine, born and raised
in Australia, wanted to know what I,
and Americans in general, thought of
Max Karson's piece," If it's war the Asians want
... it's war they'll get," recently published in the
University of Colorado's student newspaper.
The Campus Press. As 1 read the piece, I had to
double-check that it was published in 2008, be
cause for a moment I thought I was back in the
1 S(K)s. In the piece, Karson detailed his plans for
lynching the whole Asian student body at the
university I was completely shocked.
Karson has a long history of saying crazy
and stupid things, but it didn't seem he could
be written off as another isolated whackjob
— enough people agreed with his sentiments
that they allowed the piece to be published.
Some of his editors even defended the piece
by claiming the work was satire, although I
think to any reasonable reader it was about
as satirical as a KKK manifesto.
"The New White Right," an article pub
lished in the Wall Street Journal two years
ago, stated that white families were actively
moving out of Cupertino in order to avoid
the high influx of Asian people. The article
focused on the effects Asians have had on the
school system — parents claimed Asians
brought an unhealthy and overly competitive
focus on academics. It seemed, however, that
the article adopted the parents' views, advo
cating that Asian values of hard-work and
education were actually poisoning the educa
tional system.
All top-notch academic institutions will
be comprised of the same highly motivated,
high-achieving students, regardless of ethnic
make-up. Monta Vista, a top-ranked high

school that starred in the article, and which I
attended, is no different.
Why the Wall Street Journal chose to
write an article implicitly casting Asians in a
negative light, and why Max Karson's piece
wasn't immediately discarded, leaves the im
pression that it's acceptable to malign some
one based on their race or ethnicity.
How do we fight against these creeping
prejudices? Like dealing with a bully, people
need to be proactive in defending themselves
against prejudice. Fighting prejudice can
manifest itself in many different ways, some
highly unique. For example, Darrell
Hamamoto, a professor of Asian-American
Studies at UC-Davis. Professor Hamamoto
created a pornography film starring an
Asian-American male and female in an ef
fort to combat negative stereotypes about
Asian-American sexuality.
Everything said so far applies to every
other institutionalized and accepted case of
prejudice. True acceptance means harmony
among all races. So to all people of the world:
fight for your rights, and respect one another.
