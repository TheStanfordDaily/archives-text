A different take on the 'graying' 6th
man
To the Editor:
I entered Stanford as an undergraduate in
the fall of 1997 and have never left. In the last
eleven years, I've graduated, co-termed,
worked as a staff member, started on a Ph.D
and served as aTA for classes 1 once took. I've
painted my face for football, been in 6th Man,
been a yell leader and even (God forbid) writ
ten sports columns for The Daily. This quali
fies me, I hope, as an official Grumpy Old
Man.
As such, 1 read Daniel Novinson's column
today ["Sixth Man Shortage," Mar. 6] with
fond nostalgia. The piece is a thoughtful
lament for the fading of Stanford's culture of
fanhood and fun. 1 love this lament and its pil
lars: these freshmen, they're just so much
dorkier than us seniors were! It is probably
because of a plot by The Administration: to
destroy parties, fire the Band, ban alcohol,
close the Athletic Department and turn the
school into a teetotaling MIT.
I love this lament because it is so familiar: it
is what the Class of 2005 said about you. Class
of 2008. And the Class of 2002 said it about the
Class of 2005, and my own class, being preco
cious, said it about the Class of 2002. Some
how, though, this wailing has continued for
eleven years, and the campus remains myste
riously full of humans as opposed to the in
evitable pre-med-robot-frosh that seem to be
our destiny.
It's an easy lament to poke fun at,of course.
One might conclude over time that this march
towards dorkdom is a bit overhyped. Just pos
sibly, the lamenters might be somehow moti
vated to argue that they alone are the peak of
how cool Stanford has ever been.
1 like another way of thinking
about it. though, which Mr. Novinson
might find acceptable: Maybe even'
year's freshmen really are dorkier
than the seniors. But maybe that's
because, if we're lucky, we actually
get less dorky by being at Stanford.
Maybe all that this lamenting really
means is that.somehow,you get cool
er as you grow up. (Feel free to find
my own Old Man motivation in that
point of view.).
