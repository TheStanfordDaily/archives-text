## Conflicts of interest and The Daily 
### 
At a university like Stanford, full of en
gaged students who are involved in a
range of activities, it's not surprising
that students who work for the campus paper
are going to have some conflicts of interest.
This poses a challenge for The Daily, which has
an obligation to present objective, unbiased
reporting. Unfortunately, there have been a
few recent cases where articles have been
published that give the appearance at least of
a conflict of interest.
On February 11, Mohammad Ali, a con
tributing writer for The Daily, wrote an article
for the news section about a speech given by

University of Michigan Islamic Studies Pro
fessor Sherman Jackson. The article outlined
the talk, which was about the role of Islamic
law in society.
Less than two weeks later, Ali wrote an op
ed ["The power of knowledge," Feb. 20] criti
cizing a previous op-ed on Islam by Michael
Lucas ("Racism and intolerance," Feb. 15].
Lucas, an adult film actor who'd recently spo
ken on campus and had drawn criticism for
racism, had defended his "disdain for Islam,"
writing that Islamic ideology is "the most
backwards and reactionary ideology on
earth."

Ali attacked Lucas for his "absurd remarks
on Islam." "What is most troubling about Mr.
Lucas's comments," he wrote,"is his failure to
differentiate between the religion of Islam it
self and the way certain communities have ap
plied it."
By itself, there's nothing wrong with the
publication of Ali'sop-edon Islam. Indeed,his
article is an example of the sort of serious, in
telligent discourse that belongs in The Daily's
opinions pages.
The problem is that the op-ed raises doubts
about Ali's objectivity in writing the
earlier news article about Islam. Even
if he was able to compartmentalize his
own views, his article gives the ap
pearance of a conflict of interest.
Ali didn't respond to multiple re
quests for comment. Editor-in-chief
Julie Klein told me that Ali had told
her that he wasn't a member of
MSAN, the group that sponsored the
talk, and he said that he didn't think
there was a conflict of interest. That

certainly would have been more egre
gious, but simply writing an opinions
piece so shortly thereafter on a close
ly related issue is enough, 1 think, to
give the appearance of a conflict of in
terest.
Another example of apparent
conflicts of interest occurred in The
Daily's political reporting. I've en
joyed The Daily's coverage of the
2008 presidential election, especially
the collection of articles on the Cali
fornia primary earlier in February.
In particular. Nick Parker and
Patrick Fitzgerald — both former ed
itors-in-chief of The Daily — have
written excellent articles on aspects of
the election over the past month.

They were also publicly listed as being
members of the official Stanford
Barack Obama Facebook group.
Fitzgerald and Parker both told
me that, beyond joining the Facebook
group, they have not done any cam
paigning for Obama. Both acknowl
edged that their group membership
could be interpreted as suggesting a
conflict of interest but stood by their
reporting as fair and unbiased. I'm
not at all questioning the quality of
their articles, which certainly seemed
balanced and fair. But a public display
of support for a presidential candi
date gives the appearance of a conflict
of interest that is best avoided.
In both of these cases, the crucial
distinction is between journalists'
private beliefs and their public
stances. It's inevitable that engaged,
intelligent journalists will develop
their own personal views on the is
sues they cover, but it's their job to
compartmentalize and keep these bi
ases from their writing. To the extent
possible, however, it's best if journal
ists avoid writing on issues where
they have strong personal views. In
particular, if a journalist feels strong
ly enough to make public statements

of their own political views on the
topic, it's hard for readers not to
question whether their news stories
are impartial.
Thus, it's generally considered ac
ceptable for journalists to vote pri
vately in elections. The New York
Times' very stringent ethics manual,
for example, acknowledges journal
ists' right to be "responsible citizens"
and "to take part in community af
fairs." But any public display of polit
ical action, according to the Times'
policy, such as signing petitions or
campaigning, is inappropriate for
someone covering political issues.
This raises an interesting dilem
ma for Daily writers as ASSU elec
tions come around. Certainly, it's ap
propriate for writers and editors to
vote in the elections,and it's inappro
priate for writers and editors to pub
licly campaign for or support candi
dates or student groups on whom
they might report. (This would in
clude, 1 think, joining Facebook
groups of support or forwarding
along campaign emails.) But what
about signing ASSU petitions? Is
this like a private vote, or is it a pub
lic display of support? According to

elections commissioner Ryan
Woessner, signatories of petitions
are private this year, though they
were public in the past when they
were on paper and in the future may
be public as well. So for this year at
least.it is perhaps alright for journal
ists to sign ASSU petitions —
though whenever there is an ambigu
ity, it's best for journalists to err on
the side of avoiding any appearance
of partiality.
Currently, The Daily puts almost
all of the burden of trust on the writ
ers. It's up to writers to reveal any po
tential conflicts of interest before ac
cepting a story assignment. 1 think
that a more proactive approach is de
sirable.
It would be hard for The Daily to
police against mendacious writers
who knowingly try to write news sto
ries where they have serious conflicts
of interest. But most of these situa
tions, 1 imagine, are accidental, and
the writer might not even realize that
there's a potential conflict of inter
est. One solution would be to ask
every Daily news writer to give a list
of topics where they might have a
conflict of interest — public campus

figures whom they know well per
sonally (e.g.. ASSU candidates), stu
dent groups in which they're in
volved, political stances they've
made public in publications or on
Facebook. Then, before assigning an
article to writers, editors could ask
explicitly if there was any potential
conflict of interest. Simply the act of
writing down areas where they may
have conflicts might be a good exer
cise for writers and might make them
aware of potential conflicts they had
n't previously realized.
it's natural for people to overesti
mate their ability to remain impar
tial. Even when they can remain im
partial, the mere appearance of par
tiality is damaging. It's thus best to
err on the side of caution and to have
institutional safeguards in place to
prevent well-intentioned writers
from creating the appearance of con
flicts of interest.
