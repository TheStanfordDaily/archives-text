## Conflicts of interest and The Daily 
### 
At a university like Stanford, full of en
gaged students who are involved in a
range of activities, it's not surprising
that students who work for the campus paper
are going to have some conflicts of interest.
This poses a challenge for The Daily, which has
an obligation to present objective, unbiased
reporting. Unfortunately, there have been a
few recent cases where articles have been
published that give the appearance at least of
a conflict of interest.
On February 11, Mohammad Ali, a con
tributing writer for The Daily, wrote an article
for the news section about a speech given by

University of Michigan Islamic Studies Pro
fessor Sherman Jackson. The article outlined
the talk, which was about the role of Islamic
law in society.
Less than two weeks later, Ali wrote an op
ed ["The power of knowledge," Feb. 20] criti
cizing a previous op-ed on Islam by Michael
Lucas ("Racism and intolerance," Feb. 15].
Lucas, an adult film actor who'd recently spo
ken on campus and had drawn criticism for
racism, had defended his "disdain for Islam,"
writing that Islamic ideology is "the most
backwards and reactionary ideology on
earth."

Ali attacked Lucas for his "absurd remarks
on Islam." "What is most troubling about Mr.
Lucas's comments," he wrote,"is his failure to
differentiate between the religion of Islam it
self and the way certain communities have ap
plied it."
By itself, there's nothing wrong with the
publication of Ali'sop-edon Islam. Indeed,his
article is an example of the sort of serious, in
telligent discourse that belongs in The Daily's
opinions pages.
The problem is that the op-ed raises doubts
