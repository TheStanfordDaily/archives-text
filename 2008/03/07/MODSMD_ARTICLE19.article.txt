## College rankings survey denounced Director of Admission criticizes Princeton Review 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
When prospective members of
the class of 2013 look at the
Princeton Review's 2008 college
rankings, Stanford's top 10 finish in
the categories of "Happiest
Students," "Diverse Student
Population" and "Toughest to Get
Into" might sway their application
decisions. But what applicants may
not know is just how those rankings
are generated.
Director of Admission Shawn
Abbott denounced the rankings,
which are calculated from surveys
completed by a self-selected group of
a few hundred Stanford students.
Students can fill out surveys online
or in person. According to Robert
Franek, author of Princeton Review's
"Best 366 Colleges," 95 percent of
survey responses come in online.
Methods for soliciting in-person
responses vary across schools. Abbott
said that students and staff members
volunteered for several days earlier
this winter, hosting tables in Tresidder
Union, where students passing by
could fill out the paper surveys.
Approximately 130 paper surveys
were received. In combination with
the expected online survey yield,
Franek said he was confident that
Stanford's survey returns would be
"well within [Princeton Review's]

average" of 350 responses per school.
In addition to working with school
administrators to set up a survey dis
tribution table on campus, Franek
said that he works closely with cam
pus contacts to send the survey link to
as many undergraduates as possible.
At Stanford, however, no addi
tional outreach was made to secure
responses.
"Honestly, we don't really
endorse the services or products of
the Princeton Review," Abbott said
in an email to The Daily, citing the
company's for-profit incentives.
"We only reluctantly participated
in their survey because, regardless of
our participation, they informed us
that Stanford would be included in
their next guidebook," Abbott con
tinued. "Rather than have Stanford
misrepresented with either outdated
information or factually incorrect
information, we wanted to at least
provide them with accurate perspec
tives from Stanford students."
Although the pool of students
may be self-selected, Franek said, it is
"without question representative" of
the student body as a whole.
There have, however, been prob
lems with bias in the past. Several
years ago. according to Franek,
Macalester College asked a student
religious group to complete its sur
veys following a high ranking in the
category "Students Ignore God on a
Regular Basis."
"We made very clear that this was
not what we were interested in."
Franek said. "We disregarded all the
surveys from that sample and then

resurveyed all students."
At the University of
Pennsylvania, administrators sent the
survey link earlier this school year to
members of Kite and Key, a group of
students who volunteer as tour
guides and participate in other out
reach efforts.
Even this slight targeting. Franek
said, goes directly against the sur
vey's mission.
"There's not an agreement that
colleges would sign, but we are very
clear, perfectly clear in my mind, as to
what kind of responses we're looking
for," he said. "Allowing a school to
simply hand out surveys to a cross
section of students whom they
choose doesn't seem fair to me."
Franek said the survey results
were "absolutely accurate."
"They are accurate because they
are not the opinion of me or the
Princeton Review," he said. "'lTiey're
the opinion of the 120,(XX) students
that shared their opinions with us last
year."
Abbott acknowledged the weight
that these rankings carry for prospec
tive students, but questioned their
survey methods.
"ITieir methodology is even
weaker than U.S. News & World
Report, which looks sophisticated by
comparison," Abbott said. "Ranking
colleges using categories like 'Reefer
Madness' and 'Dodgeball Targets'
just dumbs down the whole process
for everyone involved."
