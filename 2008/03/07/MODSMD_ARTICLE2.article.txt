### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the end, Stanford played its best game
of the season. But it wasn't enough against
one of the best teams in the country.
UCLA (27-3,15-2) downed the Cardinal
77-67 in overtime to clinch its third straight
Pac-10 title, rallying from a 56-45 deficit
with 5:35 left in the second half. Bruin point
guard Darren Collison scored 24 points, l 1)
after halftime, and shooting guard Russell
Westbrook added 17 of his 19 points after
the first 20 minutes. Robin (14 points, 6-of-S
shooting) and Brook Lopez (18 points on 8-
of-22 shooting. 13 rebounds) led the way for
Stanford.
"We lost in overtime to the Pac-lOcham-

pions,"said coach Trent Johnson, who, along
with Brook Lopez, was visibly frustrated
and short-spoken in his post-game inter
view. "The players, they played well for 42
minutes but came up short."
With the game tied at 61 and seven sec
onds left in regulation, Stanford (24-5. 13-4
Pac-10) junior forward Lawrence 1 iill drove
right into the paint and banked in a running
right-handed hook off the backboard. He
looked to have either travelled or charged,
but there was no whistle on the play.
"We were methodical â€”just played
hard and executed real well." said I lill. who
called the loss one of Stanford's best games
