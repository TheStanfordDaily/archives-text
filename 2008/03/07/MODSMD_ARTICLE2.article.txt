## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the end, Stanford played its best game
of the season. But it wasn't enough against
one of the best teams in the country.
UCLA (27-3,15-2) downed the Cardinal
77-67 in overtime to clinch its third straight
Pac-10 title, rallying from a 56-45 deficit
with 5:35 left in the second half. Bruin point
guard Darren Collison scored 24 points, l 1)
after halftime, and shooting guard Russell
Westbrook added 17 of his 19 points after
the first 20 minutes. Robin (14 points, 6-of-S
shooting) and Brook Lopez (18 points on 8-
of-22 shooting. 13 rebounds) led the way for
Stanford.
"We lost in overtime to the Pac-lOcham-

pions,"said coach Trent Johnson, who, along
with Brook Lopez, was visibly frustrated
and short-spoken in his post-game inter
view. "The players, they played well for 42
minutes but came up short."
With the game tied at 61 and seven sec
onds left in regulation, Stanford (24-5. 13-4
Pac-10) junior forward Lawrence 1 iill drove
right into the paint and banked in a running
right-handed hook off the backboard. He
looked to have either travelled or charged,
but there was no whistle on the play.
"We were methodical —just played
hard and executed real well." said I lill. who
called the loss one of Stanford's best games

of the season.
Collison then drove quickly up the
left side of the court and drew the
slightest of contact on Hill with two
seconds left in regulation, in what
looked to be make-up call.
"Everyone saw the play and can
have their opinions of whether it was
body, wrist, straight-up or all ball,"
point guard Mitch Johnson said of
Hill's contact.
Collison, a 90 percent free throw
shooter on the season, made both the
free throws, and Anthony Goods air
balled a shot from halfcourt to send
the teams into overtime tied at 63.
"1 don't think we feel the pressure
got to us or we played not to lose,"
Mitch Johnson said. "Looking back,
there was no one glaring mistake.
Collison played great. The whole
team did."
The Bruins trailed 60-57 with 49
seconds left in regulation when West
brook grabbed Mbah a Moute's
missed free throw and laid-in there

bound off the glass. Brook Lopez,
fouled by Love, split his free throws
to put Stanford ahead 61-59 with 22
seconds left in regulation, but West
brook then quickly received the in
bounds pass and drew a blocking call
in the backcourt on Taj Finger.
Westbrook. a 71 percent free
throw shooter this season, nailed
both free throws — the first hitting
the back iron and arcing some five
feet in the air — to tie the game at 61-
61 with 20 seconds left in regulation.
"When Russell hit that free throw.
I was praying," Bruin coach Ben
Howland said. " ITiose were some
huge foul shots."
UCLA controlled the opening tip
and just about everything else in
overtime. After a scoreless first two
minutes of the five-minute period.
Brook Lopez countered a Luc
Richard Mbah a Moute slam dunk
with a five-foot bank in from the right
block, where he was regularly dou
ble-teamed on the evening. The con

test was tied at 65-apiece with 2:15 to
go. hut UCLA had worn Stanford
down.
"He went right in trying to draw
fouls, hut we did a real good job of
containing him," wunderkid fresh
man center Kevin Love (17 points. 10
rebounds) said of Brook Lopez.
"He's a great player, but yeah, he
probably got discouraged."
Collison missed an easy scoop but
tipped in his miss, and Mbah a Moute
stripped Goods on the other end.
Brook Lopez then blocked Love's
point-blank lay-in attempt — right to
Westbrook, who hit a five-foot run
ning lay-in to push UCLA ahead 69-
65 with 1:13 to go.
After an in-bounds pass caromed

out-of-bounds off Lawrence Hill's
leg, Stanford had to start fouling and
never threatened the Bruins again.
"We had a lot of turnovers and
loose balls and allowed a lot of sec
ond shots, but if we did that earlier in
the year, we would have lost by 20,"
Hill said, 'it didn't turn out the way
we wanted, but 1 think we're still
fine."
Down 11 with 5:35 left in the sec
ond half. Westbrook scored four
straight, then Love did the same, cut
ting Stanford's lead to 56-53 with 3:17
left in the second — setting the stage
for Westbrook and Collison.
"They're a very, very good team."
Trent Johnson said. "They made
beautiful plays defensively."
Stanford led 30-18 at the half as
UCLA shot just 7-of-22 (32 percent)
in their lowest scoring half of the sea
son. Anthony Goods scored nine on
the period for the Cardinal, and
Brook Lopez added six points and
eight rebounds.
"We were too juiced up." said
UCLA coach Ben Howland, whose
team came out ice-cold, spotting
Stanford a 12-2 lead."We took a lot of
bad shots. Stanford had something to
do with it."
But when it mattered most. Love
and the Bruins were able to shut
down Stanford's posts. Of Stanford's
28 points in the paint, 20 came in the
first half. Instead, it was Collison.
Westbrook and the Bruins making
the plays when they mattered most,
in front of 12.4(X) screaming fans at
sold-out Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford, meanwhile, now needs
to turn around quickly for an 11 a.m.
tilt at USC on deck tomorrow. The
Trojans (19-10, 10-7 Pac-10) downed
Cal (15-13, 6-11 Pac-10) 93-89 in
overtime last night.
"My focus is SC," Trent Johnson
said. "We could have won this con
test, but UCLA is a very good team."

Junior Anthony Goods contributed nine points to the Cardinal effort in L.A. last
night, but a questionable late foul call sent the game into OT where Stanford
came up short against the Bruins, who won their third straight Pac-10 title.
