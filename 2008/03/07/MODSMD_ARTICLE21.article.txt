## VOLLEYBALL Stanford set to take on southern foes No. 8 men prepare for No. 4 Long Beach State, UCSD 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK. EDITOR 
Riding a four-game winning streak, the No.
7 Stanford men's volleyball team heads south
this weekend for its last action before a break
for final exams. Awaiting the Cardinal tonight
is one of its toughest Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) opponents. No. 4 Long
Beach State, with UC-San Diego on deck to
morrow.
The Cardinal (13-6,8-6 MPSF) has moved
up in the conference and national standings
with its current streak. Stanford followed a
sweep of then-undefeated No. 2 Brigham
Young with two midweek wins over Hawaii
last week, one in five games and one in three.
The team then capped the successful week
with a dominant sweep of UC-Santa Cruz on
Saturday night.
"We are for the most part healthy and we
are using the momentum to just keep getting
better," head coach John Kosty said. "That has
been our main goal throughout the season —
to keep getting better, executing better and
siding out at a higher percentage."
The four wins mark the Cardinal's longest
winning streak of the season, and the team
seems to be hitting its stride with seven match
es remaining on its schedule before the MPSF
Tournament takes place in mid-April.
Sophomore opposite Evan Romero won
Stanford's second straight Co-MPSF Player of
the Week honor — following freshman out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin a week ago —
and was also tabbed National Player of the
Week for his performance in a pair of wins
over Hawaii.
In the two matches. Romero tallied 49 kills
and hit nearly .700 in last Thursday's sweep of
the Rainbow Warriors. He leads Stanford on
the season with 296 kills, at a pace of nearly 4.5
per game, which ranks him in the top 10 na
tionwide.
