## VOLLEYBALL Stanford set to take on southern foes No. 8 men prepare for No. 4 Long Beach State, UCSD 
### REBECCA HARLOW DESK. EDITOR 
Riding a four-game winning streak, the No.
7 Stanford men's volleyball team heads south
this weekend for its last action before a break
for final exams. Awaiting the Cardinal tonight
is one of its toughest Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) opponents. No. 4 Long
Beach State, with UC-San Diego on deck to
morrow.
The Cardinal (13-6,8-6 MPSF) has moved
up in the conference and national standings
with its current streak. Stanford followed a
sweep of then-undefeated No. 2 Brigham
Young with two midweek wins over Hawaii
last week, one in five games and one in three.
The team then capped the successful week
with a dominant sweep of UC-Santa Cruz on
Saturday night.
"We are for the most part healthy and we
are using the momentum to just keep getting
better," head coach John Kosty said. "That has
been our main goal throughout the season —
to keep getting better, executing better and
siding out at a higher percentage."
The four wins mark the Cardinal's longest
winning streak of the season, and the team
seems to be hitting its stride with seven match
es remaining on its schedule before the MPSF
Tournament takes place in mid-April.
Sophomore opposite Evan Romero won
Stanford's second straight Co-MPSF Player of
the Week honor — following freshman out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin a week ago —
and was also tabbed National Player of the
Week for his performance in a pair of wins
over Hawaii.
In the two matches. Romero tallied 49 kills
and hit nearly .700 in last Thursday's sweep of
the Rainbow Warriors. He leads Stanford on
the season with 296 kills, at a pace of nearly 4.5
per game, which ranks him in the top 10 na
tionwide.
Romero is tied with junior
middle blocker Brandon Williams
as the team's top servers, with
sophomore Kawika Shoji leading
the way in assists and digs and
Williams anchoring the Cardinal's
blocking corps.
The 49ers (14-2. 10-2) opened
their 2008 campaign with nine
straight wins before losing to No. 5
Pepperdine. They have lost only
once since, to No. 3 Cal State
Northridge.
On Wednesday. Long Beach
State swept past Pacific in three
games, behind 12 kills at a .526 clip
by senior Paul Lotman.
"They have two players, Paul
Lotman and Dean Bittner, who I
believe are both in the top three in
kills per game in the country,"
Kosty said of the 49ers. "They are
a force to be reckoned with and
that is why they are ranked where
they are.
"They are talented attackers
and we are not going to stop them,
but we need to control them and
give ourselves point-scoring op
portunities. If we can do that, I
think we have a good shot at win
ning that match."
Lotman is the top attacker for
the 49ers — and in the nation -
with 318 kills on the season and a
team-high 33 aces in only 16
matches. Dean Bittner and Dan
Alexander support Lotman on of
fense and Alexander is also the
team's top blocker with 95, an av
erage of 1.7 per game.
Tomorrow night the Cardinal
will visit UC-San Diego, the team
on the losing end of two of Stan
ford's three wins last year. At 5-13
overall and 2-11 in the MPSF, the
Tritons are again near the bottom
of the conference standings. They
did. however, sweep conference
foe No. 12 UC-Santa Barbara last
week and upset No. 6 UC-lrvine
in January.
"In their match last weekend
against UCSB. they had three
players hit over .500." Kosty said.
"So their record does not indicate
how good a team they are. They
are a talented team and I expect
them to win some more this year.

LONG BEACH STATE
(13-6,8 6 MPSF)
Long Beach, Calif.
6:00 RM.
GAME NOTES: Stanford will take on one
of the MPSF's toughest opponents
tonight when it faces Long Beach State.
The 49ers are 10-2 in the conference
and are still vying for an MPSF — by far,
the best league in the nation — crown.

That's just where the MPSF is
right now. where even [against] a
team with two wins in conference,
you have got to come to play.
Jason Spangler and Frank
Fritsch lead the Triton offense
while Gerald 1 louseman is the top
blocker. Libero Eric Leserman
leads the UCSD digging effort.
Several challenges await the
Cardinal after this weekend, not
the least of which is final exams.
These will he the last matches
Stanford plays until March 29,
when the team will visit No. 5 Pep
perdine and No. 8 Southern Cali
fornia. But it does not get much
easier from there, with rematches
against UCSD and Long Beach
followed by No. 10 UCLA and
No. 6 UC-Irvine to close out the
regular season.
"It helps us. there is no doubt
about that," Kosty said of the two
week break. "It is a very long sea
son and it is a good time for us to
reenergize mentally and physical
ly. We can take care of aches and
pains and come back strong.
"We have a big weekend at the
end of spring break at Pepperdine
and USC.That will definitely be in
the back of our minds. We have
motivation, but we need a break
to rest and heal."
