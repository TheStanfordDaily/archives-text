Austin, Texas
GAME NOTES; After sweeping perennial power
house Cal State-Fullerton last weekend, the Car
dinal had a rockier time of it on the diamond this
week, falling to No. 18 Cal in Berkeley before
tying St. Mary's through nine innings in a game
that was postponed on account of darkness.
Stanford will look to get back on track this week
end as the team travels to Austin to take on the
Longhorns before an 11 -day break from com
petition to deal with final exams.

Minnesota Twins' manager Ron Gardenhire against
Arkansas on March 5, 1978. The final score of the game
turned out to be 22-3, the first time since June 2005 that
the Longhorns posted a score over 20 runs.
The Texas bats are hot right now as.at least one player
has hit two or more doubles in a game seven times this
season. Belt has done this in three games, but Preston
Clark, Cameron Rupp.Tant Shepherd and Michael Torres
have each posted at least two doubles on at least one oc
casion. Junior Jordan Danks is also doing his part offen
sively as he has earned a perfect record in stolen bases. He
is 30-for-30 in stolen base attempts for his career and 4-
for-4 so far on the early season.
Stanford is also doing well offensively this season with
five players posting at least one homerun on the season;

among the five, junior Jason Castro, junior Cord Phelps
and freshman Zach Jones have double digit hit counts.
Phelps is also 4-for-5 in stolen bases. While the Cardinal
may be doing well offensively, the team has its hands full
with its schedule this weekend.
Stanford has had a tough start to the season, meeting
with some of the top teams in the nation. This week has
been especially hard for the Cardinal because, even
though Stanford swept the three-game series against 2007
College World series challengers Cal State-Fullerton last
weekend, Sunday's game came rii>ht down to the ninth in

ning when Jones hit a stand-up double to bring in junior
teammate Jeff Whitlow for the 6-5 win.
Tuesday, Stanford traveled to Berkeley to compete with
No. 18 California.The Bears and the Cardinal were tied 3-3
until the seventh inning when California's Brett Jackson hit
a two-RBI single with one out in the seventh inning.This hit
would win the game for the Bears as the Cardinal could not
put anything together to overcome their lead.
After two close games, Stanford traveled to St. Marv's

on Wednesday to take on the
Gaels. The team jumped out to an
early four-run lead but the Gaels
answered by scoring six runs to
make the score 6-4 going into the
ninth.The Cardinal rallied back at
the top of the ninth inning with a
solo homer by Jones. Stanford
would eventually score three runs,
but the Gaels scored one run to tie
up the game at 7-7. Unfortunately,
the game was called due to dark
ness but the Cardinal came
through in the clutch to prevent
the game from going down as a
loss.
This weekend's series with the
Longhorns should be a battle. The
expected pitching match-ups begin
today with lefthander Austin Wood
(1-1, 3.00 ERA) vs. Stanford's own
lefty, junior Jeremy Bleich (2-0,2.19
ERA). Saturday's game will feature
righthander Kenn Kasparek (1-1,
5.40 ERA) against Stanford's
righthander, senior Erik Davis (1-1,
7.88 ERA).
Stanford barely leads the all
time series against Texas with a 21 -
19-1 record. The Cardinal did,
however, win its last meeting with
the Longhorns. The first pitch to
morrow is scheduled for 4:30 p.m.
(PST) with Saturday's and Sun
day's games scheduled for 4 p.m.
anil 3 p.m., respectively.
