The seventh-ranked Stanford Softball
team (22-2) escaped an upset bid Thursday,
defeating the Campbell Camels 2-1 in its first
game of this weekend's Stanford Classic.
Senior third baseman Michelle Smith sin
gled down the left field line to bring home
junior shortstop Maddy Coon with one out in
the bottom of the seventh, breaking a 1-1 tie.
The Cardinal trailed going into the sev
enth. but following a leadoff walk drawn by
sophomore center fielder Alissa Haber and a
sacrifice bunt by senior left fielder Tricia Ag
gabao, Coon tied the game up by doubling
home Haber, setting the stage for Smith.

Smith, "Maddy did the hard part tying the
game, so 1 just went up there and tried to hit
the ball hard."
Despite another dominating perform

dinal was in danger of suffering a monumen
tal upset until the heroics of Coon and Smith.
Penna struck out 15 batters — accounting
for all but six outs — while allowing only
three hits en route to another victory, her
14th of the still young season.
The Cardinal fell behind. I -0, when Camel
left fielder Courtney Quinn homered with
two outs in the bottom of the third.
Stanford squandered multiple opportuni
ties to score as they managed only the two
runs despite getting nine hits and drawing
five bases on balls.
The Cardinal repeatedly displayed ag
gressive base running, which may have cost
the team runs earlier in the game.
Haber was caught stealing third in the
first inning, and she was also thrown out try

and Smith followed Aggabao with a single
and a walk, respectively.
Sophomore second baseman Shannon
Koplitz was also caught stealing second in
the bottom of the sixth. Immediately follow-
