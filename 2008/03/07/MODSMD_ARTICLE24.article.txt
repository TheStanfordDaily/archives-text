GAME NOTES.' Stanford will look to win its 100 th
consecutive match at home this weekend
against the Arizona schools. The Cardinal is cur
rently 8-3 on the season; the three losses on the
season are the most that the team has had in 13
years.

With a strong 5-2 victory over No.
26 William & Mary on TUesday, head
coach Lele Forood of the No. 6 Stan
ford women's tennis team earned her
200 th victory at the helm of the Cardi
nal program.
This weekend, with two home
games against No. 63 Arizona and No.
13 Arizona State, the Stanford women
can reach another milestone in victo
ries: 100 straight regular season wins
at home.
To put the number in perspective,
the Cardinal has yet to lose at home in
over nine years — its last loss com
ing to California.
In fact, adding in NCAA tour
nament victories over the years
pushes Stanford's home record to
an astounding 124-0.
"I think we all see it as a real
treat playing at home, especially
after the last few weeks we've had
playing the road," said junior Jessi
ca Nguyen. "I think we're all in our
comfort zone and that really brings
out our best games against our op
ponents. That's our biggest advan
tage playing at home — we love
it."
Today, Stanford faces the Wild
cats at 1:30 p.m. ITiough Arizona
won the 2003 Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championship, much has
changed since then.
Last year, the Cardinal disman
tled Arizona, 6-1 and 7-o.This year,
the Wildcats are 7-6, having been
blown out 6-1 against both UCLA
and Southern California.
Their lone ranked player is jun
ior Danielle Steinberg at No. 62.
"We've played them in the past
always twice a year so that it's a
great weekend for us to finish the
winter quarter with and play
against a team that is tough,"
Nguyen said. "It'll be good to start
with Arizona tomorrow and work
our way up to Arizona State, who's
had better results this season."
Indeed, Arizona State is quite
the different story.
At No. 13. the Sun Devils are
one of five Pac-10 schools in the
top-15 of the ITA rankings. Earlier
this season, Arizona State upset
UCLA. 4-3, after falling behind 3-1
earlier in the match.
"They have a very strong team
and we've had difficulty with them
in the past. But we've come out on
top." Nguyen said. "I really think
that it's a great match to finish the
weekend with."
Ilie next day. however, Arizona
State fell 4-3 to USC — yet anoth

er chapter to the Pac-10 merry-go
round this year.
ITie Wildcats are led by sopho
more Nadia Abdala at the number
one spot.
Abdala will most likely face
freshman Hilary Barte, who is cur
rently on a five-game tear through
the top players in the conference.
Barte is 13-5 on the season with
six victories against ranked oppo
nents.
Moreover, Barte has already
faced Abdala in a 6-3,6-1 victory in
the second round of the Freeman
Memorial Championships during
the fall season.
Last year, Stanford defeated the
Sun Devils 4-3 and 5-2.
On Tuesday, junior Jessica
Nguyen appeared to be near 100
percent, physically, after suffering
a wrist injury at the National Team
Indoors.
"It's better," Nguyen said of her
wrist."lt's just a matter of strength
ening it back to what it was before.
As far as my backhand and every
thing goes, I can play normally
now, which is a nice feeling coming
off a few injuries."
The two Arizona matches will
be the final home games of this
quarter as the Cardinal treks to
wards the midpoint of its season.
"Our whole team right now is
fighting off injuries." Nguyen said.
"But dead week and finals week
will give us rest and we'll be back
for spring break matches — [it's a]
pretty hectic time. People are a bit
tired, but for the most part the
team is in good shape. And that can
only mean good things for spring
quarter matches."
With a winning streak on the
line. Stanford will count on its sev
enth man or woman on the court.
"We definitely love playing at
home because our fans come out to
support us," Nguyen said. "I'm
hoping this weekend that it'll be
sunny and beautiful so that people
come out, get a tan and watch us
win. It's always fun to have our
crowd cheering for us."
