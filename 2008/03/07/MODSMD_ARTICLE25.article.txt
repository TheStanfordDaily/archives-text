freshmen have gained valuable experience and
are continually improving. Ryan Lieberman '11.
alter a strong meet last weekend at Michigan, was
named MPSF Gymnast of the Week.
Lieberman called it "a great honor."The fresh
man standout was able to bounce back from a
poor first event to win parallel bars and put up
good scores on rings and high bar. Apparently, the
kids are buying into head coach Thom Glielmi's

program.
"Thom always tells us to keep your composure
throughout the meet," Lieberman said. "In be
tween events, you've got to forget about what just
happened and focus on the next event."
After only managing to score 346.750 in their
first meeting at C'al. the Stanford team has aver

This weekend, however, will likely prove a
tougher test for the Stanford men. California is a
dangerous team with some depth, and the Bears
have the confidence of having already beaten the
top-ranked Cardinal this year. Despite Cal's early
season struggles, senior co-captain Dylan Carney
made it clear that the Stanford men would not un
derestimate the Bears.
"Cal has a lot of talent and lots of potential," he
said.
"When [Cal] hits, they are as good as anyone in
the NCAA." I larper added."We are going to need
four hits per event to win."
California seniors Tim McNeil and Colin Christ
lead a team that is motivated to avenge losses to
Stanford at the Pacific Coast Classic and Stanford
Open. McNeil is the reigning NCAA champion on
pommel horse and parallel bars. But Lieberman
and his teammates feel ready for the challenge.
"I'm excited," Lieberman said. "Cal is one of
