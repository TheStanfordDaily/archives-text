# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## No. 1 Bruins loom in SoCal swing 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I"he Stanford women's water polo team
will travel to Southern California this week
end. where they will play four games in three
days. And while each match on this road trip is
technically worth the same on the stat sheet,
there is one game in particular that clearly
stands above the rest in importance: a rematch
with the No. 1 UCLA Bruins.
Two weeks ago. No. 2 Stanford fell to the
undefeated Bruins in the championship game
of the Irvine Invitational. Yet it was not mere
ly the loss, hut also the manner of the defeat,
that particularly stung and has the Cardinal
itching for a rematch. After six periods of
neck-and-neck play, the game went into sud
den death, where UCLA was able to score for
an 8-7 victory
As tough as the loss was to swallow, it filled
the Stanford women with confidence that

they were just as good as the much-lauded
Bruins. With a chance for vengeance on Satur
day, the whole team is excited.
"No other team has played them as close as
we played them two weeks ago," said junior
I leather West. "(Tjhat loss only gave us more
energy and desire, which has been showing in
practice."
"It would be a huge success for our team if
we could beat them in their home pool,"
added junior Kira Hillman.
Because the Cardinal played so well
against UCLA at their last meeting, Stanford
coach John Tanner does not believe that a
change in game plan is necessary to pull out a
victory.
"We don't change much what we do tacti
cally," he said."We'll spend the week trying to
improve in every phase of our play."
No matter what the outcome is, the match
up is such to be exciting as No. 1 and No. 2 get
set to collide once again.

"Any time the top ranked teams in the na

thing we have on Saturday."
