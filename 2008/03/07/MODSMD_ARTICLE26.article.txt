# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## No. 1 Bruins loom in SoCal swing 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I"he Stanford women's water polo team
will travel to Southern California this week
end. where they will play four games in three
days. And while each match on this road trip is
technically worth the same on the stat sheet,
there is one game in particular that clearly
stands above the rest in importance: a rematch
with the No. 1 UCLA Bruins.
Two weeks ago. No. 2 Stanford fell to the
undefeated Bruins in the championship game
of the Irvine Invitational. Yet it was not mere
ly the loss, hut also the manner of the defeat,
that particularly stung and has the Cardinal
itching for a rematch. After six periods of
neck-and-neck play, the game went into sud
den death, where UCLA was able to score for
an 8-7 victory
As tough as the loss was to swallow, it filled
the Stanford women with confidence that

they were just as good as the much-lauded
Bruins. With a chance for vengeance on Satur
day, the whole team is excited.
"No other team has played them as close as
we played them two weeks ago," said junior
I leather West. "(Tjhat loss only gave us more
energy and desire, which has been showing in
practice."
"It would be a huge success for our team if
we could beat them in their home pool,"
added junior Kira Hillman.
Because the Cardinal played so well
against UCLA at their last meeting, Stanford
coach John Tanner does not believe that a
change in game plan is necessary to pull out a
victory.
"We don't change much what we do tacti
cally," he said."We'll spend the week trying to
improve in every phase of our play."
No matter what the outcome is, the match
up is such to be exciting as No. 1 and No. 2 get
set to collide once again.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
UP NEXT
UC-SANTA BARBARA
Santa Barbara, Calif.
4:00 p.m.

GAME NOltS: No. 2 Stanford, 11 -2 on the year, will face
No. 1 UCLA on Saturday. It will be a rematch of the last
teams' meeting, when the Bruins beat the Cardinal 8-7
in double overtime. On Sunday, Stanford will take on
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.
"Any time the top ranked teams in the na
tion face off, it is sure to be an exciting match,"
West said. "I know we will be bringing every
thing we have on Saturday."
Not that Stanford won't be bringing every
thing against their other opponents this week
end as well.The team takes on UC'-Santa Bar
bara on Friday, and on Sunday they have a
douhle-header, facing Pomona-
Pitzer in the morning and then
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in the af
ternoon.
Santa Barbara, No. 17 in the na
tion, started the year very well. They
were perfect after four games, in
cluding wins over a pair of ranked
teams in 1 lartwick College and UC-
I )avis But the wheels fell off lor the
Gauchos as they proceeded to lose
nine games in a row. ITieir most re
cent loss was a 12-0 drubbing by
UCLA last weekend. While that cer
tainly cannot leave morale very high
in the UCSB camp, the Gauchos
know that a victory against No. 2
Stanford would be an extremely im
portant step to salvage their season.
"Santa Barbara has several tal
ented players and generally plays
very well at home," coach Tanner
added. This makes it all the more
critical that the Cardinal not look
past them this weekend.
Stanford's Sunday opponents are
from the Claremont University Con
sortium, with the Pomona and Pitzer
Colleges forming one team and
Claremont, Harvey Mudd and
Scripps forming the other. Both
teams play in Division 111. where
Pomona-Pitzer is ranked No. 1 and
CMS is ranked No. 8.
At the time of this writing, neither
team has collected a win this season.
That fact, combined with the Cardi
nal's busy schedule this weekend,
could mean that Sunday's games will
provide a chance for Stanford to rest
some players and give others with
less game time this year a chance.
Although they will be heavy fa
vorites — and that might even be an
understatement — against the
Claremont schools. West insists that
the team's preparation will not
change. Whether Stanford is playing
a winless D-111 team or the top team
in the nation. West always insists her
team take the challenges at hand se
riously.
"We always come ready and pre
pared for each opponent we face."
