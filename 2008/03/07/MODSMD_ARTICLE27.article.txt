# Desert foes await Cardinal
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's tennis team heads to Ari
zona this weekend for two non-conference match
es. Hie No. 32 Cardinal will take on the Wildcats
today followed by a showdown in Tempe against
Arizona State on Saturday. 'ITiough Stanford is
playing two Pac-10 opponents, the matches will
not affect the Pac-10 standings of either team.
ITiough the Sun Devils and Wildcats are not
highly ranked, there are certain aspects of the road
trip that the Cardinal must take into account. The
desert generally makes for a tough road trip for
Stanford; the team will be playing matches in the
heat, at high altitudes and on tough courts.
"It's always a difficult trip every year we go
there." said head coach John Whitlinger. "It's a
great road trip that every team needs."
Freshman Alex Clayton remained the No. 2
player in the nation in the most recent ITA rank
ings released earlier this week. Junior Matt Bruch,
meanwhile, ranks in at No. 76. while sophomore
Richard Wire ranks No. 85 in the country.
Clayton leads the team with a 17-4 singles
record, followed by Wire at 14-8. Wire and fresh
man Greg Hirshman — though they play in the
No. 3 spot — are Stanford's top doubles team with
a 13-5 record this year.
Stanford is coming off a 5-2 victory over rival
California last Tuesday after a top-notch perform
ance. The Cardinal has also won the doubles point
in five straight matches and. consequently, has
taken home the trophy in four of those matches.
Last year, Stanford earned a split on the road in
Arizona, taking the match from the Wildcats be
fore falling to Arizona State.
This year. No. 26 Arizona State is a perfect 7-0.
No. 49 Andres Arango leads the Sun Devils with a
5-2 singles record on the year at the No. 2 singles
spot. The duo of Matt Brooklyn and T.J. Bellama is
currently ranked No. 31 in the nation. Brooklyn

Freshman Alex Clayton, ranked second nationally, and the No.
32 Cardinal have a pair of showdowns scheduled in the desert
this weekend against the Wildcats and Sun Devils.
and John Nanosky II are undefeated
in singles play this year at the No. 1
and No. 6 spots, respectively.
Arizona State has only beaten
Stanford twice in its history, with
one of those wins coming lest year, a
6-1 upset inTempe.
"Arizona State plays very well at
home," Whitlinger said.
No. 36 Arizona is led hy the doubles
duo of Jay Goldman and Claudio
Christen, ranked No. 48 in the na
tion. The Wildcats, meanwhile, are
currently 10-2 on the season; the No.
36 ranking is the highest for the pro
gram in three years.
"Arizona has a pretty good
team," Whitlinger said. "It's some
thing we [have to] be ready for —
don't take them for granted."
Stanford looks to continue a two
match win streak with wins against
the Arizona schools this weekend. If
the Cardinal can compete the way it
did in its recent wins against Boise
State and Cal, the team should be
able to come out of the desert with
two wins.
"I like where we are at as a team
right now," said Whitlinger."The roll
we (have] going —we [have to]
keep it going.
"A couple of wins in Arizona will
set us in the right direction."
