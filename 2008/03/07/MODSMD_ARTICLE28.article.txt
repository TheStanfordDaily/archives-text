### JOEDY McCREARY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The University of
North Carolina student body president was found
shot to death on a city street in what police said
Thursday appeared to be a random crime, stunning
the campus community who knew her well.
Thousands of students gathered silently on cam
pus to mourn Eve Marie Carson, whose body was
discovered about a mile away early Wednesday. The
22-year-old senior from Athens, Ga., had been shot
several times, including at least once in the head,
police said. Officials said there are no suspects and
no arrests have been made.
"We have lost someone whom we cherish and
love," university Chancellor James Moeser told a
massive crowd on the school's Polk Place quad.
"We're all in a state of shock."
A witness reported finding Carson's vehicle, a
blue 2005 Toyota Highlander with Georgia plates,
near the main drag through the college town about
45 minutes west of Raleigh.
Toby Rice, of Chapel Hill, told The Associated
Press his wife discovered the car and called 911.

"We saw it on the news and we heard the woman
is the president of the student body, and she goes,
'Oh my God, 1 just found the car,"' Rice said.
Lt. Kevin Gunter, spokesman for the Chapel
Hill Police Department, declined to confirm
whether police had found the car.
Carson's body was found on the street at an
intersection after neighbors reported hearing shots
about 5 a.m. Wednesday in an upscale residential
area. It was not clear why she was in the area, which
does not have student housing.
Moeser said he got a call early Thursday inform
ing him that Carson was the apparent victim.
"It was shocking," he said. "I sat down and said
Oh my God.' 1 couldn't believe this."
Police publicly identified the shooting victim as
Carson on Thursday, and police Chief Brian Curran
said her death appeared to be a random act.
"There is nothing to link this to anyone on this
campus," Moeser said. "We don't want to overre
act."
On campus, students passed out daisies and car
nations, and large boards were erected for students
to leave written memories. An evening candlelight
vigil was planned.
