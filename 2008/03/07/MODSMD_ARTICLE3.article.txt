# Women's Pac-10Tournament
## True test awaits Cardinal Stanford women on their way to San Jose 
### HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's basketball won the Pac-10 regu
lar season title outright for the eighth consecutive
time with a 74-52 win over Washington State on Sun
day. What does that mean for the Cardinal now? Al
most nothing, beyond its contribution to securing
Stanford's place as the conference's top seed and the
scant addition to the team's confidence and momen
tum.
In order to claim the Pac-10's automatic bid in the
NCAA Tournament, the Cardinal (27-3, 16-2 Pac-10)
must extend its winning streak by another three
games.
Stanford shifts into tournament mode with this
weekend's Pac-10 Championships just down the road
in San Jose. After skating through the end of the regu
lar season without a loss in the final 15 games.the team
hopes to find similar success this weekend and
throughout March.

stretch of the season.
"We're definitely excited," Wig
gins said. "I mean, it's certainly bit
tersweet, but 1 think we're playing
well and we're all excited. Especial
ly coming off a few wins |and| the
close game with Cal. we've got a lot
of confidence going in."
The Pac-10 Tournament begins
Friday evening with match-ups be
tween Oregon and Washington
State and Oregon State (11 -18.4-14
Pac-10) and Arizona (10-19, 4-14
Pac-10). Stanford will face the win
ner of this second game on Satur
day at 5 p.m. in HP Pavilion.
While neither the Beavers nor
the Wildcats presented much of a
challenge in the Cardinal's sweeps
of both teams, both have the per
sonnel to test Stanford. Key guards
Ashley Allen (Oregon State) and
Ashley Whisonant (Arizona) are
the scoring leaders for their respec
tive teams.
But the Beavers and Wildcats
are not without strong presences in
the paint, thanks to Oregon State's
Tiffany Ducker and Arizona's duo
of Aniina Njonkou and Ify Ibekwe.
Stanford further acknowledges that
seeds can mean very little, as the
tournament stage often casts oppo
nents in another light.
Coach Tara VanDerveer said
that the team can feel the heat of
the chase and by no means consid
ers itself invulnerable.
"1 think our team is very confi
dent but not overconfident," Van-
Derveer observed. "We lost to USC
and UCLA, but we didn't finish
strong against Oregon State or Ari
zona. And we had a two-point game
with [second-seeded] Cal. We know
we have to play well. All season
long, once we lost, we played with
our backs against the wall and that's
how we'll have to continue to play."
VanDerveer also noted that the
tournament's one-and-done setup
presents an added challenge for the
Cardinal.
"It is different when you play
three games in three games," she
said. "1 think it really challenges
your depth. We're going to need
more people to step up and help us.
I think it's going to be really impor
tant for some of our people coming
off the bench ... to really be able
to contribute."
Threats to the throne:
No. 2-seed California (24-5, 15-3
Pac-10):
As public enemy number one,
the Bears pose the most obvious
obstacle for Stanford. In the Feb.
23 meeting between the two, the
Cardinal barely survived with a 60-
58 victory. Cal forward Ashley
Walker runs the show with 15.6
points per game and 9.5 rebounds,
but talent runs deep to include fel
low forward Devanei Hampton
(13.7 ppg, 7.9 rpg) and guard Alex
is Gray-Lawson (11.9 ppg, 80 as
sists). If her team advances to the

finals, VanDerveer would not he
surprised to face the Blue and
Gold.
"Everyone's really good and
everyone's very capable," she said.
"But you know [that with] the two
best teams, ourselves and Cal, it
could come down to a rematch —
kind of a rubber match, with that
one."
No. 3-seed Arizona State (20-9,
14-4 Pac-10)
The Sun Devils have proven
their strength throughout the sea
son, playing Stanford to a four
point game in January. Lauren
Lacey (12.9 ppg. 5.9 rpg) and Bri
ann January (11.0 ppg) are two key
components to Arizona State's
deep roster. The Sun Devils have
nine players averaging more than
16 minutes of play in at least 26
games, allowing for a balanced of
fense; it will also help prevent their
players from becoming run down.
No. 4-seed USC (17-12. 10-8
Pac-10) and No. 5-seed UCLA (15-
14,10-8) hold the potential to make
a surprise advance. Both teams ral
lied to beat Stanford in L. A. back in
early January. The question re
mains if either can repeat its per
formance a little further from
home.
Led by Nadia Parker (USC) and
Lindsey Pluimer (UCLA), the
Southern California rivals will get
fired up early, meeting each other in
the opening round of play. Though
both have the talent to break into
the Pac-10's top tier. VanDerveer
noted that USC will especially ben
efit from its style of play.
"There are some teams that have
been playing a style all season long
that favors them," she said. "A team
like USC that plays 10 or 11 people
every game, that might be to their
advantage if they're in the third
game because people won't be as
tired."
Fatigue and skill aside, the Pac
lOTournament will serve as a test of
every team's desire to extend its
March. Wiggins, though, says the
Card will be careful not to look too
far into the future.
"At this point, you have a [long
term] goal in the back of your mind,
but you have to focus on one game
at a time because looking forward is
what gets you eliminated early, like
we did last year," she said. "So you
can't look too far ahead, you have
to focus on what's in front of you.
and 1 think our team knows that."

of Aniina Njonkou and Ify Ibekwe.
Stanford further acknowledges that
seeds can mean very little, as the
tournament stage often casts oppo
nents in another light.
Coach Tara VanDerveer said
that the team can feel the heat of
the chase and by no means consid
ers itself invulnerable.
"1 think our team is very confi
dent but not overconfident," Van-
Derveer observed. "We lost to USC
and UCLA, but we didn't finish
strong against Oregon State or Ari
zona. And we had a two-point game
with [second-seeded] Cal. We know
we have to play well. All season
long, once we lost, we played with
our backs against the wall and that's
how we'll have to continue to play."
VanDerveer also noted that the
tournament's one-and-done setup
presents an added challenge for the
Cardinal.
"It is different when you play
three games in three games," she
said. "1 think it really challenges
your depth. We're going to need
more people to step up and help us.
I think it's going to be really impor
tant for some of our people coming
off the bench ... to really be able
to contribute."

surprised to face the Blue and

"Everyone's really good and
everyone's very capable," she said.
"But you know [that with] the two
best teams, ourselves and Cal, it
could come down to a rematch —
kind of a rubber match, with that
one."
No. 3-seed Arizona State (20-9,
14-4 Pac-10)
The Sun Devils have proven
their strength throughout the sea
son, playing Stanford to a four
point game in January. Lauren
Lacey (12.9 ppg. 5.9 rpg) and Bri
ann January (11.0 ppg) are two key
components to Arizona State's
deep roster. The Sun Devils have
nine players averaging more than
16 minutes of play in at least 26
games, allowing for a balanced of
fense; it will also help prevent their
players from becoming run down.
No. 4-seed USC (17-12. 10-8
Pac-10) and No. 5-seed UCLA (15-
14,10-8) hold the potential to make
a surprise advance. Both teams ral
lied to beat Stanford in L. A. back in
early January. The question re
mains if either can repeat its per
formance a little further from
home.
Led by Nadia Parker (USC) and
Lindsey Pluimer (UCLA), the
Southern California rivals will get
fired up early, meeting each other in
the opening round of play. Though
both have the talent to break into
the Pac-10's top tier. VanDerveer
noted that USC will especially ben
efit from its style of play.
"There are some teams that have
been playing a style all season long
that favors them," she said. "A team
like USC that plays 10 or 11 people
every game, that might be to their
advantage if they're in the third
game because people won't be as
tired."
Fatigue and skill aside, the Pac
lOTournament will serve as a test of
every team's desire to extend its
March. Wiggins, though, says the
Card will be careful not to look too
far into the future.
"At this point, you have a [long
term] goal in the back of your mind,
but you have to focus on one game
at a time because looking forward is
what gets you eliminated early, like
we did last year," she said. "So you
can't look too far ahead, you have
to focus on what's in front of you.
and 1 think our team knows that."

Stanford women's basketball won the Pac-10 regu
lar season title outright for the eighth consecutive
time with a 74-52 win over Washington State on Sun
day. What does that mean for the Cardinal now? Al
most nothing, beyond its contribution to securing
Stanford's place as the conference's top seed and the
scant addition to the team's confidence and momen
tum.
In order to claim the Pac-10's automatic bid in the
NCAA Tournament, the Cardinal (27-3, 16-2 Pac-10)
must extend its winning streak by another three
games.
Stanford shifts into tournament mode with this
weekend's Pac-10 Championships just down the road
in San Jose. After skating through the end of the regu
lar season without a loss in the final 15 games.the team
hopes to find similar success this weekend and
throughout March.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins, the conference's
leading scorer with l l ).4 points per game, said she and
her teammates were looking forward to the last

well and we're all excited. Especial

The Pac-10 Tournament begins
Friday evening with match-ups be
tween Oregon and Washington
State and Oregon State (11 -18.4-14
Pac-10) and Arizona (10-19, 4-14
Pac-10). Stanford will face the win
ner of this second game on Satur
day at 5 p.m. in HP Pavilion.
While neither the Beavers nor
the Wildcats presented much of a
challenge in the Cardinal's sweeps
of both teams, both have the per
sonnel to test Stanford. Key guards
Ashley Allen (Oregon State) and
Ashley Whisonant (Arizona) are
the scoring leaders for their respec
