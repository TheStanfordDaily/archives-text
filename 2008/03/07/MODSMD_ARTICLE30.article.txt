## Dean urges do-overs in two states 
### JOAN LOWY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — The former
head of the Democratic National
Committee doubted Thursday
whether chairman Howard Dean
would be able to get approval for
do-over presidential nomination
contests in Florida and Michigan.
"It'll be a hellacious battle," said
Don Fowler, a former DNC chair
man who sits on the party's rule
making committee.
Before the primaries started,
"Howard Dean had enough votes to
get most everything he wanted. Now
that this thing has gone as far as it
has and the lines have formed
according to candidates, I'm not
sure how that vote would shake out
now," said Fowler, who has endorsed
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Nonetheless, Fowler said, some
thing has to be done, "the rules be

damned," to seat delegates from
states Democrats have to and can
win in the general election. "We're
going to forfeit those two big states?
What kind of fools would we be," he
said.
Officials in Michigan and Florida
have shown renewed interest in
holding repeat nominating contests,
and Dean has urged party officials
in both states to come up with plans
for how that can be done so their
delegates can be counted at the
national convention in late August.
"All they have to do is come
before us with rules that fit into
what they agreed to a year and a
half ago. and then they'll be seated."
Dean said Thursday during inter
views on network and cable TV
news programs.
Dean said the parties will have
to pay for new contests.
"We can't afford to do that.
That's not our problem. We need

our money to win the presidential
race," he said. The DNC offered to
pay for an alternative contest in
Florida last summer but was turned
down, officials at the party say.
Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida,
another of Clinton's supporters, also
called for a new Florida primary, but
paid for by the national party.
Nelson and Dean spoke by tele
phone Thursday evening and Dean
reiterated that the DNC will not pay
lor a new primary.
Cost may be a barrier. During a
meeting Wednesday night among
House Democrats from Florida and
Michigan, Rep. Alcee Hastings of
Florida relayed estimates that
another primary would cost the
state between $22 million and $24
million, a vote-by-mail contest
would cost at least $8 million and
the bill for a caucus would be about
$4 million, said 1 lastings spokesman
David Goldenberg.
In Michigan, the cost could be as
high as $10 million, depending on
the type of contest, according to
Democratic officials. Liz Boyd, a
spokeswoman for Democratic
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm,
said Thursday evening that nothing
had been ruled out but it was begin
ning to appear as if the cost and
logistics may be insurmountable.
Republican Florida Gov. Charlie
Crist said Thursday he would sign a
bill for a new Democratic primary
— legislative approval is required
— but only if it was a last resort and
only if the national party pays for it.
But that seems unlikely, given
Dean's insistence that he won't pay.
Top officials in Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign and Florida's
state party chair all now say they
would consider holding a sort of do
over contest by June. Officials in
both states previously had insisted
that the primaries held in January
should determine how their dele
gates are allocated.
Clinton said she'd wait to see
what proposals are put forward.
