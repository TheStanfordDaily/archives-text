Happy International Women's Day!
Ladies, give yourselves a bonbon and a pat on the back for being so damn spectacular.
Gentlemen, I know you're just recovering from V-Day, but tomorrow, March 8, is Women's
Day, a holiday meant to celebrate your mom, sister, girlfriend, thesis advisor — all the
ladies who make life worth living. And who, between February 13th and May 11th this year
(google it!), are responsible for that not-so-fresh feeling in your wallet.
International Women's Day is a bogus made-up Soviet holiday about which, as a bogus
made-up Slavicist, I feel very strongly. A quick, offensive and absurdly reductive explana
tion: it was first celebrated in the US as a commemoration of and (oops!) quasi-apology for
the 140 women who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire fiasco. It hit its greatest
stride under Lenin, though, when he established it as an official Soviet holiday to encour
age Russian men to take a day off of boozin' and beatin' to go make more Soviet babies
with their honored spouses. Now it's just an excuse to remember her jewelry size.
Or at least send a friggin' e-card. Come on, dudes. A few celebration ideas for those of you
who didn't have the forethought to prepare:
There are the classics, of course. Mom would love a phone call any day of the week, not
just Women's Day, and hand-written cards are a welcome and genteel show of manners.
And of course flowers or chocolates (or chocolate-chip cookies from Martha's Bakery next
to Secret Safeway, hint hint) are never a bad call.

But if you have the chance to celebrate in person, why not mix a few of your favorite girls a
batch of drinks nearly as sweet as they are. I'd recommend a pitcher of Passion Fruit
Caipiroskas. Borrow, buy or steal a pitcher and add: 6 oz. lime juice (fresh!), 6 oz. granulat
ed white sugar, 6 oz. passion fruit puree (you should buy it frozen at Whole Foods, but
Finest Call makes a cheap bottled version — I can keep a secret) and 9 oz. vodka. Mix
until the sugar dissolves and pour into glasses heaped with crushed ice. If your passion
doesn't make her swoon, at least your passion fruit will.
If icy hooch isn't right for the occasion, your other tried and true is heartfelt poetry. For the
uncreative, an acrostic might do the trick (GRANDMA: "G" is for Great, "R" is for Really, "A"
is for Ancient...), but I'd recommend a more daring form. Villainelles, sestinas, sonnets —
all set the stage for greatness. My favorite form, however, is the dashing limerick.
If I may, a poem for one of my favorite International Women:
There once was a lady named Spin,
A noble, proud and fair Finn,
Who would recite stories
Of Edward John Gory's,
While sipping a tumbler of gin.
I sincerely hope you are copying this into your poetry journal even as we speak. Happy In
ternational Women's Day, all!
