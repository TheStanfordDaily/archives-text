## Great dates in history 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION BACHELOR #3 
This week, in honor of International Women's Day, Bracke
tology celebrates the lives of 16 global icons who also happen to
have two x-chromosomes and ovaries. But which of these com
petitors helped womankind the most? Who had the greatest im
pact world history? And, perhaps most importantly — if they
were all contestants on The Bachelor, which one would I choose?
Let the war for some roses begin!
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Oprah Winfrey vs. 16. Eve
This one's closer than you think. Oprah has amassed a larger
empire than Alexander the Great, hut she used to date Roger
Ebert (seriously). On the other hand. Eve gets points for being
the world's first woman, but eating that forbidden fruit effective
ly justified misogyny for thousands of years. What to do?! Ah
screw it. let's just go with the commencement speaker.
EDGE: Oprah.
8. Susan B. Anthony vs. 9. Sacagawea
Susie B. blazed political trails. Sacagawea blazed physical
trails. But really, this match-up comes down to one essential ques
tion: whose dollar coin sucks less?
EDGE: Sacagawea.
5. Cleopatra vs. 12. Carmen Sandicgo
I don't want this to sound weird, but does it get any sexier than
Carmen Sandiego? She's so saucy. I'd totally steal the Hope Dia
mond for her if it meant getting a peek under that red fedora. And
Cleopatra, despite comin' at ya, is totally overrated. Carmen
steals a 12-5 upset.
EDGE: Carmen.
4. Amelia Earhart vs. 13. Sappho
Both women gave us important firsts. Amelia was the first fe
male to fly solo across the Atlantic, whereas Sappho basically
wrote the first porn. Again, closer than you might think. I'll take
the aviatrix over the dominatrix.

EDGE: Earhart.
3. Catherine the Great vs. 14. Mulan
Mulan will kill you, but Catherine the Great will have an affair
with you and then kill you. Talk about mysterious as the dark side
of the moon.
EDGE: Catherine.
6. Hillary Clinton vs. 11. Eleanor Roosevelt
After Tuesday's big wins, Hillary is so hot right now. Hillary.
But I can't help but feel like she's stealing Eleanor's shtick.
Eleanor pulled off the whole being-a-politically-active-first-lady
while-your-husband-philanders thing back in the '30s and '40s.
And that was before it was cool for girls to have short hair.
EDGE: Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt. (That's her full
name. Badass.)
7. Joan of Arc vs. 10. Marie Antoinette
Would anyone ever make a lame movie about Joan of Arc fea
turing an anachronistic indie soundtrack? No, of course not. She
was way too fierce. Joan destroyed England bv herself, which
Napoleon, Hitler and even Voldemort couldn't do.
EDGE: Joan.
2. Queen Elizabeth I vs. 15. Lucy
1 actually saw Lucy at a museum recently, and. for a 3.2 mil
lion-year-old Australopithecus, she's looking pretty good. I'd say
7/10. But she doesn't stand much of a chance against Queen Eliz
abeth, who beat the Spanish armada and gets an Oscar-winning
movie made about her every year. I hope Lucy doesn't take the
rejection too hard. 1 think we can still be friends.
EDGE: Elizabeth.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Oprah vs. 9. Sacagawea
Oprah got so rich she actually forgot how to pump gas. Mean
while, Sacagawea served as Lewis and Clark's GPS system for
three years. Knowledge is power.
EDGE: Sacagawea

12. Carmen Sandiego vs. 4. Amelia Earhart
A showdown of two perpetually missing women. But Carmen
can't escape the dreams of all those guys with crushes on her! (I
can't be the only one, right?)
EDGE: Carmen.
3. Catherine the Great vs. 11. Eleanor Roosevelt
Catherine just chilled in huge palaces, ordering executions and
eating borscht and stuff. That's the life for me.
• EDGE: Catherine.
7. Joan of Arc vs. 2. Queen Elizabeth I
Who won the Hundred Years' War again? That's right.
France. Suck it, Brits.
EDGE: Joan.
FINAL FOUR
9. Sacagawea vs. 12. Carmen Sandiego
I actually saw Carmen Sandiego in Finland this summer. True
story. She was probably stealing the Aurora Borealis or some
thing. If that's not the sign of a true international woman, 1 don't
know what is. And Sacagawea never works in the vending ma
chines here.
EI)GE:C armen.
3. Catherine the Great vs. 7. Joan of Arc
Joan of Arc was executed for her beliefs, which is definitely
honorable. But Catherine is rumored to have died either on the
toilet or trying to seduce a horse! 1 don't even care if that was just
someone trying to mess with me on Wikipedia — I'm still im
pressed!
EDGE: Catherine.
CHAMPIONSHIP
12. Carmen Sandiego vs. 3. Catherine the Great
Fun fact: Russia is the only country that actually cares about
International Women's Day. Therefore, Catherine gets the ben
efit of some hometown officiating, but Carmen sneaks away with
the Kremlin. A victory for both sides.
CHAMP: Catherine. MVP: Insatiability.
