### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE INTERMISSION FIRST LADY 
There is a lot of speculation about how the world would be different if a woman were president of the United States. Despite the tact
that many countries, from Ireland to Pakistan, have had women in topmost leadership positions without drastic shifts in policy for the
better or worse, people are under the impression that if a lady occupied the Oval Oflice, there d be mass chaos or mass reform.

This way of thinking is reflective of a nation which still believes that there is one way to be a woman and one way to be a man, as ii the
way the country has been run previously is "manly" and the new way, if there were to be a female president, would somehow be woman
ly.'* Perhaps under a lady leader's rules all the various ambassadors and diplomats who came to the White House (to be renamed the June(
Cleaver House or, even more fitting, the Pink House) would have to take off their shoes before entering the door. No one (1 mean, no
woman) likes dirty carpets.

Just like there has never been a female president of the United States, there has never been a female president of Stanford (which likely explains the construc
tion of such structures as Stern Hall and Meyer Library). But what would happen to Stanford if a lady were to succeed President John Hennessy?

If I were to answer that question conclusively, I'd be perpetuating the stereotype that women are a certain way and men are a certain way, something I don t
necessarily believe. So, instead, I will answer a different question: What would Stanford be like if I. a woman, were president? Many little girls dream of being the
first woman president of United States. Well, I dream of being the first woman president of Stanford. Kind of. Not really.

First thing's first — de-uglification. Yes, there are parts of Stanford that are truly beautiful — but it's also true that those parts become fewer and fewer the fur
ther one strays from the Quad. If I were president, all of the concrete and cement would have to go. White Plaza would become less of a prison yard and more ol
a park with bike paths. Additionally, any buildings built in the modern architecture period in the name of "progress" — well, they're coining down in the name of
visual appeal.
IHUM? Abolished.

As it stands now, almost every major, including English, I think, requires a student take Math 51 lor a letter grade. This obsession with linear algebra must stop
Immediately.

There's a mindset that pervades the campus that fuzzies are somehow inferior to techies — less intelligent, less hardwork
ing, all-around less legitimate students. Not true. "Operation: Fuzzies arc People, Too" is to begin immediately upon my
k succession.

I consider myself a democratic person. 1 want to represent the people. I asked Jeannette Westwood. a freshman at

I Stanford, her opinion on what should change. She named a few things but said, 1 m sure when 1 m a senioi there will
'be more things I'm irritated with." Another suggestion came from Jacob Boehm, a lreshman and candidate lor a B.A.

*in Music: "The soft serve machines need to dispense creme brulee flavored gelato." I can and will make that happen.

The food system in general is in need of great reform. There are very few eatery options on campus. There are some great
selections in the way of dining halls, but the hours are very limited. Adding some on-campus restaurants with more ex-

pensive hours would help to create a warmer, more community feel.

So, a more beautiful campus, lessening the importance of math, better food and humanities
[appreciation... Hmm. Try not to think of these as stereotypically (such an ugly word) femi-■»
Inine and, instead, as traditionally feminine. No one could call me a traditional girl, but 1M
I guess when it comes to re-making Stanford, my goals are mostly girly. I can't say that it 112
other woman were to be president of Stanlord these are the changes she d make, j
A but at least we know what might change under one woman president.
