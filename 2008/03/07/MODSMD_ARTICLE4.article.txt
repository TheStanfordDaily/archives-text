# Grads unsatisfied with stipends
## Student survey cites worries over living expenses 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Figures in a recently released 2007 GSC
survey show that many graduate students feel
they are in a financial pinch.
The survey revealed that while student
housing costs increased by 27 percent and
health insurance costs increased by 39 percent
from the 2003-2004 to 2007-200N school years,
the minimum stipend for graduate students at
Stanford increased by only 16 percent.
According to a 2008-2009 Guide for New
Graduate Students published on the regis
trar's Web site, annual total living costs for a
single graduate student fall at $21.N67 for
three quarters or $7,2<59 for one quarter.
Some graduate students also question why
the stipend levels for graduate students
increase slowly when financial aid for under
graduates has recently undergone a giant
increase.
"The University has to look at the big pic
ture when managing funds," Graduate
Student Council (GSC) Co-President George
Bloom said. "They can't arbitrarily raise
stipends. That would ultimately affect the

number of graduate students admitted."
"The funding mechanisms at Stanford are
complicated too," he added. " Hie money for
graduate stipends comes from a completely
different pot of funds than for undergraduate
financial aid."
Over 40 percent of graduate students con
sider graduate school to be a financial risk
while an even higher percentage —60 per
cent — consider finances stressful.
To cope with finances, about 23 percent of
Ph.D. students receive outside funding, while
30 percent have a non-research job, resident
assistant (RA) job or teaching assistant (TA)
position to cover their expenses.
"The annual adjustment in the minimum
RA/TA salary has tracked very closely with
the estimated living expenses for a single stu
dent living on campus." explained Ann
George, assistant dean of research and of
graduate policy, who works closely with the
Financial Aid Office to develop the annual
financial aid budget based on graduates' liv
ing expenses.
