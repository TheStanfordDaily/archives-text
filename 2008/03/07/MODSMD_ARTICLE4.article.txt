# Grads unsatisfied with stipends
## Student survey cites worries over living expenses 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Figures in a recently released 2007 GSC
survey show that many graduate students feel
they are in a financial pinch.
The survey revealed that while student
housing costs increased by 27 percent and
health insurance costs increased by 39 percent
from the 2003-2004 to 2007-200N school years,
the minimum stipend for graduate students at
Stanford increased by only 16 percent.
According to a 2008-2009 Guide for New
Graduate Students published on the regis
trar's Web site, annual total living costs for a
single graduate student fall at $21.N67 for
three quarters or $7,2<59 for one quarter.
Some graduate students also question why
the stipend levels for graduate students
increase slowly when financial aid for under
graduates has recently undergone a giant
increase.
"The University has to look at the big pic
ture when managing funds," Graduate
Student Council (GSC) Co-President George
Bloom said. "They can't arbitrarily raise
stipends. That would ultimately affect the

number of graduate students admitted."
"The funding mechanisms at Stanford are
complicated too," he added. " Hie money for
graduate stipends comes from a completely
different pot of funds than for undergraduate
financial aid."
Over 40 percent of graduate students con
sider graduate school to be a financial risk
while an even higher percentage —60 per
cent — consider finances stressful.
To cope with finances, about 23 percent of
Ph.D. students receive outside funding, while
30 percent have a non-research job, resident
assistant (RA) job or teaching assistant (TA)
position to cover their expenses.
"The annual adjustment in the minimum
RA/TA salary has tracked very closely with
the estimated living expenses for a single stu
dent living on campus." explained Ann
George, assistant dean of research and of
graduate policy, who works closely with the
Financial Aid Office to develop the annual
financial aid budget based on graduates' liv
ing expenses.
"After this salary is set. the various uradu-
ate programs use that information to
set their own stipend levels," she
added.
Under the "recommendations"
section of the GSC survey results,
the GSC suggests that "the
University re-evaluate the method
used to determine the minimum
stipend to ensure that the minimum
stipend is sufficient to cover the
basic needs of graduate students."
ITie GSC also recommends that
the University increase the availabil
ity of summer research funding for
graduate students.
Financial constraints, however,
are the tightest for international stu
dents, who constitute 35 percent of
the graduate population, according

to the GSC survey. Since interna
tional students cannot work outside
the University due to the restrictions
on their student visas, their main
source of income comes from their
graduate stipends and any RA or
TA jobs they can procure.
Some international students also
raised alternate financial concerns
such as the lack of credit history for
foreign students.
"International students don't
have a credit history when they
arrive in the United States," said
Euan Robertson, a graduate student
in Economics from England. "It
takes a year to get a social security
number and credit card. With no
credit, it's hard to get things like an
apartment."
Lan Wei, a Chinese graduate stu
dent in Electrical Engineering, says
that she supplements her stipend
with fellowships, summer jobs and
TA positions.

"These incomes can cover all the
living expenses for a single student,"
she said. "There won't be much left.
But for people who have families,
then the finances are very tight."
The University, however, does
screen graduate candidates to
ensure that they have the financial
resources to study abroad.
"In order to get their visa, the
international student has to provide
a 'Financial Resources Certification'
to Stanford." George said. "[This is)
to show that they have enough
money to pay their tuition and living
expenses as estimated by the
Financial Aid Office."
"Any student, U.S. or internation
al, with a real financial hardship can
talk with their own department or
with the Financial Aid Office about
the options for help," she said.
