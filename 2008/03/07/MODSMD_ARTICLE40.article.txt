## The 						Woman Interview 
### MELANIE REYNARD 
The woman with the pink collared shirt introduced herself as
a post-doctoral candidate, and then she added emphatically,
"And 1 identify as a heterosexual female." Her colleague, with
streaked curly hair, introduced herself to me as a budding psychi
atrist and added emphatically, "And I identify as a homosexual
female."
1 sat across from them. As they spoke, I nodded as if everything
now made sense. The lamplight was dim. The windows were pur
ple from the dusk settling outside. From the low chair, 1 lurched
forward over my knees, and my hands quivered as I gripped the
armrests.
"So, Jane, we need to know if you'd be a right fit for our Gen
der Identity group. What brings you here?" they asked.
I explained that I wanted to really understand what it is to be a
woman.
"When 1 talk about gender with men. we search each other's
eyes. There is an insinuation that if we were alone on an island,
we'd be like Adam and Eve. When I talk about womanhood with
women, we usually proclaim, 'We put on make-up for ourselves!'
and then sigh, 'Guys are idiots. I want a guy."'
"What are you like in a group setting?" they inquired. I looked
back and forth at the two of them. Isn't this a group setting? I
thought.
'Have you ever had that flustered feeling around another
woman?" one asked me.
"No," I shook my head.
"But you have with men?" they inquired.
"Yes, definitely." I recalled Max Hegedus from middle school.
Once he flicked his pencil in the air. It hit me in the face. He
leaned over for a moment, "Sorry," he said, as he picked it up. I
was grateful that it hit me, my skin steaming.

"Yes definitely. But it's been a while," 1 laughed.
My laugh was answered by silence. They froze with cold stares.
I wasn't coming out. They were disappointed.
"Do you think you would be able to relate to someone who is
coming out?" the curly-haired psychiatrist asked me.
1 imagined myself before the group, "My name is Jane. And I
identify as sexual!... Some of the tim£?"

"Yes," I said, "You can't wear a mask, but you have to weigh
the pros and cons — "
"They've already weighed the pros and cons!" the curly-haired
psychiatrist interrupted. Like a Jeopardy buzzer screaming: Er
rrrrrr!
"I am just concerned — hesitant — " the pink-shirted psy
chologist smiled widely as she chose her words carefully. "What
do you think?" she turned to her cohort.
"I am also hesitant," the other agreed. "1 feel that you would
be isolated, and cornered."
"They don't want to have to explain themselves," the curly
haired psychiatrist declared. "Everyone is questioning them.
Everyone is asking them to explain themselves. They are sick of
explaining themselves! And they just need somewhere to come
out!"

Then she remembered about me and turned to me with a smile
plastered across her face, "We're just worried you would feel cor
nered."
"How would 1 be cornered?" 1 challenged them.
Then, I was taken back to that afternoon on the corner of the
bench. Travis spread his olive-skinned arm on the backrest, in the
space in-between us. He spat his words at me: "I don't want you
to call me your boyfriend anymore."
We started walking down the hill. My head throbbed. Out of
habit, I reached my fingertips around his tricep — but then sud
denly I remembered. He was no longer mine. 1 recoiled. And then
I stood back looked at him from a distance. He trotted down the
hill, proud of his decision, as if he'd just freed himself from his last
temptation and vice. Disgusting. I felt as dirty as a whore and as
unsatisfied as a virgin.
The first man I had ever let in the shower with me. A voice in
my mind said, You're going DOWN. I tackled him. Take him
down, take him down, take him down. He lay limp and flat on the
cement. Then he looked up at me and laughed, "I'm not all the
way down yet." I stood up and brushed myself off.
"How are you feeling about that?" asked the Ph.D. candidate
in pink.
"It's not just that you would be isolated, it's that the others
would be isolated by you." the curly-haired psychiatrist said. She
pursed her lips and planted her chin on her fist. She glared at me
as if I were Marilyn Monroe.
"Why don't you chew on this for a while?" the Ph.D. candidate
in the pink said, as the corners of her lips plucked across her
cheeks in a wide grin.
" Thanks," I started to pick up my backpack in a daze. My head
throbbed. Rejection. "Thanks." Then I said automatically. "It
was nice to meet you."
I walked down the beige-carpeted hallway.
I straddled my bike. I darted into the fresh night. The past driz
zled behind me, with all its discomforts. I clenched the rubbery
handlebars. Maybe this — all of this, as I heaved my body forward
and pummeled down on the pedals — is what it is to be a woman.
