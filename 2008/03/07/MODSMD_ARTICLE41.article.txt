### MARCO HERNANDEZ INTERMISSION GOLDENBOY 
"Seventh Tree"

strikes

in acid trip for good measure.

No Goldfrapp album is complete without seemingly off-'

the-wall lyrics. If listened to only once, the CD may sound

.they've come a long way.

rand rosy — like a blissful, drug-induced high — the lyrics reveal longing and self-destruction. It's

this toying around with dark and light that permeates the album (not in an Evancscence-y way).i

Interestingly enough, it actually works without sounding merely like a high with lyrics from an angsty teen. The

end result is ethereal, earthy and desirable. A

There's something to be said about the duo itself. If we take Alison and Will, for example, we see a dif-

ferent sort of hilling from other musical acts. Take The White Stripes. I'm no expert on the brother-sister

act. but the media only ever talks about Jack White. Alison fronts Goldfrapp, physically and brand-wise.

She's not only the voice, but also the image and the person with whom everyone associates the band.,

Gregory is an integral part of the duo, yet he has a more behind-the-scenes kind of presence. Alison

represents this new kind of woman who can be easy on the eye — or gorgeous, I dare say — whilst

producing quality breakthrough work that defies the stereotypes of women in entertainment. Think

of her as the Tina Fey of music groups.

All in all. "Seventh Tree" is an album that deserves a listen. It's not what Goldfrapp's fan-

base is used to. Target might not pick up the tunes from this CD to animate their adverts, but

it's definitely a superb production that might even win Goldfrapp a brand new legion of fans.

British duo Goldfrapp's new album, "Seventh Tree," is a clear departure from (heir previous three albums.
Although the sound moves away from the lush cinematic soundscapes of "Felt Mountain" and the electron
ic disco-glam of "Supernature," this work is undeniably Goldfrapp. The new production contains 10 new
tracks, all written and composed by Will Gregory and Alison Goldfrapp.

"Seventh Tree" is distinctive both for what it is and

'what it isn't. It definitely isn't anything we've seen be-

>re. Conversely, this album brings a whole new sound

'out of the band, one much more intimate than what it has

achieved before. Think acoustic, unplugged, synthesizers and

like a concoction of pretty arrangements with the occasional

coo from Alison, the band's blonde wonder vocalist. Despite

this, the lyrics are half of the fun. "A&E," the lead single, talks
about bright Saturdays, backless gowns and pills — in other
words, a visit to the ER for drug overdose.

References in this album seem less gratuitous and obscure. For

example, "A&E" refers to a European version of the ER, "accident
iand emergency," a reference which will undoubtedly baffle audiences worldwide. Drugs, which are present in

all of Goldfrapp's works, here form part of a story line. "Ride on a White Horse" (on "Supernatural"), al-

legedly about cocaine, speaks more about being badass than anything really substantial. In this respect.

The sounds and the words are almost direct opposites of one another. Where the music is upbeat
