## Special fees deadline extended Student groups now have until Monday to gather signatures 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
After requests to extend the special fees
petition deadline in response to a glitch in the
petition Web site, the ASSIJ Elections
Commission has pushed hack the deadline to
Monday at noon. The petitioning process was
originally set to close at noon today.
Various student groups hoping to receive
special fees funding next year must first peti
tion to he placed on the ballot for the spring
election. Organizations are required to
receive a specific number of signatures vary
ing by group from 10 percent of the under
graduate population to 15 percent of the total
University population.
Several groups were still far off from reach
ing their signature quota before today's dead
line. For example, the Journal of International
Relations was about 300 signatures short yes
terday and the Queer/Straight Alliance was
missing 140.
Their frustration with the deadline
stemmed from a truncated petitioning period.
After the opening of the two-week petitioning
period on Feb. 22. the Elections Commission
realized that the link to the budgets for each
organization was malfunctioning. According
to the ASSIJ Constitution, collecting signa
tures without attaching budgets is unconstitu
tional. As a result, the Commission restarted
the petitions for every organization.
The Elections Commission then contacted
all students that had previously signed any
petitions and requested that they resign them.
Financial officers from several petitioning
groups circulated and signed another petition
in order to persuade ASSIJ Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10 to push
back the due date. Although Woessner had
initially informed all petitioning organizations
that they would not be granted an extension,
he acceded to their request.
"1 noticed there were quite a few
groups that would not be able to
reach their marks by tomorrow,"
Woessner said yesterday. "They
asked tor two and a half more days,
and 1 thought it was perfectly fine. If
they need more time, they need
more time."
Petitioning groups pushed for a
deadline extension because they
believed the malfunctioning Web
site was not under their control.
Although financial officers recog
nized the efforts of the Election
Commission to compensate for the

signatures by contacting students
again, the organizations still felt that
they had lost valuable time to collect
signatures.
"I don't like it that our groups get
seemingly punished for a glitch that
we didn't cause" Tommy Tobin '10,
business editor of the Stanford
Journal of International Relations,
said in an to The Daily. "We had
2(H) signatures that were thrown out."
A total of nine groups, including
Stanford Mock Trial, Stanford
Dance Marathon, Stanford Women
in Business and Queer/Straight
Alliance, signed the petition.
