## Senators work to digitize course readers 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students may soon he able to
access the content of course readers
online if a proposal devised by two under
graduate senators is implemented by the
University.
While the project is still in an early
stage of development. ASSI undergradu
ate senators Eugene Nho 10 and Vang
kou Khang'OS have been in talks with the
Stanford Bookstore and University
administrators to assess the feasibility of
digitizing course readers for access
through the Coursework Web site. They
hope to eliminate or greatly reducing the
need for printed copies purchased
through the Bookstore.
Nho and Khang said that their primary
aim is to reduce costs for students. Hie
cost of course readers, which contain
materials compiled from various articles
and text books, varies between courses
but is often comparable to textbook
prices.
"From our perspective, it's one of the
most effective ways to reduce costs for the
greatest number of students." Nho said.
"Most students ... buy at least one course

reader, especially [those studying]
Humßio and PoliSci."
According to Lupe Barron, a
manager at University Custom
Publishing (UCP), which manages
the printing of course readers for
the Stanford Bookstore, the high
cost is primarily due to high royalty
fees to the authors.
Nho and Khang agreed that roy
alties are the most significant costs
incurred in course reader publish
ing, but they said that there are
many available cost-reducing strate
gies using pre-existing resources. In
particular, Nho said that many
course readers contain journal arti
cles that are available through
Stanford's electronic publications
licensing system that allows stu
dents to access the data of virtually
any academic journal online. Nho
said that printing course reader arti
cles requires additional royalty pay
ments for already accessible articles.

"For example, if there is a Polisci
course reader which is 80 percent
journal articles, if they go to the
bookstore, then each student has to
pay for those journal articles," Nho
said. "If you just upload it to
Coursework, you don't have to pay
for 80 percent of the course reader
for which we already have a
license."
Khang said that gaining approval
of faculty has been essential to their
initiative and that their current
attempts have been bolstered by
approval from the Faculty Senate.
"Two years ago when the idea
came out, it was a good idea, but in
terms of having everyone on the
same page, we weren't there yet,"
Khang said. "Fortunately this year, it
seems that the faculty senate is in
for the idea."
Nho noted, however, that the
digitization initiative needs to be
easily accessible to professors.
"The Faculty Senate told us that
a lot of faculty members won't have
time to individually go over the
readings and find them in the library
and upload it themselves," Nho said.
"They would rather copy citations

in one Word document, bring it to
the bookstore and let them take
care of it."
Nho and Khang are currently in
talks with representatives of various
departments to develop a pilot pro
gram intended to determine the fea
sibility of creating a campus-wide
electronic course reader system.
"[We senators are] going to sit
down and go through all the course
readers and see how much percent
age of a given course reader is from
journal articles," Nho said.
"Depending on the result, we will
approach the appropriate depart
ment."
While Nho is optimistic, he
admitted that a fully functional sys
tem will take at least a year to
implement. Khang said that the dig
itization initiative involves many
different interests that would make
it appealing to future senators.
"This is more than just costs,"
Khang said. "It's also about sustain
ability, reducing waste, saving trees,
paper and so forth."
