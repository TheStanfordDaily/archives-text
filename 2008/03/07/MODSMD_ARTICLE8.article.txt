## Something's Fishy New study reveals dangerous levels of mercury-in some tuna sushi 
### GABRIEL JIMENEZ-MEDINA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For those not in the know, there's a new health
scare on the horizon. As if avian flu and mad
cow disease were not enough, now we must
contend with toxic fish. Move over. Jaws —
this time, it's the killer chicken of the sea: tuna.
Students who read The New York l imes may already
he aware of a recent news article entitled "High Mercury
Levels Are Found in Tuna Sushi" [Jan. 23]. According to
this article,"Recent laboratory tests found so much mer
cury' in tuna sushi from 20 Manhattan stores and restau
rants that at most of them, a regular diet of six pieces a
week would exceed the levels considered acceptable by
the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]." In fact,
mercury levels in fish from five 20 stores proved for the
EPA to take legal action to get rid of them.
Unfortunately, reports like this, which prescribe
healthful foods or condemn unhealthy ones, appear with
such regularity that it's difficult to know when to listen.
New studies appear almost daily, announcing the latest
wonder food that's going to help with that diet or even
stave off cancer. Carbs are no longer verboten, and a lit
tle wine with dinner is good for you. Don't bother asking
about butter versus margarine unless you can handle a
migraine. So is it worth listening to this new report at all?
For some students, it's a definite yes.
"1 used to eat tuna rolls almost every day for lunch, the
way 1 did all last year and last quarter," said Jenny Wolo
chow iO. "But now I've definitely changed my eating
habits."
Although Wolochow is aware that the high mercury lev
els were reported only on the East Coast,she's not taking
any chances.
"I don't know if it's valid to change my eating, but I do it
just in case," she said. "I don't think it's affected me yet,
but I'm worried about long-term effects."
Nor is tuna sushi the only concern. Canned tuna may
also contain unsafe levels of mercury.
"Mercury in fish affected my eating habits somewhat,
although not with sushi."said Max Eibbrecht'll."l used
to eat a lot of canned tuna, which is very high in mercury.
I still eat it sometimes, but I try not to have more than a
can or two a week."
While some students share these concerns, many are
ambivalent regarding the subject. During Wednesday's
Hip-Hop Sushi Nights at the Axe and Palm, many people
happily chowed down on spicy tuna rolls, recently
changed to spicy salmon rolls. Most students polled re
ported being aware of the tuna situation but did not re

gard it as a serious threat to their health

When asked if they had ever

changed their eating habits as a rc

suit of articles like the one recent

ly printed in The New York

Times, the students in atten

dance mostly responded in

the negative. In fact, most

cited health reasons as

the only reason they'd

ever changed the

way they eat

"In the past
few years,"
Janessa Nickell
'11 said she has
changed her

meat intake with

regards to "just poultry

and fish, but more for

health reasons in general, not

necessarily risks regarding dis
ease."

Others students were of a similar
bent."l tried eating vegetarian before, but

just for health reasons," said Helen Chen

'11. Although none elaborated on the mean
ing of "health reasons." it was clear that most
students considered their current eating habits
to be healthier than whatever diet they'd been
on in the past.

Of course, some students did cite food-borne dis

eases as a factor in choosing what they eat

"I definitely think I have decreased my tuna con
sumption. And I was wondering about that artificial
crab." said Sean Follmer'o9. "Also, 1 haven't eaten beef
for the last four years. Mad cow disease ... people won't
realize for another 20 years. I also don't eat gelatin any
more cause I don't know where the bones come from."
One major factor in choosing sushi or steering clear is
the myth surrounding it. Faras Fatemi '10 said that she ate
sushi, but "heard it was bad for pregnant woman to eat
mercury-containing fish." Hut according to The New
York Times, around 85 percent of seafood-related illness
es are not caused by fish at all but rather by raw mollusks
such as oysters and clams.
A 1991 study conducted by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) reports that the risk of getting sick
from eating seafood is approximately one in two million
servings (chicken is 1 in 25,000). More recently, the FDA
revealed that eating sushi may be unhealthy for moms
but that eating fish is generally good for you, thanks to

those
Omega-3 fatty
acids.

Obtaining mercury-free tuna could prove next to im
possible. Again, according to The New York Times,
roughly two-thirds of the mercury in the atmosphere is a
product of industrial sources — something that's not
likely to change anytime soon. The mercury settles into
the water and finds its way into bacteria, which makes its
way into fish and finally up to us. As yet. there's no way to
prevent it.
Stanford Dining, however, assures students that the
tuna served on campus is no cause for alarm.
"All sushi preparation and service is driven by FDA
guidelines and the materials served on campus are with
in the federal safety regulations with no record of excep
tion," said Christopher Cason, communications and
strategic initiatives manager, in a email tolTie Daily.
So there you have it. Another inconclusive verdict on
what constitutes healthv food.

"I definitely think I have decreased my tuna con
sumption. And I was wondering about that artificial
crab." said Sean Follmer'o9. "Also, 1 haven't eaten beef
for the last four years. Mad cow disease ... people won't
realize for another 20 years. I also don't eat gelatin any
more cause I don't know where the bones come from."
One major factor in choosing sushi or steering clear is
the myth surrounding it. Faras Fatemi '10 said that she ate
sushi, but "heard it was bad for pregnant woman to eat
mercury-containing fish." Hut according to The New
York Times, around 85 percent of seafood-related illness
es are not caused by fish at all but rather by raw mollusks
such as oysters and clams.
A 1991 study conducted by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) reports that the risk of getting sick
from eating seafood is approximately one in two million
servings (chicken is 1 in 25,000). More recently, the FDA
revealed that eating sushi may be unhealthy for moms
but that eating fish is generally good for you, thanks to

those
Omega-3 fatty
acids.

Obtaining mercury-free tuna could prove next to im
possible. Again, according to The New York Times,
roughly two-thirds of the mercury in the atmosphere is a
product of industrial sources — something that's not
likely to change anytime soon. The mercury settles into
the water and finds its way into bacteria, which makes its
way into fish and finally up to us. As yet. there's no way to
prevent it.
Stanford Dining, however, assures students that the
tuna served on campus is no cause for alarm.
"All sushi preparation and service is driven by FDA
guidelines and the materials served on campus are with
in the federal safety regulations with no record of excep
tion," said Christopher Cason, communications and
strategic initiatives manager, in a email tolTie Daily.
So there you have it. Another inconclusive verdict on
what constitutes healthv food.
