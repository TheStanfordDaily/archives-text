## Branner frosh poised to be Major League Baseball's next biggest hit 
### By LUKE HENESY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
J Jack McGeary '11 first threw a baseball when he was
four years old. From that point on, he progressed down
a natural path for someone with an affinity for the
sport. It starts with Little League, where elementary
schoolers run amok on a small field haphazardly play
ing something resembling what we know as "baseball".
Almost each and every one of them dreams of going on

to the major leagues. Sadly, a re
markably small quantity of these
little dreamers make it as far their
high school varsity team. Even
with a history of family athleti
cism on his side — his father
played college basketball — the
odds seemed to be stacked against
four-year-old Jack in fulfilling his
classic Little League dream.
Massachusetts, McGeary's
home state, has never been even a
half-decent breeding ground for
big league players, with only three

notable active pitchers in the majors today. Ibis only fur
ther hampered his chances.
As he continued to play as a teen, though, this dream
stayed alive.
"As far as it being a reality," he said,"l didn't think about
it until freshman year of high school."
After playing very well as a young athlete and coming
into his own as a pitcher for Roxbury Latin High School,
McGeary was selected to play on a competitive A AU (Am
ateur Athletic Union) team. His stellar performance there
allowed him to play in a league in Georgia over the summer
after his junior year of high school.
"In Georgia that summer every player got seen by a lot
of scouts," McGeary said, "If you pitch well enough, they
notice pretty quickly."
He pitched well enough to spark a lot of interest in
scouts from every major league team. As promising as this
sounded, it didn't bring him any closer to a contract.
"Everything was dependent on my spring season in
high school," McGeary said. "There was a lot of talk be
fore but none of it was important until I put up numbers
that season."

"If you pitch
well enough,
they notice pretty
quickly."

As the idea of playing well enough to sign with a Major
League team loomed in the not-so-distant future, McGeary
signed to play at Stanford during the fall of his senior year.
"Even going through the college process, it was clear
that my ultimate goal was to sign a professional contract,"
he explained. "So the Stanford coach was probably opti
mistic that I would stay but knew there was a chance I
would sign."
McGeary put up impressive numbers his senior year of
high school — 80 innings. 40 strikeouts and a 0.88 ERA.
For those unfamiliar with baseball statistics, that means he
struck out an average of two batters per inning.

McGeary was then drafted and
later signed by the Washington
Nationals, with a $1.8 million
bonus. A childhood dream be
came a serious reality.
'Ibis did mean, much to the dis
may of the Stanford coach, that
he would be ineligible to play
baseball for the Cardinal.
In an unusual turn of events,
McGeary was in such high de
mand that his contract allowed
him to go to school at Stanford

for three years, just enough time
for him to graduate if he sticks to a 20-unit-per-quarter
schedule. Looks like he won't have much trouble paying for
tuition.
When he's done with Stanford, the Nationals expect him
to head straight to Washington and begin playing.
"1 like it here. It's different because it's the first time I'm
not on a team." he said,"but 1 like my roommates and it's
fun living in Branner."
He travels to Santa Clara a few times per week to train
with their coach and is currently in the early stages of ful
filling his academic requirements to graduate three years
from now. McGeary hopes to major in Classics.
Baseball analysts confidently say that McGeary is easi
ly one of the best Major League prospects ever to come
from Massachusetts. So just how soon can you catch him on
ESPN pitching for the Nationals?
"In five years," he said,"l hope to be in Washington play
ing for the big league team."
So keep a baseball on you at all times. If you bump into
him it might be a worthwhile investment to get a signature.
