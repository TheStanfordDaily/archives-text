# Saying goodbye
## 
### SGT. WILLIAMA. TRESEDER 
It's five o'clock in the morning in a parking lot at the Del Mar
area of Camp Pendleton on January 18.2008. The sun hasn't
come out yet, it's freezing cold and the best shelter anyone can
find is the wide open canvas tent — with lukewarm watered
down coffee — that is about two degrees warmer than it is
"outside." The people who know, the ones who have done this all
before, have blankets and sit silently inside cars and SUVs with
their engines and heaters on, waiting until the last moment to exit.
The less fortunate (i.e. the least experienced) group stands around
shivering and almost hoping for the word to load up onto the buses.
Almost, but not quite. For all the movement and people around the
area, it's strangely quiet. Everyone seems painfully self-aware as
they mutedly line up seabags and military packs in long orderly
rows on the cracked pavement.
ITiese Marines are getting ready to leave for a year-long deploy-

ment to Camp Fallujah in Iraq, and if you
didn't already know, one look around you
would betray the truth. Everywhere you
look people quietly go about some menial
task, their eyes reddened and drawn, hag
gard faces betraying the recent anxiety and
sleepless nights. The muted activity of some
younger Marines reveals their inner turmoil
as they fumble with their gear, the same gear
they've handled easily hundreds of times
before.
There are families here: huge groups of
wives, husbands, children, sisters, brothers
and parents, all circled protectively around
the one deploying as if some circle of love
could ward off the impeding departure, sep
aration and danger. Some clusters are small-

er, just the spouse and children. The most common sight is a baby
or toddler held, an arm around a spouse and any other children
tucked in close to the legs and waist. The poor lighting casts deep
shadows into these little bands, blurring the lines of their clothing
and giving them the appearance of a single person.
Also present are some solo Marines, stamping their feet in the
cold ocean air or gathering in small groups to jaw about something
unimportant, trying to pass the time.They are a study in unsteady
bravado, not really sure what to expect this time "in country;" all of
them are wary, excited, exhausted and. whether they admit or not,
scared. A few exist who revel in the prospect of true combat and

stand out among their ten
tative brethren; usually
those who know what it is
— alternately boring, ex
hilarating and frightening
— don't pretend to enjoy
the experience. Most are
also unsure of their indi
vidual role in this new war,
with conflicting reports
about improved security
and anemic terrorist
groups, and this new
creeping, deadly brand of
military complacency. A

stoic face is put on by most, a courageous shell fitting snugly over
their shivering teenage bodies; its familiar feeling soothes them
and warms their hearts, temporarily convincing them they are not

afraid.
Lastly there are the couples who, with
out families or children, are easily recogniz
able. An almost unnatural intimacy sur
rounds them as they prepare for the loom
ing reality of what has been the topic of
every conversation for weeks. Barely visible
in the predawn light, they resemble a single
person, powerfully braced against the win
ter wind. The more comfortable and famil
iar they are with one another, the less is said;
the older couples just hold each other close
ly or stand side by side, looking out onto the
busy scene before them. Whether either of
them spoke a word about it or not over the
past few weeks and months, this deploy-

ment has factored into every aspect of their
lives: every loving gesture, whispered promise and tear shed. And
now the time is impossibly here; reassurance is gained through eye
contact, a hand squeeze or a soft, lingering kiss. Despite all the ac
tivity around, it's obvious how far away these pairs are, thinking
back to a shared moment or trying to absorb every aspect of the
other, holding tight to each image, memorizing the details of their
loved one's familiar face. For the more mature and thoughtful, this
impending separation is as fully comprehended as humanly possi
ble, and plans are in place for every thinkable eventuality. Others
are younger or not as strong and cannot face the bleak reality con
fronting them everywhere they turn.
Regardless of how prepared they are, the time has come: all
heavy gear is already gone and each Marine has only what he or she
can carry. After roll call, the word goes out for everyone to get on
the buses. One brief moment, shared by all, passes when not a sin
gle Marine moves. Slowly, momentum builds toward the long line
of idling buses as the exodus begins. The solo ones are the first to
go, loading up alone or with a buddy, maybe turning to take one last
look at the Pacific coast in the ghostly predawn light. A mass of
Marines forms outside each bus door as the main group gets on; a
few wives break down and drop any pretense of quiet strength they
promised to maintain. A few little children can barely be heard sob
bing gently as they are led away by older siblings. All that remains
are the senior Marines and a few stubborn couples, drawing out the
sweetly painful moment, linked together by a hug, then hands, then
fingers and finally just by their eyes. No words pass between them,
not in front of the whole group assembled now, but they nonethe
less reaffirm together an earlier promise: "Come home safely to
me."
Then the last man is loaded up by the weary leaders, a final
count is taken to ensure no one is left behind, the doors shut — a
heavy sound in clear, quiet air — and the convoy pulls out of the
parking lot, followed closely by the tearful prayers of those left be
hind.
