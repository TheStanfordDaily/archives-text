From Wellness Week to Fiat Local Week
to an entire series on the ethics of food,
Stanford offers a wide variety of
health-related events. Since its launch in Oc
tober of 2007, BeWell@Stanford (http://Be-
Well.stanford.edu) has served as an online
gathering ground for these events and for
those interested in many aspects of health.
BeWell applies the appeal of social network
ing sites like Facebook and Linkedln to
wellness. Users can create profiles and join
specific communities. Prompts encourage
users to interact, ask questions and share in
formation with other similarly interested in
dividuals. The site also allows users to set
goals and log daily results. Avid members
can even journal their progress.The BeWell
Web site uses, as one New England Journal
of Medicine article on BeWell argues, the
"network phenomena... to spread positive
health behaviors."
BeWell also reflects the growing at
tempts of large organizations to lower
healthcare costs by using positive incentives
to promote healthier lifestyles. For example,
over the past few years, IBM has paid over
$130 million to its employees in awards for
exercising and quitting smoking.
BeWell not only stands to increase Stan
ford's communal health, it also allows Stan
ford members to exchange and pass on in
formation regarding local health events. Re
cently, students used BeWell to start and
spread information about Oxygen Bar 101. a

weekly Yoga seminar in the Stanford Grad
uate Community Center.
Earlier in the academic year,
BeWell@Stanford also played an active role
in promoting the Pac-10's fitness challenge
— Stanford logged over 725,000 minutes of
physical activity in five days, eventually win
ning the inaugural challenge. Stanford's fac
ulty and staff, in fact, won their division in
absolute numbers. Despite Stanford's rela
tive small size in comparison to public state
colleges, Stanford staff topped the logged
output of other Pac-10 schools.
As opposed to only focusing on exercise
or healthy eating, Be\Vell@Stanford focuses
on wellness. For a student body that is per
haps as likely to over-exercise as it is to
under-exercise, the emphasis on wellness as
the synergy of physical, social and spiritual
health should not be undervalued.
Stanford University can take pride in its
implementation of BeWell@Stanford. Since
its launch, the site has registered roughly
8,500 users and enjoyed participation of
close to 20 percent of Stanford's entire cam
pus — remarkably high numbers. Stanford
is also the first college to employ such an in
novative wellness service. When compared
to personal trainers and support groups,
such an online community provides more
accessible support at a much reduced cost.
BeWell provides a cost-effective, positive
community for fostering wellness at Stan
ford.
