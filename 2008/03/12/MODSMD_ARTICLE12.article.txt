# Little Ms. Modern
## Eating slow and modern 
### 
Recently. I had the pleasure of enjoying
a rapturous meal at Berkeley's Chez
Panisse, a restaurant so special that it
has its own substantial, photo-enhanced
Wikipedia article (which is generally the way
1 determine legitimacy in all facets of life).
Ibe collective brain of the Internet tells me,
with an indisputably neutral point of view,
that this place is a universally loved temple to
culinary ecstasy, and after my visit my tummy
was inclined to agree.
Alice Waters, the chef behind the magic
and another object of considerable Wiki-af
fection. is famous for her emphasis on fresh,
local ingredients and her imaginative, inclu
sive incorporation of diverse cooking styles
and traditions. She is a champion of the
"Slow Food" movement, a school of thought
whose name contrasts with fast food culture
and that embodies the ideas she integrates in
her menus. I ler techniques have proven so
yummy that they've revolutionized the
American food landscape — or at least the
elite, rich-people food landscape — and her
influence is felt across the country in fancy
restaurants and overpriced organic grocery
stores.
But okay. I'll keep my classism objections
to myself for today, because (a) it's the con
sumers and not the cuisine itself with whom I
take issue and (b) I have so many other
things to opine about! Anyway, despite scan
dalous prices at Whole Foods, stocking one's
pantry with all things fresh and local can still
be an affordable venture. It just takes a will
ingness to go the farmer's market route and
be creative with what one finds there.
Ibe bigger question for me, of course, is
whether this quest for fresh-and-local-ness
would be a modern venture.The obvious an
swer seems to be negative: Alice Waters and
the related "Slow Food" movement are in di
rect opposition to the industrialized, homog
enized. globalized food culture that in some
ways epitomizes modernity. The suggestion
to conduct our eating in a local and un
processed manner seems akin to advocating
a premodern lifestyle of keeping chickens
and churning butter.
But as I often try to make clear, moderni
ty is a highly complicated (and ferocious!)
beast that is better characterized by its intrin
sic contradictions than by any particular
buzzword like "industrialized." Ibis is be
cause in the big ol' pot of modernity stew —
opposition to industrialization is as impor
tant an ingredient as industrialization itself,
and it's really the combination of the two that
produces that distinctly modern flavor. (Get
it? It's a metaphor about cooking because,
like, this article is about cooking!)
Chez Panisse and Slow Food could only
exist as they do within the context of moder
nity — while they represent an objection to
the modern status quo, they also rely on it as
a foil to which they can be the "other."Their
position of rejecting manufactured food ex
hibits a fundamental awareness of exactly
what they are rejecting. In other words, Alice
Waters' critique of the modern culinary con
dition works because it's modern itself.
Rather than denying today's world outright
and turning back to the past, her critique
presents an alternative, legitimate approach
forward.
And even if you don't care about the the

oretical implications of the way you eat. Slow
Food makes some compelling practical argu
ments that relate to serious modern prob
lems. Recent research suggests that our cur
rent reliance on highly processed foods is
bad for a lot of reasons, not unlike our re
liance on fossil fuels. In addition to its many
negative health impacts,our present industri
alized food system is unsustainable in its vo
racious consumption of land and resources.
One especially crass and dramatic example is
the shitload (two trillion pounds!) of animal
poop produced each year, much of it in high
concentrations at meat factories, that in
creasingly damages our ecosystems and
water quality.
In our enthusiasm for technology, we
often seem to miss a basic point: while our so
ciety is modern, our bodies and our natural
surroundings have not evolved at such a blis
tering pace. A recent modern revelation is
that we must be sensitive to this fact! ITiis
doesn't mean we should throw out every
thing new. Alice Waters' approach, for exam
ple, does not. While rejecting processing and
industrialization, she embraces other mod
ern developments, such as muiticulturalism,
in her mixing and reworking of traditional
cooking methods from around the world.
For me, this Slow Food movement is an
uncommon delight — it exemplifies a gen
uinely modern, constructively critical re
sponse to the way we live now. Like the best
works of modernism, it digs deep into its con
temporary setting in order to make a pro
foundly effective critique while still main
taining practical relevance and an optimistic
viewpoint. And of course, there's the food it
self. 1 doubt Le Corbusier ever dreamed that
the modern movement could be so sublime
ly delicious!

Caitlin recommends the warm chevre and
mesclun salad with every taste hud on her
tongue. Have other suggestions? Send them to
