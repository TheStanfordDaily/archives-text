## Google still rocks my world 
### 
I feel there's too much hate surrounding
our good friend Google these days. In my
mind, it seems Google has been portrayed
as an ogre-like enemy, deserving of spite. Per
haps this feeling is a product of the Silicon
Valley psyche, which champions the small
start-up over the powerful giant. But only the
best companies survive the fiercely competi
tive online world. The fact that so many con
sumers use Google should point to its popu
larity in the hearts and minds of consumers.
Right?
1 think the problem is that Google is too
good, and our expectations have been raised.
Google-like proficiency in Web search, for
example, is the standard, and most people are
now indifferent about their Google experi
ence. Hell, we've even turned the word
Google into a generic verb describing web
search (to the consternation of Google,
which could actually lose the trademark on
their name if this pervades society too
deeply). So the only thing that really makes
news these days are vaguely-articulated con
cerns about privacy, perpetuated by compa
nies' lobbying arms (as recently reported in
The New Yorker), or speculation over
whether the combination of Microsoft and
Yahoo! could successfully battle Google.
I'd like to shift the focus to the fact that
Google has been rocking our world for some
time now. and continues to do so. Does any
one even remember Web search before
Google? The experience was painful, slow
and inaccurate. The improvement Google

has contributed has probably contributed
untold billions to our economy via labor
saved in finding information and the eco
nomic benefit that greater access to informa
tion endows. Now you can find nearly any
thing in record time — which could also be to
your detriment if you have something to
hide.
Google has also shaken up the email
scene in the same way it did to Web search.
Again, think back to email before Gmail: You
were maxed out at 100 MB of storage space,
search features sucked, and the whole
process felt like a chore. Gmail. by correcting
many of those sore points, has made email as
addicting and as pain-free as possible. ITiis
beneficial effect even extended to non-
Gmail users, as competitive email services
such as Yahoo! improved their offerings in
response to the introduction of Gmail.
There are even more godsends from the
Google team. If you have used Google Schol
ar. Google Patent Search or even Google
Image, then you'll be just as devout a follow
er of Google as I am. I owe entire research
projects to Google Scholar for being able to

find the academic articles that I needed.
Google Scholar is light-years ahead of any
other academic publication search, and if it
weren't for Google Scholar, academic re
search would be significantly more painful.
Patent and image searches have been simi
larly transformed.
It might seem odd that mighty Google
needs defense. 1 lowever, because Google has
delivered so many positive changes to the
world. I feel that Google deserve more acco
lades than it currently receives. As I said,
we've grown complacent with the pleasant
online experience that Google has provided,
and when problems disappear, we take our
benefactors for granted.
'ITiere is nothing dishonorable, however,
with dishing out criticism to Google and de
fecting to other companies if Google ends up
losing its luster. Moving on to the next best
thing is what makes our economy great, and
it's this phenomenon that leads to the cre
ation of great companies like Google. The
risk of this happening to Google anytime
soon is minimal — if anything, Google will
only end up becoming more powerful. And if
it does end up engaging in monopolistic be
havior, then we should be concerned. But
you know what? I think life under a Google
monopoly would be pretty comfortable. It
would be a society pervaded with free, inno
vative and well-designed products. Sounds
all right to me...
