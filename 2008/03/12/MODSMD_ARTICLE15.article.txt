## Where has all the passion gone? 
### 
There's been a lot of talk recently about
an air of declining social excitement at
Stanford. Daniel Novinson's Mar. 6
article "Sixth Man Shortage" discussed
some of the symptoms, mainly those related
to athletic fandom, but struggles to describe
any sort of cause. He makes some sugges
tions of a possible increase in "type-A"
freshmen, and a changing attitude among
the administration. Jeff Cooper countered

in his Mar. 7 letter to the editor with the ar
gument that every senior class complains
this way. and that nothing seems to really
change much. We disagree. Stanford is
changing greatly.
Ihis change has nothing to do with a dif
ferent mix of freshman students. Stanford
kids have always been nerdy, and it's hard
for admissions to screen out the fun so
called "troublemakers." (One of the biggest

troublemakers we know graduated last year
with a Rhodes scholarship.) In fact, we ap
plaud this year's freshman class for trying
their darndest to have fun despite it all. but
something keeps getting in their way. Re
member that capture the Hag game they
tried to organize the night before NSO?The
one that was shut down?
This startling change started long before
the current administration took power, with

the ejection of Greek houses from campus.
In the last 30 years roughly two dozen
Greek organizations have been forced off
campus and seen their houses seized. The
next statement is going to get resistance
from a campus that is now overwhelmingly
anti-Greek: Fraternities and sororities are
the foundation of Stanford's social life. We
throw the most and the best parties;
we organize the best football tail
gates; we rally the most folks to
philanthropic events such as the re
cent ThinkßlG women's confer
ence; and we are among the top
contributors to community service
of all the residences on campus.
And among the Greeks, the seven
housed fraternities on campus bear
the brunt of this Atlas' burden of
propping up Stanford's social life. Is
it any surprise that your parents
have better stories about the time
they spent here? When they were
students here, they had more than
one party option on a Friday night,
cared about more than one sports
team on Saturday. And it's only get
ting worse.
What has happened to Full
Moon on the Quad and Band Run?
Events that only three years ago
were mainly student-run are now
smothered under University regu
lations, bright security lights and
dozens of police. How much spirit
or excitement can any person gen
erate, no matter how guilt-free they
may be, under bright lights and the
withering gaze of a Man of the
Law?
And what the heck happened
with Tree selection this year? The
Feb. 22 Daily article regarding Jack
Cackler's removal from Tree con

sideration claimed that the decision
was made fully by the Band, and
that the administration had nothing
to do with it. But strong rumblings
and rumors around campus indicate
otherwise. But what exactly did
Cackler do, anyway? He had man
aged to get a student population
mired in midterms excited about
being a part of something greater.
For once, people sitting in dining
halls were talking about something
besides IHUM lectures.
What is there to do about this?
Are we willing to sit back and say,
"nothing is really changing that
much." as self-described "Grump>
Old Man" Cooper suggested in his
Mar. 7 letter to the editor? Or can
we as a student body do something
to make our voices heard and take
back the richness of our college ex
perience? The administration's
current tactics may be hauling in
the dough right now, with massive
donations and ever-ballooning tu
ition and board bills — all the
while keeping Stanford out of the
police blotter — but they are cre
ating a generation of unsatisfied
students. If you ever get the chance
to talk to John Arrillaga, who grad
uated in 1%0. he has some really
sick stories from his time on the
Farm. But stop and think to your
self right now: is there anyone left
among us with enough passion
about this place to donate the next
new stadium?
