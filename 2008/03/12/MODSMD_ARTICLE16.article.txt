# Co-Terminal Illness
## Six short columns about Stanford 
### 
We columnists frequently have ideas
that we know cannot fill an entire
column, but which we would like to
see published anyway.

You're only bom twice
It'searly March, and I 'm feeling blue. Finals
are approaching. 1 have a monster toothache,
and Obama just lost Ohio and Texas. What to
do? But of course: I'll change my birthday on
Facebook and throw a party, even though my
real birthday was a month ago.
For many people. Facebook is constitutive
of their very selfhood, and one's "basic infor
mation" is as sacred and irrevocable as a birth
certificate. But changing your "digital" birth
day is a great way to rope new friends into a
scurrilous celebration of your neo-nativity, as
well as to give old friends who forgot that you
were actually born on Feb. 3 a chance to re
deem themselves.
On the one hand, your pal who lives in the
city might be a bit pissed off that he drove all
the way to Palo Alto for a sham. On the other
hand, people are surprisingly willing to cast
aside reality for the sake of a good time. So
bring on those Mind Erasers. II you drink
enough, we can do this again in April.
Blame the boomers
The New York Times recently reported
that the number of high school graduates will
begin to decline next year after 15 years of
steady growth, the result of the bumper crop
of the children of boomers. This will result in
fewer college applicants and less selectivity.
President Hennessy wrote that his "primary
rationale" for arguing for expansion is "the

dramatic growth in the number of applicants."
lhis would seem to take some wind out of
those sails.
Note to a student Hillary supporter
Dear Student Hillary Supporter, you've
got a great, well-qualified candidate there.
Congratulations. However, don't think that
as a young person who doesn't support
Barack Obama, you are therefore a free
thinker and a non-conformist. Some might
say that your tendency to suspect every bowl
of Kool-Aid of being laced with poison is"ra
tional." Others prefer "paranoid" and
"unimaginative."
Wilbur limo
There has been a late 1980s model
Chrysler Fifth Avenue limousine with a flat
tire parked outside Wilbur Hall since Septem
ber. As for the car's owner, all we can surmise
is that he or she is an Fast Campus resident, as
it has two years' worth of EA parking stickers
on the windshield. To whomever owns this
car: I salute you.
Two examples of highly ineffective Stanford
speakers:
Example 1: Usage of the expression "Yay!" to

avoid substantive commentary about a serious
issue.
Friend 1: So I was having sex with my girl
friend last night, and the condom broke.
Friend 2: Yay, unprotected sex!
Friend 1: No, you don't understand. I'm very
concerned because she's not on birth control.
Friend 2: Yay, unplanned pregnancies!
Friend 1: Never mind. dude.
Example 2: Usage of "I was just going to say..
." in a seminar setting.
(Professor calls on a flustered student.)
Student: Oh ... I was just going to say... that
you should never underestimate the value of
piling up verb tenses and indefinite temporal
markers within a sentence.
Professor: Good point. Student. I'll take note
of your comment in a parallel universe where
all of the things you were going to say have ac
tually been said.
Cereal
Does anyone else remember Rice Krispies
Treats cereal? It was arguably the greatest ce
real known to man until it vanished from store
shelves years back. Some fan sites claim to
know of retailers still peddling the stuff, but a
quick search on the Kellogg's Web site
showed no hookup within an 80-mile radius of
Stanford. I know it had a lot of sugar, but if
they still make Cookie Crisp — "Cookies?
For breakfast?!" — there must be other rea
sons.

Wilbur limo, email Dave and Brendan at dher
