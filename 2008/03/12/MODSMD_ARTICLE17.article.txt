## News without numbers 
### 
In the coverage of the Democratic primary,
have you noticed the phrase "a complex
mathematical formula" — as in the sen
tence "it looks like Hillary Clinton is going to
win Texas, but the delegates are allocated by a
complex mathematical formula ... ?"
Let's unpack this statement for a moment.
A "formula" is an abstract or symbolic rule that
you can apply to various situations. OK, so we
know they are going to use a rule to allocate the
delegates; they're not just going to do it on the
fly. So far, so good.
Next step: if you're going to assign a number
of delegates to one candidate and another
number of delegates to another candidate,
you're using numbers, so yeah, the formula is
probably going to be "mathematical." You're
not going to use a "chemical formula," for ex
ample, to allocate the delegates. At the risk of
stating the obvious, there is nothing that is not
a "rule involving numbers" that they could pos
sibly use to assign the delegates.
So the only thing left is "complex" — in
other words, the rule involving numbers is
complicated. "Complex" doesn't tell us what
the content of the rule is — it just tells us a
characteristic of that rule, a rule we still don't
know.
Incidentally, the "complex" rule was typi
cally this: in a given congressional district you
get the percentage of the delegates closest to
the percentage of the votes you got in that dis
trict. So assume there's four delegates. If you
get 50 percent of the vote, you get two of the
four; if you get 75 percent, you get three of the
four: and you switch from getting two to getting
three at the halfway point — 67.5 percent of
the vote. Some congressional districts get more
delegates than others because some have more
Democrats or Democratic voters in them, and
some states determine the number of dele
gates based on the country or state legislature
district rather than the congressional district.
So the formula isn't that "complex" at all. In
fact, the Burnt Orange Report, a Texas politics
blog, had primary delegate projections that
were accurate to about three percent a week
ahead of the contest, for example.They also put
up a map of the districts and how many dele
gates were allocated to each so you could get a
sense of how they arrived at these projections.
Meanwhile, the "best political team on TV"
was projecting who would win the statewide
popular vote in Texas a week later, after the
voting was already over. It's surreal. After re
porting the irrelevant popular vote number,
they explain that what they just said has some
thing to do with the right number, but the rela
tionship is "complex." I don't believe that

CNN's team of experts are literally unable to
make sense of the process — more likely they
think we'd rather listen to discredited have
beens like Ralph Reed argue over who has the
"momentum."
Things like baseballs have momentum.
Elections have facts.
Perhaps it's the untold story of the 2008
election that bloggers a few years out of college
have consistently showed up the most impor
tant news outlets in America. But that would
n't be new.
Think about this: do you remember the sub
prime mortgage scandal — how "complex
deals turned sour?" Do you have any idea what
these "complex deals" were — or how "a fla
vor you perceive with the sides of your tongue"
relates to "the process of either selling an asset
on short notice or drumming up more money
to set aside as the collateral for a loan whose
credit rating just got downgraded?" Doesn't
that relationship seem worth reporting? Or to
whom the billions of lost dollars belonged and
where they went?
Or how about this one: Chinese "Blue Sky"
air quality standards are 250 micrograms of
particulate matter per cubic meter, and they try
to get there 245 days a year, or about two thirds
of the time. In contrast, the United States EPA
standards are 150 micrograms per cubic meter,
and they are not to be exceeded more than
once a year. In other words, one in three days in
Beijing the air is 70 percent more polluted than
an American city is allowed to be one day per
year. Remember the extensive New York
Times piece on the topic? The 2,500-word arti
cle on pollution levels never once used the
word "gram," the unit which is used to measure
pollution levels. That's embarrassing.
There are a lot of things you can't under
stand without numbers — how delegates are
allocated, where the subprime mortgage
money went or how Beijing's air quality com
pares to international standards, for example.
Email me if you'd like to help me do something
about this. I'm in the very initial stages of start
ing a "Numbers in the News" project with a
couple buddies.

Kai Stinchcombe still has a couple tricks up his
sleeve. Email him at kstinch@stanford.edu.
