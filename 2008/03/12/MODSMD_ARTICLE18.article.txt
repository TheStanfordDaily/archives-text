## The 						rites of spring (break) 
### 
Word on the street is that our favorite
ancient Greek philosopher
Socrates might be somewhat re
sponsible for some of spring break's origins.
He not only told the youth that the unexam
ined life was not worth living but also sug
gested that they party like it was 4JO B.(' lb
welcome the vernal equinox.elaborate festi
vals would be thrown to pay tribute to
Dionysus, conveniently the Greek god of
wine and fertility. And thus the pagan youths
had fun. fun. fun until the monks took their
flower crowns away a few centuries later.
Some claim that our modern concept of
spring break began in the trenches of World
War I, as American soldiers serving in
France watched Europeans halt spring of
fenses temporarily to take a break and party.
The young Americans enjoyed the scantily
clad young ladies that would dance in cele
bration over the trenches until they realized
that many of these women were, in fact,
men. This confusion apparently marked the
onset of the phrase "Show us
your...breasts..." which has since become a
spring break staple.
The spring break we think of now proba
bly took its roots in Florida in the 19305.
After the state's first Olympic-sized pool
was built in Ft. Lauderdale, the Colgate Uni
versity swim coach decided to take his team
down south to train during a school break in
1935. Several schools followed suit and soon
students all over the country were flocking
to Florida for some fun in the sun.
The popular 1960 movie "Where the
Boys Are," about four Midwestern college
co-eds on spring break in Ft. Lauderdale, re
ally solidified the idea of a spring break ex
perience in Florida. After the film, thou
sands of college students started streaming
into Ft. Lauderdale every spring in search of
romance, adventure and a scary tan. But the
good, clean fun of spring break got wilder

throughout the '60s and '70s as the sandy
beaches of Ft. Lauderdale evolved from sim
ply the place where the boys were to a play
ground for sex, drugs and rock and roll.
By the mid 1980s, Ft. Lauderdale's local
government officials got tired of finding
shot glasses and extra-small white T-shirts
strewn on their streets, so they cracked down
and passed a lot of anti-antics laws. "Fort
1 .iquordale" soon lost its spring-break allure
as it developed (devolved?) into the city
where you go to visit your grandma or em
bark on a magical Disney Cruise.
Of course, by that time it didn't matter
that Ft. Lauderdale was lame because col
lege students had discovered that there were
other places to go. Like Tijuana and Cancun,
where many still travel to appreciate Mexi
can culture by taking advantage of the 18-
and-up drinking age and the abundance of
cheap tequila.
Or like Daytona Beach, Florida where
the first MTV Spring Break extravaganza
was shot in 1986. When 1 was about 12 and
used to occasionally watch MTV to keep up
with the latest boy band videos, I would
catch glimpses of the glistening, gyrating
teen orgy conducted by Carson Daly that,
oddly enough, started in February and
somehow managed to last well into summer.
1 learned a lot in the short snippets that I
saw. First of all, that many college students
will do just about anything for a free T-shirt.
And that what happens at spring break
doesn't stay at spring break if it gets caught

by MTV cameras. And that if you want to
flash somebody, there are plenty of vultures
ready to turn your flesh into soft porn that
will run on loop at 3 a.m. and be titled "Girls
Gone Wild," because the title "Girls Enjoy
ing Their Youih and Unexpectedly Becom
ing Masturbation Fodder and Skeezy
Rapists' Tickets to Fame and Fortune" is too
long.
Off the air, spring break has also devel
oped a quieter side. For many college stu
dents, it has become the perfect time to do
some community service by going on trips
like Stanford's Alternative Spring Breaks.
Others dedicate spring break to simply veg
ging out. And some hit the road and embark
on trips that range from beatific to Britney
Spears' "Crossroads"-esque. One minute
you're singing "1 Love Rock n' Roll" with
your girlfriends while jumping on a bed and
the next minute you're in court, fighting for
the custody of your children.
Anyway.
When finals end in 10 days, I will be head
ing across the country to spend my spring
break in Florida as 1 have done every year to
parrrrtay. And by party, I mean hanging out
with my mom in her modest condo, which is
nestled in a 55+ community 10 miles away
from Clearwater.
If I am feeling particularly festive, 1 might
venture out to the community pool with a
book and read in the sun while 80-year-old
snowbirds from Quebec float around in
inner tubes. Perhaps we will even do shots of
Pepto-Bismol together. All in all, we bouts
to go dumb.

Natalie Jabbar wants to wish you a happy and
safe spring break, wherever it shall take you. If
you get bored, email her at njabbar<&stan
ford.edu and she will happily provide you with
real-time commentary from the community
pool scene.
