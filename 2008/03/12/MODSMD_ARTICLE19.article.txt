Errors in mercury story harm public
health
To the Editor,
I am writing to draw your attention to some
errors contained in "Something's Fishey" [Mar.
7], Here are the specifics:
The entire article is based on specific con
cerns found in a New York Times story on mer
cury in tuna that ran on Jan. 23,2008. The story
the reporter is referring to has been widely dis
credited by Time, Slate.com. the Center for In
dependent Media and the Times' own public ed
itor. To refer to the story without putting it in its
proper perspective only serves to feed into a cli
mate of confusion that ultimately hurts public
health.The article refers directly to the Times ar
ticle four times throughout the piece but never
once mentions the fact that the paper's own om
budsman writes that the original article "was
less balanced than it should have been,given the
state of existing research."
In paragraph three, the story states, "so is it
worth listening to this report at all? For some
students, it's a definite yes."The article proceeds
from this point on without ever mentioning that
a renowned Harvard cardiologist quoted in
Time magazine suggests the article is in fact not
worth listening to.This lack of balance should be
addressed.
In paragraph eight, the story states, "canned
tuna may also contain unsafe levels of mercury."
There is no attribution to this assertion and it is

patently false. According to the FDA, canned
light tuna averages around 0.1 ppm, while
canned albacore averages around 0.3 ppm. Both
of these averages are well below the FDA action
level of 1.0 ppm. Consumers should feel confi
dent that canned tuna remains a safe and
healthy part of the American diet and to suggest
that it is not is simply inaccurate.
In paragraph 17, the story states, "a 1991
study conducted by the Food and Drug Admin
istration (FDA) reports that the risk of getting
sick from eating seafood is approximately one in
two million servings." This would have been a
good place for the reporter to note that there
has never been a single case of mercury toxicity
in this country from normal consumption of
seafood. This is a fact that is not reported in this
or any paragraph of the article.
In paragraph 21, the story states, "So there
you have it. Another inconclusive verdict on
what constitutes healthy food." The American
Dietetic Association, American Heart Associa
tion, and U.S. Dietary Guidelines are not "in
conclusive" about whether fish is a healthy food.
Fish is a safe and healthy food and experts agree.
Your writer suggests that because a publically
and professionally discredited, poorly sourced,
unbalanced and sensationalist scare-story
raised concerns about mercury levels that the
jury is out on the health benefits of seafood.
