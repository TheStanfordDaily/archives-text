# PAC-10 CHAMPS
## Wiggins named Most Outstanding Player after Cal win 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Pac-10 Tournament final turned into the Candice
Wiggins shooting clinie Monday night, as the star guard
scored 30 points to lead the Cardinal to a 56-35 victory over
Cal.
Wiggins, who was named the Pac-10 Player of the Year in
a ceremony on Thursday, added another award to her impres
sive resume: the Pac-10 Tournament's Most Outstanding
Player. She was joined on the All-Tournament team by fresh-

man forward Kayla Ped
ersen and sophomore
center Jayne Appel.
Against Cal, Wiggins
played just 26 minutes,
hut it was more than
enough time for her to
dismantle the Bears' de
fense. 1 ler points came in
a variety of ways: she hit
five three-pointers, fin
ished a number of tough
layups and knocked
down her jumpers from
the field, including one
particularly acrobatic
shot that was easily the
play of the game.

She leaped out from underneath the pressure and, as she fell
both backwards and sideways, heaved up a jumper that

ry. There were still 25 minutes left to
play, but with a 31-8 lead and her star
hitting nearly every shot, even the
normally stoic Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer could only smile as her
team ran away with the game, its third
victory over Berkeley on the year.
Stanford leaned heavily on Wig
gins, who was coming off of a poor
shooting performance against UCLA
in the semi-finals, to carry the team.
"1 think Candice put this tourna
ment on her back," said VanDerveer.
"She knew today was the day she
needed to play well, and she got it
going. She was just awesome."
"My teammates have confidence
in my shot. They know if 1 miss, I'll
start making them," said Wiggins.
But, with the exception of Wiggins,
the Cardinal's offensive game was
hardly a tour de force — Pedersen
was the only Cardinal to join Wiggins
in double figures, and just five players
scored at all.
Instead, the game was won on de
fense: Stanford held Cal to just 6-for
-31 shooting in the first half for a total
of only 15 points, and, though the
Bears shot better in the second period,
they were still held to their lowest out
put of the season. The Cardinals mar
gin of victory was the title game's
largest point discrepancy in its history.
"I was disappointed with the out
come of this game," said Berkeley
coach Joanne Boyle. "I was racking
my brain trying to put us in a position
to score, and it just didn't happen."
Stanford's tenacious defense held
Berkeley's posts — Ashley Walker
and Devanei Hampton, two of the
Bears' best players — to just seven
points combined. Hampton shot only
2-of-15 from the field, and no Bear
scored over six points.
There was, quite simply, no silver
lining to this loss for Cal.
"We had a few different tactics we
were looking to use against them. We
never left Devanei alone. We con
stantly had two people coming,on the
way, or there already," said Appel.
"We didn't make shots," said
Hampton. "I'm not going to stop
shooting when my team needs me to
shoot."
VanDerveer credited sophomore
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude with
setting the defensive tone.
"Ros takes playing defense per

sonally. She was on Alexis Gray-Law
son, who is a great player," she said.
"We didn't want [Lauren] Greif,
Kelsey Adrian or [Natasha] Vital to
get hot outside, and they didn't. I
think it was excellent focus and pride
in playing great defense."
Stanford won the Pac-10 title for
the second straight year, and the fifth
time in the last seven. The Cardinal
dominated in every game it played,
outscoring opponents by an average
of 25.7 points per game.
Most impressive, Stanford held all
three of its opponents to under 20
points scoring in the first half, essen
tially ending each game before half
time.
But VanDerveer pointed to sec
ond-half let downs as one of the few
flaws the Cardinal has to fix before the
NCAA Tournament in two weeks.
"I saw a first-half tournament
team. We need to throw knock-out
punches in the second half. We need to
keep the hammer down and not let a
team come back," she said.
The "hammer" will be needed
against the country's best in the
NCAAs, but it was hardly needed
against the rest of the Pac-10. Stanford
triumphed over Oregon State 64-41
on Saturday before beating UCLA
78-45 on Sunday.
Appel led Stanford in its first two
matches and was the favorite for the
Most Outstanding Player award be
fore the title game. She was perfect
from the field (8-for-8) against the
Beavers while posting a double dou
ble, and she led the Cardinal in scor
ing and blocks against the Bruins.
Although she didn't have an im
pressive scoring output against the
Bears (four points), she still pulled
down 14 boards, blocked four shots and
dished out five assists, all while holding
Hampton in check for the entire game.
"There's four or five top centers in
the country, and Jayne's one of them,"
said Boyle.
Appel, Wiggins and their team
mates will now have a two-week
break before the NCAATournament
starts on March 22. Stanford will host
its first two rounds of play at Maples
Pavilion.
But the team will hardly be resting
before then, as VanDerveer and her
staff will aim to perfect the squad.
"We need to play really, really
well," she said. "I'm very excited
about our tournament win, but 1 do
have some material to work with."

Bears' best players — to just seven
points combined. Hampton shot only
2-of-15 from the field, and no Bear
scored over six points.
There was, quite simply, no silver
lining to this loss for Cal.
"We had a few different tactics we
were looking to use against them. We
never left Devanei alone. We con
stantly had two people coming,on the
way, or there already," said Appel.
"We didn't make shots," said
Hampton. "I'm not going to stop
shooting when my team needs me to
shoot."
VanDerveer credited sophomore
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude with
setting the defensive tone.
"Ros takes playing defense per

sonally. She was on Alexis Gray-Law
son, who is a great player," she said.
"We didn't want [Lauren] Greif,
Kelsey Adrian or [Natasha] Vital to
get hot outside, and they didn't. I
think it was excellent focus and pride
in playing great defense."
Stanford won the Pac-10 title for
the second straight year, and the fifth
time in the last seven. The Cardinal
dominated in every game it played,
outscoring opponents by an average
of 25.7 points per game.
Most impressive, Stanford held all
three of its opponents to under 20
points scoring in the first half, essen
tially ending each game before half
time.
But VanDerveer pointed to sec
ond-half let downs as one of the few
flaws the Cardinal has to fix before the
NCAA Tournament in two weeks.
"I saw a first-half tournament
team. We need to throw knock-out
punches in the second half. We need to
keep the hammer down and not let a
team come back," she said.
The "hammer" will be needed
against the country's best in the
NCAAs, but it was hardly needed
against the rest of the Pac-10. Stanford
triumphed over Oregon State 64-41
on Saturday before beating UCLA
78-45 on Sunday.
Appel led Stanford in its first two
matches and was the favorite for the
Most Outstanding Player award be
fore the title game. She was perfect
from the field (8-for-8) against the
Beavers while posting a double dou
ble, and she led the Cardinal in scor
ing and blocks against the Bruins.
Although she didn't have an im
pressive scoring output against the
Bears (four points), she still pulled
down 14 boards, blocked four shots and
dished out five assists, all while holding
Hampton in check for the entire game.
"There's four or five top centers in
the country, and Jayne's one of them,"
said Boyle.
Appel, Wiggins and their team
mates will now have a two-week
break before the NCAATournament
starts on March 22. Stanford will host
its first two rounds of play at Maples
Pavilion.
But the team will hardly be resting
before then, as VanDerveer and her
staff will aim to perfect the squad.
"We need to play really, really
well," she said. "I'm very excited
about our tournament win, but 1 do
have some material to work with."

Wiggins shooting clinie Monday night, as the star guard
scored 30 points to lead the Cardinal to a 56-35 victory over
Cal.
Wiggins, who was named the Pac-10 Player of the Year in
a ceremony on Thursday, added another award to her impres
sive resume: the Pac-10 Tournament's Most Outstanding
Player. She was joined on the All-Tournament team by fresh-

man forward Kayla Ped

center Jayne Appel.

enough time for her to

shot that was easily the
play of the game.

teamed inside the arc as time wound down on the shot clock.
She leaped out from underneath the pressure and, as she fell
both backwards and sideways, heaved up a jumper that
swooshed right through the net.
A timeout was called shortly thereafter, but Cal's fate was
practically sealed: the Bears trailed by 15 and would never
again come close to catching the Cardinal.
After play resumed, Stanford went on a 10-2 run that in

ry. There were still 25 minutes left to
play, but with a 31-8 lead and her star
hitting nearly every shot, even the
normally stoic Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer could only smile as her
team ran away with the game, its third
victory over Berkeley on the year.
Stanford leaned heavily on Wig
gins, who was coming off of a poor
shooting performance against UCLA
in the semi-finals, to carry the team.
"1 think Candice put this tourna
ment on her back," said VanDerveer.
"She knew today was the day she
needed to play well, and she got it
going. She was just awesome."
"My teammates have confidence
in my shot. They know if 1 miss, I'll
start making them," said Wiggins.
But, with the exception of Wiggins,
the Cardinal's offensive game was
hardly a tour de force — Pedersen
was the only Cardinal to join Wiggins
in double figures, and just five players
scored at all.
Instead, the game was won on de
fense: Stanford held Cal to just 6-for
-31 shooting in the first half for a total
of only 15 points, and, though the
Bears shot better in the second period,
they were still held to their lowest out
put of the season. The Cardinals mar
gin of victory was the title game's
largest point discrepancy in its history.
"I was disappointed with the out
come of this game," said Berkeley
coach Joanne Boyle. "I was racking
my brain trying to put us in a position
to score, and it just didn't happen."
Stanford's tenacious defense held
