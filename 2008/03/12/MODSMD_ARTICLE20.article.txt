# You're Not Special
## Nice guys make bad presidents 
### 
I don't trust Barack Obama. His
stump speech tells Americans that
we can rise above our differences.
He says that politics does not have to
be a fight. Instead, we can just sit down
and talk out our problems. And if I just
have the audacity to hope, then no
dilemma is without a solution. If that is
what he really thinks, he is just being
naive and he will be an ineffectual
president.
Of course the American people are
tired of being divided. Of course we're
tired of "partisan roadblocks" and
"ideological walls." After all, it's really
annoying when people disagree with
you. And it's really annoying when the
Republicans in Congress stop De
mocrats from doing what they want. 1,
too, wish conservatives would just see
the light, admit how wrong they have
been, and assist us in enacting a glori
ous liberal agenda in which healthcare
will be provided to all and cars will run
on sunshine.
But that is not going to happen.
Partisanship exists because people
disagree. And as long as people dis
agree, the politicians who represent
them are going to disagree. Obama
presents the liberal palette of ideas as
if it were so nakedly obvious that if
someone just sat down with conser
vatives and explained it to them in
stentorian tones, they would be
struck dumb by the truth.
In reality, there is a chasm of un
certainty surrounding every proposal
he makes. Will withdrawing from Iraq
make us safer? Can we achieve uni
versal healthcare at a reasonable cost
without decreasing quality of care?
Can we close the budget deficit, while
increasing spending, without increas
ing the tax burden on the poor and
middle class? And will more govern
ment programs actually solve prob
lems like global warming and educa

tional shortcomings?
I happen to think that the answer
to these questions is "yes." But a rea
sonable person could make a fairly de
cent argument that Barack and i are
wrong. And if that reasonable person
happened to be in the Senate, then he
would be honor-bound to oppose
Obama's policies.
What would Obama do when
faced with resolute senators deter
mined to hold up his bills in commit
tee and filibuster them when they
reach the floor? Would he wring his
hands at how they're just practicing
the old politics of division, and refuse
to get in the gutter with his opponents
and fight back? Or would he have the
courage to destroy someone, a good
person who honestly thought he was
doing what was right, just because
that person disagreed with him?
Can we really have a president
who believes that "it's possible to
compromise so long as you never
compromise your principles?" That's
bull. In politics, you have to sell your
principles at cut-rate prices in order to
enact even a fraction of what you be
lieve is right.
Both Democratic candidates
have almost the same policies and
beliefs. Basically, they only differ on
their vision for how to enact those
policies. Where Obama sells persua
sion, Clinton is shilling the same old
political maneuvering. And 1 agree,

those politics are ugly. Dirty deals are
made; people get slandered; unethi
cal corporations receive giveaways;
and three hundred million dollar
bridges in Alaska are built. But those
politics get things done. The New
Deal, civil rights legislation and the
Great Society were all opposed by
large sections of Congress. They all
came about through back-door ma
neuvering and naked power plays by
the president.
It is entirely possible that the De
mocratic party will find itself in pos
session of both houses of Congress, as
well as the presidency, on January 20,
2009. But the Republican minority
will still have a significant amount of
power to block the Democratic agen
da. And they will do so, both because
they believe in what they are doing
and because any victory for the De
mocrats is a loss for them. Further
more, the Democratic party is
renowned for squabbling. It is possi
ble that when we are in the majority,
we'll be our own worst enemy. We
need a president who is willing to
shove his opponents out of the halls of
power using exactly the same tactics
that Bush has been turning on the De
mocrats for eight years. We need a
president who will use brutal tactics to
enforce party conformity.
Our president should be someone
who doesn't need to rely on flowing
rhetoric to accomplish her aims. She
should be so certain that what she is
doing is right that she is willing to
knock the opposition to the ground,
and then kick them when they're
down.

It doesn 't mutter whether you agree with
me or not. Over the next two months
Hillary Clinton is going to systematical
ly destroy Barack Ohama. Email Rahul
