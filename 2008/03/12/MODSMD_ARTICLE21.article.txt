# 'Nat'-ural Philosophy
## The 						bad wife 
### 
Soon after the moment of my
birth. I was drawn into a gunshot
marriage with an extravagant
queen. It was a forced and unwilling
union of two opposed souls. From a
young age. 1 was required to give in to
the every whim of this selfish matron,
to dote on her highness in shameless
subservience. Harsh, spoiled and
stubborn, the maiden cared neither
for my charms nor my graces. I was to
her as a hound is to a hunter, a serf to
a vassal. We grew up together but
apart, conjoined but alone. And over
time, our union has become only
more estranged. 1 have grown in
censed by her very existence.
The maiden's name is Time. And
my marriage is strained. The bottom
line: I can no longer tolerate her
fiendish tricks.
This last Sunday, 1 have decided,
was the final straw. 1 awoke in a cold
sweat at 3 a.m. to find that once again,
she had robbed me, and further, she
had enchanted my clocks. She had en
chanted all the clocks. As a result. I
once again lost sleep over her
unchecked treachery.
The clocks are her minions, carry
ing out her evil plot with unthinking,
mechanical ease. Their illusion is
Constancy and Precision. Their reali
ty is programmed deceit. A minute is
never a minute, an hour never an
hour. Empirical tests be damned,
clocks are a supernatural phenome
non, commanded by the reins of a
harsh and unyielding master, one
who, sadly, is my other half.
1 cower in fear at her drive, her in
escapable march toward the future.

Time is an inevitable, invincible jug
gernaut. She is selfish, reckless and
demanding in her pursuit of the fu
ture. Time waits for no man, least of
all me.
It is said that Time flies. But time is
no falcon, no eagle. It is instead a pi
geon — a dirty rat with wings. She
does not soar, she cannot soar. Her
flight is clumsy, her feathers ruffled.
She scrounges desperately in the
park for breadcrumbs, dwells on use
less things that are soon devoured.
And though she is a queen. Time
lacks the social graces that are typical
of her position. Time is never there
when 1 need her, but when I don't, she
overstays her welcome. Even worse,
she is unpredictably unpredictable.
Like a clever femme fatale, she draws
me in with the promise of plenty —
for one fleeting instant I have all the
Time in the world — but holds the
pistol to my back as she whispers her
sweet nothings. Time always gets her
way.
Is it possible to ignore her? Is it
possible to deny our marriage and es
cape to the land of the infinite? As
much as 1 may wish for my freedom,
divorce requires two signatures.Thus,
we are wedded for an eternity.
In one small act of defiance, I can

escape from her grasp, for an instant
— I can take all the photographs in
the world. Or I can go to Sleep, my
mistress, and in her arms. Time does
not exist. But Time knows. Her min
ions, the clocks, sound a morning
alarm, a harsh and unforgiving bugle
call to rouse me from my tryst.
I am forever entrenched in an un
heroic, matrimonial battle with Time
and her followers. It was one that I
could not avoid, and now is one I can
not escape.The best 1 can do, with my
castle under siege from the hoards of
her army, is to accept what she takes
but acknowledge, also, what she gives.
Time, you can have the hours I
spend playing video games. You can
have my accumulated years on the
couch, watching TV or in theaters, in
a daze, staring at movie screens. You
can even continue to make me late
for everything and continue to force
me to turn in my papers after they are
due.
I thank you, however, for the slow
passage of tragic events which keep
me wrapped in quiet reflection.
Thank you for the moments spent
looking at beautiful scenery, and, be
cause it helps my sense of security,
thank you for continuing the illusion
of constancy.
Given all your demands. Time, I
will still cherish what you give me. I
will not waste you.

wife, you'll be happy; if you get a bad
one, you '11 become a philosopher." Tell
