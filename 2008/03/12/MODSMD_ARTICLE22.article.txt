1 agree with President Hennessy,
that a small increase in the num
ber of undergraduates, if planned
and managed carefully, could be
good for Stanford.
But mine isn't a popular position.
"Expansion means complexity and
complexity decay," wrote C. North
cote Parkinson.a British historian fa
mous for his work on bureaucracies.
It would appear that a significant
part of the Stanford community
shares his skepticism as applied to
the undergraduate class.
By a causal search of The Daily
archives, there have been three news
articles, three columns, one op-ed
and one letter to the editor on the
possible expansion in undergraduate
students. In the online comments
section of these articles, there has
been an overwhelmingly negative re
action. Self-identified students, par
ents and alumni have all spoken
strongly against a larger Stanford.
One understandable cause of this
negativity is a lack of information.
While many people know the subject
has been introduced, not many facts
on the progress of Hennessy's pro
posal have been available to the pub
lic. Hie task force Hennessy created
in October to discuss the possibility
of an expansion has so far met twice
during closed meetings, and the only
student representative was ASSU
President Hershey Avula. The meet
ings' relative secrecy has stoked sus
picion that an expansion is unstop

pable, and that with it the undergrad
uate experience will dramatically
suffer. Neither of these assumptions,
in fact, are necessarily true.
The Daily reported on Mar. 3 that
the next task force meeting will focus
on developing a plan for campus out
reach during spring quarter to inte
grate concerns of the broader com
munity into the committee's report.
"Right now there is no predeter
mined outcome about whether we
are going to do expansion or not,"
Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to
I lennessy and a task force member,
was quoted as saying.
On the same day as the outreach
announcement, the co-chairs of the
task force. Trustee Jim Canales and
Professor Ramon Saldivar, wrote a
letter to the editor emphasizing the
importance of student input: "We all
have a stake in the outcome of that
conversation and we look forward to
your engagement in the process."
The administration should have
broadcasted sooner and louder that
student concerns would play a major
role in the expansion debate. A
closed task force feeds misgivings.

Even though the secrecy has been
weird, a bigger undergraduate popu
lation does not scare me. I think that
more super-talented students would
have a positive impact on campus. In
any case, 1 don't think the University
would make a major change to its un
dergraduate education that ulti
mately impaired its quality. As Hen
nessy has made clear from his first
column on the issue of expansion, no
decision will be sudden, and any in
crease has consequences like the
need for more housing that require
several years of planning at the very
least.
If you are against expansion, par
ticipate in the outreach events. Mobi
lize like crazy, start a petition. Let the
task force know the thousands of
reasons you think an increase would
be bad. Despite all the rumors to the
contrary, they want to listen.
It is easy to vilify Hennessy,
Wachtel and other university offi
cials. The storyline of the evil admin
istration out to ruin Stanford is fun
and well tread. And I agree commu
nication could have been handled
better on this issue. But the officials
and task force members do care
about Stanford on a level that goes
far beyond reputation, fundraising
aiid liability. Enough with the con
spiracy theories.

Are there any other students who
aren't against expansion? Email
