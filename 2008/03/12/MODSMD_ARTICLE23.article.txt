# Pleading Inanity
## Making up 
### 
Are you surprised by my tears.
Mr. Reader? Strong men also
cry. Strong men also cry.
No, I'm not bawling because my
Burt's Bees Baby Bee Mango Peach
Conditioner with Echinacea lecithin
extract washed into my eyes. (1 actual
ly use the tear-free variety, thank you
very much.) No, friends, I weep be
cause soon I'm leaving on a jet plane,
don't know when I'll be back again.
(My return ticket says May 1. but that
doesn't fit into the lyric.) Where am I
going, you ask? Namibia.
I first got the idea to go to southern
Africa from reading the delightful se
ries of Opinion pieces by Courtney
Weaver entitled "Fish Out of Water."
Last quarter, Courtney had the gall to
take a midterm in a random class, go
on a blind date and attend a meeting
of the Palo Alto Scrabble club, all in
the name of writing some awesome
ops pieces. Not one to be one-upped. 1
decided that 1 would gather fodder
for my columns by going to Africa to
build judicial capacity and fight for
the rights of HIV/AIDS prisoners.
After this brief bout of inspiration,
I hesitated. I always assumed that law
school had to be a miserable, pointless
and self-absorbed exercise in futility
— in fact, I believe that is the subtitle
of Stanford Law School's admission
brochure. Yet, somewhere inside me
was the feeling that the efforts of a
dedicated group of human beings
might be able to accomplish some
thing other than "helping companies

explore extraordinary opportunities,
manage and sustain growth and max
imize revenue."
Did you notice that I quoted McK
insey's Web site? Mr./ Miss McKinsey,
1 quote you because I love you. (PS.
I'll be knocking on your doorstep
when 1 get back from Windhoek — I
have $2(X).(XX) in debt to pay off here.)
Now, 1 understand that I'm not the
only one leaving the Stanford bubble;
a sea of undergrads is on the verge of
entering the real world. Of course,
there will always be a handful who
cling to the cloistered confines of aca
demia via Ph.Ds in order to postpone
weaning, but I'm confident that most
of you will be suckling at new teats
come this summer.
Back when I was in your shoes —
right around the summer of '69 — I
had plenty of ideas about how to
make my last quarter of college mem
orable. First and foremost on my list
was telling the really hot girl in my
moral philosophy class — her name
was Nayanatara if I recall correctly —
that she was the yin to my yang. 1 re
member it like it was only 14 years
ago: She had long and viscous hair,
smooth and creamy skin, substantial

though not excessive junk in the
trunk. Listening to her talk about
supererogatory behaviors always
made my palms Dewey and got me all
Rawled up So one day, with nothing
to lose but my dignity, 1 decided to
pony up and ask her out.
Oh. how she rejoiced upon hearing
my words! Choirs sang, birds eloped
with bees and the universe finally
seemed to make sense. I'm a secular
man through and through, but I must
admit that for those last 10 weeks of
school, I was thanking my former in
carnations for what must have been
some intense moral rectitude and
pious sacrifice. And even though our
prurient pleasures were initially
painful because of our limited time to
gether. I soon realized that each and
every moment in her presence made
my entire life worthwhile.
*Sigh* Who am I kidding? 1 was
too much of a coward to ever talk to
Nayanatara. As a result, she and 1
were never able to have the time to
gether we (I) so longed for and de
served. But, what sense of hope or sat
isfaction could a reader derive from
an ending like that? In this column. I
wanted to give us what we lost out on
in life. I'd like to think this isn't weak
ness or evasion, but a final act of kind
ness.

Sound like a movie you 've seen recent
ly? Let Vishnu know at vishnus@stan
ford.edu so he can sue them for antici
pating his ideas.
