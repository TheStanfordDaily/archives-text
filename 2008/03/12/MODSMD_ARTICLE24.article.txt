## STREAK EXTENDS Baseball beats Texas for sixth straight series win 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball is officially back.
The Cardinal recovered from an
opening 5-2 defeat to the Texas Long
horns to post thrilling 6-5 and 12-9 victo
ries this past weekend, winning its sixth
straight series dating back to May of
2007. After its first regular-season series
win at Texas in five years, Stanford (8-4)
re-entered the Baseball America Top 25
rankings at No. 18.
"It's tough to beat Texas here, so we
are very fortunate to have won two out
of three," head coach Mark Marquess
told GoStanford.com after the latest se
ries against his longtime friend, Texas
coach Augie Garrido.
Game One
Texas opened up an early lead Friday
and shut down the Cardinal lineup,cruis
ing to a 5-2 victory. After lead-off man
Travis Tucker walked for the Longhorns
in the first inning and was sacrificed to
second, Jordan Danks bounced a line
drive over the center field fence for a
ground-rule double that scored Tucker.
With Texas on the board. Cardinal
mistakes opened the floodgates. With

two on in the bottom of the third, a dou
ble-play ball that would have ended the
inning was misplayed, allowing two runs
to score. Texas catcher Cameron Rupp
would drive in another run to make it 4-
0.
Another unearned run would score
in the fifth after Cardinal starter Jeremy
Bleich fielded a dribbler to the mound
and airmailed second base, putting run
ners at the corners. Two straight walks
then loaded the bases and sent a run
home for the fourth unearned run of the
game and a 5-0 Texas lead.
The cold, windy weather favored
Texas' trademark smallball style.
"We helped them a little bit today,"
said Marquess. "And they don't usually
need any help."
Texas pitcher Austin Wood kept Stan
ford off the scoreboard for seven innings,
allowing only three hits before pinch hit
ter Joey August singled with two outs in
the eighth. Castro then sent Wood's final
pitch over the right field fence for a two
run homer that broke the shutout.
Game Two
Stanford set the tone by scoring early
in the second game. Phelps led off with a
single before stealing second and mov
ing to third on August's single. Castro
batted him home with a groundout to
give Stanford a 1-0 lead.Texas took a 2-1
lead with a run in each of the first two in
nings off of Stanford starter Erik Davis.
Phelps reached again on a walk in the
third, scoring on a sacrifice fly by August

to tie the game at 2. Stanford opened up
a 4-2 lead when Castro walked in the
fifth to load the bases, setting up Randy
Molina's two-run double.
Texas fans booed the umpire's strike
zone all day and got especially heated
when Texas right fielder Kyle Russell was
ejected after arguing a called third strike,
the second member of the Longhorn per
sonnel tossed in the first two days.
A two-out Texas walk in the fifth set
up TUcker's triple into the left field cor
ner, cutting the lead to one run. After a
double and a walk opened the bottom of
the sixth, heralded freshman Drew
Storen entered to relieve Davis.The first
batter he faced tied the game by singling
to center field, followed by a groundout
that brought home the go-ahead run.
The lead did not last long. August
reached first on a fielder's choice in the
ensuing inning, and Castro blasted his
second two-run homer in as many days
to give Stanford a 6-5 lead.
Storen walked Tucker in the bottom
of the seventh to put the tying run on
base, but after a steal and a single ad
vanced him to third. Storen struck out
Texas' No. 3 and No. 4 hitters to end the
inning.The Longhorns' last chance came
when Rupp singled to lead off the bot
tom of the ninth and was sacrificed to
second. Storen then forced the next two
batters to fly out to seal the win.

left-handed hitters flew out of the gate

on Sunday, setting the pace for a 12-9
win.
Center fielder Sean Ratliff stole the
show with a 4-for-5 performance includ
ing two solo home runs, a triple and five
RBI; he was also named the winning
pitcher after coming to the mound in re
lief. Texas' success at getting lead-off
baserunners was nullified by Stanford's
middle infielders. who cashed in a school
record six double plays on Sunday.
The two teams racked up 34 hits and
scored in every inning except one. Most
of the breaks went Stanford's way as
they raced to a 9-1 lead and held off a dy
namic Longhorn comeback that ended
with the bases loaded in the bottom of
the eighth. The Cardinal's compressed
travel schedule necessitated an agree
ment that no inning would start after 4
p.m. Central Time, which meant that the
eighth inning was the final frame.
The Cardinal batted around in the
top of the first.chasing Texas starter Cole
Green after just seven batters and put
ting up seven runs.
Stanford exploded again in the fifth.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Junior Cord Phelps scored the first two runs in Stanford's 6-5
win over the Longhorns in the second game of the series. He
finished with four runs scored in the weekend's three games.
Ratliff led off with a solo home run.
Designated hitter Austin Yount dou
bled and moved to third on a sacrifice
bunt. A wild pitch that bounced back
into the infield brought Yount home
for a bang-bang play at the plate;
Rupp received the throw in time, but
misplayed the ball as Yount was

called safe. Texas fans booed and ar
gued that Yount didn't touch the
plate, an inconclusive call from score
board replays.
Immediately following the bizarre
play Phelps struck again, blasting a
high fly ball to deep center field. Jor
dan Danks followed the ball to the
warning track, where he ran into the
wall as the ball bounced off the park's
distinctive Astroturf, Phelps raced
around the bases antf beatthe throw
home for an Inside-the-park home
run. Danks was down for several mo

ments before getting up, being
cleared by the training staff and re
taking his position in center field.
Phelps's fourth run of the series gave
Stanford a 9-1 lead.
Texas whittled the lead down with
seven runs in the next three innings,
including back-to-back solo home
runs in the seventh. With a 10-8 lead
to protect in the eighth, Stanford did
not lie down and put up two insur
ance runs. Defensive substitution Jeff
Whitlow singled and moved around
to third when Texas botched a pickoff

attempt at first base. He scored on
Castro's sacrifice fly, giving the catch
er six RBI for the series. Substitute
first baseman Brent Milleville
walked in the next at-bat. promptly
stole second and was doubled home
by Ratliff for a 12-8 lead.
In the decisive bottom of the
eighth. Texas quickly loaded the
bases and cut the lead to three by
drawing a one-out walk. With the
game on the line. Kawika Emsley-Pai
grounded to Phelps for a fitting 4-6-3
double play that ended the game, giv
ing freshman Alex Pracher his first
save of the season.
Ratliff told GoStanford.com, "It
was kind of relief to hold them off
today ... they were chipping away
and the more they chip, the louder
that stadium gets and the harder it is
to keep your composure. But I think
it's a good indication as to where we
are as a team right now, that we were
able to hold them off late like that."
Stanford had not won a series at
Texas in the regular season since
2003, although it did win the 2(X)6
NCAA Regional in Austin in domi
nating fashion.
Stanford is off for Dead Week and fi
nals before beginning a three-game
home-and-home series against Pacif
ic on Friday, March 21.
