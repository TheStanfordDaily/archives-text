# Women's basketball ready for NCAA run
## Stanford a likely No. 2 seed, still chance of a regional No. 1 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal entered the Fac-10 Tourna
ment with a No. 6 ranking, looking at a proba
ble No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament later
this month.
Connecticut. North Carolina andTennessee
— the top three teams in the country, respec
tively— had all but wrapped up three of the
four No. 1 seeds while No. 4 Rutgers and No. 5
Maryland would battle for the final slot.
Despite beating Rutgers earlier in the year,
Stanford was on the outside looking in — if the
Scarlet Knights and the Terrapins could finish
well in their respective conference tourna
ments, then the Cardinal would essentially be
eliminated from No. 1 consideration.
But Rutgers lost in the semifinal of the Big
East tournament to Louisville, and Maryland
lost in the semifinals of the ACC tournament to

Duke.
These developments cleared the way for
Stanford and No. 7 LSU to compete for the
fourth and final No. 1 spot. The Lady Tigers fell
to Tennessee in the SEC tournament on Sun
day, which meant that, in essence, Stanford con
trolled its own destiny. A win over Cal in Mon
day's Pac-10 Final would all hut ensure a No. 1
seed; a loss would put the slot back into con
tention.
The Cardinal won handily yesterday, 56-35,
and though nothing will he official until the se
lection show next Monday, experts, coaches
and players alike believe that Stanford has
locked up the final top seed.
After her team's victory over Berkeley,
coach Tara VanDerveer was asked whether she
felt that the Cardinal deserved a top seeding.
She answered simply: "I do."
Cal coach Joanne Boyle fielded the same
question and, without hesitation, said,
"Yeah, I definitely think they're a one seed."
Stanford only has three losses on the sea
son, and. while one was to highly ranked Con
necticut, two were at the hands of unranked
UCLA and USC teams, which hurt the Cardi
nal's stock in the eyes of many, despite Stan

ford's win over Rutgers in New Jersey and a
victory over then-No. 1 Tennessee at Maples.
Senior guard Candice Wiggins felt that
Stanford had an impressive enough resume to
warrant consideration for a top seed.
"We've had a great season. We beat the No.
1 ranked team in the country and did a lot of
things that we didn't do in the past," she said.
"We had a had weekend in L.A., but we've
shown where we are now. We played UCLA
yesterday, and we showed how much we've im
proved over the season."
Indeed, the Cardinal's 78-45 drubbing of
the Bruins on Saturday,coupled with an earlier
75-62 win at Maples, showed that the early Jan
uary loss in Westwood was more of an aberra
tion than anything else.
Stanford is now ranked No. 4 in the nation,
and ESPN bracket expert Charlie Creme has
the Cardinal slotted as a No. 1 seed.
The placement won't be official for another
week, but there's a good chance that the Stan
ford women are looking at their first No. 1
seeding in the NCAA Tournament since 2005.
