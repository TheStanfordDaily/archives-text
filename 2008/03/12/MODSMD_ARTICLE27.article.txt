### KENAN JIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With one of the most impressive
streaks in all of the NCAA, the Stanford
men's swim team won the Pac-10 Swim
ming Championships for the 27th straight
year this past weekend in Long Beach.
Calif.The Cardinal faced stiff competition
from the likes of Arizona and Cal.
Stanford finished well ahead of the
Wildcats and Bears though, with 865
points to Cal's 769 and Arizona's 748.5.
"Stanford is always competing for a
national title," said junior Dan Priestly.
"There is always a chance, and never a
guaranteeâ€”The underclassmen have re
ally stepped up and made this team a con
tender."
Sophomore Eugene Godsoe was the
lone backstroker for Stanford in the com
petition, placing fourth in the 200 back
stroke and third in the 100 backstroke to
Arizona's Albert Subirats, last year's
NCAA champion in the event. He also
finished behind Cal's David Russell, who
had the nation's fastest time coming into
last week's championships.
"Performing this well at the Pac-10
Championships is a great sign for
NCAAs," freshman Joshua Charnin-
Aker said. "All of our qualifiers have pre
pared themselves to peak at the national
championships, so this meet is simply a
springboard."
The breaststroke squad had an expect
edly dominating swim in the 200 breast as
junior Paul Kornfeld took first. Freshman
John Criste finished second and juniors
Chris Ash, Paul Zaitch and Nate Cass
fourth, sixth and seventh, respectively.
Kornfeld won both the 100 and 200
breaststroke events while also swimming
on the Stanford relays. He was named
Athlete of the Meet.
Senior Daniel Beal won the 200 fly
while freshman Austin Staab won the 100
fly in 45.36, tying a school record. Staab
also swam 19.97 in the fly leg of the 200
medley relay, one of the fastest relay splits
in history.
Sophomore David Dunford placed
ninth in the 50 free while splitting an in
credible 18.98 on the 200 free relay
"His performance was outstanding
and inspiring," Cass said of Dunford. "It's
a testimony to the strength of the team as
well as to his commitment to detail and
perfection in all aspects."
Despite the team's near-perfect execu
tion, Stanford has its work cut out for it at
the upcoming NCAA championship.
Stanford has ten automatic qualifiers
for NCAAs: freshman David Mosko.
Ash, Beal, Cass, Criste, Jason Dunford,
Godsoe, Kornfeld, Staab and Zaich. The
team also has qualified five relay squads,
with several other 'B' cuts pending for
qualification.
