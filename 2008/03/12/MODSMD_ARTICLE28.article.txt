# Card women bounce back
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Championship seasons are about
more than talent and ability; they re
quire the heart and chemistry of a
fully-meshed team.
After losing three matches before
winter quarter's end, there were plen
ty of questions about the No. 6 Stan
ford women's tennis team and its abil
ity to reclaim a championship title.
Fortunately for the young Cardinal
squad, an epiphany came in the form
of a breakout weekend with wins over
No. 13 Arizona State and No. 63 Ari
zona, marking the team's first three
win week this season.
With the wins, Stanford extended
its regular-season home victory streak
to 100 straight matches after legging
out a prolonged five-game road trip.
The homestand certainly couldn't
have come at a better time, according
to sophomore Lindsay Burdette.
"It was unbelievable," Burdette
said. "We had a lot of people out to the
matches this weekend, and the weath
er was beautiful and the energy was
great from our team as well as the fans.
We knew that this was our last match
before the long break and I think that
really helped us put everything we had
into the matches this weekend."
On Friday, the Cardinal defeated
Arizona 7-0 for its second shutout of
the season.
Stanford blanked the Wildcats with
a doubles sweep and two 6-0,6-0 wins
by Burdette and junior Jessica
Nguyen.
"We came out with a really strong
doubles point, which was great," Bur
dette said." We knew that Arizona was
going to be the weaker team to Ari
zona State but it didn't matter. We still

really needed to solidify our lineup
and we took care of business."
Against a strong ASU squad, the
Cardinal continued its intensity with
another doubles sweep leading to a 6-
1 win on Saturday.
Playing in front of the home crowd,
freshman Jennifer Yen clinched the
match with a 6-2,6-1 win at the No. 6
spot.
"That match was where we really
played our best against a strong team,
which raised our level even higher,"
Burdette said. "Hilary and I really
came together in doubles for the first
time — we hit that one match where
everything was clicking. In singles,
everyone carried it all out on the
courts and adjusted to their opponent.
We really got to see what we can do
when we play well."
The weekend was certainly a relief
for a Cardinal team searching for con
sistency amidst numerous injuries and
turnover.
"In light of that, it really showed us
how we can be when we have every
thing together," Burdette said. "It was
positive on a lot of levels."
Despite three losses already this
season, Stanford is still in contention
for the Pac-10 title and perhaps more.
With a topsy-turvy shuffle of the top
squads in the conference, nothing has
been decided yet.
"Usually the team is meshed and
ready to go in January, but the one pos
itive thing about this season is that
there is no one dominant team with a
perfect record," Burdette said. "So, we
have as much of a chance as anyone to
win — we just need to work hard and
keep that in mind."
In the same week that head coach
Lele Forood earned her 200 th victory
at the program's helm, the Cardinal

earned its 100 th straight regular home
win on the Farm.
Including postseason play, Stan
ford is 126-0 over the last nine years at
Taube Tennis Center.
"It's not as difficult as it sounds be
cause we have such a great group and
we have a sense of what is expected of
us and such confidence that we can
accomplish that," Burdette said. "I
guess we didn't feel like it was in jeop
ardy because we don't necessarily
worry about stuff like that. We don't
really think about it that way and
we're going out there one match at a
time.
With Dead Week and finals com
ing up, Stanford will go on a two-week
hiatus in match play.
The Cardinal will start up again

over spring break against Cal-Poly on
Mar. 24. Until then, the players will
have the opportunity to work on their
games.
"One of the biggest things that
we're going to be focusing on between
now and Mar. 24 is our physical condi
tioning," Burdette said."Since we'll be
hitting a little bit less than normal in
the next two weeks, we're going to re
ally up the physical stuff. Once we get
back into the season, it's going to be
much more difficult to push it in that
area."
Hopefully for the Stanford
women, the weekend that was will be
a harbinger of w hat's yet to come.
