# MEN SEEDED NO. 2
## Stanford looks to Pac-10 Tournament after USC loss 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Assume, for a moment, that you are Stanford coach
Trent Johnson. It's November, and your team is readying
for a new season, returning its core rotation but rebound
ing from a disappointing showing in the Pac-10 and
NCAA tournaments. Imagine, then, that someone from
the future tells you that, come March, your team will be
24-6, ranked No. 11 in the nation and second in the con
ference as it prepares for the Pac-lOTournament.
"I would have felt that we had probably come up a lit
tle short," said Johnson, who also was named Pac-10
Coach of the Year this week. "The last time I felt this way
about a team as a head coach was my fifth year in Neva
da."
TTiat year. Johnson's last before becoming head coach
at Stanford, the Wolfpack made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
This year, Johnson's fourth on the Farm, the Cardinal is
gearing up for the stretch run, starting with the Pac-10
Tournament Thursday in Los Angeles.
Stanford will face the winner of Wednesday night's
showing between seven-seed Arizona (18-13, 8-10 Pac
-10) and ten-seed Oregon State (6-24,0-18).The Cardinal
won both games against both teams this season but must
exorcise the memories of last season's disappointing
showing in the Tournament, an 83-79 overtime loss to
USC in its first game.
This year, the team is older and wiser. Having been
through last season's ups and downs, including the subse
quent first-round 78-58 blowout at the hands of
Louisville in the NCAA Tournament. Stanford knows
what lies ahead.
"I think they're more relaxed because they know
they'll be playing (in the NCAA Tournament next
week]," Johnson said. "I think last year, more than any
thing, there was an excitement... there was some pres
sure that they put on themselves.
"1 think it goes back to experience," Johnson added.
"I'd like to think the kids are more relaxed.This game on
Thursday is not going to make or break us."
Stanford has an NCAA bid locked up, but a strong
showing in the Pac-10 Tournament could do wonders for
its seeding, which is likely to fall anywhere between a
two- and a four-seed.
"It's huge," junior guard Mitch Johnson said of the
conference tournament. "It's momentum going into

NCAA Tournament. We definitely want to get the win
ning feeling hack, that taste back in our mouths."
Right now. that taste registers somewhere between
sour and bitter. Thursday's letdown in overtime to
UCLA and Saturday's poor performance at USC hand
ed the Cardinal its first losing streak of the season.Thurs
day's contest, marred by a controversial call that led to
the overtime, cost Stanford its chance for its first regular
season Pac-1() title since the 2003-2004 campaign.
