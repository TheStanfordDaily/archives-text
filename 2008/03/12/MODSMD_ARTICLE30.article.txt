# Fencers prep for NCAAs
## 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford fencing squad will
look to improve on last year's ninth
place finish when it travels to Ohio
State University in Columbus to com
pete in this year's NCAA Champi
onships. Competition begins Thursday
and will run through Sunday.
ITie Cardinal will be sending five
men and two women to this week
end's individual championships. Al
though there will be three individual
championships for both the men and
women in the three different weapon
categories (foil, epee and sabre), the
team will be able to combine its indi
vidual scores in contending for a
team national title.
The men will be led by junior Clay
ton Kenney (epee). sophomore Phil
Arredondo (foil),senior Richard Ful
ton (foil) and freshman sabre duo
Lucas Janson and Max Murphy.
Junior co-captain Eva Jellison
and sophomore Sarah Parker will
represent the women. Both will be
competing in the sabre.
The Cardinal will be at a disad
vantage in trying to win the team na
tional championship — many teams
who qualified 12 fencers will have
more opportunities to score points.
ITiat said. Jellison still has high hopes
as her team prepares for the start of
tomorrow's championships.
"The team has a very solid shot,"

she said. "[A] top-ten finish is very
likely. We'll see if we can get ahead of
some of the teams that have more
qualifiers than us."
In particular. Jellison is eager to
see the performances of freshmen
Janson and Murphy in the sabre.
"I definitely [expect] a good,strong
finish from our freshman sabreists,"
said Jellison. "If they have an 'on' day
they can both go really far. I'm excited
to see what they can pull out."
As a whole, the Cardinal boasts a
very young squad; its three co-cap
tains jellison, Brittany Leader and
Dan TUcker are all juniors. Further,
two of the team's seven qualifiers for
the NCAAs were freshmen.
"It's a relatively young team," Jel
lison said. "It was surprising how well
the team was able to gel [this year],
work hard and put up some really
good numbers. It was a really good
season over all — people worked re
ally hard. It just shows that next sea
son will probably be even better."
While an NCAA title this week
end is an improbability — "It's pret
ty impossible to win a team champi
onship without a full team," Jellison
said — the team will be looking to
gain valuable developmental experi
ence for the coming years.The Cardi
nal looks to cement its 2008 season
with a strong showing this weekend.
