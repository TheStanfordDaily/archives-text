# No. 2 Stanford edged by top-ranked Bruins
## 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming into this past weekend, it
was easy to tell that the No. 2 Stan
ford women's water polo team was
excited about its rematch with No. 1
UCLA.Their first matchup had been
a classic, as the Bruins pulled out a
sudden death overtime victory.
Stanford once again fell to the un
defeated Bruins, this time by the score
of 9-7, which almost mirrors the 8-7
outcome of the teams' first meeting.
But there was also good news to come
from the weekend, as Stanford picked
up three additional victories by the
combined score of 40-11.
The team started its So Cal swing
on Friday against UC-Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos came into the game
ranked No. 17 in the nation, but had
lost nine straight games.
The Card started the game on fire,
staking a 4-0 lead after one period
and doubling it to 8-0 by halftime.The
score would run to 10-0 before the
Gauchos scored their first goal in the
third quarter, and the game would

finish at 14-2.
Junior Lauren Silver led the way
in the rout, matching her season high
of five goals. Fellow junior Kira Hill
man was also able to outscore the
UCSB team, notching three goals,
while sophomore Kelsey Holshouser
added two of her own. Freshman
Amber Oland had a strong game in
the cage, stopping eight shots.
After its dismantling of the first
ranked opponent if faced, the Card was
ready to face the only team in the na
tion ranked above them: UCLA. The
team had confidence after the way they
played the Bruins in their first
matchup, and they knew that they cer
tainly had a chance of being the first
team to knock them oft this season.
Both teams came out on the at
tack to start the game, each finishing
the first period with three goals. The
Bruins took control in the second
quarter through, shutting out the
Cardinal and adding three more
goals of their own to bring the half
time score to 6-3.
However, Stanford would not go
awav. Silver scored back-to-back

goals to begin the third period and
bring the difference back to one, 6-5.
The teams then traded goals before
the end of the quarter to make the
score 7-6 in favor of UCLA.The Bru
ins scored first in the fourth period,
but Stanford again answered with a
goal of its own to make it 8-7.
As hard as it tried though, the Card
could not find an equalizer. UCLA
was able to add an insurance goal with
3:44 remaining, and the game would
end at 9-7. Silver, Hillman. and junior
Heather West all ended the game with
two goals, while sophomore Alex
Koran chipped in with one.
It was another tough loss for the
Cardinal, and although they played
well again, head coach John Tanner
thought the game came down to a few
key errors.
"I was pleased with our effort, but
we made some significant mistakes at
both ends of the pool that led to qual
ity scoring chances for UCLA," said
Tanner. "And we didn't make enough
plays to bail ourselves out of those sit
uations."
The team did not have time to

dwell on missed opportunities
though, as they had two more match
es to play on Sunday, one against
Pomona-Pitzer in the morning, and
the other against Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps in the afternoon.
The Card took out its frustration
on its Division 111 opponents, win
ning its first match 11-5 and the sec
ond one 15-4. The team showed good
offensive balance as nine different
players scored in the first game, and
10 in the latter. Freshman Chelsea
Smith-Carmichael collected her first
hat trick in the second game, while
fellow freshman Kim Hall stopped a
total of 15 shots.
Overall, it was good for the Cardi
nal to end the weekend on a winning
note, as the team's next game isn't
until Mar. 24. And although UCLA
was able to prove itself as the top
team in the country, Stanford has
served notice that this season's race
for the title, at the very least, will be a
two-horse race.
