## Stanford gets revenge on Cal on Senior Night 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team proved its
mettle once again, asserting that it is the team to
beat. The top-ranked Cardinal avenged an early
season loss to California last Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion.edging the Golden Bears by a nar
row 356.150-355.650 margin.
Stanford's win was all the more impressive con
sidering the squad was once again without stars
Dave Sender and Sho Nakamori. The pair were
given the night off after recently returning from Na
tional Team duty at the 2008 World Cup.
It was Senior Night for the Cardinal, and the
team's six seniors — Eli Alcaraz. Dylan Carney,
Chris Harper. Nakamori, Sender and Jason Shen
were honored before the competition for their aca
demic and athletic accomplishments.
The six have big plans beyond their Stanford ca
reers on the mats: Alcaraz will be finishing his de
gree and applying to law school; Carney has been
admitted to Stanford Medical School: Harper will
be working at a local law firm and applying to law
school; Nakamori will compete for the U.S. Nation
al Team and Stanford in his final year of eligibility;
Sender will by applying to veterinary school; and

Shen will he pursuing a co-terminal master's degree
at Stanford.
The Cardinal started competition on floor exercise
and had stellar routines from Carney (third place.
15.500), freshman Josh Dixon (second. 15.550) and
sophomore Greg Ter-Zakhariants (first. 15.850).Ter-
Zakhariants is currently ranked first in the nation on
floor, and he solidified his ranking with another fine
performance on Saturday.
Stanford struggled on pommel horse, though
Harper came in second with a solid score of 15.000.
Cal senior Tim McNeil won the event with a 15.400.
McNeil, the NCAA champ on the horse in 2006 and
2007. wowed the crowd with a perfectly executed
Full Kher. a skill requiring the athlete to complete a
360 degree spin on the apparatus while supported
by only one arm.
"If I'm going to lose to someone, I don't mind los
ing to a two-time NCAA champion," Harper said of
McNeil after the meet.
The Cardinal went to still rings next, where strong
sets from junior Bryant Madden and freshman Tim
Gentry helped build the team's lead. Gentry is ranked
sixth in the NCAA on rings, and his score of 15.150 was
tops in the event. Stanford continued to roll after mov
ing on to the vault vault, sweeping the event with top
scores from Ter-Zakhariants (15.950). Dixon (16.000)

and Carney (16.050).
Stanford had a commanding lead of 239.8(H) to
235.150 after four rotations. But after sub-par per
formances on horizontal bar, the Cardinal almost
allowed the Bears to stage an incredible comeback.
While Stanford put up a mediocre team score of
58.250 on high bar, Cal hit their sets and put up a
huge score of 61.400 on parallel bars.
"1 think [the team] got a little too comfortable
going into the last event," said coach Thorn Glielmi.
The Bears are the top team in the nation on par
allel bars and they proved it on Saturday Stanford
went into the final event with close to a four-point
cushion, but Cal quickly narrowed the margin by
sweeping parallel bars. Junior Tyson Bunthuwong
came in third with a 15.350. and seniors Tim McNeil
and Colin Christ tied for first with scores of 15.450.
Carney had a good high bar routine that earned
him a 15.000. and the team's early lead gave them
just enough breathing room to come out with a win.
It was Stanford's fifth consecutive win. and the team
was able to avenge its only loss of the season after
falling at Cal in January.
The team's next competition will be the "Cardi
nal vs. White" Alumni Meet on Mar. 29.
