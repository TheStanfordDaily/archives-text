## Cardinal men earn split in Arizona desert 
### DANNY BELCH STAFF WRITER 
After pulling out a close victory on
Friday against No. 36 Arizona, the
Stanford men's tennis team fell in the
same fashion on Saturday to No. 26
Arizona State. The No. 32 Cardinal
left the desert with a split and its
record now standing at 5-6 on the sea
son.
On Friday against the Wildcats, the
doubles point came down to three
close matches.The No. 48 ranked Ari
zona team of Claudio Christen and
Jay Goldman defeated junior Blake
Muller and freshman Alex Clayton at
No. 1 doubles, 9-7. Bruno Alcala and
Ravid Hazi beat junior Matt Bruch
and freshman Ted Kelly in a tiebreak
er at No. 2 doubles, 9-8 (4). The same
went for freshman Greg Hirshman
and sophomore Richard Wire at No. 3
doubles, but they were able to prevent
the Arizona sweep by winning 9-8 (8).
With Arizona up 1-0, Stanford
quickly fought back with victories at
No. 1 and No. 2 singles. Clayton beat
Goldman at No. 1,7-5,6-3 and Bruch
defeated Christen at No. 2, 6-4, 6-3.
The next two matches went to Ari
zona, however, as Wire and senior
Phil Kao both lost straight set match
es at the No. 3 and No. 5 singles spots,
respectively.
With the Wildcats ahead, 3-2,
Muller came back from a set down to
cruise to victory against Alcala at No.
4 singles. 3-6,6-2,6-3.
For the second time this season,
the match was up to freshman Greg
Hirshman at the No. 6 spot. Hirshman
again delivered as he did two weeks
ago, battling back from a second set
loss to pull out the third set and secure
the victory for Stanford, 4-3.
"We let the doubles point slip
away," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "But the guys put it be
hind them and went out and won four
singles matches, which is not an easy
thing to do on the road.
'Til take a 4-3 win at Arizona any

day."
The Cardinal was not as fortunate
on Saturday, losing a very close match
to Arizona State, 4-3. The Sun Devils
won the doubles point with victories
at No. 2 and No. 3 doubles. Clayton
and Bruch, however, again swept
through their opponents at No. 1 and
2 singles, respectively. Clayton defeat
ed Matt Brooklyn 4-6,6-1.6-4 for his
team-leading 19th singles victory of
the season and Brooklyn's first singles
loss this year. Bruch downed Andres
Arango, 6-1,6-3. while Kao bounced
back from Friday's loss to beat Ari
zona State's Wes Miller at No. 5 sin
gles for Stanford's third point.
Those were all the points the Car
dinal would get, however, as Wire,
Muller, and Hirshman fell at No. 3,4,
and 6 singles, respectively. Stanford's
record is now 5-6, while Arizona is 10-
3 and Arizona State improved to 9-0
on the season.
"We got away with [losing the dou
bles point] on Friday, but not on Sat
urday," Whitlinger said.
"It was a great effort by Phil Kao,"
he continued. "He has struggled a bit
this year. He came back from [a loss
Friday]. 1 give him a lot of credit.
"This trip is always one of the
tougher trips of the year," Whitlinger
said. "Overall the guys fought hard
and competed well."
Stanford will take two weeks off
for finals before returning to the court
during Spring Break. The Cardinal
plays three home matches during the
break: a non-conference match
against Brown University on March
24 and then a rematch against the Ari
zona schools on March 28 and 29 in
what will be the Pac-10 openers for
the teams.
"The guys are pretty motivated for
Arizona State," Whitlinger said. "[Al
though] we don't want to look past
Brown, the guys have Arizona State
circled on their calendar."
