# CARD FALLS TO USC
## Stanford closes Pac-10 season with two losses 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Galen Center was going
crazy for their Trojans, 77-64 victors
over Stanford in what might well
have been the final home game for
O.J. Mayo, Davon Jefferson and Taj
Gibson. But Cardinal coach Trent
Johnson, 100 feet and a world apart,
stood alone outside Stanford's lock
er room. He crossed his arms, paced
back and forth and tried to come to
grips with what he just saw.
USC (20-10,11-7 Pac-10), quicker
than the Cardinal (24-6, 13-5) at
every position, used that speed ad
vantage to drive into the lane against
Stanford's backcourt with impunity,
dishing to open teammates for easy
buckets when the defense collapsed.
Mayo, one of the nation's most
hyped freshman, led the way with 25
points, but four Trojans reached dou
ble figures, and USC out-rebounded
Stanford 47-31 in a game they just

seemed to want more.
"I don't like losing," said a testy
coach Johnson, whose team has
dropped two straight for the first
time since its road trip to L.A. last
season. "That's the bottom line."
Mayo (25 points, 16 after halftime,
and 8 rebounds) ensured Stanford's
defeat with a sublime stretch of play
eight minutes into the second half.
First, he pick-pocketed senior for
ward Fred Washington (no points, 3
fouls, 6 minutes) for an uncontested
dunk, then he found forward Davon
Jefferson (11 points) for an alley-oop
that earned a standing ovation, and,
for a finale, added a jumper of his
own. The 7-0 run put USC ahead 58-
45 with 9:22 to go, and Stanford
would come no closer than 9 the rest
of the way.
"I know everyone's going to say
and think this, but I don't think it was
letdown," said junior point guard
Mitch Johnson, whose squad lost a
shot at the Pac-10 regular season
championship in a Thursday night
overtime heartbreaker at UCLA.
"Today was its own game, and no one
spoke about UCLA. They just came
out as aggressors and hit big shots."
Stanford was clobbered down low
when the contest was still in doubt in

the first half. USC outrebounded the
Cardinal 25-12 and 10-2 on the offen
sive glass and outscored Stanford 22-
10 in the paint on the half. Center Taj
Gibson (20 points, 9-of-13 shooting,
11 rebounds) led the way with 12
points and 6 rebounds.
"Our biggest positive is rebound
ing, and today was not a good day in
that department," said Mitch John
son (3 points, l-of-6 shooting).
"That's our staple: defense, but real
ly, really rebounding. 1 bet every
game we've won against a good
team, we outrebounded them, but we
got our butts kicked today."
The Trojans deployed a turnover
inducing full-court press and em
ployed constant dribble-drive pene
tration to jump to a 20-6 lead. Junior
walk-on guard Kenny Brown (19
points, 6-of-12, 4-of-8 deep) hit two
threes and a layup to propel Stanford
to an 11-1 run, closing the deficit to
23-19 11 minutes in. But forward
Dwight Lewis' (12 points) three with
10 seconds left in the first period
gave the Trojans a 39-31 halftime
lead they would not relinquish.
"1 don't know if we were neces
sarily tired," Mitch Johnson said. "I
just don't think we were reading and
reacting. 1 think we started thinking

too much."
Trent Johnson was whistled for a
technical with USC ahead 73-60 and
1:13 remaining; it was his third of the
season. Visibly frustrated after the
game, he asked his staff to track
down Bill McCabe, the Pac-10 Coor
dinator of Men's Basketball Officiat
ing.
Stanford has now lost nine
straight in the greater Los Angeles
area, with its last win in L. A. coming
three years ago. The Cardinal will
look to snap that streak this Thurs
day night, when it enters the Pac-10
Tournament as the No. 2 seed.
The team will face the winner of
today's bout between Arizona (18-
13, 8-10) and Oregon State (6-24, 0-
18) at the Staples Center at 8:30 p.m.
If the seedings hold up, Stanford will
face Washington State (23-7,11-7) in
Friday's 8:30 p.m. semi-final, and will
get another shot at UCLA (28-3,16-
2) in Sunday's 3 p.m. final.
"I am very confident in this team's
resiliency," Brown said. "That's dif
ferent than some of our other teams.
We will take upon ourselves to be ac
countable for this loss."
