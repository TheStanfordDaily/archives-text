# STUDENT GROUPS
## Three groups fail to make special fees ballot 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
The special fees petitioning period
came to a close Monday at noon. The
Elections Commission extended the
deadline, which had originally been
set for Friday Mar. 7. Although this
extension did ensure placement on
the ballot for most petitioning groups,
a few campus organizations were un
able to meet the signature quota.
The Stanford Comedy Club, Stan
ford Students in Entertainment
(SSIE) and Stanford C heerleading ul
timately did not qualify for placement
on the special fees ballot. While SSIH
and Cheerleading were both 2(XJ-3(X)
signatures short of their minimum
quota, the Comedy Club had only 2(X)
of the requisite 2,2(X) signatures.
"[The Stanford Comedy Club] was
one of two groups that had to collect
15 percent of total Stanford student
population â€” undergraduate and

graduate combined," said ASSU
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Woessner "10.
Woessner believed that despite
the initial Web site glitch that forced
him to restart the petitioning process,
all student groups were able to recov
er from the setback.
"I don't think that for any of [the
organizations] it was the Web site
glitch [that was the problem]," Woess
ner added, 'in the case of Stanford
Comedy Club they were never able to
come together and organize and get
as many signatures as they could. Part
of that was confusion as to when the
Web site opened and how long it was
going to be open for.
There wasn't a lot of internal com
munication between members."
Comedy Club President Melahn
Parker, a graduate student in aero
nautics and astronautics, explained
that confusion regarding the opening
of the petitioning Web site and the

extra signature requirements for joint
groups led to the club's inability to ob
tain the required signatures.
"The main problem was that we
were kept in the dark on when the site
would open," Parker said. "Joint
groups get one week less to collect sig
natures than undergrad groups. Joint
groups need to collect more than
twice the number of signatures as un
dergrad-only groups."
Parker said that the Comedy Club
lost the two first days of petitioning
due to the confusion surrounding the
opening of the Web site. Furthermore,
after being told that special fees or
ganizations would not receive an ex
tension, the Comedy Club stopped
looking for signatures.
"We did not undertake our signa
ture effort," Parker continued. "Over
all, I do not think the process was very
encouraging for petitioning groups."
As for Cheerleading and SSIE,
Woessner believed that these groups

may not have advertised enough dur
ing the petitioning period. These two
groups were only able to collect about
half of their required signatures.
For other groups, however, the
deadline extension was much needed.
Woessner added that without the
extra three days, an additional four
groups would have not made the elec
tions ballot.
'The extension was most definite
ly necessary as we were missing about
100 [signatures] at the Friday date,"
said Tommy Tobin' 10, business editor
of the Stanford Journal of Interna
tional Relations."lf we had not gotten
on the ballot, we would have been in
quite the rut concerning funding."
The organizations that met their
petitioning requirements will be
voted on for Special Fees during the
Apr. 9 and 10 elections.
