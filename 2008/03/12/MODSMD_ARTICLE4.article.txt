# Hennessy, senator at odds over endowment
## President opposes Congress' efforts to regulate spending 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The combination of rapidly growing endowments and
increasing tuition costs at universities around the country
has drawn recent scrutiny from Congress,which has threat
ened to remove the tax-exempt status of endowments if
they fall below a minimum annual spending requirement
similar to those placed on non-profit foundations.
Stanford President John Hennessy told The Daily he
opposes any attempt by Congress to introduce legislation
that would tell universities how to spend their endow
ments.
"I oppose it for two reasons," Hennessy said. "We have
legally binding agreements with donors as to how we
spend the money, [and] we have a permanent time scale,so
no matter what happens, we still have a university."
Senator Chuck CJrassley (R-Iowa) along with Senator
Max Baucus "63, J.D. '67 (D-Montana) sent letters last

month to 136 universities with endowments greater than
$500 million, including Stanford, asking for data about en
dowment spending, tuition and financial aid. The Senate
Finance Committee, of which Baucus is chair and (Jrassley
is the ranking member, also held a hearing tin the topic.
" 1 just want colleges to be aware of the fact that the pur
poses of college are teaching, educating and research, and
that the money ought to be used for that purpose," Grass
ley said Monday in a conference call with Ihe 1 )aily."A col
lege endowment should not be a storehouse of funds."
Stanford's endowment grew 22 percent last year to
$17.2 billion, while next year's tuition also increased by 3.5
percent to $36,030.
Stanford, along with other universities, uses a sophisti
cated "smoothing formula" that lowers the actual endow
ment payout below the target payout in years (if exception
al investment performance and increases actual payout
above the target payout in lean years in an effort to pro
duce a steady payout level. While Stanford has set target
payout levels of 5 percent or more in each of the last 10
years,actual payout has fallen below 5 percent six times in
that period.
Hennessy said the practice is essential to the I Jniversi
ty's permanent timescale.
"You have these great endowment
years, but you also have some lousy
years," I lennessy said, referring to the
1970s,"and you don't want to set a rate
based on just great years."
Hennessy said that the rules that
apply to foundations should not be ex
tended to universities because of their
permanent timescale.
"If the Ford Foundation goes bank
rupt. that's not a disaster," he said. "If
Stanford ran out of money, then that
would be a disaster."
Grassley did not agree with Hen
nessy's explanation of current endow
ment spending practices.
"It seems to me that there is one
thing that endowments have over foun
dations" Grassley said. "They continue
to have money coming in. while most
f< mndations d( > n< >t have m< iney coming
in."
Grassley said that the threat of ptx)r
investment years in the future is not a
valid excuse for limiting endowment
spending, especially because of the
tremendous growth among university
endowments and the enormous wealth
that they have accumulated.The top 20
university endowments add up to al
most $200 billion.

"lf you've got a down time,instead of
20 percent growth if you have 5 percent
growth, there could be some expendi
ture of principal until you get a chance to
build it back up,"Grassley said.
Stanford's Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston explained that al
though the smix)thing formula seems
counterintuitive — as it results in small
er payments during good years and larg
er payments in bad ones — it is neces
sary to achieve budget stability.
"If we simply try to keep spending
constant from one year to the next, then
in a year when the value went way up.
those [base| expenditures would be a
small percentage of the endowment,
and when value goes down, the expen
ditures would be a large percentage of
the endowment," Livingston said.
Livingston added that it was impor
tant that base operating expenditures
represent a relatively constant portion
of endowment spending so that faculty
salaries and other key expenses do not
fluctuate with the market.
Another point of conflict between
colleges and Congress is the restrictions
placed on endowments. In its response
to the Senate 112 inance Committee in
quiry, the University said that over 70
percent of endowment funds are re
stricted by donors to particular uses.
"The endowment is not one big ac
count with a lot of cash in it: there are
thousands of funds." Hennessy said.
"Congress could say,' Spend on Finan

cial Aid,' but that would require us to
violate contractual agreements [with
donors]."
Grassley disputed the notion that
spending restrictions tie the hands of
University officials
"1 think that you've got to realize
that endowments have a lot of flexibil
ity. even though there is a lot of desig
nated giving," Grassley said. "Even
though 99 percent might be [restrict
ed). even if you take 1 percent of your
endowment that's still a lot of money,
I'll bet,and don't forget that probably a
lot of that 99 percent was donated for
student aid, as well."
Livingston agreed with Grassley in
that the University does retain some
flexibility with the 30 percent of the en
dowment that is not restricted. But he
emphasized that when you redistribute
money to particular causes, you must
make sacrifices elsewhere.
" Ihere is no free lunch here," Liv
ingston said. "Any time we increase al
location of money to one area, we have
to say what do we take away from. Al
though there is widespread support for
the improved Financial Aid package,
we wouldn't do that at the expense of
cutting back faculty, or other things."
Grassley was optimistic that the
Senate inquiry into endowment spend
ing will lead universities to make
changes on their own and that legisla
tion will not be necessary. Several top
universities have already made signifi

cant changes to their financial aid pro
grams. with Stanford eliminating tu
ition for all families earning less than
$100,000 a year.
"1 n the six years I've been investigat
ing non-profits and just recently this
higher education aspect, we have seen a
lot of self-correcting," Grassley said,
"and so the extent to which your Presi
dent [Hennessy] would not like to have
[legislation] exactly the same as for
foundations then to the extent which
[universities] continue to help students
with their endowments as opposed to
other uses of the endowments, I think
there is less chance that Congress
would legislate."
Grassley strongly believes that in
creasing endowment spending is in the
best interest of universities.
"Colleges and universities who tap
endowment dollars to help more stu
dents access top-notch education are
investing in the American Dream."
Grassley said. "That American Dream
is going to keep these colleges and uni
versities going."
But President Hennessy is not sure
that members of Congress fully under
stand the complexities of endowment
management.
"We've got to do a lot of education
for people in Congress about how en
dowments work," he said.

would be a disaster."
Grassley did not agree with Hen
nessy's explanation of current endow
ment spending practices.
"It seems to me that there is one
thing that endowments have over foun
dations" Grassley said. "They continue
to have money coming in. while most
f< mndations d( > n< >t have m< iney coming
in."
Grassley said that the threat of ptx)r
investment years in the future is not a
valid excuse for limiting endowment
spending, especially because of the
tremendous growth among university
endowments and the enormous wealth
that they have accumulated.The top 20
university endowments add up to al
most $200 billion.

"lf you've got a down time,instead of
20 percent growth if you have 5 percent
growth, there could be some expendi
ture of principal until you get a chance to
build it back up,"Grassley said.
Stanford's Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston explained that al
though the smix)thing formula seems
counterintuitive — as it results in small
er payments during good years and larg
er payments in bad ones — it is neces
sary to achieve budget stability.
"If we simply try to keep spending
constant from one year to the next, then
in a year when the value went way up.
those [base| expenditures would be a
small percentage of the endowment,
and when value goes down, the expen
ditures would be a large percentage of
the endowment," Livingston said.
Livingston added that it was impor
tant that base operating expenditures
represent a relatively constant portion
of endowment spending so that faculty
salaries and other key expenses do not
fluctuate with the market.
Another point of conflict between
colleges and Congress is the restrictions
placed on endowments. In its response
to the Senate 112 inance Committee in
quiry, the University said that over 70
percent of endowment funds are re
stricted by donors to particular uses.
"The endowment is not one big ac
count with a lot of cash in it: there are
thousands of funds." Hennessy said.
"Congress could say,' Spend on Finan

cial Aid,' but that would require us to
violate contractual agreements [with
donors]."
Grassley disputed the notion that
spending restrictions tie the hands of
University officials
"1 think that you've got to realize
that endowments have a lot of flexibil
ity. even though there is a lot of desig
nated giving," Grassley said. "Even
though 99 percent might be [restrict
ed). even if you take 1 percent of your
endowment that's still a lot of money,
I'll bet,and don't forget that probably a
lot of that 99 percent was donated for
student aid, as well."
Livingston agreed with Grassley in
that the University does retain some
flexibility with the 30 percent of the en
dowment that is not restricted. But he
emphasized that when you redistribute
money to particular causes, you must
make sacrifices elsewhere.
" Ihere is no free lunch here," Liv
ingston said. "Any time we increase al
location of money to one area, we have
to say what do we take away from. Al
though there is widespread support for
the improved Financial Aid package,
we wouldn't do that at the expense of
cutting back faculty, or other things."
Grassley was optimistic that the
Senate inquiry into endowment spend
ing will lead universities to make
changes on their own and that legisla
tion will not be necessary. Several top
universities have already made signifi

cant changes to their financial aid pro
grams. with Stanford eliminating tu
ition for all families earning less than
$100,000 a year.
"1 n the six years I've been investigat
ing non-profits and just recently this
higher education aspect, we have seen a
lot of self-correcting," Grassley said,
"and so the extent to which your Presi
dent [Hennessy] would not like to have
[legislation] exactly the same as for
foundations then to the extent which
[universities] continue to help students
with their endowments as opposed to
other uses of the endowments, I think
there is less chance that Congress
would legislate."
Grassley strongly believes that in
creasing endowment spending is in the
best interest of universities.
"Colleges and universities who tap
endowment dollars to help more stu
dents access top-notch education are
investing in the American Dream."
Grassley said. "That American Dream
is going to keep these colleges and uni
versities going."
But President Hennessy is not sure
that members of Congress fully under
stand the complexities of endowment
management.
"We've got to do a lot of education
for people in Congress about how en
dowments work," he said.

The combination of rapidly growing endowments and
increasing tuition costs at universities around the country
has drawn recent scrutiny from Congress,which has threat
ened to remove the tax-exempt status of endowments if
they fall below a minimum annual spending requirement
similar to those placed on non-profit foundations.
Stanford President John Hennessy told The Daily he
opposes any attempt by Congress to introduce legislation
that would tell universities how to spend their endow
ments.
"I oppose it for two reasons," Hennessy said. "We have
legally binding agreements with donors as to how we
spend the money, [and] we have a permanent time scale,so
no matter what happens, we still have a university."
Senator Chuck CJrassley (R-Iowa) along with Senator
Max Baucus "63, J.D. '67 (D-Montana) sent letters last

month to 136 universities with endowments greater than
$500 million, including Stanford, asking for data about en
dowment spending, tuition and financial aid. The Senate
Finance Committee, of which Baucus is chair and (Jrassley
is the ranking member, also held a hearing tin the topic.
" 1 just want colleges to be aware of the fact that the pur
poses of college are teaching, educating and research, and
that the money ought to be used for that purpose," Grass
ley said Monday in a conference call with Ihe 1 )aily."A col
lege endowment should not be a storehouse of funds."
Stanford's endowment grew 22 percent last year to
$17.2 billion, while next year's tuition also increased by 3.5
percent to $36,030.
Stanford, along with other universities, uses a sophisti
cated "smoothing formula" that lowers the actual endow
ment payout below the target payout in years (if exception
al investment performance and increases actual payout
above the target payout in lean years in an effort to pro
duce a steady payout level. While Stanford has set target
payout levels of 5 percent or more in each of the last 10
years,actual payout has fallen below 5 percent six times in
that period.
Hennessy said the practice is essential to the I Jniversi
ty's permanent timescale.
"You have these great endowment
years, but you also have some lousy
years," I lennessy said, referring to the
1970s,"and you don't want to set a rate
based on just great years."
Hennessy said that the rules that
apply to foundations should not be ex
tended to universities because of their
permanent timescale.
"If the Ford Foundation goes bank
rupt. that's not a disaster," he said. "If
Stanford ran out of money, then that
would be a disaster."
Grassley did not agree with Hen
nessy's explanation of current endow
ment spending practices.
