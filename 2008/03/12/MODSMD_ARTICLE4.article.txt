# Hennessy, senator at odds over endowment
## President opposes Congress' efforts to regulate spending 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The combination of rapidly growing endowments and
increasing tuition costs at universities around the country
has drawn recent scrutiny from Congress,which has threat
ened to remove the tax-exempt status of endowments if
they fall below a minimum annual spending requirement
similar to those placed on non-profit foundations.
Stanford President John Hennessy told The Daily he
opposes any attempt by Congress to introduce legislation
that would tell universities how to spend their endow
ments.
"I oppose it for two reasons," Hennessy said. "We have
legally binding agreements with donors as to how we
spend the money, [and] we have a permanent time scale,so
no matter what happens, we still have a university."
Senator Chuck CJrassley (R-Iowa) along with Senator
Max Baucus "63, J.D. '67 (D-Montana) sent letters last

month to 136 universities with endowments greater than
$500 million, including Stanford, asking for data about en
dowment spending, tuition and financial aid. The Senate
Finance Committee, of which Baucus is chair and (Jrassley
is the ranking member, also held a hearing tin the topic.
" 1 just want colleges to be aware of the fact that the pur
poses of college are teaching, educating and research, and
that the money ought to be used for that purpose," Grass
ley said Monday in a conference call with Ihe 1 )aily."A col
lege endowment should not be a storehouse of funds."
Stanford's endowment grew 22 percent last year to
$17.2 billion, while next year's tuition also increased by 3.5
percent to $36,030.
Stanford, along with other universities, uses a sophisti
cated "smoothing formula" that lowers the actual endow
ment payout below the target payout in years (if exception
al investment performance and increases actual payout
above the target payout in lean years in an effort to pro
duce a steady payout level. While Stanford has set target
payout levels of 5 percent or more in each of the last 10
years,actual payout has fallen below 5 percent six times in
that period.
Hennessy said the practice is essential to the I Jniversi
ty's permanent timescale.
