# Dawkins talks science, religion

### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Outspoken atheists Richard Dawkins and
Lawrence Krauss engaged in an unmoderated dia
logue in front of a packed Memorial Auditorium
on Sunday, discussing science education in the 21st
Century.
The pair was primarily concerned about the rise
of religiously motivated threats to traditional sci
entific curricula in American high schools, as well
as the inaccurate portrayal of scientific information
in the media.
Dawkins, chair for the Public Understanding of
Science at the University of Oxford, discussed a va
riety of concerns surrounding evolution, religion
and the public backlash against science. He debat
ed methods of changing the public mindset with
Krauss, a professor of physics and astronomy at
Case Western Reserve University.
Dawkins and Krauss held that teaching young
children about religion in Sunday School is equiva
lent to "child abuse." Krauss, however, said that it
was possible for evolution and natural selection to
co-exist with religion, while Dawkins said that his
goal was to destroy religion.
Both scholars, however, felt that science should
be taught in schools more comprehensively, with
out a religious agenda.They asserted that Darwin
ism is a "fact" and said that evolution was as much

of a fact as the existence of the table on the stage on
which they were speaking.
Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976
book, "The Selfish Gene" which popularized a
gene-centered view of evolution. His latest work,
"TTie Clod Delusion," was an international best
seller.
Krauss lectures widely on science and public
policy, and he appears regularly on commentaries
for national publications, radio and television. An
open letter he sent to Pope Benedict XVI in 2005,
urging the pontiff not to build new walls between
science and faith, sparked international controver
sy.
