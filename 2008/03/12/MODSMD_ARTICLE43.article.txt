## Stanford to help plan new Saudi university First private university set to admit students in 2009 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
The University announced last
week that it will join a team of other
schools to lay out plans for a new sci
ence and technology center in Saudi
Arabia. Engineering Prof. Peter
Glynn praised Stanford's potentially
positive impact on the nation that has
received wide public criticism for its
strict laws, particularly in regards to
women.
The King Abdullah University of
Science and Technology (KAUST),
located 50 miles north of the commer
cial capital Jeddah, is expected to
admit its first class in Sept. 2009. Each
affiliated university will aid in faculty
recruitment and development of cur
riculum at KAUST. The university's
campus, however, is still under con
struction, and faculty recruitment is at
an early stage.
Glynn, who has been involved in
the project, emphasized that, despite
Saudi Arabia's conservative social
and religious environment, KAUST
would not discriminate in its selection
of faculty or students.
Glynn added that, as the first pri
vate university in Saudi Arabia,
KAUST would not fall under the ju
risdiction of the Ministry' of Educa
tion. Ihe program will allow men and
women to mingle freely, to learn and
to conduct research in the same class
rooms and laboratories.
"This particular university has un
usually open standards in recognizing
that this kind of institution works best
by not discriminating on the basis of
race, religion and gender." Glynn said.
Glynn acknowledged that Saudi
Arabia's conservative political and
social climate might set back faculty
recruitment but said that KAUST has
financial incentives to entice distin
guished professors from around the
world.
"This university will be able to pay

extremely well," Glynn said. The
king himself donated $10 billion, and
there's additional fundraising that
goes beyond that."
KAUST's massive endowment —
larger than that of schools' like Co
lumbia University and the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology — will
also be used to recruit undergradu
ates. According to Glynn, undergrad
uates accepted into the KAUST pro
gram will have the remainder of their
entire undergraduate education paid

"Our goal is to
have a positive
impact on Saudi
Arabia."

off under an agreement by which they
must continue to pursue either a
scholarship-funded master's degree
or Ph.D. at KAUST.
"It's a really creative and innova
tive way to open the university with a
strong cohort of students," Glynn
said.
Glynn noted that raising educa
tional standards and creating a world
class institution for science and tech
nology could have a transformative
effect on the region, encouraging
greater cross-cultural interaction
through the participation of a diverse
pool of undergraduates.
"Our goal is to have a positive im
pact on Saudi Arabia and the region,"
said Glynn. "For many [partner insti
tutions] what has attracted their inter
est is having a long term impact on
Saudi Arabia."
