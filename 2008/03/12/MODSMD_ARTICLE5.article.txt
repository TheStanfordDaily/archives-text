## U.S. Secretary of Treasury defends economic policies 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
"Our economy is structurally sound [and] the long
term fundamentals are strong," said U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Paulson at the Arrillaga Alumni Center
Friday evening. Paulson's remarks came the same day
Wall Street tanked to 2006 levels amid a sluggish Febru
ary employment report that heightened fears of reces
sion.
Paulson, who delivered the keynote address to the
200K Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) Economic Summit, has recently avoided the
claim that the U.S. economy is slipping into a recession, in
stead touting the Bush administration's $152 billion stim
ulus package designed to resuscitate the economy. At the
summit, Paulson acknowledged the economic difficulty
of the times but spoke with optimism about U.S. policies.
"It is a rough time right now," Paulson said. "[But] I
can't think of other countries that don't have more prob
lems than we do, so I like our chances."
The treasury secretary's evening address to an audi
ence of California CEOs, businesspeople and University
faculty nonetheless focused on policy solutions that the
Treasury is applying to different sectors of the U.S. econ
omy.
THE HOUSING MARKET
According to Paulson, a "good year" sees about
650,000 foreclosures on mortgages, while last year faced

1.5 million and this year's estimates hover near 2 million.
Paulson said the Bush administration's approach to solv
ing the mortgage crisis is two-pronged and resists Con
gressional proposals calling for deeper involvement from
the government.
"Some in Washington are proposing big interven
tions" he said. "Most of the proposals I've seen will do
more harm than good. I still have no interest in bailing out
investors, lenders and speculators."
ITie first side of the approach relies on the stimulus
package to create more jobs and bolster the economy so
that fewer Americans suffer mortgage-threatening in
come loss.The package allows individuals to receive early
tax rebate checks, which Paulson said would most likely
be distributed fully by early July.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson discussed U.S.
economic markets in the keynote address to the 2008
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Econom
ic Summit last Friday night at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"We're working very hard now to
get the IKS ready so that they will
begin getting the payments out to the
American people as early as the first
week of May," he said.
Paulson said the focus of the ad
ministration's efforts are those home
owners who cannot afford their mort
gage payments hut want to remain in
their homes, not "speculators" who
are able to make their payments but
"choose to walk away" from them.
"As far as I'm concerned, home
owners who can afford their mort
gage, whether they have positive or
negative equity, have got an obliga
tion to honor that mortgage," Paulson
said, "and a vast majority of them do."
Although opposed to large inter
vention from Washington, Paulson
said aiding homeowners who cannot
pay their mortgages is a "shared re
sponsibility" for both outside ser
vicers and the government.
That governmental role lies not
only in the stimulus package but also
in the second side of the approach to
solve the housing crisis — the Hope
Now Alliance, created in October of
last year as a cooperative effort be
tween the government.counselors,in
vestors and lenders to aid homeown
ers who have trouble paying their
mortgages.
Servicers encouraged by the Trea
sury Department and the Depart
ment of Housing and Urban Devel
opment to form the alliance include,
but are not limited to. Bank of Amer
ica, Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase,
Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo.
"The first effort is to get to those
homeowners who are delinquent in
their payments, having problems, and
get them to talk to someone, to reach
out." Paulson said. "Before the pro
gram started, only two to three per
cent [of homeowners] were respond
ing to servicers. Now it's 20 percent.
That's a big improvement."
Paulson said the Treasury's policy
is also geared toward subprime mort
gage holders with adjustable rate
mortgages who will face resets in their
rates.
"What the industry agreed to was
a way to fast-track the modifications
and the refinancing so that we can
avoid a market failure," he said.
According to Paulson, more than a

million homeowners, 683,(KX) of them
with subprime mortgages, have re
ceived workouts, loan modifications
or repayments since July that have al
lowed them to dodge foreclosure.
Much of the government's role
also lies in maintaining the alliance
and ensuring no servicer is a free
rider.
"I am going to keep tab on the re
sult. insist that the industry make the
results transparent and make sure we
don't have any free riders." Paulson
said, "[so] that every one of the ser
vicers who signed up for this program
is going to live up to the commitments
that they have made."
CAPITAL MARKETS
Paulson attributed the crisis in the
capital markets to what he called a
"sentiment swing" among financial in
vestors and institutions.
"This time last year, we had in
vestors feeling pretty confident, look
ing for risk, reaching for yield." he
said. "Now sentiment has swung back
very, very hard toward risk aversion."
Paulson said he believes the recent
"onslaught of press articles" on eco
nomic debt has contributed to this
aversion.
To counteract the shift in investor
sentiment, Paulson told the audience
that the Treasury's focus is to encour
age financial institutions to raise more
capital and hence bolster lending
power.
"Raising capital is critical here,"
Paulson said. "If you're a financial in
stitution and you need capital or you
think you might need capital, you go
get it when it's available. And if you
don't, you're forced to shrink your
balance sheet and cut back on your
lending, and this hurts the real econo
my."
"If you need capital, go raise capi
tal and raise plenty of it." Paulson said
as advice to financial institutions.
The Treasury Secretary also said he
advocated a "balanced" policy re
sponse from Washington to help con
tain the crisis.
"When you go through a period
like this, your first priority is to get
through this period with as little
spillover as possible on the real econ
omy," he said. "It's very important to
come up with a policy response to re
duce the likelihood that we go
through a similar period or make sim
ilar mistakes in the future."
Paulson also said the Treasury is
working to revamp the U.S. regulatory
system "in the relatively near future."

"Our regulatory system is a good
one, but it's far from perfect," he said.
"It [has] built up over many years and
it's not designed to be the most effec
tive and efficient for today's world and
today's marketplace."
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS
On programs such as Social Securi
ty, Medicare and Medicaid. Paulson
said that taking time to reform defi
ciencies carries risks.
"We need to come up with a solu
tion and 1 have no doubt we will, be
cause we're going to have to," he said.
"But the longer we wait, the less flexi
bility we have, the greater the cost and
the burden, which will be borne by the
younger generation."
Paulson drew a difference between
the difficulties with which the entitle
ment programs can be reformed, but
said he is working to simplify the is
sues so that his successor — to be
nominated by the next president —
will have an easier task.
"Social security is analytically easy
but politically difficult, and. of course.
Medicare and Medicaid are analyti
cally difficult and politically difficult,"
Paulson said to laughter from the au
dience. "What 1 tried to do at Treasury
is to do everything I could to depoliti
cize the issue,put out studies,continue
to talk about it, to make it easier for
those who come after me to deal with
this issue."
FOREIGN TRADE AND INVEST
MENT
According to Paulson, the difficul
tv with reforming trade and invest

ment is that both are highly political
issues.
Still, Paulson said he works "hard
on these issues every day"and is cur
rently "trying to get some traction
with the Colombia Free Trade Agree
ment."
"['lhe agreement] is important not
only in terms of economics and in
terms of trade, but it's a very impor
tant foreign policy issue, national de
fense issue, very important to stability
in the region and our neighborhood,"
Paulson said, "so it's again something
we're very focused on."
THE DOLLAR
Recently, the stress of the housing
and capital crises has weakened the
U.S. dollar, and interest rate cuts by
the Federal Reserve have lowered its
value against major currencies such as
the euro and pound.
Responding to a question from the
audience, Paulson stood by his estab
lished view that the dollar will regain
strength from sound underpinnings of
our economy.
"Our economy, like any other,
has got its ups and downs," Paulson
said. "We're facing some challenges
right now, but the long-term funda
mentals are strong and I'm confi
dent they'll be reflected in our cur
rency market."
The audience broke into laughter
following the secretary's standardized
response, to which Paulson replied,
"It's funny, but not that funnv."

tion to honor that mortgage," Paulson
said, "and a vast majority of them do."
Although opposed to large inter
vention from Washington, Paulson
said aiding homeowners who cannot
pay their mortgages is a "shared re
sponsibility" for both outside ser
vicers and the government.
That governmental role lies not
only in the stimulus package but also
in the second side of the approach to
solve the housing crisis — the Hope
Now Alliance, created in October of
last year as a cooperative effort be
tween the government.counselors,in
vestors and lenders to aid homeown
ers who have trouble paying their
mortgages.
Servicers encouraged by the Trea
sury Department and the Depart
ment of Housing and Urban Devel
opment to form the alliance include,
but are not limited to. Bank of Amer
ica, Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase,
Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo.
"The first effort is to get to those
homeowners who are delinquent in
their payments, having problems, and
get them to talk to someone, to reach
out." Paulson said. "Before the pro
gram started, only two to three per
cent [of homeowners] were respond
ing to servicers. Now it's 20 percent.
That's a big improvement."
Paulson said the Treasury's policy
is also geared toward subprime mort
gage holders with adjustable rate
mortgages who will face resets in their
rates.
"What the industry agreed to was
a way to fast-track the modifications
and the refinancing so that we can
avoid a market failure," he said.
According to Paulson, more than a

million homeowners, 683,(KX) of them
with subprime mortgages, have re
ceived workouts, loan modifications
or repayments since July that have al
lowed them to dodge foreclosure.
Much of the government's role
also lies in maintaining the alliance
and ensuring no servicer is a free
rider.
"I am going to keep tab on the re
sult. insist that the industry make the
results transparent and make sure we
don't have any free riders." Paulson
said, "[so] that every one of the ser
vicers who signed up for this program
is going to live up to the commitments
that they have made."
CAPITAL MARKETS
Paulson attributed the crisis in the
capital markets to what he called a
"sentiment swing" among financial in
vestors and institutions.
"This time last year, we had in
vestors feeling pretty confident, look
ing for risk, reaching for yield." he
said. "Now sentiment has swung back
very, very hard toward risk aversion."
Paulson said he believes the recent
"onslaught of press articles" on eco
nomic debt has contributed to this
aversion.
To counteract the shift in investor
sentiment, Paulson told the audience
that the Treasury's focus is to encour
age financial institutions to raise more
capital and hence bolster lending
power.
"Raising capital is critical here,"
Paulson said. "If you're a financial in
stitution and you need capital or you
think you might need capital, you go
get it when it's available. And if you
don't, you're forced to shrink your
balance sheet and cut back on your
lending, and this hurts the real econo
my."
"If you need capital, go raise capi
tal and raise plenty of it." Paulson said
as advice to financial institutions.
The Treasury Secretary also said he
advocated a "balanced" policy re
sponse from Washington to help con
tain the crisis.
"When you go through a period
like this, your first priority is to get
through this period with as little
spillover as possible on the real econ
omy," he said. "It's very important to
come up with a policy response to re
duce the likelihood that we go
through a similar period or make sim
ilar mistakes in the future."
Paulson also said the Treasury is
working to revamp the U.S. regulatory
system "in the relatively near future."

"Our regulatory system is a good
one, but it's far from perfect," he said.
"It [has] built up over many years and
it's not designed to be the most effec
tive and efficient for today's world and
today's marketplace."
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS
On programs such as Social Securi
ty, Medicare and Medicaid. Paulson
said that taking time to reform defi
ciencies carries risks.
"We need to come up with a solu
tion and 1 have no doubt we will, be
cause we're going to have to," he said.
"But the longer we wait, the less flexi
bility we have, the greater the cost and
the burden, which will be borne by the
younger generation."
Paulson drew a difference between
the difficulties with which the entitle
ment programs can be reformed, but
said he is working to simplify the is
sues so that his successor — to be
nominated by the next president —
will have an easier task.
"Social security is analytically easy
but politically difficult, and. of course.
Medicare and Medicaid are analyti
cally difficult and politically difficult,"
Paulson said to laughter from the au
dience. "What 1 tried to do at Treasury
is to do everything I could to depoliti
cize the issue,put out studies,continue
to talk about it, to make it easier for
those who come after me to deal with
this issue."
FOREIGN TRADE AND INVEST
MENT
According to Paulson, the difficul
tv with reforming trade and invest

ment is that both are highly political
issues.
Still, Paulson said he works "hard
on these issues every day"and is cur
rently "trying to get some traction
with the Colombia Free Trade Agree
ment."
"['lhe agreement] is important not
only in terms of economics and in
terms of trade, but it's a very impor
tant foreign policy issue, national de
fense issue, very important to stability
in the region and our neighborhood,"
Paulson said, "so it's again something
we're very focused on."
THE DOLLAR
Recently, the stress of the housing
and capital crises has weakened the
U.S. dollar, and interest rate cuts by
the Federal Reserve have lowered its
value against major currencies such as
the euro and pound.
Responding to a question from the
audience, Paulson stood by his estab
lished view that the dollar will regain
strength from sound underpinnings of
our economy.
"Our economy, like any other,
has got its ups and downs," Paulson
said. "We're facing some challenges
right now, but the long-term funda
mentals are strong and I'm confi
dent they'll be reflected in our cur
rency market."
The audience broke into laughter
following the secretary's standardized
response, to which Paulson replied,
"It's funny, but not that funnv."

"Our economy is structurally sound [and] the long
term fundamentals are strong," said U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Paulson at the Arrillaga Alumni Center
Friday evening. Paulson's remarks came the same day
Wall Street tanked to 2006 levels amid a sluggish Febru
ary employment report that heightened fears of reces
sion.
Paulson, who delivered the keynote address to the
200K Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) Economic Summit, has recently avoided the
claim that the U.S. economy is slipping into a recession, in
stead touting the Bush administration's $152 billion stim
ulus package designed to resuscitate the economy. At the
summit, Paulson acknowledged the economic difficulty
of the times but spoke with optimism about U.S. policies.
"It is a rough time right now," Paulson said. "[But] I
can't think of other countries that don't have more prob
lems than we do, so I like our chances."
The treasury secretary's evening address to an audi
ence of California CEOs, businesspeople and University
faculty nonetheless focused on policy solutions that the
Treasury is applying to different sectors of the U.S. econ
omy.
THE HOUSING MARKET
According to Paulson, a "good year" sees about
650,000 foreclosures on mortgages, while last year faced

1.5 million and this year's estimates hover near 2 million.
Paulson said the Bush administration's approach to solv
ing the mortgage crisis is two-pronged and resists Con
gressional proposals calling for deeper involvement from
the government.
"Some in Washington are proposing big interven
tions" he said. "Most of the proposals I've seen will do
more harm than good. I still have no interest in bailing out
investors, lenders and speculators."
ITie first side of the approach relies on the stimulus
package to create more jobs and bolster the economy so
that fewer Americans suffer mortgage-threatening in
come loss.The package allows individuals to receive early
tax rebate checks, which Paulson said would most likely
be distributed fully by early July.

Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson discussed U.S.
economic markets in the keynote address to the 2008
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Econom
ic Summit last Friday night at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
"We're working very hard now to
get the IKS ready so that they will
begin getting the payments out to the
American people as early as the first
week of May," he said.
Paulson said the focus of the ad
ministration's efforts are those home
owners who cannot afford their mort

their homes, not "speculators" who
are able to make their payments but
"choose to walk away" from them.
