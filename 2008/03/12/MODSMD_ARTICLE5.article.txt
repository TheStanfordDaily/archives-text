## U.S. Secretary of Treasury defends economic policies 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
"Our economy is structurally sound [and] the long
term fundamentals are strong," said U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Paulson at the Arrillaga Alumni Center
Friday evening. Paulson's remarks came the same day
Wall Street tanked to 2006 levels amid a sluggish Febru
ary employment report that heightened fears of reces
sion.
Paulson, who delivered the keynote address to the
200K Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) Economic Summit, has recently avoided the
claim that the U.S. economy is slipping into a recession, in
stead touting the Bush administration's $152 billion stim
ulus package designed to resuscitate the economy. At the
summit, Paulson acknowledged the economic difficulty
of the times but spoke with optimism about U.S. policies.
"It is a rough time right now," Paulson said. "[But] I
can't think of other countries that don't have more prob
lems than we do, so I like our chances."
The treasury secretary's evening address to an audi
ence of California CEOs, businesspeople and University
faculty nonetheless focused on policy solutions that the
Treasury is applying to different sectors of the U.S. econ
omy.
THE HOUSING MARKET
According to Paulson, a "good year" sees about
650,000 foreclosures on mortgages, while last year faced

1.5 million and this year's estimates hover near 2 million.
Paulson said the Bush administration's approach to solv
ing the mortgage crisis is two-pronged and resists Con
gressional proposals calling for deeper involvement from
the government.
"Some in Washington are proposing big interven
tions" he said. "Most of the proposals I've seen will do
more harm than good. I still have no interest in bailing out
investors, lenders and speculators."
ITie first side of the approach relies on the stimulus
package to create more jobs and bolster the economy so
that fewer Americans suffer mortgage-threatening in
come loss.The package allows individuals to receive early
tax rebate checks, which Paulson said would most likely
be distributed fully by early July.
