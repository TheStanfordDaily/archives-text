## Students, faculty discuss Election '08 Non-voting international community members offer their opinions 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
Students and faculty turned out in droves to vote in
the California primary election on Super TUesday, and
others have already voted or will vote in their home
states. Excluded from the ballot-casting frenzy at the
Graduate Student Union, however, were international
students and faculty, who. by federal law. are not permit
ted to vote in any U.S. election.
While not allowed to officially cast ballots, members
of the international community have been engaged, to
varying extents, in this historic election. The Daily sat

down with Alina Syunkova '08 of Moscow. Russia; Jawar
Mohammed '09 of Oromia, Ethiopia; Siri Eklund Sachs
'09 of Stockholm. Sweden; and I lehrew Professor and Is
raeli citizen Vered Shemtov to gauge the perspectives of
the international community on one of the most tense
elections in recent memory.
THE DAILY (TSD): Have you been following presiden
tial election coverage, even though you will not he vot
ing?
JAWAR MOHAMMED (JM): I have been following
the politics like crazy. 1 think it's one of the most interest
ing elections in recent history.The election seems not just
about candidates,but it's challenging the value and social
norms of America. The issue of race, cender,class and re-
ligion [have] surfaced in interesting
ways. The most annoying part of this
election is how the media spins things.
SIRI SACHS (SS): Yes, hut not a lot.
ALIINA SYUNKOVA (AS): I have
purposefully not been following it,
because, being from Moscow, I know
that a) my vote doesn't count and b)
masses have no say in politics and
democracy is an illusion.
Nevertheless, 1 do think it is ex
tremely interesting that the two top
candidates are minorities — a
woman and a young, black man. This
is very curious and 1 am looking for
ward to seeing Americans' reactions
when either one of the two prevails.
VEREI) SHEMTOV (VS): I follow
both Israeli and American coverage
[of the election]. Within the Ameri
can media, 1 follow The New York
Times and NPR [National Public
Radio], but also media within the
Jewish community. I've lived here for
18 years, so I really care about what's
going on here.
TSI): What issues matter most to you,
and how [do they] affect what you
want to happen in this election?
JM: My major concern on American
politics is the foreign policy. 1 strong
ly believe that somebody who will
clean the mess Bush left needs to
come in. The only person who is ca
pable of changing the U.S. standing in
the world today is Obama. If elected
as a president, he gives the US. a
human face. He could speak his mind
to the Muslim world without reserva
tion and without being labeled as
anti-Muslim.
AS: No matter who wins, the out
come for U.S.-Russia relations and
US. foreign policy in general will be
largely the same.
VS: I care about the war in Iraq, gay
rights, women's rights [and] the envi
ronment. Very Californian, I sup
pose. I feel whatever goes here sets

an example for the rest of the world.
TSD: How is this election different
than one you would be experiencing
at home?
AS: Well. Russian politics are an alto
gether different "art" from U.S. poli
tics. In Russia, of course, no one that
is sane wanted to vote or expected
that any voting would happen. But
this does not matter, as long as the
economy is healthy and people are
living better and better every day.
SS: In the U.S. money has too much
say in one's power status and elec
tability. In Sweden the campaigning
and campaign spending is limited.
We also have proportional represen
tation so we can get a higher partici
pation rate as every vote counts, and
there is no risk of electoral fraud —
it's just out of the question. And we'd
have more parties to choose from.
VS: I think [in America] there is
more emphasis on how people
speak. If they know how to speak, I
would say being eloquent is some
thing that has such an impact. In Is
rael, the major strength of a leader is
experience.
JM: Huge difference. There is no
such freedom in Ethiopia to freely
campaign and too much restriction
on opposition movements. The de
bates also mostly focused on ethnic
divisions [instead of] real issues such
[as the] economy or healthcare. So it
seems, in some odd ways, Ethiopians
would turn out [to] vote in higher
proportion than the U.S. In 2005 over
85 percent — 26 million out of 30
million — of eligible voters cast their
vote in Ethiopia. The U.S. hardly
passes the 50 percent mark,even dur
ing such [a] highly contested primary.
TSI): Do you participate in elections
in your respective home countries?
AS: [Laughs] No. I mean, I could if I
wanted to. Nothing bad would hap
pen to me, but what's the purpose or
humor in that?
JIM: Yes. I actually plan to run for of
fice in few years, so count me in.
