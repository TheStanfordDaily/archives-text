## Q & A with sgt. william a treseder 
### SUSANA MONTES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sergeant William Treseder joined the Marine Corps in September 2000. Last fall, he was admitted to Stanford
as a transfer student from West Valley College, where he was secretary of his fraternity, student body president and
valedictorian. After being recalled into active duty in Iraq, he has deferred his
admission to Stanford.

cial Forces under control of the Iraqi govern
ment — get to work on whatever needs to be
done.
For me, the Transition Teams (U.S. Coalition
Forces that work together and train Iraqi Secu
rity Forces] often have problems with equip
ment, logistics, maintenance, supplies and soon.
We help to fix Iraqi problems (actually respon
sible for many more headaches than things on
the Coalition side) like pay, training and food. 1

by a 1700 briefing touching on all the daily is
sues that came up. and then we work through
until around 2130 or 22CK).
On a training day, we either do training tasks,
patrol or movement. We move in helicopters,
which only fly at night here. I've been up all
night catching catnaps whenever possible, stay
ing warm with my body armor and combat load
on.The desert gets very cold at night during the
winter, trust me.
We do a pre-movement brief and conduct an
after-action debrief and report (AAR). This
could be anything from a class on optics, night
vision. firing crew-served weapons, patrolling,
talking to local leaders or any number of other
things. A lot of what units do out here is just
show up.The presence of the "Marine Tribe," as
we are thought of out of the Iraq boondocks
makes a huge impact. We have earned the re
spect of these tribes through bloodshed and
deaths on both sides.
How is the environment right now? Could you
describe it?
TTie environment is a huge question. I sup
pose the biggest difference is a personal realiza
tion (it was for me. anyway) of how much the
value of a life is inflated by Western culture.The
Hobbesian reality for most of the people here is
depressing for someone raised in a warm and
safe American cocoon. Everything about Iraq
speaks of an imagined past, glorious in its poor
ly-defined majesty. The culture, the people, the
climate, the architecture — they all say the
same thing to me.
The people in charge of the country are un
sure of their temporary importance on the
world stage, untrusting of the new civic struc
ture being constructed around them, myopical
ly focused on ancient religious divides, wary of
their Shiite and Sunni neighbors alike yet still
hopeful. It is beautiful to see children still react
the same way to a small gift,still organize games
in the streets, still smile and laugh for no dis
cernable reason and seem innocent despite
everything around them. The most amazing
thing is to see how little a foreign culture gloss
es over the same motivations and love we all
share for our family and friends.
An interrogator friend of mine told me it is
odd how easily the "fundamentalist Muslim"
can be stripped away when talking to an insur
gent, how quickly the poor, disillusioned, twen
ty-something with no prospects emerges.
How are you and your fellow eolleagues experi
encing Iraq?
The most interesting aspect of this deploy
ment has been taking note of the various reac
tions to the loss and separation everyone deals
with here. A distressing number of my peers —
single Marines from their mid-twenties — tend
to bury themselves in technology when not
working. They have the ability to get iPods,
PS3s, laptops and various other mind-numbing
devices over here, though we sometimes lack

The Daily was able to correspond with Sgt.
Treseder via email.
Where are you stationed in Iraq?
1 am stationed, along with almost all other
Marines, in Al Anhar province, the Western
"bulge"of Iraq. It is mostly comprised of desert,
but it houses several population centers includ
ing Ramadi. Hit, Haditha and Fallujah (where I
am stationed). Camp Fallujah, a former army
and "freedom fighter" training center just east
of the city proper, is home to the first Marine
Expeditionary Force Forward [1 MEF (fwd)].
This is the unit 1 was attached to after complet
ing a "combat refresher course" in the |Marine
Corps Base] Camp Pendleton during the first
eight weeks of my recall.
What are your duties?
I work in the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) sec
tion, specifically the Department of Border En
forcement (DBE) cell, overseeing all the Bor
der and Port and Entry Transition Teams (BTTs
and POETTs) on the borders of Saudi Arabia,
Jordan and Syria.The slogan for all the military
stationed here now is " Transition is the New
Mission." and that impacts everything we do.
Most units operate in a "Train. Mentor and Ad
vise" status, providing hands-on help to the
Iraqi units they are paired with. In some ways,
these aren't totally unlike the Combined Ac
tion Platoons (CAPs) of Vietnam, except for
the environment they are operating in.
My job is semi-autonomous — particularly
for an enlisted Marine — and I do most training
and movement with my officer counterpart.
Captain Justin Betz.This is a one-year tour for I
MEF as a whole, though Capt. Betz and I are
only supposed to be here for approximately
seven months of that.
Sgt. Ire seder described the difficulties he and
his unit have faced during their deployment in
Iraq.
The unit we replaced, an East coast version
of us called 11 MEF, had about 60 percent more
personnel than we do, so we find ourselves
short-staffed in pretty much every way. My job
used to be performed by two Staff Non-Com
missioned Officers (SNCOs) totaling close to
twenty-five years of experience in the Corps,
while I have spent a total of five years in.
Because a recall is financially and (potential
ly) politically costly, they rarely occur. This
means there are very few people in the Depart
ment of Defense who know exactly what to do.
When my peers and I were mobilized for this
tour, we found no help from any higher com
mand, instead getting conflicting reports of
where we were going and what we would be
doing when we got there.
What is your "normal" daily routine?
To get p.m. time, subtract 12 hours from Zulu
time.
A normal day doesn't really exist here. I can
classify the two types of days as either adminis
trative or training days. There are no days off,
but we are allowed a few hours of Sunday for
worship services.
Administrative days start around 0730 with
a briefing to the Head Officer about what will
happen that day or any red flags thrown during
the night. [These red flags] could be prisoners
captured, enemy or friendly Killed in Action
(KIA), accidents or missing gear. From there it
is "chow time" and then the individual cells in
Iraqi Security Forces — military, police or Spe-
