# Guerilla theater in the classroom captures attention
## 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Students in Dr. Dement's "Sleep and Dreams" lecture are used to
constant interruptions — from narcoleptic dogs to snoozing students
and the occasional ring of a cell phone. But Wednesday's interruption
was something else entirely.
Jessica Cornwell '09 answered her phone during Dement's lecture
and "freaked out," according to her acting partner Vera Eidelman
09. Cornwell staged a hysterical reaction to a phony phone call
about a human rights issue. She stood up and yelled in distress, while
Eidelman told her to stop talking in class.

Ibis was one in a series of performances by the Stanford The
atre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP) put on for Interna
tional Women's Week. The student-run STAMP collaborated
with MEChA, an umbrella organization for the Chicano/Latino
groups on campus, to promote awareness about the Juarez situa
tion in Mexico.
Juarez is a factory town bordering El Paso, Texas. Since

1993, over 400 young women have mysteriously disap
peared from this town. The lack of clarity surrounding
this issue is disturbing to many; at this point, there are 4
only questions.
Lisa Llanos'o9,the head of MEChA,compiled the in
formation about Juarez and went to STAMP for help.

According to Eidelman, other student activist groups
often come to STAMP for help with ideas. Traditionally,
student groups use flyers, announcements, documentary

EMILY VOGEL/The Stanford Daily

screenings and demonstrations in White Plaza to promote awareness.
Iliis was STAMP'S first time using guerilla theatre, and director
Amanda Gelender '09 was excited about its success.
"Our mission is to generate political performance pieces that ed
ucate people about social change, mobilize them and fundraise," said

"We've created the buzz."
Eidelman herself was disappointed with the "Sleep and Dreams"
performance.
"Dr. Dement speaks with a microphone, and it's a huge class," she
said. "So it was hard to hear us. The students didn't react like we'd
hoped."

Meanwhile, students in a one
o'clock Medical School lecture
were less apathetic. The ac
tress had worked herself into
tears by the end of her per
formance, and students fol-

lowed her out of the
classroom to make sure
she was okay.
"The idea [of guerilla
theatre] is that you dis
rupt people's conscious
ness in their daily routine
with a political issue,"
Gelender said. Hence

the jarring disruption in class.
i A double drama and political science major, Ge
' lender uses acclaimed political actor Augusto Boat's
model for her theatrical stunts.
"It's a theatre which recognizes that everywhere
you go is a potential space for performance and a space to
show a political issue," she said.

"We've created

the buzz."

Eidelman, the guerilla theatre co
ordinator for STAMP, was nonethe
less pleased by the increased aware
ness of the situation in Juarez.
"It's been interesting to see how
each theatre tactic worked best." she
said. "It teaches us more about what
we can do in the future."
'ITiough the group performed in
only a few classes. Vera claims that
STAMP attracted a larger audience
than it would have at a play. TTie
group received prior faculty permis
sion for its performances. Most of

the 50 plus professors Eidelman con
tacted refused their offers to per
form. insisting that they were tight
on time or that an academic setting
would not be the best place for the
demonstrations. A few professors
were touched, offering alternatives
such as making an announcement at
the beginning of their classes.
"The most frustrating thing is that
[an issue like this] really touches
you, but you don't know what to do
about it," said Eidelman. "One of
our responsibilities is to provide

some sort of outlet."
The Juarez situation remains
cloudy, but Eidelman and others are
promoting "Amnesty-style involve
ment." with petition signing and let
ter-writing.
