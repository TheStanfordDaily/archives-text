THERE IS A GENOCIDAL MOVEMENT AFOOT IN THE WORLD. ITS ADVOCATES ARE LEGION, ITS RESOURCES
GREAT, ITS ATROCITIES MOUNTING. BUT AMERICANS STILL PRETEND THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST.
THE SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES. AND WHAT IT SAYS IS BOTH DISTURBING AND OMINOUS.
Therefore we are submitting this Declaration Against Genocide to student governments, to campus human rights organizations, Wii
to Muslim Students Associations and to individuals in the academic community, to join us in drawing a collective line in the sand
against barbarism and to declare ourselves for civilization and hope. 1 w 1 <y|
THE DECLARATION
Whereas genocide - the murder, or plan to murder, an entire people -is a crime against all humanity; Whereas genocide is a crime AAla Ik ''S/fflß
that has metastasized in the modern era, leading to the murders of millions of Armenians, Cambodians, Tutsis, Sudanese, Bosnian BUm ak ™
Muslims and others; Whereas the largest and most devastating genocide on record is the Holocaust of European Jews; Whereas a
new genocide of the Jews is being called for by Islamic leaders in the Middle East; Whereas global forces are being mobilized by
the Iranian regime to eliminate the Jewish state; Whereas the genocide of the Jews is called for in texts understood by some Mus-
lims as authoritative and echoes through sermons in some mosques today, and is proclaimed by certain leaders of the Islamic #*""
religion; Whereas Catholicism and other Christian denominations have condemned the Holocaust and repudiated anti-Jewish QM
pronouncements that have stained their religious past; '
We call on all Student Governments and campus Muslim groups to:
1. Condemn and repudiate the Hadith which reads:
"Abu I luraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill
them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him." Sahih
Muslim book 41, no. 6985
2. Condemn and repudiate the Manias Charter which says:
"Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it."
3. Condemn Ahmadinejad who has said:
"The accomplishment of a world without America and Israel is both possible and feasible."
4. Condemn Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah who has said:
"The Jews are a cancer which is liable to spread again at any moment."
"There is no solution to the conflict except with the disappearance of Israel."
"If they all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide."
5. Affirm:
* The right of all people to live in freedom and dignity.
* The freedom of the individual conscience: to change religions or have no religion at all.
* The equal dignity of women and men.
* The right of all people to live free from violence, intimidation, and coercion.
We call upon all campus political, cultural, ethnic and religious groups to stand with us in opposing all forms of religious supremacism, violence and intimidation.
