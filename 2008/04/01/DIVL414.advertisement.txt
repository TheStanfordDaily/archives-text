Environmental Performance: Measuring and Managing the Benefits of Nature
What are the goals of environmental policy? What constitutes "good" environmental performance or
"successful" environmental management? Given the answers to those questions, how do we currently measure
environmental performance? The course will review and critique a broad range of environmental data and mod
els used in science and public policy. Students will develop their own methods - rooted in biophysical and social
science -to count, track, and communicate the benefits of nature. Offered only once! TAH 11-12:30
Humbio 115
Long-term Human Interaction with Environment
The environmental challenges that present-day societies face, while pervasive and large-scale, are only the most
recent set of consequences to emerge in a long history of human interaction with the environment. This course
examines how and why past human interactions with the environment developed the way they did, using case
studies from around the world. A central topic in the course will be sustainability; what is meant by sustainabili
ty, what assumptions are associated with the term, and whether these assumptions are reasonable given what we
know of past developments. M/W 12:15-2:05
Humbio 148
Kinship and Marriage
This course treats marriage as the site at which biology and culture meet and contend, and kinship as the
variable outcome of the encounter. The course will involve a detailed comparative examination of selected soci
eties in Oceania, Africa, and East Asia. M/W 10-11:50
Humbio 149
Aging: From Biology to Social Policy
The US and other developed countries have a larger proportion of elderly people than ever before in the history
of human populations. How did we get there? What are the biological, social, and cultural factors that con
tribute to aging? What are the implications of this population change for social policy? TAH 5:30-7
Humbio 164
Critical Implications of Human Memory Research
This seminar will cover fundamental concepts in human memory research, emphasizing recent debates and
advances in methodology. Memory research will be considered in terms of its application to other fields with a
focus on evaluating scientific findings and becoming critical consumers of scientific research. Topics will include
eyewitness memory, mood disorders, aging, testing effects, childhood amnesia, memory distortions, psychophar
macology, fMRI, and everyday instances of forgetting. TAH 3:15-5:05
