The Euphronios krater. Returned by the
Metropolitan Museum to Italy
This course considers the economic, cultural and political uses of archaeological heritage
in an international context, from the eighteenth century to the present day, and their
implications for understanding and negotiating access to the material past. In modern
society, cultural artifacts can function as religious or ethnic symbols, historical documents,
art objects, and commodities. The different values that are placed on artifacts have given
rise to conflicting claims of ownership, which have sometimes had destructive
consequences, such as the 2003 sack of the Iraq National Museum, and have drawn US
art museums into open confrontation with national governments. Contradictions abound.
Museum collecting has been defended as promoting international understanding, and
condemned for doing just the opposite. The antiquities trade has been defended on
grounds of economic justice, and attacked for its economic inequity. This course
investigates the theoretical and historical contexts of these conflicting valuations and
claims, and the legal and ethical attempts that have been made to mediate them.
