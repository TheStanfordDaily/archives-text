English 171 A: English in the World
The goal of this course is to get a sense of the richness and the complexity of English as a language of
modern world literature. Once thought of as mere aberrations of "Queen's English," the wide varieties of
English around the world, and their consequent cultural productions, have now begun to remap the canon
of English studies. The class will read a sample of global Anglophone literatures, examining variations
in language-use and cultural patterns, the relationships of such literatures with western and indigenous
aesthetic forms, and the complex histories that have formed the material and philosophical contexts of their
productions.
English 18JF: contemporary Critical theory
This course will focus on the reading practices in literary and cultural studies that have since the
mid-twentieth century come to be identified ;is that amorphous and übiquitous beast called 'critical theory.'
Some of our key questions will be: How do acts of reading and writing connect to relations of power,
between individuals and between social and political groups? Across lines of race, class, gender, physical
(dis)ability, sexual orientation? What are the implications of critical onslaughts in the context of a
global present that is politically as unsettling as it is skeptical of the humanities, both within the university
and in the public sphere at large?
