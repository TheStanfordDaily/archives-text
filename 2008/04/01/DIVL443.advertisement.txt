ETHICSOCI36R -- Introduction to Global Justice
(POLISCII36R, 336, INTNLRELI36R); Tue/Thu 9:00 -10:30 AM
Contemporary global politics raises a host of urgent and controversial moral
questions. Are rich countries doing enough to help poor countries? Is WTO
policy skewed in favor of the developed world? Should we impose sanctions
on countries that violate human rights? Should global institutions be made
more democratic? Are our immigration policies too tight or too lax? How
should the costs of mitigating global climate change be distributed across
countries? This course will discuss some of the more prominent accounts
political theorists have offered of the nature and foundations of our duties to
foreigners (e.g. global liberal egalitarianism, political liberalism, nationalism,
utilitarianism) and consider how those different approaches might be applied
to the above and other concrete issues in global politics.
The course requires no previous knowledge of political theory, and should be
of interest to students in political science, international relations, philosophy,
ethics in society, law and economics. Syllabus available at
syllabus.stanford.edu.

ETHICSOC 179 M -- Libertarianism and Its Critics
I Tue/Thu 12:35 • 2:0 5
We will examine libertarian arguments about: whether taxing some persons'
market incomes in order to provide benefits to others is a form of theft;
whether such taxation is morally equivalent to forcing some persons to work
for others; whether the minimum wage unjustly infringes freedom of contract;
how people may acquire moral ownership of natural resources; the proper
role of government. Readings from Nozick, Milton Friedman, Hayek and G.A.
Cohen, among others.
