## Inter-university job portal opens Site provides recruiting resources for students 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students searching for
internships across the country have
new help, thanks to an online intern
ship network that shares career
resources from Stanford and seven
other American universities.
I he online job listing site, called
iNet. offers internship information to
undergraduate and graduate students
at the eight universities comprising
the iNet consortium. The idea for
iNet emerged from discussions
between Stanford Career
Development Center (CDC)
Director Lance Choy and his col
league at the University of
Pennsylvania, Patricia Rose, over

ways to broaden the geographical
diversity of their internship listings.
Choy and Rose recruited their
peers at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Georgetown
University. Yale University, Rice
University, Northwestern University
and New York University to join the
internship-sharing consortium and to
create a central location to provide
services to their students.
The iNet Web site was launched
earlier this year by NACF.link. a non
profit national recruiting network
that also runs the Cardinal Careers
Web site.
"iNet is an additional resource to
provide more opportunities around
the nation," said Jennifer Rutt, direc
tor of NACElink, a service provider
to the National Association of
Colleges and Employers. "Each indi
vidual career center markets to the
employers that they have a relation
ship with and asks them to post on the

i Net site."
In the past, the Stanford CDC
partnered with Monstcr'frak, a for
profit job search portal, to provide a
larger, more diverse pool of intern
ships. But the CDC was unhappy with
several core elements of
MonsterTrak, especially since it
charged employers a few hundred
dollars to post internship positions,
said Beverley Principal, assistant
director of employment services at
the CDC. Career centers at each of
the participating schools also pay
NACEIink an annual fee for the serv
ice.
"We were looking for the type of
service whereby employers could
post their links for free." Principal
said. "We also wanted more control
over what we offer our students and
employers."
Employers can post jobs on iNet
for free, and Principal believes this is
a major reason why employers are
attracted to iNet.
The free job posting also provides
information on smaller start-ups and
non-profits, which may otherwise be
unable to pay the fee to post on for
profit internship sites.
Employers have expressed satis
faction over the various tools avail

able to them on iNet, according to
Rutt. For example, employers can
conduct a keyword search of appli
cant resumes if they arc searching for
a specific qualification or educational
background.
As of March 7. there were 1.077
internships posted on iNet and 1.169
registered employers. Principal said.
On the same day. there were 2.036
jobs posted on the Cardinal Careers
Web site. But unlike iNet. which only
offers internships. Cardinal Careers
encompasses internships as well as
full-time, part-time and on-campus
jobs.
Ibe applicant pool for iNet intern

ships is much larger than that of
Cardinal Careers because iNet is
available to students from all eight
schools, whereas Cardinal Careers
caters exclusively to Stanford stu
dents. But Principal believes that the
growing number of internships avail
able through iNet will circumvent
any rise in competition for intern
ships among Stanford students.
"The number of internships has
shot up so dramatically, we're able to
share more of these jobs with stu
dents," Principal said.
