# CJME drafts letter on Middle East
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the campaigns for the 2008
presidential election surge forward,
some students are bringing attention
to human l ights issues in Israel and
Palestine, hoping that the next com
mander-in-chief will listen.
The Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East (CJME) is drafting a
letter that recommends action to
address attacks against civilians in
Gaza by Israel, Hamas and other
Palestinian armed groups.The letter,
intended to be mailed en masse to
the eventual presidential nominees,
calls for a condemnation of rocket
attacks by Palestinians against
Israeli civilians and demands that
Israel work to alleviate the suffering
of Palestinian civilians.
When the draft is finalized,
CJME will gather signatures, and
each signatory will generate a letter
to be mailed to his or her candidate
of choice.
"We're hoping to influence the
next administration's positions,"
CJME President Tim Gregory '09
said. "And with the volume of let
ters. we want to make it something
that the candidates cannot ignore."
Ilie move to send the letter also
meets the organization's goals for
increased campus dialogue.
"We hope to raise awareness on
campus of issues on both sides." said
Merrit Kennedy 'OS, vice-president
of ( JME
"To transform the debate on
campus has become a real goal,"
Gregory added. "Last year the tone
on campus often veered toward
irrelevant issues."
While the letter will address vio
lence against civilians by both sides,
recommendations regarding Israeli
policies constitute a larger and more
detailed portion of its message.
"There are fewer ties we can ask
the United States to use with
Hamas." Gregory said. "We want to
pressure both sides, but we have to

reflect the truth of both sides. It's
entirely pragmatic."
The draft has not yet been final
ized. but CJME leaders said they
will be approaching other student
groups of varying political positions
to seek support.

"We're hoping to
influence the next
administration's
positions."

"We want this to transcend polit
ical divides," Kennedy said.
Several student group leaders
expressed initial interest in the let
ter.
"Assuming that the focus will he
on doing what they can for civilians,
then that's great," said Carrie
Mlynarczyk '09, co-president of the
Stanford Israel Alliance. "It's always
a good idea to acknowledge what's
happening, and 1 think it's excellent
to see another group showing both
sides of the issue, particularly a
group that's been historically one
sided."
"Ilie petition does not go into
very specific detail, but what it's try
ing to do is a very just cause," added
Fadi Quran '10. Co-president of
Students Confronting Apartheid by
Israel and a member of CJME.
"They took the time to make it accu
rate."
