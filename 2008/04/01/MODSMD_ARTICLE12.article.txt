## Editorial Board Assigned reading: quality, not quantity 
### 
As another quarter begins, students
will Hock to the Bookstore to collect
textbooks mandated by their profes
sors. Some students may be lucky enough to
have all of their readings posted on Course
work, where they can quickly (and without
cost) download the material to read on their
computer screens or in printed form. These
readings may be about philosophy. I English
literature, economics or any number of sub
ject areas, reflecting the varied interests of
the student body. These readings have one
thing in common across subject areas, how
ever: they are likely too numerous.
An unwritten agreement often struck
between professors and students goes like
this: professors assign large amounts of text
to be digested in rather short periods of
time while students select lucky passages to
actually read. ITiis arrangement is detri
mental to the learning process. Professors
either expect too much of students, or else
they must struggle with the task of dissemi
nating information during lecture to stu
dents with differing levels of comprehen
sion. Students often end up inferring which
readings will be the most important to cover
for class and risk investing all their time in a
topic that is not very valuable to under
standing the overarching "big picture" of
the course.
This high quantity of reading raises the
question of the relationship between units
and course work. Units roughly define the
amount of work required of students every
week, and readings can demand hours of
time beyond what is expected given how
many units a class is worth. Students choose
how many units they want to take in a quar
ter based on other commitments and a
sense of what they can accomplish. When
there is a divergence between unit enroll
ment and workload, students are unable to
properly manage their schedules and reach

their goals.
In order to assuage this unfortunate
problem, assigned readings should focus on
teaching students in an informative way
without being too broad and overbearing.
Readings that are long-winded but neces
sary should be summarized by the professor
in written form. If a reading is interesting
and related but fundamentally tangential to
the aims of the course, it should be clearly
demarcated as optional. Professors should
not assume that all students read extremely
quickly. This assumption indirectly evalu
ates students on the basis of their rending
speed a quality not necessarily as important
as the ability to digest concepts and express
them intelligently.
The University must provide the correct
incentives for professors to begin adjusting
their syllabi. Course evaluations must reflect
the importance of assigned readings to the
learning experience. A question about the
relevance of assigned reading already exists
on the official student evaluation form, but a
new question asking whether the amount of
reading assigned was appropriate should be
included. Furthermore, in the comments
section, students should be encouraged to
comment on the usefulness of specific read
ings.These ratings should be used in earnest
to assess the performance of professors.
When the expectations that professors
have of students can actually be fulfilled,
students can be more frank and engaged in
their work. Ihis renewed academic environ
ment will no doubt improve students' learn
ing; the conversation between those who
teach and those who learn will not be
strained.The change will also allow students
to better manage their time, opening up
possibilities to contribute to student life, ad
vance in the pursuit of a career or even just
spend more time relaxing in the beautiful
California sun.
