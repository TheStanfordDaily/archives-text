# Pleading Inanity
## Fault lines 
### 
En route to Namibia last week. I had a
daylong layover in London. Chas
tened by the increasingly unfavor
able dollar-pound exchange rate and bur
dened with two carry-ons. I decided to en
gage in my favorite London-based transit
activity: going to the Tate Modern but not
paying the three-pound suggested dona
tion for entry, and checking my luggage but
not paying the two-pound suggested dona
tion for the coat room.
While finishing off my espresso from
the Cafe — for which I did not pay the sug
gested 1.5 pounds — I laid eyes on what I
took to be the perfect symbolic start to my
time in Africa: an enormous subterranean
chasm. For those of who you haven't been,
Tate's Turbine 11 all is usually adorned with
cutting-edge sculptures and conceptual
pieces. Currently, however, this iconic
space simply has a big crack in the floor,
courtesy of Doris Salcedo.
If you ask me, Salcedo's work Shibbo
leth was most likely the result of her drop
ping something during installation, damag
ing the floor and not wanting to pay for it.
On the other hand, if you ask her, she'll
likely tell you about how the Shibboleth —
by virtue of its crack-in-the-flooredness —
"asks questions about the shaky ideologi
cal foundations upon which Western no
tions of modernity are built." In particular,
as a shibboleth is a "custom, phrase or use
of language that is used to exclude others,"
Salcedo is addressing a long legacy of
racism that she believes under lies the mod
ern world.
After I satisfied my urge to squeeze my
body into this huge crack, I realized that
the work of art was pretty deep. For hun
dreds of years. Western ideas of progress
resulted m the destruction of native cul
tures, and the roots of our prosperity arc
tainted with the horrors of slavery and
colonial exploitation. Moreover, our own
time remains defined by the existence of
over one billion people who live on less
than one dollar a day. In fact, what draws
many people to focus their studies and de
velopment efforts on the African continent
is the feeling that our oppressive footprint
has never truly been lifted.
Aided by a fairly large amount of KY
jelly. I withdrew myself from the chasm,my
vigor and excitement for the law school's
international human rights clinic re
freshed, renewed and smelling like cher
ries. After fully digesting the import of Sal
cedo's monumental crevice, I was filled

with rage against all colonialists, post, net)
and garden variety, and determined to ef
fect change.
Orientation week passed, and next
week we start work. Among the I Oof us. we
have four projects: helping judges more
easily access relevant precedent in order to
legitimize and standardize the common
law system, representing HIV positive
women who have been involuntarily steril
ized by the government, drafting legisla
tion to implement the Convention Against
Torture and helping to establish a legal
•linic to provide inexpensive legal services
afid inform citizens of their rights.
Of course, our very presence in Africa
has its own underlying problems. Our hotel
is in a ritzy part of the capital in which col
oreds weren't allowed during the
apartheid era. and we're surrounded by an
electric fence that — as I can tell you from
personal experience —is live 24/7. Our
dishes are washed, beds made and floor
mopped by a staff that is, without excep
tion. black. We have wireless Internet ac
cess in our apartments. Thus, independent
of what we hope will be said about our ac
complishments in Namibia, one could just
as easily look at our set-up as a bunch of
Americans who are willing to help out in
Africa just as long as they don't have to ac
tually live there.
If you asked me for my thoughts —
which is what you implicitly do by reading
my column religiously — I 'd say that every
endeavor to help humanity is problematic
in one way or another. Ibe public-interest
minded among us engage in our work with
an unwavering commitment to protecting
the vulnerable and empowering the weak.
Yet at the same time, we must be self-aware
enough to understand our own limitations
and deep motivations. To play with an old
canard, the road to a hellacious reincarna
tion may be paved with good intentions,
but so is the road to redemption.

In Namibia? Let '.v hang out! Yon bring the K Y
Jelly, I'll bring the malarone — vishnus<9
