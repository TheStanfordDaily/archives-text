# Oddities & Katie-o-Syncrasies
## Your library personality 
### 
As much as 1 have repeatedly fallen vic
tim to the siren's call of procrastina
tion. I still try to resist the lure of
"Scrubs" reruns, collage-making and vacuum
ing, and go to the library. "Hie library is wonder
ful because it is noiseless, talk-less and distrac
tion-less — I am forced to focus on the task at
hand, a task whose due date is most likely omi
nously near. However, despite the blank hard
wood carrels and the magazine-less desks, my
mind inevitably wanders off. until I sheepishly
catch it wasting mental energy and force it to
concentrate once again. But quite paradoxical
ly. I start to wonder how it is that our brains
think about something else without us even
knowing, and how it is that we suddenly be
come aware that our thoughts are wandering.
Ihe one other thing I do at the library —
besides trying to force myself to study, getting
caught in a vicious meta-thought cycle and
maybe getting a book — is analyzing and scru
tinizing those around me. Three years of one
room doubles and a personal insistence on
studying silence has made me an ol' cowboy on
the library round-up—l've seen 'em come
and I've seen 'em go,and more likely than not,
I know your type all too well. And whether you
know it or not, where you go and how you
study says everything I need to know about
you.
Let's start with the worst of all libraries: the
Art and Architecture Library. If you study at

the art history library it means one of two
things: 1) you are crazy and uptight and like
studying in the worst library on campus, or 2)
you are an art history major, which means you
like memorizing endless names, dates and ti
tles and are probably a little crazy because of it.
Not only is the art library completely non-cir
culating. but you can only check out books for
two hours at a time, and,just 112 your I, someone
is already reading the one book you need. Al
ways, no matter what,even at 8 a.m. You'll con
template waiting out those two hours, but the
art history library is already sucking out your
spirit, minute by minute, and if you wait until
Firsty McHaha finishes perusing and add the
two hours you will need to read the damn book
yourself, you're not sure if you will ever get
your groove back. Also there is no food or even
water allowed in the art history library, and the
stacks downstairs are the crank-me-open, I
could-get-squished-and-killed-in-here, was
there-really-no-room-for-shelves-when-they-
built-this-place kind.

In stark and utter contrast to the Art Room
of Doom, is the splendor that is the Law Li
brary of Love. Beautiful, new, economically
correct chairs make Green's aged wooden
seats seem like eight-tracks. You can get your
own room which has helpful, large white
boards and the bonus of even less noise. The
Law Library is so good, in fact, that undergrads
had to be banned from its walls during dead
week and finals due to overcrowding.'lhe peo
ple know.
But then there are the people that don't
know, and they end up in Meyer. Since there is
no guard at Meyer's door, you can eat and
drink ad nauseum — but there are loud,clang
ing doors, odd wind-tunnel sounds and too
many people in one big room to make up for a
couple of lattes. If you are in Meyer. I hope for
your sake it is because you are quite literally
addicted to caffeinated beverages, just lost
your ID card or are such a super-procrastina
tor that there is no longer any other study
space open.
Because if none of those things are true,you
should be studying across the way at Green, or
Cecil, as I like to call her. Just past the red,bent
toothbrushy-looking fountain — which I
hated freshman year but now regard very af
fectionately — lies my home away from home,
the very mother of all book-holding buildings.
