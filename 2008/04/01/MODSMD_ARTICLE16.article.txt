## Why SOCC is not endorsing an Executive Slate 
### 
For every ASSU general election in re
cent history, the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) has endorsed a sin
gle executive slate.The endorsement symbol

who together comprise SOCC. While we
have endorsed the current Undergraduate
Senate candidates with the greatest potential
to advocate for communities of color, we
have been unable to do so this year with re
gards to the Executives.
In a fashion similar to last year, Stanford
has many slates to choose from in a single

election. Four slates sought our endorse
ment, which consists of a brief open-ended
questionnaire and interview. Each slate
showed a genuine interest in advocating for
students of color, with multiple candidates
having direct prior involvement with our
communities while others showed a commit
ment to inform themselves as rapidly as pos
sible. All indicated a strong desire to commu
nicate with the many communities at Stan
ford and to listen to the concerns of the stu
dent body. Frankly, it is a testament to the
drive of this year's executive slates that
everyone has made students of color an im
portant priority.
We applaud the willingness of all candi

dates seeking an endorsement to consult
with us on the issues, and we invite all of
them to do so if they so choose. We believe
that voters from our communities will bene
fit from this opportunity, so we sincerely
hope all Executive Slates will include issues
of importance to students of color on their
platforms. All students should examine each
candidate's platforms and stances on the is
sues, particularly those who share SOCC's
interest in ensuring that the concerns of
Stanford's ethnic communities are ad
dressed.
