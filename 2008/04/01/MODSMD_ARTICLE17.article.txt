## FCC to hold campus hearing on Net policy 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) announced on
Mar. 19 that it will hold a second pub
lic hearing on Apr. 17 at Stanford on
"net neutrality" and the future of the
Internet. Ihe hearing will follow a
February hearing held at Harvard
Law School.
Ihe public hearing is part of the
FCC's ongoing investigation into the
blocking or limiting of Internet con
tent, such as access to the peer-to
peer application Bit Torrent, by
Comcast and other Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). The FCC is current
ly weighing in on what constitutes
"reasonable" network management
practices by ISPs.
Josh Silver, executive director of
Free Press, which coordinates the
Savethelnternet.com Coalition,
issued a Mar. 19 statement about the
hearing.
"Just as the Internet benefited
from widespread public participa
tion, so will the debate over its
future," Silver wrote. "The hearing at
Stanford — the birthplace of our
Internet economy — gives Web inno
vators a chance to weigh in on the
policies that will shape the industry
for a generation. At this defining
moment in the Internet's history, the
threat posed by would-be gatekeep
ers like Comcast is very real and get
ting worse."
"Open Internet policies are

urgently needed." he added. "We
hope this important hearing will lead
to immediate and accelerated action
at the FCC."
At the first hearing at Harvard,
five commissioners from the FCC
heard from Comcast, Verizon and
Bit Torrent representatives, as well as
academics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Harvard
Law School, among others.
Following that hearing, Comcast
admitted to hiring seat-fillers, pre
venting interested members of the
public from attending the event.
The FCC has indicated that the
second hearing at Stanford will follow
a similar format to the first but did
not announce the event's speakers or
exact location in its statement.
