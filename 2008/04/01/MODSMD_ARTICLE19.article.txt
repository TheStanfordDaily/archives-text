## Report finds education troubles 
### KEN THOMAS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Seventeen of the nation's 50 largest cities had high
school graduation rates lower than 50 percent, with
the lowest graduation rates reported in Detroit,
Indianapolis and Cleveland, according to a report
released Tuesday.
The report, issued by America's Promise Alliance,
found that about half of the students served by pub
lic school systems in the nation's largest cities receive
diplomas. Students in suburban and rural public high
schools were more likely to graduate than their coun
terparts in urban public high schools, the researchers
said.
Nationally, about 70 percent of U.S. students grad
uate on time with a regular diploma and about 1.2
million students drop out annually.
"When more than 1 million students a year drop
out of high school, it's more than a problem, it's a
catastrophe," said former Secretary of State Colin

Powell, founding chair of the alliance.
His wife. Alma Powell, the chair of the alliance,
said students need to graduate with skills that will
help them in higher education and beyond. "We must
invest in the whole child, and that means finding
solutions that involve the family, the school and the
community." The Powell's organization was begin
ning a national campaign to cut high school dropout
rates.
The group, joining Education Secretary Margaret
Spellings at a Tuesday news conference, was
announcing plans to hold summits in every state dur
ing the next two years on ways to better prepare stu
dents for college and the work force.
The report found troubling data on the prospects
of urban public high school students getting to col
lege. In Detroit's public schools, 24.9 percent of the
students graduated from high school, while 30.5 per
cent graduated in Indianapolis Public Schools and
34.1 percent received diplomas in the Cleveland
Municipal City School District.
