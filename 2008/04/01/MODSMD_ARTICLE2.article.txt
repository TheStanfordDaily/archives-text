## Stanford reaches first Final Four since '97 
### SCOTT BLAND SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In four of the past five years, the Stanford
women's basketball team got to the national
quarterfinals, only to fall short of the prom
ised land, the Final Four. Two years ago, LSU
crushed the Cardinal's hopes in the final
minute. The year before that, Michigan State
eked out a nail-biter over Stanford.
In 2008, Candice Wiggins and the Cardinal
left no doubt, pulling away from one-seed
Maryland in the middle of the game and
coasting through to the final buzzer to a 98-87
victory. It marked the Cardinal's first Final
Four appearance since 1997.
"What can I say about Candice," Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer said after the
game. "She is a great player, steps up in big
games, and she really stepped up for our
team."
Wiggins, the Spokane Regional MVP,
scored 41 points in the game to lead all play
ers. Sophomore guard J J Hones and freshman

forward Kayla Pedersen put in su
perb performances for Stanford, as
well. Hones hit four three-pointers
en route to scoring 23 points, a ca
reer-high; Pedersen chipped in 15
points and 7 assists while playing all
40 minutes alongside Wiggins and
11 ones.
The Cardinal (34-3) and the Ter

rapins (33-4) both opened up hot,
hitting virtually everything on the
way to making it a 10-9 Maryland
game by the first TV timeout four
minutes in. Stanford threatened to
pull away several times in the first
half, but in each instance was reined
in by the Terrapins, who shot 54.1
percent on the game.

Stanford offset Maryland's hot
shooting with some pinpoint accura
cy of its own. hitting an eye-popping
14-for-2S from three-point range.
After the Terrapins caught up with a
Stanford run yet again, closing to
within three at 41-38 with just over
two minutes to go in the first half, the
Cardinal used two of those three

pointers — a rare bomb from Peder
sen, who was 3-for-3 from long dis
tance, and a trey from Hones — to
put Maryland in the rear-view mir
ror. 51-41. at the half.
"1 know that they shot well Va
n said."but we were shooting
really well from three. We were get
ting some good shots, and they were
really working hard for their shots."
Ilie Terps closed the gap to just 6
points early in the second period, as
KristyTolliver — who hit Maryland's
famous game-tying three-pointer in
the national championship two years
ago — had a layup and a three within
the first five minutes. But evenTolliv
er, who led Maryland with 35 points,
was powerless to stop the three-head
ed monster that has driven the Cardi
nal's offense all year long.
Stanford scored on five of its next
seven possessions, including a layup
and a three-point play from Pcder
sen, a three from Wiggins and two
baskets from sophomore center
Jayne Appel. who finished with 11
points and9 rebounds.
This put Stanford ahead 69-56, as
Maryland missed a flurry of layups
and short jump shots under pressure
from Appel and Pedersen. Wiggins
tacked four more points on with 11
minutes to go. and the Cardinal led
by as much as 17 with the half wind
ing down.
"Tara looked at me [during a
timeout] and said, whenever you get
a shot, just take it," a bubbling Wig
gins said in the post-game press con
ference.
Maryland may have made a few
Stanford fans nervous with a run that
brought the Terps within 7 points
with six minutes left, but Wiggins an
swered Tolliver's three with a three
of her own to give Stanford a double
digit cushion, and Hones hit a three
pointer and a layup to preserve the
margin and send Maryland into foul
ing mode.
The Cardinal will play the winner
of today's Tennessee-Texas A&M
game. The Cardinal has already
played Tennessee this season, defeat
ing the Volunteers 73-69 in overtime
at Maples Pavilion in December.
