## HOOKED BY THE HORNS 
### DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
! lOUSTON — Stanford gave it its
all. But in the end. that wasn't enough.
Texas' 20-3 run late in the second half
broke Stanford's will and ended its sea
son, 82-62, in Saturday's Sweet 16
match-up at I louston's Reliant Stadium.
The Longhorns' star trio of Ail-
American point guard D.J. Augustin (23
points, 7 assists), forward Damion James
(18 points) and shooting guard A.J.
Abrams (12 points) scored 53, while
Stanford's starting backcourt managed
just 7 points on 2-of-17 shooting. Sopho
more center Brook Lopez kept Stanford
(28-7) close with 26 points (10-of-22.10
rebounds), but 299-pound Texas center
Dexter Pittman helped hold Lopez
scoreless in the last 13:55.They would be
the sophomore's last 14 minutes in a
Cardinal uniform.
At every other position, the Long
horns (30-6) were quicker off the drib
ble. more accurate with their shot and
more tenacious with their defense. So
while Stanford's backcourt — senior
forward Fred Washington and junior
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony
Goods — wished they had some of
those open looks back, coach Trent
Johnson knew that his team deserved to
lose to the '1 lorns.
"As hard as it is for me to say, they are
better." he said postgame."They are bet
ter.
"It would be easy for me to sit up here
and say, well, we ran out of gas or didn't
do this or didn't do that. We did what
we've done all year long. We competed
and came up short, because they were
better at crucial times."
While Stanford never led after 2-0.
the team fought mightily to delay the in
evitable. Johnson made consecutive
threes, one right before the halftime
horn and one just after.Texas's edge was
just 43-37, its smallest since a 23-18 lead
with 6:19 to go in the first.
Ihe Longhorns responded with two
James free throws and an Augustin
layup. But then Brook Lopez and soph
omore reserve Landry Fields (11 points)

3/28 vs. TEXAS L 82-62
GAME NOTES: Playing in his final collegiate game,
sophomore Brook Lopez led the Cardinal with
26 points and 10 rebounds. Despite the 20-
point difference in the final score, Stanford was
within one point of the Longhoms and had a
chance to take the lead midway through the sec
ond half. Texas was led by point guard D.J. Au
gustin, who scored 23 points and dished out
seven assists.

got hot, scoring all of Stanford's points
during a 14-5 run.
Fields, spelling the cold Goods (0
points, 0-of-7 shooting), capped the
spurt with a three from the top of the arc.
It pulled Stanford within 52-51 with
12:54 to go.
But that was as close as Stanford
would come as Texas switched to a man
defense, began pressuring the ball more
aggressively and checked Pittman in
three minutes later. Blame fatigue,
blame panic, or just credit Texas, but
Stanford didn't score from the field until
a Fields jumper with 3:36 left.
"When [Pittman] started guarding
me, 1 started throwing up poor percent
age shots that 1 don't normally make,"
said Lopez, who missed all four of his
shots during Texas's run, the first on an
eight-foot hook that .would have given
Stanford a 53-52 lead, but never hit the
rim. "They just came out and 1 think they
just wanted it more."

bined for 17 points over the 20-3 spurt,
and Texas led 72-54, with just 3:44 sepa
rating them from the Elite Eight.
"I think we just ran out of gas, and
they kept throwing bodies at us," said
senior forward Taj Finger (7 rebounds, 4
points). "They kept beating us up and
just taking it to us."
Both teams started off cold, with
their depth perception perhaps affected
by the dozens of feet behind cither back
board in the arena. Texas led just 12-8

Texas guard D.J. Augustin had little trouble breaking down Brook Lopez and the Cardinal defense during
last Friday's game, scoring 23 points while dishing out seven assists.
after nine minutes, with the teams a
eombined 0-of-8 deep.
Then Texas' guards and Lopez
started getting uncorked. In the face
of a consistent Texas double team.
Brook posted a 15-point, 10-re
bound half, helping Stanford stay
within 40-34 at halftime.
"It's almost like what 1 remember
as a kid growing up with the Green
Bay Packers and that sweep they
ran." Texas coach Rick Barnes said
of facing Brook Lopez. "You knew it
was coming, but there is just not a
whole lot you can do about it."
Lopez needed to start strong, be
cause Stanford's first points outside
the paint came on junior forward
Lawrence Hill's three — with 2:31
left in the first half.
The rest of the teams' struggles
on offense are all the more concern
ing for next year, given that Brook
Lopez is a likely top-five pick in the
NBA Draft.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out this is probably his last
game in a Stanford uniform," coach
Johnson said postgame.
Both players declined to discuss
their plans for next year after the
game.
The Cardinal, picked fifth in the
Pac-10 and No. 23 nationally presea

son, exceeded expectations with its
highest win total and first Sweet 16
berth of the Trent Johnson era. St)
while there was anger after theTexas
loss, there was also a sense of pride.
"When they take a long step hack
and take a look at this, they will feel
good about what they accom
plished," coach Johnson said.
"Yes, we had goals to be Pac-10
Champions during the season; yes,
we had a goal to be conference
champions; and yes they had a goal
to get to the Final Four. And the
thing about it is they believed and
worked their tails off to put them
selves in a position where they just
came up just a step short in all three
of them."
For seniors Washington, junior
guard Kenny Brown and senior cen
ter Peter Prowitt.the game was like
ly their last in not just a Stanford jer
sey. but any uniform at all.
Finger, the one senior with a real
istic shot and desire to play overseas
next year, was just as proud of his last
year at Stanford.
"We didn't play in the past three
years to Stanford, to what people ex
pected Stanford to be," he said of the
three-year spurt with no wins in the
NCAA Tournament. "This year, we
had a great season: second in the
Pac-10, making it to the Sweet 16. I
definitely think that we left our
mark."
