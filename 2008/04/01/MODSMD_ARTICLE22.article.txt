## 
### KATHERINE BELL STAFF WRITER 
As a rule, the Stanford women's swimming
and diving team has never placed out of the top
six at the NCAA Championship in the history of
the meet. This year was no exception.
The Cardinal earned its first top three finish
since 2002 when it placed third at the 2(X)8
NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Cham
pionships, which were held from March 20 to
March 22 in Columbus, Ohio. Led by sophomore
Julia Smit, who claimed her first individual na
tional title in the 400 individual medley (IM), the
Cardinal continued its tradition as a perennial
swimming powerhouse.
The Stanford women were unable to catch a

runaway Arizona squad, who won their first ever
NCAA Championship title with an impressive
484 points. Auburn, the defending national
champions, finished second with 348 points, nar
rowly ahead of Stanford's 343 point effort.
Fourth went to Texas A&M with 315 points. And
despite finishing behind them last year, Stanford
fans will be happy to note that the Cardinal fin
ished comfortably ahead of Bay Area rival Cali
fornia points), who finished fifth.
It wasn't all smooth sailing for the Card, how
ever. In the very first scored event of the meet,
Stanford's third-ranked 200 freestyle relay
squad lost valuable points when it was contro
versially disqualified for a false start. Relays
count for double the points, so the disqualifica
tion was all the more important.Nonetheless, the

team fought their way up from fifth after the first
day to third at the culmination of the meet, fin
ishing only five points behind second-place
Auburn.
Stanford head women's swimming coach Lea
Maurer was impressed with the tenacity of the
team after the disqualification.
"I am so proud of our girls and the way that
the team came together and fought back
through adversity," said Maurer. "Coming back
after that DO early in the meet and being in a
dogfight for second at the end was exactly where
we needed to be."
The success of the Cardinal can be attributed.
