North Carolina's lyier Hansbrough and
Kansas State's Michael Beasley were unani
mous selections to The Associated Press' All-
America team Monday. For the first time, no
senior was chosen.
Beasley and Kevin Love of UCLA made it
two straight years there were two freshmen
chosen. Sophomore D.J. Augustin of Texas and
junior Chris Douglas-Roberts of Memphis
rounded out the selections,shutting out the sen
iors.
The AP started choosing All-America teams
after the 1947-48 season, and for the next six
decades there was at least one member of the
senior class on every first team.
Until this group.
Hansbrough, a junior and the Atlantic Coast
Conference player of the year, and Beasley, the
Big 12 player of the year and third freshman to
lead the country in rebounding, were named on
all 72 ballots and received 360 points from the
same national media panel that selects the
weekly Top 25.The voting was done before the
NCAA tournament.
"To be one of just two players in the country
to receive such an honor is very humbling," said
Beasley, who led Kansas State to its first NCAA
bid since 19%. "1 have never been about indi
vidual accomplishments, but about helping my
team win games. 1 wish we were still playing, but
1 am happy with the success we had this sea
son."
The 6-foot-10 Beasley averaged 26.5 points
and 12.4 rebounds for the Wildcats, shooting
53.5 percent from the field including 38.9 per
cent from 3-point range. He is Kansas State's
first All-America since Bob Boozer in 1959.
Hansbrough, a second-team selection last
season, compiled impressive numbers (23.0
points. 10.4 rebounds) and lived up to his "Psy
cho T" nickname while leading the Tar Heels to
a school-record 36 wins and their 17th Final
Four. The last North Carolina player to be
picked to the first team was Joseph Forte in
2001.
The 6-9 Hansbrough and Beasley joined
Jameer Nelson of Saint Joseph's and Hmeka
Okafor of Connecticut in 2004. and J.J. Redick
of Duke and Adam Morrison of Gonzaga in
2(X)6 as unanimous tandems. Hansbrough said
he knew his name and Beasley's were linked
most of the season by fans and media.
