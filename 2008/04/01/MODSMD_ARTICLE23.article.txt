North Carolina's lyier Hansbrough and
Kansas State's Michael Beasley were unani
mous selections to The Associated Press' All-
America team Monday. For the first time, no
senior was chosen.
Beasley and Kevin Love of UCLA made it
two straight years there were two freshmen
chosen. Sophomore D.J. Augustin of Texas and
junior Chris Douglas-Roberts of Memphis
rounded out the selections,shutting out the sen
iors.
The AP started choosing All-America teams
after the 1947-48 season, and for the next six
decades there was at least one member of the
senior class on every first team.
Until this group.
Hansbrough, a junior and the Atlantic Coast
Conference player of the year, and Beasley, the
Big 12 player of the year and third freshman to
lead the country in rebounding, were named on
all 72 ballots and received 360 points from the
same national media panel that selects the
weekly Top 25.The voting was done before the
NCAA tournament.
"To be one of just two players in the country
to receive such an honor is very humbling," said
Beasley, who led Kansas State to its first NCAA
bid since 19%. "1 have never been about indi
vidual accomplishments, but about helping my
team win games. 1 wish we were still playing, but
1 am happy with the success we had this sea
son."
The 6-foot-10 Beasley averaged 26.5 points
and 12.4 rebounds for the Wildcats, shooting
53.5 percent from the field including 38.9 per
cent from 3-point range. He is Kansas State's
first All-America since Bob Boozer in 1959.
Hansbrough, a second-team selection last
season, compiled impressive numbers (23.0
points. 10.4 rebounds) and lived up to his "Psy
cho T" nickname while leading the Tar Heels to
a school-record 36 wins and their 17th Final
Four. The last North Carolina player to be
picked to the first team was Joseph Forte in
2001.
The 6-9 Hansbrough and Beasley joined
Jameer Nelson of Saint Joseph's and Hmeka
Okafor of Connecticut in 2004. and J.J. Redick
of Duke and Adam Morrison of Gonzaga in
2(X)6 as unanimous tandems. Hansbrough said
he knew his name and Beasley's were linked
most of the season by fans and media.
"I think everybody wants to
make comparisons about stats and
things," Hansbrough said. "To me, I
thought he was definitely in a differ
ent situation than here. ... He defi
nitely had a good year and has had a
lot of accomplishments."
The 6-foot Augustin was named
on 66 ballots and had 346 points. I le
directed the Longhorns to the re
gional final, averaging 19.8 points
and 5.7 assists in 37.2 minutes. It is
the second straight year a Texas
player was on the first team as Kevin
Durant and ()hio State's Greg Oden
became just the third and fourth
freshmen to be so honored since
1972.
"It shows if you come here and
work hard, ready to learn, great
things will happen." Augustin said.
Hie 6-10 Love led the Bruins to
their third straight Final Four ap
pearance, averaging a double-dou
ble in their tournament run after get
ting 17.1 points and 10.6 rebounds
and shooting 55.7 percent in the reg
ular season.
Love received 52 first-team votes
and 318 points to become UCLA's
second All-America in as many sea
sons as Arron Afflalo was chosen
last year. Love said he followed
Beaslev closely this season.

"That's my guy. I've known Mike
since seventh grade. We played
against each other so many times,"
Love said. "He's a great player. He
had one hell of a year this year, and I
think if he decides to leave he'll be
the No. 1 pick in the draft."
Douglas-Roberts, the third mem
ber of the All-America team playing
in the Final Four, had 52 first-team
votes and 309 points. The 6-7 swing
man averaged 17.2 points and 4.1 re
bounds and shot 44.9 percent from 3-
point range for the Tigers, who lost
just one game this season and earned
the school's second No. 1 ranking.
"It's an honor. I've put a lot of
work in, over the summers, during
the season and staying after practice
just trying to improve. I feel now that
I'm finally getting the recognition I
deserve," said Douglas-Roberts,
Memphis' first All-America since
Penny Hardaway in 1993."8ut I still
say when people look at that Ail-
American list, it's a motivation be
cause I'm the one that people know
the least about."

Luke Harangody was sixth in the
voting with 211 points, and he was
joined on the second team by seniors

of Indiana and Roy Hibbert of
Georgetown, and college basket
