# So long to the Lopez twins
## Sophomore seven-footers announce decision to enter 2008 NBA Draft 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Seven-foot twins Brook and
Robin Lopez came to the Farm
together, and they will leave to
gether.
Just three days removed from
Stanford's season-ending loss to
Texas and a day before their 20th
birthdays, the Lopez twins an
nounced their decision on Mon
day to enter the NBA draft
through a release sent by their
mother, Deborah Ledford. to The
Associated Press.
"After a great deal of thought
and discussion with my family, I
feel it is the appropriate time to
enter the NBA draft," Brook
Lopez said. "It is the dream of
every basketball player to play
and succeed in the NBA, and 1
feel I am ready to take on this
new challenge."
Brook Lopez is considered to
be a top-five pick in the 2008
NBA Draft by a number of
sources, including ESPN.com,
which currently has the sopho
more listed as the third pick in its
mock draft. CBS analyst Clark
Kellogg also deemed him the
most dominant player left in the
NCAA Tournament when there
were 32 teams remaining.
While the announcement of
Brook Lopez's intention to de
clare for the draft came as no sur
prise to many — the sophomore

big man averaged 19.3 points and
8.2 rebounds while showing him
self to be one of the best post
players in all of college basketball
— the announcement of Robin
Lopez was less predictable.
"This has been a very difficult
decision for me because I really
enjoyed my two years at Stan
ford." Robin Lopez told the AP.
"1 have always hoped I would
have an opportunity to play in the
NBA, and 1 feel now is the right
time to make that dream a reali
ty"
Although Robin's numbers
were less stellar —10.2 points
and 5.2 rebounds per game — he
showed flashes of great potential
throughout his two years at the
Farm and is considered by many
to be a possible first round pick in
this June's NBA Draft.
Out of town, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson was unavail
able for comment regarding the
twins' decision. However, the an
nouncement — especially
Brook's — probably wasn't the
greatest surprise to the fourth
year Cardinal coach.
"It doesn't take a rocket scien
tist to figure out this is probably
his [Brook Lopez's] last game in a
Stanford uniform," coach John
son said after the team's 82-62
loss to Texas on Friday.
