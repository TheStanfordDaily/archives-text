# So long to the Lopez twins
## Sophomore seven-footers announce decision to enter 2008 NBA Draft 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Seven-foot twins Brook and
Robin Lopez came to the Farm
together, and they will leave to
gether.
Just three days removed from
Stanford's season-ending loss to
Texas and a day before their 20th
birthdays, the Lopez twins an
nounced their decision on Mon
day to enter the NBA draft
through a release sent by their
mother, Deborah Ledford. to The
Associated Press.
"After a great deal of thought
and discussion with my family, I
feel it is the appropriate time to
enter the NBA draft," Brook
Lopez said. "It is the dream of
every basketball player to play
and succeed in the NBA, and 1
feel I am ready to take on this
new challenge."
Brook Lopez is considered to
be a top-five pick in the 2008
NBA Draft by a number of
sources, including ESPN.com,
which currently has the sopho
more listed as the third pick in its
mock draft. CBS analyst Clark
Kellogg also deemed him the
most dominant player left in the
NCAA Tournament when there
were 32 teams remaining.
While the announcement of
Brook Lopez's intention to de
clare for the draft came as no sur
prise to many — the sophomore

big man averaged 19.3 points and
8.2 rebounds while showing him
self to be one of the best post
players in all of college basketball
— the announcement of Robin
Lopez was less predictable.
"This has been a very difficult
decision for me because I really
enjoyed my two years at Stan
ford." Robin Lopez told the AP.
"1 have always hoped I would
have an opportunity to play in the
NBA, and 1 feel now is the right
time to make that dream a reali
ty"
Although Robin's numbers
were less stellar —10.2 points
and 5.2 rebounds per game — he
showed flashes of great potential
throughout his two years at the
Farm and is considered by many
to be a possible first round pick in
this June's NBA Draft.
Out of town, Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson was unavail
able for comment regarding the
twins' decision. However, the an
nouncement — especially
Brook's — probably wasn't the
greatest surprise to the fourth
year Cardinal coach.
"It doesn't take a rocket scien
tist to figure out this is probably
his [Brook Lopez's] last game in a
Stanford uniform," coach John
son said after the team's 82-62
loss to Texas on Friday.

soon be set in stone for the twins, as Led
ford announced that they plan to sign with
an agent, thereby waiving any NCAA eli
gibility.
"That's something we're still working
on and finalizing," she said. "It's a definite
decision. We'll be hiring agents."
The announcement was certainly not
an easy one to make for the twins, whose
seven-foot frames have been hallmarks
both on campus and on the court. Both
said that they eventually plan to return to
the Farm in order to complete their degree
requirements.
"1 have really enjoyed my time at Stan
ford," Brook Lopez said. "The university
has afforded me a great opportunity to
gain an education from one of the finest
schools in the country, while also allowing
me to develop as a basketball player."
The departure of the Lopez twins rais
es many questions about the future of
coach Trent Johnson's program, which ex
perienced a revival of sorts this season
after finishing second place in the Pac-10
and reaching the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
Tournament for the first time in seven
years.
The brothers were the Cardinals two
leading scorers this season while juniors
Anthony Goods and Lawrence Hill were
mired in season-long shooting slumps. In
particular. Brook Lopez carried the team
through most of the season, whether it was
his game-winning shot over Marquette in
the second round or his numerous 20-
point performances.
That said, it may be more beneficial for
fans of Stanford and those surrounding
the program to appreciate the Lopez's two
seasons instead of lamenting their depar
ture.
"Nobody's surprised. We wish they
were staying, but they made their deci
sions," Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
said in Spokane, Wash., where the
women's team was playing in the NCAA
Regional Final.
"They're terrific players, no question
about that. They've done a great job for
us."
