## ADMITS SHATTER RECORDS 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
2,400 — the number normally associated with a perfect SAT
score — took on a new meaning Friday when the Office of
Admission announced that 2,400 students were offered admission
to the Class of 2012.
The prospective freshmen. 738 of whom were admitted early in
December, were selected from an applicant pool of 25,298 — the

Daily, referring to the end of early admission cycles at the two Ivy
League schools.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott also attributed the diffi

universities.
"Of course, we are shooting for a yield comparable to last year
— our record-breaking 70 percent," Abbott said in an email to
The Daily. "But Harvard and Princeton's move to cut their early
programs and the new financial aid initiatives at 1 larvard and Yale
may affect that goal."
Shaw noted that the admission office was cautious to avoid
