# Acceptance rate falls to record low
## ADMITS SHATTER RECORDS 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
2,400 — the number normally associated with a perfect SAT
score — took on a new meaning Friday when the Office of
Admission announced that 2,400 students were offered admission
to the Class of 2012.
The prospective freshmen. 738 of whom were admitted early in
December, were selected from an applicant pool of 25,298 — the

largest in Stanford's history. Also
earning a spot in the University's

record books is the record-low 9.5

percent acceptance rate for
this year's admission cycle.

j
"The competi
tion for admission

to Stanford this year
was unprecedented.

said Dean of

Admission and
Financial Aid

Richard Shaw in a

press release. "As expect
ed, the academic
strengths, talent and

impact outside the classroom of this group is astonishing. They are
distinguished on a global scale."
According to Shaw, international students comprise N. 1 per
cent of the admitted pool, with Korea holding the largest repre
sentation. Students from all 50 U.S. states were admitted.
To determine how many students will be admitted, the admis
sion office studies the rates at which Stanford admits have accept
ed the offers of admission over a four-year period. Known as
"yield." these rates have steadily increased, creeping into the 70
percent range for the Class of 2011.
"This year is a bit more difficult to predict because of one-cycle
processes at Princeton and Harvard," Shaw said in an email to The
Daily, referring to the end of early admission cycles at the two Ivy
League schools.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott also attributed the diffi
culty of predicting this year's yield to financial aid reforms at top
universities.
"Of course, we are shooting for a yield comparable to last year
— our record-breaking 70 percent," Abbott said in an email to
The Daily. "But Harvard and Princeton's move to cut their early
programs and the new financial aid initiatives at 1 larvard and Yale
may affect that goal."
Shaw noted that the admission office was cautious to avoid

forming too large a class, such as the
Class of 2011, which is compi ised of
1,745 students.
"Clearly, we needed to be very
aware [that] we could not have
another year where our incoming
class is too large," he said. "We
would rather be slightly short of
enrollment target aiulgo to wait list
than to be over."
Approximately 6 percent of
applicants were offered a space on
the wait list, according to Abbott.
Changes to this year's admission
cycle included a new application
deadline of Jan. I. pushed back
from mid-December, as well as a
requirement that applicants fill out
the Common Application and
Stanford supplement. The Financial
Aid Office also bolstered its offer
ings in February, announcing free
tuition for families earning less than
$ 100.000 each year and free tuition,
room, board and fees for families
earning less than $60,000 each year.
"We hope that many of those
who have been admitted will bone
fit from Stanford's new financial aid
programs, which should enable us
to attract an even more socio-eco
nomically diverse freshman class,"
Shaw said in the press release.
According to Shaw, the admitted
pool for the Class of 2012 also
includes 431 students who will be
the first in their families to attend a
four-year college or university.
