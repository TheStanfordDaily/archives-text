## Need for HPACs under evaluation Pilot program assesses academic peer advising 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
Feedback has been positive for a pilot program that replaced
Head Peer Academic Coordinators (HPACs) in some undergrad
uate dorms with other forms of advising, according to a recent
study reported by Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR)
Director Susie Brubaker-Cole.
The pilot program, new this year, removed the HPAC position
from Florence Moore, Toyon. Larkin. Burbank and Donner
dorms, handing the job of residential academic advising to aca
demic directors (ADs) or an additional residential assistant
(RA).
"Results of this study showed that ADs provide information
and guidance to an especially broad range of topics and issues
and that students find that ADs are able to advise on more
diverse topics in a single meeting than other types of advisors
with whom students interact." Brubaker-Cole said in an email to
The Daily.
Academic Directors have offices
in the dorm complexes, opening
their doors to students with ques
tions ranging from curricular plan
ning and overseas study possibilities
to fellowships and opportunities
after Stanford. 'Iliis year, there are
Academic Directors in Wilbur.
Stern. Florence Moore and Toyon.
as well as the Athletics Academic
Resource Center.
Student feedback was solicited in
a series of December and January
student surveys and focus groups
evaluating the changes to residence
based academic advising.
According to Brubaker-Cole,
surveyed students appreciate the
easy accessibility of the ADs as well
as the interest these advisors take in
helping students with long-term
planning.
ITie steering of undergraduates
away from peer-to-peer advising
came in part because of a report in

Stanford's last accreditation review
that recommended reforming the
current system, Brubaker-Cole said.
In a May 9. 2007 Daily article
["HPACs on razor's edge"], she said
incidences of peer advisors misdirect
ing or not referring students to other
academic advisors had carried seri
ous consequences for some students.
Still, for some students. HPACs
continue to be a valuable resource.
Soto's HPAC Olivia Puerta '08
defended her position.
"1 think an HPAC can be more
helpful because you've been in the
same position as the student," she
said, adding that seeking outside
advice was also critical. "I think the
[administration's] move is to
encourage more students to go
directly to an academic advisor in
Sweet Hall, but I think the HPAC
can be a valuable resource to refer
them that direction."
Milan Manchandia '11 agreed.
"1 find her really helpful," he

said of his lIPAC in Twain. "I've
used her a lot. I find it easier to
learn from peers."
But for several I arkin freshmen
who have never experienced the
resources of an I II'AC. the absence
is no real loss. Carlos Plasencia 11
was not even aware of the HPAC
position in other dorms and saw no
need for it.
"You could go to the RAs with
those kinds of questions," Plasencia
said of peer academic advising.
Brubaker-C'ole said the pilot
program will stay in place for at
least another year, as it is still too
soon to judge its overall outcome.
"The plan is to assess the current
program and changes to date over
the next 12 months, Brubaker-Cole
said, "and to use the assessment
information to inform future direc
tions."
