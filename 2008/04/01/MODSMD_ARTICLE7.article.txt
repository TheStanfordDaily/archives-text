## The 						new business of golf 
### SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN 
Y —m —* his is an unusual Wednesday. Usually, de
spite the cold, the rain and the early hour,
you'd find students gearing up to play.
Those braving the conditions on a day
JL like this would be the core golfers. Kelly
Sortino GSB 'ON would be here, brushing curly hair
out of her eyes,and Alex Robertson GSB'OS. adjust
ing his red cap.These are the golfers who are on the
course no matter what.
But today, they're instead three miles away on the
concrete campus of the Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB). A holiday has shifted GSB classes
from Monday to Wednesday, the students' usual day
off. On a typical Wednesday, when the weather is
good, there are 15 to 20 foursomes of GSB students
out on the course. Some of the students, like Robert
son and Sortino, will go out because they started
when they were eight years old. they love it.and it's
part of who they are. But many GSB students who
have little prior experience with golf will also make
their way out to learn how to play
Sarah Garrett GSB 'OS is one of them. She never
even thought about playing goll until she got to the
CiSB. "Everybody said. 'You have to play golf. You
have to try out the golf course because it's so beauti
ful. and as a student you have incredible access and
it's affordable.'" She worked the for-profit sector
over the summer and regretted not being able to par
ticipate in the golf activities organized by her compa
ny. She decided to make lessons a priority. In the fall
she took a beginner golf class filled with mostly (iSB
students who. like her, wanted to get in the game.
The affinity that (iSB students have for golf is not
purely recreational, although their motivations are
less self-serving than those outside of golf and busi
ness might believe. For many, the fact that CiSB stu
dents have Wednesdays off from classes seems to be
an implicit encouragement to pursue golf. 1 his cre
atesa discomfiting picture of young students eager to
conform to the rich golfing businessman stereotype,
eager to break into those elitist networks.
Robertson.co-president of the GSB Student Golf
Club, finds new students coming to the club to for
ward their careers. "It's because they're here, they
know — they think two things: that business revolves
an mud golf or golf revolves around business."
The reality is less straightforward. Rukaiyah
Adams GSB 'OS, who also took her first golf class in
the fall.says that she's just trying toeliminate as many
barriers as possible. The students at the GSB from
more privileged backgrounds have all sorts of con
nections and skills that help them in the business
world. Golf is just one of these, and access to it can
help."lt's just another tool." Adams says."l thought.
Why not?"'
There are some practical reasons why goll goes
well with business. It is a sport that lends itself to social

izing. Sortino says,"l hit the ball 10 percent of the time,
and the other 90 percent I'm talking to the people
around me, and I'm getting to know them better."
Spending time with someone on the green gives you a
sense of their character — how they react when things
go wrong, and how they respond under pressure.
Despite these advantages, the caricature associat
ed with the sport can be uncomfortable to new play
ers. "Close your eyes." Robertson says. "You're walk
ing down the street and you see a golfer. He's got
khakis on. a vibrantly colored polo, a slight golfer's
gut. short hair, a nice polo cap and pink socks." What
person could fit in that outfit but an older white man?
There is a historical basis for this image. Until 1961.
the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) had a
clause stating that "Membership in the PGA shall be
limited to members of t lie Caucasian race." Even after
that codified barrier was lifted, logistical barriers con
tinued to hinder diversification of the sport. A survey
of professional courses by USA Today found that the
average initiation fee for golf course membership was
nearly $50,000. limiting those who have access to rel
atively few very rich people.
Yet the worlds of golf and business are beginning
to diversify. At Stanford's CiSB, there is also a move
towards diversity. In the MBA class of 2(X)9, women
make up 3S percent of the class, six percentage points
more than in 200S.There is also an increase in minor
ity students — in the class of 200S.one in six students
was a member of a minority group; in 2009. it's close
to one in every four. These numbers illustrate a larg
er trend across the country in which women and mi
norities are becoming more and more of a presence
in the business world.
These changes at the CiSB can be seen on the
green. For Jim Miller, who has been a Stanford golf
instructor for 14 years, the diversity of his students is
a big reason he loves being at Stanford. "We're teach
ing students from all over the world, many of whom
have had little or no access previously."
Garrett found that to be true when she took her
beginning golf class. "We're all coming from com
pletely different backgrounds and want to learn it for
similar reasons and so there's that sense of shared ex
perience."
One reason why the Stanford course attracts such
a diverse group is its accessibility.The course is right
on campus and costs only $20 a round, removing the
usual access barriers.The course's encouragement of
beginners and large selection of classes can also be an
important entry point. Either you learn as a kid. or
you learn in graduate school. Beyond that, opportu
nities to learn golf are hard to find.
Hie Stanford course also has a history of diversi
ty. It has been played by some of the best minority
players in the country, including Tom Watson, Tiger
Woods and now Michelle Wie'l 1.
Woods certainly made golf visible to minority ath
letes. According to Adams. Woods' major impact was
highlighting how much fun the sport was. She sees

higher minority participation in golf as part of a shift
in what people consider to he fun. one occurring
among white students and minority students alike.
"The Black Business Students Association must have
25 or more non-black students in it."she says."Every
one's really exploring and trying to do things that
help us understand each other better."
Despite these positive trends, national efforts to
make golf instruction and membership more accessi
ble have been slow. Although the old guard is not ac
tively resisting, it is slow to recognize the need for
changes in the sport to allow for new people. Golfing
with a group of beginners at Stanford, Garrett has oc
casionally felt the annoyance of a group of older men
stuck behind them. "There's a sense of 'What are
these kids who don't know what they're doing play
ing out here?'"
Yet even some of the more experienced golfers
are breaking the demographic stereotype. "People
don't look at me and see a typical golfer." Sortino
says, wearing a red vest and carrying a bag full of
binders and fortune cookies. She grew up in Illinois,
where her family played on the local course. They
didn't have country club memberships, and Sortino
didn't have private lessons. Instead, she learned by
reading books and watching television. Sortino is
quite a golfer — she played all through high school
and then on Princeton's varsity team for two years
before ending up at the GSB.
Her background in golf has been advantageous
for her business career, especially in the job search.
"Twenty minutes of our interview will be spent talk
ing about golf. For women who don't have any kind
of background or interest in it. there's just not that
conversation." When she turned down one job. the
company actually asked her to reconsider because
they really needed her for its golf team.
Although Garrett has just begun, she expects in
the next few years to continue the sport as she enters
into the work world."l'm very much a beginner.but
I really enjoy the sport in all aspects," she says."I
hope that I'm good enough when I leave here to able
to use it in business in the next few years."
On the course, the sun is starting to rise, the morn
ing frost is melting, and the old-timers head out to
start their Wednesday games. Next year, with the in
tensity of their first year of business school behind
them, the uncommonly diverse MBA students of
2009 might head out to the green. Among them, peo
ple who have never had a chance to see a course
might find out why the core players keep coming
back.They might get a sense of the fun of the sport.
They will soon come onto the ninth hole.Sortino's
favorite."You can see San Francisco, you can almost
see Oakland, you see Portola Valley,and the hills, it's
just — it's stunning. That image will be implanted in
my brain forever."

to diversify. At Stanford's CiSB, there is also a move
towards diversity. In the MBA class of 2(X)9, women
make up 3S percent of the class, six percentage points
more than in 200S.There is also an increase in minor
ity students — in the class of 200S.one in six students
was a member of a minority group; in 2009. it's close
to one in every four. These numbers illustrate a larg
er trend across the country in which women and mi
norities are becoming more and more of a presence
in the business world.
These changes at the CiSB can be seen on the
green. For Jim Miller, who has been a Stanford golf
instructor for 14 years, the diversity of his students is
a big reason he loves being at Stanford. "We're teach
ing students from all over the world, many of whom
have had little or no access previously."
Garrett found that to be true when she took her
beginning golf class. "We're all coming from com
pletely different backgrounds and want to learn it for
similar reasons and so there's that sense of shared ex
perience."
One reason why the Stanford course attracts such
a diverse group is its accessibility.The course is right
on campus and costs only $20 a round, removing the
usual access barriers.The course's encouragement of
beginners and large selection of classes can also be an
important entry point. Either you learn as a kid. or
you learn in graduate school. Beyond that, opportu
nities to learn golf are hard to find.
Hie Stanford course also has a history of diversi
ty. It has been played by some of the best minority
players in the country, including Tom Watson, Tiger
Woods and now Michelle Wie'l 1.
Woods certainly made golf visible to minority ath
letes. According to Adams. Woods' major impact was
highlighting how much fun the sport was. She sees

higher minority participation in golf as part of a shift
in what people consider to he fun. one occurring
among white students and minority students alike.
"The Black Business Students Association must have
25 or more non-black students in it."she says."Every
one's really exploring and trying to do things that
help us understand each other better."
Despite these positive trends, national efforts to
make golf instruction and membership more accessi
ble have been slow. Although the old guard is not ac
tively resisting, it is slow to recognize the need for
changes in the sport to allow for new people. Golfing
with a group of beginners at Stanford, Garrett has oc
casionally felt the annoyance of a group of older men
stuck behind them. "There's a sense of 'What are
these kids who don't know what they're doing play
ing out here?'"
Yet even some of the more experienced golfers
are breaking the demographic stereotype. "People
don't look at me and see a typical golfer." Sortino
says, wearing a red vest and carrying a bag full of
binders and fortune cookies. She grew up in Illinois,
where her family played on the local course. They
didn't have country club memberships, and Sortino
didn't have private lessons. Instead, she learned by
reading books and watching television. Sortino is
quite a golfer — she played all through high school
and then on Princeton's varsity team for two years
before ending up at the GSB.
Her background in golf has been advantageous
for her business career, especially in the job search.
"Twenty minutes of our interview will be spent talk
ing about golf. For women who don't have any kind
of background or interest in it. there's just not that
conversation." When she turned down one job. the
company actually asked her to reconsider because
they really needed her for its golf team.
Although Garrett has just begun, she expects in
the next few years to continue the sport as she enters
into the work world."l'm very much a beginner.but
I really enjoy the sport in all aspects," she says."I
hope that I'm good enough when I leave here to able
to use it in business in the next few years."
On the course, the sun is starting to rise, the morn
ing frost is melting, and the old-timers head out to
start their Wednesday games. Next year, with the in
tensity of their first year of business school behind
them, the uncommonly diverse MBA students of
2009 might head out to the green. Among them, peo
ple who have never had a chance to see a course
might find out why the core players keep coming
back.They might get a sense of the fun of the sport.
They will soon come onto the ninth hole.Sortino's
favorite."You can see San Francisco, you can almost
see Oakland, you see Portola Valley,and the hills, it's
just — it's stunning. That image will be implanted in
my brain forever."

Kelly Sortino GSB '08 competed in last year's Challenge for Charity with
nine west coast business schools, including Stanford's Graduate School
of Business.
Y —m —* his is an unusual Wednesday. Usually, de
spite the cold, the rain and the early hour,
you'd find students gearing up to play.
Those braving the conditions on a day
JL like this would be the core golfers. Kelly
Sortino GSB 'ON would be here, brushing curly hair
out of her eyes,and Alex Robertson GSB'OS. adjust
ing his red cap.These are the golfers who are on the
course no matter what.
But today, they're instead three miles away on the
concrete campus of the Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB). A holiday has shifted GSB classes
from Monday to Wednesday, the students' usual day
off. On a typical Wednesday, when the weather is
good, there are 15 to 20 foursomes of GSB students
out on the course. Some of the students, like Robert
son and Sortino, will go out because they started
when they were eight years old. they love it.and it's
part of who they are. But many GSB students who
have little prior experience with golf will also make
their way out to learn how to play
Sarah Garrett GSB 'OS is one of them. She never
even thought about playing goll until she got to the
CiSB. "Everybody said. 'You have to play golf. You
have to try out the golf course because it's so beauti
ful. and as a student you have incredible access and
it's affordable.'" She worked the for-profit sector
over the summer and regretted not being able to par
ticipate in the golf activities organized by her compa
ny. She decided to make lessons a priority. In the fall
she took a beginner golf class filled with mostly (iSB
students who. like her, wanted to get in the game.
The affinity that (iSB students have for golf is not
purely recreational, although their motivations are
less self-serving than those outside of golf and busi
ness might believe. For many, the fact that CiSB stu
dents have Wednesdays off from classes seems to be
an implicit encouragement to pursue golf. 1 his cre
atesa discomfiting picture of young students eager to
conform to the rich golfing businessman stereotype,
eager to break into those elitist networks.
Robertson.co-president of the GSB Student Golf
Club, finds new students coming to the club to for
ward their careers. "It's because they're here, they
know — they think two things: that business revolves
an mud golf or golf revolves around business."
The reality is less straightforward. Rukaiyah
Adams GSB 'OS, who also took her first golf class in
the fall.says that she's just trying toeliminate as many
barriers as possible. The students at the GSB from
more privileged backgrounds have all sorts of con
nections and skills that help them in the business
world. Golf is just one of these, and access to it can
help."lt's just another tool." Adams says."l thought.
Why not?"'
There are some practical reasons why goll goes
well with business. It is a sport that lends itself to social

izing. Sortino says,"l hit the ball 10 percent of the time,
and the other 90 percent I'm talking to the people
around me, and I'm getting to know them better."
Spending time with someone on the green gives you a
sense of their character — how they react when things
go wrong, and how they respond under pressure.
Despite these advantages, the caricature associat
ed with the sport can be uncomfortable to new play
ers. "Close your eyes." Robertson says. "You're walk
ing down the street and you see a golfer. He's got
khakis on. a vibrantly colored polo, a slight golfer's
gut. short hair, a nice polo cap and pink socks." What
person could fit in that outfit but an older white man?
There is a historical basis for this image. Until 1961.
the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) had a
clause stating that "Membership in the PGA shall be
limited to members of t lie Caucasian race." Even after
that codified barrier was lifted, logistical barriers con
tinued to hinder diversification of the sport. A survey
of professional courses by USA Today found that the
average initiation fee for golf course membership was
nearly $50,000. limiting those who have access to rel
atively few very rich people.
