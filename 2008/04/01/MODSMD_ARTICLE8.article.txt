Professor of Interdisciplinary Envi
ronmental Studies Stephen Schnei
der has been a scientific do-gooder
his whole life.
Schneider is a member of the In
ternational Panel on Climate
Change (I PC 'C), which, along with Al
Gore, won the 2(X17 Nobel Peace
Prize. For over thirty years, he has
been speaking about the dangers of
anthropogenic — or man-made
global warming to politicians, stu
dents and scientists. Yet many promi
nent members of the scientific and
political communities have come to
accept this theory only recently.
'I haven't said anything new in
thirty years." he says. "Back then, it
was theory. The difference now is
that nature is cooperating with the
ory."
Hr^P l1 'n in 1945 in New York
City. Schneider grew up
M on l.ong Island. As a
J child, he read National
Geographic magazine
and loved to measure the intensity of
hurricanes His fondest childhood
memories are of his growing fascina
tion with nature — the time when he
came across a fallen tree and was
amazed by the ecosystem at its roots,
or the time he built a telescope and
saw the rings of Saturn through it.
In high school, he thought that he
was going to be a physicist. He en
tered Columbia University in 1%2
where he majored in mechanical en
gineering. I le pursued a Masters and
a Ph.D. at Columbia in plasma
physics until 1971.
In l%(S,at the height of protests
over the Vietnam War, Schneider
was elected by engineering school
students to be their representative in
negotiations for an academic senate.
"So I got. shall we say, my political
training on the streets of New York."
Schneider said with a roguish grin.

changed the course of Schneider's
life — though perhaps he was al
ready looking for a change.
"I was having trouble relating to
things that lasted only a few mi

croseconds." said Schneider of his
Ph.D. work. "I was ready for some
thing new."
That something came in the form
of eco-socialist Barry Commoner's
talk at Columbia about the future of
the planet. Inspired by the speech,
Schneider took a class in planetary
atmospheres with Professor S.I. Ra
sool. then the deputy director of the
(ioddard Institute for Space Studies.
Rasool offered Schneider a summer
internship and then a post-doctorate
fellowship at NASA, which he took.
"I felt the world was screwed up
and that I should be doing something
in my life that makes a difference,not
just makes money," Schneider said.

U thought-provoking way.

their own value system for them
selves." he said. "And I do that by de
constructing .-ill the common values
and then shutting up and letting
them thrash it out in the seminars."
lie finds the relationships he
forms with students to be very mean
ingful.
"The biggest rewards come ten
years later when students still keep in

touch and tell me what they're
doing," he said.
Among other courses. Schneider
teaches "Reducing Stanford's Car
bon Footprint" for undergraduates
and an environmental forum semi
nar for graduate students.
of the politically
charged nature of his re-
M search. Schneider has
J been the focus of criti
cism. Skeptics of anthro
pogenic warming are quick to point
out that he changed from predicting
cooling to forecasting warming. Yet
he believes that this was the only re
sponsible thing to do.
"Imagine a doctor whose patient
arrives with shaking and fever, as
sumes he has pneumonia [and) lakes
a sputum sample which comes back.
He knows the patient doesn't have
pneumonia, but he stays on the orig
inal diagnosis to be politically consis
tent." he said.
Yet Schneider is no stranger to
adulation either — especially since,
along with around 4.0(H) other scien
tists, he received the Nobel Peace
Prize.
"I was proud to be a part of an en
terprise that has such a culture of
community." he said.
Right now.Schneider sees his mis
sion largely as raising awareness and
advising on domestic policy. Yet he
believes that when the Warner-
Lieberman bill, which would direct
the EPA to lower emissions of green
house gases and is now before Con
gress, passes, his role will change.
"'That bill or one like it will defi
nitely be passed in one year, after
President Bush is gone." he said.
"ITien we'll have to negotiate with
other countries to reduce their own
emissions."
/n 2001, Schneider discovered
that he had fairly far advanced
mantle-cell lymphoma. After
chemotherapy and some un
orthodox treatment, he is now
in molecular remission — there are
no detectable cancer cells in his body.
Describing his personal struggle
with cancer, he wrote "The Patient
from Hell," a book in which he talks

about taking the driver's seat and de
signing his own. pioneering treat
ment plan. Today, he still advises
other cancer patients on how to get
the most out of theii treatment by
collaborating with their doctors.
Schneider married Professor
Terry Root, who is a senior fellow at
the Center for Environmental Sci
ence and Policy, in 1995. Root is also
on the IPCC. and her office at Stan
ford is next door to Schneider's.
Schneider has two kids from a
previous marriage. His son Adam
will enter UCSI) next year as a grad
uate student with interests in osteol
ogy and anthropology. His daughter
Rebecca is finishing a Master's de
gree at the University of Oregon in
history, after studying at Stanford as
an undergraduate.
/n the future. Schneider would
like to write more books, de
velop new courses and create a
TV series on how to critically
analyze the media coverage of
scientific issues.
The kid who built his own tele
scope is now trying to help others see

the intricacies of nature and the ef
feet that people have on it — very fit
ting for a lifelong scientific do-good
er.
