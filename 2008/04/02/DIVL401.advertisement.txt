Two New Ethics in Society Courses
for Spring Quarter
ETHICSOC 136R -- Introduction to Global Justice
(POLISCII36R, 336, INTNLREL 136R); Tue/Thu 9:00 -10:30 AM
Contemporary global politics raises a host of urgent and controversial moral questions. Are rich countries doing
enough to help poor countries? Is WTO policy skewed in favor of the developed world? Should we impose sanc
tions on countries that violate human rights? Should global institutions be made more democratic? Are our immi
gration policies too tight or too lax? How should the costs of mitigating global climate change be distributed
across countries? This course will discuss some of the more prominent accounts political theorists have offered
of the nature and foundations of our duties to foreigners (e.g. global liberal egalitarianism, political liberalism,
nationalism, utilitarianism) and consider how those different approaches might be applied to the above and other I
concrete issues in global politics.
The course requires no previous knowledge of political theory, and should be of interest to students in political
science, international relations, philosophy, ethics in society, law and economics. Syllabus available at
syllabus.stanford.edu.
ETHICSOC 179 M - Libertarianism and Its Critics
Tue/Thu 12:35 ■ 2:05 PM
We will examine libertarian arguments about: whether taxing some persons' market incomes in order to provide
benefits to others is a form of theft; whether such taxation is morally equivalent to forcing some persons to work
for others; whether the minimum wage unjustly infringes freedom of contract; how people may acquire moral own
ership of natural resources; the proper role of government. Readings from Nozick, Milton Friedman, Hayek and
G.A. Cohen, among others.
