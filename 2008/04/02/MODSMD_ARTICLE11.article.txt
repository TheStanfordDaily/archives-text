Scientists from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley will collaborate in a new
stem cell initiative that has the poten
tial to reverse the effects of diabetes,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, among
other human diseases.
The Siebel Stem Cell Institute will
bring together the two California uni
versities' top scientists from the fields
of biology, chemistry, engineering and
computer science. Research will be
conducted by both the Stanford Stem
Cell Bioloav and Regenerative

Medicine Institute and the Berkeley
Stem Cell Center, and plans are in
place at each facility to make space for
the other school's researchers.
The institute is funded by a $ l > mil
lion gil t from the Thomas and Stacey
Siebel Foundation. An additional
$1.5 million and an equal match from
the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation will establish at Berkeley
the Thomas and Stacey Siebel
Distinguished Chair in Stem Cell
Research, allowing the school to con
duct additional research in areas
related to stem cell research.
The Stanford component of the
institute will be run by Irving
Weissman, director of the Stanford
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine Institute.
