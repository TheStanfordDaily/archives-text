## Editorial Board On-campus dining options too few during break 
### 
Students who spent this year's spring
break here at Stanford quickly learned
that all the dining halls were closed for
the entire week from Friday evening to the
following Sunday evening, and that options
outside of the dining hall system were slim.
The Axe & Palm was open only during the
weekdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Subway
was open for limited hours during the day
and the only other Tresidder option was
The Treehouse.
However, The Treehouse does not ac
cept Cardinal Dollars, so a student spend
ing the break on campus had to pay for any
meals at this establishment out of her own
pocket. Not all students can pay for a full
week of meals. In fact, one typical reason
for staying on campus during spring break
is that a student can't afford a trip home —
let alone Cabo or Cancun. Leaving these
students without a dining hall is effectively
leaving them without food.
Logically, it seems that some of the stu
dents most likely to be on campus this past
week are students with the least financial
resources. This decision to shut down din
ing halls disproportionately affects these
students. These students are least likely to
have cars, least likely to be able to afford
meals and more likely to be on campus.
Given the University's recent push to in
crease opportunities for low-income stu
dents, it seems Stanford might be missing
the bigger picture.
Spring break falls between two quar
ters. so it is technically not a part of either
quarter's meal plan. Yet, Stanford Dining
could work around this problem by allow
ing students to build up meals throughout
winter quarter when they miss meals or al
lowing students to use guest meals from
winter quarter over spring break.
Freshmen are another group that are
heavily impacted because they cannot
have cars. While it's true that the Mar
guerite did run during spring break, it isn't
the easiest way to go grocery shopping,
particularly because you have to go all the
way to the Safeway at San Antonio Shop
ping Center.There are many other options
like Zip Cars and Enterprise-Rent-A-Car,
but once again, these cost money.
In addition, many students who have
never lived in Mirrielees or on their own
aren't used to making balanced and nutri

tious meals. Mow many "meals" this past
week do you think consisted of Easy Mac?
Or Ramen? Stanford strives to promote
healthy eating and exercising. Students
struggle to find this balance when the din
ing halls are open. Healthy eating is even
harder when the fresh cut vegetables and
fruits of the dining hall aren't available.

Leaving these
students without a
dining hall is
effectively leaving
them without food.

When students are left to try to eat out
of kitchenettes without any guidance on
what to eat. the appliances and the ingredi
ents will likely be inadequate. Many kitch
enettes aren't equipped with the pot. pans
and utensils that are required to cook.This
is not to say that it is impossible or even dif
ficult to cook well-balanced and nutritious
meals on a small budget in a short amount
of time, but most students aren't prepared
for these tasks — and didn't realize the
need to be until recently discovering the
closure of the dining halls during break.
All of these problems have a simple fix:
keep a single dining hall open during
spring break. Only one dining hall would
need to be open for brunch and dinner.The
University shouldn't keep the residence
halls open without having reasonable din
ing options on campus. It is irresponsible to
assume that all students can afford this
lack of service.
