# You're Not Special
## A 						temple of my very own 
### 
I always enjoy watching public figures
crash and burn, and this has been a great
year for it: Eliot Spitzer, Larry Craig,
Michael Vick. But in my mind, I don't think
any of these people did anything wrong.
ITiese men are only guilty of breaking arbi
trary societal taboos.
What moral principle does hiring a pros
titute break? If it is illegal to hire someone to
have sex with you. then why is it legal to pay
two people to have sex and film it? And if it
is considered cruel to make animals fight for
your amusement, why is it legal to force
them to race each other, or to force-feed
them in tiny cages just to satisfy the public's
insatiable desire for buffalo wings?
Every society has taboos — Hindu cul
ture forbids menstruating women from en
tering a Hindu temple.The difference is that
in America we feel this need to justify our
social taboos rationally. We try to tell people
that these laws are for their own benefit. But
they're not. I'm sure people would be much
happier if they were allowed to do what they
wanted. Personally. I think I'd enjoy a good
dog fight. ITiere are all kinds of countries
where watching animals kill each other is
perfectly legal and no harm has come to
their people. For instance, the forty thou
sand people I saw at a bull-fight in
Barcelona didn't seem to be a terribly cruel
set.
I think we make these arbitrary restric
tions, however, so that we know who we can
trust. By banning things people enjoy, we can
test how much someone cares about societal
approval. People who are unable to restrain
their impulses, even when they know what
they are doing is considered "wrong," should
not be allowed to enjoy positions of power
over other people.
If someone is willing to break the law in
order to gain some momentary pleasure, it
tells us that he doesn't really care about
those around him or the integrity of civil so
ciety. It does not matter whether the law

makes sense. What matters is that society has
decreed that certain things are not to be
done. And if someone is willing to ignore
what other people tell him to do, it indicates
that he places his own well-being above that
of those around him. And everyone else
should be wary of placing trust in someone
who cares more about his own self-interest
than in obeying the law. This distrust can be
extremely valuable information in situations
where a breach might not be nearly so visi
ble, like business deals or government ad
ministration.
Seen in this light,many laws make perfect
sense,especially those dealing with drug use,
which often limit a behavior that is not di
rectly harmful to other people and is gener
ally enjoyable. In the same way that a
Catholic might show his obedience to God
by not eating meat on Fridays, we require
that everyone in America show his obedi
ence to public opinion by not smoking mar
ijuana.
The consequences of breaking one of
these taboos are not particularly dire, legally
speaking. 1 doubt Eliot Spitzer or Larry
Craig arc going to become part of the prison
population. But the social consequences,
such as having to resign from the governor
ship, are completely justified. At some level,
obeying the law becomes its own morality.
And a failure to obey becomes a sin in and of
Itself
