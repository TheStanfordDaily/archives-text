# Co-terminal Illness
## Two thoughts for today 
### 
I wrote two short columns this week. I'm
gonna say it's in honor of Motorola split
ting up into two companies, but that's a lie.
Hey, remember the StarTac?That was a great
phone.
The Wilbur 1 Jmo
The Wilbur Limo mystery has been
solved. In my last column. I saluted the then
unknown owner of a late-1980s model
stretch limousine in the Wilbur parking. Hut
now, our shadowy livery lothario has a name:
Zavain Dar.
I'm convinced that there are two types of
people in the world: those who let their moth
ers dissuade them from crazy ideas and those
who don't. Guess which type Dar is. At the
beginning of last quarter, the sophomore had
the chance to buy the 1987 Chrysler Fifth Av
enue stretch limousine for $fi(X). Of course.
Momma Dar had some concerns.
"My mom thought it was one of the stu
pider ideas I've ever thought of," he said.
Dar could have abandoned the idea, as so
many others have, and gone to law school, a
place filled with losers who didn't have the
balls to buy that limo in college. Zavain Dar
considered his mother's advice, but in the
end, however, he decided to set his own
course.
"When else are you gonna get to drive a
limo?" he told me with a wink and a smile. We
were on the phone, but no matter.

Dar still hasn't taken the stretch for a
whirl because the car has a flat tire and a dead
battery. Hut the plan is to start a livery busi
ness that could ferry fresh undergrads to for
nials and Pub Night.
It looks like Stanford will end up expand
ing the undergraduate population. When it
happens, let's accept a few more wheeler
dealer-dreamer-schemers like Zavain Dar.
Ibey make the world a hell of a lot more in
teresting place.
The Space-Time continuum he damned
I went to Rose and Crown last night, as
usual, for Trivia Night. And, as usual, I ended
up at Pizza My Heart, a consensus pick for
Worst College Town Pizzeria in the Nation.
Inspired by "Back to the Future," I drew
on my previous experiences at PMH and
wrote a letter to myself to be opened today,
April 2.
Dear David,
You went to Pizza My Heart last night.

You didn't want to, but the bar stopped serv
ing food at 9, and you were really hungry. You
tried to order a plain slice.
"Can I get a plain slice?"
Ilie girl behind the counter gave you a
dull stare.
"Guh, you mean a cheese slice?"
The cheese slice was $3. It was terrible.
The dough was so limp that the crust would
n't told. Some grease dripped on your pants.
Its ok. 1 packed a moist towelette in your
pocket. No, your other pocket.
As you were eating,a Russian woman me
andered over and showed you some orna
ments. They were $15.1 think the money was
for her church. I put all your cash in a back
pocket so you could shake your wallet upside
down and feign poverty. You're welcome.
I'm glad you didn't try to use the bath
room. Two Paly juniors were snorting nut
meg in there. They learned about it on South
Park, 1 think. Or maybe from one of the
homeless guys out front. Anyway, it smelled
bad in there. It's good that you waited to pee.
Oh. did you see the new surfboard they
put up? No? It had green stripes.
Your pal,
David
PS. ( all Mom. She's probably read the bit
about not listening to your mother by now.

David's mom and others can reach him at dher
hert@stanford. edit.
