### ERIN GARTNER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RALEIGII. N.C. (AF) â€” Chelsea Clinton returned Monday
to North Carolina, telling college students that the world will
"breathe a sigh of relief' once President Bush leaves office.
Clinton spoke Monday during a town hall meeting with students
at North Carolina State University. She later moved on to Peace
College in Raleigh to the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Clinton told about 250 people at N.C. State that her mother.
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, would work to repair
the nation's reputation abroad.
"1 think the world will breathe a sigh of relief when this pres
ident is gone." Clinton said, criticizing Bush for pulling out of
various aecordings, including the Kyoto Protocol on global
warming.
She urged the crowd to register to vote and to listen to past
debates between her mother and rival Illinois Sen. Barack
Obama.
She also couldn't avoid questions about her father, good or
bad.
An audience member at N.C. State also pressed Clinton to
discuss the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Clinton declined to discuss
her father's relationship with the White House intern, drawing
applause when she told the young man that it was none of his
business.
Clinton had a similar exchange last week at Butler University.
And in Chapel I fill, she was asked whether a vote for Hillary
Clinton was a vote for Bill Clinton.
"Is a vote for 1 Hilary a vote for Bill? No. A vote for Hillary is
a vote for 1 lillary," she said. "I'm really proud of what my father
did in the "90s. but I don't think you should vote for or against my
mother based on my father."
Also in Chapel Hill. Clinton pinned a light blue ribbon to her
blazer in memory of Eve Carson, the UNC student body presi
dent who was killed March 5.
"It was always Eve's dream to have a presidential campaign
come to campus." said student body vice president Mike Tarrant.
But in September, when the school contacted the campaigns,
"North Carolina didn't really matter," he said.
"It was a great feeling to kind of see her dream come true."
In response to a question about NASA funding, Clinton said
the budgets of many scientific programs have either stayed flat
or been cut. She pointed to Bush's veto of stem cell research bills.
"We don't know what we have lost under this administra
tion," she said.
Both Hillary Clinton and Obama have started to campaign
heavily in North Carolina in preparation for the state's May 6
primary.
Joe Delpapa, a 19-year-old business major at N.C. State, said
the primary gives voters a chance to hear the platforms of the
candidates and what thev think.
