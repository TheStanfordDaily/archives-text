## Calif, delegate battle heats up 
### LAURA KURTZMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Allowing the Democratic
presidential race to continue several more weeks will not
hurt the party's chances in November, former President
Clinton said Sunday, urging those concerned that the
opposite will happen to "chill out" and let the balloting
run its course.
Bill Clinton dismissed suggestions by supporters of
Barack Obama that 1 lillary Rodham Clinton was damag
ing the party by staying in the race even though she is
behind in delegates and unlikely to overtake the Illinois
senator based on the contests to come.
"There is somehow the suggestion that because we are
having a vigorous debate about who would be the best
president, we are going to weaken this party in the fall."
he said Sunday at the state Democratic Party convention.
"("lull out.
"We're going to win this election if we just chill out
and let everybody have their say," Clinton added.
Obama himself said Saturday that the decision about
whether to drop out is for Hillary Clinton to make.
"My attitude is Senator Clinton can run as long as she
wants," he told reporters in Pennsylvania, where he is
campaigning for that state's April 22 primary.
TTie former president flew in from Pennsylvania to
make his pitch at the convention, which attracted a large
number of superdelegates. the elected officials and party
insiders who will determine whether Hillary Clinton or
Obama gets the Democratic presidential nomination.
Nearly one-third of California's 65 named delegates
have yet to choose sides. Unlike the pledged delegates
won in primaries and caucuses, superdelegates are free to
vote for whichever candidate they want.
Of those who have made up their minds in California,
Clinton is far ahead, according to a survey by The
Associated Press. She has 29 superdelegates to Obama's
13. Twenty-one are undecided or say they will not commit
before the party's national convention in August. Two
have not responded.
California will have one more delegate when the San
Francisco Bay area congressional seat left vacant by the
death of Tom Lantos is filled.
Five others will be appointed by the party on May IS,
bringing the total to 71.
Clinton delivered a similar message during a private
meeting with a couple dozen superdelegates before the
speech.
"He talked a little bit about letting the process play
out," said Christine Pelosi, an undecided superdelegate
from San Francisco who attended and described Clinton
as "very good, very intense." Pelosi is the daughter of
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
