## Facebook privacy is compromised 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —A
security lapse made it possible for
unwelcome strangers to peruse per
sonal photos posted on Facebook
Inc.'s popular online hangout, cir
cumventing a recent upgrade to the
Web site's privacy controls.
The Associated Press verified the
loophole Monday after receiving a
tip from a Byron Ng. a Vancouver.
Canada computer technician. Ng
began looking for security weakness
es last week after Facebook unveiled
more ways for 67 million members
to restrict access to their personal
profiles.
But the added protections
weren't enough to prevent Ng from
pulling up the most recent pictures
posted by Facebook members and
their friends, even if the privacy set
tings were set to restrict the audience
to a select few.
After being alerted Monday
afternoon, Facebook spokeswoman
Brandee Barker said the Palo Alto
based company fixed the bug within
an hour.
"We take privacy very seriously
and continue to make enhancements
to the site," she said.
The latest lapse serves as another
reminder of the perils of sharing sen
sitive photos and personal informa
tion online, even when Web sites
pledge to shield the information
from prying eyes.
Before the fix. Ng's computer

coding trick enabled him to find pri
vate pictures of Paris Hilton at the
Emmy awards and of her brother
Barron Nicholas drinking a beer
with friends and photos of many
other people who hadn't granted
access to Ng.
Using Ng's template, an AP
reporter was able to look up random
people on Facebook and see the
most recent pictures posted on their
personal profiles even if the photos
were supposed to be invisible to
strangers.
The revealed snapshots showed
Italian vacations, office gatherings,
holiday parties and college students
on spring break. The AP also was
able to click through a personal
photo album that Facebook co
founder Mark Zuckerberg posted in
November 2(X)5.
Some members of social net
works like Facebook post photos of
themselves or others in potentially
embarrassing or compromising situ
ations that include illegal drug use or
underage drinking that can cause
trouble at school or work. None of
the photos reviewed by the AP
appeared to fall into this category.
Despite the risks, more people
than ever - especially teenagers and
young adults - are publishing person
al photos and other intimate details
about their lives on the Internet.
News Corp.'s MySpace.com, the
only online social network larger
than Facebook, suffered a security
breach that exposed its members'
private photos earlier this year.
