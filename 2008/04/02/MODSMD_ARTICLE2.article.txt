## SSE to fund projects by students Ventures program to back student entrepreneurs 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If the next great business proposal
comes from the Farm, Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) is establishing a new
division to fund it â€” SSE Ventures.
SSE Ventures, whose mission is "to be
the premiere destination for student
entrepreneurs looking for financial
backing, as well as the resources critical
to every start-up company," will evaluate
applications for business proposals from
teams composed of Stanford graduate
and undergraduate students.
After an initial cut, remaining propos
als will be evaluated by an advisory
board of prominent figures within the
venture capital community. These
include SSE Ventures' corporate part
ners Charles River Ventures and the
Founders Fund, and noted "angel
investor" and Computer Science Prof.
Rajeev Motwani.
SSE aims for the division to establish
ties with the venture capital community.
"We want to provide a tangible con
nection to the [venture capital] commu
nity," said SSE CEO Matt McDonald
'05. "This will allow student entrepre
neurs to have their ideas exposed to
them."
SSE will invest its available resources
in a small number of ideas, with as much
as $50,000 or $100,000 devoted to each
proposal, depending on the needs of the
final selections.
"We want to have high-impact fund
ing," said SSE COO and incoming CEO
Matt McLaughlin '08."We want to throw
more than the typical $5k to $15k at
these ideas and invest much more in two
or three proposals."
"We want to fund the ideas that are
the best of the best," he added.
The division will also provide stu
dents with a measure of support and
guidance in taking their ideas into the
business world.
"Students usually try to go out to try
to get seed money directly from profes
sional investors." Motwani said. "This
will provide initial support from inside of
the campus to help move concepts to
something fundable. It should help ease
the pain of transitioning from on-eampus
to off-campus."
Though SSE Ventures aims to
support the student body, decisions
for funding the projects still will he
approached with a business-oriented
mindset.
"We're treating these ideas like
investment vehicles," McLaughlin
said. "We will provide the seed
money and, in looking at applica
tions. we'll be providing a realistic
assessment of whether the idea is
going to fly."
SSE Ventures comes after prior
SSE initiatives, including the
Business Leadership Program and
custom products division. After
months of work, details for Ventures
were finalized in January 2008.
"People at SSE were thinking of
what would be a good new idea for
the student body, and this came up,"
McDonald said. "This had been
thought of in the past but never
implemented, to have this kind of
incubator program."
The team will be making itself
available for consultation prior to
the first-round Apr. 27 application
deadline.
"We hover around our email,"
McLaughlin said. "We pride our
selves on being responsive, and we're
open to meeting with people to dis
cuss their ideas, though there won't
be any set information session."
Promotion of the new division
will begin this week, with the intent
of raising awareness on campus.
"We're in this for the long-term,
and there's a real focus on long-term
branding," McLaughlin said. "We
want everyone to be familiar with
our name, and to introduce ourselves
to the Stanford community. We're
here to stay."
