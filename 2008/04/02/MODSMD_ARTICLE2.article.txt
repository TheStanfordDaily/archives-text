## SSE to fund projects by students Ventures program to back student entrepreneurs 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If the next great business proposal
comes from the Farm, Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) is establishing a new
division to fund it â€” SSE Ventures.
SSE Ventures, whose mission is "to be
the premiere destination for student
entrepreneurs looking for financial
backing, as well as the resources critical
to every start-up company," will evaluate
applications for business proposals from
teams composed of Stanford graduate
and undergraduate students.
After an initial cut, remaining propos

proposal, depending on the needs of the
final selections.

Matt McLaughlin '08."We want to throw
more than the typical $5k to $15k at
these ideas and invest much more in two
or three proposals."
"We want to fund the ideas that are
the best of the best," he added.
The division will also provide stu
dents with a measure of support and
guidance in taking their ideas into the
business world.
"Students usually try to go out to try
to get seed money directly from profes

will provide initial support from inside of
the campus to help move concepts to
something fundable. It should help ease
the pain of transitioning from on-eampus
