stones in front of Virginia Tech's administration building
will stand as the school's permanent memorial to the
victims of last April's campus killings, the school's pres

Visitors on the progress of changes made on campus and
plans for marking the anniversary of the campus shootings.
The school plans to establish a peace center in the
classroom building where Cho killed 30 victims and him
self. provost Mark McNamee told the board. Renovation

of the second-floor classrooms could begin this summer,
he said.
Steger stressed to the board the importance of garner
ing broad support for new initiatives.
"No matter what we implement it's not going to be
successful if it does not have the support of the university
community." he said.
ITie school already has implemented an emergency
alert system involving text messages, e-mails and online
messages, and Steger said Monday that each general pur
pose classroom also will have an electronic banner that
will broadcast emergencies.
The school is also considering installing surveillance
cameras outside the student center and possibly some dor
mitories, Steger said.
"You don't want to turn this into Big Brother or
'1984,'" he said.
Steger said he expected all the recommendations
received from a panel appointed by Gov. Timothy M.
Kaine and from internal reviews to be implemented by
next fall.
Kaine will speak at a ceremony April 16. the one-year
anniversary of the shootings, at which the names of the
victims will be read, the board was told.
