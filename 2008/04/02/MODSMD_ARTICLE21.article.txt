## RESTED, REFRESHED Stanford returns from finals break with three consecutive victories 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks off just might have
been what the Stanford men's tennis
team needed. Ibe No. 34 Cardinal
men returned to action over spring
break after a hiatus for finals and
rolled out three wins, including two
over Pac-10 conference foes. The ac
tion started last Monday, when the
Cardinal easily handled Brown Uni
versity. 6-1, in its final tuneup match
before Pac-10 play. The No. 75 Bears
were no match for Stanford, even as
the Cardinal mixed things up a bit in
doubles.
Juniors Matt Bruch and Blake
Muller rejoined as partners at No. 1
doubles for just the second time this
season. At No. 2 doubles, freshman
Alex Clayton partnered with sopho
more Paul Morrissey for the first time
this season. Both teams easily won
their matches and the Cardinal went
up 1-0.
It was great to be back in the lineup
again after being out for a while," said
Morrissey. "I think we came out and
played a great match in the first dual
match we played together."
The only blemish from thereon out
on the Cardinal scorecard was fresh
man Ted Kelly's loss at No. 6 singles to
Noah Gardner from Brown. Stanford
was victorious at the No. I through 5
spots, including freshman Alex Clay
ton's 20th singles victory of the season.
Matt and Blake started right back
where they left off," head coach John
Whitlinger said, referring to the duo's
run to the NCAA Championships last
season. "We know how good they can
be. They are one of the best teams in
the country."
Hie second match of the week was
the most anticipated for Stanford, as
they got another shot at No. 15 Ari
zona State. Two weeks ago, Stanford
ended a road swing through Arizona
with a tough 4-3 loss to the Sun Devils.
Ilie players felt that match could have
been won, and were looking forward
