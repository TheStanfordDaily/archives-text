the big spots and we didn't.Tonight we had
plenty of opportunities, but no hits."
l"he Cardinal had several opportunities
to cushion its lead but caught a few tough
breaks when trying to gather the timely hits
needed to start off a rally. In the bottom of
the second, senior Randy Molina and junior
Sean Ratliff led off the Cardinal offense
with back-to-back singles off of Hawaii's
right hander Matt Daly. Pinch hitter Austin
Yount walked to load the bases.
Freshman Colin Walsh had an inauspi
cious beginning to only his second start of
the season after hitting a grounder to short
stop Jonathan Hee which led to a double
play.The play brought in Molina to put the
Cardinal on the board, 1-0. Toby Gerhart
was unable to rally the offense with two outs
against him and eventually struck out to end
the inning.
Stanford's most important scoring op
portunity came in the bottom of the eighth
with the score knotted at 2. Ratlifl led off
with a shot to right field that earned him a
stand-up leadoff triple. With the go-ahead
run just 90 feet away from home plate, the
Cardinal still was unable to drive Ratliff in.

The big hitter for the Rainbow Warriors


JEFF KEACHER/Tfie Stanford Daily
Stanford senior Randy Molina was 3-for-4, but the Cardinal still couldn't muster the offense to
defeat the Rainbow Warriors.
last night was (iarcia. who came into
the game with a .175 hatting average
which improved to a .227 after he
went three for-foui. Van Doornum
also added to Hawaii's hit tally with
three hits on five plate appearances
and an RBI. DuPree. I lee and Mont
plaisir had two hits apiece as I lawaii
outhit the Cardinal 13-9 for the night.
Stanford did put up a good fight
though, with both Ratliff and Molina
getting three hits on four at bats
which brings their hitting streaks up
to 11 and seven games, respectively.
Junior C ord Phelps added one hit to
the Cardinal box score which brings
his streak to a career-high-tying and
season-high eight in a row. Phelps
also extended his on base streak to 27
consecutive games.
ITiough Stanford did have a few
bit hits, it was unable to put any run

ninth against winning pitcher Josh
Kramer; the game ended 5-2 in favor
of the Rainbows. I"he Cardinal loss
brought Hawaii's six-game losing
streak to a close. A tough loss to take,
it may have killed some of Stanford's
momentum going into this week
end's series with Arizona State, the
No. I team in the nation.
"Arizona State is very good and
very sound." Marquess said. "We will
have to play very well to beat them.
We will have to see how things go
since they have only lost tine game so
far. Hopefully we will bounce back

and play well."
Ihe series with ASU begins this
Friday at 6 p.m. when the Cardinal

Junior C ord Phelps added one hit to
the Cardinal box score which brings
his streak to a career-high-tying and
season-high eight in a row. Phelps
also extended his on base streak to 27
consecutive games.
ITiough Stanford did have a few
bit hits, it was unable to put any run
ners on base in the bottom of the
ninth against winning pitcher Josh
Kramer; the game ended 5-2 in favor
of the Rainbows. I"he Cardinal loss
brought Hawaii's six-game losing
streak to a close. A tough loss to take,
it may have killed some of Stanford's
momentum going into this week
end's series with Arizona State, the
No. I team in the nation.
"Arizona State is very good and
very sound." Marquess said. "We will
have to play very well to beat them.
We will have to see how things go
since they have only lost tine game so
far. Hopefully we will bounce back

and play well."
Ihe series with ASU begins this
Friday at 6 p.m. when the Cardinal
takes on the Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond.

the game until the top of the ninth inning
when Hawaii's power hitter Jonathan I lee
— who was 2-3 with a double and 3 RBIs —
hit a sacrifice fly to bring in Sean Mont
plaisir.
"We didn't do much with the bats, coach
Mark Marquess said. "We had a couple of
opportunities to score big runs but we didn t
take advantage of them. Our main opportu
nity to take the lead came in the eighth. 1
have to give them credit because they won
the big spots and we didn't.Tonight we had
plenty of opportunities, but no hits."
l"he Cardinal had several opportunities
to cushion its lead but caught a few tough
breaks when trying to gather the timely hits
needed to start off a rally. In the bottom of
the second, senior Randy Molina and junior
Sean Ratliff led off the Cardinal offense
with back-to-back singles off of Hawaii's
right hander Matt Daly. Pinch hitter Austin
Yount walked to load the bases.
Freshman Colin Walsh had an inauspi
cious beginning to only his second start of
the season after hitting a grounder to short
stop Jonathan Hee which led to a double
play.The play brought in Molina to put the
Cardinal on the board, 1-0. Toby Gerhart
was unable to rally the offense with two outs
against him and eventually struck out to end
the inning.
Stanford's most important scoring op
portunity came in the bottom of the eighth
with the score knotted at 2. Ratlifl led off
with a shot to right field that earned him a
stand-up leadoff triple. With the go-ahead
run just 90 feet away from home plate, the
Cardinal still was unable to drive Ratliff in.
