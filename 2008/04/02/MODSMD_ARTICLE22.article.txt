Diamond last night, the Stanford baseball
team lost 5-2. The Cardinal never trailed in
the game until the top of the ninth inning
when Hawaii's power hitter Jonathan I lee

hit a sacrifice fly to bring in Sean Mont
plaisir.
"We didn't do much with the bats, coach
Mark Marquess said. "We had a couple of
opportunities to score big runs but we didn t
take advantage of them. Our main opportu
nity to take the lead came in the eighth. 1
have to give them credit because they won
the big spots and we didn't.Tonight we had
plenty of opportunities, but no hits."
l"he Cardinal had several opportunities
to cushion its lead but caught a few tough
breaks when trying to gather the timely hits
needed to start off a rally. In the bottom of
the second, senior Randy Molina and junior
Sean Ratliff led off the Cardinal offense
with back-to-back singles off of Hawaii's
right hander Matt Daly. Pinch hitter Austin
Yount walked to load the bases.
Freshman Colin Walsh had an inauspi
cious beginning to only his second start of
the season after hitting a grounder to short
stop Jonathan Hee which led to a double
play.The play brought in Molina to put the
Cardinal on the board, 1-0. Toby Gerhart
was unable to rally the offense with two outs
against him and eventually struck out to end
the inning.
Stanford's most important scoring op
portunity came in the bottom of the eighth
with the score knotted at 2. Ratlifl led off
with a shot to right field that earned him a
stand-up leadoff triple. With the go-ahead
run just 90 feet away from home plate, the
Cardinal still was unable to drive Ratliff in.
Junior Brent Milleville hit a line drive
straight to Jonathan Hee, freshman pinch
