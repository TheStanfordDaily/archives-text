## Stanford drops first two matches after break 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a three-week hiatus, the No. 8 Stan
ford men's volleyball team was well-rested,
but came out flat last weekend, losing a pair of
three-game matches to No. 5 Pepperdine and
No. 11 Southern California on the road.
"We practiced twice during Dead Week
and then took Finals off," head coach John
Kosty said of the break. "Historically, the
break has helped us. We have usually come
into the break period either beat up or tired
from the season, looking to regroup.
" Ihis year was different —we came into
the break playing well and really competing,
and I think the break hurt us a little bit. We are
a little out of sync right now. but we are back in
practice and working on a few things."

matches 3-0 at USC and Pepperdine lost weekend and
hasn't won since defeating this same UC-San Diego

Card, which hasn't played on the Farm since hosting
Hawaii in late February.
