## Stanford drops first two matches after break 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a three-week hiatus, the No. 8 Stan
ford men's volleyball team was well-rested,
but came out flat last weekend, losing a pair of
three-game matches to No. 5 Pepperdine and
No. 11 Southern California on the road.
"We practiced twice during Dead Week
and then took Finals off," head coach John
Kosty said of the break. "Historically, the
break has helped us. We have usually come
into the break period either beat up or tired
from the season, looking to regroup.
" Ihis year was different —we came into
the break playing well and really competing,
and I think the break hurt us a little bit. We are
a little out of sync right now. but we are back in
practice and working on a few things."

GAME NOTES: Stanford is coming oft losing consecutive
matches 3-0 at USC and Pepperdine lost weekend and
hasn't won since defeating this same UC-San Diego
squad before the break for finals almost a month ago.
This is the first of four consecutive home matches for the
Card, which hasn't played on the Farm since hosting
Hawaii in late February.
Waves close, falling 30-22, 30-27. 31-
29, hut could not keep up with the
Trojans, losing the three games 30-26,
30-21,30-19. With two more weeks of
MPSF play before the conference
tournament and an even 9-9 record.
Stanford is currently in sixth place in
the league standings.
On Friday night, sophomore op
posite Evan Romero led the Cardinal
with 17 kills, second only to Pepper
dine's Paul Carroll who led all play
ers with 24 kills and four aces. Senior
outside hitter Matt Ceran and fresh
man outside Spencer McLachlin
were also in double digits on offense.
Romero and McLachlin had a team
high nine kills each against USC (12-
13,9-10).
"For the weekend, our serving
game [hurt us]," Kosty said. "We
needed to serve tougher, not neces
sarily better but tougher. Both Pep
perdine and USC are good passing
teams and we needed to serve tough
and create opportunities to score
points, and we did not do that."
The Waves (12-8,11-8) got off to a
quick start with the first three points
of the night, and led 15-9 at the mid
way point. From there the teams trad
ed points before Pepperdine
stretched the gap to eight, winning
30-22 on a Carroll kill.
The Cardinal kept close to Pep
perdine to start the second game, but
could never get on top.The Waves led
by as much as six points before Stan
ford came back, trailing by just one at
27-26 after a Romero kill. But Pep
perdine held on for the 30-27 victory.
Stanford took its first lead of the
night to start the third game and trad
ed one-point leads with Pepperdine.
ITie game saw the score tied an as
tounding 27 times before the Cardi
nal built the largest lead of the game
at 28-26 on back-to-back Romero
kills. The Waves answered with three
straight and — though the Cardinal
held off one match point — finally
ended the game 31-29 on a block.
"In the third game, we had our
point-scoring opportunity and didn't
make the play, couldn't get a good
swing," Kosty said. "We were up 28-
26 and couldn't convert. They sided
out and we were still up, but there was
more pressure on us and they ended
up stealing that game."
With the trio of Romero, Ceran
and McLachlin leading the way on of
fense, sophomore setter Kawika
Shoji anchored the defense with nine
digs, also dishing out 39 assists and

recording the Cardinal's only service
ace. Junior middle blocker Cameron
Christoffers had a team-high four
blocks.
Against USC on Saturday, Stan
ford struggled with consistency and
was outblocked 11-5 by the Trojans.
Romero and McLachlin led the
squad with nine kills each.
The Trojans built the first substan
tial lead of the night with a three
point spurt out of a 10-10 tie and
would not let up. Stanford came back
to tie at 17, but the Trojans strung to
gether four straight to put the game
out of reach. USC put the game away
at 30-26 with a kill.
To start the second game, the Tro
jans went on an 8-2 run and would not
let the Cardinal get closer than two
points. A five-point run put the game
out of reach and a block ended the
frame, 30-21.
Stanford again struggled out of
the gate in the third game, quickly
falling behind by five. The Cardinal
cut the lead to just three before the
Trojans used another long run to
build a double-digit advantage. USC
closed out the match with a 10-4 run
to clinch the sweep.
"We've got to give USC a lot of
credit," Kosty said."They played real
ly well — from what I've seen on
video this season, this was the best
they have played. The better team
won that night. I would love to see
them again, to get a third game with
them |in the MPSF tournament]."
In addition to his nine kills,
McLachlin recorded the Cardinal's
only two aces and had a March-high
11 digs. Shoji finished with 31 assists
and tied with Ceran and sophomore
middle blocker Garrett Werner with
two blocks each.
"We are focusing right now on get
ting our consistency back in our serv
ing game and blocking defense,"
Kosty said. "We are a half-step out of
rhythm, but we are close to putting it
back together. I don't foresee any
problems in doing that, but we face
really tough opponents in the last
four home games."
'Ihe Cardinal will finish out the
MPSF season at home, hosting UC-
San Diego and Long Beach State on
Friday and Saturday night, and then
UCLA and UC-lrvine the following
weekend. Ihe MPSF tournament will
then begin on April 16.
