BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Indi
ana University will hire Marquette's
Tom Crean as its basketball coach
and is expected to introduce him at a
news conference Wednesday. Uni
versity trustee Philip Eskew con
firmed the hiring. Eskew said Crean
had signed a letter-of-intent with the
university and was meeting with his
team Tuesday night.
Team spokesman J.D. Campbell
said a news conference had yet to be
scheduled.
The hiring comes near the end of a
tumultuous six-week period in which
former Hoosiers coach Kelvin
Sampson resigned amid an NCAA
scandal, interim coach Dan Dakich
replaced him and then lost four of
seven games.
Dakich also suspended guard Ja
marcus Ellis for disciplinary reasons
for the I loosiers' game at Penn State,
and announced Tuesday that Ellis
and guard Armon Bassett had been
kicked off the team for missing two
scheduled events.
Crean, who led Marquette to the
Final Four in 2(XJ3. will responsible
for rebuilding not only Indiana's rep
utation as a national power but also
its sullied image as a squeaky clean
program.

"1 think he's a great choice,"
Eskew said. "He has a Big Ten back
ground, a Midwest background, he's
recruited in the state of Indiana and
he has an impeccable record, so 1
think Indiana is on the road to recov
ery."
Now the question is what kind of
team will Crean inherit.
Starting forwards D.J. White and
Lance Stemler both finished their
senior seasons, and it's uncertain
whether Bassett and Ellis, two of the
starting guards, will return after
being punished for missing an ap
pointment last week. When they did
n't show up to run laps the next day,
Dakich decided to dismiss them
from the team.
On Monday, freshman Eric Gor
don is expected to announce
whether he will declare early for the
NBA. Most figure, he's leaving,
which would leave Indiana without
all five of its regular starters from last
season.
Outside the administration, the
decision was greeted warmly, too.
"I think it's a very good move,"
said Jared Jeffries, a former Indiana
star now playing for the New York
Knicks. "He's proven himself to be a
successful college coach at this level,
a very good recruiter, recognize tal
ent. ITiat's who we need at Indiana,
we need somebody who is going to

be stable, a foundation for our fu
ture."
Knicks coach lsiah Thomas, who
led Indiana to the 1981 national title,
also endorsed the move.
Some thought Thomas might be a
candidate to take over at his alma
mater, but Thomas, who has never
coached at the college level, said
Sunday he was never contacted by
university officials.
"He's got a brilliant basketball
mind — definitely a good hire for
Indiana — 1 was very vocal about
Dan getting the job. but Tom is defi
nitely qualified and will do an excel
lent job at Indiana,"Thomas said be
fore his game in Milwaukee on Tues
day. "Any way that 1 can help him. 1
definitely will."
Crean went 190-96 in nine sea
sons at Marquette. He leaves for a
job that came open after Sampson's
latest alleged missteps with the
NCAA.
Sampson left in February amid a
phone-call scandal that brought five
allegations of major infractions from
the NCAA. Dakich's promotion to
interim coach fueled threats of a
player boycott and the Hoosiers (25-
8) never recovered. They lost four of
their final seven games, including a
last-second defeat against Minneso
ta in the Big Ten tournament quar
terfinals and an 86-72 loss to
Arkansas in the first round of the
NCAA tournament.
Since firing Bob Knight in Sep
tember 2(MX). a move that sharply di
vided Indiana fans, the Hoosiers
have failed to find a suitable succes
sor. Mike Davis, who replaced
Knight, never won enough to satisfy

Indiana's rabid fans, and it took
Sampson, Davis' successor, less than
two years to stain the university's
once-impeccable reputation for
playing by the rules.
Sampson took the Indiana job in
March 2006 and two months later
was penalized by the NCAA for
making 577 impermissible phone
calls between 20(H) and 2004 when he
was coaching Oklahoma.
The second wave of charges
emerged in October when a universi
ty investigation found Sampson and
his staff made more than 100 imper
missible calls while still under re
cruiting restrictions and that Samp
son participated in at least 1(J three
way calls, another violation of the
N C A A's pun is h m en t.
Athletic director Rick Greenspan
called the violations secondary, im
posing a one-year extension of the
NCAA's recruiting restrictions and
pulling a $500,000 raise. The
Hoosiers also took away one schol
arship for the 2008-09 season.
However, an NCAA report re
leased Feb. 13 by Indiana claimed
Sampson provided false and mis
leading information to investigators
from both the university and the
NCAA, failed to meet the "generally
recognized high standard of hon
esty" expected in college sports and
failed to promote an atmosphere of
compliance within the program.
Sampson has denied intentionally
providing investigators with false in
formation.
Associated Press sports writer Colin
Fly in Milwaukee also contributed to
this report.
