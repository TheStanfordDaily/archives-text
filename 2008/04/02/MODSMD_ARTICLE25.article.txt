onships, nine of them just freshman.

winning a hard-fought battle for third place

winners of the last five titles, finished fifth with
316. Arizona won the title easily with 500.5
while Texas took second at 406.

"As a team, we
definitely stepped up
to the challenge."

â€” PAUL KORNFELD
Junior captain

When asked what the keys to NCAA suc
cess would be, junior Jason Dunford ex
plained:" We are going to be big underdogs at
this year's NCAAs and in order to stand a
chance of winning we will not be able to af
ford slip up in any events. Guys expected to
make top eight must do so. The relays will
also be vitally important, and thus perfecting
our changeovers in the next few weeks will
be crucial."
For individual events, the Card certainly
stepped up in preliminaries to make the finals.
The top 16 times in the morning session were
guaranteed a swim in the evening as well as
scoring at least a point for their team. The top
eight in the morning were guaranteed to
score at least 11 points, with 20 points going to
the individual event winner.
Relays double the points of individual
swims as the top 16 teams in the morning are
guaranteed to score at least two points and the
national title winner of the relays is given 40
points.
Ihe relays are an integral part of any
team's success as Stanford finaled in all five
relays.
"Overall as a team, we definitely stepped
up to the challenge," said junior captain Paul

Kornfeld."We came away with a hard-fought
third place finish ahead of Cal and the de
fending champions. Auburn. We did pretty
well each morning doing what we needed to
do in prelims to get into finals.
" That is how you really move up in the
team standings, by getting lots of people into
the final heat."
The Stanford 200 freestyle relay team of
Jason Dunford. freshman Austin Staab. soph
omore David Dunford and sophomore Eu
gene Godsoe took fourth in the finals with a
time of 1:17.47. Stanford came in third for the

school history, while the 200 was second
fastest in school history. Kornfeld is currently
vying for a spot on the Canadian Olympic
team in the 100 meter breast.
"1 was definitely confident I could win the
breaststrokes in finals.That had been my goal
all season." said Kornfeld. "The key for me
was to swim my own race and not worry about
what everyone else was doing. I wasn't first at
the 50 in the 100 or at the 1(X) in the 200, but 1
was in control of my swim the whole time and
it worked out."
