## Cardinal takes three of four after the break 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
If there has been any indication in the past,
the weakness for the No. 5 Stanford women's
tennis is close matches played away from the
Farm. After a two-week hiatus to rest and re
cuperate. the Cardinal women hoped to re
verse this trend with a tough four-game
stretch over six days, including three straight
road matches.
Despite their best efforts, the Cardinal
women dropped their first Pacific-10 Confer
ence encounter at No. 13 Arizona State in a 4-
3 decision.
After the loss, Stanford rebounded with a
6-1 victory at Arizona.
Finishing 3-1 on the week, the Cardinal
dropped to 13-4 on the season, its first four
loss campaign since l l >B7 when the team fin
ished 22-4.
Stanford is also a disappointing 5-4 on the
road this season, with three of the losses com
ing in 4-3 decisions.
More importantly, Stanford dropped to 1-1
in conference play, with crucial matches
against No. 8 Southern California, No. 9
UCLA and No. 6 California left to be played.
Last season, Stanford finished a perfect 8-0
in conference play for their 21st straight con
ference title.
Though the streak is in jeopardy after the
Arizona split, Stanford will face their Califor
nia rivals all at the TaubeTennis Center, where
the team has won 101 straight regular-season
home matches.
