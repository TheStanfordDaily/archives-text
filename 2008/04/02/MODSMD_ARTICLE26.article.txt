## Cardinal takes three of four after the break 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
If there has been any indication in the past,
the weakness for the No. 5 Stanford women's
tennis is close matches played away from the
Farm. After a two-week hiatus to rest and re
cuperate. the Cardinal women hoped to re
verse this trend with a tough four-game
stretch over six days, including three straight
road matches.
Despite their best efforts, the Cardinal
women dropped their first Pacific-10 Confer
ence encounter at No. 13 Arizona State in a 4-
3 decision.
After the loss, Stanford rebounded with a
6-1 victory at Arizona.
Finishing 3-1 on the week, the Cardinal
dropped to 13-4 on the season, its first four
loss campaign since l l >B7 when the team fin
ished 22-4.
Stanford is also a disappointing 5-4 on the
road this season, with three of the losses com
ing in 4-3 decisions.
More importantly, Stanford dropped to 1-1
in conference play, with crucial matches
against No. 8 Southern California, No. 9
UCLA and No. 6 California left to be played.
Last season, Stanford finished a perfect 8-0
in conference play for their 21st straight con
ference title.
Though the streak is in jeopardy after the
Arizona split, Stanford will face their Califor
nia rivals all at the TaubeTennis Center, where
the team has won 101 straight regular-season
home matches.

GAME NOTES The Cardinal is 3-1 since breaking for fi
nals, their one loss coming at No. 15 Arizona State last
weekend. Stanford defeated USC 4-3 when they trav
eled to Los Angeles in early March. Stanford is cunently
ranked No. 5 in the nation.
Stanford began its spring break
with a routine 6-1 victory over No.
66 Cal Poly for its fourth straight
home victory.
In the match, junior Jessica
Nguyen became the first Cardinal
woman to reach 20 wins on the sea
son with a 6-3, 6-1 decision over
Steffi Wong.
Two days later, freshman Car
olyn McVeigh joined Nguyen at 20
wins with a 6-1,6-4 victory over Alex
I .iles of No. 18 Pepperdine.
Stanford won the match 5-2
against the Waves, in a grueling bat
tle that lasted over four hours.
Notably. Pepperdine won two of
the three doubles matches, remain
ing perfect on the year in winning
the doubles point.
However, the Cardinal couldn't
sustain its road prowess in the Ari
zona desert.
Earlier this season, Stanford and
Arizona State squared off on the
Farm. After sweeping the doubles
point, Stanford went on to easily de
feat the Sun Devils 6-1.
This time around, Stanford failed

to seize an early lead, eventually los
ing 4-3 against No. 13 Arizona State
for the first time in 24 years.
The Sun Devils returned the Car
dinal's favor with a doubles sweep
to set the tone early in the match.
With victories at the No. 2,3 and
4 singles. Arizona State handed the
Cardinal a shocking road upset.
On Saturday, Stanford finished
its three-game road trip with a 6-1
victory over Arizona.
At the No. 1 spot, freshman Hi
lary Barte defeated Danielle Stein
berg 6-3, 6-1 for her 11th straight
victory at the top of the lineup.
Barte is currently 19-5 on the sea
son. 10-1 against Pac-10 opponents
and 12-3 against nationally-ranked
opponents.
Right now. Barte brings seeming
ly the only consistency in a Cardinal
lineup full of injuries and still strug
gling to find an effective lineup.
Unfortunately for the Card,
there isn't much time to recuperate,
as USC and UCLA come to town
for a weekend series. The matchup
with the Trojans will be played at
Taube Tennis Center at 1:3o p.m. on
Friday while the UCLA game will
take place at noon on Saturday
