# Men's Golf
## Cardinal performs well in tough conditions 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's golf
team had their work cut out for
them over spring break when they
competed in the United States Col
legiate Championship hosted by
No. 7 Georgia Tech in Alpharetta,
Ga. The Cardinal finished in 11th
place after facing eight of the top
ten teams in the nation. No. 4 South
ern California managed to clinch
the top spot, followed by No. 6 Ok
lahoma State, No. 1 Alabama, No. 7
Georgia Tech. Rounding out the top
five was No. 8 Florida State.
This tournament has gained the
reputation of being the "Masters of
College Golf" because it gives
golfers PGA Tour-type, champi
onship conditions by only inviting
the best teams in the nation to par
ticipate. Each golfer receives a per
sonal caddy for all three rounds
which gives them a taste of life as a
professional golfer. The "Lakeside
Course" that is used is known to be
tough, demanding precision on its
fast greens. The Cardinal had never
before competed in the tournament,
which was only established in 2006.
Hie Cardinal struggled in the
tournament, which was played in 40-
degree weather that felt like 30 de
grees when the wind picked up. On
all three days of the tournament,
play was delayed approximately 30
minutes to let the course defrost.
"The weather was a bit ol a
shock," coach Conrad Ray said.
"The practice round was really nice
then we woke up in the morning to
frost delays and snow flurries.That's
the great thing about traveling, play
ing different tournaments and com
peting against top teams — you
need to learn to cope with the condi
tions. We didn't do that very well the
first day which cost us a better fin
ish, but it was a good experience
overall."
Though the weather conditions
proved to be less than favorable,
freshman Steve Ziegler managed to
lead the Cardinal in the individual

ranks when he tabbed his best over
all collegiate finish in a tie for 10th
place with UCLA's No. 11 Kevin
Chappell and Brigham Young's Es
teban Calisto. He fired a three-day
two-over-par score of 218. Ziegler
really stepped up his game in the
final round of the tournament, trim
ming his score to a four-under-par
score of 68 from his first and second
round scores of 76 and 74.
Following Ziegler was No. 10 Si
hwan Kim. the only other Stanford
golfer to conclude the tournament
in the top 25. Kim tied for 25th along
with Charlotte's N0.2 Jonas Enan
der Hedin and East Tennessee
State's No. 33 Gareth Shaw after
notching a five-over-par 221. Kim
had a rough start — scoring a six
over 78 in the first round — but im
proved tremendously in the end of
the tournament, scoring a two
under 70 and a one-over 73 in the
final rounds.
"We had a couple guys who had a
really good week." Ray said. "Kim
did well, but we had a great showing
by Ziegler. He's the guy I've been
waiting for all season to make his
mark and he is really starting to do
that in the past two tournaments."
Next was senior Rob Grube who
came in a tie for 33rd after shooting
a seven-over 233. I.ike his team
mates. Grube also improved in the
third round, scoring a one-under 71
versus his previous pair of four over
76's in the first two rounds.
"Rob hasn't played as well as
normal," Ray said. "That's 0.k.,
that's golf. I know that he will play
for us when it really matters in
June."
Junior Daniel Lim and junior
Dodge Kemmer both finished the
"Masters of College Golf" in a tie
for 75th with an overall 25-over
score of 241. Lim struggled in the
first and second rounds posting 84
and 83 but managed to improve by
scoring a two-over 74 on the final
day. Kemmer stayed consistent
throughout the tournament scoring
SO. 81 and 80 respectively.
From sixth place to the top, each
rank in the individual competition
was only separated by one stroke
which shows the high skill level of
each golfer participating in the
tournament. This increased the
pressure and intensity of the tour
nament. hut added an element of
excitement comparable to the
NCAA tournament.
The whole team had a rough
start to the NCAA preview, coming
in 13th consecutively after rounds
one and two. The team may have
struggled but they adapted to the
course well as they gained more and
more experience. The Cardinal
dropped nine strokes off of its orig
inal score of 310 in the second
round, unloading 15 more strokes in

the final round to bump themselves
up to the 11 th place spot.
"This was a great trip," Ray said.
"To play in such a difficult field on a
tough course is really important for
us to do. We didn't get the results we
wanted but we may rely on this ex
perience down the road."
The Cardinal has a two-week
break before its next tournament on
April 19 and April 20 when it hosts
the United States Intercollegiate
tournament right here at the Farm.
"We are really excited to golf at
home," Ray said. "The Stanford golf
course is shaping up to have won
derful conditions. Since we won last
year. I think the guys are set to de
fend their home turf. Over the next
few weeks the guys have some time
to settle in for spring quarter and we
only look to improve upon our
game as we make our run toward
June."
