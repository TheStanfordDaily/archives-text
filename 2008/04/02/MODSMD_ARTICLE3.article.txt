# Room to remain for transfers
## Stanford to accept transfer applicants despite halting of process at Harvard, Princeton 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
In light of Harvard College's recent
announcement that it will suspend trans
fer admission for the next two years,
Stanford will remain committed to con
tinuing transfer application cycles.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott
told The Daily yesterday.
Princeton University has been halting
transfer admission since 2005.
Princeton's then-Associate Dean of
Admission Keith Light attributed his
school's 2005 decision to "larger than
expected first-year enrollments, coupled
with a very low attrition rate."
Harvard's move, which was
announced in the middle of the current
admission cycle for transfer applicants,
came in response to a lack of undergrad
uate housing for admits, according to the
university's admission site.
Abbott told The Daily that although
Stanford faces a housing crunch, it will
continue its transfer admission process.
"Space is tight at Stanford too, and
our unprecedented yield of 70 [percent]
last year only exacerbates our situation."
Abbott said in an email. "Nevertheless,

we remain committed to enrolling new
transfers every year — especially a
cohort from community colleges."
Abbott said the Office of Admission
plans to enroll 40 transfer students for
the fall 2(K)8 quarter.
The decision to end transfer admis
sions at Harvard comes as the school
announced the results of its regular
application round, in which only 7.1 per
cent of applicants were admitted.
Harvard also announced Monday that
11 percent of its admitted applicants are
of African American background, over
18.5 percent are Asian American. 9.7
percent are Latino and 1.3 percent is
Native American. The Cambridge, Mass.
university also said just over half of
prospective freshmen are women.
Abbott, however, said a racial break
down of the admitted class at Stanford
— a record-low 9.5 percent of the 25.298
applicants — could not be provided to
the public.
"We never release any racial break
downs of the admitted freshman class."
he said. "It has been the University's
long-standing policy not to do this."
