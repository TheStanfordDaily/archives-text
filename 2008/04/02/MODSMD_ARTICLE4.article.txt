# STUDENT LIFE
## Truman scholar selected from Class of 2009 
### ANNA DEARYBURY 
Lauren Finzer '09, a junior majoring in
human biology, has been named a 2008
Truman Scholar.
The Truman Scholarship Foundation, cre
ated as a living memorial to the 33rd
President of the United States, seeks to iden
tify college juniors who have dedicated
themselves to public service and provide
them with financial support for graduate
study.
Each scholar receives up to $30,000 to
pursue a graduate degree leading to a career
in public service.
According to the foundation's Web site.

selected scholars must demonstrate excep
tional leadership both on their respective
college campuses as well as in individual pur
suits, and must be committed to being
"change agents" who will continue their pub
lic service in the future.
Normally, over 600 students apply for
approximately 60 annual awards, but these
600 applications do not include students who
compete for initial campus nominations.
"Each year Stanford students usually win
one or two of these very competitive
awards," said Stern Academic Director
Renee Courey.
Courey called this year's candidate pool
"exceptionally strong," but said Finzer was

selected because of her "effective leadership,
the quality of the policy proposal she wrote
on incentives in energy usage, stellar aca
demic achievement, strong research trajecto
ry and galvanizing presence."
Finzer, who said her primary interest is
the intersection of environment, health and
social issues, first became involved in envi
ronmental work in high school, when she
volunteered for six weeks in rural Mexico
and eight weeks in rural Nicaragua.
"Community members in the villages in
which 1 was living eagerly got involved in
school reforestation and trash disposal proj
ects," Finzer said. "1 was impressed with how
the environment, as a common resource, can

bring people together to ensure that future
generations can thrive."
Finzer said that by first addressing envi
ronmental concerns, many other problems
can be addressed. On campus, she works to
make Stanford more sustainable as co
president of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford.
"There are a lot of problems that can be
seen as opportunities," Finzer said, "and 1
really want to make positive change."
Two Stanford students were awarded the
Truman Scholarship last year.
