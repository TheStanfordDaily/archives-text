The Card resumed play against the University of
Hawaii on March 24. The Rainbow Warriors came into
the game ranked No. 5 in the nation and with an unde
feated record in the MPSF. They were also playing in
their home pool in Honolulu, which gave them even
more confidence against the Cardinal. It was Stanford
who won the first period though, taking it by the score
of 2-1. The margin would get no greater than one goal
for either team for the rest of the game.
Hawaii responded in the second quarter with three
goals to Stanford's one, giving them a 4-3 halftime lead.
Each team netted three times in the third period as
Hawaii's lead stayed at one. After the teams once again
traded goals to bring the score to 8-7, Kelly Eaton equal

the team shut Hawaii out to pick up a thrilling 10-9 over
time win.

The team returned home five days later to
face its first — and only — east coast opponent
of the regular season. Brown University. It was
the team's first home game in almost a month,

team had already built up a 7-1 lead, and it ex

of the game was more of the same, and the final
score ended up at 16-5 in favor of the Cardinal.
Stanford used great offensive balance to
take down the Bears, as its 16 goals were scored
by 11 different players. Freshman Allie Gerrity
highlighted the attack by notching her first ca
reer hat trick. Kim I tall spent most of the match
in the cage, turning away five shots.

period to put some distance between the sides,

three goals apiece, and Amber Gland did most
of the work in goal, stopping nine shots.
The Card stayed hot as it traveled to Mon

Stanford took control from the start, scoring the
game's first nine goals. In fact, Gauthier had al
ready recorded a hat trick by the time the Otters
got on the board, at the 5:35 mark of the second
quarter. The Cardinal was relentless though,
and ended the half on top by the score of 13-3.
Both teams would add six goals in the second
half for a final score of 19-9, giving the Card its
second double-digit victory of the weekend.
Stanford posted four hat tricks on the day —
from Gauthier, Silver. Alex Koran and Chelsea
Smith-Carmichael — and Kim Hall again
played in goal, stopping six shots.
Before last weekend, the Cardinal had
reached 15 goals in four games this season, none
of them back-to-back. The win over Monterey

face its first — and only — east coast opponent
of the regular season. Brown University. It was
the team's first home game in almost a month,
and the Card marked its return with a dominant
performance. By the end of the first period the
team had already built up a 7-1 lead, and it ex
tended it to 10-2 before halftime.The remainder
of the game was more of the same, and the final
score ended up at 16-5 in favor of the Cardinal.
Stanford used great offensive balance to
take down the Bears, as its 16 goals were scored
by 11 different players. Freshman Allie Gerrity
highlighted the attack by notching her first ca
reer hat trick. Kim I tall spent most of the match
in the cage, turning away five shots.
The Cardinal returned to the pool that
evening for its second match of the day, this one
against No. 13 Long Beach State. The game
stayed close through the first period, as Stan
ford ended the quarter with a slender 3-2 lead.
I lowever. the Card was able to use a 5-1 second
period to put some distance between the sides,
and scored five goals again in the third quarter
to put the score at 13-6 and effectively bury the
49ers.The game would end 15-7. Jackie Gauthi
er and Lauren Silver paced the Cardinal with
three goals apiece, and Amber Gland did most
of the work in goal, stopping nine shots.
The Card stayed hot as it traveled to Mon
terey to face CSU-Monterey Bay the next day.
Stanford took control from the start, scoring the
game's first nine goals. In fact, Gauthier had al
ready recorded a hat trick by the time the Otters
got on the board, at the 5:35 mark of the second
quarter. The Cardinal was relentless though,
and ended the half on top by the score of 13-3.
Both teams would add six goals in the second
half for a final score of 19-9, giving the Card its
second double-digit victory of the weekend.
Stanford posted four hat tricks on the day —
from Gauthier, Silver. Alex Koran and Chelsea
Smith-Carmichael — and Kim Hall again
played in goal, stopping six shots.
Before last weekend, the Cardinal had
reached 15 goals in four games this season, none
of them back-to-back. The win over Monterey
gave the team its third straight 15-goal game
and set a new season-high with 19 goals.
ITie Card will hope to continue its astound
ing offensive success against two top-20 teams
this coming weekend: No. 15 Cal State-North
ridge and No. 3 USC. one ot only two teams to
defeat the Cardinal this year.
