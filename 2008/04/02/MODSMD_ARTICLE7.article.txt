Yet these two labs are conducting work that has potential

contain "instructions" that cells can read. By formulating
the material with the correct instructions for stem cells,
Heilshorn and her lab are developing a new set of tools for
the treatment of some of medicine's most formidable chal
lenges, among them the regeneration of the heart, brain
and spinal cord.
Heilshorn is a recent arrival at Stanford, brought to fill
a new faculty position for biomaterials research. Her of
fice is small, with a neat wooden table right in the center
and matching wooden chairs. It's sparse and clean; a long
translucent poster of tall grass

covers the window to the hall
way. Heilshorn is young; her
bangs layered across her fore
head make her look more so.
She wears a gauzy yellow
shirt, and earrings show
through her cropped hair.
"I'm pretty new on campus,
still learning my way around,"
she says, her face open, smil
ing. Her eyes are large and
bright. She chooses her words
carefully, collecting her
thoughts. Her precise elocu
tion is offset only by a slight
lisp on her s's.
The way she tells it, she
made it to this small sunlit of
fice by making the most of
chance encounters. She had
no childhood dreams of med
icine. lab work or professorial
prestige. Just following her in
terests, her work encompasses
them all. "My degrees are ac
tually all in chemical engi
neering." she says. "But 1 also
got a biology degree when I
was in graduate school; I
worked for a chemistry pro
fessor. then 1 did a postdoc in
neurobiology and now I'm in
a materials science depart
ment." She laughs,"l'm some
what scientifically schizo
phrenic."
The field she ended up in.
biomaterials. engages all this
training. Her work uses recent
technology, but the demand
for materials in the human
body is far from new. For cen
turies, wooden limbs replaced
lost ones, gold replaced teeth
— materials that weren't per
fect. but did the job. "They
were never originally de
signed for a biological pur
pose. but really creative peo
ple saw, 'We have a real
need.'" Heilshorn explains.
"So they looked around to see
what was available."
Even today, the materials
used in the body are mainly
industrial, and function pure
ly mechanically. For instance,
if a blood vessel bursts, the
material used to replace it
must be sturdy and cannot
leak or break. The materials
of raincoats. Dacron and Gor
tex, have traditionally done
the job. But the body's blood
vessels also act as gatekeepers

tor immune system cells, which have to move into the tis
sue to find infections.That's a function that synthetic ma
terials like Dacron and Gor-tex can't perform. Heil
shorn's research has the potential to change this. She de
velops new materials that can not only function mechani
cally, but can also interact with cells. These materials can
actually integrate with the body, reducing the potential
for infection or rejection, and controlling the nuances of
functionality — like allowing immune cells to move
through blood vessel walls.
Heilshorn grew up in Defiance, Ohio, where neither of
her parents had college degrees. "Coming out of high
school, I didn't necessarily have that mindset that I was
going to find a career I was really going to fall in love
with." When she started as a student at Georgia Tech, she
chose chemical engineering because she wanted a diffi
cult major, and she knew she could easily find a job. Out
side of course work, she worked in a faculty lab and in
terned at Procter and Gamble, where she engineered
shampoo and conditioner:"! was in a career where I spent

an awful lot of energy trying to make people's hair look
better." As she approached graduation, she started to re
alize."Maybe I don't really want any of these jobs. Maybe
I'm finding out I have more of a passion for what I'm
learning."
Encouraged by her professors. Heilshorn found her
way to graduate school at CalTech,still unsure of what she
wanted to do. It wasn't until she stumbled into a research
seminar, taught by Chemical Engineering Professor
David Tirrell, that something stuck. Tirrell researches
how to design new materials and molecules that have the
potential to impact people's lives. Heilshorn knew that
was what she wanted to do. but she was hesitant to ap
proach Tirrell, since she had little relevant background.
"He was very gracious and assured me that enthusiasm
was the main requirement for the job." she recalls. Work
ing in his lab. she began to sense that this was a field in
which she could find both that intellectual stimulus and
the fulfillment of doing something that had the potential
to help people.
Although at that time she had no background in biol
ogy, her interests led her in the direction of biomaterials
and how they could be integrated into the body. "Before

she joined my laboratory, we had foeused largely on ma
terials questions, and we had done very little work with
cells,"Tirrell recalled in an email to The Daily. "Sarah's re
search taught us a lot about how to design materials that
allow cells to attach rapidly and robustly, as they must
when materials are used in surgery." She became the local
expert on cells and developed methods that were subse
quently used by future students in the lab. Her interest in
biology led her to UC-Berkeley as a postdoctoral scholar
in neurobiology: "I wanted to learn more about the cen
tral nervous system and how neurons can develop and
navigate and create this fantastic network in our bodies."
After finishing at Berkeley, she headed across the bay
to Stanford as an assistant professor. Now, she teaches
one undergrad course. ESOM:" Intro to Materials Science:
Biomaterials Emphasis," and two grad course in Materi
als Science, Organic Materials and Biomaterials in Re
generative Medicine. She also runs a laboratory of 10 stu
dents, both undergrads and grads. Cheryl Wong Po Foo,
who is doing her postdoctoral work in the Heilshorn lab.

says, "With Sarah, since she's newer, she's a lot more
hands-on. She keeps track of everything."
In the lab, students work on specific research ques
tions, then meet with Heilshorn to consider questions
such as "How are the cells interacting with this material?
What does that mean in terms of designing the next mate
rial? Mow can we change it a little hit?" These little
changes are key for their main project:To understand how
stem cells react to materials. Stem cells can change into
any type of cell, he it bone or muscle or neurons. Tradi
tionally, biologists adjusted the solution on the cell to ef
fect its differentiation. But Heilshorn says that Dennis
Discher's research laboratory at UPenn recently discov
ered something new: "If you change the mechanics of the
material —so you have them growing on something
that's really stiff or something that's really weak — the
cell can actually feel that difference, and it causes the stem
cell to differentiate into different types of cells." Heil
shorn's lab team tries to design scaffolds that resemble
natural tissue. "We're trying to pick out the key variables
that a materials scientist can tune when they're making
some scaffold to get the cellular response that they want."
What they want are cells that can be used to help re
generate a heart after a heart attack, or potentially help a
spine regenerate after an injury. The lab is currently test
ing two new materials that have exciting implications
both for the heart and the central nervous system. Heil
shorn is also part of a multidisciplinary team studying
heart tissue engineering, which recently won a $2 million
grant from the National Science Foundation. Heilshorn

understands the importance of the collaborative aspect of
this work: "It will take a full community of researchers to
really begin to put together the right set of engineering
tools to be able to, for example, heal a spinal cord injury."
Young as she is, Heilshorn has already started to gar
ner international attention, evidenced by her presence at
Stanford — she won a worldwide general faculty search
of over 1(X) applicants. Materials Science Professor Rein
hold 11. Dauskardt, who chaired the search committee
that chose her, considers Heilshorn's presence important
for the future of the field. "All fields of engineering are
dramatically changing," he explains. Given the rapid de
velopment of technology, the work being done in engi
neering research today looks nothing like the research
from even 20 years ago. "One of the new frontiers for en
gineering in any department in this century will be bio
engineering." Heilshorn, he says, "represents a very im
portant part of that process."

tor immune system cells, which have to move into the tis
sue to find infections.That's a function that synthetic ma
terials like Dacron and Gor-tex can't perform. Heil
shorn's research has the potential to change this. She de
velops new materials that can not only function mechani
cally, but can also interact with cells. These materials can
actually integrate with the body, reducing the potential
for infection or rejection, and controlling the nuances of
functionality — like allowing immune cells to move
through blood vessel walls.
Heilshorn grew up in Defiance, Ohio, where neither of
her parents had college degrees. "Coming out of high
school, I didn't necessarily have that mindset that I was
going to find a career I was really going to fall in love
with." When she started as a student at Georgia Tech, she
chose chemical engineering because she wanted a diffi
cult major, and she knew she could easily find a job. Out
side of course work, she worked in a faculty lab and in
terned at Procter and Gamble, where she engineered
shampoo and conditioner:"! was in a career where I spent

an awful lot of energy trying to make people's hair look
better." As she approached graduation, she started to re
alize."Maybe I don't really want any of these jobs. Maybe
I'm finding out I have more of a passion for what I'm
learning."
Encouraged by her professors. Heilshorn found her
way to graduate school at CalTech,still unsure of what she
wanted to do. It wasn't until she stumbled into a research
seminar, taught by Chemical Engineering Professor
David Tirrell, that something stuck. Tirrell researches
how to design new materials and molecules that have the
potential to impact people's lives. Heilshorn knew that
was what she wanted to do. but she was hesitant to ap
proach Tirrell, since she had little relevant background.
"He was very gracious and assured me that enthusiasm
was the main requirement for the job." she recalls. Work
ing in his lab. she began to sense that this was a field in
which she could find both that intellectual stimulus and
the fulfillment of doing something that had the potential
to help people.
Although at that time she had no background in biol
ogy, her interests led her in the direction of biomaterials
and how they could be integrated into the body. "Before

she joined my laboratory, we had foeused largely on ma
terials questions, and we had done very little work with
cells,"Tirrell recalled in an email to The Daily. "Sarah's re
search taught us a lot about how to design materials that
allow cells to attach rapidly and robustly, as they must
when materials are used in surgery." She became the local
expert on cells and developed methods that were subse
quently used by future students in the lab. Her interest in
biology led her to UC-Berkeley as a postdoctoral scholar
in neurobiology: "I wanted to learn more about the cen
tral nervous system and how neurons can develop and
navigate and create this fantastic network in our bodies."
After finishing at Berkeley, she headed across the bay
to Stanford as an assistant professor. Now, she teaches
one undergrad course. ESOM:" Intro to Materials Science:
Biomaterials Emphasis," and two grad course in Materi
als Science, Organic Materials and Biomaterials in Re
generative Medicine. She also runs a laboratory of 10 stu
dents, both undergrads and grads. Cheryl Wong Po Foo,
who is doing her postdoctoral work in the Heilshorn lab.

says, "With Sarah, since she's newer, she's a lot more
hands-on. She keeps track of everything."
In the lab, students work on specific research ques
tions, then meet with Heilshorn to consider questions
such as "How are the cells interacting with this material?
What does that mean in terms of designing the next mate
rial? Mow can we change it a little hit?" These little
changes are key for their main project:To understand how
stem cells react to materials. Stem cells can change into
any type of cell, he it bone or muscle or neurons. Tradi
tionally, biologists adjusted the solution on the cell to ef
fect its differentiation. But Heilshorn says that Dennis
Discher's research laboratory at UPenn recently discov
ered something new: "If you change the mechanics of the
material —so you have them growing on something
that's really stiff or something that's really weak — the
cell can actually feel that difference, and it causes the stem
cell to differentiate into different types of cells." Heil
shorn's lab team tries to design scaffolds that resemble
natural tissue. "We're trying to pick out the key variables
that a materials scientist can tune when they're making
some scaffold to get the cellular response that they want."
What they want are cells that can be used to help re
generate a heart after a heart attack, or potentially help a
spine regenerate after an injury. The lab is currently test
ing two new materials that have exciting implications
both for the heart and the central nervous system. Heil
shorn is also part of a multidisciplinary team studying
heart tissue engineering, which recently won a $2 million
grant from the National Science Foundation. Heilshorn

understands the importance of the collaborative aspect of
this work: "It will take a full community of researchers to
really begin to put together the right set of engineering
tools to be able to, for example, heal a spinal cord injury."
Young as she is, Heilshorn has already started to gar
ner international attention, evidenced by her presence at
Stanford — she won a worldwide general faculty search
of over 1(X) applicants. Materials Science Professor Rein
hold 11. Dauskardt, who chaired the search committee
that chose her, considers Heilshorn's presence important
for the future of the field. "All fields of engineering are
dramatically changing," he explains. Given the rapid de
velopment of technology, the work being done in engi
neering research today looks nothing like the research
from even 20 years ago. "One of the new frontiers for en
gineering in any department in this century will be bio
engineering." Heilshorn, he says, "represents a very im
portant part of that process."

Heilshorn and her lab are developing a new set of tools for
the treatment of some of medicine's most formidable chal
lenges, among them the regeneration of the heart, brain
and spinal cord.
Heilshorn is a recent arrival at Stanford, brought to fill
a new faculty position for biomaterials research. Her of
fice is small, with a neat wooden table right in the center
and matching wooden chairs. It's sparse and clean; a long
translucent poster of tall grass

covers the window to the hall
way. Heilshorn is young; her
bangs layered across her fore
head make her look more so.
She wears a gauzy yellow
shirt, and earrings show
through her cropped hair.
"I'm pretty new on campus,
still learning my way around,"
she says, her face open, smil
ing. Her eyes are large and
bright. She chooses her words
carefully, collecting her
thoughts. Her precise elocu
tion is offset only by a slight
lisp on her s's.
The way she tells it, she
made it to this small sunlit of
fice by making the most of
chance encounters. She had
no childhood dreams of med
icine. lab work or professorial
prestige. Just following her in
terests, her work encompasses
them all. "My degrees are ac
tually all in chemical engi
neering." she says. "But 1 also
got a biology degree when I
was in graduate school; I
worked for a chemistry pro

biomaterials. engages all this
training. Her work uses recent
technology, but the demand
for materials in the human
body is far from new. For cen
turies, wooden limbs replaced
lost ones, gold replaced teeth
— materials that weren't per
fect. but did the job. "They
were never originally de
signed for a biological pur
pose. but really creative peo
ple saw, 'We have a real
need.'" Heilshorn explains.
"So they looked around to see
what was available."
Even today, the materials
used in the body are mainly
industrial, and function pure
ly mechanically. For instance,
if a blood vessel bursts, the
material used to replace it
must be sturdy and cannot
leak or break. The materials
of raincoats. Dacron and Gor
tex, have traditionally done
the job. But the body's blood
vessels also act as gatekeepers
