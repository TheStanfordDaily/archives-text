"Imagining the Lives of Others"
Liisa Malkki, Anthropology
Richard Roberts, History
Carol Shloss, English
In his research, Richard Roberts, an African Historian, examines the
life of Faama Mademba Sy, a post-and-telegraph clerk who became an
African king. In her work among the Hutu refugees in Western
Tanzania, Liisa Malkki, a cultural anthropologist, interviews individuals
displaced by national cataclysm. In her writing of biography, Carol
Shloss delves into the life experience of Mary de Rachewiltz, a
woman whose father was accused of treason.To write, all three
must imaginatively inhabit the lives of their subjects. Each scholar
"listens" for different cultural resonances, but all of them are joined
by the project of understanding and representing life stories.These
three writers will talk about how they construe their experiences
of "coming upon" the subjectivities of the people they study.
