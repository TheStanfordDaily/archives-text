## THEY CAME, THEY SAW, THEY CAPTURED ROBLE 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Throughout history, wars have been ended for many reasons, hut
among the most frequent and compelling reasons have been final
exams. In keeping with this rich tradition, Stanford Hirf — an online.
Risk style game where students vie for control of the campus —
concluded at the end of winter quarter. A short post on the main site,
www.stanfordturf.com. declared that "the first battle for Stanford began on
February 24,2(X)K and formally concluded on March 16,2008."The victors in
the conflict were a four-team alliance who agreed to a joint victory: Branner /
Toyon.Sterling/GovCo, Wilbur, and Mirrielees.
The game developers sealed the victory after a period of controversy. The
dominance of team Roble/Lag led to the formation of a strong, five-team
counter-alliance (the victors plus Manzanita), which ultimately led Roble/Lag
to exit the conflict by banning its players. Late in the game there were also re
ports of mutinies within many teams, including Wilbur,FroSoCo, and even very
late within Branner/Toyon.
Alliance members felt that Roble/Lag's exit only sped up the eventual re
sults.
"Their defeat was probably inevitable" said Jeff Chern 10, retired Bran
ner/Toyon commander. "I think they just accelerated it."
"Well, it's not fun to lose.or to lose to five teams, or to the whole campus..."
added Dean Lowell Young 11. retired Roble/Lag commander. "Our team just
disappeared off the map, to

"We were really pleased with how it went," said O'Brien. "And we have a

of interest in us heading back next year."
While the conflict emphasized rivalries around campus, participants and
the developers still kept their eyes on the larger picture.
"I think the end result is that someone from Harvard just sucked up thou
