### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Ihree Stanford undergrads have
been awarded Barry M. Goldwater
Scholarships for the 2008-09 aca
demic year.
Honoring undergraduate sopho
mores and juniors intending to pur
sue careers in mathematics, engi
neering and the natural sciences, this
award grants recipients up to $7,500
annually for the remainder of their
undergraduate careers to cover their
tuition and other student expenses.
Max Kleiman-Weiner '09, Justin
Solomon "10 and Douglas Stanford
'09 are among the 321 undergradu
ates nationwide to receive this
merit-based scholarship, which was
established by Congress in 1986 in
honor of U.S. Senator Barry
Goldwater. This year's recipients
were selected from a field of 1,035
mathematics, science and engineer
ing students who were nominated by
the faculties of colleges and univer
sities nationwide.
This year's winners follow in the
footsteps of Stanford's four winners
last year.
Solomon is double-majoring in
Computer Science and
Mathematics. He attributed much of
his interest in computer graphics.

"For me, science
is the best way
to understand
the world and
ourselves."
Max Kleiman-Weiner,
Goldwater recipient

computational geometry and
numerical analysis to the research
he has pursued both at Stanford and
during high school. Though current
ly working with Computer Science
Prof. Ron Fedkiw's research group,
he plans to intern with Pixar's
research group this summer. He
hopes to work toward a Ph.D. in
Computer Science.
Kleiman-Weiner, who is major
ing in Biological Science, has been
involved in research in Prof. John

Huguenard's laboratory on the cel
lular mechanisms of thalinocortical
oscillations since his freshman year.
He attributed his intention to pur
sue science to his experience in the
lab.
"For me, science is the best way
to understand the world and our
selves," he said. "1 love everyday in
the lab and so hope to pursue a
career in scientific research. What
could be better than getting paid to
have fun?"
Kleiman-Weiner plans to continue
probing the function of neural cir
cuits in graduate school.
Stanford, who is a Physics major,
also developed a passion for scien
tific research in his first year at the
University.
"More than anything, my work
with the lab during my freshman
year got me excited about Physics
and research." he said. "1 am incred
ibly grateful to Stanford for provid
ing me with amazing research
opportunities and top notch faculty
who have helped me to develop my
interests and aspirations."
Stanford plans to pursue research
in theoretical physics and mathe
maticallv related fields.
