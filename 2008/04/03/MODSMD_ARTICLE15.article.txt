## Editorial Board More power to PWR 
### 
The Daily would like to take the opportu
nity at the beginning of Spring quarter to
commend Stanford's often-maligned
first year "Program in Writing and Rhetoric"
requirement. PWR 1 provides freshmen with a
broad range of edifying courses, teaching them
how to think and write critically and how to
best utilize the University's vast research re
sources. It is an essential part of any Stanford
student's education.
While few would care to admit it. we could
all improve our writing. As talented as Stan
ford students are, PWR offers a way for al
ready-proficient writers to improve, and it as
sists those needing a leg up.To do this, the pro
gram grants students a wide array of courses to
choose from — roughly 30 different classes
this quarter, for example — in an admirable
attempt to ensure that there is something for
everyone.
There will always be those who dislike their
PWR class, either because of the professor or
subject matter. It speaks to the program's de
sire to make PWR enjoyable for as many stu
dents as possible, however, that one can choose
from offerings as eclectic as "Pretty in Pink:
The Rhetoric of the '80s" and "Writing the Bi
cycle: Rhetoric and Research on Two Wheels."
There's even "Machine Dreams:The Rhetoric
ofTechnology/Rhetoric as Technology" for the
techies and "Everybody's Favorite Color?:The
Rhetoric of Green," for the environmentally
conscious. Whatever its perceived failings.
PWR does not suffer from a lack of diverse, in
teresting topics.
While instructor quality can vary, as with
any class. PWR classes can be remarkably ef
fective at educating students in critical analysis
and more sophisticated writing methods. By
carefully analyzing others' writing, students
absorb what is and is not effective in their own
writing. Additionally, students are required to
meet with professors, and they must write and
peer-edit multiple drafts of their papers. As a
result of this collaboration with teacher and
peers, students learn to think and rethink their
arguments.The finished product is often much
more polished than the typical paper cranked
out the night/morning before it is due.

PWR helps compensate for the inability of
many other courses to provide these valuable
learning experiences. In classes where enhanc
ing writing skills is not the primary goal, stu
dents have little time to write multiple drafts,
peer-edit or meet with professors to discuss
paper ideas. With PWR. students can at least
learn the value of doing so, and gain skills that
hopefully translate to other classes that are
similarly writing-intensive but also faster
paced.
The program is also effective — especial
ly for freshman taking it in their first fall term
— at familiarizing students with the myriad
research resources that all Stanford students
have at their fingertips. Navigating the west
stacks at Green can be dizzying, and
Socrates, Stanford's online catalogue, can be
confusing to a first-year college student.
PWR classes spend several weeks in Green
Library acclimating students to these re
sources through workshops, scavenger hunts
and the online "Stanford's Key to Informa
tion Literacy" (SKIL) tutorials. There are
those that might scoff at some of the content,
but many of the lessons are nonetheless in
valuable. Learning to use the Dewey decimal
system, to accurately search for journal arti
cles or even to understand the basic layout of
the stacks will likely greatly improve stu
dents' ease of research throughout their
Stanford careers.
Yes, PWR is a required class, and therefore
is almost automatically despised and criticized
by many. But the same students who claim the
course made them worse writers or didn't
teach them anything likely benefited from the
program, knowingly or not.
Stanford recently initiated a study, the
"Frosh Write Project." to evaluate how under
graduate writing develops over time. Fresh
men were asked to respond to a prompt before
taking PWR, and then to submit their final re
search-based argument paper at the end of the
course. Analyzing this data will provide a
quantitative assessment of student writing and
the PWR 1 program. From a subjective stand
point, however, we can already tell that PWR
seems to work.
