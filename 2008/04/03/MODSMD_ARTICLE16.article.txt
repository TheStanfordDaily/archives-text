# The 						Wanderer
## Love and destruction 
### 
Santiago, Chile — On Mar. 23, a Finnish
tourist decided to visit one of Easter Is
land's famous mystical statues (called
Moais) and break off a souvenir. The tourist,
Marko Kulju, climbed up one of the massive
and ancient Moais, chopped a piece of an ear
off — allegedly with a chisel — and ran. He
was later caught because the island is a small
place, and a local woman who saw the crime
recognized his numerous tattoos.
By the time I arrived three days later, the is
land was abuzz with rumors about Kulju. Was
he drunk? Was it planned? Did he actually
have a chisel? To put it mildly, Finland's repu
tation took a beating at the hands of locals,
who already have a love/hate relationship with
tourists. The mayor even suggested Kulju
should lose his ear in retribution. Under
Chilean law. Kulju faces up to seven years in
prison, but it seems likely he will get off with
only a heavy fine.
I am sick of idiots like Kulju screwing things
up for all the tourists who actually plan to
sightsee without doing any pillaging. In the
past, tourists have carved initials into other
Moais and petroglvphs in Easter Island. At al
most any tourist destination around the world,
vandalism is omnipresent. In Egypt, tourists
are no longer able to walk freely through the
Giza pyramids because of all the stealing and
carving. In Italy. Florence's famous Duomo di
Santa Maria del Fiore is plastered with recent
ly etched initials.
What's more, the vandalism is not limited
to blockbuster tourist spots. In my first week in
Chile. I hiked to a glacial lake several miles
from the nearest small town. Despite the isola
tion and the natural setting, someone had de
cided to strive for immortality by spray paint
ing lovey-dovey initials onto a large rock close
to the lake. In Santiago, I climbed to the top of
an old fort in a park that overlooks the city and
again, initials were everywhere.
It's one thing to try and take a piece of your
trip home with you.Though still unforgivable,
it makes sense at a basic level: people like to
own things. But I just don't understand the
popularity of carving or painting or otherwise
inscribing initials. Okay, maybe at your desk in
high school or your cubicle in Green Library,
you got really bored. And maybe you read The
Giving Thee and wanted to carve something
somewhere to profess undying devotion. But
really, an irreplaceable piece of history? A na
tional park? A pyramid?

When the gesture is one of love, the initials
are in a neat pair like SD + EF, sometimes in
side a heart. How romantic. "This is how much
I love you," the guy carving says to his girl
friend. "Look, I'll destroy something just to
show the depth of my caring. I 'II make sure that
everyone who sees this famous object/place
from now on knows about SD + EF. They
won't know who we are, and they might be a
little upset, but I love you so much I'll do it any
way. and that way our love will be immortal."
Given the macho underpinnings to this
logic, I assume males are doing most of the
carving, but it wouldn't keep happening if it
wasn't working. "Aww, how sweet," the re
sponse must go from the girlfriend."You'd cut
into a priceless artifact for me?" Sweet indeed.
When there is only one set of initials carved
into something, the psychological declaration
is a bit sadder. "I'm important!" it screams. "I
may not have done anything else, but this one
time I toured [fill in a destination] and carved
my name there. Here's the proof. Look I even
carved the year next to my name. Now if they
ever write a Wikipedia article about me, it will
have something to say!"
There are better ways to find souvenirs, ex
press love and escape anonymity. And of
course, vandalism is not only the sphere of
tourists and historical locations. But still, every
time a tourist does something stupid it has a
doubly negative impact for those of us who are
to follow. If the damage was serious, we arc
forced to view the tarnished version of whatev
er we traveled to see. and we face the suspicion
created by the last idiot who carved his initials.
As much as it sucks to have areas cordoned
off, to have park rangers or museum employ
ees watch with an extra careful eye, to be im
mediately stereotyped as all the bad things
previous tourists have been, I'm starting to
identify with the concern. Better that than ini
tials everywhere.
