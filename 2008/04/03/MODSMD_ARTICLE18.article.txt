The race for the Democratic presidential
nomination continues unabated. The
crucial Pennsylvania primary is on
April 22, meaning that the race will continue
for three more weeks, at the very least.
Hillary Clinton leads in that state by 12
points according to most polls, and assuming
the lead holds, she will stay in the race until
May 6. While her campaign has not been on
solid footing since the massive Feb. 5 primar
ies, she's been able to weather a long series of
defeats to win Ohio and Texas, and give her
campaign enough breathing room to contin
ue.
A growing number of voices inside the
party have begun to express public concern
about the race's impact on the success of the
party in the fall elections. Both campaigns
have gone more negative since Feb. 5, and as
a result, the relations between the candidates
ave become more acrimonious. Perhaps
more importantly, their staffs and orbiting
advisors have begun to enter the fray. Saman
tha Power, a prominent journalist and advi
sor to the Obama campaign, called Clinton a
"monster" and immediately resigned. Geral
dine Ferraro.the 19K4 Democratic vice-pres
idential nominee, made a series of remarks
that were construed as racist, and she re
signed as an advisor to the Clinton campaign.
Whoever wins the nomination — and
Obama is still the favorite — it won't be pret
ty. If Obama wins, he'll have won without the
broad support of Latinos, working-class
whites and older women, all key components
of the Democratic base. If Clinton wins, she'll
have won despite alienating African-Ameri

cans, the most reliable Democratic con
stituency, and wealthy donors that are crucial
for the party's success. Obama has done bet
ter in small states and swing states; Clinton
has won all of the big states besides Illinois.
Whoever wins the nomination will alienate a
lot of people. A recent poll shows that 16 per
cent of Clinton supporters will not vote in the
general election if Obama is the nominee.
The same percentage of Obama supporters
will not vote in an election in which Clinton is
the Democratic candidate.
The race has come to a point where nei
ther winner will emerge unscathed or as the
consensus candidate. Despite having a siz
able lead in delegates,and frontrunner status,
Obama's been unable to finish off Clinton
and allowed her several comebacks. It's a tes
tament to the unresolved weaknesses of the
Obama campaign that Clinton is still inning
big states despite running out of ways to win.
It's clear that whoever wins, John McCain
is better positioned to win the presidency.
While Democrats spend enormous sums of
money just to defeat each other in the pri
mary, John McCain can present himself as
the rational alternative. He has several
months to reach out to conservatives, form a

campaign staff and fundraise before the De
mocrats even have an alternative. His presi
dential bid is essentially unopposed right
now and will be that way for the foreseeable
future.
The only way for the advantage to be re
stored to the Democrats is to have the names
"Clinton" and "Obama" both on the ticket.
The two candidates should agree, now, that
they will run together, no matter who wins in
the end. It is true that both presidential can
didates are not particularly suited for the vice
presidency, each being very self-confident
and with very clear agendas. This agreement
should also include significant duties for the
vice presidential role, either informally, as
Dick Cheney has held, or concrete oversight
over certain policy areas, as John Kerry re
portedly offered to McCain in 2004.1 also be
lieve this agreement will have the effect of
lessening the tension of the campaign. It will
be difficult for either candidate to accept the
vice-presidency, but it is slightly better than
nothing, and that's something.
It is clear that the candidates, and their
staffs, have a great deal of animosity toward
each other. Both candidates have been ac
cused of putting themselves before their
party, and this is their chance to put the De
mocratic Party above their own presidential
ambitions. The candidates will also have to
resolve their divergent styles and agenda, no
matter who wins the nomination.That will be
difficult, but for victory, it will be necessary.
