## Losing the Lopezes 
### 
To the editors:
When I first learned that Brook
Lopez was likely to turn pro after
this season, my first reaction was,
"Please not one of those news confer
ences." Or, to acknowledge a bit of elite
school smugness, my reaction was, "Please,
not at Stanford of all places." Well, now
Brook and Robin Lopez are both leaving.

and as for the feared press conference, so
far, so (somewhat) good. Allow a quick ex
planation: I refer to the bizarre hut com
mon phenomenon of a college basketball
coach (usually a man) appearing at the pub
lic announcement when one of his star play
ers jumps to the pros, with the coach some
times sounding as much like a sports agent
as a university teacher. The coach usually
has a weird facial expression because he's

usually so ambivalent. He's showing off
how good a coach, or recruiter, he himself
is. He's hoping that the player's jump will
help recruit future potential college stars,
and future college-leavers, and he also
often has a slightly sick look, realizing he
just lost his best chance of going deep into
the Dance next year. Seeing these
events. I often wish college presi
dents would put a covenant in each
coach's contract saying that if a
player says he's contemplating the
jump, the coach must merely tell
the player, and say to the press, that
it is always better to stay in school,
and that any advice about whether
to leave will have to come from out
side advisors. Of course, this may be
forcing insincerity or even
hypocrisy onto the coach, but. first,
we're already dealing with perva
sive hypocrisy in the world of col
lege sports, and second. I'd rather
see this kind of hypocrisy if it is a
least one. small rhetorical gesture
at bringing college sports back to
its professed ideals.
Now that both the Lopez broth
ers have decided to go to the NBA.
I'm pleased that no student-faculty
press conference has yet happened,
and I urge both A.D. Bowlsby and
Coach Johnson not to participate in

one. Mr. Bowlsby has at least said
that he wishes they'd stay. Coach
Johnson was quoted as saying he
was "supportive"of the move, and
in regard to that statement the best
I can say is that "supportive" is one
of the most unclarifyingly vague
words. We are told that both players
intend to finish their degrees at
some point, though I wonder if
they've been advised about the his
torical record of fulfillment of those
expectations. Would it hurt for our
Stanford sports leaders simply to
say that although they wish the
Lopez brothers well, as educators
they always advise college students
to stay in school? After all. the star
athlete can be viewed as simply the
most visible example of a college
student interrupting, and very pos
sibly ending, his or her education to
make money in the short term.
When non-athlete students do that,
we don't have press conferences or
even faculty or administration pub
lic statements of approval.

Professor Robert Weisberg is (lie
Edwin E. Huddleson, Jr. Professor of
Law at Stanford and is the Director of
The Stanford Criminal Justice Center.
