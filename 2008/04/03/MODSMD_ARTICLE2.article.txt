## SAT subject tests still required Director of Admission says University has no plans to cut tests from admission criteria 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
While a faculty panel from the University of California
recently proposed omitting the SAT Subject Tests — formerly
known as the SAT lis — as a criterion for admission, Stanford
has no plans to ditch the tests.
Subject tests have been required by the University of
California for 40 years, but UC systemwide Academic Senate
Chairman Michael Brown expects the SAT II requirement to
be dropped as part of revised admissions standards under con
sideration by the UC Regents.
Though Stanford does not formally require the test, the
University currently "recommends" the tests for all freshman
applicants.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott said that Stanford
University will keep the SAT Subject Tests as one of many fac
tors in determining student admissions.
"The SAT Subject Tests assess what goes on in the class
room, are reflective of the classroom experience and we do
value them as one of the many criteria we use," Abbott said in
an email to The Daily.
He said that the SAT Subject
Test scores are a useful tool in
admissions because "with more
than 25,000 applicants, we need to
turn to some quantifiable measures
in evaluating candidates."
"The SAT Subject Test scores —
as well as ACT scores, AP scores
and IB scores — help us by provid
ing additional quantitative variables
to employ in our evaluations," he
said.
While Stanford will maintain the
SAT Subject Tests as a measure of a
student's qualifications, Abbott said
that other factors in an applicant's
profile are far more important.
"SA T Subject Test scores are just
one variable we use in our selection
process," he said. "There is no magic
formula or percentage allocated to
any particular variable. I'd say they
rank pretty high on what we consid
er to be important, but the high
school record — GPA, class rank
and course rigor — will always fac
tor in more heavily in our evalua

tion process."
While Abbott could not com
ment on the accuracy of SAT
Subject Test scores in predicting
applicants' success at Stanford, he
did say that many studies have indi
cated that the tests are a good pre
dictor of success in college.
One common criticism of the
SAT Subject Tests is that students
can only be prepared if adequate
educational resources are available
to them. As a result, underprivi
leged students are at a disadvantage
when taking the tests.
"1 wouldn't argue with the point
that students who can afford to pay
for preparatory courses have an
advantage with regard to practicing
for the SAT, or any test for that mat
ter," Abbott said. "But what is far
more critical to note, however, is
that we review every single candi
date within the context of their
environment. We're fully aware that
not everyone has the advantage of
test preparation and that's exactly
why there is no minimum or magic
score one needs to secure admission
to Stanford."
