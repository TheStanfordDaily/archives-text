## SAT subject tests still required Director of Admission says University has no plans to cut tests from admission criteria 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
While a faculty panel from the University of California
recently proposed omitting the SAT Subject Tests — formerly
known as the SAT lis — as a criterion for admission, Stanford
has no plans to ditch the tests.
Subject tests have been required by the University of
California for 40 years, but UC systemwide Academic Senate
Chairman Michael Brown expects the SAT II requirement to
be dropped as part of revised admissions standards under con
sideration by the UC Regents.
Though Stanford does not formally require the test, the
University currently "recommends" the tests for all freshman
applicants.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott said that Stanford
University will keep the SAT Subject Tests as one of many fac
tors in determining student admissions.
"The SAT Subject Tests assess what goes on in the class
room, are reflective of the classroom experience and we do
value them as one of the many criteria we use," Abbott said in
an email to The Daily.
