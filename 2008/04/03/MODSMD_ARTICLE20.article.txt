## I've been April fooled 
### 
At long last things are begin
ning to get interesting again.
With the Final Four ahead,
baseball season underway, and the
NFL Draft and NBA Playoffs just
around the corner, the sports world
seems to have finally escaped from
its late winter doldrums.
But newfound excitement and an
ticipation is only a recent develop
ment, and has arrived only at the ex
pense of plenty of twists, turns and
turbulent upheavals that certainly
left me confused. Just one example:
When 1 left for a ten-day trip with
some friends for spring break, the
Houston Rockets held the best
record in the NBA's Western Confer
ence. Now? Hello, sixth place.
And the amazing thing? That's
about the least surprising thing I've
noticed in recent days. Suffice to say,
it's been a crazy couple of weeks. So
without further ado, let me present
the First Annual (Belated) April
Fool's sports list — and if you could
n't guess, I'm definitely the fool here.
But I'm guessing I'm not alone.
Stanford hoops —So the men
made the Sweet 16. Fantastic. In any
given year, that's the kind of achieve
ment Cardinal fans everywhere can
be proud of. The problem is, as I see
it, this wasn't any given year. It was a
minor miracle that Brook Lopez de
cided to return to the Farm for his
sophomore season, and a major mir
acle (and proof that a divine being is
a Stanford fan) that a set of seven
foot twins qualified for and wanted
to attend Stanford.
Honestly, take a look around —
opportunities like that don't come up
very often. How many twin seven
footers has Duke had? Kansas?
North Carolina? UCLA? Kentucky?
You name the traditional basketball
powerhouse and they've probably
never been so lucky to essentially set
up their front-court with that kind of
talent in one fell swoop.
So the problem, as I see it, isn't
that the Cardinal was eliminated by
Texas last weekend, because being
one of the top sixteen teams in the
nation is quite an accomplishment in
itself. It's that if Stanford ever had a
chance to be truly dominant, this was
it. Anyone who watched the team all
season, though, could see that there
was a fatal flaw — there was no out
side presence to take pressure off the
big men down low.
And now we'll always wonder
what could have been, as Brook and
Robin get set to earn their millions in
the NBA. Put UCLA's Darren Colli
son on the Cardinal and it's in the
National Championship game, but
Collison's so good you could proba
bly say that about a lot of teams.
April Fool's — It happens every
year. I wake up, forget what day it is,
and am fooled by one of literally
dozens of fake news stories about
one of my favorite teams. This year
my befuddlement came courtesy of a
phone call from my dad, who had
heard on Bay Area sports talk radio
station KNBR that the Giants had
made a trade with the Indians to ac
quire left fielder Franklin Gutierrez.
Initially, the name sounded famil
iar, but I didn't know much else. So I
looked up the stats and started to get
excited. Then I read newspaper sto
ries about his spring training outings
and heroics in Cleveland's opening
day game against the White Sox. By
the time I figured out that the deal
was way too good to be true I'd al
ready cemented the idea of an excit
ing young hitter in San Francisco's
lineup (which would be a first this
decade) in my mind.The gradual re
alization that the Giants' offense
would be just as horrifically un
watchable as ever probably made
this the most painful bamboozle
ment of all time, at least in the post-
Benedict Arnold era.
Matt Lcinart, Party Animal —
Okay, not gonna lie, I don't actually
think anyone was fooled by this. But
how can I let a column slide by with
out mentioning the latest hot-tub
heroics of the former Throwin' Tro
jan? Frankly, the only things that sur
prised me were A) that this was con
sidered news-worthy and B) Leinart
is still considered a celebrity after
two entirely unremarkable seasons


Denis
Griffin
with the down-and-out Arizona
Cardinals.
Jerry Jones wants "Pacman"
Jones for "America's Team" —
Again, not the biggest surprise in the
world. But at this point I'm just won
dering if Jerry has looked into the
availability of Lawrence Phillips yet.
The former Nebraska star, who
faces multiple charges of assault and
basically ended Steve Young's ca
reer in 1999 might make a fine addi
tion to the Cowboys backfield if
Jerry could only get him out of jail.
Sure, he's getting a little long in the
tooth, but Phillips' off the field an
tics have done enough to keep him
off the field that he's still got plenty
of tread on the tires. I know that 1,
for one, am eagerly awaiting the day
when Terrell Owens is considered
the franchise's model citizen.

Would you like to petition Jerry Jones
to pursue as many convicts, malcon
tents, and all around good-guys as he
possibly can find'.'' Email Denis Grif
