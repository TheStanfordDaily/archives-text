# UNDER THE SURFACE

On the surface, water polo does
not seem to be an extremely
physical sport. It certainly does
not offer the same visuals as
sports like football, hockey, or
basketball, where there are constant collisions
and players hitting the floor, field or ice. Per
haps it is the fact that the sport is played in the
water that does not make it look as rough. But
ask any water polo player, and they'll tell you
that their sport is a lot more physical than you
might think.
"Water polo is an extremely demanding
sport," said Stanford head coach John Tanner.
"Players have to sprint end-to-end, never
touch the bottom, jostle for position, and can
only touch the ball with one hand."
Because the players are not allowed to
touch the bottom of the pool, they have to con
stantly keep themselves afloat while they are
in the water. The most commonly used tech
nique for treading water is called "egg-beat
ing", because the player's legs move in a circu
lar motion that resembles that of an egg-beat
er. So, unlike in most other sports, there is no
time to rest when you are in a water polo
game.
On top of the constant movement is one of

the most important elements in the game:
Fighting for position.
"Water polo is a mentally and physically
tough sport that places a huge emphasis on po
sitioning — a players whereabouts in relation
to the ball, the goal, and their own player," said
junior Heather West. "I strive to be complete
ly conscious of my positioning in the water
wherever 1 am in the pool, a skill that all ath
letes at our level focus on.

"The best players in collegiate
water polo will make you pay"

"If a player forgets to keep their hips up or
loses track of the ball, the best players in colle
giate water polo will make you pay — usually
with a goal or a kick-out [man-up situation]."
Positioning is especially important when
close to the goal, where players on offense
need to work to get into goal-scoring posi
tions, while players on defense try not to let

Heather West and the women's water polo team do not have it that easy in the pool. Water polo
is a much more physical game than viewers are led to believe.
