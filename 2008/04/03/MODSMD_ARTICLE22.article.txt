# Softball picks up important win
## Penna and Chinn combine for shutout 
### DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Softball team is back
to its winning ways.
After dropping three consecutive
games to start Pacific-10 Conference
play this past weekend, Stanford rode
the bat of junior shortstop Maddy
Coon and the arm of junior pitcher
Missy Penna Wednesday to a 3-0 vic
tory over Sacramento State.
Stanford, playing its first road
game after 15 straight home games,
came out a bit sluggish against the
Hornets, managing only four hits off
of three different Sacramento State
pitchers, but Coon was able to pick
the team up.
With one out and no score in the
top of the third, sophomore center
fielder Alissa Haber doubled to the
right center field gap; two batters
later. Coon drove a 3-1 pitch over the
center field fence to give the Cardinal
the lead for good.
Penna, as well as freshman Ash
ley Chinn, combined for another
complete game shutout victory for
Cardinal pitching. Penna went six
innings, allowing just two hits while
striking out eight. Chinn came on to
get the last three outs, walking one
and striking out two for the save.
The Hornets never posed a real
threat to the shutout, with only two
players reaching second base all

game.
The Cardinal offense wasn't much
more prolific, however.
Stanford picked up its last run in
the top of the sixth. After senior left
fielderTricia Aggabao walked to lead
off the inning. Coon continued her
strong day by shooting a triple into
the right centerfield gap. scoring Ag
gabao.
After sophomore catcher Rosey
Neill struck out and senior third base
man Michelle Smith walked, senior
Jess Zutz pinch ran for Smith, making
her Stanford softball debut. Zutz,
who has been a field hockey star for
four years at Stanford (a four-time all
NorPac player) was picked up by
head coach John Rittman a day ago
to add speed to the Cardinal's thin
bench.
Zutz was unable to show off her
speed in her first game in a Cardinal
uniform, however, as she advanced to
second on a Shannon Koplitz walk,
before being stranded there to end
the inning.
ITie win was a huge one for the
Cardinal, who after starting the sea
son 32-2, lost three straight games by
a combined score of 13 to 1.
The Cardinal offense looked less
than explosive today, and it will need
to come alive for Stanford to bounce
back from its 0-3 start in conference
play.
It won't be easy tor the Cardinal,
