# BOUNCING BACK
## 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON 
January 19, 2007 is a night Jason
Shen will always remember. Stan
ford was competing in its first meet
of the year, facing Cal at Haas Pavil
ion in Berkeley. The Card had just
swept pommel horse and placed first and
second on still rings. Shen had already com
peted in the floor exercise and pommel
horse when the Stanford men moved on to
their fourth rotation: Vault.
Shen remembers his vault vividly.
"It was a new vault," he said,one that he
had done for the first time in competition
the previous week. "It didn't feel that bad
when I was in the air. but I could tell I was
going to be a little off on my landing."
He had no idea how "off' the landing
would be.
"For a split second it seemed OK, then
my knee just dropped down. It was like it
was made of Playdough." Jason didn't feel
a pop or a snap — his knee "just melted.
And then it hurt a lot. Next thing I remem

ber is hearing myself screaming."
The trainers rushed over to Jason and
initially thought he had dislocated his
kneecap because it was obviously out of
place. No one realized the extent of his in
jury."[lt was a) dislocated right knee joint,"
he said.
On one landing, in one split second,
Jason Shen had torn all four major knee lig
aments — the anterior, posterior, medial
and lateral crutiate ligaments. The only
thing holding his lower leg to his thigh was
muscle, skin and his patellar tendon.
Jason was born in China but moved to
Massachusetts when he was three years
old. He started doing gymnastics when he
was six. "A bunch of my friends were doing
it, and I started doing well, so I stuck with
it."
He was helped by a fine pedigree — his
mother was a gymnast in China and went
on to be a coach. However, his mother ac
tually tried to keep Jason away from gym
nastics.

Jason Shen has been through it all at Stanford. He is currently competing again after tearing four lig
aments in his knee last season, when doctors told him he might never recover.
"She didn't want me to be a gym
nast," Shen said. Her own gymnastics
experience in communist China was
"rough," and she didn't want her son
to go through the same hard times she
endured. But Jason enjoyed the sport,
and by age 11 he was competing at na
tional meets.
Jason was good, but he wasn't
great. That all changed after his fresh
man year of high school.
"I switched [club] teams going into
my sophomore year and started train
ing with this really intense Armenian
coach," he said. From there, his career
took off.
Shen made the U.S. Junior Nation
al Team and won the all-around com
petition at the Massachusetts High
School State Championship that year,
and by his senior year he won six of
seven events at the State meet includ
ing the all-around title.
As a freshman on the Farm, Shen
had a pretty good year. He describes
himself then as a "solid" gymnast, but
his start values were too low to score
big points at NCAAs. But with a year
of experience under his belt. Jason
broke out as a sophomore, competing
for Stanford at NCAAs in floor exer
cise, vault, parallel bars, and high bar.
His parallel bars set earned him a 12th
place finish. Jason had arrived, and
was poised to be a big contributor for
the Cardinal in 2007.
Although the knee injury ended
his season, Jason refused to let it end
his career.
The doctors told him that he might
never recover from the injury because
it was so bad. But Shen was adamant
about getting back to competing, and

was in rehabilitation constantly. 364
days later, at the same exact meet
where the injury took place, Shen was
competing again on pommel horse. It
took him 364 days to defy the doctors
and defy the odds that were very
much stacked against him.
ITie knee, however, was not quite
ready to get back into the full swing of
things. It wasn't until February that he
was allowed to do a dismount on par
allel bars, one of his best events.
Jason's presence in the gym has
been a big boost for the Stanford
men's gymnastics team. Before the in
jury, his toughness and aggressive atti
tude in practice made the whole team
better. According to head coach
Thorn Glielmi, Jason made everyone
else step up their game on a daily
basis. Although his still-healing knee
has made him more cautious, he is still
a tough competitor.
"When he gets on the equipment
he has that' Eye of the Tiger' attitude,"
said Glielmi. You can take Jason Shen
out of the competition, but his com
petitive fire just won't go out.
Shen and the rest of the No. 1
Stanford gymnastics team heads to
the University of Nebraska on Thurs
day for the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships. The
meet will be held Saturday, and the
Card will be looking to dethrone
reigning champion Oklahoma, which
has won the past three conference
championships. Does that make
Stanford the underdog despite the
top ranking? Not exactly, according
to the coach.
"I don't look at it that way," said Gliel
mi. "We don't worry about what other
teams are doing.The guys know that if
they take care of their business, we'll
come out on top."

his career.
The doctors told him that he might
never recover from the injury because
it was so bad. But Shen was adamant
about getting back to competing, and

was in rehabilitation constantly. 364
days later, at the same exact meet
where the injury took place, Shen was
competing again on pommel horse. It
took him 364 days to defy the doctors
and defy the odds that were very
much stacked against him.
ITie knee, however, was not quite
ready to get back into the full swing of
things. It wasn't until February that he
was allowed to do a dismount on par
allel bars, one of his best events.
Jason's presence in the gym has
been a big boost for the Stanford
men's gymnastics team. Before the in
jury, his toughness and aggressive atti
tude in practice made the whole team
better. According to head coach
Thorn Glielmi, Jason made everyone
else step up their game on a daily
basis. Although his still-healing knee
has made him more cautious, he is still
a tough competitor.
"When he gets on the equipment
he has that' Eye of the Tiger' attitude,"
said Glielmi. You can take Jason Shen
out of the competition, but his com
petitive fire just won't go out.
Shen and the rest of the No. 1
Stanford gymnastics team heads to
the University of Nebraska on Thurs
day for the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships. The
meet will be held Saturday, and the
Card will be looking to dethrone
reigning champion Oklahoma, which
has won the past three conference
championships. Does that make
Stanford the underdog despite the
top ranking? Not exactly, according
to the coach.
"I don't look at it that way," said Gliel
mi. "We don't worry about what other
teams are doing.The guys know that if
they take care of their business, we'll
come out on top."
