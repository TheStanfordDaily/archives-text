# BOUNCING BACK
## 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON 
January 19, 2007 is a night Jason
Shen will always remember. Stan
ford was competing in its first meet
of the year, facing Cal at Haas Pavil
ion in Berkeley. The Card had just
swept pommel horse and placed first and
second on still rings. Shen had already com
peted in the floor exercise and pommel
horse when the Stanford men moved on to
their fourth rotation: Vault.
Shen remembers his vault vividly.
"It was a new vault," he said,one that he
had done for the first time in competition
the previous week. "It didn't feel that bad
when I was in the air. but I could tell I was
going to be a little off on my landing."
He had no idea how "off' the landing
would be.
"For a split second it seemed OK, then
my knee just dropped down. It was like it
was made of Playdough." Jason didn't feel
a pop or a snap — his knee "just melted.
And then it hurt a lot. Next thing I remem

ber is hearing myself screaming."
The trainers rushed over to Jason and
initially thought he had dislocated his
kneecap because it was obviously out of
place. No one realized the extent of his in
jury."[lt was a) dislocated right knee joint,"
he said.
On one landing, in one split second,
Jason Shen had torn all four major knee lig
aments — the anterior, posterior, medial
and lateral crutiate ligaments. The only
thing holding his lower leg to his thigh was
muscle, skin and his patellar tendon.
Jason was born in China but moved to
Massachusetts when he was three years
old. He started doing gymnastics when he
was six. "A bunch of my friends were doing
it, and I started doing well, so I stuck with
it."
He was helped by a fine pedigree — his
mother was a gymnast in China and went
on to be a coach. However, his mother ac
tually tried to keep Jason away from gym
nastics.

Jason Shen has been through it all at Stanford. He is currently competing again after tearing four lig
aments in his knee last season, when doctors told him he might never recover.
