Pulitzer Prize-winning American history'
Prof. David Kennedy '63 will be retiring this
July after 40 years as a professor on the
Farm.
Kennedy will become an Emeritus
Professor, teaching an occasional undergrad
uate class and advising graduate students.

The history professor has played a promi
nent role in undergraduate education at
Stanford for many years and was honored
with the Hoagland Prize for Undergraduate
Teaching in 2005.
Kennedy has also been highly regarded
among his fellow faculty-members.
Following the presentation of the Hoagland
Prize, former Chairwoman of the History
Department Carolyn Lougee Chappel

claimed, "David has done it all and done it
with generosity, grace and devotion to stu
dents at all levels."
According to Kennedy, he is retiring now.
in part, because of a desire to allow new pro
fessors to make their mark on the study of
history.
"1 have been teaching at Stanford for 40
years," Kennedy said, 'it's time to
make room for a younger generation."
Another reason for Kennedy's
retirement is his intention to focus
his energies on the Bill Lane Center
for the Study of the North American
West. Kennedy is currently a co

director of the Lane Center, which is
committed to studying the United
States west of the Mississippi River,
Canada west of Ontario, and all of
Mexico. Topics of study include
immigration and environmental
issues pertaining to the North
American West.
"Since 1%7 I've been teaching
and I've enjoyed it all, but to be
frank, the obligations of running the
Lane Center are considerable,"
Kennedy said.

Members of the History depart
ment offered words of praise for
their colleague upon hearing of his
impending retirement. According to
History Prof. Jack Rakove, Kennedy
has been a model Stanford citizen
and has contributed greatly to the
University.
"David has been virtually a leg
endary figure at Stanford," Rakove
said. "David's participation in
University affairs has been across
the board and he has reallv been a

Mr. Stanford and overall University
citizen. Very few of our colleagues
have contributed as much as he has
to the University."
The University honored
Kennedy's life and work with a Mar.
7-8 conference entitled "Reflections
on the American Condition: A
Celebration of the Career of David
M. Kennedy."
