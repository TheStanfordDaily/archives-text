# Leading the way
## Junior Cord Phelps' bat key for the Cardinal 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Baseball is the ultimate team sport.
More than in any other game, a team
needs to work together to achieve success,
and more than in any other game, a very
talented player can be rendered useless if
he is not supported by his teammates. In
basketball, a superstar can carry his team
completely, winning games almost single
handedly. In football, a great quarterback,
running back, or receiver can often make
all the difference.
But baseball is different. In baseball, a
great pitcher can't win if his defense does
n't make plays and his team doesn't score
runs. A slugger can't drive in runs if no one
gets on base in front of him. And, because
the average baseball season demands so
many more games, no individual athlete
can do it all for his team day in and day
out. It takes a team that can work together
and support each other to have a winning
franchise.
Without good pitching, from the rota
tion and from the bullpen, a team is not
going to win very often. Without solid
defense, it is difficult for there to be good
pitching, and without an offense that can
score runs, no team can win. Obviously, the
entire lineup matters in that regard, which
begins with the crucial lead-off spot. And
Stanford has a heck of a player to fill that
role.
The job of the lead-off hitter is to
stretch out his at-bat (the first of the
game), allowing his teammates to see as
many pitches as possible before their turn,
so they have an idea of what to expect. At
the same time he wants to get on base any
way he can, so that the batters behind him
have someone to drive home. And he is
supposed to do all this without the benefit
of having taken or seen others take at-bats
against the pitcher he is facing.

Junior Cord Phelps has got this pretty
much down to an art, and the Cardinal is
reaping the benefits.
"In a lead-off hitter you are hoping his
on-base percentage is very good," said
head coach Mark Marquess. '•(Phelps] is
doing his job in that regard. I le is the ideal
lead off hitter."
I le certainly is. I leading into this week
end's games against Arizona State, Phelps
boasts an on-base percentage of .490, the
best on the team and the sixth-best mark
in the Pacific-10 Conference. He also leads

asset to the lineup and is a leader in most
statistical categories.
the team in hits with 34 and is second
in both batting average (.415) and
runs scored (20). Not to mention his
streak of reaching base at least once
in 27 consecutive games, stretching
back to last season.
"One of the bigger parts of being a
lead-off hitter, especially in the first
at-bat of the game, is to give everyone

hitting behind you an opportunity to
see pitches," said Phelps. "I work on
my approach in practice all the time.
I try to only swing at pitches that 1 hit
well and work counts.That's the men
tality I have for all my at-bats, but it
depends on the situation. If there is a
man in scoring position I'm going to
swing if 1 see a good pitch."
That is what makes Phelps such a
valuable player. While he excels in
the lead-off role, he is just as effective
in other situations.
Phelps has proven his ability to
deliver the big hit with runners on

and is currently fourth on the team
with 14 RBIs. He can hit for power
and is third on the team in homeruns
(three) and extra-base hits (10). He
does it in the field too, playing every
game this season at second base and
only recording a single error. And as
if that wasn't enough, he is a switch
hitter.
So, is there any part of Phelps's
game that isn't impressive?
"If I wanted to make him a super
man, I could turn him into the fastest
man in world and have him steal 100
bases," said Marquess.

Nobody could steal 100, hut
Phelps is first on the team in that cat
egory already with five swiped bags
on the year.
When questioned about his suc
cesses, the ever-modest Phelps is the
first to point out that without his
teammates, his play wouldn't mean
anything. If he gets on base and isn't
driven around to score, or if no one
gets on in front of him in the later in
nings, there isn't much he can do to
help Stanford win.
"[Once I get on base) I just try to
let the guys behind me do their thing.

and that's how we score." he said.
It will take that complete team ef
fort this weekend to win against a
nearly flawless Arizona State team.
Ilie Sun Devils come to Sunken Dia
mond with a 26-1 record and a No. 1
national ranking. But consider this:
when scoring a run in the first inning
Stanford is 8-2 this year and when
scoring first they are 11-5.
With Phelps in the lead-off spot,
the team has to like their chances.

nearly flawless Arizona State team.
Ilie Sun Devils come to Sunken Dia
mond with a 26-1 record and a No. 1
national ranking. But consider this:
when scoring a run in the first inning
Stanford is 8-2 this year and when
scoring first they are 11-5.
With Phelps in the lead-off spot,
the team has to like their chances.
