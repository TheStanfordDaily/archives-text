## Junior Cord Phelps' bat key for the Cardinal 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Baseball is the ultimate team sport.
More than in any other game, a team
needs to work together to achieve success,
and more than in any other game, a very
talented player can be rendered useless if
he is not supported by his teammates. In
basketball, a superstar can carry his team
completely, winning games almost single
handedly. In football, a great quarterback,
running back, or receiver can often make
all the difference.
But baseball is different. In baseball, a
great pitcher can't win if his defense does
n't make plays and his team doesn't score
runs. A slugger can't drive in runs if no one
gets on base in front of him. And, because
the average baseball season demands so
many more games, no individual athlete
can do it all for his team day in and day
out. It takes a team that can work together
and support each other to have a winning
franchise.
Without good pitching, from the rota
tion and from the bullpen, a team is not
going to win very often. Without solid
defense, it is difficult for there to be good
pitching, and without an offense that can
score runs, no team can win. Obviously, the
entire lineup matters in that regard, which
begins with the crucial lead-off spot. And
Stanford has a heck of a player to fill that
role.
The job of the lead-off hitter is to
stretch out his at-bat (the first of the
game), allowing his teammates to see as
many pitches as possible before their turn,
so they have an idea of what to expect. At
the same time he wants to get on base any
way he can, so that the batters behind him
have someone to drive home. And he is
supposed to do all this without the benefit
of having taken or seen others take at-bats
against the pitcher he is facing.

Junior Cord Phelps has got this pretty
much down to an art, and the Cardinal is
reaping the benefits.
"In a lead-off hitter you are hoping his
on-base percentage is very good," said
head coach Mark Marquess. 'â€¢(Phelps] is
doing his job in that regard. I le is the ideal
lead off hitter."
I le certainly is. I leading into this week
end's games against Arizona State, Phelps
boasts an on-base percentage of .490, the
best on the team and the sixth-best mark
in the Pacific-10 Conference. He also leads

Junior Cord Phelps is the lead-off hitter for
the Stanford baseball team. He is a huge
asset to the lineup and is a leader in most
statistical categories.
