# Focus of student campaigns shifts
## New Election Committee and SOCC policies reduce importance of ads and endorsements in election 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A spate of campaign flyering began at
12:01 a.m. yesterday, as candidates kicked of
the 2008 ASSU election cycle. But personal
contact and old fashioned one-on-one con
vincing rather than mass flyering and stu
dent group endorsements may decide this
year's ASSU Elections, largely thanks to
actions by the Election Committee and the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC).
The Election Committee has taken steps
to reduce the importance of advertisements
— Fair Campaign Policies now ban bath
room fliers and limit executive slates to 6(X)
paper advertisements, and class slates and
senators to 300. Endorsements will also be
less significant this year because of the his
torically influential SOCC's announcement
that it will not be endorsing an executive
slate.
Six executive slates will compete in this
campaign cycle: Jonny Dorsey '09 and Pagan
Harris '09, Go Go Gobaud Goldgof —
David Gobaud '08 and Greg Goldgof '08.
Priyanka Sharma '09 and Jack Cackler '09,
Sagar Doshi '09 and Philip 1 lon '10. REVO
LUTION -Red Daly '09 and Jonathan
Rich '10. and Barrack Obamma '08 —
Meghan McCurdy '09 and Patrick Maher
'09.
The new advertising restrictions have
forced candidates to consider new, more
personal approaches to getting their mes
sages out. according to presidential hopeful
Doshi.

"In the past, people have put up posters
all over the place, and it's been very exces
sive, this year there are not nearly as many
posters up," Doshi said. "People have to
look at new creative ways to get their names
out there. We are making sure we have con
tacts all over the campus; we are trying to
get more people out on the ground."
ITiis new, more personal and creative
campaign style was shown off by sopho
more slate ticket McLeven. which stomped
around campus dining halls last night blar
ing Montell Jordan's "This is How We Do
It" while shouting campaign promises
through megaphones instead of posting
hundreds of flyers.
"Any sort of success starts with personal
interaction, it's more important than how
much money you spend on fliers and T
shirts,"said McLeven candidate Max Hawes
'11.
"It's about convincing people on a one
to-one basis," Doshi added. "To really get to
someone's heart, you need to be able to
connect."
Presidential candidate Sharma was also
optimistic about the new policies, saying
that it will help take money out of the cam
paign equation and will level the playing
field.
"1 would say it's a good equalizing force,
because Stanford is a diverse body, and dif
ferent people can afford different things."
Sharma said. "For us. we are spending an
amount we are comfortable spending. Our
focus is our platform, and that is
what we are trying to do — reach
out from person to person. The
restriction works well because the
focus is on your issues, not on having
3,000 more fliers than someone
else."
The restrictions could make it
easier for students to take control of
candidates' agendas, according to
Senate candidate Patrick Cordova
'09.
"A lot of times the candidates are
focusing on getting individuals to
tell them what they are interested
in," Cordova said, pointing to the
Sharma-Cackler slate's presence in
White Plaza yesterday, where they
asked passer-bys what issues they
wanted addressed during the cam
paign. "Hopefully, the populace will
tell the candidates [what they think
is important], and they will act on
what they hear."
Elections commissioner Ryan
Woessner '10 is very happy with the
way candidates have responded to
the new policies.
"I have been very impressed by
the candidates' willingness to follow
the policies and many have said that
they appreciate being limited to the
number of fliers so that they can
campaign more effectively than in
years past," Woessner said. "So far,
every minor violation has been
taken care of by the candidates, so
no major issues."

This year's elections will also be
marked by a lesser focus on
endorsements, highlighted by
SOCC's decision not to endorse an
executive slate.
"I feel like endorsements should
not be the focus of any student elec
tion," said Sharma. whose Sharma-
Cackler slate sports endorsements
from the Stanford Review, Queer-
Straight Alliance, Inter-Fraternity
Council and Multiracial Identified
Communities.
"We talk to everyone, student
group and student alike." continued
Sharma. "What we seek is input on
how we can serve them better. I'm
hoping this year the ASSU moves
past endorsements being the key to
success."
Doshi suggested that endorse
ments are less important because all
of the competing slates are well situ
ated to address certain problems.
"We finally have a group of slates
that SOCC feels is pursuing their
general goals," Doshi said. "When
SOCC feels that all the slates are
comfortable with these ideas, that
means that the people running are
guaranteed to have [diversity issues]
in mind. It should start to level the
playing field."
This year's endorsement situa
tion should ultimately further the
emerging theme of the election —
personal interaction.
"The most important thing about
this election is not going to be
endorsement," Doshi said, "but the
way that you connect with people."
