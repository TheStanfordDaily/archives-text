# Focus of student campaigns shifts
## New Election Committee and SOCC policies reduce importance of ads and endorsements in election 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A spate of campaign flyering began at
12:01 a.m. yesterday, as candidates kicked of
the 2008 ASSU election cycle. But personal
contact and old fashioned one-on-one con
vincing rather than mass flyering and stu
dent group endorsements may decide this
year's ASSU Elections, largely thanks to
actions by the Election Committee and the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC).
The Election Committee has taken steps
to reduce the importance of advertisements
— Fair Campaign Policies now ban bath
room fliers and limit executive slates to 6(X)
paper advertisements, and class slates and
senators to 300. Endorsements will also be
less significant this year because of the his
torically influential SOCC's announcement
that it will not be endorsing an executive
slate.
Six executive slates will compete in this
campaign cycle: Jonny Dorsey '09 and Pagan
Harris '09, Go Go Gobaud Goldgof —
David Gobaud '08 and Greg Goldgof '08.
Priyanka Sharma '09 and Jack Cackler '09,
Sagar Doshi '09 and Philip 1 lon '10. REVO
LUTION -Red Daly '09 and Jonathan
Rich '10. and Barrack Obamma '08 —
Meghan McCurdy '09 and Patrick Maher
'09.
The new advertising restrictions have
forced candidates to consider new, more

Doshi.

"In the past, people have put up posters
all over the place, and it's been very exces

posters up," Doshi said. "People have to
look at new creative ways to get their names
out there. We are making sure we have con
tacts all over the campus; we are trying to
get more people out on the ground."
ITiis new, more personal and creative
campaign style was shown off by sopho
more slate ticket McLeven. which stomped
around campus dining halls last night blar
ing Montell Jordan's "This is How We Do
It" while shouting campaign promises
through megaphones instead of posting
hundreds of flyers.
"Any sort of success starts with personal
interaction, it's more important than how
much money you spend on fliers and T
shirts,"said McLeven candidate Max Hawes
'11.
"It's about convincing people on a one
to-one basis," Doshi added. "To really get to
someone's heart, you need to be able to
connect."
Presidential candidate Sharma was also
optimistic about the new policies, saying
that it will help take money out of the cam
paign equation and will level the playing
field.
"1 would say it's a good equalizing force,
because Stanford is a diverse body, and dif
ferent people can afford different things."
Sharma said. "For us. we are spending an
amount we are comfortable spending. Our
