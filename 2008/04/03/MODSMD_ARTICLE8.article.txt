# NFL DRAFT
## Taking the next STEP Sanchez among players pursuing next level in football 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In their winter quarter and beyond, most Stanford seniors
are consumed with planning for the future — printing out
resumes, interviewing and awaiting grad school acceptances.
ITie situation is no different for graduated senior Nick
Sanchez — except that his interview process is on the field
and in the weight room, pursuing his dream of playing pro
fessional football.
The 6 foot, 190-pound cornerback from swampy Belle
Glade, Florida made plenty of headlines in a Cardinal uni
form and is among 11 players from the 2007 team seeking a
future in football.
While receivers Mark Bradford, Evan Moore and punter
Jay Ottovegio are among Stanford's brightest prospects,
Sanchez fits the profile of a productive, hard-working college
player who might have to spend time in another profession
al league before getting a shot at the NFL.
"1 just want to keep playing as long as I can." Sanchez
says.
He has history on his side — recent Stanford defensive
backs Oshiomogho Atogwe, Stanley Wilson. T.J. Rushing,
Leigh Torrance, Brandon Harrison and David Lofton have
all played professional football in the U.S. or Canada after
leaving the Farm.
Non-NFL options include the Arena Football League, an
indoor reduced-field form of football, and the Canadian
Football League, which has long sent a portion of its players
on to NFL success.
A wild-card option is the All American Football League,
a proposed professional league requiring all its players to
have college degrees. With six franchises, the AAFL has

twice postponed the start of its inaugural season,
now scheduled for 2009.
Not all players follow Sanchez's path. Quiet but
productive defensive captain Chris Horn, a defen
sive lineman, will hang up his cleats in favor of a ca
reer that better leverages his two engineering de
grees from the University. He is one of seven play
ers who have decided their Stanford experience
will be their last on a football field. As for Sanchez,
however, he has endured the necessary process in
the previous months in the hopes of keeping his
professional aspirations alive.
The Agent
Almost every player who has decided to go pro
retains a sports agent, which Sanchez did after his
senior season ended. An agent acts as a catch-all
advocate for a player, marketing him to franchises
as well as administrating contract details, finances
and public relations. In return, the agent receives a
commission, often a percentage of the client's
earnings.
Sanchez said the process of acquiring an agent
is "like college recruiting." Agents make contact
with athletes and keep in close touch, attempting
to woo players.
Agents will sometimes offer cash and valuables to
athletes to entice them to sign. Accepting such
extra benefits compromises a player's amateur
status and NCAA eligibility, and like other
schools, Stanford warns players against it.
Sanchez says there's no real formula or secret
to picking the right agent — "you just go with the
guy you feel most comfortable with." Sanchez
chose an agent based in Honolulu.
Staying in shape
In the winter, football strength and condition
ing coach Shannon Ttirley led workouts for the
squad's hopeful pro players. Unlike the team's
winter conditioning sessions, the pro hopefuls'
workouts are specifically tailored to improve play
ers' Pro Day and NFL Combine performances —
the numbers the NFL scouts will use to decide who
to draft.
One unit shy of his degree, Sanchez filled the

rest of his time with a communications course that
put him over the top.
While Sanchez's speed and strength numbers
may not put him on top of teams' draft boards, his
heart and production are unquestionable. He en
tered the 2007 season as the team's active leader in
career tackles with 100, and ended his career with
153 stops and seven interceptions in 24 starts.
Sanchez racked up several last-minute game-de-

Combine performances

ciding plays in his Stanford career, including two of
last season's four victories — he collected two crit
ical interceptions in the fourth quarter against Cal
ifornia and forced a devastating fumble that all but
sealed the comeback win at Arizona.
On Mar. 20, Sanchez participated in Pro Day at
Stanford along with ten teammates. Players were
evaluated indoors for vertical jump, broad jump
and bench press. On the artificial turf field, the ath
letes were tested in a cone drill, the 20- and 60-yard
shuttles and the übiquitous 40-yard dash. In per
haps the quintessential measure of speed in foot

ball scouting. Sanchez clocked a 40 time of 4.56.
Also participating were three Stanford football
alumni: linebacker Michael Craven, safety Trevor
Hooper and multi-purpose player David Marrero.
Craven is looking towards the NFL after a career in
the Arena League, while Sanchez's housemate
Hooper hopes to make an NFL roster after being
cut just before the 2007 season by the Buffalo Bills.
Marrero took advantage of a new NCAA rule
allowing players who graduated in four years to
transfer without penalty. Football players are nor
mally required to sit out one season when transfer
ring between Division 1-A programs (The rule was
repealed by the NCAA after one season). Marrero
enrolled at San Jose State and spent the 2007 sea
son playing for the Spartans, who were defeated by-
Stanford 37-0 on Sept. 15.
The zero hour
Sanchez's final chance to impress will likely
come April 18, when he participates in a local
workout for the San Francisco 4 ( )ers.The workout
is designed to give the Niners franchise an advan
tageous close look at any Bay Area players who
may have been passed over by the general Com
bine and scouting services.
The NFL Draft takes place on April 26 and 27
in New York City. Free-agent contracts are typical
ly signed by the next crop of players just after the
Sunday session of the draft, followed by the AFL
and CFL.
When football is done, Sanchez says he would
like to stay involved in sports. That might include
coaching football, but he demurs from the long
hours worked by college coaches: "1 don't know if
1 want to live the coaching lifestyle."
Sanchez has not secured a fallback job in the
event he does not make the next level, preferring
to give his full attention to football for now. De
spite the odds, he is undaunted.
"I'm pretty confident I'll get a shot some
where."

In their winter quarter and beyond, most Stanford seniors
are consumed with planning for the future — printing out
resumes, interviewing and awaiting grad school acceptances.
ITie situation is no different for graduated senior Nick
Sanchez — except that his interview process is on the field
and in the weight room, pursuing his dream of playing pro
fessional football.
The 6 foot, 190-pound cornerback from swampy Belle
Glade, Florida made plenty of headlines in a Cardinal uni
form and is among 11 players from the 2007 team seeking a
future in football.
While receivers Mark Bradford, Evan Moore and punter
Jay Ottovegio are among Stanford's brightest prospects,
Sanchez fits the profile of a productive, hard-working college
player who might have to spend time in another profession
al league before getting a shot at the NFL.
"1 just want to keep playing as long as I can." Sanchez
says.
He has history on his side — recent Stanford defensive
backs Oshiomogho Atogwe, Stanley Wilson. T.J. Rushing,
Leigh Torrance, Brandon Harrison and David Lofton have
all played professional football in the U.S. or Canada after
leaving the Farm.
Non-NFL options include the Arena Football League, an
indoor reduced-field form of football, and the Canadian
Football League, which has long sent a portion of its players
on to NFL success.
A wild-card option is the All American Football League,
a proposed professional league requiring all its players to
have college degrees. With six franchises, the AAFL has

twice postponed the start of its inaugural season,
now scheduled for 2009.
Not all players follow Sanchez's path. Quiet but
productive defensive captain Chris Horn, a defen
sive lineman, will hang up his cleats in favor of a ca
reer that better leverages his two engineering de
grees from the University. He is one of seven play
ers who have decided their Stanford experience
will be their last on a football field. As for Sanchez,
however, he has endured the necessary process in
the previous months in the hopes of keeping his
professional aspirations alive.
The Agent
Almost every player who has decided to go pro
retains a sports agent, which Sanchez did after his
senior season ended. An agent acts as a catch-all
advocate for a player, marketing him to franchises
as well as administrating contract details, finances
and public relations. In return, the agent receives a
commission, often a percentage of the client's
earnings.
Sanchez said the process of acquiring an agent
is "like college recruiting." Agents make contact
with athletes and keep in close touch, attempting
to woo players.
Agents will sometimes offer cash and valuables to
athletes to entice them to sign. Accepting such
extra benefits compromises a player's amateur
status and NCAA eligibility, and like other
schools, Stanford warns players against it.
Sanchez says there's no real formula or secret
to picking the right agent — "you just go with the
guy you feel most comfortable with." Sanchez
chose an agent based in Honolulu.
Staying in shape
In the winter, football strength and condition
ing coach Shannon Ttirley led workouts for the
squad's hopeful pro players. Unlike the team's
winter conditioning sessions, the pro hopefuls'
workouts are specifically tailored to improve play
ers' Pro Day and NFL Combine performances —
the numbers the NFL scouts will use to decide who
to draft.
One unit shy of his degree, Sanchez filled the

rest of his time with a communications course that
put him over the top.
While Sanchez's speed and strength numbers
may not put him on top of teams' draft boards, his
heart and production are unquestionable. He en
tered the 2007 season as the team's active leader in
career tackles with 100, and ended his career with
153 stops and seven interceptions in 24 starts.
Sanchez racked up several last-minute game-de-

The pro hopefuls' workouts
ore specifically tailored to
improve Pro Day and NFL
Combine performances

ciding plays in his Stanford career, including two of
last season's four victories — he collected two crit
ical interceptions in the fourth quarter against Cal
ifornia and forced a devastating fumble that all but
sealed the comeback win at Arizona.
On Mar. 20, Sanchez participated in Pro Day at
Stanford along with ten teammates. Players were
evaluated indoors for vertical jump, broad jump
and bench press. On the artificial turf field, the ath
letes were tested in a cone drill, the 20- and 60-yard
shuttles and the übiquitous 40-yard dash. In per
haps the quintessential measure of speed in foot

ball scouting. Sanchez clocked a 40 time of 4.56.
Also participating were three Stanford football
alumni: linebacker Michael Craven, safety Trevor
Hooper and multi-purpose player David Marrero.
Craven is looking towards the NFL after a career in
the Arena League, while Sanchez's housemate
Hooper hopes to make an NFL roster after being
cut just before the 2007 season by the Buffalo Bills.
Marrero took advantage of a new NCAA rule
allowing players who graduated in four years to
transfer without penalty. Football players are nor
mally required to sit out one season when transfer
ring between Division 1-A programs (The rule was
repealed by the NCAA after one season). Marrero
enrolled at San Jose State and spent the 2007 sea
son playing for the Spartans, who were defeated by-
Stanford 37-0 on Sept. 15.
The zero hour
Sanchez's final chance to impress will likely
come April 18, when he participates in a local
workout for the San Francisco 4 ( )ers.The workout
is designed to give the Niners franchise an advan
tageous close look at any Bay Area players who
may have been passed over by the general Com
bine and scouting services.
The NFL Draft takes place on April 26 and 27
in New York City. Free-agent contracts are typical
ly signed by the next crop of players just after the
Sunday session of the draft, followed by the AFL
and CFL.
When football is done, Sanchez says he would
like to stay involved in sports. That might include
coaching football, but he demurs from the long
hours worked by college coaches: "1 don't know if
1 want to live the coaching lifestyle."
Sanchez has not secured a fallback job in the
event he does not make the next level, preferring
to give his full attention to football for now. De
spite the odds, he is undaunted.
"I'm pretty confident I'll get a shot some
where."
