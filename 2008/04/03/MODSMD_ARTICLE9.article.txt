## Stanford Cheer bring it on 
### ANDREA COWAN 
y —* hey sat on the sidelines, legs crossed, watching as
Stanford and Arizona faced off. When the timeout
whistle sounded, they leapt to attention and took to
J the gym floor. Two did hack handsprings across the
L. floor as three were lifted high into the air — only to
be thrown back to the ground, smiling the entire time.
No, they were not the Dollies; they were Stanford Cheer.
The team, which was formed just six years ago. has been
struggling with a low profile on campus ever since: Each year,
the members devote hours to fundraising and petitioning in
order to cover the expenses of competition, including choreog
raphy and uniforms.
ITiis underappreciated team, however, took everyone by sur
prise when it placed third in finals at the United Spirit Associa
tion Collegiate Nationals this February.
The team has come a long way since its inception in 2(X)2. At
first, it was composed mainly of students who had little to no
cheerleading experience. Vern Taylor — one of the team's found
ing members — had only one year of cheerleading in high school.
"I was excited because the program was just starting and 1
could build it from the ground up." said Taylor, now a grad stu
dent. "But I had to take gymnastics classes at Stanford to get
more experience in tumbling."

So how exactly did this team go from a ragtag group of begin
ners to placing third in a national competition?
"The skill level of the team has come a long way and is a tes
tament to the team's dedication and hard work," said Sarita
Perez, captain of the cheerleading team.
In addition to performing at games, the team holds two hour
practices two to three times each week. This rigorous schedule
lasts all year long, as the members cheer for football and basket

ball, while still preparing for competitions of their own. On top
of scheduled practices, many take recreational gymnastics class
es to improve their tumbling skills.
"Our team loves this sport" said Perez. "We're going in a
new direction that is very positive and energetic — it's really in
fused the team with new spirit."
Stanford Cheer, though formed as a student group, is now in
the process of transitioning into a club sport. The team was final
ly given a chanee to prove how far it has come at the United
Spirit Association Collegiate National's competition.
After competing against eight other teams in the small co-ed
division, the team moved on to the finals where it took third —
a great achievement for any team, especially one whose cheer
leaders had little prior experience.
Despite these improvements, the team has still struggled to
find funding. Cheer is considered a non-varsity sport; as such,
Stanford Cheer receives financial support from neither the ath
letic department nor alumni. Instead, the team must rely on
fundraising and special fees to pay for expenses.
"We're working toward getting funded by the athletic de
partment and being recognized as an athletic program," said
Perez.
In the meantime, practices will be business as usual — except
for the addition of one very large trophy.
