GREAT NEW COURSES FOR
SPRING QUARTER 08?
African and Alrican American Studies (AAAS) would like to highlight three new courses
this Spring, all of which may also count towards either a major or minor in AAAS
AFRICAAM 1 OS: Introduction to African and African American Studies
Mark Sawyer (5 units), MW 12:35-2:05
Building 60, room 120
This course fulfills a mandatory requirement for both AAAS Majors and Minors, as
well its the American Cultures GER.
The African-American experience spans four hundred years, from the initial settlement of the American continent
by Europeans and the establishment of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and down through the present day. African
Americans have engaged in incredible acts of self-making in the context of tremendous obstacles. However, there is
no singular African American Experience. This introductory course in the African-American experience is con
structed around the cultural, political, economic and social life of African Americans. We will also consider the
importance of issues of gender, sexuality and nationality as we explore the diversity of black experiences. Through
the course lectures, required readings and discussions, hopefully students will acquire a fuller understanding
about the historical development and social construction of black America: what African Americans have thought
about themselves and the larger society, how they have evolved as a community with a distinct culture from slavery
to the twenty-first century, and where they may be going as a people.
