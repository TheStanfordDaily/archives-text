## Teenagers improve writing 
### NANCY ZUCKERBROD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
More and more middle- and
high-school students understand
the basics of writing, hut there's
been no increase in the ranks of
top-performing teenage writers.
The federal government
released the scores Thursday of
writing tests given to eighth- and
12th-graders nationwide last year.
Students had to demonstrate narra
tive, informative and persuasive
writing skills.
As in the past, girls did much
better than boys at both grade lev
els. Eighth-grade English teacher
Amanda Avallone, a member of the
board that administers the national
test, said the gender gap "troubles
and mystifies" her.
"Nothing in my experience tells
me that boys can't write," said
Avallone, of Boulder, Colo. She
said expectations appear to be
lower for boys when it comes to
writing.
Overall, eighth-grade scores
rose modestly from the last time
the test, known as the Nation's
Report Card, was given in 2002.
The proportion of kids scoring
at or above the basic level rose
from 85 percent to 88 percent. At
that level, students show they can
use grammar, spelling and punctua
tion that are accurate enough to
communicate to a reader, but there
may be mistakes in their work that
get in the way of its meaning.
The percentage of eighth-
graders at or above the proficient
level — which policy makers call
the goal — was unchanged from
five years earlier. About a third of
eighth graders achieved the "profi
cient" label.
If there are errors in the writing
of an eighth-grader working at the
proficient level, they're not serious
enough to get in the way of the
work's meaning.
State and federal efforts to
improve education have focused
intensely on poorly performing
students in recent years said
Michael Petrilli, vice president at
Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a
Washington-based education think
tank. He said the trend helps
explain why more kids can now
handle basic writing, while there's
been no growth in the percent of
top achievers.
"It's good news that the lowest
achieving kids are seeing some
gains." he said. "The problem is in
a competitive world we need to
pay attention to all of our kids,
including those at the top."
