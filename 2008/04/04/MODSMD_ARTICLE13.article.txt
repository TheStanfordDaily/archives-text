## Eating disorder treatments expand Youth program now avilable for undergrads 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
During the ten years that Naomi
Brown. Ph.D., has served as an eat
ing disorders treatment specialist at
Stanford's Vaden Health Center, she
said that she has never witnessed a
shortage of students affected by eat
ing disorders.
"As years have gone by, we are
seeing students with much more
severe symptoms," Brown said.
Vaden offers a comprehensive
eating disorders program with a
team of multidisciplinary health
care professionals that make recom

mendations to the level of treatment
that would be most helpful to the
patient.
In the past, patients that required
a level of care that exceeded the out
patient services offered at Vaden
were referred to an outside program.
Now. undergraduates have
another option. The Comprehensive
Eating Disorders Program at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital is
expanding to treat young adults ages
18 to 21, partly in response to the
growing need on campus for more
specialized care. The recent expan
sion of the Packard program opens
the facility to the Stanford under
graduate community.
"It was pretty clear that there
were a lot of problems on campus
with eating disorders," said James
Lock, Professor of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences at Packard

Children's Hospital. "These were
clear needs that we were trying to
meet."
Therapies are tailored at Packard
to the specific family dilemma, age
and circumstance of each patient.
Lock said. Treatment also frequently
involves utilizing the support of the
family.
"For a long time, parents were
blamed for their children's anorex
ia," Lock said. "But the evidence is
against that. This treatment radically
shifts that perspective."
Undergraduates with family
residing outside the Bay Area will
be treated on a case-by-case basis,
Lock said. It is not yet clear whether
Cardinal Care will cover the
Packard program.
