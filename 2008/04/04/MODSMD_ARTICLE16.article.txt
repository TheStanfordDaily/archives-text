In the headline of yesterday's arti
cle about SAT Subject Tests, The
Daily inaccurately stated that
Stanford still requires the tests for
admission. As stated in the article.
Stanford did not formally require
the tests for admission in the past,
and it will continue to use the same
policy. If a student chooses to
include the test scores in an applica
tion, the University will continue to
use the tests as one of many factors
in determining admission.
