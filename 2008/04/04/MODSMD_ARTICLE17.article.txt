## Editorial Board Aim high with public service 
### 
Stanford students are no strangers to
public service. Whether through reli
gious organizations, volunteer clubs or
honor societies, most of us have performed
community service in the past. For some, it
was simply a stepping stone toward college
admission.but Stanford's general population
continually performs an enormous amount
of tutoring, mentoring, volunteering and
fundraising for charitable causes. While Stan
ford currently has a powerful public service
community, we wish to encourage more stu
dents to get involved and those who are al
ready participating to consider public service
as more than a token extracurricular activity.
Volunteering can and should be about more
than simply making yourself look good.
First of all. volunteering is so prevalent
across majors, interests and financial back
grounds because it really does go beyond re
sume padding.To be sure, there is a fair num
ber of students with eyes on graduate school
and jobs, but extracurriculars like communi
ty service tend to be less important than ac
ademics on these applications, lliere is
something motivating people beyond the
stature gained by volunteering, and, if it's
not motivating you, you should consider
what is. Simply ask a friend working with one
of the plethora of campus groups trying to
help people in settings that range from local
to international. Participation in service ac
tivities can be one of the most rewarding
parts of the college environment and can
provide a valuable perspective for future de
cisions.
As an "elite" university, we are continual

ly hearing about all of the advantages our
school provides. Hut the same qualities like
extremely competitive admissions and moti
vated students that draw investment bank
ing recruiters in hordes give us powerful
leverage for public service. We have the abil
ity to work with some of the best students in
the country and share ideas, resources and
manpower.
Additionally, the 1 laas Center for Public
Service is a resource that is secret to none.
Whether you want to work on campus, in
Fast Palo Alto, or Nepal, the Haas center
can help provide information, advice and
sometimes even funding. 'ITie staff draws on
years of experience in community-based
work and has helped launch student groups
into influential international organizations.
No matter what your field of study or per
sonal interest. 1 laas can provide excellent in
formation about how to use your skills for a
greater good.
Author James Baldwin wrote, "Not
everything that is faced can be changed, but
nothing can be changed until it is faced." We
are proud to attend a university with stu
dents so committed to tackling tough issues
through public service, but there is always
room for improvement. Think hard about
what you want to take away from Stanford.
A few years down the road you might re
member a great party or a crazy night with
friends, but the memories of the people you
help will likely last much longer.
