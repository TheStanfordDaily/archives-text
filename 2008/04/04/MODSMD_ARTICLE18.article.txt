## Preserving Stanford's architectural style 
### 
The natural landscape, climate and ar
chitecture of a location come together
to produce a sense of place — letting
you know that you're in Las Vegas versus
downtown Palo Alto. So what clues you in to
the fact that you're at Stanford and not some
other university? Even more, does anything
about the Stanford campus let you know it's
a prestigious university?
1 would say that most reputable universi
ties have distinctive, inspiring buildings in
terspersed with well-kept grounds. You
don't need jaw-dropping buildings at every
corner, but it seems a university can only be
as prestigious as its buildings proclaim. Stan
ford has done pretty well on this account
it has preserved the outsidesof old buildings
like the Quad while stylishly renovating the
inside or putting up cool, architecturally for
ward-thinking buildings like the Clark Cen
ter. Old Union is pretty nice as well.
But a lot of Stanford is made up of. or is
currently constructed with, uninspiring, low
key structures. It's important to maintain
some sense of style lest a place degenerates
into an anonymous mass. Think about the
engineering buildings around I lewlett or
next to the Quad — they look like a corpo
rate office park and evoke as much feeling as
one. There is a temptation to build fast and
cheap, and I could easily see the rest of Stan
ford turning into the same, uninspiring rows
of rectangles. What's going to replace Meyer
when it's torn down, a similarly grand build
ing, or some non-offending blocky struc
ture? Contrast this to Mi l' where they put

up (his great, funky building called the Stata
Center — you'll definitely never forget that
you're at MIT.
Want to know where Stanford really goes
cheap on its architecture? The dorms. Yes.
college is about being ghetto, but the goal
isn't to recreate it. Cramped, old and ugly,
the dorms at Stanford don't add flavor.Take
the relatively new Rains Dormitory. It looks
okay from the outside, but inside it's literal
ly like low-income housing, and I know be
cause I've lived in low-income housing. 1
don't even think Rains is earthquake-safe.
The saddest thing about all of it is that we
pay more than $40K a year and that Stan
ford has a $20 billion endowment.The liter
al foundations of the campus are the last
place a school should cut corners. A few mil
lion extra could produce some decent build
ings that won't fall down in an earthquake.
A school's soul lies in its campus, and
world-class universities should maintain
world-class campuses. I lere's to Stanford
looking stylish and sexy.

Ziv's dream campus would be a re-creation of
Caesar 's Palace. Email your ideas to dirtycal
