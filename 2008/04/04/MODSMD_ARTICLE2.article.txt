# MEN'S TENNIS
## Streaking Cardinal face L.A. test No. 4 UCLA, No. 5 USC await Stanford 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Over two months ago, the Stanford
men's tennis team dropped two match
es to USC and UCLA en route to an 0-
4 start to its season.
Part of that can be attributed to the
brutally tough schedule Stanford had.
with those four losses coming to teams
currently ranked among the top 15
teams in the nation. But as the many
sports adages go, it is good to play the
best. That is exactly how the team feels
and its results have shown it: the Cardi
nal has gone 8-2 since the rough start
and has the look of a different, more
confident team.
They enter the Los Angeles road trip
with an 8-6 record and a 2-0 mark in
Pac-10 play. They have won three
straight matches and eight of the last
ten. They avenged a tough 4-3 loss to
No. 15 Arizona State in early March
with a dominating 7-0 victory last week,
and they have won four out of the last
five doubles points.To top it all off. they
are ranked No. 25 in the latest ITA rank
ings. the highest mark for the team in
over a year.
Junior Matt Bruch was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week after outstanding
performances in the last three matches.
Bruch went 6-0 over that span, including
three wins with newly reunited partner
Blake Muller at No. 1 doubles.
"Matt is a great doubles player and 1
feel very comfortable playing with
him," Muller said. "Even after trying
new combinations and not playing with
him for a couple of months we have
clicked right away. It feels like we are
starting right where we left off."
Bruch is ranked No. 67, teammate
Richard Wire is ranked No. 95 and
freshman Alex Clayton leads the way as
the No. 2 ranked player in the country.
On Friday, the Cardinal will take on
No. 5 USC, who handed Stanford a 5-1
loss earlier this year. The Trojans have
four ranked players in their lineup
Robert Farah at No. 7, Kaes Van't Hof at No. 34,
No. 53 Gary Sacks and No. 87 Jaak Poldma.
Farah and Van't Hof are also the No. 2 doubles
team in the nation. In the last meeting, Clayton
beat Farah at No. 1 singles: the two will likely
meet again in a highly anticipated match. USC
is 15-3 on the season and is also 2-0 in Pac-10
p!ay.
On Saturday, Stanford will face UCLA, rhe
No. 4 Bruins are 15-1 on the season, with their
lone loss coming at the hands of No. 1 Virginia.
The Bruins also feature four ranked players in
their lineup: No. 23 Mathieu Dehaine, No. 38
Harel Srugo, No. 45 Holden Seguso and No. 114
Haythem Abid. UCLA beat Stanford 5-2 back
in February, even though the Cardinal won the
doubles point.
"There is no doubt that these matches are
going to be tough," said Muller. "It is a difficult
environment against two great teams. 1 think
the key for us is to continue playing with confi
dence and go down there and compete."
The team knows they face a tough challenge
but feels this is the time when the opening part
of the schedule will start to pay off.
"We are all playing well," Muller said. "And
if we play the way we are capable of playing and
compete hard there is no reason we can't come
out of there with two wins."
The action starts Friday at 1:30 p.m. when the
Cardinal takes on USC. Play continues on Sat
urday in Westwood, Calif, where Stanford will
play UCLA at 1:30 p.m.
