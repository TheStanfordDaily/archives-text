## Never talk to strangers 
### 
I can hear the Led Zeppelin blaring from
someone else's headphones.They're posi
tioned squarely on the ears of a guy with
whom 1 happen to be sharing an elevator.
Dazed and confused, for so long it's not true .
.. the headphones carry on a one-way con
versation.Hie elevator rises to floor W3, then
tloor 2, W5, floor 3 and all the way up to floor
5. Not a word is spoken. We exit and go our
separate ways.
I enter the Bender Room of Green Li
brary to find that literally everyone else is
wearing headphones. ITiis is to be expected
— this is a place to study, a place where you
need to establish your own peaceful and quiet
world, where you need to block everything
and everyone out so you can get work done.
But when I exit the library, it's more of the
same: headphones, i Pods, isolated worlds.
There was a point in my life when I real
ized that the whole "never talk to strangers"
thing only applies to likely pedophiles.
Around my tenth birthday. I discovered that
there can be no real harm in talking to
strangers, assuming they do not have a crus
tache (a crusty mustache to the uninitiated)
or large tinted glasses. In fact, talking to
strangers is necessary sometimes, and often
beneficial. You can learn things and meet
people.
But it seems, these days, people take this
phrase entirely too literally. When I see some
one walking around with iPod headphones
dangling out of his ears, I can generally as
sume that this person does not want to talk to
me. For that matter, it seems he doesn't want

to talk to anyone. His headphones say loudly
that right now he chooses social seclusion
over human contact.
My only conclusion is this: it has become
socially acceptable to be anti-social. This is
the only conclusion 1 can arrive at, consider
ing the alternatives. For one, it just can't be the
case that the music is so good that he has to
listen to it right then and there. 1 get my Zep
pelin cravings as much as the next guy, but
never do I feel that if 1 don't listen to it right
now 1 will explode. It also can't be the case
that Led Zeppelin perfectly fits this current
instant, in the elevator. And, even if the song
did happen to exactly fit his mood at that
given instant, is it necessary to play it at the
exclusion of the world around you?
The problem with headphones is that they
create "your world.""Oh. he's caught up in his
own world, " people say. But it seems that
these headphone-clad students are blind to
the fact that "my world" and "your world"
might very well be the same thing.
It's not just headphones.Text messaging is
just as bad. It is glorified anti-social behavior
in its cleanest incarnation. Cleanest because
you're still "communicating." But how often

have you heard "you don't have to call, just
send a text message?" Text messaging is an
excuse to avoid the awkward reality that is
voice-to-voice communication.
Add to this the escapist element of text
messaging — you don't ever have to mental
ly be in the room that your body actually oc
cupies. The moment you have to actually in
teract with other, physical beings, you can
take out your cell phone and start sending
messages to other people, in other places!
As the phone has reduced the burden of
speaking face-to-face, so the text message has
reduced the burden of speaking voice-to
voice. At some point, text messages them
selves will become too personal, and we'll
need random text generators to take away the
idea that you have to interact with a human
being at all.
I love technology, don't get me wrong. I
am. after all, a symbolic systems major. In
deed, one of the central questions in symbol
ic systems is how you know you're actually
talking to a human being and not a highly in
telligent robot. But I don't want to have to
ponder this philosophical query every time a
friend with headphones in is deaf to my greet
ings, or 1 get "stranded" in the same room with
someone overly dependent on a cell phone.
Led Zeppelin can wait.The world around
you cannot.

Nat's iPod broke last week, but even when it
was working, he used it tastefully. He cannot re
ceive text messages. He can, however, get emails
at nat.hillard@stanford. edu.
