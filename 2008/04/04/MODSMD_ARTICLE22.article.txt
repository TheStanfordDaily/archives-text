## Why QSA endorsements matter 
### 
Stanford's Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA) is a coalition of queer, ques
tioning and allied students dedicated
to creating open social spaces on campus
and encouraging political activism for the
attainment of queer rights. I"his year we
have concentrated on responding to and
preventing acts of intolerance; making
progress to provide the option of gender
neutral housing;and promoting the visibil
ity of lesbian, gay bisexual and transgen
der issues.
These are not, however, solely queer is
sues— they are Stanford issues. Promot
ing all forms of personal expression and
identity is a Stanford value. As members of
the Stanford community and of
Queer/Straight Alliance, we support di

versity, acceptance and understanding. By
responding to homophobia, we encourage
a community that fosters these ideals from
which all students of Stanford will benefit.
Iliis has been a mixed year for the
queer/allied community: while progress
was made in gender-neutral housing, there
are also increased concerns regarding acts
of intolerance. QSA took these into con
sideration and trusts that the candidates
we are endorsing will make significant
contributions to the queer/allied commu
nity.
In order to best assess candidates seek
ing our endorsement, we hosted very in
tensive interviews that spanned over 4
meetings including hour-long group inter
views lor ASSU Senate Candidates and

half-hour individual interviews for ASSU
Executive Slates. We only interviewed
candidates and slates that twk the initia
tive to approach us for the QSA endorse
ment. In total, we interviewed 12 ASSU
Senate Candidates and 3 ASSU Executive
Slates.
We arrived at our decisions after a very
thorough process, in which we evaluated
their understanding of and commitment
to the following:
1. Gender-Neutral/Blind Housing
2. Response to and Prevention of Acts of
Intolerance
3. Previous and current involvement in
promoting a Queer-friendly campus
While we laud every ASSU candidate
who sought our endorsement for support

ing QSA values, we have selected candi
dates who we feel have the most thorough
understanding of our mission and who we
believe are most committed to carrying
out that mission if elected. Our decision to
endorse six ASSU Senate candidates as
well as one ASSU Executive Slate comes
out of a desire to promote the interests and
safety of minority students on campus.
Ciiven that this was a very trying year
for the queer community we feel that
QSA's endorsement is especially salient.
We trust and support our endorsements
whole-heartedly and hope that you keep
them in mind when casting your ballots.
