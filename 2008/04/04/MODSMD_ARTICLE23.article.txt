As the Coordinator of the
HPAC/Peer Mentoring pro
grams, I'm writing to offer the
good news that the HPAC pro
gram will exist next year just the
same as it does this year, and we
are on schedule to recruit a new
team of I1 PACs for 2008-09.This
year's MPACs have supported
Faculty Advisors. Resident Fel
lows, UAR Academic Directors
and Dorm Liaisons, all of whom
offer academic advising to un
dergraduates. Any student with
an academic concern or issue
may contact residence staff, in
cluding HPACs, for a referral to

an Academic Director (Wilbur,
Stern, Florence Moore, Toyon.
the ARC in Arrillaga), a Dorm
Liaison or an advisor in Under
graduate Advising and Re
search (Sweet Hall, Ist floor,
723-2426 for an appointment).
Undergraduates who are in
terested in serving as an HPAC
next year are directed to the web
site (https://rescomp.stanford.
edu/resjobs) for a full job de
scription. compensation details
and online application. The
deadline for applying is April 6,
