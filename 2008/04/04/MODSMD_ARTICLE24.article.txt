## SOFTBALL DIGS IN Stanford seeks first Pac-10 wins on road trip 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team will go on the
road again this weekend, trying to notch its first
win of the Pacific-10 Conference season at
UCLA and Washington.
I"he Cardinal (33-5, 0-3 Pac-10) got off to a
rough start in the conference with a home series
against the Arizona schools last week, losing once
to No. 8 Arizona before getting shut out twice in
a row against No. I Arizona State, including a bru
tal 13-inning loss in the series finale.
Stanford did. however, get the chance to show
what it could do in a 3-0 victory over Sacramento
State on Wednesday. Junior shortstop Maddy
Coon went 2-for-2 with a triple and a home run,
driving in all three of the Cardinal's runs on the
day, while junior pitcher Missy Penna (22-4)
pitched six innings of two-hit ball for the win.
As it was last year, the Cardinal is led on of
fense by center fielder Alissa I laber, now a soph
omore. 1 laber leads off the Stanford lineup with
a team-high .397 batting average and has 10 dou
bles, also tops for the squad. Sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill, however, has taken over the primary
run-producing responsibility for the Cardinal,
with 15 home runs and 42 RBIs already this sea
son.
Neill already has almost twice as many
homers as last year's leader and is only two RBIs
behind Michelle Smith's team-leading 44 RBIs
from last season.
Up against tough pitching from Arizona. Stan
ford has only 17 hits in its last 1 Hi at-bats. a lowly
.147 rate on offense. It has been almost two weeks
since the Cardinal last scored more than three
runs in a game, in a 9-0 demolition of East Caroli
na. But the pitching has been stellar. Penna. the

staff ace, has allowed just four earned runs in her
past 27 innings, with 27 strikeouts and only six
walks along the way.
UCLA is up first for Stanford on its odd
SoCal-to-Pacific Northwest road swing.The Bru
ins (39-2,3-0 Pac-10) are at the top of the confer
ence alongside Arizona State, boasting the best
pitching in the Pac-10 and the second-best team
batting average. UCLA's pitching staff has a 0.64
ERA, almost half that of the next-closest Pac-10
team, Stanford.
Washington presents a more manageable
challenge for the Cardinal, as the 1 luskies are in
the bottom half of the league in both run-scoring
and run defense. Still. Washington (22-10-1. 1-1
Pac-10) has one of the best all-around hitters in
the conference in freshman third baseman Jace
Williams, who is hitting .419 so far with seven
doubles and five home runs.
The Cardinal will face UCLA in Los Angeles
this afternoon at 1 p.m. before immediately turn
ing around and heading north to face Washington
at 3 p.m. and 12 p.m on Saturday and Sunday, re
spectively.
