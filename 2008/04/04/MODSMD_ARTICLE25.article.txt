## Track and field to host Stanford Invitational 
### 
Cobb Track and Angel Field will be home to
the 34th annual Stanford Invitational today and
tomorrow. The Stanford Invitational is one of
the biggest and most highly-anticipated track
meets on the West Coast, featuring some of the
best collegiate and high school athletes from
around the nation.
Last year, 316 athletes achieved regional
qualifying marks at the meet, 15 of those being
Stanford athletes. Graeme Hoste was the only
event winner for the Cardinal, capturing the
title in the pole vault with a vault of 16-9. The
Stanford track and field program enters the
meet ranked nationally by the United States
Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches As
sociation. The women are ranked tenth, while
the men stand at No. 22.
But first, the athletes that compete in the
heptathlon (for women) and decathlon (for
men) are currently in Berkeley to compete in
the Cal Multi Event meet.
After the first day of competition, Stanford's
Whitney Liehr stands in second place for the
women's heptathlon, while teammate Kara
Bennett is currently in fourth place. For the
men, freshman Corey Dysick stands in fifth
place.
Liehr, Bennett and Dysick will continue
their competitions tomorrow.
