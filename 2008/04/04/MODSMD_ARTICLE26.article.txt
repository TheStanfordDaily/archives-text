# Cardinal tries to regain momentum
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team has
much to prove going into the weekend, when
they play UC-San Diego (9-15,5-13 MPSF)
and No. 4 Long Beach State (19-5, 14-4
MPSF).
The Cardinal (14-9,9-9 MPSF) is coming
off a rough weekend, having lost against No. 5
Pepperdine (30-22,30-27.31-29) and I JSC' (30-
26,30-21,30-19) and dropping to No. 8 in the
national rankings.
"We were a little out of sync and we ran
into two teams that were playing very well,"
said head coach John Kosty of the losses. "You
just have to be on your game every game to
compete in this league."
Prior to the losses, the Cardinal had been
on a roll. In late February, the team defeated
then-No. 1 Brigham Young University 3-0 (35-
33,30-22,31 -29), handing the then-undefeated
Cougars their first defeat of the season. Ihe
Cardinal went on to sweep the Hawai'i Rain
bow Warriors with two consecutive wins, 3-2
(26-30,30-26,30-25,28-30,16-14) and 3-0 (30-
22,30-23,30-25).
Sophomore Evan Romero was named
AVCA Player of the Week and MPSF Co-
Player of the Week from February 28-March 3
for his performance in those games. Against
Hawai'i. he had a total of 49 kills at an average
hitting percentage of nearly .500.
On March 10, after winning five of six contests,
the Cardinal rose to No. 6 in the CSTV/AVCA
poll. The men remained at No. 6 until this
week, when the pair of weekend losses
dropped them to No. 8.
The standings are fairly close, however,
with No. 7 UCLA ahead by just one game and
about a dozen points. No. 6 Ball State is ahead
by three games and less than 25 points. The
Cardinal defeated Ball State 3-2 (28-30,25-30,
30-22,31-29,15-11) when the two faced off in
early February.
Stanford has a number of strengths which
could boost the team down the stretch run of
its season. Romero has consistently delivered
on offense while freshman Spencer McLach
lin has provided a much needed boost in kills.
Senior Matt Ceran has contributed years of
experience, excelling at all positions on the
court.
ITie team is also starting to step up on two
other aspects of the game. "Right now we're
very consistent in our sideout game," said

Kosty."Our serve reception is starting to peak,
and so is our serving game."
Coming up on the end of the season,
Romero leads the Cardinal with 358 kills, just
26 kills shy of his record last season. Three

other Cardinal hitters have accumulated more
than 1(X) kills: senior Matt Ceran is at 256.
freshman Spencer McLachlin is at 180 and
junior Brandon Williams is at 101. Sophomore
Kawika Shoji has racked up 7 l )8 assists.

GAME NOTES The No. 8 volleyball team will take on
No. 4 Long Beach State on Saturday after facing the
Tritons today. The men are currently 14-9 overall and
9-9 in MPSF play, already accounting for their best
season in years. Next week's matches against UCLA
and UC-lrvine will mark the end of the regular season
for the Cardinal.
"Both outside hitters [Ceran and McLach
lin] and Evan (Romero] — our three players
who receive most of our point-scoring oppor
tunities — have had a good season, and they
continue to get better every practice and every
game," kosty explained. " Iliat's a great sign
for us down the stretch."
On defense, Shoji leads the team in digs at
163. Freshman Jordan 1 nafuku isn't far behind
with 153. Ceran and Romero have contributed
on defense as well, with 143 and 122 digs, re
spectively.
As for the Cardinal's competition this
weekend, the UC San Diego Tritons are 5-13
in MPSF play, but are coming off a couple of
big wins and seem to be gaining momentum.
Last weekend, they upset No. 7 UCI .A 3-2 (26-
30,30-25,32-30,31-33,15-9) forthefirst time in
school history. The next day, the Tritons round
ed out their weekend with a victory over de
fending national champion UC-lrvine. 3-2
(33-31.25-30,24-30,30-25,15-11).
Stanford's Saturday opponent, Long
Beach State, has done well the entire season,
most recently sweeping BYI I in two matches,
3-0 (30-23.30-28,30-27) and 3-1 (30-25,30-26,
28-30,30-24). In the second match, four 49ers
posted double-digit kills. On the season, four
49ers have accumulated well over 100 kills:
Paul Lotman is at 498, Dean Bittner at 409,
Dan Alexander has 234 while Fletcher Ander
son boasts 111.

Stanford hopes to rebound from a series of losses last weekend to No. 5 Pepperdine and USC
when it suits up against MPSF conference foes UC-San Diego, who it will face tonight at
Maples, and No. 4 Long Beach State, who it will take on later in the weekend.
The Cardinal has four games left to
play, and their results in the coming
games will have important seeding
implications — it may even decide
whether the team is seeded at all when
it comes to postseason play.
Kosty doesn't seem worried, how
ever.
"The guys we have on the floor
right now, they come from winning
programs," he said. "We have guys
who have played big matches, who
have won state championships. They
know how to win. And that's some
thing that's very difficult to teach."
