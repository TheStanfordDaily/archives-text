## Stanford looks to continue dominance on home court 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
TWenty-one straight conference titles.
101 consecutive regular season home dual
matches and 127 contests played on the
Farm.
In nearly a full decade, the No. 5 Stanford
women's tennis team has been infallible at
home.

With a surprising four-loss season and
No. 8 Southern California and No. 9 UCLA
coming to town, these streaks certainly seem
in jeopardy, though that doesn't seem to
bother the Cardinal.
"I certainly hope nobody's focused on
that." head coach Lele Forood said. "I can't
answer for everybody else, but that has
nothing to do with what we're talking or
thinking about. We just want to get a little

more consistent with our level of play and
we've had some really good matches lately."
"Right now we're focused on reaching a
good level of play consistently and we're
practicing very well this week so I have a
good feeling about this." Forood added.
If it's any consolation, all four losses have
come on the road, most of them 4-3 deci
sions. Additionally, five of their last six
matches are on the Farm.

"There's a comfort level to playing at
home clearly, but mostly we're very familiar
with the conditions at home and the courts
we play on," Forood said. "We've had some
different conditions — Arizona is very dif
ferent to play in. And so you just play the el
ements when you go on the road and tennis
you play outdoors, which can affect
an awful lot."
Earlier this season, Stanford left
its Southern California roadtrip with
a split against the two schools.
Fortunately for the Card, the
matches did not count toward the
Pac-10 standings.
On Friday, the Women of Troy will
try to overthrow the perennial Pac
-10 leaders.
USC will attempt to avenge a close 4-
3 loss to the Cardinal women back in
early March. Since then, USC
has gone 6-1, vaulting ahead of
UCLA in the ITA rankings.
I"he next day, the Bruins come
into town looking for a Cardinal
sweep on the year. UCLA has won
the last two meetings, including a 4-2
victory over the Card in the national
semifinal last May.
"Every time, especially if you're
losing 4-3, the immediate thing to
work on is the doubles," Forood said.
"We lost the doubles point at UCLA,
so that's the first thing any team will
spend a lot of time on.That's certain
ly one area, and we want to be more
consistent — we have more players
who can win their singles matches
and we just need to do it on the same
day."
Though consistency as a whole
has been difficult to find, freshman
Hilary Barte has thrived at the No. 1
spot.
Since being thrust into the spot
light. Barte has responded incredibly
well with an 11-match win streak.
She is now 19-5 overall. 10-1 against
Pac-10 opponents and 12-3 against
nationally-ranked opponents.
"Hilary obviously has done quite
well." Forood said. "We've had num
ber ones who were freshmen who
have had very good runs — she's the
third one in this decade so far after
Marissa lrvin and Amber Liu. It's
certainly been done before but she's
done a tremendous job on focusing
on her matches and bringing what

been victim to a tew surprising losses,
the team must remain focused agains
she can [to] each and every one of
her matches."
As a testament to the strength of
the conference, the top-four teams
are ranked all within the top-10 pro
grams in the nation.
"I think they're both very good
teams, but it's a tough Pac-10."
Forood said of (JSC and UCLA.
" ITiere have been a lot of teams
beating each other so far. I think the
conference will show up very big at
the NCAA tournament as usual."

portant any more for Stanford.
"It's not a stated goal of ours right
now to win a conference title, though
it's nice to do so," Forood said. "But
it's not something we're looking at
right now. The most critical thing is
playing well as a group and things
will take care of themselves if we do
that."
And if things fall into place for the
Card, sacrificing a conference title is
indeed a small price to pay.
