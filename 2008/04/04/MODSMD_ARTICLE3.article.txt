# The 						Final Step
## No. 2 Stanford TO TAKE ON No. 1 UConn IN Final Four 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has danced all the way to Tampa, but in order to keep its
Final Four run going, the second-seeded Cardinal will have to knock off
No. 1 Connecticut, arguably the best team in the country.
But no team is hotter than Stanford, who carries a nation-best 22-
game winning streak into the semifinal game against the Huskies. When
the two squads tip off on Sunday, it will be exactly three months since the
Cardinal last lost.
Still, Connecticut poses a mighty task forTara VanDerveer's squad,
who fell to the Huskies 66-54 at the Paradise Jam on Nov. 22. Connecti
cut took an early lead in that contest, and the Cardinal was never able to
claw its way back.
Maya Moore, the Huskies' star who on Tuesday became just the sec
ond freshman to earn All-American honors, led all
scorers with Ipoints, most of which came during a
23-6 run during which the 1 luskies outran,outshot
and outrebounded the Cardinal. She leads a very
athletic Connecticut team that will seek to control
and utilize a faster tempo on both sides of the

floor.

NOTES

■ Cardinal's transition game has de
hroughout the season, as they have
; to outrun teams on offense and hus
tle back on defense. Junior for
ward Jillian Harmon and fresh
man guard Jeanette Pohlen have
been especially proficient in this
regard. Even if the Huskies main
tain power over the pace of the
game. Stanford will be in better
position to compete than they
were five months ago.
The Cardinal, though, will
not relinquish control of the game
so quickly — they'll look to set up
their offense through senior guard
Candice Wiggins and sophomore
center Jayne Appel. With the ex
ception of the Sweet 16 game
against Pitt, Wiggins has been on a
historic tear during the NCAA
Tournament, scoring 40 points
twice — she is the only player in
NCAA history to do that and just
the fifth to score over 40 points in
a tournament game. Her latest
performance, a 41-point effort
against Maryland, led Stanford to
its first Final Four in 11 years.
But Wiggins is hardly the
sole reason behind the success —
the team is finding contributions
from a variety of sources. Appel


Stanford's game with UConn will be a rematch
of the Nov. 22 meeting between the teams,
where the Huskies came away with a 66-54
victory at the Paradise Jam tournament held in
the U.S. Virgin Islands. The team will be led by
the trio of senior guard Candice Wiggins,
freshman forward Kayla Pedersen and sopho
more post Jayne Appel. Wiggins was named
the MVP of the Spokane Regional while Peder
sen and Appel were named to the All-Region
team.

has been equally hot throughout the
tournament, scoring 20 points in
three of the Cardinal's four games,
including a career-high 33 points
against Portland State in the first
round.
Freshman forward Kayla Peder
sen is averaging close to 12 points a
game in the NCAAs for the Cardi
nal, and sophomore guard J J Hones
netted a career-high 23 points against
Maryland.

"They really play
hard for each
other. It's really
special"
— TARAVANDERVEER
Head Coach

The cohesiveness and total team
effort has drawn the praise of Van-
Derveer.
"We did it with I think everyone
really contributing, willing to do
whatever it takes," she said. "I'm re
ally proud of our team. I think that
through the whole NCAA tourna
ment so far they have really respond
ed to the challenge."
This trend will have to continue
against the Huskies, who boast a
complete team of their own. Besides
Moore. Connecticut features threats
in Renee Montgomery. Ketia
Swanier and Brittany Hunter. Tina
Charles adds instant offense off the
bench. Not only will the Cardinal's
defense need to hold, but the offense
must be on its game as well.
Redshirt sophomore point guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude will be
charged with leading both attacks —
her shut-down defense will be the
first line of resistance against the
Huskies, and her deft passing will

help the Cardinal set the offensive
tone. Gold-Onwude is emblematic of
a deep Stanford team whose contri
butions don't necessarily show up in
the box score but add to the entire
formula needed to succeed.
"They really play hard for each
other," said VanDerveer. "It's really
special."
The Final Four trip has been a long
time coming for Stanford and Wig
gins in particular, who. in her senior
season, was finally able to make it to
the promised land. Her thoughts
went back to her freshman season
three years ago. when the Cardinal

fell to Michigan State in the Elite
Eight — a result that has motivated
her since.
"I just thought about my fresh
man year at Michigan State," she
said. "They were celebrating and
dancing and 1 was just like, gosh. I
just want to dance like that, just be
excited and go to the Final Four with
my team. And I kind of had that
image in my head before the game
started. And sure enough, we were
all out here dancing."
