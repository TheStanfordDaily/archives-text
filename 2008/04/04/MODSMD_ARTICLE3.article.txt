## No. 2 Stanford TO TAKE ON No. 1 UConn IN Final Four 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has danced all the way to Tampa, but in order to keep its
Final Four run going, the second-seeded Cardinal will have to knock off
No. 1 Connecticut, arguably the best team in the country.
But no team is hotter than Stanford, who carries a nation-best 22-
game winning streak into the semifinal game against the Huskies. When
the two squads tip off on Sunday, it will be exactly three months since the
Cardinal last lost.
Still, Connecticut poses a mighty task forTara VanDerveer's squad,
who fell to the Huskies 66-54 at the Paradise Jam on Nov. 22. Connecti
cut took an early lead in that contest, and the Cardinal was never able to
claw its way back.
Maya Moore, the Huskies' star who on Tuesday became just the sec
ond freshman to earn All-American honors, led all
scorers with Ipoints, most of which came during a
23-6 run during which the 1 luskies outran,outshot
and outrebounded the Cardinal. She leads a very
athletic Connecticut team that will seek to control
and utilize a faster tempo on both sides of the

floor.

NOTES

■ Cardinal's transition game has de
hroughout the season, as they have
; to outrun teams on offense and hus
tle back on defense. Junior for
ward Jillian Harmon and fresh
man guard Jeanette Pohlen have
been especially proficient in this
regard. Even if the Huskies main
tain power over the pace of the
game. Stanford will be in better
position to compete than they
were five months ago.
The Cardinal, though, will
not relinquish control of the game
so quickly — they'll look to set up
their offense through senior guard
Candice Wiggins and sophomore
center Jayne Appel. With the ex
ception of the Sweet 16 game
against Pitt, Wiggins has been on a
historic tear during the NCAA
Tournament, scoring 40 points
twice — she is the only player in
NCAA history to do that and just
the fifth to score over 40 points in
a tournament game. Her latest
performance, a 41-point effort
against Maryland, led Stanford to
its first Final Four in 11 years.
But Wiggins is hardly the
sole reason behind the success —
the team is finding contributions
from a variety of sources. Appel


Stanford's game with UConn will be a rematch
of the Nov. 22 meeting between the teams,
where the Huskies came away with a 66-54
victory at the Paradise Jam tournament held in
the U.S. Virgin Islands. The team will be led by
the trio of senior guard Candice Wiggins,
freshman forward Kayla Pedersen and sopho
more post Jayne Appel. Wiggins was named
the MVP of the Spokane Regional while Peder
sen and Appel were named to the All-Region
team.
