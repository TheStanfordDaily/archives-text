was very drawn to all of the Rodin sculptures and included Fly
ing Figure as one of the objects in my tour, which was on the
art of movement. During my tour, I ask people to try to mimic
the statue's tilted-over position, standing on one leg with the
other one bent to the side, and used the exercise to demon
strate that the figure appears to be moving because the posi
tion is very difficult to hold. My latest ballet, the "Spirit of Stan
ford," is based on trying to emulate a series of Rodin sculp
tures. It starts with six Cardinal Ballet dancers positioned and
costumed on stage to appear as the Burghers of Calais in the
Quad. As Fleet Street starts singing the Stanford Hymn, the
dancers begin to move, first as extensions of their original
poses. The rest of their movement is based off of the positions
of statues found in the Rodin Sculpture Garden and GaHery.
Art enthusiasts can watch for representations of The Three
Shades, Eve, Flying Figure and Dance Movement Pas de
Deux "B". With this piece, I hope to capture the poise and ener
gy of Rodin's figures and to invite the audience to consider the
relationship between different types of art. The study of the
Rodin sculpture and their physical presence on the Stanford
campus combined with music of the Stanford Hymn and the
performance of Stanford students convey the Spirit of Stan
ford. The premiere of this new work will be Friday, April 5 in
Cardinal Ballet's Urban Nights Dance Fusion."
