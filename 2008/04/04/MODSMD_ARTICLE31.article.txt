Everyone's addicted to something. Unfulfilling relationships, America's Next Top
Model, purple Pilot G2 0.5 gel pens, heroin - whatever your poison, there's at least one
thing you just can't quit. Personally, if there were a rehab center for Guitar Hero junkies or
"Frasier" fanatics, I'd probably be strapped down in the high-risk constant vigilance cham
ber instead of sitting here, typing this and nursing my carpal tunnel. And spring quarter is
the time of year that feeds our addictions most: the weather's nice, classes seem less se
rious and you can get geared up for a whole lazy summer of glutting yourself on your ob
session of choice.
Sure, chances are our lives would be healthier and less fulfilling without these lit

tie fixations. Modern science predicts that, yes, a 10-page paper could get written without
eight hours of late-night "research" on Wikipedia, Snopes and Facebook. But if you swore
off your indulgences forever, how could you ever poke that cute guy down the hall (on da
book! Geez, people) or find old Burma Shave ads to write on Post-Its in purple pen and
stick up all over your room? Let's face it: addictions are fun. They must be, or else why the
hell would we get addicted in the first place?
So this week, Intermission is celebrating the small joys that certain addictions
bring into our lives. After all, as Anthony Hope so wisely pointed out: "You oughtn't to yield
to temptation. Well, somebody must, or the thing becomes absurd."
