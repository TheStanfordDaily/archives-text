## Dueling Addictions 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION JUNKIE 
Ours is truly a nation of junkies. From heroin to meth to Pop
sicles, we've all got our vices (guess which one mine is). Yet this
week at Intermission we ask: which of these addictions presents
the largest threat to Stanford, the United States and the world at
large? To find the answer, let's make like March Madness and
bracketologize!
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Crack vs. 16. Knuckle Cracking
Crack. Rock. Stone. Scud. Spork. (Fine. I made that one up.)
Whatever you call it, this incredibly addictive drug has had an im
measurably large impact on our society. There's a reason we fre
quently refer to things like bubble wrap and Milanos as "crack."
Meanwhile, knuckle cracking is more of a choice than an obses
sion. At least that's what I tell myself.
EDGE: Crack
8. Goldfish Crackers vs. 9. Cheez-Its
Pitting these two delicious cheesy snacks against each other
this early on seems almost unfair — it's like when the NCAA bas
ketball selection committee matches up two smaller-but-quality
mid-major schools in the tournament's first round, ensuring that
one of them will lose prematurely (think Gonzaga vs. Davidson).
Goldfish squeak bv in overtime due to their novel shape.
EDGE: Goldfish.
5. Exercise vs. 12. ESPN
Between all the biking, hiking and jogging that takes place on
campus, exercise is definitely a Stanford passion. Yet what about
watching other people exercise? As much as 1 love such program
ming as Sports Center, women's bowling and huge Scandinavian
men pulling trucks on harnesses, where do most people watch
ESPN? ...The gym.
EDGE: Exercise.
4. Facebook vs. 13. LOLCats
Which internet innovation is more addictive: ridiculous
"cheezburger"-craving infantile kitties, or the website that allows
you to keep tabs on the red cup exploits of people you haven't

seen since seventh grade? Answer: I just checked Facebook while
writing this. Had to return some pokes. You know how it is.
EDGE: Facebook.
3. Cigarettes vs. 14. Dan Brown
Prime upset material. Yes, everyone who goes on a trip to Eu
rope or to college in New York comes back a chainsmoker, but
everybody everywhere has been afflicted with Dan Brown dis
ease at some point. His books may all have the same exact plot (1.
Someone dies. 2. Bookish-but-secretly-sexy professor meets an
exotic woman. 3. They solve a mystery using esoteric Renaissance
knowledge. 4. They hook up.), but try putting one of those things
down. You can't. And you can quit smoking. Proof: Obama.
EDGE: Dan Brown.
6. Disgraced Celebrities vs. 11. Hannah Montana
From the countless stints in rehab to the unfortunately-named
children (I'm looking at you, Apple Martin-Paltrow, Kal-El Cage
and Jermajesty Jackson), making fun of fallen popular icons is a
national tradition. But it isn't a national nightmare. Think of a
storm that only targets preteen girls and you've got Hurricane
Hannah Montana. Her latest movie — which is seriously just a
taping of one of her concerts — made $66.8 million at the box of
fice. Only eight million less than "No Country for Old Men." I
know I'm the wrong age and gender, but what the hell is going on.
EDGE: Hannah Montana.
7. Wikipedia vs. 10. TiVo
Anyone who owns a TiVo swears by it and watches about
80()% more TV because of it. But do they secretly cite TiVo when
writing all of their papers? No. That's Wikipedia's job.
EDGE: Wikipedia.
2. Caffeine vs. 15. Rubik's cubes
Rubik's cubes litter this campus, but the rest of the country
hasn't really cared about them since the '80s. We have, however,
developed quite a little affinity for not sleeping. Well played, caf
feine.
EDGE: Caffeine.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Crack vs. 8. Goldfish

Our nation's toddlers aren't exactly clamoring for crack, and I
think that even the most hardcore junkie — someone with only
drugs on his mind — would down a carton of Goldfish if given the
chance.
EDGE: Goldfish. Upset!
5. Exercise vs. 4. Facebook
America is simultaneously getting fatter and more computer
savvy. Good for us?
EDGE: Facebook.
14. Dan Brown vs. 11. Hannah Montana
Fact: Before he became a successful douchey writer, Dan
Brown was a failed douchey pop star. Sorry, Dannah Montana.
EDGE: Hannah Montana.
7. Wikipedia vs. 2. Caffeine
The Wikipedia article on "caffeine" is 5,747 words long. The
article on "Wikipedia" is 5,186 words. Caffeine wins by an edit!
EDGE: Caffeine
FINAL FOUR
8. Goldfish vs. 4. Facebook
Facebook was a really good idea. Nice work, Zuckerberg. But
coipe on, the advent of XTra Cheddar Flavor-Blasted Goldfish
probably represents the most significant breakthrough in human
innovation since the atom bomb. And they're just as destructive.
EDGE: Goldfish.
11. Hannah Montana vs. 2. Caffeine
Vietnam. South Africa, Pakistan. Poland and Iran don't have
Starbucks. But they do have Hannah Montana. I actually wish it
were the other way around.
EDGE: Hannah Montana.
CHAMPIONSHIP
8. Goldfishes vs. 11. Hannah Montana
I am the addiction dictator, and I say good triumphs over evil!
CHAMP: Goldfish.
MVP: Those little smiles.

2. Caffeine vs. 15. Rubik's cubes
Rubik's cubes litter this campus, but the rest of the country
hasn't really cared about them since the '80s. We have, however,
developed quite a little affinity for not sleeping. Well played, caf
feine.
EDGE: Caffeine.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Crack vs. 8. Goldfish

Our nation's toddlers aren't exactly clamoring for crack, and I
think that even the most hardcore junkie — someone with only
drugs on his mind — would down a carton of Goldfish if given the
chance.
EDGE: Goldfish. Upset!
5. Exercise vs. 4. Facebook
America is simultaneously getting fatter and more computer
savvy. Good for us?
EDGE: Facebook.
14. Dan Brown vs. 11. Hannah Montana
Fact: Before he became a successful douchey writer, Dan
Brown was a failed douchey pop star. Sorry, Dannah Montana.
EDGE: Hannah Montana.
7. Wikipedia vs. 2. Caffeine
The Wikipedia article on "caffeine" is 5,747 words long. The
article on "Wikipedia" is 5,186 words. Caffeine wins by an edit!
EDGE: Caffeine
FINAL FOUR
8. Goldfish vs. 4. Facebook
Facebook was a really good idea. Nice work, Zuckerberg. But
coipe on, the advent of XTra Cheddar Flavor-Blasted Goldfish
probably represents the most significant breakthrough in human
innovation since the atom bomb. And they're just as destructive.
EDGE: Goldfish.
11. Hannah Montana vs. 2. Caffeine
Vietnam. South Africa, Pakistan. Poland and Iran don't have
Starbucks. But they do have Hannah Montana. I actually wish it
were the other way around.
EDGE: Hannah Montana.
CHAMPIONSHIP
8. Goldfishes vs. 11. Hannah Montana
I am the addiction dictator, and I say good triumphs over evil!
CHAMP: Goldfish.
MVP: Those little smiles.
