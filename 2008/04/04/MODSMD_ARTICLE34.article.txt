# THE 						DEA'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALTERNATIVES TO TODAY'S POPULAR STREET DRUGS
## ARRANGED IN ASCENDING ORDER OF ADDICTIVENESS 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION REHAB COACH 
Root vegetables — Potatoes are getting *
way too commercial these days. So why don't
you move beyond those sellout tubers? Turnips
and parsnips may have a bad rap, but that's only
(because they're a little too "indie" for the herba
ceous hegemony you'll find at The Man's salad bar.
| And beets? Get back, Mabel!

• U .K 1
Smooth Jazz — You've heard of "doing blow," but
blowing...into a saxophone? That's right! Clue yourself
into this hot scene and prepare to be amazed by the many
uses of synthesized chimes. The only "G" you'll be hanging
out with now is Kenny.

Don Johnson ("Miami Vice" era) — We've always liked him.

The feel of silk — Sometimes simple pleasures are best. What does the or-

gasmic rush of a heroin needle have against these smooth, smooth fibers?
Pornography — You may not be aware of this, but pornographic materials (often abbreviated "nogra
phy") are now widely available at a wide variety of locations, including the Internet, corner stores and be
hind the wainscoting in your older brother's room.
Orthodontia — Nothing says "badass" like a man who says "badass" without lisping. Get those teeth
straightened, hombre. and you're in for what we like to call "Nature's High" — respect.
People food — For dogs only.
Doritos — We actually don't eat Doritos here at the DEA because they leave their dust everywhere, but
we understand that they arc delicious. Pringles arc also good. Funyuns, people don't like so much.

Parliamentary' democracy — This is the obvious one. Debate those DTs away on the floor of the
House of Commoners. No more needles for you —just Robert's Rules and a powdered wig.
Fluoridated water — This one is easy and fun! Also, the Department of Health would like to apol
ogize about the addictive bit.
Don Johnson ("Nash Bridges" era) — Self-explanatory.

Methamcocaheroin — This one's new out there. Sounds pretty innocuous to us.
Microfiche — An underrated and compact method for storing newspaper archives and
copies of official documents, microfiche can also be ground into a fine powder and snort
ed.
