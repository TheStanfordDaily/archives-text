## Don't you know that it's toxic? 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE INTERMISSION CLIF-DIVER 
It's a pretty normal Wednesday
afternoon on the Stanford campus.
You're hanging out in your dorm
room procrastinating on doing the
work that was actually due yester
day (your professor hasn't granted
you an extension yet, but you're
sure he will.) Or maybe that's not
you at all. Maybe it's a pretty nor
mal Wednesday afternoon, but in
stead you're a go-getter — you
know, the type that does all of the
assigned reading and, heaven for
bid. goes to every lecture. In this
case, you're hanging out in your
dorm room actually using your time
effectively. Either way, be you lazy
or studious, it's 2:00 PM and you
find you have the munchies — not
the marijuana-induced kind
(though no one is ruling it out com
pletely), but the it's-late-afternoon
and-I-had-a-small-lunch kind of
munchies.
You do notice that there is
something a little bit different
about this hunger, though. Not only
is your stomach rumbling, but your
body is slowly starting spasm and
convulse. It's been several hours
since you had your last fix. No, not
just your last fix of any food, but
your last fix of a very specific food
combination, a combination a bit
more toxic than most people real

ize: the $6.00 Naked Juice-Clif Bar
combo deluxe supreme.
Like all drugs and most trends.

the Naked-Clif Cocktail has its
users, its abusers and its addicts.
Many Stanford students seem to
fall into the addict category.

You've probably found yoursell
at the Axe & Palm to get your
afternoon hit only to start
twitching and shaking when
the cashier informed you that
you didn't have enough Cardi
nal Dollars to pay (your habit
has been adding up), and they
also don't take American Ex
press. But don't worry; there is
help out there. In fact, there is
help right here.
The first step is admitting
that you have a problem.
That's right. Next time some
one gets snooty with you and
asks, "Do you have a prob
lem?" You're going to say,
"Yes, actually. I do have a
problem. I'm addicted to
Naked Juice and Clif Bars."
They're going to say, "There's
nothing wrong with those!"

But you're going to inform them
how very wrong they are.
Perhaps there is nothing inher
ently bad about Naked Juice or Clif
Bars. After all, at their hearts one is
just juice and the other is just sticky
oats. But it's a problem that this
particular drink and food combina
tion have monopolized the snack
market all together. It is

no good to subsist on a
diet of Naked and Clif
Bars when there are so
many other wonderful
options out there —
ones that are much less

expensive and a lit-

tle healthier.

No one is un-

dermining
the diver-

sity of
Stanford,
but very
few people

actually di
verge from the
trends. Why not

explore something
new and interesting?
True, it's hard to do that
in a university setting,
but there is more out
there than pseudo-hip
pie, pseudo-healthy
snack food.
True, your choices
are limited. Dining halls
are closed, and although
Stanford has Late Night,

there is yet to be Late Day. You
have little choice but to bike/skate
board/long-board/walk to the Axe

& Palm to pick up
your afternoon
snack. That said, it is
not impossible.

The best solution
might be to pre
vent the hunger
problem before it
starts. Never hes
itate to take a lit
tle bit of food
from the dining
hall. Bring a bag
gie for cereal.
Make yourself a
sandwich, or two
or three. Or
twelve. That way,
when the
munchies hit you
are prepared. Yes,
it will be difficult
at first. A PB&J
will not taste as
good as a Choco
late Chip Clif Bar.
Nevertheless, with

time you can do it.
If you forget to grab something
from the dining halls or have al
ready eaten your stash of food, just
choose cheaper, healthier things at
the campus restaurants. At the Axe
& Palm, a hefty bowl of cereal costs
only $2.25, and fruit is only 85 cents.
Water is free. Look at all of your
options.

Also, don't hesitate to take a trip
to Target or Safeway and buy some
snacks. You have to use real
money, but if you buy in bulk it can
end up being very cost effective.

Stock up on gra-

nola bars.

They will
satisfy your

sweet tooth like Clif

Bars, hut arc a lot less expensive.
Other things to consider are soup,
crackers and juice boxes.
At first, you might want to try
substituting the tastes of Clif Bars
and Naked Juices with similar
foods, but eventually you should
evolve to exploring new tastes.
Maybe go the savory route instead
i of the sweet. Be open-minded. It's
college. Experiment.
