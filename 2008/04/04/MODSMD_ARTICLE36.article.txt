# Everything sucks, and we can't get enough

### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION INSENSITIVE BASTARD 
We're addicted to negativity. As a
nation, indeed, as a world, we thrive
on and seem somehow to need the
feeling that everything is going
wrong, that our society and humanity
in general is consistently stupid and
mean. The economy is plummeting.
The war in Iraq is a catastrophe, as is
the entire Bush presidency. We have
destroyed our Earth with greenhouse
gases, professional athletes are de
grading their sports with steroids and
Britney Spears has completely im
ploded. I don't want to downgrade
the importance of any of these prob
lems— except for Britney Spears'
life; I mean, seriously, does anyone
really care? — but when we spend
our lives barraged by this endless
stream of cynicism and anger, I have
to wonder: Why?
Why do we as a people continual
ly subject ourselves to the pain of see
ing the world fall apart around us? Is
it truly the case that the problems
we're faced with today are so heinous
that they deserve the kind of negative
attention given to them in the media
and around the water cooler? I can't
help but think not. Over the course of
its history, humanity has faced count
less threats to its existence and has en
dured innumerable periods of vio
lence and mistreatment. And yet, we
survive. So why must we wake up
every morning to headlines reading:
"FAA Puts 'Flying Public' at Risk."
and "Third Graders Arrested in
Teacher Attack Plot" (both head
lines pulled from the front page of
CNN.com. by the way)? Could it be
because there's something about
hearing that our world is in shambles,
that death could come from any
where at any time and that evil is per
vasive, that we as a society crave? I
think maybe.
If that is the case, that we are
somehow addictcd to sensationalist
statements about how everything is
going down the toilet, then the ques
tion, once again, is why. What is it
about being reminded of all the bad
things in the world that we seem to
need? The cynical answer to that
question is that people want to feel
good about themselves, and the
quickest way to do that is to read a
story about someone who has it way
worse than you. But I don't adhere to
that viewpoint. I believe that most
people are truly saddened by the

atrocities committed in Darfur and
Tibet, and are truly worried about
the economy and the environment,
but that people ultimately can't deal
with complication. Things either are
or they aren't; a person is either good
or bad; there is either peace or there
is war. We are a nation of extremes,
and we're all addicted to our view
points.
And that's what it all comes down
to, I think: Everybody wants to have
something to say, nobody wants to
admit that they might be wrong, and
from that environment of stubborn
adherence to party line or principle,
we get sensationalism in the media.
There's a reason that, while the San
Francisco Chronicle might headline a
story of torture in Guantanamo Bay
and bury tales of American heroism
on page CI 6, the Houston Chronicle
might do the exact opposite: each is
playing to the entrenched opinions of
its readers, who are all equally con
vinced that they are right and the
other side is wrong. Nobody wants to
open their eyes to the fact that noth
ing is ever as simple as we make it out
to be, nor are things often as dramat
ic as they seem. Instead, we continue
to feed our addiction, to tell ourselves
that the sky is falling and it's all some
body else's fault. Nobody is willing
anymore to say, "It could be worse"
or "Look at the bright side," because
to even suppose that there is a bright
side is to reject the opinions which
people hold so dear and around
which entire personalities are
formed. The ultimate result is a
never-ending tug-of-war between
two sides that can't ever budge, and a
world which stagnates and wallows in
its dilemmas.
1 want to conclude this article by
reiterating that 1 am in no way trying
to make light of any of the issues we
face these days. Global warming,
global violence and global poverty
arc all very serious problems, and I
applaud all of those who give their
lives and efforts to help combat them.
All I am saying is this: There always
have been and always will be major
problems facing humanity, and it
doesn't help anyone to compound the
negativity through broad sensational
ism and unbending adherence to one
point of view. Everything is going to
be okay, everybody. There will al
ways be issues and there will always
be fighting, but there will also always
be good and friendship and love. 1
think we would all be well served to
remember that every once in a while.
