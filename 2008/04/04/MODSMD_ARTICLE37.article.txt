sneak peek: should casey and
rebecco be friends?

My hands are shaking, my limbs are twitching, and my breath is coming in shallow gasps
interspersed with hacking coughs. I'm currently going through withdrawal. It's sad and pa
thetic, but regrettably true. For the last several hours, I've been refreshing a webpage with
humiliating frequency. Since none of the three classes I'm taking this quarter have anv

reading due this week, I don't have anything better to do but watch the only TV show I currently follow: the one, the only, the terrible "Greek." Problem
is. the latest episode, which aired Monday, isn't online yet. Two thoughts are running repeatedly through my head — What the hell is wrong with ABC Fam
ily's webmasters, and what the hell is wrong with me?

Normally, I avoid TV shows because of their general lack of intelligent content. I fight the urge to vomit when 1 hear a laugh track — I consider myself
smart enough to know when and when not to laugh during a sitcom, thank you very much. With a personal history of staying away from TV, I honestly can't remember why I started watching "Greek"
in the first place. But now I'm hooked, and it isn't even a good show. The plot is only slightly less predictable than the dialogue, and 1 wouldn't want to be friends with any of the main characters in
real life. 1 haven't watched all that much TV, unless you count Bugs Bunny cartoons on Sunday mornings throughout my childhood, but I've watched enough to know that "Greek" is a special kind
of bad. Rusty Cartwright is no Bugs Bunny. Although it is cool that the producers put a shot of Hoover Tower in the opening.

1 actually had a conversation with my roommate on Tuesday about the possibility of suing ABC Family in the event that 1 decide I can't handle it anymore and take my own life. How pathetic is
that At least I was able to laugh about it for long enough to forget for a few seconds how empty my life is without this stupid show.

"Greek" is essentially the story of Rusty and Casey, a brother and sister (Casey is two years older)
plain white t's - party mix who end up at the same college. They seem to be polar opposites —he lives on his dorm's honors engi
neering floor, while she is a shoo-in for president of the self-proclaimed best sorority on campus. But
when Rusty decides to rush a fraternity during Orientation, their once separate worlds collide. The show chronicles their relationships with friends, lovers
(definitely plural), enemies and each other.
I could hardly be less involved in the Greek community at Stanford. The show and my life have pretty much nothing in common, except for the fact that
one of my close friends is a Chi O whose life very marginally resembles those of the characters on the show. And I went to the last 20 minutes of Chi Over
board last quarter. By rights, 1 shouldn I be at all interested in the show. But the application of this logic is doing nothing to help me overcome my addic
tion to "Greek."

evan chambers: what's your take? 1 put up with a lot of crap just to get my fix, too. The thing that probably bugs
me the most is the contact lens commercial that plays before, after, and in between
segments of the show. It involves an otherwise innocent-looking girl, who secret
ly can t pronounce mountain and is so boring that she discusses contacts with her equally noxious friend via webcam. I especially hate it when they trick
me into watching the advertisement again just so it will load the credits. Those dirty bastards, wasting an extra 30 seconds of my life. I am legitimately
angry here.
But it could be worse, I guess. I d rather be addicted to aIV show that takes 40 minutes of my time just once a week than, say, crack cocaine, which
takes not just time, but money and brain cells as well. Greek is relatively harmless, as long as 1 don't decide to become a sex-crazed alcoholic sorority
girl like cc rt.iin characters on the show just in time to register for spring rush. My goal is to have a relaxing spring quarter, but that would be taking it a bit

too far, don't you think?

On that note, here concludes this article, the latest item to be checked off my to-do list because I'm trying to stop thinking about "Greek." Maybe it's not so bad after all.
