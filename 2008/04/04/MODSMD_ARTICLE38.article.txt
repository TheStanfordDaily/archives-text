I have a confession to make: I am a You Tube addict. It's something I've been in denial about
for a long time, but I finally realized it was true during Dead Week last quarter, when I sat down
at 8 p.m. one night to work on my PHIL 151 take-home final. Suddenly it was 10 a.m. two days
later, and I realized I'd spent the whole time watching Michael Jackson videos. I told myself that
this was it. Life couldn't go on like this. I realized that You Tube was not only affecting my school
work, but it was also driving me away from friends and family. The only reason I ever did any
thing anymore was to have time for Michael Jackson videos. Who could I possibly talk to about
that? I was ashamed.
That finals week morning, I decided to take action. I could sec that my situation was rapidly
spiraling out of control, and I shuddered to imagine the consequences if 1 didn't act right then. I
would finish my finals, 1 told myself, and come spring break. I'd call my parents and get help.
That call never happened. And you know what? 1 decided it never will. You might be tempt
ed to dismiss me as just another junkie paying lip service to sobering up. But this is a carefully
thought-out decision. You sec, stuck here on campus over spring break with no finals to procras
tinate on, I had lot of time to reflect. And here's what I decided.

Featured Videos

JacksonS I Want You Back
First of all. everyone 1 know, and I mean everyone. has a You Tube skeleton in their closet. Whether it's
David Hasselhoff or Celine Dion or Steve Jobs keynote speeches, we all have an addiction to You Tube videos
or something similar. Mine just happens to be Michael Jackson. 1 could watch Michael for hours on end. any
thing from"I Want You Back" to "Scream," mesmerized by his voice and his moves. It wasn't until I found out
a close friend of mine also has a Michael Jackson problem that it occurred to me that it might not be such a
shameful thing.

Super Bowl XLII, NY Giants, Eli Manning
Pass To Burress

Now I'll admit, Michael Jackson is not my only You Tube affliction. While no other videos will ever do it for
me in quite the same way, I have another weakness: sports highlights. Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress for the
Super Bowl. Michael Jordan jamming from the free-throw line. For the sports fan, these are historic moments.
Moments that 1 personally happened to miss because 1 was either three years old or working the Sunday shift
at the math library. Before, 1 would have gone my whole life hearing about these moments from other people.
But now, thanks to You Tube, 1 can rectify what would have been tragic twists of fate. 1 can live these moments
for myself. And relive them. And relive them.

World Cup 2006 - Germany x Italy
One video that I have a particular weakness for is Fabio Grosso's goal against Germany in the World Cup
2006. Grosso taking the no-look pass, lobbing it with one touch around the outstretched arms of the German
keeper. As far as history is concerned, it's a safe bet that for the average Italian, Italy's successful World Cup
campaign carries far more significance than Garibaldi's unification of Italy 150 years before.

I'll be the first to admit my You Tubing is out of control, and that for many people, You Tube is indeed an addiction. But is it such a bad one to have? My Eng
lish profs might scoff, but I'd venture to say that You Tube is actually making me a more culturally literate person. Regardless of what you think of my taste, you
can't argue with the fact that no one is truly cultured until they've seen "Thriller" (which I saw for the first time last year, courtesy of You Tube). And if I go to
Italy and mention Fabio Grosso, they'll sec I know a thing or two about what it means to be Italian. A You Tube education, though it may not come in the form
(or at the price) of a textbook, clearly goes a long way in our society.
And so, my fellow You Tube addicts, be ashamed no more. The time has come for us to cast off the disdain of those who would have us believe that You Tube
is a waste of time. Because watching "Thriller," no matter how many times you've seen it before, is never a waste of time.
