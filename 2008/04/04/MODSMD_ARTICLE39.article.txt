## Addicted to sex 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION FOXY FIEND 
According to Wikipedia, sexual
addiction is similar to any other ad
diction: the subject becomes preoccu
pied with sex. This is because, like any
drug, sex "provides a quick mood
change, works every time and the
user loses control over their compul
sion." (Just wiki "sexual addiction.")
Now. dear reader, Roxy doesn't think
ths't being a sex addict is a good thing,
bui being a little preoccupied every
once in awhile will definitely provide
you a quick mood change to relax
ation and joy, and so long as you put
the effort in and have a partner who is
healthy for you, she promises that it
works every time.
Sex addiction seems to be a com
mon ailment among the rich and the
famous, who go into rehab for their
addiction, a la Halle Barry's former
husband, Eric Benet, whose sordid
tale and subsequent admission into a
clinic was all over the tabloids. Roxy's
pretty sure he didn't have an addic
tion but was simply a cheater benefit
ing from his wife's fame, but still, it
takes a lot of narcissism or "confi
dence" to cheat on someone like

Halle Berry. This is a narcissim that
most normal human beings lack.
Roxy dares to say that it wouldn't
hurt Stanford students to have some
confidence and put their needs first in
their sexual liaisons.
In a more specific form of sexual
addiction, the individual is a sexual
anorexic, a term that Roxy found to
be very interesting. Apparently, the
individual has a lot of anxiety sur
rounding sex and can only participate
in behaviors that are anonymous,
such as going to a strip club or hiring a
prostitute. This fits the description of
the now infamous governor Eliot
Spitzer, but Roxy is pretty sure that
this type of person simply fears com
mitment, not sex. In college, random
hook-ups reign supreme, with the ex
ception of those couples who have
merged into one. Although society
seems very concerned about this be
havior, Roxy is never one to judge
and is more concerned about the
basic lack of sex that Stanford stu
dents are having.
There is also a disorder called mas
turbation addiction. Since Roxy
knows that all of her fine readers can
assume what that means, she won't
delve.
