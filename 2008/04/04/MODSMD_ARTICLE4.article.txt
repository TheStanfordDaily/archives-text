GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is 13-8 overall and 2-1
in conference coming off of a disappointing loss to
the University of Hawai'i on Tuesday. The Sun Devils
come into this weekend's series as the No. 1 team
in the nation, having lost only one game on the sea
son. Stanford will face archrival Cal on Monday
after its three-game series with Arizona State this
weekend.

No. 13 Stanford baseball will open a cru
cial home series against the top-ranked
team in the nation tonight as Mark Mar
quess' squad takes on conference rival Ari
zona State. The No. 1 Sun Devils enter their
weekend matchup with the Cardinal riding
an eight game winning streak, including a
recent sweep of USC in Tempe, Ariz.
Indeed, the Devils have been nearly un
beatable all season, falling just once in their
first 28 games, including a perfect (and con
ference leading) Pac-lOmark of 3-0. Led of
fensively by two-time First Team All Pac-10
junior first baseman Ike Davis, the Devils
have outscored their opponents by nearly a
3:1 margin (287 runs scored to 1(H)), boast a
.342 team batting average and, still more im
pressively. a collective on base percentage
of .460.
Davis himself is currently batting .414

with a team-leading 10 home runs and an as
tounding .829 slugging percentage. But
ASU's offense is far from one dimensional
with junior third baseman Brett Wallace,
last year's conference Triple Crown winner
— notching the highest batting average,
most home runs and most RBI — and re
turning Player of the Year in the Pac-10.
Wallace is close behind Davis in most of
ASU's offensive statistics on the season,
batting .394 with nine homers and a .512 on
base percentage.
Still, the Sun Devils have enjoyed a home
field advantage all season — they will hit
the road for the first time all year to battle
the Cardinal (13-8, 2-1 Pac-10) at Klein
Field at Sunken Diamond. Stanford enters
the series after having its three game win
ning streak snapped on TUesday by I lawai'i,
which earned a 5-2 victory on the strength of
three runs in the top of the ninth.

Stanford will look
to rebound from a
disappointing,
late-inning loss to
Hawai'i this week
end when they
face off against the
top-ranked Ari
zona State Sun
Devils at Sunken
Diamond
Junior second baseman Cord
Phelps has stood out offensively for
Stanford, starting every game for the
Cardinal, notching a .415 BA and a
1.112 OPS. All told, four regular
starters and seven players total cur
rently boast averages better than
.300 for Stanford.
In the pitching department, the
Cardinal would appear to have a
slight edge over the Devils, at least

on the stat-sheet. The Cardinal's
three starters — junior lefty Jeremy
Bleich, senior Erik Davis and soph
omore Jeffrey lnman — have been
solid all season and excellent of late,
lnman and Bleich have notched
ERAs of 1.44 and 1.38, respectively,
while Davis has been dealing of late,
with a 2-0 record, a complete game,
and 18 strike outs in 16 innings in his
last two starts.
ASU's regular starters, Mike
Leake and Josh Satow, in contrast,
have amassed 3.26 and 3.86 ERAs,
respectively. Still, the Sun Devils
have notched an impressive 2.95
team ERA compared with Stan

ford's mark of 4.23. But there is no
question that Arizona State's of
fense has been the true key to its
dominance this season, averaging
10.25 runs scored per game com
pared to the Cardinal's average of
6.52.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess has an opportunity to move up
in the NCAA record books with a
series victory over the Sun Devils, as
a pair of wins would give him 1300
for his career and rank him tenth all
time among Division 1 coaches.
Tonight's game is scheduled for 6
p.m. while Saturday's and Sunday's
matchups are slated to start at 1 p.m.

ASU's starters have yet to be an
nounced, while Davis and lnman are
likely to start Saturday and Sunday,
respectively, for the Cardinal. Ari
zona State swept the Cardinal in
Tempe last year, putting them on top
85-82 in the all-time series between
the schools. Following their
matchup with the Devils, Stanford
will play non-conference games
against Cal and UC-Davis before
taking on two-time defending Na
tional Champion Oregon State in
Corvallis next weekend.
