GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is 13-8 overall and 2-1
in conference coming off of a disappointing loss to
the University of Hawai'i on Tuesday. The Sun Devils
come into this weekend's series as the No. 1 team
in the nation, having lost only one game on the sea
son. Stanford will face archrival Cal on Monday
after its three-game series with Arizona State this
weekend.

No. 13 Stanford baseball will open a cru
cial home series against the top-ranked
team in the nation tonight as Mark Mar
quess' squad takes on conference rival Ari
zona State. The No. 1 Sun Devils enter their
weekend matchup with the Cardinal riding
an eight game winning streak, including a
recent sweep of USC in Tempe, Ariz.
Indeed, the Devils have been nearly un
beatable all season, falling just once in their
first 28 games, including a perfect (and con
ference leading) Pac-lOmark of 3-0. Led of
fensively by two-time First Team All Pac-10
junior first baseman Ike Davis, the Devils
have outscored their opponents by nearly a
3:1 margin (287 runs scored to 1(H)), boast a
.342 team batting average and, still more im
pressively. a collective on base percentage
of .460.
Davis himself is currently batting .414

with a team-leading 10 home runs and an as
tounding .829 slugging percentage. But
ASU's offense is far from one dimensional
with junior third baseman Brett Wallace,
last year's conference Triple Crown winner
— notching the highest batting average,
most home runs and most RBI — and re
turning Player of the Year in the Pac-10.
Wallace is close behind Davis in most of
ASU's offensive statistics on the season,
batting .394 with nine homers and a .512 on
base percentage.
Still, the Sun Devils have enjoyed a home
field advantage all season — they will hit
the road for the first time all year to battle
the Cardinal (13-8, 2-1 Pac-10) at Klein
Field at Sunken Diamond. Stanford enters
the series after having its three game win
ning streak snapped on TUesday by I lawai'i,
which earned a 5-2 victory on the strength of
three runs in the top of the ninth.
