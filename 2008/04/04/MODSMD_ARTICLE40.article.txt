## SPRING FLING 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION FLOWER CHILD 
Ah, spring! April might be the cru
dest month, given that it mixes mem
ory and desire. That means that the
extra pounds you gained trying to stay
warm in winter will come back to
haunt you. Alas! The perils of being a
college student. But fear not. Spring
will shed that extra weight, and all
those heavy clothes you donned
through winter. These are three fash
ion trends that you should get hooked
on when considering your spring
wardrobe.
Flowers
Yes, you heard me right. Flowers.
Floral prints are making a comeback,
if Balenciaga's spring/summer show
ing is anything to go by. If you're
going to pull this look off, you'll need
to consider two important things: the
print itself and the cut. Please — no
dowdy old flowers should grace your
fabric.
Instead, the image conjured
should be one of a riotous bed of exot
ic blooms: hydrangeas, heliconias and
hibiscuses could be exciting choices.
But even if the fabric is beautiful, it
can't save an ugly dress. For spring,
consider a cut that plunges in the
back, or nicely shows off your shoul
ders: nice from the front, naughty

from the back.
For the more fashion forward,
think of something that lifts away
from the body — peplums, or that
awkward-chic padded shoulder that
seems to be so a la mode at the mo-

ment. These details exaggerate
a shape that is not convention- :
ally feminine but, neverthe- j
less, daringly sexy.

Volume

When considering a
sundress, little things that

barely cover your bits

are so passe. (The ital
ics are accompanied

by eye rolling.) You
want your sundress
to say that you've

got style, not
syphilis.

So in
stead of at
tempting
to wear

those body-hugging minis
that — let's face it — very

few of us ordinary non
model mortals can wear
anyway, why not try on
something that suggests

curves, rather than

shows off too
many? And what
could be more

charming than
► looking like a
voluminous
sugar puff?

(Well, eating a

voluminous sugar
puff, but don't get

me started

on those.)
Volume can flatter existent curves
or insinuate non-existent ones. To get
some flattering volume on your body,
you'll need to explore all possible av
enues: ruffles, ruching, maybe even an
oversized ribbon.
You might even want to venture
into the dangerously tacky territory of
Japonica by cinching your waist with a
summer obi. But if you do this, re
member the mantra: less is more.
Nothing is less attractive than trying
too hard — other than not trying hard
enough, of course.
Accessories
The devil is, unfortunately, in the
details. That means that you'll have to
work hard to complete a hot look.
Spring is the season for sunglasses and
hats, since there'll (hopefully) be tons
of sun. A good bet: going with some-

thing oversized or embellished. Take
a colorful cloche hat, adorn with some
ribbon, perhaps even stick in some
flowers, and there you have it — the
perfect bon chic ban genre foil to lift
your outfit from blah to voila.
For those who are less continental
ly inclined, perhaps a gigantic floppy
fedora in a bright color might do the
trick. As for sunglasses, avoid aviators
— they're just too safe. Experiment,
experiment, experiment, since there
are many on the market in various
shapes, sizes and colors.
Futuristic robotic shades are com
ing into style, thanks to Martin
Margiela's automaton-esque wrap
around sunglasses. But if that's too
vanguard for you, you can't go wrong
with simple fly-eyed shades, which are
the perfect cover-up for the dark cir
cles that follow a late night of study
ing. But hey — it's spring, so who
needs to study anyway?

dest month, given that it mixes mem
