## TRAILER PARK 
### AISHA WELLS INTERMISSION COMPRESSED CRITIC 
What better times to waste several $10 hills at the
movies than spring and summer? Here are some upcoming
comedy, action, and horror films for you to enjoy — or not.
I have yet to see them, but with official movie trailers prac
tically giving away half the film, I'd say my assessment is
still pretty valid.

The Dark Knight
Release Date: July 25,2008
Director: Christopher Nolan

Cast: Christian Bale ("Ameri
can Psycho"), Heath Ledger
("Brokeback Mountain"), Mag
gie Gyllenhaal ("Secretary"),
Morgan Freeman ("Million Dol
lar Baby")
"The Dark Knight," which is
the sequel to 2005's "Batman Be
gins," is definitely one of the most
hyped movies of the summer. The
official trailer doesn't really give
much hint of a story or what the
film is going to be about, but this
isn't surprising. After all, who
doesn't know Batman? And I'm

sure the filmmakers/producers
are expecting it to be popular for reasons other than a captivating plotline.
While Christian Bale, who has come to lie quite a respected actor in the in
dustry, makes his return as the infallible hot guy in a tight bat-suit, the movie
will really be talked about for the role of the Joker, played by recently de
ceased actor Heath Ledger. 1 tend to think that knowing one of the main leads
is dead somewhat diminishes the exciting action-adventure feel to the movie,
but I suppose Heath Ledger's unexpected tragedy would also encourage you
to see his very last film, as it is one more chance to see him alive. But enough
with the sadness.
I he movie itself does not look exceptionally promising, but it doesn't have
to. 1 am sure most action movie buffs will enjoy it just because it's Batman.
There are plenty of explosions, fast cars, feisty females and general action
goodness to hold your attention. I did find Gyllenhaal's placement slightly
odd. though, especially considering her usual off-beat indie fare. But Bale,
Ledger, and a small part from Morgan Freeman basically guarantee some
well-played roles. Ledger, in particular, looked positively entrancing. And to
be honest, you wouldn't really be able to tell that it's him without knowing be
forehand; his accent and face are totally indiscernible. This may seem like a
pointless observation, but considering that the roles of Batman and Joker
have been played by multiple actors over the years (remember Michael
Keaton and Jack Nicholson from the 1989 version?), I think it's important to
totally remove yourself, as an actor, from the character. I want to see Batman
fighting off evil villains and speed racing through the streets in his Batmobile.
I don't want to see Christian Bale playing Batman and doing all those things.
Anyway, I'd probably bum another $10 hole in my wallet to see this. You
should too.

The Ruins
Release Date: April 4,2008
Director: Carter Smith

Cast: Jena Malone ("Saved!"), Joe Anderson ("Becoming
Jane"), Jonathan Tucker ("The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
[2003]), Shawn Ashmore (The "X-Men" series)

American tourists never learn, do they? They're always med
dling, prying things that shouldn't be pried, annoying natives and
the like. The college-aged ones are especially prone to torture and
bloody deaths. But you would think that after watching countless
numbers of horror movies with the same generic plot, we would at
least be hesitant of traversing foreign territory, even if the films are
"just movies." The characters in "The Ruins" wouid disagree —
but they pay for it dearly, of course.

In the official trailer, we're introduced to a group of five friends
vacationing in Mexico and doing typical vacation things like swim
ming and sunbathing. Out of nowhere, one of them decides to visit
the ancient Mayan ruins just for kicks because, you know, unearthing ancient burial sites is so much fun. The
other friends inevitably agree to tag along, and off they go to meet their impending deaths. Along the way, they
encounter and stupidly ignore some natives who deliver an ominous warning to stay away from the ruins,
thereby establishing the film's dark tone and guaranteeing that all hell is about to break loose. (The natives are
never wrong in these types of movies. You hear that, tourists? THEY ARE NEVER WRONG.)

Now, the thing that really gets me about these kids is that they don't just go to the ruins to do ordinary
tourist-y things like take photos, take a tour, or whatever. They actually go inside an ancient, abandoned
Mayan archaeological dig with nothing but ropes and flashlights — after the natives vehemently warn them of
some old. random curse. It doesn't even matter what the curse is: the fact that they could be so dumb as to
march their way into some foreign Mayan ruin — no wait — DESCEND into the darkness of a Mayan ruin,
is just baffling to me. From there, the movie is totally predictable: they're in pitch-black darkness, they hear
suspicious noises, one of them suddenly gets dragged away from the group by an unknown thing, blah blah
blah. Apparently, the killer in this film is a bunch of vines. Yes, vines. Vines that grow under your skin and
make you sick, I guess. In other words: mindless (lack of) entertainment.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall
Release Date: April 18,2008
Director: Nicholas Stoller

Cast: Kristcn Bell ("Veronica Mars"), Jason Segel ("How I Met
Your Mother"), Mila Kunis ("That '70s Show"), Jonah Hill ("Super
bad")
If you've been to San Francisco recently, you may have seen some
ads with mysterious lines like "I'm so over you, Sarah Marshall" and
"My Mom always hated you, Sarah Marshall." I don't remember what
I initially thought these were referring to, but look no further than this
light-hearted comedy produced by Judd Apatow, the same maker of
hits like "The 40-Year-01d Virgin" and "Knocked Up" for the an
swer. The trailer makes this movie out to be no different from any
other standard girls-night-out type of romantic comedy, but Apatow
has established a reputation for insanely funny characters. His plots
may not be that original, but who cares when you can watch Steve
Carell spew obscenities whilst getting his chest waxed? And most peo
ple will probably recognize another actor from Apatow films: Jonah

Hill, the foul-mouthed, chubby high school senior from "Superbad" making an appearance as a restaurant host
in this film. So at least Sarah Marshall is guaranteed to be somewhat funnv.

As far the story goes, we meet Jason Scgel s character as a down-on-his-luck guy who is dating a famous TV
star, Kristen Bell s character. I Jnfortunately, Bell dumps him at the beginning of the movie for a dirty but pop
ular British rock star with unbelievably greasy hair and the desire to bed multiple women (they always want the
bad guys, don't they?). As the San Francisco ads apparently show, Segel desperately wants to forget about Bell
and attempts to use one-night stands as a coping method. When that doesn't exactly work as planned, he decides
to take a relaxing trip to Hawaii — only to end up at the same hotel as Bell and her new rocker boyfriend and
to make a reservation for the table directly across from theirs. Insert wittv one-liners, sexual innuendo and dirtv
jokes, and there you have a film that's probably going to be moderately popular but definitelv not on the same
level as Superbad. In that case, don t waste your time or money.
