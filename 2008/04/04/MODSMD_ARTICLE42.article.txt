## Book review: "The Power of Now" 
### MELANIE REYNARD INTERMISSION ZEN MAVEN 
Harold and Kumar Escape
from Guantanamo Bay
Release Date: April 25,2008
Directors: John Hurwitz and
Hayden Schlossberg
Actors: John Cho, Kal Penn
So my review for this movie
is pretty simple: go see it.
I found "Harold and Kumar
Go To White Castle" to be ab
solutely hilarious, and the trail
er for its sequel promises even
more crazy antics and hysterical
one-liners.
In keeping with all the buzz
about terrorism, Harold and
Kumar this time find them
selves imprisoned in the infa
mous Guantanamo Bay deten
tion center after Kumar is mis
taken for a suicide bomber.
The duo's problems begin
when Kumar is asked to step
aside at an airport security
checkpoint for a "random"
check. Luckily, the two eventu
ally get through but are at
tacked by fellow passengers
when an old lady hallucinates
and imagines Kumar to be a
long-bearded and turbaned ter
rorist.
Though Kumar is initially
the only one taken into custody,
Harold is forced to come along
because "North Korea and Al-
Qaeda are working together."
Somehow, in the midst of all
this hilarity, Harold and Kumar
escape from Guantanamo and
end up at George Bush's ranch
house, where more political
satire is sure to occur.
When I can find myself
laughing out loud at a two-and
a-half minute trailer, the movie
is guaranteed to be some good
mindless entertainment. Defi
nitely check this one out.

Dublin, Ireland. I had only been
there a week. My new Irish friend
— a tall, shaggy-haired vegan boy
— stood beaming down on me with
a childish grin and presented me
with a gift-wrapped rectangle. 1 un
peeled it to find a book: "The Power
of Now" by Eckhart Tolle.
1 had been traveling in Europe
for months. I was settling and re
settling in pursuit of various pro
jects and idealistic dreams. It was
my first time out of the academic
calendar system; out on my own,
while Fall Quarter classes at Stan
ford were underway without me.
Even before I arrived in Dublin,
I had had countless interactions
with strangers, beds, tours, wander
ings, foods, maps, snapshots, visas
and perpetual searches. My ankle
was sprained. I was exhausted. Nev
ertheless, I was restless. Late at
night, I would slap on make-up, pop
in my earrings and rush out the door
into the chilly black night. But then
I'd crash on the pavement and ex
plode in tears. Paralyzed with inde
cision, I'd cry, "I need to go meet
people! I need to see the sights!"
My lanky leprechaun came to
me. He crouched beside me. He put
his hand on my shoulder, "Why

aren't you happy being still?"
With his Eckhart Tolle mantras,
I became aware that I was facing a
deep internal conflict. Maybe it was
my (Stanford) culture that made me
need to feel productive all the time.
To me, a "state of rest" can only
happen post-exertion.
"The Power of Now" is a book
that can only be read despacio (the
Spanish word for slowly, quietly)
just like the way a lightweight must
sip champagne through the hours of
an evening dinner party. Months
later, I am back in my busy, stimu
lating Stanford zone, and I have
only now finished reading. My
overall review: Tolle's Christian-
Buddhist messages led me closer to
enlightenment, even though I still
get nausea when I think about
thinking (or trying not to think,
rather). The presumptive tone and
a few of the author's sweeping re
marks also led me to raise my eye-

brow.
God doesn't exist like He used
to. When our country was founded,
the Puritans would not have let you
forget the omnipotent, om
nipresent father. It is only in our
21st century post-postmodern
Western society, where God no
longer exists, that this book could
become the #1 New York Times
Bestseller and sell over 100,000

copies. Tolle
taps into our
greatest fear:
the fear that
we have be
come so
image-orient
ed that we are
actually delu
sional. It is
very possible
in a society
rife with ad
vertising and
images that
our expecta
tions and fan
tasies are so
out of touch
with reality
that they
could only
lead to dys
function and
disappoint
ment. In
stead, Tolle's
words offer
"the reality
that dissolves
the illusion."
He promises
us that if we
let go of our
mental im-

ages, mental chatter and ego to
heighten our senses to the present
moment, there will be a "death of il
lusions." Does Tolle promise that if
you read this book, you will be
happy? No. The light at the end of
Tolle's tunnel is not happiness, but

it is peace.
Tolle's points may

lead to some "Aha!"

we
may believe that we need to think in
order to be brilliant (the way we
slaved through the SATs to get into
Stanford!), in reality, inspiration is
effortless. Life is not a balancing act
of eating junk food and then eating
salad, as our pop culture tells us it is.
Life is, instead, an accumulation of
these moments in which Tolle calls
upon us to be "intensely present"
and to "think with your whole
body."
Tolle's text also offers relation
ship advice. In a culture of "hook
ups," where intimacy and love seem
so übiquitous, Tolle reminds us that
love, as a continual state, is rare. We
become addicted to people because
we judge, have expectations and be
come possessive. We easily forget
that it takes two people to make a
relationship, not just a person and
the internet, phone or other techno
logical communication system. In
our culture, we arc taught to swal
low love and hate (be affectionate
and yet hard-to-get) in the same
vein, but Tolle states that "true love
has no opposite." Tolle dispels the
notion of having love exclusively
for one partner or clan. We love
everyone, unselcctively. All that
differentiates a romantic relation
ship is the degree of intensity.
What is the danger of this book?
With postmodern paranoia of being
delusional, I found myself wonder
ing if I could actually do myself

harm by trusting in Tolle's words as
truth and guidance. There were mo
ments when 1 raised my eyebrow,
like when Tolle implied that his
teachings are rare among the ma
jority of people, although with
100.0(K) books sold, he is not exact
ly outside of the fringes of mass
media. Also, he warns against
"mental movies" that "project

yourself in the future," but this is a
, strategy often used by people who
I have goals. For example, a
|yi world-class athlete may visualize
m what it is like to cross the finish

line as a practice for suc-
A ~A <U,.

cess. And in the end,
k this is why I turned

away from my lep-
Li rechaun. 1 could
not help but

judge his tran
quility as a
form of
lethargy,
compared to
my driven
Stanford self.
His words of
solace and ac
cept a n c e
seemed to

harbor a sense
of complacency that I did not ac
cept.
"Living in the present" and such
phrases have become hokey buzz
words in pop culture. When asked
by a fan about all the pressure and
hype to "live in the now," even Eliz
abeth Gilbert, author of another
bestselling spiritual book "Eat,
Pray, Love" admitted, "We are reg
ular garden variety mortals. The
spirituality happens in fits and
starts. Go ahead and take photos,
have wonderful memories, and
make plans."
Is it possible to clear my mind of
all thoughts? After all, I wake up,
and I think, "Okay, get out of bed,"
before I actually do it. Moreover, a
person with no thoughts makes for
a terrible conversationalist. But. I
do believe Tolle: There must be a
way for me, like a flower, to func
tion, even to flourish, without
thinking.
Sitting on the bright green grass,
I close the book. 1 look out on the
Oval, my mind abuzz with my ques
tions, and my conflicts. 1 envision
the rainbow and the pot of gold at
the end of it that I want so desper
ately. Then I try to remind myself
that I'm already sitting on it. They
arc intrinsic, these Hecks of gold.
Like a soft murmur underground
that is hard to hear, even when 1 lay
my ear to the ground. What I want
is shining. It is this moment.

longer exists, that this book could
become the #1 New York Times
Bestseller and sell over 100,000

copies. Tolle
taps into our
greatest fear:
the fear that
we have be
come so
image-orient
ed that we are
actually delu
sional. It is
very possible
in a society
rife with ad
vertising and
images that
our expecta
tions and fan
tasies are so
out of touch
with reality
that they
could only
lead to dys
function and
disappoint
ment. In
stead, Tolle's
words offer
"the reality
that dissolves
the illusion."
He promises
us that if we
let go of our
mental im-

ages, mental chatter and ego to
heighten our senses to the present
moment, there will be a "death of il
lusions." Does Tolle promise that if
you read this book, you will be
happy? No. The light at the end of
Tolle's tunnel is not happiness, but

it is peace.
Tolle's points may

lead to some "Aha!"

we
may believe that we need to think in
order to be brilliant (the way we
slaved through the SATs to get into
Stanford!), in reality, inspiration is
effortless. Life is not a balancing act
of eating junk food and then eating
salad, as our pop culture tells us it is.
Life is, instead, an accumulation of
these moments in which Tolle calls
upon us to be "intensely present"
and to "think with your whole
body."
Tolle's text also offers relation
ship advice. In a culture of "hook
ups," where intimacy and love seem
so übiquitous, Tolle reminds us that
love, as a continual state, is rare. We
become addicted to people because
we judge, have expectations and be
come possessive. We easily forget
that it takes two people to make a
relationship, not just a person and
the internet, phone or other techno
logical communication system. In
our culture, we arc taught to swal
low love and hate (be affectionate
and yet hard-to-get) in the same
vein, but Tolle states that "true love
has no opposite." Tolle dispels the
notion of having love exclusively
for one partner or clan. We love
everyone, unselcctively. All that
differentiates a romantic relation
ship is the degree of intensity.
What is the danger of this book?
With postmodern paranoia of being
delusional, I found myself wonder
ing if I could actually do myself

harm by trusting in Tolle's words as
truth and guidance. There were mo
ments when 1 raised my eyebrow,
like when Tolle implied that his
teachings are rare among the ma
jority of people, although with
100.0(K) books sold, he is not exact
ly outside of the fringes of mass
media. Also, he warns against
"mental movies" that "project

yourself in the future," but this is a
, strategy often used by people who
I have goals. For example, a
|yi world-class athlete may visualize
m what it is like to cross the finish

line as a practice for suc-
A ~A <U,.

cess. And in the end,
k this is why I turned

away from my lep-
Li rechaun. 1 could
not help but

judge his tran
quility as a
form of
lethargy,
compared to
my driven
Stanford self.
His words of
solace and ac
cept a n c e
seemed to

harbor a sense
of complacency that I did not ac
cept.
"Living in the present" and such
phrases have become hokey buzz
words in pop culture. When asked
by a fan about all the pressure and
hype to "live in the now," even Eliz
abeth Gilbert, author of another
bestselling spiritual book "Eat,
Pray, Love" admitted, "We are reg
ular garden variety mortals. The
spirituality happens in fits and
starts. Go ahead and take photos,
have wonderful memories, and
make plans."
Is it possible to clear my mind of
all thoughts? After all, I wake up,
and I think, "Okay, get out of bed,"
before I actually do it. Moreover, a
person with no thoughts makes for
a terrible conversationalist. But. I
do believe Tolle: There must be a
way for me, like a flower, to func
tion, even to flourish, without
thinking.
Sitting on the bright green grass,
I close the book. 1 look out on the
Oval, my mind abuzz with my ques
tions, and my conflicts. 1 envision
the rainbow and the pot of gold at
the end of it that I want so desper
ately. Then I try to remind myself
that I'm already sitting on it. They
arc intrinsic, these Hecks of gold.
Like a soft murmur underground
that is hard to hear, even when 1 lay
my ear to the ground. What I want
is shining. It is this moment.



Harold and Kumar Escape
from Guantanamo Bay
Release Date: April 25,2008
Directors: John Hurwitz and
Hayden Schlossberg
Actors: John Cho, Kal Penn
So my review for this movie
is pretty simple: go see it.
I found "Harold and Kumar
Go To White Castle" to be ab
solutely hilarious, and the trail
er for its sequel promises even
more crazy antics and hysterical
one-liners.
In keeping with all the buzz
about terrorism, Harold and
Kumar this time find them
selves imprisoned in the infa
mous Guantanamo Bay deten
tion center after Kumar is mis
taken for a suicide bomber.
The duo's problems begin
when Kumar is asked to step
aside at an airport security
checkpoint for a "random"
check. Luckily, the two eventu
ally get through but are at
tacked by fellow passengers
when an old lady hallucinates
and imagines Kumar to be a
long-bearded and turbaned ter
rorist.
Though Kumar is initially
the only one taken into custody,
Harold is forced to come along
because "North Korea and Al-
Qaeda are working together."
Somehow, in the midst of all
this hilarity, Harold and Kumar
escape from Guantanamo and
end up at George Bush's ranch
house, where more political
satire is sure to occur.
When I can find myself
laughing out loud at a two-and
a-half minute trailer, the movie
is guaranteed to be some good
mindless entertainment. Defi
nitely check this one out.

Dublin, Ireland. I had only been
there a week. My new Irish friend
— a tall, shaggy-haired vegan boy
— stood beaming down on me with
a childish grin and presented me
with a gift-wrapped rectangle. 1 un
peeled it to find a book: "The Power
of Now" by Eckhart Tolle.
1 had been traveling in Europe
for months. I was settling and re
settling in pursuit of various pro
jects and idealistic dreams. It was
my first time out of the academic
calendar system; out on my own,
while Fall Quarter classes at Stan
ford were underway without me.
Even before I arrived in Dublin,
I had had countless interactions
with strangers, beds, tours, wander
ings, foods, maps, snapshots, visas
and perpetual searches. My ankle
was sprained. I was exhausted. Nev
ertheless, I was restless. Late at
night, I would slap on make-up, pop
in my earrings and rush out the door
into the chilly black night. But then
I'd crash on the pavement and ex
plode in tears. Paralyzed with inde
cision, I'd cry, "I need to go meet
people! I need to see the sights!"
My lanky leprechaun came to
me. He crouched beside me. He put
his hand on my shoulder, "Why

aren't you happy being still?"
With his Eckhart Tolle mantras,
I became aware that I was facing a
deep internal conflict. Maybe it was
my (Stanford) culture that made me
need to feel productive all the time.
To me, a "state of rest" can only
happen post-exertion.
"The Power of Now" is a book
that can only be read despacio (the
Spanish word for slowly, quietly)
just like the way a lightweight must
sip champagne through the hours of
an evening dinner party. Months
later, I am back in my busy, stimu
lating Stanford zone, and I have
only now finished reading. My
overall review: Tolle's Christian-
Buddhist messages led me closer to
enlightenment, even though I still
get nausea when I think about
thinking (or trying not to think,
rather). The presumptive tone and
a few of the author's sweeping re
marks also led me to raise my eye-

brow.
God doesn't exist like He used
to. When our country was founded,
the Puritans would not have let you
forget the omnipotent, om
nipresent father. It is only in our
21st century post-postmodern
Western society, where God no
longer exists, that this book could
become the #1 New York Times
