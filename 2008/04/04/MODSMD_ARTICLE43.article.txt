## worth seeing but not a winner STOP-LOSS: 
### ERIC MESSINGER INTERMISSION CINEMATIC SOLDIER 
Director Kimberly Peirce made her name with 1999's Oscar-winning
"Boys Don't Cry." Her second film is the Iraq War feature "Stop-Loss," in
spired by the experiences of her brother, a soldier in the conflict. The film sets
out to tell its story from the perspective of the soldiers. It opens with a frenet-

ic action sequence, as
American soldiers fight it
out in Fallujah with the
bad-guy insurgents. Men
die on both sides, and we
meet our main trio of he
roes — Staff Sergeant
Brandon King (Ryan
Phillippe), Sergeant Steve
Shriver (Channing Tatum)
and Specialist Tommy
Burgess (Joshua Gordon-
Levitt). In the aftermath,
the film includes some am
ateur DV combat footage,
in the style that soldiers in
Iraq (including her broth
er) have adopted for docu
menting the war.
Soon enough, they re
turn to America, their
tours of duty completed.
The film then begins in
earnest. The men get a
brief leave before dis
charge at their hometown
in Texas, where they are
greeted as heroes by their
families, friends, loved
ones and Senator Worrell
(Josef Sommer). Worrell in
particular seems pleased to
see the soldiers and
promises King his loyalty

and support in thanks for his service. A night of
Texan-style fun and mayhem ensues, and the soldiers
start showing their particular cracks soon enough.
Things between Shriver and his fiancee Michelle
(Abbie Cornish) look particularly troubled, but
Burgess sports his own alcohol-fueled emotional is
sues.

When the three report back to the nearest base,
King learns that instead of receiving the honorable
discharge he was expecting, he's been "stop-lossed."

This policy, an actual feature of the war in Iraq, amounts to a presidential
order declaring that, due to wartime conditions, tours of duty can be extend
ed indefinitely. Not wanting to stay in the service, an outraged King beats up
his military escorts and goes AWOL. Enlisting the help of Michelle, he vows
to go to see Senator Worrell to make good on the man's promised support
and find a way out of the stop-loss policy. Shrivcr has to juggle taking care of
an emotionally deteriorating Burgess and heading out on military orders to
bring King back.
King's hopes appear slim from the onset, and the film clearly evokes the
desperation of his situation. It becomes obvious that there isn't an easy solu
tion. No one would expect a Senator to risk the public relations disaster of
meeting with an AWOL soldier, and his naivete about the possibility of get-

ting some kind of free pass is part touching, part pitiful. The film only makes
the journey seem more unlikely, as well: it loudly emphasizes that the mili
tary is staging a manhunt for him, but allows him to enjoy one of the most un
bothered flights from the law in recent cinematic memory. The trip to Wash-

ington is, on all counts, a
flight of fancy.
As this becomes appar
ent, the options dwindle, in
King's perspective, to two
choices: leave the country,
or return to the military.
This choice, more than any
thing, hurts the film, as ei
ther ending would be whol
ly unsatisfactory. The film
spends time establishing his
emotional connections with
his family, his friends and.
increasingly, with Michelle,
and to leave them all behind
for a life in Canada or Mex
ico would make for a hollow
conclusion. But the film
can't make you happy if
King rejoins the military, ei
ther. Furthermore, the me
chanics of King navigating
these two choices are full of
gaps in continuity and logic,
as the military. King and
those around him change
their minds in mostly unex
plained ways.
"Stop-Loss," therefore,
establishes two possible un
satisfactory conclusions.

dutifully chooses one of
them at the end and arrives at that choice through a se
ries of implausible or simply unexplained choices and
events. As a film, despite some excellent perfor
mances, compelling scenes and the especially interest
ing dynamic between King and Michelle, it simply does
not work.

While Peircc's commitment and integrity deserve
respect, she has made a cold and unsatisfactory film.
Yet for the very reasons that it fails as a piece of art, it
succeeds in capturing the boxed-in feeling of war five

years and counting. Rccent history has made it very clear that even when a
whole lot of people disagree with those in power, even when all moral logic
argues against something, at the end of the day, the country requires those in
power to exercise responsibility and stewardship in their positions. If they do
not, as "Stop-Loss" maddeningly demonstrates, very little can be done.
Peirce could not have made a film that attacked the war openly without
betraying her brother's service. She could have chosen a narrative with more
compelling possibilities, certainly, but the emotional satisfaction it would
have provided would have been even more of a betrayal, an assertion of an
easy solution to something far more complicated. The failures of "Stop-
Loss" as a film constitute its most damning case against the failures of our
leaders. And I'll remember that far after this film has faded away.
