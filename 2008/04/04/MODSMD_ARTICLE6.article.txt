## Legacy STILL FACTOR IN ADMISSIONS Legacies make up about 20 percent of Class of 2011 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
As undergraduate admission grows
increasingly competitive, the impact of legacy
status on admission decisions has raised ques
tions about what role it should play in the
admission process.
According to Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid Richard Shaw,
approximately 20 percent of the matriculating
freshmen of the Class of 2011 had a parent
who received an undergraduate or graduate
degree from Stanford.
"We are comfortable with considering
intergenerational relationships to the
University," Shaw said. "Legacy applicants
come from highly educated families and must
be competitive to be successful in the admis
sion process at Stanford."

Howard Wolf '80, vice president for
Alumni Affairs and president of the Stanford
Alumni Association, agreed that legacy
admissions are critical to Stanford's future as
an elite institution.
"I see only advantages to Stanford of our
current legacy admission policy," he said."'llie
transfer of intergenerational loyalty, and the
relationships between the University and its
graduates that support this loyalty, are
supremely important to Stanford and its
future."
Though both Shaw and Wolf emphasized
that legacy' status is only one of the many fac
tors considered in the admission process,
some students question whether it should be
considered at all.
"1 think the idea of the system is elitist,"
said Avery Halfon '10. "Though I haven't met
a single legacy student who does not deserve

to be here, I think the policy is unfair because
it is not merit-based."
Jessica Perez '10 added that while the pol
icy is not bad in practice, it should not be con
sidered in the admission process.
"Whether or not a student's parents
attended Stanford University shouldn't be
something that admissions considers when
deciding whether to accept a student," Perez
said. "You can't tell whether or not a student
is prepared for the University based on what
their parents did."
Some students, both legacy and first gener
ation. argued that the policy is too complex to
be branded either good or bad.
"Legacy admission means a lot of different
things to different people," said Hanna
Michelsen '10. "1 think people assume that
legacy admits are likely to succeed here.

Xi. "It is often very miscon
ceived that children of graduates of
Stanford or like institutions get in simply
because of their legacy status," Shaw said.
"This is not correct. They must meet the very
high expectations of all candidates and they
must be exceedingly well educated and com
petitive."
But one legacy admit questioned Shaw's
defense, suggesting that legacy status may
have played a much larger role in the stu
dent's admission.
"1 definitely feel that beine, a legacv really

admission
process." said a fry.

"Though 1 worked really hard in high school.
I think that without being a legacy it would
have been a lot harder for me to get in."
That alumni make up the majority of
Stanford's donors makes the issue all the
more contentious.
"It's all about the money" said Soroush
Salehiah '10. "I don't think that this policy will
end anytime soon because the University
depends on these donations and the services
that alumni provide. Legacy is like a reward."
