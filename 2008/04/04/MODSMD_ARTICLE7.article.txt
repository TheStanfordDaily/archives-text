## Candidates seek group endorsements Coveted signs of support may play smaller role in ASSU election 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though student group endorsements have sparked
much less contention in the current ASSU election cycle
than in years past, candidates are still working hard to rack
them up.
The decline in prominence of endorsements began with
the Students of Color Coalition, which abstained from issu
ing its historically powerful executive slate endorsement in
this year's election cycle. This decision comes after a
marked decrease in the number of SOCC-endorsed
Undergraduate senators. Ten of the 15 senators elected in
2006 were SOCC endorsed; this number dropped to six sen
ators in last year's election.
"I do believe that SOCC's goals are universal, and every
one wants a diverse, tolerant campus," said ASSU
Executive candidate Priyanka Sharma '09, who indicated
that SOCC may have opted not to endorse an executive
slate because multiple candidates were equally supportive
of diversity initiatives. "They probably see all the slates as
competent and committed."
SOCC's decision not to support any executive slate may
make next week's elections more competitive and could
shift the focus of the campaign to personal contact with vot
ers, Sharma said.
"The ASSU is evolving where endorsements are part of
the process, hut are nut the heart of
the process," Sharma said. "1 see this
as a welcome change."
But SOCC's decision to abstain
from endorsing an executive slate
does not mean that all student
group followed the same path. Most
major groups that issued endorse
ments last year have continued to
endorse executive slates this year,
and SOCC has already endorsed
Senate candidates.
The Stanford Democrats decided
last night to endorse ASSU
Executive candidate Jonny Dorsey
'09 and running mate Fagan Harris
'09.
"They were the ones who articu
lated the best message as far as
helping political groups," said
Stanford Democrats political direc
tor Ashwin Mudaliar '09. "They also
took an untraditional approach to

their campaign: even though they
didn't have as much experience,
they had some great ideas about
what the ASSU can do."
Mudaliar recognized that his
group's endorsement has created
divisions in the ASSU in the past.
"Some of the Democratic
[endorsed] candidates definitely
grouped together [in the outgoing
Senate], and there were some issues
there." Mudaliar admitted.
In its first executive slate
endorsement. Students for a
Sustainable Stanford decided to
support Dorsey-Harris for its com
mitment to sustainability.
"We felt that all the slates defi
nitely were concerned," said John
Murlow '09. a member of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford. "We
thought Johnny and Fagan would
take it to the next level."
Candidates were evaluated by
the group on four main points —
campus events, student voice, eatery
compost programs and environ
mental knowledge. Most important
in the evaluation process was a

deep commitment to sustainability.
especially because most Stanford
students are at a minimum environ
mentally conscious, Murlow said.
"Johnny and Fagan really were
going to include sustainability in
everything that they did. and treat it
as an attitude, not a single issue,"
Murlow said. "We felt that for the
other candidates, it wasn't as seri
ous."
Dorsey-Harris was not the only
slate to garner prominent endorse
ments. Sharma and running mate
Jack Cackler '09 won the endorse
ments of the Inter-Fraternity
Council, the Queer Straight
Alliance and the Stanford Review.
Students Promoting Ethnic and
Cultural Kinship endorsed both
Dorsey-Harris and ASSU
Executive candidate Sagar Doshi
'09 and running mate Phillip Hon
10.
In lieu of official endorsements,
some organizations have pursued
different methods to promote their
agendas.
The Put the Student Back in

Student Union group has decided
to post relevant information about
candidates instead of backing a par
ticular slate.
"We are going to be listing can
didates who are very much interest
ed in renovating Old Union and
making it stronger overall." said
Kevin Webb '09. who started the
group. "We are going to ask ques
tions of them and post them up. We
are not going to endorse anyone."
Following last year's elections,
tension sparked between senators
endorsed by SOCC and those
endorsed by the Stanford Review.
But this year's executive candidates
are firm in saying that endorse
ments will not overshadow actual
campaigning or harm the day-to
day workings of the ASSU by creat
ing unnecessary partisanship.
"They [endorsements] are one
piece," Dorsey said. "They in no way
replace grassroots effort, but they
can help."
