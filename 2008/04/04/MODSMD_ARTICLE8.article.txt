## Prof. counters Basque president 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
More than a month after Basque President Joan Jose
Ibarretxe's controversial campus appearance, Joseba Arregi, a
professor of sociology at the University of Basque Country,
offered a rebuttal to Ibarretxe's support of Basque independ
ence.
Drawing on his personal story as a Basque citizen and a for
mer member of the Basque government, the professor dis
cussed his opposition to Basque independence ITiursday night
at Tresidder Union. Arregi argued that the complex identities
of Basque society make achieving complete independence
largely unpopular and unlikely.
"The Spanish Constitution answers to the complexity and
plurality of the Basque society, a complexity and a plurality
that makes it impossible for the Basque country to be inde
pendent." Arregi said. "For it would mean the exclusion of all
the Basque citizens who feel to be at the same time Basque
and Spanish or to be included without the recognition of its
difference in an entirely centralized state."
Arregi said the Basque controversy continues because a
minority of citizens is unwilling to accept the will of the major
ity. He said that the many visions of Basque society are best
served by an inclusive Spanish democracy.
"Democracy is about citizens, not about identities," Arregi
said. "The rights of citizenship are not bound to one religion,
to one ideology, to one political creed, to one linguistic or cul
tural identity."
"In the end," Arregi added,"the Basque conflict is, as it has
always been, a conflict among the Basques, a conflict between
freedom and imposition of unitary
visions of identity, of culture, of lan
guage."
Protestors of Ibarretxe's visit to
Stanford in February organized
Arregi's address as a counterpoint to
the Basque president's controversial
proposal for a referendum on Basque
independence.
I "We wanted to give an opportuni
: ty to the Stanford community to hear

more views on this controversial
topic," said graduate student Manuel
Franco, President of the Iberia-
Spanish Association, which sponsored
the event along with the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, the Graduate
School Council and the Foundation
for Freedom, a Spanish non-profit
organization.
Arregi, himself a longtime nation
alist, left the Basque government five
years ago when he decided he could
no longer work for an organization
that he said had "joined hands" with
EuskadiTa Askatasuna (ETA),a pro
independence terrorist organization.
"ETA is not willing to accept the

fact that the Basque society is a het
erogeneous and complex society,"
Arregi said. "In my opinion, there is
nothing to negotiate with ETA. There
is nothing to satisfy the ETA but the
destruction of the Spanish state, and
also the destruction of the nation state
system."
Cristina Munoz' 10, one of the few
undergraduates in attendance, said
she was impressed with Arregi's argu
ment.
"I thought President Ibarretxe's
speech was not substantial, and I
thought today's speech was logical,
effective and backed up by historical
examples," Munoz said. "I felt that

this guy was being frank."
Munoz said Ibarretxe had
refrained from answering some ques
tions posed by protestors of the Feb.
14 event but that Arregi fielded all
questions openly.
"Ibarretxe came to tell a dream,
and Mr. Arregi talked about what the
Basque country is," said Jose
Camporro, a community member
from outside Stanford who had
protested the Ibarretxe event. "For
me this is more realistic; more the way
we should be going."
