## All-girl band ready to rock 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Phi Kappa Psi's 18th annual Battle
of the Bands conies this Saturday, with
a new and unusual talent. For a band
that formed just last quarter, the
BlowUpDollz are making a splash.
Consisting of Liz Buck '09, Lauren
Palumhi '10, Kalena Masching '08 and
San Jose native Ashley Kinney, the
BlowUpDollz are the only all-girl rock
band competing in the event. Buck, the
guitarist, shares vocals with Palumbi.
Masching and Kinney play bass and
drums, respectively
"They have an interesting energy, [a]
stagemanship that leaves me really
excited," said Phi Psi member and
Battle of the Bands organizer John
Laxson '10.
"Liz is really good," said Pra
Chandrasoma '09, lead singer of com
peting band Occam's Razor. "She's got
a lot of energy, a lot of spirit. She's a
really passionate performer."
Other bands competing in Saturday
night's show are last year's winner.
Vice, Ampersand, Pluto Gang and
Occam's Razor. A newly formed band
right out of Phi Psi. Called Full Metal
Apocalypse, will be playing as the
judges make their decision.

While Buck admitted, "We're prob
ably not the best musicians on campus,"
she relished being the only girl rock
band.
"I think it's cool that we're finally
representing chick rockers," she said.
When people find out that Buck and
Palumbi are in an all-girl band, they
"get this kind of look," they said simul
taneously.
"Everyone just thinks the Donnas,"
Buck said. "It's definitely an image you
haven't seen in a while. We're bringing
it back. It's fresh. We have big makeup
and big hair —we definitely play it
up."
Students are aware of the
BlowUpDollz, but no one has had first
hand experience with the band.
"We have a lot of talk built up about
us right now because we're the all-girl
band " Buck said. "But our only audi
ence was the audition. We've never
even played on campus!"
The girls don't practice on campus,
either. Kalena's father has a recording
studio in his house, which emphasizes
Buck's belief that "everything was
fated."
"If we mess up. we just call Kalena's
dad to come fix it," Palumbi said, grin
ning. More seriously, she added: "We
have fun banter. Our rehearsals are

always really open."
Buck agreed. "If we mess up. it does
n't really matter. We have fun messing
with each other."
In fact, the girls have jokingly
assigned one another names. Buck calls
herself "Badass Doll," Palumbi is
"TimeßombDoll," Masching is
"Hyper Doll" and Kinney is
"Quiet Doll."
"I just love the name because we do
so much with it," Buck said. "We each
have our own little twist. And we defi
nitely have our own sound."
Fellow band member Palumbi, who

is fondly known as "Razz" to her band
mates, agreed.
"We play a lot in older style" she
said. "Not quite alternative rock."
Palumhi herself sports the electric
violin and feels tied down by having to
be plugged in. What makes the girls
unique to Battle of the Bands, besides
their genre and gender, are their
onstage tactics. Buck has custom picks
that she will throw into the audience,
and they've already planned out t-shirt
designs. On Saturday night, don't be

Lauren Palumbi '10 jams on her electric violin with her band the BlowUpDollz, the only all-female rock band competing in Phi Kappa Psi's 18th annu
al Battle of the Bands. The competition will be their first performance in front of campus audience when they take the stage on Saturday night.

The competition will likely showcase not only the BlowllpDollz's unique genre but
also their presence onstage, where the girls may perform moves to match their
music and throw custom guitar picks and blow-up dolls into the audience.
