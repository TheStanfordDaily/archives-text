p.--M Aleta Hayes
Lecturcr in Contemporary Dance and Performance
Wednesday, April 9
The CIRCLE, Common Room
Free and open to all!
Aleta Hayes holds an M.F.A. in Dance and Choreography from New York University's Tisch School of the
Arts and a 8.A., with Departmental Honors, in Drama, Dance and the Visual Arts from Stanford University (1991).
Before her appointment at Stanford, Ms. Hayes taught for eight years at Princeton University, in the Program in
Theater and Dance and the Program in African-American Studies. White at Princeton, she developed pedagogically
innovative courses that combined cultural and performance history, theory and performance.
Ms. Hayes lived and worked in New York City for fifteen years, choreographing solo and group dance pieces, in
which her performances often interpolated acting and singing. Highlights included Hatsheput, presented at the
Place Theater, London and St. Mark's Church, New York, Tarantantara, presented at Jacob's Pillow, and La
Chanteuse Nubienne (written by playwright Daniel Alexander Jones), performed for Movement Research at Judson
Church.
In 2004, Ms. Hayes returned to Stanford on a Ford Foundation Resident Dialogues Fellowship through the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, for which she created The Wedding Project, a performance piece of multiple
genres illustrating the evolution of American social dance through the narrative of African-American wedding
traditions. She extended this "theater of mixed forms" (the critic Anna KisselgofPs term) into community dialogue
when she was a 2005 Peninsula Community Foundation Artist-in-Residence at Eastside Preparatory School in East
Palo Alto. That residence culminated in "The ReMix Project," where she collaborated with students to create and
perform a montage of music, monologue, and movement examining student aspirations in a low-income, racially
mixed neighborhood.
What Matters to Me and Why is a discussion and lecture series that encourages reflection within
the Stanford community on matters of personal values, beliefs, and motivations.
Come discover what inspires and really matters to those who shape the university!
