Public school systems have historically separated the roles
of teachers and formal leaders. Teachers typically have few
substantive opportunities to exert leadership while principals
and superintendents are not expected to know how to teach
well. While this is now changing, this dichotomy of roles is still
widely followed and serves as a significant barrier to school
reform efforts.
