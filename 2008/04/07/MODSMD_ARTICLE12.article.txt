# RAUCOUS PROTESTS GREET OLYMPIC TORCH
## Anti-China protesters almost snuff flame in London torch relay 
### BRYAN MITCHELL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LONDON (AP) â€” Demonstrators
grabbed at the Olympic torch, blocked its
path and tried to snuff out its flame Sunday
in raucous protests of China's human rights
record that forced a string of last-second
changes to a chaotic relay through London.
The biggest protests since last month's
torch-lighting in Greece tarnished
China's hope for a harmonious prelude to
a Summer Games celebrating its rise as a
global power. Instead, the flame's 85.000-
mile journey from Greece to Beijing has
become a stage for activists decrying
China's recent crackdown on Tibetans
and support for Sudan despite civilian
deaths in Darfur.
Demonstrators attempted to board the
bus trailing the torch shortly after British
five-time gold medal rower Steve Redgrave
started the relay at Wembley Stadium.
Less than an hour later, a protester
slipped through a tight police cordon and
gripped the torch before he was thrown
to the ground and arrested.
"Before I knew what was happening
this guy had lurched toward me and was
grabbing the torch out of my hand and I
was determinedly clinging on." former
children's television host Konnie Huq told
British Broadcasting Corp. television.
Another demonstrator tried to snuff the
tlame with a spray of white powder from a
fire extinguisher, police said. Still others
threw themselves in the torch's path. They
were tackled or dragged off by police. Au
thorities said 37 people were arrested.
Beijing Olympics organizers called
protests an act of "sabotage."
Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Bei
jing Olympic organizing committee, said
he could not immediately comment on
the London protests.
London's Metropolitan police said

some 2,000 officers, on foot, motorcycles,
bikes, and on horseback tried to keep the
procession under control.
One group of Tibetan protesters was
corralled in metal barricades across from
Bloomsbury Square.
"It feels like we are restrained like a
sheep in a barn." said Passang Dolne, 27.
a Tibetan national who works as a nurse
in London. "It really hurts."
Chinese nationals about 100 yards
away were allowed to move freely as they
waved Chinese flags distributed by the
Chinese Embassy and the Bank of China.
The demonstration swelled near where
Chinese Ambassador Fu Ying was expect
ed to carry the torch. Frantic organizers
shuffled the order of participants and Fu
unexpectedly appeared in the heart of Chi
natown, jogging unhindered with the torch
before handing it to the next runner.
Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell later
said Britain was celebrating the Olympics,
not China's human rights record.
"The welcome of the Olympic torch to
London is not the same as condoning the
human rights regime in China or condoning
the treatment of Tibet." she told the BBC
There had been scattered protests be
fore the torch reached London, and more
are expected as the tlame moves on to
Paris, San Francisco and New Delhi.
Gayle Donsky, a spokeswoman for the
San Francisco Bay Area Darfur Coali
tion, said her group did not intend to dis
rupt the torch relay and was not calling
for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics.
Still, she said, activists see Wednes
day's upcoming relay along San Francis
co's waterfront as an unprecedented
chance to draw attention to China's al
leged complicity in the violence in Sudan.
