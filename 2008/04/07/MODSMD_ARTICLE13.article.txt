Mark Penn. the pollster and senior strate
gist for Hillary Rodham Clinton's presi
dential bid, left the campaign Sunday
after it was disclosed he met with repre
sentatives of the Colombian government
to help promote a free trade agreement
Clinton opposes.
"After the events of the last few days.

Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as
chief strategist of the Clinton Campaign."
campaign manager Maggie Williams said
in a statement released Sunday. "Mark,
and Penn.Schoen and Berland Associates,
Inc. will continue to provide polling and
advice to the campaign."
Communications director Howard
Wolfson and pollster Geoff Garin will di
rect the campaign's message and strategic
efforts for the campaign going forward.
Williams said.

Penn has been a lightning rod for con
troversy throughout the campaign and
managed to retain considerable influence
in the operation almost solely because of
the candidate's loyalty to him. He was
known to get into angry shouting match
es with other members of Clinton's team,
including longtime adviser Harold Ickes
and media strategist Mandy Grunwald,
who often disagreed with his strategic ad
vice and resented his unchecked authori
ty to design the candidate's message.

It was the second major departure of a
Clinton campaign official this year. In
February. Patti Solis Doyle stepped down
as campaign manager and was replaced
by Williams.
Penn pushed Clinton to adopt a
meat-and-potatoes, issue-based cam
paign that stressed her "strength and ex
perience" but managed to overlook vot
ers' desire for fundamental political
change, which rival Barack Obama was
able to capture.
