## Discrimination inquiry ends 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A nine-year investigation into discrimination at

Stanford, which had left the University in sus
pense since the complaint was filed in 1999, final
ly came to a close, Stanford officials declared
Wednesday. Ihe Department of Labor (DOL)

completed its review without finding
evidence to back the accusations

against the University.
Stanford issued a press release
announcing the decision, stating, "The
Department of Labor reported to

Stanford that none of the individual
complaints investigated resulted in a

finding of discrimination or retaliation, nor was
there any evidence of any systemic discrimination
in the university's policies and practices in the

areas of initial appointments, promo
tion, termination, work environment or
compensation."

Ilie investigation was set in motion
in 1999 by a class-action complaint

from sixteen female scholars at Stanford, and it proceeded
on two parallel tracks: an examination of possible gender
discrimination in specific cases, and a general compliance
review of the University. Government regulations dictate
that any class-action complaint should trigger a compliance
review if one has not been conducted in the last two years.
Since the case officially opened, the set of plaintiffs has
evolved â€” some complainants joined and others dropped
out, leaving only five by the investigation's close. Seven
related complaints were not addressed as part of the

inquiry due to issues of jurisdiction.
ITie investigation came to a close in December 2007,
according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The DOL found
that there was not discrimination in the case of the specific

complaints, and determined that there was insufficient
evidence for any judgment, positive or negative, in the

case of the University at large.
Interest in the investigation rose due to the possi

bility of Stanford's government funding
being placed in jeopardy.The DOL. indi-

cated. however, that potential sanc
tions would have been less dras-

tic. and would have focused on
compensation for acts of dis
crimination.

"We would not have been
looking at taking away fund
ing." said Deanne Amaden, a

spokesperson for the
Department of Labor's San

Francisco office. "That's an
extreme case." In this case, she

said,"We would remedy the situa
tion through back-pay, and negoti
ating to get [complainants] a posi

tion equal to what they would have had."
Ihe length of the nine-year investiga
tion also drew attention. The DOL

believed the length of the investigation stemmed mostly
from the complications of reviewing practices at an aca
demic institution, and some difficulties in gathering infor
mation.
