## Discrimination inquiry ends 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A nine-year investigation into discrimination at

Stanford, which had left the University in sus
pense since the complaint was filed in 1999, final
ly came to a close, Stanford officials declared
Wednesday. Ihe Department of Labor (DOL)

completed its review without finding
evidence to back the accusations

against the University.
Stanford issued a press release
announcing the decision, stating, "The
Department of Labor reported to

Stanford that none of the individual
complaints investigated resulted in a

finding of discrimination or retaliation, nor was
there any evidence of any systemic discrimination
in the university's policies and practices in the

areas of initial appointments, promo
tion, termination, work environment or
compensation."

Ilie investigation was set in motion
in 1999 by a class-action complaint

from sixteen female scholars at Stanford, and it proceeded
on two parallel tracks: an examination of possible gender
discrimination in specific cases, and a general compliance
review of the University. Government regulations dictate
that any class-action complaint should trigger a compliance
review if one has not been conducted in the last two years.
Since the case officially opened, the set of plaintiffs has
evolved — some complainants joined and others dropped
out, leaving only five by the investigation's close. Seven
related complaints were not addressed as part of the

inquiry due to issues of jurisdiction.
ITie investigation came to a close in December 2007,
according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The DOL found
that there was not discrimination in the case of the specific

complaints, and determined that there was insufficient
evidence for any judgment, positive or negative, in the

case of the University at large.
Interest in the investigation rose due to the possi

bility of Stanford's government funding
being placed in jeopardy.The DOL. indi-

cated. however, that potential sanc
tions would have been less dras-

tic. and would have focused on
compensation for acts of dis
crimination.

"We would not have been
looking at taking away fund
ing." said Deanne Amaden, a

spokesperson for the
Department of Labor's San

Francisco office. "That's an
extreme case." In this case, she

said,"We would remedy the situa
tion through back-pay, and negoti
ating to get [complainants] a posi

tion equal to what they would have had."
Ihe length of the nine-year investiga
tion also drew attention. The DOL

believed the length of the investigation stemmed mostly
from the complications of reviewing practices at an aca
demic institution, and some difficulties in gathering infor
mation.

"The length was unusual,"
Amaden sad. "But it's legitimate to
say that it's more complex when
you're doing this with a university,
and looking at something like the
tenure process. There was also some
resistance initially, in obtaining docu
ments and data."
The withdrawal of many of the ini
tial complainants from the case, many
early on in the investigation, also hin
dered efforts to collect information.
"1 think that a lot of the informa
tion went with each specific com
plaint," Amaden said. "When people
dropped out, we were no longer get
ting information, and everything we
needed."
The investigation began at a time
when interest in discrimination at
Stanford was high—just following
the publication in 1999 of "Walking
Out on the Boys," a book dealing with
issues of gender discrimination in
higher education. Its writer, Frances

Conley, was a former professor at the
Stanford Medical School who had
retired partially due to concern over
gender issues. Conley has since
returned to Stanford, and is an
Emeritus Professor at the Medical
School.
The investigation found instances
of wrongdoing at Stanford only in
areas of data collection. The
University's general counsel, Debra
Zumwalt, said that these complaints
led to improvements in the
University's internal tracking of facul
ty hiring and issues of diversity.
"One of the violations had to do
with how we go about getting the
information, including identification
of gender and ethnicity," Zumwalt
said. "We've since set up systems to
better track the information. There's
now a standardized process for col
lecting the data."
"Second, it wasn't clear who had
overall responsibility for monitoring
these issues," she said, "so we created
the Diversity & Access Office."
Since the beginning of the investi
gation Stanford has also coordinated
with other schools in gathering infor
mation. The University shares num

bers with the "MIT 9" consortium,
and it participates in data exchange
with the Association of American
Universities. This information is kept
confidential.
"In the early 2000s we conducted our
own survey, cooperating with dozens
of peer institutions." said Vice Provost
of Faculty Development and
Diversity Patricia Jones. "We collect
ed that and looked at it specifically for
benchmark purposes."
24.5 percent of Stanford faculty
are women, according to information
gathered for the annual presentation
from the Provost's office to the
Faculty Senate on diversity. While
data from that report will be given in
more detail in May, administrators
reported that they were pleased with
the University's progress and happy
that the investigation has drawn to a
close.
"We're thrilled that it's finally over
after nine years," Jones said. "A lot of
people put in a lot of time on looking
at the data, and we're pleased at the
finding."

"In the early 2000s we conducted our
own survey, cooperating with dozens
of peer institutions." said Vice Provost
of Faculty Development and
Diversity Patricia Jones. "We collect
ed that and looked at it specifically for
benchmark purposes."
24.5 percent of Stanford faculty
are women, according to information
gathered for the annual presentation
from the Provost's office to the
Faculty Senate on diversity. While
data from that report will be given in
more detail in May, administrators
reported that they were pleased with
the University's progress and happy
that the investigation has drawn to a
close.
"We're thrilled that it's finally over
after nine years," Jones said. "A lot of
people put in a lot of time on looking
at the data, and we're pleased at the
finding."
