### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The fix-it Web site, used by stu
dents to submit requests for hous
ing repairs, has undergone signifi
cant re-development. The new site,
to be launched today, will feature
an improved user interface as well
as tools to cancel fix-it requests

and view a history of all submitted
requests.
4> [We] wanted to improve on
usability and functionality of the
existing Web site," said Rodger
Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing. "[We also want
ed to] enhance the back office
operations for staff in support of
the fix-it program."
Imogen Hinds, associate direc
tor of Student Housing, said that
with the upgraded Web site, stu
dents will be able to cancel a fix-it
and check on the status of pending
requests. They will also be able to

view a history of all fix-its they
have submitted for their current
room.
"Students will have more choic
es to submit a problem for external
areas such as the basketball court,"
she said. "We will also be provid
ing an easier way for students to
get to their common areas to sub
mit problems for those areas.
Students will also be able to sub
mit a fix-it for a building."
Michael VanFossen. associate
director of Student Housing,
explained that in the current fix-it
site version, which was rolled out
in September 2007, Student
Housing enhanced the fix-it appli
cations so that they were routed
to the appropriate work group
based on the problem selected.
"This was a significant
enhancement and made the fix-it
process more efficient from start
to finish," he said. "With this new
upgrade, staff will have an easier
mechanism to communicate with
students directly regarding their
fix-it."
While the Web site will only be
down for a few minutes when the
switchover from the old version to
the new version occurs. Hinds said
that students should contact their
Housing Front Desk Coordinator
if the Web site goes down.
