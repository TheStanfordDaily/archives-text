## Editorial Board GO GO Gobaud Goldgof for ASSU Executive 
### 
After half-hour interviews with five of
the six ASSU Executive slates and
more than an hour of subsequent de
liberation. the Editorial Board believes that
David Gobaud and Greg Goldgof are the
candidates that will best represent the entire
student body during the 2008-2009 school
year. All candidates interviewed were im
pressive and brought good ideas to the table,
but Gobaud and Goldgof stood out from the
array of exciting Executive slates because of
their focus on graduate student issues, their
idea-oriented campaign and their well-re
searched platform.
Gobaud and Goldgof.current seniors who
will be co-terming next year, are the first all
graduate student slate in many years. It was
clear that this slate had actively strived to un
derstand both graduate and undergraduate
concerns, as illustrated in the pair's social and
student-life platforms. For undergraduate
students, they want to set up a "social shuttle,"
which will run from GovCo to Mirrielees on
the weekends to make it easier to get around
campus late at night, and they want to organ
ize a Beer-B-Q on the row as an alternative
social event to the typical frat party. For grad
uate students, they want to set up graduate
student speed dating, introduce new grad-stu
dent events like a dinner on the quad for mas
ters students and transform The 750 bar into
a real hang-out space for grad students.
Their detail-oriented platform extends
beyond social and student-life ideas. ITiey
presented a concrete plan on how to increase
diversity among graduate students and facul
ty based on the undergraduate section-lead
ing model currently used by the Computer
Science Department. They also are well-re
searched about the feasibility of much of
their platform, having conducted many inter
views with members of the administration
about the ideas they seek to implement next
year. One such idea is to have students keep
their @stanford.edu addresses for life; they
had already looked into the concept and
think that it will cost about 10 cents per ad
dress to maintain the necessary storage
space.
During their campaign, Gobaud and
Goldgof have already experimented with
better ways to reach students. Since many
students spend much of their time on their
computers, their campaigning has focused on
using You Tube and Facebook to reach vot
ers. They hope to carry this over into their

term as executives by using Facebook polls
and applications to increase accountability
and feedback. Another major issue on their
platform is reforming the underutilized
ASSU Web site, as well as other official sites
like Axess, to make them more useful to stu
dents. We believe the team is especially well
positioned to accomplish these goals because
of their technical academic background and
their experience developing projects such as
the Stanford GER Treasure Hunter.
But Gobaud and Goldgof are not the only
qualified candidates. We were particularly
impressed by the experience and ideas of
Jonny Dorsey and Fagan Harris. Dorsey and
Harris are both charismatic and personable
and would bring these assets to the executive
position. Dorsey also has an unusual amount
of executive experience having stopped out
for two years to found and become the first
Executive Director of FACE AIDS, a non
profit group that is now represented on over
150 campuses nationwide. The skills and
knowledge that he gained from this experi
ence would be invaluable in the ASSU Exec
utive position.
The Dorsey-Harris slate has focused its
campaign on some other notable issues.
Mental health concerns of graduate and un
dergraduate students is one of the pair's top
priorities; they believe that the suicides on
campus last year are an indication that even
more work needs to be done. Dorsey and
Harris have also run a sustainable and sweat
free campaign, using all-recycled paper and
buying sweat-free t-shirts at considerable ex
pense, and they hope to carry this mindset
over to actual ASSU governance. Also, they
want to use SSE, the business branch of the
ASSU, to buy recyclable red cups in bulk so
that student groups and houses can buy them
at lower prices, encouraging sustainability
despite the relative expense.The team would
also have a "green party/event" label that
they could attach to events on campus to en
courage more sustainable practices amongst
students.
The prospects for the ASSU seem prom
ising as an unusual number of qualified, in
teresting and worthy slates are running to oc
cupy its executive office next year. However,
Gobaud and Goldgof will be in a unique po
sition as co-terms to understand both under
graduate and graduate concerns. Specifically,
