## Hair today, gone tomorrow 
### 
Over spring break, I embarked on a jour
ney of self, a journey to a place unknown
to me for years. And when 1 returned, I
had lost almost a foot of hair.
Ihat's right, kids. Natalie got a haircut.
The experience of cutting my hair and the re
sulting onslaught of comments got me thinking
about how strangely important hair is.Through
out time, hair has performed many functions. A
social indicator. A marker of our mortality. And
what about the incredible range of ethnic, reli
gious and gender implications associated with
hair? Short of make-up and, well, plastic sur
gery. changing our hair is maybe the most dra
matic way we can change our appearance. 1 hate
to admit it. but those dead cells dancing on our
scalp have meaning.
Even more than its anthropological implica
tions, our hair holds a personal history for each
of us. The bowl cuts your mom gave you in the
backyard.The ornate up-dos you got for prom.
The drastic color change or chop that marked a
new stage of life.
I first realized the emotional magnitude of a
haircut at the age of six when my mom. an avid
fan of short hair, decided to rid me of my long
locks. After she had completed the cut. my fa
ther took one look at me and said. "What did
you do to her!? She looks like a boy." I lis com
ment, coupled with the teasing of some boys in
my kindergarten class on my first day with my
new do back at sch(x>l,propelled my decision to
wear a h(xxlie to sch<x)l for the rest of the year.
With the h<xxl up. Every single day.
From that point forward. I maintained a re
spectable chin-length bob with not-so-re
spectable curtain bangs until the summer be
fore fifth grade, when I decided to go really
short again â€” this time of my own volition. I
had just moved from California to Florida and
was starting at a new sch(x>l.so it seemed like a
gtxxl time to change things up.
In retrospect, cutting my hair super short
and augmenting my thcn-slightly androgy
nous. late-bl(x)ming self was probably not the
best action to take before embarking on the
most socially vicious year of my life. I got
teased by some smart-ass boys whom I proba
bly had crushes on and judged by the girls who
were already wearing make-up and had way
more Scrunchies on their wrists than they real
ly needed.

Unfortunately, I couldn't hide inside a htxxl
ie that time around because Florida was too
damn hot, and 1 was no longer at the age where
that kind of habit wouldn't elicit a strange par
ent-teacher conference. Fortunately, the short
hair made me more resilient.
When my hair magically turned curly the
summer before high school, I realized that the
only way it would survive the disgusting humid
ity would be to grow it out, and 1 became the girl
with the long, curly hair. At Stanford, I flirted
with the idea of cutting it several times, but I al
ways chickened out, coming back with one of
those healthy trims that no one ever notices.
Most of my friends always seemed averse to my
mention of going short, anyway. And I was even
more attached than they were. It had become
the flag of my disposition, and I wasn't ready to
tear the flag down. Change is scary, even, if not
especially, for a pretty low-maintenance indi
vidual.
When I returned to Florida for spring break
two weeks ago. I decided this would be the time
1 would finally get a real haircut. I didn't want
my loved ones sending me to Oprah in the fu
ture because I hadn't cut my hair in 20years,and
they no longer wanted a relative who looked
like Cousin Itt. And I didn't want people (name
ly myself) defining me by my hair any longer.
I thought I was ready until my hairdresser
held a ruler to my head and asked me if I was
willing to go short enough to donate. I hesitated
and then remembered the many bald women I
had encountered as I waited with my mom for
her oncologists' appointments when she had
had breast cancer years ago. For many of these
women, who are among the strongest and most
beautiful individuals I have ever met, picking
out a wig was one of the only ways they could
control their situation and appearance so that
they could feel and l<x>k healthy. My hair would
mean so much more to them than it has ever
