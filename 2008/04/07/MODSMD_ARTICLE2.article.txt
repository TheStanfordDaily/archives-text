# ASSU: UP CLOSE & PERSONAL
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily (TSI)): You both have
done some very impressive things with public
service. Why the decision to pursue an ASSU
office more known for distributing bike lights
and planning parties?
Jonny Dorsey (Jl)): Historically the ASSU
has done very important things. When 1 got in
to Stanford. 1 was told the story of Steve
Westly. ASSU Executive in '78, who used his
platform to divest from South Africa because
of apartheid . . . But don't get me wrong —
the bike lights are important, the shuttle serv
ice is great. These things aren't mutually
exclusive. We also think the ASSU can play a
bigger role. A lot of my friends graduated in
'07, and were funneled into consulting and I-
Banking, because of the CDC. That made me
very upset. 1 love the Haas center, but they
have 6 post-grad fellowships ... If Stanford
had a mission statement — it would be to ere-

ate leaders for a better good.
TSI): Is your campaign defined by
public service?
Jl): No. We want to engage the
broader student body. " That
requires working on the bigger
issues that get them engaged. More
important is working with stu
dents, and working with the broad
er administration and the trustees.
It's creating a structure making
sure that the student voice is pow
erful.
TSI): A lot of the executive slates
have similar platforms. What sets
your platform apart?
FH: It's also important to make the
distinction between process and
content. There are similarities with
content. But with process, what we
are proposing is a complete depar
ture from the way the ASSU runs.
Right now we have 20 percent
really engaged in the ASSU. That
leaves 80 percent of the students
who don't care.
TSI): How are you going to mobi

lize that 80 percent?
Jl): We have 145 people working
on the campaign so far. That's not
something we are going to stop. We
are going to keep them engaged,
and expand them. We are working
to inspire people to care.
TSD: Other slates, particularly
Gobaud-Goldgof, have been very
specific in detailing their plat
forms. Why have you chosen to he
more vague?
Jl): A lot of this has to do with our
philosophy of involving a lot of
people. We think the best way is
doing a big strategic planning
process — getting everyone in the
room who cares. We will never
have better ideas for pushing for
ward sustainability than the
Students for Sustainable Stanford.
FH: It comes back to process vs.
content. Others have great con
tent, but what sets us apart is great
process. Process really makes the
difference.
TSD: Neither of you have student
government backgrounds. How
will this allect your campaign, and
if elected, your tenure as execu
tives?
JD: We talked to (ASSU President]

Hershey about it. He said you'd
have a learning curve first quarter,
and then it would be alright. It's on
us to prove we can do a good job.
You build out a cabinet.
FH: We need some great ASSU
people. We sat down with Andy
Lomeli '09. We are going to have
that insider knowledge. 12 of 15
senators are going to be new. There
is a great moment right now to
bring new perspective to the
ASSU.
TSI): The ASSU is famous for grid
lock and division. How will you
overcome that?
.ID: This year, the executive and
undergraduate senate didn't work
together very much. Even if it's
hard, and unpleasant, we are going
to work very hard to make sure we
are all working together. We are
also going work with the adminis
tration and the trustees.
FH: There's no accountability.
There's a lot of division, but that's
superficial. That can be done
away with; it's all about the
process. We bring an average stu
dent perspective. This stuff is not
revolutionary.
