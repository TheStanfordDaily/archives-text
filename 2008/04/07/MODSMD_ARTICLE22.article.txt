# LITTLE MISS MODERN
## Shapes and structures 
### 
Sydney Pollack's 2005 film "Sketches of
Frank Gehry," based on the method
ologies of our nation's most famous
living architect, offers an interesting
process for architectural design. First, care
fully assemble crumpled aluminum foil and
corrugated cardboard into a visually com
pelling sculpture. Next, digitally capture
the creation with a 3D scanner (or have
your underpaid minions do it for you). Fi
nally, scale up the digital model and spend
months scratching your head over how to
make the damn thing work in a world that
is lamentably dominated by gravity, weath
er and people who would like to occupy the
spaces inside.
In some cases, all this admirable head
scratching is nevertheless insufficient. Last
fall. MIT sued Frank's office because he
designed a building for them that cost
about $300 million and leaked like a colan
der. Some Gehry fans protested that minor
nuisances like water damage are a small
price to pay for the incalculable beauty and
avant-garde innovativeness of a Gehry de
sign. Unfortunately for Frank, however,
when you are paid to complete a job as a
technical professional, you can't legally
throw up your hands and play the I'm-just
a-crumply-aluminum-foil-artist card.
One lesson from this outrageously ex
pensive mess of balled-up paper sculptures
and leak-based litigation is that this might
not be the best way to go about the process
of designing buildings. Just because mod
ern technology allows us to build identical
replicas of unrefined sketch models does

not mean that we should The architectural
value of these buildings' whimsy and nov
elty is overwhelmed by their mediocre
functionality. With leaky roofs, awkward
spaces, uncomfortable solar exposure and
ridiculous circulation, these structures
quickly become like that tiresome acquain
tance you meet at parties — initially spark
ly, fun and attractive, but soon revealed as
an exasperating attention whore who is
likely to get drunk and vomit on your fa
vorite shirt.
No one likes a vomity shirt, and thank
fully, we don't have to put up with one. Yes,
beautiful modern architecture also comes
in the sober, intelligent variety — the kind
that delights in addressing those boring
practical problems. In deciding which fac
tors will influence a building's form, priori
tizing a resemblance to a blob of aluminum
and paper is just as bad as mimicking an op
pressive historical style. Neither of these
approaches has anything do to with the
modern human beings who are to live in
the architecture being designed.
However, when a designer creates a
building shape through considerations of
how her building is going to support itself

and nurture its occupants, non-leaky and
stunning forms can result. Nature knows
this well — the breathtaking elegance of a
tree's form results from an optimization of
force distribution and energy collection.
The shape of our own skeleton is similarly
efficient and handsome. There are many
exquisite applications of this concept in the
building world, including Saarinen's Dulles
Airport terminal in Washington DC, the
work of Uruguayan architect Eladio Di
este, with structures designed by Polish en
gineer Waclaw Zalewski.
Like Gehry's buildings, these projects
feature dramatic curves and exciting, unex
pected geometries, but their innovative
shapes come from a deep understanding of
structural forces rather than an arbitrary
exercise in aesthetic sculpture. As a result,
unlike Gehry's buildings, these projects
tend to work. ITiey are modest in their ma
terials usage and costs because their forms
are structurally efficient, and they general
ly withstand the other rigors of reality, such
as weather and people, with far more grace
because attention was also devoted to
these areas.
While this approach to building design
has recently been overshadowed by the
flashier, trendier styles represented by
hrank Gehry and his like-minded peers, the
architectural community is beginning to
push back. The necessity of environmental
responsibility has shaken us from our
dreamy haze of wasteful excess, and techni-

cally masterful architectural solu

prove that efficiency need not be

boring. And the more clients (that
would be you. future wealthy Stan
ford graduates) hold their archi
tects accountable for visual impact
and impressive functionality, the
better our built environment will
become.
If you'd like to learn more about
these ideas, 1 strongly encourage

you to visit a new exhibition featur
ing the work of Waclaw Zalewski
on the second floor of the recently
opened Y2E2 building's red atri
um. Additionally, a public lecture
on Zalewski's work and creativity
in structural engineering will be
given this evening by the exhibi

opening — it should be thought
