## Puting the student back in student union 
### 
I recently began a Facelxxik group called "Put
the Student Back in Student Union." As with
most people I have talked to, when I first
walked around Old Union I was excited —
there were nice meeting rooms, comfortable
spaces, and. best of all, late night grilled cheese
sandwiches. Mostly, however. I couldn't shake
the distinct feeling that it could have been so
much more.
Amidst all the rumors of arcades, big screens
and a bowling alley, how could I not be a little dis
appointed when there weren't any? 1 began to
see Old Union as an opportunity lost; when it
could have been a space designed to bring peo
ple together, instead small groups of people sit in
hxxiths, small groups of people meet in rooms
and small groups of people study on the couch
es.
And that is why 1 started the Facebook
group. 1 wanted to tell people about ASSU can

didates who support installing pool tables, who
want to put in TVs big enough so that 6th Man
can watch away games, who will do whatever it
takes to make Old Union (or possibly TVesidder)
a place to hang out and meet new people.
I readily acknowledge that Old Union is
gcxxl for reasons I don't think I need to list. A lot
of creative, hardworking people designed it and
continue to work hard to make it feel like a part
of campus.
But among students, there is no sense of own
ership of Old Union. Yes, the Axe and Palm is
convenient, but no one voted to replace the
CoHo with it. Yes, the couches are comfy, but
would most students want to see them used for
doing schoolwork? And yes. the space in Old
Union is used efficiently and productively, but
who said that we wanted Old Union to be pro
ductive?
ITiis election is a chance for us to make Old

Union our own. We can elect people who want
to keep it as is. or we can elect people who want
to make it the hangout I personally would love
to see. And that is why I have made "Put the Stu
dent Back in Student Union." Rather than en
dorse candidates, I have asked them to give us
their ideas and their plans for the space so you
can make your own decisions.
So please, vote for the candidates whose Stu
dent Union views most reflect your own. For my
part, I hope you want our Student Union to he
lively and exciting, but then, I'm only one person,
lb truly have a Student Union we can take pride
in, we'll all need to be heard.

Union reform, the way they want to do it and
