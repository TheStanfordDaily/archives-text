## DEVILS DOWNED No. 13 Stanford hands ASU its first series loss of'08 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal was faced with a devil of a
difficulty this weekend, as the top-ranked
baseball team in the nation. Arizona State,
took to the road for the first time this year to
battle Stanford in a three-game set at Sunken
Diamond.
And while Stanford arms shut down per
haps the Pac-10's most potent lineup. Cardi
nal bats came alive at the plate as the team
took two of three from the Sun Devils. The
weekend was highlighted by Mark Mar
quess' 1300 th victor}' as head coach at Stan
ford.
Asked about the pair of wins in the series
which moved him into tenth place in the
NCAA career wins rankings for coaches.
Marquess acknowledged the achievement
but shifted a great deal of the credit to his
players.
'it's nice." he said. "But it just means I've
been coaching a long time and have had a lot
of good players. I'm happy with that."
The No. 13 Cardinal (15-9,4-2 Pac-10) re
mained perfect in weekend games after

dropping its Friday night opener against the
Sun Devils (28-3,4-2), as a flood of runs led to
wins in the second and third games of the se
ries by the combined score of 22-4.
Saturday's game two saw Stanford senior
Erik Davis put forth his second complete
game effort in as many starts, limiting Ari
zona State to a pair of runs on four hits.
Davis' efforts gave the Cardinal a solid foun
dation while junior Sean Ratliff s bat led the
Stanford offense with a 2-4 effort, hitting a
homerun while scoring three runs and driv
ing in four en route to a 12-2 victory.
Stanford's offense, which has taken a sig
nificant step forward so far in 2008 — scoring
6.79 runs per game as opposed to last year's
mark of 6.41 —complemented the pitching
well all weekend.Though the team is without
last year's biggest threat. Michael Taylor,
solid play from top to bottom has been key to
the squad's improvement this year.
"1 just think we've had a lot of production
up and down the lineup," junior left fielder
Joey August said. "Especially the young guys
— Schlander. Jones — those are the type of
guys that have come up with huge hits and
they did it again [Sunday] in the late innings
with some really big insurance runs.The thing
is just the consistency up and down the line
up. we know we don't have to rely on just a
few guys and 1 think that makes us more re
laxed when we're in there."

GAME NOTES: The No. 13 Cardinal will be
sure to move up in the rankings after taking
two out of three from the No. 1 Sun Devils
this weekend. Stanford remained perfect in
weekend games, winning Saturday's and
Sunday's contests, but needs to shore up its
record in mid-week games if it hopes to re
main at a higher ranking for long. The Car
dinal's first opportunities to do just that will
come this week against Cal and UC-Davis
before Stanford heads north to take on the
defending national champion Beavers in
Corvallis, Ore.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Erik Davis shutdown the highly potent Arizona State offense Saturday, tossing a complete game against
the nation's No. 1 ranked team. In all, the Cardinal allowed the Sun Devils just 10 runs in the series.
Sunday's story was another big
step forward for the Cardinal offense,
which burst out with a big fifth inning
rally for six runs, which was all Stan
ford would need for an eventual 10-2
victory. August's efforts played a big
role in propelling the Cardinal to that
decisive lead, as he led off the inning
with a single and later drove in two
with an RBI double.
"It was exciting, it was huge," Au
gust said of the Stanford fifth. "Our
coaches always say that you've got to
try to avoid the big inning on defense
and try to produce the big inning on
offense, and a lot of times you score
more runs in one inning than the other
team scores in the whole game. There
were a lot of huge hits for us with two
outs just to keep the rally going. It was
great to be a part of it."

After sophomore starter Jeff
Inman spent the first five innings con
stantly pitching his way into and out of
dangerous situations, allowing 13 men
on base but only two runs, junior lefty
Blake I lancock came in and slammed
the door shut, allowing only one
haserunner over the next four innings.
"My hat's off to our pitching staff."
August said. "They're the reason why
we won this weekend."
Stanford's only loss of the series
came in extra innings on Friday night,
as junior Ike Davis of ASU put on a
one-man show to topple the Cardinal
6-4 in ten innings. Davis, hatting sec
ond. followed Jason Kipnis' leadoff
single with a two-run shot in the top of
the first to put the Sun Devils on top
early. Solid relief work from senior
David Stringer, who pitched 6.1 in
nings allowing only two runs, helped
pull the Cardinal even by the sixth in
ning.
But Davis moved from first base to
pitch for Arizona State in the seventh
in the first of two stints on the mound.

striking out four while not allowing a
single runner to reach base in 2.2 total
innings of work.
Still, on the whole, the series was a
huge statement for a Cardinal team
trying to find consistency.
"It's a huge statement," Davis said
of the series win. "We've been doing
really well on the weekends so far but
we've kind of stubbed our toes in mid
week games, so we need to see if we
can get rid of those losses in the mid
week. But we're a good team and
we're going to come out battling every
game."
Next up for the Cardinal is a non
conference game against Pac-10 rival
California in Berkeley today before a
game against UC-Davis on Wednes
day at 6 p.m. Then, after facing the na
tion's top-ranked team in Arizona
State, Stanford will travel to Corvallis.
Ore. to take on the two-time defend
ing national champion Beavers.

The Cardinal was faced with a devil of a
difficulty this weekend, as the top-ranked
baseball team in the nation. Arizona State,
took to the road for the first time this year to
battle Stanford in a three-game set at Sunken
Diamond.
And while Stanford arms shut down per
haps the Pac-10's most potent lineup. Cardi
nal bats came alive at the plate as the team
took two of three from the Sun Devils. The
weekend was highlighted by Mark Mar
quess' 1300 th victor}' as head coach at Stan
ford.
Asked about the pair of wins in the series
which moved him into tenth place in the
NCAA career wins rankings for coaches.
Marquess acknowledged the achievement
but shifted a great deal of the credit to his
players.
'it's nice." he said. "But it just means I've
been coaching a long time and have had a lot
of good players. I'm happy with that."
The No. 13 Cardinal (15-9,4-2 Pac-10) re
mained perfect in weekend games after

dropping its Friday night opener against the
Sun Devils (28-3,4-2), as a flood of runs led to
wins in the second and third games of the se
ries by the combined score of 22-4.
Saturday's game two saw Stanford senior
Erik Davis put forth his second complete
game effort in as many starts, limiting Ari
zona State to a pair of runs on four hits.
Davis' efforts gave the Cardinal a solid foun
dation while junior Sean Ratliff s bat led the
Stanford offense with a 2-4 effort, hitting a
homerun while scoring three runs and driv
ing in four en route to a 12-2 victory.
Stanford's offense, which has taken a sig
nificant step forward so far in 2008 — scoring
6.79 runs per game as opposed to last year's
mark of 6.41 —complemented the pitching
well all weekend.Though the team is without
last year's biggest threat. Michael Taylor,
solid play from top to bottom has been key to
the squad's improvement this year.
"1 just think we've had a lot of production
up and down the lineup," junior left fielder
Joey August said. "Especially the young guys
— Schlander. Jones — those are the type of
guys that have come up with huge hits and
they did it again [Sunday] in the late innings
with some really big insurance runs.The thing
is just the consistency up and down the line
up. we know we don't have to rely on just a
few guys and 1 think that makes us more re
laxed when we're in there."

GAME NOTES: The No. 13 Cardinal will be
sure to move up in the rankings after taking
two out of three from the No. 1 Sun Devils
this weekend. Stanford remained perfect in
weekend games, winning Saturday's and
Sunday's contests, but needs to shore up its
record in mid-week games if it hopes to re
main at a higher ranking for long. The Car
dinal's first opportunities to do just that will
come this week against Cal and UC-Davis
before Stanford heads north to take on the
defending national champion Beavers in
Corvallis, Ore.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Erik Davis shutdown the highly potent Arizona State offense Saturday, tossing a complete game against
the nation's No. 1 ranked team. In all, the Cardinal allowed the Sun Devils just 10 runs in the series.
Sunday's story was another big
step forward for the Cardinal offense,
which burst out with a big fifth inning
rally for six runs, which was all Stan
ford would need for an eventual 10-2
victory. August's efforts played a big
role in propelling the Cardinal to that
decisive lead, as he led off the inning
with a single and later drove in two
with an RBI double.
"It was exciting, it was huge," Au
gust said of the Stanford fifth. "Our
coaches always say that you've got to
try to avoid the big inning on defense
and try to produce the big inning on
offense, and a lot of times you score
more runs in one inning than the other
team scores in the whole game. There
were a lot of huge hits for us with two
outs just to keep the rally going. It was
great to be a part of it."
