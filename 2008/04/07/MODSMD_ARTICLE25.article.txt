GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women snapped their
two game losing streak Sunday against the Huskies,
riding a strong Missy Penna complete game to a 3-
1 victory yesterday in Seattle. Stanford's slate of
conference matchups will continue this weekend as
the Cardinal welcomes Oregon and Oregon State
to the farm for three games, in total, against their ri
vals to the north.

After dropping their first two games of the
weekend, the Stanford Softball team collected
its first Pacific 10 conference victory Sunday
with a 3-1 victory over the host Washington
Huskies.
The win broke a five-game losing streak to
start the Pac-10 season for the Cardinal, includ
ing losses to UCLA on Friday and to the same
Huskies on Saturday.

After cruising through the non-conference
season with a record of 33-2. the Cardinal hats
had slowed in recent weeks. On Sunday, howev
er. Stanford got a clutch two RBI double in the
top of the fourth off the bat of freshman first
baseman Melissa Koutz to give it the lead for
good.
The Cardinal tacked on an insurance run an
inning later when senior left fielder Tricia Ag
gabao hustled home from third on a Caitlin
Noble wild pitch.
Starting her third game in a row.junior Missy
Penna gave Stanford the great start it needed,
giving up six hits, one walk, and one run while
striking out 11 to get her 23rd win of the season.
The Cardinal was led at the top of its lineup
by Aggabao and sophomore center fielder Alis
sa 1 laber. who picked up two hits apiece.

The win was of vital importance to the Cardi
nal. especially after having fallen to the 24th
ranked Huskies only a day earlier.
On Saturday. Washington pitcher Aleah
Macon controlled the often-potent Stanford of
fense, allowing just four hits and six walks while
fanning 12 Cardinal batters in leading the
Huskies to a 4-1 victor)'.
Washington jumped on Penna immediately,
scoring three runs on three hits in the first inning,
and the Huskies never looked back from there.
No Stanford player had more than a single
hit, while Washington designated player Ashlyn
Watson managed three hits and two RBI on her
own.
Penna did not have her best stuff, as she went
only 4.1 innings allowing six hits, four walks, and
four runs en route to her sixth loss of the season.

Stanford's weekend likely would have been
very different had it managed to upset the num
ber one-ranked UCLA in Los Angeles on Fri
day.
The Cardinal dropped the game 3-1, but it
was not for a lack of chances.
After Haber led off the game by driving an
Anjelica Selden 1 -2 curveball over the right field
fence to give the Cardinal the lead, Stanford was
unable to push another run across the plate.
Stanford shot itself in the foot multiple times,
stranding eleven base runners and committing
three errors in the field, leading to two of the
Bruins' runs.
The Bruins tied the game in the bottom of
the second after Stanford right fielder Anna
