# WIGGINS AWARDED WADE TROPHY FOR '08
## Senior guard a surprise winner over Lady Vols' Parker 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Candice Wiggins can add another line
to her already stellar basketball resume:
2008 Wade Trophy winner.
Stanford's star senior guard was pre
sented with the award Saturday. It is
given by the Women's Basketball
Coaches Association to the best player in
Division 1. In addition to production on
the court, the WBCA weighs the ath
lete's leadership and character when
making its decision.
" I was very shocked and elated and so
honored to receive this award," said Wig
gins.
"She's a great role model for young
women," said Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
Indeed. Wiggins's selflessness and
leadership is often touted as much as her
athletic ability and storied career.
"Candice Wiggins demonstrates what
this award is all about." said WBCA CHO
Beth Bass.
Among the 12 finalists for the trophy
— considered the most prestigious in
women's college basketball — were five
players from final four teams: Wiggins,
Tennessee's Candace Parker, LSU's
Sylvia Fowles and Connecticut's Renee
Montgomery' and Una Charles. Parker
won the trophy in 2007, and was consid
ered the favorite to win it again in 2008.
Parker had already been named the Asso
ciated Press Player of the Year.
"I was not expecting it," Wiggins said.
"I was just going to sit back."
"I just kind of thought it was going to
be Candace Parker," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal women's coach went on
to describe Wiggins's reaction to winning
the award.
"I was kind of given a tip before the an
nouncement and so I was watching Can
dice. She was kind of chitchatting with
Kristi Toliver [of Maryland, another final
ist) and she heard Stanford. And she was
in shock. She heard her name and was.
'Oh, my God!' It was hysterical to watch
her. but we're so excited for Candice."
The award is named for Lily Margaret

Wade, the late coach of Delta State Uni
versity. Wiggins is the 31st winner of the
award, and the second Stanford player to
be honored with it — Jennifer Azzi was
honored in 1990.
"1 am certain Lily Margaret Wade
would be pleased to know Candice is re
ceiving this award." said Bass.
Wiggins has, to date, put together a re
markable senior campaign. She averages
20.3 points per game, to go along with

"I was not expect
ing it. I was just
going to sit back."

Senior Guard

nearly five rebounds and over three as
sists. Her defense has been excellent as
well — she has stolen 80 passes.
However, because the WBCA select
ed the winner on Saturday rather than be
fore the postseason, Wiggins probably
sealed the award with her spectacular
play throughout the NCAA and Pac-10
tournaments. She has scored over 40
points twice in the NCAA Tournament en
route to an average total of 27.4 points per
game. Connecticut coach Getio Auriem
ma summed it up well: "Candice Wiggins
has been the best player in this tourna
ment from the very first game."
Indeed, if Stanford am prevail against
Tennessee in the finals on TUesday, Wig
gins will be a shoo-in for Tournament
MVP
Her performance this year has been
one for the ages. Neither she nor the Car
dinal faithful — whom she blessed with a
44-point, 10 rebound and 8 assist game in
her last match at Maples Pavilion — will
fail to remember.
Wiggins put it best: "I'll never forget
this season."
