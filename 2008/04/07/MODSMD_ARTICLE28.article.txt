### CHRISTINA NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a pair of tough losses the previous weekend, the
No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball team was looking to re
bound against unranked UC-San Diego and No. 4 Long
Beach State this weekend.
The Cardinal swept the Tritons in a decisive 3-0 (30-20,
35-33,30-20) win on Friday, regaining some much-need
ed momentum going into the team's final games. They
were set back again, however, in a tough loss to the Long
Beach State 49ers 3-0 (30-24,30-25,30-17) on Saturday.
Against the Tritons, the Cardinal was led by sopho
more Evan Romero, who scored 24 points with 21 kills.
Freshman Spencer McLachlin had a double-double, with
11 kills and 11 digs. Senior Matt Ceran also tallied 10 kills
and eight digs. As a team, the Cardinal recorded seven
aces.
"Our serving was on, especially in game one and game
three," said head coach John Kosty of the win." We played
really well from the service line and we were able to con
trol their offense."
In game one, the Cardinal got out to an early 5-1 lead
on a pair of kills from Romero and a kill from Ceran. The
Tritons called a timeout, but were unable to regroup fol
lowing the break. The Cardinal maintained a sizeable
lead for much of the game. A number of Triton kills
brought them within three at 20-17, but an equal number
of errors widened the gap to bring the score to 26-19.
Stanford closed out the game with a couple of kills from
McLachlin and a kill from Romero.
Game two saw the Tritons fight back from a 1 -0 deficit,
keeping the game close in opening rallies before obtain
ing a modest 10-8 lead. The Cardinal quickly answered
with kills from McLachlin and junior Cameron Christof
fers, bringing the score to 12 apiece.The two teams rallied
back and forth for 16 points,tying the game eight times. A
kill from Christoffers and a pair of service aces from
freshman lan Connolly broke the tie and gave the Cardi
nal a 23-20 lead.
Following a timeout, the Tritons rallied back and the
teams traded points again all the way to bonus points. A
kill from Ceran gave the Cardinal a one-point lead at 34-
33, setting up a kill from junior Garrett Werner which
sealed the game at 35-33.
In game three, the Cardinal again took an early 6-1
lead and maintained it for much of the first half of the
game. At 16-10, a number of Triton errors and a couple of
kills by Romero brought the team's lead to eight at 19-11.
More errors brought the score to 24-14, prompting the
Tritons to call a timeout. Following the timeout, however,
Romero and Werner began firing away with three and
two kills, respectively, to close out the game and the
match.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did not fare as well

against the top-five 49ers. The 49ers were led by Josh
Riley, who had 12 kills, and Paul Lotman.who had eight.
Mike Klipsch posted 31 assists. The 49ers also tallied 15
total team blocks.
The Cardinal was led by Romero and McLachlin. who
recorded 11 kills each. Sophomore Kawika Shoji had 28
assists. Ceran and freshman Jordan Inafuku had the most
digs, with 6 apiece.
Stanford currently sits in sixth place in the MPSF with
a record of 10-10. They could end up anywhere between
No. 5 and No. 8 at the end of the season, depending on
how they fare next weekend against UCLA and UCI.
The Cardinal is just behind UCLA, and tied with UCI.
"They're going to be huge matches for us," Stanford
coach John Kosty said. "We have clinched playoffs, but
we haven't clinched a spot in the playoffs. We definitely
want to come out playing tough and winning both match
es."
Stanford returns to the court on Friday when it faces
the No. 7 UCLA Bruins. The game will begin 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.

Evan Romero and the Cardinal will look to bounce back
from their defeat at the hands of the 49ers last weekend
and move up from their current sixth place in the MPSF as
they take on UCLA and UC-lrvine this week.
