## Rebounding gives Cardinal the edge 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's semifinal win over Connecticut dis
played the Cardinal's shot-making ability and de
fense. but it was their dominance on the boards that
set them apart from the Huskies and allowed them to
take control of the game early.
One of the keys for Stanford was to prevent Con
necticut from pulling down offensive rebounds. The
Huskies were one of the best rebounding teams in
the country this year: they averaged close to 45 a
game,and finished fqurth in the nation with a total of
1231 offensive boards through the beginning of the
month. As a by-product of this success, they enjoyed
an 11.7 rebound advantage per game over their op
ponents.
The Cardinal wasn't too shabby either, averaging
41.4 rebounds per game coming into Sunday's game.
But Connecticut had successfully handled Stanford
on the boards in their November match up — a 66-
54 1 luskies win — as they pulled down nine more re
bounds than the Cardinal.
Not so on Sunday. Stanford managed to outre
bound the Huskies, 43-37. The disparity seemed
much wider than that.
First, Stanford needed to establish itself on the
defensive boards. By way of their poor shooting,
Connecticut had multiple offensive rebounding op
portunities. But the Cardinal did an excellent job of
boxing players out and gaining position on the glass
— Stanford kept the area underneath the basket
clear instead of allowing Connecticut to set up down
low for second chance opportunities. It was as tech
nically-sound as rebounding can be, and the Huskies
simply had no answer for it.
" 1 think what we were able to do was we were able
to keep them off the o-boards. We boxed out pretty
well," said coach Tara VanDerveer.
While rebounding is a strength of sophomore
center Jayne Appel and freshman forward kayla
Pedersen, senior guard Candice Wiggins — a good
rebounder in her own right — was able to contribute
as well. She led the Cardinal with 13 rebounds, all of
which came on the defensive boards.
With their position on their own hoop secured,
Stanford turned its attention to the offensive glass,
where Jillian Harmon, in limited time, excelled,
pulling down three offensive boards. Pedersen and
Appel contributed two apiece.
"Rebounding in general is important. And I think
we won the rebounding margin. I think that really
helped us a lot," said Wiggins.
Indeed, it did: by controlling the boards, the Car
dinal controlled the ball, and was thus able to set the
tone of the game. Instead of allowing Connecticut to
institute its fast-paced, run-'n-gun attack effectively.

the Cardinal slowed the game down while on of
fense. They would routinely take 25 seconds to get a
shot off, which took Connecticut out of its element
— the Huskies prefer to force shooters to put the
ball up quickly so they can establish their offense.
Despite the game's style being completely differ
ent from what they're used to. the Huskies refused to
adapt. When they had the ball. UConn kept pushing,
kept missing, and kept being outwrestled for the re
bounds — they never found their offensive rhythm.
Coach Geno Auriemma failed to adjust to the slow
er style of play. In fact, after the game, he chastised
himself for not calling timeouts to slow his team
down.
"They just want to go.That's the kind of team we
are," he said, "If we could have stayed on offense a
little bit longer, we could have caught our breath a
little bit."
Auriemma concluded: "We shouldn't have played
like that today."
This disorientation and unfamiliarity wit the
tempo of the game ultimately led to the Huskies de
mise — and it all started on the boards.
