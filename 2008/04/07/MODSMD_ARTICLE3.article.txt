(Sagar Doshi/ Phillip Hon)
■ PRESIDENT, SAGAR DOSHI '09: Junior class pres
ident, former ASSU Director of Marketing and
Outreach 2006-2007, former Daily columnist and
editorial board member, former captain of Hindi Film
Dance team, Sanskriti member.
■ VICE PRESIDENT, PHILLIP HON'IO: ASSU Chair of
Academic and Career Initiatives, member of the Acts
of Intolerance Protocol Committee, program assistant
with the OSA, Asian American Student Association
liaison of Sanskriti Core, Frosh Council 2006-2007.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): You have both
spent time within the Executive branch of
the ASSU. How would this shape your
tenure as president and vice president?
Sagar I)oshi (SI)): The best way to frame
this is to recognize the problem the ASSU
has — the issue of institutional memory. We
and anyone else who is running are essen
tially in office for one year. That's a short
period of time . . . You get a lot of repetition,
just because you don't know what's hap
pened in the past. Given what we have done,
we won't have to go'over some of that same
ground. For long-term projects like diversity,
we can just keep things going.
Phillip Hon (PH): We know what has
already happened, and we know what has
failed. We know the ASSU hasn't done its


best job in being transparent and
reaching out to students ... A lot
of people we talked to don't even
know what the ASSU is, and it's
really big for us to go out and hear
people's concerns and let them
know how we are serving them.
SI): It's a perennial problem. But
to be honest, it's not a huge prob
lem. It means that students are
busy with other things, to help
make this campus better. When
people don't have to worry about
how their needs are being met —
that means their needs are being
met. But there is always room for
improvement.
TSI): How will you help graduate
students?
SI): Last quarter I lived in
Crothers . . . Housing costs went
up 25 percent for grads, and no
one heard about it. Graduate
issues get put on the back burner.
It's 8,000 to 6,000 — they are the
vast majority on campus. They are
less involved with student groups,
but that doesn't mean they don't

have needs that need to be met.
We want to have a really strong
graduate focus.
TSI): How will your graduate
focus compete with that of the
Gobaud-Goldgof slate, both of
whom are co-terminal students?
SI): If you're interested and moti
vated, you can't be dissuaded by
someone else who also is motivat
ed and ready for the job. If we
don't go into office and they do,
we hope they will support the
same things we do. Its not
Democrats versus Republicans,
we aren't fighting. These are all
the same issues. Everyone wants
sustainability, everyone wants
diversity. The difference is can
they do them, and do them well.
TSI): You seem to be running on
a platform of ASSU experience.
How can you compete with
Priyanka Sharma, the
Undergraduate Senate Chair, in
that respect?
SI): There is not one position in
the ASSU that will provide you
with the best amount of experi
ence. There is an extraordinary
difference between Exec and
Senate. The ASSU is an umbrella
organization; you need knowledge

about the different parts. We have
the experience with the
Executive.
TSI): How is your platform differ
ent from the other executive plat
forms?
SI): Broadly, it's supporting stu
dents and student groups because
that's why we are here .. .
Graduate issues are really impor
tant to us, because we are reaching
out to a community that hasn't
traditionally been reached out to.
Old Union — we can get a place
that's not just a study place.
Student groups have a very tough
time just trying to reserve space.
We want to make a universal
reservation system.
These are the same ideas people
are going to hear throughout the
campaign. But that points to a
good thing — that means that a
lot of us are here for the same rea
son: to make this place better. The
fact that that is the case is some
thing that reflects really well on
the people that are here. The only
way you can distinguish people is
how feasible their ideas are, and if
they have the leadership to make
[their ideas] possible.
