# Sooners upset Card
## 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When you are the top-ranked team
in the country, you're supposed to win
your conference. Someone forgot to
relay that message to the Stanford
men's gymnastics team. Rather,
maybe it was Oklahoma that didn't
get the memo.
The No. 2 Sooners claimed their
fourth straight Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) title on
Saturday, beating out No.l Stanford
by a score of 359.150 to 357.200. On
paper, the result didn't exactly qualify
as an upset. Oklahoma is the best team
in the nation on floor exercise, still
rings and vault, and is ranked third on
high bar and parallel bars. However,
the Stanford men expected a victory
and return to the Farm after a "disap
pointing" and "frustrating" meet.
The Cardinal began the meet on
pommel horse and was unable to live
up to its N0.2 ranking in the event.The
team got strong performances from
senior Chris Harper and freshman
Kyle Oi. but their scores were surpris
ingly mediocre. The crowd and even
other teams were surprised by Stan
ford's low marks.
"1 thought Oi got scored a lot lower
than he performed," said a frustrated
I iarper.The team's frustration contin
ued when redshirt junior and US Na
tional Team member Sho Nakamori

had to pull out of the meet after the
first event. Nakamori has been fight
ing back problems for the past two
weeks.
Stanford did have chances to take
control of the meet. On still rings,
freshman Tim Gentry and junior
Bryant Hadden hit their routines and
scored well, but senior co-captain
David Sender scored well below his
season average, only able to muster a
14. I XX) after missing two skills and put
ting his hands down on his dismount.
All six of Stanford's vaults were
good, and Sender rebounded from his
sub-par rings set to win the event with
a 16.4(X). The team put up strong
scores on parallel bars as well, but Ok
lahoma held onto its early lead.
On high bar. Stanford was able to
make up for the absence of senior co
captain Dylan Carney, the No. 2 high
bar competitor in the nation. Dylan sat
out the meet while recovering from an
ankle sprain.
"Its always frustrating when you
have to sit out," he said, adding that he
was "very proud" of his teammates' per
formances. Despite tough judging that
resulted in low scores, the Stanford men
won the event by more than a point.
As far as the ankle, Dylan is
pleased with how quickly he has re
covered.
"I've been in the gym every day
and can do everything on high bar." he
said.

Although he could have competed.
Carney was conservative and chose to
rest this weekend in hopes of being
1 (X) percent healthy at the NCAA
Championship meet.
"I should he ready to go on all my
events," the senior co-captain said.
Stanford scored well on floor exer
cise to wrap up the competition, hut it
was too little, too late. Although
Sender's outstanding routine earned
him a 15.8(X) and a share of the confer
ence title, and freshman Josh Dixon's
15.6(X) was second, but Oklahoma was
a little deepej and again outscored the
Cardinal.
Although Oklahoma came out on
top on Saturday, the real test comes at
NCAAs on April 17-19. It will be a
home meet for the Stanford, as the com
petition will be held in Maples Pavilion.
Going into NCAAs. the Stanford
men must balance their motivation
from this weekend's loss with the need
for rest and recovery. Is there a risk of
over-training in the next two weeks?
"I'm not worried about that." said
Carney."We're all in the gym together,
and we'll help keep each other on
track."
With NCAAs only 10 days away,
the men will need to stay focused to
win their first NCAA team title since
1995.
