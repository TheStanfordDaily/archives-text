## Monty nets job with an old foe, Cal 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It hasn't been the best of weeks for
Stanford basketball.
On the heels of the Lopez twins
declaring for the NBA draft on Mon
day. former Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery headed across the Bay
to accept a coaching position at Cal.
He was officially sworn in as the
Bears' coach on Saturday.
"I'm sure when I show up next
year at Maples (Pavilion), they won't
have the welcome wagon out,"
Montgomery told The Almanac in
Menlo Park. "But that's part of the
experience ... You will never get me
to say anything bad about Stanford. 1
love the place.They were great to me,
and now I'm here."
Montgomery, who led the Cardi
nal to a 393-167 record and 12
NCAA Tournament berths in 18 sea
sons, had returned to the Farm in
September in a part-time position as
assistant to Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby. He also did broadcast work
for Fox Sports Net, Comcast and
CBS radio.
In an interview with The Daily
earlier this year, the 61-year-old
Montgomery expressed a desire to
return to the sidelines. He had been
in a state of semi-retirement since
August 2006, when he was released
as head coach of the NBA's Golden
State Warriors after two seasons and
a 68-96 record.
"[TJhere's still a lot of basketball
in my blood, just because you do
something for that long." he told The
Daily in February. "We'll have to
wait and see if anything develops
there ... You've done something for
37 years, and it's just what you do."
The winningest coach in school
history. Montgomery helped usher in
Stanford basketball's rise to national
prominence. He led the Cardinal to
four regular season Pac-10 champi
onships. an NCAA Final Four ap
pearance in 1998 and a Pac-10 Tour
nament title in 2004.
