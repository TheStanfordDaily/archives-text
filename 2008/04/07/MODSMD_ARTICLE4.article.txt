The Stanford Daily (TSI)): What sets you apart
from other candidates?
GG:The other slates want to convert Old Union
into a social place, and we want to convert it into
a study place. We want to turn Tresidder into a
social place. ResEd needs to move out of
Tresidder; we'd like to put a student lounge
there. We actually have social programming next
year.There's a huge discretionary fund for exec
utives, and now no one even knows about it.
DG: I've had over a thousand people using my
GER treasure hunter. I saw this need for finding
GERs, and you can't do it easily with the current
system. It takes me a couple hours to put this
thing up, and thousands of people have used it.
We feel we can do the same thing on a bigger
scale. People need a site that they can go to. The
ASSU site is useless right now. There's no rea
son to go to it.
