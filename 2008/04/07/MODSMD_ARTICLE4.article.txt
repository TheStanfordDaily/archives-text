### 
The Stanford Daily (TSI)): What sets you apart
from other candidates?
GG:The other slates want to convert Old Union
into a social place, and we want to convert it into
a study place. We want to turn Tresidder into a
social place. ResEd needs to move out of
Tresidder; we'd like to put a student lounge
there. We actually have social programming next
year.There's a huge discretionary fund for exec
utives, and now no one even knows about it.
DG: I've had over a thousand people using my
GER treasure hunter. I saw this need for finding
GERs, and you can't do it easily with the current
system. It takes me a couple hours to put this
thing up, and thousands of people have used it.
We feel we can do the same thing on a bigger
scale. People need a site that they can go to. The
ASSU site is useless right now. There's no rea
son to go to it.

GG: We arc co-terms, and we are the
only grad students running. Grad stu
dents are always shafted. Social
events for grads this year were the
mausoleum party and the block
party. ITie other platforms have the
same line as previous ones; they
think the grad students want to go to
expanded undergrad events — that's
not true.
I)G: I talked to administrators about
my graduate ideas, and they thought
they were great. One of those is a
graduate graduation. We are talking
about a graduate dinner on the quad

and a graduate formal in the city. For
the 750 — ambience is horrible; very
few women come, because it's like a
bar. We want better music, food and
good drinks.
CiCi: We would like to help provide
funding and advertisements for GSC
events. We want to have weekly
things in the 750. We want to expand
the current happy hour.The grad stu
dents don't feel like the ASSU is
related to them in any way
TSI): So are you primarily a gradu
ate student slate?
I)G: We are covering everyone. We
not only care about the undergrads,
but also the grad students.
TSI): Why have you been so specific
with your platform? A lot of the

other slates have been far more
vague.
IHJ: We know what we want to get
done.
(iCi: Every year people say things
and don't get them done, because
there are no benchmarks.
DG: 1 talked to Provost John
Etchemendy, VP for Student Affairs
Chris Griffith. Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe, Chief
Housing Officer Rodger Whitney,
Vaden Director Ira Friedman and IT
Director William Clebsch. We've
been working 24/7. We have thor
oughly researched everything on our
platform.
