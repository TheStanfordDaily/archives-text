The Stanford Daily (TSD): Priyanka, you are
the ultimate ASSU insider. How can you bring
change to an organization that you have spent
so much time within?
Priyanka Sharma (PS): I think being an insider
is crucial to bringing about change. An insider
can never do it alone, and that's why I think
Jack is so helpful. Myopic visions kill insiders.
With my technical know-how and Jack's big
ideas, and our joint thoughts together, we can
bring about the change that many can promise
and few can bring about.
TSD: Jack, you don't have any ASSU experi
ence, and are best known for your tree stunts.
Can we take somebody who ate a live snake
seriously?
Jack Cackler (JC): The focus of the campaign is
not my run for tree, but what we can do for the


University. I really wanted to make
a difference in Stanford my senior
year... I went overboard [in the
tree campaign], I had a serious lack
of judgment. I understand the
hand's decision. But when one door
closes, the other opens. I saw this as
a great opportunity... It can be
about subsidizing birth control,
reopening the CoHo. I'm a strong
believer that there are many things
you can do in life to make a differ
ence.
TSI): So if you had the option next
year of being either the tree or the
ASSU vice president, which role
would you pick?
JC: My role to best serve Stanford is
as ASSU Executive.

TSI): Would you like to elaborate
on that?
JC: No
TSI): How does your platform dif
fer from the other executive plat
forms?
JC: Everyone else that is running is
great. It's going to come down to
what the focus is on, and how we can
realistically achieve the promises we
are making.
PS: The key difference — ours
might not be the sexiest platform,
but it's the most realistic. We are
making promises we are 1(K) percent
sure we can keep. There is not one
sentence that we are dubious about.
One major part is student advocacy
advisory board. This year as Senate
Chair, I noticed that ASSU does
things for student groups, but every
one hates us — we are lacking. We

are relegated to being an opinion
generator. That's not the way it
should be. We should be providing
resources.
TSI): Priyanka, what have you
accomplished as undergraduate sen
ate chair?
FS: 1 was a first-term senator, and
the first ever chair who was a first
term. My learning curve was very
steep. This senate was hailed as the
most contentious senate ever, and
it's working well. Running it has
been such a big accomplishment.
Every senator has done such a great
job. We entered the senate a con
tentious bunch; we are leaving it as
friends.
Another important item is the gen
der-neutral housing program for this
year. When the committee was set
up. they wanted to focus on trans
gender people only. But 1 knew it
was not just a transgender option.
You need to have a safe home space,

which is why I rounded up a bunch
of people who were very passionate
— now people are working on the
pilot program for this year's draw.
We want it to become a full-time
program.
TSI): The ASSU is often very divid
ed. You have been endorsed by the
Stanford Review; those receiving
this endorsement have traditionally
been at odds with SOCC-endorsed
ASSU members. How will you over
come division in the ASSU?
JC: We want to reach out to
everyone on campus. We were
endorsed by Review. They see us
as the most capable execs. Does
that mean we will work less close
ly with SOCC? No. We want to
reach out to people all over cam
pus. This would be an executive of
the entire campus.
