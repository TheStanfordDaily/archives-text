While Stanford's two stars shined once

The Cardinal women overwhelmed Connecticut last night, 82-73, taking control early in the
first half and never looking back. Stanford moves on to play Tennessee for the national title
Tuesday night. The Cardinal defeated the Lady Vols 73-69 in overtime on Dec. 22.

nearly 13 minutes had gone by. She would go on to
lead the Huskies with 20 points, but she was hard
ly the dominant presence that she had been
throughout the season. Connecticut leaned on
guard Renee Montgomery, but she shot a woeful
4-18 from the field, including 1-9 from beyond the
arc.
Stanford was able to control the pace of the
game to their advantage — they ran when need
ed. but for the most part, slowed the game down
and took their time on offense, routinely running
the shot clock down into single-digits. This
worked against Connecticut, a team that likes to
keep the game moving fairly quickly. And when
Connecticut was able to manage the game to
their strengths, they were unable to finish.
"They played better. They executed their of
fense better and we didn't make our shots," said
Moore.
"They were perfect out there. I have never
seen a team run so smoothly on the offensive and
defensive end." said freshman forward Kalli Mc-
Claren.
It was a sharp contrast from Stanford and
Connecticut's early season matchup, when the
Huskies ran the Cardinal out of the arena as they
rolled to a 66-54 victory.
But Wiggins noticed a silver lining in that loss.
"They changed the whole dynamic of our
team. And so we grouped together before this
game and we said: 'Let's see how much better
we've gotten,' " she said. '"We're not the same
team we were in November."
Indeed, Stanford has transformed over the
course of the year — instead of relying on their
big three (Wiggins, Appel and Pedersen) to con
tribute the brunt of the work, they are able to
find contributions from all players on the floor,
such as Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, JJ Hones and Jil
lian Harmon.
Harmon in particular had a nice game off the
bench, scoring nine points and pulling down four
boards, including three on the offensive end.
"Jill has been due for a really good game,"
said Appel. "1 think she really came off the bench
and had some really key plays for us and re
bounds."
"We knew we would have to play our ab
solute A game," coach Tara VanDerveer said.
And that they did, much to the chagrin of
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, whose
emotional press conference summed up the
Huskies' feelings.
"There's no words to describe what it means
to put everything,your heart and soul into some
thing and come up short."
Connecticut's season ends, but Stanford still
has 40 minutes to make history.

Only 40 minutes stand between Stanford
and their third national championship.
By downing the top-ranked Connecticut
Huskies, 82-73. in the semifinals in Tampa on
Sunday, the Cardinal secured its first finals
berth since 1992 and extended its nation
best winning streak

to 23 games.

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women continued
their wild tournament run with an 82-73 win
over No. 1 UConn, avenging a previous loss
this season to the Huskies in the process. The

who had a double-double of her own with 15
points and ten rebounds. "When they went
on a run we kind of picked it up on our end
and countered that back."
While Stanford's two stars shined once
again, it was freshman forward Kayla
Pedersen who provided the most consistent
offensive force for the Cardinal. In addition
to her post game, she showed off her range,
taking (and hitting) multiple shots from over
15 feet out, including one three-pointer.
"1 think it gives us so much confidence as

teammates to look at Kayla and know that
every single game she's going to go her hard
est and she's got this focus and this will to
win," said Wiggins.

The Cardinal women overwhelmed Connecticut last night, 82-73, taking control early in the
first half and never looking back. Stanford moves on to play Tennessee for the national title
Tuesday night. The Cardinal defeated the Lady Vols 73-69 in overtime on Dec. 22.

nearly 13 minutes had gone by. She would go on to
lead the Huskies with 20 points, but she was hard
ly the dominant presence that she had been
throughout the season. Connecticut leaned on
guard Renee Montgomery, but she shot a woeful
4-18 from the field, including 1-9 from beyond the
arc.
Stanford was able to control the pace of the
game to their advantage — they ran when need
ed. but for the most part, slowed the game down
and took their time on offense, routinely running
the shot clock down into single-digits. This
worked against Connecticut, a team that likes to
keep the game moving fairly quickly. And when
Connecticut was able to manage the game to
their strengths, they were unable to finish.
"They played better. They executed their of
fense better and we didn't make our shots," said
Moore.
"They were perfect out there. I have never
seen a team run so smoothly on the offensive and
defensive end." said freshman forward Kalli Mc-
Claren.
It was a sharp contrast from Stanford and
Connecticut's early season matchup, when the
Huskies ran the Cardinal out of the arena as they
rolled to a 66-54 victory.
But Wiggins noticed a silver lining in that loss.
"They changed the whole dynamic of our
team. And so we grouped together before this
game and we said: 'Let's see how much better
we've gotten,' " she said. '"We're not the same
team we were in November."
Indeed, Stanford has transformed over the
course of the year — instead of relying on their
big three (Wiggins, Appel and Pedersen) to con
tribute the brunt of the work, they are able to
find contributions from all players on the floor,
such as Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, JJ Hones and Jil
lian Harmon.
Harmon in particular had a nice game off the
bench, scoring nine points and pulling down four
boards, including three on the offensive end.
"Jill has been due for a really good game,"
said Appel. "1 think she really came off the bench
and had some really key plays for us and re
bounds."
"We knew we would have to play our ab
solute A game," coach Tara VanDerveer said.
And that they did, much to the chagrin of
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, whose
emotional press conference summed up the
Huskies' feelings.
"There's no words to describe what it means
to put everything,your heart and soul into some
thing and come up short."
Connecticut's season ends, but Stanford still
has 40 minutes to make history.
