### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
"Stanford supports queer rights."
"Gay is not a synonym for stupid."
"Support gay classmates."
Students coming back from spring break this
week may have noticed these phrases and oth
ers written in chalk on the pavement outside
their dining halls. The writings were a project by
members of Stanford's Queer-Straight Alliance.
Early last month, chalk drawings cropped up
outside Meyer library that confused some stu
dents and offended others.
"My husband flicks his tongue like a dyke,"
was written in pink chalk.

Members of Stanford's Queer-Straight
Alliance wrote chalk messages outside cam
pus dining halls after a student's public art
project was perceived as homophobic.
"Talk to me," demanded another
chalk sentence.
"Holy shit! I'm bi!" was pro
claimed in purple chalk.
One sentence made reference to
Barack Obama smoking pot. Other
writings looked like they were part
of a conversation.
"What exactly do you get when
griffens [sic) and Cardinals mate?"
someone had written, using blue
chalk.
"Babies," was the response, writ
ten in all caps.
"Ugly overeducated ones," added
someone, writing with yellow chalk.
"Well, the bitches at this place are
that's for sure," someone wrote in
purple, drawing an arrow towards
"overeducated."
The writing generated a lot of
chatter on the unofficial Stanford
blog and on various email lists. No
one was sure who had done the
chalking, or what was meant by it.
"People thought it was high
schoolers, or people from off-cam
pus." said George Morris '08.
"It was hard to interpret," added
Matt Bush '11.
"1 thought someone wrote it
when they were high." added Jenna
Queenan '12.
Students soon discovered that
the writing was actually a class
related art project done by Molly
Butcher '08, who picked the phrases
from graffiti etched on a stall door
in a Meyer library bathroom.
Butcher had an art show last quar
ter called "Made public" which
reproduced other campus graffiti.
She stressed that her goal was not to
be offensive, but rather to shed light
on the usually private bathroom
writings.
"1 did it with the intention of
exposing, not hating," she said,
adding that she was not expecting

the strong reaction to her work.
"Sidewalk chalk is so prevalent
around campus." she said. "I was
pretty surprised people even
noticed it."
Eric Tran '10 said he was grateful
to Butcher for exposing the bath
room stall graffiti.
"I'm in class and 1 hear all these
intellectual people being really tol
erant and open-minded and then I
go to the bathroom and look at the
grout between the tiles — they say
the most base things. 1 wouldn't
expect to see it here," he said.
After Butcher's original writing
had worn off in March. Tran organ
ized a group of students to re-chalk
the area.
"1 don't think we meant to
address specifically the chalking
because it was made with benevo
lent intent,"Tran said. "It was more
to assuage people who might be
offended by it and to let people
know there are safe spaces at
Stanford."
The group wrote phrases like
"No homophobia," "Choose love"
and "Black is beautiful."
"We spent two and half hours
outside of Meyer," Queenan said.
As spring quarter began, Tran
wanted to spread similar messages
all across campus. Iran, along with
other members of Stanford's
Queer-Straight Alliance and a few
Stanford alums, chalked up the
pavement outside Lagunita Court,
Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall and
Florence Moore Hall. The group
wrote phrases like "Stanford sup
ports LGBT students" and "Love
knows no gender."
"I drew a bunch of rainbows,"
Tran added.
Bush said that Butcher's original
chalking presented an opportunity
for Stanford's LGBT community.
"It was a good starting point to
brainstorm ways we can do more
affirming stuff," he said.
