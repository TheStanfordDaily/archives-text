# STUDENT LIFE
## Chalk art sparks LGBT response Students react to a project that reproduced bathroom graffiti 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
"Stanford supports queer rights."
"Gay is not a synonym for stupid."
"Support gay classmates."
Students coming back from spring break this
week may have noticed these phrases and oth
ers written in chalk on the pavement outside
their dining halls. The writings were a project by
members of Stanford's Queer-Straight Alliance.
Early last month, chalk drawings cropped up
outside Meyer library that confused some stu
dents and offended others.
"My husband flicks his tongue like a dyke,"
was written in pink chalk.
