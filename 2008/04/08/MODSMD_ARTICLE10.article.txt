## Student wins award, will travel Africa 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students are frequently reward
ed for their hard work, but it is a rare recog
nition that sends a young woman on an
eight-day trip to Africa. Such is the prize for
Fatima Hassan '09, recipient of the
Americans for United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) Student Award {or the
Health and Dignity of Women.
In addition to being honored in
Washington, D.C., as an up-and-coming
women's health advocate and delegate of the
UNFPA, Hassan will travel to Uganda and
Rwanda this summer to view the organiza
tion's work in person.
The UNFPA is an organization that pro
vides health care services and promotes
women's rights in 150 countries worldwide.
Along with other delegates and UNFPA
staff, she will tour a maternity ward, visit
local schools and hospitals, sit in on women's
health programs and demonstrations and
pay a visit to the genocide memorial in
Rwanda. During the August trip, she will
guest blog for Marie Claire.com and ameri
cansforunfpa.blogspot.com.
On the trip, Hassan will be given the
opportunity to learn about the UNFPA's
work in these areas firsthand. By becoming a
"young ambassador" for the UNFPA,
Hassan will join ranks with Jerri Halliway,
better known as the Spice Girls' Ginger
Spice, who also works with the organization.
Hassan hopes later to pursue an
M.D./Ph.D. in medical anthropology before
furthering her involvement with internation
al advocacy.
"I want to be an advocate for global
women's health and rights, particularly
bridging safe motherhood and the promo
tion of education for women and girls." she
said.
Hassan moved from her birthplace in
Saudi Arabia to the United States at the age
of four. She has served as the president of
the Muslim Student Awareness Network at
Stanford, visited Africa previously with the
Eritrean Maternal Health Project and
worked at the local Women's Community
Center. According to a UNFPA press
release, Hassan plans to coordinate efforts to
develop alternate ceremonies to replace
female genital cutting in Somalia, as well as
combating obstetric fistula — a complication
of childbirth.
Fatima's winning application was chosen
by an independently contracted jury, which
included female editors, teachers and last
year's prize-winner.
"It's sort of interesting that we've read all
about her but we haven't met her," said a
spokesperson for Americans for UNFPA.
"We're all looking forward to meeting her."
