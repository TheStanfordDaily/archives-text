## Rush restrictions affect sororities Sorority members avoid parties in push to end dirty recruitment 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
For the past week, members of Stanford's six
Inter Sorority Council (ISC) sororities participated
in the annual recruitment process. But this year, the
ISC cracked down on non-regulated recruitment
practices, effectively banning sorority members
from all-campus parties.
A "no drinking" policy mandated a dry recruit
ment period, prohibiting the presence of active
sorority members anywhere where both alcohol
and freshmen were present â€” including all-cam
pus parties.
"This [policy] is not really new," said sorority
recruitment chair Whitney Martin "09 in an email to
The Daily. "We just put [the policy] in writing. This
is a pretty uniform regulation on all campuses
across the nation; it is just that most schools have
recruitment before school starts, so this rule does
not end up affecting anyone but the sororities and
Prospective New Members."
Martin said that the no-alcohol policy was set up
to prevent situations where sorority members
could engage in "dirty recruitment" in social situa
tions outside organized recruitment parties.
"This was made very clear to the chapters, and I
think it was understood and
respected," Martin said.
But some sorority members expressed their dis
appointment in regards to the alcohol policy.
"I don't think this is a good idea," said Nada
Boutros '08, a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. "1
have not been able to hang out with my friends [at
parties] because of the strict policies in place."
Other students agreed that the policies facilitate
more professional recruitment interactions with
prospective sorority members.
" Ihe non-alcohol policy this year has been par
tially effective," said Kaitlin Asrow 09 of Chi
Omega, "and I think they should continue to
enforce it in the future,"
