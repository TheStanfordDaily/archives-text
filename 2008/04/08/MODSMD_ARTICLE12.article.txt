# Senate attendance records under scrutiny
## 
### 
Students voting in Wednesday and
Thursday's ASSU elections will he forced
to decide which candidates are the most
qualified for office.
Rut if history is any guide, the senators
they choose may not even show up to all
meetings.
Attendance records for the Ninth
Undergraduate Senate were provided to The
Daily by Undergraduate Senate Secretary
Tim Ford '10, who had data from 13 of 17
meetings.
Senator Jonathan Kass '10 had the best
record â€” he was the only senator to attend
all of the 13 meetings for which Ford provid
ed attendance records.
"We really have to keep on top of our
issues, to be able to advocate successfully,"
Kass said. "I've made it a priority, and auto
matically cancel plans for TUesday night,
because I know 1 have a commitment there,
it's non-negotiable."
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 proposed a
plan to fix the attendance problem next year,
noting that committee chairs rather than
individual senators provide updates on their

work.
"Next year, as opposed to the committee
chairs giving updates, we'd have individual
senators asked,' What have you done for the
Stanford community this week?'"
Of the other 13 senators, all but Kass had
between one and three absences, except Re
Phillips, chair of the Senate Appropriations
and Rules Committee, who missed seven
meetings.
Corinne Prudhomme '09 was absent from
three of the 13 meetings, while Stuart Baimel
'09, Waddie Crazyhorse '10 and Andy
Lomeli '09 were each absent twice.
With one absence were Jose Benchimol
'08, Patrick Cordova '09, Sarah Golabek-
Goldman '10. Luukas lives '09, Vang Kou
Khang '08, Eugene Nho '10, Esosa Ozigbo
'10, Priyanka Sharma '09 and Tomas Vacek
'10.
This year's elections will take place on
Wednesday Apr. 9 and Thursday April 10.
