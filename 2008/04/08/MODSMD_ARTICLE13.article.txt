## Editorial Board Cardinal basketball: it's not all about the twins 
### 
The Stanford Cardinal's first Final
Four appearance since 1997 is owed
to the unrelenting efforts of our
women's basketball team. In particular, all
star Candice Wiggins sets herself apart in
athletic achievement. Her name is increas
ingly paired with the illustrious Lisa Leslie,
one of the WNBA's top players. Candice's
name echoes down hallways and through
out dorm rooms on campus; there is no
question that her team's recent ascension
to the Final Four has etched her personali
ty onto the consciousness of the student
body, giving her name recognition enjoyed
by almost no other women's basketball
player in the nation.
Has her popularity always been this
widespread? Is it a cyclical phenomenon,
reaching its peak during the annual NCAA
College Basketball Tournament? Many
students, when asked who they think of
when they hear "Stanford Basketball."
mention the Lopez twins. Their fame is un
questionable, and the buzz surrounding
their personal life can be compared to the
attention garnered by certain celebrities.
The presence of the Lopez twins often
looms larger on campus than that of Can
dice Wiggins. The recent attention toward
Wiggins may more accurately be character
ized as the exception rather than the rule.
Such is the sad state of affairs concern
ing Stanford basketball specifically, but
also collegiate athletics in general.
Women's sports and female athletes are
often overshadowed by their masculine
counterparts. One need not look any fur
ther than a recent issue of The Stanford
Daily to find an example. In the Apr. 1
issue, the top headline of the sports section
announced the much anticipated departure
of the Lopez twins. Brook's less than enthu

siastic academic motivation suggested that
he wasn't too invested in his studies. His de
sire to enter the 2008 NBA Draft with his
brother seemed all but inevitable. Despite
it being no surprise, the twins' departure
was still the top story.
The second headline congratulated the
women's basketball team and Candice Wig
gins for launching the Cardinal into its first
Final Four appearance in 11 years. This mo
mentous occasion only seemed to merit sec
ond-place status, even though the achieve
ment was far from inevitable â€” and any
thing but a regular occurrence. Now with a
win against Connecticut in the semifinals,
the women will play for the NCAA title
today. This very exciting news has the entire
campus celebrating, and the student body
will no doubt be tuned into the game, which
will be shown at 5:30 in Kresge Auditorium.
One questions, however, how much atten
tion would have been paid to the women's
team up until the Finals had the men's team
stayed in the tournament. The recent past
suggests that such attention would have
been greatly diminished.
Women's teams on campus, and the fe
male superstars that help lead them to
greatness, need to be given their due re
spect. While the current enthusiasm for
women's basketball and the recognition of
Candice Wiggins's exemplary talent is com
mendable. it needs to be consistent. This
means vocal and enthusiastic support in the
regular season, not just in the final days of
the NCAA Tournament. While some dedi
cated students flew to Tampa to see the
semifinals and finals live, more students
need to attend the home games to provide
support early on.The next Candice Wiggins
should not be overshadowed by the next
Brook Lopez.
