# Pleading Inanity
## Arms wide shut

One might imagine that when devel
opment workers land in troubled
territories bearing aid and good will,
they are welcomed without hesitation.
Honestly, who would dare snub Santa Claus
coming down the chimney or the Tooth
Fairy at the pillow? But when these organi
zations bring with them "soft aid" like ca
pacity building and needs assessments, they
are often greeted with as much skepticism
as enthusiasm.
This was just one of many lessons we
learned this week during a meeting at the
Kalahari Sands hotel in the heart of the
capital, when the judicial capacity building
project met with the political landscape of
Namibia.
For those of you who didn't read my col
umn last week — if the existence of such
people can be posited — the judicial capac
ity building project's purpose is to facilitate
information sharing between local magis
trates and to promote the standardization
of their judgments. To this end. we are help
ing to establish a Web site, the Namibia Jus
tice Network, that will provide many of the
services that Westlaw and Lexis Nexis do in
the States, but free of cost and maintained
by the users themselves. Basically, the proj
ect is — as I believe you kids like to say
nowadays — "all of that in addition to a
satchel of chips," and, on Monday morning,
my group was fully confident in our ability
to convince Namibia's stakeholders of the
same.
Yet, as with most things in life, getting
buy-ins from the Namibian executive and
judiciary was a bit more complicated than it
seemed at first glance.The meeting's partic
ipants had clearly heard their fair share of
pitches for "high-quality, cheap and sus
tainable projects that would be of great
help to a developing nation such as their
own," and had learned from experience
that PowerPoint presentations are easier to
create than actual change. What's worse,
many development organizations' involve
ment in the country has been poorly
planned, ineptly executed or just purely po
litical. Thus, in spite of our group's quite
formidable .ppt prowess, the room re
mained unconvinced.
Some of the Namibian's concerns were
pragmatic: "How much will this cost us?'
one asked."Many magistrates lack IT train
ing," quipped another.
Some of their issues were historic in na
ture. "For eight years we've been working
on our own computer system to help the
magistrates; how will the Namibia Justice

Network coexist with that?" posed a promi
nent department head.
And, of course, the grittiest issues were
political: "We think that, before you start,
you should meet with the heads of Min
istries X, Y and Z to get their input and for
mal approval before starting your project.
We wouldn't want to ruffle anyone's feath
ers."
After absorbing this litany of anxieties,
we were a bit nonplussed. We had four
weeks left in country and only three before
the magistrates' conference where we had
planned to unveil our masterpiece. Meeting
with bureaucrats alone would take at least
that long, let alone attempting to research
the compatibility of the Namibia Justice
Network with their prior IT work.
"Can 1 speak for a moment?" our fear
less supervisor chimed in. "Maybe 1 can ad
dress your concerns."
What followed was a Hurry of assur
ances, appeasements and analysis that
transformed our project from being what
we had to offer into being exactly what they
wanted.To hear her tell it, the Namibia Jus
tice Network fit perfectly into the govern
ment's strategic plans and didn't upset the
delicate balance between the executive and
the judiciary branch.To hear her tell it, with
a little extra effort and a few additional
meetings, the Namibia Justice Network
would be the best thing to happen to
Namibia since Brangelina.
The fate of the Namibia Justice Net
work now lies in our hands. More so than
any other of Stanford's International
Human Rights Clinic's projects, its success
will depend largely on our ability to navi
gate the knotty intersections of personal,
institutional and departmental politics.
Within our own country, this task would be
difficult. In Namibia, among a people
whose culture, history and politics we are
only beginning to grasp, it'll be close to im
possible.

Brangelina, I'm waiting to be adopted so that
von can pay off my law school debt. Your peo
ple can reach my people at vishnus@
