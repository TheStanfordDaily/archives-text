# The 						endgame
## 
### 
I was startled to read recently that since the
Feb. 5 primaries, Barack Obama has
gained the support of superdelegates,
while Hillary Clinton has had a net loss of two
superdelegates. As the primary season nears
its final frantic finish, with Pennsylvania on
April 22 and a few other big states — most no
tably Indiana and North Carolina — left to go
in early May. the question is largely how the
Democratic race will end.
Both candidates seem to be prepar
ing to end the primaries as the victor. Recent
ly, Hillary Clinton went ahead and did some
thing she should have done a month ago and
canned Mark Penn.This gives her a chance to
make slight changes to her message as Barack
Obama moderates his message to appeal to
"beer track" Democrats in Pennsylvania.
After more than a year of endless debates
(more than 25 of them) and stump speeches,
the end is in sight. 1 remember this time last
year, when ASSU elections were being held,
the primary race between Hillary and Barack
was already going on. That means that the
ASSU is a more efficient election-holding
body than the Democratic Party. Go figure.
I want to emphasize that one again:
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY HAS
BEEN GOING ON FOR MORE THAN A
YEAR! THIS IS CRAZY! IT WAS SUP
POSED TO BE OVER BY NOW! Our
neighbors to the north, just emerging from
their hibernation, have elections that are only

six weeks long. Six weeks.That would be pret
ty sweet.
Last column, 1 argued that the only
way the Democrats could hope to retake the
White House was if Clinton and Obama were
on the same ticket. There's been some move
ment toward that goal recently: a new Web
site, voteboth.org, features a petition advocat
ing for a joint ticket.This campaign is obvious
ly a result of my powerful and deeply provoca
tive column. My column last quarter arguing
that I should be picked as the vice-presidential
nominee for either party (I don't care which)
has not yet had the same effect, although I am
rumored to be on John McCain's shortlist. Fin
gers crossed for that one.
I've been told over and over again
that there is no way the two candidates would
ever be on a ticket together. This may very
well be true, although it would break my
heart. What is more important is that the loser
exits the race gracefully when victory is ap
parent, clearing the stage for the nominee.
Clinton makes a compelling argument that

it's not quite yet over, and she's right — some
big states still have to vote, and if she wins the
overall popular vote.she has a case to be nom
inee. But at some point in the future, it will be
clear that it is over. The losing candidate
needs to exit in a way that preserves as much
of the winner's legitimacy as possible.'Hie De
mocrats have seen an enormous increase in
voter turnout. In many primaries, they have
outnumbered Republican turnout by two to
one.
The talk of many Democratic sup
porters on campus — that they w'll not vote if
their least-preferred candidate wins the nom
ination— is being replicated all over the
country. It is hard to imagine that 1 lillary Clin
ton is worse than John McCain to Obama sup
porters. And the duty of the loser will be to
rally support to the nominee, to prevent that
kind of animosity from hurting the party's
chances in a very important election. If they be
on the ticket, then the nominee at least needs
to campaign for the winner. In l l )76. Gerald
Ford barely beat Ronald Reagan in a long
drawn-out primary, and Jimmy Carter the
peanut farmer ended up beating Ford. De
mocrats would be wise to heed the errors of
the Republicans then and unite behind the
eventual winner.
