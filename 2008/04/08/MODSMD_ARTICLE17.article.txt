## The
						legacy experiment 
### 
I am grateful to Ihe Stanford Daily for en
gaging thoughtfully with the issue of "lega
cy" admissions ["Legacy still factor in ad
missions,"Apr. 4].The interviews with students
yielded a mix of reactions: some resentment,
some understanding and some concern that
perhaps we're pursuing a discriminatory poli
cy "for the money"
Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw made
the important point that, after all,"legacies" —
Stanford applicants with tine or more parents
possessing a Stanford degree — may also have
some of the academic advantages that fall to
offspring in households where intellectual as
pirations, service and other positive qualities
are valued and emphasized. 1 like that hypoth

esis, but doubters might say,"Well, those fami
lies can also afford to give their children tutors,
Kaplan tests and maybe 'smart drugs' giving
them an unfair advantage over students from
families with more limited means."
Well,there's a simple experiment that takes
us away from that issue by focusing on what
Stanford is really looking for. Is Stanford act
ing out of a desire to enhance the "chain of loy
alty" by admitting legacies in the hope of even
tual financial gain; or. instead, is it responding
primarily to the value it sees in other aspects of
their preparation for college? Take a given ap
plicant pool consisting of "Stanford legacies"
as defined above. This "Experimental" group,
after admission decisions are made, will have a

known average probability of admission p
compared with that of the pool as a whole.The
"Control group" will consist of all those appli
cants with one parent who went to Harvard
(add Yale, Princeton and MI T for more num
bers, or if you don't wish to appear too elitist).
The experiment rests on the assumption that
graduates of tup-tier universities are likely on
average to provide their offspring with equiva
lent household advantages.
OK. let's see how this turns out. If thep-val
ues for the 1 -xperimentals and the Controls are
equal or nearly equal, it's plain that Stanford
Admissions is not primarily financially moti-
