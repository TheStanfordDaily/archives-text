## Wyndam Makowsky Chemistry hard to find 
### 
When I was the sports editor at my high
school paper, I'd read a number of
stories per issue that had the same
line in one form or another: "This team's chem
istry is great, and it's showing on the court."
My response was always: "Prove it."
Unity is an important aspect of any team
sport that every team searches for, many unsuc
cessfully. Some professional franchises won't
even consider signing or drafting "had charac
ter" athletes — someone who may not play
well with others or has a history of disrupting
the peace — because they are so intent on
building a team, in every sense of the word.
Total cohesion goes a long way toward the
team's success. It's an intangible part of every
team sport that is rarely seen unless a squad
blatantly has it — or doesn't.
Chemistry isn't built over one night, week
end, month or maybe even a season. It can't be
created artificially. To merely state, then, that
"this team's chemistry is great" is not nearly
enough. It must be demonstrated over a
lengthy period of time, and its effect on the
team's play must be apparent.
The Stanford's women's basketball team is
the poster-group for team cohesion. They play
for each other as much as they play for the
school. They rarely, if ever, get down on each
other, always picking a teammate up when
needed. And it is always evident on the court, as
their enthusiasm, high-fives and huddles per
meate their games.
For the Cardinal, it starts at the top with
coach Tara VanDerveer and her staff, and sen
ior guard Candice Wiggins. VanDerveer is a
strict coach, but her affection for her players is
obvious.
"I have a great rapport with basically even
one on our team, and I love that. It's a really
great place to be," she said. "I think that any
coach would really love to coach this team."
"Tara has been great for us this season. She's
believed in us from day one and is really the
force that has made us the team we are," said
Wiggins. "I think this is a special team, with a
special coaching staff."
The quote from Wiggins is par for the course
— she's a superstar, but boasts no ego. She's
quick to share credit with her teammates and
coaches, a point I've made so often in my bas
ketball coverage that I'm becoming a broken
record. But it's worth repeating often because
of how rare such a mentality is for a player with
her talent and success.
When she was questioned about winning
the Wade Trophy — an award given not only
for her individual success tin the court, but for
her leadership abilities as well — she was quick
to talk about the importance of her teammates.
"I think just to have it this year, my last year
with this team, that I just so desperately love ..
. I think that's what makes it the most special,
because I can share it with the team," she said.
"This group is amazing."
Wiggins isn't afraid to let her emotions
show, and her teammates feed off of her.
"Candice is an incredible player, and we're all
just so lucky to get the opportunity to play with
her," said junior forward Jillian Harmon.
Wiggins is the type of player that makes
everyone around her better, and she is the tone
setter for the Cardinal.The team's cohesion has
become more noticeable as the season has pro
gressed — not that they didn't have chemistry
to begin with, but the team has settled into a
groove where their play has become, to a cer
tain extent, instinctive.
The team unity has thus found its way to the
floor: the Cardinal is clicking, and the offense
— particularly in transition — has excelled.
Engineering a successful attack on the run is
largely due to knowing where your teammates
will be on the floor.The team struggled here at
the beginning of the year, but the Stanford
women have proven that they can run with the
best of them — see: Connecticut.
Chalk part of it up to court awareness, but
credit the team for having the cohesion to do it
at all.
Wiggins attributes their recent
play with the team's unity. When
asked about the "magic" behind the
Cardinal's success, she said. "You
know, it's the type of chemistry that
you cannot fake."
Ihe proof is in the results, and as
Stanford has outlasted and dominat
ed opponent after opponent during
its run to the championship game, the
team has only gotten tighter.
And its play has only gotten bet
ter.
