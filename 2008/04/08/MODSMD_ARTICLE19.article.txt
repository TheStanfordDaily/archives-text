# WOMEN WORK IT OUT
## No. 5 Stanford gets big wins at home 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
What a difference a week makes.
Last week against Arizona State, the
No. 5 Stanford women's tennis team was
swept in doubles in its first four-loss sea
son in over two decades — all this with
USC and UCLA headed to town.
But the Cardinal women finally real
ized the solution to their woes — hard
work.
"When we came off the ASU loss, we
knew we just had to work harder," head
coach Lele Forood said. "We needed to
decide that everybody needed to work
harder to get where we needed to be be
cause the LAs were coming up the fol
lowing weekend. There was a renewed
commitment for everybody to just work
harder and put in more time.
"We needed to make the realization
that the effort will be rewarded, and ba
sically that was validated this weekend."
A change befell the Cardinal women
over the past week in practice, so much
that Forood was able to predict a good
weekend for Stanford.
And against two very tough Los An
geles squads, the Cardinal needed every
last bit of its energy and will to escape
the weekend undefeated.
"We're definitely different in terms of
mentality," Forood said. "It was a good
turn-around weekend for us. Obviously,
things aren't perfect, since we have a
starter injured. But, we needed to get
each person feeling better about the
level they're playing at. and we're much
closer towards our goal of playing much
closer to our capability."
Over the weekend, comebacks were
an underlying theme to the Cardinal's
success.

Against USC, junior Jessica Nguyen
showed signs of finally reaching full
strength after injuring herself at Nation
al Indoors earlier this season.
At No. 2 singles, Nguyen faced Aman
da Fink, the top-ranked player for USC.
Both had split their first two meetings
this season.
After struggling and dropping the
first set. Nguyen came back to win 4-6. b
-3,1-0(10-4),and Stanford would goon to
defeat USC 5-2.
"Even more than whom she's beating,
it was more important for her to start
feeling comfortable about her play,"
Forood said of Nguyen. "1 thought she
was playing very well at Indoors in Feb
ruary. But because of the injury with not
being able to hit a two-handed backhand
for a month and having to reinvent her
game during that period, it's just not
going to be easy to perform to your capa
bility. Coming off that injury she strug
gled a little, which is expected. She's got
a little more ways to go, but we're a lot
closer than we were."
Stanford faced UCLA on Saturday,
the 2007 national runner-up. In a tight
matchup, Stanford needed every point it
could get in the match.
One of the biggest stories from the
competition was senior Celia Durkin's
victory over UCLA's Andrea Remynse.
The day before. Durkin dominated in
her match against Gabriela Niculescu of
USC, winning 6-1, 6-1. On Saturday,
Durkin was blanked in a dismal first set.

before an inspired comeback win, 0-6,6-
3,6-2.
"For [Celia] to collect herself and
move forward and find her game imme
diately in the second set was really an
amazing accomplishment," Forood said.
"That takes real mental fortitude. Celia
is capable of some great things, and that
was one of the most incredible feats I've
seen over the years of someone who
could change her game so radically from
playing very poorly to really dominating
a match after the first set."
At No. 1 singles, freshman Hilary
Barte clinched the match for the Card
with a gutsy 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over
UCLA's Riza Zalameda. It was Barte's
13th straight victory.
"I lilary's just continuing to do an in
credible job. being undefeated for the last
two months now." Forood said. "She's re
ally getting the job done every single day.
It's given a huge level of confidence to
our team, that we have a No. 1 player that
goes out and wins every day.and that just
helps throughout the lineup."
Eventually, Stanford would win the
match 5-2, even after losing the doubles
point. According to Forood, the victory
certainly has affected the mindset of the
squad in the long run.
"It's really important for any team to
realize that they can beat another team
after losing the doubles point. You have
to think that you can win four singles
matches against a good team."
With four matches to go in the regular
season, the Cardinal women are a much
different squad in terms of mindset and
ability. Now carrying a swagger with a
lineup that can will its way to victory,
Stanford appears poised to make a run to
reclaim the national title.
Stanford returns to action Wednesday

against Sacramento State. The match
was postponed earlier in the season due

before an inspired comeback win, 0-6,6-
3,6-2.
"For [Celia] to collect herself and
move forward and find her game imme
diately in the second set was really an
amazing accomplishment," Forood said.
"That takes real mental fortitude. Celia
is capable of some great things, and that
was one of the most incredible feats I've
seen over the years of someone who
could change her game so radically from
playing very poorly to really dominating
a match after the first set."
At No. 1 singles, freshman Hilary
Barte clinched the match for the Card
with a gutsy 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over
UCLA's Riza Zalameda. It was Barte's
13th straight victory.
"I lilary's just continuing to do an in
credible job. being undefeated for the last
two months now." Forood said. "She's re
ally getting the job done every single day.
It's given a huge level of confidence to
our team, that we have a No. 1 player that
goes out and wins every day.and that just
helps throughout the lineup."
Eventually, Stanford would win the
match 5-2, even after losing the doubles
point. According to Forood, the victory
certainly has affected the mindset of the
squad in the long run.
"It's really important for any team to
realize that they can beat another team
after losing the doubles point. You have
to think that you can win four singles
matches against a good team."
With four matches to go in the regular
season, the Cardinal women are a much
different squad in terms of mindset and
ability. Now carrying a swagger with a
lineup that can will its way to victory,
Stanford appears poised to make a run to
reclaim the national title.
Stanford returns to action Wednesday
at 1:30 p.m. in a rescheduled match
against Sacramento State. The match
was postponed earlier in the season due
to rain.
