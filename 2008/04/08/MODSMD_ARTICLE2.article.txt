## Farm pushes econ. diversity Bridge program may be option for future admits

The number of first-generation college
students admitted to Stanford increased
to 431 this year from 347 last year, say
Department of Admission officials. This
change represents a rise from 14 percent
to 17 percent of the admitted incoming
class.
"The pool of first-generation candi
dates this year was just exceptionally
strong," Director of Admission Shawn
Abbott said in an email to The Daily, indi
cating that the increase was not due to any
new policies.
"We do act affirmatively for first-gen
eration candidates but always have,"
Abbott continued. "We're not evaluating
candidates any differently"
The rise in first-generation admits
comes after Stanford's efforts to reach out
to diverse socio-economic classes through
increased financial aid. On Feb. 20.
Stanford announced that parents with
incomes less than $100,000 a year will not
pay tuition, and parents earning under
$60,000 will not pay tuition, room, board
or fees.
"We're hoping the new financial aid
initiatives which will take effect this fall
will hopefully inspire more students from
disadvantaged backgrounds to at least
consider Stanford when they apply to col
lege," Abbott said.
As a part of the larger effort to reach
out to first-generation students and those
from under-resourced high schools,
Stanford has joined a joint recruitment
program with Duke, Harvard,
Georgetown and Pennsylvania called
Exploring College Options. This program
reaches out to high school students in sec
ondary markets like El Paso, Fargo and
Louisville, Abbott said.
Stanford is also embarking on a new
joint effort with Cornell and Columbia to
recruit at Native American reservations
across the U.S., Abbott said. This, along
with existing relationships with non-prof
its that serve first-generation students,
represents the effort to reach out to stu
dents who normally do not receive direct
exposure to Stanford through college
fairs.
But outreach to first-generation stu
dents and those from under-resourced
high schools does not stop after letters of
admission are mailed. Stanford is consid
ering a summer "bridge" program for
incoming freshmen from under-resourced
high schools.
The program is not specifically a
response to the increase in first-genera
tion students, but will be open to some
first-generation students and others who
come from schools that have high student-
