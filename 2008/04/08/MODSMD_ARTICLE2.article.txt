## Farm pushes econ. diversity Bridge program may be option for future admits 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
The number of first-generation college
students admitted to Stanford increased
to 431 this year from 347 last year, say
Department of Admission officials. This
change represents a rise from 14 percent
to 17 percent of the admitted incoming
class.
"The pool of first-generation candi
dates this year was just exceptionally
strong," Director of Admission Shawn
Abbott said in an email to The Daily, indi
cating that the increase was not due to any
new policies.
"We do act affirmatively for first-gen
eration candidates but always have,"
Abbott continued. "We're not evaluating
candidates any differently"
The rise in first-generation admits
comes after Stanford's efforts to reach out
to diverse socio-economic classes through
increased financial aid. On Feb. 20.
Stanford announced that parents with
incomes less than $100,000 a year will not
pay tuition, and parents earning under
$60,000 will not pay tuition, room, board
or fees.
"We're hoping the new financial aid
initiatives which will take effect this fall
will hopefully inspire more students from
disadvantaged backgrounds to at least
consider Stanford when they apply to col
lege," Abbott said.
As a part of the larger effort to reach
out to first-generation students and those
from under-resourced high schools,
Stanford has joined a joint recruitment
program with Duke, Harvard,
Georgetown and Pennsylvania called
Exploring College Options. This program
reaches out to high school students in sec
ondary markets like El Paso, Fargo and
Louisville, Abbott said.
Stanford is also embarking on a new
joint effort with Cornell and Columbia to
recruit at Native American reservations
across the U.S., Abbott said. This, along
with existing relationships with non-prof
its that serve first-generation students,
represents the effort to reach out to stu
dents who normally do not receive direct
exposure to Stanford through college
fairs.
But outreach to first-generation stu
dents and those from under-resourced
high schools does not stop after letters of
admission are mailed. Stanford is consid
ering a summer "bridge" program for
incoming freshmen from under-resourced
high schools.
The program is not specifically a
response to the increase in first-genera
tion students, but will be open to some
first-generation students and others who
come from schools that have high student-
teacher ratios or lack resources such as advising or col
lege preparatory programs.
"If this program is implemented at Stanford, it will
be an intellectually rigorous, academically focused pro
gram," Drama Prof. Harry Elam said in an email to The
Daily. Elam. the Senior Associate Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE), added that stu
dent focus groups to be held later this month will be an
important part of developing the program design and
content.
Roxanne Parker '10, who will participate in the
upcoming focus groups, said in an email to The Daily
that adjusting to some academic areas at Stanford was
difficult, but the most positive result of such a program
would be its social benefits.
"Within the program, low-income students would
be able to find and connect with each other, which is
something that can be really hard to do at Stanford,"
Parker said. "This was definitely one of the hardest
parts for me — when 1 was having financial troubles
paying for text books ... I felt like 1 didn't have anyone
to talk to who understood."
Amanda Romero '09. another first-generation stu
dent, was of the opposite opinion.
"1 think it might be strange to have a class full of
students that are first-generation and from under
resourced high schools, and it might make them feel
even more different from their peers," Romero said in
an email to The Daily.
The "bridge" program is in its primary stages, Elam
said, so neither the criteria for entry into the program
nor the specifics of what the program might entail have
been decided. In order to determine which students
will be asked to participate, the VPUE is working with
Undergraduate Admissions, talking with faculty and
staff and investigating programs at other schools.
Elam says that student input through the upcoming
focus groups is the first step in evaluating how to assist
students from under-resourced high schools.
"Entering Stanford as a freshman for any student
can be a daunting experience," Elam said. "We want to
know how best to capitalize on the contributions that
students from under-resourced schools can bring to
Stanford."
