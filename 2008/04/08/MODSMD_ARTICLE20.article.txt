## Card gets two wins on road No. 2 Stanford beats Cal State Northridge, No. 3 USC 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The offensive output slowed down, as it in
evitably would. But the Cardinal did not.
After averaging almost 17 goals per game over
their last three matches, the Stanford women's
water polo team had 13 and eight in their two
games this weekend. But the Cardinal defense
came up big to help the team defeat both Cal State-
Northridge and N0.3 USC.securing another SoCal
sweep and extending the team's current win streak
to a season-high eight games.
The No. 2 women started their weekend against
Northridge on Friday afternoon. The Matadors
were ranked No. 15 in the nation, but had only
picked up one conference win in seven tries. Stan
ford started a little slow but was able to take a 2-0
lead on goals from sophomore Kelly Eaton and
junior Heather West before Northridge got one
back. The Card would then go on a 5-0 run for the
rest of the half, with three goals coming from junior
Lauren Silver which brought the score to 7-1.
Ilie Matadors grabbed the first goal of the sec
ond hall but Stanford squelched any comeback
hopes by scoring four unanswered goals.ending the
third period up 11-2. The Cardinal would go on to
win 13-4.
Stanford coach John Tanner was pleased with
the win. especially given what he called "some dif
ficult circumstances."
"Northridge plays much better at home, in part
because they have a small pool, which creates prob
lems for spacing on offense and doesn't allow much
counter attack," said Tanner. "We missed our first
five shots [but] then got into rhythm, and our de
fense was good throughout."
Silver ended the day with four goals, while
Eaton. West and senior Jackie Gauthier each
chipped in with two for the Card. Freshman goal
keeper Amber Oland put in a very strong defensive
effort with eight saves.
Next up was a Saturday matchup with USC in
Los Angeles. The Women of Troy were one of only
two teams to beat the Card this year — the other
being undefeated UCLA. Ilie two teams had
played twice previously, with USC winning by one
in the Stanford Invitational, and Stanford winning
by the same margin in overtime later that month in
the Irvine Tournament. It was clear that the rubber
match would be just as tense.
1 lowever. the beginning of the game did not
stick to that script, as Stanford scored the first three
goals of the match, two by Eaton and another from
sophomore Kelsey Holshouser. But USC soon
made it close again, scoring the game's next two
goals to make the halftime score 3-2.
USC scored the first two goals of the second half
to take their first lead of the game, but Eaton tied it
up on an extra-attacker situation before the quar
ter was over. Both squads tightened up their de
fense in the fourth quarter, but USC was able to
once again gain the advantage through a goal by
Veronika Bartunkova with just over three minutes
left. It looked as though USC would hold on for an-

other one goal victory, but once again
it was Eaton to the rescue for the
Card. She tied the score with just 45
seconds remaining in the game to
force overtime.
Stanford came out firing in the first
overtime period, getting goals from
West, Silver, and Gauthier, while USC

only scored once.The score was <S-6 in
favor of Stanford heading into the final
period, but USC scored once more to
cut the deficit to one. I lowever. Oland
blocked a backhand by IJSC's Miran

serve an 8-7 Cardinal victory.
"At USC we let a good lead slip
away, which was disappointing, but we
came up with goals when we needed
them to force overtime," said Tanner.
"Then we played well in the extra pe
riods."
Eaton turned in a monster per

formance on offense, leading the way
for the Card with half of the team's
eight goals. Oland was once again
great in the cage, this time stopping 11
Trojan shots. The win brings Stan
ford's record to 20-3 on the season and
8-1 in the MPSFwith only three regu
lar season matches remaining. The
team returns to the pool this Friday
when it takes on rival Oil at Avery Sta
dium.
