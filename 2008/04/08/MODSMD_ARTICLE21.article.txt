# Stanford swept on road
## Cardinal drops matches to UCLA, USC 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Three straight wins last week did not give the
Stanford men's tennis team enough momentum
for this past weekend.as the Card dropped a pair
of matches on the road in I .os Angeles. Stanford
fell to No. 5 USC on Friday,6-1. On Saturday, the
squad fell by the exact same score to No. 4
UCLA.
The No. 25 Cardinal couldn't get much going
all weekend. In all, the team went 0-6 in doubles
and 2-10 in singles. Stanford is now S-S on the sea
son.
Freshman No. 2 Alex Clayton — the most
consistent player in the lineup t his season — was
beaten twice on the weekend. It was the first time
this season he had suffered consecutive losses.
After winning lOoutof 11 singles matches.Clay
ton has now lost three in a row.

Junior No. 67 Matt Bruch also lost twice,
snapping a six-match winning streak in singles.
He and partner Blake Muller also lost twice in
doubles after winning three straight last week.
The No. 3 doubles team of sophomore Richard
Wire and freshman Greg Hirshman. who were
17-7 on the year entering the weekend, lost twice,
as well.
But it wasn't all bad. The highlight of the
weekend for Stanford was Wire, who captured
the only Stanford points on both days. On Friday
against I JSC, he beat No. 53 Gary Sacks 3-6.7-6,
1-0 (10-8). Since USC had already clinched the
match, the third set was just a tiebreaker, and
Wire prevailed tocapture the win at N0.4 singles.
On Saturday, Wire defeated Michael Look of
UCLA. 3-6,6-3,6-4, for the Cardinals only point
of the match.
"It was really pleasing to get the wins," Wire
said. "I didn't play too well, and it was a hard
place to play. I competed hard and was fortunate
to pull out the matches."
"Part of it was getting used to the conditions,
and part of it was getting used to who I was play
ing." Wire said of his first set losses on both days.
"But 1 stepped up my game in the second and

third [sets]."
I lead coach John Whit linger and other team
members had mentioned that the conditions
would be tough at both USC and IJCLA. After
the weekend. Wire agreed.
"The crowd and courts at USC were particu
larly hard — they were different from what we
were used to." he said.
Stanford will now welcome Saint Mar> s to
the Farm today, the first match of the team s final
homestand of the season. The game takes place


Sophomore Richard Wire was the only Stanford player to win a match this weekend in Los An
geles. The men's team fell to USC and UCLA over the weekend.
at 1:30 p.m. at theTaube Family Tennis
Center.
Ibe Gaels are 13-4 on the season

and led by Joel Kusnierz.who was a per
fect 7-0 in singles matches in the month
of March and is 13-2 overall this season.
Additionally. Lucas Pirelli and Andrea
Zannoni are both 12-5 in singles play
this year.
Ibe fact that Stanford has now
faced the Los Angeles schools twice
each will certainly pay dividends

against teams who are not as talented
as the fourth- and fifth-ranked teams
in the nation.
"We can get three wins this week,"
Wire said. "If we play our best, we
should be able to take [the matches]."
