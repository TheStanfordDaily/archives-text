# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Stanford stands up for West 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The image is nearly impossible to forget.
Stanford's locker room on one side of the screen;
Mary land's clubhouse on the other. The No. 1 seed
in the Spokane Regional is announced: the Terrap
ins are awarded the No. 1 seed over the Cardinal.
Maryland's players rejoice; Stanford's barely move.
Cardinal supporters — if not the team itself —
rolled their eyes and shook their heads. To them, it
was yet another example of east coast bias.
The claim that writers and NCAA committee
members favor east coast teams over those of the
west is fairly easy to explain: west coast games start
(very) late on the east coast, to the point that many
would rather sleep than spend two hours watching a
game. And even if they wanted to stay up late, the
Pac-10'sTV deal with Fox Sports Net means that
only certain cable subscribers would be able to
watch the game. This has led to considerably more
hype for teams like Connecticut, Tennessee and

Maryland than for squads like Stanford and Califor
nia.
It's not just the TV situation, though, which has
led to this bias. The east simply has more women's
basketball powerhouses than the west. Stanford is
the only west coast team to make the Final Four in
the past 20 years, and even they had an 11 -year
drought before returning this year. East coast (and
even midwest) teams have thus dominated the na
tional debate, and rightly so.
However, the infatuation with the Connecticuts
andTennessees of the basketball world has led many
to overlook the talent of this year's Stanford team,
one that was victorious over opponents such as the
then-No. 1 Lady Vols and No. 3 Rutgers. They also
beat Cal (a top-10 team for most of the season) three
times, including a 56-35 thumping in the Pac-1()
Tournament Championship game.
With its impressive resume in hand, Stanford felt
confident that it would receive a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA Tournament. As the bracket placements
came in. it became clear that the final one seed
would be given to either Stanford or Maryland, a
team that didn't even make it to the finals of their
conference tournament.
When the announcement came in. the Cardinal's
shock was clear: the team was both dumbfounded
and angry. This quickly translated into added moti
vation for the tournament.
"I think that them giving us a No. 2 seed was the
best thing they could have done for us," said fresh
man forward Kayla Pedersen on Sunday. "That just

motivated us and gave us that extra push to show the
east coast what we're all about."
"I think that from the very beginning everyone
saw our faces plastered all over ESPN at the seeding
show when we got the No. 2 seed," said sophomore
center Jayne Appel. "I think it almost drives us more
to prove not only to ourselves but to everyone else
that we can play with the east coast teams."
Indeed. Stanford's already-torrent pace only
picked up during the tournament, as it has dis
patched opponents handily, capping off the current
run with a solid win on Sunday over Connecticut, a
media darling considered by many to be the most
elite program in the country and the best this year.
"I think it was important for us to show through
our play instead of through words." said senior
guard Candice Wiggins.
If Stanford can topple the giant that is Tennessee
tonight, then the Card's NCAA tournament victory'
can be seen not only as a momentous win for the
school,but as a victory for the Pac-10 — and the rest
of the west coast teams — as well.
It will shift the national discussion — for the time
being. In order to keep the focus there, Stanford and
Cal, as well as other western programs, will have to
continue to find success.
But Appel isn't worried.
"We have a lot of talent out there," she said. "And
1 think there will be a lot more in the years to come."
