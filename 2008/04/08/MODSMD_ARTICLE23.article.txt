# TRACK AND FIELD
## Stanford runners impress at home 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford track and field team
was successful this past weekend,
competing at two separate meets.
Three Stanford multi-event athletes
competed in the Cal Multis in
Berkeley. Calif., while the rest of the
team was at the Stanford Invitation
al on Saturday and Sunday.
On Thursday, the second and
final day of the Cal Multi Event
meet, freshman Whitney Liehr
placed second in the heptathlon with
a score of 4,947 points. Sophomore
Kara Bennett finished fourth with
4.523 points. Representing the men
in the decathlon, freshman Corey
Dysick finished in third place with
6,345 points. Liehr said this was her
"first collegiate heptathlon." and she
was "pleased with the overall per
formance."
Immediately following the Cal
Multis, Stanford hosted its biggest
meet of the year, the Stanford Invi
tational. where some of the best col
legiate and high school runners in
the nation gathered for a weekend
of competition.
The Cardinal men were led by
junior hurdler Myles Bradley, who
ran a personal best as well as an
NCAA regional qualifying time of
13.96 seconds in the 110 hurdles in
the prelims, to enter finals seeded
first. His time also moved him into
second place all-time at Stanford in
the event. However, the next day in
the finals, Bradley was closely edged
out for first by Timothy Bogdanof
(who ran unattached) in one of the
most exciting races of the day.
Also in the sprints, senior
Wopamo Osaisai achieved an
NCAA regional qualifying time in
the 100-meter dash with a time of
10.51 seconds. Osaisai is the Stan
ford record-holder in the event and
was slightly off his best time of 10.39
seconds, set in 2005.
Three Stanford men achieved re
gional qualifying times in the 800-
meter run. Senior Russell Brown fin
ished third overall with a time of
1:48.66. closely followed by senior
Michael Garcia, who finished fourth
with a time of 1:49.18. Junior Garrett
Heath, an outstanding miler for the
Cardinal, finished eighth with a per
sonal best time of 1:49.70. All three
men qualifed for NCAA regionals in
the event.
On day two of the meet. Brown
came back to provide an amazing
performance in the 1500 meters,
beating Stanford record-holder and
2000 Olympian Michael Stember to
win the event, easily achieving a re

gional mark with his time of 3:42.58.
"[I was] ecstatic about how this
weekend went, as my goals this year
are about places not times," Brown
said.
"Obviously, beating Stember was
special," he continued. "However,
the fact is. he is just beginning to get
into shape, and 1 didn't beat him at
his best. If I can get him by the end of
this year, then I will have accom
plished something really special.
More than anything, though, I'd like
to see the two of us running well at
the same time, because he has been a
hero of mine for a long time."
Senior Jacob Evans also achieved
a regional mark in the 1500 with a
personal best time of 3:46.76. Junior
Hakon DeVries barely missed the
regional standard, running a 3:46.63,
despite running the last part of the
race with only one shoe, after losing
his other to a competitor who
stepped on his foot.
In the field events, senior Graeme
Hoste won one section of the pole
vault, improving his regional mark
to 17-0 3/4, while freshman Casey
Roche won the other section of the
event with a mark of 16-6 3/4. Senior
Kyle Davis-Hammerquist also had a
personal best in the discus with a
throw of 163-08. In the shot put, sen
ior Mike Macellari earned a region
al qualifying standard with a toss of
56-1.
For the women, senior Dani
Maier not only achieved a regional
mark and won the javelin throw, but
she also broke her own school
record with a throw of 174-00. Also
in the field events, junior Lauren
Stewart won the meet title in the
high jump with a regional mark of 5-
8 3/4. Sophomore Jaynie Goodbody
also earned a regional qualifying
mark in the hammer throw with a
personal best of 193-6.
The female runners had several
strong showings, led by senior Lau
ren Centrowitz and junior Alicia
Follmar in the 800 meters. Both
ladies earned regional qualifying
marks in the event. They doubled
back on day two of the meet to place
third and fifth, respectively, in the
1500-meter run, both earning re
gional qualifying marks. Other re
gional marks in the distances came
from senior Lindsay Allen and soph
omore Kate Niehaus in the 5,000-
meter run.
Stanford will run next at the Big
Meet this coming weekend at Cal as
it hopes to earn Bay Area track and
field bragging rights.
