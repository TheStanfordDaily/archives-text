## Kansas surges past Memphis for NCAA title 
### EDDIE PELLS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN ANTONIO —So patient
for 20 years, Kansas had no problem
working an extra five minutes to
bring a long-awaited championship
back to the heartland.
Mario Chalmers hit a 3-pointer
with 2.1 seconds left in regulation to
push the game into overtime, and the
Jayhawks grinded it out from there
for a 75-68 victory Monday night over
Memphis in one of the best title
games in recent memory.
Chalmers' shot pulled Kansas into
a tie after being down nine with 2:12
left.
"We got the ball in our most clutch
player's hands, and he delivered,"
Kansas coach Bill Self said.
it was the first title for Kansas
since 1988. when Danny Manning,

now an assistant coach for the Jay
hawks, led them to an upset of Okla
homa. And the shot earned Chalmers
the most outstanding player honor.
"I had a good look at it," Chalmers
said. "When it left my hands it felt like
it was good, and it just went in."
The most memorable perform
ance in this one came from freshman
Derrick Rose of Memphis, who com
pletely took over the game in the
second half, scoring 14 of his team's
16 points during one stretch to lift
the Tigers to a 60-51 lead with 2:12
left.
But Kansas (37-3) used the strate
gy any smart opponent of Memphis'
would — fouling the heck out of one
of the country's worst free-throw
shooting teams — and when Rose
and Chris Douglas-Roberts com
bined to miss four of five over the last
1:12, it left the door open for KU.
