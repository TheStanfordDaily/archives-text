GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford plays for the
National Championship tonight against
No. 1 seed Tennessee. Stanford beat
Connecticut 82-73 on Sunday in the
National Semifinals, while Tennessee
needed every second to beat LSU, 47-
46. Stanford has already beaten
Tennessee this year, a 73-69 overtime
win in December. Stanford has now won
23 straight games, but tonight's match
might be the only one that matters.

seeds en route to the final game.
Connecticut, the No. 1 overall seed
in the tournament, was the team's
latest victim, falling to the Cardinal
on Sunday night. Stanford will look
to make it three straight against a
Tennessee team that struggled in its
semifinal game against LSU, but
still poses a dangerous threat to the
Cardinal's title hopes.
"It's the national championship
game. So 1 think that a lot is on the
line," said senior guard Candice
Wiggins. "1 think both teams are
going to be playing hard because of
that. It's not the middle of the sea
son. This is it."
Stanford is indisputably playing
the best basketball in the country
right now. The Cardinal women
have won 23 straight games, and the
team seems to improve with each
passing match — their success is on
a curve that never seems to reach
its peak.
Wiggins is playing some of the
best basketball of her career, having
put up two 40-point games during
the tournament. But she's been
more than just a shooter: she's
crashed the boards well (she led the
team with 13 against Connecticut)
and has found the appropriate pass
ing lanes to get the ball to her team
mates.
But Stanford's success is not
solely Wiggins's doing.

Senior Candice Wiggins has done just about everything for
the Cardinal this year. She and the rest of the Stanford
team are one win away from a National Championship.
put together a very nice tournament
with her rebounding, post defense and
scoring, often drawing the attention of
more than one defender.
"Whenever you have someone like
Jayne on the block, leaving her one-on
one is not a smart idea." said sopho
more guard JJ Hones. "I felt like my
defender would lose me just a little bit
looking at Jayne and being so worried
about her. Jayne has great vision and is
able to kick the ball out."
Freshman forward Kayla Pedersen
has exhibited her range and. despite
getting some of the most difficult de
fensive assignments all tournament
long, has done an excellent job of shut
ting down opponents' top players, such
as Connecticut's Ail-American Maya
Moore.
Additionally, Hones burst onto the
national scene with her career-high 23-
point performance against Maryland
in the Elite Eight. Junior forward Jil
lian 1 larmon has been an effective en
ergy player off the bench, crashing the
boards and diving for loose balls while
adding her share of points as well.
Stanford has clicked, and has found
contributions from a variety of players.
"Probably the reason that we're
here is because we do have that bal
ance," said coach Tara VanDerveer.
The team has been in a groove for
over three months now.and it continues
into tonight's match up against a Ten
nessee team with a fairly different tale.
Though dominant throughout the
year, the Lady Vols' offense has sput
tered as of late, and they've been un
able to put teams away convincingly
since the second round of the tourna
ment. To make matters worse, their
star, multipurpose junior Candace
Parker, who was largely responsible
for their Sweet 16 win over Notre
Dame and Elite Eight victory over
Texas A&M. has been hampered by a
shoulder injury. It showed against the
Tigers, as she finished a paltry 6-for-27

from the field.
From the looks of things, Stanford
has all the momentum it could hope
for. while Tennessee is struggling.
"They're a better team right now."
said Tennessee coach Pat Summitt.
But the Cardinal cannot sleep on
the Lady Vols, who, much like the Car
dinal. have threats across the floor but
employ a small rotation, using only
about eight players per game.
It starts with Parker, the AP Player
of the Year, who can play nearly any
position on the floor but likes to spot
up inside. Pedersen will be charged
with guarding her, and has already said
that she'll try to force her to her left
under the basket so she'll have to use
her weaker hand. Pedersen and Appel
will have to be particularly diligent
with their rebounding, as Parker is one
of the best rebounders in the nation.
But Parker isn't the only piece to
the Tennessee puzzle. Alexis Horn
buckle and Shannon Bobbitt are both
threats from the guard positions —
I lornbuckle, a defensive star, will be
tasked with guarding Wiggins.
"I have a tough defensive assign
ment."she said, i can't rest.and I can't
take a possession off."
Along with Parker. Alberta Au
guste and Nicky Anosike fill out a dan
gerous front line. But none of the four
starters besides Parker have been par
ticularly consistent during the NCAA
Tournament, which has put the brunt
of the scoring on Parker's already
weakened shoulders. Still, all are capa
ble of erupting at any time, and if Park
er can regain her form and her team
mates can put together solid perform
ances. they'll be in a prime position to
take down the Cardinal.
Wiggins had nothing but praise for
her opponents — specifically. Parker.
"There's nobody in the game like
her. And I think she's carrying all the
pressure
reallv well," Wiggins said.

Hie two teams have already met
once earlier in the season at Maples.
Stanford pulled out a thrilling over
time win. 73-69, over then-No. 1 ranked
Tennessee. The victory instilled confi
dence in the Cardinal and left the Lady
Vols seeking revenge.
"I remember the Stanford game
like it was yesterday." said Parker. "It
ruined our Christmas."
"Of course they're going to he moti
vated that we beat them before," said
Pedersen. "But 1 also think we know
them, and we know that we can beat
them."

The national championship alone
provides all the incentive the Cardinal
needs.
"Everybody is going to be trying to
find motivation wherever they can."
said redshirt sophomore guard Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude. "Tennessee's
been here before.They won a national
championship last year. And they have
theirs. There's going to be one game
left. Why shouldn't we win? Just go for
it. It's our turn."
