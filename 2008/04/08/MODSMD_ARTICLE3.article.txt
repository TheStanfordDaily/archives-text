GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford plays for the
National Championship tonight against
No. 1 seed Tennessee. Stanford beat
Connecticut 82-73 on Sunday in the
National Semifinals, while Tennessee
needed every second to beat LSU, 47-
46. Stanford has already beaten
Tennessee this year, a 73-69 overtime
win in December. Stanford has now won
23 straight games, but tonight's match
might be the only one that matters.

seeds en route to the final game.
Connecticut, the No. 1 overall seed
in the tournament, was the team's
latest victim, falling to the Cardinal
on Sunday night. Stanford will look
to make it three straight against a
Tennessee team that struggled in its
semifinal game against LSU, but
still poses a dangerous threat to the
Cardinal's title hopes.
"It's the national championship
game. So 1 think that a lot is on the
line," said senior guard Candice
Wiggins. "1 think both teams are
going to be playing hard because of
that. It's not the middle of the sea
son. This is it."
Stanford is indisputably playing
the best basketball in the country
right now. The Cardinal women
have won 23 straight games, and the
team seems to improve with each
passing match â€” their success is on
a curve that never seems to reach
its peak.
Wiggins is playing some of the
best basketball of her career, having
put up two 40-point games during
the tournament. But she's been
more than just a shooter: she's
crashed the boards well (she led the
team with 13 against Connecticut)
and has found the appropriate pass
ing lanes to get the ball to her team
mates.
But Stanford's success is not
solely Wiggins's doing.

Senior Candice Wiggins has done just about everything for
the Cardinal this year. She and the rest of the Stanford
team are one win away from a National Championship.
