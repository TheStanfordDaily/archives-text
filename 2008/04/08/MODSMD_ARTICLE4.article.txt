### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students campaigning for gender-neutral
housing scored a victory yesterday, when
Student Housing and Residential Education
announced a pilot program for gender-blind
housing in the coming fall quarter.
Ihrough gender-neutral housing, students
may elect to live with students of the opposite
gender. Currently, males and females can only
room together in cooperative houses, where
the University turns a blind eye to cross-gen
der living arrangements, or in couples' housing
in Escondido Village.
IT»e new program puts Stanford in line with

several colleges across the nation that arc also
considering or have already implemented gen
der-neutral housing policies, including
Wesleyan. Oberlin, Clark, Dartmouth. Brown
and the University of Pennsylvania.
Gender-neutral housing options will be
tested during the 2008-2009 academic year at
five locations: Row houses Narnia and Terra,
the upperclassmen residence hall Castano,
undergraduate apartment complex Mirrielees
and graduate apartment complex Rains.
"We chose these houses because of key
structural reasons, such as suite style or two
room double living situations, anil the exis
tence of a private bathroom with a lock," said
Jonathan Kass' 10, the student life housing and

education committee chair for the
Undergraduate Senate.
Gender-neutral housing options will not be
offered to freshmen or in four-class houses.
No changes will be made to the Draw
process due to this policy change. Instead, stu
dents in the specific locations will have the
option of requesting a roommate of another
gender through the in-house Draw or gradu
ate room assignment process, said Sue Nunan.
director of Housing Assignments. Students of
different genders who do not know each other
will not be placed in the same room.
"In the Draw/Lottery, Title IX require
ments will continue to be met to obtain the
overall balance between male and female stu

dents in each campus housing location,"
Nunan said in a press release.
Plans for implementation of a gender-neu
tral rooming policy have been in the works
since last academic year. In spring 2007.
Shirley Everett, senior associate vice provost
for Residential & Dining Enterprises, and
Greg Boardman. vice provost for Student
Affairs, convened a Gender Neutral Task
Force (GNTF) to explore the possibility of
offering gender-neutral housing options to
upperclassmen and graduate students at
Stanford.
