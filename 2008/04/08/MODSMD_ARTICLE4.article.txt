# Gender-neutral housing plan unveiled
## 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students campaigning for gender-neutral
housing scored a victory yesterday, when
Student Housing and Residential Education
announced a pilot program for gender-blind
housing in the coming fall quarter.
Ihrough gender-neutral housing, students
may elect to live with students of the opposite
gender. Currently, males and females can only
room together in cooperative houses, where
the University turns a blind eye to cross-gen
der living arrangements, or in couples' housing
in Escondido Village.
IT»e new program puts Stanford in line with

several colleges across the nation that arc also
considering or have already implemented gen
der-neutral housing policies, including
Wesleyan. Oberlin, Clark, Dartmouth. Brown
and the University of Pennsylvania.
Gender-neutral housing options will be
tested during the 2008-2009 academic year at
five locations: Row houses Narnia and Terra,
the upperclassmen residence hall Castano,
undergraduate apartment complex Mirrielees
and graduate apartment complex Rains.
"We chose these houses because of key
structural reasons, such as suite style or two
room double living situations, anil the exis
tence of a private bathroom with a lock," said
Jonathan Kass' 10, the student life housing and

education committee chair for the
Undergraduate Senate.
Gender-neutral housing options will not be
offered to freshmen or in four-class houses.
No changes will be made to the Draw
process due to this policy change. Instead, stu
dents in the specific locations will have the
option of requesting a roommate of another
gender through the in-house Draw or gradu
ate room assignment process, said Sue Nunan.
director of Housing Assignments. Students of
different genders who do not know each other
will not be placed in the same room.
"In the Draw/Lottery, Title IX require
ments will continue to be met to obtain the
overall balance between male and female stu

dents in each campus housing location,"
Nunan said in a press release.
Plans for implementation of a gender-neu
tral rooming policy have been in the works
since last academic year. In spring 2007.
Shirley Everett, senior associate vice provost
for Residential & Dining Enterprises, and
Greg Boardman. vice provost for Student
Affairs, convened a Gender Neutral Task
Force (GNTF) to explore the possibility of
offering gender-neutral housing options to
upperclassmen and graduate students at
Stanford.
Nunan — along with Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student Housing, and
Nate Boswell, associate director of
Residential Education —chaired the commit
tee. Several ASSU representatives also served
on the committee.
Prior to implementing the policy. Student
Housing tested students' potential responses
to the policy via the Student Housing annual
survey.
"The survey had results along the lines of
what we expected," said Kass. "A good per
centage of undergraduates were interested in
it, and most people were perfectly fine with it
even if they wouldn't pursue it themselves."
The survey results also showed that gradu
ate students were slightly more interested in
gender-neutral housing options than under
graduates.
The LGBT community has been one of the
most vocal advocates for gender-neutral hous
ing. Transgender students can use the internal
house Draw process, or they can apply to the

house through a confidential process.
"This program is not only for the LGBT
students," Kass said. "Of course, the LGBT
stand to benefit a lot from it. but really the
program is for anyone who feels more com
fortable rooming with someone from a differ
ent gender."
Some opponents to gender-neutral hous
ing programs argue that such policies pro
mote promiscuity, also pointing out that cou
ples who decide to live together may break
up. Others counter that if students decide to
engage in such behavior, they will be do so
regardless of whether gender-neutral hous
ing is offered or not.
"Also, at most universities across the
country, students have the option of moving
off-campus if they want to live with someone
of the opposite sex," said Luukas lives '09,
undergraduate senator and Undergraduate
Housing Advisory Committee member. "But
due to the nature of housing in Palo Alto,
that's not an option open to Stanford stu
dents."
"We're adults," lives added. "I think the
University should have some trust in stu
dents to make their own informed and
rational choices with regards to their living

situations.
The success of this pilot program will
determine the viability of future gender-neu
tral housing at Stanford. If results are posi
tive, Student Housing may expand the pro
gram for 2009 and 2010.
The gender-neutral pilot program will not
be the only change to impact student housing
for the 2008-2009 school year. Xanadu will be
closed for renovation through the Capital
Improvement Program in the fall. Freshmen
will no longer live in Trancos, and the resi
dence will house approximately 20 transfer
students. Rooms on the construction side of
Casa Zapata will revert to one-room doubles
in the fall, and those on the construction side
of Serra will revert to one-room doubles in
the winter.
Castano and Lantana will no longer be
priority residences. Kimball Hall is working
toward establishing itself as an Arts
Academic Theme House in 2009-2010 and
will participate in a 2008-2009 pilot program.
Faculty members can select up to 12
Academic Theme Associates in addition to
Focus Assistants.

Casa Zapata will revert to one-room doubles
in the fall, and those on the construction side
of Serra will revert to one-room doubles in
the winter.
Castano and Lantana will no longer be
priority residences. Kimball Hall is working
toward establishing itself as an Arts
Academic Theme House in 2009-2010 and
will participate in a 2008-2009 pilot program.
Faculty members can select up to 12
Academic Theme Associates in addition to
Focus Assistants.
