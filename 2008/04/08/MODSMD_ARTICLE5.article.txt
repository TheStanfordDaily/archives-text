## Looking back on the outgoing Senate Three ASSU senators seek re-election for new term 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduate senators do not
typically stick around. Not a single
member of the Ninth Undergraduate
Senate was a member of the Eighth
Undergraduate Senate. But this year,
three current senators, Stuart Baimel
'09, Patrick Cordova '09 and Luukas
lives '09. are seeking re-election.
ITiis may be a reaction to what sev
eral senators have cited as a major
problem for the Senate — a lack of
continuity.
"One of the greatest problems

[with the ASSU] is a lack of institu
tional memory," Baimel said.
"Senators come in and it takes them
three or four months to learn how to
do things, and they are only really
effective four or five months."
"The Senate term is one year, and
administrators are not on that one
year schedule," added Senator
Jonathan Kass '10, who is instead run
ning for Junior Class President this
year. "Returning senators is a very
good idea. These particular senators
will he able to work on projects that
first-time senators would not he able
to work on, like reforming appropria
tion policies."

details of ASSU rules and policies in a

second term.
"I'm running for re-election so I
can work on relatively un-sexy
issues," lives said, "like how the
bylaws and constitution work and
how we exercise oversight over
particular processes like nomina
tion committee appointments."
lives, along with the other sena
tors seeking re-election, argued
that executing these types of spe
cialized ASSU reforms would only
be possible for a second-term sena
tor.
"The things you focus on as a
returning senator are very different
from what you do as a first-term
senator," lives said.
Baimel plans a different focus
for his second term.
"I want to focus on advocacy proj
ects," Baimel said. "For example,
the price of birth control has gone
up, and an important aspect of
being senator is advocating for stu
dents to administrators, and that's
an issue the ASSU should take up."
According to Cordova, one year
just is not enough to fully deliver
on an ambitious campaign plat
form. Cordova said that as his
Senate term progressed, he stum
bled upon even more things that
needed to be done to further his
agenda of promoting sexual and
mental health across campus.
"I would argue that I need 10
more years in the Senate to do
everything," Cordova said. "Being
a student takes a lot of time, and
there are certain things 1 couldn't
accomplish. As a naive incoming
senator, I told myself I would
change Stanford, but it's a complex
place."
"The returning senators will
work on a lot of things that, if we
don't do them, won't get done,"
lives added. "And of course, we had
fun (in this year's Senate]. We work
for students. We help students out."
