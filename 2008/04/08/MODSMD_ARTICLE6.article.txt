### 
Senator Stuart Baimel '09, who is seeking re-election,
may be hoping for the incumbency advantage that
the US. Congress is famous for â€” he is running his
ASSIJ campaign from Washington, D C., and will miss
the first five weeks that the Tenth Undergraduate Senate
is in office.
Baimel has been at Stanford in Washington since
spring break and physically absent from Ninth
Undergraduate Senate meetings as a result. But the sen
ator is confident that he can run an effective campaign
and fulfill his spring quarter Senate duties from
Washington.
"I don't see any problems," Baimel said. " ITierc are
some things 1 won't be able to do from abroad, but I will
be able to participate in all senate meetings."
