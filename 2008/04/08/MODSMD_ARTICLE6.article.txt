# A 						Campaign from the Capital
## 
### 
Senator Stuart Baimel '09, who is seeking re-election,
may be hoping for the incumbency advantage that
the US. Congress is famous for — he is running his
ASSIJ campaign from Washington, D C., and will miss
the first five weeks that the Tenth Undergraduate Senate
is in office.
Baimel has been at Stanford in Washington since
spring break and physically absent from Ninth
Undergraduate Senate meetings as a result. But the sen
ator is confident that he can run an effective campaign
and fulfill his spring quarter Senate duties from
Washington.
"I don't see any problems," Baimel said. " ITierc are
some things 1 won't be able to do from abroad, but I will
be able to participate in all senate meetings."
Baimel's absence is not without prece
dent. Current senator Vang Kou Khang
'08 also spent time abroad during his
term.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 was sup
portive of Baimel, pointing to his track
record in the Ninth Senate.
"I think that Stuart is very productive
and responsible, and will give his full
effort to Senate proceedings, even if he
has to participate via Skype," Cordova
said.
Baimel pointed out that the five
weeks he will miss will fall during the
time when most of the senators —at
least 12 of the 15 will be new to the
Senate — are still learning the ropes.
"There are some things that I can't do
in the final five weeks [of spring quarter],
but, to be honest, some of the issues I'm
interested in don't require me to be
there," Baimel said. "That's a time when
first-term senators have to figure out
what to do."
