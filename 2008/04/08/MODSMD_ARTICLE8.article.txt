# STUDENT GOV'T
## Campaigns target Old Union 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Old Union reform has become a hot-button topic in this
year's ASSU campaigns.
A popular Facebook group called "Put the Student Back
in Student Union" boasts a list of those running for office
who support making the Old Union a more social venue. In
creating the group. Kevin Webb "09 and Zachary Warma '11
hoped to push reform of the Old Union to the forefront of
the elections.
"My focus has shiftedWebb said. "When I started this
group. I wanted the Old Union to be lively. But as I've
worked on it. I've realized that that doesn't create a sense of
a student union. What creates a student union is a feeling of
transparency. There isn't a lot of sense of ownership."
Webb also created a Web site, studentunionnow.
blogspot.com. on which candidates have expressed their
ideas for student union reform. He asked them what they
envisioned as the ideal student union, what they would imme
diately do. what long-term goals they have and how they
would get students involved.
A number of candidates for the elections have highlighted
Old Union reform in their campaigns, including the executive
slate of Phillip I lon '10 and Sagar Doshi '09.
"We're going to work with groups to ensure that the Old
Union is being used for their group activities," Doshi said.
"There is already an Old Union programming board, but
right now not too many people realize it is there." he contin
ued. "We want to collect opinions of what people want and
then see. No matter what happens, people are going to make
sure it's a priority next year."
Doshi also emphasized the difference between student
buildings and university buildings.
"This is our union." he said. "This is the student's building."
Another slate, comprised of David Gobaud '08 and Greg
Goldgof '08. instead suggested opening up more student
space in Tresidder.
"Tresidder is still a possibility," Webb said. "But the Old
Union is so new that there's the ability to change it right now.
It's one of the main focuses for going forward so that this very
sterile place doesn't become institutionalized."
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 echoed the emphasis
new candidates are placing on the issue. He said that there is

"implicit pressure" to keep quiet in consideration of those
studying.
"(Old Union was) never intended ... to become another
Lane Reading Room." he said.
Avula said the ASSU has been working to increase recre
ational activities at the Axe and Palm, with efforts like Sushi
Night and student band performances. Currently, there is dis
cussion about holding movie screenings in the Union court
yard.
Webb cited the CoHo. the closing of which students
protested, as a potential model for Old Union renovation.
Like Avula, Webb and Warma have plans for how to make
Old Union more social, such as adding big screen televisions
in the main lobby, pool tables behind the staircase and televi
sions in meeting rooms that students can reserve.
"What are the ties that really bind us as Stanford stu
dents?" Warma said. "It's not just a shirt we wear, but a place
that we can all come together."

A renovated Old Union opened this past fall, but many
students have since complained about the student union's quiet
setting and a lack of a vibrant social scene. ASSU candidates
have proposed ways to work toward Old Union reform.
