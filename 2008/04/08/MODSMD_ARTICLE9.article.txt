## Amendment to ASSU constitution goes into effect Groups applying for joint special fees face more rules 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Student groups applying for special fees
must now receive a majority of votes from
both undergraduates and graduates instead of
a majority of the total voting population, as a
result of a new amendment set to go into effect
this week.
Last spring, the amendment was approved
by students voting in the ASSU elections.
Reacting to the impending policy change, sev
eral student groups, such as the Stanford
News Readership Program, applied for
undergraduate special fees instead of the
joint fees they sought last year.
ASSU Vice President Mondaire Jones '09

said that the Graduate Student Council had
already approved the amendment last
Wednesday in a unanimous vote and was con
fident that it will pass in the Undergraduate
Senate tonight.
"I have every indication that the amend
ment will he approved and will take effect
Tuesday night in time for voting on
Wednesday and Thursday," Jones said.
fie said that the change resulted from the
Graduate Student Council's dissatisfaction
with the special fees process.
"It doesn't make sense for the graduate
student population to have to pay equally for
services that they do not find beneficial." he
said. "Now groups that used to get by on just
undergraduate support will have to change
their approach."
Jones admitted that the change would be
difficult for some undergraduate groups seek
ing joint fees.
"It is going to be harder for student

groups who try to receive joint fees, includ
ing this year, because they have to appeal
more vigorously to the graduate student
population." he said. But Jones said that he
viewed the amendment as positive because it
takes into account the views and preferences
of all those involved.
"Historically, graduate students have not
been on the radar, or, at the very least, equal
attention hasn't been paid to that demo
graphic." he said. "But now their vote is going
to have equal weight, and 1 think that is a
good change."
ASSU Senator Patrick Cordova '09 said
that the amendment could be harmful for
some undergraduate groups.
"It will definitely be harder for student
groups, without a doubt," he said. "At this
point it means that all student groups need to
appeal to a larger audience. And there is cer
tainly some good in that, but some groups
really have more of an effect on and are more

appropriate for undergraduate students."
He also said that there has been a recent
discussion about whether graduate students
who decide not to fund undergraduate groups
should be excluded from undergraduate serv
ices and events sponsored by those groups.
"One example of something like this is
what we do with the Speakers Bureau," he
said. "If you ask for your money back [in the
refund process], your ID number goes on a
list, and you don't get tickets."
Cordova added that the discussion on stu
dent group funding is becoming an increas
ingly heated issue.
"Student groups are beginning to realize
that their ability to function is dependent on
funding," he said. "We are seeing that through
longer and more complicated special fees
elections."
