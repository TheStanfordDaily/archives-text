## Rice plans to return to Farm 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
U.S. State Department Spokesman Sean
McCormack told the press Monday that Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice will not pursue the vice
presidency in November, and will instead return to
Stanford following her term in Washington.
"If she is actively seeking the vice presidency,
then she is the last one to know about it,"
McCormack told the media in a recorded press con
ference. "She plans on going back west of the
Mississippi to Stanford when she's completed her
work as secretary of state."
McCormack noted that Rice is still a member of
Stanford's faculty.
"Keep in mind — she's actually on leave from
Stanford," he said. "She is still a tenured professor at
Stanford University."
Rice, who is a professor of political science and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, has said she
is "not interested" in being Sen. John McCain's
number two, and that it is "time for new blood."
according to McCormack.
Responding to a question on whether Rice
would run for California governor, McCormack said
that for the time being. Rice will concentrate on the
rest of her work in Washington.
"I think what she is considering is focusing on her
work as Secretary of State, because — you may have
missed it — but there's actually quite a bit to do."
