## Students push for sustainable cups Group aims to expand green cup, mug options 
### ALLISON DEDRICK STAFF WRITER 
Red cups at parties might be see
ing numbered days, if Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS) get their
wish. The organization's Zero Waste
group has been researching and pro
moting plastic cup alternatives.
The Zero Waste group has two ini
tiatives targeting cups: promoting
recyclable or compostable alterna
tives to red cups at campus parties and
encouraging students to bring their
own coffee mugs to cafes. Some house
managers have also joined the push
for incorporating greener ordering
options.
"1 view cups as a microcosm of a
bigger sustainability issue." said John
Mulrow '09. a member of Zero Waste.
Playing off of the slogan "Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle," Mulrow started the
group Refuse in September. Refuse
developed a survey about the use of
disposable coffee cups in cafes on
campus and red cup waste at parties,
also investigating alternatives. The
group has since become a project of
SSS.
The recycling symbol on the bot
tom of red cups is misleading because
they are made of polystyrene, which is
an extremely difficult plastic to recy
cle. The Stanford Recycling Center
does not accept red cups so those used
on campus are thrown away.
Mulrow and others have created a
Red Cup Alternatives packet, which
they plan to distribute to the social
chairs of row houses and co-ops. They
also hope to get the ASSU involved in
creating a party registration system
with guidelines that purposefully
include sustainability.
Some houses have taken on the
red cup issue themselves. Kali
Albright "08, house manager at EBF,

now orders corn-based compostable
cups from Eco-Products instead of the
plastic red ones. A compostable cup
costs a few cents more than a red cup
but the real hurdle has been the ship
ping costs. The company eliminates
shipping fees only on orders over
$ IXXX). which is more than one house
needs.
"I ordered 2,(XX) cups the first time
and just sucked it up and paid the
shipping because I wanted to see how
the cups would work out," Albright
said. "They worked really well — peo
ple put the cups in the compost — so
in January 1 did a group order with
other houses too. which was big
enough that we didn't have to pay
shipping costs."
She said they bought 11.(XX) cups
for approximately $1(XX).
EBF now uses only the com
postable cups at its social and in
house events. Albright is a member of
the Green Living Council, a group of
student representatives promoting
sustainability in residences. She said
the network has been helpful in get
ting sustainability ideas from other
houses.
Ibe Zero Waste group is also tar
geting cup waste at cafes. They have
produced a flyer outlining the amount
of monthly waste due to disposable
coffee cups and plan to post it at all
campus cafes, encouraging students to
bring their own reusable mug.
Mulrow said that he has yet to
encounter a place on campus that will
not let people bring their own mug,
though he has heard of the practice
being prohibited elsewhere. A self
described "religious bring-your-own
er," he even brings his own plate to
The Treehouse.
Mulrow said upcoming project
developments include red cup alter
natives at Sigma Nu's annual
Sunsplash party and posted flyers in
campus cafes to promote awareness.
