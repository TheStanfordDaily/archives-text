## Editorial Board Special fees burden distorted by measure A 
### 
Last year's measure A — not to be con
fused with this year's measure about a
GO-pass initiative — was passed with
eighty-seven percent of the vote. Now the
student body must live with its conse
quences. This measure, which was only re
cently ratified, changes the structure of joint
special fees and means that the undergradu
ate population will be shouldering even
more of the tax burden associated with pay
ing those fees.
Unlike in previous elections where earn
ing a majority of the total vote and at least
fifteen percent of each electorate was
enough to guarantee passage, special fees
groups now have to earn at least fifty per
cent of both the graduate and undergradu
ate population. Since far fewer graduate stu
dents vote, this gives each graduate student
vote more weight.
Between 2004 and 2(X)7, had measure A
been in effect, the following groups would
have failed to get joint special fees despite
earning an overall majority of voters sup
port: Stanford Club Sports, Stanford News
Readership. The Stanford Daily and ASSU
Sunday Flicks.
More importantly, this measure changes
the way groups approach special fees.
Groups don't undertake the process of get
ting special fees lightly. Special fees are often
the main source of funding for a group and
are always a vital part of a group's budget. If
a group applies for joint special fees and
loses, it can be damaging. Recognizing this,
Stanford Club Sports for the past few years
has split into asking for joint special fees and
undergraduate special fees separately. In
2005, Club Sports failed to get the grad stu
dent vote and lost a significant part of its
budget.
This year, as a result of measure A, it is
harder to pass joint special fees. The Stan
ford Daily and The Stanford News Reader
ship Program, which have traditionally ap
plied as joint special-fees groups, have
switched to applying as undergraduate spe
cial-fee groups only. Ihese groups are still
asking for their full budgets — but from
only the undergraduate population. ITiis
means a higher tax on the undergraduates.
The question that we must ask ourselves
is, do these groups really only apply to un
dergraduates or do they serve the whole stu
dent body? This conundrum did not begin
with measure A. Other groups that are un
dergraduate-only in funding are SCBN-TV.
Stanford AXE Committee, LSJUMB-Stan

ford Band and Stanford Concert Network. It
could be argued that all of these serve the
larger Stanford community. Yet the under
graduate population is the only group fund
ing these organizations.
It is entirely understandable that gradu
ate students have bigger worries than fund
ing the various groups on campus. It is rea
sonable to consider health care for depend
ents and low cost housing more important
than LSJUMB or The Daily. However.many
grad students actively participate in these
groups or enjoy their services. Why should
undergraduates be the only ones paying for
them?
It is challenging to propose a solution for
this problem. One of the great things about
Stanford is that graduate students and un
dergrads work side-by-side in groups and
enjoy many of the same services. Some
groups, like The Band or The Daily, couldn't
control access to their services, even if they
wanted to (which they currently don't).
Yet, undergraduates must demand more.
Otherwise,they will find themselves funding
a still more disproportionate amount of
groups that serve both classes of Stanford
students. Maybe the entire structure of spe
cial fees needs to be reexamined. Maybe the
Undergraduate Senate needs to add consti
tutional amendments affording undergrad
uates protection from over-taxation. At last
resort, only if this situation can't be resolved
another way, these groups may consider
denying services to grad students or charg
ing a fee for grad members/users, thereby ei
ther forcing grad students to vote for groups
during election or raise money in other ways.
These measures, although assuredly drastic,
would reduce the burden on the undergrad
population.
When considering alternatives, it should
be noted that no solution should make it
even harder for the well-intentioned groups
that serve the student body to get funding.
Special fees money is critical to many groups'
survival. Don't blame the groups for having
to ask for money from certain populations.
No group can afford to fail special fees.
The consequences of last year's measure
A are only beginning to be felt by the under
graduate population. However, it is part of a
larger pattern of undergraduates paying for
a disproportionate amount of student
groups. This situation will not change until
undergrads insist that the Undergraduate
Senate fight to make the grad students share
their part of the bill.
