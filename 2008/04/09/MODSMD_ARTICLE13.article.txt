# You're Not Special
## Words on paper 
### 
I had a terrible time thinking of something
to write about this week, but then I
opened The Daily and read that the Uni
versity has finally green-lighted a gender
neutral housing program. It surprised me
the gender-neutral campaign went on for
five years. It's hard for me to imagine anyone
expending that much time and effort to ac
quire the ability to live with someone of the
opposite or unspecified gender.
But it's kind of a cool idea — it doesn't
really hurt anyone, and I'm sure that there
will be those who gain from this. I applaud
the efforts of these organizers. If more peo
ple spent time campaigning for costless, mar
ginally useful things like low-flow shower
heads or gender-neutral housing, it would do
the University a lot of good. So in honor of
this quixotic program, this column is about
the little issues and annoyances of Stanford
life.
Managing Room and Hoard Costs
I propose charging different rates for dif
ferent rooms in the same house. I've lived in
both Synergy's one-room quad and in one of
its singles. The two rooms offered tremen
dously different living experiences, both in
terms of privacy and square-footage per per
son. Why was my rooming bill the same for
both?
Not only would it be more fair to charge
more for better rooms, it would also benefit
poorer students. It sounds terrible to say it.
but if an extra few hundred dollars is so im
portant for your budget that you're willing
to live in a smaller room or take more room
mates, maybe you should have the option of
saving that money.
As it is, I'm sure many students choose
not to live in Row Houses because they cost
roughly $ 1 ,(KK) more per year. Let's just ex
tend this decision-making process into the
in-house draw. Someone's going to have to
live in these rooms. They might as well be
compensated for it.
Similarly, students in dining halls should

he allowed to opt out of their meal plans.
Iliese plans cost $4,982 this year for 234 days
of dining. That comes out to about $21 a day.
I consume tremendous quantities of food,
but even I could manage to support myself
on $21 a day and probably end up eating a
lot better.
ASSU Recommendations
Speaking of minor issues, every year I get
a delicious thrill out of voting against special
fees requests during ASSU elections. 1 do
show some mercy. I mostly keep all the pub
lications because I need something to read
in the bathroom. And the arts groups be
cause I never know when I will want to
watch some Mariachis. I also keep the Stan
ford Solar Car Project because it's just awe
some and the Queer/Straight Alliance be
cause they throw decent parties on a very
tiny budget.
Iben I vote for the ASSU senators who
have the funniest names. Waddie Crazy
horse will always have my vote for as long as
he continues to run.
And finally, the most difficult decision of
all. I carefully weigh each executive slate's
experience, accomplishments, race, gender,
sexual orientation, year and degree status.
Then I vote for whoever has eaten a live
snake.

Rahul Kanakia doesn tsee what the big deal is
with gender-blind housing. He lives in one
room with three women. Contact him at
