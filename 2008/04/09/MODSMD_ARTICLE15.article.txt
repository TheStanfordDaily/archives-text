# Co-Terminal Illness
## Expansion outreach begins 
### 
After months of behind-the-scenes
work, President Hennessy's task
force on freshman expansion is final
ly starting to move outside the meeting room.
By planning to release its recommenda
tion at the same time as its specific findings,
however, the task force would deny students
the opportunity to voice their opinions on ex
pansion in light of the important new infor
mation the report will contain. Details about
the most likely form this expansion would
take, including crucial areas like housing,
study abroad programs and availability of
campus resources, won't be available for the
public until the report is released, which is ex
pected to be some time this fall.
According to University Trustee and task
force co-chairman Jim Canales, the commit
tee will solicit student, faculty and alumni
opinion this quarter. The University plans to
launch a public Web site to collect feedback
on the expansion proposal, and the first town
hall forum was held last Saturday to gain the
input of a group of prominent alumni volun
teers.
"We hope to have solicited opinions and
suggestions from these groups by the end of
spring," said task force Co-Chairman and
English Prof. Ramon Saldivar.
The Web site will include the written
"charge" issued by President Hennessy to
the task force, which has not been made pub
lic yet.The task force hopes to release its pre
liminary findings next fall, although "prelim
inary" may be a misleading word, because the
report will also include a recommendation
on whether or not to proceed with expan
sion.
"The charge is fairly clear: that [President
Hennessy] would like us to come back with a
recommendation," said Canales '88, M.A.
'89.
According to Canales and Saldivar, the
reason that the University has not released
more details about the possible expansion,
such as how large it would be, how much it
would cost and whether it would require new
construction, is that no one has answers to
those questions yet.
"I don't think the intention is, 'This is the
design, let's hear how people react to it,'"

Canales said. "We're hoping to have a com
munity-wide discussion."
The University's public stance is that
nothing has been pre-determined. According
to people who attended his talk on Parents'
Weekend, however. President Hennessy said
that the most likely number for a possible ex
pansion would be around 10 percent to 12
percent.
During the outreach process, Canales says
that leaving such questions open-ended will
make it easier to solicit people's unbiased re
actions. He recalled having dinner with a
group of students who expressed their reser
vations about everything from overstuffed
dorms, the shortage of community spaces
and the potential loss of the campus's inti
mate look and feel.
Without any more details from the task
force, students who support expansion will
essentially be writing a blank check to the ad
ministration to carry out expansion however
it pleases, while students who don't support
expansion may be doing so for the wrong rea
sons, such as out of fear that Stanford will
lose its "prestige."
Let me be clear: 1 don't think there's a
conspiracy to withhold information. Howev
er, the task force should try to structure the
discussion by releasing some of their findings
before issuing a recommendation on whether
or not to expand.
To give only one example, I think it's un
wise to make any decisions before saying,
publicly, where the added students might
live. It would be all-too-easy for the Univer
sity to simply slap down another low-cost,
high-occupancy eyesore like the Manzanita
dorms.
What's more.it makes the University look
bad to leave the housing question "open" at a
time when some students have been living in

windowless study rooms in the basement of
Crothers. For many, the campus is starting to
feel like a permanent construction zone and
we want to know that the outcome will re
flect a harmonious vision, of the sort that is
clearly lacking when the current housing sys
tem was planned.
As of now, Canales and Saldivar insist that
the primary motive for expansion has to do
with the University's core mission.
"There are probably a number of practi
cal reasons that Stanford might consider ex
panding the undergraduate college," Sal
divar said. "However, the moral argument,
that it is our responsibility to educate more
students, should be taken very seriously."
Both Canales and Saldivar were gracious
enough to let me interview them face-to
face, and both seemed particularly sincere on
this point. But instead of tools for social
benevolence, I think of universities like Stan
ford as large, complex bureaucracies that en
compass a variety of different goals â€” some
of them self-interested,some not. It's not that
the moral argument isn't valid, it just doesn't
really move the discussion anywhere.
In many ways, expansion has been the
theme of President Hennessy's tenure, which
is now nearing its eighth year. Under his lead
ership, the University has constructed many
new buildings, with plans for more, and
pumped up the endowment. He has promot
ed Stanford as a global university, with ties to
students and campuses all over the world.
I would like to see President Hennessy ar
ticulate his vision for the University's future,
and how, exactly, undergraduate expansion
fits into it.
Kudos to the University for starting its
outreach process and for trying to get more
students involved through on-line forums.
Now, it would be great if at some point the
task force would give us more specifics be
fore issuing its verdict, preliminary or other
wise.

Brendan Selhy is neither for nor against Hen
nessy's proposal, but he thinks students should
he able to comment on more than just an ab
stract idea of expansion. Email him your
thoughts at bselb@stanford.edu.
