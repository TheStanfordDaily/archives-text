SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Olympic torch's
round-the-world trip is the longest in Olympic history
and is meant to highlight China's rising economic and
political power. But on its sole North American stop,
activists are also calling attention to the Olympic host's
human rights record.
As runners carry the torch on its six-mile route
Wednesday they will compete not only with people
protesting China's grip on Tibet and its support for the

Local officials say they support the diversity of view

protests during the torch's stops in London and Paris
and a demonstration Monday in which activists hung
banners from the Golden Gate bridge.

to protect the right to free speech and the other is to

ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are
good at both of those things," said Nathan Ballard, a
spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom.
The torch is scheduled to travel a route hugging San
Francisco Bay, but security concerns could prompt a
last-minute change. Already, one runner who planned
to carry the torch dropped out because of safety con
cerns, officials said.
The flame was whisked to a secret location shortly
after its pre-dawn arrival in San Francisco on I\iesday.
It began its 85,000-mile journey from Ancient Olympia
in Greece to Beijing on March 24, and was the focus of
protests from the start.
On Tuesday, hundreds of activists carrying Tibetan
flags gathered in United Nations Plaza, a pedestrian
area near City Hall, to denounce China's policy toward
Tibet and the recent crackdown on protesters there.
They then marched to the Chinese Consulate.
"This is not about us battling the torchbearers,"
Lhadom Tethong, executive director of Students for a
Free Tibet, told the crowd outside the consulate. "This
