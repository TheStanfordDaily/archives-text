## Security high for torch's S.F. stop

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Olympic torch's
round-the-world trip is the longest in Olympic history
and is meant to highlight China's rising economic and
political power. But on its sole North American stop,
activists are also calling attention to the Olympic host's
human rights record.
As runners carry the torch on its six-mile route
Wednesday they will compete not only with people
protesting China's grip on Tibet and its support for the
governments of Myanmar and Sudan, but also with
more obscure activists. They include nudists calling for
a return to the way the ancient Greek games were
played.
Local officials say they support the diversity of view
points, but have heightened security following chaotic
protests during the torch's stops in London and Paris
and a demonstration Monday in which activists hung
banners from the Golden Gate bridge.
"We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is
to protect the right to free speech and the other is to

ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are
good at both of those things," said Nathan Ballard, a
spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom.
The torch is scheduled to travel a route hugging San
Francisco Bay, but security concerns could prompt a
last-minute change. Already, one runner who planned
to carry the torch dropped out because of safety con
cerns, officials said.
The flame was whisked to a secret location shortly
after its pre-dawn arrival in San Francisco on I\iesday.
It began its 85,000-mile journey from Ancient Olympia
in Greece to Beijing on March 24, and was the focus of
protests from the start.
On Tuesday, hundreds of activists carrying Tibetan
flags gathered in United Nations Plaza, a pedestrian
area near City Hall, to denounce China's policy toward
Tibet and the recent crackdown on protesters there.
They then marched to the Chinese Consulate.
"This is not about us battling the torchbearers,"
Lhadom Tethong, executive director of Students for a
Free Tibet, told the crowd outside the consulate. "This
is about the Chinese government
using the torch for political purpos
es. And we're going to use it right
back."
The day of protests culminated in
an evening candlelight vigil for Tibet,
with speeches by actor Richard Gere
and human rights activist Desmond
Tutu, who called on President Bush
and other heads of state to boycott
the opening ceremonies in Beijing.
San Francisco was chosen to host
the relay in part because of its large
Chinese-American population.
Many residents spoke out TUesday to
ask for calm and express their pride
that China was chosen to host the
summer games.
"We are begging for five hours of
peace," said Sam Ng, president of the
Chinese Six Companies, a prominent
benevolent association.
Ling Li, 29, who immigrated from

China's Guangdong Province eight
years ago, said she was disappointed
that this pivotal moment in her coun
try's history was being marred by
demonstrations. She said Tibet is a
rightful part of China and its quest
for independence should not be part
of the Olympics.
"If I support the Olympics, of
course I don't support the protests.
This is the first time China has had
the Olympics. We should be proud of
this," she said.
In Beijing, International Olympic
Committee President Jacques Rogge
said the body's executive board
would discuss Friday whether to end
the international leg of the torch
relay because of the demonstrations.
He said he was "deeply saddened"
by the previous protests and was
concerned about the relay in San
Francisco.
"We recognize the right for peo
ple to protest and express their
views, but it sjiould be nonviolent.
We are very sad for all the athletes
and the people who expected so
much from the run and have been

spoiled of their joy," Rogge said.
Pro-Tibet activists and other
human rights groups said they had
encouraged their supporters to
protest peacefully.
"We can be effective without (dis
ruption)," said Allyn Brooks-LaSure,
a spokesman for Save Darfur.
"Disrupting tomorrow's ceremonies
couldn't possibly embarrass Beijing
any more than their disastrous
Darfur policy already has."
Still, law enforcement agencies
prepared for the worst. The Fire
Department will have ambulances
along the torch's route, the San
Francisco Sheriffs Department will
have 50 or more extra deputies on
patrol, and vans will be available to
haul away arrested protesters.
The FAA has restricted flights
over the city to media helicopters,
medical emergency carriers and law
enforcement helicopters and air
planes, such as those the California
Highway Patrol will use to monitor
the torch's route. The CHP has also
increased the number of officers on
the ground.
