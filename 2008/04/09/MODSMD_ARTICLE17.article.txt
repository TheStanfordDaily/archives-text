## MOVING ON? Injuries force Nesland out of the pool, but she won't leave the game behind 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As anyone who has ever played competitive team
sports can tell you. there is almost nothing worse than
missing a game due to injury. The feelings of helpless
ness and uselessness as you watch your team fight with
out you.The sadness of not being able to play the game
you love and that you've worked so hard at. And. of
course, the eagerness to rejoin the team and start play
ing again as soon as possible.
But what if that last feeling wasn't even an option —
what if you found that an injury had actually ended your
career? Would that feeling of helplessness be perma
nent?
Luckily, no. At least, not for Megan Nesland.
Nesland. a senior, is volunteering as an assistant
coach with the women's water polo team this season,
two years after her Cardinal playing career ended due
to joint problems.
"1 have very loose joints that pop in and out of place,"
said Nesland. "When I move, the tendons near those
joints shred and eventually tear."
This resulted in a torn rotator cuff in high school, but
Nesland still continued to play with the injury through
her sophomore season on the Farm. And not just play,
but play well.
"She's had chronic injuries since high school, but
when she was able to play here she was one of our best
defenders, especially in five-on-six," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner." 1 think that's a big part of our being
among the best five-on-six teams in the country."
However, Nesland felt that it was too painful to con
tinue playing with the torn rotator cuff. After try ing
physical therapy, prescription pain medications and cor
tisone shots, she decided to have surgery after her soph
omore year. The surgery would not only fix her rotator
cuff, but also shorten the other tendons in her shoulder,
making the joint tighter. She then tore her ACL about a
month before the shoulder surgery, so she ended up
having knee surgery that summer as well. Unfortunate

ly, the year-long recovery' was not successful.
"In the course of physical therapy I shredded more
ligaments and tendons in my shoulder and the joint was
just as loose before the surgery "said Nesland. "Then, at
the end of the year. I re-tore my ACL as well."
While further surgery was an option, Nesland be
lieved that the results would he the same, so she opted
against it. However, that also meant that she was ending
her water polo career.
"Now, when 1 play water polo ... 1 am in a lot of pain
[and] 1 lose circulation in my hands because of how my
joints move," said Nesland. "It isn't as bad when I swim,
but when 1 make any explosive movements, like throw
ing a ball or lunging out of the water, my joints slip."
She tried to play through the pain with her club team
this past summer, but realized that it just wasn't worth it.
She could not walk away from the Stanford team
though.
"1 knew I wanted to still be around the team, but 1
didn't know what type of role I could play without being
able to be in the game," she said. "So 1 called JT [coach
Tanner] and told him about what I was thinking. It was
[his] idea that 1 volunteer as a coach and 1 loved it."
Now. Nesland is with the team for all practices, meet
ings, and games. During practices, she does all the little
things: running shot clocks, videotape, and helping with
drills. During games, her role is primarily motivation. As
she puts it, "basically 1 can yell very loudly and am not
shy about doing it."
She is also doing all of the conditioning with the team
— including weights and swim sets — and does her own
conditioning when the team isn't doing any. She credits
assistant coach Susan Ortwein with developing a great
training routine for her — one that is easier on the
joints, but still difficult.
"She puts 110 percent into every thing she does and
water polo is no exception," said fellow senior Jackie
Gauthier. "Not only does she workout everyday and
stay engaged with our team, but she is a true motivation.
We see how hard she works and what she puts in, despite
not being able to play.
"She is very much a part of the core of our team and we
try to never lose sight of how lucky we are to have her," she
continued."! love Nesland!"
