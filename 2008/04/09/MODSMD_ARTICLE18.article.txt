# WRESTLING
## Card seniors reflect and look forward 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
As most of Stanford's student body was dispersing for
Spring Break, five Cardinal wrestlers were making their way
to St. Louis, Mo. for the NCAA Championships. And for Stan
ford's pair of standout seniors. Tanner Gardner and Josh Zu
pancic.it was the last such trip they would have the opportuni
ty to make in their collegiate careers.

For both Gardner, wrestling at 125 pounds, and Zupancic,
at 157 pounds, the tournament was to be their last in a Stanford
singlet. And after all the pair had done to draw attention to a
burgeoning program in the Pac-10, it was fitting that they each
earned yet another All-American honor with their highest fin
ishes yet on the national level to cap a pair of stellar careers on
the Farm.
For Gardner, the finish was bittersweet. The Berryton,
Kans. native who set new records for career victories and sin
gle season pins for Stanford wrestlers this season had his
sights set on a national title as early as last year, but fell short
in his trips to the NCAA tournament. Still,with his fifth place
finish, the highest of his career, Gardner became the first
Stanford wrestler ever to earn All-American honors three
times and deemed at peace with the conclusion of his
wrestling cajfber for the Cardinal.
"You know.it was good and bad." Gardner said."l definite
ly wanted to win the national title, but I really don't have any

regrets. I went to nationals and wrestled the best 1 could, but it
just wasn't meant to be that week. I think the top six guys were
all capable of winning it. I think if you wrestled the tourna
ment [again] this weekend 1 could win it and the other five
guys could as well."
Zupancic meanwhile, finished sixth nationally, becoming
just the fifth wrestler in program history this year to reach 100
career victories and only the third to earn two or more All-
American finishes. With two of the conference's four total All-
Americans in its lineup, the Cardinal finished the NCAA tour
nament with the highest finish in the Pac-10 at 19th overall.
Zupancic, too, sounded content with the way his time as a
Cardinal wrestler came to a close.
"[The tournament] was a lot like last year — I guess that's
a good thing, though," Zupancic said.
"I felt like I went as far as I could," he continued."! got kind
of worn out. towards semis feeling
kind of sore and stuff, but that's just
wrestling. I went as far as I could go."
While the Cardinal's other three
wrestlers to make the trip and com
pete in St. Louis did not finish as
highly as their senior comrades, jun
ior Luke Feist at 174 pounds, sopho
more Zack Giesen at 184 pounds,
and redshirt freshman Lucas Esper
icueta at 149 pounds are a big part of
the air of optimism that surrounds
the program's future. But also at the
roots of the hope for the future of
Stanford wrestling are the recent
performances of its athletes, which
have served to greatly improve the
program's profile on the national
scene.
"I know that when myself and
Josh Zupancic and [fellow senior]
Phil Doerner came in here our
freshman year, we all had a strong
commitment to really improving the
program and putting it on the right
path," Gardner said. "I think it's safe
to say that the program's made leaps
and bounds since that year and
that's a combination of our success
as well as coach Steve Buddie and
coach Kerry McCoy and all the as
sistant coaches and other guys that
were here as well. So I feel like the
program's headed in the right direc
tion, absolutely."
Head coach Kerry McCoy also
expressed an unsurprisingly positive
view of his team's future.
"We had an incredible year,"
McCoy told GoStanford.com. "A lot
of records were broken, a lot of stan
dards were raised and we're very
happy about that. Although there
was some disappointment, when you
step back and look at what we ac
complished — two AU-Americans,

finishing second at Pac- 10s, nine con
ference placers, 13 dual wins, five
NCAA qualifiers, a top-20 NCAA
finish — it's all pretty good.
We have a lot of good, young
guys coming back, as well as three
NCAA qualifiers, which gives us a
great mixture of experience and
youth. We look forward to having a
good summer and will pick up
where we left off."
But for Gardner and Zupancic,

their future paths in the sport will, in
all likelihood,carry them away from
Stanford. While Zupancic plans to
return home to Akron, Ohio and
help coach his old high school team
while attending graduate school,
Gardner's plans may yet lead him
back to the mats.
"[My plans are] still up in the
air," he said. "For the Olympics in
Beijing this year, US. Nationals are
coming up in a few weeks and I'm

still undecided if I'm going to wres
tle in that. I could [also] see myself
coming back in 2012, but I'm going
to take a little break from it for a
while and see where it goes from
there."
"I think definitely [I'll always re
member] the team aspect of
[wrestling at Stanford]," Gardner
went on. "This year is, I think, the
best year of my five years here.
Everybody really is a strong com

petitor, and we all united behind a
common goal, and we broke barri
ers. We did things that no other Stan
ford team has ever done. 1 think I'm
going to remember the guys that I
competed with and the coaches that
helped me out so much."
it's likely that the program will re
member Gardner and Zupancic, too.
