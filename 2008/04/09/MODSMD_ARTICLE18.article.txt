# WRESTLING
## Card seniors reflect and look forward 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
As most of Stanford's student body was dispersing for
Spring Break, five Cardinal wrestlers were making their way
to St. Louis, Mo. for the NCAA Championships. And for Stan
ford's pair of standout seniors. Tanner Gardner and Josh Zu
pancic.it was the last such trip they would have the opportuni
ty to make in their collegiate careers.

For both Gardner, wrestling at 125 pounds, and Zupancic,
at 157 pounds, the tournament was to be their last in a Stanford
singlet. And after all the pair had done to draw attention to a
burgeoning program in the Pac-10, it was fitting that they each
earned yet another All-American honor with their highest fin
ishes yet on the national level to cap a pair of stellar careers on
the Farm.
For Gardner, the finish was bittersweet. The Berryton,
Kans. native who set new records for career victories and sin
gle season pins for Stanford wrestlers this season had his
sights set on a national title as early as last year, but fell short
in his trips to the NCAA tournament. Still,with his fifth place
finish, the highest of his career, Gardner became the first
Stanford wrestler ever to earn All-American honors three
times and deemed at peace with the conclusion of his
wrestling cajfber for the Cardinal.
"You know.it was good and bad." Gardner said."l definite
ly wanted to win the national title, but I really don't have any

regrets. I went to nationals and wrestled the best 1 could, but it
just wasn't meant to be that week. I think the top six guys were
all capable of winning it. I think if you wrestled the tourna
ment [again] this weekend 1 could win it and the other five
guys could as well."
Zupancic meanwhile, finished sixth nationally, becoming
just the fifth wrestler in program history this year to reach 100
career victories and only the third to earn two or more All-
American finishes. With two of the conference's four total All-
Americans in its lineup, the Cardinal finished the NCAA tour
nament with the highest finish in the Pac-10 at 19th overall.
Zupancic, too, sounded content with the way his time as a
Cardinal wrestler came to a close.
"[The tournament] was a lot like last year â€” I guess that's
a good thing, though," Zupancic said.
"I felt like I went as far as I could," he continued."! got kind
