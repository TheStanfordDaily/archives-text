# Gymnasts balance schedules too
## 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford student athletes live busy lives.
Balancing classes and athletics is tough
enough when you're only playing for one
team. When you're competing for two teams at

the same time, busy doesn't go far enough. Ask
Sho Nakamori or David Sender of the Stan
ford Men's Gymnastics team. The duo not
only compete for Stanford, they are members
of the USA Senior National Team.
"This year has been really busy juggling
two seasons at once," said Sho, a redshirt jun

ior. "We've already had three international
meets this year," including a trip halfway
around the world to compete at the World Cup
in Qatar.
Surprisingly, this year Sender, a senior, ac
tually feels better physically.
"My body is more rested, but mentally it

has been tough going between teams," he said.
"I competed a lot more for Stanford last year
because we had a lot of injuries to key guys."
Sender, an Illinois native, was an Olympic
Trials competitor and two-time U.S. champion
on vault by the time he arrived on the Farm in
2(X)4. As a freshman, he reached the finals at
the NCAA Championships in parallel bars
and was selected to the U.S. Senior National
team after a great performance at the 2005
U.S. Nationals.
But Sender really broke out at the 2006
NCAA championship meet as a sophomore.
He reached the finals in three events — in
cluding a national title on vault — and fin
ished fifth in the all-around. Sender won the
NCAA vault title again and finished fourth in
the all-around in 2007 to establish himself as
one of the top gymnasts in the nation.
"I don't really think much of vault as an
event — I always thought it wasn't very hard,"
said Sender, laughing. "I guess it just turned
out that I was good at it."
More than just the judges have seen how
good Dave is on vault: after placing fourth in
the event at the World Cup, USA Gymnastics
took notice as well.
"They told me they were impressed at
Qatar. It was a really tough field of competi
tors, so I was very proud of my performance."
But Sender's success in the gym hasn't gone
to his head. In fact, it may have motivated him
further. When asked what he thought about
his performance this year at Stanford and as a
member of Team USA, he was very candid.
"Both my NCAA and international sea
sons have been OK, but not spectacular," he
said. "This year is important obviously be
cause it is an Olympic year, but it is almost as
important with NCAA Championships at
home — and we have a good chance to win."
While he is extremely busy. Sender does
have a friend to share the journey, as
Nakamori is his teammate. Sho has also found
it difficult to compete for two teams at once,
but he cites the depth of the Stanford team as
the reason he doesn't feel too guilty about
leaving for international competitions.
"We're lucky to have a lot of depth, and it

has allowed (Sender and 1] to com
pete internationally. We can put up
any six guys on any event and still
compete with the best teams in the
nation."
Like Sender, Nakamori's success
hasn't affected his attitude. He is as
motivated as ever to win a NCAA
title and to represent his country at
the Beijing Olympics in 2008. He
will need that motivation to over
come a string of injuries that have
nagged him this year.
The latest injury is a herniated
disk in his back. He suffered the set
back at the alumni meet two weeks
ago and had to miss some training
time. Nakamori tried to compete at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) championship meet
last weekend, but was pulled from
the lineup after the first event of the
meet.
"The doctors said we're going to
ramp up the meds and do some
physical therapy," said Nakamori. "I
should be ready to go next week."
Last weekend, Stanford finished
second at the MPSF conference
meet. The No.l ranked Cardinal did
not perform well, and they know it.
But head coach Thom Glielmi
doesn't think that last weekend's
disappointment will carry over to
the NCAA championships next
week. In fact, he thinks it might be a
good thing.
"Honestly, I'm glad we were flat
last weekend," said Glielmi. "You
can be as well prepared as possible
and still come out flat, so I'm glad we
got it out of our system last week
end."
"In addition," he added,"we did
n't have Dylan [Carney] and
|Nakamori] could only go for one
event."
Carney is the team's co-captain
and one of the Cardinal's top com
petitors on high bar, vault, and floor
exercise. With his and Nakamori's
return expected by NCAA Champi
onships, the team is eager to make
up for last week's sub-par perform
ance.
"I think (those struggles] lit a fire
in us," said Nakamori, "We're
stoked."
The NCAA Championships
begin April 17 at Maples Pavilion.
