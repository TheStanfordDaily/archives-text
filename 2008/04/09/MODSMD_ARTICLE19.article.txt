# Gymnasts balance schedules too
## 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford student athletes live busy lives.
Balancing classes and athletics is tough
enough when you're only playing for one
team. When you're competing for two teams at

the same time, busy doesn't go far enough. Ask
Sho Nakamori or David Sender of the Stan
ford Men's Gymnastics team. The duo not
only compete for Stanford, they are members
of the USA Senior National Team.
"This year has been really busy juggling
two seasons at once," said Sho, a redshirt jun

ior. "We've already had three international
meets this year," including a trip halfway
around the world to compete at the World Cup
in Qatar.
Surprisingly, this year Sender, a senior, ac
tually feels better physically.
"My body is more rested, but mentally it

has been tough going between teams," he said.
"I competed a lot more for Stanford last year
because we had a lot of injuries to key guys."
Sender, an Illinois native, was an Olympic
Trials competitor and two-time U.S. champion
on vault by the time he arrived on the Farm in
2(X)4. As a freshman, he reached the finals at
the NCAA Championships in parallel bars
and was selected to the U.S. Senior National
team after a great performance at the 2005
U.S. Nationals.
But Sender really broke out at the 2006
NCAA championship meet as a sophomore.
He reached the finals in three events — in
cluding a national title on vault — and fin
ished fifth in the all-around. Sender won the
NCAA vault title again and finished fourth in
the all-around in 2007 to establish himself as
one of the top gymnasts in the nation.
"I don't really think much of vault as an
event — I always thought it wasn't very hard,"
said Sender, laughing. "I guess it just turned
out that I was good at it."
More than just the judges have seen how
good Dave is on vault: after placing fourth in
the event at the World Cup, USA Gymnastics
took notice as well.
"They told me they were impressed at
Qatar. It was a really tough field of competi
tors, so I was very proud of my performance."
But Sender's success in the gym hasn't gone
to his head. In fact, it may have motivated him
further. When asked what he thought about
his performance this year at Stanford and as a
member of Team USA, he was very candid.
"Both my NCAA and international sea
sons have been OK, but not spectacular," he
said. "This year is important obviously be
cause it is an Olympic year, but it is almost as
important with NCAA Championships at
home — and we have a good chance to win."
While he is extremely busy. Sender does
have a friend to share the journey, as
Nakamori is his teammate. Sho has also found
it difficult to compete for two teams at once,
but he cites the depth of the Stanford team as
the reason he doesn't feel too guilty about
leaving for international competitions.
"We're lucky to have a lot of depth, and it

Sho Nakamori competed at a meet earlier this year. Nakamori not only has to balance on the beams, but he also has to balance a full schedule
involving competition both with Stanford and Team USA.
