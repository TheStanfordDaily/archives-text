# Easier for U.S. students to benefit from recent changes in financial aid
## Aid policy differs for int'l students 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the University unveiled a
historically large expansion in its
financial aid for domestic students
earlier this quarter, the aid picture
for international students continues
to be complicated.
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper said that Stanford is "treat
ing [international students] the same
way as domestic students" once they
are admitted. But she acknowledged
that recent announcements about
domestic aid do not easily translate
to international aid.
"There are many variables ...
which make it difficult to say how
any individual international student
is going to be affected by these
changes," the Office of Financial Aid
Web site states. "We will continue to
evaluate international applications
on a case-by-case basis."
Cooper cited the difficulties of
implementing policies across diverse
national backgrounds.
"It's hard to apply a benchmark
for an economy where $100,000 may
mean something very different from
ours," Cooper said. "We are doing
the same kind of things for middle
class families abroad, but we can't
come out with a bold statement
about it."
International students appreciat
ed the announcements, but found
that they were less applicable to
their own situations.
"From my personal experience,
and from speaking with a couple of
others, it was great to know that this

is being done," said Rowza TUr
Rumma '10, who is from
Bangladesh. "But it didn't seem to
affect us at all."
Domestic applicants, further
more, are treated as "need-blind,"
meaning that students are admitted
regardless of their ability to pay. For
international students, however,
admission is not need-blind.
International admission is need
blind at a handful of other schools,
including Harvard, Yale and
Princeton.
According to Cooper, if an inter
national applicant indicates that he
or she will be seeking financial aid
from the University, that applicant is
placed into a pool of applicants who
will be requiring assistance, which
has more pronounced competition
for admittance. Without indicating
that he or she will be seeking aid, an
international student cannot receive
aid over the four years at Stanford.
If a student is from a family that
is able to pay for undergraduate
education at Stanford without assis
tance, then that student is placed
into another, less selective applicant
pool. Cooper said.
"International students are sim
ply more expensive," Cooper said.
"They're not eligible for federal or
gateway programs, they often can't
borrow and they have limited work
opportunities. It makes it way more
challenging."
The University has announced a
goal to increase international finan
cial aid as part of the focus on
undergraduate scholarships in "The
Stanford Challenge," the
University's five-year, $4.3 billion
fundraising campaign.
"Stanford is one of a small group
of colleges and universities commit
ted to need-blind admissions," the
Stanford Challenge Web site states.
"We now seek to redouble that
commitment, lowering the financial
burden on low-income families and
extending need-based aid to inter
national students."
ITie Financial Aid Office is also
currently pursuing a strategy of
incrementally increasing aid for
international students each year,
with the end goal of a uniform
assessment of international appli
cants.
"Hie pool for students seeking

financial aid is far more competitive,
and at the moment, we only admit a
limited number of students from the
more competitive pool," Cooper
said. "But we increase that number
every year, as more funds become
available, and we're going to be
doing that every year until we can
get to where we can offer need
blind admission."
The different policies for domes
tic and international applicants have
recently attracted attention from
students, including ASSU
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Priyanka Sharma '09. Sharma, who
came to Stanford from India,
formed a committee for
International Need-Blind
Admission and Financial Aid.
"We want to bring [international]
need-blind admission to Stanford,"
Sharma said. "Every year we are
losing very good students to other
schools. 1 had friends who didn't
even apply, and wound up on the

Hast Coast."
The committee is focusing on
increasing the rate of progress
toward international need-blind
admission by increasing student
awareness and activism about the
issue.
"I would like to see the increases
progress faster," Sharma said. "I
believe that the administration is
doing all they can, but if we can get
student voices involved we can
make more progress."
Other international students
expressed similar concerns.
"International need-blind aid is a
must if Stanford wants to ensure
that they do not discriminate against
those who cannot afford their
tuition," said Jonathan Lau '10, who
is from Hong Kong. "Stanford
would find itself with so much over
seas talent that it wouldn't know
what to do."
"I think this is something
Stanford can and should afford to

have on an ethical basis," he added.
"Although I am sure there are many
complications to implementing this
policy."
Others pointed out the conse
quences of the policy for the fami
lies of international students.
"It can happen that international
students, whose families are not
really in a position to pay for the
school, still apply to Stanford and
other top schools without request
ing financial aid to avoid the disad
vantage," said Nal Kalchbrenner'lo,
who is from Switzerland. "But if
they are admitted, then their fami
lies end up in a difficult dilemma."
Sharma said the committee will
continue to try to raise awareness
among the student body about
international financial aid in the
hopes of effecting change.
"It's a pressing need," she said.

assessment of international appli
cants.
"Hie pool for students seeking

financial aid is far more competitive,
and at the moment, we only admit a
limited number of students from the
more competitive pool," Cooper
said. "But we increase that number
every year, as more funds become
available, and we're going to be
doing that every year until we can
get to where we can offer need
blind admission."
The different policies for domes
tic and international applicants have
recently attracted attention from
students, including ASSU
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Priyanka Sharma '09. Sharma, who
came to Stanford from India,
formed a committee for
International Need-Blind
Admission and Financial Aid.
"We want to bring [international]
need-blind admission to Stanford,"
Sharma said. "Every year we are
losing very good students to other
schools. 1 had friends who didn't
even apply, and wound up on the

Hast Coast."
The committee is focusing on
increasing the rate of progress
toward international need-blind
admission by increasing student
awareness and activism about the
issue.
"I would like to see the increases
progress faster," Sharma said. "I
believe that the administration is
doing all they can, but if we can get
student voices involved we can
make more progress."
Other international students
expressed similar concerns.
"International need-blind aid is a
must if Stanford wants to ensure
that they do not discriminate against
those who cannot afford their
tuition," said Jonathan Lau '10, who
is from Hong Kong. "Stanford
would find itself with so much over
seas talent that it wouldn't know
what to do."
"I think this is something
Stanford can and should afford to

have on an ethical basis," he added.
"Although I am sure there are many
complications to implementing this
policy."
Others pointed out the conse
quences of the policy for the fami
lies of international students.
"It can happen that international
students, whose families are not
really in a position to pay for the
school, still apply to Stanford and
other top schools without request
ing financial aid to avoid the disad
vantage," said Nal Kalchbrenner'lo,
who is from Switzerland. "But if
they are admitted, then their fami
lies end up in a difficult dilemma."
Sharma said the committee will
continue to try to raise awareness
among the student body about
international financial aid in the
hopes of effecting change.
"It's a pressing need," she said.
