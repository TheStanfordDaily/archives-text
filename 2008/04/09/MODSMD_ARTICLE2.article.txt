# Easier for U.S. students to benefit from recent changes in financial aid
## Aid policy differs for int'l students 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the University unveiled a
historically large expansion in its
financial aid for domestic students
earlier this quarter, the aid picture
for international students continues
to be complicated.
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper said that Stanford is "treat
ing [international students] the same
way as domestic students" once they
are admitted. But she acknowledged
that recent announcements about
domestic aid do not easily translate
to international aid.
"There are many variables ...
which make it difficult to say how
any individual international student
is going to be affected by these
changes," the Office of Financial Aid
Web site states. "We will continue to
evaluate international applications
on a case-by-case basis."
Cooper cited the difficulties of
implementing policies across diverse
national backgrounds.
"It's hard to apply a benchmark
for an economy where $100,000 may
mean something very different from
ours," Cooper said. "We are doing
the same kind of things for middle
class families abroad, but we can't
come out with a bold statement
about it."
International students appreciat
ed the announcements, but found
that they were less applicable to
their own situations.
"From my personal experience,
and from speaking with a couple of
others, it was great to know that this

is being done," said Rowza TUr
Rumma '10, who is from
Bangladesh. "But it didn't seem to
affect us at all."
Domestic applicants, further
more, are treated as "need-blind,"
meaning that students are admitted
regardless of their ability to pay. For
international students, however,
admission is not need-blind.
International admission is need
blind at a handful of other schools,
including Harvard, Yale and
Princeton.
According to Cooper, if an inter
national applicant indicates that he
or she will be seeking financial aid
from the University, that applicant is
placed into a pool of applicants who
will be requiring assistance, which
has more pronounced competition
for admittance. Without indicating
that he or she will be seeking aid, an
international student cannot receive
aid over the four years at Stanford.
If a student is from a family that
is able to pay for undergraduate
education at Stanford without assis
tance, then that student is placed
into another, less selective applicant
pool. Cooper said.
"International students are sim
ply more expensive," Cooper said.
"They're not eligible for federal or
gateway programs, they often can't
borrow and they have limited work
opportunities. It makes it way more
challenging."
The University has announced a
goal to increase international finan
cial aid as part of the focus on
undergraduate scholarships in "The
