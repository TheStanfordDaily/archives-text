# Picking up the pieces

### 
First, an apology to my readers
that this column isn't about the
women's basketball team. As
often as possible, 1 like to stay away
from the general wave of negativity
that pervades sports pages every
where, and ordinarily I would jump
at the chance to write about a Stan
ford team in a major sport achieving
big things on the national level. But
because I'm not able to travel
through time and see who wins the
Tennessee-Stanford title game be
fore the time this column is due, the
women's play will have to do the
talking for them, as it has all season.
So it seems that this column, in
stead, will focus on the grimmer real
ities of the other side of Stanford
hoops. And for the Cardinal men and
their fans, it would be hard to imag
ine a worse series of events than what
transpired after that inspiring win
over Marquette.
First, it was a crushing loss to
Texas. Then, throw in the Lopez
twins declaring early for the NBA
Draft. Add a dash of an old. respect
ed coach going to work for an archri
val and you've got one heck of a bad
week and a half.
The funny thing is. it all comes on
the heels of a Sweet Sixteen finish for
the Cardinal, which is a program best
since Stanford's 2001 run to the Elite
Eight. It's a good year for almost any
program and ordinarily would be a
great year for the Cardinal. Indeed, I
would venture to guess that if you of
fered Stanford a top-sixteen finish in
the NCAA Tournament before any
of the last twenty-odd seasons start
ed. they would accept without hesita
tion in all of them.
With the possible exception of
this one. that is.
The stars were truly aligned for
Stanford coming into the 2007-08
season. With every player returning
from a squad that had been competi
tive in a highly skilled Pac-10, there
was no reason to doubt the Cardinal
this year.
And yet, Trent Johnson's squad
never seemed to hit on all cylinders
quite in the way fans had hoped. To
be sure. Brook and Robin Lopez
each made big strides in their respec
tive low post games and were able to
carry their Stanford teammates
through rough patches more than
ever. But the duo's supporting cast
remained just that, with no other
player for the Cardinal able to con
sistently take pressure off of the
twins down low.
And so, with the season over, and
the building blocks for a possible
Final Four run now gone, the Cardi
nal is left with nothing but question
marks. Can Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Hill regain their scoring
prowess now that they will likely be
the featured players in the Stanford
offense? Will Landry Fields take the
next step forward in his develop
ment? What will Johnson do to offset
his pair of giant personnel losses and
where will the next Stanford super
star on the hardwood come from
(and when, for that matter, will he ar
rive)?
Making these questions still more
bothersome is that Stanford fans
everywhere will have to wait until
next season to find out the answers to
them. And they will do so without
their security blanket, now that for
mer coach Mike Montgomery has
moved on .... to Cal.
Before there was always the hope
that no matter what happened with
Trent Johnson's team next year and
beyond, the Cardinal would have
Monty to fall back on. If the program
collapsed. Monty could build it hack
up again. He'd done it before, after
all. It was comforting to know that
Montgomery could be the solution
to even a Stanford fan's worst night
mares for the foreseeable future
without God's gift to a college front
court (I mean, seven foot tall twins
athletic enough to play, and excel, in
the Pac-10 — can we pause to ad
mire the sheer biological unlikeli
hood of that for a moment)?
But now? Say that things go bad .
.. say that the Cardinal is left hoping
for the NIT next year rather than the
Big Dance. Say that they fall from
second in the Pac-10 to seventh. It's a
scary prospect, and maybe moreso


Denis
Griffin
Ranis and Raves
for the Bay Area, now watching what
the Giants have become without
Barry Bonds, who was God's gift to
hitting — or chemistry's gift, de
pending on your point of view. But

either way, when I look at the Cardi
nal's roster now that Brook and
Robin Lopez are on their way out, it
has the same hollow look the Giants'
had as Bonds declined, and. sudden
ly, was gone.
One can hope that it never hap
pens, and that the Cardinal stays
afloat in the post-Lopez era. One can
hope that at worst, Trent Johnson and
Co. merely return to the not-so-terri

ble days of being a pretty decent team
in one of the nation's best confer
ences, if not the best. One can hope.
But hope or not, in a brave new
world of Stanford basketball, we're
all stuck in wait-and-see mode.

Denis Griffin is a senior who worries
too much. Tell him how great Stanford
basketball will be at djgriff
