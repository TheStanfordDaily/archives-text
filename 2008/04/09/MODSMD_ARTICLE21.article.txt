Baseball suspended due to darkness
at 5-5
No. 10 Stanford and No. 5 Cal
played to a 5-5 tie in a non-confer
ence game which was called due to
darkness at Evans Diamond in
Berkeley on Monday. The game was
suspended after 13 innings and it has
yet to be determined if the game will
count as a tie officially or be resumed
at a later date.
Stanford led the game 3-0 just an
inning and a half into the contest be
fore allowing Cal to take a 5-4 lead in
the sixth.The score stayed there until
the ninth inning when junior Cord
Phelps delivered a two-out RBI sin
gle to tie the game, forcing it into
extra innings. Phelps was 3-for-5 with
a homerun and four RBIs on the
night.
The Cardinal plays tonight in a
non-conference game at Sunken Di
amond against UC Davis at 6 p.m.

Oregon State for a three-game series
this weekend.
Men's tennis bounces back with 6-1
win
The No. 28 men's tennis team
broke a two-match skid yesterday
with a 6-1 win over St. Mary's at Stan
ford. The Cardinal was returning
home after getting swept by USC
and UCLA on a southern California
road trip, both by 6-1 scores.
Things started off looking gloomy
for the Card, who dropped the dou
bles point amid chilly and windy con
ditions at Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter to head into singles play down 1-
0. Stanford was able to rediscover its
winning ways in singles play, though.
