## 'Other woman' shadows Chelsea 
### TOM DAVIES THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) —
Chelsea Clinton is spending long
days on the campaign trail telling col
lege crowds about her mother's posi
tions on everything from health care
and student-loan costs to the Darfur
crisis and gay rights.
But there is one subject she will
not discuss - "The Other Woman."
At least three times in the past
two weeks, the former and possible
future first daughter has been asked
about the Monica Lewinsky scan
dal's influence on the presidential
campaign of her mother. New York
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The answer has evolved each
time.
When a student at Butler
University in Indianapolis first asked
the question on March 25, she drew
applause and gave a short response
that ended with: "I do not think that
is any of your business."
Clinton. 28, since has been less
blunt, though the message is much
the same.
"I think that is something that is
personal to my family, I'm sure there
are things that are personal to your
family that you don't think are any

one else's business, either," she said
last week when asked during a visit
to North Carolina State University in
Raleigh. "But also on a larger point, I
don't think you should vote for or
against my mother because of my
father."
Many in the crowd at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, Ind.,
booed Monday when a question
about the impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton came up.
Chelsea Clinton quickly summed up
her position: "If that's what you want
to vote on, that's what you should
vote on. But I think there are other
people (who are) going to vote on
things like health care and econom
ics," she said.
Amanda Morris, president of
Purdue's Students for Hillary chap
ter, said TUesday that she approved of
the audience reaction and how
Clinton is responding. She also
expects the question might keep
coming up.
"I really think it has gotten to the
point where it is the attention thing,"
said Morris, a sophomore from
Kokomo, Ind. "At first, maybe that
student really wanted to know what
she thought about it. But by now it's
'Oh, that person got attention for it,
I'm going to keep asking.'"

Philippe Reines, a Clinton cam
paign spokesman, said Chelsea
Clinton has made 99 campus appear
ances through TUesday, and typically
has taken 10 to 20 questions at each
stop. He said the Lewinsky matter
was not a burning issue among the
people who have attended.
"She has been asked less than a
handful of times, and she has been
clear on where her lines of privacy
are," Reines said. "She has the right
as everyone does to define their own
zone of privacy."
Reines said her campaign stops
would continue unchanged. She does
not take questions from reporters,
but devotes all but the first few min
utes of her appearances to questions
from the audience.
On TUesday, Chelsea Clinton visit
ed three more college campuses in
Indiana, where her mother and
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama are
actively campaigning to win the May
6 presidential primary. She was wrap
ping up her second campaign swing
across the state.
"She really has gotten more ques
tions on whether or not her mother
believes the U.S. dollar should be tied
to the gold standard," Reines said.
"That's a question she's gotten prob
ably 10 times."
