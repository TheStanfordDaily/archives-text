Why am I running for Senate?

All Stanford students are able to
mobilize to change University poli
cies, but having the support of the
student body through the ASSU
makes the administration take no
tice to actually incite change. As a
Senate Associate, 1 have seen how
the inner workings of the Senate
take place. I want to use this knowl
edge to pursue a fair distribution of
funds to student groups, lower
VSO costs, enforcement against
Acts of Intolerance, cheaper
course-reader prices, longer library
hours, better student spaces and a
living wage for workers on campus.
