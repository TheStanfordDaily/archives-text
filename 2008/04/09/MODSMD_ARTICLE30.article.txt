### 
It's with great excitement
that I enter the race to
serve on the Undergrad
uate Senate. If elected,
I'll advocate for academ
ic, social and political ini
tiatives that benefit the
Stanford community.
Through serving on Uni
versity committees with
administrators and par
ticipating in student orga
nizations, my involve
ment at Stanford has ex
posed me to top issues
facing students. Among
these are increasing fac
ulty/graduate diversity,
decreasing VSO costs, in
creasing Acts of Intoler-

ance awareness, improving communication of funding policies to
student groups and making student spaces like Old Union more
conducive for individual and social use.
