For two years now, I have witnessed the amazing level of motiva-

tion students have here. As a Senator, I
hope to be as motivated in helping stu
dents change this University. I will ad
vocate for initiatives that are inspired
by the students of this University.
I hese initiatives include encouraging
diversity through collaborative events
across communities and combating
acts of intolerance by including sensi
tivity programming for faculty, admin
istrators and students. I also plan to ad
vocate for full composting programs

and healthier food choices in all eateries, as well as improved stu
dent spaces in student unions.
