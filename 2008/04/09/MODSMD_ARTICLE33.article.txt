Dedication, Creativity, Open-minded
ness. Hard work. Integrity, Belief, Re
sults. This is what you get when you de
pend on me. One of my goals will be
working to improve campus life by mak
ing Old Union a place where students
can gather together to hang out, meet
new people, relax and have fun. In the
ASSU, I hope to work to strengthen re
lations between the Senate and student
body so it can truly be the voice of the
students. In addition, I'll work to im
prove faculty and student diversity and

to lower costs to volunteer student organizations. Remember me
it's the one with the apostrophe!
