# GILBERT JIMENEZ '11

When I was but a wee lad, a new man
named Mr. Rodriguez moved into my
neighborhood. My parents told me not
to go near him, but they would not ex
plain why. It turns out that this new man
fancied young boys. However, thanks to
Megan's Law, 1 was protected. As a
Senator, I will not rest (although my
photo may not convey this) until sick
people like Mr. Rodriguez are brought
to justice, an issue that the administra
tion has ignored for far too long. Won't
somebody please think of the children?
With Gilberto Jimenez as your Senator,
somebody will.
