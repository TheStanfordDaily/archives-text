### 
To keep things short: I'm running for
ASSU Senate to represent the interests
of the general student body. While I
fully support the groups by which I'm
endorsed, I'm not running to be the
voice box of a student group. I'm pri
marily a social candidate, meaning that I
want to rebuild Old Union into a social
nexus, network with surrounding
schools for amazing social and commu
nity service events, and provide more
social outlets for the wide interests pre
sent in our student body. If you want a
more sociable campus and more practi-

cal policies, vote Zachary Johnson for ASSU Senate
