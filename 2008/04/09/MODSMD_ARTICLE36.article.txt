I am excited to run for ASSU under
graduate senate this year. I believe that
the ASSU can only be a true advocate
for students when it continuously listens
to the student voice, and not only during
election time. I will make myself avail
able to hear student input throughout
my term. 1 seek to extend the operation
of Green Library, establish a universal
undergraduate residence parking per
mit and enhance the integration of sus
tainable solutions to daily student life. 1
look forward to hearing about your
ideas and concerns; please feel free to
contact me.
