# NEVEEN MAHMOUD '11
## 
### 
No, you haven't seen me on any livers.
Why? I'm running a paperless campaign
to forge change regardless of whether or
not I'm elected. My platform is simple:
You speak, I listen, we generate change.
My priorities are your wants and needs
â€” gender neutral housing, a truly sus
tainable Stanford, lower birth control
costs, centralization of student events,
improvement of student spaces and fa
cilitation of constant dialogue about oc
casionally uncomfortable issues. Visit

http://www.stanford.edu/~nmahmoud for contact info and more
specifics on how I plan to support the student body. Make your
wants into realities with a vote for Neveen Mahmoud!
