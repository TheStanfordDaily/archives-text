# JONATHAN MCMASTER '11
## 
### 
My name is Jonathan McMaster, and I am
asking for your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday for ASSU Senate. I support mo
tions to extend Old Union and Green Li
brary hours, to increase Faculty Diversity,
and to bring more fun activities to Old
Union. Moreover, 1 believe that the Under
graduate Senate must hold true to its duty as
the direct representative of Stanford's Un
dergraduate students. I will ensure that your

voice is heard through "Meet the Senators" events and Senate Of
fice Hours in White Plaza, making the Senate more accessible to
YOU. Remember: Results Faster with MCMASTER! Vote MC
MASTER for ASSU Senate.
