When it mattered the most, Stanford could
n't conquer the Rocky Top.
The Cardinal fell to Tennessee, 64-48, in the
national championship game TUesday night as
Stanford's run through the NCAA Tournament
came to a sudden halt. The Lady Vols dominat
ed in all aspects of the game as they wrapped up
their second straight title and eighth overall.
Stanford's performance was arguably their
worst of the year: their points, made and
attempted baskets, assists, blocks and — most
notably — turnover totals were all season lows.
Stanford turned the ball over 25 times, with 14
coming in the first half.
"The turnovers absolutely killed us. We did
not handle the pressure well," said coach Tara
VanDerveer. "I thought we made a lot of
uncharacteristic turnovers and some very bad
decisions."
Tennessee employed a tenacious full court
press for the entire game, and constantly
switched their defense between zone and man
to keep the Cardinal from finding any rhythm
on offense. Stanford was hounded in the back
court all night, and was forced to make tough
passes, many of which were picked off by the
Lady Vols. When they were able to successfully
bring the ball up court, they had less time to
establish their offense.
"We knew that our full court press really
would bother them and take some time off the
clock, so they had to rush their sets," said
Tennessee's Candace Parker, who was named
the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
"We took them out of everything they want
ed to do and they just didn't know what to do
against our defense," said Nicky Anosike.
On Sunday, Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma acknowledged that the Huskies did
not use the full court press enough against
Stanford — but when they did, it worked.
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt found that lesson
to be particularly telling.
