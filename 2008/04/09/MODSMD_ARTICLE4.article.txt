# Lady Vols cruise to eighth title
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
When it mattered the most, Stanford could
n't conquer the Rocky Top.
The Cardinal fell to Tennessee, 64-48, in the
national championship game TUesday night as
Stanford's run through the NCAA Tournament
came to a sudden halt. The Lady Vols dominat
ed in all aspects of the game as they wrapped up
their second straight title and eighth overall.
Stanford's performance was arguably their
worst of the year: their points, made and
attempted baskets, assists, blocks and — most
notably — turnover totals were all season lows.
Stanford turned the ball over 25 times, with 14
coming in the first half.
"The turnovers absolutely killed us. We did
not handle the pressure well," said coach Tara
VanDerveer. "I thought we made a lot of
uncharacteristic turnovers and some very bad
decisions."
Tennessee employed a tenacious full court
press for the entire game, and constantly
switched their defense between zone and man
to keep the Cardinal from finding any rhythm
on offense. Stanford was hounded in the back
court all night, and was forced to make tough
passes, many of which were picked off by the
Lady Vols. When they were able to successfully
bring the ball up court, they had less time to
establish their offense.
"We knew that our full court press really
would bother them and take some time off the
clock, so they had to rush their sets," said
Tennessee's Candace Parker, who was named
the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
"We took them out of everything they want
ed to do and they just didn't know what to do
against our defense," said Nicky Anosike.
On Sunday, Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma acknowledged that the Huskies did
not use the full court press enough against
Stanford — but when they did, it worked.
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt found that lesson
to be particularly telling.

"I thought that as soon as Connecticut went to the press,
it really bothered them," she said. "I felt that our size and
being able to extend our defense would be a good option for
us."
Stanford senior guard Candice Wiggins, who was named
to the All-Tournament team, agreed. "They rely a lot on their
defense to get them going. And they're big. They're in pass
ing lanes. So you can't have any sloppy passes," she said.
Tennessee was also effective on the glass, particularly on
the offensive end.The fundamentally sound rebounding that
helped propel the Cardinal against Connecticut was absent
against Tennessee. The Lady Vols did not have a great night
shooting the ball — their percentage was only 39.3 percent
for the game, including 33.3 percent in the second half But
they had a number of second chance opportunities, pulling
down 14 offensive rebounds.
Anosike, who joined Parker and Wiggins along with
teammate Shannon Bobbitt and LSU's Sylvia Fowles on the
All-Tournament team, was particularly effective, grabbing
three balls off the offensive glass and chipping in 13 points.
Tennessee's second — and third — chances negated
what was otherwise a nice defensive performance by Stan
ford. They held Parker in check for most of the game, and
successfully shut down Alexis Hornbuckle. But Anosike and
Bobbitt — who had been inconsistent throughout the tour
nament — were both on their game. Bobbitt hit two crucial
three-pointers at the beginning of the game that helped Ten
nessee create some separation early. Vicki Baugh con
tributed a clutch eight points off the bench for the Lady Vols,
helping them extinguish Cardinal runs before they even got
started.
Still, Stanford was not out of the game until the midway
point of the second half. They trailed only by eight heading
into halftime, and despite a period of their worst basketball
of the season, they were still close. If they could have turned
it around just a bit, they would have been in good shape. Stan
ford quickly cut the lead to four, but Tennessee was equally
fast in extending the margin to 11. The Cardinal never seri
ously challenged the Lady Vols again. Their shots wouldn't
fall — countless attempts rimmed out — and Tennessee's
persistent defense made their ten point lead seem much
wider.
"Defensively, I thought we actually did a decent job," said
VanDerveer. "But we were not able to run anything offen
sively."
It was a disappointing end to an otherwise brilliant season
for the Cardinal, one in which it beat every opponent it
played (including Tennessee, who they knocked off earlier in
the season, 73-69 in overtime).
"The game itself was not indicative of the great season
we've had," said VanDerveer.
The championship match was the final contest for Wig
gins, the Cardinal's star, who leaves Stanford as the school
and Pac-10 career-scoring leader. Her post-game press con-

ference was an emotional affair — she ultimately broke
down in tears over the prospect of leaving her squad behind.
"This team is a special team. And just beautiful people.
And I've been so honored just to be on this team," she said.
Indeed, Stanford was a stellar unit that became more and
more complete as the season progressed — not only was its
star playing well, but every starter and many reserves con
tributed, too.
Stanford had won 23 straight games before yesterday,and
had cruised through the Pac-10 Tournament und dispensed
opponents at will up in the NCAA Tournament until the
championship game. That, combined with Tennessee's in
consistency, led many experts to pick Stanford to win the
championship.
But, just as the Cardinal felt they had been overlooked
against Connecticut in the semifinals, Tennessee felt that they
weren't getting enough credit themselves.
"I'm telling you, it was a personal thing for them," said
Summitt.'The fact that all of the ESPN talent didn't give us
a chance. I mean, that just really fired them up And it was
probably the best thing that could have happened to us."
The frustration manifested itself on the court, and in the
end, it was the Cardinal who was left behind.

switched their defense between zone and man
to keep the Cardinal from finding any rhythm
on offense. Stanford was hounded in the back
court all night, and was forced to make tough
passes, many of which were picked off by the
Lady Vols. When they were able to successfully
bring the ball up court, they had less time to
establish their offense.
"We knew that our full court press really
would bother them and take some time off the
clock, so they had to rush their sets," said
Tennessee's Candace Parker, who was named
the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
"We took them out of everything they want
ed to do and they just didn't know what to do
against our defense," said Nicky Anosike.
On Sunday, Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma acknowledged that the Huskies did
not use the full court press enough against
Stanford — but when they did, it worked.
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt found that lesson
to be particularly telling.

"I thought that as soon as Connecticut went to the press,
it really bothered them," she said. "I felt that our size and
being able to extend our defense would be a good option for
us."
Stanford senior guard Candice Wiggins, who was named
to the All-Tournament team, agreed. "They rely a lot on their
defense to get them going. And they're big. They're in pass
ing lanes. So you can't have any sloppy passes," she said.
Tennessee was also effective on the glass, particularly on
the offensive end.The fundamentally sound rebounding that
helped propel the Cardinal against Connecticut was absent
against Tennessee. The Lady Vols did not have a great night
shooting the ball — their percentage was only 39.3 percent
for the game, including 33.3 percent in the second half But
they had a number of second chance opportunities, pulling
down 14 offensive rebounds.
Anosike, who joined Parker and Wiggins along with
teammate Shannon Bobbitt and LSU's Sylvia Fowles on the
All-Tournament team, was particularly effective, grabbing
three balls off the offensive glass and chipping in 13 points.
Tennessee's second — and third — chances negated
what was otherwise a nice defensive performance by Stan
ford. They held Parker in check for most of the game, and
successfully shut down Alexis Hornbuckle. But Anosike and
Bobbitt — who had been inconsistent throughout the tour
nament — were both on their game. Bobbitt hit two crucial
three-pointers at the beginning of the game that helped Ten
nessee create some separation early. Vicki Baugh con
tributed a clutch eight points off the bench for the Lady Vols,
helping them extinguish Cardinal runs before they even got
started.
Still, Stanford was not out of the game until the midway
point of the second half. They trailed only by eight heading
into halftime, and despite a period of their worst basketball
of the season, they were still close. If they could have turned
it around just a bit, they would have been in good shape. Stan
ford quickly cut the lead to four, but Tennessee was equally
fast in extending the margin to 11. The Cardinal never seri
ously challenged the Lady Vols again. Their shots wouldn't
fall — countless attempts rimmed out — and Tennessee's
persistent defense made their ten point lead seem much
wider.
"Defensively, I thought we actually did a decent job," said
VanDerveer. "But we were not able to run anything offen
sively."
It was a disappointing end to an otherwise brilliant season
for the Cardinal, one in which it beat every opponent it
played (including Tennessee, who they knocked off earlier in
the season, 73-69 in overtime).
"The game itself was not indicative of the great season
we've had," said VanDerveer.
The championship match was the final contest for Wig
gins, the Cardinal's star, who leaves Stanford as the school
and Pac-10 career-scoring leader. Her post-game press con-

down in tears over the prospect of leaving her squad behind.

Indeed, Stanford was a stellar unit that became more and
more complete as the season progressed — not only was its

Stanford had won 23 straight games before yesterday,and
had cruised through the Pac-10 Tournament und dispensed
opponents at will up in the NCAA Tournament until the
championship game. That, combined with Tennessee's in
consistency, led many experts to pick Stanford to win the
championship.
But, just as the Cardinal felt they had been overlooked
against Connecticut in the semifinals, Tennessee felt that they
weren't getting enough credit themselves.
"I'm telling you, it was a personal thing for them," said
Summitt.'The fact that all of the ESPN talent didn't give us
a chance. I mean, that just really fired them up And it was
probably the best thing that could have happened to us."

Tennessee's Candace Parker smiled as she embraced teammate Shannon
Bobbit (number 00). Parker was named the most outstanding player of the
tournament and, despite battling injuries, led her team to its second straight
NCAA title.
When it mattered the most, Stanford could
n't conquer the Rocky Top.
The Cardinal fell to Tennessee, 64-48, in the
national championship game TUesday night as
Stanford's run through the NCAA Tournament
came to a sudden halt. The Lady Vols dominat
ed in all aspects of the game as they wrapped up
their second straight title and eighth overall.
Stanford's performance was arguably their
worst of the year: their points, made and
attempted baskets, assists, blocks and — most
notably — turnover totals were all season lows.
Stanford turned the ball over 25 times, with 14
coming in the first half.
"The turnovers absolutely killed us. We did
not handle the pressure well," said coach Tara
VanDerveer. "I thought we made a lot of
uncharacteristic turnovers and some very bad
decisions."
Tennessee employed a tenacious full court
press for the entire game, and constantly
switched their defense between zone and man
to keep the Cardinal from finding any rhythm
on offense. Stanford was hounded in the back
