# MATTHEW MESHER '09
## 
### 
Why am I running? To make your
voice heard. Did you know that the ad
ministration is planning to eliminate
the HPAC and Peer Mentor roles?
Did you know when the CoHo was
closing? Did you know that Stanford
doesn't recognize individuals who
don't fit into the gender binary? It's
time we had a say in these decisions. I
want to reassert our voice into Univer
sity decisions from gender-blind hous
ing to residential education to find a
solution that works for the student
body and the administration.

The following students are also candidates for the ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate, but did not submit responses to The Daily.
