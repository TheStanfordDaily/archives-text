I am running for Senate because I care about
this school, and I care about this student
body. I believe that because I do care, 1 can
make a difference. 1 have held several student
government offices over the past six years. If
elected, 1 will work diligently toward foster
ing significant improvement in cultural diver
sity and understanding. I will also work in
concert with my fellow senators in bringing
about positive change in the quality of life

here at Stanford by pushing for a more student-centered Old
Union, sustainability and organic food options and lower course
reader prices.
