# DANIEL SCOTT SMITH '11
## 
### 
Senate's a big deal to me. As
a Senate Associate, I worked
with Senators on various ini
tiatives, such as advocating
for international need-blind
admissions, drafting the
Rumsfeld bill and gender
neutral housing. However,
this isn't enough. During my
tenure as a senator, 1 will
concentrate in four major
areas: diversity, equality, sus
tainability and health. I will
expand the faculty diversity
initiative to include the
GLBTQ community; I will
make sure gender-neutral re
strooms are available cam-

pus-wide; 1 will help eradicate the use of styrofoam; 1 will explore
implementing designated smoking zones.
