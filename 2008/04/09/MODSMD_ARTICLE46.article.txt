# MAX SOSNA-SPEAR '11
## 
### 
My campaign is centered,
more or less, around the
idea of the ASSU as an ad
vocacy organization for stu
dents. Previously, the Sen
ate has existed primarily to
fund student groups. My vi
sion is that the Senate can

serve as the voice of the students, calling for specialization of stu
dent spaces, graduate and faculty diversity, a transparent hiring
process and expanded fair labor policies. 1 have experience as an
Exec Aide and a Frosh Councilman and am endorsed by both
SOCC and the Stanford Democrats, and 1 am looking forward to

representing you this year!
