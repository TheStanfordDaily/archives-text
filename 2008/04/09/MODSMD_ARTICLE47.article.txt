# BRIANA TATUM '11
## 
### 
As an executive
aide, I gained expe
rience and discov
ered innovative
ways that the ASSU
is able to better
serve the student
body. If elected to
the undergraduate
senate, I will pro
mote awareness of
the daily issues that
face the Stanford
community. Sus
tainability and di
versity are high pri
orities. 1 will work
to increase accep
tance of cultural
and religious differ
ences by unifying
groups and embrac
ing diversity. I sup
port green living
and would like to in-

crease healthy eating options in the dining hall and make access to
organic foods easier. 1 am endorsed by SOCC, SPEACK and Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford.
