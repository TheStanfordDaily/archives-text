Some people didn't know

what ASSU is until now
with the onslaught of
campaign fliers. This is a
sign that ASSU needs to
take holder steps toward
an improved Stanford. As
a senator. I would set at
tainable goals and achieve
tangible results toward
ASSU's mission: "create
new services that will im
prove the quality of stu
dent life." I would strive
to make Stanford more
convenient, by converting to all-day dining and lengthening Green
Library hours; more affordable, by establishing competitive text
book, food, and general stores; and more socially aware, by host
ing and actively supporting these events. Take bolder steps with
Lilly Zhu.
