We, the McLeven Slate, are tremendously ex
cited for the opportunity to be your Sophomore
Class Presidents for next year. We see being class
presidents not only as a chance to get involved,
but, more importantly, as a chance to serve you,
the student body. Over the next year, we hope to
contribute to an environment of excitement, sup
port and openness on campus. Our goals revolve
around making next year as fulfilling as possible
while having a ton of fun along the way.

In addition to successfully and creatively
putting on the traditional Sophomore Class events
such as l ull Moon on the Ouad, Sophomore Con
vocation and Sophomore Formal, we aim to orga
nize a bonfire, a sophomore pool party and cook
out and a concert event, along with sponsoring
multiple public service ventures for our class
mates.
Although class presidents traditionally serve in
a largely social context, we are committed to pro
viding a substantive Ickus by incorporating envi
ronmental sustainability into many of our activi
ties. Endorsed by Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford, we believe that we have laid the groundwork
for great successes in this area for next year. An
other bonus: we have contacted the Apple Corpo
ration several times, and they have expressed in
terest in sponsoring our sustainable events.
Who are we? We lead; we dance; we debate; we
volunteer; we tutor; we love life. We come from
Sacramento, Philly, Sparks and Yakima. We are
MCLEVEN.
