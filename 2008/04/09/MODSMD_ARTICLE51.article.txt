Dear Voters,
Oh-Lovin' consists of very qualified, down-to
earth people. We're current ASSU Executive Aides
and Frosh Council Representatives, and we even
have a member who's earned Presidential and Con
gressional recognition for strong leadership and
community service. With all the craziness of elec
tions, we'd just like to remind our class to vote based
on qualifications and issues. We're not a flashy or
loud group, but we do have a strong platform that
we think you will really support.
