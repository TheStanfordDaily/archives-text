Dear Voters,
Oh-Lovin' consists of very qualified, down-to
earth people. We're current ASSU Executive Aides
and Frosh Council Representatives, and we even
have a member who's earned Presidential and Con
gressional recognition for strong leadership and
community service. With all the craziness of elec
tions, we'd just like to remind our class to vote based
on qualifications and issues. We're not a flashy or
loud group, but we do have a strong platform that
we think you will really support.
No Car? Our Oh-Lovin' Grocery Express will make weekly
runs to Safeway or Whole Foods!
Interested in Compostables? You'll get them campus-wide!
Want to vote on a theme or create a playlist for Formal? Want
answers to your pressing questions? We'll find answers FOR you
at 2011 .stanford.edu, where we respond to you!
We'll plan class community service projects like building
homes for the poor, community clean-ups and social events serv
ing as fundraisers for Cancer Research and AIDS Awareness.
Want Formal in San Francisco? In the SF Aquarium? You'll
net it!

Support creating a more social environment in our Student
Unions? We do too!
We've met with Dining Executives, Parking and Transporta
tion and even President Hcnnessy. We have the framework; now
we just need your vote.
It's been a pleasure meeting you all so far. We look forward to
working with you. For qualifications and endorsements, see Face
book Group "Oh-Lovin'."
Remember, VOTE FOR WHAT YOU WANT, NOT WHO
YOU WANT! We'd Oh-Love your vote!
