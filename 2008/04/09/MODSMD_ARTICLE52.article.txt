Class presidents do more than planning formals and study
breaks; they create opportunities for our class to relax and enjoy
our time at Stanford. This means everything from small opportu
nities like volunteering to bonding at massive class-wide events.
Our platform focuses on the l'un and academic success that we
wish for our class members. We'll start with laid-back events like an
ice cream/root beer float field day and Old I Jnion Courtyard Movie
Night. ITien we'll transform larger events, like a better and longer
Mausoleum Party and a Junior Formal, to be so incredible you won't
leave after only 30 minutes. In the midst of all this fun, we will have
your intellectual interests in mind by telling you about opportunities
and deadlines with the CDC or the Haas Center.
We know how to get our promises done. Whether it's planning
new and original events or making traditional events cheaper for
you, our slate members have worked to bring you tree bike lights,
talent shows and a livelier Old Union. That said...
Ilirough our experience, we know promises and events don't
matter unless they're well communicated and, more importantly,
have your input. After all, these events are for you. You'll know
what we're doing, and when you look for something to do tor a
month or during that very weekend, you'll know about our events
in detail and in advance.
Are You In or Out?
