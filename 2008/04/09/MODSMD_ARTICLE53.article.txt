We know that our competitors are very capable and intelligent
people; most Stanford students are. But with a year of experience
and the addition of a fresh Ronnie Tisdale ' 10, we are the best can
didates for the job. We are a group of hard workers, but with indi
vidual talents, experiences and ideas that contribute to the job. We
let you Bring Your Own Sexy to a successful formal. Our In-n-Out
vs. Jack in the Box Taste Test was the first of its kind. We captured
our class's creativity with Sophomore Showcase at Cantor Arts.
Whether you found friendship or love at Sophomore Speed Dat
ing, we hope to continue these traditions and trends of unity for

ITie Great Class of
2010. We will:
• Ensure class soli
darity through a
variety of fully in
elusive and enter
taining social
events. As it is cus
tomary for formals
to be in a better
venue junior year,
we are already
working on allevi
ating some of the
cost that this may
entail.

Serve as liaisons between the student body and the ASSU in order
to address the well being of the junior class, sustainability and bet
ter academic initiatives.
• Reaffirm our class commitment to public service in collaboration
with student-run organizations to maximize efficiency. We'll have
a bigger and better EPA Day and unique service opportunities.
• Listen to and execute YOUR plans, such as regular Open Mie
nights.
• Serve as representatives and, most importantly, approachable
friends of each and every member of Stanford University's Class of
2010.
