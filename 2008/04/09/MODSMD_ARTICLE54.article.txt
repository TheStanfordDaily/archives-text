To this end, we are planning
a Giants Game Night in San
Francisco, where we buy several
hundred tickets to a Giants
game and bus students up to San
Francisco for the night. We are
planning Cafe Music Nights that
showcase some of the talent of
the Class of 2011 and allow stu
dents from our class to interact
in a CoHo-likc environment.
We are also planning a fun
Spring BBQ and Pool Party.
But in addition to these so
cial events, we are planning a
Dinner with Nobel Laureates

The four of us are very ex
eited at the prospect of being
the Sophomore Class Presi
dents for the great class of
2011! The four members of
The Soph Touch have en
joyed planning events on
Frosh Council this year and
would love to continue to rep
resent the class of 2011. While
Sophomore Presidents usual
ly just plan Full Moon on the
Quad and Sophomore For
mal, we hope to help all
Sophomores avoid the drop in
social activity that usually ac
companies sophomore year.

Night, a Sophomore Majors and In
ternships Fair, an Arts Festival with
student art and workshops from art
professors and several Community
Service events. We are also endorsed
by Sustainability and hope to make
our events sustainable.
The Soph Touch has an exciting vi
sion for next year, and we would love
to use our experience planning
events to make this vision reality.

Guaranteed.
