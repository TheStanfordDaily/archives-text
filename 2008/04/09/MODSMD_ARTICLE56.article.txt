# ASSU Executive Candidates
## DORSEY-HARRIS 
### 
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You both have
done some very impressive things with pub
lic service. Why the decision to pursue an
ASSH office more known for distributing
hike lights and planning parties?

Jonny Dorsey (JD): Historically the ASSU
has done very important things. When I got
in to Stanford, 1 was told the story of Steve
Westly, ASSU Executive in '78, who used
his platform to divest from South Africa be
cause of apartheid ... But don't get me
wrong — the bike lights are important, the
shuttle service is great. These things aren't
mutually exclusive. We also think the ASSU
can play a bigger role. A lot of my friends
graduated in '07, and were funneled into
consulting and I-Banking, because of the
CDC. That made me very upset. I love the
Haas center, but they have 6 post-grad fel
lowships ... If Stanford had a mission state
ment — it would be to create leaders for a
better good.
TSD: Is your campaign defined by public
service?
JD: No. We want to engage the broader stu
dent body. That requires working on the big
ger issues that get them engaged. More im
portant is working with students, and work
ing with the broader administration and the
trustees. It's creating a structure making sure
that the student voice is powerful.

Jonny Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09

TSI): A lot of the executive slates have sim
ilar platforms. What sets your platform
apart?
Pagan Harris: It's also important to make
the distinction between process and content.
There arc similarities with content. But with
process, what we are proposing is a complete
departure from the way the ASSU runs.
Right now we have 20 percent really en-

gaged in the ASSU. That leaves 80
percent of the students who don't care.
TSI): The ASSU is famous for grid
lock and division. How will you over
come that?
Jl): This year, the executive and un
dergraduate senate didn't work to
gether very much. Even if it's hard,
and unpleasant, we are going to work
very hard to make sure we are all
working together. We are also going
work with the administration and the
trustees.
FH: There's no accountability. There's
a lot of division, but that's superficial.
That can be done away with; it's all
about the process. We bring an aver
age student perspective. This stuff is
not revolutionary.
