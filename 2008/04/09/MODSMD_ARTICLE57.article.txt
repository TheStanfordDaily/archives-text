Sogar Doshi '09 and Phillip Hon '10
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You have both spent
time within the Executive branch of the ASSU. How
would this shape your tenure as president and vice
president?
Sagar Doshi (SD): The best way to frame this is to
recognize the problem the ASSU has — the issue of
institutional memory. We and anyone else who is
running are essentially in office for one year. That's
a short period of time ... You get a lot of repetition,
just because you don't know what's happened in the
past. Given what we have done, we won't have to go
over some of that same ground. For long-term pro
jects like diversity, we can just keep things going.
Phillip Hon(PH): We know what has already hap
pened, and we know what has failed. We know the
ASSU hasn't done its best job in being transparent
and reaching out to students ... A lot of people we
talked to don't even know what the ASSU is, and it's
really big for us to go out and hear people's concerns
and let them know how we are serving them.
SI): It's a perennial problem. But to be honest, it's
not a huge problem. It means that students are busy
with other things, to help make this campus better.
When people don't have to worry about how their
needs are being met — that means their needs are
being met. But there is always room for improve
ment.
TSD: How is your platform different from the other

The following slate is also o candidate for the ASSU Executive, but did not have an interview with The Daily.
REVOLUTION (RED DALY '09 AND JONATHAN RICH '10)

executive platforms?
SI): Broadly, it's supporting students and student
groups because that's why we are here ... Graduate
issues are really important to us, because we are
reaching out to a community that hasn't traditional
ly been reached out to. Old Union — we can get a
place that's not just a study place. Student groups
have a very tough time just trying to reserve space.
We want to make a universal reservation system.
These are the same ideas people are going to
hear throughout the campaign. But that points to a
good thing — that means that a lot of us are here for
the same reason: to make this place better. The fact
that that is the case is something that reflects really
well on the people that are here. The only way you
can distinguish people is how feasible their ideas
are, and if they have the leadership to make (their
ideas] possible.
