Engineering/Computer Science

Having been
involved with
the GSC for 4
years in a large
number of
roles, I intend
to continue my
work on the
major issues
facing graduate
students. Hous
ing availability
and cost issues,
the cost of liv
ing vs. RA/TA
salaries and

health care for children and spouses of grad stu
dents - which is not currently available. I am cur
rently the only representative of those who are
married and those who have children on the
GSC, but I was single when I got to Stanford, so
I have seen it from all sides and can ideally rep
resent all grad students.
