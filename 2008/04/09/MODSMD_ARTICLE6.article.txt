## Dirty campaign politics emerge Heated exchange erupts between two junior states 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A conflict between junior class
slates ITie Giving Tree and Ocean's
Oh Ten over campaign emails has
led to one of the most heated
exchanges between ASSU candi
dates in recent memory.
"Never in the history of Stanford
elections has there been such cold
politics," wrote Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10 in
an email to both slates and The Daily.
Woessner declined to revoke the
fair campaign status of either slate,
but thoroughly condemned their
actions.
"It is not against campaign poli
cies to send out negative messages
against another slate because it never
happens, at least not at this level,"
Woessner wrote. "What happens
between you two happens, but
involving the entire sophomore class
and student body is unacceptable."
The controversy began with a
newsletter sent by the current sopho

more class presidents to the Class of
2010 list on Mar. 5 entitled "What do
our Class Presidents Do?" The email
touted several of the group's past
accomplishments, and urged sopho
mores to come to the sophomore
showcase at the Cantor Arts
Museum.
The problem? The sophomore
class presidents are running for re
election under the same name —
The Giving Tree — with the addition
of newcomer Ronnie Tisdale '10.
"It was a newsletter," said
Cameron Drake 10, a member of
The Giving Tree. "It was fully
designed to give people an idea of
what had been going on from the
class presidents. We sent emails like
this every quarter. Ihis quarter was
no different."
The Giving TVee sent a similar
email to the class list on Apr. 3, but
this time, the sending of the email just
days before ASSU elections drew
increased scrutiny.
After seeing the Apr. 3 email,
Ocean's Oh-Ten filed an official com
plaint with the Elections
Commission, accusing The Giving
IYee of inappropriate campaigning.
Woessner denied Ocean Oh-Ten's
