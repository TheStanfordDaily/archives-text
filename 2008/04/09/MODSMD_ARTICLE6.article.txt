## Dirty campaign politics emerge Heated exchange erupts between two junior states 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A conflict between junior class
slates ITie Giving Tree and Ocean's
Oh Ten over campaign emails has
led to one of the most heated
exchanges between ASSU candi
dates in recent memory.
"Never in the history of Stanford
elections has there been such cold
politics," wrote Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10 in
an email to both slates and The Daily.
Woessner declined to revoke the
fair campaign status of either slate,
but thoroughly condemned their
actions.
"It is not against campaign poli
cies to send out negative messages
against another slate because it never
happens, at least not at this level,"
Woessner wrote. "What happens
between you two happens, but
involving the entire sophomore class
and student body is unacceptable."
The controversy began with a
newsletter sent by the current sopho

more class presidents to the Class of
2010 list on Mar. 5 entitled "What do
our Class Presidents Do?" The email
touted several of the group's past
accomplishments, and urged sopho
mores to come to the sophomore
showcase at the Cantor Arts
Museum.
The problem? The sophomore
class presidents are running for re
election under the same name —
The Giving Tree — with the addition
of newcomer Ronnie Tisdale '10.
"It was a newsletter," said
Cameron Drake 10, a member of
The Giving Tree. "It was fully
designed to give people an idea of
what had been going on from the
class presidents. We sent emails like
this every quarter. Ihis quarter was
no different."
The Giving TVee sent a similar
email to the class list on Apr. 3, but
this time, the sending of the email just
days before ASSU elections drew
increased scrutiny.
After seeing the Apr. 3 email,
Ocean's Oh-Ten filed an official com
plaint with the Elections
Commission, accusing The Giving
IYee of inappropriate campaigning.
Woessner denied Ocean Oh-Ten's

complaint.
It was just very strategic timing,"
Woesnner said of The Giving Tree's
email. "They weren't specifically
campaigning."
But Ocean's Oh-Ten wasn't satis
fied with Woessner's decision and
pursued the issue further.
"If you mention a slate name, it's
automatically campaigning." said
Jonathan Kass '10, a sitting ASSU
senator and member of the Ocean's
Oh-Ten slate.
Kass told The Daily that The
Giving Tree was essentially exploit
ing a loophole in the rules by running
with the same slate name they used
the year before, so that their newslet
ters would not violate fair election
policies.
Kass and his Ocean's Oh-Ten
slate subsequently worked out a
compromise with The Giving Tree
and Nanci Howe, student affairs
director in the Office of Student
Activities (OSA), to provide Ocean's
Oh-Ten with access to the Class of
2010 email list. Under the terms of
the deal, Ocean's Oh-Ten would have
their platform posted on the list.
But that is where the disagree
ments intensified.
"We didn't want to post to the
Class of TO list." Kass said. "But we
thought it was unfair for them [The
Giving Tree] to post to the list."
The main point of contention
between the two slates is the ques
tion of who was supposed to post the
Ocean's Oh-Ten platform. While
Ocean's Oh-Ten claims that under
the terms of the deal Nanci Howe
was supposed to post the email. The
Giving Tree, which eventually posted
the email, said that they were given
permission to do so by Howe.
"We were put under the impres
sion that the administrator would
email it out for us. with the proviso
that it would contain a statement say
ing that 'this could be done because
of the previous campaign violations
[by The Giving TVee],"' Kass said.
But The Giving Tree was not. and
has not been, convicted of any cam
paign violations, a fact that The
Giving Tree candidates repeated to
The Daily several times.
"The bottom line for us is that
that is not what we had agreed to, and
we wanted to share that with those
who were going to be reading the
email," added Ocean's Oh-Ten candi
date Anthony Bestafka-Cruz TO.
"We spoke with Nanci Howe and she
was to send it."
Ocean's Oh-Ten declined to pro
vide The Daily with any email corre
spondence confirming their commu
nications with Howe.
The Giving TYee told The Daily
that they did not want the email post
ed to the list by Howe, and that the

"You have all
severely
damaged
your images
on campus."
— RYAN WOESSNER,
Elections Commissioner

OSA administrator agreed with
them.
"They were under the impression
that they were going to have the
email sent from Nanei Howe," Drake
said. "Our slate objected to this,
because we didn't like the idea of
Nancy sending an email to our class
list — it would implicate impropriety
on our behalf."
Drake said that he confirmed with
Howe three times that it was alright
for The Giving Tree to send the
email.
"I wrote it, sent it to Nanci, and
she approved it," Drake said.
In an email to Howe, Drake
wrote, "Just so that we are clear I am
sending this email today correct?"
Howe replied, "Yes, I will send it
[the revised draft] to you shortly!"
After the email was sent out late
Monday night. Ocean's Oh-Ten can
didates and their supporters posted
responses to numerous campus email
lists Iliesday morning.
A statement sent to various email
lists by several Ocean's Oh-Ten sup
porters accused The Giving I'ree of
two campaign violations and
attacked The Giving Tree's email on
the class list Monday night.
"The Giving TVee's latest email
was not approved," said a statement
sent by Ocean's Oh-Ten supporters.
"This email was not them being gen
erous, but was a temporary solution
that was manipulated to suit the
needs of others."
The statement was accompanied
by a message from the Ocean's Oh-
Ten candidates themselves.
"As you know, the Giving TYce's

last email has placed the Ocean's Oh-
Ten slate in jeopardy by seeming to
be generous by offering to share our
platform with the sophomore com
munity," the candidates said.
"However, the truth is that the soph
omore class presidents have incurred
campaign violations that have
allowed them to manipulate their
standing and our standing in the
sophomore body."
These statements drew the full
wrath of The Giving Tree.
"They sent an email that made us
look like liars and cheaters, and their
intent was malicious," Drake said.
"We won't be satisfied until this is
heard by judicial affairs. We consider
this slander."
Tisdale told the Daily that he con
sidered the Ocean's Oh-Ten emails
personal attacks, and sent out an
email to several chat lists as a
response.
"What happened [TUesday] morn
ing was very disappointing to us."
Tisdale told llie Daily, "just because
it was more of a character attack on
us. Negative campaigning on this
campus is unprecedented. That kind
of negative campaigning is just
beneath us all."
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Woessner '10 weighed in on the bat
tle between The Giving Tree and
Ocean's Oh-Ten in an email to both
slates last night.
"No matter if you sent the first
email or just responded to one. you
all have severely damaged your
images on campus." Woessner wrote.
"There is really nothing you can do
about this at this point. Instead of
allowing the Elections Commission
to assess and deal with the situation,
you both went ahead and did your
own thing."
Woessner's words were not
received well by Tisdale and the
Giving Tree.
"I cannot disagree more." Tisdale
said."l know I personally did nothing
wrong. For that reason, 1 am a little
upset with Ryan. He's my age and
he's trying to sit me in a chair like a
little boy. and that's not who I am."
Woessner's decision not to revoke
either slate's fair campaign status
ensures that voters will ultimately be
the ones who decide how much
weight to attach to yesterday's hap
penings.
"As Elections Commissioner, I am
very disappointed in the way both
slates have performed today,"
Woessner told The Daily. "Both are
not telling the truth and as a result,
the electorate, 1 believe, will respond
properly."
