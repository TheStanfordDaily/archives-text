My name
is Sohan
Dha r •
m a r a j a,
I'm a first
year
Ph.D. stu-

dent in the iCME department. I haven't been at
Stanford long, but I can already spot things that
can make our vibrant student community even
better. Increasing participation in graduate
events is one primary goal of mine - making sure
we do this in a smart way - polling ideas and gath
ering feedback will be important. Also, having
been born and raised in South East Asia (I'm
from Sri Lanka) I believe I can help bridge the
gap that prevents some international students
from "jumping into" all the great things Stanford
has to offer.
