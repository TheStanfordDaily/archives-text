Engineering/Electrical

I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering.
Having lived on campus, I believe there is room
lor substantial improvement of graduate social
life. My improvement plans for GSC include:
1) Increasing the number of GSC sponsored
events beyond the few we have now and diversi
fying them such that they would be appealing to
all of the graduate community with different in
terests. 2) Increasing funding for student groups
so that they can provide students with more so
cial, educational and cultural events.
3) Reducing the current bureaucracy for funding
new events proposed by students despite an ex
isting surplus GSC budget so that students with
initiatives can take part in the planning of events.
