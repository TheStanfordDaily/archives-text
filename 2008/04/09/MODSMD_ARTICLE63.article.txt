I am running for
the GSC because I
value the GSC's

role in supporting
graduate students,

and I want to con

tinueto be a part of
that. This support
is present both
through social

events where stu
dents are able to
take a break and

meet others, and

also through GSC efforts towards good housing,
transportation and healthcare. Because the GSC
puts such effort into those areas, it reduces the in
dividual burden for students, which frees individ
uals to focus on other interests. 1 look forward to
working to make your experience as a graduate
student a positive one.
