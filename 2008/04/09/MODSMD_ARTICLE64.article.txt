I am running for the
C3SC because I am
committed to improv
ing quality of life for
graduate students by
raising awareness
about, obtaining feed
back on and improving
grad student social life,
affordable housing op-

lions, stipends and healthcare. I have experience
in academic and non-academic leadership posi
tions and am extremely persistent in achieving
my goals. I grew lip in Germany/Czech Republic
and have lived in the U.S. for the past seven
years; thus I can relate well to the concerns of
both American and International students.
