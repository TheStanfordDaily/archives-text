The GSC is sitting on a $650k+ reserve because it

consistently does not
spend the money col
lected from your stu
dent fees. I intend to
start the process of
bringing these re
serves down to $l(K)k
over six years by in
creasing program
ming and augmenting
graduate life initia
tives.
New programming in
cludes:

1) Increase social events on campus with more
large parties, weekly music, grad nights and par
ties in the GCC.
2) Augment student group activities by doubling
annual funding caps to $16k total or $50 per
member.
3) Fund collaborations between student groups
for large events that affect the whole graduate
community.
