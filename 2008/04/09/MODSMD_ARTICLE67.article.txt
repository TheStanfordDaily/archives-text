There are many things that are wrong with grad
uate student life at Stanford. 1 would like to serve
on the GSC to work with colleagues on fixing
some of these pressing issues. The most impor
tant thing is to be able to allocate funds for stu
dent activities promptly. Today it is a long and
difficult process

and it would drasti
cally improve grad
uate student life if
student groups
could secure funds
without all the has
sle one has to go
through today.
There should be
many more student
activities on cam
pus given the exor-

bitant fees all of us pay every year and 1 intend to
see to it if elected to the GSC.
