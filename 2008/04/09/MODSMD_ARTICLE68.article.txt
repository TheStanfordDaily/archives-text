Natural Sciences/Applied Physics
I have been an active member of the GSC for the
past two years as
programming coordinator in 2(XXi-2(K)7 and as
the Natural Science
representative in 2(X)7-2(X)8. Dependent health
care, on-campus housing availability and afford
able transportation for off-campus students are
three major issues facing Stanford graduate stu
dents today. I will focus on working with admin
istrators to find pragmatic solutions to these
problems that are economical for all students. I
am also interested in helping develop graduate
career mentorship programs. Finally, I would
like to increase financial support to student
groups that try to improve graduate diversity
through programming efforts.
