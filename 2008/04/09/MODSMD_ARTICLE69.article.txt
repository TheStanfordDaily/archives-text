David Gobaud '08 and Greg
Goldgof '08
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What sets you
apart from other candidates?
(irej> ((>(>): The other slates want to
convert Old Union into a social place, and we
want to convert it into a study place. We want
to turn Tresidder into a social place. ResEd

needs to move out of Tresidder; we'd like to
put a student lounge there. We actually have
social programming next year. There's a huge
discretionary fund for executives, and now no
one even knows about it.
David (>ohaud (!)(•): I've had over a thou
sand people using my GF.R treasure hunter. I
saw this need for finding GERs, and you can't
do it easily with the current system. It takes
me a couple hours to put this thing up. and
thousands of people have used it. We feel we
can do the same thing on a bigger scale. Peo
ple need a site that they can go to. The ASSU
site is useless right now. There's no reason to
go to it.
GG: We are co-terms, and we are the only
grad students running. Grad students are al
ways shafted. Social events for grads this year
were the mausoleum party and the block
party. The other platforms have the same line
as previous ones; they think the grad students
want to go to expanded undergrad events —
that's not true.
DC: I talked to administrators about my
graduate ideas, and they thought they were
great. ()nc of those is a graduate graduation.

We are talking about a graduate dinner on
the quad and a graduate formal in the eity.
For the 750 — ambience is horrible; very few
women come, because it's like a bar. We want
better music, food and good drinks.
TSI): So are you primarily a graduate student
slate?
!)(»: We are covering everyone. We not only
care about the undergrads, but also the grail
students.
TSI): Why have you been so specific with
your platform? A lot of the other slates have
been far more vague.
IXJ: We know what we want to get done.
(i<»: Every year people say things and don't
get them done, because there are no bench
marks.
IXi: I talked to Provost John Etchemendy,
VP for Student Affairs Chris Griffith, Direc
tor of Student Activities Nanci Howe, Chief
Housing Officer Rodger Whitney, Vaden Di
rector Ira Friedman and IT Director William
Clebsch. We've been working 24/7. We have
thoroughly researched everything on our
platform.
