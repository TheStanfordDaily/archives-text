The Stanford Daily (TSI)): Priyanka, you are
the ultimate A SSIJ insider. How ain you bring
change to an organization that you have spent so
much time within?
Priyanka Sharma (PS): I think being an insider
is crucial to bringing about change. An insider
can never do it alone, and that's why I think Jack
is so helpful. Myopic visions kill insiders. With
my technical know-how and Jack's big ideas,
and our joint thoughts together, we can bring

about the change that many can promise and
few can bring about.
TSI): Jack, you don't have any ASSU experi
ence, and are best known for your tree stunts.
Can we take somebody who ate a live snake se
riously?
Jack Cacklcr (JC): The focus of the campaign is
not my run for tree, but what we can do for the
University. I really wanted to make a difference
in Stanford my senior year... I went overboard
[in the tree campaign], I had a serious lack of
judgment. I understand the band's decision. But
when one door closes, the other opens. 1 saw this
as a great opportunity... It can be about subsi
dizing birth control, reopening the CoHo. I'm a
strong believer that there are many things you
can do in life to make a difference.
TSI): How does your platform differ from the
other executive platforms?
JC: Everyone else that is running is great. It's
going to come down to what the focus is on, and
how we can realistically achieve the promises we
are making.

PS: The key difference — ours might not be the
sexiest platform, hut it's the most realistic. We
are making promises we are 1 (X) percent sure we
can keep. There is not one sentence that we are
dubious about. One major part is student advo
cacy advisory board. This year as Senate Chair,
I noticed that ASSU does things for student
groups, but everyone hates us — we are lacking.
We are relegated to being an opinion generator.
That's not the way it should be. We should be
providing resources.
TSD: The ASSU is often very divided. You have
been endorsed by the Stanford Review; those
receiving this endorsement have traditionally
been at odds with SOCC-endorsed ASSU
members. How will you overcome division in
the ASSU?
JC: We want to reach out to everyone on cam
pus. We were endorsed by Review. They see us
as the most capable execs. Does that mean we
will work less closely with SOCC? No. We want
to reach out to people all over campus. This
would be an executive of the entire campus.
