Meghan McCurdy '09 and
Patrick Maher '09

The Stanford Daily (TSI)): Flow do
you draw inspiration from Mr.
Obama and his campaign?
Barrack Ohamma "08 (BO): I' ni not
sure you can draw inspiration from
Barack Obama. Wc couldn't tell you
what Barack Obama is right now.
Wc have a sense of it, but 1 couldn't
give you a dictionary definition.
When you see something, that's
Barack Obama.
TSI): What do you hope to accom
plish?

BO: We don't hope much. I guess
our slate would try to make Stanford
a little bit less of a giant tool shed.
TSI): What makes Stanford a giant
tool shed?
BO: ITie ASSU. It's more their fail
ures as people, not as a body. These
people are total dweebs, every last
one of them to a T.
TSI): Would you become total
dweebs if you became the ASSU Ex
ecutives?
BO: No, that's the whole purpose.
TSI): Who would you label as the
biggest dweeb in the ASSU?
BO: I m insulted you think we know
anyone in the ASSU by name. For
every name of a person on the
ASSU, that would be taking up the
place of the name of an obscure
band.
TSI): C 'an you name some of these
bands?
BO: Nice try â€” it's gonna take more
than that to save you guys.
TSI): So what are you going to do

about Old Union?
BO: I don't care about Old Union.
Let the dweebs overtake it. We are
more concerned about instituting
underground punk Fridays at
Memorial Church. If we can't get
MemChu, we'll book it at Old
Union.
TSI): What would you do to bring
the Lopez twins back for one more
year?
BO: They are going to be pro ath
letes. That's really cool. We encour
age them to leave and go to a much
cooler lifestyle before it's too late.
TSI): Can you make Stanford cool
again? I mean, if it was cool in the
first place.
BO: We don't holdout much hope of
being able to change Stanford. We
can make it cooler, but we probably
can't make it cool.
TSI): Did it used to be cool?
BO: I low the hell would 1 know?
Living in the past has always been
cool.
