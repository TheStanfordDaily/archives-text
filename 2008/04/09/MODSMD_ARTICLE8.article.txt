## Aid Director outlines personal budgets 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
With the February announcement of Stanford's
planned financial aid boost, many students are celebrat
ing their newfound windfall. But of the nearly $50,000
Stanford price tag, there is one cost no student can avoid
— personal expenses.
Included in Stanford's student budget is an allowance
for books, supplies and personal expenses. These items,
updated annually, are meant to guide students in their
budgeting as well as enable the Financial Aid Office to
ensure that all student costs can be covered.
Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper explained
that the books, supplies and personal expense estimates
come from the Student Expenses and Resources Survey
(SEARS). Stanford participates in the survey — which is
created by the California Student Aid Commission —
approximately every four years.
The Financial Aid Office set the 2008-2009 student
budget based on averages from SEARS data collected
last spring.
In the vears between data collection, these allowances

are increased by the Consumer Price Index. Cooper said
the allowances for books and personal expenses typical
ly rise between three and four percent each year.
Five percent of Stanford students, selected randomly
and including both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, are invited to participate in the online survey,
which features a typical response rate of about 37 per
cent, according to Cooper.
The survey asks students to estimate their costs for
housing, food, toiletries, household supplies, books, sup
plies, computers, medical services, childcare, clothing,
laundry, hair care, hobbies and transportation.
According to Cooper, the SEARS data revealed a
wide range of student spending at Stanford, although
most responses were near the average.
"There were always a few who said they spend next to
nothing, and there were always a couple who said they
spend more than I spend, and 1 have a full-time job," she
said. "But most of the students were clumped in the mid
dle — it was very much a bell curve."
The most recent survey, taken in spring 2007, was
"within a few dollars" of the Financial Aid Office's 2(X)6-
2007 budget amounts, she added.

"We were pretty pleased that it seemed to he coming
up with the right numbers," Cooper said.
With the new financial aid policy, parents earning less
than $60.(XH) will not have to contribute to student
expenses. Parents earning between $60,000 and $100,000
will contribute a maximum of $11,200 to their student's
cost of attendance, an amount that approximates the
costs of room and board. In both cases, students are typ
ically expected to contribute $4,500 toward their expens
es.
"1 tell parents it's not a mistake that the books and
personal expenses added together gets pretty close to the
$4,500 we're expecting from students," Cooper said. "It's
not at all unreasonable for parents to say to their student.
Okay, if you handle your personal expenses and books,
I'll handle your travel expenses and your room and
board, and the Financial Aid Office will handle the
tuition.'"
For all California students living on campus, the
California Student Aid Commission estimated that in the
2008-2009 academic year, books and supplies will total
$1,566 on average, while personal and miscellaneous
expenses came to $2,214. summing to $3,780 — the same

amount the University has budgeted for student books,
supplies and personal expenses.
Schools outside California also collect similar data for
this purpose. At Yale, where books and personal expense
allowances will total $3,000 in 2008-2009. a questionnaire
similar to SEARS is distributed to students to gauge stu
dent spending, according to Yale's Director of Financial
Aid Caesar Storlazzi.
"It's a hard number to come up with in the sense that,
depending on the courses you're taking, the costs for
books can be vastly different," Storlazzi said. "In some
science courses, a single book can be $200, but in an
