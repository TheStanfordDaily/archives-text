Senators at last nights ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting focused on the
new gender-neutral pilot program and the
approval of the Constitutional Amendment
Measure A.
Ihe gender-neutral rooming option will first
be offered in this spring's draw as part of the
pilot program. The option will he available in
Castano. Mirrielees, Rains, Terra and Narnia.
"The final result will be at the in-house draw
level," said Senator Jonathan Kass '10.
"Essentially, if people who make it into the
same dorm want to room together, they can in
those dorms, regardless of gender."
The five residences were chosen for the
pilot program on the basis of room structure.
The Gender Neutral Housing Committee
chose housing that featured suite-style rooms
or two-room doubles and also private lockable
bathrooms.
"We also picked these particular dorms
because of the historically different levels that
they draw at in the draw," Kass added. "We
wanted people who drew preferred and un
preferred to be able to take advantage of this. I
don't see any reason why this won't work out
perfectly unless romantic couples chose to take
advantage of the system, but I would urge them
not to."
The Senate also approved Measure A after
awaiting final comments from University
President John Hennessy. Measure A mandates
that any groups applying jointly for special fees
must receive both an undergraduate and grad
uate majority independently.
Measure A will be enforced for the first time
in this week's elections.
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08 also
informed the Senate of upcoming spring quar
ter events.
"We are already in the works of our Spring
Row Block Party," Avula said. "It is going to be
in the day time â€” an actual block party. We are
also working with Stanford Dining to have
food throughout the day."
