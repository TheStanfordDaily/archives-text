Attention Facehook Addicts! You now have a brand new way to
get your online fix — Facehook's new instant messaging fea
ture. Facehook Chat. Last Sunday. Facehook dehuted the pre
punch heta version of its instant messaging feature at Stan
ford. in addition to a handful of other schools including UC-
Berkeley, Harvard. Yale. Dartmouth, U- Chicago, MIT, and Brown.
"We'll he rolling this out slowly going forward." Josh Wiseman, a Face
hook Engineering Lead, wrote on Facehook's hlog. "Chat is hy no means
a new concept, as instant-messaging systems have heen around for over a
decade, but just as other features on Facehook have allowed friends to
communicate more efficiently than before, we hope Facehook Chat will
make it easier to connect instantly."
With its national headquarters within walking distance of Stanford in
Palo Alto, Facehook has opted to gradually introduce its new built-in IM
feature rather than facilitate a large-scale release.The company will even
tually make Facehook Chat available to all of its more than 69 million
members.
According to one Stanford student, the move may prove to detract
from the appeal of Facehook for non-instant messengers.

"Aww, Facebook is growing
up," said Drew Padley '10, an In
ternational Relations major. "It's i
cute, even though I don't really /

Until now, wall posts and pri- |
vate messages have been the pri- I
mary ways to communicate on I
Facebook, but when more urgent \
communication is necessary, '
Facebook Chat will soon come to
the rescue. The new feature great
ly expands on the existing messag
ing system, which was more like
email in format and structure.

Reading your email."

Facebook Chat may actually prove to
be an improvement from the current abun
dance of instant messaging services such as AIM. Google
Talk. Yahoo Messenger, and MSN Messenger.The new feature is unusual
ly convenient for current Facebookers, in that users can utilize their pre
existing list of Facebook friends rather than having to assemble a com
pletely new "buddy list" for instant chat as other services require.
Facebook has had quite some time to contemplate improvements to ex
isting systems, since Facebook Chat's entry into the instant messenger
arena is actually quite late — Myspace debuted IM in 2006.
Facebook, which is the number-two social network in the world behind
MySpace's 111 million members, has become a regular part of college so
cial life — and students expect this new chat feature to further push the
limits of wasting time.
"I think [Facebook Chat) is great," said Damola Adamolekun.a fresh
man studying business economics at Brown University. "It will most likely
replace AIM and it's much better because all your friends have it and you
don't have to get their screen names.
"The downside is people are going to be even more addicted to Face
book than before!" he added.
Facebook was founded in 2004 and has grown to a recent $15 billion
valuation thanks to Microsoft's 1.6% investment. From a business per
spective, Facebook Chat will likely be yet another success for Mark
