Attention Facehook Addicts! You now have a brand new way to
get your online fix — Facehook's new instant messaging fea
ture. Facehook Chat. Last Sunday. Facehook dehuted the pre
punch heta version of its instant messaging feature at Stan
ford. in addition to a handful of other schools including UC-
Berkeley, Harvard. Yale. Dartmouth, U- Chicago, MIT, and Brown.
"We'll he rolling this out slowly going forward." Josh Wiseman, a Face
hook Engineering Lead, wrote on Facehook's hlog. "Chat is hy no means
a new concept, as instant-messaging systems have heen around for over a
decade, but just as other features on Facehook have allowed friends to
communicate more efficiently than before, we hope Facehook Chat will
make it easier to connect instantly."
With its national headquarters within walking distance of Stanford in
Palo Alto, Facehook has opted to gradually introduce its new built-in IM
feature rather than facilitate a large-scale release.The company will even
tually make Facehook Chat available to all of its more than 69 million
members.
According to one Stanford student, the move may prove to detract
from the appeal of Facehook for non-instant messengers.

"Aww, Facebook is growing
up," said Drew Padley '10, an In
ternational Relations major. "It's i
cute, even though I don't really /
IM I
Until now, wall posts and pri- |
vate messages have been the pri- I
mary ways to communicate on I
Facebook, but when more urgent \
communication is necessary, '
Facebook Chat will soon come to
the rescue. The new feature great
ly expands on the existing messag
ing system, which was more like
email in format and structure.

Reading your email."

Facebook Chat may actually prove to
be an improvement from the current abun
dance of instant messaging services such as AIM. Google
Talk. Yahoo Messenger, and MSN Messenger.The new feature is unusual
ly convenient for current Facebookers, in that users can utilize their pre
existing list of Facebook friends rather than having to assemble a com
pletely new "buddy list" for instant chat as other services require.
Facebook has had quite some time to contemplate improvements to ex
isting systems, since Facebook Chat's entry into the instant messenger
arena is actually quite late — Myspace debuted IM in 2006.
Facebook, which is the number-two social network in the world behind
MySpace's 111 million members, has become a regular part of college so
cial life — and students expect this new chat feature to further push the
limits of wasting time.
"I think [Facebook Chat) is great," said Damola Adamolekun.a fresh
man studying business economics at Brown University. "It will most likely
replace AIM and it's much better because all your friends have it and you
don't have to get their screen names.
"The downside is people are going to be even more addicted to Face
book than before!" he added.
Facebook was founded in 2004 and has grown to a recent $15 billion
valuation thanks to Microsoft's 1.6% investment. From a business per
spective, Facebook Chat will likely be yet another success for Mark
Zuckerberg and Co. — while Face
book Chat might not be a driving
force for new membership or con
verted membership from other so
cial networks, it will boost crucial
user engagement numbers.
User engagement is essentially
what defines us "Facebook Addicts."
More importantly, it also defines how
much advertisers pay Facebook be
cause more user engagement means
more user time on the site, which
means more clicks for advertisers.
In its current pre-launch beta
form, Facebook Chat is located in
the bottom right of any Facebook
page and allows users to click an
"Online Friends" button to chat and
view which friends are online, of
fline, or idle for chat. Next in line, to
the right of the "Online Friends" but
ton, are two smaller buttons — one
shows Facebook notifications and
the second allows users to view and
change chat preferences.
In an unprecedented move. Face
book Chat is the first official chat or
IM feature that will automatically
appear on all profiles. As with other
Facebook feature debuts. Facebook
Chat also brings with it legitimate
privacy concerns and challenges.
For instance, in the beta version,

there is no way to block another user
from chat. Another issue surrounds
the fact that Facebook Chat current
ly cannot be totally removed.The in
trinsic nature of the instant chat fea-

ture to show who is
online, offline and
idle may also bother
some users as well,
especially since
many Facebook
users are not actu
ally friends with all
their Facebook

friends.
"[Facebook

Chat] is really
convenient,"
said econom
ics student
Mike Guir
guis "11. "It
combines a so
cial network
with your
email and
your instant

message so

you only have to

focus on one social

program at once."
Those concerned about privacy
shouldn't sound the alarm or throw
up the white flag just yet — Face
book Chat is still in beta and many
changes can be expected before a
large-scale launch, including a possi
ble revamping of privacy controls.

Regardless, Facebook addicts can
be almost certain that with a new 1M
feature on the way and membership
rising by the millions, this may very
well be the end of productive time on
the computer as we know it.
