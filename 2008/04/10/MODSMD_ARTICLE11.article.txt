# Sophomore Showcase
## 
### SALMAN RAZZAQUE 
On a Thursday night at the end of last quarter, scores of guests, some
with no artistic background, attempted to sculpt their own masterpieces
with clay. Others tried their luck with traditional paper and paint, or
made no attempt at artistry and simply mingled with other guests.
There was something unusual about the scene inside Cantor Arts
Center — the anticipation of the crowd was not due to the unveiling of
a new Rodin sculpture or Homer Grant painting, but because of the
Cantor Arts Sophomore Showcase.
"This event is a collaboration between the Sophomore Class presi
dents and Cantor Arts Center that came about because of a common
goal shared by both groups to allow great artwork to be seen," wrote
Sophomore Class Co-President Durell Coleman 10 in an email to The
Daily.
As the crowd filtered into the auditorium, there were a myriad of di
verse works of art displayed — everything from painting and drawing to
digital art and recorded music.
One of the artists, Sarah MacwayiO, submitted a series of five paint
ings depicting the beauty of nature.
"The paintings are all based on photographs I've taken of landscape
from Northern California," Macway wrote in an email to The Daily.
"They show my painting style and my love of nature."
She described the process of creating her works as traditional.
"I began by painting a bright colorful background, then covering it
with small strokes of all sorts of colors to create an illusion of texture.
color and shape," Macway said.
It was student artists like
Macway who prompted Coleman to
organize the event.
"When [my slate] ran for this posi
tion, we asked sophomores to name
some things that they wished their
Stanford experience included,"
Coleman said. "One of the things
that we were told was that artists

would like the opportunity to dis
play their work."
For the next hour and half, the
crowd witnessed this display of the
diverse and highly developed artis
tic talents of the sophomore class.
Coleman pointed out that the
works submitted were of such high
quality that every single submission
was displayed at the showcase.
"We did not need a panel to
judge which pieces would be accept
ed," Coleman said. "All of the work
that was submitted was so well done
that every artist will have his or her
work shown."

As the event came to a close, the
crowd moved out of the auditorium
with the same excitement they
might have felt after observing a
Rodin sculpture or Grant painting.
"I thought the art work was all
very well done and the program was
very well organized and successful,"
said Dariusz Wodziak '11.
As the crowd exited the muse
um, several guests left behind their
sculptures — a fitting symbol of the
inclusive nature of the showcase.
