# Sophomore Showcase
## 
### SALMAN RAZZAQUE 
On a Thursday night at the end of last quarter, scores of guests, some
with no artistic background, attempted to sculpt their own masterpieces
with clay. Others tried their luck with traditional paper and paint, or
made no attempt at artistry and simply mingled with other guests.
There was something unusual about the scene inside Cantor Arts
Center — the anticipation of the crowd was not due to the unveiling of
a new Rodin sculpture or Homer Grant painting, but because of the
Cantor Arts Sophomore Showcase.
"This event is a collaboration between the Sophomore Class presi
dents and Cantor Arts Center that came about because of a common
goal shared by both groups to allow great artwork to be seen," wrote
Sophomore Class Co-President Durell Coleman 10 in an email to The
Daily.
As the crowd filtered into the auditorium, there were a myriad of di
verse works of art displayed — everything from painting and drawing to
digital art and recorded music.
One of the artists, Sarah MacwayiO, submitted a series of five paint
ings depicting the beauty of nature.
"The paintings are all based on photographs I've taken of landscape
from Northern California," Macway wrote in an email to The Daily.
"They show my painting style and my love of nature."
She described the process of creating her works as traditional.
"I began by painting a bright colorful background, then covering it
with small strokes of all sorts of colors to create an illusion of texture.
