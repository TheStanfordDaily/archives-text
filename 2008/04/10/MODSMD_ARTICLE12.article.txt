## Students wary of weapons jobs Iraq war, ethics leave many engineers conflicted 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
With the Iraq war in its fifth year,
technological developments have
been key to American military strat
egy. But while many engineering
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents express a distaste for direct
involvement in weapons design,
development of technologies with
joint civilian and military applica
tions seems much more palatable.
According to Electrical
Engineering graduate student
Siddhartha Kasivajhula, the overlap
in civilian and military technology is
staggering enough that many engi
neering students cannot effectively
draw the line.
"For example, 1 could be involved
with a project involved with the
design of more efficient solar panels
for satellites," Kasivajhula said, "but
weapons guidance satellites will ulti
mately end up using solar cell tech
nology used by commercial satellites.
Technology in one context can easily
translate to another."
Stanford engineering undergrad
uates. especially those involved in

research, highlighted how the
defense industry allows commercial
technology to flourish because of its
funding. While some were opposed
to participating directly in weapons
design, they noted that commercial
technologies often started out as a
military technology.
"You never know when military
research will become mainstream,"
said Mechanical Engineering stu
dent Sunthar Premakumar '08. "The
Internet started out as some army
project, and look at how important it
is now."
Other undergraduates were
more focused on the importance of
defense funding at the University
level. Students like John Laxson
'10, an undeclared undergraduate
thinking about majoring in
Materials Science and Engineering,
noted that war has historically
accelerated the pace of technologi
cal development.
"1 don't see anybody avoiding it."
Laxson said. "Wars have a long his
tory of promoting innovation in
technological fields. In that sense
they are very well-funded, and often
in a position to make improvements
in our lives."
Others like Mechanical
Engineering student Lewis Horn '10
noted that Stanford is heavily sup
ported by funding from defense

related projects for the government,
and that many labs would he severe
ly hindered without such funding.
"In the lab I am working in, some
things are actually funded by the
Department of Defense," Horn said,
"but generally, 1 enjoy that my
research focus has attention and
generally don't think of them as
being ethically bad."
Horn said that the good attributes
of defense research may outweigh
the potentially negative attributes.
He cited the DARPA challenge as a
project entirely funded by the mili
tary that could ultimately go toward
the development of self-navigating
vehicles.
Though many students pursue
research projects supported by the
Department of Defense, the war has
not enhanced student interest in
defense. Several Stanford professors
found themselves unable to see any
particular trends in students pursu
ing defense-related jobs or intern
ships.
"Unfortunately this is something
that 1 know nothing about," said
Electrical Engineering Assistant
Professor Shanhui Fan. "None of my
graduated students went into
defense industry"
