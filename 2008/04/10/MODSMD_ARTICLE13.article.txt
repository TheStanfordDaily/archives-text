## Editorial Board What admission stats tell us and what they don't 
### 
Unsurprisingly, this year Stanford was
once again inundated with a record
number of applicants — more than
twenty-five thousand — and once again ad
mitted a record low of 9.5 percent. As news
articles from both Ihe Daily and the Stan
ford Report reiterate. 2(X)8 was a "record
setting" year for Stanford admissions. But,
instead of placing such emphasis on shatter
ing records and ranking, we as a student
body should take the time to appreciate the
incredible opportunity we've been given.
Does it really make us better people to
walk into a classroom knowing that Stanford
became half a percent harder to get into this
year? Does rejecting a few thousand more ap
plicants make us a better university? Consid
ering the fact,oft-stated by admissions officers,
that the incoming class could be filled many
times over with equally impressive individuals,
it's doubtful that we're gaining much tangible
benefit, other than a better position in the U.S.
News & World Report rankings, by becoming
marginally more selective.
Nor are these just "applicants" — abstract
collections of SAT scores and essays — these
are the growing number of our close friends
and siblings who must handle nearly inevitable
rejection. No doubt many of us had to comfort
tearful high school friends, and perhaps even
suppress the urge to kick Montag Hall after
the admissions department within failed to ac
cept someone so obviously perfect for the
Farm.
While these occurrences are often emo
tionally trying, they are unlikely to change.
Clearly. Stanford cannot admit everyone who
applies, no matter how qualified. Even if the
class size is expanded as recently proposed by
President John Ilennessy, thousands of quali
fied students be rejected. Nor would admitting
everyone who applies and wishes to come here
improve the quality of education.
What we can do. however, is be thankful for
the opportunity we have been given, and es
chew the occasional competitive and elitist no
tion.
For instance, one individual commented
online in response to an Oct. 11 Daily article
announcing Hennessy's desire to explore an
expansion of the freshman class. "Unfortu
nately. President Hennessy appears to view
Stanford admission as something to be handed

out from a cheap goody bag to as many 'quali
fied' people as possible ... President Hen
nessy. let me tell you what 'qualified' means. It
doesn't mean having a minimum score or
CiPA. It means being among a very small per
centage of the absolute best all-around appli
cants (in terms of scores, grades, accomplish
ments, etc) from a given pool of applicants, re
gardless of whether that applicant pool is more
competitive than previous years."
Another student submitted a Jan. 31 Op-
Ed to The Daily, mentioning Stanford ranking
"a dismal 19th in the latest Times of London
Higher Education Supplement." and lament
ing, "although Stanford was once ranked first
in the U.S. News rankings for a couple of years
in the 1980s, we have since lost that spot to
1 larvard. Princeton or Yale — and we haven't
been ranked in the top three in quite some
time."
Attitudes such as these, while not universal
ly held, are what we must fight against. Stan
ford students should be ever cognizant that for
the vast majority of us, our spot could have
gone to any number of other qualified appli
cants. On Mar. 30,2007, immediately prior to
sending out admission decisions to the class of
2011. Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw
wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles
Times, citing "many exceptional youths who
did not get offered one of the 1,650 slots in the
class of 2011," and describing the process as "as
much an art as it is a science."To believe that
we are somehow better and more qualified
than our peers who are not offered admission
is arrogant, incorrect and unproductive. The
emphasis on ever-lower acceptance rates and
the belief that arbitrary rankings say much of
anything about the quality of our institution
are similarly corrosive.
We are all privileged to attend an incredible
university, and we should never lose sight of
that fact. Everybody should be proud of his or
her accomplishments and proud of Stanford
— but record-setting selectivity should not
play a factor in that pride. Let us all remember
our equally accomplished friends and peers
who were not offered admission to Stanford,
and strive to fully embrace the opportunities
that we have been given in life. Stanford stu
dents have a long record of achievement and
giving back to the community, and that is the
record of which we should be proud.
