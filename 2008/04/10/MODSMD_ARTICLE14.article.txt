## A 						seat of my own 
### 
On the bus in Santiago, I've pretty much
resigned myself to never having a seat.
Crowds often eliminate the option en
tirely and the surrounding culture of courte
ousness creates an immense pressure for
young men like myself to stand. Santia
go's public transportation system is relatively
modern and effective. All fares, for example,
are paid by using an electronic card which pas
sengers charge ahead of time.The moderniza
tion, completed relatively recently, was need
ed to accommodate the huge number of peo
ple dependent on public transport. When the
bus is crowded, which is guaranteed during
three-hour chunks of the morning and
Evening rush hours, simply getting on is a re
lief. It is impressive how many people can fit
into a seemingly full bus but you can never be
quite sure when the driver will decide to close
the door.
Getting off a crowded bus is also a bit
tricky involving a wriggling movement to the
door with lots of body to body contact. It's not
(hat anyone refuses to help you get through,
rt's that sometimes there is just no space. Re
peating "permiso" tends to minimize any awk
wardness, but it still feels like bodychecking
people in slow motion.
More embarrassingly, it is all I can do not to
fall into other people when I ride at rush hour.
The traffic means lots of jolting stops and
starts: motorists tend to use buses like running
backs use offensive linemen, following closely
behind and then darting out when they see an
opening. When this results in a close call, it is
usually the bus that has to slam on the brakes.
Disoriented gringo that I am, I tend to have
a white-knuckled grasp of the railing when I
least need it, and have relaxed or started to
reposition myself exactly when another car
makes its move, or when we hit a roundabout
or sharp corner.
Yesterday morning. I stumbled into and
nearly destroyed the model building in the
hands of an architecture student who had the
misfortune of standing next to me. She had a
nose ring, large drawing pads in a tote at her
feet, was carefully holding her scale model
with both hands. Luckily, my elbow glanced
off the top of the building without damage.
Even more luckily, I was getting off at the next
stop.
But even when it isn't rush hour. I am at the
bottom of an unspoken hierarchy of seating

priority. At the top are the very old of both
sexes, as well as pregnant women or those rid
ing with small children. This is true in most
places,even the United States, but here, the re
action is immediate. When those in this cate
gory board a bus. there is a wave of offers to
provide a seat. Generally, men in their thirties
or early forties are fastest, but others stand as
well.
Once, a woman carrying an infant, a tod
dler and a stroller boarded my bus. Within
about ten seconds and with few words spoken,
she was not only provided with a row to her
self, but someone else in the standing section
four rows back was holding the stroller for
her.
Women above about forty are next in the
pyramid, followed by all women above twen
ty-four. The reaction is slower and less univer
sal. but there is usually at least one would-be
chauvinist (I use the term positively). "I like
watching when people give up their seats," a
female Stanford friend told me. "I think it's
cute." When an older woman boards and no
offers are made, you can feel all of the eyes in
the bus move to look for the selfish person
who should be yielding. Usually it is a student
in high school, identifiable by the Ã¼biquitous
uniforms, and usually, the power of the stares
is enough to provoke a tardy offer. Young men
and students are at the bottom of the ranking.
I have, without even being prompted by
stares, offered my seat to others on several
occasions. There is a certain warm feeling
from doing this, and it made me feel more
culturally assimilated than I could possibly
really be after a few weeks. But bending to
peer pressure, I've gravitated toward the pre
emptive approach: standing the whole time.
Most guys my age never even bother to sit,
presumably because they would need to
yield sooner or later, and I want to look as
cool as they do. Unfortunately, part of that in-

volves not holding onto anything,
and as I've mentioned, I'm not quite
there yet.
I like the unspoken seating code,
but not everything about public
transportation is courteous. Another
female friend has several times been
anonymously pinched in a way that
would provoke fights and lawsuits
back home.
1 am usually the first to offer her a
seat.
