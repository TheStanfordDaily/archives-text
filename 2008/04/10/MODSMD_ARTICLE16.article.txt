## If only life were like the Internet 
### 
You swear someone you know looks ex
actly like Tim Robbins. Your friend
bets you the lyrics to "Rent" never
mention diapers. It is in imperative circum
stances like these that 1 find myself yearning
for instantaneous access to the internet.
(And of course I am referring to the Ethernet
variety, not three-legged-dog-pathetic DSL,
cable, or dare I even mention it, dial-up. If
you have dial-up, I'll go slip into my polyester
bell-bottoms, get my phonograph out, and
mix us a virgin martini, since Prohibition just
started.) Except those pitiable dial-up out
liers, the rest of us are in 21X)7, the Technolo
gy Age, as it has so been so deemed by the
age-deemers. The Internet, so the Internet
tells me. has revolutionized and transformed
our lives. I have a feeling when I tell my kids
about the time my family got the Internet, it
will seem equally unbelievable as my par
ents' tale of finally getting a TV. 'Getting
DSL' will be the 'understanding-the-Wizard
of-Oz-because-you-finally-upgraded-to-a-
color-tv' of our generation. I'm addicted to
high-speed Internet, in all of its celebrated
convenience, innovation and helpfulness.
The net is so accommodating, in fact, that I
often wish it worked outsides its square

metal and plastic confines.
If only life were more like the Internet, I
would always say the perfect thing. If, per
chance, during an emotional break-up I were
to word-vomit-up, "I think I can do better,"
bitter, hurt feelings would not necessarily fol
low. Instead. I would be offered, misspelled-
Google-search-style,"Did you mean:'we are
too different?'" I could then gladly accept the
correction and link back into reality. If I
stammer out, "Yes, I'm free then. Free as a
bird. Whenever you want to hang out, I have
no plans. I'd love to hang out, Friday. Or Sat
urday, if that works better. Both? Or just one,
too." Suddenly, that helpful dialog box pops
up,"Did you mean: Yeah?" You would never
call somebody by the wrong name, Freudian
slip, or regret what you said ever again.

Not only would all awkward interactions
he fixed, hut the awkwardest of all situations,
dating, would he revolutionized. After I date
one guy, the computer would contambulate
and record the adjectives that describe him.
It would then he able to suggest other single
men based on its understanding of my gener
al man-tastes. If Good Sense of Humor is
taken, I will know that "Women who dated
Good Sense also dated: Dimples, Fauxhawk
and Sincere Guy." Of course it would be able
to check Facebook profiles for dating status
and sexual orientation.
Convenience wise, having the Internet in
life would mean 1 would never get lost. In
fact, there would be no possible way to get
lost, since there would always be a red line
connecting me to my destination, and a red,
floating triangle above the three restaurants
in my price range at my point of destination.
Also, I would be able to grab the air with my
hand and see the close-up and long shots of
my route. With just using fistfuls of the Heav
ens, I could plan my California road trip, map
out a jog and find out where Kazakhstan re
ally is. I like.

Similarly timely would be the ca
pacity for the life-Internet to pre
emptively recall all the things I do a
lot. Just as Mozilla already remem
bers my friend's email addresses
with the stroke of one, two keys max,
this recall would apply to everything
as well. As I am getting myself a salad
and reach for the parmesan cheese,
bwammo! my plate is instantly filled
with a perfectly tossed Caesar. If I
had reached for the candied walnuts
instead of the parm,the life-Internet
would have known I was making my

usual fruit and nut salad and com
plete that salad algorithm instead.
You could use this feature, too, when
you can only remember the begin
ning of a story or the opening to a
joke â€” the rest is just conveniently
filled into your brain. You'd never be
a bad joke-teller again.
I could save a lot on gas, thus also
helping save the world, too, if all my
favorite places were located right
next to one another on my life tool
bar. I need to go to Safeway, get
some brew-dawgs, work on my fit
ness and then wish my mom a happy
mother's day? Luckily, Safeway is
right next to Ernie's, which is conve
niently located next to the Stanford
gym and, fortunately, is neighbors
with my house in Sacramento. If I

start becoming a regular customer at
the Nuthouse, that's fine, I can drag
it in between the gym and the gro
cery store.
And this is just the start. If life
were like the Internet, you would al
ways have perfect spelling, grammar
and pronunciation. Financially,
every purchase would be automati
cally compared against every similar
product, constantly supplying you
with the best buy. You could also
know all the lyrics to every song on
the radio. I would also be able to
track the passing of the time in my
room because the sky would turn
darker as night neared...
