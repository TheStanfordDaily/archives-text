## The
						complexities of instant-runoff voting 
### 
For those who have not voted before or
do not remember how it works, the
ASSU executive race has a complex
voting system, called instant-runoff voting.
Each voter is allowed to rank all of the slates
from first to last. When the votes are tallied
up, only the first choices of voters are count
ed. The slate that receives the lowest vote is
eliminated. This process goes on until one
slate has won a majority of votes.This process
is perhaps more democratic than conven
tional voting, because in an election with
five-plus candidates, voters usually like vari
ous platforms and more than one slate.
When an executive candidate asks you to
"vote for me," what they are actually asking is
"rank me highest." Voting for one slate does
not necessarily preclude voting for others at
all — indeed, most executive slates should
encourage you to vote for other slates as well.
A number of unprecedented occurrences

have made this particular election revolution
ary in many ways — to name two, SOCC has
not endorsed an executive slate, and there are
more competitive executive slates than ever
before. The combination of these events has
led the elections landscape in a variety of new
and interesting directions. Because there are
so many strong slates, voters should feel com
fortable voting for more than one slate, as it is
extremely unlikely that one slate will get 50%
in such a contested field. The slate that does
end up the winner after multiple rounds of
voting will be more legitimate as a result be
cause more voters will have voted for that
slate, even if it wasn't their first choice.
This is one of the reasons why the 2008
Elections Commission has tried so hard to
encourage voting by simultaneously provid
ing new mediums to encourage personal in
teraction between candidates and the stu
dent body (ie. Rock the Vote, Executive De

hate), as well as stressing voiced platforms in
stead of just fliers (not to mention leaving
bathrooms free of campaign material).
The instant-runoff voting system allows
for a scenario where no one gets to see their
first choice slate enter office, hut everyone
gets to see their second choice slate enter of
fice, an elections outcome that could happen
this year for the first time.
fhus, we encourage students to vote not
just for their favorite slate, hut also for their
second, third, and fourth favorite slates. It
gives us options and fuels a more representa
tive democracy that we have tried to envision
here at Stanford.
