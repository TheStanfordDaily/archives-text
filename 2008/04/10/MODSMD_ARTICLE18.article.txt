A contrast of three election
posters
To the editor.
As I used my dorm's bathroom this
week, three ASSU campaign posters
jumped out at me; one good, one bad,
and one ugly. In reverse order: one
poster for a senatorial candidate was
nothing more than the candidate's
name, a lame attempt at rhyming that
name with an animal, and an absurd pic
ture of the candidate in front of Mem-
Chu in what I can only hope was a par
ody. A second attempt, this time from a
group of potential class presidents,
punned their graduation year with a re
cent popular movie. It combined expert

Photoshop work with three campaign
platitudes so vague they were impossi
ble to disagree with. Arid finally, a re
turning ASSU senator's poster: clean
and simple, it offered a smiling picture
of the candidate, three proposed initia
tives, three qualifications for the job and
(lo and behold) his phone number, in
order to register suggestions. Concise
and specific, it sold me in a heartbeat. I
recognize that running a campaign is
difficult when so much of the campus
remain strangers, but 1 urge the candi
dates to run campaigns based on ideas
and policies, rather than on clever word
play and pop culture references.
