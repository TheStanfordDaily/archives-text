## GSC approves change to officer term limits 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
The successors of both the ASSU
President and Vice President will have
to take the helm sooner than expected
this year, due to a bill passed with a two
thirds majority vote at the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) meeting last
night. The bill amends the Joint
Association Bylaws governing the
duration of the ASSU executive term
in office.
Ihis bill changes the language of
the Association Policies, stating that
the term of the ASSU President and
Vice President shall end two weeks
after voting in the ASSU election
concludes. According to the bill, the
new successors will take office imme
diately thereafter.
The ASSU Constitution previous
ly stated that the terms of the
President and Vice President of the
student body were meant to end 14
days before the end of the spring
quarter, after the new elected execu
tives took office.
"According to the existing consti
tution. unless there is an amendment
to the Joint Bylaws of the ASSU, we
would be serving for a year and a
quarter," said Mondaire Jones '09,
student body vice president. "We
don't think that is a prudent thing to
do."
But according to Jones, even after
their terms end, both he and student
body President Hershey Avula '08
have agreed to make themselves
available for the incoming executives
in order to facilitate a smooth transi

tion to office.
"We do think it is important that
[the elected executives] transition
officially into their role, so that they
can become accustomed to the posi
tion "Jones said. "This [bill] will allow
a more adequate and substantive
transition period."
Jones also added that the elected
executives will have orientation
meetings organized by the ASSU
during these two weeks.
"I think it is particularly important
that there is a smooth transition this
year, because there are many execu
tive slates without ASSU experience,"
he added.
The bill was co-sponsored by
both GSC Parliamentarian Adam
Beberg and Undergraduate
Senator Corinne Prudhomme '10,
chair of the Undergraduate
Senate Administration and Rules
Committee. The newly enacted
bill, requiring a two-thirds joint
legislative body vote, had also
passed at the Undergraduate
Senate the night before.
