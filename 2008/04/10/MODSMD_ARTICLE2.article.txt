## Trent Johnson reportedly leaving Stanford for LSU 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
After four years on the Farm, Trent
Johnson has agreed in principle to an offer
to become the next head basketball coach at
LSU. according to multiple sources close to
the situation. An official announcement
could come as early as Thursday.
Johnson, the Pac-10 Conference Coach
of the Year, attended the annual men's bas
ketball team banquet Wednesday evening
and was expected to take a redeye flight to
Louisiana afterward. He has not yet signed a
contract, but is expected to sign a fia-year
deal Thursday reportedly worth $1 million
to $1.2 million annually.
In doing so, he will finally accept an offer
he had turned down multiple times in recent
days, according to a source close to Johnson
and the program. A contract extension from
Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby,
rumored to be in the works for months, was
finally offered earlier this week, for about
half the length of the five-year deal Johnson
wanted.
"I think it came down to he was not want
ed," the source said. "When you get a feeling
of not being wanted, no matter how much
you love your company or your job, if your
boss doesn't love you. that's not a good
place to be in."
Bv all accounts. Johnson had no desire to

leave Stanford. Players said the banquet was
mostly normal, but Johnson choked up after
receiving a standing ovation while thanking
his team for letting him be a part of their
lives.
Reached by email Wednesday afternoon
while returning from the women's national
championship basketball game, Bowlsby
said he was not aware that Johnson had
accepted another position.
"LSU notified me this morning while we
were on the way to the airport in Tampa that
they wanted to talk to Trent," the athletic
director said. "The position probably pays
twice what he makes at Stanford, so I guess
he feels he has to listen."
Bowlsby could not be reached for further
comment Wednesday evening. According to
the source, he wanted to meet with Johnson
Wednesday night, though the source cau
tioned, "it would take someone else than
Bob Bowlsby getting involved" to work out
a 23rd-hour deal.
Johnson's logical replacement would
have been former Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who returned last fall in a
part-time position in the athletic department
as an assistant to Bowlsby. Montgomery,
however, was hired just last Friday as head
coach at Cal, and issued a statement yester
day to the Oakland Tribune reaffirming his
desire to fulfill his new role.
