## Trent Johnson reportedly leaving Stanford for LSU 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD DANIEL NOVINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
After four years on the Farm, Trent
Johnson has agreed in principle to an offer
to become the next head basketball coach at
LSU. according to multiple sources close to
the situation. An official announcement
could come as early as Thursday.
Johnson, the Pac-10 Conference Coach
of the Year, attended the annual men's bas
ketball team banquet Wednesday evening
and was expected to take a redeye flight to
Louisiana afterward. He has not yet signed a
contract, but is expected to sign a fia-year
deal Thursday reportedly worth $1 million
to $1.2 million annually.
In doing so, he will finally accept an offer
he had turned down multiple times in recent
days, according to a source close to Johnson
and the program. A contract extension from
Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby,
rumored to be in the works for months, was
finally offered earlier this week, for about
half the length of the five-year deal Johnson
wanted.
"I think it came down to he was not want
ed," the source said. "When you get a feeling
of not being wanted, no matter how much
you love your company or your job, if your
boss doesn't love you. that's not a good
place to be in."
Bv all accounts. Johnson had no desire to

leave Stanford. Players said the banquet was
mostly normal, but Johnson choked up after
receiving a standing ovation while thanking
his team for letting him be a part of their
lives.
Reached by email Wednesday afternoon
while returning from the women's national
championship basketball game, Bowlsby
said he was not aware that Johnson had
accepted another position.
"LSU notified me this morning while we
were on the way to the airport in Tampa that
they wanted to talk to Trent," the athletic
director said. "The position probably pays
twice what he makes at Stanford, so I guess
he feels he has to listen."
Bowlsby could not be reached for further
comment Wednesday evening. According to
the source, he wanted to meet with Johnson
Wednesday night, though the source cau
tioned, "it would take someone else than
Bob Bowlsby getting involved" to work out
a 23rd-hour deal.
Johnson's logical replacement would
have been former Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who returned last fall in a
part-time position in the athletic department
as an assistant to Bowlsby. Montgomery,
however, was hired just last Friday as head
coach at Cal, and issued a statement yester
day to the Oakland Tribune reaffirming his
desire to fulfill his new role.

After four years on the Farm, men's basketball coach Trent Johnson will report
edly turn down a contract extension and leave Stanford to fill the vacant position
at Louisiana State. Johnson was 80-48 as head coach of the Cardinal.
"I am the head basketball coach at
the University of California," Mont
gomery said, "i am excited about the
challenges that lie ahead and look for
ward to competing for a Pac-10 cham
pionship."
Johnson first came to the Farm in
1996 and served three seasons as an
assistant to Montgomery before tak
ing a head coaching position at Neva
da. After five seasons, he returned to
Stanford in 2004 when Montgomery
left to coach the NBAs Golden State
Warriors.
On the sidelines, Johnson devel
oped a reputation for hard-nosed in
tensity that rubbed some players the
wrong way but delivered results. He
led the Cardinal to three NCAA
Tournament appearances and an 80-
48 record in four seasons, including a
45-27 record in Pac-10 play. This sea
son he led Stanford to 28 wins and its
first Sweet Sixteen appearance since
2001.
Still, a contract extension never
came. His original five-year deal was
set to expire after next season, leading
some to speculate that the coach and
athletic director did not exactly see
eye-to-eye.
"[Johnson leaving] is not that sur
prising to someone who knows what
their relationship has been like since
day one," the source said."From what
I understand, every conversation is
fine, but they're just infrequent. For
whatever reason, [Bowlsby] will go
months, months, months, without
meeting coach Johnson. Of course

"l thought he was
a great coach and
am sad he is
leaving Stanford."

Senior forward
meetings were canceled and resched
uled, blah, blah, blah, they're both
busy. But some of us, we assumed, he's
coached here two times and won
twice, it seems like a pretty easy deci
sion."
Stanford's players had not heard
of Johnson's potential move to
Louisiana State until reading online
media reports Wednesday morning.
Johnson informed the team in person
in a hastily scheduled meeting
Wednesday afternoon.
"I really enjoyed playing for coach
Johnson," said senior forward and
team co-captain Taj Finger, whose de
fensive energy matched Johnson's
coaching style. "I thought he was a
great coach and am definitely sad to
see he is leaving Stanford University."

On his blog, former Stanford Star
Mark Madsen expressed surprise at
Johnson's departure but wished his
former assistant coach well.
" 1 can attest to the fact that all of us
who played under Trent (when he was
a Stanford assistant coach) are
mourning if he's really gone,but at the
same time we are happy for him."
Madsen wrote. "1 am happy for Trent
and his family. This man deserves the
very best because he is a first-class in
dividual and one of the best basket
ball minds in the business."
"In the same way that there is a
business side to the NBA. there is a
business side to being a college
coach," he added. "I wish somehow
we could have kept Trent at Stanford,
but it looks like he's taken another
great opportunity."
News of Johnson's impending depar
ture has already put some recruiting
efforts on hold. Ryan Kelly, a 6-foot- 1 )
power forward from North Carolina,
canceled a potential campus visit on
Wednesday after hearing about the
potential coaching change.
Doreen Kelly, however, said her
son was still interested in Stanford.
"Stanford is Stanford," she told
Scout.com. "That's the point. Now
this isn't the appropriate time to visit
them but we'll look anyway.The point
is [the staffs] personal lives are in tur
moil. They have no idea what job
they'll have in 48 hours. Why put them
through that? We'll back off and see
what the scenario is. The only thing
that is personally disappointing is try

ing to figure out if distance will be a
factor" in Ryan's decision.
It has been a tumultuous off-sea
son thus far for Stanford. Johnson's
departure comes in the wake of
Montgomery's decision to move
across the Bay and the announce
ment by sophomore seven-footers
Brook and Robin Lopez on March 31
that they would forgo their final two
seasons at Stanford to enter the 2008
NBA Draft.
