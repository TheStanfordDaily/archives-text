## 'Last lecture' sensation becomes book 
### SONJA BARISIC THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
To millions who have watched him on the
Internet or on Oprah Winfrey's TV show. Randy
Pausch is the 47-year-old professor dying of can
cer who inspired them with his "last lecture,"
about achieving childhood dreams and living with
integrity and joy.
1 lis neighbors in a Virginia suburb know him
as the guy biking around the streets for exercise
while chattering into a cell-phone headset.
That's what the Carnegie Mellon University
computer science professor did to expand his 76-
minute talk into a book without taking time that
he doesn't have away from the people for whom
the book was intended: the three children, all
under 7. he won't be around to help his wife raise.
"The Last Lecture" is being published Tuesday
by Hyperion, after a bidding war that netted a
deal reportedly worth $6.7 million, a figure
Pausch won't confirm.
The book is the result of a collaboration with
the man listening on the other end of the phone as
Pausch pedaled and talked during 53 long rides.
The Wall Street Journal's Jeffrey Zaslow. who
attended the lecture in September and later wrote

about it in his column.
The book goes beyond the lecture, giving
Pausch more room to his kids what he would
have tried to teach them over the next 20 years.
He counsels them to have fun, tell the truth, dare
to take risks, look for the best in everyone, make
time for what matters and always be prepared
(explaining that's why he usually carries $200 in
his wallet).
"I like the book better than the lecture
because I like operational advice," he says during
an interview at a coffee shop, where he orders hot
water and stirs in hot-chocolate mix from a pack
et he pulls out of his pocket. He avoids the drinks
on the menu as a precaution; surgery to remove
parts of several organs has left him lactose-intol
erant.
He decided to do the book, at his wife's urging,
because thousands of people wrote to him after
seeing his lecture, wanting him to know his words
helped them or loved ones going through cancer
or other tough situations.
"We just felt... if 1 can find some way to make
lemonade for somebody else out of these lemons,
then let's do that," he says
The 6-foot Pausch is thin - his weight has
dropped from 182 pounds to as low as 138 - with

an almost unnervingly direct stare, bushy brows
and thick, graying hair.
He found out in September 2006 that he had
pancreatic cancer, an especially deadly cancer
with few treatment options. Last August, he
learned the cancer had spread. Doctors told him
he had three to six months live.
He recently suffered heart and kidney failure.
He's in pain all the time and he hasn't been strong
enough to ride his bike. He's stopped chemother
apy and spends many days in bed.
He emphasizes that he isn't giving up and he's
doing what he can to "stretch the clock" so maybe
he will live long enough to see someone find a
cure. His prognosis now is muddier, but "there is
no respectable physician in the world who would
take an over-under bet that I'll be here past
December."
On the advice of experts, he doesn't plan to tell
his kids he's dying until he looks and acts sick.
A month after learning the cancer was termi
nal, Pausch gave his talk, in an auditorium packed
with students and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon,
where he had co-founded The Entertainment
Technology Center and pioneered the nonprofit
Alice project, which teaches students computer
programming in a 3D environment.
