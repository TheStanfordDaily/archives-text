second, who shut down Davis until the sixth.
Meanwhile the Cardinal bats were finally able
to get something going in the fifth.
Aggies starter Bryan Evans was replaced
with Trevor Fox. which was good news for the
Card. Evans had held Stanford to just two hits
while striking out five over his four innings on
the hill, but Fox couldn't hold the Card down
any longer.
Fox was greeted with consecutive singles
from Joey August (2-6, R). Austin Yount (2-4,

R) and Zach Jones (1-5, R. RBI), resulting in
one run. Jake Schlander (0-3,2 R) then drew a
walk before Cord Phelps (2-6. R. 2 RBI) deliv
ered another single, scoring two and making
the score 3-2. Fox (1.2 IP. 5 H. 3 ER) then set
tled down to get the next three hatters.
Davis put one more on the board in the top
of the sixth, tying the game at 3-3, but that did
n't last long. Stanford loaded the bases in the
bottom of the seventh and Davis brought in
Marco Grifantini (0.2 IP. R) to face pinch hit
ter Brent Milleville (1-1. R. RBI) with one out.
Grifantini hit Milleville, scoring one. and Stan
ford added three more, all unearned, by way of
a wild pitch and an error by shortstop Scott
Heylman. making the score 7-3 Stanford.
The Aggies weren't done, though, as Davis
piled on three more runs in the eighth, making
the score 7-6. Stanford put one run up in the
bottom of that inning but it wouldn't be
enough, as the Aggies rallied to tie the game at
eight in the ninth.
The Cardinal got the winning run on base
with no outs in the bottom of the ninth as
Milleville singled off of Tom Briner (0.1 IP.
ER). Wande Olabisi was inserted as a pinch
runner and made his presence felt, stealing
second after Sean Ratliff struck out for the
first out. Briner got August to strike out as
well, bringing up pinch hitter Colin Walsh with
a chance to win the game. Walsh
drove one to the gap, but the center
fielder Ryan Royster was able to
get under it. forcing extra innings.
Carey Schwartz (3 IP, 2 H,ER,3
SO), in his first appearance of the
season, allowed just one Aggie run
ner in the tenth and eleventh, but
Kikki Foster (1-1, R) led off the
twelfth with a double. Schwartz
struck out the next two batters he
faced,but Matt Dempsey (1-6. RBI)
drove him in with a single to bring
the score to 9-8.
Stanford was retired in order in
the bottom of the inning by Jeff
Reekers, who picked up the win (3-
2) after turning in perfect frames in
the 11th and 12th. Schwartz was
tagged with the loss, dropping his
record to 0-1. Stanford fell to 15-10-
1 while UC-Davis improved their
record to 21-10.
Stanford will look for its first win
as the No. 10 ranked team in the
country this weekend when it trav
els north to challenge the Oregon
State Beavers in Corvallis, Oregon.
The road trip is the first weekend
road series against a Pac-10 oppo
nent this season and the first time
the Cardinal has spent a weekend
away from the Farm since it took
two of three from Texas last month.
All three games of the series will be

a wild pitch and an error by shortstop Scott
Heylman. making the score 7-3 Stanford.
The Aggies weren't done, though, as Davis
piled on three more runs in the eighth, making
the score 7-6. Stanford put one run up in the
bottom of that inning but it wouldn't be
enough, as the Aggies rallied to tie the game at
eight in the ninth.
The Cardinal got the winning run on base
with no outs in the bottom of the ninth as
Milleville singled off of Tom Briner (0.1 IP.
ER). Wande Olabisi was inserted as a pinch
runner and made his presence felt, stealing
second after Sean Ratliff struck out for the
first out. Briner got August to strike out as
well, bringing up pinch hitter Colin Walsh with
a chance to win the game. Walsh
drove one to the gap, but the center
fielder Ryan Royster was able to
get under it. forcing extra innings.
Carey Schwartz (3 IP, 2 H,ER,3
SO), in his first appearance of the
season, allowed just one Aggie run
ner in the tenth and eleventh, but
Kikki Foster (1-1, R) led off the
twelfth with a double. Schwartz
struck out the next two batters he
faced,but Matt Dempsey (1-6. RBI)
drove him in with a single to bring
the score to 9-8.
Stanford was retired in order in
the bottom of the inning by Jeff
Reekers, who picked up the win (3-
2) after turning in perfect frames in
the 11th and 12th. Schwartz was
tagged with the loss, dropping his
record to 0-1. Stanford fell to 15-10-
1 while UC-Davis improved their
