The Minnesota Lynx selected Cardi
nal guard Candice Wiggins with the third
pick of the WNBA Draft on Wednesday,
a day after the Stanford senior's colle
giate career ended.
Stanford's only other senior — guard
Cissy Pierce — was not selected.
Wiggins, the most prolific scorer in
Pac-10 history, will join a young Min
nesota hackcourt that includes Seimone
Augustus and Lindsey Harding, who
were hack-to-back No. 1 overall selec
tions in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
Wiggins is corning off a stellar season
and NCAA Tournament. She had two
40-point games in the NCAAs — the
only player in history to accomplish such
a feat — and led the Cardinal to Tues
day's championship game, which it lost
to Tennessee. Wiggins was named to the
All-Tournament team for her efforts.
"She is coming off of one of the best
NCAA Tournament performances in re
cent memory," Lynx head coach Don
Zierden said. "We are excited to see
what she can do on the court to help the
Lynx become a playoff contender in
2008 and beyond."
On the season. Wiggins averaged 20.3

points and 4.8 rebounds per game, to go
along with a team-high 80 steals. She
won the illustrious Wade Trophy for na
tional player of the year, and was select
ed to the All-America team for the
fourth time.
Wiggins finishes her Stanford career
atop the record books. Her total points
(2,629) and three-point baskets made
(295) are the most in Pac-lOand Stanford
history; and she also holds the school
record for steals and free throws made.
"It is very exciting to be able to add an
elite player like Candice Wiggins to our
roster," said Roger Griffith, the Chief
Operating Officer of the Lynx. "She has
been one of the best players in the nation
in each of her four collegiate seasons.
Throughout her career she has shown an
amazing intensity and incredible passion
for basketball."
Wiggins was selected after Ten
nessee's Candace Parker, who went No.
1 overall to the Los Angeles Sparks, and
LSU's Sylvia Fowles, who was picked by
the Chicago Sky. Though an academic
senior, Parker had one more year of eli
gibility left because of a medical redshirt
during her freshman year. She is the first
women's basketball player to leave
school early for the WNBA Draft,
Wiggins will be joined on the Lynx by
two familiar opponents: Tennessee's
Nicky Anosike and Connecticut's
Charde Houston. The Lynx selected

Anosike with their second round
pick. Anosike, a center, knocked
down six baskets and grabbed eight
rebounds as she helped propel the
Lady Vols to their second straight
title. All five Tennessee starters were
chosen in the draft.
In the third round, the Lynx
picked up Houston, who came off the

bench for the Huskies during their
semifinals loss to Stanford.
The next month will be a hectic
one for Wiggins. First, she will join
the U.S. National Team in Chicago,
and then travel with them to Beijing,
where they will play for a week in an
Olympic test event. She will then at
tend the Lynx's training camp at the
end of the month, which will run until
Minnesota kicks off its season on
Mav 18.
