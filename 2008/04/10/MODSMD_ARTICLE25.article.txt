## Lambie ready to leave Stanford for bigger things; Olympic Trials up first 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford students would struggle to run a
mile in under seven minutes, let alone five. Not so for
senior Arianna Lambie.
ITie 14-time All-American begins most days with a
run before she heads off to class, and then runs some
more afterwards. One of the most talented runners in
the Stanford track and field program's history, Lambie
not only has school records to her name, but also holds
an American record.
Although she just ended her career as a competitive
Stanford athlete, Lambie will remain on campus, train
ing with the team while focusing on completing her last
quarter of classes to obtain her Master's degree in
Earth Systems. This highly skilled runner has much
more to her small frame than a strong heart.
Lambie's energy is divided among running, envi
ronmental policy and family; she hopes to pursue each
passion in due course. As for running, with the Beijing
Olympics just around the corner. Lambie will compete
in the 5,00() meter run at the American trials, hoping to
obtain a spot on the 2(X)8 U.S. Olympic team.
Lambie has also begun the process of speaking with
potential sponsors, and hopes to start running profes
sionally by the end of spring. However, her decisions
and journey to this point have been far from easy. In
addition to the hours of training, and countless worn
sneakers, she had to remain committed despite "in
juries, doubts and other callings continually threaten
ing one's passion to endure." Lambie questioned her-

self the most in considering the two
paths she foresaw for her life.
One direction offered the life of a
professional athlete, with all of the
running, training and constant com
petition that it entails. Her other in
terests illuminated real-world prob
lems, highlighting a world full of en
vironmental and energy challenges.
However, Lambie has emerged with
a two-fold course.
"I have an opportunity to do
what I love, now, for a limited time
â€” that is not just run, but to devote
more effort to running than I've
ever chosen to do and to improve to
a potential I believe is high above
where I am," Lambie said when
asked to describe her career aspira
tions. "I fortunately don't have to
choose this life over the social
change life that will pick up with full
force after a quick four or five years

of running."
As she prepares to leave Stan
ford, Lambie talked about how
much Stanford has given her. from
"genuine care from world
renowned professors who inspire"
to a number of people from Stan
ford Athletics. Lambie was adamant
on thanking Dena Floyd, one of
Stanford's strength and condition
ing staff, and several of the track
specific staff: director Edrick Flore
al. head coach Peter Tegen, and as
sistants David Vidal and Mary Jo
Alexander.
Most importantly, Arianna Lam
bie hopes to pass the torch onto re
maining Stanford Track and Field
women.
"You made me proud to wear the
Stanford singlet," Lambie said to
the current and future Stanford ath
letes. "You made me smile being
part of this team. Keep each other's
fire lit, stand up for yourself, and run
so you have no regrets."
