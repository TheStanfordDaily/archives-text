# Erica McLain leaping to new heights as her Stanford career comes to a close
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Also highlighting the women's team is senior Erica
McLain. McLain has been a name to fear in the world
of jumping since her high school days in Piano, Tex. A
12-time All-American and an American Junior Record
Holder, McLain is the only female at Stanford to ever
win the same event twice at Indoor Nationals.
Yet this muscular and powerful woman has a soft
artistic side, and she never goes to a track meet without
her two stuffed animals.
Now hoping to jump professionally, McLain was first
introduced to the triple jump as a freshman in high
school. Having been an avid gymnast until then, it
seemed natural to use the same bounding,coordination
and explosive abilities on a track.
As McLain's collegiate career draws to a close (after
NCAA Outdoor National Championships in June), she
hopes to have a professional contract waiting for her
and to be well on her way to training at the highest level.
As triple jumpers usually don't peak until about age 27,
McLain looks forward to "a healthy and lengthy ca
reer."
When she's not on the track, McLain's other favorite
pastime is photography; she is a Communication major
with a minor in Studio Art. Because of her strong inter
est in fashion, McLain will explore various avenues of
the industry while she trains, so that her options for
graduate work may be open after the conclusion of her
athletic career.
McLain attributes her success to her smile. Being at
a demanding institution like Stan
ford and constantly feeling the pres
sures of the stressful Division I
competitive world can take its toll,
but McLain has several methods to
mentally prepare herself to over
come the challenges.
"Mental toughness is a huge
component," she said. "I still have a
long way to go. but learning to focus
my mind and calm my thoughts is
kev to my athletic abilities. Over

time, I've found that if I just smile in
my head the moment I step on the
runway, it helps clear away all the
busy thoughts."
McLain credits Stanford as a
beautiful environment where she
has been able to work and play suc
cessfully. The senior is looking for
ward to her last quarter on the
Farm, where she will be able to
spend time on photography and
physical therapy while enjoying
thae last few days of life at college.
Amidst her wine-tasting and
kickboxing classes, McLain also
hopes to spend much of her well
deserved time back on the track
and with her coach as the Cardinal

looks to finish strong down the
stretch. These last few months will
provide a respite before the U.S.
Olympic Trials and the upcoming
Olympic Games.
As Stanford bids both Lambie
and McLain a fond farewell, it?s
clear that the two have already
made their impact. An afternoon
wandering by Cobb Track may re
sult in the fortunate chance to
watch these women in action, as
they train on the Farm for their last
few weeks before taking the next
step.
