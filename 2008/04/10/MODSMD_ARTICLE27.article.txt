# Women crush Sac State
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
From the final score, the match seemed like a
blowout.
Instead, the No. 3 Stanford women's tennis
team was challenged by No. 44 Sacramento State,
though it eventually prevailed 7-0 for its second
shutout on the season.
Fresh off a two-game sweep of Pacific-10 Con
ference rivals Southern California and UCLA,
the Cardinal women showed signs of fatigue from
the huge weekend.
"It was a very emotionally taxing weekend
and we're all just physically recovering from it,"
junior Jessica Nguyen said. "We had a great
match against UCLA getting revenge against
them. Usually we take a week to recover and gear
up for the next weekend, but we wanted to throw
in another match."
Moreover, the match, which was rescheduled
from the beginning of the season, began late in
the afternoon.
"It's really hard to go with a match in the mid
dle of the week in the middle of school and while
we're still recovering," Nguyen said. "Everybody
was worn down with classes in the morning. It was
definitely weird with the lighting being dark by
the end of the match."
Indeed, Stanford's play was out of character
from the get-go. as the team almost lost in dou
bles at the No. 1 and 3 positions.
However, all three teams would prevail in a
sweep for the doubles point.
In singles.senior Celia Durkin and sophomore
Lindsay Burdette both dropped their first sets.
Similarly, freshman Carolyn McVeigh dropped
her second set.
All three matches would go into super
tiebreakers, with the Cardinal women prevailing.
"We did a great job and it was like another day
of practice, having a match in practice and getting
another win in our record," Nguyen said.
At No. 2, Nguyen defeated Melissa Valenzuela
6-2,6-1 in dominating fashion.
"As we play more matches, I've been feeling
better about my game more than before,"
Nguyen said. "With the NCAA tournament in
sight, it helps everybody focus more and up their

games in a month.The more matches we play, the
better we get and that's been showing in the re
sults."
At No. 1, freshman Hilary Barte continued her
victory streak as Katrina Zheltova retired after
dropping the first set, 6-1.
Ever since being put in the top spot, Barte has
won 14 straight matches, reaching a national
ranking of No. 7.
Moreover, her play and the team's success re
cently earned her Pac-10 Player of the Week hon
ors.
"Hilary has done such an amazing job at the
number one position," Nguyen said. "She has just
performed on a regular basis and has been such a
great leader on the team as a freshman. It goes to
show that age doesn't really matter on this team,
and it has given hope and inspiration to the
younger girls."
