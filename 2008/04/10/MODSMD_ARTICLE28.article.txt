# Slump stings Cardinal

â€” fe . pring break is supposed to
" be a time to relax, unwind,
spend time with your friends
Band forget about the pitfalls
of winter quarter.
Not if you are a Stanford softhall
player.
While their friends and class
mates were enjoying trips home, or
to vacation spots like Mexico and
Hawaii, the girls on the softball team
and their suddenly cold bats suffered
through the beginning of Pacific-10
Conference play here on the Farm.
Many Stanford students returned
to school for spring quarter with sun
burns, but the softball team was feel
ing anything but hot. After beginning
the season pounding its opponents to
the tune of a 33-2 start, Stanford
began Pac-10 play with a five-game
losing streak, during which its bats
looked like they'd been spending
time in the permafrost of Antarctica
rather than in sunny California.
The Cardinal managed just three
runs in five losses to begin the con
ference season, and the team now
faces its potentially hardest chal
lenge: fighting back to the top of the
Pac-10 standings.
Stanford got back on the right
track this past Sunday when it picked
up its first conference victory, a 3-1
dog-fight of a game against Washing
ton in Seattle. But all the Cardinal
players know that they will have to
play better if they want to be the le
gitimate title contenders that they
seemed to be early on in the season.
Head coach John Rittman is not
overly concerned with the team's
play to date.
"We have good leadership within the
team, and the upperclassmen really
understand the peaks and valleys of
Pac-10 play, and they know how

every game is a battle." Rittman said
before practice on Wednesday. "As
long as we make adjustments, we'll
be fine. A timely hit here or there and
we are 5-1. and not 1-5."
To say that every Pac-10 game js a
battle is quite an understatement. Six
of the conference's eight teams are
ranked in the top 25 nationally, and
unlike non-conference play when
the Cardinal often faced sub-par
pitching, Stanford is now facing some
of the country's best pitchers every
game.
Coach Rittman feels that fiuntig
the weaker pitching in non-confer.
ence play may have led to some of
the struggles early on in Pac-10 play.
"We are facing the best pitchers in
the country ... we need to be more
compact," Rittman said. "Our swings
got a little long in the preseason, but
now we are facing Ail-Americans
everyday, so we have to get back to
developing compact swings and
work on just putting the ball in play."
Sophomore center fielder Alissa
1 laber broke it down even more sim
ply.
"The team has been pressing a bit.
and I think sometimes our minds get
cluttered thinking about our swings
and trying to do things a certain
way," Haber said. "1 think this week
we are really working on going up to
the plate with a blank slate and going
back to the basics of just 'see the ball,
hit the ball.'"
The team will definitely have to
do a better job of "just hitting the
ball" in timely situations if it wishes
to improve.
As coach Rittman pointed out,
getting on base hasn't been the issue.
The Cardinal managed 34 baserun
