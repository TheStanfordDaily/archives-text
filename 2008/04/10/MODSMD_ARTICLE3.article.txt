Students voting for Gobaud-Goldgof should not
expect to he swimming in Flo-Mo Field next year.
And Sharma-Cackler supporters better not count on
seeing the University step in to subsidize birth control
anytime soon. David Gobaud "08 told The Daily yes

"We don't think we can get the pool built in a year,
but we can lay the groundwork for that," Gobaud
