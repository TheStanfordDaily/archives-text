# Slates discuss promises on platforms
## Executive candidates comment on feasibility of plans 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students voting for Gobaud-Goldgof should not
expect to he swimming in Flo-Mo Field next year.
And Sharma-Cackler supporters better not count on
seeing the University step in to subsidize birth control
anytime soon. David Gobaud "08 told The Daily yes
terday that several of his campaign promises are any
thing but certain, and Priyanka Sharma '09 admitted
that some of her proposals could take a substantial
amount of time.
Dorsey-Harris and Doshi-I lon largely escaped the
problem of making promises the slates will not be
able to keep by simply eschewing the publication of a
detailed platform.
Sharma, who currently serves as the
Undergraduate Senate Chair, said that a specific plat
form is a prerequisite for success in the ASSU.
"Having been in the Senate for one year, 1 have a
feeling that the only way to get things done is to have
specifics," Sharma said. "Because even if you do have
specifics, there's a long road to go."
Jonny Dorsey '09 defended the Dorsey-Flarris
platform's lack of specifics.
"Frankly we are not convinced that running
around during election week to speak to specific
administrators about issues qualifies as doing sub
stantial research on achieving big change at
Stanford." Dorsey said. "Are we at all embarrassed
that we don't have more specifics? No."
Gobaud and Greg Goldgof '08 certainly should
not be embarrassed at not having a lot of specifics;
their Web site lists dozens of campaign promises. But
Gobaud told The Daily yesterday that many of the
items promised on their platform cannot easily be
guaranteed.
The slate's most ambitious proposal — turning
FloMo field into a recreational pool — must jump a
variety of hurdles, including not violating the
University General Use Plan with the county, moving
the programs currently at FloMo field to other loca
tions and of course, securing adequate funding.
"We don't think we can get the pool built in a year,
but we can lay the groundwork for that," Gobaud
said. "We don't expect to get a pool built by fall; we'll

try but that won't happen."
"The reason why we think it's
feasible is because it's obvious that
there needs to be a recreational
pool," he added.
Gobaud-Goldgof also promises a
variety of dining reforms — most
prominently the acceptance of
Cardinal Dollars at the Treehouse
and all eateries, and at campus vend
ing machines.
But Gobaud told The Daily that
the slate has yet to meet with Acting
Executive Director of Dining Eric
Montell — the administrator was
sick and cancelled a meeting sched
uled with the slate prior to campaign
week.
"1 can't guarantee them," said
Gobaud about the dining reforms.
"It's something that I will work on."
The late night weekend
'Social Shuttle' promised by
Gobaud-Goldgof also may not come
to fruition. A shuttle taking students
from parties to their dorms might
run into the same problems that led
to the cancellation of several senior
pub nights last year because of
drunk seniors vomiting on the
Marguerite.
"We'd make sure students know
there is a fine if you do throw up on
the bus," Gobaud said. "1 think it's
something we can try. and we'll see
what happens."
Just like the Gobaud-Goldgof list
of campaign promises, the Sharma-
Cackler platform includes a list of
promised actions.
But unlike Gobaud-Goldgof, the

Sharma-Cackler slate admits on its
Web site that it will advocate for cer
tain reforms, but cannot necessarily
guarantee them.
Instead of promising need-blind
international admission, Sharma-
Cackler only says that it will advo
cate for change.
"We've talked to donors and
what we understood is there is a lack
of recognition of how big the prob
lem is," Sharma said. "Alums would
donate if they think students are
excited about it. We want a big cam
paign across campus ... and through
the committee [on international aid
that Sharma started in this year's
Senate] we have already started it."
Sharma and Cackler did make
some promises that may be difficult
to accomplish during their tenure.
On their Web site, they list "subsi
dize birth control at Vaden" under
the "what we'll do for you" section.
But Sharma admitted that such a
plan would take time.
"It is definitely feasible, but it
would take a lot of effort and con
vincing to get it done," Sharma said.
"Once we have raised awareness, we
will create a realistic proposal and
take it to the administration. This
will take time."
Although the slate did not pub
lish a formal list of objectives that
will be hard to achieve. Dorsey-
Harris was not immune from mak
ing promises that will be difficult to
keep.
The slate told The Daily that it
aims to reform Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) so
that it fully meets the needs of stu
dents— by adding more counselors
so that patients do not have to wait
several days to get an appointment,
can see the same counselor every

time they come in and do not run
out of free visits in a single academ
ic year.
But Sharma, who also intends to
reform CAPS, said that dramatic
reform may not be feasible.
"To make that promise [of hiring
new counselors] — and we are fully
aware that CAPS is barely capable
of fulfilling short term services — is
premature." Sharma said. "To say
overnight we are going to turn it into
a long term service is wrong."
Sharma instead said that she
would work tin a number of
specifics, including more clearly
defining the role of CAPS, and using
the RA network to alert students of
the role it should play.
The Doshi-Hon slate has taken
the same path as Dorsey-Harris.
Rather than publish a long list of
campaign promises online. Doshi-
Hon, along with Dorsey-Harris,
favored building support interaction
with students.
"We wanted to make sure that we
communicated that individually and
specifically with people," Hon said
of his slate's decision not to publish
a list of campaign promises. "We
have some of our own specific ideas,
like SSF. buying the Coho. but these
are just our ideas, we wanted to
make sure that students agreed on it
too."
If Doshi-Hon or Dorsey-Harris
are declared the winners on Friday,
their tenure as executives will be a
departure from this year.
"Hershey and Mondaire [the cur
rent executives] had clear goals,"
Sharma said, "and we got a lot of
those done."
