c
ongratulations! You're leaving the Farm, on your way
to your career of choice. As you take steps into the "real world"
of work, there are resources available to help make your transi
tion a smooth one.
On the Career Development Center website, you'll find an
entire section devoted to "life after Stanford," http://cardinalca
reers.stanford.edu/jobsearch/afterstanford/default.htm. Included
are information and advice on working with your supervisor,
finding a mentor, understanding the company culture, and man
aging your time and stress levels.

Other helpful tips include how to structure a savings plan and
set a budget. You'll also find a list of applicable publications in
our CDC Resource Library. Courtesy of Lockheed Martin, we
have several copies of "life after school, explained." This is a
wonderful booklet that clearly outlines things like how to set
up bank accounts, finding an apartment-closing the deal,
signing the lease, employer forms and decisions you'll need to
make in your first days on the job, and insurance and tax
information.
And, remember, the CDC will be here to help you throughout
your career. So, if you get to the point of needing a job change
or wish to discuss career options, you can make an appoint
ment with one of our career counselors. Other services avail
able to alumni can be found at http://cdc.stanford.edu/alum.
Again, congratulations. The CDC wishes you all the best.
