BS Computer Science, 1998
What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join clubs or student organizations? What did you
study? What were your favorite classes? Theta Xi Fraternity, Cycling
Team, Crew, Judicial Panel, University Singers. I liked all of
my CS classes, but it particular I liked my senior project and
my Al courses.
When you first started at Stanford, did you have any thoughts about
your career plans? If so, what were those thoughts? I didn't really
know what I wanted to do, but I knew I loved software and
business and that eventually I wanted to run my own compa
ny, but not straight out of school because I didn't have the
experience I needed.
Did those initial ideas change or evolve while you were at Stanford?
My plans did not really change I always wanted to do some
thing related to software.
What did you do with your summers? Did you work? Did you have any
interesting experiences? How did you find those experiences? I
managed to get lucky and land some excellent internships at
Trilogy, Microsoft and Javasoft, which solidified my plans to
go into the software industry. My summers were one of the
best parts of my college years I learned a great deal and I
met and worked with brilliant engineers who served as men
tors and role models for me.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to do
to find it? I joined Plumtree Software as their 36th employee
and a consultant in their newly formed professional services
department. I found the job through the career center I
dropped my resume in an employer preselect envelope and
they selected me for an interview.
What did you do at your first job? Was it what you expected? The job
was everything I expected and more. I ended up taking on
several roles and responsibilities including servicing the first
handful of customers by installing and deploying the first few
versions of the Plumtree product. I traveled all over the coun
try to work with different customers. I wrote custom utilities to
help professional services, worked on in-house development
projects, and eventually joined product engineering and
wrote about 30% of version 3.5 s user interface. I then
moved to Integration Engineering, where I was responsible
for suites and frameworks of products that integrated
Plumtree with other major software vendors products such as
SAR Siebel, Documentum and Microsoft Office. Later I got
involved in management, but still kept making contributions
as a lead engineer and also did various customer projects,
which, although I didn't realize it at the time, were instrumen
tal in helping me develop the contacts I needed to start my
own business.
What skills/experiences from college were most important in your
career development? All of my CS courses have been really
valuable over the years, but I also think getting involved in

leadership positions in my fraternity and on the cycling team
(where I served as sponsorship chair) helped me develop the
sales, marketing and business development skills that con
tributed to my career at Plumtree and have been invaluable
in my role at bdg.
Any advice for students? Take risks. There s plenty of time to
make mistakes, learn from them, and start over again
stronger and better off than you were before.
Can you provide a brief description of the work you do and examples of
typical task/projects. I now serve as President and CEO of bdg,
a small enterprise software consulting firm specializing in
Plumtree Portal deployments and custom software develop
ment. I spend most of my time working directly for customers
and I try to bill at least 40 hours a week. On top of that, I
oversee all sales, marketing and business development activi
ties as well as management of the other three employees. I've
hired some one to handle all the administrative and opera
tional aspects of the business. Our typical projects involve
Plumtree deployments, Plumtree training and other custom
software development.
Can you provide a brief chronology of your career — probably the
major projects or turning points?
Summer of 95: Trilogy Internship

Summer of 96: Microsoft Internship
Summer of 97: Javasoft Internship
1998: Joined Plumtree as a Consultant in their PSO
1999: Joined the Product Engineering Team as a Software
Engineer
2000: Joined the Integration Engineering Team as a Senior
Software Engineer
2001: Became an Engineering Manager and Lead Engineer
in Integration Engineering
2002: Left Plumtree to start bdg
2003: Led bdg through Portal deployments at Merck, Exxon,
and VHA; wrote custom software for GSK; taught training at
Dex Media and Booz Allen Hamilton; landed a large contract
doing a Plumtree deployment for the federal government
If you have not already addressed this; how has networking or being
mentored shaped/helped your career? The contacts I made at
Plumtree directly contributed to the success of bdg. When
you make a customer happy, they remember you and will be
likely to come back to you for repeat business and serve as a
reference which helps you bring in new business. My first
manager at Plumtree stressed the importance of reference
able customers and now thafs bdg's mantra.
