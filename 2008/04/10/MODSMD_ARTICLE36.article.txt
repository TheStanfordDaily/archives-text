What kinds of activities were you involved in while you were at
Stanford? Did you join clubs or student organizations? What did you
study? What were your favorite classes? I was part of a Women in
Science support group and played a lot of Ultimate at
Stanford. Off-campus, I was a volunteer at the Marine
Mammal Animal Hospital in Marin and active at the Palo
Alto Unitarian Universalist church.
When you first started at Stanford, did you have any thoughts about
your career plans? If so, what were those thoughts? Did those initial
ideas change or evolve while you were at Stanford? I basically
defaulted into grad school. I was 24 and had spent the last 4
years traveling and working in many, many different fields,
ranging from being an underwater photographer on a
humpback whale project in the Caribbean to a research
assistant in a molecular biology lab working on catalytic
RNA. My undergraduate mentor told me I'd better think of
going to grad school soon or I d lose my chance of going to
a good school. (I don't know whether he was right but I did
luck into a good school!) When asked at that time what I
wanted to do, I said I wanted to be Al Gore's (then vice presi
dent) science advisor, but thought I might as well have said I
wanted to be Queen of England! (That is probably why I
never took a single political science class!) Quite surprisingly,
I'm as close to my dream as I could have ever imagined
(political science advisor that is, not the British monarchy!)
What did you do with your summers? (work, volunteer, travel,
other experiences) How did you find those experiences? As an
undergraduate at Vermont, I came out to Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station the first summer to take classes and then two
summers later came back to be a teaching assistant for those
same classes. The summer in between, I worked in a
Chemistry lab at the University of Vermont on the develop
ment of anti-cancer agents (which are now in clinical use!
Perhaps one of the things about which I am the most proud
in my career.) Obviously all of those summers were very
important to opening doors for me later however just how
wide do those doors need to be opened? The summer I
taught at Stanford a friend had asked me to join him on a
three-month camping and climbing trip as the EMT for a
bunch of high school students. I regret not having done that.
What was your first job after graduation and what did you have to do
to find it? After graduating college, I worked as a ski instruc
tor in Vermont, a divemaster and an underwater photograph
er in the Caribbean, a research assistant in a molecular
genetics lab, and a fisheries biologist on board fishing boats
in Alaska. To find all of these things, I kept my eyes wide
open and asked tons and tons of questions. To get them, I
was honest and enthusiastic and always able to extract from
each experience what skills and talents it would bring to
whatever thing I was seeking to do next.
What did you do at your first job? Was it what you expected? I pretty
much had very limited expectations (or, to put it another way,
no idea what I wanted to do with my life) so I can't answer
that. That being said, my first job out of grad school was as
a science instructor on a program for college students in
Sulawesi, Indonesia, working on coral reefs. Pretty much all I
want out of a job is to learn something and make a differ
ence. The first goal is vastly more easily achieved than the
second so I make sure to combine both all the time.
How did your career evolve after that? How did your experiences lead
to other opportunities? Simply doing something lead to other
opportunities. I meet so many people who don't know what

they want to do but have tried very little. I tell them to just do
something that sounds interesting, even thought it might not
be "the" right thing. Once you step forward into something,
10 things (opportunities, experiences, skill sets) you never
knew will be obvious to you and then you can refine your
path. At 35, I can't believe how frequently the expression "I
had no idea what I didn't know" has applied in my life.
What skills/experiences from college were most important in your
career development? Any advice for students? For undergrads
especially — be a good student and a nice person, do a
good job, and VALUE your teachers. If you are going to take
some time to explore after college (which I HIGHLY recom
mend), stay in touch with those teachers (professors and TAs
as well as any employer) with whom you interacted and let

them know what you're up to — that will make them much
more able to provide solid recs when you take that step into
something formal (grad school, etc.). Don't go into debt and
don't go to jail. Yes, I am being slightly dramatic but really,
other than not burning your bridges, racking up debt, or
doing something illegal, there is practically nothing you can
do wrong in your first few years out of school. I think my
mentor was probably right that because I had a propensity
toward science and was almost definitely going to pursue
that, going to grad school within 3-5 years of undergrad was
a good idea but the time before that was essential in my life.
