semiconductors, computers, electronic hardware and more.
Many positions in these areas require a technical back

these industries as well.

INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS
You can learn more-lots more-about careers and industries
by talking to people in those fields. If your immediate network
doesn't contain working engineers or anyone else in the high
tech sector, talk to friends, family, faculty and departmental
staff to see who tfiey know.
Stanford's extensive network of alumni is one of its greatest
resources. You'll find some of the best resources for tapping
into this knowledge base appear under "Networking
Resources" on the CDC homepage. See
http://cardinalcareersjtanford.edu/networking/tips/ for tips on
expanding your professional network.
The Stanford Career Network
https://www.stanfordalumni.org/career/scn/home.html
This is a database of thousands of alumni available to
answer your questions and provide career advice; you can
search by major, job function, geographic location and other
criteria.
MAKING DECISIONS
Use the information you've gathered to identify careers and
work environments that match your values, skills and inter
ests. It is more likely that you will find satisfying work if you
pursue opportunities you really want and for which you are
qualified.
If you are having difficulty narrowing your job or internship
search to a manageable number of options, consider mak
ing an appointment at the Career Development Center so
our counselors can help you.
GAINING REAL WORLD KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
There is no question that informational interviews, print
resources and the Internet can provide you with a wealth of
information about your career options. Still, some of the
most valuable knowledge often comes via first-hand experi
ence.
JOB SHADOWING AND EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION
The Shadow Program
http://cardinalcareersjtanford.edu/shadow
Observing first-hand a typical day-in-the-life of a practicing
engineer or other high-tech professional may provide even
more information about a career, industry or organization
than you can gather during a brief informational interview.
This program is also available under the "Networking
Resources" pull-down menu on the CDC homepage.
Internships
http://cardinalcareersjtanford.edu/internships/
An internship will not only clarify what you want in your
career but also give you practical experience that will make
you a more attractive candidate for your next career step.
Concerned that you haven't yet nailed down an internship?
Don't worry-it's not too late! As of April 1, there were 690
internship opportunities advertised in the Cardinal Careers
database.

Tip: When searching the Cardinal Careers internship postings,
run a separate search for each Position Type ("Internship",
"Summer Job" and Temporary") to find the most opportuni
ties.

employers and a wider geographic distribution.

already completed an internship. Contact them to find out
the "inside scoop" on a particular employer or advice on how
to land an internship.

Finding and pursuing job leads-not to mention the reflection,
exploration and research that goes before-is a project; plan
to allocate some time for it. The following resources may
make your effort more effective and fruitful.

Use keywords "start-up" or "startup" to restrict the search
results to smaller, newer companies.
Professional Societies and Industry Associations
http://wwwLgoogle.com/Top/Business/Associations/By_lndustry/
Most professions and industries have one or more societies
or associations associated with them; see the link above for a
directory. Many of these organizations post pb openings
specific to their field. Also, these professional organizations
usually publish scholarly journals and industry/trade maga
zines-great sources for identifying employers in particular
market niches. Finally, these societies and associations hold
conferences, conduct meetings and organize other activities
great opportunities for networking with professionals already
working in your intended specialty area. Many of these soci
eties offer free or discounted membership for students.
Up: Students may be able to avoid (expensive) registration fees
at local conferences by volunteering to help.
