staff to see who tfiey know.
Stanford's extensive network of alumni is one of its greatest
resources. You'll find some of the best resources for tapping

work environments that match your values, skills and inter
ests. It is more likely that you will find satisfying work if you
pursue opportunities you really want and for which you are
qualified.
If you are having difficulty narrowing your job or internship
search to a manageable number of options, consider mak
ing an appointment at the Career Development Center so
our counselors can help you.
GAINING REAL WORLD KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE

resources and the Internet can provide you with a wealth of
information about your career options. Still, some of the
most valuable knowledge often comes via first-hand experi
ence.
JOB SHADOWING AND EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION
The Shadow Program
http://cardinalcareersjtanford.edu/shadow
Observing first-hand a typical day-in-the-life of a practicing
engineer or other high-tech professional may provide even
more information about a career, industry or organization
than you can gather during a brief informational interview.

Resources" pull-down menu on the CDC homepage.

http://cardinalcareersjtanford.edu/internships/
An internship will not only clarify what you want in your

ties.

INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS
You can learn more-lots more-about careers and industries
by talking to people in those fields. If your immediate network
doesn't contain working engineers or anyone else in the high
tech sector, talk to friends, family, faculty and departmental
staff to see who tfiey know.
Stanford's extensive network of alumni is one of its greatest
resources. You'll find some of the best resources for tapping
into this knowledge base appear under "Networking
Resources" on the CDC homepage. See

work environments that match your values, skills and inter
ests. It is more likely that you will find satisfying work if you
pursue opportunities you really want and for which you are
qualified.
If you are having difficulty narrowing your job or internship
search to a manageable number of options, consider mak
ing an appointment at the Career Development Center so
our counselors can help you.
