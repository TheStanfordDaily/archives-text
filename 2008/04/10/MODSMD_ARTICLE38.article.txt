# Resources for Green Careers

Chris Pohalski
Career Development Center
Stanford University
Developing and implementing ways to steward our planet's
finite natural resources and social capital in a sustainable
manner is a large and timely undertaking. It encompasses
developing new green products, services or business models,
as well as taking cleaner, less destructive approaches to cre
ating, using and disposing of existing products and services.
It also involves promoting society's acceptance of these new
approaches through education, marketing and advocacy.
This effort requires the worldwide commitment of many peo
ple, spanning a broad array of skills and specialties: science,
engineering, analysis, business, economics, advocacy, educa
tion, policy, government and international relations. Whatever
your skills and interests, the following resources can help you
stay informed about current trends, explore green career
paths, research employers, and pursue opportunities for
making a difference.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER
Perhaps you already have a clear career objective and would
like some help realizing it. Perhaps you are committed to a
sustainable world, but are unclear about how you can con
tribute. In either case, the Career Development Center can
help you clarify and achieve your goals.
