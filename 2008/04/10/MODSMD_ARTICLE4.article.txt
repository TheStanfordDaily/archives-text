## Crowds welcome back women's bball team 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES STAFF DEVELOPMENT EDITOR 
It wasn't the triumphant welcome that Stanford fans
were expecting less than 24 hours before, but a reception
and rally for the Cardinal women's basketball team drew
a crowd of over 100 fans yesterday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion.
"While 1 know our team is disappointed in not bring
ing back the national championship trophy," said assis
tant coach Amy flicker, "we aren't ashamed to come

back as the No. 2 team in the country."
Assembled in a row behind TUcker, the Cardinal
squad was noticeably missing its star player: Candice
Wiggins.
Along with head coach Tara VanDerveer, the senior
guard was back in Florida at the WNBA Draft. Wiggins
was selected third by the Minnesota Lynx, and her
Tennessee rival Candace Parker was the No. 1 pick by
the Los Angeles Sparks.
While Wiggins was across the country beginning "the
next chapter of her basketball career," TUcker introduced

fellow senior Cissy Pierce to address the crowd of mostly
Stanford alumni and Paid Alto community members.
"Thanks for supporting us in our run at the title,"
Pierce said. "As a senior going out, it means a lot."
Pierce and Wiggins were members of a Stanford
squad that secured four straight Pac-10 championships,
three Elite Eight appearances and this year's Final Four
and national championship appearances.
"With their leadership, our seniors have set a good
example for what we need to do
next year to be just as successful."
said Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.
The sophomore guard also
thanked the many fans — some of
whom were there yesterday after
noon after arriving on their own
flights back from Tampa, Fla. just a
few hours beforehand.
"We're vour friends, too," veiled

an older woman in the stands when
Gold-Onwude pointed out her fel
low students cheering in the stands.
Spirits were generally high in
Maples Pavilion, despite the previ
ous night's 64-48 loss to the Lady
Vols. A highlight reel before the
team's arrival showcased its great
est moments from the season,
including a 73-6 1 ) overtime win over
Tennessee hack in December. The
win was just one of many moments
of which the Stanford women are
proud.
"So many people talked about
us as the nice sirls from Stanford.'

not being tough enough," Gold-
Onwude said. "What's not tough
about beating Rutgers? What's not
tough about beating Baylor,
Tennessee, Maryland. UConn?"
It is with that attitude that the
Cardinal looks toward next season
for another run at the title.
"Candice and Cissy have set a
high standard for these players,"
Tucker said, soon adding that,
"Maybe it'll only be two weeks off
from practice. Ros."
