## Trustees approve wide construction 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
For students tired of the ongoing con
struction throughout campus, Burt
McMurtry M.S. '59, Ph.D. '62, chair of the
Board of Trustees, says that much more is
yet to come.
The Board of Trustees of Stanford
University approved outlines on TUesday
for several new buildings to be constructed
throughout campus and the lands adjacent
to the University. Plans in the works include
a habitat conservation area along creeks
and watersheds on campus lands, a new
child care center near El Camino Real, an
athletics practice gym, a new parking struc
ture and additional faculty housing.
"With all this building, we are going to
pray for tolerance from our faculty, staff
and students," McMurtry said, acknowledg
ing the prolonged construction necessary to
complete these projects.
The conservation habitat will
protect native salamanders in
local water areas. A new multi
story parking structure near
Maples Pavilion, McMurtry said,
is needed to make up for the park
ing areas which will be taken away
to contribute to the new campus
for the Graduate School of
Business. An almost $15 million
practice gym, in which the
Arrillaga family will likely be
involved, will be built because
there is not currently enopgh

practice space for basketball, vol
leyball and other sports.
In addition, the University
plans to expand faculty housing,
particularly with 22 affordable
new rental units near El Camino
that will be specified for assistant
athletic coaches, who have com
plained in the past about the lack
of affordable rental apartments
in the areas surrounding campus.
McMurtry believes these rental
units — which have a projected
cost of approximately $14 million
and could be up as early as the
summer of 2009 — should per
suade assistant coaches to stay on
campus and with the school.
"Attracting and being able to
hold our assistant coaches is a high

enough priority to put some money
into," he said.
Other major moves by the
Board of Trustees included the
addition of five new members to
the board, as well as the election of
Leslie Hume Ph.D. '79. a research
consultant in Mountain View and a
European history scholar, as
President of the Board of Trustees.
Hume will take over as president
when McMurtry steps down in July.
The new members of the Board of
Trustees are Ann Lamont. Miriam
Rivera "86, Goodwin Liu '91,
Richard Sapp '78 and John Ciunn
•65.
