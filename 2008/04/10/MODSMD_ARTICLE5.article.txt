### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
For students tired of the ongoing con
struction throughout campus, Burt
McMurtry M.S. '59, Ph.D. '62, chair of the
Board of Trustees, says that much more is
yet to come.
The Board of Trustees of Stanford
University approved outlines on TUesday
for several new buildings to be constructed
throughout campus and the lands adjacent
to the University. Plans in the works include
a habitat conservation area along creeks
and watersheds on campus lands, a new
child care center near El Camino Real, an
athletics practice gym, a new parking struc
ture and additional faculty housing.
"With all this building, we are going to
pray for tolerance from our faculty, staff
and students," McMurtry said, acknowledg
ing the prolonged construction necessary to
complete these projects.
