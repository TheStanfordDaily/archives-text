Beijing's hosting of this year's sum
mer Olympics has sparked international
outcry against China's human rights
record in Tibet and elsewhere. Others
counter that the Olympics should carry
on, and that the athletes should not be
punished for actions of the Chinese gov
ernment.
The Olympic torch's round-the-world
journey has been marked by demonstra
tions: Amid chaotic protests in Paris, the
torch was extinguished and transported
by bus, while a protester in London man
aged to briefly wrest the torch away
from its bearer.
Josh Fouse '10 saw yesterday's re
routing as "a symbolic victory" for pro
testers. He said he was mostly in the city
to observe, but wore Tibetan prayer flags
around his neck and sometimes chanted
with protesters.

Busloads of Stanford students head
ed to San Francisco on Wednesday, hut
spectators and protesters alike were
unable to see the Olympic torch. At the
last minute, the procession's route was
cut in half as the torch was taken on an
alternate route, and the waterfront clos
ing ceremonies were cancelled.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom
cited public safety concerns amid mass
protests as the reason for changing the
torch's route and canceling the cere
monies.

Stanford students and their friends.
He estimates there were 120 people
in three buses, most of whom
opposed the protesters' claims. ITiey
carried Chinese flags, American
flags, and Olympic Hags and handed
out flyers that read, "Tibet is Free."
Fouse wore a t-shirt stating "One
World, One Dream: Free Tibet
2008." He said he wanted to avoid
political discussions on the bus and
kept his sweatshirt zipped until he

got to McCovey Cove, where the
opening ceremony was held.
At the ceremony, the first athlete
briefly held up the torch before
whisking it into a warehouse, accord
ing to Associated Press reports.
Spectators lost sight of the torch
until it reappeared in a motorcade
on Van Ness, a mile away from its
expected location.
Ilodara was waiting on the
expected route. She left campus at 7
a.m., and members of STAND were
allowed to use a loft office along the
route. Hodara said she unfurled a
huge banner from the loft's windows
that read "China: You can stop geno
cide in Darfur."
Hodara's group followed televi
sion reports and learned around 1:30

p.m. that the procession had been re
routed. Spectators on the street wait
ed, confused.
"There was a lot of hearsay and
no one really knew," Hodara said.
After it became clear that the torch
wasn't traveling down its scheduled
route, Hodara said most of the
crowd dispersed.
"1 went back on the Caltrain and
it was full of people going home,"
she said.
Fouse said he tried to intercept
the torch on its new route, but doing
so would have entailed walking a
total of 16 blocks.
"It was just too far north of us
and we kept getting different infor
mation and opinions on where we
should be."

Fouse and Hodara both said the
protests were mostly peaceful.
Hodara saw cooperative demonstra
tions between people protesting on
behalf of Tibet and people protest
ing on behalf of Darfur, and said that
some people who were there to
show their support for China also
joined the demonstrations against
violence in Darfur.
Fouse said some spectators would
shout over other group's messages,
but he did not witness physical fight
ing or violence.
"It was peaceful, and that's why it
was really frustrating that the torch
didn't come through," Hodara said.
