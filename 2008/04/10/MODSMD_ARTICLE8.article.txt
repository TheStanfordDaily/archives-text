## Alcohol class targets "high-risk" groups 
### PAMSUD STAFF WRITER 
am 112 you drink wine out of a box, you know you have a problem,"
jovially says Ralph Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse Pre
j vention Program in Health Promotion Services at Vaden Health
Center, known for his catchy phrases and witty remarks during
-JL- his in-dorm programs on drinking at Stanford.

Few students are aware, however, of the coveted class in which one can ac
tually receive course credit for listening to Castro's gems of wisdom on al
cohol.

Pediatrics 216. "Alcohol Issues and the Campus Culture," is a four
unit class that seeks to get students involved and aware of alcohol
abuse and social norms on campus.The class is designed to teach stu
dents about the intricacies of alcohol as a psychoactive drug and its
impact on individuals, groups and society

Although the class is open to students from all majors, it is de
signed specifically for student athletes and members of the
Greek community Castro's class includes a research project
through which students assess patterns and perceptions of
other students' alcohol use amongst their teammates or chap
ter.

"We initially got a grant from NCAA nine years ago to
start the class for student-athletes," Castro explained.

"We've expanded it to all students, but this year we have
done a bit more targeted recruitment to higher-risk groups."

In Castro's eyes, higher-risk groups, or groups of students
who have a high likelihood of becoming alcohol abusers, in
elude fraternity members, student athletes and freshmen.

"This is based on national-level survey data," Castro ex
plains.

Stanford data shows that nearly three-fourths of Stanford
freshmen did not drink in high school. In addition. Castro adds, "we
see on average heavier alcohol use among fraternities and student
athletes in both frequency of use and quantity of use."

â– Beyond the data.Castro also believes the group dynamics amongst
fraternities and athletic teams are advantageous to the structure of his
class.

"A lot of the class is about correcting misperceptions that lead to
false norms," Castro explains. "Sports teams and fraternities and sorori
ties have a sense of collective responsibility that allows group interven
tions to be very effective."

Finally, Castro's own research has shown that messages of alcohol ed
ucation resonate most strongly when athletes themselves convey them to
other athletes.

"College athletes are role models for each other," says Castro.
Some students, however, are not so certain about whether it's fair to single
out the Greek community.student athletes and freshmen as high-risk. Armon
Sharei "08, a member of Sigma Nu fraternity, is skeptical of whether his frater
nity fits the bill.
"Most of the alcohol abusers I've seen are not in fraternities," Sharei re
marked. "Fraternity drinking might be more obvious and in the open, but 1
couldn't even name one Sigma Nu member who drinks more than three
nights per week."
Former Track & Field team member Donnie Hill '09 echoes Sharei's skep
ticism.
"It's hard to say whether athletes do in fact drink more, or just draw more
attention when they do drink," remarked Hill. "Before I am an athlete. I am
a student," he added, making the point that labels can sometimes be mislead
ing.
Other students believe that the labeling is in fact deserved. One of Stan
ford men's volleyball team's star freshman players. Spencer McLachlin '11,
believes that athletes do indeed seem to be heavier drinkers than most.
"Being an athlete, by nature we are very competitive," he said. "That car
ries over into drinking."
McLachlin also comments that in his eyes, athletes' drinking behavior is

counter-intuitive.
"It shouldn't he that way, because we have a responsibility to be
healthy and to treat our bodies in the best way possible."
Junior Jamie Nesbitt '09. a varsity lacrosse player, concurred with
McLaughlin.
"With a lot of teams, it's work hard, party hard," she said.
With respect to the amount of alcohol education her team has received,
Nesbitt remarked that she has been very impressed by the amount of atten
tion and level of seriousness Stanford gives to the issue.
According to Castro, correcting misperceptions is a big part of what the
class is all about. In the class. Castro teaches social norming theory, which
serves as the basis for data collection and intervention projects the students
perform.
"The perception may be that 75 percent of the fraternity drinks regularly,
when in reality it is 25 percent," Castro explains. "Most importantly, the class
provides a topic that is salient for students analyzing something that is im
pacting their lives at the present time."
