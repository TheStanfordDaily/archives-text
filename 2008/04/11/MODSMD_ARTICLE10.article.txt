## Stanford seeks dr. diversity Latinos underrepresented in medical profession 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Latino Americans only make up
five percent of California's doctors,
according to a recent study at UC-
San Francisco, though they consti
tute one-third of the state's*popula
tion.
Fernando Mendoza, Associate
Dean for Minority Advising and
Programs at the Stanford School of
Medicine, said the lack of diversity
within the medical profession can
actually reduce the effectiveness of
physicians.
"A lot of work has been done
that's shown how physicians com
municate with patients and the bar
riers to that communication," he
said. "Studies have reported that
there are biases in health care and
that they are quite often uncon
scious; in order to deal with those
unconscious biases, we need to
diversify the work force and devel
op more culturally competent posi
tions."
For the past 14 years, Mendoza
has worked with members of the
Stanford School of Medicine corn
