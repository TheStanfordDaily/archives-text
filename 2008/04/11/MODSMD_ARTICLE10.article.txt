## Stanford seeks dr. diversity Latinos underrepresented in medical profession 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Latino Americans only make up
five percent of California's doctors,
according to a recent study at UC-
San Francisco, though they consti
tute one-third of the state's*popula
tion.
Fernando Mendoza, Associate
Dean for Minority Advising and
Programs at the Stanford School of
Medicine, said the lack of diversity
within the medical profession can
actually reduce the effectiveness of
physicians.
"A lot of work has been done
that's shown how physicians com
municate with patients and the bar
riers to that communication," he
said. "Studies have reported that
there are biases in health care and
that they are quite often uncon
scious; in order to deal with those
unconscious biases, we need to
diversify the work force and devel
op more culturally competent posi
tions."
For the past 14 years, Mendoza
has worked with members of the
Stanford School of Medicine corn
munity to increase the amount of
diversity in admitted students. As
part of his strategy, Mendoza has
tried to implement aggressive out
reach programs in the medical
school to attract potential under
represented minority (URM) stu
dents.
"We started a program at the
med school that targeted mostly
premed populations from various
campuses," he said. "We worked in
conjunction with our colleagues at
the admissions office to address
issues of under-representation and
recruitment. The program has been
bringing URM students to the med
ical school to see what medical
school is really like, as well as help
ing these students with their appli
cations to medical schools."
These programs were often
funded by the federal government,
but due to federal budget cuts in
recent years, outreach programs
such as these have been canceled.

Mendoza cited several reasons
for the gap between the number of
Latino doctors and Latino repre
sentation in the state population.
"Some reasons for this are that
the socioeconomic class of Latinos
gives them less ability to go on to
colleges," he said. "Another aspect
of it is that they're perhaps not
encouraged to go into those careers.
And some of it also has to do with
the unconscious cultural biases
about who should be and who
shouldn't be physicians."
In order to increase diversity in
the medical school student popula
tion, Mendoza also encourages the
admission office to evaluate poten
tial candidates on a broader spec
trum of criteria.
"One thing 1 think is evident." he
said. "We're well behind the curve
and have a long way to go to get the
number of Latino physicians up to
where they represent the propor
tion of the general population."
Mendoza said that admission
offices shouldn't look only at the
quantitative measures of an appli
cant's profile — GPA or MCAT
but should also focus on other less
quantifiable characteristics as well.

"What we've done at Stanford
for the last 30 years is really make
an effort to look at students from a
broad perspective." he said. "That is.
inclusive of academics and leader
ship ability. The problem is that our
measures by numbers don't predict
the ability of people to think criti
cally and work hard, or measure the
passion they have to succeed."
But Mendoza does not advocate
abandoning quantitative measures
of success altogether.
"Fundamentally, when you have
6.000 students you don't have the
time to look at everyone as we try
to do here at the med school," he
said. "So we ask ourselves: what is
the range of scores in which people
can be successful? Let's take that
whole group and look at what the
characteristics are that make good
physicians. Using those kinds of
metrics we've been able to select
people that have been very success
ful in every area of medicine."
While critics of this approach to
admissions worry that the quality of
students admitted to the medical
school will be reduced in the name
of diversity, Mendoza said that this
does not necessarily have to be the
case.
"I came as a medical student
with affirmative action." he said.
"There were four of us then. Now,
I'm a professor here at Stanford,
one colleague is head of a children's
hospital in Mexico City and another
is quadruple boarded."
Mendoza ultimately believes
that diversity in medical schools
and in the physician population will
increase the overall effectiveness of
healthcare.
"We need to be able to get the
kinds of people that will be repre
sentative of society's diversity," he
said. "We can't do that unless we
make an effort to go beyond just
the pure numbers."
