## Changes made to CS program 
### ANNA DEARYBURY 
Last week the Computer Science
(CS) Department announced what
CS Associate Prof. Mehran Sahami
called "the most sweeping changes
since the program was created in the
1980s."
The program now encompasses a
set of interdisciplinary tracks that
will "help eliminate [the] image of
computer science as just program
ming" Sahami said.
"Computer science affects a
diverse set of areas, and we want stu
dents to understand that they have
options to go into those diverse areas
all within the same major," he added.
The initial set of track areas
includes artificial intelligence,
human-computer interaction, graph
ics and information. Students also
have the option of creating their own
individually-designed track.
CS majors from the class of 2012
and beyond will he required to pur
sue a track, but all current students
may choose to forgo the track sys
tem. Sahami said that although stu

dents who pursue the old CS major
without a track will be referred to as
"unspecialized" within the depart
ment, this distinction will not be
shown on the diploma.
Sahami described the advantages
of the new policy as threefold — it
creates an awareness of the breadth
of computer science, gives students
more flexibility and options in pur
suing the major and allows the
department to create more bridges
with other departments to encour
age interdisciplinary work.
The CS core has also been
restructured and divided into two
categories — Theory and Systems
blending former lower and upper
divisions into one new set of require
ments.
But not everyone is as enthusias
tic about the changes to the comput
er science major as the CS faculty.
Riddhi Mittal '11. although early
in her Stanford career, had already
created a four-year plan focused on
the traditional Computer Science
major.
"I'm not going to have to throw

out the entire thing, but 1 definitely
will be deciding what classes to take
more on a quarter-to-quarter basis
now," she said. "Some former elec
tives are now required, some former
requirements are now electives and
a lot of new classes are being intro
duced."
But Mittal agreed that the new
major requirements would ultimate
ly make students appear more
attractive to employers.
"With a Bachelor of Science com
puter science degree." she said, "you
really should be specialized if you
aren't planning on going to graduate
school, and the new requirements
encourage students to do this."
Sahami said the original frame
work for the policy changes started
last spring quarter. Approximately
60 percent of the CS faculty was
directly involved in the construction
of the new form of the major. The
computer science faculty supported
the final changes unanimously.
