## Stanford reaches out to Native applicants Recruitment opens doors to educational opportunity 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
Desi Small-Rodriguez '07 grew up
in rural Montana, on the Northern
Cheyenne Indian Reservation in
Lame Deer. Stanford was not on her
radar. But after she met a Stanford
admission officer at a Native
American college recruiting confer
ence, the University paid for her to fly
to California and visit campus.
Were it not for Stanford's efforts to

reach out to her as a high-achieving
Native American student, Small-
Rondriguez said she might never have
considered applying to the University.
"I would probably never be at
Stanford," she said.
Though the undergraduate admis
sion rate has hit record lows over the
past decade, Stanford's Native
American student population has
grown steadily. Ihe University attrib
utes this increase to recruitment and
outreach efforts by the Admission
Office in conjunction with the Native
American Community Center
