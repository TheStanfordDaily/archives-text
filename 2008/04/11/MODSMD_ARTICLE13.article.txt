## Stanford reaches out to Native applicants Recruitment opens doors to educational opportunity 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
Desi Small-Rodriguez '07 grew up
in rural Montana, on the Northern
Cheyenne Indian Reservation in
Lame Deer. Stanford was not on her
radar. But after she met a Stanford
admission officer at a Native
American college recruiting confer
ence, the University paid for her to fly
to California and visit campus.
Were it not for Stanford's efforts to

reach out to her as a high-achieving
Native American student, Small-
Rondriguez said she might never have
considered applying to the University.
"I would probably never be at
Stanford," she said.
Though the undergraduate admis
sion rate has hit record lows over the
past decade, Stanford's Native
American student population has
grown steadily. Ihe University attrib
utes this increase to recruitment and
outreach efforts by the Admission
Office in conjunction with the Native
American Community Center
(NACC) and the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO), an
umbrella organization for the many
Native student groups on campus.
Next month, Stanford will begin a
joint recruiting campaign with the
admission offices of Columbia and
Cornell Universities targeting Native
American reservations throughout
the U.S., according to Stanford

Director of Admission Shawn Abbott.
"Stanford is ahead of other top uni
versities in the numbers of Native stu
dents and graduates," said Greg
Graves, the University's Native
American Graduate Recruiter and
Retention Coordinator, in an email to
ITie Daily.
A record 3.3 percent of the Class of
2011 is comprised of Native American,
Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian
students. The total Stanford under
graduate population is comprised of
approximately two percent Native
American and Alaska Native students.
Less than one percent of graduate stu

dents at Stanford self-identify as
Native.
Since 2000, the number of Native
American, Alaska Native and Native
Hawaiian undergraduates at Stanford
has increased by approximately 50
percent, according to the University.
By contrast, the African American and
Latino undergraduate populations at
Stanford have fluctuated in size with
less dramatic increases.
In 2006, American Indians and
Alaska Natives represented slightly
less than one percent of the total pop
ulation of the U.S., according to data
from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Stanford's Office of Admission
employs staff members charged
specifically with graduate and under
graduate Native American student
recruitment as well as a diversity
recruitment intern assigned to Native
American outreach efforts. The
Admission Office hired its first under
graduate Native recruiter in 1992 and
its first graduate Native recruiter in
1981. The office engages in extensive
outreach to Native students admitted
to Stanford, including a Native phone
a-thon in which current Native stu
dents speak directly with admitted
Native Americans.
Mark Johnson-Hammer '11, who is
half-Navajo and identified himself as
Native American on his application to
Stanford, said he received handwritten
letters from the Admission Office,
postcards from the Native community
at Stanford and information about the

NACC and Native guidance programs
nearly every week after being accept
ed last spring.
"It was really welcoming," he said.
Eric Lau 11, a Native Hawaiian
from Hilo, Hawaii, also recalled post
admission phone calls, letters and post
cards.
"Knowing that there's a supportive
community," encouraged him to
choose to accept his admission to
Stanford, Lau said. In contrast to
Stanford, the other California schools
to which he applied "didn't reach out
at all."
"The strength of the Native com
munity on campus is what often draws
prospective Native applicants to
Stanford," said Adrienne Keane '07,
an undergraduate admission coun
selor and the Native American under
graduate recruiter in the Admission
office, in an email to The Daily.

In addition to post-application out
reach efforts, the University also
recruits Native applicants throughout
the year at Native academic confer
ences and college fairs.
Last June, Stanford hosted the
College Horizons program, a five-day
workshop for high-achieving Native
American, Alaska Native and Native
Hawaiian high school students.
College counselors and admissions
representatives from colleges and uni
versities across the country participat
ed.
"Stanford is well-known in Native
communities as an institution with a
strong cultural community and a com
mitment to the student services neces
sary for the academic advancement of
Native people," Keane said.
