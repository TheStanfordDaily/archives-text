## Editorial Board Arrogance about IHUM 
### 
Every year, the constants of the Stan
ford experience roll around like the
changing of the seasons; a capella
groups tour dorms, people streak Full Moon
on the Quad and the freshman class in
evitably complains about having to take
IHUM", PWR and GERs. Of all the pre
dictable happenings on the Farm, however,
this last one seems to be the most unneces
sary.
The excuses and complaints are nothing
new; the administration and the upperclass
men hear them every year: "I'm a great
writer, why should I have to take PWR?"
"IHUM is a waste of time. I don't learn any
thing." "This engineering GER is stupid —
I'm a history guy and I'm never going to
build skyscrapers," ad infinitum.
We've all been there — it's almost a rite
of passage to complain about all the classes
required for a freshman, but it's a tradition
that we would do well to discard. First, there
is a clear distinction between criticism and
complaints, line current academic schedule,
especially for freshman, is far from perfect.
Criticism, therefore, is not only welcome but
necessary in order to contribute to the con
tinual evolution of academic programs into
ever more beneficial academic tools. There
is, however, a big difference between con
structive feedback and the entitlement com
plex of many Stanford freshmen. Unfortu
nately, the latter seems to have become the
norm.
It's easy to understand where the self-im
portance and arrogance comes from. We.
members of the Stanford student body, all
share similar stories: we are successful, intel
ligent and hard-working people — that has
a lot to do with why we're here. We've in
vented machines, written books, won

Olympic medals and climbed mountains.
However, what we as a student body and as
individuals need to do is add a little humility
to that list of qualities and achievements.
No class that you take at Stanford is going
to make you dumber or eliminate knowl
edge. You are not going to come out of PWR
a worse writer than you go in. you will not
come out of IHUM with worse critical ana
lytical skills than before and you certainly
won't come out of an introductory physics or
ethics course understanding less about the
subject at hand.
No, the classes are not perfect and yes,
students should provide input and feedback
both to their professors and the directors of
the respective programs. Complaining about
the uselessness of the course, however, ag
gravates and disrespects not only the profes
sor and the institution but also fellow class
mates who may actually be interested or in
vested in what is being taught.
As Stanford students we need to realize
that these systems, programs and require
ments exist for a reason. Both PWR and
IHUM receive positive feedback from up
perclassmen who are a year or two removed
from the program. For every underclassman
who complains about writing the next criti
cal analysis paper, there is an upperclassman
that is thankful he was taught how to do so in
the first place.
As smart as Stanford students are, the
majority of the people who teach us and
manage this University are even smarter,
and these individuals believe that the pro
grams such as IHUM and PWR are in our
best interest. It's time we help them in their
work to make this University better for
everyone rather than spending our time pro
claiming our own perceived superiority.
