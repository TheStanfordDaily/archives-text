## SF sold itself out on Olympic torch relay 
### 
When the Olympic torch passes
through town, it's supposed to re
semble a presidential motorcade: a
slow progression through a large, spirited
crowd. The recent torch relay through San
Francisco, however, seemed more like a kid
napping out of a Hollywood movie: after a
brief appearance on its scheduled route, the
torch was suddenly bustled into an anony
mous-looking van and driven to an un
known location. Only the vague communi
cations of the kidnapper, in this case SF
Mayor Gavin Newsom, let us know about
the torch's whereabouts.
1 don't even understand why SF bothered
with the torch in the first place if it wasn't
even going to show it. No one was benefited
by hiding the torch — not the city, not the
protestors and not the thousands of people
who just wanted to glimpse this special ob
ject.
All of this was ostensibly to ensure the
safety of the torch bearers from the protes
tors, who were also attending the relay cere
mony. The SF police department cited the
disruptions that broke out in London and
Paris as another reason to hide the torch.
But this is complete bullshit. Hundreds of
police can't protect a few torch carriers? If
the SF police can handle thousands of
drunk, belligerent bastards on New Years
Eve, I think they can handle any disruptions
that might occur on a torch relay. If people
had done more than peacefully protest, then
the cops could have done what cops do best:
beat some fools down. Hell, you don't even
have to use much force to contain the crowd.
SF police are some mean-looking mothers
— most people would think twice before
doing anything too crazy
The fact that the city kidnapped the torch
is shameful on several other levels as well.
Many people say the anti-China protestors
taint the "purity" of the Olympics. But,
again, a load of bullshit — the Olympics are
a tangle of politics. Yeah, it's about the virtue
of athletics and bringing the world together,
but it's also the best venue to showcase a na
tion's power. Cold War anyone? I'm pretty
sure countries didn't and don't pump mil
lions of dollars of training and drugs into
their athletes for the purity of sport.
Along the same vein, people also say that
the Olympics are not a proper venue for air
ing one's grievances. What is the best venue
then? The Olympics are actually an excel
lent venue to stage protests — even if peo
ple don't care about your cause, they can at
least be made aware of it through the
Olympics' worldwide reach.

There's a lot of controversy over China
hosting the Games, and for good reason —
China has an absolutely horrible human
rights record. And everybody from the
Olympic committee to the average citizen
needs to remain aware of that fact. I don't
believe in boycotting the Games or
metaphorically slapping China in the face,
but I definitely do support embarrassing the
hell out of China over their many wrongdo
ings. And protesting during the Olympics is a
worthy way of doing this.
I personally think that the drama sur
rounding the torch relay makes it that much
more interesting to watch. Long-winded pa
rades are boring anyways, so why not spice it
up a bit? I would have loved to have watched
the torch making its way through London, a
beautiful cacophony of shouting, cheering
and people getting arrested left and right.
One guy even tried to put the torch out with
a fire extinguisher! Now that's a true test of
Olympic perseverance and spirit.
The SF city officials sold out on this
episode of the Olympic torch relay. SF is a
city made famous for its progressive stance
on everything from the Vietnam War to gay
rights. Yet the city has robbed people of their
legitimate right to air their grievances by
kidnapping the torch away. If the torch can
make its way through all that mess and still
remain lit. then we'll really value its journey.

What's your Mission Impossible-type plan for
extinguishing the torch? Entail dirtycalstu
