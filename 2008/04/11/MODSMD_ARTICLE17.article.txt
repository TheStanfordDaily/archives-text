This past spring break. I found myself
once again flying on the great spectacle
that is Southwest Airlines. Hie tickets
were cheap, which harmonizes well with my
philosophy of "cheapest is always best." But
for those of you not in the know. .Southwest is
a little bit different.
The biggest, and perhaps the only, differ
ence is that unlike other airlines. Southwest
does not bother with assigned seating. In
stead of 26A (which for some reason hap
pens to be my assigned seat on almost every
airline that deals in seat assignments and al
ways happens to be the seat near the wing of
the plane), your ticket has a marker of
where you are to stand in line before enter
ing the plane. And once you enter the plane,
you are free to sit wherever you choose. The
dynamics this creates, however, speaks un
fortunate volumes about what it means to
be human.
Unassigned seating brings out the inver
sion of all that is and should be. A man in the
aisle is greeted with a quaint and cheery,"My,
you're fat." Ordinary phrases, such as "How's
the weather?" are left out of everyday tactful
airline passenger communication in the rush
to find and secure a preferable seat.
As passengers file through the plane
doors, they enter the cold and unforgiving
wilderness. The free-for-all seating, though
designed for passenger convenience, brings
out in man his most carnal sensibilities. De
volving to the likes of some early hominid. his
seating decision reflects a hard-line, utilitari
an survivalist urge. Decisions are made after
one look in the eye of your fellow cavemen

â€” crying baby, dirty hippy, unkempt octoge
narian. For every seat left empty there is a
story, of which the key to understanding is the
simple casting aside of all good taste.
Ordinarily, an attractive female sitting
alone near the aisle? Must have some com
municable illness. Alternatively, she must
have a hoard of insatiable crying children in
the seats behind her. Bright-eyed college
youngster? Must smell bad. Older woman
reading a romance novel? Must be an older
woman reading a romance novel.
Of course, the order in which you enter is
of utmost importance. As in the wilderness,
the first of the flock gets best pick of his do
main. The all-powerful lion wisely chooses
his stomping grounds, and the gazelle is
forced into his clutches by cruel Fate. Those
unfortunate enough to lie far enough down
the food chain, forced to enter late, are most
certainly destined for the intestinal tract of a
hungry predator.
The clear solution here is to pick as your
seatmates the towering personages of the
emergency exit aisle.These are the self-right
eous heroes of our age, the selfless and dedi
cated stalwart champions of the modern air
line. Unlike other airlines, in which inhabita

tion of this coveted aisle is a mandatory con
sequence of a computer algorithm, South
west's emergency exit aisle is populated by
the brave, the proud, the few. Having taken
upon themselves the welfare of an entire
plane of individuals, they have proven their
outstanding worth as human beings.Their so
phisticated sense of civic duty is a welcome
contrast to the jungle around them. As the
flight attendant approaches to ask if they are
aware of the responsibilities required by law
of those in this seat, her words are patently
unnecessary. No matter the fact that they
might very well have wanted the extra
legroom, these men and women are Ameri
can heroes in their own right.
Given that I was one of the last to board
the plane, my choices were extremely limit
ed. 1 ended up in front of two young children
and next to an older woman reading romance
novels. My seatmate to the other side (for,
predictably, 1 had been relegated to the
feared Middle Seat) was a businessman who
extolled the virtues of a life of entrepreneuri
alism. He recommended that I drop out of
school and use my parents' money to instead
invest in Coca Cola stock.
I escaped from my stay on the Serengeti
that is Southwest Airlines, but not before 1
had seen the darker side of human nature,
the inevitable consequence of non-assigned
seating.
