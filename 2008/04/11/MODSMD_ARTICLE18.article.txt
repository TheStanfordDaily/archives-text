Please do not post flyers on the trees in
White Memorial Plaza or any other
trees on campus. Wednesday night I re
moved scores of flyers, posters and advertise
ments from the trees in White Memorial
Plaza.The flyers were for student groups, aca

demic departments, individuals and commer
cial entities. Misusing trees in this manor is
clearly prohibited in the guidelines for the use
of White Memorial Plaza. The guidelines can
he found on the web site of the Office of Stu
dent Activities, http://osa.stanford.edu/re
servingspace/whiteplaza.shtml
Herb Fong, the Manger of Grounds Ser
vices, and his entire staff, work hard at devel

oping and maintaining this incredibly beauti
ful landscape where we all study, work, live
and play. Posting directly on trees and other
landscaping is harmful to the health and
beauty of our campus environment and it is
disrespectful to those who labor to keep it
healthy and beautiful.
I recycled all the collected materials in the
proper bins next to the post office. Check out

Prize in Recycle Mania 2008, a recycling com
