## No. 10 Cardinal travels to Corvallis to take on resurgent Beavers 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After facing and overcoming the No. 1
team in the country last weekend at
Sunken Diamond, Stanford baseball will
now look to continue its recent success
against the nation's best when it takes on
two-time defending national champion
Oregon State in Corvallis.
The No. 10 Cardinal (15-10-1,4-2 Pac
-10) took two of three games last weekend
from then-No. 1 Arizona State before
struggling in a pair of midweek games on
Monday and Wednesday against No. 7
California and UC-Davis.
The Cardinal tied the Golden Bears, 5-
5, in 13 innings, and lost to the Aggies 9-8
in 12 innings after blowing an 8-6 ninth in
ning lead. There has been a developing
trend of strong play on Saturdays and
Sundays and disappointments on week
days for the squad. Stanford is 10-0 on
Saturdays and Sundays but just 5-10-1 in
games played the other five days of the
week.
It is certainly an exciting prospect,
therefore, for the Cardinal to get to return
to the field against the two-time defend
ing national champion Beavers (15-10,3-
3). Conference standings will again be on
the line as Stanford enters the series in a
three-way tie with Cal and ASU for first in
the Pac-10 with a 4-2 record against
league opponents, while Oregon State is
one of three other teams just a single
game back of the conference leaders'
pace.
Stanford will be looking for its tenth

straight series victory this weekend but
will have to overcome a spate of recent
failures against the Beavers: the team has
dropped ten of its last 14 against OSU, in
cluding a 1 -7 record dating back to 2006.
The Beavers' starters have struggled to
start the 2008 campaign, with Friday's
likely starter. Mike Stutes, currently car
rying a 4.50 ERA and a 2-4 record. He is
allowing opponents to hit at a .289 clip
against him. Another likely starter on the
weekend, Jorge Reyes, has started even
slower, posting a 7.26 E R A (and a surpris
ing 2-1 record) in seven starts.
The Beavers' starters have been better
of late, though, as Stutes has allowed just
two runs over his last 17 innings of work
while Jorge Reyes pitched 6.2 innings
against Cal on Sunday, allowing just five
hits.
Offensively, senior infielder George
Drew leads the Beavers with a .390 aver
age and .480 on-base percentage. Sopho
more catcher Ryan Ortiz and junior in
fielder Jason Ogata are not far behind,
boasting .378 and .376 averages, respec
tively. Ogata has hit a team-high four
home runs on the year while Ortiz leads
the Beavers with a .610 slugging percent
age.
For the Cardinal offense, the 2008 sea
son has seen juniors Cord Phelps at sec
ond base, Sean Ratliff in center field and
Jason Castro at catcher come alive at the
plate.
Phelps, who has served as Stanford's
leadoff hitter for the 2008 campaign, has

tical tug-of-war for the team lead
that has been going on all season.
He's hit eight home runs, has 26
RBls and a .690 slugging percent
age, while Castro is close behind

both extra-innings affairs. The first game was a tie against California on Monday; the second, a loss to UC-Davis on
