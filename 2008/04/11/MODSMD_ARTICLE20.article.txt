## Crunch time for Cardinal Stanford embarks on its final road trip of the season 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
If there's one thing the No. 3 Stanford
women's tennis team can forget about this
season, it's playing on the road.
Without doing so, the Cardinal women
would still be perfect.
But this weekend, Stanford will travel to
Eugene, Ore. for its final away match of the
regular season against No. 46 Oregon.
"I think we're really excited about it â€”
only one match on the road which is really
nice," senior Celia Durkin said. "We need to
focus on one match and one match only. It's
great to have our last road match coming up
before NCAA's and get it out of the way."
This season. Stanford is 5-3 on the road
and 2-1 on neutral grounds. All four of their
losses have come away from the Farm, where
they are a perfect 130-0 in the last eight years.
Tlie Cardinal women are coming off an
emotionally draining three-game homestand
in which they successfully defended their
homecourt against Pac-10 rivals Southern
California and UCLA.
Their most recent victory came in a 7-0
shutout of No. 44 Sacramento State, in which
fatigue had seemingly permeated from the
outset of the match.
"Sacramento State has some good players
on their team and they came ready to go,"
Durkin said. "USC and UCLA were really
competitive matches and it takes a bit of time
to regroup from that. For me personally.com
ing out took a bit of time to regroup from the
excitement of the weekend."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal women appear
rejuvenated for a title run after a disappoint
ing loss to Arizona State over Spring Break.
The match-up against Oregon will be one
of three final matches before Stanford heads
into postseason play.
Following the Pac-10 Championships in
Ojai, Stanford will see if they are one of 16
schools selected to host the NCAA tourna
ment.
Certainly, a homecourt advantage in
NCAA's will certainly favor the Cardinal.

GAME NOTES: Stanford is perfect at home but 7-4 away
from Taube Tennis Center; this is their last road meet of
the season. Stanford freshman Hilary Barte is on a 14
match win streak. Stanford beat Oregon, 7-0, last
year.
ITie team is currently 26-0 in NCAA Tour
nament matches played at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
"It's always nice to play at home and it'll
definitely cheer us up and give us confi
dence," Durkin said. "1 don't think it's too big
of a factor. It's nice to play at home because
you don't have to travel but we can play just
as hard and do just as well on the road."
This year, the Ducks have undergone an
even more drastic roster change than Stan
ford.
With five freshmen on the squad, Oregon
has had an average year with a 10-10 overall
record and a 3-3 mark in conference play.
Last year, Stanford demolished the Ducks
7-0 despite missing then-sophomore Jessica
Nguyen from the lineup.
Coming into last year's match-up, Oregon
had cracked the top 30 in rankings.
This year, Oregon has had an up-and
down season. After two straight wins against
the ranked Washington State and Washing
ton.the Ducks were blanked against USC
and UCLA.
Oregon is led by freshman Celine Roily,
the lone ranked player on the squad at No.

78.
"Oregon is a strong squad who beat Wash
ington pretty badly," Durkin said. "We never
take a team lightly. 1 think that we're definite
ly getting up for it and they have good play
ers. but we have total confidence that we're
going to beat them."

Though the Cardinal lineup has under
gone much change from past years, it appears
to be as strong as ever, with the top four con
tributing to major wins in the last week.
Playing at the No. 1 spot, freshman Hilary
Barte has been tearing up the competition
with a 14-0 win streak, earning her Pac-10

Player of the Week honors.
Following Barte is Nguyen, who has
shown a re-emergence of form after an injury
left her without her two-handed backhand
for weeks.
