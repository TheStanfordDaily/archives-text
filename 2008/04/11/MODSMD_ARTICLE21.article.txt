JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
The Cardinal will take on the Huskies in their final home match of the season as Pac-10 play winds
down, making each and every match ever more crucial for both Stanford and Washington.
stretch of conference opponents.
Washington is 13-7 on the year
and 1-3 in Pac-lOplay. Like Stanford,
all their losses have come to teams
ranked in the top 25. They have two
ranked singles players. No. 82 Patrik
Fischer and No. 97 Jeevan Ne
dunchezhiyan. Senior Andy
Kuharszky is also a veteran to the
lineup and is a doubles specialist —
he was also named Pac-10 Player of
the Week earlier this season. The
Oregon Ducks are 11-11 on the year
but are winless in conference play.
They have a talented No. 1 singles

player in Marcos Verdasco, but he
has been admittedly underachieving
this year.
"We know these are big matches,
the final Pac-10 matches," Whitlinger
said. "[They] can really make a dif
ference as to where we might be put
in the NCAA tournament."
Whitlinger is referring to the
NCAA seeding process, which could
award Stanford a more favorable
draw if they can capture these last
matches and finish both the Pac-10
and overall season with a winning
record.
But the NCAA Tournament can
wait — Stanford is not going to look
past this weekend. Whitlinger point
ed out that both Washington and
Oregon have played well this season
and have picked up big wins

throughout.
"We are just trying to get better
[as a team]" Whitlinger said. "We
made a goal at the start of Spring
Break to win all our home matches
for the rest of the season."
That goal is still alive. A home
sweep this weekend and the Cardi
nal will have accomplished its goal.
"We are looking forward to the
challenge that Washington and Ore
gon will bring," he added.
The match against Washington
begins at 1:30 p.m. today at theTaube
Family Tennis Center. Tomorrow's
game against Oregon, the Cardinal's
last home match of the season, be
gins at 1 p.m.
