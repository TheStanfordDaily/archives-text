# WOMEN'S WATERPOLO
## Stanford readies for the "Big Splash" Cardinal keeps rolling through its schedule; takes on Cal, Irvine 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The end of the regular season is often a difficult time for sports
teams to concentrate. The grind of a long season can wear players
down mentally, and with conference and national tournaments just
around the corner, teams sometimes look past their few remaining
regular season games.
The Stanford women's water polo team, however knows it does
not have that option. They will have to remain at the top of their
game this weekend as they host two fellow top 10 teams — No. 6 Cal
ifornia and No. 8 UC-lrvine.
Up first is Cal on Friday at 7 p.m., in a game known as "Big
Splash." Stanford and Cal have already met once this season, during
the group stages of the Stanford Invitational back in February. Stan
ford used a big 5-0 second period to take control of that game, and
the Cardinal was also strong in 6-5 situations as it scored six goals
with the extra attacker, cruising to an 11-6 victory.
The Bears' record now stands at 15-8 overall and 6-5 in the MPSF.
Their conference mark may be deceptive though — three of their
five conference losses have been by a single point, and a fourth was
by a two-goal margin. So even though their recent run of form may
not be that impressive. Cal is still entirely capable of springing an
upset, especially in a rivalry game.
"Cal is a very talented, deep team that our team enjoys compet
ing against," said Stanford coach John Tanner. "Big Splash will be ex
citing."
After Big Splash on Friday night, the team will take on UC-lrvine
on Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m.The Card has not played the Anteaters
yet this year, but they can expect a tough challenge from the No. 8
team in the nation. At 13-8 on the year and 4-5 in the MPSF, Irvine's
record is actually similar to Cal's.
They too have lost some heartbreakers over the course of the sea
son, including two one-goal defeats at the hands of San Diego State.
Unlike the Bears, however, the Anteaters seem to be on the upswing.
After their second loss to San Diego State on March 7, Irvine reeled
off four straight wins, including a thrilling 10-9 victory in four over
times over then-No. 8 Arizona State and another conference win
over Cal State Northridge. While their win streak was snapped last
weekend by a 13-9 loss at Hawaii.Tanner is still wary.
"Irvine frustrates teams with its defense," he said. "[They have]
been improving the last month."
In order for Stanford not to be frustrated offensively, the team
will look to break on the Anteaters, not allowing them to get back
into their defensive positions. Although the Card's offensive output
went down a hit this past weekend,
they are still in the midst of their
best goal-scoring run of the season,
hitting double figures in seven of
their last eight games.
The team is also on a season-long
eight game win streak.The last time
the Cardinal lost was over a month
ago, a 9-7 defeat to UCLA.
This weekend's matches are also
significant because they will be the
final regular season home games for
seniors Jackie Gauthier and Megan
Nesland. Both Gauthier and Nes
land have been key contributors to
the Cardinal's great success over the
past four years, and even though
there is still about a month left in the
water polo season, one last Big
Splash victory would be a great way
to start their send-off.

Stanford hasn't lost in over a month and is scoring goals seemingly at will. They will face Bay Area-rival California in
"Big Splash" this weekend, as well as UC-lrvine, as they try to keep their season-long eight game winning streak alive.
