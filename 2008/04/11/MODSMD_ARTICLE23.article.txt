## Kornfeld named Swimmer of the Year 
### 
Junior Paul Kornfeld was named
Pac-10 Swimmer of the Year, while
his teammate, freshman Austin
Staab, was selected as the Pac-10
Newcomer of the Year at the confer
ence's award ceremony on Thursday.
Kornfeld had a season for the
ages. He won the 100 and 200 breast
at both the NCAA and Pac-10
Championships — and was named
the Pac-10 Swimmer of the Meet at
the latter. At the NCAAs. he set the
school record in 100 breast. He also
was part of the 400 medley team that
set the Stanford record in the event.
Staab won the 100 fly at the Pac
-10 Championships and swam with
Kornfeld on the same record-setting
400 medley team. An earlier time in
the 1 (X) fly tied the school record set
by Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who won
the Pac-10 Swimmer of the Year
award last season.
Both Kornfeld and Staab helped
Stanford win their 27th consecutive
Pac-10 championship and a third
place finish at the NCAAs.
Cardinal women close out home
schedule
The women's golf team will host
the Peg Barnard Collegiate Invita
tional this weekend at the Stanford
Golf Course. It will be the team's
final home tournament of the year.
The Invite will only be a two-day,
36-hole affair, which is one round
shorter than a normal tournament.
Stanford won by three strokes last
year, prevailing over Denver. Sopho
more Catherina Wang placed in
fourth at the event, with an even 142.
The No. 29 Cardinal will face a
wide, 13-team field that includes No.
19 California and No. 39 San Jose
State. The field, though geographi
cally diverse, is not particularly diffi
cult — certainly not as tough as the
opponents the Cardinal faced last
weekend at the PING/ASU Invita
tional. Stanford placed 14th at that
event.
The team looks for a better result
at the Peg Barnard Collegiate, which
begins today.
Track ready for Big Meet
The Stanford men's and women's
track and field teams will take on Cal
at this weekend's "Big Meet."
The Stanford men won last year's
Big Meet, 88 to 75. On the women's
side, Stanford has dominated Cal,
winning 18 out of 28 meets all-time.
Garrett Heath, the West Regional
Athlete of the Year and top finisher
in NCAA Indoor Championships,
spoke about his finish at indoors and
his aspirations for the outdoor sea
son.
"Finishing fourth [in the mile) was
good, but I know 1 was in shape to run
faster and should have finished high
er. I guess it gives me some things to
work on for outdoors," he said.
Heath hopes to focus on the 1500
meter run for outdoors but may also
compete in the 800 and 5.000 meter
runs.
The Cardinal men and women
have already accomplished several
regional qualifying marks and will
quite possibly accumulate several
more this weekend. They are look
ing to send as many athletes as pos
sible to the Outdoor National
Championships.
