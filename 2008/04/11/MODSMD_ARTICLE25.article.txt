## Obama reinstates California delegates 
### MICHAEL R. BLOOD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Facing a back
lash from supporters, Barack Obama's presi
dential campaign reversed course Thursday
and reinstated hundreds of people to lists that
will be used to choose California's delegates
to the Democratic National Convention.
Campaign manager David Plouffe said in
a letter to potential delegates that all names
would be restored to ballots that will be used

Sunday to elect the delegates, overturning
the earlier decision. "We are confident
that delegates elected from this pool will
reflect the senator's commitment to a diverse
and unified delegation at the national con
vention," Plouffe wrote. "An overwhelming
number of supporters have signed up to run
for delegate, so there will likely be lines and
tight space at the caucus locations. We ask for
everyone's patience and cooperation," he
said.
Earlier this week, Obama's and Hillary

Rodham Clinton's campaign took advantage
of party rules to purge scores of potential del
egates in a bid to ensure that only their loyal
ists travel to the August convention in Denver
where the party will anoint a presidential
nominee.
Most of the cuts, about 900 names, were
dropped by Obama, leading supporters to
complain that they had been unfairly exclud
ed. Clinton's campaign dropped about 50
names from its list of prospective delegates.
The names were culled without explana

tion from the campaign or the state party.
Party caucuses scheduled for Sunday will
elect a slate of delegates for each candidate -
134 for Clinton and 107 for Obama, for a total
of 241. More than 2,000 candidates are run
ning statewide.
Driven by fears that some prospective del
egates might be concealing their true alle
giances, the campaigns searched campaign
finance data, scoured the Internet and made
telephone calls to weed out people they
believed to be dubious candidates.
