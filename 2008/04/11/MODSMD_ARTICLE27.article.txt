## "THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE": CHIC, UNIQUE AND QUITE ADORABLE 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE INTERMISSION MODERNIST 
Ram's Head's stage adaptation of the 1967
film-musical "Thoroughly Modern Millie" is
bursting with talent and energy, bringing the old
classic to life for modern viewers. With its bril
liant score written by Jeanine Tesori and clever,
original lyrics written by Dick Scanlan, the mu
sical is already worth seeing. But Ram's Head's
production is especially worth seeing. Michael
Rhaney, the producer, and Allison Portnoy, the
director, do brilliant jobs of putting together a
spectacle no one will want to miss.
Millie Dillmount, played by Taylor Thi
bodeaux, is a young girl from Kansas who moves
to New York during the Roaring Twenties to
leave her small-town ways behind and embrace
the life of a modern New York girl. She mistak
enly thinks that a modern girl must forsake love,
and she plans to marry rich, fearing that she will
be forced to live the life of her unhappy mother
and grandmother.
Although Thibodeaux often comes off as
timid in songs, her voice is beautiful and fits the
role. The shyness and hesitance in her musical
performances is sharply contrasted by confi
dence in her dancing, stage movement and dia-

logue. The duality actually adds an extra layer to Millie, who pre
tends to have it all figured out but who is still trying to find her
place in New York.
Thibodeaux is not the only talent to keep one's eyes and ears
on. She is accompanied by a wonderful cast of fun, charming ac
tors with powerful voices. Miss Dorothy, the sweet, naive girl
who quickly becomes Millie's best friend, is perfectly portrayed
by Laura Stampler, whose clear, operatic voice brings the char
acter alive. Stampler's timing is especially on point, leading to a
number of the musical's many comedic moments.

The show's male leads are charmingly acted by Benno Rosen
wald as Mr. Trevor Graydon and Brett Hammon as Jimmy, Mil
lie's love interest. Hammon makes a fun Jimmy who is charis
matic and a pleasure to watch. Rosenwald's powerful singing
voice, skillful dancing and comedic timing are especially capti
vating. The character of Trevor Graydon becomes as funny and
real as that stern, male figure everyone seems to meet at least
once in their lives.
"Modern Millie'"s chief villain — and chief humorist — Mrs.
Meers, is played by a confident and comical Olivia Haas. She

adds much sexiness to the role, making the
already fun character even more fun to
watch. Although the role is acted brilliantly,
some of the funniness gets lost in Haas' quiet
speaking voice and subtle movements. She is
truly a spectacle, though, during her song
performances. Her voice is strong, and her
dancing is full of talent and sex appeal. Her
portrayal of the mean Mrs. Meers is perfect
and one of the highlights of the Ram's 1 lead
production.
A talented cast is only one of the many
things that pulled "Thoroughly Modern Mil
lie" together. Amy Jacobson's choreography
was playful and energetic, adding to the
mood of the play. The dancing really brought
the audience to the excitement, fun and
sometimes silliness of the 19205. The dances
were well executed by the cast and ensemble
members, creating many moments when the
audience couldn't resist the urge to tap their
feet.

What really brought the musical to a supe
rior level, though, was the orchestra. The
music helped to carry along the story and set the tone for every
moment and scene. The song execution was tight, precise and
professional. The orchestra could have stood alone, and the
show would still be worth seeing. That's how crucial the pit was
to the success of the play.
Millie Dillmount has a lot to learn when she arrives in New
York. She finds that even a modern girl can't say no to love. 1 ler
journey is sweet, comical and one truly worth seeing.
