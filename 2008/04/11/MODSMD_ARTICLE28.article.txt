If the Millennium proved anything (aside from the fact that the only thing stupider than
Y2K was email forwards about Y2K), it's that there is no simple bridge to cross to get to
THE FUTURE. The future isn't unlocked by a single calendar year or piece of badass
technology. We are currently living in the future; the future will never come.
Still, there have been technological advances over the past few centuries that must have
made the people who experienced them wonder whether they were on the brink of the
mythical future, where people work less, are happier and have finally tamed nature.
Whether the past was truly in the past.
1 Icre arc a few moments from bygone years at which it seemed THE FUTURE had fi
nally come.
1.4 million BC, give or take: Man tames fire. Pros: Convenient source of heat and light
at night; no more mastadon tartare; campfire songs. Cons: If it rains, you're screwed; can
actually see the woman's face during those BC booty calls.
14th - 17th centuries: European Renaissance. Dudes painted some naked women,
churches got an extreme temple makeover and Da Vinci skulked around all of Europe
planting secret clues that, properly uncoded, would lead to the single worst literary traves
ty in cultural memory.
December 1953. First issue of Playboy Magazine published. The inaugural chapter of
the visionary magazine that would introduce the masses to the writing of Jean Shepherd,
Marion Hargrove. P. G. Wodehouse. Oh, and porn.

1969: Moon landing. Some people believe this was fake. These are the same people who
believe in the sanetity of professional wrestling. (Yeah, I'm looking at you, Charleston,
North Carolina.)
1985: Mass production of Bagel Bites. It's PIZZA! On a BAGEL! PS: You can eat it â€”
ANYTIME.
1988: First version of Photoshop released. Finally the internet makes good on its
promise that you can "LOSE WEIGHT LOOK GREAT NO DIETING OR WORK
ING OUT!" Of course, the results only work on the internet.
1994: Fanny pack comes into fashion. Finally a traveler can carry his wallet, camera and
map while keeping both hands free.
Later in 1994: Fanny pack goes out of fashion. Come on, guys.
December 31,2000: Dawn of the new millennium. No great shakes, but Lenowas okay
that night.
2007: First black presidential candidate picks up steam. Republicans scramble to get
presidential veto adjusted to three-fifths of a vote. (Ye Olde Articles of Confederation
Joke. Holla!)
December 23, 2012. Mayan calendar ends. The world follows suit? Goodbye, the fu
ture. Hello smug New Age purgatory.
