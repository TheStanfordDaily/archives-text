## Tomorrowlands 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION UTOPIA UMPIRE 
It's 2008. I don't own a single robot, I've never been to a moon
colony, and I've just about given up on hoverboards. Yet still I
dream about the various futures that great thinkers have envi
sioned for us-fanciful Utopias and frightening dystopias alike.
This week, Bracketology's mission is to decide which of these so
cieties is, for lack of a better word, the coolest. The future is in my
hands.
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. "1984" vs. 16. "Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century"
"Zenon" is a Disney Channel classic. But if George Orwell
knew I was even thinking about picking it over "1984," he would
take me by the scruff of my neck, drag me into Room 101, cram
rats down my throat and kick the doubleplusungood crap out of
me. Zedis Lapedis!
EDGE: "1984"
8. "Children of Men" vs. 9. Charlton Heston Movies
"Children of Men" presents a haunting scenario in which the
entire globe's population becomes infertile. But listen to some of
the crap Charlton Heston (R.1.P.) has had to deal with in his fu
turistic movies: a world in which people secretly eat each other, a
society of intelligent and bloodthirsty monkeys and a beastly, un
relenting Michael Moore. Okay fine, only two of those are future
movies. Still.
EDGE: Charlton (licks.
5. "2001: A Space Odyssey" vs. 12. "Back to the Future: Part
II"
In "Back to the Future II," Marty McFly's sports almanac
claims that Florida wins the World Series in 1997—which really
happened—even though the Marlins didn't actually exist when
the movie was made. Strange but true —I like it. Contrastingly,
"2001" ends with the main character turning into a giant stupid
star baby for no reason. What?
EDGE: Back to the Future.

4. Utopia vs. 13. EPCOT Center
Utopia is Sir Thomas More's idea of the perfect place, yet the
roots of the word mean "no place," which is quite badass. EPCOT
was supposed to be Walt Disney's version of Utopia but, as al
ways, when you Disney-fy something, it loses its soul. I'm pretty
sure Walt didn't think that his ideal society would ever feature
"The Seas With Nemo & Friends."
EDGE: Utopia.
3. "The Matrix" vs. 14. "V for Vendetta"
Which Wachowski brothers film features the more compelling
vision of the future: the one starring the guy wearing a mask, or
the one starring the guy whose face moves less than a mask? I'll
take the red pill. Keanu for life.
EDGE: Matrix.
6. "The Giver" vs. 11. "Ender's Game"
Two books. Two genius boys. Innumerable lame sequels. My
arbitrary snap judgment: "The Giver." (1 like the version of the
book with the old guy on the cover. Sometimes that's all it takes.)
EDGE: Giver.
7. "Blade Runner" vs. 10. "Totall Recall"
The Adaptations-of-Philip K. Dick-Novels Bowl! It all comes
down to the characters. "Blade Runner" has Harrison Ford, mu
tant dwarves and replicants. "Total Recall" has Ahnold, more
mutant dwarves, a guy with a fetus head in his chest and a three
breasted stripper from Mars. Verdict? "Recall." That extra boob
is key. Men everywhere concur.
EDGE: Total Recall.
2. "The Jetsons" vs. 15. "An Inconvenient Truth"
"The Jetsons," while noteworthy, got me way too hyped about
flying cars. And Rosie doesn't obey any of the Laws of Robotics.
Plus, Elroy just sucks. I'm going to pick the upset and go with A 1
Gore's disturbing (and all-too-likely) scenario of global warming
("An Inconvenient Truth" also gets bonus points for somehow
making A 1 cool).
EDGE: Inconvenient Truth.
ELITE EIGHT

1. "1984" vs. 9. Charlton Heston movies
The concept of always being watched is actually more terrify
ing than having ape masters spray you with high-pressure water
hoses. Slightly.
EDGE: 1984.
12. "Back to the Future 11" vs. 4. "Utopia"
"Utopia" needs roads. "Back to the Future II" doesn't.
EDGE: Back to the Future 11.
3. "The Matrix" vs. 6. "The Giver"
The Giver would kick the Oracle's ass.
EDGE: The Giver.
10. "Total Recall" vs. 15. "An Inconvenient Truth"
Hmm, let's see... A 1 Gore the political loser telling us the Earth
is gonna die? Or Schwarzenegger the political winner bringing
oxygen to Mars? My job has never been so easy.
EDGE: Total Recall.
FINAL FOUR
1. "1984" vs. 12. "Back to the Future II"
Big Brother meets his match in Alternate 1985 Universe Biff.
The man killed Marty's Dad. bagged Marty's mom and, boy. can
he predict a horse race or what?
EDGE: Back to the Future 11.
6. "The Giver" vs. 10. "Total Recall"
What "The Giver" lacks in boobs, it makes up for in confusing
yet-somehow-rewarding endings.
EDGE: The Giver.
CHAMPIONSHIP
12. "Back to the Future II" vs. 6. "The Giver"
I used to think hoverboarding was the coolest thing of all time,
but now I realize that what's even more awesome is being the re
cipient of all human memory.
CHAMP: "The Giver."
MVP: Hypothermia-induced happiness.
