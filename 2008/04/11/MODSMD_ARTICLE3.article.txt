## Bruins, Anteaters descend on Farm Stanford to face UCLA, UC-Irvine on Senior Weekend 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's volleyball team will pay
tribute to its seniors this weekend as the Cardinal
wraps up conference play at home. Tonight Stanford
takes on No. 6 UCLA while tomorrow's Senior Night
will feature a match against No. 7 UC-Irvine.
Outside hitters Matt Ceran and Jesse Meredith
will play at home for the last time this weekend before
the MPSF conference tournament begins next week
end. Ceran is second on the team in kills in his senior
season and third in the Stanford record books in ca
reer kills and career digs and fifth in career digs in the
rally-scoring era.
"Their experience, especially in practice late in the
season, has motivated and inspired the younger guys
to keep getting better," head coach John Kosty said of
his seniors. "That has put us in the position where we
are able to control our own destiny in the playoffs."
Coming into the final week of conference play, the
Cardinal has clinched a spot in the eight-team MPSF
tournament and is currently in a three-way tie for
sixth place with Irvine and No. 10USC. Depending on
this weekend's outcomes around the league, the Car
dinal could conceivably finish anywhere from fourth

season winds down, they will try to assert their dominance again both Ore
gon and Oregon State, two of the worst teams in the conference.
