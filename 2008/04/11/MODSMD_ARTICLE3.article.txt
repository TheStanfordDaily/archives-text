## Bruins, Anteaters descend on Farm Stanford to face UCLA, UC-Irvine on Senior Weekend 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's volleyball team will pay
tribute to its seniors this weekend as the Cardinal
wraps up conference play at home. Tonight Stanford
takes on No. 6 UCLA while tomorrow's Senior Night
will feature a match against No. 7 UC-Irvine.
Outside hitters Matt Ceran and Jesse Meredith
will play at home for the last time this weekend before
the MPSF conference tournament begins next week
end. Ceran is second on the team in kills in his senior
season and third in the Stanford record books in ca
reer kills and career digs and fifth in career digs in the
rally-scoring era.
"Their experience, especially in practice late in the
season, has motivated and inspired the younger guys
to keep getting better," head coach John Kosty said of
his seniors. "That has put us in the position where we
are able to control our own destiny in the playoffs."
Coming into the final week of conference play, the
Cardinal has clinched a spot in the eight-team MPSF
tournament and is currently in a three-way tie for
sixth place with Irvine and No. 10USC. Depending on
this weekend's outcomes around the league, the Car
dinal could conceivably finish anywhere from fourth

Stanford has survived the toughest part of its Pac-10 schedule, and, as the
season winds down, they will try to assert their dominance again both Ore
gon and Oregon State, two of the worst teams in the conference.
to eighth, while No. 4 Long Beach
State, No. 2 Brigham Young and No.
3 Cal State-Northridge battle for the
top spot.
"We are really excited to be back
in the playoffs," Kosty said. "The pro
gram is on track and we are doing ex
actly what we need to do to compete
nationally and in the MPSF. It is
great to be back."
With a record of 15-10 overall and
an even 10-10 in conference, the Car
dinal hopes to finish strong against
UCLA (16-12,11-9) and Irvine (14-
13,10-10).
"We are looking to get back on a
winning streak," Kosty said. "We
clinched a playoff position and
achieved one of our goals, but not
our top goal. We are still looking for
ward and looking to improve. We
know how tough the MPSF playoffs
will be.
"If we want to get to the Final
Four, we will need to go through
some tough opponents, starting with
this weekend," Kosty added.
The Cardinal opened its confer
ence season with the same teams it
will face tonight and tomorrow, los
ing to UCLA in four games and then
beating Irvine, also in four. Stanford
also beat Irvine in five games in a
preseason tournament.
"We are a much-improved team
since the second week of January,"
Kosty said. "We are more consistent
and are playing at a much higher
level, but so is the entire league."
Last weekend, the Bruins beat
No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara in four
games before being swept by North
ridge.
Garrett Muagututia is the Bruins'
offensive leader with four kills per
game, while Sean O'Malley chips in
3.6 per game. Muagututia is also the
team's top server with 25 aces and is
second only to libero Tony Ker in
digs. Jamie Diefenbach anchors the
UCLA net defense with 99 blocks on
the season.
"UCLA seems to have settled on
a starting lineup and they are playing
very good volleyball, better than
their record indicates," Kosty said.
In the January match, sophomore
outside hitter Evan Romero had a
match-high 22 kills for Stanford
while Muagututia led the Bruins
with 15. UCLA outblocked Stanford
15-6 in that match, behind seven each
for Diefenbach and Weston Dunlap.
Irvine comes to Stanford off of
two straight wins over Northridge
and Santa Barbara, in four and three

seven-block performance against
Northridge and 15 kills against the
Gauchos.
"He is their opposite hitter and on
any team the opposite is usually the
most important player, getting the
majority of sets, especially in point
scoring situations," Kosty said of
Stellar. "We did not play against him
earlier, we just saw a little bit of him,
but he is a starter now and playing
well and we will need to respect
that."
Stellar and Cory Yoder lead the
Irvine offense and Stellar is also the
service ace leader. Kevin Wynne has
a team-high 102 blocks and Brent
Asuka leads the Anteaters with 229
digs.
Ceran led the Cardinal with 19
kills in a preseason victory over de
fending national champion Irvine
and led again with 18 in the rematch
win a week later.
"Irvine is also a different team
than when we saw them â€” they have
different personnel on the floor,"
Kosty said. "They play a faster style
of offense than UCLA, so we will see
two very different types of teams this
weekend."
Tonight's match with UCLA will
be Disco Night in Maples with to
morrow's Senior Night taking place
in Burnham Pavilion. Both matches
begin at 7 p.m.
