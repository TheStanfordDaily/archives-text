## It's a brave new world out there, and I, for one am terrified 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION FOGEY 
I really, really don't want to get old. It's not that
1 fear grey hairs, that I'm too attached to my eye
sight or that I never want to lose my grip on the
world-is-my-oyster viewpoint that is the property,
inherently and almost exclusively, of the young; 1
just can't stand the thought of looking like an
idiot.
Allow me to explain: almost a dozen times,

over the last five or six years,
my mother has asked me how
to copy and paste a Microsoft
Word document into an
email. "Highlight the docu
ment," 1 say, "then hit Con
trol-C. Now click on the e
mail. and hit Control-V." In
my words and my demeanor,
I am the picture of patience.
In my head, I am asking my
self, Dear God, how can this
woman he failing, lime and
time again, to grasp such a
simple concept? Didn't you

graduate from Stanford,
Mom? Didn't you teach high school biology? So
how hard can it he for you to carry out what is per
haps the least complicated task in the history of
word processing?
Frustrating as it so often is that our parents are
like toddlers fumbling about in the world of com
puting, we have to be compassionate. After all, it
will be us someday who are throwing our hands up
in disgust and calling our eight-year-olds to talk us
through how to holo-chat with our relatives on
Alpha Centauri, or tell our robot cooks how to
grill our tofu steaks just so. And so we treat our
parents with kindness and sympathy, if only out
of the knowledge that, someday, we will appear
equally foolish.
Of course, some might argue that our genera
tion is better prepared to handle the changing
face of technology than were the Baby Boomers. '
After all, when they were young, computers were :
the size of couches, and the Internet was some
thing not even dreamt of. In comparison, we were
raised in the age of the cell phone and the global
network, so we have within us a basic understand- '(
ing of technology that will serve us well in the ef- I
fort to keep up with the times. Still. I can't help
but think that it will soon be beyond most of us to
fully grasp the nuances and capabilities of the ■
next generation of communications devices, i
Even now, I find myself slipping behind the 1
teenage trends: my younger brother checks 1
You Tube every day to keep up on what viral ®
videos arc new and hot. I just watched "Old
Greg" for the first time last week (if you don't
know what that is, well, then you're in the same
position as I am). When, at 20 years old, I'm al-

ready months behind the cultural Zeitgeist, what
can I expect to happen by the time I'm 50?
So I have resigned myself to the fact that I will
one day be as clueless as my mother, and so should
all of you. The only thing I wonder about now is
what exactly 1 will be clueless about — that is,
what technology will look like 50 years down the
road. When I was in high school, we had an inven
tor/futurist come in to talk to us about the cool
stuff that's just around the bend. He discussed the
headbands we will all wear, which will be able to
access our brain waves and convert them into an
electronic signal that will project an image onto a
small screen over our eyes. Through them, he said,
we will be able to connect to the Internet, instant
message our friends or even play video games just
by thinking about them. He also explained how all
our clothes will be woven with nanofibers, so that
instead of rifling through our closets to pick out
the perfect outfit, we can just use our thinking
bands to imagine what we want to wear, and the
clothes will come to us!
Thank God. If there's one thing about modern
life that's troubled me to no end, it's the fact that I
physically have to touch my clothes in order to put
them on.
Of course, no matter how many self-satisfied
hacks will predict that the next generation will live
to be 900 years old, or that we'll all fly around on
supersonic rocket-boards, nobody truly knows
what technologies will become essential to life in
the near future. All I can say for certain is that,
whatever technology is like in our adulthood, we
probably won't understand it. Good thing global
warming's coming to wipe out civilization as we
know it; spears and smoke signals are technology
I can really get behind.
