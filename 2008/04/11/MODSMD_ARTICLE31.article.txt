## Dear 2008 Resident, 
### 
Greetings. I write you from the future. From MAX McCLURE
I'U bet you're surprised to hear that. "How could I possibly receive a letter from the future?" you
may ask yourself. Do they use wormholes? Some sort of ray? Is the US Postal Service now so slow
that it runs backwards? Hardy-har-har. Nice attempt at observational comedy, douchebag. In the
future, that sort of insensitive joke would expose you for the ignorant jerk that you are. The real an
swer is that we get all the Chinese to run in the same direction, thereby reversing the earth's rota
tion.
You are shocked. You fall silent. Perhaps you are intimidated by my futuristically sophisticated
ways, or by the enclosed photo of me doing this one chick from behind. Your reaction is understand
able. The future has advanced far, far beyond your present in every measurable way, with the pos
sible exception of hockey, which we find to be frustratingly low-scoring. Also, ice no longer exists.
You shouldn't feel bad about your inferiority. We future-men are so very highly evolved that to
refer to us as "human" is hardly accurate. I, for instance, am part robot, part Eloi and part Jewish,
meaning that I am prohibited by law from playing in a reggae band. Of course, when I say "reggae"
I refer to something completely unrelated to your limited use of the term. Reggae in the future is
dominated by accordions and overdubbed speeches from Eastern European presidential candi
dates and is primarily played at greyhound races in order to anger the dogs.
But you must be wondering what it's like, living in the future. First off, get this straight — we fu
ture-men obviously don't call it the future. We call it"the fyootch," which is shorter and therefore
more efficient. But to answer your question: it's bitchin'. To demonstrate this, a list of great things
from the future follows:
Time travel
Jetpacks
Alpacas

Venusian sunsets
All poor people wiped out by mysterious virus
One free Jamba Juice
And the list of benefits goes on. Not to say that there aren't disadvantages to living in the future
— we live lives of such absurd excellence that we frequently experience an all-consuming ennui only
curable by a night with the 20-limbed whores of the Caloris Basin. Plus, Jetpack fuel smells like
cookies, which is great, but sometimes you get sick of cookies.
This brings me to the one big question you must currently be nursing: "Why is someone from the
future writing me? They are intelligent, and we are stupid. They are handsome, and we are ugly.
They are highly evolved, and we wallow on our dung heaps like apes." These are all good points. In
fact, you could add others, like your poor hand-eye coordination or your halitosis. But none of that
is relevant right now because, as it turns out, you do have something we don't have: $32.50. That's
how much a pack of Marlboros costs these days. $32.50! Jesus Christ! 1 know — the filters better be
made of shredded twenties. But that's the future for you.
So what I'm suggesting is something of a trade. You, 2008 resident, must collect $32.50 and hide
it in between pages 315 and 316 of the San Francisco Public Library's copy of Heinrich Pestalozzi:
Father of Modern Pedagogy. Alternately, you could just jam a bunch of cigarettes in there.
If you do this for me, you will experience the long-lasting satisfaction of having aided one of your
descendants — one of the children for whom you are stewarding the world through its many crises.
Do what you know is the charitable thing — if not for me, then for your conscience. And if you don't
give me the money, I'll come back there and have sex with your mom. I just have to rope up the Chi
nese first.
Futuristically,
Keith Richards
