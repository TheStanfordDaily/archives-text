# Dear Future Self,
## 
### 
From CHELSEY LITTLE

Over and over again you read "The Little Prince," your favorite; you were moved so easily by its
simple poetry and delicate characters. You were moved by everything you read and heard. And
you desperately wanted to move others. You would often speak of the importance of passion, or
affecting a change in others, for good or bad, you didn't care which because you knew you could
n't really control which, you just wanted to be remembered. That was interesting.
You were so starry-eyed then. 1 wonder if you are now. Or has life weighed you down? Let's
hope not. You had every reason not to be optimistic then — life wasn't exactly easy for you, even
if you were lucky enough to be a Stanford student. Times were bad, sometimes, but you always
managed to still give freely of yourself, even when you thought you had nothing left to give. That
was a good choice, friend and I'm sure it served you well.
You may laugh at how sure I seemed to be back then. But it was just a part of who I was. Never
sure of the present, but always sure of the future. Funny. Funny you thought the future was the
one thing you could be sure of, the one thing you could control. In a sense, I guess this was true
— you determined each step and path you took, but the events that would unfold beyond that,
you had no idea. But I bet it worked out fine.
This simple portrait I've given you of yourself is so you will remember and know what you
were and to remind myself now what 1 never desire to cease to be. Grow, by all means, change,
morph, learn, live, cry, die when it's time, but please don't ever forget, while there is breath in
your body, that life is worth living. Even when all the world says "No," says this planet is dying,
that we should pick up and leave and go to Mars, that people are destroying each other, etc. etc.
Please don't be jaded by such reports. 1 can't really tell you why life is worth living, but I know
that it is. So just believe me. And remember. And show me why.
You always,
Chelsey Little
