In the past two centuries, thinkers devoted quite a hit of energy to predicting the future.'With varying degree of success. Manyplaced OieiYpnedjction's in the wofidrouis future: bptween 1950 and 2900.
Some of these predictions were eerily close to the truth*while others were ridiculously, mind-blowingly, cajastrophically incorrect. Here is.<Tl.ook"hjick cfosome of the best and worst&redictions of the.
near future: . * . •" #• » , .

• I he pioneer ol science fiction is remembered for his prophetic-imagination. "2.000 Leagues. trJhder the Sea" basically envisioned the mod
ern submarine. Meanwhile. "From the Earth to the Moorl" featured "a moon gun" that shot in a giant bullet from Earth to its satel
lite. Not too different from the Apollo launches, reallv. ' • V* *

' I lis novel "Paris in the 20th Century," though, is in a league ol its own. In this novel, written'in 1863, VernMuvisumed the lile ol a Parisian
in (gasp!) 1%(). Among the shocking technological marvelsoT the future were boxes that lilted people tall
the modern elevator), a "photographic teleifraph" that sent images across the world (television, more or less) and giant concerts of amplified]
music (the L' 2 concert). • * • " .:

Best ol all. Verne wrote that "ol the innumerable cars that passed on the paved roads, most moved without hofsgk..flney are propelled
by jin in\ isible force, the force of 20-30 horses, by means of .1 motor-run by gas combustion." He. in other the modern Juto-j
mobile about 25 years before their invention. Whoa. $ j

Finally, this chestnut of prediction describes how the man of the future conquered the raiftftfests: "Ajungle road is built in one contin
uous operation? First a searing ray of light, the laser beam, cuts through the trees. Then a gitipt mSf a factory on wheefs — grinds
up the slumps and jungle growth: sets the firm foundation: forms the surface slabs?sets-them iu plltfce — and the roadway bed is paved."
At last, roan "has lound a w ay to penetrate and to control the wild-profusion of this wonder-world."

2(H) 1: A Space Odyssey
The I%S film is famous for many things, but correctly predicting the future is not one of them. Among its many
predictions are space stations, long space flights and the triumphant emergence of a giant, planet-sired human fetus.

Most tamous ol all. perhaps, is HAL. the creep A.J. made, according to the movie, in Illinois in 1997. This super

where in the world and 1 can pattse live T,V! That's right, humanity; We finally made it. The Future N Now*

Or is it'.' After all. if there's one thing we can learn from the Nazis, it's that we should never "assume.'
( I here aru actually a lot of things we can learn from the Nazis, like how you should never trv to take
over the WHOLE world, or how when opening the Ark of the Covenant, close your eyes. But I di-
gress.) First, let us take a look at all of the reasons-why this is NOT the future:
%
2. No lasers. Sure we have laser pointers and laser discs and fiber optics and flashy stuff like that, but we have vet to de-l
velop a blasterpistol. This makes it extremely.diTficult to be a space pirate. .* \
. • 3. No space pirates. And we call ourselves a society. «
' . 4. We still have a lot of trees. How have we maintained the rainforest for so long? Is that "Save the Rainforest" campaign
actually working.' The earth looking so green makes Joni Mitchell look like a liar. They paved paradise, rtiy ass! I still can't lind a place jo park my
' car! • . . .

: "Alright, so there seem to he quite a few compelling reasons why this is NOT the future) But what's the other side of it?
Where is the evidence that this IS the future? Well, it's right here:
1. Virtual reality. Sure, we ditched the concept of that whole visor thing, hut thaudoesn't stop us from meeting up # with*our '
night elf friends'on a. Saturday night ;wid cruising main street on white tigers' Just think, hack in the '80s. they would have
thought that was referencing drugs. ,
2. W*e almost have a black president. Nothing says"The Future" like a black president. Sure, the nomination might go to
Hillary, and even it it doesn't. McCain might win. but that's just because most of America hates "The Future." Just look at our
clothing. {Now. take a look at Germany's clothing. Eh? Seeing a correlation?)
•3. Space hasiweomt' "old hat." You know it's "The Future" when space exploration-is known as the adorable hobby of a
■Ltired pop-star.''V?v • •
|v 4.1 here is a drug No one dies ol consumption afiymore. Nowadays everything is either cancer. HIV
i*or heart disease.-Only thTec,things? Thai's so boring! So to spice it up. wi* just call everything a disease and then
. invent a drug to cure it.W'e have a pill that qtriefji noisy«£hiklren and a pill that cures backne. Men are swallowing pills to make their'
penises hard while their wives are taking pills tp feel numb and sleepy. Pharmaceuticals are a sham, and that in itself is a good sign that
we've Futurii." I mean, back when they discovered penicillin, do you think anyone thought this would happen?
