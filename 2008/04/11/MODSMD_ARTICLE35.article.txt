## Next-Dimension Inventions 
### AISHA WELLS INTERMISSION EINSTEIN 
The distant future. That sounds so
intimidating, doesn't it? Like it should
be in all-caps, or something. Usually,
talking about the future makes me
happy, and, you know, very hopeful. 1
think to myself, "Maybe one day in
the future I'll be rich; maybe one day
I'll be super famous; world peace;
etc." The truth of the matter is that the
next couple of years are not looking
too good. With global warming and
all, who knows what might happen?
Even though the Earth's rising tem
perature isn't really supposed to af
fect us for another couple of centuries,
don't forget "The Day After Tomor
row." What if it's not just a movie...?
(Cue Twilight Zone theme.)
Anyway, my personal belief is that
the world (well America, at least) is
bound to become even more superfi
cial than it is now. It's true. I'm sure
you were thinking of time machines
and flying cars, but no, we'll probably
end up building beautiful people from

scratch before attempting that whole
"Back to the Future" thing. Plus, it's
always kind of interesting to read
about what people in the past thought
would happen in 2008. So, in continu
ation of that tradition, here are three
perfectly plausible ideas for how we
might stay looking great — or at least
make sure those working for us do.
Robot Models
This may not seem important ini
tially, but there has been a lot of re
cent controversy about the pressure
put on fashion models to be stick-thin.
As if females don't already have a list
of reasons to hate their bodies, popu
lar designers have decided that not
being a size 0 is one of them. You Tube
any couture house fashion show, and
watch the skeleton procession for
yourself.
The main downside to this — be
sides starving, coked-up young fe
males — is that many well-known su
permodels have some of the same life
aspirations as everyday wbmen (what.

really?). Take Russian catwalker Na
talia Vodianova for instance. Though
still popular, she originally achieved
fame as the gaunt. Eastern European
face of Gucci's perfume line. Fast-for
ward a couple of years later: she has
three small children and is not-so-po
litely asked to lose weight. Keep in
mind that at this time her waist mea
surement, as a new mom, was 27 inch
es. While you sit back in shock at the
fashion industry's nerve, rest assured
that the future holds an answer that
will benefit both designers and fam
ished models: robots. Yes, robotic
mannequins that can walk and strut so
well Naomi Campbell might pitch
a(nother) fit. There are multiple rea
sons why this would be an awesome
idea.
First of all, both the models and de
signers would not have to worry about
stressful fluctuations in weight. Cast
ing directors for runway shows could
simply request a series of model-bots
with 23-inch waists and 5' 10" frames,
while the real-life models focus on
print ads and editorials where their
"imperfections" can just get air
brushed away. Secondly, designers
wouldn't have to fret over their mod
els getting old. You know, like turning
25. A robot's appearance is complete
ly static. No wrinkles, no saddlebags,
nada. And of course this opens the
door for all those programming
techies out there secretly leafing
through "Women's Wear Daily"
under the sheets late at night.
A Time Machine, duh
This is a pretty obvious choice. It's
for when aging celebrities want to re

live their glory years. We know it's
never going to happen, but it's fun to
wish, right?
The Fountain of Youth
The world is already extremely
image conscious (hence the practical
ity of the model-bots), so why not give
people nearing middle age what they
really want? Sure, there are those who
age gracefully, and those who love to
pontificate on the consequences of
ageism, but, seriously, I wouldn't be
surprised to see bottles of anti-wrin
kle cream arranged in their medicine
cabinet. It's just like the women who,
in a dazzling variety of body types,
posed in their undies for Dove's feel
good ad campaign about "real"
women. I personally liked the idea of
not having only animated corpses
plastered across billboards, but I think
they missed the part about the ad pro
moting Dove Intensive Firming Lo
tion. I suppose Dove's actual message
was "Of course we love real women

— just not the ones with cellulite and
rolls." Despite the fact that women of
all ages can have visible dimpling on
their legs, most people erroneously
associate youth with taut, toned skin
and fat-free figures. No wonder cos
metic surgery is on the rise.
My guess is that the Fountain of
Youth will come in either of two
forms: an actual spring discovered on
an exotic island location, thereby
sparking a war even the oil barons
would have to get in on. Or, scientists
will end up copying the details of a
person's physical and neurological
makeup while they're still young so
that by the time they reach the peak
mid-life crisis years (28,29 — when 30
gets a little too close), they can easily
have a replica made of themselves at
20. And since their brains will be ex
actly the same, they can simply termi
nate their older selves and glamorous
ly relish such defiance of nature!
Think that sounds messed up? I bet a
time machine that people would sign
up for it in droves.
