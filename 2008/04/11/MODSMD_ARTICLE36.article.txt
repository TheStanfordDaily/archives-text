### WEIQI SAMANTHA TOH INTERMISSION YAELIE 
Ever since Steve Jobs hand-picked "New Soul" to advertise the Mac√üook Air in 2008, Yael
Nairn has shot to fame. "New Soul," the first single released from the album, scored a #7 position on

the US Billboard Hot 100 in February 2008, and great excitement has since been
generated over the potential of this Israeli singer-songwriter and her new self-ti
tled CD.

The ruckus, however, should not bely the nature of Nairn's charm, which lies
in the tender simplicity of her tunes and lyrics. Nairn's arrangements are remi
niscent of Jack Johnson, with the same calming tempo and unadorned back
ground instrumental. Although she does utilize a rich combination of strings in
a number of her songs ("Levater" and "Shelcha," for example), her accompani
ment never veers into the dramatic. Aside from the wonderful jazz piano back
ground in "Pachad," "Yael Nairn" is impressive for the way the focus manages
to remain constantly on the richness of her voice.

The husky quality of Nairn's vocals is a cross between that of Regina Spektor
and Rachael Yamagata. Though very consistent throughout the album, Nairn's

voice never gets boring due to contrasts with the layered textures of her compositions.

"New Soul,"
for example, is a
pop tune that
opens with a line of
low staccatos on
the piano. What
gives the song
depth, however, is
the contrast be
tween these dis
connected bass
lines and the way

her voice sustains a tender melody across the verses and chorus. The amalgamation of the compo
sition articulates a complexity that makes the listen an enduring, interesting one. In contrast, "7
baboker" and "Lachlom" emote sadness through understatement. Once again, it is Nairn's voice
that rises above the company of a single guitar line. The listener focuses on the direct intertwining
of guitar and voice, sometimes interrupted by very subtle bongo rhythms.

What makes "Yael Nairn" surprisingly enjoyable for me, however, is the architecture of her
lyrics. Although not always the most creative (falling into the trap of cliched longing more than
once!), Nairn makes up for it by flashes of compelling poetry, be it in Hebrew, French or English.
We are willing to overlook the overused "I've been waiting too long / Not strong enough to be with

you" in exchange for the original and endearing images she uses. "I irrigate il
lusions/Then let them grow" ("Too Long") and the naivete of "1 came into this
strange world / Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take" ("New
Soul") are such examples. The slightly awkward, accented English she uses also
contributes to the charm of the album.

Though each song shines in its own way, perhaps the star of "Yael Nairn" is
Nairn's cover of Britney Spears's Grammy Award-winning "Toxic." While al
ready covered by many, such as Nickel Creek, Marillion and Hurra Torpedo,
Nairn reinvents the song with a very distinctive arrangement. Using a range of
percussion and string instruments, she turns a sex-bomb pop hit into a piece of
yearning that reeks of the uncanny. Nairn's "Toxic" has the bizarre quality of
Bjork, but remains somehow grounded in her earthly vocals, much like a home
ly Alice in a very peculiar Wonderland.*

Overall, the CD is more than a little pleasant. Ranging from soothing to delightful, Nairn's sec
ond release is quite deserving of the stir it has caused. Although she claims that, since coming here,
she has "felt the joy and the fear / finding [herself] making every possible mistake," "Yael Nairn"
certainly proves otherwise. Far from a mistake, this record will, at the very least, make an impact on
the easy-listening crowd, and has enough promise for us to expect even better in the future.
* An alternative, live performance is also available on You Tube. Her performance for the Fes
tival de Piano utilizes progressions that arc far more haunting and mysterious. The clip also demon
strates the intensity of her voice better than her album does
