## Future Sex/Love Rots 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION ROBOT RUBBER 
When Roxy was just a little girl,
thoughts of the future usually consist
ed of a mix between "The Jetsons"
and "Star Trek." Now that she's less
innocent, a romp with Captain Jean
Luc Picard is about as much as Roxy
ever thinks of Star Trek. Being wooed
by Patrick Stewart circa 1994 is not an
offer one could refuse â€” nor should
one.
As hot as a session aboard the En
terprise sounds, Roxy can't help but
wonder what the sex of tomorrow has
in store for us. If we can make hydro
gen cars and iPhones, it's only natural
that we will one day have some high
tech shagging.
The first thing Roxy learned from
sci-fi is that robots are the way of the
future. If they are, it would be cruel to
make the blasted things anatomically
incorrect. Really, we'd be doing
everybody a disservice. Pleasuretron
3000, anyone? A sexybot is just what
the doctor prescribed! Just think
about it. Mr. Pleasuretron can come
with an array of interchangeable
dongs, one for each occasion. Boys,
worry not, for there is also a Plea
suretron for you! She can be just as
customizable as her manly counter
part. Both models come with a never
tiring extra-strength tongue to get at
those hard to reach places. And the
best part is these intelligent little bots
get to clean themselves up and store
themselves under the bed while you
puff that post-orgasmic ciggie away.
But Roxy, you might ask, what can
we use if we're out of town and I can't
check my 2001b sexybot at the airport
as luggage? My comrades, don't de
spair! The mighty Hitachi Magic
Wand, the king of vibrators, will be no
match for what the future has in store.
Advances in implants are paving the
way for the all-mighty ecstasy giver.
You and I will be able to have our

very own insta-orgasm implant.
You're probably thinking, instawhat?
Well, it's quite simple. When the
urges within strike, the best way to
take care of them will be from within.
Just by thinking about it, shock waves
from the brain will enable tiny genital
implants that'll rock your socks. No
more will we have to deal with the
roommate who disturbs that self-lov
ing session. Want a longer session?
Just adjust the setting! With its nifty
Bluetooth function, you can get it on
to the beat of your favorite naughty
tune straight from iTunes. Best of all,
it's completely hands-free.
Gotta love them sex toys, but
what's hotter than two people bump
ing and thrusting? (Besides three of
four people bumping and thrusting,
of course.) People-sex! Although
Roxy has yet to meet someone who
has mastered the entire Kama Sutra,
it wouldn't hurt for sex to evolve some
more. How about multi-tasking?
The hip kids these days are all talk
ing about sustainability. If you've
ever had the kind of sex that leaves
you exhausted for days, you know it
takes some effort. Why not harness
the power of the romp? Well, we just
might be able to. Think tree-hugging
meets fucktastic. Whilst you go at it
till the cows come home, you could be
coming up with the energy 10 power
your Prius or that special vibrator for
the afterparty.
Roxy summons all of you product
designers and mechanical engineers.
There's no need to design any more
pens or toupees. Your people need
you. Google-shmoogle! Try your for
tunes in the sexy-toy industry instead,
ant 1 actually fulfill those dreams of
yours to makes millions of people
happy. And if that doesn't work for
some odd reason, we'll have to call
them aliens for an encounter of the
third kind. After all, Roxy's all for
saying she lost her heart (and pants)
to a starship trooper!
