### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION SCALE SAMPLER 
In the future, there may be no fish
left in the ocean, so now is the time fill
your quota of mercury-laden seafood.
Rumor has it that when you walk into
Cook's Seafood & Market, a fish mar
ket and restaurant on El Camino Real
in Menlo Park, the seafood is so fresh
that you can't even smell it. Accord
ingly, Cook's has the reputation of
being one of the best places on the
Peninsula to pick up anything form
whitefish to black mackerel to cook
for dinner. And for those who don't
want to cook, there is the restaurant at
Cook's which offers simple — mostly
fried — preparations of a number of
their catches.
The signature item at Cook's is fish
and chips. However, to order just
"fish and chips" with no further speci
ficity would be insufficient as, despite
what many pubs and diners would
have you believe, there is more than
one type offish in the world. In gener
al terms, the fish in an order of fish
and chips is cod, and this is certainly
an option at Cook's. But a variety of
other fish is available, as well. The
choices may vary daily with the catch
but can include ahi tuna, snapper, cat
fish and halibut.
To begin with, all of these fish are
sure to be fresh and will usually be ex
cellent in themselves. However, the
preparations do not entirely do justice
to the quality of the fish. On the more
conservative side was the halibut.
One benefit of the serving style at
Cook's was that, prior to frying, the

fish was cut into roughly two-inch
cubcs, rather than being fried as a
large, flat slab. This allowed for a
crispy exterior while still preserving
some of the natural taste and texture
of the fish.

Counting against them, however,
was the fact that the fish appeared to
have only been lightly coated in bread
crumbs, as opposed to a more heavy
batter before frying. Perhaps as a
place that takes its fish seriously.
Cook's didn't want to overwhelm the
flavor of the fish with rich fry, but the
problem is that the halibut alone was
not very tasty. Thus, despite the good

texture, something was definitely
missing.
Initially, I was skeptical about the
idea of fried tuna with chips. And
upon trying it, 1 learned that my skep
ticism was justified. Tuna, unlike hal
ibut. really doesn't need to be fried
because it tastes just fine by itself. So,
while Cook's light frying process in
this case was preferable to something
more traditional, the tuna probably
would have been better in the form of
sushi or a lightly cooked steak.
The fries served with either fish
were thick steak fries that packed

plenty of real potato, but were overall
just average.
On a side note, the clam chowder
provided no shortage of tasty, fresh
clams, but the remainder of the soup
was relatively watery and insufficient
to make it standout. Similarly, the
Dungcness crab salad included excel
lent crab, but was served over lettuce
that you might find at the Axe and
Palm.
At least a meal at Cook's is fast.
You order at the counter and receive
any soup or salad immediately. After
sitting down in the bland diner-esque
seating area, which includes a few ma
rine-related decorations, your cooked
items will be delivered in a few min
utes.
Ultimately, at Cook's it's about the
fish and nothing else. The overall din
ing experience certainly wasn't bad.

But it seems that in the tran
sition from a pure fish mar
ket to a restaurant, Cook's
watered down the overall
quality of its operation. So
at the end of the day, unless
you're really desperate for
some fried fish and ordi
nary cod won't do, it might
be best to think of Cook's as
simply a fish market and
not a restaurant.
