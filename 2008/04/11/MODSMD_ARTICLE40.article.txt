### DAN HIRSCH INTERMISSION SMART ALECK 
When the actress formerly known as Carrie Bradshaw and the actress for
merly known as Juno get to debating about the meaning of SAT vocabulary

words, you know you've stumbled into some weird vortex of self-conscious
cleverness (did you know that "eft" is the name for the terrestrial phase of i

a newt's lifecycle!?). This is one of the many unfortunate moments of.

slightly pretentious hut not altogether intelligent comedic stabs in "Smart
People," a film that poses as being darkly witty, heartwarming and^g

original, but fails on all counts.

Directed by Noam Murro and written by Mark Poirer, "Smart
People" tells the story of the widower 1-awrence Wetherhold (Den-

nis Quaid), a literature professor at Carnegie Mellon who has fall
en into a post-grieving state of bitterness and misanthropy. 1 le is es-

tranged from his children, the classically angsty son James (Ashton
1 lolmes) and the quirkily conservative and over-achieving Vanessa

(Ellen Page). But after a freak accident, the reemergence of an "adopt
ed" brother Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) and the beginning of a

new relationship with a former-student-turned-doctor Janet Hartigan
(Sarah Jessica Parker). Lawrence's life begins to change, and we are all be-

ginning to learn some lessons.

"Smart People" is neither funny nor engaging because it is populated by
flat reincarnations of character types found in this genre of small-scale, ir
reverent and bittersweet comedy (for a better quality example, see "Little I

Miss Sunshine"). What's even worse is that these smart
people are not very likeable. Underneath the thick, pro
totypical beard of an academic. Quaid's Lawrence is too •
cold and arrogant to win our affection. Parker's Janet is I
bland, to say the least. Page, as Quaid's high-achieving
and inexplicably neo-conservative daughter, lacks the
charm and innocence she brought to the screen inl

"Juno." There are moments when we get

glimpses of the sadness and mourning inside.

but. under the camouflage of quips and
banter, Vanessa comes off as perpetually i
hostile and irritated. Church as brother!

Chuck can be funny at moments, with his reptilian face and oddball sensibility
(in one weird moment of ridiculousness, Chuck calls Lawrence "as dumb as a
dumbass ant"), but one has the sense that he has been imported into the film
for the sole purpose of adding some much-needed goofincss to the sarcastic and
bleak world.

Poiricr guides his characters through various twists and turns. Quaid
and Parker go through a strained courtship of former student and
teacher, and Page and Church have a strange relationship of their
own. But it all ends up feeling tiresome and contrived because, at their
core, these characters arc false. Plus, there are one or two plot points
toward the end that feel especially silly. 1 won't ruin the end, but the

slide show during the closing credits is a display of cheesiness to

behold.

ments of orchestrated cleverness. "Smart People" docs throw
