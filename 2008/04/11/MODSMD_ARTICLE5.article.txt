# Cardinal prepares for long stretch run
## 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 8 Stanford Softball team will he
looking to build some momentum this week
end against Oregon State and Oregon at home
after grabbing its first conference win last
week against Washington.
The Cardinal (34-7, 1-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) will meet Oregon State (23-IS, 2-4 Pac
-10) today at 7 p.m. and will play Oregon (26-
16, 1-5 Pac-10) on both Saturday and Sunday
at Smith Family Stadium, getting a shot at two
other teams in the bottom half of the confer
ence after suffering through a brutal opening
schedule in the Pac-10.
That 3-1 win over Washington last Sunday,
however, could prove to be a turning point for
a talented Stanford squad that shot out of the
gate this season. The team can match its win
total from all of last season with just one victo
ry this weekend, and a host of Cardinal players
are powering towards record-setting offensive
seasons.
Sophomore catcher Rosey Neill, Stanford's
RBI leader, leads the Pac-10 in homeruns with
16 dingers so far this season, just three off the
single-season record on the Farm, set by cur
rent third baseman Michelle Smith in 2005..Ju
nior shortstop Maddy Coon has also improved
her batting average by more than 60 points
from last year to .314; coupled with 33 walks,
already a program record. Coon is getting on
base in more than half of her at-bats, at a .504
clip in the third spot of the batting order.
Neill and Coon will be trying to keep the of-

NOTES; Sophomore Rosey Neill leads the Fbc-10 with 16
homeruns. Oregon State's 2.81 staff ERA is the worst in
the Fbc-10. The Beavers are an aggressive and quick
team, as they have three players with 10 stolen bases
fense clicking against a pair of pitching staffs
that are ranked at the bottom of the Pac-10.
Oregon State is dead last in the conference
with a 2.81 ERA. while ()regon is close behind
at 2.20. Neither staff is getting great help from
their offenses, either â€” the Beavers and the

Ducks are ninth and tenth in the
Pac-10 in runs scored and batting
average, too.
The Oregon schools are not
without weapons, though. Ducks
sophomore outfielder Neena
Bryant is just behind Stanford's
Alissa Haber in the conference bat
ting standings, hitting .385. Bryant
also has nine home runs to her
name, the seventh-best total in the
Pac-10. Oregon also has two of the
top base-stealers in the conference
in Cortney Kivett and Sari-Jane
Jenkins. Kivett leads the Pac-10
with 30 steals and has only been
caught twice, while Jenkins has
chipped in with 20 swipes this sea
son.
Oregon State has three different
players with 10 stolen bases in 2008,
one of whom is sophomore Dani
Chisholm, OSU's batting leader at
.374.

Besides the chase for a 2007-
tying 35th win this weekend, Stan
ford's next win will be especially
sweet as it will mark head coach
John Rittman's 500 th career victo
ry, all of them with the Cardinal.
Rittman is 499-231-3 in 12 seasons
on the Farm.
