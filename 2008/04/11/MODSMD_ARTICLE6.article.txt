## Fuzzy menace a TO RETURN SOON University takes steps to help reduce their numbers 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Every returning Stanford student knows that
springtime on the Farm not only means beautiful
weather, classes held outside and three day weekends,
but also the emergence of thousands of Stanford's
infamous pest — the caterpillar.Though spring quarter
is well underway, some students like Cole Murphy-
Hockett '11 have found themselves wondering why the
caterpillars are nowhere to be found.
"When I came for admit weekend last year, 1 saw
millions of caterpillars simply hanging from the trees,"
Murphy-Hockett said. "Now that it's spring, I was won
dering when they will start to show up. 1 have heard so
many stories about horrible encounters with these
pests that 1 am definitely not looking forward to
them."
Iliough the caterpillars' arrival has been delayed
this year. Facilities Operations Manager Herbert Fong
said that the caterpillars are on their way.
"The caterpillars are still present but at a young,
smaller stage," said Fong. "They go through what is
called gradual metamorphosis to become a larger,
more visible caterpillar later in the spring."

Karen Stidd, Horticultural
Support supervisor for Facilities
Operations, said that the emer
gence and activity of the caterpil
lars is temperature or climate
related. So while the caterpillars
are not easily visible yet, closer
observation will find that some

have already been hatch
ing and emerging in trees.
"The caterpillars are

out there, but they are still quite 1
small and just beginning to chew
the leaves," Stidd said. "I believe
they are growing more slowly
this year because of colder
average temperatures this win-

ter. We know that as the weather
warms, any existing caterpillars will grow in size rapid
ly, and we are currently washing trees that show signs
of infestation."
The caterpillars found around campus are tussock
larvae that will eventually become moths, most com
monly the western tussock moth. After their eggs
hatch in February', the tussock larvae grow rapidly until

they
begin to pupate. Adult moths then emerge from the
cocoons, lay eggs and then die. This process is usually
completed in June, though the exact timing of the life
cycle varies from year to year depending on tempera
ture.

Though the caterpillars are native
to the Stanford campus, their growth,
as seen last spring, has often gone
unchecked. The massive springtime
proliferation of the caterpillars over
the past several years has caused
considerable annoyance and discom
fort among students, leading to anti
caterpillar Facebook groups boasting
hundreds of members and calling for
their extermination.
University officials, however, are
hesitant to implement such strate
gies.
"We do not use toxic sprays in the
control of these organisms in our
efforts in sustainability and environ
mental concerns," Fong said.
"Instead, we hope that our efforts of
power washing the over-wintering
stages of egg masses from last year

that will lead to lower quantities of
caterpillars this spring. This is proba
bly one of the least disruptive meth
ods that can be taken."
In addition to power washing, the
University intends to implement
their strategies to check the caterpil
lars' growth using predators.
"We have allowed natural preda
tors such as praying mantis and
predatory wasps, both [of] which nat
urally exist, to help control these
pests" Fong said."We have also been
supplementing their populations
with additional commercially grown
predators."
Fong notes that the populations of
caterpillars are cyclical, and at times
predatory populations are not ade
quate to control peak caterpillar
populations. Therefore. while
University measures to control the
caterpillar population were largely
unsuccessful last year. Fong is opti
mistic that the caterpillar growth will
be more controlled this spring.
"I do not expect populations to be

near the levels we experienced last
year because of our measures," Fong
said. "This last year we just had the
perfect conditions in some of the
most highly trafficked areas on cam
pus for these conditions to all come
together for one of the worst years
ever."
Despite Fong's assurances about
controlled caterpillar population,

students like Brianna Wilson '09 are
not looking forward to their arrival.
"I was so excited not to see any
caterpillars when 1 got back from
spring break this year," Wilson said.
"They are the only thing I don't like
about Stanford. A lot of tourists in
the spring ask me why there are so
many caterpillars around and 1 don't
know how to respond. I think the
caterpillars give tourists an inaccu
rate impression of campus."
Liberty Reforma '08 said that
while neither she nor her friends are
looking forward to the caterpillars'
return, she will not let the fuzzy men
ace dampen her last spring on the
Farm.
"Spring quarter will be fun
regardless of the caterpillars," she
said. "Though 1 am not looking for
ward to the caterpillars, as a senior, I
have come to see them as a natural
part of springtime at Stanford."
