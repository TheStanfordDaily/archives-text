## Fuzzy menace a TO RETURN SOON University takes steps to help reduce their numbers 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Every returning Stanford student knows that
springtime on the Farm not only means beautiful
weather, classes held outside and three day weekends,
but also the emergence of thousands of Stanford's
infamous pest â€” the caterpillar.Though spring quarter
is well underway, some students like Cole Murphy-
Hockett '11 have found themselves wondering why the
caterpillars are nowhere to be found.
"When I came for admit weekend last year, 1 saw
millions of caterpillars simply hanging from the trees,"
Murphy-Hockett said. "Now that it's spring, I was won
dering when they will start to show up. 1 have heard so
many stories about horrible encounters with these
pests that 1 am definitely not looking forward to
them."
Iliough the caterpillars' arrival has been delayed
this year. Facilities Operations Manager Herbert Fong
said that the caterpillars are on their way.
"The caterpillars are still present but at a young,
smaller stage," said Fong. "They go through what is
called gradual metamorphosis to become a larger,
more visible caterpillar later in the spring."

Karen Stidd, Horticultural
Support supervisor for Facilities
Operations, said that the emer
gence and activity of the caterpil
lars is temperature or climate
related. So while the caterpillars
are not easily visible yet, closer
observation will find that some

have already been hatch
ing and emerging in trees.
"The caterpillars are

out there, but they are still quite 1
small and just beginning to chew
the leaves," Stidd said. "I believe
they are growing more slowly
this year because of colder
average temperatures this win-

ter. We know that as the weather
warms, any existing caterpillars will grow in size rapid
ly, and we are currently washing trees that show signs
of infestation."
The caterpillars found around campus are tussock
larvae that will eventually become moths, most com
monly the western tussock moth. After their eggs
hatch in February', the tussock larvae grow rapidly until

they
begin to pupate. Adult moths then emerge from the
cocoons, lay eggs and then die. This process is usually
completed in June, though the exact timing of the life
cycle varies from year to year depending on tempera
ture.
