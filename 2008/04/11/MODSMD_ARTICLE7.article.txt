## Tibet torch relay rallies for freedom 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After the Olympic torch left San
Francisco on Wednesday, Stanford
became a stop on a different kind of torch
relay designed to advocate for Tibet.
The Stanford Friends of Tibet hosted a
rally yesterday in White Plaza in support
of the Tibetan Freedom Torch Relay,
which will travel from San Francisco to
Los Angeles to encourage China to
change its policies toward the province.
Ihe relay, which is in part led by Jigme
Norbu, the nephew of the Dalai Lama,
made its first college stop at Stanford.

"This is a very special moment for
Tibet," said History Prof. Clayborne
Carson, who spoke at the rally. " ITie
world has unprecedented leverage over
China because of the coming Olympics."
"The Dalai Lama is the person that
best represents the nonviolent values of
Martin Luther King and Gandhi," added
Carson, who is director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Papers Project. "If we do
not pay attention to Tibet, then we are
saying that nonviolent resistance doesn't
work."
Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan, who also spoke at the event,
encouraged the audience to "stand with

the 6 million Tibetans in their search for
basic human rights, freedom and justice."
While the speakers argued for Tibetan
freedom, they emphasized the distinction
between the Chinese people and the gov
ernment's stance on the issue.
"We are not against Chinese people."
Norbu emphasized while representing
the Tibetan Freedom Torch Relay at
Stanford. "We are against the Chinese
Communist Party's policies."
Many in the audience were receptive
to the messages of the speakers and the
Tibetan Freedom Torch Relay organizers.
"This is great because we got to hear
from multiple perspectives of the Tibetan

issue," said Joshua Fouse '10, president of
Stanford Friends of Tibet.
Other students, however.did not think
that the speakers presented a fair per
spective of the issue of Tibetan independ
ence. Because of the controversial nature
of the topic, some audience members
vocally disagreed with the viewpoint of
the speakers.
One member in the audience ven
tured so far as to yell "Liar!" repeatedly
throughout the course of Norbu's speech.
After the event, however, Norbu
appeared unfazed.
"When you're an activist, there
will be obstacles," Norbu said to The
Daily.
"It's my responsibility, and the
responsibility of every Tibetan, to
raise awareness and educate the audi
ence about Tibet," Norbu added.
"Most of the leaders of the relay have
put their jobs on hold for long periods
of time for this project."
