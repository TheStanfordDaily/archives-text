## Wilbur lot to be completed by end of April Field not expected to be replaced until at least mid-June, admin, says 
### JULIANNE STERN 
Adverse weather conditions and unforeseen permitting
delays have pushed back the completion of the under
ground Wilbur parking structure until the end of April. The
delays force Wilbur freshmen to wait until next year to
tjoy the return of Wilbur Field, a long-popular recreation
s for Stanford students before construction began in
summer 2006.
Although the 1,180 space parking structure is expected
to be completed by the end of this month, the new turf field
Mat will cover the parking structure will not be available for
full use until at least mid-June, according to Mark Banino,
Special Projects manager at the Department of Project
Management.
Last summer Project Management told The Daily that
both the parking structure and the new field could be com
pleted as early as the end of March.
"Adverse weather and permitting delays impacted the
schedule very early in the project," Bonino said. "Rather
than immediately concede an overall delay at the time, it's
been a slow, grinding battle to make up some of that lost
time."
But Bonino cautioned, "while we have set a goal of
opening the garage for parking by the end of the month,
there are a lot of schedule risks, including systems testing
and regulatory inspections."
Bonino said a number of tasks must still be completed,
including painting, lighting, traffic striping and the installa
tion of elevators and an emergency generator. Workers are
also continuing construction on Wilbur Way, a new entry
road into the garage.
Landscapers, meanwhile, are installing layers of material
that will support the planned field's natural turf. Once the
new turf is installed on top of the underground parking
structure. Bonino said,"We will need to let it establish itself,
which is why I don't think it will be ready until June."
When residents and staff moved into Wilbur last fall,
they expected to be able to use the new Wilbur Field by the
beginning of spring quarter.
"At the beginning of the year, 1 had images in my head
of spring quarter, of residents actually being able to go out
side and relax and play sports," said Chad Bowling '09, a
Resident Assistant (RA) in Otero, a dorm immediately
adjacent to the construction site.
Bowling described the construction as "more of a disap
pointment. almost, than a hindrance."
He said that many residents in Otero, an all-frosh dorm.
moved in with "the whole image of
northern California and this beauti
ful weather that they tell you about
when they come to Stanford."
While he and his residents had
hoped to make use of the new field
this spring, he said his residents now
complain that "it's hard to enjoy the
beautiful weather when you can't
open your window, and you look
outside and there's cranes and
dust."
Takeo Rivera '08, an RA in
Okada, also reported that his resi
dents experienced difficulties with
noise, debris and noxious smells
from the construction site.
"Needless to say, the construc
tion is thoroughly annoying to the
dorm," said Rivera, who has lived in
Okada for three years.
Rivera said he has by now
become accustomed to the con
struction noise that is the source of
complaints from many of his resi
dents.
"Of course. I'm old enough to
remember Wilbur Field." Rivera
said. "It's unfortunate to have that
in my memory and have freshmen
who won't be able to experience
that."
