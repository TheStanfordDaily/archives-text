## Groups opt out of joint special fees Amendment places higher voter threshold for approval 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
Groups applying for special fees will join
candidates in awaiting the results of ASSU
elections tonight. But this year, the special
fees process has been marked by new restric
tions and difficulties gaining the support of
one student population — graduate students.
The most significant change to this year's
special fees process is an amendment requir
ing all groups applying for joint special fees to
receive a majority of support from both
undergraduate and graduate voters. This pol
icy change makes joint fees more difficult to
obtain, since graduate students have tradi
tionally been more conservative with their
money.
Some groups, such as the Stanford News
Readership Program, that had traditionally
sought joint special fees opted this year to
apply for undergraduate special fees in light
of the new restriction. But such groups will
continue to cater to both undergraduate and
graduate populations.
"When a student group requesting special
fees is listed as undergraduate only, that
means that the group is only requesting
money from the undergraduate Stanford stu
dents," said ASSU Funding Coordinator Jeff
Lock '10. "But their services are not necessar
ily limited to undergraduates only."
The Stanford Comedy Club, which sought
joint special fees, learned the difficulties of

the joint fees process the hard way — the
group did not even receive enough petition
signatures to be placed on the ballots for this
year's election.
"[During next year's elections.) we are
going to go just as an undergraduate group."
said Graduate student and Comedy Club
officer Melahn Parker. "I think you will find
that not enough graduate students vote to
pass most special fees. Undergraduates vote

'yes' to special fees and in general are more
involved with groups."
Groups receiving joint fees were also most
often the target of students who preferred not
to fund certain organizations and receive a
refund from the ASSU last fall, according to
data provided by the ASSU.
Most groups that received special fees had
between a five and seven percent refund
request rate. KZSU has the highest refund
