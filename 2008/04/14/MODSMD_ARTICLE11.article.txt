GRANTHAM. PA. (AP) — Democrat
ic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said Sun
day that the potential for life begins at
conception as she and presidential rival
Sen. Barack Obama answered questions
about faith and religion in both their per
sonal lives and the public discourse.
In a forum devoted to an issue rare on
the campaign trail, the two White House
hopefuls talked about the presence of
God in their lives and how often they read
the Bible as well as divisive issues such as
abortion, abstinence and human rights
within the context of faith.
The two are reaching out to people of
faith in Pennsylvania, which holds its pri
mary on April 22. GOP nominee-in-wait
ing John McCain did not participate.
Clinton was asked whether life begins at
conception — which opponents of abor
tion contend is a reality that makes any ter
mination of a pregnancy the ending of a life.
"I believe the potential for life begins
at conception." Clinton said. "For me. it is
also not only about a potential life. It is
about the other lives involved. ... I have
concluded, after great, you know, concern
and searching my own mind and heart
over many years,... that individuals must
be entrusted to make this profound deci
sion, because the alternative would be
such an intrusion of government authori
ty that it would be very difficult to sustain
in our kind of open society."
York senator added that
abortion should remain legal, safe and
rare.
ITte two candidates appeared sepa
rately at Messiah College near Harris
burg, Pa., and briefly met as Clinton left
the stage and Obama took her place. The
moment of pleasantries and handshakes
belied days of angry accusations between
the two over Obama's comments about
bitter voters in small towns.
Asked whether life begins at concep
tion, Obama said he didn't know the an
swer.

"This is something that I have not. I
think, come to a firm resolution on. I
think it's very hard to know what that
means, when life begins. Is it when a cell
separates? Is it when the soul stirs? ...
What I know, as I've said before, is that
there is something extraordinarily pow
erful about potential life and that that has
a moral weight to it that we take into con
sideration when we're having these de
bates."
Clinton is a Methodist. Obama is a
member of Trinity United Church of
Christ in Chicago, where the retired pas
tor. the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, touched off
a furor with sermons criticizing the Unit
ed States. The words of Obama's pastor
have dogged the campaign. and the candi
date reiterated his condemnation of
Wright's remarks but stood by his church.
"Pastors are imperfect. Certainly, the
membership is imperfect. 1, as somebody
who is sitting in the pews as a sinner, is im
perfect," he said. "And. you know, that
doesn't detract from. I think, what the
church is supposed to be about, which is
to worship God and proclaim the good
news."
Clinton said she has felt the gift of God in
her life and said she makes decisions on
tough moral issues such as abortion and
the treatment of alleged terrorists after
prayer, contemplation and study.
"I don't pretend to even believe that I
know the answers to a lot of these ques
tions," Clinton said."l don't."
One of the toughest questions she
faced was why God allows innocent peo
ple to suffer. Clinton said that has been
the subject of much debate for genera
tions, and added: "1 don't know. 1 can't
wait to ask him."
When asked if she thought God want
ed her to be president, Clinton quipped.
"1 could be glib and say, well, we'll find
out."
She said she doesn't presume anything
about God and she thought Abraham
Lincoln was right to not act as if God is on
our side. "In fact, our mission should be
on God's side," Clinton said.
