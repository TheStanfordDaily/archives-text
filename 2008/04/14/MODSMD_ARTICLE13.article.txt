## Editorial Board An open letter to the incoming ASSU executives 
### 
The Daily recently interviewed all can
didates for ASSU Executive and was
greatly impressed by the talented and
genuine pool of those running for office.
What particularly stood out was the insight
ful, comprehensive platform of innovative
policies that each slate assembled. We would
like to take the opportunity to synthesize
what we thought were some of the most ef
fective ideas regarding diversity, sustainabil
ity, graduate student issues, social proposals
and ASSU-student body engagement, in the
hope that newly-elected executives Johnny
Dorsey 4 09 and Fagan Harris '09, along with
the many new senators and class presidents,
will consider implementing them.
At the centerpiece of nearly every slate's
platform was the issue of increasing diversi
ty. For some this meant broadening the defi
nition of diversity to include LGBT and dif
ferent socio-economic groups; others spoke
of wanting to establish a clear protocol for
acts of intolerance; still others mentioned Di
versity Outreach fellowships, international
need-blind admissions, outreach and reten
tion efforts and the promotion of transgen
der and gender neutral housing.These are all
nuanced ways of tackling campus-wide di
versity.
The Go Go slate brought up one idea in
particular that we would like to see imple
mented.The pair praised the CSI()6 model of
"stepping-stone" diversity, in which more-di
verse undergraduates are employed as
Teaching Assistants in the hopes that this will
lead to a more diverse graduate population
and professoriate, and they proposed ex
panding such a program to other depart
ments. As the undergraduate student body is
impressively diverse, this struck us as an ef
fective way of addressing the problem of
graduate and professional diversity with an
existing solution.
Sustainability was yet another issue men
tioned in every platform. Solutions included
more effective electrical plants and eliminat
ing the styrofoam cups at the Axe and Palm.
Our new executives should be well-posi
tioned to tackle sustainability issues on cam
pus. given that they ran a sweat-free cam
paign featuring 100 percent recycled fliers.
Their primary proposals included working
closely with Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford to establish a cup-buying consortium to
supply Stanford parties with sustainable cups
instead of the übiquitous red cups.
A third major issue that many candidates
addressed was that of mental health. Few
slates had concrete proposals, but all spoke

of the need to improve the situation. Ideas
mentioned including the need to reform
Counseling and Psychological Services (for
instance, extending the 10-free-visit yearly
maximum), reduce student stress, provide
greater help for students suffering from eat
ing disorders and eliminate the stigma asso
ciated with receiving counseling. Mental
health issues should certainly be at the fore
front of this administration's agenda.
Another important matter we hope our
new executives will address is the subject of
graduate student issues.This election showed
a sharp divide between the graduate and un
dergraduate populations — with Go Go, a
slate comprised of rising co-terms, receiving
an overwhelming 40 percent of the graduate
vote and presumably largely responsible for
the 19 percent increase in graduate student
voting. Considering the graduate student
population is a majority on campus, its needs
are often left remarkably unattended, to the
point where many are unaware that the
ASSU even serves graduates.
The Go Go slate was at the forefront of
graduate issues. The pair proposed convert
ing the 750 bar into an all-day cafe and urged
a separate allotment of ASSU funds for grad
uate-only social events, noting that most
graduate students do not experience a burn
ing desire to mingle with undergraduates.
Ihey had a plethora of detailed, graduate
specific ideas that the new administration
would do well to consider if the ASSU hopes
to serve its entire constituency. In an effort to
accomplish this, Dorsey and Harris ad
mirably mentioned cutting their executive
salaries to fund ASSU positions focusing on
graduate issues.
The candidates varied in their approach
to social-space issues, with all slates but Go
Go (which wanted to convert Tresidder into
a hang-out area) proposing to convert Old
Union from a study space to a more social
area; perhaps a schoolwide referendum on
which would be preferable would be best.
With regard to Old Union, Doshi/Hon pro
posed universal, online space-reservation
system that would simplify coordinating
meetings and events. Block parties, barbe
ques and other large social events were fre
quently mentioned, and another salient sug
gestion by Go Go was the implementation of
a social shuttle to run on weekend nights be
tween Governor's Corner and Mirrielees, al
leviating pressure on the cash-strapped 5-
SURE system.

contributions are the views of their respective writers and do not necessarily

Lastly, the issue of student en
gagement with the ASSU is one we
would like to consider. Many slates
felt that they were running for a po
sition in an organization that most in
the student body considered useless.
Several slates mentioned that they
planned to utilize existing dorm eon
tacts and visit student dining halls
and solicit input face-to-face —
Dorsey/Harris cited the example of
former Stanford President Don
Kennedy taking walks to the Dish
with members of the Stanford com
munity, and Go Go astutely noted
that students spend an inordinate
amount of time online, proposing
Facebook polling to keep students
engaged and providing feedback.
Overall, we heard from all the
candidates many innovative and
wide-ranging ideas for improving
the entire Stanford community, and
we hope that they will all be careful
ly considered and applied where
possible.
