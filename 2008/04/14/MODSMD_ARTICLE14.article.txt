## Put a poem in your pocket 
### 
What do you carry around in your
pockets every day? A lanyard
heavy with keys, a weathered wal
let, your (only) chewed-up pen? Backpack
pockets and purses count, too. What small
treasures do you deem essential enough for
constant transport? This upcoming Thurs
day, Apr. 17, the Academy of American
Poets and your trusty columnist here are en
couraging you to place a poem in that lint
filled compartment of yours in honor of the
first national Poem in Your Pocket Day.
The "rules" of celebrating this day, which
falls right in the middle of National Poetry
Month, are pretty simple. Put a poem in your
pocket. You got that part already. Now you
can't just let it fester there all day. You need
to share it with people by unfurling the little
piece of paper and reading it aloud whenev
er you can. Or, if you prefer, by inviting
someone to stick their hand in your pocket
and read it to you.
Because I am a lover of poetry, the possi
bilities of this day — or what it represents —
really excite me. I realize, however, that my
giddiness over poetry might not be shared
by the masses. It makes me sad when I hear
friends, peers or even adults say that they
don't read or enjoy poetry because they
don't think they "get it." I think we all carry
around this painful image of hunching over
a poem in a high school English class, trying
to squeeze out meaning by underlining as
many literary terms as possible, hoping that
the shiny key is located somewhere in that
third example of synecdoche.
As an English major, I would be lying
(and also admitting to wasting huge
amounts of time) if I said there was no value
in that kind of poetic investigation. Howev
er, I think that one can enjoy poetry and dare
I say understand poetry without beating it
senseless.
If it makes you think, if it makes you
smile, if it makes you walk through the world
differently that day, it has meaning. To you.
Pleasure is too often underrated in an art

form that celebrates the power of words.
The door to poetry is different for every
one. Some prefer the easy-to-open, familiar
screen door of Billy Collins and the like.
Others would rather scratch away at a cast
iron gate until it creaks open or ignore doors
altogether and squeeze in through the chim
ney. My first real portal to poetry was
through the oven door of Sylvia Plath when
I was fiftcen-years-old. Cliche? Maybe. Is
that a problem? I don't think so. Something
in her raw confessions resonated with me,
and I've been devouring poetry ever since.
I get slightly frustrated when I hear peo
ple arguing against poets like Billy Collins or
poetry-arrangers like Prairie Home Com
panion man Garrison Keillor simply on the
principle that they are philistines — the fast
food verses for the impatient masses, the
easy listening for those unwilling to hear
something a little more complex. In my opin
ion, it is better to have access than to never
find an entry point at all. And that's what
events like Poem in Your Pocket Day try to
accomplish, as well. To bring poetry out of
the anthologies and into our every day lives.
So come Thursday, tuck a poem into your
pocket, backpack, bike basket or whatever
and share it whenever you can. Reminisce
about childhood over some Shel Silverstein.
Lament the cruelties of April and the annoy
ance of footnotes; over T.S. Eliot. Get your
seminar hct and breathlessly bothered with
Walt Whitman. F;el fragmented with Sap
pho. Part; ke in the guilty pleasure of
William Cirlos William's plums. Get con
ceit-ed wiih John Donne. Or, liberate a
