# Little Miss Modern
## Car-tastic 
### 
Back in my old life on the east coast, a
business trip once took my friend Ed
from his home in Boston to sunny Cal
ifornia. When I drunk texted him to ascertain
if he was enjoying himself out on the west
side ("Hello how is California love Caitlin"),
he poetically replied with the title of this arti
cle. Ed has a way with the English language,
probably because he's from England, but
even the more pedestrian wordsmith is
bound to agree that Californians are hella
into driving cars.
I guess there are some passable reasons
for the overly enthusiastic car culture out
here, like things being geographically spread
out and an inadequate public transportation
system. It also seems like in Silicon Valley,
folks are desperate to throw money at any
thing they can. just to relieve that uncomfort
able stress of too many wads of cash in their
pockets. There's nothing like a Porsche or
three to ease that pressure! And of course, as
1 have noted in the past, people here love the
environment, and they recognize that the
best way to share this message with the world
is by driving a Prius.
Still, this obsession with cars is more than

a little alien to me. After eighteen years of ex
treme driving dependence in suburban New
Jersey, my relocation to a decently urban
area for college rocked my world, and 1
basked in the newfound freedoms of walk
ing, biking, bus-ing or subway-ing to any
where 1 wanted to go. I fell in love with the
car-less lifestyle hard and fast â€” before long,
I couldn't even fathom what life in one's
twenties would be like when cars were in
volved. Finding parking, buying gas, coordi
nating rides, sitting in traffic, emitting carbon
dioxide and worrying about drunk driving
were all unnecessary, unimaginable
headaches that I never wanted to put up with
again.
Before moving out here, 1 assumed that I
would continue to feel this way for the fore

seeahle future, perhaps until the age of forty
eight or so when I might decide to settle
down, move to the suburbs and procreate.
But silly me: it turned out that a move to the
non-San Francisco part of the Bay Area en
tailed a move to the suburbs a little earlier
than expected. I'm not settling down,and I'm
definitely not procreating, but sure enough, I
now live a stone's throw down El Camino
from every strip mall store one could ever
want to visit. And as I soon realized, most
people access these temples to retail (and
everywhere else) not by throwing stones, but
by driving cars.
I rebelled for reasons of personal princi
ple as well personal finance, and decided to
defiantly live in the midst of suburbia sans
car. Together with my desire to house myself
olf-campus in order to engage in the greater
world or something, these convictions landed
me a seven-mile bike ride, a twenty-five
minute bus ride or a ten-minute train ride
away from class. There are some minor hic
coughs, like when it rains during my com
mute and I end up with unsightly mud splat-
