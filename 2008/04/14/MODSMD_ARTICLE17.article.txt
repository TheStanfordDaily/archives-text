# Op-Ed
## Campaign like REVOLUTION... or don't 
### 
You may or may not he aware that we
ran for ASSU Executive as the REV
OLUTION slate. We will not pro
mote our sweeping policy agenda. We will
tell you how we had ten times more fun than
our opponents with thirty times less budget.
A fun campaign is 95 percent free. Money
should only he spent on what cannot be bor
rowed or recycled.
Rhetoric is always free.The peak event of
our campaign was a ranting sermon deliv
ered to hundreds of curious constituents in
White Plaza andTYesidder Union. Preaching
is so easy and effective that you can do it,
too! Memorial Church will give you a com
plimentary copy of the New Testament, and
Yost House will lend its mobile pulpit to any
ordained Doctor of Divinity. There's no

word like God's word.
The ASSU will hand you a microphone at
many public events to prophesize at will.
Don't mind them when they try to grab it
back. Say what you want.
Food can be free. We gave out dozens of
REVOLUTION bananas (our official fruit)
without spending a dime. Dining halls dis
pose of excess food every day. Ask the dining
staff about this free phenomenon.
Some fun is recycled. An effective (even
sweat-free!) campaign T-shirt can be manu
factured by spray-painting a design onto a T
shirt you don't want anymore. Cut a stencil
from a cardboard box, place it over the shirt,
and spray. Even a beginner can make fifty
shirts an hour.
Light shows are cheap. For $40 you can

rent a Source F-our stage light and project
your campaign symbol onto Hoover Tower.
You will find it hard to project a more ironic
symbol than our Palm & Sickle, but we en
courage you to try.
The easiest way to run a fun and free cam
paign is to be poor. It worked for us. Without
the possibility of dropping thousands of dol
lars on ephemeral garbage, you won't! Rich
er candidates are at a serious disadvantage
when it comes to fun and free campaigning.
C ampaigning at its best is campaigning on
the cheap. Keep this in mind when you cam
paign. Or don't! We don't care!

Red Daly and Jon Rich are wholly unsatisfied
with Ihe Daily's campaign coverage. Publish
ing this op-ed is hut the first step of repentance.
