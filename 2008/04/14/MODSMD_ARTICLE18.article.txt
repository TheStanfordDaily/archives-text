## CONFERENCE LEADERS TAKE TWO 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford started the season un
ranked and was considered a long
shot to finish at the top of the Pacif
ic-10 Conference. Oregon State
came into this year as the back-to
back national champions boasting a
top-10 ranking. Almost two months
in, things certainly look different.
The Beavers had steadily fallen
in the rankings, until they dropped
out in mid-March. Stanford has con
sistently played well against the top
teams in the country and had
climbed all the way to No. 10 in the
Baseball America poll by the start of
last week.
Oregon State had won five
straight games against Stanford in
Corvallis. but that didn't bother the
Card, who took two of three from
the Beavers this weekend to keep
pace in the highly competitive Pac
-10.
After battling back from a five
run deficit only to blow a late lead
and lose in extra innings on Friday,
Stanford rebounded and put up a
couple of late runs of their own to
win on Saturday. That set the stage
for Sunday's rubber match between
sophomore Jeffrey Inman and last
year's most outstanding player at
the College World Series, Jorge
Reyes.
What started out as a pitcher's
duel turned into an offensive show
down in the ninth. Inman looked
good for the Card, allowing just one

unearned run in six and a third in
nings. Reyes took a perfect game to
the fifth, when Stanford loaded the
bases with no outs, trailing 1-0. He
settled down and escaped, though,
sandwiching a force out at home be
tween two strike outs.
Still, Stanford kept coming, and
the Cardinal tied the game when
catcher Jason Castro drove in left
fielder Joey August in the sixth.
The Card carried a 2-1 lead into
the ninth. Despite managing just
four hits in the first eight innings.
Stanford started off the inning with
back-to-back solo homeruns from
center fielder Sean Ratliff and
pinch-hitter Ben Clowe to make the
score 4-1.
Those runs proved valuable, as
Oregon State loaded the bases with
one out against junior Blake Han
cock in the bottom of the ninth.
Freshman Michael Marshall came
on in relief, and, despite allowing
one inherited runner to score on a
sacrifice fly, got the last two Beaver

batters to pick up the save and seal
the 4-2 win.
"All I was thinking was,'concen
trate on the hitter,"'said Marshall."l
got to throw out of the windup with
the bases loaded, so I could forget
about the runners. [Pitching] Coach
[Jeff] Austin said to throw strikes
and keep the ball down. That's all I
tried to do and 1 believed in my stuff.
"We really wanted as a team to
win that series and 1 was happy it fell
to me to get the final two outs."
Inman got the win to move to 5-0
this year, a career high for wins in a
season. His ability to hold Oregon,
which scored a combined 14 runs in
the first two games, to just one was
key for Stanford, which struggled to
get its offense clicking.
The solid pitching helped kick
start another Cardinal comeback on
Sunday. Playing from behind early
was the standard on the whole
weekend, and Stanford was able to
successfully rally back in two out of
three to take the series, their tenth
series victory in a row.

In the opener on Friday evening
the Beavers jumped all over Stan

first inning. But senior reliever
David Stringer went six innings and
was able to slow the Beaver offense
long enough to allow the Cardinal to
climb back into the game.
