## CONFERENCE LEADERS TAKE TWO 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford started the season un
ranked and was considered a long
shot to finish at the top of the Pacif
ic-10 Conference. Oregon State
came into this year as the back-to
back national champions boasting a
top-10 ranking. Almost two months
in, things certainly look different.
The Beavers had steadily fallen
in the rankings, until they dropped
out in mid-March. Stanford has con
sistently played well against the top
teams in the country and had
climbed all the way to No. 10 in the
Baseball America poll by the start of
last week.
Oregon State had won five
straight games against Stanford in
Corvallis. but that didn't bother the
Card, who took two of three from
the Beavers this weekend to keep
pace in the highly competitive Pac
-10.
After battling back from a five
run deficit only to blow a late lead
and lose in extra innings on Friday,
Stanford rebounded and put up a
couple of late runs of their own to
win on Saturday. That set the stage
for Sunday's rubber match between
sophomore Jeffrey Inman and last
year's most outstanding player at
the College World Series, Jorge
Reyes.
What started out as a pitcher's
duel turned into an offensive show
down in the ninth. Inman looked
good for the Card, allowing just one

unearned run in six and a third in
nings. Reyes took a perfect game to
the fifth, when Stanford loaded the
bases with no outs, trailing 1-0. He
settled down and escaped, though,
sandwiching a force out at home be
tween two strike outs.
Still, Stanford kept coming, and
the Cardinal tied the game when
catcher Jason Castro drove in left
fielder Joey August in the sixth.
The Card carried a 2-1 lead into
the ninth. Despite managing just
four hits in the first eight innings.
Stanford started off the inning with
back-to-back solo homeruns from
center fielder Sean Ratliff and
pinch-hitter Ben Clowe to make the
score 4-1.
Those runs proved valuable, as
Oregon State loaded the bases with
one out against junior Blake Han
cock in the bottom of the ninth.
Freshman Michael Marshall came
on in relief, and, despite allowing
one inherited runner to score on a
sacrifice fly, got the last two Beaver

batters to pick up the save and seal
the 4-2 win.
"All I was thinking was,'concen
trate on the hitter,"'said Marshall."l

the bases loaded, so I could forget
about the runners. [Pitching] Coach
[Jeff] Austin said to throw strikes
and keep the ball down. That's all I
tried to do and 1 believed in my stuff.
"We really wanted as a team to
win that series and 1 was happy it fell
to me to get the final two outs."
Inman got the win to move to 5-0
this year, a career high for wins in a
season. His ability to hold Oregon,
which scored a combined 14 runs in
the first two games, to just one was
key for Stanford, which struggled to
get its offense clicking.
The solid pitching helped kick
start another Cardinal comeback on
Sunday. Playing from behind early
was the standard on the whole
weekend, and Stanford was able to
successfully rally back in two out of
three to take the series, their tenth
series victory in a row.

In the opener on Friday evening
the Beavers jumped all over Stan
ford, building a 5-0 lead after the
first inning. But senior reliever
David Stringer went six innings and
was able to slow the Beaver offense
long enough to allow the Cardinal to
climb back into the game.

Stanford lost a close one to Oregon State on Friday before coming back to win on both Saturday and Sunday against
the defending national champs, fhe wins put the Cardinal at the top of the Pac-10, alongside Arizona State.
At the beginning of spring break, the
Stanford men's tennis team vowed to win
every match on their home court for the
rest of the season. After this past weekend,
the goal was realized as the No. 28 Cardinal
swept through Washington and Oregon to
finish 5-0 at home since the break.
On Friday, Stanford lost the doubles
point for the second match in a row but
roared back in singles play. After being
down early 1-0 to No. 25 Washington, the
Cardinal (11-8,4-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
won five out of six singles matches to se
cure the victory.
Washington (13-9,1-5) took the open
ing momentum with two doubles victories
at No. 1 and No. 2 doubles. Freshmen Alex
Clayton and Ted Kelly were down 7-6 but
had Washington's Derek Drabble and
Andy Kuharszky down love-30, a golden
opportunity to break and tie up the match.
But both Kelly and Clayton netted fore
hands on two consecutive points and the
Husky duo held strong and came back to
hold serve and win, 8-6.
With the deficit from the doubles
matches, sophomore Richard Wire's sin
gles match became the pivotal match of the
day. Wire was playing experienced senior
Andy Kuharszky of Washington at No. 3
singles.
Wire won a highly contested first set. 7-
6 (7-4),and was up 3-2 on Kuharszky in the
second. The Stanford sophomore got a
break point in the sixth game, and after
some rally and a nice Kuharszky shot to
send Wire across the court. Wire fired a
forehand down the line and past

Kuharszky. Wire, head coach John
Whitlinger and the crowd all burst with
emotion as the sophomore won the point
and the break to go up 4-2. He held on to
win the set 7-s,clinching the Cardinal's sec
ond straight victory.
On Saturday, the team's lone senior,
Phil Kao, was honored during the last
home match of his collegiate career. Kao
delivered in his final match on the Farm,
downing Romeo Mortera 7-5,7-6 (4) at No.
5 singles to clinch the Cardinal's ninth
home victory in 12 tries this season. Kao
also won on Friday, an impressive 6-0,6-0
win over Ryo Sekiguchi of Washington.
Though Stanford again lost the doubles
point against Oregon (11-13,0-6 Pac-10),it
took five out of six singles matches for the
win. Wire won his seventh match in a row
over Oregon's Francisco Gallardo,6-4,6-3,
while Clayton picked up his team-leading
24th victory of the season at No. 1 singles, a
6-4,6-2 win over Oregon's Marcos Verdas
co.
With the win, Stanford has secured a

iors Ratliff and Cord Phelps fueled
the comeback as Stanford built a 9-6
lead. By the time Stringer yielded to
Drew Storen in the seventh it was 9-
8, and an RBI double by Joey Wong
tied the game at nine in the eighth.
Stanford was unable to get any
thing more going offensively and an
RBI single from John Wallace off
junior Austin Yount in the tenth gave
Oregon State the win, 10-9.
Saturday: Stanford 4, Oregon State 2
With senior Erik Davis on the hill
Stanford found itself in an early hole
again. Trailing 3-0 heading into the
fifth, the Card pushed two across on
a Jake Schlander sacrifice fly and a
Phelps RBI single.
In the sixth, Ratliff delivered a
two-out opposite field double and
was brought home by freshman Ben
Clowe's single to tie the game at
three.
Batting in the seventh with two
outs, Phelps delivered his sixth
homerun of the year to put Stanford
on top 4-3.
The Beavers loaded the bases
with one out in the eighth. Davis
struck out the next two he faced to
get out of the inning, but a wild pitch
allowed the tying run to score. Phelps
came up big again in the ninth,
though, delivering another RBI sin
gle to score Jeff Whitlow and put
Stanford on top 5-4.
In the bottom of the ninth and the
score at 6-4, Oregon State managed
to get the tying run to the plate with
one out in catcher Ryan Ortiz. Ortiz
crushed a ball to the right field gap.
but an outstanding running catch
from Whitlow and an equally-out
standing relay throw to first doubled
off the base-runner and ended the
game.
Davis got the win. his career-high
fifth of the season, while striking out
nine in his third consecutive com
plete game win.
By going 2-1 on the weekend,
Stanford lifted its record to 17-11-1
and 6-3 in the Pac-10. Oregon State
fell to 16-12 and 4-5. The 6-3 record
places Stanford in a tie for first in the
conference with Arizona State.
"You know ASU is going to play
well,"said Phelps."lf you are going to
keep pace in the Pac-10 you need to
win series'. We struggled early in the

games [this weekend], but we were
able to come up big in some spots."
"We have been able to play very
well this season, particularly when
there is a lot on the line," coach Mark
Marquess added.
The pitching staff was credited
with being able to keep the games
close while the offense searched for
rhythm.
"Our pitching was key this week
end." said freshman Zach Jones, who
had two doubles on Sunday. "Davis
battled on Saturday and kept us in
the game, and Inman did the same
thing on Sunday."
Stanford plays at Klein Field at
Sunken Diamond today against
Santa Clara at 6 p.m. and against the
University of San Francisco Wednes
day at the same time. Next weekend
the Card heads back to the road as it
takes on UCLA in another confer
ence series.

ton and Oregon this weekend. Stanford lost the doubles point in both
matches but dominated in singles to win 5-2 both times.
