## Law school to ease loan repayments Program expanded to aid law grads who work in public sector 
### TIFFANY CARTWRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
About 10 percent of Stanford's graduating
law students go into public sector jobs each
year. To help those graduates, Stanford Law
School announced this weekend that it is
expanding the Loan Repayment Assistance
Program (LRAP). which enables participants
to take low-paying jobs in the public sector by
paying pail of their educational debt.
While first-year associates at major law
firms can earn up to $160.(XX) in an entry level
position, graduates taking jobs as public
defenders, attorneys for nonprofits or other
public-interest jobs often earn less than
$50,000 per year. Since Stanford law students
graduate with an average loan debt of
$100,000, expected salaries can have a signifi
cant impact on their career paths.
Stanford law graduates in public-interest
employment who make less than $ 1 (K),fKK)
per year qualify for LRAP. and the program
contributes to their loan payments based on a
sliding scale.
LRAP currently covers one hundred per
cent of loan payments for graduates with
incomes of $46,500 or less; eighty-five percent
for graduates with incomes between $46,500
and $60.(XX); and thirty percent for graduates
with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000.
Under LRAP's expansion, the program
will likely contribute a greater amount to law
school graduates with incomes in the middle
upper qualifying range ($60,000 - $75.(XX)).
though the exact details have yet to be speci
fied. Contributions from participants in other
income ranges will remain the same.
In order to remain tax-exempt, the money
that LRAP provides to meet monthly debt
payments is technically a loan. Previously,
after participants spent three years in
employment that qualified them for LRAP.
twenty-five percent of these loans would be
forgiven; after four years, fifty percent; and
after five years, one hundred percent. Under
the new expansion, LRAP will now forgive
loans on an annual basis. Now, even if partic
ipants spend only one year in LRAP. they will
not have to pay back the money provided to
them.
"We speak with participants and reevalu
ate LRAP every year," said Law School
Dean Larry Kramer. "But due to the recent
press about Harvard's new Public Service
Initiative, we thought it was important to
make a bigger announcement to reaffirm that
student who attended Sunday's pres
entation, was impressed.
"The expansion is great," Prout
said. "I was also impressed by the
smaller components such as the
allowances for assets and children."
Still. Prout did not think that com
paring loan forgiveness programs
would be a major factor in his decision

about which school to attend.
"I'm not deciding based on that,"
Prout said. "But once I'm in law
school, a program like LRAP would
definitely help me feel comfortable
entering public service."

Stanford has the most generous loan
forgiveness program in the country."
Harvard Law School announced in
March that it will provide a tuition
grant for the third year of law sch(x>l
— worth approximately $40,000 — to
students willing to commit to spending
five years in the public sector.
Kramer emphasized that the term
"grant" is a little misleading.
"Essentially 1 iarvard becomes one
of your creditors," Kramer said. "They
loan you the tuition money and then
promise to forgive it if you stay in pub
lic service for five years. But if you leave
the program, you pay back the entire
amount, plus a ten percent penalty and
an above-market interest rate."
To prove that Stanford's program
is still the "most generous," Frank
Brucato. Chief Financial Officer of the

Law School, presented a chart to
newly admitted students on Sunday
morning. The chart showed, for each
year of public interest employment,
the amount an average student would
have already contributed to his loan
payments and the amount of debt that
would remain — essentially a meas
ure of how much debt the graduate
would be responsible for were he to
leave LRAP at that time. After each
year in the program, with the excep
tion of one — year five — Stanford's
amount was lowest, making LRAP
the most generous.
"So if you plan to leave after exact
ly five years," Brucato joked."Harvard
is a better deal."
Kramer also discounted the idea
that Harvard's tuition grant would be
a powerful psychological lure regard
less of the fine details.
"Law students aren't stupid,"
Kramer said. "They'll be able to
crunch the numbers and know which
program is better."
