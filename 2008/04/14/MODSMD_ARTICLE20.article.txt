# Stanford wins home farewell
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Playing at home for the last time, the sen
iors on the No. 11 Stanford men's volleyball
team led the Cardinal to a pair of wins this
weekend and helped secure the sixth seed in
next week's Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) Tournament.
Senior outside hitter Jesse Meredith
came off the bench in the second game
against No. 6 UCLA and sparked a come
back for the four-game win (24-30, 30-27,
30-20, 30-28). On Saturday night, senior
outside hitter Matt Ceran was second on the
team in kills as the Cardinal recorded a
four-game victory over No. 7 UC-Irvine (30-
23,28-30,30-23,30-24).
"There's always nerves that seniors put
on themselves — they know it is their last
home weekend and there's always that
built-in anxiety," Stanford coach John Kosty
said."But they both played really well. Matt
struggled a little bit against UCLA and
Jesse came in and just picked up the team
and played great. And then Matt rebounded
and put some big swings away in the fourth
game for us to beat Irvine."
The pair of wins put the Cardinal (17-10,
12-10 MPSF) alone in sixth place in the con
ference standings. Stanford will start the
league tournament Saturday at third-seed
ed No. 3 Cal State Northridge. Northridge
won both regular-season match-ups, al
though the Cardinal won a preseason meet
ing.
No. 4 Long Beach State earned the top
seed with a win over Northridge this week
end and has a first-round bye in the tourna
ment. No. 2 B YU is the second seed and will
face the winner of a play-in game between
Irvine and No. 10 Southern California.
UCLA will face No. 5 Pepperdine in the 4-5
match.
"It's an incredible tournament and any
body can win it," Kosty said. "There are
some frontrunners, but you can't count out
Pepperdine, you can't count out Stanford,
you can't count out any of these teams be
cause everybody has beaten each other."

for sixth place, and needed both wins to
avoid Wednesday's play-in match.
Stanford fell behind early in the first
game against UCLA and could not close the
gap, trailing by at least three for most of the
frame, which the Bruins won 30-24.
The Cardinal got out of the gates faster
in the second game, but UCLA again built a
slight lead. Stanford came back to win 30-
27, and in the third game, Stanford pulled
ahead and held off the Bruins down the
stretch. The Cardinal closed out the game,
30-20, with five unanswered points, includ
ing three kills and an ace.
Stanford carried that momentum into
the fourth game, but UCLA battled back to
tie the score several times late. With the
game tied at 28, freshman outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin put down two of his
match-high 22 kills to end the game and the
match, 30-28.
Behind McLachlin, sophomore opposite
Evan Romero was second on the team with
14 kills and Meredith added 10 on .450 hit
ting. Romero and freshman libero Jordan
Inafuku tied with a match-high 11 digs each,
while sophomore middle blocker Garrett
Werner led the team with seven blocks.
After both teams had won on Friday
night, Stanford and Irvine were battling for
sixth place — and the right to skip the
MPSF play-in game —on Saturday. The
Cardinal's win was its third over the defend
ing national champion Anteaters, following
