### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 3 Stanford women's tennis
team knew about this season over a
year and a half ago. but little could be
done about it.
Hie players braced themselves,
they weathered the storm, and now
they are that much better for it.
On Saturday, the road-tested Car
dinal women completed their final
away match of season with a domi

nant 7-0 sweep of Oregon, ending a
travel-heavy 2(X)8 campaign.
"It was a brutal schedule this year,
and we knew that this year was com
ing for a really long time." sophomore
Lindsay Burdette said. "We've braced
for it and now it's over."
Though playing away from the
Farm has produced mixed results, the
Cardinal played nearly flawless tennis
in its fourth shutout of the season.
"It feels really good to get it over
it," Burdette said of the road match.

"It was an extremely, extremely diffi
cult season on the road including the
individual tournament in Palm
Springs and [National Team] Indoors
at Madison. Counting all of that, we
have just traveled and traveled."
In Eugene, Ore., the Cardinal
women had a short weekend with
only one match. Stanford began play
with its second consecutive doubles
sweep.

dium 3:00 PM.

GAME NOTES.' Stanford finished up its marathon
road schedule with another victory, extending
a winning streak to five games against the
Ducks. Stanford held Oregon under four
games in every set played on Saturday.
The onslaught continued in sin
gles.
At number one, freshman Hilary
Barte easily won her 15th consecutive
match at the top of the lineup 6-1,6-0
against another freshman, Celine
Roily.
With the victory, Barte is now an
impressive 23-5 on the season and 18-
3 in doubles match play.
The Cardinal women were so
dominant that Oregon was unable to
pick up more than four games in any
one set.
"The fact that it was a really short
weekend really drove everybody to
take care of business," Burdette said.

"It was short, it was sweet and we re
ally took care of business."
The California-like weather in Eu
gene was an added bonus for the Car
dinal cause.
"It was beautiful weather up there
which actually helped us" Burdette
said. "We got to play outdoors — we
couldn't even remember the last time
that happened. It was great prepara
tion for next week when we play at
home."
With the win, Stanford is now 17-4
on the season and 6-1 in Pacific-10
Conference play.
The Cardinal's conference record
ties it with UCLA and California at
the top of the standings. Cal heads to
the Farm this weekend while UCLA
will face off against USC.
"We're really excited about Cal,"
Burdette said. "We proved against
UCLA that we can come out and take

care of business on our own turf and 1
think that'll be the same with Cal.The
whole team in general has a com
pletely different attitude on the court
when they're playing in our place.
"They know how strong we are at
home," Burdette added.
But first, Stanford will follow up
that quick sweep of the Ducks with a
match-up against UC-Davis on Tues
day. Cal comes on Saturday to face a
Cardinal squad that expects to feel
well-rested for the showdown.
"1 think that the fact that it [the
weekend] was short will also help us
with the Cal match because we're
fresh and ready to go," Burdette said.
Despite losses on the road — their
first four-loss season since 1987, the
Cardinal players think they have ben
efited from being in the line of fire.
"Last year we didn't nearly travel
as much," Burdette said. "After this

season, the freshmen and I were bro
ken in, and we learned a lot on this
season on how to win on the road.
We're definitely stronger not play
ing at Stanford and that'll really heip
us."
With a 21-year Pac-10 conference
title streak on the line, that added
strength could be a factor in the cru
cial match against Cal. Winners of five
in a row and 11 of the last 12 matches,
the Cardinal women carry much mo
mentum heading into the rivalry
match.
The Cardinal will take the court at
home at 3 p.m. on TUesday against
Davis.The bout with Cal will begin at
noon on Sunday, and will also take
place at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium.
