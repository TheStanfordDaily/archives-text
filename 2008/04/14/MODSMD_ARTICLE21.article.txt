### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 3 Stanford women's tennis
team knew about this season over a
year and a half ago. but little could be
done about it.
Hie players braced themselves,
they weathered the storm, and now
they are that much better for it.
On Saturday, the road-tested Car
dinal women completed their final
away match of season with a domi

nant 7-0 sweep of Oregon, ending a
travel-heavy 2(X)8 campaign.
"It was a brutal schedule this year,
and we knew that this year was com
ing for a really long time." sophomore
Lindsay Burdette said. "We've braced
for it and now it's over."
Though playing away from the
Farm has produced mixed results, the
Cardinal played nearly flawless tennis
in its fourth shutout of the season.
"It feels really good to get it over
it," Burdette said of the road match.

"It was an extremely, extremely diffi
cult season on the road including the
individual tournament in Palm
Springs and [National Team] Indoors
at Madison. Counting all of that, we
have just traveled and traveled."
In Eugene, Ore., the Cardinal
women had a short weekend with
only one match. Stanford began play
with its second consecutive doubles
sweep.
