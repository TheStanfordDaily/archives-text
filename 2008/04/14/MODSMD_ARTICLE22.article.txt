spring football game on Saturday,

down run with three minutes re
maining.
The quarterback play was of
great focus on Saturday, as it is still
not clear who the team's starter will
be come spring.
"We should have a better idea
somewhere between seven to ten
practices into fall camp," head
coach Jim Harbaugh told GoStan
ford.com.
"It will still be a battle," junior
Tavita Pritchard said. "We are all
working hard and getting reps to
improve. I want to be as consistent
as possible."
