The No. 8 Stanford softball team continued to turn
around its Pacific-10 Conference fortunes at home this
weekend, run-ruling Oregon State 10-1 on Thursday night
before taking a pair of pitchers' duels against Oregon. 1 -0
and 2-1 .on Saturday and Sunday.
It was Stanford's first weekend sweep since the squad
beat Wisconsin, Princeton. BYU and East Carolina the
weekend after winter quarter finals in the Stanford Invita
tional 11.The Cardinal ran into trouble at the beginning of
the Pac-10 season against Arizona State and Arizona, but
is starting to right the ship.
Oregon State (25-20,3-5 Pac-10) was first to score on
Thursday, going up 1-0 in the first inning as the Beavers'
speedy second baseman Cambria Miranda took advan

first inning.
It was the second time in three games (and in three ca
reer Pac-10 games for Koutz) that the freshman supplied
the game-winning RBI for the Cardinal.
Oregon pitcher Brittany Rumfelt clamped down hard

Neill played a huge role in the shutout from behind the
plate, throwing out each of Oregon's Kivett sisters on steal
attempts to get crucial outs in the third and sixth innings.
