The No. 8 Stanford softball team continued to turn
around its Pacific-10 Conference fortunes at home this
weekend, run-ruling Oregon State 10-1 on Thursday night
before taking a pair of pitchers' duels against Oregon. 1 -0
and 2-1 .on Saturday and Sunday.
It was Stanford's first weekend sweep since the squad
beat Wisconsin, Princeton. BYU and East Carolina the
weekend after winter quarter finals in the Stanford Invita
tional 11.The Cardinal ran into trouble at the beginning of
the Pac-10 season against Arizona State and Arizona, but
is starting to right the ship.
Oregon State (25-20,3-5 Pac-10) was first to score on
Thursday, going up 1-0 in the first inning as the Beavers'
speedy second baseman Cambria Miranda took advan
tage of a wild pitch and an error to make it around the
bases.
But the Cardinal (37-7,4-5 Pac-10) started five straight
run-scoring innings in the bottom of the second. Sopho
more catcher Rosey Neill launched her conference-lead
ing 17th home am to lead off the second, and Stanford
scored three more in the third thanks to savvy base-run
ning by outfielders Anna Beardman and Alissa Haber.
Haber and Beardman scored on a passed ball and a
throwing error before second baseman Tricia Aggabao
came home on a single from freshman first baseman
Melissa Koutz.
Stanford continued to pile on the runs asjunior pitcher
Missy Penna stayed sharp, and designated player Erin
Howe ended the game an inning early with a three-run
homer in the sixth.
Game two of the weekend, against Oregon, was much
more dramatic. Stanford eked out the 1 -0 win after going
up early, thanks to a two-out RBI single from Koutz in the
first inning.
It was the second time in three games (and in three ca
reer Pac-10 games for Koutz) that the freshman supplied
the game-winning RBI for the Cardinal.
Oregon pitcher Brittany Rumfelt clamped down hard
after that, limiting Stanford to just one more hit for the rest
of the game and striking out three. Penna bore down on
the Ducks just as strongly, though, never allowing an Ore
gon runner past second base on her way to a shutout win.
Neill played a huge role in the shutout from behind the
plate, throwing out each of Oregon's Kivett sisters on steal
attempts to get crucial outs in the third and sixth innings.
Cortncy Kivett had only been caught twice in 32 steal at-
tempts in the 2008 season.
It was the same story for the two
teams again on Sunday. Penna contin
ued in the circle for the Cardinal, but
Oregon went with backup pitcher Ali
cia Cook. Stanford took advantage in
the third inning after two-and-a-half
scoreless frames.
Haber led off the bottom of the third
by roping a double to left-center and
then advancing to third on Aggabao's
bunt. Aggabao then took second, and
both she and Haber scored on succes
sive groundouts from shortstop Maddy
Coon and Neill. giving Stanford a 2-0
lead.
Oregon c;tme right back with a run
in the bottom of the fourth, but that was
all the Ducks could get in the game.
Penna closed the fourth with two strike
outs and then retired nine of the next 10
Oregon batters to close out the game
and the sweep for the Cardinal.
Stanford head coach John Rittman
got his 500 th victory in the Cardinal's
defeat of Oregon State on Thursday
and now stands at 502-231-3 in 12 sea
sons, till with Stanford.
The Cardinal returns to the field in
the middle of the week at home against

The No. 8 Stanford softball team continued to turn
around its Pacific-10 Conference fortunes at home this
weekend, run-ruling Oregon State 10-1 on Thursday night
before taking a pair of pitchers' duels against Oregon. 1 -0
and 2-1 .on Saturday and Sunday.
It was Stanford's first weekend sweep since the squad
beat Wisconsin, Princeton. BYU and East Carolina the
weekend after winter quarter finals in the Stanford Invita
tional 11.The Cardinal ran into trouble at the beginning of
the Pac-10 season against Arizona State and Arizona, but
is starting to right the ship.
Oregon State (25-20,3-5 Pac-10) was first to score on
Thursday, going up 1-0 in the first inning as the Beavers'
speedy second baseman Cambria Miranda took advan
tage of a wild pitch and an error to make it around the
bases.
But the Cardinal (37-7,4-5 Pac-10) started five straight
run-scoring innings in the bottom of the second. Sopho
more catcher Rosey Neill launched her conference-lead
ing 17th home am to lead off the second, and Stanford
scored three more in the third thanks to savvy base-run
ning by outfielders Anna Beardman and Alissa Haber.
Haber and Beardman scored on a passed ball and a
throwing error before second baseman Tricia Aggabao
came home on a single from freshman first baseman
Melissa Koutz.
Stanford continued to pile on the runs asjunior pitcher
Missy Penna stayed sharp, and designated player Erin
Howe ended the game an inning early with a three-run
homer in the sixth.
Game two of the weekend, against Oregon, was much
more dramatic. Stanford eked out the 1 -0 win after going
up early, thanks to a two-out RBI single from Koutz in the
first inning.
It was the second time in three games (and in three ca
reer Pac-10 games for Koutz) that the freshman supplied
the game-winning RBI for the Cardinal.
Oregon pitcher Brittany Rumfelt clamped down hard
after that, limiting Stanford to just one more hit for the rest
of the game and striking out three. Penna bore down on
the Ducks just as strongly, though, never allowing an Ore
gon runner past second base on her way to a shutout win.
Neill played a huge role in the shutout from behind the
plate, throwing out each of Oregon's Kivett sisters on steal
attempts to get crucial outs in the third and sixth innings.
Cortncy Kivett had only been caught twice in 32 steal at-
tempts in the 2008 season.
It was the same story for the two
teams again on Sunday. Penna contin
ued in the circle for the Cardinal, but
Oregon went with backup pitcher Ali
cia Cook. Stanford took advantage in
the third inning after two-and-a-half
scoreless frames.
Haber led off the bottom of the third
by roping a double to left-center and
then advancing to third on Aggabao's
bunt. Aggabao then took second, and
both she and Haber scored on succes
sive groundouts from shortstop Maddy
Coon and Neill. giving Stanford a 2-0
lead.
Oregon c;tme right back with a run
in the bottom of the fourth, but that was
all the Ducks could get in the game.
Penna closed the fourth with two strike
outs and then retired nine of the next 10
Oregon batters to close out the game
and the sweep for the Cardinal.
Stanford head coach John Rittman
got his 500 th victory in the Cardinal's
defeat of Oregon State on Thursday
and now stands at 502-231-3 in 12 sea
sons, till with Stanford.
The Cardinal returns to the field in
the middle of the week at home against
Santa Gara on Tuesday before a three-
