# Dorsey-Harris beats GO GO
## In fifth round of instant runoff voting, executive slate wins election by 370 votes 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduates were pitted against
graduate students in deciding
Stanford's next ASSU Executive —
and the undergrads won.
In the moments before the final
result was announced, Fagan Harris '09
bit his lips and gazed up at the ceiling,
too nervous to watch Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10
name the winning slate.
But Harris and his running mate,
Jonny Dorsey '09, had nothing to worry
about.
In the fifth round of instant runoff
voting, Dorsey-Harris won the election

with 2,150 votes to Gobaud-Goldgofs
1,880, a gap of 370 votes. Dorsey-Harris
won 2.603 votes in the sixth and final
round.
Dorsey and Harris embraced when
Woessner announced that they won
the executive election, and were soon
drowned out by the screams of sup
porters gathered in the Axe and Palm.
The new executives had a lot more
hugging in store for the night, when
they planned to celebrate with the 150
students who helped them campaign.
"We're just going to hug all our sup
porters," Harris said.
But Dorsey and Harris did not

devote their post-victory time to
supporters only. Seconds after their
win was announced, the pair
jumped to members of the compet
ing slates and exchanged hugs and
handshakes.
"The other guys are all awe
some." Dorsey told The Daily as his
running mate and Jack Cackler '09,
who ran on the Sharma-Cackler
executive slate, discussed a future for
Cackler in the ASSU. "A very big pri
ority is going to be keeping the ener
gy UP-"
Dorsey and Harris, who will begin
their tenure as executives with a
sharply divided student body, will
need to work with their one-time
campaign foes to unite the campus.
The new executives won 903
fewer graduate first choice votes
than David Gobaud 08 and Greg
Goldgof '08, and just barely beat out
fourth place finishers Sharma-
Cackler amongst graduates.
"We need to make sure our grad
student networks are as strong as in
the undergrad body," Dorsey said."lt
goes to working with all these great
slates. We are figuring out ways to
work with the other candidates to
engage the whole campus."
Turnout for this year's elections
rose 3 percent to 6.026. This was the
result of a 19 percent increase in
graduate voters, who numbered
2.675. Undergraduate turnout actu
ally fell 7.4 percent to 3,351.
"For grads this is the first year we
had a [graduate] assistant elections
commissioner." Woessner said.
"That's why you see a small decrease
in undergrad votes, because we put
more attention in how we were going
to outreach to grads."
While Dorsey and Harris gear up
to begin work as Stanford's president
and vice president, the other slates
are left to ponder their future in stu
dent politics.
"We don't know," Goboaud said
when asked if he and his running
mate Goldgof would work with the
ASSU next year. "I'm not sure; we'll
do something."
Priyanka Sharma '09, this year's
Undergraduate Senate Chair, grap
pled with the thought of leaving stu
dent government behind.
"I'll think about it. I obviously
need to see what's available,"
Sharma said of remaining involved
with the ASSU. "It has been my life,
and I do want it to stay there."
For Dorsey and Harris, a week of
sleepless nights and hard-fought
campaigning has finally come to a
close.
"What are you guys doing
tonight?" Cackler asked the pair fol
lowing their victory.
"Sleeping," Dorsey replied.
But not for long.
"When are we starting work?"
Dorsey asked The Daily with a grin.
"Tomorrow."
