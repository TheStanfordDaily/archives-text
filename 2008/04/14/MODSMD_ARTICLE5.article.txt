## Dean Julie will represent Obama as delegate 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
Julie Lythcott-Haims '89 may be accus
tomed to hundreds of screaming freshmen,
but this summer, she will be surrounded by
thousands of cheering political junkies. The
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students
will represent California's 14th
Congressional District as a delegate for Sen.

Barack Obama (D-lll.) at the 2008
Democratic National Convention.
Lythcott-Haims will join Matt Haney "10
J.D. and Gunn High School senior Molly
Kawahata in August at the Denver, Colo,
convention. The trio won their seats after
yesterday's delegate election in Sunnyvale,
in which 43 candidates vied for four seats.
Based on the results of California's
Democratic Feb. 5 primary. Sen. Hillary

Clinton (D-N.Y.) won 134 delegates and 29
alternate delegates, and Obama won 107
delegates and 11 alternate delegates from
the Golden State. The purpose of yester
day's delegate election was to elect two
female delegates, one male delegate and one
male alternate delegate to represent the
14th congressional district, which includes
Redwood City. Sunnyvale and Palo Alto.
According to Owen Bvrd. a coordinator

for Silicon Valley for Barack Obama, Haney
will serve as the alternate male delegate to
Roger I lu, the candidate who took first
place on the men's side. On the women's
side, kawahati and Lythcott-Haims finished
first and second, respectively, and will each
be seated as an Obama delegate at the con-
vention.
As of yesterday's afternoon
count, 603 registered voters took
part in the delegate election.
"We are just delighted with [the
turnout]," Byrd said. "As usual in
Obama Land, we always have a
mob. We don't have any small
events."
Haney was surprised at the num
ber of young voters who cast ballots
yesterday.
"Lots of students and young peo
ple are here, and I think that's
unusual," he said. "This is something
that usually only involves party
activists — people who have been
involved with the party for a long
time."
Lythcott-Haims attributed the
relatively large turnout to the
nature of Obama and his campaign.
"This type of turnout is because
of the candidate and is very consis
tent with who he is," she said. "1
think it's a further sign that this
country and its democracy have
been made more healthy because
Obama has run."
Though Lythcott-Haims is care
ful to separate her Stanford position
and her political affiliations, she
decided to run for a delegate seat
because of both her prior experi
ence with the Obama campaign and
her skill set as a lawyer.

"I've been involved with the cam
paign for over a year, both at the
grassroots level and the national
level," she said. "To me, this is the
next logical step in terms of my
sense of how 1 can be effective in
helping get Obama elected."
"As a lawyer, 1 have negotiation and
persuasion skills — skills around
diplomacy that 1 think would be
really effective at the convention,"
she added.
Haney, who serves as a campus
coordinator for Stanford Students
for Obama, attributed his decision
to run to what he believes is the
importance of youth representation
at the convention.
"Stanford students in particular
have been so engaged, so involved
and so excited by this campaign," he
said. "1 thought that it would be
important to continue that repre
sentation and include young people
and students in general with this his
toric convention."
Each candidate at yesterday's
election had the opportunity to give
a 30-second speech to the crowd.
These were preceded by a speech
given by Representative Anna
Eshoo (D-Calif.), who represents
the state's 14th Congressional
District in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Eshoo endorsed Obama prior to
California's Feb. 5 primary and will
serve as a superdelegate for the
Illinois senator at the convention.
