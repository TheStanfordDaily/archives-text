## Former Daily news editor wins Pulitzer 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
On what he called an "unforgettable
day" Nick Anderson "88, a former news
editor for Ilie Stanford Daily, was award
ed the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News
Journalism along with other Washington
Post staff members.
As an education editor for the Virginia
desk at the Post, Anderson was alone in
the newsroom when he received the first
reports of the Virginia Tech shooting in
April of 2007.
"The story was. at the beginning of the
day, very unclear and very far away,"
Anderson said. "We didn't know that
there would be 33 shot and killed."
Anderson decided to send a reporter to
Virginia Tech when he remembered that a
similar shooting incident had shut down
the campus the previous August. The Post
did not become aware of the event's mag
nitude until the reporter had already
begun the five hour drive from
Washington, D.C. to Blacksburg, Va.
"Nobody had any idea it was going to
be this huge," Anderson explained. "The
odds are, that when a couple people are
shot and killed it's probably going to be an
incident that is not going to grow to the
magnitude that it did."
During that first day, Anderson took
dictation over the phone from Post
reporters who had arrived on the scene.
"It was significant to send people as
soon as we could," he said. "In retrospect,
we were all very happy that [the first
reporter] was already on the road. It
helped us competitively to send someone
as soon as possible ... then we
flooded the zone with reporters."
Anderson was careful to empha
size how many people were
involved with the paper's coverage.
"All of us, on a major story like
this, respond, we threw our entire
desk at this story," he said. "That
includes a huge number of reporters
and editors, both Virginia and non-
Virginia."
According to a Post article about
the Pulitzer, eleven bylined
reporters and 50 Post journalists
contributed to the report, as well as
Web site staff. In the article, the Post
claimed to be the first paper to
obtain an eyewitness report by con
tacting a Virginia Tech student
through Facebook, as well as the
first to question the decision to
allow classes to continue.
Anderson was quick to cite the
subjectivity of the Pulitzer Prize, but
did allow that the Post's recognition
was the product of tremendous
teamwork and thoroughness.
"What distinguished the report,
in its first day and the days after
that, was its comprehensiveness," he
told The Daily. "It was a horrific

story, a horrific event ... but the
Prize was, for the newspaper as a
whole, an incredible honor. The
newsroom itself came to a standstill
for almost two hours Monday"
In a Columbia University press
release, the Pulitzer Prize commit
tee — which includes Stanford
History Prof. David Kennedy —
described The Post's coverage as an
"exceptional, multi-faceted cover
age of the deadly shooting rampage
at Virginia Tech. telling the develop
ing story in print and online."
The Washington Post won five other
Pulitzers this year, for a grand total
of six — the second largest number
any newspaper has won in a single
year. The New York Times won
seven in 2002.
The winner of each prize
receives a commemorative certifi
cate and $10,000 cash, which the
Post intends to donate to Virginia
Tech.
Anderson worked as a Daily
News reporter and editor for the
1987-88 academic year. Since gradu
ating from Stanford in 1988, he has
worked for the Palo Alto Weekly,
the San Jose Mercury News, the Los
Angeles Times and as a freelance
writer in Mexico for the Associated
Press.
