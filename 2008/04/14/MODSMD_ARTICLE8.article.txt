# STUDENT GOV'T
## Winners of ASSU election announced 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Johnny Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09
were not the only students enjoying an elec
tion victory this weekend. Fifteen newly
elected Senators and three class slates
joined them in their post-election celebra
tions, as will dozens of special fees groups.
Though this year's executive election has
concluded, battles in the Senate and con
cerns over failed monetary measures will
still linger in the weeks to come.
THE SENATE
Hie first place finish in this year's Senate
elections went to Shelley Gao '11, who
received 1,124 votes, the most of any sena
tor.
The freshman, noticeably surprised, lit up
when her name was called first and shiieked
in celebration.
ITiough the senator who received the
highest number of votes last year (fiugene
Nho TO) was elected deputy chair, Gao was
unwilling to discuss any interest in a leader
ship position at this time.
But Patrick Cordova '09, who received
1,092 votes — the second highest total
amongst Senate candidates — said he was
interested in running for chair, and that he
hoped his background in the Senate would
give him an edge.
Cordova will be joined by two other sen
ators — Stuart Baimel '09 and Luukas lives
'09 — who served on the Senate last year.
Though the campaigns for chair are sure
to be hard-fought, whether or not
endorsements will play a role in this
year's Senate divisions remains to be
determined.
In last year's chair elections,
Priyanka Sharma *09 summed up her
ability to smooth over divisions
between two Senate factions with
the words. "I am not a SOCC- or
Stanford Review-endorsed candi
date." a sentiment reiterated by Nho.
Cordova adamantly dismissed
the idea that such divisions will
define the Tenth Undergraduate
Senate.
"The idea is '15' as opposed to 8-
7," he said. "If we continue to have a
discussion about the different back
grounds we came from, we are not
going to get anything done."
Of the fifteen newly elected sena
tors, eight are endorsed by the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC)
and seven have the backing of the
Stanford Review. Cordova was not
endorsed by either SOCC or the
Review, and Gao was endorsed by
both.
Whether or not these endorse
ments become a buzzword in this
year's chair campaigns remains to be
determined, and they are only two of
a series of endorsements claimed by
this year's senators.
ITie Jewish Students Association
endorsed six elected senators, while
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
also endorsed six. Five senators who
received the Stanford Democrats'
endorsement also clinched Senate
seats, as did four who received the
Oueer Straight Alliance's endorse
ment.
Perhaps the most surprising con
tingent? Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) students. Six sena
tors are current SLE students or
alums.
SPECIAL FEES
Every special fees request was
passed in last week's election with
the exception of KZSU funding,
which failed to garner adequate sup
port amongst graduate voters. While
undergrads supported the radio sta
tion by a wide margin, only 45.71
percent of graduates voted yes.
Graduate Measure A. the GO
Pass advisory referendum, was also
defeated by graduate students. Ilie

GO Pass — which would add $106
to graduates' yearly University bills
to provide unlimited free Caltrain
rides for all graduate students —
was defeated by a margin of 329
votes. The Graduate Student
Council voted five to three in favor
of putting the measure on the ballot.
CLASS SLATES
The Soph Touch won the race for
sophomore class president and
Ocean's Oh-Ten defeated the
incumbent Class of 2010 presidents
The Giving Tree, despite controver
sies surrounding both races. Ocean's
Oh-Ten soundly defeated The
Giving Tree by a vote of 444 to 319,
a margin of 125. This victory came
after a controversy over emails sent
to the Class of 2010 list last week,
earning both junior class slates a
stern reprimand from Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10.
"It is our wish to put the election
behind us and enter the next aca
demic school year with fun activities
that strengthen the unity of the class
of 2010," Ocean's Oh-Ten said in a
written statement."We hope that the
current sophomore class presidents
share our sentiments in the best
interests of our class."
The Soph Touch defeated
McLeven by 106 votes in the second
round of instant runoff voting — 4%
to 390. Oh-Lovin' was defeated in
the first round, receiving just 250
first choice votes.
"The four of us are really excit
ed to start planning events as soon
as possible to benefit the entire
class." said Peter Davis Tl, a mem
ber of The Soph Touch. "What's
important for us now [is] to unite as
a class, we welcome the help of all
the other candidates now that we
are no longer opponents."
An email sent to the West Lag
chat list last week accused McLeven
and Oh-Lovin' of making a back
room deal to steal the election away
from The Soph Touch. The two slates
had told their supporters to rank the
opposite slate as number two when
voting.
