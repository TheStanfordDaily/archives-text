Johnny Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09
were not the only students enjoying an elec

elected Senators and three class slates
joined them in their post-election celebra
tions, as will dozens of special fees groups.

concluded, battles in the Senate and con

still linger in the weeks to come.
THE SENATE
Hie first place finish in this year's Senate
elections went to Shelley Gao '11, who
received 1,124 votes, the most of any sena
tor.
The freshman, noticeably surprised, lit up
when her name was called first and shiieked
in celebration.

highest number of votes last year (fiugene

unwilling to discuss any interest in a leader
ship position at this time.
But Patrick Cordova '09, who received
1,092 votes — the second highest total
amongst Senate candidates — said he was
interested in running for chair, and that he
hoped his background in the Senate would
give him an edge.
Cordova will be joined by two other sen
ators — Stuart Baimel '09 and Luukas lives
'09 — who served on the Senate last year.
