# STUDENT GOV'T
## Candidate plays elections prank 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Rolf Timp '08 isn't a fan of the
ASSU. so, in an effort to mock the
Undergraduate Senate, he asked 65
friends to write in his name on their
Senate ballots.
But limp ended up receiving about
965 votes, good for fourth place among
all Senate candidates.
So why won't Timp be sworn in to
the Tenth Undergraduate Senate next
week? His friends all wrote in his
name 15 times on their ballots, and a
glitch in the voting system counted all
the duplicate votes. Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner '10
responded by throwing out Timp's
duplicate votes, leaving him well out of
contention for a Senate seat.

"1 am trying to insult the system,"
limp said. "1 think there are rampant
flaws with it. It's riddled with apathy."
Timp is now dissatisfied with the
way his protest has been received by
ASSU officials.
Timp sent an email to the Elections
Commission arguing that the commis
sion acted inappropriately by ignoring
ballot secrecy, disenfranchising Timp's
supporters and systematically discrim
inating against him. But what angered
Timp the most was that the
Commission has not adequately
responded to his complaint.
"They totally ignored my request,
which is my most serious complaint
with the entire system," Timp said.
Woessner said that the responsibil
ity for responding to Timp's complaint
does not fall with the Elections

Commission.
"He submitted a formal complaint
to the constitutional council, so it's
basically up to the council to see if they
want [to] take the case" Woessner
said, "it's not up to the election com
mission to defend its actions."
If the case is addressed by the con
stitutional council and Timp, who will
be a graduate student next year, ends
up on the Undergraduate Senate, he
will be placed in an awkward situation
â€” serving as a member of a body that
he sought to ridicule.
"1 would [serve in the Senate]"
Timp said. "But only insofar as it
would highlight how absurd a farce the
process is."
