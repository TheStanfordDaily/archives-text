## GO Pass program on the rocks for 2008 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
After more than a year of long and
agitated deliberations between grad
uate students and the University, the
GO Pass referendum placed on the
ASSU spring ballot by the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) failed to pass
last week.

The GO
Pass program

subsidizes
train passes for
graduate stu
dents who live

off campus,
providing
them with

unlimited use

of the Caltrain. The
Office of the Provost
agreed to fund the GO Pass
for 2007, but no funding

has been approved by the Provost's
Office for 2008 and beyond.
Last week's failed referendum
received only 43 percent of graduate
votes, compared with 61 percent last
year, according to Psychology grad
uate student Jessica Cameron, who
is one of three leaders of the Go
Pass action committee.
"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
like we managed to convince on
campus grad students that they
could save money," she said.
Before elections week, the GO
Pass action committee took steps to
determine whether the GO Pass
would indeed benefit graduate stu
dents who live on campus.
According to Cameron, the commit
tee conducted a survey in early
April and sent it to graduate mailing
lists. Graduate students were also
encouraged to take the survey
online in the Grad Events Web site.
According to the survey, nearly
half of the 177 respondents current
ly live on campus, and 2cX percent of
them cited cost as the main factor in
deciding how to get off-campus.
Most of the opposition to the GO
Pass program has been to the $106

fee per graduate student

On-campus students currently
spend about $21 per quarter on
Caltrain transportation, compared to
$54 per quarter on gits to destinations
within the Caltrain corridor — includ
ing airports.This figure does not include
parking, maintenance and ownership
costs. The data was compiled and ana
lyzed by Adam Millard-Ball. a graduate
student in the Interdisciplinary
Program in Environment and

Resources.
1 The results also

state that on-cam
pus students make
an average of 11
I trips to places
along the Caltrain

corridor each
•'quarter,
including an
average of 4.6

trips to San
Francisco. Currently, Caltrain use
for these trips is about 14 percent —
26 percent for trips to San Francisco.
Ilie results of the survey also cite
the environmental benefits of the
program and the subsidies car own
ers who park on Stanford property
could receive if the Go Pass pro
gram were to continue.
According to Cameron, the GO
Pass action committee had expected
students to take public transporta
tion more often if the referendum
had passed. Similar free transit pro
grams at universities such as UC-
San Diego, UC-Santa Cruz and UT
Austin have increased the use of
public transportation by between 71
to 200 percent, Cameron said.
"We were expecting, based on
this survey and similar findings at
other schools, that Caltrain use
would at least double among on
campus grad students," she said.
Since the GO Pass referendum
did not pass, funding sources for the
program for 2(X)8 and beyond are
vet to be determined.
