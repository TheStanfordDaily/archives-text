## Editorial Board Promising attention given to mental health 
### 
Last year, Stanford witnessed four cam
pus deaths related to mental health.The
past two years have also seen campus
shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illi
nois University. Ihough campus has been rela
tively quiet this year, the prevalence of such
events in the past means that we should not
shift the conversation away from mental
health.
Like any top-tier academic institution,
Stanford University navigates a fine line be
tween pushing students to succeed and over
pressuring them. Stanford students are partic
ularly vulnerable to the "duck" syndrome, a
reference to the pressure students feel to ap
pear relaxed and in control even while strug
gling â€” similar to a duck's serene appearance
above water while its legs paddle frantically
below to stay afloat.
Currently, Stanford's primary mental
health resources are the Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center. Vaden's Health Promotional Ser
vices and Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS). The Bridge, staffed by trained
students, is laudable in its service as both a
steppingstone to professional advice and as a
peer mental health facility in its own right. For
those uncomfortable speaking to profession
als, confiding in another student who is famil
iar with the demands of college life can be less
intimidating. The Bridge also works to dispel
stigmas about mental health and the reluc
tance of many students about approaching
professionals at CAPS.
Last spring, after the student deaths, Stan
ford convened a Student Mental Health and
WellbeingTask Force to assess conditions and
suggest changes. The results of the task force
are currently being discussed and changes will
be implemented in the coming days.
The editorial board notes, however, that
many of the necessary changes regarding
mental health must come at a grassroots level.

Bridge and CAPS serve their purpose ad
mirably, and resources like the Office for Re
ligious Life,community centers and residence
staff are plentiful across campus. The bigger
challenge to overcome on campus, however, is
reducing the stigma barrier preventing stu
dents from hiding their problems and fighting
them alone. Furthermore,other students must
be aware of how to listen to, and speak with,
struggling peers. To that end. student organi
zations like Stanford Peace of Mind (SPOM)
and Mirror can greatly benefit the Stanford
campus, both by raising awareness and teach
ing openness.
While considering mental health issues,
this campus must also recognize the signifi
cant differences between its undergraduate
and graduate populations. ITie demands and
outside stresses on these two groups vary
tremendously, so any improvement would
necessarily take into account both groups in
dividually.
During the past few weeks of ASSU cam
paigning, a recurring theme across the plat
forms. both of aspiring senators and execu
tives, was the need for mental health reform.
Candidates listed many ideas for improving
mental health resources on campus: expand
ing CAPS' 10 free sessions for students; ensur
ing continuity in treatment by guaranteeing
repeat appointments with the same thera
pists; and adding more psychiatrists to the
staff. We worry about how much of this can re
alistically be implemented, but we are encour
aged by the attention. Confronting such a nu
anced and intractable problem requires full
attention, as well as bilateral cooperation be
tween students and the ac ninistration. Upon
the unveiling of the recommendations of the
task force, we hope that both student-run or
ganizations and relative administrative de
partments take heed of these suggestions and
renew their dedication to mental health.
