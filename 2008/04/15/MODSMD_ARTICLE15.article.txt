# Pleading Inanity
## No way out 
### 
In 1972, Melbourne University Professor
Peter Singer published his seminal work
"Famine, Affluence and Morality." Start
ing with assumptions that are prima facie be
yond dispute. Singer effectively threw into
question the baseline morality of the lives
that almost ail of us choose to live. Although
plenty of ink has been spilled since then in
response to his argumentation — and in de
fense of the rest of us — his core argumenta
tion remains as powerful as it is deeply un
settling, especially when we move away from
abstractions and are forced to confront our
tenuous morality face-to-face.
Singer's basic premises are as follows: 1.
Suffering from lack of food, shelter and
medical care is bad, and 2. If we can prevent
something bad from happening without sac
rificing anything of comparable importance,
we ought to do it. Taken alone, each of these
statements seems both innocuous and obvi
ous; taken together, however, they imply a
radical re-conceptualization of our lives and
the world around us.
I had Singer's argument on my mind when
our human rights clinic took a tour of the
most impoverished areas surrounding Wind
hoek. the capital city of Namibia. During my
time in the Peace Corps in El Salvador, I had
confronted wealth inequality by living with
out the amenities that I always took for grant
ed: constant electricity.paved roads, hot water
and AC when the temperature broke 112 de
grees. In Namibia, the country with the largest
income inequality gap in the world, I con
fronted inequality with a fannie pack around
my waist, camera around my neck and an "I
heart NY"t-shirt on my back.
The problematic nature of "poverty
tours" aside, the scenes we faced were heart
wrenching. Part of me wants to vividly de
scribe to you what I saw, because if you could
imagine it then we'd have a baseline for dis
cussion. Yet the problem with pulling heart
string with images of non-Caucasian chil
dren with swollen stomachs encircled with
flies is that we run the risk of losing sight of
the irreducible complexity of these societies.
The majority of Americans will never have
personal contact with the developing world,
and viewing it through this lens alone leaves
us with as skewed a perspective as viewing
America through the lens of the Iraq War.
I know that people feel good about them
selves when they believe that their donation
to development organizations helps improve
the lives of hopeless people in miserable sit
uations. Still, I am confident that even after

we recognize that Namibia, like everywhere
in the world, consists of rich, meaningful cul
tures, deep, extensive histories and nuanced,
individualized narratives, we'll still have
quite compelling moral reasons to raise the
living standards of the multitudes of people
who subsist on profanely few resources.
That's where Singer's argumentation be
comes relevant. I think it's morally bad that
many villages in El Salvador have no
schools, and I think it's morally bad that
HIV-positive Namibians often face great
stigma and discrimination, in addition to
difficulty obtaining medication. Even
though working on the ground in these
countries entails great sacrifices, making
small monetary donations surely doesn't.
For me, when 1 gaze into the eyes of those
without adequate educational opportuni
ties or medical care (or shelter or clean run
ning water or food), I feel that some funda
mental idea of justice is violated if I don't do
my part to help.
The question I think we all have to an
swer for ourselves is, "What is my part?"
Some might choose to work on the ground;
others might choose to coordinate from
afar. Some might give large amounts of their
assets to alleviating global poverty; others
might donate much less. As far as I'm con
cerned, as long as we all choose to seriously
engage the issues at hand, we're more or less
OK from a moral perspective.
Sadly, Singer wouldn't be as lenient with
us, and the philosophy is probably on his
side. Once we recognize that billions around
the world live on less than $2 a day. how can
we justify inaction or even partial action? Is
there a way to feel at peace with spending as
much as we do on nonessentials when that
same money could help promote human
dignity around the world? As I gaze into the
eyes of the individuals on the ground whose
lives could be so much better, I can't help
but think that the answer to both is no.

Feel free to pass up that next expensive elec
tronic gadget and donate to OXFAM instead.
