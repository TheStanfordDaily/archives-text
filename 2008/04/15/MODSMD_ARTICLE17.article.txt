## The 						Olympics are insane 
### 
This column is the second in my occa
sional "Insane" series. The first was
about Ron Paul, which earned me l(XX)
comments from libertarian nutcases.
Anyway, I love sports. Most of them, any
way: I couldn't care less about snowboarding
or the steeplechase. I don't even know what
the steeplechase is. And because I am a
sports fan, the Olympics, the 2(X)8 edition of
which approaches late this summer, is to be
something I dread, something we all should
be dreading, rather than anticipating eagerly.
The most offensive part of the Olympics,
which is a sporting event, and only a sporting
event, is the sometimes-religious and some
times-fascist imagery and symbolism that
surrounds every aspect of it. The Beijing
Olympics Web site erroneously claims that
the tradition of the torch relay, which some
how is important enough to take place on
every continent, began in ancient Greece. In
stead, Hitler first used it in 1936 as part of the
Third Reich's propaganda campaign sur
rounding the Berlin Games.The interlocking
five rings were also introduced in Berlin, al
though Leni Riefenstahl, a legendary Nazi
filmmaker, had them carved into the ancient
Olympic site in Greece, giving them the
sheen of legitimacy. It's terrifying that the
Olympic Games are using fascist symbols
which give the games the visual appearance
of being far more important than they should
be.
At the same time, Olympic Games pro
moters use religious imagery. Many official
sites call the fire "sacred." No other major
sporting event in the past century would be
able to claim the mantle of religious legitima
cy and importance, but somehow, the
Olympics, which of course had strong origins
in pagan ritual,can claim to be sacred.This is
sports, remember? It's just a sporting event!
Could the Super Bowl or the World Cup ever
use such symbols without being over
whelmed with criticism? This "Olympic ex

ceptionalism" is nuts! The people who made
the Games seem so important are multina
tional corporations and fascists!
It should be noted that the ludicrously
named "Olympic Movement," a collection of
organizations that run the games, has zeal
ously maintained a copyright over most
Olympic symbols, ensuring that they will
only be used by official sponsors. The
Olympics is, in essence, a carefully managed
brand — far more than it is an actual sport
ing event.
The Olympics even aspires, ludicrously, to
solve world peace, by asking countries to put
down their arms during the games. I am not
sure how this works,other than simply claim
ing it's true, but watching swimming races
does not make me suddenly want to love my
neighbor. Good luck with that one, China.
Those Tibetan protestors will probably be
more active, not less, during the Games. The
Olympics, which, if you remember, is a sport
ing event, should not be a part of internation
al politics.
It is likely that giving the Games such im
portance through what is admittedly brilliant
brand management is simply to make it rele
vant and profitable. This detracts from,
rather than adding to, the sporting events
that happen to go on during all the advertis
ing and religious moralizing. But there's one
obvious question: without the symbolic im
portance attached to the Olympics, would
more than a few people bother to watch it?
It's hard to care about the steeplechase or
rifle shooting. Without the signifiers, "THIS

IS THE OLYMPICS! IMPORTANT!" peo
ple might not watch. The World Cup, on the
other hand, features a sport that billions of
people are already passionate about. With
out the importance attached to the games
(which is really just a construction by the
sponsors and the "Olympic Movement"), en
tire cottage industries would dry up.
Hitler's biggest contribution, however, is
the use of the Olympics for political purpos
es. What should be a sporting event has been
abused time and time again to advance the
political agenda of the host countries. Politics
goes both ways, though — some countries
use the Games to protest the actions of the
host countries, as well. In 1980.65 nations led
by the U.S.? boycotted the games in Moscow
protesting the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. More recently, the People's Re
public o' China is guilty of politicizing the
Games, as well.The Chinese government cer
tainly intended for these Olympics to legit
imize China's increasing economic and soft
power. By using the Games to attend politi
cal ends, however, China has opened itself,
rightfully, to increasing criticism from pro
democratic countries and human rights
groups. Some Chinese have talked about
"buyer's remorse" and the Games costing
China more PR than it was worth.
Chances are I will be watching the
Olympics this summer, even though Bob
Costas is the most annoying person on TV.
We're going to see lots of soft-lit mini-biogra
phies of athletes who overcame adversity to
dominate their obscure sport. But everyone
watching should treat it for what it is — an
enormous festival of obscure sports —
rather than ascribe some higher moral, reli
gious or political process to it.

Stuart is currently wikipediaing what "the stee
plechase" is. He wonders what steeples are, and
why people chase them. If you know, tell him
(please!) at shaimeMstanford. edu.
