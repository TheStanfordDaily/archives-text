# Researchers to study hypersonic flight

### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Flying at hypersonic speeds may
someday be possible thanks to
research at Stanford.
A $17 million grant will fund
researchers at Stanford, working

with the U.S. Department of Energy,
to develop simulations of hypersonic
flight vehicles.
Hypersonic flight occurs at
speeds five times faster than the
speed of sound.
Researchers will work to develop
algorithms to model the physical
phenomena of hypersonic flight,
such as turbulence and aerodynam
ics, using some the world's fastest
supercomputers.
The project will involve 16 faculty
members from the Mechanical
Engineering, Computer Science,
Chemical Engineering, Aeronautics
and Astronautics and Mathematics
departments.
