## CLEAN SWEEP No. 2 Cardinal women earn big wins over Cal, UC-Irvine 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
In any sport.a team's rivalry game and sen
ior day are often the two most emotional
matches of the season. There is always an
added air of significance in these contests, re
gardless of the team's ranking, record or re
cent form; focus becomes doubly important.
So with Big Splash against Cal on Friday
night and Senior Day against UC-lrvine on
Sunday, the No. 2 Stanford women's water
polo team knew it was going to be a challeng
ing home-stand. The team kept its focus,
though, picking up two more wins and a big
emotional boost heading into the final week
of the regular season.
This year's edition of Big Splash was not
only a match-up of fierce rivals, hut also of two
of the top teams in the nation, with the Gold
en Bears ranked No. 6.
The physical tone of the game was set right
from the beginning, as Stanford had two play
ers ejected during the first minute. Cal would
take advantage of the ensuing 6-on-4 situation
to open the scoring with a goal from Molly
I layes. I lowever. the Card came right back,
tying the score just 14 seconds later with a goal
from junior driver I leather West. Junior driv
er kira I lillman put Stanford ahead with 1:38
left in the quarter, and the opening period
ended with the score at 2-1.
Cal tied the game at 2-2 about three min
utes into the second period, before I lillman
doubled her tally on the day with a beautiful
lob. Cal was awarded a five-meter shot with
2:27 remaining in the half, though, and the

Bears' Meghan Corso converted to knot the
game up again.
The defenses took control for most of the
third quarter, but just when it looked like it
might be a scoreless period, Stanford snatched
two goals in the final two minutes, one a long
shot from sophomore driver Kelly Eaton and
one a breakaway by junior driver Lauren Sil
ver after a long outlet pass from freshman
goalkeeper Amber Oland.
Down 5-3 heading into the final period of
play.Cal got a quick goal from Paige Lorenz to
make it a one-goal game again. 1 lowever. 1 lill
man struck once more, completing her hat
trick in a 6-on-5 situation with 5:27 remaining.
The Bears scored again two minutes later
to make the score 6-5. but the Cardinal de
fense held the rest of the way with Oland —
who stopped 13 shots on the day — making a
last-second save and clearance to secure the
victory - .
"We knew we were going to have to work
really hard, because [the Bears] always come
out hard and never give up against us," Hill
man said. "Even though we didn't play our
best, we kept working hard on defense and
eventually made our opportunities on of
fense."
"St) many fans from both schools come to
the game, and it's so fun to play with the stadi
um filled." she added.
"'lhe crowd and the close game made Big
Splash memorable for all of us." head coach
John Tanner added."Cal played very well, and
we struggled on offense, particularly in our 6-
on-5 power plays. But we got two impressive
goals late in the third quarter that put us in
control of the game."
Two days later, the Cardinal took on No. 8
UC-Irvine in what was the final regular-sea
son home game for seniors Jackie Gauthier
and Megan Nesland. After honoring the sen
iors before the game, the team came out a bit

fiat as Irvine took it to the Card.
ITie Anteaters rattled the frame of the goal
multiple times in the opening quarter hut
could not get the hall in the net. Stanford
would make them pay for their inability to
take the lead by grabbing a goal with just 31
seconds left in the quarter. In a repeat of Fri
day's game, it was Silver again counterattack
ing off a long pass from Oland.
That goal gave the team momentum head
ing into the second period, as freshman driver
Kim Krueger and I iillman made the score 3-0
in the Cardinal's favor with 2:32 remaining.
Kat Plummer fired home a five-meter shot for
the Anteaters, but Stanford would get two
more fast break goals courtesy of junior driv

er Megan May and sophomore driver Kelly
Eaton to make the halftime score 5-1.
Stanford would outscore Irvine 5-3 the
rest of the way. with Gauthier scoring goals
nine and 10 — her 100 th and 101st of her
Cardinal career — on two long shots to cap
the scoring for the Card. It was a balanced ef
fort for the team, with Gauthier, Eaton, Sil
ver and Krueger each scoring twice and Hill
man and May adding the others. It was an
other good day in goal for Oland. who
stopped nine shots.
Tanner was happy with the way his team
responded after the poor start.
"[W]e had a slow start to Senior Day, but
we had another scoring burst, this time in the

second quarter," he said."That gave us breath
ing room.
"Against Irvine, we knew we just had to
play our game," Hillman said. "It was fun to
honor our seniors, and we all had a good time
playing on such a nice hot day."
The two victories raise Stanford's record to
22-3 (10-1 MPSF) and bring the team's win
streak to 10 games. It also guarantees the
squad a No. 2 seed in the MPSF conference
tournament in two weeks, regardless of the
outcome of its match with San Jose State this
Saturday.

doubled her tally on the day with a beautiful
lob. Cal was awarded a five-meter shot with
2:27 remaining in the half, though, and the

Bears' Meghan Corso converted to knot the
game up again.
The defenses took control for most of the
third quarter, but just when it looked like it
might be a scoreless period, Stanford snatched
two goals in the final two minutes, one a long
shot from sophomore driver Kelly Eaton and
one a breakaway by junior driver Lauren Sil
ver after a long outlet pass from freshman

fense held the rest of the way with Oland —
who stopped 13 shots on the day — making a
last-second save and clearance to secure the
victory - .
"We knew we were going to have to work
really hard, because [the Bears] always come
out hard and never give up against us," Hill
man said. "Even though we didn't play our
best, we kept working hard on defense and
eventually made our opportunities on of
fense."
"St) many fans from both schools come to
the game, and it's so fun to play with the stadi
um filled." she added.
"'lhe crowd and the close game made Big
Splash memorable for all of us." head coach
John Tanner added."Cal played very well, and
we struggled on offense, particularly in our 6-
on-5 power plays. But we got two impressive
goals late in the third quarter that put us in
control of the game."
Two days later, the Cardinal took on No. 8
UC-Irvine in what was the final regular-sea
son home game for seniors Jackie Gauthier
and Megan Nesland. After honoring the sen
iors before the game, the team came out a bit

fiat as Irvine took it to the Card.
ITie Anteaters rattled the frame of the goal
multiple times in the opening quarter hut
could not get the hall in the net. Stanford
would make them pay for their inability to
take the lead by grabbing a goal with just 31
seconds left in the quarter. In a repeat of Fri
day's game, it was Silver again counterattack
ing off a long pass from Oland.
That goal gave the team momentum head
ing into the second period, as freshman driver
Kim Krueger and I iillman made the score 3-0
in the Cardinal's favor with 2:32 remaining.
Kat Plummer fired home a five-meter shot for
the Anteaters, but Stanford would get two
more fast break goals courtesy of junior driv

Eaton to make the halftime score 5-1.
Stanford would outscore Irvine 5-3 the
rest of the way. with Gauthier scoring goals
nine and 10 — her 100 th and 101st of her
Cardinal career — on two long shots to cap
the scoring for the Card. It was a balanced ef
fort for the team, with Gauthier, Eaton, Sil
ver and Krueger each scoring twice and Hill
man and May adding the others. It was an
other good day in goal for Oland. who
stopped nine shots.
Tanner was happy with the way his team
responded after the poor start.
"[W]e had a slow start to Senior Day, but
we had another scoring burst, this time in the

second quarter," he said."That gave us breath
ing room.
"Against Irvine, we knew we just had to
play our game," Hillman said. "It was fun to
honor our seniors, and we all had a good time
playing on such a nice hot day."
The two victories raise Stanford's record to
22-3 (10-1 MPSF) and bring the team's win
streak to 10 games. It also guarantees the
squad a No. 2 seed in the MPSF conference
tournament in two weeks, regardless of the
outcome of its match with San Jose State this
