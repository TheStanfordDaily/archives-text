## Admins reflect on Yale scam Gen. Counsel backs Yale, denies paralells to Kim 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
In the wake of Yale's recent case
of admission fraud, the General
Counsel of Stanford supported
Yale's decision to a prosecute the
student for forging parts of his appli
cation but drew distinctions
between the Yale case and
Stanford's own impostor situation
last year.
Admission officials at Yale are
facing one of the most significant
incidences of admission fraud in
recent years after transfer student
Akash Maharaj forged a letter of
recommendation and his transcript
to gain admission to Yale and
receive a $32,000 scholarship.
Stanford Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott said although
Stanford had not identified fraudu
lent admission documents in the last
two years, Stanford has received
them in the past.
"I'm not sure any university can
prevent forgery," Abbott said.
"While our credentials staff mem
bers in the Office of Undergraduate
Admission are trained to identify
official transcripts — looking for
watermark and raised seals — and
official test scores — identifiable by
a certain font/typeface that is used
by the College Board in reporting
scores — if someone wants to break
the law and forge documents, there
isn't much one can do to prevent
that kind of activity."
In an email to The Daily,
Stanford General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said that Yale officials
should choose the legal course th .*y
find best in response to the incident.
"It is Yale's decision as to
whether to revoke its admission,"
Zumwalt wrote. "I do not know the
details of what actually happened
or what Yale has done with regard
to the prosecution of the alleged
crime, but fraud is a serious crime
which is appropriate to report to
the police."
The New York Times reported
that, in addition to losing his admis
sion to Yale, Maharaj faces larceny
and forgery charges in the state of
Connecticut, as well as possible fed
eral charges for accepting federal
student loans while enrolled under
false pretenses.
Zumwalt stopped short of saying
that Stanford would pursue the
same course of action if a similar
incident of fraud occurred here, but
did promise a termination of enroll

ment.
"If a student commits fraud in
applying to Stanford, such as falsify
ing transcripts, the University wouid
revoke the student's admission." she
said.
While Zumwalt promised the
University would expel any student
who gained admission by fraud, and
would possibly seek legal prosecu
tion, she drew the distinction
between fraud and deception in jus
tifying Stanford's comparatively
lenient treatment of the Azia Kim
situation last spring.
In May 2007, Azia Kim was
caught posing as a Stanford under
graduate, residing in two dorms,
attending classes and sneaking in
and out of the window of the room
where she was living illegally.
While Kim took advantage of the
University and exploited its
resources, the difference between
her case and Maharaj's. said
Zumwalt, is that Kim simply showed
up and pretended to be a student
rather than applying for admission
with fake forms and information.
"Of course, Ms. Kim's situation
was different, as she was not admit
ted to Stanford and did not receive
money under false pretenses,"
Zumwalt said. "Taking meals and

lodging without paying can be a
crime, but whether or not such
crimes are actually prosecuted is up
to the police and the District
Attorney — for state crimes —or
the U.S. Attorney for federal
crimes."
Several students, including Ron
Poniper '11, also stressed the distinc
tion between Kim's case and the
incident at Yale.
"1 can definitely see why Yale is
pressing charges, but that's kind of
different," Pomper said. "He defi
nitely forged his way to get in. She
didn't get in, but was just staying on
campus."
Dani Zhao 09. who knew Azia
Kim personally, added that she did
not believe prosecuting her would
help anyone, but would likely cause
further harm to an already troubled
girl.
"Knowing who she was, 1 think
that taking her to court would have
exacerbated the situation even
more," Zhao said. "She obviously
had some problems that she needed
to work out, and I think that taking
her through the legal system would
have made things even worse."
