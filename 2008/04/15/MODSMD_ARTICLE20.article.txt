### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford baseball team (18-11-1.
6-3 Pac-10) defeated Santa Clara (19-14) in a
close pitching contest that resulted in a 3-1 win.
the Cardinal's third straight victory. Junior right
hander Max Fearnow was the key ingredient to
the non-conference win. pitching four scoreless
innings, striking out four and allowing just three
hits.
Fearnow was followed by freshman Drew
Storen, who recorded a save on the evening by

grabbing the final three outs. Freshman starter
Dan Sandbrink pitched a smooth four innings
and only allowed one solo homer in the top of
