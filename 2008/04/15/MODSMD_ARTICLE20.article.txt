## Cardinal rides strong pitching to 3-1 win over Santa Clara 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford baseball team (18-11-1.
6-3 Pac-10) defeated Santa Clara (19-14) in a
close pitching contest that resulted in a 3-1 win.
the Cardinal's third straight victory. Junior right
hander Max Fearnow was the key ingredient to
the non-conference win. pitching four scoreless
innings, striking out four and allowing just three
hits.
Fearnow was followed by freshman Drew
Storen, who recorded a save on the evening by

grabbing the final three outs. Freshman starter
Dan Sandbrink pitched a smooth four innings
and only allowed one solo homer in the top of
the third to Santa Clara's Matt Long. Fearnow
earned his second win of the season, which im
proved his record to 2-1.
"The mental strides that 1 have taken have
affected my game the most." Fearnow said. '"I
have been struggling lately, and 1 haven't been
pitching much. 1 wasn't approaching the game
right, but. tonight. 1 was attacking hitters, and 1
didn't walk anyone.
"Pitching at Stanford is tougher than [at] any

other school in country. [Head coach Mark Mar
quess] has a tendency to hit the panic button and
put in a new pitcher quickly. I had to get over
worrying about being pulled and what is going
on peripherally so that I can focus more on my
game."
Coach Marquess said he hoped to give all
pitchers on the team as much experience as pos
sible, especially in midweek games.
"Last night was a great effort," Marquess
said. "Tonight extended Fearnow a little. We
have been using him in tight situations in relief
play on weekends, but I thought it was impor

tant that he get to come in during the beginning
of an inning in order to see how he does in a dif
ferent situation. The fresh start worked for him
and should give him a big confidence boost."
The Cardinal's pitching seems to be improv
ing as the season progresses. Marquess has con
sistently put Storen in the closing position and
plans to keep him there throughout the season.
"Storen is wild and crazy, and he likes reliev
ing." Marquess said. "1 put him in this role, but,
since he is a freshman, this is all new to him. and
he doesn't really know what he can
do yet.This was his first time throwing
in hack-to-back games, which is
hard.... Storen is our closer because
he has a good attack mode."
Stanford's offense was not at its
best against Santa Clara, but was
nonetheless able to secure a two-run
lead. It all started in the bottom of the
second inning when junior Sean
Ratliff hit a leadoff solo shot off
Matthew Wickswat. bringing his
homerun count to 11 on the season.
Santa Clara answered with Long's
home run in the third to tie the score
at one. But Stanford went on to score
in both the third and the fourth in
nings.
Junior Cord Phelps picked up the
Cardinal offense in the third with a
single to right center field. Wickswat
then walked sophomore Toby Ger
hart. which allowed junior Jason Cas
tro to advance Phelps to third on a fly
ball out. It would be junior Brent
Milleville who would earn the RBI
though when his single brought in
Phelps, bringing the score to 2-1.
The fourth inning brought the
Cardinal another run scoring rally.
Freshman Ben Clowe started it off
with a single to left field. A sacrifice
bunt from freshman Zach Jones put
Clowe in scoring position, and fresh
man Jake Schlander nabbed the RBI
with a line-drive single, bringing the
score to 3-1, where it would remain

The No. 10 Stanford baseball team (18-11-1.
6-3 Pac-10) defeated Santa Clara (19-14) in a
close pitching contest that resulted in a 3-1 win.
the Cardinal's third straight victory. Junior right
hander Max Fearnow was the key ingredient to
the non-conference win. pitching four scoreless
innings, striking out four and allowing just three
hits.
Fearnow was followed by freshman Drew
Storen, who recorded a save on the evening by

grabbing the final three outs. Freshman starter
Dan Sandbrink pitched a smooth four innings
and only allowed one solo homer in the top of
the third to Santa Clara's Matt Long. Fearnow
earned his second win of the season, which im
proved his record to 2-1.
"The mental strides that 1 have taken have
affected my game the most." Fearnow said. '"I
have been struggling lately, and 1 haven't been
pitching much. 1 wasn't approaching the game
right, but. tonight. 1 was attacking hitters, and 1
didn't walk anyone.
"Pitching at Stanford is tougher than [at] any

other school in country. [Head coach Mark Mar
quess] has a tendency to hit the panic button and
put in a new pitcher quickly. I had to get over
worrying about being pulled and what is going
on peripherally so that I can focus more on my
game."
Coach Marquess said he hoped to give all
pitchers on the team as much experience as pos
sible, especially in midweek games.
"Last night was a great effort," Marquess
said. "Tonight extended Fearnow a little. We
have been using him in tight situations in relief
play on weekends, but I thought it was impor

tant that he get to come in during the beginning
of an inning in order to see how he does in a dif
ferent situation. The fresh start worked for him
and should give him a big confidence boost."
The Cardinal's pitching seems to be improv
ing as the season progresses. Marquess has con
sistently put Storen in the closing position and
plans to keep him there throughout the season.
"Storen is wild and crazy, and he likes reliev
ing." Marquess said. "1 put him in this role, but,
since he is a freshman, this is all new to him. and
he doesn't really know what he can
do yet.This was his first time throwing
in hack-to-back games, which is
hard.... Storen is our closer because
he has a good attack mode."
Stanford's offense was not at its
best against Santa Clara, but was
nonetheless able to secure a two-run
lead. It all started in the bottom of the
second inning when junior Sean
Ratliff hit a leadoff solo shot off
Matthew Wickswat. bringing his
homerun count to 11 on the season.
Santa Clara answered with Long's
home run in the third to tie the score
at one. But Stanford went on to score
in both the third and the fourth in
nings.
Junior Cord Phelps picked up the
Cardinal offense in the third with a
single to right center field. Wickswat
then walked sophomore Toby Ger
hart. which allowed junior Jason Cas
tro to advance Phelps to third on a fly
ball out. It would be junior Brent
Milleville who would earn the RBI
though when his single brought in
Phelps, bringing the score to 2-1.
The fourth inning brought the
Cardinal another run scoring rally.
Freshman Ben Clowe started it off
with a single to left field. A sacrifice
bunt from freshman Zach Jones put
Clowe in scoring position, and fresh
man Jake Schlander nabbed the RBI
with a line-drive single, bringing the
score to 3-1, where it would remain
