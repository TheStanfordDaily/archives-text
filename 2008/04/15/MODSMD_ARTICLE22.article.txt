## Taking over for Trent 
### 
It's been a tough couple of weeks
for Stanford basketball. After
both Brook and Robin Lopez de
cided to turn pro, legendary Cardinal
coach Mike Montgomery decided to
leave the Athletics Department to
take over archrival California's bas
ketball team. The icing on the cake
was this past Wednesday, when it was
reported that current Stanford coach
Trent Johnson would leave the Farm
for LSU.
In the span of 10 days, Stanford
lost four of the most crucial pieces to
its men's basketball program. As 1
outlined last week, there are players
on the team (and a few coming in
next fall) who can help make up for
the loss of the Lopez twins' produc
tion. It won't be easy — still, it's
doable.
But who will lead the team? Who
will keep Stanford basketball at its
current, high-achieving level? And
who will recruit the nation's top play
ers? Johnson leaves a gaping hole at
the top of the Cardinal program —
finding the right replacement will no
doubt be Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby's top priority until the situ
ation is resolved.
Who, then, shall take the reins? 1
have identified four top candidates
for the job, plus one dark horse,
based on their recruiting and pro
gram success, as well as their Stan
ford and west coast ties: Gonzaga's
Mark Few. Washington State's Tony
Bennett, Pittsburgh's Jamie Dixon,
Nevada's Mark Fox and San Diego's
Brad Holland.
Mark Few
Few coaches have been as suc
cesslul as Mark Few. who. in his nine
years as Gonzaga's head coach, has
made the NCAA Tournament each
year and won the West Coast Confer
ence eight times, all en route to an
outstanding 236-60 record.
Few was considered an early can
didate for the Stanford job in 2004,
when Montgomery left the Farm to
coach the NBAs Golden State War
riors. Even though Few was men
tioned for many top coaching posi
tions. he repeatedly turned them
down to remain at Gonzaga; howev
er, according to the Spokesman-Re
view, the Stanford job was tine of the
only ones Few had shown interest in.
Throughout his time in Spokane,
Few has been able to turn mid-level
recruits into top players — Dan
Dickau and Adam Morrison, both
overlooked by top-tier programs, be
