## Taking over for Trent 
### 
It's been a tough couple of weeks
for Stanford basketball. After
both Brook and Robin Lopez de
cided to turn pro, legendary Cardinal
coach Mike Montgomery decided to
leave the Athletics Department to
take over archrival California's bas
ketball team. The icing on the cake
was this past Wednesday, when it was
reported that current Stanford coach
Trent Johnson would leave the Farm
for LSU.
In the span of 10 days, Stanford
lost four of the most crucial pieces to
its men's basketball program. As 1
outlined last week, there are players
on the team (and a few coming in
next fall) who can help make up for
the loss of the Lopez twins' produc
tion. It won't be easy — still, it's
doable.
But who will lead the team? Who
will keep Stanford basketball at its
current, high-achieving level? And
who will recruit the nation's top play
ers? Johnson leaves a gaping hole at
the top of the Cardinal program —
finding the right replacement will no
doubt be Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby's top priority until the situ
ation is resolved.
Who, then, shall take the reins? 1
have identified four top candidates
for the job, plus one dark horse,
based on their recruiting and pro
gram success, as well as their Stan
ford and west coast ties: Gonzaga's
Mark Few. Washington State's Tony
Bennett, Pittsburgh's Jamie Dixon,
Nevada's Mark Fox and San Diego's
Brad Holland.
Mark Few
Few coaches have been as suc
cesslul as Mark Few. who. in his nine
years as Gonzaga's head coach, has
made the NCAA Tournament each
year and won the West Coast Confer
ence eight times, all en route to an
outstanding 236-60 record.
Few was considered an early can
didate for the Stanford job in 2004,
when Montgomery left the Farm to
coach the NBAs Golden State War
riors. Even though Few was men
tioned for many top coaching posi
tions. he repeatedly turned them
down to remain at Gonzaga; howev
er, according to the Spokesman-Re
view, the Stanford job was tine of the
only ones Few had shown interest in.
Throughout his time in Spokane,
Few has been able to turn mid-level
recruits into top players — Dan
Dickau and Adam Morrison, both
overlooked by top-tier programs, be
came first team Ail-Americans.
Few is currently under contract
with Gonzaga until 2015, although
there is a buyout option in place.
Tony Bennett
Bennett is a young coach who has
already made his mark: he took over
a fledging Washington State pro
gram in 2006 and immediately
turned the Cougars into one of the
top teams in the Pac-10. He won Na
tional Coach of the Year honors in
2007 and took WSU to the Sweet 16
this year.
He was considered a candidate
for both the Cal and Indiana jobs
just a few weeks ago. although both
jobs went to other coaches. Rumor
has it that he was unhappy in Pull
man and was looking for an exit —
his top two players. Derrick Low and
Kyle Weaver, are graduating this fall.
Despite this, he told the press at the
beginning of the month that he will
stay at WSU for at least one more
year. Nevertheless, he is currently in
the discussion for the Oklahoma
State position.
He should be a top choice in the
Stanford debate, too.
Jamie Dixon
Dixon is seemingly an odd choice
for this list: he's the only east coast
coach mentioned,and he already has
a top job. But Dixon is a protege of
UCLA coach Ben 112 lowland and was
born and raised in California — be
fore becoming an assistant to How
land at Pitt in 1999, he had coached
exclusively on the west coast and in
Hawaii. His name has come up in a
number of west coast jobs, such as

Cal this year.
Since taking over for Howland at
Pitt. Dixon has been remarkably
successful, advancing past the
NCAA first round in all but one of
his five years. Ife is a strong recruiter
and has been successful in that re
gard against the Big East's (and
other conference's) best coaches.
Mark Fox
Fox took over for Johnson when
he left for Stanford in 2004 — he has
subsequently won the Western Ath
letic Conference regular season
championship in each of his four
years at the Wolfpack's helm.
He has established himself as a
good west coast recruiter and, like
Few. has been able to craft his young
players into some of the nation's
best — Nick Fazekas (a Johnson re
cruit) was named WAC Player of the
Year three times under Fox.
Brad Holland
In a group of top coaches. Hol
land is a dark horse candidate. He is
the only one without a job currently
— having been fired by San Diego
last year — but has the most head
coaching experience of the five, and
is the winningest coach in the
school's history.
Additionally, as the coach of the
Torreros for nearly a decade and a
half, he established himself as a pre
mier west coast recruiter—nearly
every player on the team that beat
Connecticut in this year's NCAA
Tournament was recruited by Hol
land. He also worked under more
stringent academic restrictions at
San Diego, much like he would have
to do at Stanford.

number of west coast jobs, such as

Cal this year.
Since taking over for Howland at
Pitt. Dixon has been remarkably
successful, advancing past the
NCAA first round in all but one of
his five years. Ife is a strong recruiter
and has been successful in that re
gard against the Big East's (and
other conference's) best coaches.
Mark Fox
Fox took over for Johnson when
he left for Stanford in 2004 — he has
subsequently won the Western Ath
letic Conference regular season
championship in each of his four
years at the Wolfpack's helm.
He has established himself as a
good west coast recruiter and, like
Few. has been able to craft his young
players into some of the nation's
best — Nick Fazekas (a Johnson re
cruit) was named WAC Player of the
Year three times under Fox.
Brad Holland
In a group of top coaches. Hol
land is a dark horse candidate. He is
the only one without a job currently
— having been fired by San Diego
last year — but has the most head
coaching experience of the five, and
is the winningest coach in the
school's history.
Additionally, as the coach of the
Torreros for nearly a decade and a
half, he established himself as a pre
mier west coast recruiter—nearly
every player on the team that beat
Connecticut in this year's NCAA
Tournament was recruited by Hol
land. He also worked under more
stringent academic restrictions at
San Diego, much like he would have
to do at Stanford.
