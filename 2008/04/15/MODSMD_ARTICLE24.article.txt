## Card captures first win of '08 at Peg Barnard Invite 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford made a late push on Sat
urday to come from behind to win the
Peg Barnard Invitational. It was the
Cardinal's first victory of the year.
"We're a very young team, and it's
the first win that we've had all year. It
feels great because we've been work
ing hard all year." sophomore Cathe
rina Wang said.
The tournament was the last of the
regular season and the final one Stan
ford will host this year. It lasted only
two rounds, whereas regular contests
last three.
Stanford finished at 23-over-par,
four shots ahead of second-place
Washington and eight strokes ahead
of third-place Oregon State.
However, the Cardinal needed a
strong final round to win the tourna
ment for the second straight year.
After one day of play, Stanford sat in
third place with a team score of 300
— California led with a composite
295, and Washington was close be
hind at 297.
But the Cardinal shot a tourna
ment-best 291 on the second day of
play to pull ahead of the Bears and the
1 luskies. Cal dropped off significantly
in the final round, shooting a 314 to
fall into a tie for fifth place with UC-
Davis, who elevated their position
with a 291. as well. The round was
highlighted for Stanford when junior
Ki-Shui Liao hit a hole-in-one on the
eighth hole.
Stanford was led by sophomore
Angela King, who finished at one
over-par. Her one-under-par total on
Saturday was the best of the Invita
tional and helped her wrap up second
place in the individual rankings.
Washington's Karinn Dickinson shot
even scores on both days to win the in
dividual competition. Junior Mari
Chun, who usually leads the Cardinal
attack, finished third overall at four
over-par.
Rounding out the team play for
the Cardinal was freshman Rebecca

Durham, who finished in seventh at
four-over-par. and Wang and fresh
man Piper Miller, who both finished
at 11-over.
Liao and senior Saana Rapakko
played individually in the Invitation
al — their seores did not count to
ward the team's total. Both shot 16-
over-par.
The Cardinal will now focus on the
Pac-10 Championship, which will he
held next week in Palos Verdes, where
Stanford competed in February. The
Cardinal finished fifth in the
Northrop Grumman Regional Chal
lenge against some of the toughest
competition in the country: that per
formance ranks among the best of the
year for Stanford.
"We had a great three rounds [at
Palos Verdes] in the winter." Wang
said.
The team will face similarly tough
opponents at the Pac-10 Champi
onship. as the conference is one of the
best in the country. Although the Car
dinal's win this weekend is significant,
it came at the hands of the weakest
field they have played all year —
whereas they normally face a number
of teams ranked in the top-10 in any
given tournament, the only school
ranked higher than then-No. 29 Stan
ford at the Barnard Invitational was
then-No 19Cal.
Despite moving up to No. 24 in the
rankings after its performance this
past weekend, the Cardinal is still
ranked behind a number of Pac-10
opponents,such as No. 1 UCLA.No.3
USC and No. 4 Arizona State.
Still, with the long-awaited win
now in their pocket, the Stanford
women are eager and confident head
ing into conference championships.
"I believe that we're going to do
well."said Wang."l believe that the win
will do phenomenal things for [the]
overall psyche of the team heading
into postseason...it just gives us more
momentum going into the Pac-lOs."
