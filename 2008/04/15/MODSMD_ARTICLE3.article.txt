## Merge threatens jobs Bear Stearns rescinds internship offers 
### MEGAN DOHENY 
For students who survive recruit
ing season at Stanford, a job offer
comes as a huge relief after months of
competitive interviews. But the
unlucky Stanford students, along with
hundreds of students across the coun
try. who accepted offers from Bear
Stearns, may he searching for new
employment this summer.
On Mar. 16, J. P. Morgan
announced that it was taking over
Bear Stearns in a shotgun merger.
ITie investment bank's unexpected
collapse forced it to rescind about
half of its 2008 summer internship
and job offers.
Jobs in some divisions of Bear
Stearns — both those within invest
ment banking such as commodities
and prime brokerage and separate
divisions like asset management —
will likely remain unaffected.
Theo Polan '09, who expects to
work in the fixed income division at
Bear Stearns this summer in New
York, admits he may be luckier than
most.
"Most people when they think of
Bear Stearns think of investment
banking, and this has been affected
in a negative way," Polan said. "I
know people who were supposed to
start full time in investment banking
for Bear Stearns, and now they're out
of these jobs. But this is just a frac
tion of what goes on. 1 don't expect
to be too affected by this because 1
am in fixed income."
Polan not only has the benefit of
being in an area outside of the invest
ment banking division, but he also
has the option of returning to last
summer's job — an engineering con
sulting firm — if this one does not
work out. Polan also said he is lucky
to be from New York and does not
have to deal with putting down a
housing deposit without knowing if
he will have a job there.
Others whose full-time offers
were rescinded will be able to keep
their signing and relocation bonuses
and still have access to career-service
resources at J.P Morgan.
Brian Marchiony, a spokesman
for J.P Morgan Chase, has recently
been communicating with students
to tell them whether or not their job
offers have been rescinded.
"We want to make decisions
quickly because we don't want stu
dents waiting to find out what they'll
be doing for the summer,"
Marchiony said.
He also made it clear that J.P.
Morgan will continue to honor the
offers that it gave to students this
year and added that some Bear
Stearns offers will remain in effect.
"The offers that will continue to
be honored will be those offers
where there is no overlap in the busi
ness with J.P. Morgan," he said.
Students whose internships were
rescinded will still earn the 10-week
salary they would have received had
they worked at Bear Stearns, and will
now be able to work for a non-profit
for the summer through J.P. Morgan.
"Building a strong pipeline of
young talented people from Stanford
remains a huge priority for J.P.
Morgan," Marchiony said.
