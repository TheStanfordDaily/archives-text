# Ph.D. candidate diversity sought
## Stanford supports women and ethnic minorities, implements DARE Fellowship Program 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to increase faculty diversity,
Stanford is focusing on long-term solutions
by encouraging more women and underrep
resented minorities (URMs) to pursue
Ph. D.sand academic careers.
This spring, the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education will launch the Diversifying
Academia, Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
Fellowship Program, providing two-year fel
lowships for students interested in academia.
The effort marks an attempt to combat
the "pipeline" problem, which is based on the
idea that a shortage of diverse graduate stu
dents reduces the number of diverse faculty.
Professor Donna Nelson of Oklahoma
University, a leader in faculty diversity
research, published a 2007 report that found
that blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans
are underrepresented at each point in acade

mia. Figures for women are more encourag
ing, although Nelson found that female
undergraduates in chemistry, math and
astronomy often lack same-gender role mod
els and mentors.
Nelson's is one of several similar studies
that have helped spur efforts to tackle the
pipeline problem at Stanford.
"Our student body is so diverse in com
parison to our faculty," said Associate Vice
Provost for Faculty Development and
Diversity Jacvn Lewis. "With that striking
gap in the demographics, people are now tak
ing notice. And we're beginning to act in a
systematic way."
Professors and administrators highlighted
the effect of community and cultural atti
tudes on the decision by many URMs to pur
sue professional opportunities or schooling
— especially law, medicine and business —
over academic paths as a key factor in the
disparity.

"Some students are coming from commu
nities where not many people have an under
graduate education," said Laura Selznick,
special assistant for diversity outreach in the
Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education. "It's hard for par
ents to understand why you would want to
learn more. So we need to have respectful
conversations with families, who might not
know what an academic career would look
like."
"Doctors and lawyers are paid well, and
they have a real status within the communi
ty" she added. "We're helping students to get
an idea of the benefits of other careers."
'ITiose involved in the effort emphasized
that the end goal is not an artificial quota or
a reduction of standards.
"People have to see diversity in relation to
excellence," said Drama Prof. Harry Elam.
"And we're not reducing excellence, we're
increasing excellence and possibilities. And

it's critical, given the changing diversity of
our school, other schools and. really, the
whole country."
The DARE program will play a key role
in drawing more minorities to academia, and
will run as a pilot program for the next four
years. The first 12 fellows will be selected in
the spring.
"The program works on the academic
pipeline in two ways," said Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Patricia Gumport.
"First, to prepare the Fellows by providing
mentoring, structured seminars, peer support
and information about the wide range of aca
demic career options; and. second, by giving
the Fellows an opportunity to encourage
undergraduates to consider grad school and
academic careers."
"This initiative is unique nationally
because it also includes a handful of acting
assistant professorships for which
each cohort of DARE Fellows can
compete at the end of their pro
gram." she added.
But DARE is not the
University's only effort at improv
ing graduate diversity. A corner
stone of Stanford's efforts to
increase diversity in Ph.D. candi
dates is the Mellon Mays
Undergraduate Fellowship pro
gram. which provides support to
students who have "an interest in a
career in college or university
teaching" and a "demonstrated
commitment to diversity, broadly
defined."
"It's a great financial boon to
those selected," Elam said. "And it
helps develop a community of
scholars." He added that the pro
gram is looking to expand.
Administrators and faculty also
emphasized the importance of men
toring and role models in providing
guidance, especially in informing
students of the opportunities of an
academic career.
"All students need to be advised
early in their undergraduate career

on how to prepare for the possibili
ty of graduate school," said Physics
Prof. Patricia Burchat. 'in physics,
for example, this means that stu
dents should pursue summer
research while an undergraduate. 1
have advised students who tell me
that they haven't considered sum
mer research because they need to
work in the summer to make some
money to support their education;
they are then surprised to learn that
there are programs that will pay
them to do research in the summer.
These 'obvious' facts need to be
made explicit to all students.
Otherwise, it's an old-boys network
that determines who is well pre
pared to apply to graduate school."
The 2008 Distinguished Alumni
Day aims to provide students with a
chance to see the range of opportu
nities and experiences available to
URMs and women who pursue aca
demic careers.
"It allows us to show the number
and breadth of scholars from differ
ent disciplines," Lewis said. "If fac
ulty reflect the students they are
teaching, it makes it so much more
noticeable"
All involved in the effort, how
ever. recognized that Stanford's
role in the process will have to fit
into a larger and more complicated
national picture.

"I'm really proud of what
Stanford is doing." said Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare. "But these are
problems that go all the way back to
grade school, deep problems.
There's no quick solution. And
we're going to need leadership on
that."
"Stanford does a pretty good job
of opening up the campus to
URMs," said fourth-year Chemistry
graduate student Charles McCrory.
"But the long and short of it is that
Stanford can't really do anything
besides make a step in the right
direction."
Others emphasized the value of
Stanford's symbolic leadership in
pushing for diversity.
"For any one university, there
isn't much effect." said fifth-year
Mechanical Engineering student
Cullen Buie, who is a member of
the Graduate Student Council's
Diversity Advocacy Committee.
"But if Stanford takes a leadership
role, people notice. You hear about
this pipeline problem, and we all
know about that, but are we doing
anything to increase the pipeline?
I'd prefer Stanford to say, let's dic
tate how society is going, and be a
leader in the world."

"But the long and short of it is that
Stanford can't really do anything
besides make a step in the right
direction."
Others emphasized the value of
Stanford's symbolic leadership in
pushing for diversity.
"For any one university, there
isn't much effect." said fifth-year
Mechanical Engineering student
Cullen Buie, who is a member of
the Graduate Student Council's
Diversity Advocacy Committee.
"But if Stanford takes a leadership
role, people notice. You hear about
this pipeline problem, and we all
know about that, but are we doing
anything to increase the pipeline?
I'd prefer Stanford to say, let's dic
tate how society is going, and be a
leader in the world."

In an effort to increase faculty diversity,
Stanford is focusing on long-term solutions
by encouraging more women and underrep
resented minorities (URMs) to pursue
Ph. D.sand academic careers.
This spring, the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education will launch the Diversifying
Academia, Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
Fellowship Program, providing two-year fel
lowships for students interested in academia.
The effort marks an attempt to combat
the "pipeline" problem, which is based on the
idea that a shortage of diverse graduate stu
dents reduces the number of diverse faculty.
Professor Donna Nelson of Oklahoma
University, a leader in faculty diversity
research, published a 2007 report that found
that blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans
are underrepresented at each point in acade

mia. Figures for women are more encourag
ing, although Nelson found that female
undergraduates in chemistry, math and
astronomy often lack same-gender role mod
els and mentors.
Nelson's is one of several similar studies
that have helped spur efforts to tackle the
pipeline problem at Stanford.
"Our student body is so diverse in com
parison to our faculty," said Associate Vice
Provost for Faculty Development and
Diversity Jacvn Lewis. "With that striking
gap in the demographics, people are now tak
ing notice. And we're beginning to act in a
systematic way."
Professors and administrators highlighted
the effect of community and cultural atti
tudes on the decision by many URMs to pur
sue professional opportunities or schooling
— especially law, medicine and business —
over academic paths as a key factor in the
disparity.

"Some students are coming from commu
nities where not many people have an under
graduate education," said Laura Selznick,
special assistant for diversity outreach in the
Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education. "It's hard for par
ents to understand why you would want to
learn more. So we need to have respectful
conversations with families, who might not
know what an academic career would look
like."
"Doctors and lawyers are paid well, and
they have a real status within the communi
ty" she added. "We're helping students to get
an idea of the benefits of other careers."
'ITiose involved in the effort emphasized
that the end goal is not an artificial quota or
a reduction of standards.
"People have to see diversity in relation to
excellence," said Drama Prof. Harry Elam.
"And we're not reducing excellence, we're
increasing excellence and possibilities. And

it's critical, given the changing diversity of
our school, other schools and. really, the
whole country."
The DARE program will play a key role
in drawing more minorities to academia, and
will run as a pilot program for the next four
years. The first 12 fellows will be selected in
the spring.
"The program works on the academic
pipeline in two ways," said Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Patricia Gumport.
"First, to prepare the Fellows by providing
mentoring, structured seminars, peer support
and information about the wide range of aca
demic career options; and. second, by giving
the Fellows an opportunity to encourage
undergraduates to consider grad school and
academic careers."
"This initiative is unique nationally
because it also includes a handful of acting
assistant professorships for which
each cohort of DARE Fellows can
compete at the end of their pro
gram." she added.
But DARE is not the
University's only effort at improv
ing graduate diversity. A corner
stone of Stanford's efforts to
increase diversity in Ph.D. candi
dates is the Mellon Mays
Undergraduate Fellowship pro
gram. which provides support to
students who have "an interest in a
career in college or university
teaching" and a "demonstrated
commitment to diversity, broadly
defined."
"It's a great financial boon to
those selected," Elam said. "And it
helps develop a community of
scholars." He added that the pro
gram is looking to expand.
Administrators and faculty also
emphasized the importance of men
toring and role models in providing
guidance, especially in informing
students of the opportunities of an
academic career.
"All students need to be advised
early in their undergraduate career

on how to prepare for the possibili
ty of graduate school," said Physics
Prof. Patricia Burchat. 'in physics,
for example, this means that stu
dents should pursue summer
research while an undergraduate. 1
have advised students who tell me
that they haven't considered sum
mer research because they need to
work in the summer to make some
money to support their education;
they are then surprised to learn that
there are programs that will pay
them to do research in the summer.
These 'obvious' facts need to be
made explicit to all students.
Otherwise, it's an old-boys network
that determines who is well pre
pared to apply to graduate school."
The 2008 Distinguished Alumni
Day aims to provide students with a
chance to see the range of opportu
nities and experiences available to
URMs and women who pursue aca
demic careers.
"It allows us to show the number
and breadth of scholars from differ
ent disciplines," Lewis said. "If fac
ulty reflect the students they are
teaching, it makes it so much more
noticeable"
All involved in the effort, how
ever. recognized that Stanford's
role in the process will have to fit
into a larger and more complicated
national picture.

"I'm really proud of what
Stanford is doing." said Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare. "But these are
problems that go all the way back to
grade school, deep problems.
There's no quick solution. And
we're going to need leadership on
that."
"Stanford does a pretty good job
of opening up the campus to
URMs," said fourth-year Chemistry
graduate student Charles McCrory.
"But the long and short of it is that
Stanford can't really do anything
besides make a step in the right
direction."
Others emphasized the value of
Stanford's symbolic leadership in
pushing for diversity.
"For any one university, there
isn't much effect." said fifth-year
Mechanical Engineering student
Cullen Buie, who is a member of
the Graduate Student Council's
Diversity Advocacy Committee.
