# Ph.D. candidate diversity sought
## Stanford supports women and ethnic minorities, implements DARE Fellowship Program 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to increase faculty diversity,
Stanford is focusing on long-term solutions
by encouraging more women and underrep
resented minorities (URMs) to pursue
Ph. D.sand academic careers.
This spring, the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education will launch the Diversifying
Academia, Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
Fellowship Program, providing two-year fel
lowships for students interested in academia.
The effort marks an attempt to combat
the "pipeline" problem, which is based on the
idea that a shortage of diverse graduate stu
dents reduces the number of diverse faculty.
Professor Donna Nelson of Oklahoma
University, a leader in faculty diversity
research, published a 2007 report that found
that blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans
are underrepresented at each point in acade

mia. Figures for women are more encourag
ing, although Nelson found that female
undergraduates in chemistry, math and
astronomy often lack same-gender role mod
els and mentors.
Nelson's is one of several similar studies
that have helped spur efforts to tackle the
pipeline problem at Stanford.
"Our student body is so diverse in com
parison to our faculty," said Associate Vice
Provost for Faculty Development and
Diversity Jacvn Lewis. "With that striking
gap in the demographics, people are now tak
ing notice. And we're beginning to act in a
systematic way."
Professors and administrators highlighted
the effect of community and cultural atti
tudes on the decision by many URMs to pur
sue professional opportunities or schooling
— especially law, medicine and business —
over academic paths as a key factor in the
disparity.

"Some students are coming from commu
nities where not many people have an under
graduate education," said Laura Selznick,
special assistant for diversity outreach in the
Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education. "It's hard for par
ents to understand why you would want to
learn more. So we need to have respectful
conversations with families, who might not
know what an academic career would look
like."
"Doctors and lawyers are paid well, and
they have a real status within the communi
ty" she added. "We're helping students to get
an idea of the benefits of other careers."
'ITiose involved in the effort emphasized
that the end goal is not an artificial quota or
a reduction of standards.
"People have to see diversity in relation to
excellence," said Drama Prof. Harry Elam.
"And we're not reducing excellence, we're
increasing excellence and possibilities. And

it's critical, given the changing diversity of
our school, other schools and. really, the
whole country."
The DARE program will play a key role
in drawing more minorities to academia, and
will run as a pilot program for the next four
years. The first 12 fellows will be selected in
the spring.
"The program works on the academic
pipeline in two ways," said Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Patricia Gumport.
"First, to prepare the Fellows by providing
mentoring, structured seminars, peer support
and information about the wide range of aca
demic career options; and. second, by giving
the Fellows an opportunity to encourage
undergraduates to consider grad school and
academic careers."
"This initiative is unique nationally
because it also includes a handful of acting
