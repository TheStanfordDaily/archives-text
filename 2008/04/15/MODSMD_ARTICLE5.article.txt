## Features Presents Cancer survivors celebrate life 
### CHELSEA MA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over one year ago, Kate
McGrath '10 and Joe Oehmke
'10 found themselves in dis
agreement with their class
mates in I HUM section. Rather than sup-

porting Leo Tolstoy's cynical approach to
life, they believed that living, with all its
obstacles, was worthwhile — a common
appreciation that opened up a friendship. It
wasn't until the end of the quarter when
they realized that what they shared was not
merely an opinion, but an experience: both
had survived cancer.
The two shared the details of their strug
gles and recoveries during the Luminaria

Ceremony last Friday night at Relay for
Life, the American Cancer Society's (ACS)
annual fundraising event.
McGrath and Oehmke's stories are simi
lar. Both were diagnosed when they were
15 — McGrath with acute lymphocytic
leukemia, Oehmke with F.wing's sarcoma, a
type of bone and soft tissue cancer. They
went through a cycle of shock, fear and
resolve. School and extracurricular activi
ties were shoved in the background as their

days became structured around trips to the
hospital for chemotherapy.
"The thing about cancer is that your life
to some degree tends to be dictated by the
requirements of treating that illness,"
Oehmke said."l had to plan my life around
my limitations and my hospital schedule, as
well as around what I could and could not
do because of the chemo."

pants, plus over 100 volunteers,
showed up at Roble Field to
remember those who passed away
and raise money to fund research.
The 24 hours were filled with
music and dance performances by
groups such as Mixed Company
and Swingtime, as well as fun
activities such as bobbing for
apples.
The event raised over $44,000,
lower than in previous years,
though the turnout was high.
"We changed our event back to
a Friday-Saturday event, which
doesn't seem to take over as much
of your weekend as a Saturday-
Sunday one," said co-chair Ana
Pena '09. "I think that may have
had something to do with the
turnout. The fact that Relay is
growing worldwide also helps."
For McGrath, Oehmke and
other cancer survivors, volunteer
ing for the event is what McGrath

described as a way of giving back
to the community that saved her.
Because ACS is a nonprofit organ
ization, funds used toward
research rely heavily on donations.
"Seeing people out there sup
porting this cause is so inspira
tional to me, and just gives me so
much hope," McGrath said. Her
chances of being cured were over
90 percent, and, according to her,
"that progress is a direct result of
volunteer effort."
And this is the main goal of
Relay for Life — to raise not just
money, but enthusiasm and a sin
cere belief in a cure for cancer.
Before a crowd standing in a circle
of lit candles, McGrath and
Oehmke communicated the beau
ty of recovery, of understanding
what is and is not important after
overcoming a life-threatening ill
ness.
"Dealing with cancer forces
you to take a step back from your
life and look at all the people and
things that make life worth living,"
Oehmke said at the ceremony. "It
taught me the amazing power of
family and friends, and taught me

to not only trust in my own inner
strength, but also in the strength
and support provided by everyone
around me."
McGrath expressed gratitude
upon seeing so many individuals
walking the track in support of
ACS's cause.
"Having my friends and family
there really means a great deal to
me — it's a very visual concept of
support she said. "Every year I'm
so grateful that people are able to
give themselves for one day to
fight against cancer. It's a huge
symbolic act."
