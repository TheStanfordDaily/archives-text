## Let there be beer STUDENTS IN EBF EXPLORE THE ART OF HOMEBREWING 
### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The search for a tasty brew
has consumed the nightlife
of college students for
eons. Sean Arenson '08 and
Carolyn Mansfield '08, res
idents in the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
(EBF). have an unusually direct ap
proach to acquiring good beer. They
make it themselves.
Ihe EBF brewing adventure began
when Mansfield, whose father is a home
brewer, gave her boyfriend, Johnny
DuPont '09, a homebrewing kit for
Christmas. Five brews later, it's a regular
part of their lives and something Arenson
says is "easier to do than someone who's
never done it before might think."
Both students find the activity a per
fect fit for the EBF ethos. "Co-ops are a
culture of beer appreciation," says Mans
field, citing brewing activity in other co
op houses, as well. Arenson adds that the
co-op culture of "go smaller" and con
sumption of fresh and non-commercial
products dovetails nicely with EBF's
earthy reputation.
I lomebrewing.the private production
of beer for personal enjoyment as op
posed to commercial gain, has taken off
in the United States in the last 30 years,
reviving a tradition that waned as beer
went from a farmhouse craft to a factory
operation. It draws devotees from all
walks of life — college students, blue-col
lar laborers, urban professionals,environ
mental stewards and those with a do-it
yourself attitude.
THE WORLD'S FIRST
REFRESHER
Thought to be the oldest manufac
tured beverage in human history, beer is,
by definition, a fermented alcoholic sub
stance made by mixing malted grain,
hops, water and yeast. Barley is the most
popular grain and the easiest to work
with, although wheat and rye can also be
use.
"Brewing" technically refers to the
boiling of ingredients before fermenta
tion, but the art of homebrewing is under
stood to include choosing a recipe, man
aging the boil, pitching the yeast and bot
tling and carbonating the beer.
Most agricultural peoples have pro
duced a beer-like beverage, using many
types of plants to balance the sweet malt
flavor. The use of the hop flower as a fla
voring and bit'ering agent became stan
dardized in beer in the 16th and 17th cen
turies and was codified in the German
Beer Purity Law of 1516.
Homebrewing in the United States
was fully legalized by Congress in 1978,
eliminating a holdover from Prohibition
era laws. Some states, such as Utah and
Alabama,still prohibit brewing without a
license.
THE START OF SOMETHING BIG
The first EBF beer was brewed in Jan
uary — a porter, an English dark ale, that
consumed not just the standard ingredi
ents but also a cell phone. After Arenson
insisted on compulsive sanitation at every
step, duPont mistakenly dropped his
phone into the brew just prior to bottling.
duPont further threatened to contami
nate the brew by sticking his arm in the
bucket to retrieve the phone.
The brew turned out unharmed, and
thus was born the distinctive name "Cin
gular Porter." Mansfield said the cell
phone store had never before heard such
an explanation for a broken phone.
Arenson was impressed with their
first product, and with duPont studying
abroad in Berlin this quarter, Arenson
has been promoted to unofficial EBF
brewmaster. He promises to do his men
tor proud. 'This quarter is going to be a
very prolific one."
HOW BREWING IS DONE
The most basic brewing kit, designed
for a five-gallon batch, includes a large
stove pot, an airlocked fermentation
bucket and a bottle capper. Homebrew
ingredients can be bought from several
sources. Arenson and Mansfield buy their
stock from a homebrew store in Los
Altos but several Bay Area shops and
multiple online vendors are available for
ingredients and equipment, as well as
valuable advice from those with experi
ence.
The basic process of homebrewing be
gins with bringing a pot of water to boil.
Water is a critical element in a beer style;
the famously hard water of English rivers
contributes to British ale styles, while Pil
sner Urquell uses soft water from world
renowned Czech wells.
Most homebrewers cannot control

their local water sources, but chemical
supplements are available to approxi
mate some desired mineral profiles.
Malt extract, either powered or syrup, is
added to the boiling water. The extract
provides the sugars that will, in turn, be
fermented into alcohol.
An advanced technique called all
grain brewing involves mashing the malt
ed grain itself into a porridge, activating
the malting enzymes that break down the
starch into fermentable sugars. This
process duplicates the one used by com
mercial breweries, but it isn't necessary
for producing great-tasting beer. Many
homebrewers, including the EBF crew,
get tasty results from extract brewing.
Hops are added at the beginning and
end of the approximately hour-long boil.
The hop oils are chemically changed by
the boiling process,causing the first batch
of hops to add a bitter flavor. Hops added
at the end of the boil provide flavor and
aroma.
After the liquid, called wort, is cooled,
it is placed in an airlocked bucket or glass
carboy; the yeast is added (or "pitched"),
and the fermentation process begins. In
an anaerobic (oxygen-free) process, the
yeast consumes sugars and produces car
bon dioxide, ethyl alcohol and a slew of
flavor products. 'Hie temperature at
which fermentation occurs, and whether
the yeast strain ferments on top of the
brew or at the bottom, has a strong effect
on the beer flavor.
Primary' fermentation completes after
about two days-lhe beer is normally then
transferred to another vessel and left to
settle and clarify for up to a month. Hops
and spice flavorings are sometimes added
in this phase ("dry-hopped") for an extra
kick. In addition to taste and smell, hops
provide an anti-bacterial effect, favoring
yeast growth and acting as a preservative
in the final product.
Finally, the beer is bottled. Carbona
tion is accomplished by adding sugar to
the brew before bottling, which re-acti
vates the yeast. With the bottles capped,
carbon dioxide goes into solution, giving
the brew its distinctive fizz. The beer is
drinkable within two weeks, although
aging for up to a year depending on style
can improve its flavor.
Meticulous sanitation is required at
every step to ensure the yeast does not
compete with other microbes in the fer
menter — the sort of attention to detail
that Arenson followed until duPont
dropped his phone in the beer. An infect
ed batch is not usually dangerous to the
drinker, it just tastes bad; in almost all
cases, multiplying yeast "crowd out"
other species, and contamination is rare.
As used glass bottles from store
bought beers can be reused, homebrew
ers tend to become inveterate
scroungers; according to Arenson, "you
find yourself asking someone drinking a
beer,' Can I have that bottle when you're
finished?'"
DONT CRAMP YOUR STYLE
The explosion in American home
brewing in the 1980s was a factor in the
rise of microbrewing and craft brewing
(similar terms for the commercial pro
duction of moderate quantities of quali
ty-focused beer), exposing Americans to
a slew of styles then unavailable in mass
produced products. California and Port
land have become particularly remark
able in the microbrew industry.
A variant of craft brewing is the brew
pub, where beer is made on the premises
and served in conjunction with a restau
rant. Gordon Bicrsch Brewery Restau
rant, originating in Palo Alto, is an exam
ple of a brewpub.
"California is such a fertile ground for
homebrewing and craftbrewing," Aren
son said. "There's such a variation of
styles...beer blows wine out of the water
with regard to diversity of styles." With all
of this high-quality beer around, Sean has

not missed the opportunity to evangelize.
He often purchases a collection of beers
and holds tasting events for fellow stu
dents.
College kids who have swilled down
Natural Light for years are usually in for
a pleasant surprise. Arenson says that
after presenting a range of styles, even his
beer-averse subjects normally find one or
two beers they enjoy.
While the exact ingredients used in
commercial beers are trade secrets,
"clone brew" recipes allow brewers to
emulate popular products. But home
brewing also provides the freedom to tin
ker with classic styles and recipes, adjust
ing the grain, hops and yeast to the brew
er's taste and creating entirely new fla
vors with the addition of fruit or spices.
MO' MONEY
An ingredient kit for a five-gallon
batch — about 40 twelve-ounce bottles
— typically costs between $30 and $50,
making homebrew costs competitive
with store prices for microbrewed six
packs.
The prices, however, are on the rise.
The brewing industry has been rocked by
a massive world hop shortage stemming

from a destructive European winter, a de
cline in farmland used for hops, and a sell
ing out of hop reserves. Some varieties
are simply not available, and others have
seen fivefold price increases.
Microbreweries and homebrewers,
masters of highly hopped styles and lack
ing guaranteed contracts with hop dis
tributors, have been hit the hardest. The
cost has been passed on to consumers,
who have already seen price increases
and will likely feel the squeeze for at least
another year.
MORE TH AN A HOBBY
Even as a biology major. Arenson sees
his hobby as a fuzzy enterprise. "I view
brewing as more of an art than a science,
which is interesting because." despite
being a jazz musician, "I have no artistic
talent."
1 le did compare it to his alternate life:
"There are parallels between jazz and
brewing — there's a lot of improvisation,
in each batch you do something different,
and the mood you are in is reflected in the
brew."
The hobby can also have health bene
fits. Homebrewed beer is made with a
handful of ingredients without the
preservatives of mass-produced beer.
Age. handling and freshness can be con
trolled by the brewers themselves, some
thing not possible with mass-produced
beers shipped across the country. Be
cause of the presence of yeast normally
filtered out by commercial breweries,
which provide B vitamins, homebrewed
beer is one of the most beneficial alco
holic beverages one can drink — particu
larly when it comes to keeping away a
hangover.
Between brewing and tastings. Aren
son and Mansfield are driven by the ap
preciation of fine beer that motivates
many homebrewers. Arenson encour
ages the curious to give it a try.
"People assume it requires smoke
stacks and everything. It's just like any
food product: you can do it in your own
kitchen...they should really dive in in
stead of being intimidated."
