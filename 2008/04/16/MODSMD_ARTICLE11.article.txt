## Scam hits alumni emails Source of plashing attack remains unknown 
### ANNA DEARYBURY 
Last Friday the University
Alumni Association alerted alumni
via email of a possible phishing
scam.
Fraudulent emails were report
edly sent to alumni email addresses,
attempting to obtain login pass
words. Alumni Center customer
service was alerted to the scam by
phone calls from troubled alumni,
according to Alumni Center repre
sentative Edie Barry.
Alumni, like students, are given
email addresses that affiliate them
with the University. The scammers
use a method known as "phishing"
to masquerade as reliable individu
als for the purpose of acquiring per
sonal information.
This phishing scam, however, was
of unprecedented magnitude for
alumni email addresses, according to
Barry.
"This is a huge scam that is not
unique to Stanford." she said. "But
this is the first time in the Alumni
Center's history that we have had to
alert all alumni of a widespread
scam."
Technical support at the Alumni
Center is still unsure of the source of
the scamming emails, and does not
know exactly when the scam began.
"Our alumni are very thankful
for the heads up." Barry said, "and
we are doing everything in our
power to make them aware of the
scam."
