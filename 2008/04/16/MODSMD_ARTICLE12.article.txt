## Editorial Board The 						role of Title IX in Row housing decisions 
### 
With the recent unveiling of a gender
neutral housing pilot program, the
role of gender in housing decisions
is on the minds of many students. Gender, ei
ther directly or indirectly, has a major effect
on where all students live on campus.
It is easier to get into some campus
dorms and houses as a male than a female.
Last year, for example, Kairos and Chi
Theta Chi were harder to draw into for fe
males. But males had a harder time getting
into other residences, like Phi Sig and the
Grove houses.
Gender can also affect the intricacies of
room distribution within dorms. Consider,
for example. Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. Stanford and other
universities interpret this U.S. law, famous for
its effect on student-athlete scholarships, as
requiring equal quality of housing options
for males and females. On the surface, this
rule appears fair. In most cases, the assurance
of equality of singles between the sexes on
the Row is appropriate in an abstract sense.
But some flaws exist with regard to specific,
real-life applications of the principle.
In certain cases, the policy hinders the
ability of a well-meaning staff to improve its
residents' quality of life. Sometimes it is quite
beneficial and appropriate to award a single
to one sex that is, by law, assigned to another.
For example, if a male living in a Row house
wanted to move into a vacant single in the
house, the student could only move into the
room if it was designated for males. If two
male roommates were not getting along, and
the staff strongly believed that splitting them
up would help the entire community, one of
them would be unable to utilize the vacant
single. A female student in the house, howev
er, would be able to move in, even if her move
would not benefit the social community of
the house.
This example shows that, while the princi

pie of equal quality of housing options be
tween the sexes is attractive, in practice it
sometimes fails in its underlying goal of pro
viding a social environment for the greatest
benefit of all citizens. The world is not per
fect, of course, and one may conclude that the
discontent of a few individuals, such as in the
situation described above, is worth the over
all attainment of equality of opportunity for
men and women. This point is very persua
sive, and there is no need to reform Title IX
itself. The current problem, however, could
be improved with a simple reform of ac
counting by Housing.
The female who attained the single in the
case presented above also left a de facto sin
gle behind, since nobody moved into her old
room in a two-room double.This new room,
while being interpreted by everyone in the
house community as adding to the single
count of a particular gender, did not change
the tally in the eyes of Housing's Title IX
calculation. Interestingly, two-room dou
bles are not counted as singles, although in
many ways our community interprets them
as fairly close substitutes. It would seem that
in order to truly provide equality between
the sexes, the individual rooms in two-room
doubles would also need to be added to the
calculation.This simple change in operation
would improve the quality of life for many
on the Row, bringing the letter of the law in
accordance with the spirit and potentially
giving staff more leeway to make housing
changes. Empowering resident staff mem
bers to make such decisions within careful
ly-defined limits — especially after the
deadline for new resident admission —
would maintain the equality of opportunity
mandated by Title IX, while also allowing
flexibility in dealing with harmful residen
tial-life issues that can be easily helped by
moving around students within houses or
dorms.
