# You're Not Special
## Lawsuits are killing the vibe 
### 
It's something of a sport for seniors to sit
around in our rooms and bemoan how
much "cooler" campus used to he back
before the Office of Student Activities
(OS A) watered down our crazy parties with
their rules and regulations. But we students
really only have ourselves to blame — we
need our parents to stop suing everyone in
sight when we get into trouble.
Sure, it would be spectacular if freshman
dorms could throw parties with alcohol. Or if
Greek houses were not constantly harassed
and put on probation. Or if the Band could
do all the stupid stuff that seems to amuse it
and. no one else. I doubt that the school in
terferes in our time-honored drinking rituals
because they hate fun. I'm sure they know
that it's dangerous to get between an 18 year
old and his beer.
But if that 18 year old falls down drunk in
the street and gets run over by a garbage
truck, his parents are not going to be amused
that he got drunk at an official Stanford
party. They're going to say, "This tragedy
could have been prevented by some com
mon sense." The jury will agree, and the
punitive damages will run into the many mil
lions.
Of course, if that same freshman gets
drunk in his room using a bottle of vodka
that a hobo bought him, without any sort of
University approval, then the only person
the parents can sue is the hobo.
Stanford undergrads live, eat, study and
frequently work at this university, which
puts it in an odd situation. Although we may
technically be adults, universities are held to
an absurdly high degree of responsibility for
our safety. The universities respond in ways
that don't necessarily make students' lives
safer, but institute policies aimed at prevent
ing litigation.
We now have to be shown how to loft our
beds before we can check out lofting materi
als. Why is this? I'm guessing because some
idiot fell off his bed. which did not have a
railing. The new lofting policy doesn't actu
ally stop people from not putting railings on
their beds. It just gives the University a way
to say that it is your own fault if you fall.
It makes sense for the OSA to be nervous
about lawsuits. In 2(X)4, the parents of a Uni
versity of Wisconsin student who died after

drinking sued the university, arguing that its
Safe Ride shuttle, which transported stu
dents between campus and local bars, en
couraged drinking. They claimed that if he
had needed to drive himself home, he would
not have gotten drunk.
Many of the OSA's party restrictions are
intended to forestall exactly that sort of
complaint. Eighteen year olds can still drink
at campus parties, but if they get hospital
ized, it's the organizer's fault for allowing
under-aged students to drink. Changing the
name of a party from "Bar Night" to "Fun
Night With Boardgames" or offering non-al
coholic beverages won't stop people from
getting drunk, but it will give their lawyers
less reason to claim that Stanford promotes
a culture of drinking.
Of course, all the red tape makes it hard
er to have fun. Parties get shut down because
there are too many people there. Frats go on
probation because some pledge went to the
hospital. And those rent-a-cops are hideous
ly expensive. But that doesn't translate to a
"war on fun." Stanford is merely protecting
itself.
Luckily, the solution to the whole prob
lem is absurdly simple. Just attack the under
lying reasons behind the red tape: make stu
dents sign waivers. Make them sign waivers
before they can do anything. Waivers before
parties, ski trips or concerts. Or perhaps just
one all-encompassing waiver when you first
come to Stanford. If you refuse to sign the
waiver, go somewhere else — there are
20,(XX) kids waiting to take your place. And
with a waiver of liability in place, the threat
of a lawsuit is diminished, and there's less
reason to regulate student fun.
