# Co-Terminal Illness
## Informational asymmetry 
### 
I have a theory. If you want to understand
why some parts of the developing world
are taking so long to develop, forget
racism, unfair trade regulations, corruption,
pollution or disease. Those are pieces of the
puzzle, hut the root of the problem is infor
mation asymmetry. Very simply, the Third
World does not realize how badly it is being
screwed.
1 spent the summer working at an English
language newspaper in Uganda, an experi
ence that gave root to this hypothesis.Two ex
amples in particular jump to mind. Late in
the summer, I traveled to Lake Albert, on the
Congolese border, to cover the murder — by
bandits — of a British geophysicist who had
been part of a team surveying the vast, under
water petroleum deposits there. In the course
of my reporting. 1 asked the subsistence fish
ermen that live along the shore whether they
were concerned about the discovery of black
gold under their land. Knowing the misery oil
has wrought throughout Africa, from Nigeria
to Sudan to Equatorial Guinea, I was sur
prised by their answer.
"We are expecting wealth," a local coun
cilman told me. "Our expectation is that
everything will improve once drilling be
gins."
1 didn't have the heart to tell him what a
long shot it was that he would see any wind
fall. With more access to information, the dis
covery of oil should have raised alarm bells
among the fishermen. Instead, they sat and
watched as prostitutes flooded the town, the
exploration team's detonations scared off
fish and Congolese bandits, drawn by
wealthy prospectors, wreaked more violence
on the border.
A more immediate example of informa
tion asymmetry is the daily screw job Ugan
dan roasters pull on small coffee farmers.The
price of coffee beans fluctuates daily, and
rural growers, most without cellular phones
or even access to a newspaper, rarely know
the going rate. As a result, businessmen use
this to their advantage, routinely paying
cash-starved farmers far less than they de
serve.
If you want to make a difference in the
lives of millions of Ugandans, stop teaching
locals to string beads for your college friends
to buy. That's not sustainable, and it's not
adding value to the local economy.
Instead, buy 1(X) cheap cell phones, dis
tribute them around the countryside to local
officials, and text the current prices for coffee
every morning. For $5,000. you will have dou
bled the income of every impoverished cof
fee grower in Uganda.

The developing world also suffers from a
different brand of information asymmetry:
the richer nations' oftentimes willful igno
rance of the have-nots.
According to a 2006 Gallup poll, only 28
percent of Americans identify malaria as a
"very serious" health issue around the world,
despite the fact that the mosquito-borne dis
ease kills a million people annually. A shock
ing 20 percent of Americans believe that the
threat posed by malaria is "not serious" at all
— presumably the same 20 percent that be
lieves the moon landing was staged.
Another statistic, advanced by Bill Gates
in his campus speech two months ago, is that

50 times more money is spent on research for
a baldness cure than a malaria vaccine.
I find myself in a unique position among
Americans. While in Uganda, I contracted fal
ciparum malaria, Latin for "the kind of malar
ia that kills you." I know what it's like to lie in
bed, freezing cold despite the fact that you are
wearing every article of clothing you own,
every bone feeling like it's just been hit with a
baseball bat, feverish nightmares punctuated
only by trips to the bathroom to heave out
whatever remains in your stomach. And since
the parasite is tough to kill, there's a slim
chance that I may enjoy a recurrence.
A malaria vaccine would be a whole lot
more useful to me than a baldness vaccine —
I have, as it turns out, some of the nicest, soft
est hair on campus, and it ain't going any
where. The majority of American men will
eventually lose their hair, but until Florida
retirees start contracting malaria, Adam
Smith's invisible hand will continue cranking
out Rogaine and Propecia.
