## Senate welcomes new members 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
During last night's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting, sena
tors primarily focused on the recent
election results and the transition to the
newly elected Senate. Although the
final election results will be approved at
next week's meeting, senators discussed
the pros and cons of the election
process.
T\vo significant changes were made
in the way elections were run this year
â€” the addition of the Sticker
Campaign and the no-bathroom-flyer
ing policy. The Sticker Campaign
required that all flyers placed in public
areas have an official ASSU Campaign
sticker, limiting the total number of fly
ers each candidate or slate could post.
Election Commissioner Ryan
Woessner '10 was pleased with the
change.
"I thought the Sticker Campaign
worked really well," he said. "It kept
campus clean. The no flyering in the
bathrooms was good because we had a
pretty high turnout at the events we
held like Rock the Vote."

Elections this year took on a new
angle as candidates focused more on
initiating direct contact with students.
"There was a shift in the way candi
dates went about their campaigning,"
Woessner added. "Instead of worrying
about a catchy slogan, they focused on
their platform."
Senators agreed that the entire elec
tion process ran more smoothly than it
did last year. Although the number of
graduate voters increased significantly
by 19 percent, the number of under
graduate voters decreased by almost 8
percent. Woessner admitted that this
decrease could partially be attributed
to the stricter campaigning policies.
"Obviously, if you don't have flyers
in the bathrooms, I don't think people
will be inundated with flyers all the
time," Woessner said. "But it saved a lot
of hassle for the Elections Commission,
and I think candidates benefited from it
because they were able to participate a
lot more in events."
One election glitch that the Senate is
currently working to fix is ensuring that
special fees group Basmati Raas
receives its requested $11,000. The
budget that was placed on the voting

Web site incorrectly stated the total
requested amount as $1,000, making
the votes unconstitutional and invali
dating them.
Senators discussed the possibility of
funding Basmati Raas' $11,000 with
ASSU general fees. However, some
senators worry that this may set an
unwanted precedent.
"I just don't want to set a prece
dent," said Senator Luukas lives '09.
"Whenever there is a technical problem
with special fees, the automatic solution
shouldn't be to use the general fees
budget."
The Senate also discussed the transi
tion period between the old and new
senators. ASSU Senate Chair Priyanka
Sharma '09 advised the new members
to take full advantage of this period of
time to make the beginning of their
term run as smoothly as possible.
"We, the current Senate, are going to
do everything we can to make the tran
sition smooth, easy and fun for you
guys," Sharma told the incoming sena
tors.
