Freshman pitcher Ashley Chinn
threw a five inning no-hitter to lead
the No. 8 Stanford Cardinal to a 12-
0 victory' over visiting Santa Clara
Tuesday evening.
Both junior shortstop Maddy
Coon and freshman catcher Brit
tany Minder, who was replacing
sophomore Rosey Neill, hit three
run homeruns to lead the potent
Stanford offense. Minder's homerun
was the first of her collegiate career.
Chinn lost her bid for a perfect
game with just one out remaining in
the game when Bronco designated
player Maggie Godfrey was called
safe on a close play at first base after
Stanford sophomore second base
man Shannon Koplitz hobbled her
ground ball and received an error.
Chinn looked in control through
out the game, keeping Santa Clara
off balance with a variety of pitches.
There were just a hand full of hard
hit balls, and she only went to two
three-ball counts during the entire
contest. The freshman struck out six
and threw only 58 pitches.

GAME NOTES: Stanford collected its 38th win
of the season yesterday, and its 13th by way
of the mercy rule. The Cardinal return to
Pac-10 play this weekend when it hosts Cal
Friday and Saturday before finishing the se
ries at Berkeley on Sunday. Six of the next
seven games will be played at home, before
the Card finishes out the regular season with
six straight road games.

more today, and Rosey (Neill) did a
great job of calling pitches,"' Chinn
said.
Head coach John Rittman was
thrilled with the progress his young
right-hander has made during her
first collegiate season.
"Ashley is very capable,"
Rittman said. "She has done well in
all her outings. She had some nerves
early on in the season like most
freshman do, but she has made the
transition from high school to col
lege extremely well. We knew from
practice in the fall that we had some

one special."
The Cardinal gave its pitcher a
ton of support early on by scoring
seven runs on seven hits in the bot
tom of the first inning. Sophomore
center fielder Alissa Haber and sen
ior left fielder Tricia Aggabao each
had two hits in an inning which saw
13 Stanford batters come to the
plate.
After both Haber and Aggabao
hit bunt singles to start the game.
Coon drove a Jackie Morales 0-1 of
fering over the left centerfield fence
for her fifth homerun of the season.
The Cardinal would tack on four
more runs in the inning, including a
two-RBI double off the bat of Ko
plitz to the gap in right center.
"[Morales] has had some success
against us in the past "said Rittman.
"She was a little bit tired today,she's
been pitching a lot. but it was big for
us to get on a team like Santa Clara
in the first inning. Maddy's homer
was huge for our momentum."
Stanford dominated every facet
of the game, allowing just one base
runner, while pounding out ten hits
and drawing nine bases on balls.
Since the Cardinal jumped out to
the early lead, Rittman was able to
substitute out some of his starters
and give them some rest, and allow
for some of his reserves — like Min
der — to get some playing time.

bid for a perfect game moments before the final out was recorded, but did
achieve a no-hitter. Chinn is 11 -1 on the season.
sively for Neill in the top of the
fourth. Minder took full advantage of
her first at-bat in the bottom of the
inning by driving a two out 3-1 fast
ball over the left field fence for a
homerun, capping the scoring for
Stanford.
The win was Stanford's third —
all by run-rule — over local rival
Santa Clara this season.
The Cardinal didn't look to be
suffering from any sort of hangover
after sweeping a Pac-10 series this
past weekend in yesterday's domi
nant victory. Not overlooking op
ponents is something which
Rittman continually stresses to his
players.
"Coach [Rittman] always tells us
we have got to get up for midweek
games, especially after a day off," said
Coon. "He tells us we can't play the
name-game with teams, but instead
we just have to go out and play."
Having won five in a row, Stan
ford looks to have broken out of the
funk that plagued it early on in Pac
-10 play.
The Cardinal will look to carry its
momentum into a huge weekend se

ries with No. 21 Cal.The first game of
the series is set for 7 p.m. on Friday
night at Smith Family Stadium.
