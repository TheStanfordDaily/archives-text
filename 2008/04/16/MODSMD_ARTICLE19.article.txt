Nuggets All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony said
Tuesday he was "truly sorry" for his arrest on DUI
charges, and police denied giving him special treat
ment. even though one officer gave him a lift after
his arrest and another drove his car to a city lot.
"I'm here to man up to my mistake, just to let you
know that I'm truly sorry for what happened and
everything that's going on," Anthony said. "What
happened Monday morning was truly and totally
unacceptable."
He spoke for about two minutes and left without
taking questions. He didn't refer to his notes, ap
pearing instead to speak off the cuff. The team later
released a written statement attributed to him.
Teammate Allen Iverson stood off to the side as
Anthony spoke.
Anthony acknowledged the arrest came at a bad
time, hours before the Nuggets clinched their fifth
consecutive postseason appearance when the Gold

en State Warriors lost on Monday night.
"It's kind of bad timing right now. due to the play
offs,due to our team's success," he said."Once again.
I just want to apologize."
Anthony was alone in his silver Mercedes when
an officer pulled him over on Interstate 25 early
Monday for weaving and failing to dim his lights, po
lice said.
Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony was arrest
ed after he failed a series of sobriety tests and was
taken to police headquarters and booked.
Hahn said a police sergeant then drove Antho
ny to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Denver. Hahn said
it's her understanding that Anthony's fiancee
LaLa Vazquez couldn't pick him up because of
child-care issues. The couple have a young son to
gether.
"I want to make sure the public understands that
I fully support my fiance, Carmelo Anthony, and
stand by him through this ordeal," Vazquez said in a
statement. "1 will always have his
back and never refused to pick him
up from the police station. In fact,
they offered to bring him to me."
Anthony said he appreciated her
support.
"LaLa continues to be a rock in my
life, she's always been there for me
through thick and thin," Anthony
said in a release.
Another officer drove Antho
ny's car to a city lot until it could be
picked up, Hahn said.
Officers said Anthony didn't get
preferential treatment.
Police spokesman Sonny Jack
son said it's "not a standard practice
(for an officer to give a DUI suspect
a ride), but it is done on occasion
and it is not a violation of depart
ment policy."
Hahn said officers also have the

discretion to have suspects' cars
towed to an impound lot. let a friend
or relative move it or move it them
selves.
"We've done it before. When I've
worked on the street. I've driven
cars to different locations when
someone's been arrested. It's on the
highway, you don't want to leave a
car on the highway," she said.
Anthony's attorney, Dan Recht,
said his client consented to a blood
test, but results won't be available
for about two weeks. His first court
appearance is scheduled for May 14.
Nuggets coach George Karl said
he thinks Anthony's apology is sin
cere.
"When I spoke with him this
morning, he seems to be very gen
uinely upset at himself for making
the mistake. Where we go from here
now is continue to be contrite and
apologize and get back to playing
basketball and the playoff race
we're in," he said.
"I was raised on two words —
respect and responsibility," Karl

said. "You did hear those words
today."
But Karl said he was perplexed
by Anthony's latest actions.
"I thought we were past this
point," Karl said. "We were looking
at more of a celebration of having a
great year, finishing up this year as a
special season, then him winning a
gold medal in 2008 (at the Summer
Olympics). I think we can get him
back on that track very quickly."
Anthony has had numerous mis
steps since he was drafted by the
Nuggets third overall in 2003. He
was caught with marijuana in his
backpack during the preseason in
2004. but the charge was dropped
after a friend said the pot was his.
He appeared - but did not speak - in
a street video called "Stop Snitch
ing" that warned people to not go to
police with information about
crimes.
Last season. Anthony drew a 15-
game suspension for throwing a
punch in a brawl during a game at
Madison Square Garden.
