# Card preps for Olympics
## Athletes set China controversy aside, focus on training 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the 2008 Beijing Olympics are attract
ing both anticipation and controversy. Stanford
student-athletes, alumni athletes and coaches
are focusing on the final leg of preparations to
qualify for and compete in the games.
The Games have received increased media
and political attention regarding China's poli
cies on Tibet and human rights — as well as
connections to Sudan and the Darfur genocide
— leading many political figures and protestors
to call for a boycott of the opening ceremonies.
A number of Stanford students traveled to San
Francisco last week to protest the arrival of the
Olympic Torch.
President George W. Bush has indicated that
he will attend the opening ceremonies and has
no plans to boycott, and that American partici
pation in the Games is still very likely.
Stanford is sending a diverse mix of former
and current student-athletes and coaches to the

Games, with the ranks growing as the U.S.
Olympic teams announce their official selec
tions. Stanford Athletics highlighted the honor
and benefits of Cardinal participation in the
games.
"1 see it as very exciting to follow these elite
college athletes who hope to qualify for the
Olympics later in the season" said Athletics
Media Relations Coordinator Ricky Brackett.
"It definitely makes my job easier because it is
much easier to draw attention to our outstand
ing programs with such outstanding athletes."
Many student-athletes are immersing them
selves in the tough process of qualifying for
competition.
"It's pretty much every athlete's dream to
compete in the Olympics," said gymnast David
Sender '08. "It can definitely add some extra
stress, especially in trying to work around
school and NCAA practice, but it's completely
worth it. Not too many people can say they
went to Olympic Trials and even fewer can say
they went to the Olympics, so I'm just grateful

to have the chance to
do either."

Student-athletes
working to qualify for
spots in the Games also
emphasized that they hope

to bring their training and
experience hack to the Farm.
"Whether I make the team

or not. I've learned a lot." said
rower Elle Logan '10. 'ill bring
that back to Stanford in the fall."

Some with Stanford connections have
already clinched their spots in the Games,
including Lauren Lappin '06 and Jessica
Mendoza '02 — members of the Olympic
women's softball team — and softball head
coach John Rittman. I"hey pointed to shared
Stanford connections as an enjoyable part of
the Olympic atmosphere.
"While I will be wearing USA colors.
Cardinal red runs through my veins," Lappin
said."l won't be able to wear anything to repre-

t
sent

the Card,
but 1 will defi-

r nitely have Stanford
in my heart while I'm in
Beijing."

"1 think whether you're at
the Pan-American Games or the
Olympics, that whole village atmos
phere makes for a unique experience,"

Rittman added. "And there's certainly a
whole Stanford community as part of
that."

Other former Cardinal student-athletes
are still competing for spots in the upcoming
games.

"Full-time training, like I am
doing now, is a lot different than
what I did in college," said Matt
Gentry '05, currently a wrestler
with the Canadian Olympic
team. "It takes a lot of planning
and organization to make the
most of the 115 days that are left
until the Olympics begin."
"The intensity is still the
same," he added, "but I have to
be even more focused because I
have so little time to make a lot
of improvements."
Regarding the politics brew

ing underneath this year's
Games, those involved empha
sized that they were keeping their
focus on athletics.
"It's really not my concern as
an athlete " Logan said. "It's hard
to separate the two — politics
and athletics — but whatever
happens happens, and personally
I'm not even thinking about a
boycott. I'm focused on my train
ing."
"The way I see it is that my job
is to do gymnastics and to com
pete," Sender added. "1 try not to

worry or focus on anything else."
With the roster of Cardinal
participants continuing to grow
until the end of the qualifying
processes, the anticipation is high.
"It's exciting for all of the ath
letes and coaches involved in the
process." Rittman said. "All the
training and preparation has
been going on for four years now.
and the light at the end of the
tunnel is the Beijing Games."
