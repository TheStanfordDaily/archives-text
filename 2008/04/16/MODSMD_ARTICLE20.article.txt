rescheduled match yesterday — its

— heading into a showdown be
tween the top two teams in the Pac
-10.
The win marked the Cardinal's
third consecutive shutout, its first
such three-game streak since April
2004.
It was also the team's sixth victo
ry in a row and its 12th in 13 match
es — giving the women plenty of
momentum heading into this week
end's bout with the Bears.
"1 think we've certainly, for a
month and a half now, been playing
very well," head coach Lele Forood

fortable with their game and where
we're at going into our final match of
the year."
In the match, Forood was able to
welcome a familiar face in Aggies
head coach Bill Maze. Both graduat
ed from Stanford in 1978.
Because of rain earlier in the sea
son, the match seemed destined to
be indefinitely postponed. Due to a
light week, the two were able to
squeeze in the match before facing
Cal.
"When we decided to reschedule
it until now maybe a month ago, we
decided that it was something mutu
ally beneficial for both of us,"
Forood said. "He wanted to get the
match in and I thought that we could
use the little extra play around this
time. So we decided that this would
be a good thing to put on the sched
ule this week."
The Cardinal featured its top
teams in doubles, easily sweeping to
earn the point.
Despite resting junior Jessica
Nguyen and senior Celia Durkin in
singles for Saturday, Stanford would
cruise through the rest of the con

test.
"They had a few people missing
on their squad today and we had two
people sit today as a precautionary
thing for Saturday," Forood said.
"But it was nice to get the work in
for everybody else and we played
our top teams in doubles. I'm happy
that they were able to come over this
week and get the match off."
After the win. Forood gave cred
it to Maze's squad on what they've
accomplished.
"They're still building a Division
1 program," Forood said. "They've
only been Division 1 for a year and a
half, so it's going to take a while until
they're up to speed at this level."
But even against a weaker oppo
nent, a win is a win. and the Cardinal
women have been stacking them up
recently.
The momentum will certainly
factor into Saturday's matchup
against California, where much is at
stake.
Both squads are tied atop the
Pac-10 standings, and the winner will
come away with at least a share of
the Pac-10 conference title.
Earlier this season, Cal shocking
ly upset Stanford 6-1 away from the
Farm.
But this match will be at home,
where the Cardinal women are 131-
0 in the last eight years. Moreover,

"They've been
fiercely competi
tive
playing over the
years."

Head coach

the squad has matured both physi
cally and mentally since that loss.
With freshman Hilary Barte de
stroying the competition at the
team's No. 1 spot, Stanford now car
ries a swagger it once lacked at the
beginning of the season.
"The familiarity of playing here is
always important," Forood said.
"And I think we're a totally different

team from where we were at that
point in February. So I'm looking
forward to having this match on Sat
urday here."
The match will he the last regu
lar-season game for three seniors:
Celia Durkin, Whitney Deason and
Lejla Hodzic.
On a squad full of young players,
the three have been essential to the
development and maturation of the
Cardinal lineup.
"They've had to battle a lot of
things, the three of them, but they've
been outstanding competitors and
great leaders as seniors this year —
they really have," Forood said.
"They've been outstanding with
their mentoring of the freshmen es
pecially. They've been huge per
formers; they've been ready to play
and they've been fiercely competi
tive playing over the years."
With the conference title, an
eight-year win streak and bragging
rights on the line. Saturday will cer
tainly be one of the biggest matches
in recent years.
For the true home court advan
tage, Forood knows what will cer
tainly help Stanford to victory.
"Just that we need a lot of fan
support — it'll be very important."
