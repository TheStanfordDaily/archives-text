# The 						best are better
## 
### 
The NBA playoffs are upon us,
and that means it's time for a
few months of drawn out, in
consequential struggles between a
lot of teams that don't really have a
chance. And some that do, of course.
But outside of Boston, Detroit
and Cleveland there isn't an Eastern
Conference Team that scares anyone
going into the postseason, and realis
tically, the West is going to be all
about the top four seeded teams.
And I just can't help but think it
could be so much better. Especially
in light of the Warriors' inability to
crash the playoff party, despite the
fact that they'll finish their season
with at least 48 wins after going 1 -6 to
start the year during Steven Jack
son's suspension.
Honestly, who would you rather
see in the postseason? The Warriors
or the East's eighth seed, Atlanta
with 37 wins? The answer is probably
clear to anyone not from the Atlanta
area. Allowing more of the good
teams into the postseason simply
makes for a better product for the
viewer.
So, while I'm certainly not the first
to do so, I'd like to propose a simple
solution to opening round snooze
fests like Atlanta-Boston and
Philadelphia-Detroit, and it's pretty
simple. Keep the schedule and con
ferences the same, and guarantee the
six division winning teams spots in
the postseason. But for the ten re
maining wild-card slots, disregard
conference affiliation entirely.
Consider the ramifications such a
change would have on this year's
postseason. If the playoffs started
today, Atlanta and Philadelphia
would be replaced by Golden State
and Portland, respectively.
Taking the notion of an NBA
meritocracy a step further, playoff
seeding could also be entirely based
on regular-season finishes, setting up
a model that would eventually look
something like the NCAA Tourna
ment with best-of-seven series to de
termine bracket winners rather than
a one-and-done scheme.
If nothing else, such a scheme
would help prevent the kind of anti
climactic Finals series seen in recent
years when everyone knew the West
ern Conference Finals were where
the Championship was really decid
ed.
'But wait,' some of you are cer
tainly thinking,'wouldn't that be too
much travel? How can we expect the
world's greatest athletes to have
enough time to party after the game
if they need to make cross-country
flights to face their opponents? And
wouldn't that system favor the weak
er conference, since it's teams face
weaker opponents?'
Well, to the former point, baseball
players have been making such trips
for years, and they do it after twice as
many regular-season games. And as
for the latter, maybe there is some fa
voritism there, but consider this year
— in which two additional Western
Conference teams would be added
to the mix — as a solid counter ex
ample.
Of course, such a system would
have numerous obvious benefits.
Aside from all but ensuring that the
best teams meet in the Finals, it
would add plenty of drama to the
end of the regular season as teams
jostle for position against the whole
of the rest of the league, rather than
just their own conference.
And perhaps, sometimes, the re
sults speak for themselves. Who
wouldn t like to see an opening series
matchup between Leßron James'
Cavaliers and Chris Paul's Hornets?
Or Gilbert Arenas and the Wizards
against Kobe and the Lakers? Shaq
and the Suns against Dwight
Howard and the Magic? A cross
state showdown between Houston
and Dallas ? The half-court oriented
Spurs against the up-tempo War
riors?
It seems that, in the case of this
year at least, the more intuitive sys
tem of simply letting the best teams
play for the championship would,
shockingly, lead to better opening
round matchups.
But, instead of being on the edge
of my seat waiting for Agent Zero vs.
Kobe or Allen Iverson against Deron


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
Williams, I'm more excited by April
baseball than the start of the NBA
postseason.True, the baseball games
are pretty much meaningless at this
point with over five months remain
ing in the season, but at least it's
fresh and different as we figure out
exactly where teams stand in '08.
That right there should tell David
Stern that it's time to make a
change.
But it probably won't. Because,
in the world of the NBA, nothing
changes until it's so obviously bro
ken that all the fans have already
left. Check back in another ten
vears.

does not appreciate the League. Tell
