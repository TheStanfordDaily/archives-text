The College Board's recent decision to cut four Advanced
Placement (AP) exams for the 2009-2010 academic year has
resulted in mixed reactions from academic departments at
Stanford.
The number of AP programs has doubled over the last 10
years, but the College Board will end tests in Computer Science
AB. French Literature, Latin Literature and Italian Language
and Culture after the 2008-2009 academic year.
Citing short funding and lack of participation in the exams,
the College Board said that it has done its best to maintain these
programs in spite of related profit losses. Following its decision,
the College Board will now reallocate resources to improve
other AP language programs, as well as the remaining Computer
Science A exam.
"While we are disappointed to be announcing [the end of
these exams], we are eager to focus our resources on efforts that
will provide a much greater degree of support for all AP teach
ers than ever before," according to the College Board Web site.
Since the 2004-2005 academic year, Stanford has offered cred
it for only one of the cut exams â€” Computer Science AB.
German Prof. Elizabeth Bernhardt, director of the Stanford
Language Center, said that effects, if any, would be minimal in
the language programs on campus.
