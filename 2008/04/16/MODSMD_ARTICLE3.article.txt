## College Board to axe four AP tests Language, computer science departments give mixed reaction to loss of exams 
### RYAN MAC 
The College Board's recent decision to cut four Advanced
Placement (AP) exams for the 2009-2010 academic year has
resulted in mixed reactions from academic departments at
Stanford.
The number of AP programs has doubled over the last 10
years, but the College Board will end tests in Computer Science
AB. French Literature, Latin Literature and Italian Language
and Culture after the 2008-2009 academic year.
Citing short funding and lack of participation in the exams,
the College Board said that it has done its best to maintain these
programs in spite of related profit losses. Following its decision,
the College Board will now reallocate resources to improve
other AP language programs, as well as the remaining Computer
Science A exam.
"While we are disappointed to be announcing [the end of
these exams], we are eager to focus our resources on efforts that
will provide a much greater degree of support for all AP teach
ers than ever before," according to the College Board Web site.
Since the 2004-2005 academic year, Stanford has offered cred
it for only one of the cut exams — Computer Science AB.
German Prof. Elizabeth Bernhardt, director of the Stanford
Language Center, said that effects, if any, would be minimal in
the language programs on campus.
"We actually have not been using |these tests] for
several years now," she said in an email to The Daily.
"They never reflected proficiency."
Reaction from the Computer Science
Department (CS) reflected a more direct concern
for incoming freshmen who will no longer gain
exposure to material covered in the slashed AP
exam.
"The immediate issue this raises is whether stu
dents in high school will still be getting appropri
ate opportunities for exposure to Computer
Science to help them determine if they are inter
ested in further pursuing the field," said Associate
Computer Science Prof. Mehran Sahami in an
email to The Daily. "Cutting venues that increase
exposure to computing will have some detrimen
tal impact on whether students choose to go into
the field."

RJ Walsh '11. a section leader for Computer
Science 1068, echoed Sahami's concern and saw the
College Board's decision as a negative message.
"Dropping AP Computer Science AB sends a
message that the College Board just doesn't see CS
as important as it once was." he said. "1 don't see
Stanford as being less interested in CS. but with
these cuts, the College Board just makes it seem
that way."
"With less options, students may not feel com
fortable taking the only AP course offered in
Computer Science and may bypass the field alto
gether," Walsh added.
The AP program currently offers 37 exams
across 22 subject areas. For the 2(X)7-2008 academic
year, Stanford accepted BAP exams.
