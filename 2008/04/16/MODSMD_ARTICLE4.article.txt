## University mediates tree controversy Open discussion continues between EV residents and University administrators 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Residents of Escondido Village (EV) recently clashed with
the University over the clearing of trees on campus.
Rachel Lee J.D. '09 learned of the move after noticing
marked trees being cut down near her EV residence.
"ITiey started cutting down trees along Olmsted |Road|,"
Lee said, "and that alarmed a lot of the residents because there
were a lot of trees marked with white markings."
Reed Anderson, a first-year graduate student in studio art.
was concerned that the loss of trees would negatively affect his
two-year-old son's play space.
"A lot of people look at EV and think, oh, student housing,"
Anderson said. "For those of us who have families, that's our
home. These trees are providing shade for our kids."
In response to the demolition markings on courtyard and
playground trees, confused residents contacted University
housing staff, but could not find any
one who knew the details of the
project.
"Nobody in the University
seemed to know why this was hap
pening, only that a developer had
made a donation and had arranged
to have the trees cut down," Lee
said.
Associate Director of Student
Housing Imogen Hinds later sent an
email to residents, explaining the
nature of the project.
"A donor has come forward to
reinvigorate and substantially
improve the aged, nearly 50-year-old
grounds softscape and hardscape
infrastructure (likely to include
grass, trees, shrubs, pathways, fences,
yard equipment and plantings) in
EV," the email stated. "While this is
not a directly Housing-managed
project, we are working closely with
the donor, grounds and this land
scape project team."
in another email to residents in
buildings 64-86, Hinds said that not
all marked trees will be cut.
"The crews are focused on
removing the Monterey pines that
border primarily along Olmsted
Road right now," Hinds said. "They
are a coastal variety and are not far
ing well in our climate. They will be
replaced with an inland variety that
is much better suited for the Village
and will thrive for the next genera
tions."
Anderson emailed both the
provost and the Department of
Project Management (DPM) for
more information about the renova
tion plans. He received emails that
said the plans were not finalized for
the work that had already begun.
"Since this project is being spon
sored and led by a donor, and is on a
fairly fast-paced schedule ... some
of the usual planning processes have
not and will not take place," Hinds
said in an email to The Daily. "The
donor is working directly with a liai
son in the University Department of
Project Management (DPM)."
To appease the EV residents.
Executive Director for Building and
Grounds Maintenance Chris
Christofferson led the project
arborist, Housing staff, Anderson
and other residents around the

courtyards to discuss each tree dur
ing the week of spring break, partic
ularly trees that seemed healthy and
unobtrusive.
"The community came together
on this beautifully," Anderson said.
"I've carried the signs, waved the
flags, but I've never really found
myself in this place where I've
thrown myself into the fire, so to
speak. It's really amazing to have the
community come together."

Anderson, who acted as an emis
sary between the administration and
the residents, said an unknown num
ber of trees slated for demolition
were saved following the efforts of
Christofferson and the EV residents.
He also said he is no longer con
cerned about his son's outdoor play.
"I think that the best landscaping
is landscaping that has an element of
wildness to it," Anderson said. "That
is part of what's missing from the

development of children's lives — to
have something that is practical that
doubles as magical."
To prevent future confusion, a
communication system called
"Circle Point" has been put in place
for EV residents.
"Circle Point is given information
as soon as the next steps of the proj
ect are decided upon, so more time
ly notice can be given." Hinds said.
"The centralized hotlines allow for

residents to know who to call with
any questions, comments or recom
mendations."
EV residents have already began
discussion with administrators via
Circle Point. expressing concern over
the proposed installation of six-foot
fences and the use of pesticides on
residents' front lawns.

Trees in Escondido Village are marked to be cut down in order to make way for a landscaping project. An unnamed donor will fund the undertaking, which
will reportedly improve the nearly 50-year-old grounds softscape and hardscape infrastructure surrounding the east-campus residency complex.
