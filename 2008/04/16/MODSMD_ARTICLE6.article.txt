## Profs, ponder classroom politics Study shows professor politics not likely to sway students 
### PATRICK K. FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Contrary to common conservative com
plaints about left-leaning college professors try
ing to influence student political opinion, a new
study suggests that professors in general have lit
tle impact on their students' political views.
The study, to be published later this year in
the journal "PS: Political Science and Politics,"
surveyed the attitudes of approximately 6,800
students at 38 universities. It found that, while
schools with more liberal faculty are apt to
attract more liberal students, there was little evi
dence that faculty political views impacted those
of students in the classroom.
Fittingly, the study was conducted by a bipar
tisan pair of researchers. Gordon Hewitt of
Hamilton College, a Democrat, and Mack
Mariani of Xavier University, a Republican. The
two found that while students demonstrated a
slight shift to the left over the course of four
years, this mirrored the same trend in the gener
al 18-24-year-old cohort in the U.S. â€” suggesting
that liberal professors had little to no impact on
student political views.
"The indoctrination argument is fundamen
tally an argument about change, the main point
being that liberal professors indoctrinate stu
dents to become more liberal over the course of
their college careers," the authors write.
"Regardless of any biases (intentional or unin
tentional) that professors bring to their teaching,
the findings presented here should help alleviate
the concern that students, on a widespread basis,
are being forced to adopt the political positions
of their liberal professors."
Elite universities in particular have drawn the
ire of conservative commentators for their left
leaning tendencies. At Stanford, where the con
troversy surrounding the appointment of former
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to a distin
guished visiting fellowship at the Hoover
Institution last fall sparked a debate over cam
pus and faculty politics, professors have con
tributed overwhelmingly to Democratic cam
paigns and causes.
In interviews with The Daily, professors
expressed differing viewpoints regarding the
appropriateness of politics in the classroom.
A self-described "irrepressible quipper,"
History and Political Science Prof. Jack Rakove
wears his political biases on his sleeve. Famous
for his digressions during lectures, Rakove said
he receives complaints about his occasional
political commentary "once in a while."
