## Shall we social dance? At Stanford, the answer is almost always yes. 
### GABRIEL JIM ENEZ-MEDINA 
They spin, they whirl, they twirl each
other about. Some are more grace
ful than others.There is more than
one near collision.
Not that it matters. Here, all have two
things in common — they don't judge, and
they're all smiles. Once a week, Fridays at 9
a.m., they put on their shiny shoes, some socks
or even just a pair of sandals. And for two
hours, inhibitions cease to exist. Tech geeks,
athletes, resident writing tutors and a couple
of regular Johns and Janes; they're all repre
sented here at Jammix.
The polkas are popular. The waltzes are a
whiz. Music and the constant murmur of voic
es, giggles and laughter pervade the room.
Others lounge at the corners, resting, chatting
with friends, seemingly without a care in the
world. Some stand alone — but not for long.
Within moments, friends, strangers or that
special someone who might otherwise be too
shy, request the honor of a dance and away
they go.
This is the nature of Jammix. Stanford's so
cial dance experience at its finest. Organized
by Bob "Bandana" Carragher and hosted by
Richard Powers, this program exemplifies the
popularity of social dance here at Stanford.
It's a community where all are welcome —
the techies, the fuzzies and those of us born
with two left feet.
I've always found dancing to be a some
what bewildering form of social interaction.

perhaps because I have no talent for it myself.
I find the constant contact painful and terrify
ing — to be so close to someone, anyone. But
here, I see none of that. It is as if all those bar
riers that we unconsciously

erect between ourselves dur
ing the week melt away.
Four walls, a wooden floor
and a pair of sneakers or
socks, and it all just disap
pears. Simple. Effective.
Glorious.

The music here is
eclectic. It thrills, it chills,
and before you know it.
your foot is tapping of its
own accord. When did that

happen? But then, the best
part comes. Suddenly, a
song by Wild Cherry
comes on.They lay down
the boogie, play that

funky music, and now
the whole dance floor
is moving more or
less as one body. I A

can only imagine
what it must be
like if they

play the
Electric

Slide.
At

the end of the song, there's clapping and
cheering.
What is it about social dance here at Stan
ford that inspires so much passion in people?
What draws people in?
"Innovation." says Jason Fang '05, co
founder of Lindy in
White Plaza and long-

time member of Stan
ford dance group
Swingkids. "And a lit-

tle bit of spontaneity." Natu
rally. But what does that re
ally mean?

For the answer,
one need look no further
than the man whose stu-

dents refer to him as the god of
social dance, Richard Powers, a
dance historian who lectures in the
Dance department.

"My focus has always been
on the vernacular, dance as is real
ly done by real people," he said.
"The aim isn't to teach any for-

nal style, it's to allow students
to be flexible, to adapt to each
other."
i But what truly sets apart so-

cial dance at Stanford is
its vivacious presence.
"It's unique here,"

explains Powers. "There
are over 1,100 students in
the [Dance] classes. Not to
\ Un/41.. ~«U ...

speak badly 01 any other
schools, but it's not

that way anywhere else."
Of course not. Here on the Farm, we kick
it up a notch.
In fact, the sheer magnitude of social
dance's popularity on campus is slightly over
whelming. I sent just one email to my dorm
chat list asking if anybody was taking a social
dance class here at Stanford and within ten
minutes, 1 was bombarded with over a dozen
emails. The emails became so prolific 1 was
forced to create a filter so they wouldn't clog
up my inbox.
Even in casual conversation, social dance
manages to shimmy its way to center stage. I
had lunch with Jane Goldsmith '11a few days
ago. and I asked if there were any classes she's
taking this quarter that she likes.
"Oh. I'm in Social Dance II this quarter,"
she said immediately. A fountain of praise
followed. The love of social dance is in
escapable.
What struck me though, was that no matter
whom 1 asked all gave me a common re
sponse. "Oh, you should definitely come to
this class." "This class is great, you should
check it out." "I'm addicted to this class, you
should totally try it." Different words, same
sentiment.
Even when 1 tried to explain that, when I
dance, 1 look like a spastic monkey with a
hangover, the response was always the same.
It Doesn't Matter. Anyone. Everyone, Can
Learn. All Are Welcome. Come. Try.
DANCE.
