# Harbour Quartette sets sail
## 
### DONG LIU 
As the violinists' hows glided
gracefully over the strings of
their instruments, the tranquil
nightly atmosphere in Stan
ford's Campbell Recital Hall
was suddenly mellowed with a thousand nu
ances and dampened with a million hues. As
the violins began their telltale whispers of love
and grief they were joined by the viola's accom
panying groans of ecstasy and despair, fol
lowed by the cello's heavy bellows of anguish
and relief. The four instrumentalists glanced at
each other occasionally, understandingly. with
the kind of telepathy that transcended the
boundaries of language and the medium of
space. ITieir individual melody lines recoiled
and intertwined with each other, building on
the mutual harmonies and rising on the shared
motifs, until all four lines became indiscernible
in a unifying climax of dizzying splendor and
mesmerizing depth.
Stanford's Harbour Quartette has sought to
spread the innate beauty of classical music to
the nearby community through its various pri
vate appearances and public performances,
ranging from President John Hennessy's for
mal dinners to the Sequoia Nursing Home in
Portola Valley. Violinists Tai-Jin Lee '08, a grad
student in Management Science and Engineer
ing (MS&E), and Alison Wong '08, along with
violist Peter Ahn 08 and cellist Grace An '08,
launched the Quartette during the Stanford
Symphony Concert Tour in 2005 in Sydney,
Australia. The Harbour Quartette was subse
quently named after the Sydney Harbour,
whose spelling is characteristic of the Aus
tralian and New Zealand dialects.
After its establishment, the Quartette's first
goal was to play its own chamber music concert
— which it accomplished in the winter quarter
of 2006 with much success, according to
Stephen Harrison, the group's coach and men
tor and Stanford's senior lecturer in cello and
chamber music.
An is the only music major among the four,
while Ahn, Wong and Lee are pursuing careers
in economics, human biology and MS&E, re
spectively. Yet their apparent division in career
paths did not prevent them from finding "com
mon love for each other in making music," An
said. She also commented that over the three
years of practicing, rehearsing and performing
together the four had become an inseparable
family — the goal of making music had tran
scended their ordinary material boundaries
and united them in a special camaraderie.
Those with experience in ensemble per
formance might know that playing in a quartet
is often fourfold as difficult as playing solo —
the players are not only required to perform
their own parts at the strictest rhythmical ca
dence, but also to listen to each other's melody

lines to fill in the gaps and hold back the excess
es. Unlike solo musicians,ensembles musicians
often take the dual role of performer and audi
ence. It's the only way that the different instru
ments can mingle into an organic whole. In ad-

dition. the teamwork
and group spirit re
quired in rehearsal
and performance de
mand a favorable
mix of personalities.
According to the
Quartette, Harrison's
support and advice
has been invaluable.
"He teaches each of
us how to practice
our own difficult pas
sages," Wong said.
"But he also guides

us in how to rehearse and interpret the music as
a quartet."
Harrison also acknowledged 'he group's
startling progress throughout the three years.
"They have learned a great deal about each
other and what it means to trust each other in
performance," he said. "Their performances
are filled with enthusiasm and spirit, and their
group sound has matured over time, too."
Additional challenges included juggling ac
ademic demands and quartet responsibilities.

"We re not elitists.
We just believe in
the traditional
string quartet."

which often came in conflict with one another
at the most crucial — and inopportune —
times. According to Wong, the quartet rehears
es together for two to five hours a week, which
doesn't include the individual practice time to

learn their own parts
so that they could
work on more group
oriented elements
during rehearsal
time.
"1 know that their ac
ademic lives are de
manding, and I ad
mire them deeply for
having made a deep
commitment to each
other and to the
great pieces of music
they work on and

perform," Harrison said.
Last May the Quartette delivered a success
ful performance of Johannes Brahms' "Quar
tet No. 2" and Felix Mendelssohn's "Quartet in
I) Major" at their annual concert in Stanford's
Campbell Recital Hall.The audience was com
prised of both Stanford students and local com
munity residents interested in classical music.
"We usually pick two contrasting pieces for
performance, but we also try to pick pieces that
everybody can enjoy and appreciate," Lee said.

"Most of the time someone will bring in a piece
he likes [and] we'll try to sight-read it."
Brahms and Mendelssohn were late Classi
cal and early Romantic composers. While
Brahms' Germanic roots inspired him to write
heavy orchestral compositions with thick
sonority and loud dynamics. Mendelssohn's
Austrian background enabled him to compose
lighter and brighter pastoral pieces with de
lightful depictions of the Austrian countryside.
When asked about classical music's never
augmenting, if not gradually waning, influence
in the modern entertainment industry and con
fronted with the suggestion that they should
become a tribute quartet to pop and rock
music, the Quartette reaffirmed its adamant
belief in the staying power of classical music.
"As classically-trained musicians, we don't
consider to perform the other genres of music,"
Lee said. "But we're not elitists. We just believe
in the traditional string quartet."
"There's so much to classical music but
we've only skimmed over the surface of it, so
why would we want to delve into other gen
res?" Ahn said. "What really drew us to classi
cal music is its intricacies and complexities that
give it a mystical aura in modern times. There
are so many subtleties in a single piece that you

can never learn everything at once."
An compared playing a classical
music piece to reading a classical
novel.
"They're both timeless forms of
art that are never going to die away
no matter what," she said. "Even in
modern times, classical music is not
dead; it's so alive. You really have to
put yourself inside the music to ap
preciate it."
"With rock and pop covers, 1 feel
that the work's already there and you
can't make it your own," An contin
ued."But with classical music you can
always go further, and there are no set
ways to do it. You can express all your
emotions and your feelings in the
music, and it's worth devoting your
life to it."
"By playing something that has
been played in the 1800s, we recreate
the historical scene," Ahn added.
"And finding something different
while playing the same music is very
special.".
Throughout their three years of
professional performance, the Quar
tette has played at mainly paid venues
— an impressive list of more than
fifty appearances including the Stan
ford Medical School, the Alumni
School, the Senior School, President
Hennessy's private dinner, the Math
Department, Admit Weekend, Com
mencement, US Congressmen's SRI
and even once at a McDonald's con
ference.
When asked about their most
memorable performance, Wong re
counted an unforgettable experience
playing at the Sequoia Nursing Home
in Portola Valley. They played a full
concert to the elderly residents of the
nursing home, many of whom gradu
ated from Stanford in the 19205.
The nursing home provided audio
and visual broadcast to aid the resi
dents' experience of the concert.
"We were very touched when we
realized how much sharing our music
with them brightened up their days,
whether they were watching and lis
tening to us perform live in the audi
torium or from the TV monitors in
their rooms," Wong said. "However,
while we were touched by their kind
words, they also inspired us as a quar
tet and re-instilled in us the joys of
making music."
The group decided to revisit the
Nursing Home this May to give a sec
ond concert.
Another memorable experience
was playing at President John Hen
nessy's private dinner for Stanford's

top 50 donors. Hennessy emailed the
music department and requested a
group to play at his house for the
opening segment before dinner.
Music Prof. Jonathan Berger recom
mended the Harbour Quartette. Ac
cording to Ahn, Hennessy gave them
special recognition by introducing
them to the party of donors before
their performance.
"I think what really surprises our
audience at concerts is that we're not
all music majors," Wong said. Al
though the prospect of graduation
and job markets will force the dis
banding of the quartet after this sum
mer, the members are determined to
pursue their lifelong love of perform
ing classical music at every opportu
nity.
"Even though Tai-Jin, Peter, and I
don't plan on making careers in the
music field, music will always be a
part of us, and I'm sure we'll all still
play for fun and attend concerts
whenever we can," she said. "It just
shows that vou don't have to commit

your life as a professional musician to
explore and enjoy your passion for
music."
Harrison also noted the apparent
dilemma and obvious paradox be
tween music and career.
"They are a group of enormously
talented and hard-working young
adults who take great joy in striving
for excellence while doing what they
love," he said. "They have been given
some lovely opportunities to perform
at special functions across campus. In
that way. they represent what music
can be to Stanford students pursuing
all kinds of different courses of
study."
The musicians plan to make the
most of the time they have left togeth
er.
"Goal for the rest of the year?" An
said. "We have our annual concert in
May. After that we will go out with a
bang."
