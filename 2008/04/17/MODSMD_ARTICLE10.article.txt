## GUP case heads to court again 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and Santa Clara County
will soon go to battle with the
Committee for Green Foothills
before the State Supreme Court, all
over a dispute regarding the build
ing of a trail.
The Committee for Green
Foothills has been engaged in a legal
battle with Stanford and Santa Clara
County since 2006, quarrelling over
the construction of a nature trail
that the county permitted Stanford
to build on county land. The
Committee claimed the plan needed
further environmental review.
The courts are debating whether
the Committee for Green Foothill's
lawsuit is valid.
"The Committee for Green
Foothills sued in court to stop the
agreement by Stanford to do the
trail," said Larry Horton, the
University's director of government
and community relations. "But they
filed the lawsuit after the statute of
limitations had expired. They did
not meet the 30-day deadline."
Brian Schmidt JD '99, the Santa
Clara County Legislative Advocate
for the Committee for Green
Foothills, disagreed.
"There were two potential dead
lines. a 30-day deadline or a 180-day
deadline," Schmidt said. "We did not
meet the 30-day deadline because

we did not feel that that deadline
was the one that applied."
Horton expressed faith that
Stanford was in the right.
"We are confident that we are
100 percent fulfilling our obligations
to the GUP." Horton said, referring
to Stanford's General Use Permit.
"We are confident about the case."
Another part of the controversy
relates to the fact that the trail
weaves through four jurisdictions —
that of Santa Clara County, San
Mateo County, Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
"Because the trail goes through
several jurisdictions, we said we
would do and pay for the entire
trail," Horton said. "We want to
build the trail along the border of
Stanford land, along Alpine Road."
So far. the trail has already been
completed in the Menlo Park and
Santa Clara jurisdictions of the trail.
Santa Clara County required
Stanford to offer $8.4 million to San
Mateo County to improve the part
of the trail that lies within San
Mateo jurisdiction. This offer is
open until 2011. but the Committee
for Green Foothills is fighting for an
alternate trail that will not run
through San Mateo.
The Committee for Green
Foothills insists that they simply
want the trail constructed as it was
shown in the Santa Clara
Countywide Trails Master Plan.

"Stanford is now trying to change
the trail location after they got the
agreement," said Schmidt.
According to Schmidt, the alter
nate trail will avoid environmental
impacts hut otherwise meet the Trail
Master Plan. ITiis alternate trail will
go around the outside edge of the
golf course through the Dish
foothills to the Arastradero
Preserve. This route will not run
through San Mateo jurisdiction.
Stanford dismisses the trail sug
gested by the Committee for Green
Foothills, saying that such a trail was
not part of the requirements of the
GUP and would he too intrusive for
future development along Stanford
land.
"The routes are what we are
required to do, it's just the precise
locations that have to be deter
mined," Morton added. "Many of
the groups complaining want a
nature trail cutting through Stanford
land, but that was not what was
agreed upon."
Schmidt said that the Committee
for Green Foothills is not anti-
Stanford.
"The Committee for Green
Foothills is composed of many
Stanford-affiliated people that are
watch-dogging Stanford develop
ment." Schmidt said.
