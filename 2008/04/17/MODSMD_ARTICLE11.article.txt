## Editorial Board Thinking twice about dismantling Meyer 
### 
Forty-one years ago next month, archi
tect and Stanford alumnus John Carl
Warnecke oversaw the dedication of a
new building on campus. Later to he recog
nized for his work in the brutalist style of ar
chitecture on such structures as a library at
Georgetown University and a skyscraper in
Manhattan, Warnecke is mostly forgotten by
the Stanford community today But his con
tribution to our University is not: every day,
people must bike around, walk through, or
study in J. Henry Meyer Memorial Library.
With the news breaking a few weeks ago
on the inner pages of The Daily that Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.l) '82 had singled out
Meyer Library for demolition and recon
struction in the near future, there was almost
no response. Few even noticed until The
Daily ran a front page story about the li
brary's imminent destruction last Monday.
But now that the issue has been raised in the
community at large, a small group of voices
is starting to murmur in opposition to the
plan, especially concerning the displace
ment of the East Asian Library', located on
the fourth floor of Meyer.
The justification for the demolition, set
for 2012 at the latest, seems sound. Stanford
has been dutifully conducting seismic up
grades of older structures since the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. In the wake of last
Tuesday's 5.6 magnitude tremor, these
retro-fittings are especially prescient, and
probably a very good investment: Stanford
spent over $200 million recovering from
damage in 1989.
Etchemendy indicated that refitting
Meyer would cost more than $40 million and
make it even less aesthetically appealing,
while tearing the structure down and replac
ing it made more economic sense.The build
ing already stands squarely in a major cam
pus traffic corridor: who hasn't been frus
trated by having to bike around Meyer,
often several times in one day for those liv
ing on East Campus? And many (though not
all) agree with Andrew Herkovic, director of
communications and development of li
braries, when he calls Meyer "an eyesore."
Sorry, John Carl.
But if the University is to destroy Meyer
and build a modified library in its place at
considerable expense, it must do it right, and

not make another expensive, edificial mis
take that will last until 2050. While plans are
still being drawn up, they seem to indicate
that the smaller footprint of the new library
will improve traffic flow at that critical point
linking the academic center of campus to the
Escondido corridor. Administration offi
cials have promised to retain, in some form,
the academic, computing and technological
resources currently housed in Meyer, which
may be rarely used but which prove invalu
able every once in a while.
So far so good, but one sticky issue re
mains: what to do with the East Asian Li
brary? University Librarian Michael Keller
wrote in an open letter that the EAL would
find a new home at an auxiliary library in
Livermore, "available through a paging
service." But this is a questionable decision,
even if texts in the ever-migrating East
Asian Library (it was housed in Hoover
Tower as recently as 2002) might be less fre
quently sought than some others.
Especially sensitive in the case of the
East Asian Library, electronic character
recognition technology for Chinese charac
ters is still maturing. Because of non-stan
dard transliterations of these East Asian lan
guages into Roman characters, these texts
are very hard to find over Socrates, making
the otherwise quite efficient auxiliary li
brary system a particularly poor choice.
Some faculty members who work with the
EAL frequently fear that they may effec
tively lose access to the collection forever. It
seems reasonable that a different collection
of rarely-used books, one easier to search
electronically, be shipped off campus in
stead.
Ihe administration defends the decision
to downsize by pointing out the land-use re
strictions imposed by Santa Clara County.
The General Use Permit (freely available
for browsing at gup.stanford.edu) restricts
square footage of academic space, and the
Provost explains that every square foot used
for book storage space would mean another
square foot unavailable for student or facul
ty academic space. This is a compelling rea
son to move rarely-used books instead of
people who need to work on campus, but

choosing the right collection of
books is essential.
The plan to destroy and replace
Meyer has been welcomed by most
of those who regard the library as a
blot on an otherwise beautiful land

scape and an impediment to traffic
in central campus. But the Stanford
community must hold the adminis
tration accountable and see to it that
whatever rises in Meyer's place is
worth the expense. And this must in
clude finding an acceptable new
home — on campus — for the East
Asian Library.
