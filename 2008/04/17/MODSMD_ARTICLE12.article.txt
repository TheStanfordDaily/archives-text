# The
						Wanderer
## Condi's return 
### 
Condoleezza Rice is coming back. The
former professor and provost has dis
pelled any lingering doubt that she
might stick around Washington after her
long tenure in the Hush administration as
National Security Advisor and then Secre
tary of State. "I am going back to Stanford,
back to California, west of the Mississippi."
she said on April 8, according to a report by
the Associated Press."! very much look for
ward to watching this campaign and voting
as a voter."
Periodically over the course of the Hush
administration, there have been whispers
that Rice was positioning herself for a vice
presidential candidacy, and much has been
made of her potential as a running mate for
John McCain this fall. Despite her many de
nials, a former administration spokesman,
Dan Senor, told ABC last week that Rice was
"actively" campaigning, and Grover
Norquist.head of the influential conservative
group Americans for Tax Reform, told the
Washington Post that he thought Rice would
be "great" as president or vice president.
I"his created some intense beltway up
roar, prompting Rice to try once more to de
finitively quash the rumor. "I don't want to
be. don't intend to be. won't be on the tick
et." she said on April 15.
So barring any jolting Trent Johnson
esque reversals. Condi could be here by
spring quarter 2009. What will her return
mean for Stanford? Will there be protests
like those that met Donald Rumsfeld's tem
porary Hoover Institution appointment?
Will she teach? Will there be protests during
her teaching?
For some reason. I keep seeing this image
of naked body-painted protesters storming
the classroom or auditorium during Rice's
first class. Maybe they will even be naked,
body-painted and on a hunger strike at the
same time. This could create an epic stand
off, as Rice is famously unflappable. When a
Code Pink protester rushed her with fake
blood-coated palms last fall at the Capitol,
Rice not only didn't flinch, she asked the
Capitol Police to take it easy on the woman.
On the other hand. Rice does not pro
voke quite the same enmity as Rumsfeld, so
maybe the arrival will be quieter. Every offi
cial biography I could find — including the
White House, State Department, Hoover In
stitution and Political Science Department

— proudly notes that, while teaching at
Stanford. Rice won the 1984 Walter J. Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching and the
1993 School of Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching.
This suggests she knows how to connect with
students.
Another question: if Rice does return to
teaching, will her classes focus on her old
specialties of politics in the Soviet Union
and nuclear arms strategy, or will she have
some new subject based on her diplomatic
tenure?
Unfortunately for those of us graduating
in 2009, we may not be around to find out the
answers to these and other questions, like
whether Rice will have office hours. In an in
terview with the Daily last May, current
Provost John Etchemendy said that if Rice
elects to teach, it will probably not be imme
diate. "My guess is that she will not teach in
her first year back, since anyone who holds a
job as overwhelming as hers needs at least a
year to decompress," he said. "She will prob
ably spend that year recording her reflec
tions about her terms as National Security
Advisor and Secretary of State."
If (at only age 53) Rice does take the
memoirs route, her account of her time in of
fice will be interesting to compare with the
harsher versions of others. "She presided
over a dysfunctional security apparatus,
never able to pull together the warring De
fense and State Departments and regularly
outmaneuvered by Rumsfeld," wrote Lon
don Guardian writer Jonathan Freedland in
a review of "Twice as Good," a 2007 Rice bi
ography by Stanford alum Marcus Mabry.
"It's also clear that she ignored repeated
warnings of both the seriousness of the
Qaeda threat and the risks of an Iraq inva
sion," Freedland added.
In an interview with the WashintonTimes
at the end of March, Rice refused to back
