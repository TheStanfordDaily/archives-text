/\ U.S. Coasts by 2099," "The Fu-
A. \.turc is Drying Up.""World Popu
lation Will Explode by 2025." Each morning
when 1 check the headlines, I expect to final
ly see the one 1 know every editor is aching to
print: "We're All Going to DIE."
By now most people are well aware of the
environmental crises facing the world today,
and we know what our fate will be if — or as
many presume, when — we fail to act. Car
bon emissions from our fossil fuel use are
causing catastrophic climate change. Defor
estation is driving the extinction of tens of
thousands of species per year. Pollution of
our air and waterways is increasing the
prevalence of asthma, cancer and birth de
fects. The list of environmental tragedies
goes on and on.
So what can we do to save our planet in
crisis? Look no further than the end of those
Doomsday articles, which include such won
derful eco-tips as: turn your thermostat down
two degrees, take shorter showers, drive a
Prius.
Really? Is that all we've got? If it is, we re
ally are all going to die.
It's true, by turning down your thermo-

stat, you'll save natural gas, and less gas
means less carbon emissions. It is also true
that by taking a shorter shower, you'll waste
less water and energy, and by driving a Prius,
you'll use less gasoline. Guess what?! With
the media's helpful eco-tips, you can learn to
be less bad!
Don't get me wrong, I love conservation
and efficiency (conservation = doing less
with less, efficiency = doing the same or bet
ter with less) as much as the next eco-man,
and I do everything I can to promote them.
But as I do so, I can't help thinking that
maybe we're going at this the wrong way.
Imagine what would happen if the local
weight loss clinic took this same "less bad"
approach, running a campaign with the slo
gan: 'in thirty days, we can make you less fat!
You'll still be fat, but at least you'll be less
fat!!!" No one would sign up, because no one
wants to be less fat — they want to be thin.
Humans, Americans and especially Stanford
students aren't inspired by negatives —
we're inspired by positives.
We are in desperate need of a vision, and

not one of environmental doom and gloom,
as is reported daily in the media. Rather, what
we need is a vision of environmental hope. A
vision of an ecologically sound world that ac
tually works. A world in which there is no
waste and no pollution, and in which every
one and everything, human or otherwise, has
enough resources to survive and thrive. A
world in which all environmental, economic
and social indicators are getting steadily bet
ter, not worse, and where people are getting
happier, not more depressed. What we need is
a blueprint for a world of good.
Now, I'm not delusional. I fully under
stand the gravity of our current situation, and
1 know just how far we are from this world of
good. But I also know that we will never get
there unless we start with a vision of where
we want to end up.
The good news is that we've been working
on just such a vision for over thirty years. Vi
sionaries like Rachel Carson, Amory Lovins,
Janine Benyus, Paul Hawken, Bill McDo
nough and many others in all sectors across
the globe have devoted their lives to imagin
ing a greener world. The legwork has been
