## Can the FCC fix the Internet? 
### 
When the Federal Communications
Commission takes the stage at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium for its second hear
ing on broadband, it'll be taking a trip down
memory lane.
For one, the precise topic of the hearing —
what types of control broadband owners have
and ought to have over content, applications or
technologies that run on broadband infrastruc
tures— is relevant to Stanford history. More
than thirty years ago, innovators like Vinton
Cerf (now Google's Chief Internet Evangelist)
were likely to be found considering the value of
neutrality in the design of ARPANET, one of
the precursors to the Internet. It was Cerf who,
together with Robert E. Kahn at the University
of California-Los Angeles, pioneered the
TCP/IP protocol suite.This protocol is the orig
inal lingua franca of the Internet, enabling data
to travel without discrimination from server to
server throughout the Internet until that data

reaches its destination.
Today, neutral network design principles are
being debated once again — albeit with much
higher stakes for a wider (and still growing)
population of Internet users and for a capital
rich group of broadband providers. Many citi
zens and consumers increasingly rely on appli
cations or technologies that owners of broad
band networks prefer to block or otherwise
control. Why? As property holders of major
portions of this country's communication infra
structure, providers like Comcast want to move
away from neutral principles and get users to
"pay to play." In Comcast's eyes, someone who
uses peer-to-peer (P2P) software is taking up
bandwidth and not adding to their bottom line.
The logic of blocking and of pay-to-play
schemes proposed by broadband providers is,
however, highly flawed. Tiered access — what
the industry euphemistically calls "quality of
service" — doesn't serve citizens or consumers.

Instead, such corporate practices unfairly dis
criminate against certain types of speech, by
slowing or preventing access tocontent, applica
tions or technologies that refuse to pay toll
prices for data transmission or that merely seem
suspicious. Under a tiered access scheme, a per
son using —or even studying! — P2P tech
nologies for legal file-sharing would he under
threat. So would a person who simply can't af
ford the higher priced service. In other words,
neutrality is more desirable — not only for the
legacy that Cerf. Kahn and others passed down
to future Internet generations, but also for the
sake of academic freedom, free speech and
equality.
The FCC's trip down memory lane isn't only
about Internet history or Internet freedom. It's
also about doing —or redoing — democracy.
In many respects, the hearing at Stanford is an
