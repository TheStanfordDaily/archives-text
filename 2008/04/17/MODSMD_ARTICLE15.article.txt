## Can the FCC fix the Internet? 
### 
When the Federal Communications
Commission takes the stage at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium for its second hear
ing on broadband, it'll be taking a trip down
memory lane.
For one, the precise topic of the hearing —
what types of control broadband owners have
and ought to have over content, applications or
technologies that run on broadband infrastruc
tures— is relevant to Stanford history. More
than thirty years ago, innovators like Vinton
Cerf (now Google's Chief Internet Evangelist)
were likely to be found considering the value of
neutrality in the design of ARPANET, one of
the precursors to the Internet. It was Cerf who,
together with Robert E. Kahn at the University
of California-Los Angeles, pioneered the
TCP/IP protocol suite.This protocol is the orig
inal lingua franca of the Internet, enabling data
to travel without discrimination from server to
server throughout the Internet until that data

reaches its destination.
Today, neutral network design principles are
being debated once again — albeit with much
higher stakes for a wider (and still growing)
population of Internet users and for a capital
rich group of broadband providers. Many citi
zens and consumers increasingly rely on appli
cations or technologies that owners of broad
band networks prefer to block or otherwise
control. Why? As property holders of major
portions of this country's communication infra
structure, providers like Comcast want to move
away from neutral principles and get users to
"pay to play." In Comcast's eyes, someone who
uses peer-to-peer (P2P) software is taking up
bandwidth and not adding to their bottom line.
The logic of blocking and of pay-to-play
schemes proposed by broadband providers is,
however, highly flawed. Tiered access — what
the industry euphemistically calls "quality of
service" — doesn't serve citizens or consumers.

Instead, such corporate practices unfairly dis
criminate against certain types of speech, by
slowing or preventing access tocontent, applica
tions or technologies that refuse to pay toll
prices for data transmission or that merely seem
suspicious. Under a tiered access scheme, a per
son using —or even studying! — P2P tech
nologies for legal file-sharing would he under
threat. So would a person who simply can't af
ford the higher priced service. In other words,
neutrality is more desirable — not only for the
legacy that Cerf. Kahn and others passed down
to future Internet generations, but also for the
sake of academic freedom, free speech and
equality.
The FCC's trip down memory lane isn't only
about Internet history or Internet freedom. It's
also about doing —or redoing — democracy.
In many respects, the hearing at Stanford is an
attempt to make up for a botched
event on the same topic at Harvard
held last February. Controversy erupt
ed when Comcast spokeswoman Jen
nifer Khoury admitted that Comcast
had hired people to attend the event.
Rather than hearing from the public,
the Commission was treated to a room
full of seat-warmers whose presence
prevented other interested members
of the public from having a voice and
speaking to broadband issues. In other
words, the Harvard event was little
more than a sham and an embarrassing
episode in the FCC's rulemaking
process.
Whether the FCC can get it right
this time and foster a substantive de
bate may be another issue altogether.
From the classroom (such as Stan
ford's undergraduate course in the
"First Amendment in the Digital
Era") to community centers (at
places like One East Palo Alto. Bay
Area Video Coalition and Oakland's

Center for Media Justice), many are
poised to weigh in about broadband
and fair network practices. But. even
if a broader range of stakeholders
finds a seat in the room or a place on
the dais at Dinkelspiel. participation
is certainly no guarantee of influence.
As the six hearings from the FCC's
recent high-profile media ownership
debate demonstrated, an outraged
public can turn out. testify' for hours
on end and do very little to persuade
the Commission to vote in its favor.
What is needed is not only a hearing
in front of the FCC but also a chance
for the public to be heard and hear
each other in the broader public
sphere. In other words, we need a na
tional dialogue on the future of this
country's communication infrastruc
ture that includes citizens, consumers
and Congress, not just the Commission
and industry actors. Stanford is a fitting
place to begin that dialogue. Ix't's hope
it continues.
