2005, Oklahoma. 2006. Oklahoma
again. 2007. Penn State.
The NCAA champions of 2008? By
Friday night, the country will know who is
the best men's gymnastics team in the na
tion. The No. 1 Stanford men say the title
is theirs for the taking.
"If we do what we've been training."
said senior Chris Harper, "no one can
touch us."
The rest of the team's leadership
echoed Harper's sentiment.They are con
fident and excited for the final meet of the
season.
After watching Oklahoma celebrate
consecutive national championships and
seeing Penn State take home the title last
year, the Cardinal men are ready to bring
a championship back to the Farm. The
team hasn't won an NCAA title since
1995, while California, Oklahoma and
Penn State have combined to win nine of
the 12 championships since.
Also motivating the Stanford men is
the fact that they will be competing in
front of a home crowd, giving them a sig
nificant advantage â€” the host school has
won two of the past three NCAA meets.
But it will be a tough challenge for the
Cardinal. The men usually compete in
Burnham Pavillion on well-broken-in
equipment. ITie NCAAs, on the other
hand, will take place in Maples on equip
ment that has only been used once. Stan
ford has been practicing at Maples all
week to get a feel for the new apparatus
es.
"We had to use this week to get com
fortable and make it a home meet again,"
said senior Eli Alcaraz. "It's normal to see
people slipping a little at first [on the new
equipment]," he added.
But the team has made the necessary
adjustments.
"The equipment is fine." said Harper,
who is No. 6 in the nation on pommel
horse. "[The parallel] bars were tight and
responsive." he said after warming up on
Wednesday."l feel ready."
The Stanford team has a wealth of ex
perience in big meets. Harper, junior
Jason Shen. Alcaraz. and seniors David
Sender and Sho Nakamori have each
been to three NCAA championship
meets. Redshirt senior Dylan Carney has
four under his belt.
"I'm not too nervous because this is my
fifth NCAAs. and I've got a great team
around me," said Carney, the team's co
captain along with Sender.
After injuring his ankle a couple of
weeks ago, Carney sat out the conference
championship meet two weekends ago so

seems to have worked.
"The ankle's feeling pretty good," he
said. "It hurts, but 1 can't do any more
damage to it so I'll he ready to go [on floor
exercise] if needed."
Carney is also set to compete on high bar,
an event in which he won the 20()6 NCAA
individual title.
As Alcaraz put it.the Stanford upper
classmen are prepared "physically, men
tally and emotionally."
The six Cardinal freshmen, on the
other hand, are going into their first
NCAA Championship meet. But don't
call them inexperienced.
"They do have a lot of big meet experi
ence." said Alcaraz of the team's fresh
men. Tim Gentry. Josh Dixon. Alex
Buscaglia. and Ryan Lieberman all have
experience at national level club meets.
But the team's senior guidance will still
be useful. Shen's main advice to the fresh
men has been to stay aggressive.
"We don't have to be perfect to win,"
said Shen. "We just need to keep doing
what we've been practicing and hit our
sets and we'll win,"
Gentry has heeded the advice of his
elders, and the results have been phenom
enal. He is ranked sixth in the country on
still rings and will be competing this
weekend on vault as well. Gentry has pre
pared for the most important meet in col
legiate gymnastics by treating it like, well,
just another meet.
"Once you start putting [the meet] up
on a pedestal, you put too much pressure
on yourself and it can hurt you," he said.
"The upperclassmen have done a great
job helping us keep that in mind."
"I've just told [the freshmen] to keep
doing what they're doing," said Harper.
Co-captain Sender is confident in the
ability and mental toughness of his
younger teammates.
"I have a lot of faith in our freshman,"
