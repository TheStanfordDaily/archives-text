Student-athlete. For some collegiate
athletes, the second term will be more
important than the first for four years;
for others, the opposite.
For freshman Greg I lirshman of the Stanford
men's tennis team, the terms just might be in per
fect balance. One of the newest student-athletes
on campus this year. Hirshman has adjusted to
the college scene very smoothly, taking full ad
vantage of Stanford's academic opportunities
while excelling on the tennis court in his first year.
"What 1 liked most about Stanford was its
combination of athletics and academics," Hirsh
man said of his decision to come here over other
top universities like I larvard and Yale. "There is
no other university in this country that provides
the superb combination of athletics and academ
ics that Stanford has to offer."
On the court, Hirshman has made an immedi
ate impact on the team this year. Sometimes in
collegiate athletics, new freshmen are eased into
the college scene of their sport by redshirting so
they can get used to the speed and intensity of the

game. But not Hirshman. He has played in nearly
every match the team has played, appearing at ei
ther No. 5 or No. 6 singles and at No. 3 doubles. He
and partner sophomore Richard Wire have the
best doubles record on the team at 19-9 and have
contributed many big wins together.
Known for some mildly outlandish antics on
the court, Hirshman is a lively player, and his en
ergy is palpable on the court and even in the
stands.
"[Greg] and Richard have complemented
each other well," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "He can pump Rich up. All three
[doubles] teams can get energized by him. That's
what doubles is all about."
He also has an 18-12 record in singles and pro
vides a tough challenge, regardless of the fact that
the lower part of the singles lineups often does
not feature the highest caliber of players.
"Having played either No. 5 or No. 6 singles in
just about every match, I have come to learn how
important those spots are for any team." Hirsh
man said. "I'm not as good a player as [freshman]
Alex [Clayton] or [junior] Matt [Bruch], but my

match counts exactly the same as
theirs do.
"My winning at 5 or 6 makes a
huge difference for our team overall,"
he added. "There is definitely a lot of
pressure."
Pressure? From the outside, Hir
shman handles the pressure like an
experienced senior: twice this year
the overall match has come down to
him. and twice he has pulled out a
tough three-set victory for the team.
He highlights those two matches as

his most memorable tennis moments
this year.
"Greg is one of the most competi
tive people I have ever met," said jun
ior captain Jeff Zeller."And that helps
him win a lot of tennis matches."
"[He] has done a great job as a
freshman," Whitlinger said. "When he
is on the court he gives 110%. I love
his fire, his enthusiasm, his drive.
"He might not be the most stylish
player, but he gets the job done."
Hirshman also gets the job done
off the court as well. As much has be
has to handle in tennis, Hirshman has
thus far been able to thrive in Stan
ford's challenging academic environ
ment. His goal is to maintain his two
quarter GPA of 3.9 throughout his

four years while majoring in mathe
matics and economics.
He started his own newspaper,
"The Cardinal Principle",a politically
focused newspaper that prints well
written and respectful articles from
any political or intellectual viewpoint.
The paper already has two assistant
editors and ten staff writers.
If that isn't enough for the young
freshman, there's more.
He will appear in a movie this up
coming summer, a tennis documen
tary called "Unstrung", inspired by
former world No. 1 Jim Courier.
While at the junior national champi
onship tournament in summer 2004.
his antics during a match caught the
eye of one of the directors, and by the

end of the year he was notified he
would be featured in the movie.
The cameras came to his La Jolla,
Calif, home to film his life, which in
cluded going to school, playing the vi
olin, doing math problems, solving a
Rubik's cube and showing up for ten
nis practice. They have filmed him
playing in national tournaments, doc
umenting his unconventional behav
ior on and off the court.The movie al
ready debuted at the Tribecca Film
Festival in New York in 2007 and is set
to make a national debut on ESPN2
on May 25.
But the movie star, student, musi
cian, intellectual and tennis player is
just a normal kid. too. His favorite
part about being on the Stanford

team is the camaraderie the team has.
"We are a very close team, and we
all support each other very much,"
said Hirshman. "It's not only impor
tant for winning matches, but for get
ting through the sometimes challeng
ing day-to-day life of a student-ath
lete at Stanford."
So although the tennis team and
the team's success are very important
to 1 lirshman. his classroom perform
ance is equally important to him.
Plans to continue tennis after college
do not seem to be in the picture.
"Although it would be great to be
a professional tennis player, that
prospect is highly unlikely," Hirsh
man said. "1 would like to go to law
school and practice law for many

years. Later on, 1 would like to go into
politics and maybe be a congressman
or senator someday."
But for now, it's Stanford and Stan
ford tennis. The freshman still has
many college years ahead of him.
many years to take on a number of ac
tivities and make his name known in
numerous areas of the Stanford com
munity. He will no doubt continue to
succeed as a student-athlete, hitting
tennis shots by day and computing
derivatives by night.
No matter what aspect of Stanford
you are involved in, you just might
hear from Greg Hirshman soon.
