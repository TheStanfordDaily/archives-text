Student-athlete. For some collegiate
athletes, the second term will be more
important than the first for four years;
for others, the opposite.
For freshman Greg I lirshman of the Stanford
men's tennis team, the terms just might be in per
fect balance. One of the newest student-athletes
on campus this year. Hirshman has adjusted to
the college scene very smoothly, taking full ad
vantage of Stanford's academic opportunities
while excelling on the tennis court in his first year.
"What 1 liked most about Stanford was its
combination of athletics and academics," Hirsh
man said of his decision to come here over other
top universities like I larvard and Yale. "There is
no other university in this country that provides
the superb combination of athletics and academ
ics that Stanford has to offer."
On the court, Hirshman has made an immedi
ate impact on the team this year. Sometimes in
collegiate athletics, new freshmen are eased into
the college scene of their sport by redshirting so
they can get used to the speed and intensity of the

game. But not Hirshman. He has played in nearly
every match the team has played, appearing at ei
ther No. 5 or No. 6 singles and at No. 3 doubles. He
and partner sophomore Richard Wire have the
best doubles record on the team at 19-9 and have
contributed many big wins together.
Known for some mildly outlandish antics on
the court, Hirshman is a lively player, and his en
ergy is palpable on the court and even in the
stands.
"[Greg] and Richard have complemented
each other well," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "He can pump Rich up. All three
[doubles] teams can get energized by him. That's
what doubles is all about."
He also has an 18-12 record in singles and pro
vides a tough challenge, regardless of the fact that
the lower part of the singles lineups often does
not feature the highest caliber of players.
"Having played either No. 5 or No. 6 singles in
just about every match, I have come to learn how
important those spots are for any team." Hirsh
man said. "I'm not as good a player as [freshman]
Alex [Clayton] or [junior] Matt [Bruch], but my
