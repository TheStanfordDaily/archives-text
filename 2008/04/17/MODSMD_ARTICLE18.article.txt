## Mavs win, claim West sixth seed 
### JAIME ARON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DALLAS — Jason Kidd had the
100 th triple-double of his career and
sparked a 30-8 stretch that sent the
Dallas Mavericks past the New Or
leans Hornets, 111-98 Wednesday
night, and set up a first-round show
down between these teams.
Kidd had 27 points, 10 assists and
10 rebounds for his first triple-double
since rejoining the Mavericks, the
team he was with when he broke into
the NBA and began piling up the
stats. He already was No. 3 on the ca
reer list, behind Oscar Robertson and
Magic Johnson, but now he has joined
them in triple-figure, triple-doubles.
New Orleans came in locked into
the No. 2 seed in the Western Confer
ence. but Dallas — which was coming
off consecutive losses to lottery
bound teams — needed a victory to
clinch the seventh seed. A loss by the
Mavericks and a win by Denver later
Wednesday would've meant a first
round series between the Hornets
and Nuggets, with Dallas facing the
Los Angeles Lakers.
New Orleans coach Byron Scott
could've gone with reserves for most
of the game, or even most of the sec
ond half, especially after his starters
took a 50-48 lead into halftime. In
stead, he decided to try avoiding Dal
las, even if that meant the chance of
losing to a team his young club is
about to face for much higher stakes.
It seemed like a good idea when
Chris Paul and David West upped the
lead to 70-59.
But then came the 10-minute spurt
that both teams will be thinking about
until Game 1.
Dallas tied it at 76, then went
ahead on a violent dunk by Brandon
Bass that turned into a three-point
play. West quickly answered with a
jumper, but then the Mavericks ran
off 12 straight points.
Dallas came out of the run leading
91-78. Kidd and Jason Terry each
scored 10 points along the way.
The Hornets got to 100-96 on a
driving layup by West with 2:43 left,
but Terry hit a jumper, then Bass
blocked West. Josh Howard hit a 3-
pointer and the Mavericks pulled
away one last time.
Kidd got his 10th assists on
Howard's 3, then snatched the next
available rebound. Fans who'd been
watching the scoreboard cheered
right away.
