# LATE-NIGHT COMEBACK FUELS VICTORY
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It tcx>k the Cardinal 11 innings, but they
finally toppled the University of San Fran
cisco in a wild finish last night. 11-10.
The game was largely a story of the Car
dinal pitching staffs struggles before a pair
of lefties, freshman Michael De Groot and
junior Blake Hancock, shut down the
Dons (21-15) over the final 4.1 innings of
play. The two allowed just five base-run
ners between them. Stanford (19-11-1,6-3
Pac-10) was able to ride that wave of solid
pitching to hold USF at 10 runs from the
eighth inning on. while the team scored
five runs over that span.
"De Groot did an outstanding job,"
junior Brent Milleville said."This was only
his second outing of the year, and he only
pitched to one other guy before that —
and he did a great job there, he struck the
guy out — but coming into a game like
this and to pitch like that when you
haven't had much experience, that's an
outstanding job."
Down three entering the bottom of the
ninth. Stanford needed a big rally to stay
alive, and got it as senior Brendan Do
maracki.junior Jason Castro and Milleville
hit successive one-out singles, scoring a run
and putting runners at the corners.
Junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff followed
with a groundball to second that initially
looked like it could be a double play. But
Ratliff beat the throw to first to keep the in
ning alive and allow another run to score.
Sophomore Wande Olabisi. running for
Ratliff,stole second and scored on a Randy
Molina single through the right side to tie
the game.
Stanford would go on to win it in the
11th, as a pair of walks put Castro and Do
maracki on first and second respectively

GAME NOTES: No. 10 Stanford scored three runs
in the bottom of the 9th and scored in the 11 th to
beat the University of San Francisco last night.
Stanford used a total of eight pitchers in the ball
gome. The Cardinal was led by junior Brent
Milleville, who was 4-6 with a homerun and two
runs scored, and also had the game winning hit
and RBI.
Milleville followed with a long single to
deep left field that looked as if it was going
to leave the yard.The ball stayed inside the
park, but Domaracki had plenty of time to
score from second and end the game.
"I thought 1 hit it pretty well and it
looked like it was going pretty high,"
Milleville said of his game-winning hit.
"But Sunken Diamond at night.itsa tough
place to hit a ball out of. It landed and we
won the game so it's not a big deal at all."
After USF's two runs in the top of the
fifth, Milleville hit a solo shot to left center
in the bottom half of the inning to briefly
put the Cardinal on top, 6-5. But the Dons
came right back in the top of the sixth with
a run of their own. and seemed to blow the
game open with four runs in the seventh.
Stanford needed four pitchers to get
through the inning.
ITie Cardinal was able to hold the Dons


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Junior Sean Ratliff and the Stanford baseball team scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth last night to force extra innings, where they defeated the
University of San Francisco in the bottom of the 1 Ith. Stanford returns to Pac-10 play this weekend when they travel to UCLA Friday thru Sunday.
for the rest of the game, setting up the
eventual victory.
The win was key for Stanford — it
was the team's fourth in a row and its
second this week.
While the Cardinal has dominated
weekend games all season, Monday-
Friday has been another matter alto
gether. With a pair of wins this week,
however, there is hope that the team
may be turning the comer.
"[Midweek and Friday games
have] definitely been our downfall so
far this year," Milleville said. "We're
playing five games a week, so it's tough
to come out and play every day to the
best of your abilities and to go out
there and give the same effort as you
do in a weekend series.
"But 1 think that we're starting to
figure it out, and everyone's figuring
out what kind of effort they need to
put into it every day. 1 think we're all
just aspiring to play a little bit better
than we have."
Next up for the Cardinal is a week
end series at UCLA beginning Friday
night at 6 p.m.
