## Student develops program for free online course materials 
### MELODY DYE STAFF WRITER 
Over the last decade, several elite aca
demic institutions — most notably the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology —
have leveraged new technology to make
course materials widely available online at
no cost to the public. While some Stanford
students have vocally supported this bur
geoning "freedom of education" move
ment, the University has yet to mirror
MlT's approach. This may soon change.
Stanford computer science student
Klaus Ganser '09 developed a basic proto
type of Stanford OpenCourseWare
(OCW) last spring. The program would
make current offerings on Coursework
and the Stanford Center for Professional
Development (SCPD) publicly accessible
through a centralized Web site.
The proposed site would follow a non
profit model, with all materials — video,
audio and print — available for free.
Course materials would be distributed as

protected intellectual property under a
Creative Commons license. Such licenses
are less stringent than standard copyright
protection, minimizing certain legal
restrictions and expanding accessibility.
Ganser recommended a license that
would make course content free to share
and adapt, but only for non-commercial
purposes and only if it were attributed to
its source.
Ganser's prototype is modeled after
MlT's OpenCourseWare initiative, which
makes syllabi, lecture notes and a growing
collection of video lectures from over
1,800 courses freely available online.
MlT's site, originally designed to share
innovative teaching methods with fellow
educators, now receives over 1.5 million
hits a month. While approximately half of
visitors are educators or students, the
other half are self-learners with no univer
sity affiliation.
Within the past several years, fourteen
American schools have joined the
OpenCourseWare consortium, including

John Hopkins, Notre Dame and Tufts. I
In the past two months. Harvard has 1
moved to publish all of its faculty 1
research for free online, while UC- 1
Berkeley has launched webcast.berke
ley.edu, offering podcasts of 50 of its
courses.

Stanford currently offers a little
over a dozen full-length audio
courses for free download througl

"lTunes U," a branch of Apple's popular
downloading service that hosts digital con
tent from colleges and universities. A
Stanford You Tube channel distributing
select video content will launch in the
coming months.
While these offerings are limited, the
University has convened a task force, the
Stanford Open Education Initiative
(SOEI),to explore the possibility of signif
icantly expanding content and accessibility
in the near future.
"[SOEI has been] researching the
range of options," said Scott Stocker, direc
tor of Stanford Web Communications,

ing "joining the

building a site similar to the Yale Open
Courses site, or attempting to create a
unique Stanford offering."
At stake in this effort are issues both of
intellectual property right and of prestige.
Some critics believe the OpenCourseWare
movement will undercut the value of uni-
