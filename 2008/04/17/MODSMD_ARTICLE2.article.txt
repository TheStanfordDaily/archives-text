## Student develops program for free online course materials 
### MELODY DYE STAFF WRITER 
Over the last decade, several elite aca
demic institutions — most notably the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology —
have leveraged new technology to make
course materials widely available online at
no cost to the public. While some Stanford
students have vocally supported this bur
geoning "freedom of education" move
ment, the University has yet to mirror
MlT's approach. This may soon change.
Stanford computer science student
Klaus Ganser '09 developed a basic proto
type of Stanford OpenCourseWare
(OCW) last spring. The program would
make current offerings on Coursework
and the Stanford Center for Professional
Development (SCPD) publicly accessible
through a centralized Web site.
The proposed site would follow a non
profit model, with all materials — video,
audio and print — available for free.
Course materials would be distributed as

protected intellectual property under a
Creative Commons license. Such licenses
are less stringent than standard copyright
protection, minimizing certain legal
restrictions and expanding accessibility.
Ganser recommended a license that
would make course content free to share
and adapt, but only for non-commercial
purposes and only if it were attributed to
its source.
Ganser's prototype is modeled after
MlT's OpenCourseWare initiative, which
makes syllabi, lecture notes and a growing
collection of video lectures from over
1,800 courses freely available online.
MlT's site, originally designed to share
innovative teaching methods with fellow
educators, now receives over 1.5 million
hits a month. While approximately half of
visitors are educators or students, the
other half are self-learners with no univer
sity affiliation.
Within the past several years, fourteen
American schools have joined the
OpenCourseWare consortium, including

John Hopkins, Notre Dame and Tufts. I
In the past two months. Harvard has 1
moved to publish all of its faculty 1
research for free online, while UC- 1
Berkeley has launched webcast.berke
ley.edu, offering podcasts of 50 of its
courses.

Stanford currently offers a little
over a dozen full-length audio
courses for free download througl

"lTunes U," a branch of Apple's popular
downloading service that hosts digital con
tent from colleges and universities. A
Stanford You Tube channel distributing
select video content will launch in the
coming months.
While these offerings are limited, the
University has convened a task force, the
Stanford Open Education Initiative
(SOEI),to explore the possibility of signif
icantly expanding content and accessibility
in the near future.
"[SOEI has been] researching the
range of options," said Scott Stocker, direc
tor of Stanford Web Communications,

includ
ing "joining the

OpenCourseWare Consortium,
building a site similar to the Yale Open
Courses site, or attempting to create a
unique Stanford offering."
At stake in this effort are issues both of
intellectual property right and of prestige.
Some critics believe the OpenCourseWare
movement will undercut the value of uni-

versity degrees and lead to perva
sive intellectual plagiarism.
Accessibility, they warn, may come
at a steep price.
Supporters counter that accessi
bility will promote collaboration
between academics and advance
democratic ends. They argue that
sharing university resources is not
the same, or even similar, to handing
out credentials.
These arguments are complicat
ed by the prickly legal issues that
surround copyright protection and
infringement, and the growing ques
tion of how to license intellectual
property in a digital age.
All course content currently
available through Coursework and
SCPD is protected under copyright
law and the TEACH Act, which
extends fair use rights to students in
a digital classroom. The SCPD, an
adjunct to the School of
Engineering, offers over 250 video
taped courses online, but at a cost of
more than $1,200 per unit.
Coursework. which features course
materials for hundreds of Stanford
classes, is accessible only to enrolled
Stanford students and faculty.
While Coursework administra
tors had no comment on expansion
plans, a spokesman for SCPD said
that the center has no immediate
plans to offer anything on par with
MIT. Paul Marca, SCPD's long-time
deputy director, said the center has
not yet developed a revenue model
to support the kind of long-term
investment OCW would require,
though he hopes to offer open con
tent on a smaller scale in the future.
Lindell Lucy '06, a strong sup
porter of the OpenCourseWare
movement, dismissed Marca s com
ments, saying SCPD's interests have
been "heavily influenced by
money."
Lucy began publicly champi
oning the freedom of education
movement last year, petitioning
President John Hennessy and oth

ers in the administration to make
Stanford's "world-class education"
freely available to the public online.
After months of letter-writing, he
brought his case to Facebook,
authoring a series of provocative
notes on the issue that drew dozens
of comments from supporters.
While Lucy has outlined a plan
for filming and distributing lectures
with an eye toward minimizing
costs, a number of legal issues
remain for the University.
The costs of packaging, housing
and distributing online content
aside, the University would also be
faced with securing copyright
releases for all materials faculty
might use in the classroom — a time
intensive and costly effort.
Marca estimated that at one
point MIT had twenty staff mem
bers employed full-time securing
releases, one of the reasons, he said,
that MIT has since "largely aban
doned" online video. By MIT esti
mates, he said. OCW has a sticker
price of $20,000 per course, much of
that coming from the university's
budget and endowment.
"How much money do we have
to make and on what margin to
recover that cost?" Marca asked.
Marca said that if the University
were to develop OpenCourseWare
along the lines of MIT, it should
look to develop a program that is
both high in quality and self-sustain
ing. To develop such a model, he
said, Stanford would need to find a
productive way to manage these
copyright issues, either by challeng
ing faculty to develop and make
available their own materials or by
hiring staffers to edit publicly dis
tributable content.
These suggestions may prove
useful to SOEI as the advisory
council prepares its recommenda
tions for the future of
OpenCourseWare at Stanford.
While Stocker said that "no deci
sions have been made yet," SOEI
will be making a formal proposal to
Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 this summer.
