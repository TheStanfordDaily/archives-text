## Grad vote spikes in recent ASSU election Graduate turnout up 19 parent from last year 
### CARLEE BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Voter turnout in ASSU elections
increased by 19 percent among
graduate students this year, reported
Assistant Elections Commissioner
for Graduate Elections Ivette Estay
at last night's Graduate Student
Council meeting.
Though the total of 2.675 voters
fell short of the goal of 3,000, this
rise came in a year of decreased
voter participation among under
graduates in the ASSU elections.
GSC co-chair George Bloom indi
cated that a great deal of credit
belonged to Estay and her role in
the newly-created office of Assistant
Elections Commissioner.
"It's a huge difference," Bloom
said. "We really would like the grad
uate voting percentage to reach over
50 percent." he added, which they
expect to achieve if they increase by
another 19 percent next year.
In her role as Assistant Elections
Commissioner, Estay set up infor
mation sessions, organized meet
and-greet dinners and advertised on
Facebook. She indicated that she
had ideas for next year and
expressed interest in serving as
Assistant Commissioner again.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Ryan Woessner '10 also presented the
results of the election for certification,
which were approved by consensus.
The newly-elected GSC district
winners are Polina A. Segalova.
Melahn Parker, Fen Zhao, Sean
Young, Michelle Brown. Andrew
Park. George Bloom. Kick Thielke.
Hanna Muenke, Justin Brown,
Karan Chaudhry, Addy Satija,
Aleksandra Korolova, Adam Lee

Beberg, and Nanna Notthoff.
Council member-elect Addy
Satija, a first year graduate student
in Electrical Engineering, attended
the meeting and actively participat
ed in discussion.
"I'm learning how this organiza
tion works," said Satija. "1 think I'd
like to work with funding and inter
national issues, but my primary goal
now is to understand."
The incoming council members
will be sworn in on April 30, after
two more meetings with the current
council members at the helm.
New officers for the GSC will
also be chosen at that time. The co
chairs and the financial officer will
be chosen from the new voting
members of the council, though
committee chairs are open to all in
the graduate community.
In addition to approving the
council-member election results, the
GSC also certified the results of
Measure A, a proposal on the grad
uate ballot for the GO Pass. If it had
been approved, the GO Pass would
have subsidized Caltrain passes for
off-campus graduate students, pro
viding unlimited access. But the $100
price tag that would have been
passed along to every graduate stu
dent kept the measure from passing.
"People either use the Caltrain a
lot or don't use it at all." Bloom said,
maintaining that there were not
enough graduate students that do
use the local commuter train to gar
ner support.
"Hopefully, we can find other
solutions and other ways to work
with Parking and Transportation
Services to find something beneficial
to the majority of graduate stu
dents," Bloom continued, adding
that the GSC might try to get a spe
cial Caltrrain rate for Stanford grad
uate students.
