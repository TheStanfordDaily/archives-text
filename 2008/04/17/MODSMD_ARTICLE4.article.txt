## Women's health program tackles female sexual issues 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Women's sexual dysfunctions are get
ting their day in the sun, thanks to the
newly developed Female Sexual Medicine
Program at Stanford Hospital & Clinics.
"It's such a needed area that had been
ignored for so long," said Leah Millheiser,
M.D.. an instructor in obstetrics and gyne
cology at the School of Medicine, the
founder and director of the program.
About 43 percent of women aged 18 to
49 suffer from sexual dysfunction, accord
ing to Millheiser. In women, sexual dys
function is classified by four disorders: lack
of sexual desire or low libido, the inability
to become aroused, inability to achieve
orgasm and painful intercourse. Her

patients are referred from other physicians
or come to the Female Sexual Medicine
Program after learning about it on their
own. The clinic welcomes patients of all
ages.
"I see women as young as 16 to 17, and
I even had a woman in her 90s come to see
me." Millheiser said. She said she also sees
many college-aged women.
"The majority of complaints I see in the
younger women are ftnv desire and sexual
pain," Millheiser explained.
She said low desire is often due to work
stress, school stress or relationship issues.
Sexual pain has many causes, including
vaginal irritation and dryness some women
experience while taking the birth control
pill. Millheiser said another problem young
women can experience is vaginismus.

which is an involuntary spasm of a
woman's pelvic floor muscles that makes it
very difficult and painful to achieve vaginal
penetration.
Millheiser stressed that there is help for
women with sexual dysfunctions.
"If women have one, they think,' Oh. I'll
just suffer through it."' she said. "But they
don't need to."
In addition to affecting a person's rela
tionships and quality of life, sexual dys
function can signal a serious underlying
disease.
"Neurological disorders, diabetes and
heart disease can all have their first mani
festation as a sexual symptom," Millheiser
said. "It's very important [for doctors] to
always ask patients about it."
Millheiser said that studying female

sexual dysfunction from a biological per
spective had a surprising start: the erectile
dysfunction drug Viagra.
"It was Viagra in men that opened the
door for us to learn more about the way
women work sexually," she said. "Up until
1998, we were looking at female sexual
dysfunction as a psychological problem.
But if there's a physical problem in men,
why wouldn't the same go for women?"
The discovery resulted in a major shift
in thinking for medical professionals,
according to Millheiser.
"Everybody was like, 'Wait a minute,
we've got this all wrong,"' she said.
The ensuing flurry of research brought
many new discoveries about women's sex-
