## Women's health program tackles female sexual issues 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Women's sexual dysfunctions are get
ting their day in the sun, thanks to the
newly developed Female Sexual Medicine
Program at Stanford Hospital & Clinics.
"It's such a needed area that had been
ignored for so long," said Leah Millheiser,
M.D.. an instructor in obstetrics and gyne
cology at the School of Medicine, the
founder and director of the program.
About 43 percent of women aged 18 to
49 suffer from sexual dysfunction, accord
ing to Millheiser. In women, sexual dys
function is classified by four disorders: lack
of sexual desire or low libido, the inability
to become aroused, inability to achieve
orgasm and painful intercourse. Her

patients are referred from other physicians
or come to the Female Sexual Medicine
Program after learning about it on their
own. The clinic welcomes patients of all
ages.
"I see women as young as 16 to 17, and
I even had a woman in her 90s come to see
me." Millheiser said. She said she also sees
many college-aged women.
"The majority of complaints I see in the
younger women are ftnv desire and sexual
pain," Millheiser explained.
She said low desire is often due to work
stress, school stress or relationship issues.
Sexual pain has many causes, including
vaginal irritation and dryness some women
experience while taking the birth control
pill. Millheiser said another problem young
women can experience is vaginismus.

which is an involuntary spasm of a
woman's pelvic floor muscles that makes it
very difficult and painful to achieve vaginal
penetration.
Millheiser stressed that there is help for
women with sexual dysfunctions.
"If women have one, they think,' Oh. I'll
just suffer through it."' she said. "But they
don't need to."
In addition to affecting a person's rela
tionships and quality of life, sexual dys
function can signal a serious underlying
disease.
"Neurological disorders, diabetes and
heart disease can all have their first mani
festation as a sexual symptom," Millheiser
said. "It's very important [for doctors] to
always ask patients about it."
Millheiser said that studying female

sexual dysfunction from a biological per
spective had a surprising start: the erectile
dysfunction drug Viagra.
"It was Viagra in men that opened the
door for us to learn more about the way
women work sexually," she said. "Up until
1998, we were looking at female sexual
dysfunction as a psychological problem.
But if there's a physical problem in men,
why wouldn't the same go for women?"
The discovery resulted in a major shift
in thinking for medical professionals,
according to Millheiser.
"Everybody was like, 'Wait a minute,
we've got this all wrong,"' she said.
The ensuing flurry of research brought
many new discoveries about women's sex-
ual response. The human sexual
response cycle, as medical textbooks
describe it, is a four-stage model that
includes excitement, plateau,
orgasm and resolution. Millheiser
said some medical professionals rec
ommend making a new sexual
response model for women, in which
the orgasmic phase is removed alto
gether.
"Men looked shocked when we
say this, but women don't necessari
ly need an orgasm to be sexually sat
isfied," Millheiser said.
While women can be frustrated if
they want to have an orgasm but are
unable to. many women can enjoy
themselves just as much in a sexual
situation without having an orgasm.
Their partners may not under
stand this, and "women end up fak
ing a lot more orgasms than they
need to," according to Millheiser.
Another difference between men
and women manifests itself in their
reasons for having sex.
Men are often motivated by a
spontaneous desire for sex, or
thoughts and fantasies about sex,
but women are more complicated,
said Millheiser.

"Women have many reasons for
initiating or agreeing to sex with
their partners," she said. For exam
ple, a woman may want to please her
partner, or she may know that even
if she's not in the mood for sex at the
time, she'll begin to enjoy herself as
the act progresses.
Millheiser said it took effort on
her part to get Stanford's medical
center to recognize sexual medicine
as an important part of women's
health. She said she was never
trained in sexual medicine during
medical school, and the training she
did get was mostly about male sexu
ality. When she began her residency,
she was unprepared to deal with
women's questions about their sexu
al health.
"I felt like I didn't have the train
ing to help them," she said.
Millheiser got a National
Institutes of Health (Nil!) grant to
study female sexual dysfunction, and
she began researching the subject.
She hasn't looked back since.
"This was my calling," she said.
"It's overwhelming the positive
response and feedback we've
received from the community and
other medical practitioners in the
area. I think the patients really
appreciate it."
