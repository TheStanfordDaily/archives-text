## File-sharing provision criticized University questions merits of House bill on illegal file-sharing 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
In the wake of a recent wave of file-sharing
lawsuits against Stanford students. Congress is
now close to accepting provisions to its educa
tion funding bill which would require universi
ties to dramatically step up anti-piracy meas
ures.
The College Affordability and Opportunity
Act. which passed easily through the House of
Representatives last month, included provisions
which would require universities "to develop
plans to provide alternative music and movie
services and implement technological measures
to deter illegal file sharing."
In November, when a Senate version of the
bill would have made compliance with the file
sharing provision a requirement for federal
financial aid eligibility, Stanford President John
Hennessy joined about a dozen other represen
tatives on behalf of higher education in urging
congressional leaders to reject the bill. Now, the
I louse version of the bill excludes the provision
on file-sharing entirely, and Congress will have
to reach a compromise regarding whether to
hold onto the provision.
According to Lauren Schoenthaler, Staff
Counsel of the Office of the General Counsel,
while Stanford does not condone illegal file
sharing, requiring universities to use technolog
ical means to stop illegal file-sharing could
intrude t>n academic processes.
"The House version that was just
passed still includes a requirement
that universities consider technolo
gy-based deterrents to combat file
sharing," Schoenthaler wrote in an
email to The Daily. "While we at
Stanford already use technology in
our efforts to combat unlawful file
sharing in our Peer-to-Peer
Advisory program, we are not con
vinced that the commercial soft
ware applications to stop file-shar
ing are completely effective, nor are
those software applications able to
distinguish between lawful and
unlawful file-sharing."
In January, 15 Stanford students
were served pre-litigation notices
from legal representatives of the
Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA) demanding they
pay settlement fines of approxi
mately $3,000 for illegally down
loading music.The RIAA. as well as

the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA), have lobbied
Congress in support of the file-shar
ing provisions of the bill.
According to Paul Keser,
Information Services Specialist
with the Information Security
Office (ISO), Stanford currently
does not filter through Internet
traffic in an effort to block illegal
file-sharing. To do so, he said, would
require either monitoring content
or blocking all file-sharing, legal or
illegal. He claimed the recording
and motion picture industries rec
ommend technologies which block
legal file-sharing as well as illegal.
"All person-to-person file-shar
ing is blocked unless you white-list
known legal content," Keser said
concerning the industry-recom
mended software. "That seems to
be where the recording industry
wants to go."
ISO Information Systems
Specialist David Hoffman stated
that, with regard to Stanford illegal
file-sharing, the University has no
technological means by which to
measure how widespread it is on

campus.
"We really have no way to tell,"
Hoffman said in an email to The
Daily. "We can measure the amount
of traffic, but there's no way to
know what's legal and what's not
without having someone pry into
the contents, and we don't do that.
The only indication we have of ille
gal activity is the DMCA complaints
we get from copyright holders."
The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) is the prin
cipal means by which the recording
industry files lawsuits against
accused illegal file-sharers. At
Stanford, as with most universities,
the DMCA is the first step by which
the industry alerts schools that a
student is engaging in illegal file
sharing.
"Unfortunately, DMCA com
plaints come in against students
almost
every day," said Schoenthaler. "1
estimate that Stanford students
have collectively paid over $100,000
to settle their unlawful file-sharing
claims with recording artists. I'm
not convinced that the proposed

legislation would have any impact
on the number of demands the
record companies are bringing."
Over the next few months,
Congress will attempt to reconcile
the House and Senate versions of
the bill, during which time they will
decide whether to include the pro
visions on file-sharing. If the provi
sions pass and the bill is interpreted
to require colleges to adopt tech
nologies to deter illegal file-sharing,
Keser said that Stanford would be
in danger of losing its current "free
harbor" Internet provider status,
through which the school responds
to complaints but does not monitor
content. In his opinion, this provi
sion constitutes a severe imposition
on universities.
"It looks like the recording
industry is trying to force this on the
University...and to try to make the
University liable," Keser said. "If
you wanted to share files, if it wasn't
for the legal aspects, we wouldn't
care."
