## File-sharing provision criticized University questions merits of House bill on illegal file-sharing 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
In the wake of a recent wave of file-sharing
lawsuits against Stanford students. Congress is
now close to accepting provisions to its educa
tion funding bill which would require universi
ties to dramatically step up anti-piracy meas
ures.
The College Affordability and Opportunity
Act. which passed easily through the House of
Representatives last month, included provisions
which would require universities "to develop
plans to provide alternative music and movie
services and implement technological measures
to deter illegal file sharing."
In November, when a Senate version of the
bill would have made compliance with the file
sharing provision a requirement for federal
financial aid eligibility, Stanford President John
Hennessy joined about a dozen other represen
tatives on behalf of higher education in urging
congressional leaders to reject the bill. Now, the
I louse version of the bill excludes the provision
on file-sharing entirely, and Congress will have
to reach a compromise regarding whether to
hold onto the provision.
According to Lauren Schoenthaler, Staff
Counsel of the Office of the General Counsel,
while Stanford does not condone illegal file
sharing, requiring universities to use technolog
ical means to stop illegal file-sharing could
intrude t>n academic processes.
