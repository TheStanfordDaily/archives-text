# FACULTY & STAFF
## Assistant coaches to get new housing Twenty-two new rental units planned to ease housing costs 
### NIKHIL KAMAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Assistant coaches will soon have a signifi
cant financial burden lifted off their shoulders
with the construction of new faculty rental
housing meant specifically for them.
The units, which will be built adjacent to the
College Terrace neighborhood off of El
Camino Real, will be constructed using money
from an anonymous donor who hopes to make
Stanford more appealing to coaching staff.
"Stanford University is located in an area
where the cost of living is greater than many . .
. important staff can afford," Robert Reidy,
vice president for Land Buildings and Real
Estate, wrote in an email to The Daily. "In this
case, we are fortunate to have a donor who is
willing to contribute to the project, which we
ultimately believe will assist us in retaining
staff, like coaches."
Stanford has already spent millions in pro
viding housing to coaching staff within proxim
ity to campus. With the median home sale price
in Palo Alto at $ 1.3 million. Stanford hopes this
new housing will significantly offset Stanford's
current burden of housing faculty close to cam
pus.
According to University Architect David
Lenox, the site will contain 22 free-standing
rental units along with adequate resident and
guest parking. Lenox said the
architecture will blend local archi
tectural styles with already estab
lished campus themes.
"The aesthetic and distinctive
styles for the housing units will be
derived from the contextual fea
tures and scale of the homes in
College Terrace and the material
palette of Escondido Village
Housing," Lennox wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Reidy added that three local

architectural styles — Bay Area
Bungalow, California Craftsman
and Historical Californian — will
be particularly prominent.
According to Reidy, a large
amount of planning has gone into
the placement of these homes,
which vary in size from 1.550 to
1,880 gross square feet. The houses
will be kept in close proximity with
approximately seven homes per
acre over a total area of three acres.
Proper landscaping is seen as
integral in maintaining the aesthet
ic of the new complex.
"We believe that preserving as
many of the mature trees as possi
ble will be helpful," Reidy said.
"The trick will be to insert these

homes into the site and have the
resulting development feel and
look as it is intended — timeless."
Reidy said that the rental cost
of the housing units has not been
established and will not be avail
able until the project nears com
pletion. Lenox added that the
rental price will be determined by
the total construction cost. These
costs may vary with the steadily
increasing price of construction
materials.
Reidy and Lenox anticipate
construction to be completed in
2009.
