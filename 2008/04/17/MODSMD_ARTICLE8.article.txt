### JAIWONRHI 
Early retirement may sound like an unattainable
paradise — one reserved for start-up CEOs who
strike it rich — but according to Monte Malhotra
'10, author of "The Young Investor's Guide to Re
tiring Young" it's a daydream within our grasp.
Features presents his tips on personal finance and invest
ment.

STEP 1: ESSENTIALS
Determine when you need your money.
If you don't need money for
6 months Consider short-term bonds, certificates
of deposit i
Longer term Consider: an Individual Retirement Ac- \
count (IRA), mutual funds \
People often leave their money in a savings or checking |
account, which offer, at most, 1% interest. Putting "
money into bonds — albeit a slightly riskier investment t
— may give you roughly 4% more interest. 112

1) START EARLY I
Let's say the interest rate is 10.6% (which is possible, if I
quite challenging). If you put away $4,000 after gradua- (
tion, you'll get $70,000 by the time you're 50. If, howev- 1
er, you had put that money into an account as a fresh
man, you would've accumulated $ 100,000 by that age. I
2) PRIORITIZE
Decide how soon you need money and then make fi- 1
nancial decisions accordingly.
Bankrate.com: Search for accounts that suit your de
mands. This website offers information on certificates of
deposit (CD) rates for all banks across the nation. A cer
tificate of deposit is like a savings account that lasts for a
specific amount of time. After this time has passed, the
money may be withdrawn, along with the interest it has
gathered.
3) KEEP TRACK OF SMALL EXPENSES.
Small indulgences add up. Each year, the average stu
dent spends between $ 1 (XK) and $2(KK) on snacks, coffee,
and other personal items. It's difficult to recognize the
ramifications of these small-ticket expenses, but every
dollar we spend now is a lost opportunity for more
money down the road.
4) CHOOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD REWARD
PROGRAM WISELY.
An option like "3% cash back on convenience store
purchases" is a lot better than earning points you'll
never use. Consider what options will benefit you the
most according to your purchase trends.

5) BE COGNIZANT OF CREDIT
CARD DEBT.

In a study at MIT, two groups of stu
dents were told to bid for tickets to a
basketball game. One group was
given credit cards; the other had
only cash. The study revealed that
the group who used credit cards
bid twice as high as the others.

If used responsibly,credit cards are a great tool, but you
don't want to end up paying debt back continuously.
6) USE YOUR SURROUNDINGS TO FIND
GOOD INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
Be aware of what is going on in the world — especially
at Stanford and in Silicon Valley.Try to identify industry
trends and potential growth areas; this is knowledge you
can put to use in the stock market.
STEP II: BASICS
A bit more serious about investment? Open up an account and
Invest in mutual funds. A mutual fund Is a basket of stocks man
aged by a professional.
Since the market may be headed toward a recession, this is a
good entry point for young investors who will be investing for
decades. This may create opportunities to purchase stocks or
funds for a good price.
Unfortunately, many of us don't have much time to follow stocks.
Try out Morningstar, which rates mutual funds from 1 to 5 stars,
to see which funds have performed well in the past. Look to see
how long the managers have been running the funds and how
much money they put in their own — a good indicator of their
level of confidence.
