A gang of women known as the
Raging Grannies greeted attendees
at Thursday's Federal
Communications Committee (FCC)
hearing on net neutrality held by
Stanford Law School at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The grannies sung "We
Need Internet Freedom" set to the
tune of "God Bless America" to
members entering the auditorium.
The hearing came about because

that allows its users to exchange
content such as music and video. A

need to attend another hearing.
"(Comcast has] already appeared
before the Commission on network
management issues and has made
extensive filings at the FCC both on
our past and current practices as
well as our recent announcements."
said a Comcast spokeswoman in a
statement released by the provider.
"We felt issues specific to us were
well covered at the first hearing and
the focus of this event should be
broader than any individual compa
ny's issues."
While Comcast declined the FCC
invite, AT&T, Verizon and Time
Warner Cable also turned down
invitations. Free Press, an advocacy
group that promotes diversity in
media, has made allegations that
Verizon has been caught blocking
text messages and that AT&T
reportedly wants to inspect and fil
