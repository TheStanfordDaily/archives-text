## Comcast refuses invite Major service providers absent from hearing 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A gang of women known as the
Raging Grannies greeted attendees
at Thursday's Federal
Communications Committee (FCC)
hearing on net neutrality held by
Stanford Law School at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The grannies sung "We
Need Internet Freedom" set to the
tune of "God Bless America" to
members entering the auditorium.
The hearing came about because
of Bit Torrent, peer-to-peer software
that allows its users to exchange
content such as music and video. A
peer-to-peer network is a decentral
ized network in which users are
directly connected to other users'
computers. These networks, such as
Bit Torrent allow file sharing, while
others, such as Skype allow people
to speak to each other over the
Internet for free.
Comcast was recently caught
restricting customer access to
Bit Torrent traffic but argued that it
should have the ability to control its
network under "reasonable network
management" practices in order to
avoid the network becoming con
gested and thus slowing down the
Internet for all the company's users.
Comcast officials, however, as
well as representatives from the
other broadband giants, were not
present at the hearing. FCC
Chairman Kevin Martin said that
Comcast and other broadband
providers had been invited to testify
but chose not to attend.
"I do wish there were some net
work operators here to answer ques
tions." Commissioner Robert
McDowell said. "I am very disap
pointed that they aren't here."
In a public statement on
Thursday. Comcast said that it had
appeared at the previous commis
sion hearing at Harvard and felt no
need to attend another hearing.
"(Comcast has] already appeared
before the Commission on network
management issues and has made
extensive filings at the FCC both on
our past and current practices as
well as our recent announcements."
said a Comcast spokeswoman in a
statement released by the provider.
"We felt issues specific to us were
well covered at the first hearing and
the focus of this event should be
broader than any individual compa
ny's issues."
While Comcast declined the FCC
invite, AT&T, Verizon and Time
Warner Cable also turned down
invitations. Free Press, an advocacy
group that promotes diversity in
media, has made allegations that
Verizon has been caught blocking
text messages and that AT&T
reportedly wants to inspect and fil
ter Web traffic.
Comcast worked to prove that it
did not wish to restrict access to any
particular application by striking a
deal with Bit Torrent last month.
Under the deal, Comcast said it
would attempt to change its net
work management practices on its
network to analyze data in a "proto
col agnostic" way. Comcast publicly
admitted to "delaying" uploads to
the Bit Torrent protocol at peak
congestion times, but under the new
practice, Comcast would likely man
age traffic according to how much
bandwidth consumers use, rather
than what sort of applications
they're running.
Bit Torrent Chief Technology
Officer Eric Klinker said in a state
ment that the initiative was to
develop "techniques that the
Internet community will find to be
more transparent."
But Robb Topolski, the software
quality engineer who first discov

ered Comcast's blocking methods
did not see the benefits of the agree
ment with Bit Torrent.
"The situation continues today,"
he said at the hearing. "It has not
stopped, despite all the wonderful
agreements between Bit Torrent and
Comcast. I'm a ham radio operator.
And Comcast is jamming author
ized communication [on the
Internet], I ask that before you (the
FCC] leave today you signal your
intent to stop these interferences."
Comcast's absence at Thursday's
hearing was certainly felt. George
Ou, an independent consultant and
former network engineer, was
nptably alone in his support of
Comcast's and other ISPs' abilities
to throttle traffic. He argued that
ISPs should have the right to defend
themselves against the peer-to-peer
networks which consume the major
ity of the traffic on the Internet.
"Video is causing a new collapse
[of the Internet]. It requires a 100-
to 1000-fold increase in capacity to
deal with current crisis."
Ou referred to traffic figures
from Japan — where there are larg
er bandwidths — which showed
that 1 percent of Japan's Internet
users comprised 47 percent of the
data traffic. He pointed out that
since 90 percent of the population
was only left with 25 percent of the
Internet capacity, network traffic
management was vital to the
Internet. He argued that without
better restrictions, the Internet was
highly unfair.
"It is a common misconception
that more bandwidth solves all
problems," he said.
