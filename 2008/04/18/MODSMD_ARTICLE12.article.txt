# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students remember Virginia Tech victims One year later, students call for tougher gun laws 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
One day after the first anniversary of
the Virginia Teeh school shootings, an
anti-gun rally staged in White Plaza
dueled for attention with idyllic weather,
rap music and a host of event promo
tions.
"It's time to make sure that our voic
es are not silenced by the blast of a gun
barrel," said Theo Milonopoulos '09, also
an editor at The Daily, in a speech during
Thursday's rally.
Milonopoulos and his twin brother
Niko '09, who jointly organized the
event, decried what they saw as a lack of
meaningful federal firearms regulation
and called for observers to "pressure
your elected officials to have the courage
to keep us safe."
On Apr. 16, 2007, 23-year-old under
graduate Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 other
students and himself at Virginia Tech in
the deadliest school shooting in U.S. his
tory. On Feb. 14 of this year, a former
graduate student at Northern Illinois
University killed five students and him
self in another school shooting.
Stanford is currently in the process of
initiating an emergency mass notification
system to be used in campus-wide emer
gencies, such as a shooting. The system
will alert students and University staff to
potential dangers via simultaneous
emails, text and phone messages. Since
yesterday, Axess users have been
required to update or verify their phone
numbers and provide an emergency con
tact in order to log in.
In the Virginia Tech shootings of one
year ago, roughly two hours elapsed
between Cho's initial murder of two stu
dents in a dormitory and his subsequent
violent rampage in a separate academic
building. Though police, emergency med
ical services and the administration had
been notified of the incident, students
and staff were not alerted prior to the
second set of killings.
At yesterday's rally, about 20 students
wearing commemorative orange and red
ribbons around their necks gathered in

front of the Birdcage in White Plaza dur
ing the lunch hour. Many were dressed in
black. A brief speech by Theo
Milonopoulos riddled with statistics on
gun violence among youth opened the
rally.
The gun-control advocates were not
the only ones occupying White Plaza. At
a booth next to the Birdcage, girls
dressed in white tennis skirts and large
framed. black designer sunglasses raised
funds for this year's Senior Gift, turning
their backs and chatting as the rally car
ried on. Rap music blasted from a booth
selling tickets to an upcoming show for
DVB, a student hip-hop dance group.
The Stanford Savoyards, a student
drama troupe, sold tickets to their pro
duction of Gilbert & Sullivan's "Yeoman
of the Guard" at an adjacent table. A

promoter repeatedly shouted.
"Execution tomorrow night!" until just
before the rally's 12:45 p.m. start.
ITie rally proceeded under a large
banner advertising los Hermanos de
Stanford's "Club Caliente" party.
After his speech, Milonopoulos read
the names of the 32 victims of the
Virginia Tech shootings. Rally partici
pants symbolically lay on the ground in
front of the Birdcage during the name
readings.
Niko Milonopoulos concluded the
event by recounting the story of Jamiel
Shaw, a 17 year-old Stanford football
recruit killed last month in a gang-relat
ed shooting in Los Angeles.
The brothers organized the rally with
support from the Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP),

a campys group promoting social change
through dramatic performance.
In 1998, Theo and Niko
Milonopoulos, then 11 years-old, found
ed an anti-gun-violence youth advocacy
group, kidz Voice-LA, in response to ris
ing levels of gun-violence in their North
Hollywood community. In 2006. the two
founded Vox Populi, an advocacy group
with similar aims.
Asked about the University's newly
initiated emergency notification system,
Milonopoulos suggested. "It can help
prevent deaths from occurring when the
situation is at its most immediate," but
stressed the necessity of legislative
reform in reducing gun-violence.
