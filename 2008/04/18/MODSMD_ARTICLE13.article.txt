## Senate hears undergrad, grad financial concerns 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Graduate and undergraduate
student representatives laid out con
cerns over rising costs at a sparsely
attended meeting of the Faculty
Senate Thursday afternoon.
Graduate Student Council repre
sentative Adam Beberg described a
large discrepancy between the mini
mum graduate student stipend and
the cost of living at Stanford.
According to University financial
aid statistics, he said, the average
monthly cost of living is $2,735.
Because graduate student stipends
are taxed, the gross income required
to meet this standard is about
$3,100. Beberg told faculty that min
imum stipends at Stanford can be as
low as $2,450 per month.
"So there's a gap of about $600,"
he said. "At the minimum, there's a
big problem."
Biology Prof. Mark Simoni said
that faculty sympathize with the
plight of graduate students hut that
departments face budget con
straints.
"1 don't know a faculty member
at Stanford who would not like to
increase the stipend for graduate
students," he said. But he noted that
when the Biology Department
raised graduate stipends by $500 for
next year for the approximately 100
students in the program, "that's one

less graduate student we can take."
Beberg acknowledged that the
stipend problem does not have in
obvious solution.
"We do know there's a give and
take," he said. "We do understand
both sides of the issue, and we
understand we can't just raise pay
out of pixie dust. Bui it is becoming
an issue [especially with inflation]."
Undergraduate Senate Deputy
Chair Eugene Nho '10 also present
ed faculty with difficult-to-rcsolve
financial concerns.
"1 come to you with problems
and not solutions," Nho said.
He highlighted the price of
course readers, which are required
by approximately 150 of the 1000
undergraduate classes offered per
quarter and cost between $60 and
$S5.
For students taking multiple
reader-requiring courses per quarter
especially, Nho called the expense
"not a negligible number." He urged
faculty to post links to journal arti
cles on Course Work instead of
including them in a reader and to
seek low-cost printers as alterna
tives to the Stanford Bookstore.
"The ASStJ believes the faculty's
help is very critical in resolving this
situation," he said.
Nho said that keeping Green
Library open later was a key con
