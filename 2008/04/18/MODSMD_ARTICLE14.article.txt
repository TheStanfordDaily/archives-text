## Editorial Board Program won't end illegal downloading 
### 
The University recently established a
committee to investigate the possibili
ty of creating a legal music file sharing
service for students. While the idea is inter
esting and perhaps necessary — particularly
since Stanford faces possible legal repercus
sions for student file sharing on its network
— such a service is unlikely to significantly
reduce illegal downloading.
The ultimate fault for this lies not with
Stanford, but with the music industry.The re
strictions that record companies place on
legally downloaded files severely limit how
songs can be used and shared, making them
unattractive to students — and to music
downloaders in general, which is one reason
why Apple's iTunes software and the new
legal version of Napster have done little to
quash illegal downloading in general.
Want to share a song you purchased on
line with your friends? Go ahead and try —
the song won't be readable on their comput
er. Want to burn your favorite playlist for a
party? If you've exceeded the allotment of
burnt CDs granted by your downloading
software, you're out of luck — those songs
are stuck on your computer.
Unless Stanford administrators decide to
impose far more draconian restrictions on
file sharing, there is little incentive for stu
dents to use a legal file sharing program —
paying for crippled files — when they could
access a larger library with more versatile
music for free.
There have also been suggestions that
students could freely play the entire Napster
or il\jnes music library while connected to
the Stanford network, but that leaves stu
dents with the unattractive prospect of a
nonexistent music collection once they leave
the Farm.

Unfortunately, none of the current possi
bilities for legal file sharing offer particular
ly compelling reasons to switch from popu
lar programs like Kazaa and ourTlines. The
music industry must find ways to adapt to
changing technology — just as the film and
television industries adapted to the advent
of VCRs — rather than clamping down on
consumers or on the universities that those
students attend.
We understand that Stanford may be in a
difficult position legally — a position that
might be eased if the University offers a
legal file sharing program to its students.
And there are students who — either for
fear of legal repercussions or the desire to
support musicians — will be well served by
such a service. So this could be a good move
for both administrators and students — as
long as Stanford doesn't follow the lead of
Penn State, which includes the cost for a sim
ilar program in tuition, then offers the pro
gram for "free" to all students.
It's unlikely that student bills will grow
substantially, but on the heels of another tu
ition increase and the reduction of meal
plan options, a universal downloading fee
would be another unfortunate step in the
University's recent pattern of taking both
power and money away from students.
Finally, we urge the new committee to also
consider the ramifications of movie file shar
ing. While the size of movie files makes down
loading movies currently impractical for most
students, as technology develops it seems un
likely that the present obstacles will remain.
This is an issue that the University will have to
face soon — and the sooner administrators
start thinking about it, the better.
