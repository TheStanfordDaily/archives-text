## Accents, Axess, chocolate and disco 
### 
Taking a cue from fellow columnists
David Gauvey Herbert and Brendan
Selby, I decided to cram all musings un
able to support their own column into one,
deliciously random column.
Sexy Accents
Living in the accent-neutral land of Cali
fornia, it's always refreshing to hear new
things. It is generally accepted that accents
can add to a person's novelty and sex appeal.
Of course, not all accents are equal, with
some adding only a miniscule amount of ap
peal to a person. But a great accent can add
immensely to a person's attractiveness.
Which accents are the best then? Al
though I haven't heard all accents of the
world, I'd have to say that the Australian ac
cent deserves first place. Sexy and hip. the
sweet sounds of Australian pronunciation
win over your heart and soul. I suppose it's a
smoother, lighter, more exotic version of the
British accent.
Chocolate
If you are ever going to get an orgasm
from food, it will be at Max Brenner. This
chocolate and dessert shop has inundated
Australia and now has two shops in New
York City. While the pre-formed, Godiva
style chocolate they sell is delicious, the real
magic comes from the made-to-order
desserts with melted chocolate. You will tran
scend to a different realm as you enjoy what
are quite possibly the best chocolate desserts
in the world.
My recommendation motivated a friend
to visit the Max Brenner in New York. When
he asked the waitress if Max Brenner's was
where he could achieve a food orgasm, she
confirmed that this indeed was the place.
Delving into his dessert, he proceeded to
have multiple food orgasms. "Greatest rec
ommendation I've ever received," he told
me.
Axess
If you Google "Stanford Axess" the de
scription on the search page reads: "An error
has occurred" — epitomizing its dysfunc
tional nature. I swear, this software was made
back when the Internet first came to exis
tence because it doesn't utilize any of the im
provements to Web functionality developed
over the past 15 years. Painfully slow and
ugly, Axess is a blight to a university that pro
duced Google and has one of the top com
puter science programs in the nation. We
should just ask Google to redesign it for us, as
a charitable gesture to its alma mater. Or we

could just ask two random Stanford students
to work on Axess, and they could create a
vastly superior product.
The Disco Era
If I had to choose to live in a certain cul
tural era, the disco age would easily be my
first choice. Much of the greatest music ever
made was created then, like that of Earth
Wind and Fire, Gloria Gaynor and Stevie
Wonder. With great music came great dance
styles,such as locking, popping and breaking.
And if I'm not mistaken, people in the 70's
busted out on the dance floor more often,
which is always awesome. Don't forget the
funky disco fashions as well and.'while we are
at it, funk itself. Even the Grammys were
more interesting then — check out the Jack
son s's performances in the 1973 Grammys
show on Youtube.
Armed with the knowledge of disco,
chocolate, Axess and accents you are well
primed to uncover the mysteries of life.
