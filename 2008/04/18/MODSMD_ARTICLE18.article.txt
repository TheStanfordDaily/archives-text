## Don't destroy my home

When Suzie Wormtooth '10 found
out that Meyer library will be de
stroyed by 2012, a tear leaked out
of her pale, lifeless eye socket. "It's my
home," she told me.
Last November's announcement of the
library's imminent demise sent ripples
through the Meyer Library zombie commu
nity, of which Suzie Wormtooth considers
herself a member.
"None of us saw it coming" she sighed,
literally peeling her arm from a Math 132
problem set to wipe her face.
The zombies, while not quite "alive and
well," have enjoyed a presence on campus
since 1966, when the library was founded.
From humble beginnings, the number of
Meyer zombies has increased at an impres
sive rate and can now be said to constitute a
veritable nation-state, with its own culture,
language and rituals.
"We live a simple life here. We value
hard work, community and human brains,"
Suzie explained to me, as she gnawed the
remaining meat off of a human leg. "And
now they want to pull the ground out from
under our decaying, fly-infested feet. Do
they have no respect?"
Suzie's community lives in the warm and
inviting 24-hour study room on the first
floor of Meyer library.They spend their free

time studying, staring blankly, doing work,
not going outside and sighing in despair.
While most members of the community
prefer not to associate with one another,
there has nevertheless grown the rudimen
tary beginnings of a local pidgin language.
For instance, one of the words from this lan
guage is "uhhhhnnnhhnnnn," which loosely
translates to "you're stepping on my foot,
and it is interfering with my studies."
The zombies of Meyer library do not
have dwellings in the traditional sense, pre
ferring instead to live in rolling chairs.
Sleep, a ritual that they rarely engage in, is
done with the head tilted over the back of
their plastic, rolling domiciles, or on tables
next to them. Laughter is discouraged in
this stoic environment.
But soon, all of this will come crashing
down.
"They act as if people don't live here.
Like it's just another library. Try telling that

to Donald over there," she said, gesturing to
a heap in the corner with coats piled on top
of it. "We may he a vast, unwashed and un
dead horde, but that doesn't mean we
aren't, or weren't at one time, human."
As Suzie explains it, public outcry has
been misplaced. Uproar has primarily cen
tered around the displacement of Meyer's
East Asia collection, housed on the fourth
floor of the building. The fact that there is
an entire community living in the first floor
24-hour study room. Suzie argues, has been
entirely left out of the bureaucratic discus
sions.
It does seem unfair that these people,
many of whom have inhabited this space
continuously for a year, or even two years,
should be so forcibly asked to relocate.
Suzie has labeled the requisite relocation
an "exodus."
Time may be up for Suzie and her zom
bie community. Sure, they may be able to
find other places to whittle away their time,
staring away into the distance and thirsting
after human brains. But for zombies like
Suzie. it won't be the same.
"I've got everything here â€” brains,
school work, rolling chairs, brains ... I
can't imagine a life without Meyer, and I'm
