I believe in Stanford
Dear Stanford Family,
When I came to Stanford, my hope was to
coach here until I retired. While that isn't able
to happen, I will always cherish my seven
years on the Farm.
As many of you have probably heard, I
have accepted the head coaching job at
Louisiana State University. Before 1 am off to
my new home. I wanted to share a few things
with you:
1 believe in Stanford.
I believe in the University I have always
thought that the professors trying to cure
cancer or solve major world issues would be
more important than the basketball coach.

Stanford is much bigger than one person, par
ticularly when that person is some guy who
gets to coach basketball for a living.
I believe in Stanford Basketball. One of
the first things 1 did when I became the head
coach at Stanford was try to reinvigorate the
basketball alumni — which I think we did.
We had record attendance at our first ever
alumni weekend in 2005. I was very excited
about the big event in the works for this Sep
tember. I was proud to be able to continue
and, thankfully I believe, add to the pro
gram's tradition.
I believe in Stanford student athletes. I
have never been around a more impressive
group of young men and women. I have al
ways tried to surround myself with the best
people possible. Specifically, I can honestly

say I am better individual and coach because
of this group of young men. I want to thank
our players — and our staff — for making
my job easy.
ITie Stanford community has been incred
ibly gracious to my family and me. During my
time as an assistant and most recently as head
coach, the fans have been great supporters of
our program. I will miss the many friends 1
made here.
1 also want to give a big plug — and a big
thanks —to the 6th Man Club. You guys
made Maples an absolutely brutal place to
play for our opponents. You were fantastic
supporters of our players and our program.
Also, I always enjoyed the post season din
ners with bth Man members — you guys
helped keep my job fun.

rhere are too many people for me to
name that have made my time here extra spe
cial and are responsible for our success, but 1
am confident that they know who they are.
Thank you.
Just know that I will always be cheering
for the Cardinal — and I wouldn't mind if
you did a little cheering for the Tigers either.
rhank you again for a wonderful seven
years and the opportunity to be a part of
something so special.
Warmest Regards,
Coach J

Trent Johnson is the former coach of the
Stanford men's basketball team.
