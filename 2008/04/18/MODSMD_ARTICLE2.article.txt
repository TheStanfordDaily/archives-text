## Card seeks revenge over Bears Cal travels to the Farm for regular season finale in annual Big Game 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
With Cal heading to the Farm for the final
match of the regular season, the script couldn't
be written any better.
"Like a fairy tale," senior Celia Durkin said
of Saturday's upcoming matchup.
As the No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team
gears up for the Big Game, there isn't much love
for the cross-Bay rivals, especially after an early
season loss to them in February.
"We don't like them at all," Durkin said."We
usually come out pretty much on top. Our match
in the fall was kind of a surprise but I have no
doubt that we're going to come back and take
revenge."
"They've got some nice girls on the team, but
it doesn't matter — they're Cal," she added.
Seniors Lejla Hodzic and Whitney Deason
shared the same sentiments, though they were a
bit more restrained.
"Obviously, they're our biggest rival over
all, so it's a match we always get up for,"
Deason said. "We've had tough matches
with them all four years I've been here — j
they're a tough team."
"Well it's always a rivalry," Hodzic said.
"The Stanford-Cal rivalry has always existed.
We're especially pumped up because we lost to
them at Cal, so it's going to be fun."
Add in Lele Forood, head coach for eight
years, whose Cal sentiments are fairly obvious.
"She loves the rivalry, absolutely loves it,"
Durkin said. "Coach hates Cal a lot — especial
ly after we lost to them in the winter."
As both teams are tied atop the Pac-10
standings, the winner will walk away with the
Pac-10 title — something the Cardinal women
have yet to relinquish in 21 seasons.
Moreover, Stanford is currently 130-0 in the
last eight years at home, including regular and
post-season play.
The team's last home loss: Feb. 27,1999,
when No. 4 Cal took down the Cardinal in a
5-4 upset.
Playing on the Farm this time around, the
Cardinal women have home court advan
tage on their side, something they lacked in
February.
"We feel confident playing on our home
court," Deason said. "We bring confidence
and a good fight every time we go on the
court."
The match is especially important to a
Cardinal squad that seemed to have lost its
way earlier in the season.
"It's kind of culminated to this point be
cause of the nature of this season," Hodzic
said. "We had a rocky start to the season and
we really built back up, so this is the culmi
nating point of the season so far. It's a lot of
things coming together for the seniors and
we're playing Cal at home."
The losses came early in the season, a
shocker to a Cardinal team that once boast
ed an 89-match win streak.
After a loss to Arizona State — its fourth
of the season which marked the program's
first four-loss season since 1987 — Stanford
decided it was time to work harder as a team,
which led to a key sweep of Southern Cali
fornia and UCLA at home.
"We did have a rocky start to the season
because of injuries and illnesses." Hodzic
said."Despite the problems, we really stayed
connected as a team and we tried to pinpoint
the reasons why we're having difficulties.
Now. everyone's very excited for this last
match before NCAAs."
Though much of the lineup was up in the
air entering the season after the team lost its
top two players. Stanford has solidified both
the singles and doubles lineups.

now carries a swagger that it lacked at the
beginning of the season.
"Everyone on the team feels good about
how they're playing right now," Deason said.
"We definitely gained a lot of momentum
with our play the last couple of weeks and I
think we could be better. If we're in a good
place and everyone feels good, good things
will happen."
On Senior Day, no one can ignore the
contributions of Durkin. Deason and Hodz
ic.
All three have brought the experience
and maturity needed to guide the team
throughout a trying season.
"We try to serve as leaders and set good
example for our teammates," Hodzic said.
"But everyone plays a hand in the team
progress because everyone's a contributor."
Especially motivating has been Hodzic's
revival this season after she battled through
injuries the last two years.
"I'm really excited about the end of this

season because I've had a rough time with
injuries and I'm very excited for this team's
success," Hodzic said."l've been very fortu
nate to play a lot this season already and
whether or not I play, I'm really excited to
see the team do well my last year here."
After spending four years on the Farm to
gether, the three find it difficult to fathom
life away from Stanford. All three weighed
in on their journey through the years.
"We're all very close to the team, particu
larly the seniors," Hodzic said.
"They're both really great people, laid
back and just fun to be around," Deason
added. "I couldn't have asked for better peo
ple to spend my last four years with here."
"We've become really close and a lot
closer this year. They've been there for me
for a lot of different stuff," Durkin said.
"They really made me feel welcome in their
class even though I came in a year late. I
value seeing them so much that it's going to
be really hard, but I'm sure we're going to
keep in touch — if not, I'll make them."
With two championships already under
their belt and the way they're playing right
now, another championship may help with
the parting.
"It would be nice to have three out of
four in my career," Hodzic said.
But standing in the way of NCAAs is the
final regular season match with Cal.
"It's really exciting and kind of sad at the
same time," Durkin said. "I can't even be
lieve it's our last regular season home match
— it's gone by really, really fast.
"I think it's fantastic that we've lost to
Cal, so we're going to get sweet, sweet re
venge on them on Saturday and it's going to
be a fantastic Senior Day."

Playing on the Farm this time around, the
Cardinal women have home court advan
tage on their side, something they lacked in
February.
"We feel confident playing on our home
court," Deason said. "We bring confidence
and a good fight every time we go on the
court."
The match is especially important to a
Cardinal squad that seemed to have lost its
way earlier in the season.
"It's kind of culminated to this point be
cause of the nature of this season," Hodzic
said. "We had a rocky start to the season and
we really built back up, so this is the culmi
nating point of the season so far. It's a lot of
things coming together for the seniors and
we're playing Cal at home."
The losses came early in the season, a
shocker to a Cardinal team that once boast
ed an 89-match win streak.
After a loss to Arizona State — its fourth
of the season which marked the program's
first four-loss season since 1987 — Stanford
decided it was time to work harder as a team,
which led to a key sweep of Southern Cali
fornia and UCLA at home.
"We did have a rocky start to the season
because of injuries and illnesses." Hodzic
said."Despite the problems, we really stayed
connected as a team and we tried to pinpoint
the reasons why we're having difficulties.
Now. everyone's very excited for this last
match before NCAAs."

beginning of the season.
"Everyone on the team feels good about
how they're playing right now," Deason said.
"We definitely gained a lot of momentum
with our play the last couple of weeks and I
think we could be better. If we're in a good
place and everyone feels good, good things
will happen."
On Senior Day, no one can ignore the
contributions of Durkin. Deason and Hodz
ic.
All three have brought the experience
and maturity needed to guide the team
throughout a trying season.
"We try to serve as leaders and set good
example for our teammates," Hodzic said.
"But everyone plays a hand in the team
progress because everyone's a contributor."
Especially motivating has been Hodzic's
revival this season after she battled through
injuries the last two years.
"I'm really excited about the end of this

season because I've had a rough time with
injuries and I'm very excited for this team's
success," Hodzic said."l've been very fortu
nate to play a lot this season already and
whether or not I play, I'm really excited to
see the team do well my last year here."
After spending four years on the Farm to
gether, the three find it difficult to fathom
life away from Stanford. All three weighed
in on their journey through the years.
"We're all very close to the team, particu
larly the seniors," Hodzic said.
"They're both really great people, laid
back and just fun to be around," Deason
added. "I couldn't have asked for better peo
ple to spend my last four years with here."
"We've become really close and a lot
closer this year. They've been there for me
for a lot of different stuff," Durkin said.
"They really made me feel welcome in their
class even though I came in a year late. I
value seeing them so much that it's going to
be really hard, but I'm sure we're going to
keep in touch — if not, I'll make them."
With two championships already under
their belt and the way they're playing right
now, another championship may help with
the parting.
"It would be nice to have three out of
four in my career," Hodzic said.
But standing in the way of NCAAs is the
final regular season match with Cal.
"It's really exciting and kind of sad at the
same time," Durkin said. "I can't even be
lieve it's our last regular season home match
— it's gone by really, really fast.
"I think it's fantastic that we've lost to
Cal, so we're going to get sweet, sweet re
venge on them on Saturday and it's going to
be a fantastic Senior Day."

Stanford is looking to close out its regular season on a high note when it takes on Cal on Saturday. While the Cardinal has been domi
nant at home, it lost to the Golden Bears earlier in the year and the team's overall invincibility of years past has gone to the wayside.
With Cal heading to the Farm for the final
match of the regular season, the script couldn't
be written any better.
"Like a fairy tale," senior Celia Durkin said
of Saturday's upcoming matchup.
As the No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team
gears up for the Big Game, there isn't much love
for the cross-Bay rivals, especially after an early
season loss to them in February.
"We don't like them at all," Durkin said."We
usually come out pretty much on top. Our match
in the fall was kind of a surprise but I have no
doubt that we're going to come back and take
revenge."
"They've got some nice girls on the team, but
it doesn't matter — they're Cal," she added.
Seniors Lejla Hodzic and Whitney Deason
shared the same sentiments, though they were a
bit more restrained.
"Obviously, they're our biggest rival over
all, so it's a match we always get up for,"
Deason said. "We've had tough matches
with them all four years I've been here — j
they're a tough team."
"Well it's always a rivalry," Hodzic said.
"The Stanford-Cal rivalry has always existed.
We're especially pumped up because we lost to
them at Cal, so it's going to be fun."
Add in Lele Forood, head coach for eight
years, whose Cal sentiments are fairly obvious.
"She loves the rivalry, absolutely loves it,"
Durkin said. "Coach hates Cal a lot — especial
ly after we lost to them in the winter."
As both teams are tied atop the Pac-10
standings, the winner will walk away with the
Pac-10 title — something the Cardinal women
have yet to relinquish in 21 seasons.
Moreover, Stanford is currently 130-0 in the
last eight years at home, including regular and
post-season play.
The team's last home loss: Feb. 27,1999,
when No. 4 Cal took down the Cardinal in a
5-4 upset.
