## Card seeks revenge over Bears Cal travels to the Farm for regular season finale in annual Big Game 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
With Cal heading to the Farm for the final
match of the regular season, the script couldn't
be written any better.
"Like a fairy tale," senior Celia Durkin said
of Saturday's upcoming matchup.
As the No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team
gears up for the Big Game, there isn't much love
for the cross-Bay rivals, especially after an early
season loss to them in February.
"We don't like them at all," Durkin said."We
usually come out pretty much on top. Our match
in the fall was kind of a surprise but I have no
doubt that we're going to come back and take
revenge."
"They've got some nice girls on the team, but
it doesn't matter — they're Cal," she added.
Seniors Lejla Hodzic and Whitney Deason
shared the same sentiments, though they were a
bit more restrained.
"Obviously, they're our biggest rival over
all, so it's a match we always get up for,"
Deason said. "We've had tough matches
with them all four years I've been here — j
they're a tough team."
"Well it's always a rivalry," Hodzic said.
"The Stanford-Cal rivalry has always existed.
We're especially pumped up because we lost to
them at Cal, so it's going to be fun."
Add in Lele Forood, head coach for eight
years, whose Cal sentiments are fairly obvious.
"She loves the rivalry, absolutely loves it,"
Durkin said. "Coach hates Cal a lot — especial
ly after we lost to them in the winter."
As both teams are tied atop the Pac-10
standings, the winner will walk away with the
Pac-10 title — something the Cardinal women
have yet to relinquish in 21 seasons.
Moreover, Stanford is currently 130-0 in the
last eight years at home, including regular and
post-season play.
