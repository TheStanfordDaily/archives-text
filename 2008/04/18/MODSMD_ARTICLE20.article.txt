## Sports Pitchers face off in rivalry Penna, Chinn and Stanford meet Drewrey, Cal, in Berkeley 
### DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Softball team will look to con
tinue its five-game winning streak this weekend
in a three-game series with archrival Cal.
After faltering early on in conference play,
Stanford looks to have found its stride, having
won four consecutive conference games.
At 38-7 and 4-5 in conference, the Cardinal
sits in a tie for fourth place in the Pacific 10, four
games behind first place Arizona State and only
a game ahead of Cal, making this weekend's se
ries all the more important.
The series is a home-and-honie of sorts, with
Friday and Saturday's games taking place at
Stanford, while the Sunday contest will be
played in Berkeley.
As the Cardinal has become accustomed to
playing in the exceptionally competitive Pac
10,it faces another nationally ranked team with
a star pitcher in a weekend series: this time it'll
be the No. 21 Golden Bears and pitcher Maris
sa Drewrey.
Drewrey, a sophomore, enters the weekend
with a 22-10 record and a 1.68 ERA. She also
has an impressive 220 strikeouts in 212 innings
pitched.
Stanford coach John Rittman knows that
the key to beating Cal is getting to Drewrey.
"Cal's pitcher is good, and she is a sopho
more, so she has a bit of experience getting
through conference play. We are going to have
to play disciplined to beat them," said Rittman.
If Drewrey pitches well, the games are likely
to be low scoring, because the Cardinal also
boasts a star pitcher and another young pitcher
who is starting to come into her own.
The Cardinal is led by ace Missy Penna. She
enters the weekend with a 26-6 record and a
0.% ERA for the season to go along with 275
strikeouts.
It is unclear whether Penna can pitch all
three games this weekend, but if she cannot,
Rittman will send rising star and freshman Ash
ley Chinn to the circle for the Cardinal.
Chinn is fresh off a no-hitter against Santa
Clara on Tuesday, her second of the season. For
the year, Chinn is 11-1 with a 1.39 ERA.
Rittman made it seem as if he would not hes
itate to start Chinn in big Pac-10 games like the
ones this weekend.
"Ashley has pitched well in every outing
aside from the Arizona State game,and they are
the number one team in the country. I think she
learned a lot from that game," said Rittman.

GAME NOTES: Stanford embarks on a three-game series
with rival Cal this weekend as it looks to get over the
.500 mark in conference play. The Cardinal is 38-7
overall but only 4-5 in Rac-10 games so far. The team
will be led by its pitching staff; junior Missy Penna has a
0.96 ERA while freshman Ashley Chinn is coming off of
a no-hitter against Santa Clara.

The Cardinal would like to build off of
Chinn's performance Tuesday and continue its
offensive production, which led to the team's
12-0 win.
Stanford's offense is led by a pair of sopho
mores: centerfielder Alissa Haber and catcher
Rosey Neill.
Haber leads the team with an impressive
.397 batting average to go along with six home
runs and 22 RBIs out of the leadoff spot.
Neill provides the majority of the power in
the Cardinal lineup, hitting .380 with 17 home
runs and 45 RBIs.
Neill's year thus far is among the better indi
vidual seasons in Cardinal softball history. She
has homered in every weekend series, and with
two more homeruns, she will tie teammate
Michelle Smith for the most homeruns in a sin
gle season by a Stanford player.
In addition, Neill, along with Penna, was re
cently placed on the 25 person USA Softball
C ollegiate Player of the Year Watch list.
Ibe Cardinal will need great production out
of both Haber and Neill if it wishes to get the
best of its Bay Area rival.
Beating Cal has been a tall task for Stanford
Softball in the past.The Cardinal is just 18-28 all
time against the Golden Bears, and it has lost
two of the three meetings between the teams
last season.
Stanford will look to remedy that this week
end, starting Friday at 7 p.m. at Smith Family
Stadium.
