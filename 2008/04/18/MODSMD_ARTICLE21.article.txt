## Card serves "Big Smash" Cal, Stanford battle across the Bay for third place in the Pac-10 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 24 Stanford men's tennis team
is going for a clean sweep of Bay Area rival
California tomorrow when it takes on the
No. 29 Golden Bears in Berkeley.
Back in February, the Cardinal upset
the Bears in the "Big Smash" at Stanford,
5-2. The team came out firing and never
looked back, upsetting then-higher ranked
Cal in front of its home crowd.
But the tables are turned this time,
when Stanford (11-8, 4-2 Pac-10) travels
across the Bay and enters as the higher
ranked team. The last match did not count
as a conference match but Saturday's will.
Both teams have a 4-2 record in the
Pac-10 and are seeking to claim third place
outright behind No. 4 USC and No. 5
UCLA, something head coach John
Whitlinger would be "pretty darn happy
about." Additionally, the teams are fight
ing for NCAA post-season position, with
the winner likely being awarded a more fa
vorable draw in the tournament.
The Cardinal has also faced Cal (12-9,
4-2 Pac-10) in various tournaments this
year, and has had the better of the Bears
on the season, going 7-4 in singles and 6-3
in doubles play.
But Cal has done exceptionally well at
home this year, going 10-2 in dual matches
at the Hellman Tennis Complex.
"They play very well at home," said

weekend against Washington and Oregon.
In both matches, the Cardinal lost the dou
bles point but came back to win five singles
matches for the victories.
