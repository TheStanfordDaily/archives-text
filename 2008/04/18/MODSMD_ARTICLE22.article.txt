## Men host tournament, look to repeat 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a two-week hiatus, the No.
11 Stanford men's golf team will
swing back into action on the Farm
this weekend to host its only home
tournament of the season, the 2008
U.S. Intercollegiate Championship.
Last year, the Cardinal shared the
tournament crown with Minnesota
with an overall score of 838. Stanford
senior Rob Grube — then a junior —
fired an eight-under-par score of 202
to take the individual title as well.
The competition will be fierce
with 17 top-notch squads in atten
dance. Besides Stanford, six of the
competing teams are ranked in the
top 50 in the nation including No. 3
UCLA, No. 5 Southern California.
No. 20 Arizona State, No. 33 San
Diego State, No. 45 Oregon State and
No. 50 Oregon.
"UCLA and USC are always
going to be tough to beat no matter
where you play them," coach Con
rad Ray said. "With our local knowl
edge of Stanford and our home
course advantage we feel good
about our chances of winning. It is
hard to beat the Stanford golf
course when the weather is beauti
ful like this. The course stands the
test of time and just doesn't quit."
Stanford's team certainly is not a
pushover by any means. No. 45
Grube, No. 12 freshman Sihwan
Kim, sophomore Jordan Cox, fresh
man Steve Ziegler and junior Dodge
Kemmer are all looking to defend
the tournament title in the team
competition for the Cardinal. Junior
Daniel Lim and freshmen Graham
Brockington and Matt Kennernecht
will be competing as individuals.
"All of our golfers are very tal
ented," Ray said. "What's exciting
about this team is when you put the
pieces of the puzzle together, we
have some real fire power. We are
hoping to develop our consistency
once the post-season arrives."
The last tournament Stanford
played was the U.S. Collegiate

The weather conditions in Al
abama were so severe that play was
delayed by 30 minutes each morn
ing to let the course defrost. Though
the Stanford team was not used to
the cold, the Cardinal put up a good
fight until the finish, coming in 11th
place after posting a three-round
score of 897. Ziegler led the Cardi
nal,, recording his best career finish
at tenth place in the individual lad
der — he shot a two-over 218.
"We are really excited for this
weekend," Ray said. "We have had a
great couple weeks of preparation.
We had a strong final round in At
lanta and we made good progress
throughout the tournament there.
We also have had some great quali
fying scores, so we are excited to be
playing at home."
