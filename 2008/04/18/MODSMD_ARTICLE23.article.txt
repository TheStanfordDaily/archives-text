# Spartans present tough test
## 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
water polo team will make the short
trip to San Jose this weekend for
what will be its final regular season
game of the year, a conference
match-up with San Jose State.
The match against the No. 9 Spar
tans will be a rematch of a game
played in the Irvine Invitational
Tournament nearly two months ago.
On Feb. 23, the Card had a big 5-1
second period en route to a 15-8 vic
tory over then-No. 7 SJSU.
Senior Jackie Gauthier led the
way with four goals, and the Cardinal
showed its offensive balance with
nine different scorers. There are
many reasons to believe, however,
that the rematch will be a much clos
er affair.
For starters, the game will have no
bearing on conference positioning
for Stanford, as the team has already
clinched the No. 2 seed in the MPSF

conference tournament next week.
In addition, there is the possibility of
a mental hangover after last week
end's Big Splash and Senior Day vic
tories at Avery Aquatic Center —
going from two emotional games
such as those to a relatively meaning
less game always presents a chal
lenge.
As for the Spartans, Saturday will
be their Senior Day, as well as a
chance for a huge momentum boost
heading into the MPSF tournament.
All of these factors suggest that San
Jose State can pull off an upset. How
ever, Stanford players and coaches
are adamant that the Card will not be
looking past this game and will have
the same mentality as they do for any
other match.
"Since it is our last game before
[the] MPSF [tournament), it's impor
tant to finish off our season as well as
possible," said junior Kira Hillman,
who scored four goals in last week
end's two games.
"We want to be showing improve

ment right through the last game, so
we definitely want to be prepared
and play well. Our team has already
improved a lot this season, both on
an individual and team level, so the
next couple weeks are about sharp
ening our skills and working on de
tails."
Stanford coach John Tanner
shared his player's views.
"We are guaranteed the No. 2
seed in the MPSF tournament, but
we are focused on playing more con
sistently Saturday," he said."San Jose
has a strong, talented starting seven,
and they play with a lot of energy and
discipline."
The talent that Tanner refers to is
concealed by the Spartans' rather
mediocre record of 13-12 (4-7
MPSF). Five of their losses on the
year have come by a single goal (to
No. 7 Hawaii. No. 5 Cal, No. 10 UC-
Davis. No. 4 San Diego State and No.
8 UC-Irvine) and another loss was by
two goals (to No. 6 Arizona State).
Ilieir recent form has also been bet-

ter, as the Spartans have taken three
out of their last five games, with one
of those losses coming in four over
times against Irvine.
San .lose State has shown some
firepower throughout the year as
well, with their attack led by junior
Juliet Moss (45 goals) and sopho
more Bridget McK.ee (42 goals).The
Cardinal defense, though, has been
outstanding as of late. Headed by
goalkeeper Amber Oland, who has
made 22 saves in her last two games,
the team has only allowed an average
of five goals per game in its last four
matches.
Ultimately though, it may be the
intangibles that matter more than
the statistics. Will San Jose State
come out strong for their seniors?
Will Stanford have the necessary
focus to take care of business? These
are the questions that could decide
the eame.

The Cardinal will have an easy trip to San Jose State this weekend, but the match itself will be anything but simple: its opponents, the Spartans, are a top 10
team. The Spartans will be fueled by their Senior Day and, more importantly, thoughts and hopes of revenge Stanford won the first matchup, 15-8.
