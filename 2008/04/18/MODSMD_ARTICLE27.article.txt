## How Hair-able Can It Get? 
### WEIQI SAMANTHA TOH INTERMISSION SCRUFF SURVEYER 
Facial hair: a phenomenon so quotidian thai it hardly seems worth talking about. I ruly, however, facial hair affects us rather dramatically.
Be it dictating one's weekly shave cycles or establishing a reputation of rugged sexiness, our favorite hairy entity occupies a great part of our
lives.
In an attempt to help you determine general opinions about facial hair. 1 conducted a poll over the weekend with a random sample of 24
Stanford freshmen. Although I did get some weird looks at first, a good majority of these freshmen opened up after a while, with some strong
opinions about facial hair ensuing, those polled in groups often began to debate, discussing if the hairstyle or the person possessing the hair
style contributed more to a positive opinion of facial hair. Although "it depends on the guy" won out over depending on the trim, few reject
ed facial hair on men completely. . - .i''
"Goatees are universally sexy," one claimed, while another thought it looked exceptionally delicious on the chiseled jawbones of her biol
ogy professor. ypfn
I )espite a good 80% acknowledging that facial hair has the potential to look sexy on men, the general population appears to be less forgiv
ing toward girls, with 100% disliking bristles on female faces. Girls, apparently, need to wax it like a candle. Smooth is still in season, and per
haps always will be.
Hut the world is hardly as sexist as one would think. Both males and females tend to approve also of subtle hair growth on men. "Stubble"
won a majority of votes, followed by the goatee, another less hairy option. An informative participant even advised that kissing hairy men
"burned, and that was no fun" — smooth boys, she claimed, "just win atJtfe."
Curiously enough, however, the moustache, another less prickly option, received no approval. Perhaps it depends on the type of moustache
— moustaches, after all, range from the handlebar to the Chaplin trim. But do take note: "Most guys with 'staches," one participant ventured,
"look kind of sketchy."
Respondents were also asked the free-response question: 'If one is to develop facial hair, it's best to do so in the image of:" If you're in the
throes of indecision, perhaps take a moment to ponder popular facial hair role models. Ideas from the poll included typical pop culture icons,
ranging from Brad Pitt to David BeckhamTocaßoTe mt^TsTfibwevc'rVdo exist tor tlic more realistic readers out there. Be sure to check out
the stubble growth of "the guy down [your] hall," or even "the hairy hottie in IHUM." For those more undecided, struggling between imitat
ing unwashed musicians and "my dad," perhaps we should all give a moment of approval to our universal icon of hairy love: my favorite re
sponse to the poll, "Chuck Norris."
