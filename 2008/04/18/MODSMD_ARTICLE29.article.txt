## BATTLE OF THE BEARDS 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION JAWLINE JUDGE 
As the adage goes, you always want what you can't have. Thus,
facial hair means a lot to me. Oh, I'm no stranger to peach fuzz.
But when it comes to the real stuff? 1 sit back and let the experts
do their thing. Today, Bracketology salutes the facial hair uni
verse's most inspiring pioneers, celebrating each and every folli
cle. But I have to ask — mirror mirror on the wall, who's the hairi
est of them all?
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Abraham Lincoln's beard vs. 16. Richard Nixon's 5 o'clock
shadow
Pre-beard, Abraham Lincoln was a perennial political loser,
and ugly to boot. Post-beard? Our greatest President, and decep
tively sexy. In contrast, before "growing" his 5 o'clock shadow,
Richard Nixon was an up-and-coming congressman. Yet his lazy
unshaven face single-handedly cost him the election against JFK
when it made him look like a creep. Facial hair is clearly the most
important factor when it comes to politics. Your move, Hillary.
EDGE: Abe.
8. Santa Claus' beard vs. 9. ZZ Top's beards
Santa's jolly white beard, the brainchild of some Coca-Cola
advertising executive, has made the Xmas industry billions of dol
lars. Yet would we have any idea whom ZZ Top was were it not
for their distinctive Hasidic look? No. Of course not. (Bonus
points because their drummer, whose last name is Beard, is the
only member of the band without one.)
EDGE: ZZ Top.
5. Homer Simpson's brown stubble thingvs. 12. Hulk Hogan's
Handlebar
As much as 1 enjoy Homer's comedic stylings, I don't get his
weird brown stubble thing. (And if you Google Image "Homer
Simpson real life," it gets really freaky.) Conversely, the Hulk
ster's handlebar has withstood the test of time in impressive fash
ion. It is, in his words, "a true American Gladiator."
EDGE: Hulk.
4. Dumbledore's beard vs. 13. Blackbeard's namesake

Dumbledore represents the Beard Bracket's token wizard,
having narrowly edged out Gandalf. Merlin and (obscure NBA
reference!) DeShawn Stevenson of the Washington Wizards.
Blackbeard represents the Beard Bracket's token pirate, having
edged 0ut...a1l pirates. I think we can agree that wizards (and their
whiskers) arc infinitely cooler than pirates.
EDGE: Dumbledore.
3. Confucius's Fu Manchu vs. 14. Adam Morrison's Wisp
Adam Morrison, the former Gonzaga basketball
standout/crybaby and current pro bust/crybaby, is perhaps the
only person above the age of 1 b whose mustache could best be de
scribed as "prepubescent wisp." He's got absolutely no chance
against the Confu Manchu.
EDGE: Confucius.
6. Salvador Dali vs. 11. Frida Kahlo
Salvador Dali once said, "Every morning upon awakening. 1
experience a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador Dali."
And reader, if you had his parabola-shaped beauty of a 'stache, 1
think you'd feel exactly the same way. But I'm thinking Frida, and
here's why: a) She's a girl with facial hair. The novelty! b) It's a
unibrow, c) She had an affair with Leon Trotsky, which is proba
bly the greatest sexual combination of facial hair of all time and
d) It's. A. Freaking. Unibrow.
EDGE: Frida.
7. Elvis's Sideburns vs. 10. Martin Van Buren's Mutton Chops
Elvis and his sideburns would be nothing if Martin Van Buren
hadn't shaved trails a century earlier by becoming our first mut
ton-chopped President.
EDGE: Marty.
2. Hitler's Hitler vs. 15. Howie Mandel'sSoul Patch
When you think about it. Hitler's mustache and Howie Man
del's Soul Patch are really the same hair — just on different parts
of their face. (That blew your mind. 1 know.) Nonetheless, the
patch is overmatched against the Herr's hair.
EDGE:Hitler.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Lincoln vs. 9. ZZ Top

All right, at least Lincoln's heard was moderately attractive.
ZZ Top's is a glorified puhic mess.
EDGE: Abe.
12.1 lulk Hogan vs. 4. Dumbledore
Dumhledore handily Horcruxes Hulk Hogan's handlebar.
EDGE: Albus.
3. Confucius vs. 11. Frida Kahlo
It's troublesome how Confucius looks different in every pic
ture. Who knows if he even had facial hair? I le just can't compete
with the consistency of Frida's Bert-like brow.
EDGE: Frida.
10. Van Buren vs. 2.1 filler
Marty Van B's chops give him the awesome look of an old
innkeeper who's just seen a ghost. Hitler's toothbrush 'stache is
actually pretty dumb. Surprisingly easy call.
EDGE: Van Buren.
FINAL FOUR
1. Lincoln vs. 4. Dumbledore
Dumbledore's look is impressive but generic. Lincoln's beard
was so revolutionary that half the country seceded upon his elec
tion. Slavery and states' rights may have also played a role. Most
ly the beard, though
EDGE: Abe.
11. Frida vs. 10. Van Buren
Frida's unibrow was so awe-inspiring, various tropical birds
and monkeys used to sit on her shoulders just to get near it. All
poor Martin could attract were ghosts at the local tavern.
EDGE: Frida.
CHAMPIONSHIP
1. Lincoln vs. 11. Frida
In a stunner. Frida brow-beats I lonest Abe! 1 didn't even see
this one coming until it happened. Truly, a monumental victory
for both Girl Power and Brow Power.
EIXiE: Frida Kahlo.
El)GE:Gender-bending audacity.
