# PLAYOFF SPIKE
## Stanford TAKES ON Northridge IN MPSF FIRST ROUND 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the Cardinal takes the floor at
No. 4 Cal State-Northridge on Saturday, it
will be the No. 6 Stanford men's volleyball
team's first appearance in the MPSF quar
terfinals in five years.This year's squad has
already matched its best win total since the
1997 NC'AA champion team and enters
the conference tournament as the sixth see
The Cardinal (17-10, 12-10 MPSF)
ended the regular season on a high note
last weekend with a pair of wins over high
er-ranked teams to secure a quarterfinal
berth. While eight teams make the tourna
ment, Stanford finished high enough to
avoid Wednesday night's play-in match
between the sev

enth and eighth teams in the conference.
"It's incredible that it took all the way
to the second-to-the-last weekend for
teams to secure a spot [in the tournament)
and it took the last match of the last week
end to determine the top seed," Stanford
head coach John Kosty said. "Men's vol
leyball in this league is just great and it was
a lot of fun this season. 1 am really looking
forward to the playoffs."
The Cardinal starts the tournament on
the road at third-seeded Northridge (22-6,
17-5), with a spot in next weekend's semi
finals on the line. The seven remaining
teams are battling for one automatic bid to
the NCAA Final Four and an at-large bid

that generally goes to the next best finish
er in the conference, which is consistently
the nation's strongest — seven of the na
tion's top eight teams currently reside in
the MPSF.
No. 8 UC-Irvine won Wednesday
night's play-in game against No. 11 USC
and will face second-seeded No. 3 BYU in
the quarterfinals. No. 2 Long Beach State,
as the top seed, has a bye into the semifi
nals and awaits the winner of the contest
between the fourth and fifth seeds. No. 6
UCLA and No. 5 Pepperdine, respectively.
The pair of wins last weekend — four
game battles with UCLA and Irvine —
were crucial for Stanford heading into the
postseason, both in terms of seeding and
momentum.
" 1 was pretty confident coming into this
weekend that if we could get back on
track, get back the rhythm that we had be
fore Dead Week and Finals break, then we
could get on a really good roll and that is
exactly what happened," Kosty said after
the victory over Irvine.
Even though the Cardinal was the
lower seed in both of those matches, Kosty
does not consider them upsets but rather
evidence of the parity in the middle of the
conference.
"I went into the weekend with the
idea that there are three teams in this
league who are one notch above every
body else and that is Long Beach, BYU
and Northridge," he said. "And then
everybody else is in the same boat. Na
tional rankings and MPSF rankings
aside, we're all right there. Any team can
win any night — and that also includes
the top three."
Stanford will aim to prove that on Sat
urday when they take on one of the three
teams who entered the final weekend of
conference play in a tie for first. North-

close games to Long Beach on the final
night of the regular season.
The teams have played each other
three times already this season, with the
Cardinal winning in a preseason tourna
ment and Northridge sweeping the con
ference series.
Junior Eric Vance is the offensive and
serving leader for the Matadors with 4.5
kills per game and 49 aces on the season.
Libero Ali'i Keohohou anchors the
hack-row defense, while Kevin McKniff
is the team's top blocker.
"Northridge is one of those teams
that you have to play really consistent
ly,' Kosty said. " ITiey just relentlessly
come after you. They don't run a partic
ularly fast offense, but they don't make
errors. They serve tough and they don't
make hitting errors.They'll let you block
them, but they won't give you free
points. You have got to be on your game
when you play them. They are beatable
but they are a good, tough team."
The C ardinal will look to sophomore
opposite Evan Romero and senior out
side hitter Matt Ceran in leading the of
fense. Since returning from an injury
early in the season, freshman Spencer
McLachlin has added another strong
arm to the outside. Romero has 418 kills
on the season,and Ceran and McLachlin
have each added over 2(X).
If the Cardinal can get a win over
Northridge, then the team will face ei
ther BYU or Irvine in the conference
semifinals next week in Long Beach. If
Stanford loses, the season — the pro
gram's best in years — will be over.

nament will be on the line when the Cardinal
takes on the Matadors. Only two MPSF teams
will qualify for the national tournament, so
No. 6 Stanford has its work cut out. In any
case, the Cardinal should certainly be satis
fied with its season: the team's 1 7 wins on the
season are the most since 1997.
ridge ended up third after losing three
close games to Long Beach on the final
night of the regular season.
The teams have played each other
three times already this season, with the
Cardinal winning in a preseason tourna
ment and Northridge sweeping the con
ference series.
Junior Eric Vance is the offensive and
serving leader for the Matadors with 4.5
kills per game and 49 aces on the season.
Libero Ali'i Keohohou anchors the
hack-row defense, while Kevin McKniff
is the team's top blocker.
"Northridge is one of those teams
that you have to play really consistent
ly,' Kosty said. " ITiey just relentlessly
come after you. They don't run a partic
ularly fast offense, but they don't make
errors. They serve tough and they don't
make hitting errors.They'll let you block
them, but they won't give you free
points. You have got to be on your game
when you play them. They are beatable
but they are a good, tough team."
The C ardinal will look to sophomore
opposite Evan Romero and senior out
side hitter Matt Ceran in leading the of
fense. Since returning from an injury
early in the season, freshman Spencer
McLachlin has added another strong
arm to the outside. Romero has 418 kills
on the season,and Ceran and McLachlin
have each added over 2(X).
If the Cardinal can get a win over
Northridge, then the team will face ei
ther BYU or Irvine in the conference
semifinals next week in Long Beach. If
Stanford loses, the season — the pro
gram's best in years — will be over.
