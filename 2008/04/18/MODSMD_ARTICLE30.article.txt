To scare the crap out of people
If you've ever been to a heavy metal
concert, you know exactly what I'm
talking about. You walk into a crowd
ed venue, with your blue jeans and
übiquitous black band shirt, and
maybe a wallet chain as well. And then
you walk right past a guy with a six-inch
goatee shaped into devil horns. Quite a
harrowing experience. Facial hair can
also be a way of making people think
you're a deranged serial killer, or at
least someone that they would want to
keep away from their children. Thank
fully, this look isn't too popular outside
of the death and black metal circuits.

One of my favorite TV shows is the American ver
sion of "Queer as Folk," a licentious Showtime pro
duction following the lives of five gay men living
(among other activities) in Pittsburgh. 1 could give a
brief or extended biography of every one of the main
characters, all the way down to their pets, but truth be
told, there is only man who is the star of the show: the
wealthy, pompous, promiscuous and lustful Brian
Kinney. With plain, crisp white shirts and fitted Levi's,
tousled hair and a smooth face. Brian Kinney is al
most too GO to handle. Yes, it's possible.
The worst thing about having a celebrity crush,
though, is that you will often waste time on the Inter
net reading about him or looking for wallpapers to
plaster across your computer screen. It is never a for
tunate situation, however, when the man you felt epit
omized beauty turns out to be scruffy, beast like Nean
derthal thing, whose bushels of facial hair almost ob
scure his entire face.
"What happened to the clean-shaven Casanova 1
once knew?" you might ask. Why must a man, sought
after by countless women, resort to growing what
looks like a small rodent on his face? I too am strug
gling to find a definitive answer, but below are a few
speculative theories as to why men grow facial hair.
Aside from the four motives for hair growth given
here, there arc times when we're not even sure why
we do things. I wouldn't be surprised to hear some
guys saying, "I don't know, just because" when you
ask them why they grow facial hair. Maybe it's time
for a change, for a new style. Who knows? I still think
that GO beats backcountry mountaineer any day,
though.
There you have it, guys. Smarten up and lose the
fur. Trust me, you won't miss it.

To be edgy/a "had boy "/in style
This makes no sense, but male celebrities will certainly forego the razor
in favor of that "I'm too cool to look clean" idea. Apparently looking as
though you've been foraging in the woods for survival is infinitely chic. I
don't know, perhaps clean faces are too indicative of "metrosexuals," men
who dedicate more time than usual to their appearance (sometimes more
than their girlfriends), and are therefore seen as unmanly. After all, the
stereotype is that females are the ones who take a long time in the bath
room; guys arc supposed to be content with just washing and going.
Whatever the cultural norm is. I'm not sure the scruff and gruff look is
more edgy than it is plain lazy. There also seems to be a trend among male
celebrities that heaps of facial hair is "sexy". Sexy. For some reason, the
word assumes a new connotation when placed in that context. I'm not
even sure 1 know what it means anymore.

Religion
Oftentimes facial hair
isn't only lor spectacle or
fashion purposes. Orthodox
Judaism and sonic followers
of Islam encouragc the
growth of beards as a way of
showing their observance of
the Old Testament or the
Quran. In Christianity,
Jesus is usually depicted
with a beard and mous
tache. Facial hair can simply
be a matter of respecting
your religion, though not all
followers believe it to be
necessary. Somehow I
doubt this is why George
Clooney and Ryan
Phillippc abandoned their
morning shaving routines.

Sheer Laziness
Honestly, how many girls can say that they shave their legs on
a regular basis? Pants and jeans aren't just useful for cold weath
er; leg stubble needs them too. Likewise, 1 wouldn't hold it
against a guy to have a little stubble every now and then. What if
he had to pull a couple of all-nighters during the week and bare
ly had enough energy to make it to class? Or perhaps it's just one
of those days when just leaning over to dispose of empty candy
wrappers or rotting fruit cores when your trash can is only a few
steps away seems like an Olympic feat. We're all in college. We
know what it's like.
