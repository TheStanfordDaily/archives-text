# How to shave in only one hour
## 
### SAMANTHA LASAROW INTERMISSION BARBER 
Many students are glad to note that Furry February has passed, and only those with "felliculaphilia" (an obsession with mustaches, ac
cording to Barney on "How 1 Met Your Mother") miss the days of Mustache March.
Spring is here, and 'tis the season to shed that winter coat and join the ranks of the clean-shaven! But let's face it: shaving that facial hair
you've been growing for the past two months isn't all that easy. With the help of freshman Danny Naylor, an avid Furry February partici
pant. 1 shall lead you through the steps and stages of shaving a beard.

From lhat fated first day of February, Naylor's previous chinstrap (a thin layer of fuzz lining only the jawbone) began to explode into
facial foliage that ZZ Top would be proud of.
Needless to say. Naylor rose to the ranks of Furry February Hall of Fame, and though he could not participate in Mustache March due to his loyalty to LSJUMB (Naylor plays the Tuba,
and a mustache makes it "painful and nearly impossible to play"), he stood by his comrades, bearded in solidarity.
There comes a time in every young man's life, however, when he must succumb to the frightened looks of passersby and make a little changc in his grooming habits. When onlookers began
to vocalize such hurtful musings as, "Did Cal lose another hippie?" Naylor knew lie had to lather up.
"1 decided to shave my beard and buzz my hair," Naylor recalled, "and all 1 had was my beard trimmer."
With his weapon of choice in his hand, he made one swipe over the top of his head, and the batteries died. With a bald streak outlining the center of his head, Naylor knew he was at the
point of no return. He proceeded to shave his head in five-minute chunks in between charging his beard trimmer, and then he could procrastinate no longer: It was time to begin on the much
dreaded beard.
Stage 1: Shave The Neck
The shaving of the neck (the part of the beard directly under the chin) is not too difficult, at least in Naylor's case. The hair that grows here is far less plentiful than that which grows on the
jawline, and Naylor was able to use a regular two-blade disposable razor to receive a clean shave on that tender underside. Naylor then sported a Greek-style beard a la King Leonidas, and it
was time for the next task.

Stage 2: Play with the Beard
Naylor decidcd that his Lconidis
beard could only be made more epic if
he were to spike it with extra-strength
gel. He enjoyed his spikey beard for a
few moments, feeling like quite the
punk-rock Hamlet. However, the gel
was no match for the natural tenden
cies of his facial hair, and his lion's
mane was soon too tame to be fun.
â€¢ Stage 3: Trim the Excess
Naylor next washed the gel out of
his beard and tried to buzz it to make it
easier to shave (there was one month's
growth on his cheeks, and three
month's worth on the chinstrap). The
beard trimmer couldn't muster up
enough energy to attack his beard, and
it completely puttered out. With quick
wit, Naylor used a buzz-cut attachment
on an electric razor he happened to
have, and was able to get the beard
down to a stubbled shadow. Naylor
was following in the footsteps of Viggo
Mortenson in "Lord of the Rings." and
the women flocking by the boys' rc
stroom stopped dead in their tracks to
swoon at his feet. But Naylor was de
termined to finish the task set out be
fore him.

Stage 4: Shave the Sides
After much consideration over
shaping a lightening bolt darting
across one cheek and sweeping up his
chin to end at the other check, Naylor
took up his razor and began shaving
the left side of his beard. Up the jaw
bone, starting near his ear, he worked
his way down to the chin. After rins
ing his face and re-applying shaving
cream three times (due to massive
amounts of hair that just would not be
removed on first swipe), Naylor suc
cessfully completed the action on the
right side as well.
Stage 5: The Chin
The hairs 011 Naylor's chinny chin
chin were all that was left. Naylor
hadn't shaved his chin in well over
two years, and he knew it was time.
After saying goodbye to the bristles.
Naylor began shaving his chin from
the bottom up.
Now. Naylor walks around cam
pus carefree, with no shouts of
"Wrong part of the Bay, Bear!" hit
ting him in the face. All of this happi
ness in only one hour. Thank good
ness for April.
