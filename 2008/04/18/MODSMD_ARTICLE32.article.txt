## Lament of the Hairless 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION BABYFACE 
Women, 1 have been told, do not
like beards. Their coarse hairs,
women say, grate against soft femi
nine features. Their dense but shape
less growth obscures the clean angle
of the jawline. They remind the fairer
sex of the Civil War era. when men in
blue and gray rags and oddly
squashed hats proudly sported mut
tonchops along with their necrosis
and chose to kill each other in horri
ble. unsanitary ways rather than stay
at home and discuss agriculture.
Women themselves tell me this, and
yet I see women hanging on the arms
of scruffy indie chaff tossed from the
Great American Music Hall mill, run
ning their fingers through Shenan
doahs straight off a Thomas Nast De
mocrat.
When I confront them, thev denv

it. It was not a beard they were touch
ing, they tell me, but rather a mere five
o'clock shadow, some forgivable evi
dence of hurriedness or apathy earlier
in the day. Ha ha ha, they say, hoping
to perhaps defuse my sense of despair.
Ha ha. I reply, necessarily. These
women mean well. But the occasional
subtle twitch of their eyes toward the
fine, translucent down that dots my
upper lip betrays their true motive.
They are, I have found, simply consol
ing me over my personal inability to
grow a beard.
In the beautiful michoacana town
of La Quemada, a child once in
formed me that 1 would look good in a
mustache. She was a young, absurdly
cute and vaguely murine girl who
found my name impossible to pro
nounce and ceaselessly carried with
her a handbag whose sole content was
another handbag shaped like a rat. I

stated that, yes, I was in agreement
with her assessment. Irene's father
had a mustache — a gloriously black
Franz Joseph that swept easily across
his jowls — as did a substantial por
tion of the men in the town, and my re
sponse was partially an effort not to
alienate this demographic. I did. how
ever, feel strongly that I really would
look good in a mustache. 1 hoped that
it would come as part of a larger
beard-and-sideburns combination
platter, but at that point in my devel
opment 1 would have happily settled
for a simple Nietzschean brush.
Then 1 should grow one, she insist
ed. Yes, 1 repeated, but 1 was very
busy at the moment with work, too
busy to devote time and energy to hair
growth. She was not convinced. Why
don't I just go ahead and do it? What
was I doing right now? 1 was writing
an educational song about diarrhea,
but I didn't want tojust come right out
and say so.
Look. 1 told her. bending slowly to
her dwarfish altitude like an enor
mous gringo heron. I cannot grow a
mustache. 1 would like to, but heaven
continues to ignore my petitions. It is
like a Greek tragedy. 1 said. A Greek
tragedy about a beard.
She took the news in the noncha
lant way that children sometimes do,
where it is unclear that they even
grasp the enormity of the confession
made to them. Irene bobbed her head
and ran away to draw flowers on
sheets of graph paper loaned her by
the older children. But her respect for

me was clearly diminished. Though
she still shared candy with me and of
fered timid gifts of colored-pencil self
portraits, in her generosity was the
spirit of charity. Pity for my incom
pleteness informed her later interac
tions with me, and the last I would see
of her was as the brief flutter of a sum
mer dress the night before I left the
country, dancing in her peripatetic
way with three older brothers whose
faces already advertised a swell of
testosterone.
See, facial hair ideally inspires re
spect and fear, beards being signs of
virility. My eternal pubescence, how
ever. has never done more than pro
duce a slight prismatic sheen when ex
posed to direct light, light that both
bends and emasculates as it passes
through the pale blond follicles. This
has been spun as a good thing. It
means I shave about as often as I do
laundry. Nevertheless, there remains

that solid substrate of shame that the
callow or naive occasionally expose in
me.
Maybe extrapolation from the un
conscious attitude shift of a six-year
old is not the most reasonable founda
tion for a lifetime of insecurity. There
are some females who, at their very
core, prefer the embarrassing baby
faced nakedness 1 exhibit. But it
seems to me that these women are
misinformed. Those hipsters with iron
filings on their cheeks, the ancient
Norwegians soaked in the smell of cod
and two-strokes, Ulysses S. Grant,
they arc the advantaged here, with
their faces warmed and their sexual
prowess on display. I must stay in the
shadows, a resentful eunuch waiting
for the day his hormones will finally
toggle on and transform him into the
hirsute beast nature must have in
tended. Necessarily.
