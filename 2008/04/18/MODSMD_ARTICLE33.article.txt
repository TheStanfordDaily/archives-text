## Facial hair and fine dining collide on the Row 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION BEARD BROTHER 
For centurics, with a few notable
exceptions like Abraham Lincoln, fa
cial hair has been all but synonymous
with barbarians and homeless people.
Neither of these groups is usually as
sociated with particularly good food.
However, there is one place where
great food and facial hair go together
brilliantly: the dining room of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. When dining at this
fine establishment, some portion of
the clientele is almost guaranteed to
be exhibiting facial hair. In fact, other
kinds of hair are available as well. On
a hot day, for example, your meal
might be complemented by visible
chest hair.
Every week. Chef Ko and his mus
tached accomplice, Sal, cook up excit
ing menus fit for consumption by the
men who will clearly be the leaders of
our nation as soon as they get a
chance to shave (and recover from
last weekend's hangover). One recent
dinner featured a preparation of
mahi-mahi, crispy and spicy on the
outside, yet moist and flavorful inside.
This excellent dish exhibited the
Cajun flair that might be provided by
Emeril Lagasse, combined with a bit
of a tropical twist that might be in
spired by Roy Yamaguchi. The mahi
mahi was accompanied by crispy fried
shrimp, chewy calamari and mush
room risotto.
Twenty-four hours later, it was
time to move from surf to turf with
generous servings of steak fresh off
the outdoor charcoal grill, served with
potatoes and other veggies. Perhaps
the quality was slightly short of Peter
Luger's or Spark's (although unlike
Spark's, SAE has not been the scene
of any notable mob hits in recent
memory), but it is a far cry from any
mystery meat that might be served in
the dining halls.
Sometimes Ko decides that the
previous offerings have been lacking.
That's when it's time for an appear
ance by a guest chef. Last week a sushi
chef arrived to help churn out more
maki, sushi and sashimi than the
whole house could manage to eat.
And once again, this was nothing like
the express sushi available from Stan
ford Dining, which might contain any
thing from old fish to recycled tire
rubber. Instead, the chef handcrafted

fresh fish with rice and seaweed just
moments before consumption.
Lunch has been known to feature
a variety of gourmet selections includ
ing macaroni with cheese, cold-cut
sandwiches and pizza that sometimes
seems to have been inspired by corru
gated cardboard. While the beverage
selection is rather typical of any Row
house or dining hall, the SAF kitchen
does offer its own twist on serving that
is both elegant and unique. Due to the
lack of real cups, a popular option is to
employ a reused red cup from last
weekend's party. For a more upscale
experience, you might chose to dis
creetly wait around the Hobart in
hopes of getting your hands on one of
the much sought-after non-dispos
able cups which may or may not have
been stolen from a cheap diner. And
finally, there is the ever-classy option
to drink out of a bowl.
If you're really demanding, per
haps this high-end dining experience
isn't enough for you and you also de
mand entertainment with your meal.
In that case, come by SAF in the late
spring or early fall when it becomes a
sort of cabaret-style comedy club fea
turing the ever-so-funny pledges who
are liable to be called on for the per
formance of a joke at any moment.
Topics of pledge jokes have ranged
from [deleted in editing] to [deleted in

And best of all, eating at SAE is
cheap. Based on the quarterly board
rate, each meal comes out to $10.95.
Mahi-mahi, shrimp, calamari for
under $ 11? Even a bearded barbarian
wouldn't be able to turn fhat offer
down.
