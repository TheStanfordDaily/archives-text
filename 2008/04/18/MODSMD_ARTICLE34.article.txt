Facial hair plays a negligible role in "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," the new comedy from
producer Judd Apatow ("Knocked Up," "Superbad"). There arc no huge beards, no flowery
. mustachios or gangsta-chic soul patches; there is barely even a hint of five o' clock shadow.

Pubic hair and. more broadly, its accompanying full

there, stark naked. Seriously you guys, the penises and the boobies
— they're everywhere.

Other than the extensive nudity, however, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is a rather routine romantic comedy. Most of the movie takes place at a resort in
Hawaii, where Peter has gone to get over Sarah, and where Sarah has gone with her new rock-star boyfriend, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Once Peter is

over how incredibly awkward it is that he and Sarah are staying
in the same hotel, he manages to suck it up enough to start dat

Peter falls for Rachel, while Sarah and Aldous break up. Sarah
wants to reunite with Peter. Peter thinks he wants Rachel now
but he's not sure, there's an orgasm contest and a Dracula musi

there is really not a whole lot that is groundbreaking about

That is not to say that "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is a
bad movie; in fact, it's one ol the funniest movies I've seen

in a long time. I won't lie to you all: I rolled like a
roflcopter. But it is to say that, in the pantheon

of Judd Apatow movies, "Forgetting Sarah
Marshall" just doesn't seem to fit. Apatow

is. by now. world-renowned for making
movies that are funny because they're

awkward, or especially true to life.

or because they're just ridiculous
and over the top. "Forgetting
Sarah Marshall" is none of those
I things. In its plot, its characters
and especially its setting, "For-

getting Sarah Marshall" feels far too traditional to be considered a Judd Apatow film, and that is ultimately its main failing.
On its own. "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is a very good movie, but compared to "Anchorman," "The 40 Year-Old Virgin"
or any of Apatow's other hits, it feels disappointingly normal and borderline cliche.

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" will go down in history as a movie that did a lot of things right. Its advertising campaign,
starting with billboards declaring "I'm so over you. Sarah Marshall" and extending to You Tube videos and a fake
L blog, made perfect use of the gossip-based, viral marketing capabilities of the information age. Its comedic stvle,

or c —i — ©~* —
with a focus on sight gags and pop culturc references, will make a wide range of audiences
k laugh out loud. It will he, and it deserves to be. a very successful movie. But. in all like-

lihood. "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" will never be considered among the highest
achievements of the legendary Judd Apatow, and the film's creators will just

have to accept that. At least they can take solace in knowing that people aren't
likely to forget "that movie with all the peniscs in it."
