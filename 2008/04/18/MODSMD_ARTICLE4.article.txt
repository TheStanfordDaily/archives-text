# Card faces L.A. challenge
## No. 10 Stanford GOES FOR Pac-10 SUPREMACY 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
No. 10 Stanford heads to Los An
geles this weekend for a three-game
set against UCLA.The team looks to
extend its series win streak to 11.
Both teams enter tonight's match
on the heels of recent success. The
Cardinal has won four straight; the
Bruins swept UC-Riverside last
weekend before falling to Cal State-
Northridge on Tbesday.
Stanford has been powered by its
pitching — with the exception of
Wednesday's extra-inning 11-10 win
over San Francisco, the Cardinal
arms have been able to keep oppo
nents in check, holding Santa Clara
and Oregon State to just 13 runs
combined over three games.
Stanford did, however, use eight
pitchers against the Dons, indicating
a larger trend: coach Mark Marquess
has interchanged pitchers at will,
sometimes even using position play
ers like center fielder Sean Ratliff
and third baseman Austin Yount.
This is in part due to a packed sched
ule that calls for about five games a

week, putting an added strain on the
Cardinal's arms.
"Coach Marquess has an idea of
what he wants to do in certain situa
tions," said junior second baseman
Cord Phelps.
While Friday's pitcher is yet to be
determined, Stanford will send sen
ior Erik Davis to the mound on Sat
urday and sophomore Jeffrey lnman
on Sunday.
Davis, who has thrown three
straight complete games, drew the
praise of Marquess for his stamina
and production.
"I've been coaching for a long
time, and 1 don't think I've ever had a
pitcher who has opened the Pac-10
season with three consecutive com
plete games in conference action,"
Marquess said. "What he has been
able to do the last three weeks is phe
nomenal."
Davis, lnman and the rest of the
Cardinal staff will face a Bruin of
fense that has been sporadic
throughout the year. They have
scored 20 runs twice and have won

Center fielder Sean Ratliff has been a major reason for the Cardinal's success this year — he leads Stanford in home
runs and slugging percentage while playing solid defense. He has also appeared in three games as a pitcher for the
Cardinal, going 2-0 in his opportunities. Coach Mark Marquess has used various position players as pitchers.
