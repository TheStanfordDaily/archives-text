# Card faces L.A. challenge
## No. 10 Stanford GOES FOR Pac-10 SUPREMACY 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
No. 10 Stanford heads to Los An
geles this weekend for a three-game
set against UCLA.The team looks to
extend its series win streak to 11.
Both teams enter tonight's match
on the heels of recent success. The
Cardinal has won four straight; the
Bruins swept UC-Riverside last
weekend before falling to Cal State-
Northridge on Tbesday.
Stanford has been powered by its
pitching — with the exception of
Wednesday's extra-inning 11-10 win
over San Francisco, the Cardinal
arms have been able to keep oppo
nents in check, holding Santa Clara
and Oregon State to just 13 runs
combined over three games.
Stanford did, however, use eight
pitchers against the Dons, indicating
a larger trend: coach Mark Marquess
has interchanged pitchers at will,
sometimes even using position play
ers like center fielder Sean Ratliff
and third baseman Austin Yount.
This is in part due to a packed sched
ule that calls for about five games a

week, putting an added strain on the
Cardinal's arms.
"Coach Marquess has an idea of
what he wants to do in certain situa
tions," said junior second baseman
Cord Phelps.
While Friday's pitcher is yet to be
determined, Stanford will send sen
ior Erik Davis to the mound on Sat
urday and sophomore Jeffrey lnman
on Sunday.
Davis, who has thrown three
straight complete games, drew the
praise of Marquess for his stamina
and production.
"I've been coaching for a long
time, and 1 don't think I've ever had a
pitcher who has opened the Pac-10
season with three consecutive com
plete games in conference action,"
Marquess said. "What he has been
able to do the last three weeks is phe
nomenal."
Davis, lnman and the rest of the
Cardinal staff will face a Bruin of
fense that has been sporadic
throughout the year. They have
scored 20 runs twice and have won

NOTES: The Cardinal is on a four game win

Stanford has won ten straight series and will
try to make it 11 straight this weekend.

Center fielder Sean Ratliff has been a major reason for the Cardinal's success this year — he leads Stanford in home
runs and slugging percentage while playing solid defense. He has also appeared in three games as a pitcher for the
Cardinal, going 2-0 in his opportunities. Coach Mark Marquess has used various position players as pitchers.
many games on the hacks of double
digit run totals. They were shut-out
against Northridge, however, and. in
most of their losses, they have strug
gled to score more than three runs.
Their lineup, though, is fairly
strong: Alden Carrithers, Jermaine
Curtis, Brandon Crawford and
Casey Haerther — the Bruins' first
four batters in its order — all pres
ent tough challenges for Stanford's
pitchers.
Still. UCLA's strength is its pitch
ing. Tim Murphy and Gavin Brooks
lead a squad that boasts a number of
daunting hurlers.
"UCLA has a very talented team
and a couple of starting lefties in
their pitching rotation that are pret
ty good." Marquess said. "They will
be a formidable challenge for us this
weekend."
"They have great pitching,"
Phelps said. "They have talented hit

ters. They're a good overall team."
Stanford will send up a lineup
that has stars of its own. Ratliff and
catcher Jason Castro provide the
power, and first baseman Randy
Molina is the leading hitter on the
team. Phelps, perhaps the Cardinal's
most complete player, combines
power and batting average with stel
lar defense.
"I think Cord Phelps is one of the
best second basemen in the nation "
Marquess said. "He has had an in
credible season for us both offen
sively and defensively and is one of
the main reasons for our success at
this point in the season."
While these hitters provide the
brunt of the work for the Cardinal,
Stanford has also been getting key
contributions from its bench. Ju
nior first baseman Brent Milleville
— Molina's backup — has been
particularly effective in the past
two games. He won the game
against San Francisco with an RBI
single in the 11th inning and creat
ed some breathing room against
Santa Clara when he singled home
Phelps to give the Cardinal a 3-1

lead, which they would not relin
quish.
"We have had guys who can fill
roles throughout the whole sea
son." Phelps said. "Bench players
will be a big part throughout the
whole series."
As the Cardinal aims for first
place in the Pac-10, they will need
good production from all players,
both on offense and defense. Stan
ford currently stands in a tie with
Arizona State for first place in the
conference and will look to separate
themselves from the Sun Devils
against the Bruins.
Phelps highlighted the difficulty
of doing so away from the Farm.
"Playing on the road in the Pac-10
is always tough." he said.
Marquess concurred.
"This is a very important series
for both teams," he said. "We are try
ing to stay on top and they are trying
to get there. A situation like that al
ways makes for some very competi

try to make it 11 straight this weekend.



JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Center fielder Sean Ratliff has been a major reason for the Cardinal's success this year — he leads Stanford in home
runs and slugging percentage while playing solid defense. He has also appeared in three games as a pitcher for the
Cardinal, going 2-0 in his opportunities. Coach Mark Marquess has used various position players as pitchers.
many games on the hacks of double
digit run totals. They were shut-out
against Northridge, however, and. in
most of their losses, they have strug
gled to score more than three runs.
Their lineup, though, is fairly
strong: Alden Carrithers, Jermaine
Curtis, Brandon Crawford and
Casey Haerther — the Bruins' first
four batters in its order — all pres
ent tough challenges for Stanford's
pitchers.
Still. UCLA's strength is its pitch
ing. Tim Murphy and Gavin Brooks
lead a squad that boasts a number of
daunting hurlers.
"UCLA has a very talented team
and a couple of starting lefties in
their pitching rotation that are pret
ty good." Marquess said. "They will
be a formidable challenge for us this
weekend."
"They have great pitching,"
Phelps said. "They have talented hit

ters. They're a good overall team."
Stanford will send up a lineup
that has stars of its own. Ratliff and
catcher Jason Castro provide the
power, and first baseman Randy
Molina is the leading hitter on the
team. Phelps, perhaps the Cardinal's
most complete player, combines
power and batting average with stel
lar defense.
"I think Cord Phelps is one of the
best second basemen in the nation "
Marquess said. "He has had an in
credible season for us both offen
sively and defensively and is one of
the main reasons for our success at
this point in the season."
While these hitters provide the
brunt of the work for the Cardinal,
Stanford has also been getting key
contributions from its bench. Ju
nior first baseman Brent Milleville
— Molina's backup — has been
particularly effective in the past
two games. He won the game
against San Francisco with an RBI
single in the 11th inning and creat
ed some breathing room against
Santa Clara when he singled home
Phelps to give the Cardinal a 3-1

lead, which they would not relin
quish.
"We have had guys who can fill
roles throughout the whole sea
son." Phelps said. "Bench players
will be a big part throughout the
whole series."
As the Cardinal aims for first
place in the Pac-10, they will need
good production from all players,
both on offense and defense. Stan
ford currently stands in a tie with
Arizona State for first place in the
conference and will look to separate
themselves from the Sun Devils
against the Bruins.
Phelps highlighted the difficulty
of doing so away from the Farm.
"Playing on the road in the Pac-10
is always tough." he said.
Marquess concurred.
"This is a very important series
for both teams," he said. "We are try
ing to stay on top and they are trying
to get there. A situation like that al
ways makes for some very competi
tive baseball."
