## FCC CONVENES at Stanford Commissioners discuss net neutrality and restrictions by Internet service providers 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) convened a public hearing at Stanford
on Thursday to examine whether broadband
Internet service providers (ISPs) should be
allowed to restrict access to certain Internet
software applications.
Speaking at a public seven-hour hearing at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. FCC Chairman
Kevin Martin said that the commission would
decide whether certain ISPs are honest with
their customers about how they manage their
networks and if they deliver on the speeds
that they advertise. Martin said the commis
sion should scrutinize these two factors as it
decides what constitutes "reasonable net
work management practices" by ISPs such as
Comcast.
The hearing on the issue of "net neutrali
ty," the notion that all Internet traffic should
be unrestricted, comes after a similar hearing
held at Harvard earlier this year at which
Comcast reputedly paid seat-warmers to take
up space and prevent members of the public
from voicing their concerns.
"Application designers need to under
stand what will and what will not work on the
network, and consumers must be fully
informed about the exact nature of the serv
ice they are purchasing," Martin said.
"Particularly as broadband providers are try
ing to provide tiers of service, it's critical to
make sure that we are understanding that the
broadband network operators are able to
deliver the speeds and service that they are
selling."

Democratic FCC Commissioners
Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps
called for the agency to utilize its power to
prevent Comcast and other ISPs from unfair
ly discriminating against some software traf
fic, such as Bit Torrent.a popular peer-to-peer
file sharing program.
"Consumers have come to expect and will
continue to demand the open and neutral
character that has always been the hallmark
of the Internet," Adelstein said to an audi
ence of about 400 people. "The movement for
Internet freedom is tapping the same

American spirit that fueled the movement
against media consolidation."
Copps cited the desperate need for greater
competition in the broadband marketplace.
He said that effective competition would pro
vide incentives for ISPs to maintain neutral

and open networks and added that the FCC's
own statistics show that telephone and cable
operators control over 90 percent of the resi
dential market.
"[The] wonderful, open and dynamic
Internet — perhaps the most liberating tech
nology since the printing press, if not even
greater than that — is, in fact, under threat,"
Copps said. "We will keep it open and free
only by acting to make it happen. Its future is
not on autopilot and. indeed, powerful inter
ests would bring it under their control for
their own purposes; which may not be your
purposes."
On the other hand, Republican
Commissioners Deborah Tate and Robert
McDowell warned against additional and
costly government regulations. They said that
while the anti-competitive allegations should
be taken seriously, network issues were better
settled by engineers in the private market
place rather than by the government.
"The point is that the Internet has flour
ished by operating under the principle that

engineers should solve engineering problems,
not politicians and bureaucrats," McDowell
said.
Members of the panel testifying at the
hearing generally favored barring companies
from blocking subscriber usage even in the
name of controlling Internet traffic.
Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig.
founder of the Center for Internet and
Society, said he was worried about the lack of
competition among ISPs and that consumers
do not get what they pay for, arguing that
providers advertise certain connection speeds
but then do not deliver upon those promises.
"We are facing these problems because of
a failure of FCC policy," Lessig said. "The
FCC failed to make it clear to the network
owners that if they are building the Internet
they need to build it neutrally."
Lessig compared the circumstances facing
the Internet to a hypothetical situation of an
electricity grid that restricted usage depend

ing on whether the appliance plugged in
was made by Sony or Toshiba. He noted
that such an electrical grid would be pos
sible to build but that one would need
very strong arguments in order to con
vince the world to change. He argued
that the Internet should be considered in
the same manner.
Software quality engineer Robb
Topolski, whose initial discovery of
Comcast's methods of blocking access to
Bit Torrent ignited the net neutrality
debate, also voiced opposition to restrict
ing the Internet.
"It's the great firewall of China tech
nique," Topolski said. "And it has not
stopped. The behavior hasn't stopped."
Topolski explained that he also tested
Cox Communication's network and
found that they too were using the same
technology that Comcast uses to block

access to certain applications.
Comcast, with over 13 million broad
band subscribers, has previously publicly
denied restricting some applications and
said it simply practices network manage
ment to deal with congestion — a state
ment Topolski refuted.
The entertainment industry was also
represented at the hearing. Rick Carnes,
president of the Songwriters Guild of
America, noted his disappointed at how
filtering technology was not more uni
versally applied by ISPs to prevent users
from exchanging pirated and copyright
ed materials.
"Stealing music is not a victimless
crime," Carnes said. "I have seen it
destroy the lives of my friends and col
leagues."
Jean Prewitt, president of the
Independent Film and Television

Alliance, called for non-discrimination
policies so movies that were not associ
ated with the seven major production
studios could find an audience and inno
vate, citing the examples of independent
films such as Juno and Lord of the
Rings.
"We need to take proactive measures
so that Internet does not become the
closed bastion that television has
become," Prewitt said.
Regulations enforcing net neutrality,
however, were contested by some.
George Ford, chief economist at the
Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal &
Economic Public Policy Studies argued
that there was no evidence that requiring
network neutrality would encourage
competition, increase bandwidth or
reduce prices. He added that there are
studies that indicate the inverse is true.

"The issue for me is not that we take
Internet regulation too lightly but that
we don't take it seriously enough," Ford
said.
Michelle Combs, the vice president of
the Christian Coalition of America,
raised the issue that restricting access to
a certain applications can also block
legitimate material from being distrib
uted. She pointed out that while the
cable companies have a lot of pornogra
phy on their networks, the material that
was not able to be downloaded on
Bit Torrent and sparked the entire con
troversy was a copy of the King James
Bible.
"It offends me, and it ought to offend
vou," she said.
