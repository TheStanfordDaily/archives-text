## FCC CONVENES at Stanford Commissioners discuss net neutrality and restrictions by Internet service providers 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) convened a public hearing at Stanford
on Thursday to examine whether broadband
Internet service providers (ISPs) should be
allowed to restrict access to certain Internet
software applications.
Speaking at a public seven-hour hearing at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. FCC Chairman
Kevin Martin said that the commission would
decide whether certain ISPs are honest with
their customers about how they manage their
networks and if they deliver on the speeds
that they advertise. Martin said the commis
sion should scrutinize these two factors as it
decides what constitutes "reasonable net
work management practices" by ISPs such as
Comcast.
The hearing on the issue of "net neutrali
ty," the notion that all Internet traffic should
be unrestricted, comes after a similar hearing
held at Harvard earlier this year at which
Comcast reputedly paid seat-warmers to take
up space and prevent members of the public
from voicing their concerns.
"Application designers need to under
stand what will and what will not work on the
network, and consumers must be fully
informed about the exact nature of the serv
ice they are purchasing," Martin said.
"Particularly as broadband providers are try
ing to provide tiers of service, it's critical to
make sure that we are understanding that the
broadband network operators are able to
deliver the speeds and service that they are
selling."

Democratic FCC Commissioners
Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps
called for the agency to utilize its power to
prevent Comcast and other ISPs from unfair
ly discriminating against some software traf
fic, such as Bit Torrent.a popular peer-to-peer
file sharing program.
"Consumers have come to expect and will
continue to demand the open and neutral
character that has always been the hallmark
of the Internet," Adelstein said to an audi
ence of about 400 people. "The movement for
Internet freedom is tapping the same

American spirit that fueled the movement
against media consolidation."
Copps cited the desperate need for greater
competition in the broadband marketplace.
He said that effective competition would pro
vide incentives for ISPs to maintain neutral

and open networks and added that the FCC's
own statistics show that telephone and cable
operators control over 90 percent of the resi
dential market.
"[The] wonderful, open and dynamic
Internet — perhaps the most liberating tech
nology since the printing press, if not even
greater than that — is, in fact, under threat,"
Copps said. "We will keep it open and free
only by acting to make it happen. Its future is
not on autopilot and. indeed, powerful inter
ests would bring it under their control for
their own purposes; which may not be your
purposes."
On the other hand, Republican
Commissioners Deborah Tate and Robert
McDowell warned against additional and
costly government regulations. They said that
while the anti-competitive allegations should
be taken seriously, network issues were better
settled by engineers in the private market
place rather than by the government.
"The point is that the Internet has flour
ished by operating under the principle that

engineers should solve engineering problems,
not politicians and bureaucrats," McDowell
said.
Members of the panel testifying at the
hearing generally favored barring companies
from blocking subscriber usage even in the
name of controlling Internet traffic.
Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig.
founder of the Center for Internet and
Society, said he was worried about the lack of
competition among ISPs and that consumers
do not get what they pay for, arguing that
providers advertise certain connection speeds
but then do not deliver upon those promises.
"We are facing these problems because of
a failure of FCC policy," Lessig said. "The
FCC failed to make it clear to the network
owners that if they are building the Internet
they need to build it neutrally."
Lessig compared the circumstances facing
the Internet to a hypothetical situation of an
electricity grid that restricted usage depend
