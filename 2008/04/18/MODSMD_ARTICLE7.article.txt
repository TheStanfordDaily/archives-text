Last Thursday Jackson
Sierra *10 was on Capitol Hill to
attend the swearing-in ceremo-

Ny of his mother, newly elected
Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough).
After a life-long career as a prominent California
politician, Speier was elected to Congress in a special
election to fill the seat left vacant by the late Rep.
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo).
Winning an overwhelming 77 percent of the vote,
Speier became the newest member of the US. House
of Representatives.
"It was so exciting to be there," Sierra said. "I'm
very proud of my mom and happy for her. She has
had many trials and tribulations in her political
career, and I'm looking forward to seeing what this
experience does for her and the family."
Sierra noted that families often play a large role
on the campaign trail. Christine Foster '09, whose
father Bill Foster (D-Ill) was elected to Congress on
Mar. 8, agreed and highlighted the unique role that
children of candidates often play
"Being the child of the candidate puts you in a
unique place because you know the candidate better
than anyone else on the campaign staff," Foster said.
"You have the best intuition for what keeps him
motivated to keep making phone calls when he's
been doing it for the last seven hours. My dad credits
my brother and me in a big way for helping him
through the ups and downs that come with a congres
sional campaign."
But in addition to motivating her father, Foster
was heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of


EMILY VOGEL/
The Stanford Daily
his campaign as well.
"1 spent last summer at home to
work on the campaign," Foster said.
"Some of that was typical volunteer
work: phone banking, door-to-door
contact and getting up at 6 a.m. to cir
culate petitions at train stations.
Seventy thousand of my closest
friends and neighbors heard my
recorded voice on their answering
machines reminding them to vote the
night before the election. And, of
course, 1 did the same tried-and-true
thing eveiyone does to help win elec
tions. pounding the pavement, talking
to folks and listening to their con
cerns."
During Speier's two month cam
paign period. Sierra also became
involved with his mother's campaign,
most often making phone calls to con
stituents encouraging them to vote.
"This campaign was a unique [one]
in that it was held in just two months"
he said. "I called constituents in the
district to encourage them to vote.

However, being that the campaign
took place while 1 was at school, I did
n't get to participate as much as 1
wanted to. I'm hoping that the incum
bency holds precedent when my
mother runs for re-election this fall."
Acknowledging the considerable
time commitment, Foster said she is
unsure of the degree of her involve
ment in her father's campaign this fall,
given the challenges of balancing aca
demics with campaign commitments.
"1 will certainly come home for
election weekend," Foster said "But
while campaigns are great for learn
ing stuff, they're also pretty good at
taking your GPA for a ride through
the mud."
Foster said she had to retroactive
ly withdraw from all of her classes last
quarter because she became more
involved in her father's campaign
than she initially anticipated.
"Being a full-time Stanford stu
dent and working on a campaign is a
balancing act," Foster said, "and I'm
going to try to lean more toward class
es next time around."
In addition to the significant time
commitment campaigns often
demand, being the child of a candidate
presents other responsibilities as well.

Foster said that she has to con
stantly monitor what she says or does
in order to ensure that nothing could
be quoted out of context. Foster care
fully monitors her Facebook profile,
has changed her privacy settings and
disabled all public directory informa
tion to avoid harassment.
But she notes that the hardest part
of her job comes from the emotional
attachment to the campaign.
"I dislike listening to my dad being
lied about, or people twisting his
words so it sounds like he was in favor
of something terrible, when the point
he was making supported the exact
opposite," Foster said. "It's one thing
when it's a politician you like. It's
quite another when that politician is
your dad."
Sierra acknowledges that candi
dates' children can often find them
selves in a difficult position.
"Often a child can be very biased
because the candidate is not just
someone you support but your par
ent," he said. "I think emotions can
definitely get the better of you so
there is a limit of what you can offer
to the campaign."
Despite their pride and involve
ment in their parents' congressional

careers, neither Sierra nor Foster
intend to enter politics in the future.
"I'm more bent on following my
father's footsteps as a doctor rather
than entering the political realm,"
Sierra said. "I think this mostly has to
do with the circumstances around my
father's life and what really interested
me at an early age."
Foster, who is majoring in Science,
Technology and Society, also aspires
to have a career in science.
"I don't intend to enter politics as
a career," she said. "Some people can
tolerate spending seven hours on the
phone every day calling everyone
they know and begging them for
money. I'm not one of those."
Foster noted that though her
father is a politician, he neither
encouraged nor discouraged her from
pursuing a similar career.
"He did teach me to look at the
world from a scientist's perspective: to
keep asking questions about the
world, look at the facts first, analyze
really carefully whether the conclu
sion you come to makes the most
sense," Foster said.

"It was so exciting to be there," Sierra said. "I'm
very proud of my mom and happy for her. She has
had many trials and tribulations in her political
career, and I'm looking forward to seeing what this
experience does for her and the family."
Sierra noted that families often play a large role
on the campaign trail. Christine Foster '09, whose
father Bill Foster (D-Ill) was elected to Congress on
Mar. 8, agreed and highlighted the unique role that
children of candidates often play
"Being the child of the candidate puts you in a
unique place because you know the candidate better
than anyone else on the campaign staff," Foster said.
"You have the best intuition for what keeps him
motivated to keep making phone calls when he's
been doing it for the last seven hours. My dad credits
my brother and me in a big way for helping him
through the ups and downs that come with a congres
sional campaign."
But in addition to motivating her father, Foster
was heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of

his campaign as well.
"1 spent last summer at home to
work on the campaign," Foster said.
"Some of that was typical volunteer
work: phone banking, door-to-door
contact and getting up at 6 a.m. to cir
culate petitions at train stations.
Seventy thousand of my closest
friends and neighbors heard my
recorded voice on their answering
machines reminding them to vote the
night before the election. And, of
course, 1 did the same tried-and-true
thing eveiyone does to help win elec
tions. pounding the pavement, talking
to folks and listening to their con
cerns."
During Speier's two month cam
paign period. Sierra also became
involved with his mother's campaign,
most often making phone calls to con
stituents encouraging them to vote.
"This campaign was a unique [one]
in that it was held in just two months"
he said. "I called constituents in the
district to encourage them to vote.

However, being that the campaign
took place while 1 was at school, I did
n't get to participate as much as 1
wanted to. I'm hoping that the incum
bency holds precedent when my
mother runs for re-election this fall."
Acknowledging the considerable
time commitment, Foster said she is
unsure of the degree of her involve
ment in her father's campaign this fall,
given the challenges of balancing aca
demics with campaign commitments.
"1 will certainly come home for
election weekend," Foster said "But
while campaigns are great for learn
ing stuff, they're also pretty good at
taking your GPA for a ride through
the mud."
Foster said she had to retroactive
ly withdraw from all of her classes last
quarter because she became more
involved in her father's campaign
than she initially anticipated.
"Being a full-time Stanford stu
dent and working on a campaign is a
balancing act," Foster said, "and I'm
going to try to lean more toward class
es next time around."
In addition to the significant time
commitment campaigns often
demand, being the child of a candidate
presents other responsibilities as well.

Foster said that she has to con
stantly monitor what she says or does
in order to ensure that nothing could
be quoted out of context. Foster care
fully monitors her Facebook profile,
has changed her privacy settings and
disabled all public directory informa
tion to avoid harassment.
But she notes that the hardest part
of her job comes from the emotional
attachment to the campaign.
"I dislike listening to my dad being
lied about, or people twisting his
words so it sounds like he was in favor
of something terrible, when the point
he was making supported the exact
opposite," Foster said. "It's one thing
when it's a politician you like. It's
quite another when that politician is
your dad."
Sierra acknowledges that candi
dates' children can often find them
selves in a difficult position.
"Often a child can be very biased
because the candidate is not just
someone you support but your par
ent," he said. "I think emotions can
definitely get the better of you so
there is a limit of what you can offer
to the campaign."
Despite their pride and involve
ment in their parents' congressional

careers, neither Sierra nor Foster
intend to enter politics in the future.
"I'm more bent on following my
father's footsteps as a doctor rather
than entering the political realm,"
Sierra said. "I think this mostly has to
do with the circumstances around my
father's life and what really interested
me at an early age."
Foster, who is majoring in Science,
Technology and Society, also aspires
to have a career in science.
"I don't intend to enter politics as
a career," she said. "Some people can
tolerate spending seven hours on the
phone every day calling everyone
they know and begging them for
money. I'm not one of those."
Foster noted that though her
father is a politician, he neither
encouraged nor discouraged her from
pursuing a similar career.
"He did teach me to look at the
world from a scientist's perspective: to
keep asking questions about the
world, look at the facts first, analyze
really carefully whether the conclu
sion you come to makes the most
sense," Foster said.
