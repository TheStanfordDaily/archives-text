## MBAs crafting careers despite downturn Some grads seek jobs outside financial sector 
### JULIANNE STERN 
Students who receive an MBA during
an economic downturn can on average
expect at least a decade of lower earnings,
according to a recent study by Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Prof. Paul Oyer.
But Stanford MBA students say they have
yet to feel the crunch as they finalize their
post-graduation career prospects.
Oyer's study measured the effect of the
performance of financial markets on the
percentage of Stanford MBA students
who choose careers in the financial sector.
"When the stock market's doing well.

more of our Stanford MBA graduates go
to work on Wall Street than when it's not
doing well, and you can see that very
clearly in the data," Oyer said.
In years where fewer students enter the
financial sector after graduation, the aver
age earnings of the graduating class
diminish because financial sector jobs
generally pay better than jobs in other
sectors.
Oyer also found that students' decision
to work in the financial sector as opposed
to another field immediately after gradua
tion impacted their careers many years
into the future.
"If you look at those groups ten or
twenty years later, the ones that graduated
in a good time to go work on Wall Street
still work there, and the ones that didn't
have not made the switch," Oyer said.

Since students tended to stay in the
same sector for at least a decade, those
who graduated in bad economic years —
when fewer students chose to work in the
financial sector — experienced persistent
ly lower average earnings than their coun
terparts who graduated when the econo
my was doing well.
Oyer hastened to add that, although
the economy is experiencing a recession
this year, Stanford MBA students need
not panic about their employment
prospects.
"If you have an MBA from Stanford
you're in a pretty good position," Oyer
said.
