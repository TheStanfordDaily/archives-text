## MBAs crafting careers despite downturn Some grads seek jobs outside financial sector 
### JULIANNE STERN 
Students who receive an MBA during
an economic downturn can on average
expect at least a decade of lower earnings,
according to a recent study by Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Prof. Paul Oyer.
But Stanford MBA students say they have
yet to feel the crunch as they finalize their
post-graduation career prospects.
Oyer's study measured the effect of the
performance of financial markets on the
percentage of Stanford MBA students
who choose careers in the financial sector.
"When the stock market's doing well.

more of our Stanford MBA graduates go
to work on Wall Street than when it's not
doing well, and you can see that very
clearly in the data," Oyer said.
In years where fewer students enter the
financial sector after graduation, the aver
age earnings of the graduating class
diminish because financial sector jobs
generally pay better than jobs in other
sectors.
Oyer also found that students' decision
to work in the financial sector as opposed
to another field immediately after gradua
tion impacted their careers many years
into the future.
"If you look at those groups ten or
twenty years later, the ones that graduated
in a good time to go work on Wall Street
still work there, and the ones that didn't
have not made the switch," Oyer said.

Since students tended to stay in the
same sector for at least a decade, those
who graduated in bad economic years —
when fewer students chose to work in the
financial sector — experienced persistent
ly lower average earnings than their coun
terparts who graduated when the econo
my was doing well.
Oyer hastened to add that, although
the economy is experiencing a recession
this year, Stanford MBA students need
not panic about their employment
prospects.
"If you have an MBA from Stanford
you're in a pretty good position," Oyer
said.
Celia Harms, senior associate director
of Recruiting Services and Marketing at
GSB's Career Management Center
(CMC) agreed that Stanford's
MBA students were unusually well
prepared to deal with the fluctuat
ing supply of jobs in terms of eco
nomic crisis. Hie job placements of
MBA students graduating from
GSB this year have been largely
unaffected by the recent economic

downturn. Harms said.
"Our students really look very
broadly in terms of the positions
and industries they look for jobs in,"
Harms said. "GSB students have
always picked a very diverse range
of positions. They're insulated when
one sector is experiencing a down
turn."
Laura Brezin MBA '08 said stu
dents looking for careers outside of
the financial sector had seen little
effect from the economic downturn.
"As far as I can tell, it's mostly
confined to specific kinds of jobs,
especially hedge funds and invest
ment banks," Brezin said.

"Tilings are still pretty good for
Silicon Valley," Brezin added. "Lots
of my classmates are interested in
either working for a tech company
or doing something entrepreneur
ial."
According to the CMC, about 38
percent of the GSB class of 2(X)7
opted for jobs in the financial sec
tor. The rest pursue positions in con
sulting, technology, real estate,
health care and other business
related fields.
Harms said that many MBA stu
dents are offered jobs following suc
cessful summer internships between
their first and second year at GSB.
Because of this system. Harms
said, many employers focus on
recruiting first-year rather than sec
ond-year MBA students.This year's
graduating MBA students were
largely recruited last year, "before
the downturn in the economy really
hit hard," I larms said.
She added that first-year stu
dents should not worry about bear
ing the brunt of the current reces
sion.
Financial firms have "definitely
kept the pipeline very robust for
first-year recruiting in the winter,"
Harms said. "In terms of summer
internships we did not see a contrac
tion."
"We have very, very talented,
bright students, and because of their
extraordinary backgrounds, they do
very well in the job market, in terms
of looking for positions," Harms
added. "They're very gifted stu
dents."
Luke Baxter MBA '08 said he
was optimistic about his classmates'
job prospects.
"It's not a bloodbath," he said.
