## Group loses money on 'Millie' Ram's Head theater fails to break even after musical's closing night 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Following the closing weekend performance of
Ram's Head's spring musical production "Thoroughly
Modern Millie," the Stanford theater group announced
that it lost money on the show, but the group should be
secure for future productions.
According to Michael Rhaney '08, Ram's Head staff
member and producer for "Thoroughly Modern Millie,"
the show closed in the red at the end of its finale per
formance Saturday night. While Rhaney would not dis
close exactly how much had been lost on the production,
he wrote in an email to The Daily that the loss was dis
appointing given that the spring musical productions are
generally "very lucrative" for Ram's Head.
He added that a number of factors may have con
tributed to the loss.
"When the show first came out on Broadway,"
Rhaney said, "The New York Times' critic called it the
unmarketable show of all unmarketable shows. We
found this to be true in some ways: it was a very tough
show to market, and perhaps a college campus wasn't
the right venue for a show like this."
He also suggested that the show's performance
schedule may have been a significant cause of its com
paratively low ticket sales.
"It also did not help that admit weekend is a week
later this year than it has been in the past several years."
he said. "Ticket sales to admits have always been a good

source of revenue for us in the past."
He further admitted that Ram's Head was eager to
have an "all-out production" and the group made the
decision to spend more than usual on lights, sets and
sound equipment, the costs of which set the production
further in debt than usual from the beginning.
While the group took a loss on its spring musical pro
duction. Rhaney claimed that musicals are generally
"risky" financial ventures. Since Gaieties in the fall
always tends to make a considerable profit. Ram's Head
should be fine for future productions.
"We have seen losing years in the past and are pre
pared to deal with them accordingly," he said.
One potentially damaging area of the production
that Ram's Head seems to have averted was the contro
versy surrounding the play's content. Since its debut on
Broadway in 2002, "Thoroughly Modern Millie" has
been accused of political incorrectness for the portrayal
of its Chinese characters. Recognizing these concerns at
the onset. Ram's Head members met with representa
tives of Stanford's Asian-American Students'
Association (A AS A) to address the issue.
"Ram's Head contacted our group to talk about the
scenes with the Madame and the Chinese accent," said
Christian Ngo "09. core member of the AASA. "They
were very sensitive about that."
"One of our [core] members did see the play and he
thought it was handled very well," Ngo added.
Based on the 1967 Julie Andrews film musical,
"Thoroughly Modern Millie" is the story of a small-town
girl exploring the life of a flapper in 1920s New York
City while struggling with a love-triangle and a sinister
hotel proprietress who deals in white slavery. The
Stanford Ram's Head production ran from April 11-19.
