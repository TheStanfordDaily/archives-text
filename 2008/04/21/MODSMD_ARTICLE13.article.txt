# STUDENT LIFE
## Students vote in home primaries Residents of several states have yet to vote in primary elections

With the California primary' long past, gone are the
Obama flyers, political rallies and aura of unsettled
excitement. But some Stanford students are still eager
ly casting their ballots in Tuesday's Pennsylvania pri
mary', as well as those in half a dozen other states.
Though nearly 50 percent of Stanford's student
body hails from California, other students must choose
whether to cast a ballot in their home states or at their
local precinct. Eric Lau' 11, a native of Hawaii, chose to
vote in California's earlier primary.
"In Hawaii, most of my friends don't vote," Lau
said. "They think it's weird or something. But at
Stanford, politics is something you cannot ignore. The
atmosphere definitely increased the likelihood that 1
would vote."

Lau said the process of registering as a California
voter was easy.
"My hallmate came up and asked me to register.it took
a couple of minutes." he said.
The hallmate who encouraged Lau to register is
Sam Larson 11. a member of Stanford Democrats.
Larson explained that the organization mobilized to
encourage unregistered Stanford students to register to
vote in California or in their home states.
"We were told to recommend [to] out-of-state stu
dents that they could vote in California, and to remind
them that it was a very important primary," Larson
said.
Larson, an Oregon resident, also chose to vote early
in California. In retrospect, Larson said he wished he
had voted in Oregon.
"It would have made a bigger difference," he said.
"Plus, there are a lot of ballot initiatives in Oregon that
I missed out on."
Lau expressed similar sentiments.
"Next time, 1 am going to vote in
Hawaii," he said. "My friends and I
have similar beliefs but since many of
them don't vote, 1 feel like by voting
in Hawaii I'll be representing them.
My vote in Hawaii would make a big
ger impact."
Freshman Neveen Mahmoud '11
already chose to send an absentee
ballot as a Pennsylvania voter.
"I'm a part of 'Students for
Obama,'" Mahmoud explained, "and
when I saw all the hype of Obama I
assumed that he would win in
California and that my vote would
make more of a difference in
Pennsylvania.
Given the prevalence of Obama
support on campus, Mahmoud was
surprised by the senator's defeat in
the California primary.
"I had forgotten that Stanford is
just one small subset of California,"

she said.
She added that Stanford students
seem less politically engaged now
that the California primary has
passed.
"I am still getting inundated with
information because 1 am involved in
a political organization," Mahmoud
said. "But for the rest of campus I
think it's easy to not feel the same
excitement."
