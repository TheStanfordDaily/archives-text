## Editorial Board Elections Commission needs reexamination 
### 
Last week's ASSU elections were
marred by accusations of dirty poli
tics. As The Daily reported on April 9,
the junior class presidential election
swirled with a controversy over emails sent
out over the Class of 2010 email list. Atten
tion centered on Ryan Woessner '10, the
ASSU Elections Commissioner heading
the five-student Elections Commission,
who had to decide how to respond to alle
gations presented by both sides.
These politics left Woessner in an unen
viable situation. The candidates involved
were all sophomores, like Woessner. Any
decision he could have made would gener
ate hard feelings between him and his fel
low students, who he encounters around
campus, in his classes and in his dorm. So it
is hardly surprising that his decisions and
remarks failed to resolve the antipathy be
tween the two junior class slates.
Fundamental to fair elections without
hurt feelings is competent, unfettered and
impartial oversight. The Elections Com
mission needs to be restructured to avoid
nasty situations like the one that arose in
this election.
The most effective elections commission
would stringently avoid any potential con
flict of interest. Just as judges can withdraw
themselves from court decisions where
they have a perceived interest, the Elec
tions Commissioner should have a way to
withdraw himself from disputes between
acquaintances or his own class year's slates.
For example, the commissioner position

could be shared between two students from
different classes.
Perhaps a more sweeping overhaul is
needed. Given that the Judicial Affairs Of
fice employs a non-student staff, why not
hire a non-student Elections Commission
er? Also, if the Elections Commission were
to publicize clear-cut by-laws and guide
lines for how complaints are considered
and acted upon — not just what constitutes
a violation — candidates would be less jus
tified in questioning its decisions. The Elec
tions Commission as a whole, and not just
the commissioner, should have the primary
role of resolving complaints. Successful ju
dicial systems have institutionalized poli
cies, means of appealing decisions and
checks and balances for good reason. An
Elections Commission that more closely
abides by these tried-and-true policies
would ensure just and more pleasant stu
dent elections.
To this end, the Editorial Board propos
es the appointment of a committee, consist
ing of ASSU members, faculty, administra
tors and students, to review the setup of the
current Elections Commission and issue
guidelines establishing a new Elections
Commission — one that would have a sim
ilarly diverse mix of individuals from both
the student body and University staff.
Bitterness, accusations and hard feelings
need not be inherent in Stanford's student
elections. Better structuring of the Elec
tions Commission should prevent future
conflict.
