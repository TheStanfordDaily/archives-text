## Legalize it? 
### 
Recently. 1 started watching "Weeds,"
the darkly comedic television series
about a widowed housewife in an af
fluent L.A. suburb who sells marijuana to
make ends meet. And unlike what most ex
perts say about pot, "Weeds" is highly ad
dictive! For a show about dealing narcotics,
the amount of on-screen drug use is surpris
ingly minimal (Nancy, the mommy-cum
dealer. usually abstains). Instead, the action
focuses on the operational side of Nancy's
activities: running the drug business, ingra
tiating herself with local gangsters, presid
ing over her understandably dysfunctional
family and maintaining her active, guilt
free sex life.
Still, although the show is not overtly po
litical, one of its underlying messages is that
getting high (on marijuana) is not a big
deal. As the plot cuts through many layers
of society, from aloof trophy wives to strug
gling welfare moms, the recreational con
sumption of marijuana is a unifying thread.
The series neither glorifies nor criticizes the
widespread drug use that it presents; it
merely gives the matter-of-fact impression
that this is the way things are. In its relaxed
treatment of the subject, it reminds me of
conversations that especially ballsy friends
of mine had with their parents back in high
school: "Mom, look — everyone smokes
weed, okay? It's nothing to worry about.
Let's move on."
But like the well-meaning parents of
teenage potheads, the loyal viewers of
"Weeds" probably do worry about the ille
gality of Nancy's activities, even if they're
cool with the drug use. Nancy does have a
few minor scares, including a romantic tryst
with a man who turns out to be a DEA
agent. As he eventually points out to her,
however, marijuana dealers (and users?)
are not big enough fish to fry, especially
when compared to cocaine-smuggling car
tels or Afghani heroin farms. Nancy's real
problems come from rival growers and sell
ers in the area — the marijuana industry is
an especially pure example of laissez-faire
capitalism, in which any means, including
gratuitous violence, are used to gain the
competitive edge.
Because of the nonchalance of marijua
na use and dangers rooting from its illegal
ity depicted on the show, I often wonder if
the people behind "Weeds" are implicitly
advocating the legalization of marijuana.
The strife that the characters face comes
not from drug use, but from working in an
unregulated industry that is arguably only
criminal in the victimless sense. If only
there were a government-sanctioned and -
controlled marijuana trade, Nancy would
be able to conduct her business in peace,
without threats of extortion or retaliation,
and she could be assured a high quality
product from her wholesalers. Of course,
she'd also have to pay taxes, but the federal
government could perhaps use the money
from drug taxation to address relevant soci
etal problems like substance abuse.

Perhaps this seems a little far-fetched
for the U.S., but during a semester abroad
in the Netherlands last year, I was able to
see legalized marijuana in action. Of
course, 1 use the word "action" loosely.
When you tell people you're studying over
seas in the Netherlands, most imagine that
you'll spend the whole time stumbling
around the streets of Amsterdam on a con
stant space cake high — not exactly the
case. Although lots of stuff is legal there,
most of the locals choose to not to partake,
and they are a little irritable about the sex
drugs-rock-n-roll reputation their country
has procured in recent years. If you act too
excited about buying a joint at a coffee
shop, you'll just seem lame and touristy —
how embarrassing.
As a result of the "who cares" Dutch cul
ture, drug abuse in the Netherlands isn't
problematic or rampant. I actually found
fewer pot smokers over there than here,
and in some ways, the cultural taboos
against it are stronger. Advocates of legal
ization in the U.S. argue that the same
would happen here, and recently, Massa
chusetts Rep. Barney Frank announced he
is writing a bill to legalize marijuana pos
session in small amounts — he calls it the
"Make Room for Real Criminals" bill. By
decriminalizing harmless, and apparently
quite common, marijuana use, law enforce
ment could focus on preventing more dan
gerous crimes. Additionally, without the
mystique that makes illegal activities so in
triguing, excessive consumption would ar
guably be reduced.
Despite these arguments, however, it's
hard to imagine that U.S. lawmakers would
ever really go along with Rep. Barney's
plan, or be persuaded by the implied mes
sage of "Weeds." The cultural crusaders
fighting for traditional values are gaining
political strength, and legalized pot does
not exactly fit within their ideology. Some
people think that marijuana really is dan
gerous, both in itself as well as a gateway to
more destructive drugs, and even if its legal
ity has nothing to do with its consumption,
they feel that officially condoning such ac
tivities would be immoral, or something
like that. Of course, the ever-consistent U.S.
government does legally allow plenty of
other fun, dangerous activities, like drink
ing alcohol, smoking cigarettes, shooting
firearms and driving cars —at least we
have those!

Caitlin spent her April 20th hungover and
doing problems sets, hut perhaps yours was
more interesting! Tell her about it at
