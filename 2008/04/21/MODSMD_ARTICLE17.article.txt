In a few days, over a thousand ProFros will
flood Stanford with their nervous excite
ment and those bright red folders filled
with scary schedules and useless maps. Up
perclassmen will look upon the young faces
with a cultivated blend of tender amusement
and slight annoyance. Freshmen, no longer
the new kids on the block, will feel older and
wiser for the first time.
As the ProFros will soon learn, sometimes
it's easy to forget that Stanford was once a
goal and not a reality. And so, in the spirit of
Admit Weekend and nostalgia. I dug up the
college essay that I submitted to Stanford in
autumn of 2004. Reading through this makes
me wince a bit, as Fd imagine most of us do
when we look back at any of our past writing
â€” particularly pieces that are basically de
signed to promote ourselves to institutions.
Nonetheless, 1 find it a refreshing reminder of
how I wanted to be perceived, and, for the
most part, who I still am.
What follows is my essay as it appeared on
my application, sans the glossy, copyright-in
fringing photo of the Peanuts gang that 1 ob
tained from the Internet:
Fm just a bag of peanuts. Not the salty

shelled or the creamy macadamia. but the
ageless children of Charles Schultz who live
in bundles of ink and infamous holiday spe
cials (nothing spells Christmas like Charlie
Brown and his feeble tree). The Peanuts.
These characters form a more complete pic
ture of my being than any Kodak moment or
cultivated work of art.
The yellowed pages of the library's comic
books and the features section of the San Jose
Mercury News were the wallpaper of my
childhood. Only now, after years of reading
and a mistaken dabble into Garfield fandom,
do I realize that the members of the Peanuts
clan are all mirrors of myself.
Fm Peppermint Patty. Blunt, unassuming
and in denial of the existence of math. She
isn't afraid to wear pants and would probably

never even fathom the idea of hiding her
look-at-me freckles with make-up. My kind of
feminist.
Then there's Marcie, unobtrusive but close
to my heart all the same. I'm a Marcie in the
classroom, for 1 too am a proud hand-raising
geek, and up until a few years ago, I even had
the matching giant tortoise-shell frames to
boot (I still wear glasses, mind you, just small
er ones).
At first impression, Lucy is simply a high
strung, overly pragmatic disparager who
dominates every ink panel that she graces
with her blue-frocked force. Lucy, however, is
greatly misunderstood, and that is why I feel
so akin to her. Granted, I too am known for an
acerbic tongue and a frantic A personal
ity. However, both Lucy and 1 share a tender
side that is less exposed but vital all the same.
Lucy unveils her heart for Schroeder, a boy
more intrigued by ivory keys than her not-so
subtle advances. My sentiment is not directed
towards an unreciprocated love. Instead, my
vulnerability is revealed through my sobs at
sad movies, my natural instinct to pick up a
