# Op-Ed
## Network neutrality not so simple 
### 
Twenty-five years ago,when I arrived at
Stanford to begin studying for my Mas
ter's degree in Electrical Engineering,
there was no Internet. It was called the
ARPAnet.and it had just undergone a radical
switch from the outdated "Network Control
Protocol" to the newfangled "TCP/IP", which
is now lingua franca of the Internet. As I stud
ied, I followed the network's trials and tribu
lations— including its initial meltdown due
to overuse for file transfers — and participat
ed in a Stanford project whose goal was to de
velop digital radios. This work, along with
work done across the Bay at Berkeley, was
eventually integrated by NCR into a product
called WaveLAN, the granddaddy of the Wi-
Fi radios we all have in our notebook comput
ers today.
After staying in Palo Alto for several more

years. I moved to Laramie, Wyo., where I
started the world's first wireless broadband
Internet provider. That provider, LARIAT,
has been going strong for 16 years, providing
Internet service to rural areas that the cable
and telephone companies won't deign to
serve.There are now between 4,000 and 8,000
small, independent Internet providers like
LARIAT throughout the United States.
Seeta Pena Gangadharan, whose op-ed ti
tled "Can the FCC Fix the Internet?" ap
peared in Thursday's Daily, rightly warns of
the threat of a cable/telephone duopoly
which offers consumers no choice. Unfortu
nately, many of these well meaning activists
do not realize that the regulation that they are
advocating — including mandatory carriage
of bandwidth hogging, expensive and often il
legal peer-to-peer ("P2P") traffic — would

actually put the remaining small competitors
out of business, leaving consumers with the
very duopoly that they so decry. They could
also increase the price of broadband service
dramatically or make it financially infeasible
to deploy to rural areas. Advocates must
therefore tread carefully, lest they propose
"cures" that are worse than the disease.
Rather than micromanaging ISPs' busi
nesses. mandating that they not control their
networks or throttle P2P, or dictating their
business models or price structures, the FCC
should do three things. Firstly, it should make
strong rules prohibiting anticompetitive be
havior. Secondly, it should ensure that all ISPs
have access to the Internet backbone at a fair
and reasonable cost — something which has
