Diversity includes a discussion
of disability
To the editor,
It has been very encouraging to
see all the efforts in the last couple
of months to increase the student
and faculty diversity on campus. Di
versity Week, a week-long series of
events hosted by Stanford Univer
sity last quarter, was extremely
valuable in fostering important dis
cussions about the diversity of stu
dents and faculty on campus.
Underrepresented minorities
and people hailing from lower so
cioeconomic classes were discussed
extensively. However, the need for
Stanford to recruit and admit more
students and faculty with physical
disabilities was, unfortunately, large
ly ignored.
I have a special connection to
the physically disabled community
as I am physically disabled myself. I
have hemi-paralysis;my right side is
partially paralyzed. I have gone to
great lengths to find other people
with physical disabilities on Stan
ford's campus, but I have been
largely unsuccessful. There are few
undergraduate or graduate stu
dents with physical disabilities, and,
as far as I know, no professors with
obvious physical disabilities.
I went to the University of Ari
zona for one semester before I
came to Stanford University. At
Arizona, they had a state-of-the-art
Disability Resource Center. They
had various university-sponsored
athletic teams for students with dis
abilities, such as wheelchair rugby.

wheelchair basketball and wheel
chair tennis. Every building that
you entered or corner you went
around, you were almost certain to
see a person with a physical disabil
ity. As a result, inclusion of students
with disabilities was considered
when planning athletic activities,
social activities, dorm events and
field trips. I have not found that to
be the case at Stanford. Inclusion is
rarely considered because there is
little demand for it.
Take a look around our campus.
How many people do you see
rolling through the quad in wheel
chairs? What about waiting in line at
the Tresidder Subway? Or navigat
ing the Lagunita Dining complex?
Stanford could be a perfect place
for students and faculty with physi
cal disabilities. It is one of the top
universities in the country in almost
every department. It has a relative
ly accessible campus with top-notch
athletic and academic facilities.
And besides, we are blessed with
beautiful weather twelve months of
the year, compared with our East
Coast counterparts.
Many in the Stanford communi
ty may never have extensively con
sidered that Stanford has few stu
dents and faculty with physical dis
abilities. I would like to be the per
son who poses this inquiry to you:
Why are there not more students
and professors with physical dis
abilities on campus, and what can
we do as community members to in
crease that number?
