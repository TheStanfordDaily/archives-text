# CAMPUS LIFE
## Campus hosts Startup School Entrepreneurs and students network 
### ANNA DEARYBURY 
Six hundred entrepreneurs,
developers, students and Stanford
affiliates from across the country
flocked to Kresge Auditorium on
Saturday for the fourth annual
Startup School. This was the third
time the full-day conference hosted
by the Business Association of
Stanford Entrepreneurial Students
(BASES) and seed funding firm Y
Combinator has been held at
Stanford.
Startup School is an annual free
conference for people interested in
startups. The conference featured
ten big-name speakers including Jeff
Bezos, founder and CEO of

Amazon.com; Paul Bucheit, creator
of Gmail; and Marc Andreessen,
founder of Netscape.
Bezos's presentation revolved
around Amazon.com's evolution
from online book seller to supplier
of storage and cloud computing.
"Cloud computing" refers to a
method of sharing computing
resources in which technological
capacities are available whenever
users wish to utilize them.
Seats at the conference were lim
ited, so hopeful participants were
required to submit applications as
part of the registration process.
Along with motivating attendees
through invaluable advice from rep
resentatives of successful startups,
the conference also serves as a net
working tool.
