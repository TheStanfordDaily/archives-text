## Volleyball Cardinal falls in quarters 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's volley
ball team saw its season end on Sat
urday night in a three-game loss to
No. 4 Cal State Northridge in the
MPSF quarterfinals. The Cardinal
finished 17-11 on the year, matching
its best win total in more than a
decade.
"We reached our goal of making
the playoffs, and it was a great season
for our program," head coach John
Kosty said. "Our seniors did a
tremendous job showing the path to
the playoffs and what it takes to get
there in this league. It set the pro
gram back on track. The season as a
whole exceeded my expectations —
we wanted to make the playoffs, but
to finish league tied for fourth is a
great accomplishment."
Stanford (17-11, 12-11 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had won
three of its last four coming into the
conference tournament, but fell
short against the Matadors, who will
take on No. 3 Brigham Young in next
weekend's semifinal. It was the
fourth meeting between the Cardi
nal and Northridge this season, and
the Matador's third straight sweep
after a preseason Stanford win.
"With the sixth seed in the tour
nament, we came in filled with confi
dence," Kosty said. "But Northridge
played like one of the top teams in
the nation, which they are. The top
seeds all won — they were seeded
that way for a reason."
BYU beat No. 8 UC-Irvine to ad
vance to the next round, while No. 5
Pepperdine outlasted No. 6 UCLA
and will face top-seeded No. 2 Long
Beach State, who had a bye into the
semifinals.
Though the Cardinal served and
blocked well on Saturday, the Mata
dors' firepower proved too powerful
while Stanford could not find much
offense. The Cardinal had only 28
kills in the match, as many as North
ridge's top two hitters alone.
Four Northridge hitters tallied
double-digit kills, while freshman
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin
led the Cardinal with 10.
"It was very good defense by our
opponent," Kosty said. "They missed
a lot of serves but the serves that
were in were tough. It put their de
fense into a good position and we
struggled for a good sideout
rhythm."
At the start of the match, the
teams stayed close with each other
until three Northridge hitters com
bined for five straight kills to put the
Matadors up 14-9. Stanford came
back within a single point several
