## Volleyball Cardinal falls in quarters 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's volley
ball team saw its season end on Sat
urday night in a three-game loss to
No. 4 Cal State Northridge in the
MPSF quarterfinals. The Cardinal
finished 17-11 on the year, matching
its best win total in more than a
decade.
"We reached our goal of making
the playoffs, and it was a great season
for our program," head coach John
Kosty said. "Our seniors did a
tremendous job showing the path to
the playoffs and what it takes to get
there in this league. It set the pro
gram back on track. The season as a
whole exceeded my expectations —
we wanted to make the playoffs, but
to finish league tied for fourth is a
great accomplishment."
Stanford (17-11, 12-11 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had won
three of its last four coming into the
conference tournament, but fell
short against the Matadors, who will
take on No. 3 Brigham Young in next
weekend's semifinal. It was the
fourth meeting between the Cardi
nal and Northridge this season, and
the Matador's third straight sweep
after a preseason Stanford win.
"With the sixth seed in the tour
nament, we came in filled with confi
dence," Kosty said. "But Northridge
played like one of the top teams in
the nation, which they are. The top
seeds all won — they were seeded
that way for a reason."
BYU beat No. 8 UC-Irvine to ad
vance to the next round, while No. 5
Pepperdine outlasted No. 6 UCLA
and will face top-seeded No. 2 Long
Beach State, who had a bye into the
semifinals.
Though the Cardinal served and
blocked well on Saturday, the Mata
dors' firepower proved too powerful
while Stanford could not find much
offense. The Cardinal had only 28
kills in the match, as many as North
ridge's top two hitters alone.
Four Northridge hitters tallied
double-digit kills, while freshman
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin
led the Cardinal with 10.
"It was very good defense by our
opponent," Kosty said. "They missed
a lot of serves but the serves that
were in were tough. It put their de
fense into a good position and we
struggled for a good sideout
rhythm."
At the start of the match, the
teams stayed close with each other
until three Northridge hitters com
bined for five straight kills to put the
Matadors up 14-9. Stanford came
back within a single point several

times and tied the game at 24, but
could not take back the lead and lost
the game on a service error, 30-26.
Northridge again got ahead early
in the second game and left the Car
dinal playing from behind.The Mata
dors took the lead for good at 3-2 and
stretched that lead to double digits at
28-18. Stanford got only one more
point in the game as Northridge won
it 30-19.
The Cardinal put together its best
offensive effort of the night in the
third game — hitting .333 as a team
after posting a negative percentage
in the second game — but fell just
short of forcing a third game. Back
to-back McLachlin kills gave Stan
ford a two-point advantage, but
Northridge used a 7-2 run to get back
on top. Despite 11 ties. Northridge
held on and put the game away, 30-
28, with a kill.
"They came in with their A
game," Kosty said of the Matadors.
"By the third game, we started to get
into a good rhythm, but just couldn't
get over the hump. We were right
there and had some opportunities to
take the lead and take it into a fourth
game. They made a hitting error and
we got called in the net — it was that
type of game where we were playing
well but couldn't catch the break we
needed to get a little momentum
going."
Except for McLachlin's 10 and
sophomore opposite Evan Romero's
eight kills, none of the Cardinal hit
ters had more than three. The Cardi
nal hit only .192 as a team, compared
to the Matadors' .406 percentage and
57 kills.
Eric Vance led all players with 15
kills, while Cody Loe added 13, Isaac
Kneubuhl had 12 and Kevin McKniff
added 10.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran
finished with a match-high 11 digs.
Sophomore setter Kawika Shoji, a
second-team all-conference selec
tion, posted 22 assists and had one of
the Cardinal's two aces on the night.
Junior middle blocker Brandon
Williams had the other ace and also
tied with sophomore middle blocker
Garrett Werner with a team-high
three blocks. The Cardinal out
blocked the Matadors 7-2 in the
match and. though they managed six
fewer aces, made 16 fewer service er
rors than Northridge.

On the season, Romero led the
Cardinal with 426 kills. Stanford's
third-best season total of the rally
scoring era. Shoji's 990 assists put
him fifth on the single-season list and
he ranks third in the record books for
aces and digs in a single season, with
28 and 193. respectively. Romero and

Williams also made the top 10 in
aces, with 23 and 21. Inafuku ranks
just behind Shoji with 191 digs in his
first season.
Ceran graduates with the third
best kill and dig totals for a career
after being the team's second leading
attacker in his senior season. With
only Ceran and outside hitter Jesse
Meredith graduating and a large in
coming class, the Cardinal will look
to continue to progress next year.
"It's part of the Stanford way,"
Kosty said. "Our expectations will
raise dramatically next year. We saw
our team perform exponentially bet
ter than last year and we will expect
the same improvement next season.
We set lofty goals because of the pro
gram established over the last 20
years in the athletic department.

"By the third game, we started to get
into a good rhythm, but just couldn't
get over the hump. We were right
there and had some opportunities to
take the lead and take it into a fourth
game. They made a hitting error and
we got called in the net — it was that
type of game where we were playing
well but couldn't catch the break we
needed to get a little momentum
going."
Except for McLachlin's 10 and
sophomore opposite Evan Romero's
eight kills, none of the Cardinal hit
ters had more than three. The Cardi
nal hit only .192 as a team, compared
to the Matadors' .406 percentage and
57 kills.
Eric Vance led all players with 15
kills, while Cody Loe added 13, Isaac
Kneubuhl had 12 and Kevin McKniff
added 10.
Senior outside hitter Matt Ceran
finished with a match-high 11 digs.
Sophomore setter Kawika Shoji, a
second-team all-conference selec
tion, posted 22 assists and had one of
the Cardinal's two aces on the night.
Junior middle blocker Brandon
Williams had the other ace and also
tied with sophomore middle blocker
Garrett Werner with a team-high
three blocks. The Cardinal out
blocked the Matadors 7-2 in the
match and. though they managed six
fewer aces, made 16 fewer service er
rors than Northridge.

On the season, Romero led the
Cardinal with 426 kills. Stanford's
third-best season total of the rally
scoring era. Shoji's 990 assists put
him fifth on the single-season list and
he ranks third in the record books for
aces and digs in a single season, with
28 and 193. respectively. Romero and

just behind Shoji with 191 digs in his

Kosty said. "Our expectations will

Evan Romero had eight kills in the final match of the year for Stanford as the Cardinal's season came to a close last
weekend.
The No. 6 Stanford men's volley
ball team saw its season end on Sat
urday night in a three-game loss to
No. 4 Cal State Northridge in the
MPSF quarterfinals. The Cardinal
finished 17-11 on the year, matching
its best win total in more than a
decade.
"We reached our goal of making
the playoffs, and it was a great season
for our program," head coach John
Kosty said. "Our seniors did a
tremendous job showing the path to
the playoffs and what it takes to get
there in this league. It set the pro
gram back on track. The season as a
whole exceeded my expectations —
we wanted to make the playoffs, but
to finish league tied for fourth is a
great accomplishment."
Stanford (17-11, 12-11 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had won
three of its last four coming into the
conference tournament, but fell
short against the Matadors, who will
take on No. 3 Brigham Young in next
weekend's semifinal. It was the
fourth meeting between the Cardi
nal and Northridge this season, and
the Matador's third straight sweep
after a preseason Stanford win.
"With the sixth seed in the tour
nament, we came in filled with confi
dence," Kosty said. "But Northridge
played like one of the top teams in
the nation, which they are. The top
seeds all won — they were seeded
that way for a reason."
BYU beat No. 8 UC-Irvine to ad
vance to the next round, while No. 5
Pepperdine outlasted No. 6 UCLA
and will face top-seeded No. 2 Long
Beach State, who had a bye into the
semifinals.
Though the Cardinal served and
blocked well on Saturday, the Mata
dors' firepower proved too powerful
while Stanford could not find much
offense. The Cardinal had only 28
kills in the match, as many as North
ridge's top two hitters alone.
Four Northridge hitters tallied
double-digit kills, while freshman
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin
led the Cardinal with 10.
"It was very good defense by our
opponent," Kosty said. "They missed
a lot of serves but the serves that
were in were tough. It put their de
fense into a good position and we
struggled for a good sideout
rhythm."
At the start of the match, the
teams stayed close with each other
until three Northridge hitters com
bined for five straight kills to put the
Matadors up 14-9. Stanford came
back within a single point several

could not take back the lead and lost
the game on a service error, 30-26.
Northridge again got ahead early
in the second game and left the Car
dinal playing from behind.The Mata
dors took the lead for good at 3-2 and
stretched that lead to double digits at
28-18. Stanford got only one more
point in the game as Northridge won
it 30-19.
The Cardinal put together its best
offensive effort of the night in the
third game — hitting .333 as a team
after posting a negative percentage
in the second game — but fell just
short of forcing a third game. Back
to-back McLachlin kills gave Stan
ford a two-point advantage, but
Northridge used a 7-2 run to get back
on top. Despite 11 ties. Northridge
held on and put the game away, 30-
28, with a kill.
