## Stanford finishes second at the NCAA men's gymnastics championships last weekend at Maples 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most teams would be thrilled with a sec
ond place finish at the NCAA Champi
onships. But for Stanford men's gymnastics, it
was the biggest disappointment of the year.
The Cardinal men could only stand and watch
as No. 2 Oklahoma walked off the Maples
Pavilion floor with the NCAA trophy.
Stanford's second-place finish ended the
recent trend of home victories at the NCAA
Championships. Oklahoma won the meet
when they hosted in 2006. and Penn State
won last year in Happy Valley.
In preliminaries on Thursday, the home
gym advantage seemed to be working for the
Cardinal. Stanford qualified through to finals
with the highest score of the meet at 363.85,

more than four points ahead of the next clos
est competitor. The Card began competition
on parallel bars and struggled out of the gate.
Freshmen Ryan Lieberman and Josh
Dixon missed multiple skills, but their team
mates picked them up right away. Redshirt
junior Sho Nakamori had the highest score of
the day at 15.05, while senior co-captain
David Sender, junior Bryant Hadden and
redshirt junior Jason Shen all turned in very
good routines. I ligh bar was solid as well, with
redshirt senior co-captain Dylan Carney scor
ing a 15.1 to lead all scores. Sender and Dixon
kept the momentum going on floor exercise.
The duo tied for the best score of the day at
15.65, and redshirt sophomore GregTer-Za
hariants added a 15.55.
