## Stanford finishes second at the NCAA men's gymnastics championships last weekend at Maples 
### JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most teams would be thrilled with a sec
ond place finish at the NCAA Champi
onships. But for Stanford men's gymnastics, it
was the biggest disappointment of the year.
The Cardinal men could only stand and watch
as No. 2 Oklahoma walked off the Maples
Pavilion floor with the NCAA trophy.
Stanford's second-place finish ended the
recent trend of home victories at the NCAA
Championships. Oklahoma won the meet
when they hosted in 2006. and Penn State
won last year in Happy Valley.
In preliminaries on Thursday, the home
gym advantage seemed to be working for the
Cardinal. Stanford qualified through to finals
with the highest score of the meet at 363.85,

more than four points ahead of the next clos
est competitor. The Card began competition
on parallel bars and struggled out of the gate.
Freshmen Ryan Lieberman and Josh
Dixon missed multiple skills, but their team
mates picked them up right away. Redshirt
junior Sho Nakamori had the highest score of
the day at 15.05, while senior co-captain
David Sender, junior Bryant Hadden and
redshirt junior Jason Shen all turned in very
good routines. I ligh bar was solid as well, with
redshirt senior co-captain Dylan Carney scor
ing a 15.1 to lead all scores. Sender and Dixon
kept the momentum going on floor exercise.
The duo tied for the best score of the day at
15.65, and redshirt sophomore GregTer-Za
hariants added a 15.55.
Stanford struggled on pommel
horse, but finished the meet strong on
rings and vault. Freshman Tim Gentry
and Sender paced the card on rings
with scores of 15.45 and 15.7, respec
tively. On vault. Dixon stuck his land
ing and Gentry executed a beautiful
handspring double front flip. Sender
added a 16.2 to finish the session on a
high note.
Despite their success Thursday, the
Stanford men were confident they
could improve across the board going
into finals.
"I've done every event better than
I did today, in practice or in meeti"
said Sender.
"There's room for little improve
ments on every event," Nakamori
agreed, citing his "shaky" pommel
horse set and "landing problems" on
floor exercise as areas needing im
provement.
Hadden, who competed on five
events, said his high bar and parallel
bars routines needed improvements
going into finals. But he took the
team's slow start as a positive. Said
Hadden, "It's kind of good to have a
shaky start and so you can settle
down."
Volunteer assistant coach and for
mer Stanford gymnast Brice Rolston
liked what he saw from his team, but
cautioned against putting too much
stock in Stanford's performance in
preliminaries.
"This meet is all about [finals] to
morrow," he said,"but I think the guys
set themselves up well."
Oklahoma came out flat in prelims.
Head coach Mark Williams was criti
cal of his team's performance on high
bar and parallel bars, but the Sooners
got into a groove as the preliminary
session continued.
"We were much better on the last
two events," said Williams. "We need
to come out with a better start and
we'll be in good shape [at finals] to
morrow."
Friday's final session was hotly con
tested and came down to the final
event. Stanford began on parallel bars
while Oklahoma began on vault. The
Cardinal struggled right away. Shen
was up first on parallel bars and fell on
his second skill.
Head coach Thorn Glielmi was
shocked.
"I think Jason [Shen] just got a little

too excited and he missed his first or
second skill," said the coach.
Dixon and Lieberman followed
and continued to struggle on the
event. Strong efforts from Hadden,
Sender and Nakamori helped to coun
teract the freshmen's struggles, but
Stanford was forced to include Lieber
man's mediocre tally of 13.85 because

"We never got
into a groove,
never got
comfortable."

four of the six athletes must count their
scores toward the team total. The
Sooners outscored Stanford on the
event.
The Cardinal got on track when it
moved to high bar. Carney paced the
field with a 14.95, while Sender,
Nakamori, and freshman Alex
Buscaglia each had good sets. Dixon
bounced back with a great routine that
earned him a score of 14.85.
"Dylan has been a huge help,"
Dixon said. "We trust him because he
has so much experience."
Stanford was gcx>d on floor exer
cise and got another great set from
Dixon. The freshman scored a 15.7,
Ter-Zahariants added a 15.650,
Buscaglia a 15.3, and Sender a 15.2.
But Oklahoma got clutch performanc
es on floor, including a 16.0 from fresh
man Stephen Legendre. The Sooners
built their lead as Stanford was off for
rotation four.
The Cardinal moved to pommel
horse for the fifth rotation. Oklahoma
is weak on horse, providing Stanford
with a golden opportunity to climb
back into the lead. Unfortunately, the
Card was unable to convert.
Sender and senior Chris Harper —
who placed third on the event last year
— both fell during their routines. Be
cause a fall means an automatic deduc
tion of eight tenths, both seniors
scored below 14. Strong sets from

Nakamori. Ter-Zahariants, and fresh
man Kyle Oi kept Stanford alive, but
the Sooners built their lead going into
the final two rotations.
Stanford was strong on rings, get
ting clutch contributions from Gentry,
Hadden, and Nakamori. Sender re
ceived a controversial mark-down on
his dismount, but still scored a solid
15.5. Buscaglia missed his vault and
landed on his backside, but Stanford's
five other competitors came through
with great performances.The Cardinal
finished with a total score of 362.725.
Oklahoma finished the finals on
still rings.
Was coach Williams nervous?
"Oh yeah," he said. "I told our guys
that if they score a 64 [on vault] and we
score a 62 [on rings] like we did yester
day, we'll be okay. Then 1 went and
looked at the scorecard from yester
day and we'd only scored 61. Of
course. 1 didn't tell them that."
His athletes did not know or did not
care that they had to score a full point
higher in finals to get the win. Captains
Taqiy Abdullah-Simmons and John
Horton nailed their sets and secured a
win for the Sooners.
Nakamori was third in the all
around individual competition, and
Sender fourth. But the Stanford men
were clearly disappointed by the team
results, fheir heads were down and
faces long.
"We never got into a groove, never
got comfortable," said GUelmi.
Individual event finals were held
Saturday, and Stanford earned 13 Ail-
American honors. Sender was second
on vault and rings, giving him nine ca
reer All-American awards. His five
honors are the most in Stanford histo
ry-
Ter-Zahariants was fourth and
Dixon seventh on floor. Kyle Oi had a
phenomenal pommel horse set and
finished in fourth place. Oi began the
season fighting for a spot in the lineup
and finished as the number four pom
mel horse competitor in the nation.
"There wasn't anything specific
that happened," said the freshman. "I
felt great in warm-ups,and I just hit my
set."
Nakamori and Ter-Zahariants also
placed in the top eight on horse.
Buscaglia and Carney earned All-
American honors on high bar, while
Dixon added a seventh place finish on
vault. Nakamori was sixth on parallel
bars for his second All-American
award.
