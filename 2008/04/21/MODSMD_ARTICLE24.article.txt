# Stanford atop Pac at midway point
## Card takes two of three from UCLA to take lead in conference 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford opened the closet, but couldn't
quite reach the broom.
The Cardinal had the opportunity to
sweep its Pac-10 rival UCLA in Los Angeles
this weekend, but fell just short, as the Bruins
pitched their way to a 6-2 victory on Sunday.
Pitching was the theme of the weekend, as the
winning team in every game turned in excel
lent performances on the mound.
But despite missing the sweep, it was a
very successful weekend for Stanford, which
moved into first place in the Pacific-10 Con
ference by taking two of three from the Bru
ins. No. 10 Stanford had entered the weekend
tied for first with Arizona State, but the Sun
Devils dropped two of three at Oregon State,
allowing the Card to take a one-game confer
ence lead.
"It's great to be in first place in the stand
ings," said head coach Mark Marquess."But it
is a lot more important to be there at the end
of the year. We are playing good baseball
right now and we just need to keep it going."
Of course there is a lot of baseball yet to
play, but Stanford (21-12-2, 8-4 Pac-10)
should feel pretty well about leading the con
ference at the halfway mark, especially since
it was expected to finish in the bottom half by
most experts at the start of the season.
By winning the first two games Stanford
secured its 11th straight three-game series
win. The loss on Sunday ended a six-game
winning streak for Stanford and was the first
time this season it has lost on a weekend.

Friday: Stanford 4, UCLA 1

In the opener, Stanford jumped out to an
early lead and never looked back. The first
four Cardinal batters reached, and before the
first out of the game was recorded, Stanford
had a 3-0 lead. Junior Brent Millville (2-5, 2

RBI) hit a two RBI double to cap this early
rally, which was enough for the pitchers to
take control.
Junior Austin Yount, senior David
Stringer and freshman Drew Storen com
bined to hold the Bruins to just a single un
earned run on six hits. Stringer struck out
four in 2.1 innings and received the win —
Yount did not go the five innings required to
receive a win as a starter — to move to 1 -0 on
the year and Storen received his fourth save.
Storen was perfect after entering the game
with a runner on first and no outs in the
eighth.
Junior Cord Phelps had another great day
in the leadoff spot, going 2-2 and drawing
three walks to reach all five times he came to
the plate. Phelps and Millville had the only
multiple-hit days for Stanford. Sophomore
Toby Gerhart also drew three walks. No
UCLA batter had multiple hits and none
reached base more than twice. UCLA starter
Tim Murphy took the loss, falling to 3-4.

GAME NOTES; After taking two of three at UCLA this week
end, Stanford is now alone on top of the Pac-10. Before
losing on Sunday, the Cardinal had won six straight. This
is the second of four Monday night contests between
Stanford and Santa Clara. Stanford won the first meeting
3-1 last week.

Saturday: Stanford 6, UCLA 1
Looking to take the series without having
to play in a rubber game Stanford sent senior
right-hander Erik Davis to mound. Davis, out
of Mountain View High School, had already
set a career high in wins with five and had
pitched complete games in his last three
starts.
Make that four. Davis turned in the best
outing of his career as he went the distance al
lowing just one run on seven hits and one
walk while striking out a career-high 13 bat
ters en route to picking up his sixth win and
fifth in as many appearances. With the win

Davis is now 6-1.
"Erik was simply fantastic today," said
Marquess. "It's an amazing accomplishment
to have pitched four consecutive complete
games. It is almost unheard of in today's age
of college baseball."
It looked for awhile that Davis would have
to be near perfect to get the win as Bruins
starter Charles Brewer matched Davis into
the fifth, keeping the game scoreless. But with
two outs in fifth inning Stanford finally found
its bats.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Senior Randy Molina hit his third homerun of the season in the Saturday game last weekend. The
Cardinal took two of three in its trip south to UCLA.
Senior Brendan Domaracki de
livered an RBI ground-rule double
to put Stanford up 1-0. Junior Jason
Castro followed with a two RBI sin
gle, bringing up Senior Randy Moli
na with two on and two outs.
Molina connected on his third
home run of the year, making the
score 6-0 Stanford and chasing
Brewer. Brendan Lafferty came on
and shut the Card down the rest of
the way. Brewer fell to 4-4 with the
loss.
Castro (3-5,2 RBI), Molina (2-5,
HR, 3 RBI) and freshman Zach
Jones (2-3) all had multi-hit games
for Stanford. All seven of the Bru
ins' hits were singles.
Sunday: UCLA 8, Stanford 2
Stanford jumped out to an early
2-0 lead off of UCLA starter Gavin
Brooks, but couldn't get anything
going after that.
Brooks settled down and cruised
through the next five innings he
worked, allowing just one hit and
two walks while striking out six Car
dinal batters. Brooks showcased a
devastating curveball which the
Stanford bats simply couldn't find
an answer for.
Sophomore Jeffery Inman start
ed for the Card, and wasn't able to
hold onto the two-run lead he had
been spotted for long. Inman came
into the game 5-0 on the year with
an ERA of just 1.49. but struggled
out of the gate and lasted just 2.1 in
nings.
Casey Haerther hit a two-out
solo homerun after Jermaine Curtis
delivered a sacrifice fly, tying the
game at two in the first inning.
UCLA put up another run in the
second, taking a 3-2 lead into the
third inning.
The Bruins loaded the bases with
nobody out in the third before Tim
Murphy grounded out. scoring one
run. Inman was then relieved by
freshman Dan Sandbrink. Sand-

lowed by a Mickey Weisser RBI sin
gle before getting a fly-out to get
out of the inning, the score now 6-2
UCL.A. All six runs were charged to
Inman.
Sandbrink and Brooks traded
great innings on the hill until the
eighth, when Stanford finally got
something going.
Matt Drummond came on in the
seventh to relieve Brooks, and in
the eighth Gerhart and Castro de
livered singles to put runners on
first and second with no outs.
Milleville looked to deliver another
single, but shortstop Brandon
Crawford made an excellent catch
moving back into left field for the
first out. Junior Sean Ratliff
dropped a bloop single into left to
load the bases for freshman Ben
Clowe, but Drummond got him to
hit one on the ground and the Bru
ins successfully turned the double
play to get out of the inning.
UCLA scored two more runs in
the eighth to win by the final 8-2.
Inman got the loss — his first of the
year — to fall to 5-1.
