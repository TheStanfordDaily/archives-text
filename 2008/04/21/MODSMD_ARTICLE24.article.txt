# Stanford atop Pac at midway point
## Card takes two of three from UCLA to take lead in conference 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford opened the closet, but couldn't
quite reach the broom.
The Cardinal had the opportunity to
sweep its Pac-10 rival UCLA in Los Angeles
this weekend, but fell just short, as the Bruins
pitched their way to a 6-2 victory on Sunday.
Pitching was the theme of the weekend, as the
winning team in every game turned in excel
lent performances on the mound.
But despite missing the sweep, it was a
very successful weekend for Stanford, which
moved into first place in the Pacific-10 Con
ference by taking two of three from the Bru
ins. No. 10 Stanford had entered the weekend
tied for first with Arizona State, but the Sun
Devils dropped two of three at Oregon State,
allowing the Card to take a one-game confer
ence lead.
"It's great to be in first place in the stand
ings," said head coach Mark Marquess."But it
is a lot more important to be there at the end
of the year. We are playing good baseball
right now and we just need to keep it going."
Of course there is a lot of baseball yet to
play, but Stanford (21-12-2, 8-4 Pac-10)
should feel pretty well about leading the con
ference at the halfway mark, especially since
it was expected to finish in the bottom half by
most experts at the start of the season.
By winning the first two games Stanford
secured its 11th straight three-game series
win. The loss on Sunday ended a six-game
winning streak for Stanford and was the first
time this season it has lost on a weekend.

Friday: Stanford 4, UCLA 1

In the opener, Stanford jumped out to an
early lead and never looked back. The first
four Cardinal batters reached, and before the
first out of the game was recorded, Stanford
had a 3-0 lead. Junior Brent Millville (2-5, 2

RBI) hit a two RBI double to cap this early
rally, which was enough for the pitchers to
take control.
Junior Austin Yount, senior David
Stringer and freshman Drew Storen com
bined to hold the Bruins to just a single un
earned run on six hits. Stringer struck out
four in 2.1 innings and received the win —
Yount did not go the five innings required to
receive a win as a starter — to move to 1 -0 on
the year and Storen received his fourth save.
Storen was perfect after entering the game
with a runner on first and no outs in the
eighth.
Junior Cord Phelps had another great day
in the leadoff spot, going 2-2 and drawing
three walks to reach all five times he came to
the plate. Phelps and Millville had the only
multiple-hit days for Stanford. Sophomore
Toby Gerhart also drew three walks. No
UCLA batter had multiple hits and none
reached base more than twice. UCLA starter
Tim Murphy took the loss, falling to 3-4.

GAME NOTES; After taking two of three at UCLA this week
end, Stanford is now alone on top of the Pac-10. Before
losing on Sunday, the Cardinal had won six straight. This
is the second of four Monday night contests between
Stanford and Santa Clara. Stanford won the first meeting
3-1 last week.

Saturday: Stanford 6, UCLA 1
Looking to take the series without having
to play in a rubber game Stanford sent senior
right-hander Erik Davis to mound. Davis, out
of Mountain View High School, had already
set a career high in wins with five and had
pitched complete games in his last three
starts.
Make that four. Davis turned in the best
outing of his career as he went the distance al
lowing just one run on seven hits and one
walk while striking out a career-high 13 bat
ters en route to picking up his sixth win and
fifth in as many appearances. With the win

Davis is now 6-1.
"Erik was simply fantastic today," said
Marquess. "It's an amazing accomplishment
to have pitched four consecutive complete
games. It is almost unheard of in today's age
of college baseball."
It looked for awhile that Davis would have
to be near perfect to get the win as Bruins
starter Charles Brewer matched Davis into
the fifth, keeping the game scoreless. But with
two outs in fifth inning Stanford finally found
its bats.
