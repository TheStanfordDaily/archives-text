### DANIEL BOHM STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team took
two of three from rival California this
weekend to move its record to 40-8 on the
season.
After winning the first two games Fri
day and Saturday at home, the Cardinal
was unable to secure the sweep Sunday
when Cal designated player Bernice
Masaniai took Stanford starter Missy
Penna deep to lead off the bottom of the
seventh to give the Golden Bears a 1 -0 vic
tory.
Despite the home run, Penna was the
story for Stanford all weekend. The junior
right-hander pitched three complete
games for the Cardinal, allowing just five
runs in total to a powerful Cal offense.
Stanford won the first game of the se
ries Friday night in dramatic fashion,com
ing back from a 3-0 deficit to win the game
4-3 in eight innings.
Senior right fielder Anna Beardman
hit a walk off single to right center field
with one out and the bases loaded in the
bottom of the eighth to score Erin Howe

and win the game for the Cardinal.
After falling behind on a Vernae Sevil
la three run homer in the top of the second
inning, the Cardinal chipped away at the
lead, setting the stage for Beardman.
