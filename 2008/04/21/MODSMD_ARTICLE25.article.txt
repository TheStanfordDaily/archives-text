## Each squad has walkoff as Stanford takes two of three from rival Cal SOFTBALL 
### DANIEL BOHM STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team took
two of three from rival California this
weekend to move its record to 40-8 on the
season.
After winning the first two games Fri
day and Saturday at home, the Cardinal
was unable to secure the sweep Sunday
when Cal designated player Bernice
Masaniai took Stanford starter Missy
Penna deep to lead off the bottom of the
seventh to give the Golden Bears a 1 -0 vic
tory.
Despite the home run, Penna was the
story for Stanford all weekend. The junior
right-hander pitched three complete
games for the Cardinal, allowing just five
runs in total to a powerful Cal offense.
Stanford won the first game of the se
ries Friday night in dramatic fashion,com
ing back from a 3-0 deficit to win the game
4-3 in eight innings.
Senior right fielder Anna Beardman
hit a walk off single to right center field
with one out and the bases loaded in the
bottom of the eighth to score Erin Howe

and win the game for the Cardinal.
After falling behind on a Vernae Sevil
la three run homer in the top of the second
inning, the Cardinal chipped away at the
lead, setting the stage for Beardman.

of the fifth with a clutch two-out RBI sin
gle by sophomore ccnterfielder Alissa
1 labor to score pinch runner Autumn Al
bers from second base.
An inning later the Cardinal would
strike even with the Golden Bears on an
other two-out RBI single, this time off the
bat of Shannon Koplitz, which came just
one batter after an error by Cal shortstop
Taylor Kelly extended the inning and al
lowed a run to score.
With one out in the eighth, Howe and
senior third baseman Michelle Smith had
consecutive singles, followed by a Koplitz
walk to load the bases.With the Cal infield
drawn in, Beardman did the rest.
Stanford carried the momentum from
Friday into Saturday when it pounded the
Golden Bears 5-1.
Penna dominated the Cal offense, lim
iting it to just four hits and two walks, while
striking out ten in the complete game.
Conversely, the Cardinal took advan
tage of the wildness of Cal starter Brittany
La Rosa as it tagged her for three runs on
four hits and seven walks in five innings.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Missy Penna pitched every inning of every game last weekend for
Stanford. She won the first two before dropping the second at
Cal. Stanford is now 6-6 in conference play.
Stanford's offense was led by
Haber and sophomore catcher Rosey
Neill. who each provided a pair of hits.
Neill's two-RBI single in the bot
tom of the third gave the Cardinal the
lead for good, while Haber scored two
of the Cardinal's runs.
On Sunday. Stanford was unable to
solve Cal starter Marissa Drewrey,
who shut the potent Cardinal offense
out. while allowing just five hits and
five walks and struck out 10 batters.
No Cardinal batter managed more
than a single hit off of the sophomore
hurler.
Stanford left all 10 base runners on
base, which has been a problem for the
Cardinal in its six conference losses.
Penna was just as brilliant for Stan
ford in the circle, as she allowed just
four hits — three of them in the first
inning — and one walk in the com
plete game.
After allowing three consecutive
base hits in the bottom of the first in
ning to load the bases, Penna worked
out of the jam when the catcher Neill
caught Erika Racklin trying to score
from third on an errant pitch. She then
induced a groundout to Koplitz to end
the inning.
Penna did not allow another hit,
and only one walk until Masaniai
ended the game in the seventh.
The loss snapped Stanford's seven
game win streak, and six-game win
streak in conference. The Cardinal is
now 6-6 in the extremely competitive
Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford will try to start a new
streak when it takes the field again
Tliesday against the visiting San Jose
State Spartans at 6 p.m. After that, the
Cardinal will host the Washington
Huskies and the UCLA Bruins next
weekend.
