## Emergency notification planned Students required to enter contact information on Axess 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
The University has begun the process of
implementing an Emergency Mass
Notification System that will alert mem
bers of the Stanford community to emer
gency situations via simultaneous email,
voice and text messages. Since April 16, all
Axess users have been required to submit
their contact information and information
for an emergency contact before accessing
their accounts.
"The system will ensure that informa
tion is delivered as quickly as possible
directly to an individual... during inci
dents in which senior administrators deter
mine that the community, or a portion of
the community, is in imminent danger," the
University said in an April 14 press release.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman informed students of the Axess
contact information requirement in an
email sent on April 11.
When last revised in 2003, the
University's Campus Emergency Plan
included no mechanism for the extensive
dissemination of emergency information
to Stanford community members. The new
emergency notification system will serve
that function.
The system is designed to send email
notifications, as well as voice and text mes
sages, to members of the campus commu
nity. The system will be activated only "in
the event of a serious emergency" and at
the discretion of the University President,
according to Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Jennie Nicolayev.
Nicolayev cited Hurricane Katrina, the
Virginia Tech shootings of one year ago
and global concerns over a potential avian
flu epidemic as reasons for the introduc
tion of the system.
Hurricane Katrina struck and devastat
ed the Gulf Coast and New Orleans in
August 2005. On April 16.2007 a disturbed
undergraduate killed 32 other students and
himself at Virginia Tech in the deadliest
school shooting in U.S. history.
"Many offices on campus, including
Student Affairs, have been focused
on emergency preparedness for
many years now," said Nicolayev in
an email to The Daily.
In the past year, many colleges and
universities across the nation have
implemented similar emergency

alert systems.
Stanford's system was purchased
from an outside vendor. The
University declined to comment
regarding the cost of the system,
which Nicolayev characterized as
"complex and multi-faceted."
"I'm sure we all hope that we
never have reason to use it." she
said.
