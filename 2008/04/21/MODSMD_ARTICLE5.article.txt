# Hoover, Univ. team up to hire faculty
## Twenty faculty members hold "joint appointments" with the Institution and the University 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Hoover Institution has often been
portrayed as a think tank isolated from the
Stanford community. But many Stanford
faculty and departments have strong ties to
Hoover, and the institution has contributed
to efforts to bring top-level scholars to
campus and retain them.
According to Hoover's official numbers,
twenty faculty members at Stanford hold

"joint appointments" with Hoover and the
University, consisting of half-time positions
with each institution. These appointments
often cluster in certain departments: seven
are in Political Science, five in Economics
and three in the Graduate School of
Business.
The combination of opportunities pro
vided by an academic position at Stanford
and a research fellowship at Hoover has
proved to be an aid in recruiting faculty,
according to Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Richard Sailer.
"The option of a joint appointment at
Hoover can be a very powerful entice
ment." Sailer said.
'ITiis had led to collaboration in hiring
between Stanford and Hoover in the hiring
process, establishing ties between adminis
trators. The number of Stanford faculty
who hold some dual affiliation has
increased the integration of academic
departments with the think tank.
These strong ties have emerged mostly

under the tenure of current Hoover
Institution Director John Raisian, who suc
ceeded former director Glenn Campbell.
Relations between academic departments
and Hoover were acrimonious during
Campbell's tenure, according to many
sources, and Raisian worked towards
increased collaboration.
A crucial milestone for coordination
came in the early 19905. Stanford retained
Political Science Prof. Terry Moe
by shifting his title to a joint
appointment; Hoover simultane
ously moved Political Science
Prof. Barry Weingast from a
Hoover fellowship to a joint
appointment. Weingast went on to
chair the Political Science depart
ment from 1996 to 2001, and Moe
succeeded him until 2007.
"It was a budget-neutral, win
win deal," Raisian said. "Our rela
tionship has been terrific ever
since."
Hoover has also built strong
ties with other departments.
"We have regular, positive rela
tions with Hoover today," said
Professor Timothy Bresnahan,
chair of the Economics depart
ment. "There is a high level of
scholarly integration across
Stanford schools and departments,
and that means that scholars and
visiting scholars in Hoover are
tightly linked — as individuals —
to specific colleagues in econom
ics."
Those with joint appointments
often serve in leadership positions,
including Professor Abbas Milani,
chair of Iranian Studies, and
History Prof. Herbert Klein,
Director of the Stanford Center
for Latin American Studies.
Affiliations or joint appoint
ments with Hoover offer particu
lar advantages for conducting
research. Political science Prof.
Morris Fiorina came to Stanford
only on his third offer of employ
ment, and cited the opportunities
Hoover provided as a crucial fac
tor in his decision.
"A joint appointment quickly
takes care of your worries regard
ing a summer research salary and
a yearly research budget," Fiorina
said. "It takes away the thirty-one
hoops that you have to jump
through to get money from a foun
dation or the government."
"You can operate as an inde
pendent agent, and have the time
and the freedom to pursue your
own research," he added. "Faculty
tend to value time the most, and
for that the appointment is worth
a whole lot."
Professors who hold joint
appointments also emphasized the
enhanced scholarly opportunities
that Hoover provided.

"Hoover has a lot to offer,"
Fiorina said. "It's a very stimulat
ing environment, and there are
great opportunities to study public
policy."
Fourteen Stanford faculty
members also hold courtesy
appointments with Hoover. These
faculty members are considered
full fellows within the Institution,
and this arrangement allows
access to otherwise exclusive
events and opportunities. Their
ranks also include many faculty in
leadership positions, including
Prof. Russell Berman, chair of the
Department of Comparative
Literature, and Prof. Shanto
Iyengar, director of
Undergraduate Studies for
Communication.
"People can become a little
more involved in what Hoover is
doing," said Hoover Senior
Associate Director Richard Sousa.
"Most of our events are closed off,
and they can get invited. They
become a part of the Hoover com
munity."
Fellows at Hoover pursue cour
tesy positions with the Stanford
faculty as well, often to pursue
teaching opportunities.
"It gives me an opportunity to
teach and work with students indi
vidually," said Prof. Larry
Diamond, a Hoover Senior Fellow
and professor by courtesy of
Political Science who also holds an
appointment with the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
Hoover's National Fellows
Program, which brings scholars to
campus for one year, has also
enhanced scholarly ties between
the Institution and academic
departments.
"Over the years, we have really
benefited from the program."
Bresnahan said. "There are two or
three really good young scholars
across the street each year, and we
see them in seminars all the time."
Hoover has often come under
criticism from the student body
regarding a perceived conserva
tive affiliation. Sailer emphasized
that ideological affiliations have
not been a part of hiring decisions.
Faculty also stressed that ideologi
cal concerns did not play a signifi
cant role.

"Political science is a serious
faculty," Diamond said. "There are
a full range of people who hold
joint appointments, and there is a
fairly large amount of diversity in
thinking."
"To be honest, I don't even
know the ideologies of most of the
people within the department,"
Moe added. "The department
holds itself to a very, very high
standard, and there's never going
to be any serious consideration of
hiring someone for their political
background. We just want the best
scholars in the country."
But some see the potential for
political influence, including
School of Medicine Prof. David
Spiegel, who has been a key player
in the Faculty Senate debate over
the appointment of Donald
Rumsfeld as a "distinguished visit
ing fellow."
"There's a very complex review
process, and no one's worried
about anyone not being properly
vetted," Spiegel said. "But it's a
strange situation. Hoover is not
entirely separate, not entirely
independent."
"Co-funding appointments can be
a good thing," he added. "But they
could use that power to stack to a
certain ideology."
Still, many at the nexus
between Hoover and Stanford see
further possibilities for collabora
tion between the two institutions.
"I think the University doesn't
take enough advantage of
Hoover," Fiorina said. "I wish we
could do more to get involved in
undergraduate life."
For now, members of Hoover
and faculty emphasized that the
working relationship between the
two institutions will stay strong for
the near future.
"I think it's worked very well,
and we now boast a lineup of some
real superstars," Fiorina said.
"Hoover has played a very impor
tant role, and it's been a great
advantage."
"I think the integration contin
ues, and I think it will have a posi
tive impact," Raisian added. "This
has been a feather in my cap as
director, and I'm proud of it."
