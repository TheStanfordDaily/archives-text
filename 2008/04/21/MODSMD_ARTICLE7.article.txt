# 21 AND STILL GOING
## CARD TAKES PAC-10 TITLE IN WIN 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cal, who? In the Pacific-10
Conference, Stanford is all there is in
women's tennis.
And, for the 21st straight season, the
No. 4 Cardinal women proved it once
again by taking home the conference
title with a 5-2 win over California.
It never seemed a certainty, though,
as Stanford had a rough start to the sea
son.
In late February, Cal shockingly
upset Stanford 6-1 —their first victory
in the rivalry since 2003.
Since then, Stanford has had to
regroup and work hard to reach the top
of the perennially difficult Pac-10.
With postseason implications and
the Pac-10 title on the line, the intensity
of Saturday's match was certainly
amped up.

the postseason. The match on Saturday was
the final match at Stanford for seniors Whitney
Deason, Celia Durkin and Lejla Hodzic.

town.
"That derives from the fact that they
thoroughly embarrassed us at Berkeley
in February," head coach Lele Forood
said. "It's a match we always want to
win particularly — that never changes."
Despite four losses on the season,
