# 21 AND STILL GOING
## CARD TAKES PAC-10 TITLE IN WIN 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cal, who? In the Pacific-10
Conference, Stanford is all there is in
women's tennis.
And, for the 21st straight season, the
No. 4 Cardinal women proved it once
again by taking home the conference
title with a 5-2 win over California.
It never seemed a certainty, though,
as Stanford had a rough start to the sea
son.
In late February, Cal shockingly
upset Stanford 6-1 —their first victory
in the rivalry since 2003.
Since then, Stanford has had to
regroup and work hard to reach the top
of the perennially difficult Pac-10.
With postseason implications and
the Pac-10 title on the line, the intensity
of Saturday's match was certainly
amped up.

GAME NOTES: By defeating Cal, Stanford
secured a share of their 21st constecutive Pac
-10 title. All that remains now for the Card is
the postseason. The match on Saturday was
the final match at Stanford for seniors Whitney
Deason, Celia Durkin and Lejla Hodzic.
After all. it was Cal coming into
town.
"That derives from the fact that they
thoroughly embarrassed us at Berkeley
in February," head coach Lele Forood
said. "It's a match we always want to
win particularly — that never changes."
Despite four losses on the season,

season play.
the rejuvenated Cardinal squad re
bounded and got revenge on its cross
bay rivals.
"It's proved so many things,"
Forood said, 'it was just vindication
for our team that we weren't really
that team in February. I'm very proud
that we were able to wrap up our 21st
in a row — that is a big deal."
Certainly, much has changed with
the Cardinal lineup and mentality.
After a disappointing loss to Ari
zona State, its fourth of the season,
Stanford rallied to defeat the top
three teams in the conference: USC,
UCLA and Cal.
"I'm very happy with that and it's a
nice culmination of April where we
did what we had to do — we rebound
ed," Forood said. "We did a nice job to
come back from the Arizona state loss,
which kept us from the title outright."
Right now, the Cardinal is certainly
on a roll, winners of its last seven anil
13 of its last 14 matches.
"I think we have a lot of momen
tum," Forood said. "I think we're on a
pretty nice win streak lately and it's
important to focus on playing better as
a group. I think we accomplished that
and by virtue of doing that, we ran the
table on April with our dual match re
sults."
On a windy Saturday afternoon,
the festivities began for the annual Se
nior Day honoring seniors Celia
Durkin, Lejla Hodzic and Whitney
Deason.
With the help of a great crowd
turnout, Stanford preserved its home
court advantage, where it is now unde
feated in the last 132 contests.
In the match, Stanford command
ed the doubles point with victories at
number one and two, to take a 1-0
lead.
In singles, freshman Hilary Barte
finished off the regular season with
her 17th victory in a row at the number
one spot with a quick 6-1,6-3 win over

Marina Cossou.
Then on court three. Durkin com
pleted her regular season collegiate
play with a 3-6,6-3,6-3 win over Cristi
na Visico.
"It was a very pivotal match, clear
ly," Forood said. "She looked a little
tentative in her first set and not hitting
her ball with confidence as she can and
did in the second set. When Celia's on
a roll, she's a hard player to stop and
Visico found that out after the first set.
She is a great player when she's confi
dent about her game."
Sophomore Lindsay Burdette
would clinch the match with a 6-4.4-6,
6-1 win over Claire Ilcinkas for her
50th career singles win.
Junior Jessica Nguyen also defeat
ed the 2006 NCAA singles champion
Susie Babos 6-7 (4). 6-4,6-4.
"I think the win probably has to do
more with her feelings about her ten
nis," Forood said. "That was important
for her to feel better. I don't think she
played all that great, but she was very
gutsy and found ways to get Babos un
happy with her game."
"She found a way to win," Forood
added.
With regular season play wrapped
up, Stanford now heads to Ojai for the
Pac-10 Championships. Then, the
NCAA tournament begins where the
Cardinal will look to recapture the na
tional title inTUlsa.Okla.
"Our focus is to play well together
and we think we have a really good
team when we are able to do that."
Forood said. "We're going to Ojai with
a good mindset to have some good
performances there and then get
ready for the first couple rounds."
Given how Stanford is playing and
how much the team has grown, any
thing less than TUlsa would be an un
derachievement.
