## Green Library to stay open until 2 a.m. Administration approves extended hours for studying 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students working past midnight will
soon he ahle to crack open their hooks in
a new place, as Green Library will he
extending its hours.
ASSU Senator Eugene Nho '10, who
is the senate's Representative to the
Faculty Senate, made a presentation on
the issue last Thursday to the school
administration, including University
Librarian Michael Keller. After hearing
the presentation, administrators agreed
to fund a change in the hours at Green
Library, extending them until 2 a.m. for
Sunday through Thursday nights.
Nho cited student dissatisfaction with
late-night study spaces, especially Meyer
Library, as well as students' expressed
desire to have more time to work at
Green. He based his findings on a survey
circulated widely through campus email
lists, asking undergraduates about their
thoughts on study spaces and their study
habits. The survey received 1,467
responses within 72 hours.
"The change was motivated by
Eugene's presentation at the Faculty
Senate, specifically the survey results he
presented," said Provost John
Etchemendy. "We try to be responsive to
student requests when they are reason
able, widely felt and affordable."
In the survey, 83.4 percent of respon
ded said they were "unsatisfied or very
unsatisfied with the current past-mid
night study spaces." Currently, these late
night options consist of the first floor of
Meyer Library, Tresidder LAIR, Old
Union (until 2 a.m.) and students' dormi
tories. Nho also noted that "among its
peer institutions, Stanford is one of the
few that do not open their main libraries
for 24 hours or at least until 2 a.m."
While the administration committed
to funding the change, the timeline for
implementing the extended hours is still
unclear. Logistical details include ensur
ing sufficient staffing within Green.
"I can't say when the change will be
made," Etchemendy said. "As [University
Librarian] Mike Keller said at the Senate
meeting, part of the difficulty is getting
staff who are willing to work those hours,
and that may be harder than providing
the funding. Unlike a late night study
hall, keeping a large library open requires
a significant staff."
Nho said the push for extended hours
came as a result of strong student inter
est.
"We had a lot of complaints from stu
dents that there's not enough space for
post-midnight studying," he said.
"Personally I think this is a great
improvement in terms of student life in
the University."
Student reaction to the change was
mostly positive.
