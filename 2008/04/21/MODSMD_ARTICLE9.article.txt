### VICTOR L. SIMPSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) — Pope Benedict XVI cel
ebrated Mass and American Catholicism in sto
ried Yankee Stadium on Sunday, telling his mas
sive U.S. flock to use its freedoms wisely as he
closed out his first papal trip to the United States.
Benedict beamed before a joyous crowd of
57,000, hours after making a solemn stop to pray at
the site of the Sept. 11, 2001. terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center.
He called the Mass "a summons to move for
ward with firm resolve to use wisely the blessings
of freedom, in order to build a future of hope for
coming generations."
And he repeated a core message of his six-day
pilgrimage — that faith must play a role in public
life, citing the need to oppose abortion.
The unwavering truth of the Roman Catholic
message, he said, guarantees respect for the digni
ty of all, "including the most defenseless of all
human beings, the unborn child in the mother's
womb."The crowd applauded the line.
Worshippers filled the seats,chanting, clapping
and waving white and yellow handkerchiefs in the
Vatican's colors as the white popemobile pulled in.
At the end of the service the German-born Bene
dict again processed out slowly, serenaded by the
strains of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy."
Outside the stadium, two dump trucks filled
with sand blockaded 161st Street before Mass. an
extra level of security along with the heavy police
presence. Pilgrims without tickets pushed up
against metal police barricades, hoping to get a

glimpse of the arriving pope.
Inside, ad-splashed outfield walls were draped
in white with purple and yellow hunting. A white
altar perched over second base, and the papal seal
covered the pitchers mound, suspended by white
and yellow ribbons.
I have never seen Yankee Stadium so beauti
ful, and I have season's tickets," said Philip Gior
dano, 49, a tax attorney from Greenwich, Conn.,
who won seats in the loge section behind home
plate through a parish lottery. "It sure beats sitting
in my local church."
Added his wife, Suzanne: "I'm hoping to feel
something from (Benedict). Everyone who has
seen him says they crumple, their knees buckle.
You come away just feeling different."
New Orleans crooner Harry Connick Jr., on the
pre-Mass concert program, remarked that he is
often asked if he's a practicing Catholic.
"Practicing?" he said. "I'm playing for the pope
today."
Benedict seemed to enjoy his long journey to
the altar in the popemobile, waving to people in
the stands. From the altar, he stood to acknowl
edge the crowd's roar when New York Cardinal
Edward Egan welcomed him.
He praised the U.S. church, which has 65 million
members, in his homily, saying that "in this land of
freedom and opportunity, the church has united a
widely diverse flock" and contributed greatly to
American society.
The pope departed on a special airliner nick
named "Shepherd One" after a farewell ceremony
hosted by Vice President Dick Cheney, with De
mocratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham

Clinton and President Clinton in attendance.
"May God bless America!" the pope said before
departing.
Earlier, on a chilly, gray morning, the pope blessed
the site of the terrorist attacks and pleaded with
God to bring "peace to our violent world."
The visit by Benedict to ground zero was a
poignant moment in a trip marked by unexpected
ly festive crowds such as the one at Sunday's Mass.
Benedict was driven in the popemobile part
way down a ramp now used mostly by construc
tion trucks to a spot by the north tower's footprint.
He walked the final steps, knelt in silent prayer,
then rose to light a memorial candle.
Addressing a group that included survivors,
clergy and public officials, he acknowledged the
many faiths of the victims at the "scene of incredi
ble violence and pain."
The pope also prayed for "those who suffered
death, injury and loss" in the attacks at the Penta
gon and in the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in
Shanksville, Pa. More than 2.900 people were
killed in the four crashes of the airliners hijacked
by al-Qaida.
"God of peace, bring your peace to our violent
world." the pope prayed. "Turn to your way of love
those whose hearts and minds are consumed with
hatred."
Benedict invited 24 people with ties to ground
zero to join him: survivors, relatives of victims and
four rescue workers. He greeted each member of
the group individually as a string quartet played in
the background. In his prayer, he also remem
bered those who. "because of their presence here
that day. suffer from injuries and illness."
