## Coursework aids Syllabus site Integration of Web sites makes uploading syllabi easier for faculty 
### KELSEY MESHER DESK EDITOR 
The beginning of spring quarter
marked a renewed effort to make

course syllabi available to all stu
dents before and during the
"shopping" period. Faculty mem
bers are now able to post syllabi
on the Stanford Syllabus site

through Coursework, rather than
uploading syllabi to each site sepa
rately.

"They can upload to Coursework, and
Coursework will push it forward [to the Syllabus

site]," said Lois Brooks, director of Academic
Computing. "[Before the change] it was a double
upload for them."

While the change has no
affected the interface of either
Web site, the Coursework
team in Academic Computing
believes it will make posting
syllabi simpler and less time

consuming for faculty. Updates
made to syllabi on Coursework will
also be automatically updated on the

Syllabus site.
"This [change] was done by the CW [Coursework]
group to help with the one large challenge we ran
into with Stanford Syllabus — getting faculty to load

their syllabi there," wrote Geophysics Prof.
Rosemary Knight in an email to The Daily. Knight
was Chair of the Senate Committee for
Undergraduate Standards and Policy for the 2005-06
academic year, when the idea for the Syllabus site
was developed.
"During that year we considered various models,
and ultimately helped obtain funding from the
Provost to develop and launch Stanford Syllabus
\ in fall "06-'O7 — online access to all course syl-

labi," Knight said.
Brooks pointed out that the Coursework
| site restricts user access, while the stand-alone
Syllabus site was designed to be accessible to

all students, regardless of whether or not they
are enrolled in a course.

There are currently about 130 course syllabi
available on the Syllabus Web site. But

with over 1,000 courses currently on
Coursework, Brooks expects that

number to increase significantly

with the new change — if not this
spring, then definitely for the

fall quarter.
"I think it would be more
| useful if more syllabi were put
up," said Suzanne King '09,
"because as it is now, it's kind
of a hit-or-miss help-wise."
"The new system means
that all syllabi in CW are auto
matically fed into Syllabus,"

Knight added. "The more syllabi that are contained
in Syllabus, the more useful it will be."
