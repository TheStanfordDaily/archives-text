## Editorial Board A 						fresh start for a fresh set of faces 
### 
This spring marks the start of a new.
fresh set of faces in the Undergradu
ate Senate. Despite the varying hack
grounds of many of the new senators, their
campaign goals shared many common
threads. It is these common goals that the
Senate should begin with this quarter.
Old Union reform topped many of the
campaign promises over the last few weeks.
Candidates have differing ideas on how to
transform the student union, hut many of
these reforms are aimed at taking back the
Union for students. A few candidates have
discussed a better reservation system. Par
ticularly, an online reservation system would
allow students to track and reserve study
and group spaces more easily. While Old
Union has become a space on campus where
student groups and study groups can meet,
work and practice, promised equipment and
plans to make the Union more focused on
individual hang-out space have not materi
alized.
Another major campaign theme for the
new senators was reducing voluntary stu
dent organizations' (VSO) costs. Many stu
dents feel that the cost of running a student
group on campus overwhelms the good
work the group can do. Some senators want
ed to address this problem by increasing
communication with the Office of Student
Affairs (OSA). Others thought that a task
force should be created to look into why
costs are so high. Some thought that a more
transparent and reformed OSA could solve
many of the VSO's cost problems.
Calls for diversity at the graduate student
and faculty level were similarly reiterated
throughout many senators' campaigns. A
few want to build on the efforts of the "Call
to Action" Committee established during di
versity week this year. One senator has even
written a plan to tackle diversity at these lev

els. For some new senators, the focus of di
versity extends to more awareness of events
that shatter our comfort with diversity: Acts
of Intolerance. Ideas range from better pub
licity surrounding Acts of Intolerance to Act
of Intolerance programming during New
Student Orientation.
A final common theme throughout the
new senators' campaigns was a focus on im
proving the mental and physical health re
sources on campus. One new senator sug
gests expanding the Peer Health Educator
(PHE) program while another senator
would like more Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services (CAPS) sessions per student.
Other senators are concerned about birth
control subsidies at Stanford now that
Vaden's supplies are beginning to run out,
and one individual wants to increase the
confidential sexual health resources at Stan
ford.
A host of new senators also want to con
tinue the previous advocacy work in gender
neutral housing and international need
blind admissions.There have also been some
new and exciting ideas infused into the Sen
ate. such as creating a late-night weekend
transportation shuttle to San Francisco, ex
tending 5-SURE hours and holding a cam
pus-wide tailgate. Although some of these
ideas might not be feasible, they are great
starting points for thinking outside the box
about ways to improve campus life.
This new Senate has many common ideas
about improvements necessary in Stanford
life. The incoming senators should look be
yond their differing ideas on how to accom
plish these goals and focus on what really
matters: their constituency's needs.
