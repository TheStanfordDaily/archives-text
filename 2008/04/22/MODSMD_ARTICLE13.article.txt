# Pleading Inanity
## Weighty decisions 
### 
Unlike many of my friends who summer
with corporate firms, I never learnt the
lesson that "there's no such thing as a
tree lunch" because no one ever offered. Thus it
was with unbridled excitement that 1 sat down
at the Okahandja Lodge with its regional mag
istrate for some good, old-fashioned face-filling
and needs-assessing.
Twelve starters,eight entrees and a diet coke
later, 1 felt as though 1 had a decent idea of the
issues the magistrate faced in his line of work.
Like most of the others with whom we had spo
ken. he wished he had better access to Namib
ian case law and amended statutes, since both
high court rulings and legislation become
meaningless if they are not enforced. Work
aside, the magistrate also seemed to possess a
vague desire to be a little bit taller, to be a bailer
and to have a girl who Ux)ked good and who, he
assured us, he would call.
At the end of our interview, he invited us to
watch an afternoon of his court sessions to see
the real life workings of a Namibian courtroom.
I sauntered in and plopped myself down in the
third row. feeling stuffed but so happy that I had
drunk Diet Coke because if I had drunk any
thing else I would be such a fatty!
In the first case we saw.a man had violated a
court order to take a paternity test,a test that he
himself had requested that the court order him
to take.
In the next case, however. I was confronted
by a scene of drama that forced me to confront
the impact the law has on society's least privi
leged. The defendants on trial were juveniles.
Family members lined the first row. most in
tears. One's mother couldn't summon the
strength to watch and instead buried her head
between her legs, swaying back and forth in in
tense prayer — she was asking for the release
of her child on bail, to allow him to come home
and help support her, at least until his trial date
in July.
The kids shuffled uncomfortably as the state
laid out its case against them. They all had pri
ors. many of them violent: assault, armed rob
bery. resisting arrest. Most damningly, all of
them had been released on bail before, only to
return immediately to the hooliganism which
had brought them to the courthouse in the first
place.
On the other hand, they were young. If any
one can be rehabilitated and steered toward an
upright path, it has to be youth. Lucky for me, I
said the pledge of allegiance every morning and
was a Webelos in Boy Scouts, which introduced
me to jingoism, the ability to tie wicked knots in
other people's shoelaces and a blanket exclu
sion of homosexuals.
These juveniles had been lumped with
adults while awaiting trial, leaving them
uniquely vulnerable to physical and sexual
abuse.TTie cells are so crowded that when they

sleep on the floor, one cannot move but in coor
dination with all of the others. Every once in a
while, they signal to jointly roll over, and — in
the words of an esteemed University of Namib
ia Law School professor — "the husband be
comes the wife."
The regional magistrate adjourned the
court for an hour to render his decision. He
called us into his chambers and asked my col
league and me point blank, "Well, what would
you do?"
We were silent. Watching courtroom drama
was all fun and good, especially when adminis
tered by Chief Justice Joe Brown of the 2nd Cir
cuit of CBS-ville, but here we were being
probed by someone who literally held the lives
of those three youngens in his hands, which
were still greasy from the chicken wings he ate
to warm his palate up for his ostrich steak. I'm a
knee-jerk liberal who doesn't believe in puni-


Vishnu
Sridharan
tive justice, hut 1 knew that it we let
them out on hail, they would probably
be back in a heartbeat. It's not that
they were bad kids: they were just in a
tough spot: out of schix>l. with little
parental support, surrounded by
poverty. Yet, even if it wasn't their own
fault, they still clearly constituted a
threat to society.
You might wonder how the magis
trate ruled, hut maybe it's more en
lightening to just toss you the question:
what would you do?
