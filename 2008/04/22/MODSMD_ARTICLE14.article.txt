## The 						illegitimacy of caucuses 
### 
The American primary system is riddled
with problems. The Democratic presi
dential nominating process has contin
ued for over a year, and we still don't have a
winner — we likely won't have one for anoth
er couple of months. Most political parties in
other countries pick their standard-hearer in
six weeks or less. Also troubling is that some
voters in America have more of a say than oth
ers— lowa voters have certainly mattered
more than those in Kansas. The most absurd
problem with the nomination process, howev
er. is the easiest to fix. It is, you guessed it.the
use of caucuses in many of the states to deter
mine delegates.
Barack Obama has clearly dominated the
caucus states, winning all but one of them,
most of them by more than 20 points. He's
gained an enormous number of delegates this
way. While a victory based on superdelegates
for either candidate is certainly problematic,
winning an election due to caucus states will
be illegitimate, as well.
Caucuses are entirely and inherently unde
mocratic,even antidemocratic. Few people re
alize that caucuses are primarily fundraisers
for state parties, not rigorous determinants of
voters' preferences. Entrance to the caucuses
costs money, so state parties make money on
every voter. Yet they have been twisted by
small states and a drama-constructing media
into mattering.They shouldn't.
Caucuses reward candidates with a small

group of fanatical supporters rather than
someone with a broad base of more moderate
support. Due to the need for fanatical sup
porters, candidates are encouraged to pander
to small groups so they turn out and pay for
the privilege of supporting their candidate. It's
a wonder Ron Paul didn't do better in caucus
states.
Caucuses also hold voters to a far higher
standard than the normal, constitutional and
democratic style of selecting politicians used
in the general election. Participants are ex
pected to understand how the complex multi
round process works and how delegates are
allocated.The increased complexity and time
requirement, however, has not lead to an in
crease in civic dialogue and activism, as propo
nents of caucuses argue — turnout in most
caucus states has been below 10 percent.
The Nevada caucuses, which figured
prominently into Hillary Clinton's comeback
after an ambiguous defeat in lowa, were rid
dled with allegations of campaigns manipulat
ing the results and controlling the process at

individual precincts. The state party quietly
decided to have a do-over a few months later
due to the deeply questionable results of the
first attempt, all the while making bucket
loads of money for the second time in three
months.
The most sacred principle of voting in a
democracy is the "secret ballot," yet this prin
ciple is violated time and time again in caucus
es. In Nevada, all the main Las Vegas unions
endorsed Barack Obama. There were wide
spread reports that workers would not get
time off to participate in the caucuses unless
they held to the union line. As a result, every
single person in their precinct could see whom
they were voting for.
It's obvious that caucuses will remain a
part of the primary process for decades to
come, even though the vast majority of the
process simply acts to maintain established in
terests, namely that rural states like lowa be
come dominant players. What should matter is
which candidate is able to build a broad-based
coalition and turn out the most voters in a fair
process, not who is able to bring a devoted few
thousand, who have three hours to spare, to
the polls.

cuses, like the mythology surrounding the
Olympics, can he considered "insane." Let him
