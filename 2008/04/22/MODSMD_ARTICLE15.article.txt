Stanford offers opportunities that we will
never again have at our fingertips. In ad
dition to an award-winning faculty and
the best overall collegiate athletics program,
the University has constructed a community
of our peers from diverse national, ethnic and
ideological backgrounds. It's unlikely that
many of us will enjoy such privilege after
graduating.
A quick glance at the OSA's Web site or a
walk through White Plaza at lunch time re
veals how well we take advantage of these
opportunities. But amidst our impressive
array of activities, a gap remains: regular, stu
dent discussion of issues that confront our
campus, national and international commu
nity. Although several excellent campus pub
lications provide outlets for student thought,
there is no forum that promotes a live ex
change of views. That is a shame. We have all

of the ingredients for fruitful discussion: in
tellectual openness, curiosity and a broad
spectrum of beliefs. The only missing piece is
a central, inclusive and regular forum on
campus.
Recent events have highlighted the need
for this type of discussion. The appointment
of Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institute.
Michael Lucas's visit to campus, the concern
for faculty diversity and recent activism
about the Iraq War have revealed some of the
many controversies we face as a University
and nation. By encouraging students to tack
le such issues face-to-face in a public environ
ment, a regular forum would promote a vital
part of college life: the exchange of ideas.
Many have recognized the potential for
such a forum. Articles in The Stanford Re
view ("Editor's Note: Progress and Return')
and The Daily ("A Motion in Favor of a Cen

tralized Debate Forum") have already artic
ulated that need. Similar organizations at
Oxford and Yale have succeeded for decades
in encouraging political engagement on their
campuses. Noting the importance of student
discussion and the lack of a centralized forum
for debate at Stanford, our group — the
Stanford Political Union (SPU) — formed
last quarter.
Our goal is to facilitate debate and con
versation about campus, national and inter
national issues. To this end. we will organize
regular events centered around a pressing
topic relevant to our roles as students and cit
izens. We seek to create a community of stu
dents passionate about political life — but.
we will welcome the whole student body in a
relaxed and inclusive environment so that
anyone with a yearning to express their opin
ions on a specific issue has the opportunity.

A nonpartisan organization, we will host
town-hall style events that unleash the myri
ad opinions and perspectives of the student
body. Students with special backgrounds or
well-demonstrated knowledge of the issues
will be the primary speakers, challenging
each other and the student audience. When
the opportunity presents itself, we will invite
outside experts, controversial figures and
professors to visit and participate. We en
courage other student groups to use the
Union as a forum for speakers they bring to
campus.
Our first event is scheduled for Monday,
April 28 at 6:30 p.m. in Meyer room 124 —
the Forum Room. With the coming five-year
anniversary of President Bush's "Mission Ac
complished" speech. General Petraeus's tes-
