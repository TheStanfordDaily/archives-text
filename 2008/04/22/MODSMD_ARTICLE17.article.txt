# CARD BLASTS BRONCOS
## No. 5 Stanford tops Santa Clara 13-6, riding a five inning offensive surge led by Molina, Milleville 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Alter having a six-game winning streak snapped
Sunday at UCLA, the No. 5 Cardinal baseball team
started another one Monday night against Santa
Clara, walloping the Broncos 13-6 on the road at
Stephen Schott Stadium.
Stanford (22-12-2) scored all 13 of its runs in a five
inning span. But the Broncos first leapt out to a 1-0
lead in the first when left fielder Evan Leßlanc hit a
solo homerun with one out. Junior second baseman
Cord Phelps put the Cardinal on the board with a pair
of RBI on a hit to left in the third before being picked
off on the play. The Broncos answered back in the

bottom half of the inning scoring
four runs on three singles, a stolen
base and catcher Tommy Medica's
three-run homer.
Stanford took hold in the fol
lowing four innings, though, scor
ing 11 unanswered runs in those
frames. Junior first baseman pre
cipitated the Cardinal rally with a
grand slam in the fifth inning. Se
nior DH Randy Molina followed
that up with a two-run shot of his
own as the Cardinal scored six
runs in the inning.
Molina would go on to pick up
another three RBI in the sixth on a
double to left field. That largely
capped off the scoring for the
night, as Stanford would only go
on to record a single run in the sev
enth while Santa Clara would an
swer with a run in the eighth. The
13-run effort was good for Stan
ford's second best offensive out
put of the season, capped only by
Feb. 22's 17-7 win over Nebraska
in the first game of the 2008 sea
son.
"I think we all did a great job
relaxing and just seeing the ball
today," Milleville said. "We had
struggled with off-speed pitches on
Sunday and we were able to adjust
today. 1 thought we did a good job
using all parts of the field and that
helped us a lot."
Another key contributor to the
Cardinal's second win of the season
over the Broncos was senior right
hander David Stringer, who
pitched four scoreless innings of
two-hit baseball in relief of starter
freshman Michael Marshall.
"Stringer has closed games for
us and started games for us in his
career," Milleville said. "[T]hat ver
satility makes him really valuable
to us. He can give us four, five or six
innings or shut them down in the
ninth. He is a huge part of this staff
and this team"
It was Milleville and Molina,
though, who starred offensively for
the Cardinal, a duo which has
rarely seen much action at the same
time this season, an issue Milleville
ultimately sees as a blessing for the
team.

"A lot of guys have had to wait
to get at-bats because we have so
much depth." he said. "That is the
great thing about playing on this
team — there is just so much
depth. It can be tough sometimes,
but you get used to it and 1 think
[Molina and I] have a lot of experi
ence coming off the bench and

at it."
The Cardinal currently leads the

record, just one game ahead of Ari

Alter having a six-game winning streak snapped
Sunday at UCLA, the No. 5 Cardinal baseball team
started another one Monday night against Santa
Clara, walloping the Broncos 13-6 on the road at
Stephen Schott Stadium.
Stanford (22-12-2) scored all 13 of its runs in a five
inning span. But the Broncos first leapt out to a 1-0
lead in the first when left fielder Evan Leßlanc hit a
solo homerun with one out. Junior second baseman
Cord Phelps put the Cardinal on the board with a pair
of RBI on a hit to left in the third before being picked
off on the play. The Broncos answered back in the

bottom half of the inning scoring
four runs on three singles, a stolen
base and catcher Tommy Medica's
three-run homer.
Stanford took hold in the fol
lowing four innings, though, scor
ing 11 unanswered runs in those
frames. Junior first baseman pre
cipitated the Cardinal rally with a
grand slam in the fifth inning. Se
nior DH Randy Molina followed
that up with a two-run shot of his
own as the Cardinal scored six
runs in the inning.
Molina would go on to pick up
another three RBI in the sixth on a
double to left field. That largely
capped off the scoring for the
night, as Stanford would only go
on to record a single run in the sev
enth while Santa Clara would an
swer with a run in the eighth. The
13-run effort was good for Stan
ford's second best offensive out
put of the season, capped only by
Feb. 22's 17-7 win over Nebraska
in the first game of the 2008 sea
son.
"I think we all did a great job
relaxing and just seeing the ball
today," Milleville said. "We had
struggled with off-speed pitches on
Sunday and we were able to adjust
today. 1 thought we did a good job
using all parts of the field and that
helped us a lot."
Another key contributor to the
Cardinal's second win of the season
over the Broncos was senior right
hander David Stringer, who
pitched four scoreless innings of
two-hit baseball in relief of starter
freshman Michael Marshall.
"Stringer has closed games for
us and started games for us in his
career," Milleville said. "[T]hat ver
satility makes him really valuable
to us. He can give us four, five or six
innings or shut them down in the
ninth. He is a huge part of this staff
and this team"
It was Milleville and Molina,
though, who starred offensively for
the Cardinal, a duo which has
rarely seen much action at the same
time this season, an issue Milleville
ultimately sees as a blessing for the
team.
