## Catching on in the NFL Draft 
### 
As the NFL Draft approaches,
the talk naturally centers
around the big-name
prospects. Names like Michigan of
fensive tackle Jake Long, Arkansas
running back Darren McFadden and
Boston College quarterback Matt
Ryan are on the minds of every ana
lyst as athletes that entire franchises
may someday be built around.
But as teams head deeper into the
draft, the players selected may not
hold the same resonance with NFL
fans. Heads will be scratched, re
motes will be thrown, and a collec
tive cry of "WHO??" will rain down
from the rooftops.
Unless he's drafted by the 49ers,
Raiders or Chargers, Stanford wide
receiver Mark Bradford might elicit
such a response. But before you
knock over the drinks and splatter
the salsa, let me present the case for
the Cardinal receiver.
Every team will he in the market
for a wideout that runs impeccable
routes and has hands of glue. Too
many receivers with sky-high poten
tial fizzle out of the league because
they can't hold onto the ball or run
the right play. But this simply isn't a
concern with Bradford — his me
chanics have been thoroughly honed
during his five years on the Farm.
Scouts also dissect jumping abili
ty, and there are few who can leap as
high or at so precisely the right in
stant as Bradford. His vertical jump
was the fourth best among the 53
wide receivers who participated in
the NFL Combine, the premiere pre-
Draft scouting event held annually in
Indianapolis, Ind.
His skills are already well known
to Stanford fans, at least, and are
nowhere better epitomized than in
his now-iconic touchdown reception
to propel the Cardinal over USC last
October. Bradford's leaping grab
over a Trojan cornerback to win the
game for Stanford could, perhaps, go
down as the single greatest touch
down in the University's history
But enough nostalgia. Besides his
hands, route running, hops and place
in Stanford lore, why is Bradford
right for your team?
Let's look at his measurables,
since draftniks around the country
obsess over them from the moment
they're recorded until the end of a
player's entire career. Bradford's are
comparable with many of his peers.
He is remarkably strong — he bench
pressed 225 pounds 19 times at the
Combine, to place seventh amongst
all wideouts. A receiver's strength is
key to his success, as he will need to
deal with coverage as soon as the ball
is snapped, and, after the pigskin is in
his hands, he will need the power to
take on potential tacklers.
Bradford's speed often comes
into question. His critics say that he's
not fast enough to break away from
defenders during routes or after he's
