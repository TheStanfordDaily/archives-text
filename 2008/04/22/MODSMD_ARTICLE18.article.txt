## Catching on in the NFL Draft 
### 
As the NFL Draft approaches,
the talk naturally centers
around the big-name
prospects. Names like Michigan of
fensive tackle Jake Long, Arkansas
running back Darren McFadden and
Boston College quarterback Matt
Ryan are on the minds of every ana
lyst as athletes that entire franchises
may someday be built around.
But as teams head deeper into the
draft, the players selected may not
hold the same resonance with NFL
fans. Heads will be scratched, re
motes will be thrown, and a collec
tive cry of "WHO??" will rain down
from the rooftops.
Unless he's drafted by the 49ers,
Raiders or Chargers, Stanford wide
receiver Mark Bradford might elicit
such a response. But before you
knock over the drinks and splatter
the salsa, let me present the case for
the Cardinal receiver.
Every team will he in the market
for a wideout that runs impeccable
routes and has hands of glue. Too
many receivers with sky-high poten
tial fizzle out of the league because
they can't hold onto the ball or run
the right play. But this simply isn't a
concern with Bradford — his me
chanics have been thoroughly honed
during his five years on the Farm.
Scouts also dissect jumping abili
ty, and there are few who can leap as
high or at so precisely the right in
stant as Bradford. His vertical jump
was the fourth best among the 53
wide receivers who participated in
the NFL Combine, the premiere pre-
Draft scouting event held annually in
Indianapolis, Ind.
His skills are already well known
to Stanford fans, at least, and are
nowhere better epitomized than in
his now-iconic touchdown reception
to propel the Cardinal over USC last
October. Bradford's leaping grab
over a Trojan cornerback to win the
game for Stanford could, perhaps, go
down as the single greatest touch
down in the University's history
But enough nostalgia. Besides his
hands, route running, hops and place
in Stanford lore, why is Bradford
right for your team?
Let's look at his measurables,
since draftniks around the country
obsess over them from the moment
they're recorded until the end of a
player's entire career. Bradford's are
comparable with many of his peers.
He is remarkably strong — he bench
pressed 225 pounds 19 times at the
Combine, to place seventh amongst
all wideouts. A receiver's strength is
key to his success, as he will need to
deal with coverage as soon as the ball
is snapped, and, after the pigskin is in
his hands, he will need the power to
take on potential tacklers.
Bradford's speed often comes
into question. His critics say that he's
not fast enough to break away from
defenders during routes or after he's
caught the ball. His poor running
performance at the Combine helped
reinforce this conception — his 4.69
40-yard dash and 4.47 short shuttle
were amongst the worst for wide re
ceivers. However, at Stanford's pro
day last month, Bradford may have
alleviated those concerns by running
a 4.49 40 and a 4.26 shuttle, both of
which would have placed him near
the top 10 at the Combine. A quick
look at game tape shows that while
Bradford may not be a burner, he
has more than enough speed to cre
ate separation between him and his
man.
In addition to mechanics and
measurables, character has become
of increasing importance to NFL
scouts. As guys like Chris Henry and
Pac-Man Jones squander their talent
with arrest after arrest, teams are be
ginning to look past a player's poten
tial if their attitude and actions
aren't kept in check. And beyond
law-breaking, general managers
want cohesion; they're willing to jet
tison stars such as Randy Moss on
the cheap if they make too much of a
scene.
Bradford not only has his head
squarely on his shoulders, but has
been a true team leader in his time
on the Farm. His passion comes
through in his play, and he's rarely, if
ever, temperamental. His team
mates and coaches love him. He has
n't gotten into any notable trouble
and is smart enough to learn whatev

er playbook is presented to him.
Character is too often a concern with
prospects; with Bradford, it should
be a plus.
There are few wideouts as well
rounded as Bradford in the draft.
Among the top receivers in the
draft, Michigan State's Devin
Thomas runs sloppy routes; Okla
homa's Malcolm Kelly has chronic
knee and character issues; and Cal's
Desean Jackson's strength is a con
cern.
But Bradford has very few prob
lems to speak of — those that have
been presented have fairly simple
answers. The first is that Bradford
didn't produce enough in college.
But the Cardinal had a revolving
door of quarterbacks during his time
on the Farm. Even worse, he played
under three different coaches, all
with different schemes. And still,
Bradford had a record-setting fresh
man season, and, despite coming off
a season-ending injury in 2006 —
another concern for scouts — came
full circle by leading the Cardinal in
receiving in 2007.
NFL teams may be enticed by
Thomas's potential. They may be
willing to look past Kelly's attitude,
James Hardy's domestic abuse
charges or Mario Manningham's pot
usage. But there is significant
boom/bust potential with all of these
receivers.
But Bradford? He's too complete
to fail.

performance at the Combine helped
reinforce this conception — his 4.69
40-yard dash and 4.47 short shuttle
were amongst the worst for wide re
ceivers. However, at Stanford's pro
day last month, Bradford may have
alleviated those concerns by running
a 4.49 40 and a 4.26 shuttle, both of
which would have placed him near
the top 10 at the Combine. A quick
look at game tape shows that while
Bradford may not be a burner, he
has more than enough speed to cre
ate separation between him and his
man.
In addition to mechanics and
measurables, character has become
of increasing importance to NFL
scouts. As guys like Chris Henry and
Pac-Man Jones squander their talent
with arrest after arrest, teams are be
ginning to look past a player's poten
tial if their attitude and actions
aren't kept in check. And beyond
law-breaking, general managers
want cohesion; they're willing to jet
tison stars such as Randy Moss on
the cheap if they make too much of a
scene.
Bradford not only has his head
squarely on his shoulders, but has
been a true team leader in his time
on the Farm. His passion comes
through in his play, and he's rarely, if
ever, temperamental. His team
mates and coaches love him. He has
n't gotten into any notable trouble
and is smart enough to learn whatev

er playbook is presented to him.
Character is too often a concern with
prospects; with Bradford, it should
be a plus.
There are few wideouts as well
rounded as Bradford in the draft.
Among the top receivers in the
draft, Michigan State's Devin
Thomas runs sloppy routes; Okla
homa's Malcolm Kelly has chronic
knee and character issues; and Cal's
Desean Jackson's strength is a con
cern.
But Bradford has very few prob
lems to speak of — those that have
been presented have fairly simple
answers. The first is that Bradford
didn't produce enough in college.
But the Cardinal had a revolving
door of quarterbacks during his time
on the Farm. Even worse, he played
under three different coaches, all
with different schemes. And still,
Bradford had a record-setting fresh
man season, and, despite coming off
a season-ending injury in 2006 —
another concern for scouts — came
full circle by leading the Cardinal in
receiving in 2007.
NFL teams may be enticed by
Thomas's potential. They may be
willing to look past Kelly's attitude,
James Hardy's domestic abuse
charges or Mario Manningham's pot
usage. But there is significant
boom/bust potential with all of these
receivers.
But Bradford? He's too complete
to fail.
