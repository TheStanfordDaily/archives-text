# Photo controversy sparks protest
## Old Union administrators remove photo exhibit, SCAI rallies in White Plaza and Old Union 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About 50 students and community mem
bers marched into Old Union Monday after
noon to protest what they called "explicit polit
ical censorship" on the part of the University.
The rally, inside the building for roughly 15
minutes, was sparked by the removal of a
photo exhibit sponsored by Students
Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI). Old
Union administrators took down the photos on
April 9 after receiving multiple complaints
regarding the exhibit.
The 10 photographs, taken by local photog
rapher Lisa Nessan, offered various portrayals
of Palestinian life in the West Bank.The photo
graphs appeared with captions, which, accord
ing to members of SCAI. were based on infor
mation from human rights organizations such
as Amnesty International and the United
Nations.
University administrators. however.

stressed that the captions had not been part of
the exhibit initially approved bv Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of unions. The original
title of the exhibit, "Hope Under Siege," had
been also changed to "Life Under Israeli
Apartheid," according to Associate Vice
Provost Chris Griffith. The changes, combined
with the complaints, led to the exhibit's
removal two days after it had appeared.
"People felt it was inflammatory," Griffith
told The Daily, adding that "multiple concerns"
had been raised by a "broad scope of folks."
SCAI members, however.contend that they
were told initially that general complaints and
the title had been the cause for the removal.
After offering to change the title, SCAI co
president Fadi Quran TO said the organization
was then informed about complaints regarding
the captions.
"We provided all the information that the
administrators initially asked for. but they did
not request any captions." he said. "We
assumed that the administration would expect

photo exhibits to include captions, just as the
exhibit that preceded ours did."
"The exhibit could be reinstated if the
administration simply followed through on
their promises to show us the complaints and
allow us to meet with those who filed them," he
continued. "Moreover, we believe this is an
attempt to deflect attention from the true issue

at hand: political censorship."
SCAI member Amanda Gelender'o9, who
led Monday's rally, said that Smith-Laws had
promised last week to provide the complaints
to SC'AI so that concerns could be addressed.
"So far she has failed to provide them,"
Gelender said. "We don't even know the
nature of the complaints. It's all so vague; we

really want to see the complaints."
While the students criticized the University
as being uncooperative, administrators said
efforts had been made to reach a compromise.
According to a statement by Greg Boardman,
vice provost for student affairs, sent to The


MAI EL-SADANY/The Stanford Daily
Protestors, led by Students Confronting Apartheid in Israel, rallied in White Plaza on Monday in reaction to the removal of a photo
exhibit in Old Union. The photos were removed on April 9 in response to several complaints by community members.
Daily Monday afternoon, the
University offered SCAI the opportu
nity to relocate the exhibition "to
another prominent location on cam
pus or to resume the show at Old
Union in keeping with their original
proposal."
"They decided against pursuing
either option." Boardman said.
SCAI members met with Smith-
Laws last week to discuss a potential
compromise. Gelender said the
administration's proposal to put the
exhibit back up in its original state,
without titles or captions, was "unac
ceptable."
"It doesn't make sense to have a
photo display without captions," she
said.
The students were then told they
could go to White Plaza, according to
Gelender.

"[Old Union] was one of the only
places I thought we had free speech
Gelender said. "We can't afford this
additional suppression."
When it reopened in the fall amidst
great fanfare, administrators
expressed hopes that Old Union could
be a center for student expression. But
that vision, administrators now say.
was never clearly defined.
"What is it that students want this
building to be was not clearly articulat
ed," Griffith told Ibe Daily Monday.
"When you don't define that, people
who use the building define it them
selves."
"We did the best we could," she
added. "We need to get some dialogue
going with students."
That dialogue, according to
Boardman, could be in the works
shortly.

"We have yet to fully articulate the
programmatic vision for Old Union
that will help establish policies and
procedures to guide us on the use of
communal space including as a venue
for artistic and/or political expression."
Boardman said. "We will work with
the incoming ASSU leadership to seek
student input on this issue and are in
the process of creating an advisory
group composed of students and staff
to develop these policies and to help to
assess future uses of this space."
"We look forward to Old Union
serving as a center where dialogue is
encouraged while remaining a com
fortable gathering place for all," he
added.
