# Stanford holds off Spartans
## 
### SAM SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before the Stanford women's water polo
team played San Jose State last weekend. Car
dinal coach John Tanner said that the main
thing he was looking for in the game was con
sistency from his team. After almost throwing
away a six-goal lead in the third period on Sat
urday, it appears that there is still some work to
be done in that department. Despite this, the
Cardinal was able to hang on for a 9-8 victory
and close out the regular season on a winning
note.
In truth, a one-goal victory is not terrible for
the team, even though they handily beat San
Jose State by seven goals back in February.
Coming into the game, the N0.9 Spartans had
much more to play for than the No. 2 Cardinal.
Stanford had already locked up the No. 2
seed for the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) conference tournament
and had just come off rivalry' and Senior Day

victories the previous weekend. San Jose
State's position in the conference tournament,
on the other hand, was still up in the air — the
Spartans could have finished eighth, ninth or
tenth — and the match against Stanford was
their Senior Day. They clearly had the greater
incentive of the two squads.
Yet it was the Cardinal, not the Spartans,
who came out of the gates with more motiva
tion. Stanford dominated the first period, stak
ing out a 4-1 lead and expelling any thoughts
that they would not be mentally ready for the
game.The second quarter would be more of the
same as the women outscored San Jose State 3-
1 to take a 7-2 lead into halftime.
After opening the third period with yet an
other goal. Stanford was apparently in cruise
control. The Spartans, however, woke up after
Juliet Moss drew a five-meter penalty and then
converted to make the score 8-3. They would
score two more goals to close the gap to a
three-goal game by the end of the period.
San Jose State opened the scoring in the

fourth period, and suddenly the margin was
just two. Stanford's Kelsey Holshouser was
able to end the Spartans' 4-0 run with a goal to
bump the score up to 9-6, but San Jose State
answered with a goal of its own with 4:41 re
maining in the game. Then, with just over a
minute left, they broke through again to make
it 9-8.
With all the momentum going against them,
the Cardinal defense needed to buckle down
for the final minute, and it was able to do just
that. When the Spartans got the ball back with
17 seconds left, Stanford pressured them to the
point where they could not even get a potential
game-tying shot off.

Koree Blyleven and the Cardinal kept the Spartan offense at bay in the closing minute of play to halt San Jose State's momentum and hold onto its
one goal lead for a win. Stanford already has the No. 2 seed locked up for the MPSF conference tournament opening this weekend.
