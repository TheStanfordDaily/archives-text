are one of the hottest teams in the
country and they got off to an unbe
lievable start. I think we did a good
job to make up ground in the final
round."
The first round of the tournament
on Saturday went well for the Cardi
nal as the team recorded a one
under par score of 279, but the Tro
jans managed an even better start to
the day pulling off a 14-under par
266. Four of five Stanford golfers
concluded the day under or at even
par. Most of the teams began to
struggle in the second round as the
afternoon winds picked up. The Car
dinal concluded the day in second
with a collective 12-over par score of
572 while USC grabbed a six-under
par 554 to go into the final round in
first place.
Stanford stepped up its game in
the final round by cutting the Tro
jans' lead down to 13 strokes. The
Cardinal concluded the tournament
just one-over par as a team. All five
Stanford golfers placed in the top 20
individually, giving the Trojans a run
for their money. Rounding out the
top five was No. 57 California and
No. 3 UCLA in a tie for third. No. 62
UC-Irvine came in fifth.
No. 12 freshman Sihwan Kim was
the only Cardinal golfer to post an
overall score under par. Kim opened
the tournament with an even-par
score of 70. but he was also affected
by the winds on Saturday afternoon
to tab a two-over 72. He battled back
in the final round to score a four
under 66 which launched him up the
individual ladder four places into a
tie for second.
Just behind Kim was freshman
Steve Ziegler, who has only im
proved as the season goes on.
Ziegler improved his personal best
collegiate finish from a tie for tenth
to a tie for seventh this time, shoot
ing a collective one-over score of
211. Though he incurred a four
over 74 in the second round due to
the gusty winds, he finished the
final round strong with a three
under 67 to help close the gap be
tween Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia.
Junior Dodge Kemmer also
proved to be a significant help to the
Cardinal coming in 16th with an
overall four-over par score of 214.
Kemmer played consistently well,
recording scores of 69 and 71 in the
first and final rounds but fell victim
to the second round winds to earn
him a score of 74.
Senior Rob Grube and sopho
more Jordan Cox finished the indi
vidual competition in a tie for 20th
with a six-over 216 respectively.
Grube opened the first round with a
seven-over 77 but improved his
score by 11 strokes in the final round
to tab a four-under par score of 66.
Cox recorded an even par score of 70

in the first and final rounds with a
six-over 76 in the second round.
"It's neat to see how big of a role
that our frosh have played the last
few weeks," Ray said. "This bodes
well for us because their presence
along with the presence of the older
guys will help us with our consisten
cy and our confidence. It is great to
see it all come together."
After gaining some momentum
with this second place finish, the Car

dinal will spend this week preparing
for the postseason. Stanford will
head to Fairfax. Calif, on April 280 to
take on some of the top teams in the
nation during the Pac-10 Conference
Championships.
"We have six guys that have a lot
of experience going into Pac- 10s,"
Ray said. "Adding Daniel Lim to
these five guys will increase our
depth and help our cause."
"At the end of the day, it boils

down to us focusing on just playing
the golf course." he continued. "The
nice thing is that we have a lot of
guys who have played there a lot for
other events, so they are familiar
with the course. No one wants to get
beat by USC two weeks in a row, or
get beat by UCLA or Berkeley for
that matter."
