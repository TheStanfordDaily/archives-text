### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A small contingent of Stanford

Walnut. Calif, this weekend to com
pete at the prestigious Mt. SAC Re
lays on Friday and Saturday.
The meet was held at the Mount
San Antonio College Track, the
home of two Olympic Trials and 13
world records. Most of the Cardinal
athletes that competed were in the
field events, with two runners com
peting in the distance races.
The meet proved to be fruitful —
several Stanford athletes achieved
personal best and season best marks
in their respective events.
The women were led by junior
Tessa Flippin, who won the high
jump with a season best leap of 5-6.
With a personal best for Stanford
was sophomore Caitlin Hewitt who
finished second in the pole vault,
with a regional standard vault of 12-
7.5. Also leading the women, was
junior Michaela Wallerstedt, who set
a personal best in the discus with a
throw of 162-9. improving her re
gional mark and moving her into sev
enth <>n the Pac-10 list.
In the heptathlon competition for
the women, junior Lauren Stewart
placed eighth with a career best
score of 5,262 points. The score was
also a national provisional standard.

which she ran in a time of 14.31 sec
onds.
The men were led by senior Mike
Macellari. who achieved a personal
best in the discus with a throw of 174-
0. Macellari also won the shot put
with a throw of 54-3.25. When asked
about his performance, however,
Macellari said he was disappointed.
"This weekend's shot put was not
really a high point in my career," he
remarked. "There were two sections
of collegiate shot putters. While I
won my section, it was the weaker of
the two and this was my second-to
worst shot put performance of the
year.

tice in the shot put this last week," he
continued. "It just hasn't come to
gether yet for a big throw in the
meet. I have another week to work
on it and am looking to throw a per
sonal best in the shot next weekend
at the Brutus I lamilton meet in Cal."
Senior Josh Hustedt put forth yet
another outstanding performance in
the men's decathlon, placing third in
the event with a career best and na
tional provisional standard score of
7.465 points.
One of Stanford runners at the
meet, junior Hari Mix. had an amaz
ing performance, running a personal
best and regional qualifying time of
13:56.28 in the 5.000 meter run.
