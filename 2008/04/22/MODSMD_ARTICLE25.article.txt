## Yale University says student's artwork is a hoax 
### PAT EATON-ROBB THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HARTFORD, Conn. — A Yale
University art student's claim that
she induced repeated abortions on
herself and used the blood for her
senior project is false, school offi
cials said after her account was pub
lished in the student newspaper.
Aliza Shvarts described the proj
ect in a story Thursday in the Yale
Daily News. She said she artificially
inseminated herself "as often as pos
sible" while taking herbal drugs to
induce miscarriages, the story said.
The account swept across blogs
and media outlets before Yale issued
a statement saying it investigated
and found it all to be a hoax that was
Shvarts 1 idea of elaborate "perform
ance art."
"The entire project is an art piece,
a creative fiction designed to draw
attention to the ambiguity surround
ing form and function of a woman's
body," said Yale spokeswoman
I lelaine Klasky.
But in a guest column published
in Friday's student newspaper,
Shvarts insisted the project was real.
She described her "repeated self-in
duced miscarriages," although she
allows that she never knew if she was
actually pregnant.
"The most poignant aspect of this
representation — the part most
meaningful in terms of its political
agenda (and. incidentally, the aspect
that has not been discussed thus far)
— is the impossibility of accurately
identifying the resulting blood," she
said.
"Because the miscarriages coin
cide with the expected date of men
struation (the 2Sth day of my cycle),
it remains ambiguous whether ...
there was ever a fertilized ovum or
not. The reality of the pregnancy,
both for myself and for the audience,
is a matter of reading." she wrote.
Shvarts told the newspaper she

planned to display a work that con
sisted of a cube lined with plastic
sheets with a blood-and-petroleum
jelly mixture in between, onto which
she would project video footage of
herself "experiencing miscarriages
in her bathroom tub."
University officials said Shvarts'

project included visual representa
tions, a news release and other nar
rative materials. When confronted
by three senior Yale officials, includ
ing two deans, Shvarts acknowl
edged that she was never pregnant
and did not induce abortions. Klasky
said.

"She said if Yale puts out a state
ment saying she did not do this, she
would say Yale was doing that to
protect its reputation." Klasky said.
Shvarts told the paper her goal
was to spark conversation and de
bate on the relationship between art
and the human body.

Andrew Mangino, editor-in-chief
of Yale Daily News, said the newspa
per published the story after receiv
ing a news release about the project.
A reporter interviewed Shvarts and
other students and saw photos and
video that she said was part of the art
project, he said.
