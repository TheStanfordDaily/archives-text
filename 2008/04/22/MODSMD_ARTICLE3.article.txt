## Frosh Film Fest sees low turnout Event draws few despite planning and marketing efforts 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
Frosh Council hosted its first Frosh
Film Fest last Friday night to a small
crowd of under 50 students in Frost
Amphitheater.
Students at the event listened to
Branner band The People, watched a
comedian perform stand-up and viewed
the films "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and
"Forrest Gump."
Although the Frosh Council receives a
$5,000 dollar budget each quarter,
Stephanie Werner'll. Frosh Council sec
retary and a writer for The Daily, said that
the event cost about $6,000.
"The Freshman Dean's Office pitched
in to cover how much we went over in
budget in exchange for us getting people
to sign up for the Community Partnership
Day," Werner said.
Vicki Sun '11, co-chair for the event,
said that it could not have happened with
out the financial help from Dean of
Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims '89 and the administra
tion.
"We didn't realize how much other
things like lighting and sound [were] going
to cost," she said. "About a week and a half
before the event. Dean Julie realized that
we should be putting our time into mar
keting the event rather than coming up
with ways to fundraise. and she offered to
pitch in. which was really amazing."
Sun said that she and others on Frosh
Council were optimistic that the event
would be more successful.
"We thought it would go off really
well," she said. "When we pitched the idea,
all the freshmen were really excited. Even
upperclassmen asked about it, so we
decided to open the event to all students,
not just freshmen."
But Sun said that the hype surrounding
the event started to die down as people
had other obligations.
