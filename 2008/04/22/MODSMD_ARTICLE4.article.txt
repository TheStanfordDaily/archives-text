Sandra Day O'Connor '50. LLB '52 took a walk down
memory lane on Monday as she spoke to students in an inti
mate setting at Branner Hall, exploring issues including dis-

crimination. the psychology
of public service and
Constitutional law.

Supreme Court Justice often
joked with the forty students
present, who were selected to
attend based on a written
submission. O'Connor said
that she decided to major in
economics while at Stanford
because it was convenient.

"I chose economics because they never had classes on

O'Connor said that Branner. her home while she was a
freshman, had changed a lot since she lived there. For

the struggles she faced after
college, persuading students

Stanford — where the employer told her that while her
