## Supreme Court justice pushes public service "I just wanted my work to be something worth doing" SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sandra Day O'Connor '50. LLB '52 took a walk down
memory lane on Monday as she spoke to students in an inti
mate setting at Branner Hall, exploring issues including dis-

crimination. the psychology
of public service and
Constitutional law.
But the talk was not all
policy — the former U.S.
Supreme Court Justice often
joked with the forty students
present, who were selected to
attend based on a written
submission. O'Connor said
that she decided to major in
economics while at Stanford
because it was convenient.

"I chose economics because they never had classes on
Fridays, which worked out well for me," she said. "I loved
geology though and could have easily picked that. But they
went off on field trips on the weekend."
O'Connor said that Branner. her home while she was a
freshman, had changed a lot since she lived there. For
instance, quiet hours began at 7 p.m.

"They were not enforced. 1 can tell you that," she joked.
O'Connor was the first woman to be appointed to the
Supreme Court, where she served from 1981 until 2006.
Upon her arrival on the court. O'Connor proved pivotal in
divisive issues such as affirmative action, the death penalty
and religion. Notably, her vote reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, the

1973 case permitting women
the right to an abortion.
In a wide-ranging, two
hour discussion with students
from the Graduate School of
Business, Law School. Haas
Center for Public Service and
Branner, O'Connor spoke of
the struggles she faced after
college, persuading students
to face the challenges life
throws at them.

"I couldn't get inter
views with any law firms," she said. "I was shocked. It never
entered my mind that I would not he able to get a job."
The former justice outlined her first job interview —
which she only managed to secure through contacts from
Stanford — where the employer told her that while her

resume was good, the firm had never
hired a female lawyer and that
clients would not stand for it.
O'Connor, the first annual
Rathbun Visiting Fellow, heaped
praise on Harry Rathbun '16. Engr.
'20. JD '29 and explained how he was
a key factor in her decision to go to
law school.
"Harry was the first person 1 had
ever heard who said that an individ
ual could make a difference in the
world," she said. "He was so con
vinced that anyone could succeed at
accomplishing anything. I think most
of us believed him because he was so
persuasive."
O'Connor strongly urged the
audience to consider a life working
as a public servant.
"1 have seen many gifted law
clerks who used to work for big law
firms with $200.(MX) signing bonuses
on top of their good salaries," she
said. "Yet no matter what the conse
quence. they came back to public
service. They wanted the personal
satisfaction from knowing that they
were helping make society function

better."
She declared that even if students
did not wish to work in the public
sector, they could still make positive
change in society by working in the
private sector.
"I never aspired to be the
Supreme Court Justice." she said. "It
just happened. I just wanted my
work to be something worth doing
that made a difference and was not
something that just any person could
do. It was pretty natural, one thing
followed another."
When asked how to live a bal
anced life. O'Connor outlined four
steps that she felt were important:
family, exercise, sleep and loving
one's work.
There's a famous sleep professor
here at Stanford." she said, referring
to Prof. William Dement, of the psy
chiatry, behavioral sciences and sleep
disorder sleep center. "Take his class.
Everyone I knew at the Supreme
Court was committed to keeping
their family in good shape. Put your
family first but then give up every
thing else."
Other students peppered
O'Connor with political questions.
One law student questioned whether
personal opinions or faith ever
affected her decisions, particularly in
cases involving the death penalty. In

response. O'Connor pulled out a
copy of the Constitution from her
purse, and said she expressly fol
lowed what the Constitution said.
"I swore to uphold the
Constitution," she said. "The
Constitution does not prohibit the
death penalty and so it is not for a
judge to decide. I didn't need to bal
ance my own opinion —it is what
the laws stated. 1 moved from case to
case and did the best 1 could with it."
She cited the example of the pres
idential election in 2(XX), in which the
results indicated that the popular
vote supported A 1 Gore while the
Electoral College supported
President Bush.
"If people were unhappy, it was
because of the Electoral College sys
tem and not our decision," she said.
"The Constitution is not going to
change because it will negatively
affect the smaller states. So I am fine
with the outcome — it doesn't both
er me."
One student asked her what was
her most meaningful accomplish
ment in life.
"Serving on the Supreme Court,"
she said, "and not making a total dis
aster out of it."
