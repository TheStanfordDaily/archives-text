## Students question Russian political youth group Nashi seeks to network with students discussion centers on controversy 
### COURTNEY WEAVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Officials associated with Russia's pro-Kremlin youth
group. Nashi. met with Stanford students and administra
tors yesterday as part of a daylong campus visit. The dele
gation, which is in the United States for an Atlanta confer
ence on robotics, extended its travels to Stanford and
M.I.T. to gain further perspective on American higher
education.
The government-funded Nashi. literally meaning
"Ours" in Russian, identifies itself as a democratic and
anti-fascist youth movement. But many Western observers
have likened the group to the Soviet Komsomol or even
the Hitler Youth.
"We believe that Russia should become the most
attractive country to live in the world." said Vasily
Yakemenko, head of the delegation, in his opening
remarks. "We want Russia to become the best country in
promoting talent and success."
Yakemenko gave a short background presentation on
Nashi before answering questions with the aid of a trans
lator.
He presented the delegation's visit as a way to foster
innovative and collaborative projects between Russian
and American youth. He spoke of Nashi's aim to help
Russia's talented youth tap into their full potential.
"Nowadays projects that cannot be put into progress in
the rest of the world can be implemented in Russia,"
Yakemenko said. He cited cloning as an example and
promised the Stanford students funding for any future
such projects.
"It is to you [Stanford students] that we want to pres
ent ourselves as partners."
Like their Komsomol predecessors, Nashi members
carry around red books to record their attendance at
meetings and protests. Their street marches are character
ized by a prominence of mass chanting and the organiza
tion's trademark red flags.
Since the creation of Nashi in March 2005, the organi
zation has expanded to include over 100,000 Russian
youth. Its current program includes an annual camp where
Russians from across the country come for two weeks of
lectures and physical fitness. To attend the camp, thou
sands of applicants are ideologically screened with ques
tions such as "Why are you against America?"
When the discussion was opened up to the audience,
conversation quickly shifted from the topic of innovation
to the more controversial aspects of Nashi.
Two Estonians in the audience,
Dennis Trapido, a Sociology Ph.D.
student, and l.uukas lives '09
brought attention to Nashi's role in
spurring violent protests as a result
of Estonia's relocation of a Soviet
military monument.
"In the end, [the war monument
controversy] didn't destroy
Estonia's reputation, and 1 think it
didn't because of the actions of the
Nashi movement," Trapido said, cit
ing the international sympathy the
attacks provoked.
In turn, Yakemenko drew atten
tion to the words of the Estonian
prime minister who, preceding the
Nashi riots, called the Soviet soldiers
buried beneath the statue "maraud
ers."
"It was really an insult to the
whole nation," Yakemenko said.
"Before these words of apology are
uttered, the actions of the Nashi
movement will be relentless."
With reluctance, Yakemenko
touched on the issues like freedom
of press in Russia.
At one point, Yakemenko took

on the matter of Novaya Gazeta. the
newspaper that was shut down on
charges of unlicensed software for
the six months preceding Russia's
December 2(K)7 parliamentary elec
tion. Claiming that Novaya Gazeta
was available on every street corner,
Yakemenko stated that the paper's
existence was the perfect example of
Russia's free press.
"At times, (the paper] writes
things about the government for
which they'd be lynched in the U. 5.,"
he said straight-faced.
Such stark remarks were occa
sionally tempered by a few attempts
at humor.
"It is really so strange that being
a young girl you could have the mind
of a cold war vet," Yakemenko dead
panned to one student after she
inquired about the scientist Igor
Sutyagin, who had been sentenced
to 15 years in Siberia for alleged
British espionage.
Jenny Mullowney, a student serv
ices officer at Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP). who organized
the luncheon dismissed speculation
that the delegation's visit had any
correlation to the difficulties facing
prospective Stanford in Moscow stu
dents with their visa processing.
"Because we knew [the Nashi
officials] were controversial, we

thought it would be an interesting
opportunity." Mullowney said. "The
visa situation is completely unrelat
ed."
Throughout the discussion,
Yakemenko made repeated offers to
fully finance any Stanford student's
trip to attend a Nashi-affiliated sum
mer youth conference, visit Nashi's
annual summer camp or coordinate
any matter of collaboration.
Addressing the approximate 25
students in the room, Yakemenko at
one point stated, "If at the end of
three years, we successfully launch
25 projects, this trip to the U.S. will
not have been in vain."
But some students in the room
had a different impression of Nashi's
spirit of innovation.
Speaking after the luncheon,
lives commented on what he per
ceived as the irony of the delega
tion's desire to "foster innovation
and growth" in Russia.
"Sadly, they did not seem to
understand that the west's most
innovative project is political free
dom." he said. "Until the Kremlin
and its surrogates stop suppressing
political freedom, Russia can only
grow as long as the oil lasts."
