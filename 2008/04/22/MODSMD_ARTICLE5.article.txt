Officials associated with Russia's pro-Kremlin youth
group. Nashi. met with Stanford students and administra
tors yesterday as part of a daylong campus visit. The dele
gation, which is in the United States for an Atlanta confer
ence on robotics, extended its travels to Stanford and
M.I.T. to gain further perspective on American higher
education.
The government-funded Nashi. literally meaning
"Ours" in Russian, identifies itself as a democratic and
anti-fascist youth movement. But many Western observers
have likened the group to the Soviet Komsomol or even
the Hitler Youth.
"We believe that Russia should become the most
attractive country to live in the world." said Vasily
Yakemenko, head of the delegation, in his opening
remarks. "We want Russia to become the best country in
promoting talent and success."
Yakemenko gave a short background presentation on
Nashi before answering questions with the aid of a trans
lator.
He presented the delegation's visit as a way to foster
innovative and collaborative projects between Russian
and American youth. He spoke of Nashi's aim to help
Russia's talented youth tap into their full potential.
"Nowadays projects that cannot be put into progress in
the rest of the world can be implemented in Russia,"
Yakemenko said. He cited cloning as an example and
promised the Stanford students funding for any future
such projects.
"It is to you [Stanford students] that we want to pres
ent ourselves as partners."
Like their Komsomol predecessors, Nashi members
carry around red books to record their attendance at
meetings and protests. Their street marches are character
ized by a prominence of mass chanting and the organiza
tion's trademark red flags.
Since the creation of Nashi in March 2005, the organi
zation has expanded to include over 100,000 Russian
youth. Its current program includes an annual camp where
Russians from across the country come for two weeks of
lectures and physical fitness. To attend the camp, thou
sands of applicants are ideologically screened with ques
tions such as "Why are you against America?"
When the discussion was opened up to the audience,
conversation quickly shifted from the topic of innovation
to the more controversial aspects of Nashi.
