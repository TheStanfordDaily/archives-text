## GAME ON STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN A TIME-HONORED STANFORD TRADITION 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
c ,
m very spring quarter, Stanford
dorm staff honors a Bay Area
tradition that relies on cryptic
. clues — and the thrill of com
petition — to send students on
a 24-hour treasure hunt. The Game, held by
Roble Hall last weekend, is a test of sheer
chutzpah and pure stamina. Four freshmen
competitors were gracious enough to allow
this Daily reporter to follow their team
throughout the adventure.
FRIDAY, ZOO P.M.
Dean Young '11, Heidi Fogle '11. Travis
Urban '11 and Tom Kozlowski i 1 climb the
stairs to their headquarters. Dean's quad in
Roble. The team is armed with computers,
flashlights, notepads and. of course. Dean's
GPS-enabled iPhone.Travis stands to the side,
holding a clipboard stacked high with papers.
Among them is the periodic table, a chart of
US. state flags, a list of Jelly Belly flavors and
an array of obscure codes and ciphers.
The Game begins with a computer pro
gram about various pieces of campus trivia.
The first question reads: which author's water
themed quote adorns the fountain outside of
Memorial Church?
Before anyone can protest, Tom is out the
door and headed for his bike. "I'll phone in!"
he shouts back.
Travis flips through his notes in the mean
time.
"I need to brush up on my semaphore," he
says, staring at the code.
The call from Tom interrupts. "The quote is
from Melville!" he cries.
After sending Tom around campus to an
swer a few more questions, we're ready to
leave the bubble. Tom drives a white Volvo
station wagon, packed to capacity with pas
sengers. backpacks and Clif bars.
f*IDAY. 9=46 P.M.
The clue hidden in the parking lot of Cana
da College directs us to Golden Gate Park,
and Tom's station wagon roars north on 1-280.
"Everyone knows 85 is the new 60." he
says, stepping on the accelerator.
In the back seat, a cheerful ring from
Heidi's phone signals the arrival of a text mes
sage."My friend wants to know where we are."
she tells the group.
"Tell him we're on the way to San Jose!"
Tom suggests.
"Ooh.Tom plays dirty!" Dean says.
"I don't play dirty," Tom laughs. "I play to
win."

«IDAY. 10:07 P.M.
After some navigational false
starts, we arrive at Strawberry

Hill, where Tom,
Travis and Dean
tear up the trail.

The compe
tition is
fierce:
we're the
third team
to park on
« 1

the street, and two
more carloads pull
up behind us. Heidi
is nearly blinded
when a team
wearing spelunk
ing headlights all
turns in our direc
tion at once. After
a few minutes.
Dean's blue LED
flashlight beam
comes bouncing
back down the trail.

We drive to a nearby hotel
parking lot to decipher the clue.
It's a printed schedule, with times and activi
ties. The key turns out to he picturing each
time as it would appear on an analog clock:
the clock hands correspond to a number as
represented in flag semaphore. Numbers cor
respond to letters, and the answer starts to
take shape.
"A — R — S — E." spells Tom. "That's a
word!"
"Arsenic" is the full clue. We text the word
to Game Control, and the pre-recorded voice
message directs to Point Bonita lighthouse in
Marin.
SATURDAY, 2:36 A.M.
The lighthouse clue leads us to San
Rafael, and — after a quick stop at Safeway
for candy and energy drinks — the team
forges onward.The clue this time is a cryptic
letter, along with an audio CD that turns out
to be full of songs about war. After an hour,
the team is stumped. The call to Game Con
trol is unproductive, and Tom is pressuring
Dean to call again. Dean, annoyed, shoves
the phone back at Tom.
'You're the team captain!" Tom protests.
"What do you want me to ask them for?"
demands Dean.
"A hint! That doesn't suck!" says Tom.
"You want me to insult his hint-giving
ability and I won't," Dean says.
In the end,Travis makes the call. A differ
ent Roble staffer answers and the team re
ceives a more helpful hint: the secret is to use
binary.The songs must be categorized — one

for
pro-war. zero for anti-war —in
the order they appear on the
CD. The team ends up with a bi
nary numeral, but it's too many
digits and they can't figure out if

it's supposed to represent letters
or numbers. None of the responses

they try are correct.
"Ugh. can we just get the answer?"
asks someone. We call Game Control again.
It turns out there are two binary numerals
that represent the numbers 16 and 18. Those
numbers change to their corresponding let
ters — 16 is P and 18 is R.Then. P and R are
read in the NATO phonetic alphabet.
"Papa Romeo!"
But that answer doesn't work. An indig
nant chorus follows.
"Fuck that!"
"Bullshit!"
"This is ridiculous!"
Hie right answer turns out to be "Mon
tague." for Romeo's surname in Romeo and
Juliet. Tom can't believe it.
"From songs to binary to decimal to let
ters to the NATO alphabet to Shakespeare?"
he says. "That's a six-level cipher!"
Five people in a Volvo drive sullenly to the
East Bay.
SATURDAY, 4:01 A.M.
The next clue is in a ticket booth outside
Berkeley's football stadium. It's 32 eight-by
eight grids, partially filled in with letters.Tom
thinks they're Sudoku puzzles.
" I"his will take forever!" he says, handing
the clue off to Heidi.
I"he car sits in silence for a while. Morale is
low.
Tom climbs on the roof of his car and be
gins kicking his feet against the back window.
Dean shouts at him to knock it off, and Tom
sticks his head in the driver's door window.
"Let's go home and get some sleep," he says.
But Travis and 1 leidi have a breakthrough.
"It'schess!" ITie letters — K.Q. R. B. P and N
— stand for chess pieces, and each board is set

up
such that
one move
will send

the opponent into
checkmate. The tean

works industriously for over an hour,
until the sky lightens and the song
birds start chirping.

"The sun is coming up," says Dean, and he
calls Game Control. "Are we in last place?" he
asks.
"Definitely not," comes the response. The
team is encouraged.
"We're finishing the game!" declares Tom.
The Volvo heads south to Oakland.
SATURDAY. 5:46 A.M.
The team is puzzling through the next clue
in Jack London Square when a security guard
in a golf cart pulls up to our window to chat.
"How's your team doing?" he asks.
"OK," is the response.
"The first car was here at 12:30!" says the
security guard.
The team is aghast.
"The next one got here at 3:30, so you're
doing OK." the guard says reassuringly.
Saturday, 9:15 am
We're eating cinnamon rolls and drinking
coffee in an Oakland cafe while we work out
the next clue.Tom accidentally says "sleep de
pravity" instead of "sleep deprivation," and
the team decides it's a much more apt descrip
tion.
SATURDAY. 10:41 A.M.
After the final clues take us from an apart
ment in Belmont to Kepler's Books in Menlo
Park, we land in the basement of the Gates
building, where the Roble staff has been man
ning the phones all night. The room is full of
water bottles and junk food, and one staffer is
sleeping under a table. Heidi, Travis, Dean
and Tom learn that they've finished in the
middle of the pack of the all-freshmen teams.
"It's your first game," one RA tells them.
"Just finishing is a freaking accomplishment."
Tom drives back to Roble. The passengers
are subdued, but it's tough to tell whether this
is the result of fatigue or disappointment.Tom
is ever-optimistic.
"There's always next year," he says.

Juliet. Tom can't believe it.
"From songs to binary to decimal to let
ters to the NATO alphabet to Shakespeare?"
he says. "That's a six-level cipher!"
Five people in a Volvo drive sullenly to the
East Bay.
SATURDAY, 4:01 A.M.
The next clue is in a ticket booth outside
Berkeley's football stadium. It's 32 eight-by
eight grids, partially filled in with letters.Tom
thinks they're Sudoku puzzles.
" I"his will take forever!" he says, handing
the clue off to Heidi.
I"he car sits in silence for a while. Morale is
low.
Tom climbs on the roof of his car and be
gins kicking his feet against the back window.
Dean shouts at him to knock it off, and Tom
sticks his head in the driver's door window.
"Let's go home and get some sleep," he says.
But Travis and 1 leidi have a breakthrough.
"It'schess!" ITie letters — K.Q. R. B. P and N
— stand for chess pieces, and each board is set

up
such that
one move
will send

the opponent into
checkmate. The tean

works industriously for over an hour,
until the sky lightens and the song
birds start chirping.

"The sun is coming up," says Dean, and he
calls Game Control. "Are we in last place?" he
asks.
"Definitely not," comes the response. The
team is encouraged.
"We're finishing the game!" declares Tom.
The Volvo heads south to Oakland.
SATURDAY. 5:46 A.M.
The team is puzzling through the next clue
in Jack London Square when a security guard
in a golf cart pulls up to our window to chat.
"How's your team doing?" he asks.
"OK," is the response.
"The first car was here at 12:30!" says the
security guard.
The team is aghast.
"The next one got here at 3:30, so you're
doing OK." the guard says reassuringly.
Saturday, 9:15 am
We're eating cinnamon rolls and drinking
coffee in an Oakland cafe while we work out
the next clue.Tom accidentally says "sleep de
pravity" instead of "sleep deprivation," and
the team decides it's a much more apt descrip
tion.
SATURDAY. 10:41 A.M.
After the final clues take us from an apart
ment in Belmont to Kepler's Books in Menlo
Park, we land in the basement of the Gates
building, where the Roble staff has been man
ning the phones all night. The room is full of
water bottles and junk food, and one staffer is
sleeping under a table. Heidi, Travis, Dean
and Tom learn that they've finished in the
middle of the pack of the all-freshmen teams.
"It's your first game," one RA tells them.
"Just finishing is a freaking accomplishment."
Tom drives back to Roble. The passengers
are subdued, but it's tough to tell whether this
is the result of fatigue or disappointment.Tom
is ever-optimistic.
"There's always next year," he says.

m very spring quarter, Stanford
dorm staff honors a Bay Area
tradition that relies on cryptic
. clues — and the thrill of com
petition — to send students on
a 24-hour treasure hunt. The Game, held by
Roble Hall last weekend, is a test of sheer
chutzpah and pure stamina. Four freshmen
competitors were gracious enough to allow
this Daily reporter to follow their team
throughout the adventure.
FRIDAY, ZOO P.M.
Dean Young '11, Heidi Fogle '11. Travis
Urban '11 and Tom Kozlowski i 1 climb the
stairs to their headquarters. Dean's quad in
Roble. The team is armed with computers,
flashlights, notepads and. of course. Dean's
GPS-enabled iPhone.Travis stands to the side,
holding a clipboard stacked high with papers.
Among them is the periodic table, a chart of
US. state flags, a list of Jelly Belly flavors and
an array of obscure codes and ciphers.
The Game begins with a computer pro
gram about various pieces of campus trivia.
The first question reads: which author's water
themed quote adorns the fountain outside of
Memorial Church?
Before anyone can protest, Tom is out the
door and headed for his bike. "I'll phone in!"
he shouts back.
Travis flips through his notes in the mean
time.
"I need to brush up on my semaphore," he
says, staring at the code.
The call from Tom interrupts. "The quote is
from Melville!" he cries.
After sending Tom around campus to an
swer a few more questions, we're ready to
leave the bubble. Tom drives a white Volvo
station wagon, packed to capacity with pas
sengers. backpacks and Clif bars.
f*IDAY. 9=46 P.M.
The clue hidden in the parking lot of Cana
da College directs us to Golden Gate Park,
and Tom's station wagon roars north on 1-280.
"Everyone knows 85 is the new 60." he
says, stepping on the accelerator.
In the back seat, a cheerful ring from
Heidi's phone signals the arrival of a text mes
sage."My friend wants to know where we are."
she tells the group.
"Tell him we're on the way to San Jose!"
Tom suggests.
"Ooh.Tom plays dirty!" Dean says.
"I don't play dirty," Tom laughs. "I play to
win."

«IDAY. 10:07 P.M.
After some navigational false
starts, we arrive at Strawberry

Hill, where Tom,
Travis and Dean
tear up the trail.

The compe
tition is
fierce:
we're the
third team
to park on
« 1

the street, and two
more carloads pull
up behind us. Heidi
is nearly blinded
when a team
wearing spelunk
ing headlights all
turns in our direc
tion at once. After
a few minutes.
Dean's blue LED
flashlight beam
comes bouncing
back down the trail.

We drive to a nearby hotel
parking lot to decipher the clue.
It's a printed schedule, with times and activi
ties. The key turns out to he picturing each
time as it would appear on an analog clock:
the clock hands correspond to a number as
represented in flag semaphore. Numbers cor
respond to letters, and the answer starts to
take shape.
"A — R — S — E." spells Tom. "That's a
word!"
"Arsenic" is the full clue. We text the word
to Game Control, and the pre-recorded voice
message directs to Point Bonita lighthouse in
Marin.
SATURDAY, 2:36 A.M.
The lighthouse clue leads us to San
Rafael, and — after a quick stop at Safeway
for candy and energy drinks — the team
forges onward.The clue this time is a cryptic
letter, along with an audio CD that turns out
to be full of songs about war. After an hour,
the team is stumped. The call to Game Con
trol is unproductive, and Tom is pressuring
Dean to call again. Dean, annoyed, shoves
the phone back at Tom.
'You're the team captain!" Tom protests.
"What do you want me to ask them for?"
demands Dean.
"A hint! That doesn't suck!" says Tom.
"You want me to insult his hint-giving
ability and I won't," Dean says.
In the end,Travis makes the call. A differ
ent Roble staffer answers and the team re
ceives a more helpful hint: the secret is to use
binary.The songs must be categorized — one

for
pro-war. zero for anti-war —in
the order they appear on the
CD. The team ends up with a bi
nary numeral, but it's too many
digits and they can't figure out if

it's supposed to represent letters
or numbers. None of the responses

they try are correct.
"Ugh. can we just get the answer?"
asks someone. We call Game Control again.
It turns out there are two binary numerals
that represent the numbers 16 and 18. Those
numbers change to their corresponding let
ters — 16 is P and 18 is R.Then. P and R are
read in the NATO phonetic alphabet.
"Papa Romeo!"
But that answer doesn't work. An indig
nant chorus follows.
"Fuck that!"
"Bullshit!"
"This is ridiculous!"
Hie right answer turns out to be "Mon
tague." for Romeo's surname in Romeo and
Juliet. Tom can't believe it.
"From songs to binary to decimal to let
ters to the NATO alphabet to Shakespeare?"
he says. "That's a six-level cipher!"
