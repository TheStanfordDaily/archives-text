# A 						Hawaiian slice of Paradise
## 
### STACIE CHAN 
For students who weren't fortunate enough to travel
to Hawaii for Spring Break, a quick trip to the Man
zanita Courtyard last Saturday would have trans
ported them to an authentic traditional lu'au. The
courtyard was filled with the vibrant music and
dances of Hawaiian culture as the Stanford Hawai'i Club pre
sented its 28th Annual Lu'au: Kulia I Ka Nu'u. "Strive for the
Summit."
The entire event was one festive family gathering as the
Hawai'i Club welcomed students, family members and kids
of all ages with open arms, the mark of the typical warm
Hawaiian lifestyle.
"We just wanted to share little pieces of home with the
Stanford community" said Hoku Ching '10, Lu'au co-chair.
"We hope that everyone ate lots of good food, watched some
cool Polynesian dancing and had lots of fun."
And good food aplenty there was. Hawai'i Club members
had begun preparing the food at 9 p.m. the night before, en
suring that hundreds of guests would be well fed.
Under the bright sun and sprawled out on the grass, atten
dees feasted on entrees like chicken long rice. Lomi Salmon
— chilled, shredded and salted salmon with onions and toma
toes — and kahlua pig. which is traditionally prepared by fill
ing the pig's abdominal cavity with hot stones, then placing
the pig in a pit containing hot stones.
"But I'm sure Santa Clara County wouldn't have been too
open to that idea, so we hand-shredded the 40 lbs. of pork
ourselves using forks." said Lu'au Co-Chair Awapuhi Dancil
10. "The hardest part was figuring out how much of each item
to buy. People at Costco kept staring at us since we had 40
tomatoes, pineapples and pounds of salmon."
For dessert, participants feasted on fresh pineapple

dipped in h hing mui, a sweet flavorful spice; haupia — corn
starch pudding made from the juice of fresh-squeezed, grat
ed coconut — provided a satisfying ending to the meal as
guests enjoyed the tunes of the local Ho'omana Hawaiian
Band.
Perhaps the most interesting side dish was the poi, pounded
taro root that is kneaded into a smooth paste, traditionally
meant to be eaten by scooping it out of a bowl with one's fingers.
"I still haven't made up my mind about the poi,"said Chris
Olivares '10. "But everything else is absolutely delicious. I
came last year and had to come again to support friends and
watch the great dances. And how often do you get to have au
thentic Hawaiian food that's really good?"
After the satisfying meal, student dancers who had been
practicing since winter quarter were finally able to showcase
their native dances.
The event opened with a traditional chant, the oli, fol
lowed by popular hula and Tahitian dances, as well as the
much anticipated Haka.the New Zealand war dance that the
New Zealand Rugby team performs before every game to in
still a sense of fear in their opponent.

Stanford's first Polynesian Dance Group, Kaorihiva, was
also able to showcase the Uluhina. a semi-fast Tahitian dance
dedicated to their elders.
Between dances, raffle prizes were awarded and those
who didn't want to leave their fate to luck could participate
in small contests like a spelling hee and hula hoop contest
to win various gift certificates, gourmet chocolates and

cookies, Hawaiian hair pins and othei
prizes.

"The members of the Hawai'i
Club poured our heart and soul into
this event, working at 100 mph,"
Dancil said.
Ching added." We hoped that the
people attending would gain a bet
ter understanding of and apprecia
tion for our culture in a fun and en
joyable way."
