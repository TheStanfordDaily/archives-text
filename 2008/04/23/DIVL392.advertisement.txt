The University Task Force on Undergraduate Expansion
would like to receive input from students regarding potential educational,
social, and financial consequences of increasing the size of the undergraduate
class. We are particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on the following
topics:
• What are the pros and cons of expanding the undergraduate
population. 7
• What especially excites or concerns you about expansion?
• What are the key issues you believe the Task Force should explore
thoroughly as part of our work? How would you prioritize those
issues in terms of importance from your perspective?
• What are the tangible and intangible impacts you see related to
expansion?
• Is there anything else you'd want us to know/consider?
You are invited to share your thoughts with the Task Force
Co-Chairs and members at either of two upcoming
Town Hall Meetings:
Monday, April 28, 2008
12:00—1:00PM
5:30-6:3OPM
In the Ballroom (Room 100) in the Old Union Clubhouse.
If you cannot attend either of these sessions
