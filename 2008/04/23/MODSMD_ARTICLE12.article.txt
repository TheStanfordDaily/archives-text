## SCAI controversy comes to Senate Senators call for new free-speech guidelines, student arts initiative 
### RYAN MAC 
During Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting, senators turned their attention to the
recent controversy surrounding the Students
Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI) photo
exhibit that was removed earlier this month.
In the wake of a Monday afternoon protest by
students and community members outside Old
Union, members at the meeting listened to repre
sentatives from SCAI and Old Union to make
sense of the issue of free speech within student
areas.
SCAI member Mai El-Sadany '11 cited miscom
munication and the lack of definition of free stu
dent speech as the main reasons why the exhibits
were removed. However, she felt that a student
union should be a place where students can voice
their opinions without fear, no matter how contro
versial those opinions may be.
"The student union should be a place where stu
dents can be represented, their views represented,"
El-Sadany said. "What must be discussed are the
rules behind putting up exhibits in Old Union and
the specifics to that because they have not been
established and that is one of the major problems
that we face."
Adam Hudson TO, a student who attended the
meeting, said the solutions regarding a student's

free speech at the Union are within the Senate's
responsibility and jurisdiction.
"It's within the ASSU's scope to foster debate
and protect free speech," Hudson said. Because it is
a student union, it should be open to all students,
and every student should feel confident saying
their own opinion."
Responses from senators on the topic varied and
sparked a debate regarding where the line between
free speech and offensive speech lies in Old Union.
The senators ultimately called for a need for free
speech guidelines and a student arts initiative to
discuss what can and cannot be displayed in the
public student space.
Director of Unions Jeanette Smith-Laws intro
duced the notion of an arts program, but reiterated
the point that the decisions lie in the hands of stu
dents.
"There's a whole arts initiative that students are
working on to bring art projects to Old Union,"
Smith-Laws said. "We had intended to have stu
dents work and develop this to create a sustainable
arts program."
ASSU President Hershey Avula '08. who pro
claimed himself a "lame duck." also discussed the
final planned ASSU events for the quarter. Events
include Greenfest, a spring Row Block Party and an
on-campus flea market when students are packing to
leave in June.
"Those are the activities we're working on now."
Avula said. "Other than that, we're closing up shop
and letting the new [officials] take over."
