## Editorial Board Take Admit Weekend with a grain of salt 
### 
Love it or hate it. Admit Weekend is
once again upon us. Starting tomorrow
and carrying on through the weekend,
hundreds of prospective freshmen will be
scouring the campus to see if Stanford is the
right fit for them. Yet. the question arises:
Exactly what view of Stanford are ProFros
getting?
Admit Weekend is considered by many
to be an abbreviated version of New Student
Orientation (NSO). a week-long "summer
camp" held at the beginning of every school
year, filled with bonding activities and dorm
cheers. Admit Weekend, too, is character
ized by a certain hyper-energy, with dorm
flags waving in the air and fountain hopping
galore.
While this can be highly enjoyable for
ProFros. the nature of Admit Weekend's
festivities is debatable. On the Editorial
Board alone, we sat divided 3-3 between
"absolutely hating" Admit Weekend, and
feeling it was "one of the best weekends of
my life." It is our opinion that, whether
Admit Weekend nearly made you choose
another school or whether Admit Weekend
alone made you fall in love with Stanford, it
does not accurately portray our school.
Over the weekend, the notion may arise
that among the myriad of events and social
activities offered, nobody here goes to class
or works hard — or that they are academi
cally serious. This is, of course, far from the
truth.
To the credit of the organizers. Admit
Weekend is typically well-run. with enthusi
astic HoHos and RoHos.The task of arrang
ing mini-courses, housing, dining and events
like HoHoPalooza is enormous, and the co

ordinators of Admit Weekend should be
commended. They have undoubtedly put in
numerous man-hours to ensure the success
of the Weekend, known along with Reunion
Homecoming, NSO, Parents' Weekend and
Commencement as part of the "Big 5" annu
al events on campus. While some elements of
the weekend may seem contrived — the
rampant use of acronyms and excessive
dorm pride — these are in actuality, a part of
what Stanford really is.
But Admit Weekend also presents a
falsely idyllic view of Stanford in which stu
dents are perpetually happy and frolicking
outdoors with very little school work to do.
Also, the campus is officially dry this week
end. resulting in an atypical weekend social
scene. It is true here, like at the majority of
schools with whom we compete for these
students, that drinking is a part of the social
scene. The absence of a Senior Night this
weekend, for example, skews what a Pro Fro
might perceive as an "average weekend"
during the rest of the school year.
To members of the incoming class of 2012
who are taking the time to read this editori
al, take all you see around you with a grain of
salt. Engage in lengthy conversations about
Stanford with your RoHo and HoHo, but
also don't be afraid to approach random stu
dents, while waiting in line at Jamba Juice or
in the Bookstore, to get their candid opin
ions on the University. We have had good ex
periences here, but by talking to as many
people as possible and sitting in on classes
during the day, you'll get a better idea of the
"real" Stanford.
