# Co-Terminal Illness
## Your first job: rain on a parade? 
### 
As graduation approaches, I'm starting
to realize there really aren't a lot of
cool things you can do with a bache
lor's degree. Sure, we've all dreamt of being
swept up into the ranks of the California De
partment of Corrections after visiting their
booth at the career fair, but instead most of
us will end up at a 60 hour-a-week job in con
sulting or finance, or at a non-profit.
In the interest of finding out how far your
B.A. will get you right out of college, I inter
viewed some friends who recently graduat
ed. To lend a patina of scientific precision to
this sham survey, I have boiled the typical
graduate down into a handful of common
"types." I have excluded people who went
immediately to graduate school, which we
all know is just a desperate attempt to pro
long adolescence.
The first and most common type I'll call
"This Wasn't What 1 Signed Up For!" These
people didn't want to step onto a career fast
track right away, so they took an interesting
sounding job that would pay the bills and
hopefully give them some valuable experi
ence. Then they learned the truth — most
entry-level jobs really suck, so unless your
crappy job is going to lead to a better one
soon, get out fast.
My friend Emily is a University of Penn
sylvania graduate who got tricked into tak
ing a job with a hip European software com
pany, where she thought she would be doing
sales for a little while before moving into a
more creative role in management or mar
keting. But behind the slick facade, the job
was just straight-up sales, where she spent
ten hours a day cold-calling people to peddle
some obscure digital product she could
barely explain, all so she could fulfill a
monthly quota. Although she had never quit
anything before, Emily finally threw in the
towel after eight months.
"It always takes more courage to quit
than to stay," she told me. "Even if it's a job
you hate."
At this rate, her savings will run out by
the end of the summer, so now she is busy
applying for jobs, sometimes as many as five
a day. A liberal arts major, her biggest regret
is not taking a couple of courses that would
have provided some basic business skills.
"I always used to look down on all the
kids at Wharton," she said, referring to the
undergraduate business program at UPenn.
"Now I'm kicking myself for not taking Fi
nance 101."
When I asked my friend Jamie what cate
gory of post-grads she fit into, she burst out
laughing:"You should call it — 'People who

had big ideals that got crushed."' Jamie, is
working at an inner-city school through a
program similar to Teach for America.
She was parachuted into one of the worst
school districts in the country, where the
teacher retention rate, she estimates, is well
under 50 percent. Her job consists almost
entirely of discipline, and her students com
monly refer to her — not mean-spiritedly,
she hastens to add — as "cracker" and
"white bitch."
"I could have taken 900 courses in educa
tion, and it wouldn't have prepared me for
this," she said.
Despite admitting that every day is like
pushing a boulder up a hill, Jamie plans to re
turn to teach next year to honor the two
year contract she filed with the district.
"I can't justify not going back," she sighs.
"It's rough, but I'm stuck."
The third type I call "Slowly Adjusting to
Adulthood." Boring, right? Not so fast. My
friend Peter, who has a consulting job in
New York, a steady girlfriend and an apart
ment on the Upper East Side, explains that
the first year of post-grad life is considerably
more stressful than college.
"You want to put yourself in a situation
where five years down the road, you'll know
what you want," Peter said.
The fourth type is the "College Safety
Net." This guy or gal isn't ready to give up
the ghost of college life, so they move into a
Dead House or an apartment in Palo Alto
and then pick up right where they left off at
Stanford. As a co-term, I'm probably closest
to this type. You can find us playing Beirut in
undergrad dorms around campus and drop
ping by the Rose and Crown every week for
Trivia Night.
The final type I call "See you — Never!"
My former roommate Jarret is one of these.
He joined the Peace Corps to spend 27
months teaching English in Jordan.This type
essentially drops off the face of the earth, ex
cept for the occasional email in which they
endlessly defer to later, longer email they


Dave &
Brendan
promise to write. "1 only have two
minutes at the Internet cafe in Ki
gali. I'll talk to you again in June!"
Well, future graduate, there you
have a complete (read: partial)
menu of post-grad lifestyles —so
pick your poison. Look at the bright
side, at least we're not in a recession
— what's that? — well, shit.

Brendan hopes to shortly transition

from "College Safety Net" to "This
Isn't What 1 Signed Up For!" Wish him
luck at bselb@stanford.edu.
