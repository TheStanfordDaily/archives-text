# You're Not Special
## An excess of leisure 
### 
When I visited Stanford as a prospec
tive freshman, my first impression
of Stanford students was that they
acted just like the kids in my high school, ex
cept they had fewer responsibilities, no adult
supervision and lots of disposable income.
Four years here has done little to change that
impression.
The function of college is ostensibly to ac
quire an education. For those intending to
work in certain fields, such as academia or en
gineering, college might be necessary. 1 am
even willing to stipulate that, for the rest of
us, learning how to speak and write about
Foucault or the Argentinean monetary crisis
might be of some use in developing our intel
lectual capabilities.
But for all except the most hard-working
of my classmates, acquiring that education
fills perhaps fifteen hours a week in class and
another fifteen in coursework.The rest of our
time is spectacularly free, especially since we
are not burdened with the minutiae of daily
living, such as mortgage payments, commut
ing, housework, cooking and the like. To a
large extent, this unconstrained country-club
life is exactly what we pay for.
There are many other ways to get a col
lege education. In this nation there are hun
dreds of thousands of commuter students,
night-school students and students who are
paying for every college credit by waiting ta
bles. And if an education was truly what col
lege was about, these are the ways everyone

should go to school. But what Stanford is of
fering is not just an education, it is a lifestyle.
We have at Stanford the "traditional" col
lege experience, where idleness is not only
tolerated but expected. Parties, casual sex
and abuse of alcohol are seen as rites of pas
sage. More conscientious students may fritter
away their time in other, less harmful activi
ties, like exercise, reading or hours spent gaz
ing at a television or computer screen. No
matter what you choose to do, copious
amounts of leisure are inherent in the Stan
ford way of life.
The University encourages immaturity. It
has created an environment where there are
no consequences for many sorts of misbehav
ior. It has invested time and money in new
ways to hold the hands of their fledgling stu
dents, including undergraduate advisors,
writing tutors, oral communications tutors,
internship counselors and even people to
help you fill out your grant applications.
While I personally enjoy the cushy life I
have here, I don't really see what good comes

from bestowing it upon adolescents. Why do
parents actually pay for this? Why do some
families shell out hundreds of thousands of
dollars so their kids can be free of adult con
cerns for four years?
They must know what their kids are
doing. The college experience has been es
sentially unchanged, save for the drug of
choice, since the 60s. Are they merely victims
of a society that considers a four year degree
from a top private school as an essential qual
ification for professional work?
But why is this lifestyle seen as so neces
sary? Is there some sort of benefit to it that
escapes me? Maybe this safe environment al
lows us to practice being independent, so we
don't screw up as badly when we enter the
real world, where there are consequences for
our actions. But, looking around, I doubt
that's true. My classmates and I seem just as
helpless when it comes to applying for jobs,
controlling our finances and managing our
lives, as we were freshman year.
Perhaps the prodigious waste involved in
going to Stanford is the point. If expensive
cars and clothes can buy you respect, maybe
an expensive degree can as well. Maybe
being able to spend a few years in leisure is a
stamp of good breeding, an acknowledgment
that it's passe to work too hard.
