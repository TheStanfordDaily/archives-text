## Free speech and Old Union 
### 
The recent removal of a photographic
exhibition that had been given the title
"Life Under Israeli Apartheid " from
the lobby of the Old Union has elicited
protests of censorship by the show's sponsor,
Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel, as
well as a number of other students.
Although I am sympathetic to many of the
group's concerns, the Stanford community
should understand that the decision here has
nothing to do with free speech. The problem
is that what is appropriate free expression in
one context on campus is not in another. A
student can stand in White Plaza and give a
speech denouncing Israel (or Hamas), but
that same student could not give the same

speech in the lobby of Green Library. It
would simply be inappropriate in that con
text, given the purpose and function of the li
brary.
Tlie Old Union is meant to be a welcom
ing "living room" for all Stanford students. It
is intended to be a place where every student
can feel comfortably at home. Because of this
purpose, certain displays that would be com
pletely appropriate elsewhere on campus are
not appropriate in the Old Union. A poster
display decrying illegal immigration and op
posing legislation to create paths to citizen
ship for undocumented Mexican immigrants
would not be appropriate in the Old Union,
though it would be perfectly fine in other

campus contexts. And this is not restricted to
political displays. A student art display that
would be appropriate for the Art Gallery
might not be allowed in the Old Union, since
it might make certain students feel uncom
fortable because of their religious or cultural
backgrounds.
When the current exhibit was proposed
tor the Old Union, the title of the exhibit was
to be "Hope Under Siege." Under this title,
the display is focused on individuals suffering
because of the situation in the Middle East.
As such, it has a universal appeal that should
not make any student, regardless of back-
