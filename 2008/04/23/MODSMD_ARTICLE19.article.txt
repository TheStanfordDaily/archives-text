## Free speech and Old Union 
### 
The recent removal of a photographic
exhibition that had been given the title
"Life Under Israeli Apartheid " from
the lobby of the Old Union has elicited
protests of censorship by the show's sponsor,
Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel, as
well as a number of other students.
Although I am sympathetic to many of the
group's concerns, the Stanford community
should understand that the decision here has
nothing to do with free speech. The problem
is that what is appropriate free expression in
one context on campus is not in another. A
student can stand in White Plaza and give a
speech denouncing Israel (or Hamas), but
that same student could not give the same

speech in the lobby of Green Library. It
would simply be inappropriate in that con
text, given the purpose and function of the li
brary.
Tlie Old Union is meant to be a welcom
ing "living room" for all Stanford students. It
is intended to be a place where every student
can feel comfortably at home. Because of this
purpose, certain displays that would be com
pletely appropriate elsewhere on campus are
not appropriate in the Old Union. A poster
display decrying illegal immigration and op
posing legislation to create paths to citizen
ship for undocumented Mexican immigrants
would not be appropriate in the Old Union,
though it would be perfectly fine in other

campus contexts. And this is not restricted to
political displays. A student art display that
would be appropriate for the Art Gallery
might not be allowed in the Old Union, since
it might make certain students feel uncom
fortable because of their religious or cultural
backgrounds.
When the current exhibit was proposed
tor the Old Union, the title of the exhibit was
to be "Hope Under Siege." Under this title,
the display is focused on individuals suffering
because of the situation in the Middle East.
As such, it has a universal appeal that should
not make any student, regardless of back-
ground, feel attacked. It is meant to
generate sympathy for other human
beings — and perhaps thereby to
carry a subtle, but not inflammatory,
political message.
The entire point and impact of
the exhibit changed when it was
given the new title "Life Under Is
raeli Apartheid." It then became an
intentionally inflammatory state
ment that was guaranteed to make
certain of our students feel uncom
fortable and personally attacked in
its presence. The addition of cap
tions, which had not been part of the

original proposal, exacerbated those
feelings. If it were in White Plaza,
those students could just walk on by,
but if it is in a place that it supposed
to be a welcoming part of their
"home" — whether in their dorm
lounge or the Old Union — it be
comes an inappropriate limitation of
the space in which they can relax and
feel welcome.
It is a distinction that the univer
sity community at large needs to ap
preciate. 1 would suggest that the
students put up the exhibit using the
original title and without the cap
tions. It will still carry an important
humanitarian message, but will not
have the political edge that makes it
inappropriate for the Old Union.
