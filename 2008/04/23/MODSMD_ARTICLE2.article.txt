### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Mila Rainof '03, a fourth-year
student at Yale School of Medicine,
died Sunday morning at Yale-New
Haven Hospital after being struck
by a car a day earlier.
As Rainof was crossing a busy
New Haven intersection Saturday
morning, her view obstructed by a
large truck, she was hit by a sports
car. According to the Yale Daily
News, Rainof sustained severe head
injuries before being rushed to the
hospital.
Rainof, 27, hailed from Santa
Monica, Calif, and double majored
in English and biology at Stanford.
Friends described her as sincere,
friendly and compassionate.
"She was one of the sharpest,
smartest, kindest people I have ever
met," said Jean Shi '03, Rainof's
freshman roommate in Otero.
"When people talk about meeting
'soul mates' in college who change
their lives, she was absolutely that
for me."
Rainof had been planning to go
into emergency medicine, with a res
idency at Alameda County Medical
Center's Highland General Hospital
Department of Emergency
Medicine set to start in the fall.
"She was so excited to be going
back to California for her residen
cy," said Amanda Silverio '03. "She
loved medicine and even stayed in
New Haven to do extra rotations
while her classmates had gone on
vacation, because she had so much
to give. Patients always loved her."
An Tran '03, a close friend,
remembered Rainof as witty and
generous, with an easy laugh and a
love for both medicine and litera
ture.
English Prof. Jennifer Summit,
Rainof's adviser in the English
major, remembered Rainof well.

calling her advisee "a treasure."
"She was an accomplished
English major and a pre-med who
felt drawn to medicine out of a
strong desire to help people and to
make a positive social contribu
tion," Summit said. "Even in the
more stressful times of the quarter,
when advisers usually see their
advisees, 1 remember that she radi
ated warmth, humanity and kind
ness."
Otero dormmates Molly Knight
'03 and Naveen Kabir '03 recalled
the way Rainof always had a warm
smile for them.
"She would genuinely ask how

you were doing, even if it was when
we were brushing our teeth," Kabir
said.
Knight remembered the way
Rainof said hello to her every day
while they lived together.
"That's the kind of thing you
don't forget," she said, adding that
Rainof left an impression on all who
knew her. "She was a light."
Silverio called Rainof "an
absolute sweetheart."
"She was always so bubbly and
full of energy." Silverio said, recall
ing how Rainofs enthusiasm as a
Yale tour guide played an important
role in recruiting Silverio to the Yale
School of Medicine.
Shi recalled one of her fondest
memories with Rainof. On Easter,
the two locked themselves in their
room and devoured a basket of
chocolate from Rainofs parents.
"We were just two silly girls shut
ting out the stress of midterms and
spending the day giggling, gossiping
and stuffing our faces with sugar,"
she said.
At Stanford, Rainof worked as a
Teaching Assistant for two biology
lab classes during her junior and

senior years. She also sang for the
elderly with a group called Young at
I leart (now Side by Side), serving as
co-facilitator her junior year.
"That combined two things
important to her â€” she loved
singing, and she loved bringing
cheer to people," Tran said.
Katy Porray '04 sang with Rainof
for several years in Young at Heart.
"She loved to visit people ran
domly to cheer them up, leaving
some flowers or a sweet note on
their doorstep," Porray said. "She
was always bringing joy to people
around her."
