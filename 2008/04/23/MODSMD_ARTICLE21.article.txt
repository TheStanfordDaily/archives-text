## The
						Draft: It's finally here 
### 
I couldn't be more excited. Re
ally, I couldn't. It happens every
year, and it's back again: the single
best weekend to be a sports fan in
America. Sure, the NBA and NHL
playoffs are nice. Yes, the national
pastime is in full swing. But that will
all be true for the next month. No,
what makes this weekend special is
simple — the NFL Draft is upon us.
Every year I write this column,
and every year it's kind of the same.
So I'm ramping it up a notch this
year. I say there is no better learn
ing experience in any sport than its
draft, and nowhere is that more true
than in the NFL, where the media
coverage is the heaviest as Ameri
ca's two greatest passions — col
lege and pro football — collide for
one weekend every year.
The NBA Draft, which is next in
terms of the exposure it gets, can't
compete with the intrigue the NFL
has to offer year in and year out,
simply because seven rounds are
better than two. Because 22 posi
tions (and more, including special
teams) are more fascinating than
five. Because NBA philosophies
rarely change — if there's a domi
nant big man, he'll always go first.
Otherwise, go for the most electri
fying offensive player you can find
or the guy with the most upside.
In the NFL, though, the differ
ences in the thought process from
one team to the next are staggering.
Where one coach may roll the dice
with a quarterback in the first
round, another may decide to seek
more immediate help in hopes of
preserving his job. Where some
teams focus almost exclusively on
college performance, rating ath
letes by how good they look on
game film, others tend to rely more
on "measurables," drafting for sta
tistics like size, speed and strength.
So there will always be intrigue
in the NFL Draft, even in a down
year for talent, like this one appears
to be. Even the most highly sought
after players "on the board" have
their flaws.
Michigan offensive tackle Jake
Long, for instance, who just signed
with the Miami Dolphins as the
draft's top pick, may not be nimble
enough to stick at the left tackle po
sition in the NFL and could be
forced to move to the right side,
where his value clearly diminishes.
Gifted Ohio State pass rusher
Vernon Gholston has what some
scouts would term "an inconsistent
motor," as he failed to dominate
some of the competition he should
have in college.
Even the most talented player
on the nation's best team, LSU de
fensive tackle Glenn Dorsey, has
struggled with injuries, leading
some to question whether he'll be
able to stay healthy at the next
level.
But all that perceived medioc
rity has only led to an uncertain top
of the first round, which just adds to
the drama. Will the New Orleans
Saints leap into the fray, trading up
to land Dorsey? Will the near-per
fect Patriots manage to add a domi
nant talent like Gholston to their
roster from their seventh position
in the draft order? Which team will
swing for the fences and hope to
find a franchise signal-caller in
Boston College QB Matt Ryan?
What's great about the draft is
that no one knows the answers to
those questions. The fans don't
know. The media "experts" don't
know. The teams themselves often
don't know as so much of their deci
sion making process depends on
who is left for them to select. So for
everyone watching, the draft is a
time to watch and learn what a team
really thinks of itself, of its oppo
nents, of the value of certain posi
tions and even of the way the league
is trending on the whole.
Indeed, sometimes even those of
us with zero access to the pro-ranks
of GMs, coaches and owners can
have a better notion of what's going
to happen than noted members of
the media.
I never claim to be sure of any
thing that's going to happen on draft
