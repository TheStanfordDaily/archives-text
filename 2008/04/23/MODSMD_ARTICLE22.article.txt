# STANFORD STOPS SJSU
## No. 7 Cardinal relies on relief pitching, offensive power, in 7-3 victory over the Spartans 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
Junior Missy Penna pitched five
and a third shutout innings in relief
and junior Maddy Coon drilled a
three-run home run to left field in
the bottom of the third inning as No.
7 Stanford defeated San Jose State
last night, 7-3.
Sophomore second baseman
Shannon Koplitz also homered for
Stanford, which had one hit each
from eight different players last
night. Five different players drove in
runs for Stanford in its first contest
since California broke a seven
game win streak in a 1-0, extra-in
nings game over the weekend.
The Cardinal (41-8, 6-6 Pac-10)
went down early to the Spartans
(23-29), but proceeded to score a
run in every inning but the second to
bury San Jose State in the squad's
last non-conference game of the
regular season.
SJSU center fielder Sarah Taylor
led the initial charge with an RBI in
each of the first two innings, on a
fielder's choice and a sacrifice fly.
The Spartans chased Stanford start
ing pitcher Ashley Chinn with three
runs before the second inning was
over.
Penna (28-7), the Pacific-10 Con
ference Pitcher of the Week,
stepped in and calmed things down
for Stanford. The junior struck out
eight of the 19 batters she faced, in
cluding an inning-ending, swinging
punch-out of Kelli Fangonilo with a
runner on third right â€” Fangonilo
was the first batter Penna faced.
Penna only allowed four hits and
did not let a Spartan advance past
first base in the game's final five in
nings.
In addition to Penna's damage
control, the Cardinal found itself
down only one run after two innings
thanks to a sacrifice fly from desig
nated player Erin Howe. After its
lone scoreless half-inning of the
evening, Stanford went on top for
the first time, and for good, in the
third inning.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will look to move into
the top half of the conference with its three
game slretch at home this weekend. Despite
being 41 -8 overall, the squad has work to
do in the Pac-10 with a record of 6-6. The
team does have momentum on its side,
though, having won eight of its last nine
games.

the Spartans' order
After retiring the first two Cardi
nal batters, San Jose State pitcher
Deanna Mauer (12-12) surrendered
a single to Stanford catcher Rosey
Neill and walked Howe. Coon then
stepped up to the plate and smacked
a 2-2 pitch over the wall in left field,
giving Stanford a 4-3 lead.

Freshman Ashley Chinn, above, started for the Cardinal, but quickly ran into trouble against the San Jose State of
fense. Junior Missy Penna replaced her in the second inning, and was able to hold the Spartans in check.
