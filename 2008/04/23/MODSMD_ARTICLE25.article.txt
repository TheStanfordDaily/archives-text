## Dolphins sign Michigan's Long, will select him first 
### STEVEN WINE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Jake Long seemed at ease in his
new role as the NFL's No. 1 draft
pick, leaning into a news conference
microphone to talk about his mean
streak while his mother sat in the cor
ner, nodding as she smiled.
The Miami Dolphins were grin
ning TUesday, too. They signed the
Michigan left tackle to a five-year
contract with $30 million guaran
teed. and they'll select him with the
top pick in the draft Saturday.
The deal allows the Dolphins and
Long to avoid a possible holdout.
"It's really important for us to
know Jake is going to be on the field
for us on time when training camp
begins in July," coach Tony Sparano
said. "That was critical."
Long's total contract package is
for $57.75 million, said a person fa
miliar with the negotiations who did
n't want to be identified because the
Dolphins declined to reveal terms.
Last year's top nick, JaMarcus Rus
sell, signed for $61 million with the
Oakland Raiders but
missed all of training camp before
reaching a deal.
Long becomes the highest-paid
lineman in the NFL and a 6-foot-7,
315-pound cornerstone in a rebuild
ing project for the new Dolphins
regime led by Bill Parcells. Last sea
son Miami went 1-15, and the offen
sive line has been a chronic problem
in recent years.
"Jake was our guy from the begin
ning," general manager Jeff Ireland
said. "Jake Long was on the top of
our board for a long time.There was
n't a whole lot of debate. We thought
it was a very good fit with the Miami
Dolphins."
With many other needs as well,
the Dolphins were interested in trad
ing the top pick for multiple lower
choices. When no suitors surfaced,
they began negotiations last week
with Long's agent, Tom Condon.
"It's such a great honor to be the
No. 1 pick," Long said. "I don't think
it has sunk in yet. It's something
every kid dreams about. I'm just real

excited that it happened. Now I'm
coming to a great place."
Long flew to South Florida with
his parents TUesday morning for the
news conference. The Dolphins said
they didn't conduct contract talks
with any other potential picks.
"It was a very straightforward ne
gotiation." Condon said. "They did
n't leverage us with other players,
and we didn't tell them we wanted to
be on some different team or any of
those kinds of things."
Reaching a contract agreement
before the draft isn't unprecedented.
The Houston Texans signed defen
sive end Mario Williams as their No.
1 pick on the eve of the 2006 draft.
Condon, who represents several
top prospects, said there's enough
time for the Rams to reach a deal
with a player before they make the
second pick Saturday.
"My understanding is St. Louis is
on the clock," Condon said with a
smile.
The only other offensive lineman
taken with the No. 1 choice since
1970 was Ohio State tackle Orlando
Pace, who made the Pro Bowl seven
consecutive times after joining the
Rams in 1997. The Dolphins would
be thrilled with a comparable
achievement by Long.
"Jake has all the qualities we're
looking for in our linemen." said
Sparano, who coached the offensive
line with the Dallas Cowboys. "He's
very tough, smart and disciplined.
Those are the people we want to sur
round ourselves with here."
Long said he's glad he'll be re
porting to training camp on time, be
cause he'll need to adjust to the
faster speed of the NFL game.
Temperament won't be an issue,
he said.
"I'm mean on the field," he said.
"I'm a very nice guy off the field.
When I buckle up that helmet, I
change. It's football mode. I go out
there and try to bury the guy and
make sure they don't touch the quar
terback or running back."
Long started 40 games at Michi
gan and was Big Ten offensive line
man of the year in 2006 and 2007.
