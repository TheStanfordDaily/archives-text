## Democrats Clinton, Obama collide in Pennsylvania primary

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —Hillary
Rodham Clinton ground out a gritty victory
in the Pennsylvania primary Tuesday night,
defeating Barack Obama and staving off
elimination in their historic race for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
"Some counted me out and said to drop
out," the former first lady told supporters
cheering her triumph in a state where she
was outspent by more than two-to-one.
"But the American people don't quit. And
they deserve a president who doesn't quit,
either."
"Because of you. the tide is turning."
Her victory, while comfortable, set up
another critical test in two weeks time in
Indiana. North Carolina votes the same day,
and Obama already is the clear favorite in a
Southern state with a large black popula
tion.
"Now it's up to you. Indiana," Obama
said at a rally of his own in Evansville after
Pennsylvania denied him a victory that
might have made the nomination his.
He criticized John McCain, the
Republican presidential nominee-in-wait
ing. by name as offering more of the same
policies advocated by President Bush. And
he took aim at Clinton without mentioning
her by name. "We can calculate and poll
test our positions and tell everyone exactly
what they want to hear," he said. "Or we can
be the party that doesn't just focus on how
to win, but why we should."
In a campaign marked by increasingly
personal attacks, Clinton was winning 55
percent of the vote to 45 percent for her
rival with % percent counted in
Pennsylvania.
A preliminary tabulation showed her
gaining at least 52 national convention del
egates to 46 for Obama, with 60 still to be
awarded.
That left Obama with 1.694.5 delegates,
and Clinton with 1,561.5, according to the
AP tally.
Clinton scored her victory by winning
the votes of blue-collar workers, women
and white men in an election where the
economy was the dominant concern.
Obama was favored by blacks, the affluent
and voters who recently switched to the
Democratic Party, a group that comprised
about one in ten Pennsylvania voters,
according to the surveys conducted by The
Associated Press and the TV networks.
More than 80 percent of voters surveyed

as they left their polling places said the
nation was already in a recession.
A six-week campaign allowed time for
intense courtship of the voters.
She showed her blue-collar bona fides
one night by knocking down a shot of
whiskey, then taking a mug of beer as a
chaser. Obama went bowling in his attempt
to win over working-class voters.
Clinton's win marked at least the third
time she had triumphed when defeat might
have sent her to the campaign sidelines.
She won in New Hampshire last winter
after coming in third in the kickoff lowa

caucuses, and she won primaries in Ohio
and Texas several weeks later after losing 11
straight contests.
Her victory also gave Clinton a strong
record in the big states as she attempts to
persuade convention superdelegates to
look past Obama's delegate advantage and
his lead in the popular vote in picking a
nominee. She had previously won primaries
in Texas, California, Ohio and her home
state of New York, while Obama won his
home state of Illinois.
Clinton projected confidence to the end
of the Pennsylvania campaign, scheduling

an election-night rally in Philadelphia.
Obama signaled in advance he expected to
lose, flying off to Indiana for an evening
appearance even before the polls closed.
Flush with cash. Obama reported spend
ing $11.2 million on television in the state,
more than any place else. That compared
with $4.8 million for Clinton.
The tone of the campaign was increas
ingly personal - to the delight of
Republicans and McCain, who has been
gaining in the polls while the Democrats
battle in primaries deep into the spring.

taken almost $2 million from lobbyists, cor
porations and PACs. The head of his New
Hampshire campaign is a drug company
lobbyist, in Indiana an energy lobbyist, a
casino lobbyist in Nevada," said a Clinton
commercial that aired in the final days of
the race.
Obama responded with an ad that
accused Clinton of "eleventh-hour smears
paid for by lobbyist money." It said that
unlike his rival, he "doesn't take money
from special interest PACs or Washington
lobbyists — not one dime."
Also to the delight of Republicans, the
six-week layoff between primaries pro
duced a string of troubles for the
Democrats.
Obama was forced onto the defensive by
incendiary comments by his pastor, Rev.
Jeremiah Wright, then triggered controver
sy on his own by saying small-town
Americans cling to guns and religion
because of their economic hardships.
Clinton conceded that she had not land
ed under sniper fire in Bosnia while first
lady, even though she said several times that
she had. And she replaced her chief strate
gist, Mark Penn, after he met with officials
of the Colombian government seeking pas
sage of a free trade agreement that she
opposes.
McCain campaigned in Youngstown,
Ohio, during the day Hiesday, telling resi
dents of the hard-hit steel town that free
trade can help solve their problems.
"The biggest problem is not so much
what's happened with free trade, but our
inability to adjust to a new world economy,"
McCain said during a town hall-style meet
ing at Youngstown State University
McCain's message was something of a polit
ical gamble in an area where international
trade agreements are not popular.
