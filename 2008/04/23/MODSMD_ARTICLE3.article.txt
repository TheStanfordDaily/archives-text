## Crime surges in East Palo Alto Stanford police force not affected, claims EPA crime is unrelated to Univ. crime 
### SCOTT SAYARE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The East Palo Alto Police Department launched a "crime
emergency" program on April 11 in response to a surge in
predominantly gang-related violent crime in the city.
The first quarter of 2008 saw 48 assaults with firearms, up
from 35 in the same period last year, and seven people were
shot in the first 10 days of April, according to a Police
Department press release.
"We want to get on top of it before it gets like it was last
time," said Chief of Police Ron Davis at a recent public meet
ing, referring to the final quarter of 2006 when a wave of
crime including 60 shootings and six homicides swept East
Palo Alto.
The Department has cancelled days off for all staff for the
duration of the crime emergency, which is slated to remain in
place through April 24. effectively doubling the number of
officers on the street. The increase in manpower has allowed
the Department to carry out more enforcement activities
specifically focused on gang- and narcotics-related crime.
Before the implementation of the crime emergency. Chief
Davis had already enlisted the aid of 14 other agencies,
including the CHP, ATF and FBI, in order to stem the wave
of violence sweeping East Palo Alto, according to a report by
the Palo Alto Weekly. As part of this effort, state probation
and parole officers have also been conducting searches of
known gang-members.
At the conclusion of the two-week crime emergency peri
od, six California Highway Patrol officers will join East Palo
Alto police in patrolling designated
"hotspots" of criminal activity in an
effort to maintain an increased
police presence.
"Our long-term prevention and
intervention efforts are greatly hin
dered by a continual hail of bullets,"
said Chief of Police Ron Davis in a
press release. "The crime emergency
and enhanced enforcement actions
are needed to put an immediate stop
to this alarming level of violence."

Department representatives failed
to return repeated phone calls from
The Daily.
Stanford police have not
increased enforcement or preven
tion activities in response to the
violence in East Palo Alto, said rep
resentatives of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Increased crime in East Palo Alto
has not historically influenced on
campus crime rates, according to
Chief Laura Wilson. Wilson stressed
that most on-campus violent crime
is committed by Stanford students.
"1 think there is a belief that
'outsiders' are responsible for com
mitting the majority of violent
crimes on campus," she said in an
email to The Daily. "[This] does not
appear to be the case when you
look at the statistics."
She noted that Stanford students
perpetrate the "vast majority" of
reported on-campus sexual assaults.
The FBI declared East Palo Alto
the "murder capital" of the U.S. in
1992. ITiat year, the city, which cov
ers only just over two square miles,
reported 42 homicides in a popula
tion numbering only about 23,500,
according to U.S. Census Bureau
data from 1990.The per capita homi
cide rate of 1 per 550 residents was
at the time the highest in the U.S.
In 2007, New Orleans ranked
first in per capita homicide rate in
the U.S., at 1 per 1575 residents. In
2006, East Palo Alto experienced a
rate of about 1 per 5350 residents.
East Palo Alto currently experi
ences an average of about 300 vio
lent crimes per year. 2006 saw six
homicides, down from a peak of 15
in 2005, and 99 assaults with
firearms, down from 174 in 2005.

The city's current population sits
just over 32,000.
Asked to comment on the East
Palo Alto Police Department's
efforts to quell the current out
break of violence, Sgt. Hilary Karp.
a 24-year veteran of the Stanford
police force, referenced "higher vio

lence in [the] past in East Palo
Alto."
"It's good that [they're] reacting
before things get to that level," he
said.

will have little effect, if any, on crime committed on campus.
