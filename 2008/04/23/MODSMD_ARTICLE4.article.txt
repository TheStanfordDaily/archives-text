## O'Connor advises audience Justice relays Farm memories, post-Farm hurdles as a woman 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor '50, LLB '52 spoke in a packed
Memorial Church Tuesday evening about the
influence of the late law professor Harry
Rathbun '16, Engr. '20, JD '29 on her life, and
advised the audience on how to live a fulfilling
life.
She often spoke candidly about her early
childhood experiences, including her early years
on the "Lazy B Ranch," a 250-square-mile
expanse of desert cattle range in Arizona.
"We were about 35 miles away from the
nearest town," she said. "I had my parents, and
five or six other cowboys. 1 am an unemployed
cowgirl at present.There is little chance that I'll
be able to state for you all the meaning of life."
O'Connor started college at the age of 16 and
finished law school in two years instead of the
customary three. She mentioned the vivid mem
ories of her first day at Stanford and her drive
up Palm Drive.
"[I was] overcome with the beauty of this
place." she said. "It was a cry from the dry and
arid landscape of the Lazy B Ranch."
O'Connor was the first woman to be

appointed to the legislative branch in Arizona
and the first woman to sit on the Supreme
Court, where she served from 1981 until 2006.
She was considered a crucial swing vote on the
Court for many years because of her case-by
case approach to jurisprudence and her relative
ly moderate political views. Upon her arrival on
the court, O'Connor proved pivotal in divisive
cases involving affirmative action, the death
penalty and religion. Her vote reaffirmed Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 case permitting women the right
to an abortion.
She also explained how she faced a difficult
job market after leaving Stanford. After gradu
ating, no law firm in California wanted to hire
her, and only one offered her a position as a
legal secretary.
"At law school. 1 had no understanding of the
almost total lack of opportunities for women,"
she said. "If I knew how hard it was to get a job
as a woman, I might have chosen a different
path."
O'Connor, the first annual Rathbun Visiting
Fellow, heaped praise on her former professor,
describing Rathbun as a pivotal figure in her life
and an exceedingly kind and welcoming person.
"He was the first person who told me how
the individual could make a difference in this
complex world we live in," she said. "He said if
we wanted to tackle an issue and worked toward
completing that goal, we could achieve it. Harry

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor addressed a packed Memorial
Church yesterday evening. She praised the late law professor Harry Rathbun and
relayed the difficulties of entering the law profession as a woman in the '50s.
Rathbun reminded us that freedom
and responsibility go hand in hand."
Last year, the Palo Alto
Foundation for Global Community,
headed by the Rathbuns' son, estab
lished the Harry and Emilia
Rathbun Fund for Exploring What
Leads to a Meaningful Life, with a
$4.5 million endowed gift to the
Office for Religious Life at
Stanford.
Paying Rathbun a tribute, the
former justice explained how
Rathbun believed that all science
revolved around the idea that the
universe is based on order.
"There was constant evidence of
the size of our universe, the stars and
the milky way, which you can see
when there are no lights from a near
by town," she said. "All the signs
pointed [toward] a grand design, an
ordered universe. Some called it
Mother Nature. We called it God.
Harry Rathbun believed that everv

one has religion, whether he knows it
or not."
In a question and answer session
with the audience after her speech,
O'Connor warned against attempt
ing to bend laws or assuming that a
law could be interpreted to allow for
certain, unethical activity.
"We have a greater responsibility
as human beings," she said. "We need
to ask ourselves if it is the right thing
to do. Many times that is not the
case. We have to be careful."
O'Connor urged the audience to
forge through difficult times.
"Everyone in public service has
to develop a thick skin," she said.
"You are going to get arrows and
darts thrown at you. Just deal with it.
You can."
O'Connor ended by declaring her
grave concern for the evidence
pointing to greater corruption in
Congress.
"I used to think that there was
more corruption in other countries
than our own," she said. "Today, I am
not so sure."
