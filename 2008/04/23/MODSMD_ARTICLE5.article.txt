# Admins outline endowment spending
## University continues to reject Congressional pressure to spend more 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Recent attempts by the U.S. congress to
enforce spending of university endowments
have raised questions about how Stanford
spends and invests its $17.2 billion endow
ment. To answer these questions. The Daily
recently sat down with two administrators to
discuss exactly where the money goes.
Randy Livingston, vice president for busi

ness affairs and the University's chief finan
cial officer, oversees many of Stanford's cen
tral administrative functions. He also serves
on the board of the Stanford Management
Company, which works with outside
investors to figure how to appropriately allo
cate the University's endowment.
Appointed by Stanford's Board of
Trustees, the Management Company consists
of alumni volunteers who are knowledgeable
about investments.

"Most of the money is managed as one
single investment pool, even though the
endowment itself is made up of over 6.000
endowment funds," Livingston said. "This
merged pool is allocated across different
asset categories."
Such categories include domestic and
international public and private equities,
emerging markets, real estate and natural
resources. Because Stanford has a stake in a
vast variety of funds and investments, neither

Livingston nor the Stanford Management
Company is concerned about losing the
University's endowment in an economic
downturn.
"The investment strategy is to be more
diversified," said Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82. "The more diverse, the less any
particular downturn will affect all of these
different classes [of investments]."
