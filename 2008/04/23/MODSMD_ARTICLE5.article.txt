# Admins outline endowment spending
## University continues to reject Congressional pressure to spend more 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Recent attempts by the U.S. congress to
enforce spending of university endowments
have raised questions about how Stanford
spends and invests its $17.2 billion endow
ment. To answer these questions. The Daily
recently sat down with two administrators to
discuss exactly where the money goes.
Randy Livingston, vice president for busi

ness affairs and the University's chief finan
cial officer, oversees many of Stanford's cen
tral administrative functions. He also serves
on the board of the Stanford Management
Company, which works with outside
investors to figure how to appropriately allo
cate the University's endowment.
Appointed by Stanford's Board of
Trustees, the Management Company consists
of alumni volunteers who are knowledgeable
about investments.

"Most of the money is managed as one
single investment pool, even though the
endowment itself is made up of over 6.000
endowment funds," Livingston said. "This
merged pool is allocated across different
asset categories."
Such categories include domestic and
international public and private equities,
emerging markets, real estate and natural
resources. Because Stanford has a stake in a
vast variety of funds and investments, neither

Livingston nor the Stanford Management
Company is concerned about losing the
University's endowment in an economic
downturn.
"The investment strategy is to be more
diversified," said Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82. "The more diverse, the less any
particular downturn will affect all of these
different classes [of investments]."
Etchemendy noted that, for
example, when stocks are bad. real
estate is better.
"Certainly in a bad economy, the
value of an endowment goes
down," he said.
As an example, Etchemendy
cited the "dot com bubble" in 2(M)1
and 2002, when emerging compa
nies grew and spurred an eventual
economic recession.
"In those two years, the size of
the endowment actually
decreased." Etchemendy said. "For
the last five years, we've had very
good investment performance. Any
investment is volatile, but it's
unlikely that we would lose all of
our money."
The Stanford Management
Company ensures that there are no
unnecessary risks taken with
University funds.
"The ups have been more consis
tent than the downs," Livingston

said. "There's a long-term asset
allocation strategy that changes
every three or four years. In the
short term, the Management
Company is constantly making
small changes based on what asset
managements look particularly
attractive or risky at that time."
When Stanford was established
in 1891. its endowment was larger
than that at Harvard, which was
established in 1636. But because
Stanford then was required to have
its investment in railroad bonds, its
endowment lost value.
"Railroad bonds were not a very
good investment," Etchemendy
said. "It was only in the 20th
Century that we actually went to
the state and requested that that
part of the original founding grant
be changed so that we were allowed
to invest more broadly."
Sometimes ethical dilemmas
arise with decisions regarding
investments. Stanford's Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility
(APIR) and the Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) work together to avoid such
dilemmas.

"For example, with the South
American apartheid. APIR recom
mended to SCIR to make sure we
weren't investing in companies
that dealt in South Africa,"
Etchemendy said. "The same with
tobacco. We don't invest in tobacco
companies."
Livingston also stressed the care
the University takes to avoid legal
conflicts over the allocation of
donations. Princeton University is
currently facing a lawsuit concern
ing a discrepancy between a donor's
family and university officials
regarding the spending of a dona
tion.
"We are very conscientious
about spending all of our gifts in
accordance with what the donor
wishes and what the donor stipulat
ed," Livingston said. "It's something
we spend a lot of energy on to make
sure we are acting in accordance
with the donor's wishes."
Some endowed funds — marked
as unrestricted — flow into general
funds, which pay salaries, student
services and other University oper
ation costs. The Provost serves as
the Chief Budget Officer, deciding

how general funds are allocated.
The allocation of endowment
funds has not only sparked tensions
with individual donors, but also
with Congress. Several U.S. senators
have recently contemplated the
revocation of the tax-exempt status
es of private universities across the
country, unless these universities
allocate more of their endowments
for financial aid.
Livingston shook his head at the
mention of the senators' suggestion.
"I think we have to be very
responsive to the concerns raised in
Congress, and it would be very
painful if we were to lose our tax
exempt status." he said. "We don't
believe it [will happen]."
Etchemendy agreed.
"I don't think we'll change the
way we spend our endowment," he
said. "We spend our endowment in
a very responsible way. The criti
cisms have been made by a lack of
understanding. 75 percent [of the
endowed money] is restricted, so we
can't legally change how it's spent."
