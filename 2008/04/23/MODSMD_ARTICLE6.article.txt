### CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON AND WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
After months of preparation, Saturday
marks the zero hour for Stanford's
NFL Draft hopefuls. The following is a
run-down of the draft's proceedings,
the Cardinal's prospects and what each
drafted or signed player will experi
ence until opening day.

Who's open to ploying professional football?
Eleven Cardinal seniors took part in the school's
NFL Pro Timing Day on March 20 (see insert).
Stanford's top draft prospect is senior receiver Mark
Bradford, the icon of last October's 24-23 win at
USC. Along with teammates Evan Moore and T.C.
Ostrander, he participated in the invite-only NFL
Combine in Indianapolis from Feb. 20-26. Bradford
clocked an official time of 4.69 at the Combine, but
he ran a consensus 4.49 at Stanford's pro day, signifi
cantly boosting his draft stock. He also improved his
vertical jump from an impressive 36.5" to an astound
ing 41".


The Associated Press
Mark Bradford is among a group of 14 Stanford NFL prospects
who will hope to hear their names called this Saturday and Sunday
at the annual, two day, seven round NFL Draft in New York City.

Who's going to be drafted?
According to various NFL writers, the only
Stanford players with a shot of being drafted
are Bradford, Moore and Ostrander. Brad
ford is projected to be taken in the middle to
latter half of the draft, although in a worst
case — and unlikely — scenario, he could go
undrafted. Both Moore and Ostrander are
expected to be, at best, seventh round picks.
They may end up undrafted.
If this were to occur, Moore and Ostrander
would follow their fellow Stanford brethren
into the gray area of NFL. free agency, where
teams are free to sign whoever they wish. If
Bradford, Moore or Ostrander fall out of the
draft, they would be Stanford's cream of the
crop in the free agency pool. Along with this
trio, the top Cardinal free agents will likely be
cornerback Nick Sanchez and punter Jay Ot
toveggio.
Other wide receivers in the Draft
With both Bradford and Moore leading the
Cardinal's draft class this year, Stanford's
focus will be on the wide-out corps.This year's
receiver crop is considered to be moderately
deep, but not particularly top-heavy — un
like previous drafts, there is not a clear leader.
The first receiver picked is likely to be either
Michigan State's Devin Thomas or Cal's De-
Sean Jackson. Rounding out the first round
talent is Indiana's James Hardy, Oklahoma's
Malcolm Kelly, Texas's Limas Sweed and
Michigan's Mario Manningham.
Although Bradford does not rate near these
top prospects, he may be in a situation to be a
draft steal for a shrewd general manager. He
is a talented and athletic receiver — this is ev
ident on game film — but unlike many of the
top-round prospects, Bradford has no charac
ter issues to speak of.
What's happening to Stanford's other
seniors?
Several Stanford seniors have decided to
not pursue careers in football.This includes
Preston Clover (offensive line), Peter Grif
fin (linebacker) and starters Mikal Brewer

(offensive guard), Brent Newhouse (long
snapper) and captain Chris Horn (defensive
tackle).
Three Stanford football alumni took part in
pro day with their intent on reaching the
NFL.
Safety Trevor Hooper, who was cut from the
Buffalo Bills last preseason, and Michael
Craven, who has been playing in the Arena
League, are going for a second chance at the
sport's top level. San Jose State player David
Marrero, who began his career at Stanford,
chose to participate in Stanford's pro day
rather than the Spartans'.
How the NFL Draft works
The draft follows a fairly standard procedure:
there are seven rounds, and each team has at
least one selection in each one. They are free
to trade this pick with other teams for players
and other picks. Teams draft in order of how
they place — the team with the worst record
drafts first, and the Super Bowl winner drafts
last. Some franchises are awarded extra selec
tions at the end of rounds — called compen
satory picks — because of losses in free
agency in the previous year.
This year, the NFL will introduce a new for
mat for the draft. In years past, rounds one
through three took place on Saturday, and
rounds four through seven took place on
Sunday. This year, however, only rounds one
and two will occur on Saturday. Additionally,
the time teams have been allotted to draft has
been greatly reduced. Previously, squads
were given 15 minutes per pick in the first
round, ten minutes in the second and five
minutes in rounds three through seven. This
year, teams will have ten minutes per selec
tion in the first round, and five minutes for
each round after that.
Other possibilities: CFL, AFL, AAFL and free
agent contracts
For those not drafted, the chance to play pro
fessionally is not necessarily over. After the
conclusion of the seventh round, franchises
immediately begin signing players to free
agent contracts. While many are cut before
the season begins, some productive players

emerge from this hack door to the imperfect
scouting process.
Former Stanford receiver Greg Camarillo,
now of the Miami Dolphins, has parlayed an
undrafted free-agent contract into a three
year NFL career that is still in progress.
Beyond the NFL, the professional options in
clude the Arena Football League (AFL) and
the Canadian Football League (CFL). The
CFL's structural stability and wide-open style
has allowed players to develop their skills,
leading to successful NFL careers.
The nascent Ail-American Football League,
a proposed professional league where all
players would be required to have college de
grees, has postponed its inaugural season to
2009.
What happens after the Draft?
There is a frenzy immediately after the draft
to sign the best undrafted players — this is
where many Stanford prospects will be court
ed. Within two weeks of the draft, NFL
squads will hold their individual rookie mini
camps.
Draft selections don't necessarily have to be
signed at this point, but they will still partici
pate, along with newly signed undrafted free
agents and non-roster, who were overlooked
in the draft and immediately after,and look to
eventually be signed to a rookie deal. After
the short rookie camp, players are cut, left un
signed or kept on board.
The players will next participate in team mini
camp at the end of May, where they will prac
tice with the entire team. If they survive this,
then they will receive nearly a two-month
break before full training camp, which lasts a
month from the end of July through the end
of August. During this time, rosters arc cut
down first to 75 piayers, and finally, to the 53
athletes that will make up a team's opening
day roster.
