After months of preparation, Saturday

Who's open to ploying professional football?
Eleven Cardinal seniors took part in the school's
NFL Pro Timing Day on March 20 (see insert).
Stanford's top draft prospect is senior receiver Mark
Bradford, the icon of last October's 24-23 win at
USC. Along with teammates Evan Moore and T.C.
Ostrander, he participated in the invite-only NFL
Combine in Indianapolis from Feb. 20-26. Bradford
clocked an official time of 4.69 at the Combine, but
he ran a consensus 4.49 at Stanford's pro day, signifi
cantly boosting his draft stock. He also improved his
vertical jump from an impressive 36.5" to an astound
ing 41".
