### JORDAN CHAZIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Voldemort is not J.K. Rowling's
only enemy these days.
The author of the world
renowned "Harry Potter" series
recently filed a copyright lawsuit
against the publication of an unoffi
cial "Harry Potter Lexicon" by RDR
Books. Anthony Falzone, executive
director of the Fair Use Project and
Law School lecturer, has been duel
ing Rowling in court as a representa
tive of RDR this April.
Joined by Falzone are David
Hammer, a formal federal prosecu
tor. and others including Jennifer
Urban, a visiting professor at the
Stanford Law School. Urban also
directs the Intellectual Property
Clinic at the University of Southern
California Law School. Hearings
began on April 14 and lasted three
days.
Rowling claims that the lexicon,
which was initially intended to serve
as a reference guide to her series of
books and films, provided no real
original insight to the works, and that
it relied too heavily on her own work.
