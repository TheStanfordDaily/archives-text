## Law prof. duels J.K. Rowling 
### JORDAN CHAZIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Voldemort is not J.K. Rowling's
only enemy these days.
The author of the world
renowned "Harry Potter" series
recently filed a copyright lawsuit
against the publication of an unoffi
cial "Harry Potter Lexicon" by RDR
Books. Anthony Falzone, executive
director of the Fair Use Project and
Law School lecturer, has been duel
ing Rowling in court as a representa
tive of RDR this April.
Joined by Falzone are David
Hammer, a formal federal prosecu
tor. and others including Jennifer
Urban, a visiting professor at the
Stanford Law School. Urban also
directs the Intellectual Property
Clinic at the University of Southern
California Law School. Hearings
began on April 14 and lasted three
days.
Rowling claims that the lexicon,
which was initially intended to serve
as a reference guide to her series of
books and films, provided no real
original insight to the works, and that
it relied too heavily on her own work.
The author of the Lexicon, Steven Jan Vander Ark.
admitted during testimony that he was one of Rowling's
biggest fans. Before deciding to actually write a hook
about the world of Harry Potter, Vander Ark had man
aged a Web site dealing with similar material.
When Vander Ark and RDR Books sought to publish
the book. Rowling stepped in and argued that sales of the
Lexicon would interrupt sales of the actual Potter books.
In response. Vander Ark argued that only those who had
already bought, read and enjoyed Rowling's books would
be interested in any kind of referential text for them.
Rowling said that the scope of the case extended
beyond her selling books or not. For her. it is a matter of
protecting the intellectual property and hard work of
writers. She told The New York Times that

if she loses the trial

EMILY VOGEL/The Stanford Daily

"the flood gates will open." and writers everywhere will
lose control of their material.
But Falzone told ITie Daily that, "for hundreds of
years people have been free to write dictionaries and sup
plementary materials free of restraint."
"Rowling's hooks." he said, "have already sold hun
dreds of millions of copies."
RDR Books, he said, was of the mindset that a diction
ary of Potter terms would in no way encroach upon the
sales of the 1 larry Potter book series.
In the trial's closing arguments, Falzone said that
under the law, the most important thing to consider was
not the quality of the book but whether it transformed
Rowling's material in some way.

Vander Ark was sure that his work did not do this. He
told The New York l imes that the Harry Potter Lexicon
"organizes, synthesizes and distills" thousands of pages

ind "somewhere near a million words."
Judge Robert Patterson chose to hear the trial
without a jury. He gave the case's lawyers three
weeks' time to prepare some final papers, at which
point he will make his ruling.

In the meantime, Falzone assures he is no Death
Eater out to get Rowling. Though the lawyer had

never read a 1 larry Potter book before the trial,
when he took the case he decided to read the
first book of the series and see two of the

movies, which he described as "absolutely
charming."
