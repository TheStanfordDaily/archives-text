## SEEING CLEARLY Newly-elected ASSU Execs take transparency up a notch 
### STACIE CHAN 
Newly-elected ASSU President
and Vice President Jonny Dorsey
'09 and Pagan Harris '09 meant it
when they said they wanted stu
dents to climb "All Aboard" their
campaign. Even if it meant stopping at the
empty Graduate Community Center (GCC)
last Saturday, the two were determined to an
swer any inquiries from curious students dur
ing what they called their "Office 1 fours."
Taking a new approach to make the ASSU
more transparent, Dorsey and Harris
mapped out a five-stop tour where students
could approach the two with any concerns,
suggestions or comments they had. Iliough
the GCC wasn't hustling with activity,earlier
in the afternoon Dorsey and Harris had visit
ed Roble, Xanadu and Branner. sparking
conversations about everything from mental
health on campus to disposing of those infa
mous plastic red cups to make the campus
more sustainable. After this, they would con
clude the afternoon with a stop at Old Union.
"1 think it's great that so early in their
term they're already trying to get to know
students and they're not just some unreach
able administration," said Madison Kawaka
mi 11.
Dorsey elaborated about the future of
similar sessions.
"We want them to be more than just us sit
ting in weekly office hours." he said. "We
want to go where students are actually hang
ing out and want to chat."
The two also plan to write regular articles
in The Daily, speaking directly to students
about what exactly the ASSU has been doing

for the student body. Dorm government might
also receive internal changes next year if
Dorsey and Harris implement a new position,
which will act solely as a liaison between the
ASSU and the dorm. This way, student feed
back will actually reach appropriate ears in
stead of remaining unanswered complaints.
Since being elected, the duo has barely
had time to catch their breath. Given a time
frame of two weeks from the results to their
formal induction, Dorsey and Harris have
been meeting with former Executives Her
shey Avula '08 and Mondaire Jones '09, meet
ing with Stanford Student Enterprises, at
tending Senate meetings and searching for a
chief of staff to help assemble a cabinet.
The ASSU seems like the last organiza
tion Dorsey and Harris, two self-labeled
"public service guys," would be involved in.
Already leaders in organizations like
Face AIDS, Stanford Students for Relief and
Students Taking on Poverty, as well as being
dorm staff members, adding ASSU Execu
tives to their schedule seems impossible to
juggle. But the two. who met through a mu
tual friend, were resolute in their desire to
serve the student body.
"The ASSU is the only organization that
represents every student in a theoretically
broad platform that can facilitate a large im
pact." said Harris. "So that's why we held these
Office Hours, to make sure whoever wants to
talk can corne voice their opinions. Students
can call us, email us. we just want to hear from
them."
