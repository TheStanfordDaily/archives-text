Department of Anthropology
invites nominations for
The Robert Bayard Textor
Award
For
Outstanding Creativity in Anthropology
Through this award, colleagues, friends, and former students of Professor Emeritus Robert B.
Textor join with the Textor family in honoring Professor Textor by giving recognition to the
innovation and creativity that he has encouraged in his teaching, research and writing.

annually of $500 to a Stanford student who, in the judgement of the department, has shown
outstanding creativity in the use of anthropological approaches to any significant problem. Any
student in the University, undergraduate or graduate, regardless of major or program, is eligible for
consideration of the award.
Faculties throughout the University are invited to nominate a student for this award. The faculty
member should contact Department of Anthropology (650'723-3421, selleck@stanford.edu) for
