## Singer explores animal rights Princeton prof. discusses the ethics of dietary choices 
### ALLISON DEDRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Animal rights took center stage last
night as Peter Singer delivered a talk
titled "All Animals Are Equal. But in
What Sense?" to a full house in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Singer, a professor of bioethics at
Princeton University, was the final speak
er in "The Ethics of Food & the
Environment" series, organized by the
Barbara and Bowen McCoy Program in
Ethics in Society over winter and spring
quarter.
"I think choices about what we eat is a
really important topic," Singer said,
explaining that he would be addressing
the issue from an ethical viewpoint.
Singer is often credited with initiating
the animal rights movement with the pub
lication of his book "Animal Liberation"
in 1975 — the first chapter is titled "All
Animals Are Equal."
"I stand by this view but it has been
misrepresented," Singer said. "We need to
clarify what we mean."
Singer began his talk by outlining past
and current views of the people's rela
tionship with animals. Of the few past
philosophers who address this issue —
among them Aristotle and Kant — there

is a dominant view that animals simply do
not count as living beings deserving of
ethical treatment.
"We have a background that would
license us to do anything to animals that
furthered what we wanted to do," Singer
said.
He went on to explain that by "ani
mals," he does not mean every creature
that is zoologically classified as an animal,
but only animals with consciousness.
Singer thinks evidence for consciousness
can be found in anatomical similarities to
humans and in our similar behaviors,
especially to painful situations like being
burned. He believes this consciousness is
most clear for vertebrates but will not rule
it out as a possibility for other animals.
Singer described the mainstream view
toward animals today as a combination of
kindness and cruelty.
"If you ask people today, most would
say that animals do matter and that we
have a duty not to be cruel to them," he
said. "They would say that animals do
have interests but that they are overrid
den by human interests, which include
getting animal products — like meat and
eggs — cheaply."
Singer defended the view of equality
among all creatures: he has an objection
to "speciesism" and drew an analogy to
racism.
"In both cases, we have a dominant
group who doesn't think that they have to
confer the same weight on the inter
ests of the other groups," Singer said.
"The most extreme form of racism,
slavery, is the closest to our view of
animals."
He went on to explain that animals
are sentient beings with interests,
especially the interest of being pre
vented from feeling pain.
"Pain is pain, no matter the being
who is feeling it," Singer said. "We
shouldn't give less weight to [ani
mals'] interest to not feel pain just
because of their species."
He further explained how the
issue of animal pain translates into an
ethical issue.
"I'm not saying all beings feel pain
in the same way," he said. "There are
all sorts of differences, which 1 don't
deny, in the nature of beings, but this
is a moral equality."

Singer's argument of the equal con
sideration of interests, which requires
us to give equal weight to similar inter
ests, irrespective of species, has implica
tions for eating meat from farmed ani
mals, the source of most meat con
sumed in the United States. Over 10
billion vertebrates are killed annually
in food production in the U.S.
Singer described some of the prac
tices in the production of meat and
animal products — including battery
caged hens for egg production and
sow stalls for pork — explaining that
equal consideration of interests finds
the suffering these practices inflict on
animals indefensible.
Though Singer argued that pain is
bad for all species, he did not argue
that premature death is a similar loss
for all species. Instead, he explained
that premature death is a greater or
lesser loss, depending on factors such
as a being's awareness of its existence
over time and its ability to plan for the
future.
Though he is a vegan and has been
a vegetarian since 1971, Singer does

not condemn all meat eating
absolutely. He presented Rodger
Scruton's view of "Conscientious
Omnivorism," similar to the ideas of
Michael Pollan, and noted that eating
meat could be justified in some cases.
"You could argue that people give
animals a good life and existence if
they raise them for meat." Singer said.
"This could be a justification for eat
ing meat and animal products if peo
ple are very conscious about where
they're getting their meat from."
Citing the example of free-range
hens on an organic farm in New
Jersey, Singer said, "It is hard to say it
would be wrong to eat eggs from this
type of operation, but genuinely free
range eggs is a hard commodity to
come by in the U.S."
"It becomes difficult to be a con
scious omnivore," he added, "and is
often simpler, clearer and sends a bet
ter message to not eat animals or ani
mal products at all."
