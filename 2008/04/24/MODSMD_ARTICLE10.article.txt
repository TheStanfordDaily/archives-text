Animal rights took center stage last
night as Peter Singer delivered a talk
titled "All Animals Are Equal. But in
What Sense?" to a full house in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Singer, a professor of bioethics at
Princeton University, was the final speak
er in "The Ethics of Food & the
Environment" series, organized by the
Barbara and Bowen McCoy Program in
Ethics in Society over winter and spring
quarter.
"I think choices about what we eat is a
really important topic," Singer said,
explaining that he would be addressing
the issue from an ethical viewpoint.
Singer is often credited with initiating
the animal rights movement with the pub
lication of his book "Animal Liberation"
in 1975 — the first chapter is titled "All
Animals Are Equal."
"I stand by this view but it has been
misrepresented," Singer said. "We need to
clarify what we mean."
Singer began his talk by outlining past
and current views of the people's rela
tionship with animals. Of the few past
philosophers who address this issue —
among them Aristotle and Kant — there

is a dominant view that animals simply do
not count as living beings deserving of
ethical treatment.
"We have a background that would
license us to do anything to animals that
furthered what we wanted to do," Singer
said.
He went on to explain that by "ani
mals," he does not mean every creature
that is zoologically classified as an animal,
but only animals with consciousness.
Singer thinks evidence for consciousness
can be found in anatomical similarities to
humans and in our similar behaviors,
especially to painful situations like being
burned. He believes this consciousness is
most clear for vertebrates but will not rule
it out as a possibility for other animals.
Singer described the mainstream view
toward animals today as a combination of
kindness and cruelty.
"If you ask people today, most would
say that animals do matter and that we
have a duty not to be cruel to them," he
said. "They would say that animals do
have interests but that they are overrid
den by human interests, which include
getting animal products — like meat and
eggs — cheaply."
Singer defended the view of equality
among all creatures: he has an objection
to "speciesism" and drew an analogy to
racism.
"In both cases, we have a dominant
group who doesn't think that they have to
