## Library considers new search technology 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
For students who find browsing through the
numerous reference systems and databases of the
Stanford libraries confusing or tedious, help may
be on the way.
Library officials from Stanford are negotiating
a contract for the development of a federated
search system for Stanford libraries. A federated
search is the simultaneous search of multiple
online databases. The libraries are currently coor
dinating this effort through the Rapid Prototyping

of Intuitive Discovery at Stanford (RaPIDS) ini
tiative.
The University is working with Deep Web
Technologies, a company which in part specializes
in searching commercial subscription databases, to
develop a federated search engine that will be used
by students and faculty.
Swain Chemistry Library librarian Grace
Baysinger is one of the minds behind the RaPIDS
initiative. She said that the tremendous quantity of
databases in the Stanford library systems have
become highly inconvenient for students and fac
ulty doing research.

"I think right now there's something like over
800 databases that the library has licensed,"
Baysinger said. "The number of things available
has continued to skyrocket at a high rate, and built
into this is the assumption that users will know
where to go and how to search for what they want.
Employing the federated search is an effort to
make it easier for people when they want to search
these databases, to take some of the drudgery out
of the process."
Collaborative efforts between Deep Web
Technologies and RaPIDS began in
the summer of 2007 and have result
ed so far in three pilot programs: the
first pilot searches all of the library'
catalogs at Stanford — including
Socrates, Lane Medical and SLAC
— the second pilot includes some
popular databases from the over 800
databases available at Stanford and
the third pilot searches through all of
Stanford's digital collections.
Baysinger said that students frus
trated by the inundation of articles
and facts — which often lack rele
vance to the topic at hand — often
find themselves using Google's Web
search engine or possibly Google
Scholar.
"What these students don't real
ize is that you have to purchase
access to most databases," she said.
"There are so many things that peo

ple are missing by simply going to
Google Scholar."
Baysinger also said that the intro
duction of federated search technol
ogy could allow for better search
results for students who are
researching topics from an interdisci
plinary vantage point.
"Resources that have different
perspectives can help you discover
things that you might not have antic
ipated," she said. "This can be really
useful in assimilating ideas and
insights that you wouldn't have got
ten otherwise."
Deep Web Technologies founder
and President Abe Lederman said
that federated searching is also use
ful for students and faculty who are
not sure what information sources
they need to search.
"If you were doing research and
you needed to look for information
in ten different sites, that takes a lot
of time to go to each one individual
ly," he said. "Federated search actual
ly saves you time from having to go
to each source individually, and it

ensures that you are much less likely
to miss important results."
RaPIDS and Deep Web
Technologies are currently in the
process of negotiating a contract for
the federated search product. While
Baysinger and Lederman were reluc
tant to disclose any financial figures,
Baysinger said that the initial price
estimate was neither "very cheap,
nor too expensive."
Baysinger said that efforts to
make the service better known to
Stanford students and faculty are still
in their early stages.
"I'd been working to train the staff
so they would be familiar with it since
December," she said. "The next step
will be listing the prototypes in more
pages so people have more chances
of knowing they exist. But I think
that's one of those things where you
have to tell people seven times before
it sticks. Right now, we're probably at
about two or three."
