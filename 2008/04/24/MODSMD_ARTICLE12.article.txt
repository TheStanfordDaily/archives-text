## Library considers new search technology 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
For students who find browsing through the
numerous reference systems and databases of the
Stanford libraries confusing or tedious, help may
be on the way.
Library officials from Stanford are negotiating
a contract for the development of a federated
search system for Stanford libraries. A federated
search is the simultaneous search of multiple
online databases. The libraries are currently coor
dinating this effort through the Rapid Prototyping

of Intuitive Discovery at Stanford (RaPIDS) ini
tiative.
The University is working with Deep Web
Technologies, a company which in part specializes
in searching commercial subscription databases, to
develop a federated search engine that will be used
by students and faculty.
Swain Chemistry Library librarian Grace
Baysinger is one of the minds behind the RaPIDS
initiative. She said that the tremendous quantity of
databases in the Stanford library systems have
become highly inconvenient for students and fac
ulty doing research.

"I think right now there's something like over
800 databases that the library has licensed,"
Baysinger said. "The number of things available
has continued to skyrocket at a high rate, and built
into this is the assumption that users will know
where to go and how to search for what they want.
Employing the federated search is an effort to
make it easier for people when they want to search
these databases, to take some of the drudgery out
of the process."
