## Univ. lukewarm on college rankings U.S. News and World Report survey to change 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
The influential and con
tentious U.S. News and World
Report college rankings are get
ting a makeover, with ambivalent
reactions from students and
University officials.
According to an announce
ment made last week, the maga
zine plans to collect information
from high school guidance coun
selors in a hid to make its ratings
more qualitative.
According to its Web site, the
magazine makes many changes in
its methodology from year to
year that change the relative
standing of schools. In addition to
the changes already described,
this year the rankings will also
take into account changes in the
Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching's clas
sification system, which forms the
core of the rankings.
According to Senior Assistant
to the President Jeff Wachtel. the
ranking system may be helpful as
a guide, but should not be the only
source of information guiding stu
dents' application decisions.
"Although the methodology
for the rankings is not scientific,
we believe it is beneficial for stu
dents and parents to have a range
of information available to
them," Wachtel said.
Wachtel added that the
University would likely continue
to participate in the revised rank
ings system with the changes,
although it was unclear whether
the changes would improve the
accuracy of the ratings.
"It is difficult to rank universi
ties on one scale," said Wachtel.
"Without knowing more about
the methodology, we cannot asses

this."
Students seemed apathetic
about the changes because they
did not feel that the rankings sys
tem was relevant to their college
admission decision.
According to Kiran Agarwal-
Harding '09, the primary factors
behind his decision to apply to
Stanford were the quality of the
medical school, distance from
home and weather. Additionally,
he said that the rankings were not
particularly useful to people
applying to institutions not struc
tured like Stanford.
"My sister plans on going to a
liberal arts college, so the U.S.
News ranking system wasn't very
helpful," Agarwal-I larding said.
Ashwin Mudaliar '09 was
more critical of the ratings sys
tem.
"I think it's a very arbitrary
ranking system." said Mudaliar.
"Like for example, the reputation
index â€” how do you measure
reputation on a scale of one to
five?"
Mudaliar said that he under
stood the intent behind the rank
ings, but said that it was difficult
to assess many of the factors that
were used to create the rankings.
In particular, he said that the
quality of professors is almost
impossible to ascertain because
the rankings do not take into
account important details like
teaching style.
Many students were simply
unaware of the methodology and
were skeptical of the changes
made.
"I've never heard anyone
explain exactly how they do their
rankings," said Garrett Hayes '09.
"And frankly I don't think that
most people at Stanford care
because it doesn't matter to
them; they know their school is
good."
