## GSC welcomes new members Council approves new funding measures 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) held its last full meeting of the
term last night, approving budgets for
the new term and swearing in most of
its new members.
The GSC's primary task was to
evaluate three crucial budgets for the
new term— the Special Fees
Schedule, the ASSU budget and the
GSC budget.
The first passed with a vote of 9-2-
0. After concerns were raised by
Business School Representative
Rhyan Uy about the relative pay
ments of undergraduate and gradu

ate students for special fees, GSC
members discussed the measure with
Stanford Student Enterprises CEO
Matt McDonald '05. McDonald clar
ified the differences by explaining
that graduates and undergraduates
pay different amounts per student
group towards administrative sur
charges, due to the relatively small
number of graduate student groups.
The GSC also discussed the
refund buffers in place to account for
students who choose to pursue a spe
cial fees refund.
Both the ASSU and GSC budgets
passed 11-0-0. McDonald explained
that the GSC partition of the overall
budget will be receiving more money
for the upcoming year, in an effort to
use accumulated reserves.
The GSC also approved funding
for three events at the beginning of
the meeting. Following recommenda

tions from Funding Committee Chair
Polina Segalova, the GSC gave
$3,020 to The Israeli Student
Organization's end-of-year party, cel
ebrating the 60th anniversary of
Israel's founding, and $3,770 to the
Healthcare Club Banquet, contin
gent on an adjustment in ticket
prices. TTie Persian Student
Association's Spring Party also
received $8(X).
At the end of the meeting, four
teen incoming GSC members were
sworn in, reciting "The Sacred Oath
of the GSC."
The outgoing chairs closed the
meeting on a happy note.
"Thank you all for being a part of
the GSC this year," GSC Co-chair
Kristina Keating said.
