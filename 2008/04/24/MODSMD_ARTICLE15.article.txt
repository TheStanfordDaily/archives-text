## Editorial Board Why we love Stanford part 1: Academics 
### 
Stanford is internationally recognized as
an academic all-star. However, academ
ic life here is more than just classes, term
papers and Nobel Laureates. Much like
everything at Stanford, academic life focuses
on the serious pursuit of knowledge — with
out taking itself too seriously
One of the greatest things about Stanford
is that it has strong departments for so many
subjects. The pool of ProFros here for admit
weekend are passionate about science, histo
ry. engineering, journalism, international re
lations — and the list goes on. At Stanford,
you can literally take just about any class that
you want. Want to take a graduate seminar
on Russian history? Well, you might not get
an A. but professors are usually pretty willing
to let you in. even if you are a physics major
or a freshman.
Entering Stanford, a freshman is not re
quired to choose her major until early in her
junior year, and many of these majors have
relatively small unit requirements, so fresh
man and sophomore year can be spent tak
ing classes in all different disciplines with no
particular direction. In fact.Stanford encour
ages freshmen not to get locked into a major
too early, even though it is quite easy to
switch.
Stanford is also somewhat unique among
its peers because it is on the quarter system,
which means students take three terms in a
standard school year instead of the two taken
at a semester school. With the quarter sys
tem, students are able to take more classes in
a given year for shorter periods of time. One
of the best parts of the quarter system is that
it means that students get true breaks. Spring
break falls at the end of winter quarter after
a set of finals, so there is really no studying
that needs to be done over the vacation. The
quarter system also means that it is difficult
to get bored in any one class, and you can be
finished with an unpleasant class after only
ten weeks.
However, winding up in a class that one
truly dislikes is difficult. Each quarter has a

shopping period of two weeks where stu
dents literally shop classes. Students add
classes until the third week of the quarter
and can drop them until the fourth week.
Another great thing about Stanford aca
demics is the people. Nohel Laureates will
teach your freshman physics class. Your pro
fessor might have written your textbook —
or refuse to use a textbook because no col
lege text is rigorous enough for the material.
The students around you are also great schol
ars. They have discovered math theorems,
founded non-profits, traveled the world or
even stopped out of school to do something
awesome. Anywhere you go, your classroom
experience will be shaped by your peers, and
you couldn't ask for better ones than the
ProFros joining you here this weekend.
Stanford also works hard to get freshmen
and sophomores intimately connected to top
professors in their given fields. Introductory
Seminars are small classes (usually limited to
16 students) on subjects that the professors
want to teach about. Sophomore College
classes are 14-person seminars on a variety of
subjects like Ghost Stories and Jet Engines
that convene three weeks before classes start
sophomore year.There is also a Stanford tra
dition called faculty night, during which stu
dents invite professors to have dinner with
them in their residential dining halls. Re
search opportunities and grant money are
available to allow all students to pursue their
academic passions.
Academic life at Stanford is really defined
by the fact that it is only a small part of intel
lectual life here. Intellectual life is full of
things like groups gathering around TVs for
Super-TUesday-viewing parties, dorm pro
gramming like "Crossing the Line" that
serves to challenge your identity, a Sandra
Day O'Connor Lecture on the meaning of
life or Dr. Robert Lang describing the math
ematics behind origami while leading a
group folding session. College is more than
books and lectures; Stanford will cultivate
your mind in many different ways.
