## Reluctantly American? 
### 
Santiago, Chile — When about seven of us
got arbitrarily cussed out for being for
eigners this weekend. I didn't even hear it.
"Hey assholes,get out of my fucking country!"
a young Chilean yelled at us from across the
street. According to my friends who were pay
ing better attention, the English swearing was
impressively unaccented. We were walking
home from a late night out in the coastal city of
Valparaiso, and though probably talking in
English, there was little else to draw attention,
let alone offend.
Hie next day, it happened again, only this
time it was in broad daylight while we were ad
miring an old Catholic church, and this time, it
was up close and personal, not broadly thrown
at a big group. "Get the fuck out of my coun
try," a young woman said directly to a female in
our group as they passed one another on the
street.
"She seemed so nice," my stunned friend
told me later, explaining that the girl wasn't the
kind of person she expected to curse at ran
dom tourists. "She was wearing a lot of pink."
But then again, we were not random
tourists.'!he second time, at least, we were in a
fairly large group, trickling our way from one
sight to the next, and there's a chance we may
have been speaking loudly. Size and noise al
ways draw attention, but I have a hunch that
we were recognized not only as foreigners, but
also as Americans. Other than English. I don't
know exactly what all the giveaways are. but
I'm sure they are there.
In Spanish, I'm supposed to say I'm United
States-ian, or whatever the proper translation
is back to English. We were instructed during
orientation that saying "I'm from America"
doesn't always go over too well with others
who live in a continent by the same name. Re
peating advice she's given me before, my mom
warned me several weeks ago to always say I
was Canadian. Or Irish. In her view, these two
countries have the most neutral reputations of
the English speaking world, and thus receive
better treatment — or at least less outright
spite.
But I didn't listen. I still occasionally have
the thirteen year-old's mindset in which any
advice from Mom is automatically resisted.
What's more, lying about my country of origin
has always seemed to me like a cop-out unless
you are in physical danger. And though it was
big news at the beginning of April when a BBC
poll in 34 countries found approval of the U.S.
had made a giant jump from 31 percent to 35
percent, I've never experienced enough
straight-up antagonism to make it worthwhile
to develop much of an alternate back story.
Yes, there's a lot of distrust, distaste and

even anger for the United States in many,
many other countries. Some is informed, some
isn't. But Coke and Pepsi still reign supreme.
Shows like the Simpsons, Lost and 24 are pop
ular across continents and across languages.
And despite general enmity toward the Iraq
war. and the personas of Hush. Cheney and
Rumsfeld, most people I've met in Chile and
elsewhere know that the United States is not
one giant bloc of cultural-political homogene
ity.
To he fair, the city of Valparaiso, where both
incidents occurred, is known to be a strong
hold of Chile's socialist party and leftist poli
tics. While the party is actually fairly moderate,
there are also quite a few radicals, and activist
university students. One socialist oriented
newspaper I picked up detailed "el imperialis
nio" of the United States by listing all the mili
tary outposts — down to tiny radar tracking
stations — the U. S. has strewn across the
globe. I"he list was actually really intriguing,
but the connotation of the United States as the
bad guy was clear.
So back to the bad language: how do you re
spond when someone tells you to get out? De
spite understanding and even sympathizing a
little, my first reaction is indignation. "Fine
then," 1 want to say sarcastically. "1 guess I'll
just stop spending money here. I'm sure you
know the U.S. is the second biggest consumer
of Chilean wine, but hey, whatever you want."
The next impulse was to try proving myself
different."l'm not the America you think you
hate!" I want to desperately implore. "We can
be friends! Really! I'm cool." There's a pecu
liar paradox with this sort of approach.The less
offensive, obnoxious and even noticeable I be
come. the less I am associated with the nega
tive stereotype of the United States. People
stare less, but do their views of the U.S. im
prove?
"Never lose faith in America," former Sec
retary of State Colin Powell once said. "Its
faults are ours to fix, not to curse." At the mo
ment, I'm a little puzzled about what faults I
should fix. Hut at least there are plenty of vol
unteers to curse them.
