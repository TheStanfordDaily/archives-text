# Positive Sustainability
## What would nature do? 
### 
Achieving a sustainable relationship
with the Earth will require a funda
mental revolution in the way we satis
fy our basic human needs, to avoid compro
mising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs. In order to solve the
great economic, ethical and environmental
challenges of our generation and ensure a
prosperous future for the offspring of all
species on Earth, we will need to develop
completely new ways of thinking and doing
that are inherently sustainable. The question
is, if so little about the human way of life is
sustainable today, how can we learn to
change?
Biomimicry (from bios, meaning "life,"
and mimesis, meaning "to imitate") is a new
branch of science and engineering that sug
gests we can develop sustainable solutions by
looking to natural world for inspiration. Offi
cially introduced in Janine Benyus's book.
"Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Na
ture" (1997), biomimicry proposes that na
ture is the best model, the best measure and
the best mentor we have for sustainability,
because nature already provides rich exam
ples of sustainable systems. Nature, taken
loosely to mean the collection of non-human
organisms and ecosystems on Earth, has
been sustaining and improving itself since
the dawn of single-celled life roughly 3.8 bil
lion years ago. So, what key lessons can we
take from this prolific natural scholarship?
In "Biomimicry," Benyus proposes ten
primary principles of natural sustainability:
nature runs on sunlight and uses only the en
ergy it needs. It fits form to function and recy
cles everything. Cooperation and diversity
are rewarded in nature, which demands local
specialization. It curbs excesses from within
and taps the power of limits, choosing to op
timize rather than maximize. And finally, na
ture is beautiful.
If we accept these as sensible Darwinian
metrics of our own endeavors, humans have
a long way to go indeed.Today, more than 90
percent of U.S. energy is from fossil fuels and
uranium. Incandescent bulbs convert only
five percent of electricity into light, and aver
age cars convert less than one percent of
gasoline energy into actual passenger move
ment. We care more about fads and fashion
than we do about utility, and we boast about
our ability to divert one-third of our waste
from landfills. We can't agree on an interna
tional climate plan, and we continue to Coca-
Colanize and deforest, activities that destroy
both cultural and biological diversity, while
the average meal in the U.S. travels 1,500
miles to our plates. We've never been good at
staying within our limits, instead seeing them
as a challenge to our goal of infinite growth in
a closed system.
Innovators around the world, however,
are beginning to make great strides in mim-

Nick Enge
icking nature's solutions to the very same
problems we are facing in shelter, food, ener
gy and other arenas.
Dolphins have a drag coefficient one
third that of a commercial airplane, and one
hundredth that of a Toyota Prius, making
them one of the most efficient moving ob
jects on Earth. Termite mounds are passively
heated and cooled, without fossil fuels, to
within one degree of 87oF, while outside tem
peratures range from just above freezing to
over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Migrating hum
mingbirds fly 600 miles non-stop over open
water on two grams of renewable 'organic
nectar. Ounce for ounce, a spider's dragline
silk is stronger than steel, tougher then
Kevlar, and more elastic than nylon, despite
being made from digested cricket at room
temperature. Nature is truly a master of de
sign.
Humanity is just now beginning to take
some of these natural solutions and use them
to solve its own problems. The Aptera TVp-1,

an innovative electric car coming to Califor
nia later this year, will be the most efficient
personal automobile in the world, with 300
mpg fuel economy, due largely to its aerody
namic dolphin-esque body. The Passivhaus
building energy standard, which represents
our best chance of fighting climate change in
the building sector, relies on the same tech
niques termites use to condition their homes
— solar heating, wind-driven cooling, and
temperature dampening with thermal mass.
As these practical and theoretical exam
ples show, when confronted with a design
problem, the first question to ask should al
ways be, "What would nature do?" Designs
stemming from natural inspiration are more
sustainable, more elegant and more beautiful
than anything designed in a windowless of
fice could ever be. Next time you're searching
for inspiration, just take a look out your win
dow, or a stroll around the lake. The natural
world is full of ideas.

Nick is wondering what nature would do when
faced with three midterms. Send your ideas to
