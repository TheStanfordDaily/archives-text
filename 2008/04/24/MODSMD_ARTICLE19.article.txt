## SENIORS LEAD TEAM AT NCAAS 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No, 6 Stanford women's gymnastics team is
currently in Athens. Ga. where it will prepare for the
NCAA Championships at the University of Georgia,
held today through Saturday at Stegman Coliseum.
Stanford is up for some serious competition as 12
of the best collegiate teams will face each other. Two
weeks ago. the Cardinal qualified for the meet at the
NCAA Regionals with a score of 197.525.
For the seniors, this marks not only their last
NCAA Championship,but the last time most will ever
perform gymnastics again. And this is no small loss, as
the team has six seniors in its rankings: co-captains
Tabitha Yim and Liz Tricase; Lauren Elmore, Alex
Pintchouk, Stephanie Gentry and Aimee Precourt. It
is one of the largest classes in program history.
"We weren't sure what was expected of us as
freshmen, then sophomore year we had a lot of fun.
but not enough focus; junior year we were a little too
intense," said Yim.
For Yim. the most difficult thing about being a
leader on the team is finding a balance between en

ultimate goal: six for six.
"This year the seniors have tried to help find that
balance and make sure that everyone comes in with
the same motivation and same goal so that everyone
functions as one," she added.
As the Card prepares for the championships, sen
ior Tabitha Yim (called "Tabby" by her teammates)
reflected on her time here at Stanford. She has much
to reflect upon: she has had a prolific and successful
gymnastics career. She finished high school as a qual
ifier for the US Olympic team, though injuries ulti
mately prevented her from joining.
"I suffered a lot of personal things, like my father
passing away, and then a number of serious injuries. I
have always had faith and hope in people and myself.
1 think that everything happens for a reason," Yim
said.
For her teammates, too, it is Yim's ability to reach
out and connect with others that stands above her
athletic achievements.
"She is a very caring person and a great friend. She
is motivating and inspiring, not just to our team but to
everyone she meets. And amidst all of her successes,
she is the most down-to-earth person you'll ever
meet," said Tricase.
Gymnastics is a sport that, until college, is entirely
based on individual competition and merit. So partic
ipating in collegiate gymnastics requires not only
dedication for four more years, but also the mental
adjustment to being a member of a team. So for Yim.
