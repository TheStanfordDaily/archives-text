## SENIORS LEAD TEAM AT NCAAS 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No, 6 Stanford women's gymnastics team is
currently in Athens. Ga. where it will prepare for the
NCAA Championships at the University of Georgia,
held today through Saturday at Stegman Coliseum.
Stanford is up for some serious competition as 12
of the best collegiate teams will face each other. Two
weeks ago. the Cardinal qualified for the meet at the
NCAA Regionals with a score of 197.525.
For the seniors, this marks not only their last
NCAA Championship,but the last time most will ever
perform gymnastics again. And this is no small loss, as
the team has six seniors in its rankings: co-captains
Tabitha Yim and Liz Tricase; Lauren Elmore, Alex
Pintchouk, Stephanie Gentry and Aimee Precourt. It
is one of the largest classes in program history.
"We weren't sure what was expected of us as
freshmen, then sophomore year we had a lot of fun.
but not enough focus; junior year we were a little too
intense," said Yim.
For Yim. the most difficult thing about being a
leader on the team is finding a balance between en
joying her time in the gym and keeping an eye on the
ultimate goal: six for six.
"This year the seniors have tried to help find that
balance and make sure that everyone comes in with
the same motivation and same goal so that everyone
functions as one," she added.
As the Card prepares for the championships, sen
ior Tabitha Yim (called "Tabby" by her teammates)
reflected on her time here at Stanford. She has much
to reflect upon: she has had a prolific and successful
gymnastics career. She finished high school as a qual
ifier for the US Olympic team, though injuries ulti
mately prevented her from joining.
"I suffered a lot of personal things, like my father
passing away, and then a number of serious injuries. I
have always had faith and hope in people and myself.
1 think that everything happens for a reason," Yim
said.
For her teammates, too, it is Yim's ability to reach
out and connect with others that stands above her
athletic achievements.
"She is a very caring person and a great friend. She
is motivating and inspiring, not just to our team but to
everyone she meets. And amidst all of her successes,
she is the most down-to-earth person you'll ever
meet," said Tricase.
Gymnastics is a sport that, until college, is entirely
based on individual competition and merit. So partic
ipating in collegiate gymnastics requires not only
dedication for four more years, but also the mental
adjustment to being a member of a team. So for Yim.
one of the most important things about being a mem-

ber of the Stanford team is her abili
ty to shape and create a legacy with
the kind of chemistry that a team
needs to turn individual competitors
into team players.
"We have been able to hold each

other accountable and really reach
our potential," she said. "We brought
the program back and just created
such a strong bond within the team,
and we're leaving that as motivation
to fuel future generations of
women's gymnastics here at Stan
ford."
Yim reflects on her career here
not on an individual level, but as one
piece of what has become her family
at Stanford.

"I am really going to miss seeing
the girls every day and having the in
teractions, especially because I am
not coming back next year and 1 feel
like I have made such a bond with
the other seniors," she said.
"One of my highlights was Na
tionals last year, especially at prelims
when we were on beam last and just
looked at each other, and we just
knew that it was how it is supposed to
be. And we all just came together."

With all of her experience, success
and tribulations, Yim is keeping the
upcoming competition in perspec
tive.
"Actually I don't feel as nervous
as 1 have in the past because this is
the last meet 1 will ever do gymnas
tics and that really helps put perspec
tive going into this weekend. 1 just
want to soak up the time with my
teammates. Practices are going well
and we are finally getting into the

rhythm," Yim said.
After this weekend, Yim, along
with her fellow seniors, will end her
lifelong career in gymnastics. She
will no longer be attending grueling
practices and traveling every week
end. but hopefully the sentiment and
character she helped create in the
program will continue. While she will
be deeply missed by both her team
mates and fans, Yim will be taking
her leadership skills, kindness and

dedication to the nonprofit sector.
"I have an internship in New York
City with a program called All Stars.
1 worked at Camp Kesem last sum
mer and I'll be working there this
summer. It got me interested in phi
lanthropy, and now 1 would like to
pursue a career in nonprofit work,"
she said.
All in all. teammate and co-cap
tain junior Kelly Fee put it best:
"Tabby is just magic."
