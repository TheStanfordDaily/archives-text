## Registrar's office shuffles staff 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
The Office of the University Registrar has imple
mented the first of many changes to the office, which will
eventually include modifications in staff and office
design, as well as the shifting of many Registrar services
to the Internet.
According to Jackie Charonis, Assistant Vice Provost
for Student Affairs and Associate University Registrar,
an ongoing "staff transition" is currently in process, with
some new staff members being hired and others leaving
the office. While Charonis was not legally permitted to
acknowledge whether layoffs have taken place, she did
confirm that staff movement is underway.
Since the Registrar's office vacated its former loca
tion in Old Union and moved to the Harold Modular
two years ago, the office has taken steps to shift duties
away from the Registrar and decrease the size of the
office. At the beginning of the fall quarter, the Office of
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education took
over responsibility for handling student forms relating to
academic standing.
Within the last month, the Registrar closed its mail
room — through which it personally handled the mailing
of transcripts and other student forms — and contracted
the work to an independent company outside the
University. Charonis claimed that, following the move

from the Old Union office, the quan
tity of mail had decreased significant
ly-
"lt didn't make sense that we
needed two full-time people working
for dramatically less mail," she said.
But Charonis noted that the office
has found that, working through its
current mailing service, student forms
and other mail take considerably
longer to arrive at their destinations,
and that the office is looking for
another mailing service that will han
dle deliveries more quickly.
She said that, in the future, she
would like to see an increase in the
number of students working behind
the counter of the Registrar to assist
other students.
"In my experience, students help
ing other students gives some of the
best experiences," Charonis said.
As early as this summer, Charonis
said, the lobby of the Registrar's
office will be remodeled to provide a
more "welcoming" feel for students
who come in to speak with members
of the office. At the same time, how
ever, the office is trying to move as

many of the responsibilities and serv
ices of the Registrar away from the
traditional model of students filling
out forms and handing them in at the
office to a new model that utilizes the
Internet as much as possible.
"I can't see us not ever having
face-to-face interactions with stu
dents," she said, "but we want to
increase options for students."
Charonis believes that the
Registrar's office may eventually
develop online programs to meet the
petitioning needs of students without
having them physically come into the
office. Ibis could potentially include
online functions by which forms
requiring the consent of a professor
or administrator can be signed and
processed entirely online.
In the long run, Charonis said she
sees the Registrar's office moving
toward a more "service-oriented"
format in which students do not need
to visit to handle the processing of
forms, but in which the same number
of people will be in the office to assist
students who want to discuss matters
personally.
"I think you'll see this going on for
the next five years or longer,"
Charonis said.
