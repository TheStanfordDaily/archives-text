fore the NCAA tournament at the

overshadow the slew of Cardinal
players entered in the tournament
this weekend in Ojai, Calif.There are
two brackets, a Championship and
an Invitational bracket, with the
Championship bracket being the pri
mary one.
Four Stanford players are entered
in the Championship bracket:

Wiechert of Oregon.
In doubles, two Stanford teams
will compete in the Championship

much success together earlier this

Marcos Verdasco from Oregon in

with the No. 2-seeded Brooklyn and
TJ Bellama from Arizona State waits

if Muller and Kelly are victorious in
round one.
Wire and Hirshman, Stanford's
best doubles team this year (a 19-10
record), drew the No. 1 seed. Robert
Farah and Kaes Van't Hof of USC.

In the Invitational doubles, Kao
and Zeller will team up against Mar
tin Kildahl and Tobi Obenaus from
Washington in the first round, while
Kaiser and Morrissey will play Jack
Marsh and Murilo Souza from Ari

This weekend will be a great way
for players to get match experience
in before the team championships
start.
"A lot of guys get to play (this
weekend]," Whitlinger said. "We go
down there to get match play in and
continue to get better."
"[The Pac-10 tournament] is a good
way to keep our focus and intensity
going into NCAAs." said Zeller.
Stanford has had a lot of success
in singles over the past few matches,
which bodes well for this weekend
and beyond. Unfortunately the
same cannot be said about doubles,
in which Stanford has struggled re
cently.
"We have been struggling the last
few matches with our doubles,"
Muller said. "But the way everyone
has been battling back in the singles
is great to see.
"I'm feeling really confident
going into Ojai and NCAAs," he
continued. "1 think once we get our
full line-up back and with the way
everyone has been playing and com
peting, we can beat anyone."
The Pac-10 tournament will last
four days, with the first round of sin
gles starting this morning and the
first round of doubles starting to
morrow. The championship matches
are set to be played on Sunday.
