### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference is never easy.
The Pac-10 women represent 29 of the top 125 singles players in
the nation and 10 doubles teams in the top 60.
So on Thursday, when all convene in Ojai, Calif, for the Pac-10
Championships, it will certainly he interesting to see who comes out
on top.
Leading the field is the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team, who
clinched a share of the conference title last weekend.

With most of its lineup par
ticipating in this weekend's
tournament, Stanford will he
well represented.
"It's always a nice tourna
ment at the end of the season
that everybody knows they can
compete in," head coach Lele
Forood said. "It keeps every
body knowing that they're get
ting ready for something at the
end of the season. It's very im
portant. and it's a great oppor
tunity for everybody to pump
their resumes a bit and feel
good about their game heading
into the NCAA tournament."
The championship singles
bracket features freshman Hi
lary Barte as the No. 1 seed.
After her dominating play last

Junior Jessica Nguyen is ranked No. 12 in the country. She will play doubles this weekend with senior Whitney
Deason at the Pac-10 Championships in Ojai, Calif..
Pac-10 Player of the Week award in a
three-week span.
She is also ranked No. 3 in the lat
est national poll.
"Her record and her play for the
last two months have been phenome
nal," Forood said. "We all knew she
had this kind of talent, but things
weren't in place early in the season to
have her play at the top of the lineup.
Things changed, she got her shot and
I'm extremely impressed with her
consistency with every single match.
"She's improved a lot as a player
as well, and that's allowing her to do
this well."
Barte will face Aleksandra Ste
fanova of Washington State in the
first round, as she tries to string to
gether a championship run.
"She's beaten everybody in the
tournament largely, although she has
n't beaten Cristina Visico [of Califor
nia]," Forood said. "Her chances are
very good to win the Pac-10. But you
have to go out there and play five
good matches."
Joining Barte in the singles brack
et are sophomore Lindsay Burdette
and freshman Carolyn McVeigh, who
will face Oregon's Carmen Seremeta
and California's Visico, respectively,
in the first round.
However, missing from the fields
are junior Jessica Nguyen and last
year's semifinalist, junior Celia
Durkin.
"They're basically working on get
ting 100 percent healthy which they
currently aren't, so they're limited in
what they can do this week," Forood
said.
Also missing from the field is
Southern California's Lindsey Nel
son, the Trojans' best player.
"The Pac-10 individual tourna
ment is an interesting event," Forood

said. "It's whoever's healthy and
ready to go who wants to be the Pac
-10 champion. It'll give us a chance for
the people who are ready to go to
compete for the title, which is great,
and the people who aren't to get
healthy."
In doubles, the teams of Barte and
Burdette and senior Whitney Deason
and Nguyen will represent the Cardi
nal.
Also playing this weekend will be
junior Isamarie Perez, freshman Jen
nifer Yen and senior Lejla Hodzic.
In the latest rankings, all six play
ers in the Stanford singles lineup are
ranked in the top 100, though that
isn't a rare thing according to Forood.
"It just says that we have a lot of
good players on our team, which is
quite frankly usually the case,"
Forood said. "We've had six or even
seven ranked in the past — it's not a
novelty. It's not that important — it's
more important that everyone goes
out and plays well in the team tourna
ment."
As Stanford heads into the tour
nament, Forood is also glad to see
that it is still an individual tourna
ment, preserving the longtime tradi
tion of the tournament.
"There's some movement in our
conference to change it to a dual
match tournament and I'm very op
posed to it," Forood said. "It gets dis
cussed every year at the annual
coaches meeting at Ojai.
"In two weeks time, we're playing
the biggest tournament of the year
and the possibility of playing confer
ence teams later in the NCAA tour
nament is very high," Forood said.
"I'd prefer not to have to play them
again this weekend."
With two weeks left until NCAAs,
the Cardinal will have a chance to
bolster its play and rejuvenate itself
before a shot at its fourth national
title in five years.
