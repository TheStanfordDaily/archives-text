## Stanford sixth at Pac-10 Tournament 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's golf team entered the
Pac-10 Championships as the sixth-best team in
the conference, and despite momentum heading
into the tournament, was unable to improve upon
its ranking — the Cardinal finished in sixth place.
No. 25 Stanford came into the Pac-lOs with
plenty of momentum and high hopes. They won
their first tournament of the year, the Peg
Barnard Invitational, on April 12, and looked to
continue their success against their conference
opponents.
"We have a lot of confidence," said junior
Catherina Wang on Monday. "The [Peg Barnard]
was very important to our psyche."
In preparation for the tournament, the Cardi
nal spent extra time working on its putting; the
team's short game has been sporadic all year.
"[We've] been working phenomenally hard on
our games and it just makes our whole team at
mosphere very positive," said Wang.
But when the tournament started, the Cardinal
soon found itself in a hole, as strong performances
from No. 1 UCLA, No. 3 Southern California and
No. 4 Arizona State left Stanford 17 shots out of
first place after the first round. However, they
stood only a single shot behind fifth place, and cer
tainly within striking distance of a top finish.
Such a result hinged on a successful second
round, but the day did not bode as well for the
Cardinal as it would have hoped — the team
worsened its first round score by six shots, and
was in seventh place. With that performance —
and the continued stellar shooting of the Bruins,
Trojans and Sun Devils — the
Cardinal's chances of a top three
finish slipped away.
Still, with a stellar third round
(and a bit of luck), Stanford could
have conceivably crept into the top
five — the team finished the sec
ond day ten shots behind fourth
place.
The Cardinal made a
respectable push in the final round,
but they simply could not catch
either California or Arizona, who
tied for fourth place. The women
finished five shots behind the
Golden Bears and the Wildcats, but
moved up a position to their ulti
mate sixth place slot with a final

team score of 61-over-par.
Stanford was led by Wang, who
shot one-under-par in the final
round to finish in a tie for tenth in
the individual rankings. Following
her was junior Mari Chun — nor
mally Stanford's leader, although
she's been eclipsed by her team
mates in recent tournaments —
who ended with a score of 16-over,
and sophomore Angela King, who
entered the clubhouse at 17-over.
Rounding out the Cardinal scorers
were a pair of freshman. Piper
Miller and Rebecca Durham, who
placed in 30th and 34th, respective
ly-
The tournament, though,
belonged to USC who finished at
eight-over-par, an incredible 26
shots lower than second place
UCLA. Trojan Paola Moreno won
the individual tournament at -1,
and all four of her USC teammates

placed in the top ten — none shot
worse than +7. Wang, by contrast,
led Stanford at +10.
Arizona State, who finished in
third, had three players in the top
ten and could have easily taken sec
ond place, but was brought down
by poor performances from their
other two team members.
But the Sun Devils finished far
ahead of Arizona and Cal, illumi
nating the makeup of the Pac-10:
although it's deep, it is fairly top
heavy, as UCLA, USC and Arizona
State have been dominant through

out the year.
It comes as no surprise, then,
that the three squads nearly swept
the conference awards, which were
presented at the tournament.
UCLA's Tiffany Joh won Pac-10
Golfer of the Year, while USC's
Lizette Salas and Andrea Gaston
took home Freshman of the Year
and Coach of the Year, respectively.
The All-Pac-10 Team was com
prised of three Trojans, two Sun
Devils, two Bruins and a lone
Wildcat. Stanford had two players
on the award lists: Chun was named

to the Second Team, and Wang was
given an honorable mention.
Now, Chun, Wang and the rest of
their Cardinal teammates will await
judgment from the NCAA to see if
their season continues. The NCAA
Regional brackets will be
announced on April 28, and the
Cardinal is looking for a spot in a
tournament in which it placed fifth
last year.
