# Admits compare financial aid offers
## New aid policy a draw for Class of 2012 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford, Harvard, Yale and a host of other top
tier schools all announced sweeping reforms to their
financial aid policies earlier this year, each phrased
somewhat differently. But according to admitted stu
dents interviewed by The Daily, their aid packages
were markedly similar.
"They would have greatly affected my decision if
[aid offers from Yale, Stanford and Columbia] had
significantly differed," said Angela Londono, a stu
dent admitted to the Class of 2012. "But as they
don't, [aid] doesn't really play a factor any more."
Students admitted to the Stanford Class of 2012 will
not pay tuition if their families make under $100,000
a year — and will not pay room and board if their
families make under $60,000.
Students said that, in most cases, Stanford's policy
has about an equal pull for low- and middle-income
families when compared to the policies of schools
like Harvard, Princeton and Yale.
Still, a few minor disparities existed.
"Stanford's financial aid award is what made the
decision for me. given that Georgetown was offering
a lot less," said admit Anton Zietsman.
Sam King, another admit, said Stanford gave him

the best offer of all the schools to which he was
admitted except Columbia. At Stanford, he was
awarded $47,000 out of $52,000. and at Columbia, he
received $49,000 out of $51,000.
"Stanford was my first choice and 1 am going
there, but financial aid was one of the most impor
tant factors for me," he said.
For others, generous offers from other schools
were more of a pull.
"Having three other children whom they plan on
sending to college, my parents were very worried
about the cost." said admit Dominic Insogna, who
did not receive a financial aid package in the early
action round. "But after Stanford released their new
aid program, we received about $8,000 in aid. [While
that] may not sound like a lot, it meant a lot to our
family."
"Right now. I'm inclined and willing to go to
Princeton because of the better offer |$ 12.000], even
though Stanford would be my first choice on equal
footing, unless Stanford can match aid offers from
competing schools," Insogna continued. "I am also
considering substantial merit awards from other uni
versities."
Other students faced a choice, not between
Stanford and other top-tier schools
with generous aid packages, but
between Stanford and relatively
low-priced state schools.
Huy Phan, another admit, was
deciding between Stanford, Emory
and Georgia Tech, largely based on
the prices she was asked to pay at
each school. But Stanford's pack
age won out.
"When I received my Stanford
financial aid last week." she said, "it
was the most offered by any of my
schools."
"Financial aid definitely affects
families like mine, where the
income is around $100,000 and
there are other siblings in the fami
ly that need college money as well,"
she added. "In my case, Stanford's
generosity has made my decision a
little bit easier."
Phan was not the only admit
choosing between top tier schools
and state schools. Ben Jensen, an
admit from Las Vegas, said that he
too felt financial pressure to choose
between a top tier university and a
state school.
"As a middle class American, it
seems more and more today that if
you apply to schools ... your only
choices financially are the institu
tions in your state or the elite pri
vate schools," he said.
"College is becoming more and
more expensive," he added. "It is
the duty of college to educate
America, not to drive it further into
debt. Stanford understands that."
Merit aid was a concern for lYoy

"The new aid policy
has helped make
my Stanford dream
into a reality?'

Wu, who received generous offers
from Vanderbilt and Emory.
"Stanford also won't consider
merit money when I argued with
them or tried to talk to them to see
if there's anything they could do to
increase my aid package," he said.
"They wouldn't consider my merit
for anything along those lines. But I
just went ahead and committed
because I wasn't going to go to
those other schools."
But for many students, aid was
one of many factors in making their
college decisions. Lan Panchevre of
San Antonio is attempting to
decide between Stanford,
Princeton, Yale, Columbia and
Georgetown. While he had not ini
tially applied for aid because he did
not think he would qualify,
Stanford encouraged him to file an
aid application after learning that
other schools were offering him
money to attend.

"Stanford said they didn't want
money to be an issue so whatever
other schools were offering they'd
be willing to match," he said.
"If they're willing to invest a lit
tle bit of money in us, it's obvious
that they want us to go." Panchevre
added. "My top two choices are
Princeton and Stanford, and if
Stanford comes up with something
nice I'll definitely be swayed in that
direction."
Panchevre particularly noted
how important it was for him to
feel wanted by schools that he was
considering.
"There's a sense that [students]
kind of want to go where they feci
wanted." he said. "When you have
one school that's calling you all the
time and sending you letters, it's
kind of like another school has
dropped the ball. I think that get
ting a generous financial aid offer is
a strong indicator of whether or not
the school wants you to come."
And for many students, that
indicator is coming from Stanford.
"Stanford's financial aid award
is what made the decision for me,"
Zietsman said.
In Jensen's situation, as has been
the case for many other students,
the aid offer he received from
Stanford has made attending the
school a serious possibility instead
of just a dream.
"My first choice now is Stanford
because ... Stanford has made it
possible to pursue an education at
their institution without incurring
massive amounts of debt," he said.
"The new policy has helped make
my Stanford dream into a reality."
