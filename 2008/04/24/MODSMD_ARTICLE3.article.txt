# Admits compare financial aid offers
## New aid policy a draw for Class of 2012 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford, Harvard, Yale and a host of other top
tier schools all announced sweeping reforms to their
financial aid policies earlier this year, each phrased
somewhat differently. But according to admitted stu
dents interviewed by The Daily, their aid packages
were markedly similar.
"They would have greatly affected my decision if
[aid offers from Yale, Stanford and Columbia] had
significantly differed," said Angela Londono, a stu
dent admitted to the Class of 2012. "But as they
don't, [aid] doesn't really play a factor any more."
Students admitted to the Stanford Class of 2012 will
not pay tuition if their families make under $100,000
a year â€” and will not pay room and board if their
families make under $60,000.
Students said that, in most cases, Stanford's policy
has about an equal pull for low- and middle-income
families when compared to the policies of schools
like Harvard, Princeton and Yale.
Still, a few minor disparities existed.
"Stanford's financial aid award is what made the
decision for me. given that Georgetown was offering
a lot less," said admit Anton Zietsman.
Sam King, another admit, said Stanford gave him

the best offer of all the schools to which he was
admitted except Columbia. At Stanford, he was
awarded $47,000 out of $52,000. and at Columbia, he
received $49,000 out of $51,000.
"Stanford was my first choice and 1 am going
there, but financial aid was one of the most impor
tant factors for me," he said.
For others, generous offers from other schools
were more of a pull.
"Having three other children whom they plan on
sending to college, my parents were very worried
about the cost." said admit Dominic Insogna, who
did not receive a financial aid package in the early
action round. "But after Stanford released their new
aid program, we received about $8,000 in aid. [While
that] may not sound like a lot, it meant a lot to our
family."
"Right now. I'm inclined and willing to go to
Princeton because of the better offer |$ 12.000], even
though Stanford would be my first choice on equal
footing, unless Stanford can match aid offers from
competing schools," Insogna continued. "I am also
considering substantial merit awards from other uni
versities."
Other students faced a choice, not between
