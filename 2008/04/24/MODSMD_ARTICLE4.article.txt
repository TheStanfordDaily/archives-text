# STUDENT GROUPS
## Political groups await November 
### ALAN GUO 
With the Democratic and Republican National
Conventions still months away, student groups for the
respective parties are biding their time, waiting until the
November election draws nearer to kick off major cam
paign activities.
Hilary Clinton's 10 percent lead in Pennsylvania's
primary' on Tuesday showed that the Democratic pri
mary race may be far from over. Meanwhile,
Republicans nationwide have been try ing to build sup
port for McCain since he clinched the party nomination
in February. But here at Stanford, student political
groups on both sides seem to be waiting for the primary
season to end for real mobilization to begin.
Admittedly, neither the Stanford Democrats nor the
Stanford College Republicans has been very active
since the California Primary, when Stanford students

voted in record numbers.
"We are setting up infrastructure [for the general
election]," said Ashwin Mudaliar '09, the political

director of the Stanford Democrats.
He noted that the success of voter registration

and student mobilization in the primary has set a good
precedent for the general election.

Debashish Bakshi '08, another active member of
Stanford Democrats and President of Students for
Obama, echoed this sentiment.
"1 imagine campus mobilization in the fall general
election will look a lot like our mobilization for the Feb.
5 primary," Bakshi said.
Bakshi observed that the Obama campaign already
appealed to a number of independent voters and
Republicans on campus. He said that in the event of an
Obama nomination, the message of the campaign will
not be much different.

"Stanford
students are, however, still involved in the campaign,"
Bakshi said. "This weekend a number of volunteers
from Stanford (flew] out to Pennsylvania to work on the
Obama campaign."
Republican organizers, on the other hand, found it
hard to stir up the same kind of sentiment among the
predominantly liberal student body.
