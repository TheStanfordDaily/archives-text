# STUDENT GROUPS
## Political groups await November 
### ALAN GUO 
With the Democratic and Republican National
Conventions still months away, student groups for the
respective parties are biding their time, waiting until the
November election draws nearer to kick off major cam
paign activities.
Hilary Clinton's 10 percent lead in Pennsylvania's
primary' on Tuesday showed that the Democratic pri
mary race may be far from over. Meanwhile,
Republicans nationwide have been try ing to build sup
port for McCain since he clinched the party nomination
in February. But here at Stanford, student political
groups on both sides seem to be waiting for the primary
season to end for real mobilization to begin.
Admittedly, neither the Stanford Democrats nor the
Stanford College Republicans has been very active
since the California Primary, when Stanford students

voted in record numbers.
"We are setting up infrastructure [for the general
election]," said Ashwin Mudaliar '09, the political

director of the Stanford Democrats.
He noted that the success of voter registration

and student mobilization in the primary has set a good
precedent for the general election.

Debashish Bakshi '08, another active member of
Stanford Democrats and President of Students for
Obama, echoed this sentiment.
"1 imagine campus mobilization in the fall general
election will look a lot like our mobilization for the Feb.
5 primary," Bakshi said.
Bakshi observed that the Obama campaign already
appealed to a number of independent voters and
Republicans on campus. He said that in the event of an
Obama nomination, the message of the campaign will
not be much different.

"Stanford
students are, however, still involved in the campaign,"
Bakshi said. "This weekend a number of volunteers
from Stanford (flew] out to Pennsylvania to work on the
Obama campaign."
Republican organizers, on the other hand, found it
hard to stir up the same kind of sentiment among the
predominantly liberal student body.
Irina Oberman '09, vice president of Stanford

College Republicans, attributed the
lack of active political participation
from the Republican side to "the
politically correct atmosphere here,
which tends to be less divisive than,
say, at Berkeley where conservatives
band together due to a real sense of
persecution."
The College Republicans, howev
er, have remained active by hosting
speaker events and meeting with
Republican Party officials through
out the year.
Looking ahead to the general
election, Oberman said she believed
McCain can unite the party despite
his divergence from the conventional
conservative stance on numerous
issues.
"He definitely is at odds with
many groups within the party on
many issues," Oberman said, "but
many people are focusing on
McCain's electability and his attrac
tion for independent as one of his
major assets."
Mudaliar was equally optimistic
about post-primary party unity
despite the drawn-out nomination

process.
"The press is taken off John
McCain, and the press is put on
Clinton and Obama.so they get more
exposure," he said. "And exposure is
usually a very good thing."
Bakshi also did not see an obsta
cle in uniting the party after the pri
mary.
"While I do not think it would be
possible for the two campaigns to
merge into the same ticket," he said,
"we are all Democrats who believe
that a McCain presidency would take
the country in the wrong direction —
both domestically and globally."
When asked about the tension
between the College Republicans
and Democrats, both sides acknowl
edge the near non-existence of antag
onism.
"We have a very cordial working
relationship with the Republicans,"
Mudaliar said.
The College Republicans and
Stanford Democrats jointly host an
Internship Fair in the fall to get stu
dents more involved in the political
process of an election. Mudaliar
heaped praise on both groups in one
respect — they keep students politi
cally active.
