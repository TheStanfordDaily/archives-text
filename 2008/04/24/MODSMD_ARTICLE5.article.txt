GAME NOTES: No. 5 Stanford was victorious last
night over Saint Mary's for the first time this
season. Stanford was led by junior Brent
Millevile, who was 2-5 with 4 RBIs and the go
ahead doubles in the bottom of the eighth to
put Stanford on top for good.The Cardinal will
next host USC in a three-game Pac-10 series
starting tomorrow night.

Brent Milleville came through in the
clutch. Again.
With the bases loaded and the game tied
in the eighth inning against St. Mary's
Wednesday night, the junior first baseman,
who drove in the winning runs against San
Francisco and Santa Clara last week, hit a
two-out, three-run double to put Stanford in
front, 7-4. It was the Cardinal's first lead of
the night, and it stood — the Gaels came up
empty in the top of the ninth, giving No. 5
Stanford its eighth win in nine games.
It was a night of perseverance for the
Cardinal, who trailed by three after two
innings. The team relied not only on the
timely hitting of Milleville and his offensive
compatriots, but also on the arm of freshman
Alex Pracher.
Junior Max Fearnow started for Stanford
and ran into trouble early, as he loaded the

Stanford's 7-4 win over visiting Saint Mary's. It was Stanford's eighth win in
its last nine games.
bases in the first inning and eventual
ly surrendered two runs. At times, he
looked in control of the game — he
struck out the first two batters he
faced in the second inning. But
Fearnow struggled with control
problems throughout the night —
the third Gael run came in on a wild
pitch, and the fourth was set up by
another wild pitch that put a runner
in scoring position.
With the score at 4-2 in favor of St.
Mary's in the fifth inning, coach
Mark Marquess replaced Fearnow
with Pracher, who would subse
quently turn in the best pitching per
formance of his Cardinal career.
He went the distance for Stan
ford, striking out five and giving up
only three hits (and no walks or runs)
in the process.
"I just wanted to throw strikes,"
said Pracher. "We've had a great of
fense all year, so 1 wanted to give
them a chance to come back."
He used a combination of his fast
ball and slider to fool batters — the
latter was an effective put-out pitch.
As the game progressed, so too did
the movement and accuracy of his
pitches.
"1 developed a bit of a better slid
er today," he said.
Pracher is part of a bullpen con
tingent that only seems to get deeper
as the season progresses. Although
the focus for most of the year has
been on the potent Cardinal offense,
the arms have been widely successful
of late, which only bodes well for
Stanford's late-season and postsea
son chances.
"We're starting to see the depth of
our pitching," said Milleville.
With Pracher in control, the Car
dinal was able to fight its way back,
but it wasn't without help from Tay
lor Reid, St. Mary's erratic relief
pitcher. He replaced starter Anthony
Aloitti in the fifth, inheriting the
Gaels' two run lead.
But it wouldn't last.
The Cardinal placed runners on
the corners with two outs in the fifth.
Reid was able to strike out Joey Au
gust to seemingly end the inning, but
the pitch was far wide of the catcher,
and went to the backstop. August
hustled to first on the dropped third
strike and Jason Castro raced home
to score. The next batter, freshman
Zach Jones, singled home senior
Randy Molina to tie the game.
The score would stay knotted at 4-
4 until the bottom of the eighth,
when Reid walked three batters to
load the bases and set the scene for
Milleville. Reid delivered an outside
fastball, and Milleville drilled it the
opposite way into the gap. Jake Sch
lander and Brendan Domaracki
scored easily, and Castro hustled all
the way from first to beat the throw
to the plate.
Milleville said that he expected

and was looking for a pitch outside to
hit. But, even he was a bit stunned by
the result.
"I wasn't trying to do too much
with it," Milleville said."All we need
ed was one run."
"He's a tough out." said Mar
quess. "He's using the opposite field
well."
The Cardinal lead seemed secure,
as Pracher recorded the first two outs
of the ninth. But a single and an error
by Schlander put two runners on in a
dangerous situation — the Gaels'
best hitter, first baseman Kyle
Jensen, was the next batter up.
Jensen entered the game leading St.
Mary's in nearly every statistical cat
egory: average (.407), hits (55), runs
(35), homeruns (12) and RBIs (41).
In dramatic fashion, Jensen
launched a ball into right field. Jeff
Whitlow — a defensive replacement
for Domaracki — sprinted in for the
catch, sliding and snagging the ball in
one motion. Whitlow actually ran so
hard for the ball that he overshot it a
bit, and had to reach back during his
slide in order to reel it in. It was the
defensive play of the game for the
Cardinal, and was a fitting end to a
suspenseful match.
Stanford is next in action this
weekend, when they host USC for a
three-game set in a crucial confer
ence match-up.
"The Pac-10 is the strongest [con
ference] in the country," said
Milleville. "A big win this weekend
would be huge."
