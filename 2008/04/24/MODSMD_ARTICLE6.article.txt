# STUDENT LIFE
## ProFros flock to the Farm for Admit Weekend 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Over 1,200 prospective freshmen — "ProFros" in
Stanford-speak — will descend on campus today to get a
glimpse of life on the Farm and decide their fate for the next
four years.
Admits will have the chance to eat a picnic lunch on the
Oval, play pick-up basketball at the Ford Center, tour the
Cantor Art Center's Rodin collection and attend the ever pop
ular a capella concert in Frost Auditorium, among numerous
other scheduled activities.
"It's very comprehensive," said Dean of Admission
Richard Shaw about the weekend. "It's almost a year in the
planning. We are working very hard over a two-day period to
give students a significant exposure to the campus. It's proba
bly one of the most comprehensive programs in the country."
A packed schedule that includes % scheduled events over
three days surely does not lack comprehensiveness, hut could
leave some admits feeling overwhelmed,
"These are pretty smart kids, and this is a matter of them
making choices of what their interests are," Shaw said. "Will
there be a student out there that gets overwhelmed? 1 sup
pose so, but I gather that it will be in the significant minority."
It is Shaw's hope that the weekend's wide range of choices
will give ProFros a sense of how many choices they will have
if they decide to come to Stanford in the fall.
"We want to put our best foot forward," he said. "We don't
want (to have] five choices and force everybody into them —
we want to give them lots of opportunities. The key here is to
say that there are a lot of choices at Stanford."
For some admits, getting a general feel for the campus is
more important than attending prescheduled events.
"I'd like to show up and get that gut feeling that this is it,"
said Pro Fro Raillan Brooks, who said he is on the verge of
committing to Stanford. " Ihere's not much they can do in the
way of programming that would affect that."
Dean of Freshmen Julie Lythcott-Haims '89 agreed that
one of the most important parts of Admit Weekend is just get
ting a sense of the Stanford vibe.
"Admit Weekend gives ProFros an intense immersion into
the place, its offerings, its character, its personality, its people
— and our foibles and quirks as well," she said. "Attending
Admit Weekend helps a Pro Fro form that gut feeling about
the place."
But getting a gut feeling about a place as large and compli
cated as Stanford is not an easy task.
"We are trying to give students a taste — that's all you can
