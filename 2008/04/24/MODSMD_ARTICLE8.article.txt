## LEAVE ME ALONE! The 						best places to find solitude on campus 
### RUTH McCANN STAFF WRITER 
If you're not familiar with the Mvers-Briggs
system, you should be — it's an excellent, in
triguing field of study. For the purposes of
this particular endeavor, though, it is enough
to say that the Myers-Briggs test determines,
among other things, whether an individual is pri
marily introverted or extroverted. Semi-dubious
Internet sources tell us that two-thirds of the
American population consists of extroverted per
sons. Frightening information for us introverts!
But the comforting news is, the numbers are
skewed here at Stanford. I would guess that most
— let's say 70 percent — of us Stanfordians are in
troverts. Myself included.
And all of us introverts (and even, at times,you
perverted extroverts) feel the occasional over
whelming need to escape. Don't be ashamed to
admit it — we all crave anonymity at some point.
In response to this, then. I will share my most
prized secret with you: places to be alone on cam
pus.
Don't think that I reveal this information lightly
— I'm terrified that I will return to these places to
find them teeming with blissed-out introverts. But
that's just a risk I'll have to take. This is my gift to
all the independent, thoughtful. iPod-laden kids
out there. And with no further ado. I reveal to you,
gentle readers, the top ten places to be bloody
alone at Stanford:

10. The History Building
In the Evening
If you're skipping around the Quad in the evening,
chances are some building will be open, or at least
accessible via an unlocked window. In my experi
ence. Building 60 is often a good bet. But the most
consistently available space is the History Build
ing, which stays open for late-night lectures,
screenings and cleanings. Though there might be
academics clustering in the basement, you can
usually find a vacant room on the upper floors.The
faculty lounge on the third floor is particularly
comfortable — I once slept there without being
questioned.
9. The Education Courtyards
In the Evening
The Education Building is that friendly edifice be
tween the Bing Wing and the Clock Tower. This
building features two courtyards on either side,
one of which serves as the entrance to that base
ment cafe that won't take credit cards. You know
the one. In any case, both courtyards are depend
ably vacant at night. On the Clock Tower side, you

will find a charming patio avec foun-

tains and benches. On the Bing
Wing side, a slightly dingy area
with metal chairs, tables and
hedges that will mercifully shield
you from the view of passersby.

8. The Margaret Jacks Courtyards
In the Evening

If you're stuck in the Quad at night

and find yourself yearning for a place to sit and
chat (to yourself), try the courtyards outside build
ing 460 (aka Margaret Jacks Hall, aka the English
Department). The basement-level patio is the
same place where people sit during the day, eating
their food from the tres sketchy Thai Cafe. Al
though it's spacious and accessible, that particular
courtyard is admittedly gloomy and dark. So if
you're in the mood for a more aesthetically pleas
ing location, make your way to the itsy-bitsy patio
across from the Rodin sculptures. While this court
yard is technically only accessible from within the
English Department, some quick fence-hopping
will gain you entrance to this choice location,
which features charming outdoor furniture. Be
ware raccoons!
7. The Inner Quad Roundabouts
Afternoon Onwards
Inner Quad Roundabouts sounds like an exercise,
doesn't it? Well it isn't. You know those well
groomed circles of greenery in the midst of the
Inner Quad? Well, venture to the middle of one of
these vegetation-locations, and you'll find a con
crete bench that is well hidden from public view,
thanks to the ample surrounding foliage.These lo
cations score points for beauty, but lose points for
bugs/caterpillars.
6. The Hewlett and/or Packard Quad
In the Evening
Behind the Earth Science building, discover the
Hewlett/Packard Quad. (You can find it on a map
if you're confused).There,you'll find a truly beau
tiful stretch of patio that is spacious, calming and
charmingly lit at night. Be sure to visit the two
fountains, which burble contentedly and offer
some nearly adequate seating. It's true that this lo
cation is pretty out-in-the-open, but remember
that the prime benefit of this little spot is its at
mosphere. It's good for rambling around. iPod-lis
tening, a calming cigar or a chat with an imaginary
friend. If it rains, seek shelter under the eaves of
Terman.
5. Bytes Cafe
Monday-Friday, 7:30 a.m. - 5.-00 n.m.
Okay, you can't be alone at this cafe, but you can
be fairly sure that it won't attract an undergradu
ate crowd. Expect to see harried grad students,
profs, tourists and me. Bytes is located in the Com
puter Science building, just a few paces away from
the Quad, and it's mightily crowded at lunchtime,
but service is blessedly quick. Despite its sicken
ingly cute name. Bytes boasts a refreshingly chic
and mature atmosphere, in addition to a tempting
menu of enticing salads, sandwiches, espresso
drinks, etc. And they serve Coke (not Pepsi). Be
ware CS grad students! Their fertile years are run
ning low. and they're on the hunt for a mate...
4. The Stacks
Whenever Green is Open
We all know that the stacks are a fab place to find
solitude, but they're so reliably wonderful that
they undoubtedly deserve a privileged place on
this list. It is a rare occasion when I cannot find an
empty desk in the stacks, which are accessible
through both Green East and the Bing Wing. The
stacks occupy tiny half-floors, they're incredibly
stark and they smell like moldering books —
specifically books on German philosophy and
California highways. But God, the stacks are
great. Almost every floor offers a huge blonde
wood desk and two smaller cubicles in which to
conduct your solitary musings. If you ever run
across any other human beings, know that they

will also be total introverts and will not
want to talk to you. This is also a

wonderful place to bring your
Moonbeans harvest and eat in
peace. Make sure to bring a

blanket — the stacks can get
chilly. Also, beware fellow stu
dents getting it on. I have never
seen action-in-the-stacks, but I

have heard tell. So bring head
phones.

3. The Arizona Garden and The Mausoleum
Ail day, every day, except the night of the Mau
soleum Party, clearly.
If you're into death, the Mausoleum is the spot for
you. Although it's a long way away from every
thing, don't begrudge this famous tomb a visit. The
burial place of Leland Stanford (our favorite pre
teen boy wonder), the Mausoleum is surprisingly
beautiful and has some nice ledges, which are well
suited for sitting. This posh tomb can be a teensy
bit morose, but you can always cheer yourself up
at the Arizona Garden (more often called the Cac
tus Garden), which is just a few steps away. The
Cactus Garden features... erm... cactuses. Lots of
them.These specimens are actually pretty spectac
ular— envision sky-high cacti — and they look
beautiful in the moonlight. Speaking of which,
these locations have pretty poor lighting, so be
sure to visit them under a full moon! Once again,
beware raccoons.
2. The Cool Cafe at Cantor
Wed. Fri-Sun: 11a.m.-5p.m.; Thurs: 11am.-Bp.m.
It is entirely possible for an undergrad to spend
four years at Stanford without going to Cantor.
And indeed many do. Consequently, the Cantor
museum — not to mention the delightful organic
manic cafe that adjoins it — is the perfect location
for the Stanford introvert. The museum boasts a
permanent exhibit that includes Leland Stan
ford's death mask (!), and the temporary collec
tions are always worth a visit. Admission is free for
students, and you can sit and read inside, as long as
you don't bring a pen (with which to write filthy
limericks on Leland Stanford's personal effects).
But the star of Cantor's collection is the Cool
Cafe, which is usually frequented by profs, visitors
and the elderly population of Palo Alto. The food
is succulent, if pricey, but you can always just order
a cup of tea (the cheap chick's favorite) and sit on
the outdoor patio watching the Rodins.This is one
of my favorite locations on the Stanford campus
— it's perfect for reading and noshing, and it's es
pecially delicious on sunny days. Beware small
children.
1. The Hoover Institution
Always
Hoover is the perfect place to go when you don't
want to see or be seen. In my years of frequenting
the Institution (specifically, the courtyards behind
the tower), 1 have only once seen someone I know,
and he was so shocked by my presence that he
nearly slopped his latte down the front of his pink
Oxford and seersucker pants. It's deserted at
night, and it's sparsely populated during the day.
Hoover is my favorite solitary haunt: the court
yard is rather gorgeous, it's full of benches and it's
well-lit until late in the evening.

yard is technically only accessible from within the
English Department, some quick fence-hopping
will gain you entrance to this choice location,
which features charming outdoor furniture. Be
ware raccoons!
7. The Inner Quad Roundabouts
Afternoon Onwards
Inner Quad Roundabouts sounds like an exercise,
doesn't it? Well it isn't. You know those well
groomed circles of greenery in the midst of the
Inner Quad? Well, venture to the middle of one of
these vegetation-locations, and you'll find a con
crete bench that is well hidden from public view,
thanks to the ample surrounding foliage.These lo
cations score points for beauty, but lose points for
bugs/caterpillars.
6. The Hewlett and/or Packard Quad
In the Evening
Behind the Earth Science building, discover the
Hewlett/Packard Quad. (You can find it on a map
if you're confused).There,you'll find a truly beau
tiful stretch of patio that is spacious, calming and
charmingly lit at night. Be sure to visit the two
fountains, which burble contentedly and offer
some nearly adequate seating. It's true that this lo
cation is pretty out-in-the-open, but remember
that the prime benefit of this little spot is its at
mosphere. It's good for rambling around. iPod-lis
tening, a calming cigar or a chat with an imaginary
friend. If it rains, seek shelter under the eaves of
Terman.
5. Bytes Cafe
Monday-Friday, 7:30 a.m. - 5.-00 n.m.
Okay, you can't be alone at this cafe, but you can
be fairly sure that it won't attract an undergradu
ate crowd. Expect to see harried grad students,
profs, tourists and me. Bytes is located in the Com
puter Science building, just a few paces away from
the Quad, and it's mightily crowded at lunchtime,
but service is blessedly quick. Despite its sicken
ingly cute name. Bytes boasts a refreshingly chic
and mature atmosphere, in addition to a tempting
menu of enticing salads, sandwiches, espresso
drinks, etc. And they serve Coke (not Pepsi). Be
ware CS grad students! Their fertile years are run
ning low. and they're on the hunt for a mate...
4. The Stacks
Whenever Green is Open
We all know that the stacks are a fab place to find
solitude, but they're so reliably wonderful that
they undoubtedly deserve a privileged place on
this list. It is a rare occasion when I cannot find an
empty desk in the stacks, which are accessible
through both Green East and the Bing Wing. The
stacks occupy tiny half-floors, they're incredibly
stark and they smell like moldering books —
specifically books on German philosophy and
California highways. But God, the stacks are
great. Almost every floor offers a huge blonde
wood desk and two smaller cubicles in which to
conduct your solitary musings. If you ever run
across any other human beings, know that they

will also be total introverts and will not
want to talk to you. This is also a

wonderful place to bring your
Moonbeans harvest and eat in
peace. Make sure to bring a

blanket — the stacks can get
chilly. Also, beware fellow stu
dents getting it on. I have never
seen action-in-the-stacks, but I

have heard tell. So bring head
phones.

3. The Arizona Garden and The Mausoleum
Ail day, every day, except the night of the Mau
soleum Party, clearly.
If you're into death, the Mausoleum is the spot for
you. Although it's a long way away from every
thing, don't begrudge this famous tomb a visit. The
burial place of Leland Stanford (our favorite pre
teen boy wonder), the Mausoleum is surprisingly
beautiful and has some nice ledges, which are well
suited for sitting. This posh tomb can be a teensy
bit morose, but you can always cheer yourself up
at the Arizona Garden (more often called the Cac
tus Garden), which is just a few steps away. The
Cactus Garden features... erm... cactuses. Lots of
them.These specimens are actually pretty spectac
ular— envision sky-high cacti — and they look
beautiful in the moonlight. Speaking of which,
these locations have pretty poor lighting, so be
sure to visit them under a full moon! Once again,
beware raccoons.
2. The Cool Cafe at Cantor
Wed. Fri-Sun: 11a.m.-5p.m.; Thurs: 11am.-Bp.m.
It is entirely possible for an undergrad to spend
four years at Stanford without going to Cantor.
And indeed many do. Consequently, the Cantor
museum — not to mention the delightful organic
manic cafe that adjoins it — is the perfect location
for the Stanford introvert. The museum boasts a
permanent exhibit that includes Leland Stan
ford's death mask (!), and the temporary collec
tions are always worth a visit. Admission is free for
students, and you can sit and read inside, as long as
you don't bring a pen (with which to write filthy
limericks on Leland Stanford's personal effects).
But the star of Cantor's collection is the Cool
Cafe, which is usually frequented by profs, visitors
and the elderly population of Palo Alto. The food
is succulent, if pricey, but you can always just order
a cup of tea (the cheap chick's favorite) and sit on
the outdoor patio watching the Rodins.This is one
of my favorite locations on the Stanford campus
— it's perfect for reading and noshing, and it's es
pecially delicious on sunny days. Beware small
children.
1. The Hoover Institution
Always
Hoover is the perfect place to go when you don't
want to see or be seen. In my years of frequenting
the Institution (specifically, the courtyards behind
the tower), 1 have only once seen someone I know,
and he was so shocked by my presence that he
nearly slopped his latte down the front of his pink
Oxford and seersucker pants. It's deserted at
night, and it's sparsely populated during the day.
Hoover is my favorite solitary haunt: the court
yard is rather gorgeous, it's full of benches and it's
well-lit until late in the evening.

If you're not familiar with the Mvers-Briggs
system, you should be — it's an excellent, in
triguing field of study. For the purposes of
this particular endeavor, though, it is enough
to say that the Myers-Briggs test determines,
among other things, whether an individual is pri
marily introverted or extroverted. Semi-dubious
Internet sources tell us that two-thirds of the
American population consists of extroverted per
sons. Frightening information for us introverts!
But the comforting news is, the numbers are
skewed here at Stanford. I would guess that most
— let's say 70 percent — of us Stanfordians are in
troverts. Myself included.
And all of us introverts (and even, at times,you
perverted extroverts) feel the occasional over
whelming need to escape. Don't be ashamed to
admit it — we all crave anonymity at some point.
In response to this, then. I will share my most
prized secret with you: places to be alone on cam
pus.
Don't think that I reveal this information lightly
— I'm terrified that I will return to these places to
find them teeming with blissed-out introverts. But
that's just a risk I'll have to take. This is my gift to
all the independent, thoughtful. iPod-laden kids
out there. And with no further ado. I reveal to you,
gentle readers, the top ten places to be bloody
alone at Stanford:

10. The History Building
In the Evening
If you're skipping around the Quad in the evening,
chances are some building will be open, or at least
accessible via an unlocked window. In my experi
ence. Building 60 is often a good bet. But the most
consistently available space is the History Build
ing, which stays open for late-night lectures,
screenings and cleanings. Though there might be
academics clustering in the basement, you can
usually find a vacant room on the upper floors.The
faculty lounge on the third floor is particularly
comfortable — I once slept there without being
questioned.
9. The Education Courtyards
In the Evening
The Education Building is that friendly edifice be
tween the Bing Wing and the Clock Tower. This
building features two courtyards on either side,
one of which serves as the entrance to that base
ment cafe that won't take credit cards. You know
the one. In any case, both courtyards are depend
ably vacant at night. On the Clock Tower side, you

will find a charming patio avec foun-

tains and benches. On the Bing
Wing side, a slightly dingy area
with metal chairs, tables and
hedges that will mercifully shield
you from the view of passersby.

8. The Margaret Jacks Courtyards
In the Evening

If you're stuck in the Quad at night

and find yourself yearning for a place to sit and
chat (to yourself), try the courtyards outside build
ing 460 (aka Margaret Jacks Hall, aka the English
Department). The basement-level patio is the
same place where people sit during the day, eating
their food from the tres sketchy Thai Cafe. Al
though it's spacious and accessible, that particular
courtyard is admittedly gloomy and dark. So if
you're in the mood for a more aesthetically pleas
ing location, make your way to the itsy-bitsy patio
across from the Rodin sculptures. While this court
yard is technically only accessible from within the
English Department, some quick fence-hopping
will gain you entrance to this choice location,
which features charming outdoor furniture. Be
