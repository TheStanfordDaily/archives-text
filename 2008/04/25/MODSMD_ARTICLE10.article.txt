## Prof, seeks lighter sentence Fisher myites death penalty case before Court 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Law Prof. Jeff Fisher is no
stranger to the Supreme Court —
he's argued before the high court
nine times. But when he stepped in
front of the nine justices last week to
argue the case of a convicted child
rapist hoping to avoid the death
penalty, the stakes were higher than
they ever have been before.
Fisher, the co-director of the
Stanford Supreme Court Litigation
Clinic, is representing Patrick
Kennedy, a Louisiana man who has
been sentenced to death for raping
his eight year old stepdaughter. If his
death sentence is upheld, Kennedy
will become the first rapist to be exe
cuted in America since 1964.
According to Fisher, such a ruling
would open the door to the expan
sion of the death penalty as punish
ment for a variety of other crimes,
and increase the number of inmates
eligible for the ultimate penalty five
fold.
"This was definitely one of the
very biggest [cases] that I've done, in
terms of the intensity and impor
tance," Fisher said. "The constitution
al cases always have a weightier air in
the room because the Court really
has the final say."
But the constitutional implica
tions of the case are only partially
responsible for its importance to
Fisher. The Court's decision is literal
ly a matter of life and death, some
thing that Fisher saw firsthand after
visiting Kennedy in Louisiana's
Angola State Prison.
"There are ways we would love to
see this case decided for the develop
ment of the law," Fisher continued,
"but once you meet the client and get
to know him and understand what
the consequences are, everything
changes. When you walk out of the
prison that day, you say 'whatever it
takes to win this case for the client."'
Fisher said that there are three
directions the Court can go in with its
ruling, which is expected to be
revealed in June.The Court can either
expand the death penalty and rule in
favor of the state, or it can rule broad
ly in favor of Kennedy and strictly
limit the death penalty to homicide
cases. A third possibility, in which the
Court would find the Louisiana
statute that allows for execution of
child rapists too broad, is the most
likely scenario according to Fisher.
"Consensual sex between an 18
year old and a 12 year old is a capital
offense right now in Louisiana,"
Fisher said. "The Court may say
that's too broad."
A ruling in favor of the state
would be the most far-reaching
choice the Court can make.
"If the state wins, it's a watershed
event," Fisher said. "It would be a
dramatic decision, the first time in
modern jurisprudence the Court has
allowed the death penalty for a crime
in which somebody didn't die."
During oral arguments for the
case last week in Washington, the
Justices appeared to split along famil
iar partisan lines, with more conser
vative Justices Roberts and Scalia
pressing Fisher's argument against
the death penalty, and more liberal
Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and
Breyer supporting Fisher's anti
death stance.
"I'm always disappointed as a law
professor when issues of the Court
are so predictable because of
divides," Fisher said. "One of the
things you want from the court is a
legal institution, not a political one.
As a professor you want legal argu
ments to be of a different flavor."
Fisher wasn't alone in preparing
for the case. Three Stanford Law stu

dents accompanied Fisher to
Washington for the oral arguments,
traveled to Louisiana to visit
Kennedy and helped write the briefs
and speeches.
"From an educational perspective
we are working with the best lawyers
that are out there, and to work that
closely with them and see them do
what they do is just amazing," said
Patrick Nemeroff J.D. "09, who along
with Andrew Dawson J.D. '08 and
Ruth Zemel J.D. *09 assisted Fisher
with the case.
"It wasn't something I imagined
I'd have the opportunity to do when
I came to law school," he said.
