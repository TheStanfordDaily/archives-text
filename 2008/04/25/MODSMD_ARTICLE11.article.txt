## Quirky strings attached to some gifts 
### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
Receiving a donation from the Stanford
donor community is a lot like receiving a
present from a family member. Their gift
might be a check with no strings attached,
a gift card that requires the money be used
in certain ways or something slightly unex
pected.
Monetary gifts are usually given for one
of four basic uses, according to Rebecca
Smith Vogel, Senior Director for
Communications and Stewardship at the
Office of Development. Donations can be
given to support faculty or students, to sup
port programs or research or to build and

maintain facilities. They can also he untied
to a specified goal.
"When people place restrictions on a
gift, it typically has to do with things that
interest them." said Cecilia Evangelista,
Special Assistant to the Vice President in
the Office of Development.
But these interests are not always aca
demic or professional. Florence Moore is
rumored to have donated the money to
build Florence Moore Hall on the condi
tion that ice cream he served in its dining
hall everyday.
Non-monetary donations often fall
under the tender care of university
archivist Margaret Kimball, who collects,
preserves and makes available the docu-

ments of the University
and the Stanford family.
The archives include
papers donated by the
University's past profes
sors, documentation of
Stanford's founding, as
well as the peculiar inter
ests of the Stanford commu
nity and its donors.

When a member of the class of
1949 passed away, he assigned the
copyright of his 1974 play, "Dracula,"
to the University The adaptation of
Bram Stoker's classic novel had a

successful run on Broadway and is
still being produced in local commu
nity theatres.
Kimball believes that the gen
erosity of the University's donors is
rooted in the charitable tradition
begun by Jane and Leland Stanford.
"When people give things to the
University, they become more widely
available," Kimball said. "It's a way
of leaving a legacy similar to what
the Stanfords themselves did.

They're building on what Stanford
left us."
We are constantly reminded of
the founders' legacy of giving. A
Patek Philippe watch that originally
belonged to Jane Stanford was
recently put up for auction on e√üay.
Stanford originally sold the watch in
l l X)8 to help raise money for the
library.
Although the University did not
bid for the watch, a Stanford sup
porter purchased it and donated it to
the University where it is currently
on display at the Cantor Arts Center.
The generous donor, Pierre Schwob,
who paid $28,000 for the watch, is
not even an alum.

The oddest collection in the
archives, according to Kimball, is the
assortment of objects that material
ized to Leland Stanford's brother
during seances. But Kimball said that
even these oddities came into use
this year by an undergraduate writ
ing a paper on Victorian mysticism.
Kimball said her goal is for every
student to be able to have that expe
rience and to gain some history of
the University before leaving
Stanford.
Even if that means having a
seance.
