## Editorial Board Why we love Stanford Part 2: Student life 
### 
Our academics are amazing.There's defi
nitely no question about it. That's likely
a major reason why you're here reading
this today. But if you get a chance to sit down
and talk to a few undergraduates,you'll see that
we have a great time outside of the classroom
too.
As you've probably already seen over the
past few days, Stanford puts a lot of effort into
making sure that we enjoy ourselves as much as
possible. And it pays off: Stanford students are
consistently shown to be some of the happiest
in the country'.
Take our dorms. Dorms are the center of so
cial life for many of us. Stanford has a freshman
dorm experience unlike any other college or
university. This is particularly thanks to a
unique student staffing program that helps
make sure that your dorm is there for you. in
many different ways. You see some of that same
energy in the Hoi los and RoHos that are help
ing out this weekend.
Dorms at Stanford, particularly those with
freshmen, spend a lot of time organizing activ
ities to keep you active and involved. Your
dorm will probably take you to San Francisco
to have a mad scavenger hunt around the city.
Your dorm will likely play Assassins, where,
armed only with a water gun, you have to hunt
down fellow dorm-mates. Your dorm might
make a film for the annual film fest, have bar
beques on Fridays or have movie screenings
every week. You might play broomball with
your dorm or perhaps even indoor skydiving
(believe us, it can be done). No matter what,
you can be sure you'll be in for some good
times next year.
Outside the dorm, a lot of us organize
through student groups. We have a massive
number of student groups on campus. If you
passed through the Activities Fair, or if you go
to any of the various performance shows this
weekend, you'll see just how many cool things
you can do here. You can join a martial arts

group, an entrepreneurship leadership group, a
swing dancing team or a political debate group,
to name a few.
If you're interested in community service,
our I laas Center for Public Service is national
ly recognized as one of the best of its kind. You
can join various programs to do service locally,
nationally or internationally. The Haas Center
doesn't stop just there — it also is a great re
source to learn about policy and 'advocacy, if
you are interested in that side of service.
We haven't even touched on sports at Stan
ford! We have one of the most robust athletic
programs in the country — 70 NCAA team
championships since ICM).1 C M). We have amazing
coaches and trainers, and our facilities are top
notch. If you're not an athlete yourself, there is
always something great to go see, especially if
you have friends on sports teams. You might
even join of one of the various sports fans
groups on campus, ranging from the Red Zone,
for football, to the 6th Man, for men's basket
ball. to the Brickyard Club, which cheers on
women's basketball.
If, after all this,you still have time left over,
there are always many events happening on
campus. One weekend you might see the big
Rams' I lead spring musical, another weekend
you might go listen to Salman Rushdie speak.
You might attend the annual Stanford Pow
wow, or you might dance all night long to raise
money for Dance Marathon's charities. You
can sign up for a student-led conference on
women's issues, or you can sign up to be a test
subject for psychology experiments.
'ITiere are a huge amount of opportunities,
and they are never going to stop coming.There
are so many great things in store for you fresh
men year, we're getting jealous just writing
about it.'lhe fact is, this campus is so much more
than just a school. We certainly surprised our
selves the day we called our parents and acci
dentally referred to Stanford as "home." We
hope that you'll soon be part of it.
