## Resounding mediocrity 
### 
It's Admit Weekend again, and
that can only mean one thing for
all the ProFros out there: conver
sations about all the other colleges
you got into. Along with the weather,
a capella concerts and the "where are
you from?" questions, talk of other
colleges is par for the Admit Week
end course.
And no doubt ProFros out there,
unwittingly falling into a historical
tradition as old as the Cal rivalry, will
run into That Guy. who broadcasts
proudly that Stanford was his second
choice. That Guy is definitely going
to Harvard. Whether it was because
he wanted to enjoy the weather for a
weekend on his parents' dime, or be
cause he wanted to take the opportu
nity to gloat, he has decided to attend
Stanford's admit weekend regard
less. His blue monogrammed blazer
is almost as irritating as his penchant
for discussing obscure Greek
philosophers, ones you're sure he
read about on Wikipedia.
Many claim that That Guy is the
most annoying person ProFros will
run into all weekend. But I beg to dif
fer. That Guy is easily dismissed, as a
self-absorbed and out of touch wind
bag. No, an even greater danger is to
be found in That Other Guy, who
very well might be going here, but
complains incessantly about Stan
ford's cultural poverty.
He will repeat those oft-stated

criticisms of highly competitive
schools. "They can't think for them
selves," he will, ironically, parrot.
"They've spent all high school fol
lowing directions, doing anything to
get a good grade and they haven't
had time to think for themselves."
His thick-rimmed plastic glasses
will tap against the side of his caffe
macchiato coffee cup when he takes
a sip. He will continue, "it's a shame
that America's elite institutions can't
cultivate creativity anymore, only
producing mindless robots for the
anarchofascist machine."
Disregarding the fact that this is a
wholly inappropriate usage of the
prefix "anarcho" and suffix "fascist,"
his claim, I must admit, has a sort of
appeal. It feels great to make state
ments that call whole swaths of peo
ple robots. The fact that the bound
ary between robot and human is not
clearly defined here acts to your ad
vantage. No one would make such a
statement about the un-creativity of
the mindless masses, if he believed
genuinely that he himself were un

creative. It gives the guy saying it a
free pass to "brag" about his person
al creativity, without having to show
any evidence for it.
Add to this the fact that, some
where along the line, it entered into
the popular hipster consciousness
that getting good grades was anathe
ma to creativity. If you do well in
school, the logic goes, it is because
you spend all of your time studying,
which means you can't spend your
time smoking pot. making preten
tious artwork, and talking about it in
privately-owned coffee shops.
That Other Guy, that Admit
Weekend hipster, is the worst of all.
Because this guy is secretly very
proud that he got in here, and he's
going to stay. Unlike Mr. Harvard,
we've got to deal with his elitism for
the next four years, or maybe more.
The other day, I once again hap
pened upon the virtual bathroom
wall that is
www.boredatstanford.net. In case
you didn't know, this is an anony
mous chat board that allows Stan
ford students to post whatever com
ments they so desire, without attach
ing their name to them. Cloaked in
the veil of anonymity, people say
some pretty ridiculous things. But in
a way, I see it as a kind of hive mind
at Stanford â€” this is what we as a
