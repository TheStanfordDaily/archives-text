# Oddities and Katie-o-Syncracies
## A few college pet peeves
### 
Just last week, a girl answered her
cell phone in a 20-person lecture.
And I began to think about all the
other little things that make me cringe
inside. So here is an incomplete list of
things that rub me the wrong way, get
my panties in a twist and leave me
wondering if other people dislike
them too:
1) When a Chapstick is running out,

your lips in hopes of getting any little
bit of lip balm.
2) Powerpoint slides that have size 10-
point font and contain the informa
tion of a novella.
3) Laptop use at inappropriate times.

like during presentations, slide shows
in art class, or movie clips.
4) Irrelevant, off-topic, or anecdotal
questions in class.
5) The last inch of lead in a mechani

throw away, yet just short enough to
not click out any farther.
6) E-mails to dorm lists about needing

a black pen, a cowboy hat or an econ
book.
7) The garbage truck at Bam on Satur
day mornings, whose reversing beeps
are just similar enough to your alarm
clock that you get very confused.
8) Getting a fresh pair of socks wet
from the mysterious and constant
flood in the dorm bathroom.
9) Gross hair in the dorm sink.
10) Gross hair in the dorm shower
drain.
11) Any hair I find that is not attached
to my head and is not attached to
somebody else's.
12) Speed biking to your first class of
