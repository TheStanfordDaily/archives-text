## Card running away from Pac-10 Stanford athletes have stranglehold on conference's season-bests 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's and women's track
and field teams began the week with a series
of honors and successes. On Monday, junior
Hari Mix was named Pac-10 Male Track Ath
lete of the Week after a personal best in the
5,000 meter run at the Mt. SAC Relays over
the weekend. Mix's award marked the first
time that a Stanford athlete had been hon
ored by the Pac-10 in such a manner.
Mix's time of 13:56.28 was a regional stan
dard, the top time in the Pac-10 in the event
this far this season, and a personal best for
Mix. It was also the first time Mix has ever
posted a sub-14 minute in the 5,000 meters.
Mix also currently holds the fastest time in
the Pac-10 for the 10,000 meter run
(28:50.87).
Still, the junior was modest when describ
ing his personal-best race.
"I have a lot to gain in terms of my race fit
ness and mental performance before the
championships roll around," Mix said. "My
main goal is to place as highly as possible at
the NCAA Championships, but I'm also
looking to contribute big points at Pac-lOs.
Right now, I'm looking forward to the Cardi
nal Invitational, where I'll run the 10k to
qualify for the Olympic Trials this summer."
Mix approaches each race as a perform
ance,"! get excited to make a contribution to
the race, whether that's making a decisive
surge, a big kick, or just hanging on at the
back of a pack. 1 have a great support group
of my teammates and the guys I live with,
who get me pumped to put on a show."
In addition to Mix's award. Arianna Lam
bie, an alumnus of the cross country and
track programs who ended her eligibility
with Stanford this winter, was recently
named the recipient of the 2008 Pac-10
Sportsmanship Award. The Sportsmanship
Award is selected by members of the Pac-10
Student-Athlete Advisory Council, and is
based on good sportsmanship and ethical be
havior during intercollegiate athletics,as well
as a demonstration of good citizenship and
camaraderie outside of the athletic competi
tion setting.
The honors for the Stanford Track and
Field team did not end with Mix and Lambie.
Thfrty-five track and field athletes were
named to the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) All-Academic team. TTiis
award is given to student-athletes who are at
least sophomores academically, and have a
minimum GPA of 3.0. The 35 honorees for
Stanford were the most of any of the ten
teams in the conference.

Several other Stanford men and women
join Hari Mix to lead the conference in their
respective events. Leading in the 1.5(H) me
ters is Garrett Heath with a time of 3:40.51.
Graeme I loste leads for the pole vault, with
his mark of 18 feet. 4.75 inches. The women
are led by an outstanding triple jumper. Erica
McLain, who is ranked first in that event (46
feet, 7 inches) and tied for first in the long
jump (21 feet. 3 inches). McLain is joined in
the high ranks by teammate Lauren Cen
trowitz.who leads in the 1.500 meter run with

a time of 4:18.63.
After racking up these academic and ath
letic distinctions, the Cardinal travels across
the Bay this weekend to compete in the Bru
tus Hamilton Invitational at UC-Berkeley.
Stanford will also send eight athletes to the
Penn Relays to compete in the men's and
women's distance medley relay.
'ITie men's OMR team consists of Garrett
Heath. Andrew Dargie, Michael Garcia, and
Russell Brown, running the 12(H), 400. 800,
and 1 MM) meter events, respectively.Three of

the members of the team (Heath, Garcia, and
Brown) were a part of the national champion
team in the DMR at the NCAA Indoor Track
Championships in 2007.
Brown and Garcia were unable to com
pete in the event this indoor season because
they did not have eligibility. This year's race
should prove exciting, as the Cardinal will be
competing against the current national
champion and World Record holding team,
the Texas Longhorns.
The women's DMR team consists of Ali

cia Follmar, Idara Otu, Madeline Duhon.and
Lauren Centrowitz. The women's team
placed third this year at NCAA Indoor
Championships; however, this time they will
be running without track standout Lambie,
who has no more eligibility for outdoors.
The Cardinal will return home next Sun
day, May 4, to host the Peyton Jordan Cardi
nal Invitational.
