## Playoff time for Cardinal Stanford rides winning streak into water polo quarterfinals 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's water
polo team puts its 11-game winning
streak on the line this weekend when
it heads to San Diego for the MPSF
conference tournament.
However, despite the team's great
form as of late, it is still facing a very
difficult challenge. In fact, if the Car
dinal makes it to the championship
game, it is likely that all three of its op
ponents will be ranked in the top six

NOTES; Thanlcs to an 11-1 record in league
play, Stanford has a bye into the second
round of the MPSF water polo champi
onships in San Diego this weekend. The
Cardinal will play the winner of the 7/10-
seed game, between Cal and Long Beach
State, in the quarterfinals this afternoon.
nationally, and if the tournament goes according to
seed, they will be playing a UCLA team that still has
yet to lose a match this season.
"There are 12 strong teams in our conference, in
cluding the top eight ranked teams in the country,"
Stanford head coach John Tanner said. "Every
game is of the highest caliber and exciting."
The good news for the Card is that because the
team finished second in the conference, it has a bye
into the second round. The bad news is that the
women will be facing a dangerous California team,
which advanced to the second round after beating
Long Beach State yesterday. Although the Bears
are the No. 7 seed in the tournament, Cal is ranked
No. 6 nationally and has proven to be more than ca
pable of upsetting the Card.
Stanford has played the Golden Bears twice this
year: the Card came out victorious in both contests.
That is where the similarities between the matches
end.
In the Stanford Invitational in February, the Cardi
nal handily beat the Bears by the score of 11-6.
However, when the two teams faced off in Big
Splash earlier this month, they produced a memo
rable nail-biter as Stanford came away with a hard
fought 6-5 victory after a back-and-forth game.

"They have plenty of goal-scoring talent and
play strong team defense, so they present serious
challenges to anyone playing them,"Tanner said.
If the Card can make it a hat trick of victories
against Cal this year, it will meet either third-seed
ed Southern California or sixth-seeded Arizona
State in the Pac-10 semifinals. Stanford has beaten
the Sun Devils fairly handily twice this season, but
their three matches with USC have been decided by
a combined three goals.
Stanford and USC played twice in February in
tournament play, with the Women of Troy pulling
out a 5-4 victory in the first match and the Cardinal
winning the second in overtime by the score of 7-6.
The teams met in conference play earlier this month
in Los Angeles, with Stanford once again emerging
victorious in overtime, this time by the score of 8-7
and on the strength of four goals from Kelly Eaton.
However, the Trojans are no shoo-ins for the
semis. USC and Arizona State split their two meet
ings this year, and the Sun Devils have been on fire
in the past month and a half. After losing to UC-
Irvine in quadruple overtime back on Mar. 8, ASU
has gone 10-1, with its only loss coming at UCLA.
With that kind of form, the Sun Devils could be a
tournament dark horse.

If Stanford can make it all the way to the title
game, odds are that it will end up facing top-seeded
UCLA. Fourth-seeded San Diego State and fifth
seeded Hawaii are also candidates, but UCLA dis
patched of both those teams fairly easily earlier this
season.
In fact, the Bruins have dominated almost every
team they have played this year â€” only USC and
Stanford have taken UCLA down to the wire. The
Card has played the Bruins twice this year, with
both games ending in heartbreak for Stanford.
The Cardinal lost to the Bruins in sudden-death
overtime in the championship game of the Irvine
tournament in February by the score of 8-7, and
then lost 9-7 in Los Angeles two weeks later. Stan
ford has certainly given UCLA all it could handle
this year, and there is no doubt that the Cardinal
could be the first team to blemish the Bruins' per
fect record. However, coach Tanner would rather
focus on his own team than on any possible oppo
nents.
"We [just] want to play at a high level through
out [the tournament) and be at our best on critical
possessions,"Tanner said.
