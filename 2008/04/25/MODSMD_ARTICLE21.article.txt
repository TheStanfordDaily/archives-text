Correction
In yesterday's article, "ProFros
flock to the Farm for Admit
Weekend." The Daily inaccurately
stated that Yale University no
longer has an early admission
process. In actuality, students can
apply early action to Yale.

In Monday's article,
"Coursework aids Syllabus site"
The Daily inaccurately stated there
are 130 syllabi available on the
Syllabus Web site. There are actual
ly over 1.200 syllabi due to the site's
integration with Coursework.
