## Sexy Stanford Stereotypes 
### MARISSA MILLER EMMA TROTTER FEATURES EDITORS 
Women's Community Center groupies:
These girls love to talk about their bodies, their
body confidence, how much they love their bod
ies, the inner-workings of their amazing bodies,
etc. Just pretend to care, and you can't lose.
LSJUMB: Passion runs wild and free at any
and all gatherings of these wacky musicians.
Double-tonguing? Check. Learning new finger

ings? All the time. Just make sure to use a neck
strap — safe sax is key.
ASSU senators: They don't do anything at
meetings, so they probably don't do anything in
the sack, either. And many of them are clearly
compensating for something.
Dorm staff: These enthusiastic upperclass
men are guaranteed to hook up with as many
freshmen as humanly possible.

IHUM kids: Their intensity and attention to
detail will leave you very satisfied post-coital.
But, afterwards, they'll probably want to over
analyze what went down.
Recycle-freaks: These chicks (and
dudes...but mostly chicks) are as earthy as it
gets. Unfortunately, that means several won
ders of modern technology are lost on them —
such as SUVs with roomy back seats... and ra
zors.

Pre-meds/Humßio majors: Always looking
to learn about anatomy. Go to one of their
many, many, many study groups if you're willing
to teach them a thing or two.
Daily staffers: Many of them don't believe in
ethics of any kind, which means pretty much
anything goes between the sheets.
Yale students: Will do anything to get atten
tion.
