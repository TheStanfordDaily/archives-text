Welcome, young ProFros, to the campus where — if I have anything to say about it —
you'll be spending the next four idyllic years of your life. In honor of this occasion, we bring
you the Annual Sex Issue of Intermission.
Why sex issue? Because you are guaranteed to have more sex in college than you were
having in high school. And you'll never have to hook up in your parents' living room again!
Coming to college means finally being free to party til eight in the morning, drink beer cream
floats and try to hook up with everything in flipflops (but I call dibs on Dave Barry when he
comes to campus on Monday.)
Sex is one of the great things about college. But it isn't the most important. Other things
you have to look forward to in college, especially if you come to Stanford:
You will not be weird anymore. Come on, we all got a little of this growing up — no
matter how well-adjusted you are, it can be hard being nerdily passionate about things that
aren't Top Interests on MySpace. But everyone here is weird, no matter how cool they are
on the surface. The guy you grinded up on at Kappa Sig's big kegger? He's finishing his first
novel. The girl in line behind you at Jamba Juice is an internationally recognized compos
er. The dude sunbathing in White Plaza is also thinking really deep thoughts about physics.
The deans in charge of admissions here are really good at what they do; everyone they
choose is special in some way. And you're special too. That's why you're here this week

end. That's why you belong here next year.
The campus. SUNBATHING in the FOUNTAINS. Yes, people actually do this. If you're
one of those pretentious types who thinks quality undergraduate education automatically
equals constantly drizzly weather, then invest in a tweed bikini. Or just get used to being
able to study outdoors in quiet nooks of the campus and attending classes held outside on
the grass.
The people. I don't know a single student here who spends all day locked up in the li
brary with no social life to speak of. But I also don't know a single student who isn't crazy
passionate about something. All the RAs I've ever had in dorms leave their doors open and
are free to talk to you, hear your concerns, recommend classes and events not to miss.
(Plus, none of that harsh RA alcohol-policing that goes down so much on the East Coast.)
Our big-ticket professors all actually teach classes (instead of letting their TAs take over) —
and, in my experience, they beg you to come to office hours. Imagine spending half an hour
discussing your favorite books with Tobias friggin' Wolff. Now come here and actually do it.
Admit Weekend can be weird and lame — honestly, I hated mine, because it was so fun
shine-and-group-huggy — but I encourage you to take some time to talk to students and
ask how they really feel about Stanford. It's a place that people get passionate about, and
for good reason. I hope you get a chance to find this out for yourself.
