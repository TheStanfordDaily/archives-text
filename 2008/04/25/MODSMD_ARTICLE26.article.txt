## How to do sex without even trying 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION WUNDERKIND 
I feel like people talk a lot about sex these days. "1 like to do
sex," people will say, and they mean it! Sometimes they'll even
ask if you would like to do sex ("Would you like to do sex?"), and
you'd better say yes, because hoo boy — sex is great! I should
know, because it seems like I'm pretty much always doing sex,
even when I don't mean to.
1 remember the first time I did what you would probably call
sex. I was just a kid and, tell you the truth, 1 didn't know what the
hell I was doing. Sure, I'd heard about sex and about doing it, be
cause it's all over the TV (sex is), but I didn't know the mechanics
of it or anything. Still, I knew that it was something important, so
I took my cap, headed out back and started practicing. Of course,
back then I hadn't heard about all the equipment 1 needed or any
thing. All I had was a catcher's mitt and the old tire swing my dad
had set up in the old apple tree. Like I said —just a kid! But 1 said
to myself, "I'm going to go ahead and do sex."
I'm not going to tell you that I got it right away. Not at all! No,
I was way, way off when I first started. I remember on my third try

I even spun out of control and slammed my head into my

house's vinyl siding. I guess I didn't think sex seemed so
great when my nose was bleeding! And, later on, the neigh
bor's dog started chasing me around and barking, which
really screwed up my concentration. They had a little
dachshund named Marco that was always crawling under

the fence and yapping at us kids.

If I remember right, I didn't
even get to first base that after-

noon, which was pretty frustrating. I

mean, all that work for nothing. But I
didn't give up, no sir. I headed inside for

a cookie and came back out with a new
sense of purpose. I was ready for action

— sex action. I sat myself down and said,

"Max: you're going to do some sex right now." And,
wouldn't you know? 1 did! 1 planted my feet and closed
my eyes and threw a rock at Marco, and I did sex! Start-

ing right at first base, 1 went all the way through the
numbers, in order.

These days, I'd probably say I do sex more than any
one else I know. 1 mean, it even gets hard to keep track

after a while. I'll just wake up, get out of

bed, trip over my cat, and suddenly

I'm doing sex — without even try
ing! I'll head out for a jog and do a

little sex on the way. I'll do a lit
tle sex while I'm waiting for the
elevator. It's an instinct at this
point, like tennis.

If you asked what my favorite sex
was, I'd have to point to the Santa Cruz

boardwalk, June 2002, right in front of that
Giant Dipper rollercoaster. I'd been getting
a lot of practice at that point, so my reflexes

were pretty good, but the best part was
that I had a cheeseburger in each hand.
Two cheeseburgers! That was both deli
cious and sexy.

I don't want to make you feel bad if
you're doing less sex than me (although you

are), because that's not the issue here. I'd say it's

about the quality of the sex, not the amount. If you're only doing
it 50 times a day, that's nothing to feel bad about. Once you get
A; it in your muscle memory, your numbers will ramp up.

My most important piecc of advice would be to prac
tice. Don't be embarrassed about touching up your
| technique in public — everyone does it. If we didn't
do sex, we probably wouldn't have some of our great
est cultural achievements. Hockey, for instance.
Where do you think hockey comes from? Or the

lampshade?

If you still don't believe me, I just have one last
thing for you. Look around you. Maybe you see
somebody just sitting there. Wait — look at him

closely. Guess what? He might be doing sex

right now! In fact, he almost definitely is. I
k would be.
