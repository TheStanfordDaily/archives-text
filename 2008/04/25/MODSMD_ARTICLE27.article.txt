### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION DO-IT-YOURSELFER 
Prospective Freshmen of the Stanford
Class of 2012, welcome to Admit Weekend!
By the time you get around to reading this ar
ticle, you'll probably already have done most
of the things on the "List of Things to Do at
Admit Weekend" your mom made you write.
You've already taken a picture of yourself pos
ing in front of Memorial Church, you've al
ready tested your Trajectory-Specific Theory
of Gravitation by throwing newborn puppies
off of Hoover Tower; you've even already
managed to eat at all of Stanford's different
on-campus restaurants! 1 know, you thought
that one would be harder, didn't you...
Anyway, the official, mom-approved list is
nearly complete, and it's time to turn your at
tention to your Secret List — the list of the
things you want to do at Stanford that you
couldn't quite tell your parents about. Though
there are many items that can be included in a
Secret List — get wasted using only an ice luge
and a beer bong, pogo stick through the steam
tunnels, etc. — there is one item alone that can
claim top billing on nearly all Secret Lists:
hook up with a Stanford student.
Now, getting some from a sexy Stanford co
ed might seem easy for you. Mr. Quarterback-
Who-Led-His-Team-To-St a tes-While-
Founding-An-NGO-To-Rebui Id-New-Or
leans or Ms. Won-a-Pulitzer-Prize-For-Her-
Groundbreaking-Expose-of-Upper-Mon
tana-Elk-Fighting-Rings, but, 1 assure you, it's
not. Stanford students approach sex like we
approach our homework: we talk about it all
week but don't actually do it until the last mo
ment, and even then we rush it off so we can be
done by the time "LOST" comes on. It's a tight
schedule, and there's not a lot of room to pen
cil in "allow a possibly underage Pro Fro to
frantically paw at my body."
But don't fear, Pro Fro, you'll get your

Get you some,
Pro Fro

booty. Just follow my simple Five-Step Guide,
and the proverbial legs of Stanford will open to
you like Madame Bovary's to L6on and
Rodolphe. Except with less arsenic.
Step 1: Lose the Name Tag, Poindexter
The trick to successfully seducing a Stan
ford undergrad is making them believe you're
not a Pro Fro. Sorry guys, but nobody wants to
sleep with a Pro Fro. To that end, get rid of all
adornments that may indicate your high
school status. Remove the Stanford Universi
ty lanyard from around your neck, cover up
that acne — you may even want to go ahead
and rip those braces off. Don't worry, the ex
cruciating pain and knowledge that you'll just
have to get the braces put back on again later
will definitely be worth it. Probably. Maybe. 1
don't really know.
Step 2: Fake it "til You Make It
Unfortunately, it's not enough just to look
like you're not in high school; you have to
prove to everyone that you're a Genuine Stan
ford Cardinal(tm). So brush up on how much
you hate your IHUM (first, learn what IHUM
is), be prepared to quote your SUID number
at the blink of an eye and, for God's sake, get
rid of the Campus Map. You're a Stanford stu
dent now, and a Stanford student is nothing if
not confident. So, even if you're hopelessly lost
somewhere around the Engineering Quad,
keep your head high and walk with a purpose.
Just watch out for those bollards.
Step 3: Find the Right Fragrance
To attract the opposite sex, the right scent is
paramount. Your aroma must be subtle but al
luring, elusive and, most of all, stimulating. But
put away the Axe Body Spray or the Victoria's
Secret eau de toilette, Pro Fro, because there's
only one perfume that is irresistible to all Stan
ford students: In-n-Out Burger. Just grab a

Double-Double and rub it on your special
parts, and you'll have to beat them off with a
stick. For the more daring among you, try An
imal Style.
Step 4: Aim Low
Read your Secret List again. What does it
say? Right, "Hook up with a Stanford stu
dent." Does it say anywhere that it has to be a
super-hot Stanford student? Didn't think so.
So don't shoot for the stars, and be prepared to
settle for anything that seems like a sure bet.
Remember: your goal is to lose your V-Card,
not to be the first to tame one of the Lopez
twins.

Step 5: If All Else
Fails, Ask Your
HoHo
After all, isn't it
their job to see that
Admit Weekend is
a seminal experi
ence for each and
every Pro Fro?
