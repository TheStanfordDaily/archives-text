## College is for SEX! plus learning sometimes. 
### FOXY SASS INTERMISSION PROFRO 
OH-TWELVE! ONE-TWO!
Foxy's only been at Stanford for one
night of Admit Weekend, and she's
already confused. Fortunately, she is
not confused about all the glorious
times that await her on the Farm next

fall when she joins big sis Roxy
i as the second Sass in the Cardi-

nal family. Everyone knows
I that college and sex go togeth
er like peanut butter and jelly
—just as sticky, and just as de
licious! Of course, Foxy does
n't exactly know yet, being a
humble Pro Fro and all. But,

hey, it's only Friday, right? And

1 after that, four glorious years of hav
ing more wonderful choices than the
salad bar in Wilbur. Wilbur has a
salad bar, right? Whatever.
Foxy can hardly contain her excite
ment. The greatest promise that Stan
ford has to offer is that brains are no
longer an obstacle to having a little
fun with that hottie you see in class. In
high school, the sad truth is that most
of your peers are too scared by what
you've got upstairs to check out
what's downstairs — unless, of
course, you go to a high school that
shares a football field with Cal Tech
or something. The mind may be the
most powerful sex organ, but that
memo has yet to reach most 14-18
year olds. In college, everyone is older
and wiser — AND the admissions of
fice has thoughtfully brought all of the

sexy smart people into one fabu-

lous place! When you check
| someone out across the Quad,
you know that not only do they
look that good, they can probably
write you a ballad, build you a
rocket or teach you how to hack
your sister's email account unde-

tectcd. It's so much hotter, brainy
style.

The atmos
phere of college
life doesn't

hurt, either.
No more par
ents means
no more
being re
stricted to
messing
around in the

back seat of cars, which is limit
ing and can result in awkward
confrontations with parking lot
security officers. Ahem, sorry
about that, sir. Yeah dorm
rooms! In college, you don't
have to wake up for 7:30 a.m.
classes — and you don't have to
wake up before noon, either, be
cause no one takes attendance!
All of this leaves much more
time for late-night entertain
ment. And Foxy's not talking
about those smoothies at Stern
that she's heard so much about.
Campus life seems oriented
toward inducing lust. Instead of
gym class, in which everyone is
forced to change into stinky uni
forms mid-day to play some un-

heard-of game like "Jolly Ball,"
there's a real gym full of people sexily
intent on improving their fine bodies.
Studying in swimsuits while lying on
the grass by the library is de rigeur. In
class, fiery-hot intellectual arguments
break out between ideological foes
that leads to late-night coffees over
group projects. Rrrrrrrrowr.

Of course, there are some poten
tial downsides to sex in college, things
that Foxy will have plenty of time to
worry about as she sits through the
meaninglessness of class in high
school after the AP tests are over. For
example, the fact that dorm rooms,
despite all their promise for youthful
romps, are not ventilated, and Foxy
has smelled what Roxy's room smells
like in the morning. Phew. For the
cost of housing, can't a girl get some
AC?

Another

potential downside is

that when sex is all

around you, it can be easy to

get lazy about it. Foxy hopes that

even if she no longer has to get cre
ative about inventing curfew violation
excuses, she'll still keep those creative
juices flowing. The biggest no-no is
falling into the boring booze-it-up and
get-it-on pattern. A girl wants to have
a time she'd like to remember in the
morning. And if she does, a girl would
like to remember it!
On a serious note, life in college
means acting a little more grown-up,
meaning more than just doing your

own
laundry. Sex in col
lege can come with conse
quences that sound far away when
you're sitting in health class but be
come real and scary when you see
them close up. Foxy hopes that all her
fellow ProFros — and future Stan
fordmates — are savvy about acting
like responsible non-idiots.

Apart from the nagging little con
cerns, though. Foxy couldn't be more
jazzed about her collegiate life to
come. Student athletes, TAs, floor
mates, in the library, in the steam tun
nels, under the Dish — Foxy is getting
all revved up already. See you in the
fall — and, until then, Foxy's got
some Admit Weekend parties to
scour for future "friends."
