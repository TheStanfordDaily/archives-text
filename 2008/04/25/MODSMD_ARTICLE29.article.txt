# WORD SCORE

### AUSTIN ZUMBRO INTERMISSION SEXOLOGIST 
This might-seem like an easy question to answer. "Sex" is a word. Duh. In fact, it is a particularly good word to
play on a triple-letter score in Scrabble. If done properly, "sex" will not only get you 32 points but also a few good
natured chuckles around the table. "Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about!" Hi-five. An even better word is "lax
ative." It gets you a 50-point bonus and is a far funnier word than "sex." This is because laxatives make people
poop a lot. High five! But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
"Sex" is more than just a word. Much like "pencil" or "America,"it is a word that means something. And the
meaning of that word "sex" is what this article is all about. But this is where we run into some problems. Sex is not
as easy to define as other words. "Pencil" means "an instrument for writing or drawing, consisting of a thin piece
of graphite or some similar material." Likewise. "America" means "freedom." "Sex," on the other hand, means
a lot of different things to a lot of different people. How can a person keep it all straight? Or gay. Or bisexual. Or,
you know, whatever.
It is that "whatever" that causes trouble. When I hear about a thing, I want to know what it means and how I
am supposed to feel about it. That is why I like infomercials so much, because they tell me all about how a certain
kind of detergent removes even the toughest stains, and I know that this should excite me to the point that I yell
very obnoxiously. Now, Dear Reader, I know that you feel the same way, just like I know you wish there was a
way to clean the grout in your shower. You think, "Why does sex have to be so complicated? I wish someone
would just break it all down for me."
Well fear not, for I am the person you have waited for, the one who will break down "sex." There also does
exist a way to clean the grout in your shower, but if you want to hear about that, you should turn your TV on
around 1:30 PM on a Tuesday. But for now, buckle your seatbelts, kids, because we're diving head first into an ex
travaganza of learning fun!
First of all, sex is biological. For all animals that have sex, the sex is somehow related to science. This is an ex
tremely boring part of sex, but according to many sources, it is also a very important one. All that you should take
away from this point is that at its most basic level, sex is a kind of mathematical calculation that may come up on
a midterm. High five!
Second, sex is supposed to be fun. The amount of fun here is ambiguous, but there is definitely supposed to be
some sort of enjoyment involved. Sometimes it is so much fun that the neighbors might think you are filming your
own infomercial, but other times it is only about as fun as watching paint dry. If you don't know the adage or have
never tried it yourself, watching paint dry isn't actually all that fun. It's a lot of sitting around and then sticking
your finger in to see if it's still wet. But at least it's interactive.

But sex can certainly come with different levels of interaction. Sometimes it takes place between two g
people, and each person rubs a part or parts of him or herself against another part or parts of the other
person. Sometimes this happens between more than two people, but the number of parts being rubbed \
gets a little extreme. Sometimes the people don't even touch each other, opting instead to touch themselves. Some- V *
times, people dress up in costumes and pretend to be office workers or medical workers or giant forest creatures.
Sometimes one of the people just "likes to watch." This might seem like a non-interactive form of sex, but 1 imagine
that it is actually a lot like TiVo. At times you're "just watching," but you can also pause and rewind, which gives you time to make a
snack.
Sex also involves some kind of sensation. Mr. Science would tell us all about how our sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous sys
tems interact to create a feeling of arousal, but Mr. Science is probably not getting any. Instead, allow me to summarize. Have you ever
felt something? I mean, have you ever felt any kind of emotional or physical sensation at all? Examples of this include delight, fear, con
trol, lack of control or intense patriotism. You may have felt the sensation of peeing, of choking, of being stabbed or beaten, of being
dizzy or upside down, of hot or cold, sweet or sour. All of these things are associated with sex in someone's mind, although probably
not all at once.
This evidence would suggest that sex has a similar definition to the word "everything," but we can place some limits on it. Sex is bi
ological, it is supposed to be fun, it is generally interactive, and it involves sensation. Basically what we have just described is any action
ranging from making your bed to committing mass genocide. These limits suck.
So let's cut the loosey-goosey stuff and head straight into the dirty-wirty. Up until this point, I have tried to be as inclusive as possi
ble in our definition, but sometimes it's necessary for the sake of efficiency to exclude and to follow archetypes. Namely, sometimes
you have to be a dick (or a vagina). It is well known that all of the biggest dicks (and vaginas) are found in the media, so let's turn our
attention there.
According to the media, sex is the act of a man wanting to put his penis inside of a woman. Where he actually puts his penis, as far
as the female anatomy is concerned, is of no consequence, as most men are probably unclear as to what sorts of options are available.
The media has assessed that man's desire for this penile insertion is so strong that they will spend a lot of money in order to get it. The
media is unsure what women want, although they are pretty sure that it is somewhere between "a long conversation" and a product that
"removes even the toughest stains!" Unfortunately, there is no way to market the first one. In previous decades, this problem was solved
by the fact that women had no money, but in the modern age this is not the case. The new approach is to present women with pictures
of stoic, hairless men who are probably great listeners. This ad campaign has also been used to attract what the media believes to be
hordes of big-spending gay males. Lesbians are of no concern to the media, as they apparently have no money or are obnoxiously thrifty.
It is this media definition of sex that is most important to you as a prospective or current college student. The adage "sex sells" is put
into practice on college campuses worldwide, the assumption being that we, as young adults, are really into sex. For some of you, this
may be true. Perhaps you will go see that movie about an unfortunate road trip simply because a girl takes a shower two-thirds of the
way through. Perhaps you will applaud and cheer when someone on a stage says something like, "I want to have sex," because you feel
this really speaks to your inner self.
Whatever your sexual preference or orientation, whether you see sexuality as a spectrum or as distinct categories, or whether you
get your rocks (or vaginas) off by rubbing, slapping, or smearing yourself with jam, sex should be whatever you want it to be. Just like
America. AKA Freedom.
