## USC IN TOWN TO FACE STREAKING CARDINAL 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
In addition to this weekend's
Pro Fro events, the No. 5 Stanford
baseball team will host Southern Cal
ifornia to show the incoming fresh
men a classic Cardinal vs. Trojans bat
tle. The Trojans' record just fell below
.500 to 19-20 (6-6 Pac-10) on Wednes
day when they lost to San Diego State
after a double in the ninth inning
broke a 2-2 tie for an Aztec victory.
Stanford experienced the exact op
posite predicament on Wednesday
when it defeated St. Mary's 7-4, thanks
to an eighth inning three-RBI double
from junior Brent Milleville.
Milleville's clutch hit sealed the Car
dinal victory and upped Stanford's
record to 23-12-2 (8-4 Pac-10).
The Cardinal has won eight of its
last nine games and remains atop the
Pacific-10 Conference standings over
Arizona State and California, who are
at a dead heat in second. USC is cur
rently in a three-way tie for third with
Arizona and Oregon State.
The tight nature of the current Pac
-10 race shows how crucial this week
end's match will be for the Cardinal.
Though Stanford may be neck and
neck with other top teams, the Cardi

games that it can handle its oppo

NOTES. No. 5 Stanford plays three games
against USC this weekend as the Cardinal
tries to stay on top of the Rac-10 at the mid
point of the conference season. Stanford has
won eight of its last nine games and holds a
one-game lead over Arizona State thanks to
some clutch hitting and consistent, solid pitch
ing from Erik Davis and Drew Storen.

er who is panning out to be Stanford's
clutch player in the final innings is jun
ior first baseman Brent Milleville. He
has four RBIs in the last two games
and has sealed victories nabbing the
winning hits against San Francisco,
Santa Clara and St. Mary's over the
past two weeks.
Another notable player to look out
for offensively is junior catcher Jason

Castro. Castro is hitting .347 after
starting in each game this season. He
was 3-for-3 on Wednesday against
the Gaels, scoring after each of the
three hits. Castro has 30 RBIs and
seven homeruns on the season, just
behind junior Sean Ratliff who has
11.
The Cardinal is also developing a
deep pitching staff, which should
prove to be helpful in the postsea
son. Freshman pitcher Alex Pracher
is only 1 -1 on the season but was one
of the main reasons that Stanford
was able to put away the Gaels. After
relieving junior Max Fearnow,
Pracher was able to pitch five score
less innings, only allowing three hits
with five strikeouts.
Another key pitcher is senior
right-hander Erik Davis. Davis is 6-1
on the season with a .383 ERA in
56.1 innings pitched. Davis has been

on fire of late, throwing an astound
ing four straight complete games.
The Cardinal has also relied heavily
on the closing efforts of Drew
Storen, who has picked up four saves
this season with a 2.76 ERA, the best
on the team.
The Trojans will have a few tricks
up their sleeves for this weekends
series, however. Junior pitcher
Tommy Milone has not allowed a
homerun in 57.1 innings.
Offensively, shortstop Grant Green
will look to continue a 13-game hit
ting streak this weekend. He is bat
ting .554 (31-56) with five homers
and 14 RBls.
With only one month left until
the NCAA Regional Games, the
Cardinal needs every win it can get
in order to ensure a spot in the Super
Regionals. Having won eight of its
last nine, a strong showing against
Southern Cal will almost assuredly
have Stanford on the right track for
the looming postseason.
