In addition to this weekend's
Pro Fro events, the No. 5 Stanford
baseball team will host Southern Cal
ifornia to show the incoming fresh

.500 to 19-20 (6-6 Pac-10) on Wednes
day when they lost to San Diego State
after a double in the ninth inning
broke a 2-2 tie for an Aztec victory.
Stanford experienced the exact op
posite predicament on Wednesday
when it defeated St. Mary's 7-4, thanks
to an eighth inning three-RBI double
from junior Brent Milleville.
Milleville's clutch hit sealed the Car
dinal victory and upped Stanford's
record to 23-12-2 (8-4 Pac-10).
The Cardinal has won eight of its
last nine games and remains atop the
Pacific-10 Conference standings over
Arizona State and California, who are
at a dead heat in second. USC is cur

Arizona and Oregon State.
The tight nature of the current Pac

against USC this weekend as the Cardinal
tries to stay on top of the Rac-10 at the mid
point of the conference season. Stanford has
won eight of its last nine games and holds a
one-game lead over Arizona State thanks to
some clutch hitting and consistent, solid pitch
ing from Erik Davis and Drew Storen.

er who is panning out to be Stanford's
clutch player in the final innings is jun
ior first baseman Brent Milleville. He
has four RBIs in the last two games
and has sealed victories nabbing the
winning hits against San Francisco,
Santa Clara and St. Mary's over the
past two weeks.
Another notable player to look out
for offensively is junior catcher Jason
