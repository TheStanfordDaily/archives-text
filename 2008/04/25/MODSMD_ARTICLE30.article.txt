## Clash of the Colleges 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION PRINCETON REVIEWER 
Dear Admits and Proud Parents,
It's one of the toughest decisions you'll ever have to make —
which college is right for you? Luckily, Stanford is here to make
your mind up for you, March Madness-style. This is Bracketol
ogy, and whatever college wins this hypothetical tournament is
where you are going next year. Note that I am totally biased and
completely arbitrary. But I'm also infallible. Let's go.
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Harvard vs. 16. Washington University in St. Louis
Does Wash. U. actually exist? I've never heard of anyone
going there for real. I have a theory that it only exists in your
dreams, like Hogwarts or The University of Phoenix Online. Ul
timately, it gets eviscerated by Harvard on the basis of name
recognition alone. People in like Somalia and Chad have heard of
Harvard.
EDGE: Harvard.
8. MIT vs. 9. CalTech
Geek-Off! MIT used its collective brainpower to win millions
of dollars (and several chicken dinners) from Vegas, while Cal-
Tech is so smart that it lost 207 straight basketball games. In the
end, it comes down to weather. While neither student body ever
goes outside, at least CalTech has something nice to not bask in.
EDGE: Caltech.
5. Penn vs. 12. Duke
Penn was founded by Benjamin Franklin, and its awesome
alums include Warren Buffett, Donald Trump and William "Prez
for a month!" Henry Harrison. But at Duke, you can take a lead
ership class with the legendary Coach K (hopefully, trust falls are
involved), and sometimes he even buys the student body pizza!
EDGE: Duke
4. Yale vs. 13. Georgetown
Georgetown may have political prestige and a prime location,
but Yale has Skull & Bones, the fabled secret society that owns a
mystery island, houses the actual skulls of Geronimo and Martin
Van Buren and forces all initiates to confess their sexual histories

while doing unspeakable things to themselves in a pit. Former
members include John Kerry and both President Bushes. You
put the disgusting pieces together.
EDGE: Yale
3. Princeton vs. 14. Weslilliamherstomona
I combined some of the nation's top liberal arts schools into
one entity for those of you with ambitions of studying Shake
spearean philosophical art history on an Indian burial ground in
the middle of nowhere. However, if you'd rather form eating
clubs in which popped collars, croquet and fondue are all the rage,
Princeton's your place.
EDGE: Princeton.
6. Columbia vs. 11. Brown
Quick question, admits: would you rather go to college in
Harlem...or Rhode Island? Probable death... or certain irrele
vance? I've got to penalize Brown for not having pluses, minuses
or D's in its grading. That's not how the world works. In the world,
there are pluses, minuses and D's.
EDGE: Columbia.
7. UC Berkeley vs. 10. UCLA
North vs. South. East Bay vs. Westwood. Bears vs. Bruins.
And, on a personal note, girlfriend vs. sister. This one's so tight, I
have to (and I told myself I would never do this) go to US News
& World Report for the tiebreak. Survey says...Cal!
EDGE: Cal.
2. Stanford vs. 15. U$C
Not even close. Stanford completely mops the floor with U$C
in the following categories: academics, athletics, career opportu
nities, campus traditions, not being in Compton and overall cool
ness. Oh well, at least UsC's got football...right? Wait, what's
that? 24-23? 41-point underdogs? Well done, Harbaugh.
EDGE: Stanford.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Harvard vs. 9. CalTech
CalTech is so smart. Maybe too smart. At least Harvard's
churned out people like Bill O'Reilly, Eliot Spitzer and Jim "Mad
Money!" Cramer who make you feel good by comparison.
EDGE: Harvard.

12. Duke vs. 4. Yale
If it wanted to, Skull & Bones could buy Duke, rename it
Southern Yale, and do horrible experiments on the students or
something. Terrifying, but true.
EDGE: Yale.
3. Princeton vs. 6. Columbia
New York »> Jersey.
EDGE: Columbia.
7. Cal vs. 2. Stanford
Yes, Berkeley is a cooler city than Palo Alto. Yes, Mike Mont
gomery left us for them. Yes, their tower is taller and more phal
lic. And yes, I know, their football team owns our Band. But Cal
over Stanford? Really? Not gonna happen.
EDGE: Stanford.
FINAL FOUR
1. Harvard vs. 4. Yale
Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29!
EDGE: Harvard.
6. Columbia vs. 2. Stanford
Rider Strong (Sean from "Boy Meets World") went to Colum
bia. Ben Savage (Cory Matthews) went here. Tiebreak? Fred
Savage (of "The Wonder Years" fame and also that one "Boy
Meets World" episode where he tried to feel up Topanga) went
here too. These things are important to me.
EDGE: Stanford.
CHAMPIONSHIP
1. Harvard vs. 2. Stanford
Harvard is a really solid place to get an education. You'd make
good connections, see the seasons change and all that crap. But
here's what Stanford brings: Community. Warmth. Superior ath
letics. Lots and lots of bikes. Übiquitous Asian dance teams. The
Game. The Big Game. The seemingly infinite diverse and fasci
nating people. And much, much more. It's one of those "you have
to be here" things.
CHAMP: Stanford.
MVP: Leland Jr.
