## Three Seasons: Something's missing, all right 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION SEASONED DINER 
In a classic "Seinfeld" episode,
Frank Constanza once noticed, "You
got the hen, the chicken and the roost
er. The rooster goes with the chicken.
So, who's having sex with the hen?"
Despite the best efforts of all sane in
dividuals to change the topic, he con
tinues, "But you see my point here?
You only hear of a hen, a rooster and
a chicken. Something's missing!" To
this, Mr. Ross can only respond,
"Something's missing, all right."
Eating at the Three Seasons
restaurant on Bryant Street might
lead to a similar line of thought.
Everyone has heard of the Four Sea
sons either as a brand of fine hotels
and restaurants or as the sum of sum
mer, autumn, winter and spring. Thus,
upon simply reading the name "Three
Seasons," it would not be unreason
able to comment that something's
missing. Unfortunately, by the end of
the meal, it may become evident that
something is most certainly missing,
and it is more than just the fourth sea
son.
A plus of the Three Seasons is the
atmosphere. The restaurant features
a choice of tables in the bar area or
more standard tables fit for a full
meal, all in a chic but casual environ

ment. In nice weather, the restaurant
also has comfortable outdoor seating
on the small open plaza between
Bryant and Ramona streets, which
manages to capture the outdoors
while avoiding traffic. The menu is
also highly appealing. Officially, the
cuisine is contemporary Vietnamese,
but it is easy to see influences from
Thailand, Korea and Japan, among
other places. There is also a cocktail
menu that is heavy on the tropically
themed flavors.
But after sitting down and looking
at the menu, things begin to go down
hill. The service can only be described
as weak at best. The waiter never
came by to introduce himself or take a
drink order and only took the food
order after an excessive wait. The first
appetizer took a long time to come,
but still arrived before our cocktails,
which were quite good — neither too
strong nor too sweet. The second ap
petizer arrived a solid five minutes
after the first.
The pork ribs appetizer (officially
a "small plate") looked amazing at
first. However, their flavor had a little
too much of a tang, perhaps from the
overuse of tamarind seasoning. Fur
thermore, the tough meat was so diffi
cult to cut off the bone that eating it in
the context of my work for The Daily
might constitute some type of OSHA
violation. Our other appetizer, called

happy buns — consisting of Peking
duck on a steamed bun — was better.
The duck was nice and crispy, the bun
wasn't overly gummy and the hoisin
sauce had a bit of a spicy kick added to
it. The only flaw was that the duck was
probably slightly drier than would
have been ideal.
The highlight of the meal was
probably the mango beef entree,
which included generous amounts of
tasty beef with no shortage of mango
and wok-tossed veggies, which was
not overly rich and was difficult to
stop eating. Our other main, the yel
low curry chicken, was certainly pass
able, and consisted of a smooth, mild
curry with yams and potatoes. The
potato flavor in the sauce might have
been stronger than I would have
liked, but that is a matter of personal
preference. Ultimately, however, it
seemed no better than the curry
served at numerous nearby Thai
restaurants for about half the price.
While there certainly are some
positive qualities of the Three Sea
sons, the service and some of the food
left quite a bit to be desired, especial
ly for the prices that they charge. With
tax and tip, a meal for two broke $ 100.
Granted, that included a lot of food,
as well as drinks, but when consider
ing the overall experience compared
to the price, something was definitely
missing.
