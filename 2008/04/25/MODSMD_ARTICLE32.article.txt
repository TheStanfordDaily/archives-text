### WEIQI SAMANTHA TOH INTERMISSION ANNE SEXTON 
Sex. Sex, sex, sex. With the unfold
ing of time, humanity's lexicon of sex
words has expanded drastically, leav
ing us with far too many ways to de
scribe this rather ordinary phenome
non. The range spreads its legs to en
compass some well-used terms, from
"making love" and "putting out" to
the slightly more enthusiastic "getting
it on." Yet our choices of diction have
become increasingly flaccid in their
overuse, suggesting the need for a re
vival — or, at the very least, some cre
ative substitutions.
If there is anything Stanford
sophomore Anna H.R. Khan's sec
ond collection of poems does, it is just
that. "Resurrection of the Muse" de
votes several poems to describing the
sex act, be they part of metaphors or
reality. From "vibrations...lingering]
in the wood" and "infallible thrusts"

to "slimy and saturated...scales,"
these descriptions are never short of
interesting. "The Piano," for exam
ple, provides an interesting take on
making music: "[The piano] shud
dered in awe / Yet she arched her
back immune to what she had made
him feel," giving us a whole new inter
pretation of "playing an instrument,"
if you know what I mean.
If these examples are any indica
tion, Khan uses extremely strong lan
guage to induce emotions. She paints
images that are vivid and do their job
well, sometimes pushing us beyond
our thresholds of comfort. In fact, I
emerged from her second poem, "In
trude." with a rather distorted thizzle
face; reading about the "vigilant [and]
caliginous" man with the "sucked
lover" was perhaps a little too strong
for my ever-wimpy self.
Thankfully, "Resurrection of the
Muse" provides more than just super

creative descriptions of sex. The col
lection of poetry ranges in theme,
from troubling subjects such as death
("I'm Having Trouble Breathing") to
historical poetry ("Burn"). As the
matically mature as these poems ap
pear to be, however, it is clear that
their author was only 17 when she
penned down these thoughts — a
characteristic that isn't always a bad
thing. The voice on every page sings
with a certain innocence, providing
her poems with a quality that allows
us to forgive the occasional awkward
structure, clumsy phrasing or, God
forbid, pop-lyric-esque whine of a
rhetorical question. Instead, her tone
draws our attention to the precious
nuggets of imagery and the contradic
tory, lush simplicity that provide the
poems with an impressive shape and
form.
Before we plunge into my favorite
parts of the collection, I do have to
clarify that "Resurrection" hit several

of my pet peeve buttons. There was a
bemusing plethora of commas in
some sections that were unnecessary.
(In "Theft," for example. Khan
writes, "You, have disappeared...[left
me] stripped, like the barren, ground
beneath me."...what?) Overused also
are the line breaks isolating a word or
two at the end of the poem, presum
ably for a dramatic effect ("We be
come one / Again." ["Sub-heaven"]).
Overall, however, there was
enough done to prevent a negative
impression, verging quite substantial
ly on memorable. One of my favorites
is Khan's haiku, "Flashes of Tsunami
Air on CCN." Though not adhering
to the traditional 17-syllable struc
ture, the haiku still packs a good
punch: "The mouth sucks for air. /
Scales slide, fins beat, rush of water /
Three seconds, bait on God's fishing
line."
The sound of the words, the se

quence of flashing images, the linger
ing poetic flavor all steal us away for a
moment, causing us to be momentar
ily satiated. Yet, as full as each explo
sive image leaves us, my favorite line
from the entire collection is actually a
line of understatement. "But every
tear from their eyes," Khan writes in
"Burn," "would send a puff of dust / in
the quiet air."
Quite wonderful, don't you think?
It is for these very precious moments
that I enjoyed "Resurrection of the
Muse." Although not orgasm-worthy
in perfection—l7-year-old poetry
geniuses are, after all, few and far be
tween — Khan's second collection
does hold potential, indicating that
more exciting words are to follow.
And perhaps this time, these
words will be words that will "linger,"
even longer, in my "wood."
