## Tiny Nibbles worth a ride 
### AISHA WELLS INTERMISSION EROTICA EDUCATOR 
1 used to think that Admit Week
end was nothing more than the per
fect chance for Stanford students to
aid ProFros with their college deci
sion process. I thought we would try
to sway them with our amazing
amenities, world-class education, chill
attitudes and endless intellectual op
portunities. What 1 did not expect was
for our personal perspectives on the
campus's best sex hideouts and porno
reviews to be included in all that.
Yes, it's stimulating, but not in the
way ProFros were encouraged to
write about on their applications. Yet
Stanford or no Stanford, we're still
college students, which means that
sex, alcohol and sex are always the
subjects of our thoughts. And, seri
ously, what ProFros are studious,
young "leaders-of-tomorrow" in their
very last semester of high school?
Please. If the average teen thinks

about sex every couple of seconds
when they're working and busy with
school, then I'm more than positive
— wait, sorry, a naked dude was flash
ing his (very) goods across my com
puter screen (whoa). Anyway, in
honor of everyone's obsession with
sex, and our übiquitous reliance on
the Internet for it, I believe it's about
time we found some quality sex sites.
At the moment, you're probably
thinking of kitschy places like bang
bus.com, teentiger.com,
pornohub.com or
teenanalqueens.com, where they
charge you $9.95 for glossy, overpro
duced videos in which a flat-chested
(or buxom, depending on what you
like) teenaged-looking 20-year-old
emits the most annoying whine, while
some creep screws and slaps her ass
every five minutes. Then, just as all
squelching and animalistic noises
reach their high point, she turns
around (because missionary style is so
old-fashioned) and gets a face full of
it. You know...it. No, I'm not talking

about those kinds of sites; that's porn.
I think it's about time, rather, that
people get introduced to erotica —
totally different stuff. While porn is
basically a chance for guys to see some
bimbo getting bombed in the face,
erotica Web sites are much more so
phisticated. There are blowjobs,
boobs, chains, whips — whatever, but
they are usually more concerned with
the interaction of two individuals dur
ing sex, and they stress mutual gratifi
cation, not just throwing a tit in your
face and having cream flying every
where. Erotica Web sites are more
thorough in their handling of sex.
They want you to be satisfied, safe
and skilled.
A prime example of this is a page
my quadmate found while perusing
an online guide to San Francisco.
Tinynibbles.com, created by sex-posi
tive author and blogger Violet Blue, is
a raunchy but constructive site with
plenty of tits and ass for those who
won't respond to anything else. Blue,
a regular sex columnist for the San
Francisco Chronicle, gives you every
thing you need: a guide to fellatio, a
guide to cunnilingus, how to do things
— with your ass — a guide to finding
good porn on the Internet without
crashing your computer (holler), sex
toys, how to find the g-spot(s). how to
have great phone sex, some girls in
chains, some girls in Sexy Librarian
outfits, hot tattooed gay guys, a com
plete guide to sex in San Francisco
and even some pertinent information
for victims of sexual abuse. With that

kind of coverage, I'm not sure if
there's anything that Blue misses. She
also has some links to good diners and
restaurants in the city for when all that
sexual exercise stirs your appetite.
I must say that after looking at
some other erotica sites (1 liked you,
clitical.com, I really did), 1 am pleas
antly surprised by Tiny Nibbles. Take
her reference to sexual healing, for ex
ample. It's extremely rare for so
called sex-positive enthusiasts (read:
people who feel the need to justify
their Olympian libidos) to even ad
dress the issue of sexual healing for
victims of abuse. Although Blue her
self hasn't directly coached those with
sexual trauma, 1 respect the fact that
she prominently provides links to in
formation about it on her site.
This, in conjunction with a pletho
ra of resources on safe sex and educa
tion, makes Tiny Nibbles an ideal

place for readers who want more lhan
just circle jerks and gag fests. After all,
and as some of you have had the dis
pleasure of finding out, sex isn't only
about the act itself. Afterwards, if
there's a big mess (of emotions and
awkward circumstances, of course),
then you have to clean it up. Don't
worry. Blue is looking out for you.
In short, she's got everything right
there waiting for you — waiting while
you finish watching high definition
Anal Teens 4. I suppose that, in the
meantime, while readers vigorously
make the shift from smut to smart,
she'll be updating the site with more
bondage pictures and ways to find the
right lube, so perhaps it is best to hold
off a bit and see what goodies she'll
have later. Remember, guys: you
don't want to take too long, but sure
ly don't cum — err, come — too
early.
