## WANTER HAROLD & KUMAR 
### MARK KOGAN INTERMISSION BLUNT REVIEWER BY THE FBI 
I am proud to say that I was one of the six people
who saw the original "Harold and Kumar Go to White
Castle" opening weekend in theaters. After walking
out of the theater those four long years ago, I was torn.
On the one hand, I had really loved the movie I had
just seen: it was fresh, original and hysterical. On the
other hand, I knew that it was going to last, at most, an
other six hours in theaters and promptly fade away
into obscurity.
Luckily, I was terribly, terribly wrong. The original
Harold and Kumar went on to become a smash hit
among the 17-35 demographic and prompted the an
nouncement of the inevitable sequel. Upon that fate
ful declaration, the worrying began. Was this going to
be just another schlock Hollywood sequel pumped
out into the bargain bin to cash in on the cult success
of the initial film? Were Harold (John Cho)

and Kumar's (Kal Penn) crazy antics going to be glossed into a formulaic
snoozefest in the hopes of making a quick buck?

If the four years of production weren't answer enough, let me go
ahead and put aside your fears — "Harold and Kumar 2: Escape
from Guantanamo Bay" is everything Harold and Kumar fans want
ed and more.

Set immediately after the conclusion of H&KI, "Escape" sees our
two perpetually toasted heroes making their way onto a plane to Ams-

terdam in order to find Harold's new love, Maria (Paula Garc6s).

Things turn south in a hurry for our intrepid heroes as they are
mistaken for terrorists and shipped off to Guantanamo Bay. De
spite the title, the actual military base has awfully little camera
time and the movie instead focuses on the minority duo's run
from the flag-waving law, personified by special agent Ron Fox
(Rob Corddry).

If I had to use one word to describe "Harold and Kumar 2,"
it would be "irreverent." This movie has a lot of balls, both
metaphorically and literally. Yes. at heart it's a comedy focused

on the college demographic with a disproportionate repre-

sentation of dick, weed and cooter jokes — but it hits

on some surprisingly deep and relevant questions. No
minority, religion, stereotype or currently sitting pres
ident is left untouched as our heroic duo romps

across the United States in an effort to clear the
names. The overall experience comes off as unex-

pectedly thoughtful and hilarious at the same time

The structure of "Harold and Kumar 2" is going
to seem terribly familiar — and, well, that's because
it is. Harold and Kumar jump from crazy situation to
crazy situation and encounter weird stereotype after
weird stereotype, only to constantly find themselves
in more trouble than before. The writers didn't ex
actly re-invent the wheel here, but it's not like they
needed to in the first place. It worked last time and
it works just as well this time.

The story is expanded somewhat by the introduc
tion of Vanessa (Daneel Harris), a love interest
from the past for Kumar. While the flashbacks offer
a cool little look back into Harold and Kumar's his-

Tory, including a fantastic glimpse of emo Harold, the character of Vanessa is poorly

fleshed out and feels thrown in just to stretch out the story an extra 20 minutes. The
movie does putter out a little bit at the end and the conclusion and epilogue are a bit
contrived and empty, but still full of some solid cheap laughs and necessary wrap
up.

"Harold and Kumar 2" delivers exactly what it promises: a carefree and disre
spectfully tongue-in-cheek comedy centered around a young core demographic.
Bursting at the seams with inappropriate jokes and politically incorrect rhetor-

ical humor, Harold and Kumar also manages to ask some fairly relevant

and insightful questions. "Harold and Kumar 2: Escape from Guan-

tanamo Bay" might not make you go home and contemplate the

purpose of your life and existence, but it sure as hell delivers on the
laughs in a polished and thoughtful way that makes it well worth

a watch.
