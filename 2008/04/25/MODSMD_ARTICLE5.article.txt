# Softball prepared for home finale
## Stanford seniors bid home field farewell on Sunday 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team will
finish off its home slate this weekend
against No. 21 Washington and No. 4
UCLA. Stanford will face Washington at
Smith Family Stadium this evening at 6
p.m. and will play UCLA once each on
Saturday and Sunday.
The Cardinal (41-8,6-Q Pacific-10 Con
ference) will be playing Washington (25-
16-1, 4-7 Pac-10) for the season series, as
the two teams split a pair of games in Seat
tle in the beginning of the month. UCLA
(38-5, 10-2 Pac-10), which is a half-game
behind Arizona State at the top of the con
ference standings, beat Stanford in their
lone meeting of the year.
Stanford comes into this round of
games having taken two of three games
from archrival California last weekend, fi
nally pushing the Cardinal back up to .500
in Pac-10 play. Junior pitcher Missy Penna
(29-7) earned Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week
honors for her performances, which in
cluded two straight one-run games to
close out the series.
Penna will take the mound again this
weekend as she looks for the kind of run
support she got on Hiesday, in a non-con
ference 7-3 win over San Jose State, in
stead of the zero the team put up in its last
game against Cal.
Sophomores Alissa Haber and Rosey
Neill are among the Pac-10 leaders in a

number of offensive categories. Haber is
fourth in the league in batting average
with a .395 mark, while Neill is close be
hind at .380, and Neill is tops in the confer
ence with 17 homeruns, two shy of Stan
ford's team record.
Penrta is also second in the Pac-10 in
strikeouts with 298 Ks.
Washington is a middle-of-the-road of
fensive team but it is not backed up by
pitching and defense the way that Stan
ford's offense is. The Huskies are second
to-last in the Pac-10 with a 2.23 team ERA
and have allowed 46 unearned runs, more
than one per game.
Still, the Huskies do have some formi
dable players. Jace Williams is third in the
Pac-10 in batting average, just ahead of
Haber at .397, and she chips in some
power to go with her average. Williams has
five homeruns and ten doubles on the sea
son.
The UCLA Bruins present a different
sort of challenge altogether. UCLA has
the best pitching staff in the conference,
with a suffocating 0.91 ERA. Only Ari
zona State's staff has more strikeouts
(465), but UCLA's pitchers whiffed 403
batters in 52 fewer innings than ASU.
Anjelica Selden (19-3) is the staff ace for
the Bruins, leading the Pac-10 with a 0.81
ERA. Donna Kerr is right behind her with
a 0.90 mark
UCLA packs plenty of punch on of
fense too, though. GiOnna DiSalvatore is
near the top of the league in batting, with
