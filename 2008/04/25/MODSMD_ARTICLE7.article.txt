## Campus enters dry weekend Admit Weekend policy prohibits alcohol consumption at organized student functions 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With Admit Weekend in full swing once
again, the taps have stopped flowing.
Under the Admit Weekend alcohol policy,
current students may not serve, provide or
make alcohol available to prospective fresh
men (ProFros). No alcohol may be present,
served or consumed at any organized student
group functions during Admit Weekend.
The official Admit Weekend policy was
enacted in 2001 under the leadership of Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya
in response to a serious alcohol poisoning
incident involving a Pro Fro. Since then, little
change has been made to the policy, though
the University has initiated more training for
House Hosts and increased collaboration
among University units involved in Admit
Weekend.
"Students of legal drinking age are still
allowed to drink," said Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe. "With pub night for

the seniors scheduled on the Thursday of
Admit Weekend, the group organizing the
event is responsible for running the event."
Drinking still occurs on campus as well,
though on a much more moderate and incon
spicuous scale.
"I think people observe the dry policy
more the first night," said Jeff Mendelman
*09. "There's less drinking on campus during
Admit Weekend, but the dry policy doesn't
stop it completely."
"Admit Weekend changes the drinking
atmosphere at Stanford." Mendelman added.
"Usually Stanford encourages an open door
drinking policy, but during Admit Weekend
drinking is behind closed door and really
hush-hush."
Several students observed that during the
dry Admit Weekend, many upperclassmen
dissatisfied with the dry campus policy take
the party off campus.
"I think there's a small culture of fleeing
during Admit Weekend because of the dry
policy," Mendelman said. "My friends and I

left campus last year during Admit
Weekend."
There is also debate regarding the legiti
macy of the dry policy in providing an accu
rate representation of the social scene at
Stanford.
"The dry policy has its good and bad
points," said Ed Cho '09. "It's definitely good
to have a dry policy because it severely
impairs ProFros' ability to get alcohol, but at
the same time it really excludes them from a
very significant social aspect of Stanford
University."
"The dry policy doesn't really show
ProFros what the alcohol environment is like
at Stanford, which should be considered dur
ing the college selection process," Cho added.
Both ProFros and current students who
break the dry policy face severe punishments.
"There are serious consequences for
ProFros who break the policy," said Health
Promotion Services Manager Ralph Castro in
an email to The Daily. "These students can be
sent home, or in verv serious cases their

admission can be revoked."
Students who violate the Admit Weekend
dry policy face the same administration
action process that is in place throughout the
year.
"These students will be required to meet
with their Residence Dean and required to
attend an alcohol education seminar or
assessment at Vaden," Castro said. "In more
serious and egregious cases, these students
will be referred directly to Judicial Affairs.
Also, students can be cited by the Police for
alcohol-related infractions and be required to
appear in Santa Clara County Court."
"If a group disregards the Admit Weekend
Alcohol Policy, then they will be referred to
the Organization Conduct Board where a
confidential investigation will be launched,"
Castro added. "These groups risk being
placed on alcohol probation or suspension or
in serious cases losing University recognition
and/or privileges."
