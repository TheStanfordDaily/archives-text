## Admits get first taste of college Different schools project different vibes during pre-frosh weekends 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
The tables have turned in the college admis
sion process as schools work to woo accepted
students through various on-campus events.
For some, Stanford is one of many suitors.
And according to several ProFros, each school's
admit weekend often has its own flavor that
shapes the way prospective students view the
host institution.
"Admit Weekend is pretty powerful, in my
opinion," said Roxanne Parker TO, host recruit
ment and publicity coordinator of this year's
Admit Weekend. "I know that 1 came to Admit
Weekend personally set against going to
Stanford, and it totally changed my mind."
Several students said Stanford's program was
laid back compared to those of other schools.
"These weekends are definitely a great idea,"
said Pro Fro Mohammad Abid. "1 am deciding
between Stanford and Princeton and I think
Princeton's pre-freshman program was pretty
uptight and business-like. Stanford's Admit
Weekend has been a lot more fun. It has just
been a better exposure to the school."
Pro Fro Lee Nguyen, who is deciding between
Stanford and Yale, had a similar experience at
Yale's pre-frosh program. Bulldog Days, which
was held earlier this week.
"Yale's program definitely had an air of
sophistication," Nguyen said. "It was more con
trolled and business-like with formal mingling
events. Stanford's Admit Weekend is looser and
crazier. [Stanford] is definitely my first choice —
it feels more like home to me."
Harvard's annual pre-frosh visiting program
will be held this weekend as well, forcing stu
dents like Joseph Seering, who were admitted to
both Stanford and Harvard, to decide to attend
only one of the two pre-frosh programs.
"I really would have wanted to attend both
schools' programs," Steering said. "I ended up
deciding to attend Stanford's program based on
distance since I'm from Cambridge.These week
ends are helpful because they give me a chance
to meet people and give me a feel of what the
school is all about. I'm still conflicted,but I think
this weekend will help."
Other ProFros, like Kaitlyn Toole, came to
Admit Weekend even though they have already
committed to matriculate.
"1 wanted to attend this program because I
wanted to see the school and my future class
mates," Toole said. "I wanted to get a feel of
what being a Stanford student is like and see the
range of activities available."
But though Toole will be wearing Cardinal in
the fall, she said that her experiences today con
vinced her that she made the right decision.
"More than the gorgeous campus and
unbeatable reputation, what really convinced
me to come here was the tour guide who led my
tour group," she said. "It was so obvious that he
just loved the school — his enthusiasm and
emotion was so tangible and it was clear that
students love being here. It was then that I
decided that I want to be here. I want to be part
of this."
