### CRISTINA BAUTISTA 
Candlelight illuminated the faces of
about 70 activists marching from White
Plaza to the Main Quad in a silent demon
stration of solidarity for victims of violence
against women during the 17th annual Take
Back the Night (TBTN) march.
"There are a lot of women's events at
Stanford, but this is one is special," said
Jillian Wong '08, organizer of the event. "A
lot of people don't know that violence
against women is a bigtissue."
The event originate! in San Francisco in
the 19705, when survivors of sexual violence
came together and talked about their expe
riences. Throughout the years, it has
evolved to include rallies and marches.
Stanford's TBTN began with a short
opening ceremony, which featured a per
formance by the Talisman a cappella group
and several speakers, and culminated in a
silent walk around campus in the dimly lit

areas where women were most likely to
experience sexual assault.
"Historically, this is an event for women
to make a statement against violence," said
Carol Partofsky, director of Health
Promotion Services at Vaden Health
Center. "It's about taking back a night in
which women feel safe and empowered."
"It's part of our humanity to desire to be
free and to know you're in a safe place,"
added Sally Baird, from Sexual Assault
Prevention at Vaden.
Jesse Wallin '08, president of Men
Against Abuse Now (MAAN), provided a
male perspective on the issue of women's
violence.
"Working on ending all violence, espe
cially violence against women, is something
I'm passionate about," Wallin said. "It is
fundamentally unjust for women to have to
face gender based violence."
"'lTiis is a really important event that
means a lot to the greater community and

myself, personally," said Jenna Whiteley '08.
a Peer Health Educator for West Flo and a
participant in TBTN for the second year in
a row.
Several organizations, including the Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity, came out to support
the event.
"It was interesting," said Martin Duncan
'09, a Phi Kappa Psi member. "I've never
walked around the quad in complete
silence before. It gave me a lot of time to
think why I was there."
TBTN was sponsored by Vaden, the
PHE program, Sigma Psi Zeta, the Order
of Omega, the Interfraterity Council, the
Intersorority Council and was endorsed by
various councils.
"This is an event where we can come
together and say, 'Stop the violence,'"
Partofsky said.
