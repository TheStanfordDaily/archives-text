SIERRA MADRE, Calif. (AP)
— Firefighters gained ground Sun
day against an early season wildfire
that slowly chewed its way through
dense brush near Los Angeles, forc
ing more than I.(XX) people from
homes in the foothills.
About 500 firefighters attacked
the 400-acre fire, aided by two heli
copters and water-dropping air
tankers, said Elisa Weaver, spokes
woman for the city of Sierra Madre.
Residents evacuated at least 550
homes Saturday night and Sunday,
but none had burned.
"This is pretty serious." Weaver
said. "Some of these areas have not
burned in over 40 years."
Crews had the fire 30 percent con
tained by Sunday evening. Sierra
Madre spokesman James Carlson
said. Light winds and rising humidity
were aiding firefighters, who hoped
to have the blaze fully contained
within 4-7 days, Carlson said.
Helicopters dropped water on a
steep ridge above Sierra Madre near
Bailey Canyon Wilderness Park,
about 15 miles northeast of Los An
geles and just east of Pasadena. A
fixed-wing water tanker also
dropped flame retardant.
Aircraft were also helping fire of
ficials assess the movement of the
blaze, which was being pushed north
west into Angeles National Forest,
said Batallion Chief Tim Davis of the
Forest Service.
"It's very steep, inaccessible terrain,
and it's very heavy brush." Davis said
at a news conference. "Very difficult
and arduous labor for these crews.
You can't get bulldozers into the ma
jority of where these fingers of fire
run."
The blaze also stranded 50 guests
from a wedding party at the Chantry
Flats ranger's station on Saturday

until they were airlifted out Sunday
afternoon, Weaver said. It took five
helicopter trips from the ranger's sta
tion to the parking area where the
wedding party's cars were.The party
then was escorted out by road.
The fire was first reported Satur
day afternoon in a wooded area a few
miles northeast of Pasadena. It was
windy at the time and unseasonably
hot. with temperatures approaching
1 (X) degrees.
ITie flames also brought the evacua
tion of a Boy Scout camp Saturday

and left about 100 hikers stranded in
a parking lot. Most of the Scouts had
already left the camp by the time the
evacuation was ordered. Weaver
said, and no injuries were reported.
Firefighters originally had hoped
to have the blaze contained Sunday,
but gusting winds late Saturday night
kept the fire out of control and sent it
creeping toward nearby homes. The
mandatory home evacuations came
shortly before 11 p.m.
Two shelters have been set up for
evacuees at a senior center and a

church.
Flames outlined steep ridges
about a mile above Sierra Madre, a
San Gabriel Mountains foothill com
munity of about 11,000 popular with
artists. All the city's schools canceled
classes Monday.
To the south in San Diego County,
about 40 acres burned in thick brush
about 15 miles north of downtown
San Diego. No injuries or property
damage had been reported, a San
Diego Fire Department spokes
woman said.
