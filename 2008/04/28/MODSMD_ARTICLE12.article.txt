WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) â€”
Hillary Rodham Clinton said the as
sassination attempt Sunday on the
Afghan president shows that the US.
has failed to give proper attention to
Afghanistan.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for
the assault that missed President
Hamid Karzai but killed three and
wounded eight others at a ceremony
in Kabul. Gunman opened fire as a
21-gun salute echoed over the capital
at an anniversary ceremony marking
the mujahedeen victory over the So
viet occupation of Afghanistan.
Clinton noted how she had met
Karzai, and said, "He is a brave man
trying under very difficult circum
stances to hold that country together,
and we have not given him the re
sources he needs."
Afghanistan needs to get "as much, if
not more attention" than Iraq, she

added.
McCain has repeatedly said he has
no intention of extending the war into
the next century, but would keep a
U.S. military presence in Iraq much as
the United States has in Germany,
Japan and South Korea.
The Republican National Com
mittee charged that the DNC ad dis
torted McCain's comments, and it as
serted again that the ad was illegal be
cause it was made in coordination
with the Obama and Clinton cam
paigns. Dean has denied any coordi
nation with the campaigns.
The Democratic candidates have
also acknowledged they would keep
non-combat troops in Iraq to ensure
its stability. But they have said they
would begin withdrawing combat
troops promptly upon becoming
president, a step McCain has said
would be precipitous.
