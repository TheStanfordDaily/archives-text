'09 talked their way into Stanford
debate history with two big wins at

institute of Technology.
The pair navigated six prelimi
nary' rounds and one final round
to become the first varsity team
champions from Stanford. Baer,
who has been debating for
Stanford since his freshman year,
achieved another Stanford first
when he was named the tourna
ment's top speaker. In the final
round of competition, Baer and
Mitra defeated Princeton, arguing
that when faced with the choice,
an evolutionary biologist should
choose to publicly debate an intel
ligent design advocate.
"We were definitely an under
dog" said Christine Su '08. presi
dent of the Stanford Debate
Society. "It was pretty amazing that
we won Nationals."
Stanford's parliamentary debate
team competes within APDA. a
league consisting of mostly East
Coast schools. Consequently,
Stanford's much higher travel
expenses means that the team only
competes in about half the number
of debates that East Coast schools
are able to attend.
"We thought that we could be
competitive," Mitra said. "There is
a ranking system for teams on the
circuit based on points accumulat
ed during the year, [one] which
favors the schools that are able to
travel to the East Coast debates,
and we didn't travel a lot. Even
then, we were fourth in the rank
ings, so we thought we had a

chance. But we didn't think we
were favorites to win or any
thing."
Both Baer and Mitra began
debating in high school. Baer, a
Public Policy major, joined the
Stanford Debate Society after sign
ing up at an activities fair and
quickly grew to enjoy the parlia
mentary debate format that he
focuses on.
"Parliamentary debate empha
sizes extemporaneous speaking
and the ability to come up with an
argument quickly, on your feet,"
Baer said.These skills translate into
the classroom. "I write papers bet
ter. I'm better in section —every-
thing about school becomes easier
with the skills I learned through
debate."
While debate fits logically into
many Stanford Debate Society
members' academic and career
plans, Mitra is a rare math major on
the team. The team captain
nonetheless believes debate's ben
efits span across all disciplines.
"Debate is nice because what
ever your field happens to be, it
encourages a lot of critical think
ing," Mitra said. "It makes you
think about both sides and justify
every thing you say."
After graduating in June, Baer
plans to move back to his home
town of Washington, DC. where
he hopes to pursue public policy
before going to law school.
Mitra has every intention of
continuing with debate.
"I've had a fantastic time debat
ing with Michael," he said. "He's an
excellent partner and his experi
ence helped me a lot, so I hope that
next year 1 will be able to help my
partner in the same way."
