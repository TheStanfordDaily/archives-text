## Editorial Board Draw confuses more than necessary 
### 
The Stanford housing draw is an in
credibly Byzantine process involving
priorities, preferences, groups and
houses. This time of year, no one — and es
pecially no freshman — seems to under
stand everything and the dreaded "draw
ma" is ensuing. An upperclassmen's only
knowledge of the draw comes from past ex
perience and anecdotes. And freshmen only
have their staffs' and friends' past experi
ences to go on. This leaves many freshmen
unnecessarily clueless and anxious.
The most commonly misunderstood as
pect of the draw is the way the process han
dles co-ed draw groups. Since housing is as
signed based on gender and men and women
cutoff numbers in certain houses can be
drastically different, parts of co-ed draw
groups often end up in housing without the
members of the opposite sex with whom
they drew. On housing.stanford.edu, co-ed
draw groups are discouraged from forming
with the statement that "men and women
are assigned differently in the Draw pro
gram, so co-ed groups will likely be spilt in
the assignment process." This discourage
ment, however, is sometimes misunder
stood, especially by vulnerable freshmen
new to the process.
Priority is another draw buzzword that is
often misinterpreted by students. The dead
line to turn in special priority applications
pops up while people are still trying to con
sider their options and form their group, and
priority opportunities are not very well pub
licized. In fact, the priority deadline was last
Friday, Apr. 25, even though groups don't
need to form until this coming Sunday Un
like upperclassmen who might have an idea
of where their group wants priority before
hand, any freshmen who is with-it enough to
know about the priority deadline is trying to
form a group, scope out houses and get pri
ority all at the same time — and all while
rush is taking place. In the end. many draw
groups fail to secure priority because of a
lack of information and coordination so far
before the group-forming deadline.
In-house draw is another source of mys
tery. Different houses conduct their in
house draw in drastically different ways. In

the end, it is in-house draw that determines
one's living space and for many this is an im
portant feature of their residential experi
ence. Every year it seems that there are
sophomores who draw into Roble with
dreams of snatching up one of the many sin
gles, only to discover later that they will be
last in line to receive them. Some people
may be interested more in a location or spe
cific social sphere and care mostly about
what house or dorm to which they are as
signed,leaving the in-house draw as an after
thought. But it must be remembered that
getting a "good" number doesn't guarantee
a "good" room —just a "good" house.
Stanford Housing is taking a few steps to
eliminate the confusion surrounding the
draw. Dates and times for deadlines are
widely publicized — though not necessarily
the meanings of these deadlines — through
flyers and emails. An email sent Apr. 26
alerted yet-unapplied underclassmen to
apply for the draw before May 4. This week
in White Plaza there will be a "Get Your
Draw Questions Answered" table from
11:30 am to 1:15 pm on Monday. Wednesday
and Friday. This resource is. however, ap
pearing rather late in the draw process con
sidering that the disability draw and priority
deadlines have already passed.
Also, the open houses that allow draw ap
plicants to get a feel for various living op
tions have already passed. In fact, the last
open house was a day after the draw opened
for registration. While open houses are a
great idea and prove useful to get an idea of
where to live, most people don't and can't
talk specifics about where they are going to
live until after they are assigned their num
ber— or at least after the draw opens for
registration.
Draw will always be a stressful time for
students but it can be made less so through a
commitment to providing students, especial
ly those least likely to know what is going on,
with the knowledge they need to navigate
the process. The open houses and question
tables are steps in the right direction, but
they need to be reconsidered in the overall
timeline, especially with relation to the
deadlines for forming groups.
