# Little Ms. Modern
## Certainty in an uncertain world 
### 
According to physics, our world is neces
sarily uncertain. Werner Heisenberg es
tablished this idea in his 1926 Uncer
tainty Principle, which states that measuring
a very small particle's momentum will make
its position in space uncertain, and vice
versa. His theory was influential in many
spheres beyond science. The incessantly
angsty and questionably insane surrealist
Salvador Dali, for example, became a fan in
the late fifties. In his "Anti-Matter Mani
festo," Dali wrote that while he had previ
ously been inspired by psychology and the
work of Sigmund Freud, he had recently
found deeper transcendence in modern
physics: "My father today is Dr. Heisen
berg."
Artists who sloppily reference important
scientific theories tend to make me cranky,
as I suspect they do so only to seem smarter
via esotericism. It reminds me of the recent,
regrettable nerd-chic trend, in which hip
sters mimic the mannerisms of society's
dorkiest, like wearing weird glasses and t
shirts with equations, minus the redeeming
intelligence that normally complements
these habits.Then again, perhaps my grudge
against Dali is also a bit personal,since I my
self sloppily referenced Heisenberg in a cute
little "Intro to Contemporary Art" project of
my own. Yes, I was trying to seem more intel
ligent via esotericism; yes, my art professors
ate it up; and yes, I was outraged when I
learned that Dali preemptively copied my
brilliant idea.
Personal hang-ups aside, uncertainty,
when manifested either through physics or
the arts, is a veritable reality of modern life.
I'm taking quite a few courses this quarter
about how uncertainties in problem state
ments affect the outcomes of solutions. Ma
terial properties, structural system configu
rations and loading conditions are all char
acterized by probability distributions rather
than absolute values. Many of the difficulties
in my field derive simply from not precisely
knowing the parameters that define the
problems we're trying to solve.
In everyday life as well, we often need to
make decisions in uncertain situations. It's
usually impossible to know all the relevant

facts, and. unfortunately, this is most true for
our most important choices. In selecting
which jobs to take, which cities to move to
and which people to seriously date, we must
act within clouds of doubt rather than clear
skies of obvious truth. We must take risks. As
I am learning in my decision analysis class,
there are numerical, logical ways to work
through these dilemmas, but our conclusions
are only as good as the probabilities and util
ities that we assign to various outcomes. Per
haps I think that 1 have an 83 percent chance
of being happier back East than here on the
West Coast, or maybe I have estimated that
being close to friends and family is worth 2.7
times as much as a professional opportunity.
It's quite possible, however, that I'm dead
wrong.
In the frequent face of such uncertainty, I
sometimes sit back and marvel that we mod
ern beings manage to make decisions at all.
Some people don't seem to have trouble
with this — our country's current President
didn't mind going to war over weapons of
mass destruction whose existence was high
ly uncertain at best, nor did he have trouble
asserting that a mission was definitively ac
complished when it probably wasn't or forg
ing ahead with a military operation that may
very well be impossible to win. In fact, he's
called himself "The Decider"on multiple oc
casions. But what about those of us who are
not so prone to seeing our blurry, gray world
in black and white?
The most painless answer would be to
make like George W. — pick an answer and
don't think twice (or even once!). And in
deed. sometimes arbitrary decisiveness is a
good, effective way to deal with modern
dilemmas that we tend to face, such as, for
example, when choosing between expensive
