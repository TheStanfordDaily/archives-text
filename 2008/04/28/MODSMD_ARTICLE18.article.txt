## Don't be a stranger 
### 
One of the first things we learn as chil
dren is to never talk to strangers. Our
parents and our teachers and that
crime-fighting dog McGruff tell us that if
some unfamiliar face comes out of an uniden
tified vehicle and offers us jelly beans, we
should firmly refuse them and walk away,
even if we really, really like jelly beans. If we
feel especially threatened, we are even told to
scream.
Eventually we grow old enough to distin
guish between somebody who might want to
kidnap us and someone we simply do not
know. And while the wariness we were taught
as children is certainly helpful to keep in mind
in unsafe situations, I often wonder why so
many of us are still averse to strangers. Our
discomfort with people we don't know mani
fests in different ways: refusing to call a pizza
boy,squirming when a random adult attempts
to strike up conversation at the airport, etc.
Although 1 too was taught to be careful as
a child, 1 was also exposed to an unorthodox
approach to strangers from my mother, who
will basically talk to any animate object, store
clerks, those grouchy old men in the deli line
and stray cats included. I can't count the num
ber of times I have overheard her on the
phone and thought she was talking to a friend
until I found out she was getting the life story
out of a customer service representative. At
first, her love of people freaked me out and
horrified my young, teenage self, but now, I'm
just as bad.
For me, traveling offers the best opportu
nity to talk to strangers and meet new peo
ple, especially because I often travel alone.
The first time I engaged in a long conversa
tion with a seatmate on a plane was when I
was flying by myself to Stanford for Admit
Weekend.The lady next to me and I both re
ally needed to use the restroom, but we
weren't allowed to get up because of bad tur
bulence. Misery loves company so much that

we ended up talking for the whole flight. She
told me about her life in the Philippines, and
I talked to her about the travails of high
school.
Since then, I've had many strange but
wonderful plane talks. A mom and I once
started chatting because we were so happy we
had an empty seat between us and ended up
discussing her sons ADD, religion, homosex
uality, abortion and Britney Spears in the
hours between Texas and San Francisco. 1 did
n't realize how weird it was until she took out
her Bible and started showing me her favorite
passages. A college student and I once com
pared stories until we got sleepy and decided
to switch iPods for the rest of the flight so we
could listen to new music. Over winter break,
a man from New Zealand distracted me from
an upset stomach by telling me insane travel
stories from his past and encouraging me to
become a writer and go to New York City.
On my recent flight back from Florida to
Stanford, the 70ish year old man on my left
starting chatting with me because he was hav
ing difficulty falling asleep —air traveling
made him extremely nervous. When the for
mer English major(!) finally decided to zonk
out, he took some valium and then asked me
if I wanted one, too. Although I was perfectly
content with my chewable, grape-flavored Ju
nior Motrin. 1 was touched at his offer.
Friends forever.
Although I'm a plane talker, 1 am careful
not to be that annoying person next to you
that won't shut up. I usually only initiate con

versation after I intuit some sort of body lan
guage — a smile or mutual eye contact. It's
often a conscious decision — do I want to
shut down and stick in my headphones or do
1 want to interact?
In all honesty, I don't remember the names
of any of the random people I've interacted
with over the years. In fact, we rarely ex
changed names in the first place. But I do re
member their stories and their random advice
and their genuine friendliness. And the fact
that I will never see them again doesn't make
our interactions any less meaningful. There
are a lot of people in this world, and I will take
any opportunity I can to connect with one of
them even if just for two hours over stale air
plane peanuts or two minutes across a cash
register.
Let s not even consider strangers in the
outside world for a moment. How often do
you walk around Stanford and find yourself
apprehensively intrigued by unfamiliar
faces ? Do you ever think to yourself, "that
looks like somebody I could be friends with,"
and just walk away, day after day? Although I
love strangers, I find myself more inhibited
here, probably because I know there is a good
chance I will see someone again and not be
able to simply tuck him or her away in my
memory.
I m writing this as a challenge to many of
you but also to myself. As 1 realize that it
won t be long in the scope of history before I
graduate and/or die and/or perish, I find that
my already long-lost dignity is worth much
less than the chance of making a new friend.
So smile at someone new, damn it. Talk to a
stranger (in a safe situation). Give a compli
ment. What have you got to lose?

Seriously, don't be a stranger. E-mail Natalie

talk over some Jelly Bellies, particularly the red

you but also to myself. As 1 realize that it
won t be long in the scope of history before I
graduate and/or die and/or perish, I find that
my already long-lost dignity is worth much
less than the chance of making a new friend.
So smile at someone new, damn it. Talk to a
stranger (in a safe situation). Give a compli
ment. What have you got to lose?

Seriously, don't be a stranger. E-mail Natalie
Jabbar at njabbar@stanford. edu if you want to
talk over some Jelly Bellies, particularly the red
ones
