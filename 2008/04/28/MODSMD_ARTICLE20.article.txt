## SOFTBALL Bruins sweep Cardinal No. 7 Stanford defeats Washington, but loses two close games to UCLA 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team
grabbed a 2-1 extra-innings victory over
Washington on Friday, but its pitching
could not quite make up for a stagnant
offense the next two days,as the Cardinal
lost a pair of close games (1-0 and 4-1)
against No. 4 UCLA on Saturday and
Sunday.
Stanford (42-10, 7-8 Pacific-10 Con
ference) pitcher Missy Penna threw 24
innings over the three games for the Car
dinal, picking up her 30th win of the sea
son in the Washington game. Penna be
came just the second pitcher in program
history to win 30 games in a season.
The Cardinal could not get anything
going early against Washington (25-17-1,
4-8 Pac-10). Huskies pitcher Macon
Aleah gave up only a bunt single in the
first three innings. But Aleah started to
show cracks in her armor in the bottom
of the fourth.
Stanford sophomore catcher Rosey
Neill tagged a one-out single to right field
and two batters later the bases were
loaded thanks to a hit batsman and a
walk. Senior third baseman Michelle
Smith then forced a run home with an
other walk, successfully laying off a full
count pitch.
As quickly as it had awoken, the Car
dinal offense went to sleep again, not
managing another hit until the third
extra frame, the tenth inning. Washing
ton had scored to make it 1-1 and force
extras in the top of the seventh with a sac
rifice fly, and the two teams traded no-hit
half-innings until the Cardinal outfield
set things up from the plate.
Right fielder Alana Beardman and
center fielder Alissa Haber hit back-to
back one-out singles before left fielder
Tricia Aggabao moved them to second
and third with a sacrifice bunt. Designat
ed player Erin Howe then drew a walk,
putting Neill at the plate with the bases
loaded. Neill drew another full count
from Aleah before watching ball four sail
by to drive home the winning run.
The UCLA pitching staff, however,
was far less forgiving to the Stanford of
fense in the next two games. The Bruins
walked only two Stanford batters in all
14 innings that they played, minimizing
the damage done by the Cardinal s eight
total hits.
Only one of those eight Stanford hits
was for extra bases — a double by
Maddy Coon in the Saturday game.
Stanford never led in the two games
against UCLA. The Cardinal had four
hits but no runs in the first three innings
on Sunday, while UCLA took advan
tage of back-to-back doubles in the
fourth inning to get all the runs it need
ed. The Cardinal could not solve
UCLA's committee of pitchers and
ended up losing 1-0.
UCLA gave itself a more comfort
able cushion in the first inning of the Sun
day match-up. Penna struck out the first
Bruin, but the next two got on base
and both scored when cleanup hitter
Megan Langenfeld smacked a three
run homerun to right field.
Stanford got one run back in the
second inning when Shannon Koplitz
singled home Coon, but it was not
enough for the Cardinal, who suc
cumbed by a 4-1 score.
Sunday's loss to UCLA was also
Senior Day for the Cardinal. The six
seniors on Stanford's roster —
Beardman, Aggabao, Smith. Howe,
pitcher Becky McCullough and utili
ty player Jess Zutz — were honored
in their final home game at Smith
Family Stadium.
The Cardinal will return to the
field this weekend in the Pacific
Northwest as the team hits the road
to play Oregon on Friday and then a
pair against Oregon State on Satur
day and Sunday.
