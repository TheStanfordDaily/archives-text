# GYMNASTS PLACE THIRD
## Stanford finishes NCAA Championships as one of the "Super Six" 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Get back into the Super Six" has been the
mantra for the Stanford women's gymnastics
team all season long. That is exactly what the
team achieved during last week's NCAA Cham
pionships at Stegman Coliseum in Athens, Ga.
The Cardinal reached the Super Six (the last
six teams left with a chance to win the national
title) with its performance on Thursday night
and went on to finish in third place.
Stanford hit 23 of 24 routines Thursday
evening with three members competing in the
All-Around: senior Tabitha Yim. junior Nicole
Ourada and sophomore Carly Janiga. The Card
began the evening on floor, where Janiga earned
the team's highest score with a 9.875,f0110wed by
Yim, who received a 9.850. Junior Kelly Fee was
also a top scorer for the team on floor. She re
ceived a 9.825. Despite having to step in at the
last minute, senior Alex Pintchouk still managed
to contribute, earning a solid 9.800.
"The evening session had a lot of talented
teams, and we knew going into our last event that
we needed to hit our routines to move on to the
next round. I think facing all those teams in pre
lims gave us a lot of confidence going into (the]

Super Six," Yim said.
The Card rotated to vault, where senior Liz
Tricase made her NCAA debut with a 9.850.
Freshman Shelly Alexander continued her suc
cessful first season as a Cardinal by tying sopho
more Blair Ryland with a 9.800.
Bars — where the Cardinal has dominated
all year — were up next for the Stanford
women. Yim and Tricase tied for the team's high
est score, each earning a 9.900. Junior Nicole
Ourada added depth with a 9.875, and Fee
rounded out the top scores with a 9.850.
For their final rotation of the evening, the
Card landed on beam, where the team went
four-for-four, hitting every single routine. Yim
again led the way with the team's highest score
of 9.900. Ourada earned the team's second high
est score with a 9.875. Fee followed closely be
hind with a 9.825, and Elmore and junior
I leather Purnell tied with ;i score of 9.,5(K).
After the last rotation, however, the Card's
night was not over, as it watched the final round
that would determine whether or not it would
advance on to the Super Six. Utah came in sec
ond place with a 196.950, but Michigan fell apart
