# GYMNASTS PLACE THIRD
## Stanford finishes NCAA Championships as one of the "Super Six" 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Get back into the Super Six" has been the
mantra for the Stanford women's gymnastics
team all season long. That is exactly what the
team achieved during last week's NCAA Cham
pionships at Stegman Coliseum in Athens, Ga.
The Cardinal reached the Super Six (the last
six teams left with a chance to win the national
title) with its performance on Thursday night
and went on to finish in third place.
Stanford hit 23 of 24 routines Thursday
evening with three members competing in the
All-Around: senior Tabitha Yim. junior Nicole
Ourada and sophomore Carly Janiga. The Card
began the evening on floor, where Janiga earned
the team's highest score with a 9.875,f0110wed by
Yim, who received a 9.850. Junior Kelly Fee was
also a top scorer for the team on floor. She re
ceived a 9.825. Despite having to step in at the
last minute, senior Alex Pintchouk still managed
to contribute, earning a solid 9.800.
"The evening session had a lot of talented
teams, and we knew going into our last event that
we needed to hit our routines to move on to the
next round. I think facing all those teams in pre
lims gave us a lot of confidence going into (the]

Super Six," Yim said.
The Card rotated to vault, where senior Liz
Tricase made her NCAA debut with a 9.850.
Freshman Shelly Alexander continued her suc
cessful first season as a Cardinal by tying sopho
more Blair Ryland with a 9.800.
Bars — where the Cardinal has dominated
all year — were up next for the Stanford
women. Yim and Tricase tied for the team's high
est score, each earning a 9.900. Junior Nicole
Ourada added depth with a 9.875, and Fee
rounded out the top scores with a 9.850.
For their final rotation of the evening, the
Card landed on beam, where the team went
four-for-four, hitting every single routine. Yim
again led the way with the team's highest score
of 9.900. Ourada earned the team's second high
est score with a 9.875. Fee followed closely be
hind with a 9.825, and Elmore and junior
I leather Purnell tied with ;i score of 9.,5(K).
After the last rotation, however, the Card's
night was not over, as it watched the final round
that would determine whether or not it would
advance on to the Super Six. Utah came in sec
ond place with a 196.950, but Michigan fell apart

The Cardinal made its second Super Six in as many years, and the program's fourth overall. The
team competed in the NCAA finals against top competition such as Georgia, who was playing es
sentially at home in Athens, and Utah. Stanford ultimately finished third to the Bulldogs and Utes.
on beam to earn the fifth place seed,
which was not enough to bump out
the Cardinal.
"We knew that we belonged at the
Super Six," Janiga said. "That is not to
say that we didn't have to fight and
have each other's backs on the first
night. But we knew that the teams that
should be at [the] Super Six would
make it, and they did."
Stanford's trip to the Super Six was
its second in a row and fourth in pro
gram history.
"These past three years we have
heard a lot about the '04 team but now
in future years the 08 team will be
something to talk about instead," said
Ourada.
On Friday, the Card changed histo
ry again with a score that tied for the
schools highest finish in history,
196.750, to solidly secure third. De
spite the relatively unwelcoming envi

ronment of competing against Geor
gia on its home turf for the national
title, the Stanford women kept their
heads up, maintained their focus and
managed to amp up their routines to
prove that they belonged in the Super
Six.
Reflecting, Fee said, "This week
end has shown me that to beat the best
team, you have to not only perform
better than them, but you must do it by
a substantial margin. The only way of
stopping Georgia from winning their
fifth straight title is to be a whole lot
better than they are from day one of
the season until the last night."
But for this year, Georgia came
away with its fourth national title with
the night's highest score, 197.450.
Utah came in second place with a
197.125.
Yim, Janiga and Ourada again
competed in the all-around. All three
posted solid scores on each event.
On vault,Tricase led the way with a
huge score of 9.925. Yim earned a
9.850 while Ourada received a solid
9.800.
The Card kept up its solid bars per

formance on Thursday night with two
9.900 scores, one garnered by Tricase
and the other by Janiga. Ourada also
received a 9.875.
Throughout the season. Stanford
has had a very deep beam line-up, and
despite a few hiccoughs at the begin
ning of the season, the Card has gotten
back all of its key beam performers.
Friday night especially, the Card
showed all it had on this apparatus.
Three athletes earned a 9.850 on the
beam, including Yim, Janiga and Pur
nell. Fee and Elmore followed close
behind with a 9.825 and 9.800, respec
tively.
Floor was another strong event for
the Card. Yim wooed the crowd and
the judges with a routine that earned
her a 9.900. In another three-way tie,
Elmore, Ourada and Pintchouk each
earned a 9.825.
"It was a true team effort, and we
enjoyed every minute of it. Obviously
we wanted to win, but it was nice to
bring the program back to where it
was before we, six seniors, got here,"
said Yim.
Even though the team competi

tions were finished, after Friday night.
Seniors Yini and Tricase and junior
Ourada were not. All three earned
spots to compete for individual na
tional titles on Saturday afternoon.
Tricase competed in the bars, though
last year she earned the 2007 vault in
dividual title.
Although the seniors will now de
part. they will leave behind a legacy
and standard of excellence.
"We have laid the foundation for
continued and expected success from
Stanford at the Super Six competition.
The next generation [of Stanford
gymnasts] will know that they were se
lected to join a team that loves its
sport, has fun and is in it to win it," said
Fee.
"This group loves the sport, and
they have so much fun together. Their
energy and passion has lifted this pro
gram. To have a team that cares as
much about each other as this entire
team does, is what college athletics is
about," said coach Kristen Smvth.
