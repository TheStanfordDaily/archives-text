## Card loses in conference tourney 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
After capturing its 21st consecutive con
ference title, the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis team was expecting to be well-represent
ed and ready to contend at the 2008 Pac-10
Championships.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal women fin
ished play at Ojai,Calif, a bit earlier than they
had hoped for.
"We went down there and competed and
we won some matches," head coach Lele
Forood said. "We would ve liked to win a few
more of them but that's how it goes. You
never know who's going to get hot at that
tournament."
Freshmen Hilary Barte and Jennifer Yen
reached the quarterfinals of their singles
bracket, but that was one of only a few bright
spots for Stanford. Instead, the losses
abounded.
In all. four Cardinal women suffered de
feat at the hands of California opponents,
whom the team beat 5-2 in its season finale.
No other loss was as significant as Barte's
quarterfinal match against Cal's Claire ll
cinkas. in which she retired because of a
strained pectoral muscle.
The loss ended Barte's 19-match win
streak and marked just her second defeat to a
Pac-10 opponent.
"It's just a strain." Forood said. "So she's
going to do a lot of therapy this week and
she'll be okay"
The injury bug also caught junior Jessica
Nguyen and senior Celia Durkin, who did not
play in the singles championships.
Nguyen, however, was able to compete
with senior Whitney Deason in the doubles
bracket, winning against the Abdala sisters of
Arizona State before dropping 8-5 to Cal's
Susie Babos and Stephanie Kusano.
"Jessica seemed to have a good match in
the first round against the Abdala sisters of

ASU and lost against the Cal team," Forood
said. "They made a nice comeback and even
tually lost that one. That was fine â€” it was a
good chance to play a few matches and keep
working on their teamwork."
Also representing the Cardinal was the
team of Barte and sophomore Lindsay Bur
dette, the third seed in the doubles bracket.
Despite their ranking, the duo shockingly
dropped their first round match to Cal's Bo
jana Bobusic and Cristina Visico 8-6.
"That was a little surprising," Forood said
of the match. "They just made too many mis
takes in that match and we weren't able to re
cover from that."
In what should have been a tournament
dominated by Stanford, UCLA shined the
most with three individual titles.
In the end, with Barte out of the competi
tion, UCLA's Riza Zalameda claimed the
Pac-10 singles title.
Fellow Bruin Alex McGoodwin claimed
the Invitational singles bracket, while Mc-
Goodwin and Andrea Remynse claimed the
Invitational doubles title.
Despite the subpar showing, Ojai is not in
dicative of the Cardinal's true capabilities.
"Ojai's such a different kind of event,"
Forood said. "Everybody plays really loose
and the matches are totally different from
dual match play. You just go out there, bring
what you got that day and hopefully you're
successful.
Now, Stanford must wait until lliesday
when it finds out who its first round NCAA
opponent will be.
As a top-ranked school, the Cardinal
women are expecting to host the first two
rounds of this year's tournament.
"The next thing we're doing is the draw
show on Tliesday to know our first and sec
ond round opponents," Forood said. "We
look forward to finding out TUesday who we
