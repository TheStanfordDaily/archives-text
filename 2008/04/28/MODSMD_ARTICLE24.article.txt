# Trojans shutout, routed
## Big bats, precise pitching help No. 5 Stanford win weekend series over USC 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
No. 5 Stanford dominated USC in
the first two games of their weekend se
ries. but was unable to complete a come
back to win the final contest on Sunday.
The Cardinal shutout theTVojans4-0
on Friday night behind the perform
ance of starter Austin Yount, who
turned in his best showing of the year.
The junior, normally a third baseman

who has been used sparingly as a pitch
er all season, went for over seven in
nings for Stanford, allowing just three
hits in the process.
"He had a phenomenal performance
on Friday night," said coach Mark Mar
quess.
"I'm trying to do whatever I can to
help the team." said Yount.
Yount was aided by junior first base
man Brent Milleville, the Cardinal's
hottest hitter over the past two weeks,
who drove in three of Stanford's four
runs and scored the final one. Milleville
doubled twice in the contest — in the
first inning, he scored junior Jason Cas
tro from first, and in the third, he drove
in junior Cord Phelps and senior Bren
dan Domaracki.
With a cushion from his offense,
Yount subsequently shut down the Tro
jans, preventing and working out of

trouble when needed. But almost all of
the outs were recorded by the defense
— Yount struck out only one batter —
which led the righthander to offer lofty
praise for his teammates.
"When guys make plays behind you,
it'll pick you up." he said.
Stanford's offense churned out nine
hits in the contest, but the four runs pro
duced were nothing extraordinary.
That, however, would change on Satur
day. when the Cardinal scored a season
high 26 runs.
Saturday: Stanford 26, (JSC 5
The offense exploded against seven
USC pitchers, none of whom lasted
over two innings. Sophomore Toby Ger
hart homered twice and drove in a team
high five runs for the Cardinal.
