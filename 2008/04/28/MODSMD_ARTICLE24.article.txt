# Trojans shutout, routed
## Big bats, precise pitching help No. 5 Stanford win weekend series over USC 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
No. 5 Stanford dominated USC in
the first two games of their weekend se
ries. but was unable to complete a come
back to win the final contest on Sunday.
The Cardinal shutout theTVojans4-0
on Friday night behind the perform
ance of starter Austin Yount, who
turned in his best showing of the year.
The junior, normally a third baseman

who has been used sparingly as a pitch
er all season, went for over seven in
nings for Stanford, allowing just three
hits in the process.
"He had a phenomenal performance
on Friday night," said coach Mark Mar
quess.
"I'm trying to do whatever I can to
help the team." said Yount.
Yount was aided by junior first base
man Brent Milleville, the Cardinal's
hottest hitter over the past two weeks,
who drove in three of Stanford's four
runs and scored the final one. Milleville
doubled twice in the contest — in the
first inning, he scored junior Jason Cas
tro from first, and in the third, he drove
in junior Cord Phelps and senior Bren
dan Domaracki.
With a cushion from his offense,
Yount subsequently shut down the Tro
jans, preventing and working out of

trouble when needed. But almost all of
the outs were recorded by the defense
— Yount struck out only one batter —
which led the righthander to offer lofty
praise for his teammates.
"When guys make plays behind you,
it'll pick you up." he said.
Stanford's offense churned out nine
hits in the contest, but the four runs pro
duced were nothing extraordinary.
That, however, would change on Satur
day. when the Cardinal scored a season
high 26 runs.
Saturday: Stanford 26, (JSC 5
The offense exploded against seven
USC pitchers, none of whom lasted
over two innings. Sophomore Toby Ger
hart homered twice and drove in a team
high five runs for the Cardinal.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Stanford relied on its pitching to beat USC on Friday as the Cardinal's arms led the team to a 4-0 victory The
bats won Saturday's match, 26-5, as Stanford scored more runs than it had in a game all year previously
Senior pitcher Erik Davis, who
has been Stanford's best and most
consistent hurler all season, ran into
trouble in the first inning, when he
gave up a three-run homer to Trojan
Grant Green. But he settled down
and went six innings for the Cardinal
before turning the ball over to fresh
man Danny Sandbrink, who finished
the game.
"I'm just trying to keep my team
in the game," said Davis. "That's all
I'm looking for."
Marquess was quick to commend
his staff s ace, not just for his work on
Saturday, but for his performances
throughout the year as well.
"The critical guy is Erik Davis,"
he said. "My hat goes off to him."
But the story of the day was the
Cardinal offense, which plated runs
in every inning but the fourth. Castro
went 4-6 with a triple and four RBIs
and freshman third baseman Zach
Jones doubled twice to drive in three
runs. Stanford knocked out Brad
Boxberger after only an inning and a
third; his replacement, Kevin Cou
ture, didn't fare much better, and
lasted just over an inning himself.
"We had a pretty good idea of an
attack plan," said Castro.

worldly hitting display on Saturday,
the Cardinal looked like a good bet
to sweep the series.
But the Trojans had other plans.
In the final game, USC came out
swinging and was able to score three
quick runs off Cardinal starter soph
omore Jeffrey Inman, who lasted
only an inning. Stanford was able to
cut into the Trojan lead in the sec
ond, making the score a manageable
3-2.
USC put up a four-spot in the
fourth to take a 7-2 lead, but a Stan
ford run in the fourth and a two run
homerun by Castro in the fifth cut
the margin to 7-5.
Castro drilled his ninth homer of
the year on a pitch that, to him, was
fairly predictable.
"I was sitting on it, and 1 wanted
to be aggressive," he said. "[Trojan
starter Ryan Cook] had a tendency
to throw off-speed pitches, and he
left a changeup over the plate."
The score was pushed to 8-6 by

the ninth,and in the final frame, USC
added two runs to take a four-run
lead.
"They played well," said Mar
quess. "They got big hits in big spots."
But the game was not quite over
— Trojan reliever Anthony Vasquez
got two quick outs in the bottom of
the ninth, but he couldn't seal the
deal. Phelps and junior Jeff Whitlow
singled, and pinch hitter freshman
Colin Walsh drove in Phelps with a
hit of his own. Castro then knocked
in Whitlow, moving Walsh to third in
the process.
This brought up Milleville, a
pinch hitter who had been sitting out
due to a mild leg cramp. Speedy
sophomore Wande Olabisi pinch ran
for Castro, and the stage was set: a
double would tie the game.
Vasquez was replaced by Robert
Stock, who promptly threw a pitch to
the backstop. Walsh scored, and the
lacksidasical retrieval by catcher Se
bastian Salinas allowed Olabisi to
make it all the way to third.
Milleville, now, only needed a single
to tie the game.

He drilled a pitch down the right
field line, which would have been
good for at least a double, but it
hooked foul at the last moment.
Milleville subsequently hit a weak
grounder to the left of the mound.
Stock had to make a tough play, but
with Milleville's running ability
hindered by his injury, he was able
to get the out at first to end the
game.
"It's tough because we won the
first two games and expected to
sweep." said Castro. "It's bittersweet
to get close like that."
"We scored nine but gave up ten,"
said Davis. "From a pitching stand
point. that's unacceptable."
The Cardinal has a two-week
break from its Pac-10 schedule, as it
heads to Santa Clara today to face
the Broncos and will continue on to
face UC-Davis later in the week.
TTiey team will have a home-and
home series versus San Jose State
next weekend.

JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Stanford relied on its pitching to beat USC on Friday as the Cardinal's arms led the team to a 4-0 victory The
bats won Saturday's match, 26-5, as Stanford scored more runs than it had in a game all year previously
Senior pitcher Erik Davis, who
has been Stanford's best and most
consistent hurler all season, ran into
trouble in the first inning, when he
gave up a three-run homer to Trojan
Grant Green. But he settled down
and went six innings for the Cardinal
before turning the ball over to fresh
man Danny Sandbrink, who finished
the game.
"I'm just trying to keep my team
in the game," said Davis. "That's all
I'm looking for."
Marquess was quick to commend
his staff s ace, not just for his work on
Saturday, but for his performances
throughout the year as well.
"The critical guy is Erik Davis,"
he said. "My hat goes off to him."
But the story of the day was the
Cardinal offense, which plated runs
in every inning but the fourth. Castro
went 4-6 with a triple and four RBIs
and freshman third baseman Zach
Jones doubled twice to drive in three
runs. Stanford knocked out Brad
Boxberger after only an inning and a
third; his replacement, Kevin Cou
ture, didn't fare much better, and
lasted just over an inning himself.
"We had a pretty good idea of an
attack plan," said Castro.

worldly hitting display on Saturday,
the Cardinal looked like a good bet
to sweep the series.
But the Trojans had other plans.
In the final game, USC came out
swinging and was able to score three
quick runs off Cardinal starter soph
omore Jeffrey Inman, who lasted
only an inning. Stanford was able to
cut into the Trojan lead in the sec
ond, making the score a manageable
3-2.
USC put up a four-spot in the
fourth to take a 7-2 lead, but a Stan
ford run in the fourth and a two run
homerun by Castro in the fifth cut
the margin to 7-5.
Castro drilled his ninth homer of
the year on a pitch that, to him, was
fairly predictable.
"I was sitting on it, and 1 wanted
to be aggressive," he said. "[Trojan
starter Ryan Cook] had a tendency
to throw off-speed pitches, and he
left a changeup over the plate."
The score was pushed to 8-6 by

the ninth,and in the final frame, USC
added two runs to take a four-run
lead.
"They played well," said Mar
quess. "They got big hits in big spots."
But the game was not quite over
— Trojan reliever Anthony Vasquez
got two quick outs in the bottom of
the ninth, but he couldn't seal the
deal. Phelps and junior Jeff Whitlow
singled, and pinch hitter freshman
Colin Walsh drove in Phelps with a
hit of his own. Castro then knocked
in Whitlow, moving Walsh to third in
the process.
This brought up Milleville, a
pinch hitter who had been sitting out
due to a mild leg cramp. Speedy
sophomore Wande Olabisi pinch ran
for Castro, and the stage was set: a
double would tie the game.
Vasquez was replaced by Robert
Stock, who promptly threw a pitch to
the backstop. Walsh scored, and the
lacksidasical retrieval by catcher Se
bastian Salinas allowed Olabisi to
make it all the way to third.
Milleville, now, only needed a single
to tie the game.

He drilled a pitch down the right
field line, which would have been
good for at least a double, but it
hooked foul at the last moment.
Milleville subsequently hit a weak
grounder to the left of the mound.
Stock had to make a tough play, but
with Milleville's running ability
hindered by his injury, he was able
to get the out at first to end the
game.
"It's tough because we won the
first two games and expected to
sweep." said Castro. "It's bittersweet
to get close like that."
"We scored nine but gave up ten,"
said Davis. "From a pitching stand
point. that's unacceptable."
The Cardinal has a two-week
break from its Pac-10 schedule, as it
heads to Santa Clara today to face
the Broncos and will continue on to
face UC-Davis later in the week.
TTiey team will have a home-and
home series versus San Jose State
next weekend.

No. 5 Stanford dominated USC in
the first two games of their weekend se
ries. but was unable to complete a come
back to win the final contest on Sunday.
The Cardinal shutout theTVojans4-0
on Friday night behind the perform
ance of starter Austin Yount, who
turned in his best showing of the year.
The junior, normally a third baseman

who has been used sparingly as a pitch
er all season, went for over seven in
nings for Stanford, allowing just three
hits in the process.
"He had a phenomenal performance
on Friday night," said coach Mark Mar
quess.
"I'm trying to do whatever I can to
help the team." said Yount.
Yount was aided by junior first base
man Brent Milleville, the Cardinal's
hottest hitter over the past two weeks,
who drove in three of Stanford's four
runs and scored the final one. Milleville
doubled twice in the contest — in the
first inning, he scored junior Jason Cas
tro from first, and in the third, he drove
in junior Cord Phelps and senior Bren
dan Domaracki.
With a cushion from his offense,
Yount subsequently shut down the Tro
jans, preventing and working out of

trouble when needed. But almost all of
the outs were recorded by the defense
— Yount struck out only one batter —
which led the righthander to offer lofty
praise for his teammates.
"When guys make plays behind you,
it'll pick you up." he said.
Stanford's offense churned out nine
hits in the contest, but the four runs pro
duced were nothing extraordinary.
