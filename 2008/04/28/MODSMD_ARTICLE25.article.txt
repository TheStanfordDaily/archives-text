## All Stanford players go undrafted; Ostrander, Mattran signed quickly 
### 
At least two Stanford players
will be getting a shot at the next
level.
At the conclusion of this week
end's NFL Draft, quarterback T.C.
Ostrander and center Tim Mattran
were signed to free agent contracts.
Ostrander was signed by the
New Orleans Saints. He will be be
hind two-time Pro Bowler Drew
Brees, along with Mark Brunell and
Tyler Palko, who like Ostrander
was coached by Walt Harris while at
Pitt. Mattran signed with the Min
nesota Vikings, where he will com
pete with two other players for a
backup spot behind regular All-Pro
Matt Birk.
Reached by phone Sunday night,
Ostrander told the Daily, "I'm look
ing forward to the opportunity; all I
was looking for was the opportunity
to get a chance. I've gotten that

chance — I like New Orleans and
the situation."
Ostrander said he spoke with
Saints head coach Sean Payton dur
ing the draft, who told him they were
considering signing him as a free
agent if he went undrafted. "He
wanted to let me know what the situ
ation was. He said you'll have a
chance to come in here and com
pete."
Remaining Stanford players with
hopes of playing in the pros include
wide receivers Mark Bradford —
thought to be the most promising
player in the Stanford contingent —
and Evan Moore, punter Jay Ottove
gio, cornerback Nick Sanchez and
defensive end Udeme Udofia.
Many top-ranked undrafted free
agents, such as Bradford and Moore,
will wait days to sign their contracts,
as they will entertain offers from var
ious teams.
