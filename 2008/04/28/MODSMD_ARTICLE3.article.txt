## Residences rewarded for saving energy Jenkins wins Conservation Cup for using less water, electricity 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ITie benefits of hotly contested low
flow showerheads were finally revealed.
Students and administrators highlighted
year-long efforts to improve energy effi
ciency and sustainability in residences in
the annual dorm Conservation Cup.
The Cup is a new name for the compe
tition known from 2005 through 2007 as
the Energy Bowl & Water Derby. The Cup
involves 55 residences on campus, and it
aims to improve energy usage in dormito
ries through friendly competition. Thirteen
residences that reduced their energy and
water use by at least 10 percent from last
year were declared the winners. Jenkins
took first place with a 19.7 percent reduc
tion, followed by Theta Delta Chi at 18.0
percent and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk at 17.8
percent.
Student Housing Sustainability
Coordinator Nik Kaestner also announced
that organizers "are recognizing Columbae
and Robinson with the first ever
Conservation Cup Trophy to reward them
for their efforts to conserve natural
resources." While the two residences did
not improve by as high a percentage as the
winners, the two dorms distinguished
themselves as the best overall house and
dorm for energy usage, respectively.
Columbae costs 55 cents per day per stu
dent in terms of energy usage, while
Robinson costs 45 cents per day.
The Cup was coordinated through the
joint efforts of Housing and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford, including the latter's
Green Living Council, a residentially
focused program founded this year to
"promote sustainability and environmen
tal responsibility among Stanford stu
dents."
"It's pretty much necessary to coordi
nate in order to do things like this," said
Kevan Christensen '10, co-president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford and
Green Living Council program leader.
"But it comes also from similar desires to
be an environmentally healthy and sustain
able campus."
The Cup played a lead role in an over
all decrease in campus energy usage,
according to Kaestner.
"Overall, we saved 8 percent in water
