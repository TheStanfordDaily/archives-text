## Residences rewarded for saving energy Jenkins wins Conservation Cup for using less water, electricity 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ITie benefits of hotly contested low
flow showerheads were finally revealed.
Students and administrators highlighted
year-long efforts to improve energy effi
ciency and sustainability in residences in
the annual dorm Conservation Cup.
The Cup is a new name for the compe
tition known from 2005 through 2007 as
the Energy Bowl & Water Derby. The Cup
involves 55 residences on campus, and it
aims to improve energy usage in dormito
ries through friendly competition. Thirteen
residences that reduced their energy and
water use by at least 10 percent from last
year were declared the winners. Jenkins
took first place with a 19.7 percent reduc
tion, followed by Theta Delta Chi at 18.0
percent and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk at 17.8
percent.
Student Housing Sustainability
Coordinator Nik Kaestner also announced
that organizers "are recognizing Columbae
and Robinson with the first ever
Conservation Cup Trophy to reward them
for their efforts to conserve natural
resources." While the two residences did
not improve by as high a percentage as the
winners, the two dorms distinguished
themselves as the best overall house and
dorm for energy usage, respectively.
Columbae costs 55 cents per day per stu
dent in terms of energy usage, while
Robinson costs 45 cents per day.
The Cup was coordinated through the
joint efforts of Housing and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford, including the latter's
Green Living Council, a residentially
focused program founded this year to
"promote sustainability and environmen
tal responsibility among Stanford stu
dents."
"It's pretty much necessary to coordi
nate in order to do things like this," said
Kevan Christensen '10, co-president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford and
Green Living Council program leader.
"But it comes also from similar desires to
be an environmentally healthy and sustain
able campus."
The Cup played a lead role in an over
all decrease in campus energy usage,
according to Kaestner.
"Overall, we saved 8 percent in water
use and 5 percent in electricity use
as a result of the conservation cup
and shower heads," Kaestner said.
"We saved an additional 5 percent
from the toilet retrofit at GovCo
last summer. Only a handful of resi
dences had their usage rise, so we
are very happy with the results."
Housing administrators were
also pleased with the attention paid

in many residences to the conserva
tion efforts.
"In general, I've seen a lot of
prompts to turn off lights and
faucets and signs encouraging stu
dents to conserve energy and take
shorter showers," Kaestner said.
"Many residences had graphs show
ing their status every week."
Both students and administrators
pointed to a combination of factors
in decreasing energy usage, as nei
ther infrastructure improvements
nor changes in behavior can work
effectively without the other.
"Infrastructure can make a big

ger difference in one fell swoop,"
Kaestner said. "If you replace the
heating system in a dorm, for exam
ple. But infrastructure efforts can
also be negated by behavior, such as
when you install a more efficient air
conditioner but residents leave the
windows open."
"There are barriers to behavior,"
Christensen added. "Students can't
control the heating. But they can
take shorter showers and turn off
lights. There's a lot that can be
done."
Coordinators noted that the
competition has also made dramatic
improvements harder to accom
plish.
"Each year we do this, it becomes
harder to reduce by the same
amount," Christensen said.

With that in mind. Housing is
looking for new opportunities to
improve the infrastructure.
"We just conducted a lighting
audit to look for opportunities to
eliminate any remaining incandes-'
cent bulbs and are installing more
sensors this summer," Kaestner said.
"We are also having several heating
systems commissioned so they are
more sensitive to outside tempera
ture instead of heating full bore all
winter long."
"There's a common belief that
the low-hanging fruit is gone,"
Kaestner added. "But there's so
much to do, even in California, to
make buildings more efficient."
