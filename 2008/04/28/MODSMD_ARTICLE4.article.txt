# DAWKINS TAKES OVER
## Duke assistant hired as men's basketball coach 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has hired former Duke player and
assistant coach Johnny Dawkins as head coach
of the men's basketball team, the University
announced Saturday.
The 44-year-old Dawkins comes to the
Farm after 11 years at Duke, the past nine as
associate head coach to Mike Krzyzewski.The

former Ail-American lacks head coaching
experience but won out over two other final
ists with Stanford ties â€” current Cardinal
assistant and former Idaho State head coach
Doug Oliver and Portland head coach Eric
Reveno, a former Stanford player and assis
tant.
Dawkins replaces Pac-10 Coach of the Year
Trent Johnson, who took the head coaching
position at Louisiana State on April 10.
Dawkins will be formally introduced at a press
conference Monday.
"We are thrilled to welcome Johnny and his
family to Stanford," Athletic Director Boh
Bowlsby said. "His credentials as a player,
combined with his coaching experience gained

mentoring under a Hall of Fame coach at a
university such as Duke, made him a perfect fit
for Stanford."
Many speculated that the soft-spoken
Dawkins would be the eventual replacement
for krzyzewski. Both at Duke and the U.S.
Olympic team under Krzyzewski, Dawkins
was primarily responsible for player develop
ment, an important trait for a Stanford pro
gram faced with rigorous recruiting standards.
"'lTie philosophies of the two programs
both on the court and in the classroom are
very similar," Bowlsby said. "I am confident
Johnny s leadership skills, coaching ability and

at Duke University under Mike
Krzyzewski for 1 1 years, will replace
Trent Johnson as the head coach for
the Stanford men's basketball team.
commitment to attract top-flight
student-athletes will be a driving
force in continuing Stanford's tra
dition of basketball excellence."
During his 11 years on the side
lines at Duke, the Blue Devils were
330-60, winning seven ACC
Tournament titles, six ACC regular
season championships and the
national championship in 2001.
Nine Duke players were drafted in
the NBA lottery, and four were
national players of the year.
Dawkins inherits a Stanford
team that reached the Sweet
Sixteen for the first time since 2001.
But the Cardinal's top scorers from
last season, seven-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, both declared for
the NBA draft. Stanford's strength
next season will likely be on the
perimeter, around seniors-to-be
Mitch Johnson, Anthony Goods
and Lawrence Hill.
Such a style would not mark a
major departure for Dawkins,
whose Duke teams in recent years
have played primarily around the
perimeter.
The terms of Dawkins's deal
were not announced, but his con
tract will likely be for four or five
years, worth around $600,000 a
year. Johnson, who was seeking a
five to six year contract extension
at Stanford, will make at least $1.2
million a year for five seasons at
LSU.with additional bonuses avail
able if the team meets certain per
formance and academic standards.
Dawkins is the second high pro
file hiring in as many years for
Bowlsby, who is making his mark
after becoming Stanford's Athletic-
Director in 2006. The first, head
football coach Jim Harbaugh, was
largely seen as a success after he
led the Cardinal to upset victories
over USC and Cal last season.
Like Harbaugh. Dawkins has
played professionally. He was the
tenth pick overall in the 1986 NBA
draft by San Antonio and played
nine seasons for the Spurs, 76ers
and Pistons. His NBA pedigree,
Stanford hopes, should be an asset
in the recruiting process.
His first test will be to retain
Stanford's 2008 recruiting class. He
received good news when Jarrett
Mann, a 6-5 swingman from New
Jersey, said Saturday that he would
honor his letter of intent to come to
Stanford.
"I think it was a good decision,"
Mann told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "I've heard he's devel
oped a lot of players like Luol
Deng and Jay Williams. This is defi
nitely a relief because I didn't
know which way [Stanford] was
headed."
But Miles Plumlee, a 6-9 for
ward from North Carolina, asked
to be released from his letter of
intent last week. It was not clear
whether Stanford has granted a
release, but Plumlee is expected to
be courted by several east coast
schools, including Duke.
