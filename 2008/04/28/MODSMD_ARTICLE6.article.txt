Dave Barry wrote a syndicated humor

The Daily interviewed Barry via email on Friday.
Emma lYotter (ET): At what age did you realize
you were funny? How did it happen?
Dave Barry (DB): I was eight years old, and it
was caused by atomic testing.
ET Has your sense of humor changed since col
lege? How?
DB: It has changed a great deal. When I was in
college, I made jokes about farting, boogers, etc.
Whereas now, as a mature adult, I make jokes
about... Okay, it actually hasn't changed.
Andrea Fuller (AF): How did you get hired as a

humor columnist? It's not exactly a treadmill
career.
I)B: I was an English major, which meant 1 had
no marketable skills. So I
got a job as a reporter at a small Pennsylvania
newspaper called — this is the actual name —
The Daily Local News. Whenever they let me, 1
wrote humor columns. 1 kept writing them on the
side while I held various other jobs, and finally
enough newspapers were printing them that I
could stop doing anything else. I still worry that
some day the Seriousness Police will knock on
my door and arrest me on charges of making a
living in a totally frivolous manner.
AF: What is your favorite column or book?
I)B: "Catch-22." Oh. wait, you mean book by
ME. 1 don't really have a
favorite. They're all pretty ridiculous.
ETi Outside of your career as an author and
humor columnist, is it difficult to be taken seri
ously?
I)B: It is difficult even INSIDE my career.
AF: I understand that the life of a humor colum
nist can be very strenuous, with all that heavy lift
ing of beer cans and those arduous treks to the
bathroom. Is that why you retired?
