## Q & A DAVE BARRY 
### ANDREA FULLER EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITORS 
Dave Barry wrote a syndicated humor
column for The Miami Herald from
1983 to 2005 and is the author of sev
eral dozen books. The Pulitzer Prize winner will
speak in Memorial Auditorium tonight at 7 p.m.
The Daily interviewed Barry via email on Friday.
Emma lYotter (ET): At what age did you realize
you were funny? How did it happen?
Dave Barry (DB): I was eight years old, and it
was caused by atomic testing.
ET Has your sense of humor changed since col
lege? How?
DB: It has changed a great deal. When I was in
college, I made jokes about farting, boogers, etc.
Whereas now, as a mature adult, I make jokes
about... Okay, it actually hasn't changed.
Andrea Fuller (AF): How did you get hired as a

humor columnist? It's not exactly a treadmill
career.
I)B: I was an English major, which meant 1 had
no marketable skills. So I
got a job as a reporter at a small Pennsylvania
newspaper called — this is the actual name —
The Daily Local News. Whenever they let me, 1
wrote humor columns. 1 kept writing them on the
side while I held various other jobs, and finally
enough newspapers were printing them that I
could stop doing anything else. I still worry that
some day the Seriousness Police will knock on
my door and arrest me on charges of making a
living in a totally frivolous manner.
AF: What is your favorite column or book?
I)B: "Catch-22." Oh. wait, you mean book by
ME. 1 don't really have a
favorite. They're all pretty ridiculous.
ETi Outside of your career as an author and
humor columnist, is it difficult to be taken seri
ously?
I)B: It is difficult even INSIDE my career.
AF: I understand that the life of a humor colum
nist can be very strenuous, with all that heavy lift
ing of beer cans and those arduous treks to the
bathroom. Is that why you retired?
DB: Yes. Now 1 spend pretty much
the entire day in the bathroom,
thereby eliminating the need to trek
there.
ET: I've been reading your column
since 1 learned how to read. In fact. I
distinctly recall learning how to read
specifically so that I could read your
column. I also read your book about
turning 40 before 1 turned ten. Do
you think the youth of America are
growing up too fast today? As a par
ent, would you prevent your child
from reading your work (or others')
until a particular age?
I)B: 1 don't think anybody should
read my books. BUY them, yes.
READ them, no.

AF: 1 low do you react to eager fans,
like people who send you articles
and ask you to try their catapults?
Also, would you consider signing
your name on my arm so 1 can have
it tattooed?
DB: 1 don't remember being asked
to try anybody's catapult, which is
fine with me because that's how dis
eases get transmitted. 1 have signed
numerous body parts, including fore
heads.
FT: You've been known to make
fun of politicians in the past. What's
your take on the current political
climate in Washington and in the
states yet to hold primaries? Is it
true that you're running for office
this year?
DB: I am running for president, and
[1] plan to bring my surging jugger
naut campaign to Stanford.
Everybody who comes to my talk
can be in mv cabinet.

AF: The Dave Barry for president t
shirt that I own only came in a size
XL. How do you recommend your
female supporters show the Barry
pride while remaining stylish?
I)B: 1 don't think it's possible to do
both of those things at the same time.
AF: Do you still have an auxiliary dog?
I)B: 1 am currently dog-less. The only
pets in our house, aside from giant
South Florida insects, are tropical
fish, which really aren't the same as
dogs. For one thing, they're much
smarter.
FT: My dorm uses low-flow toilets.
What's the big deal? What are your
thoughts on low-flow showerheads?
DB: I favor the death penalty.
