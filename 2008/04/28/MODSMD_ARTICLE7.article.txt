# Stanford prepares for earthquakes
## California to get major quake within 30 years, expats say 
### RYAN MAC 
The 5.6 magnitude earthquake that
shook Stanford in the fall of 2007 may
only be a taste of what's to come,
according to a recent U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) study.
In the report released this month,
geologists announced predictions that
all but guaranteed the occurrence of a
major earthquake in California within
the next 30 years.
The report, which places a ( )9 percent
probability of a 6.7 magnitude quake
occurring along some major fault line in
California, confirmed earlier predictions
and placed more accurate probabilities
on seismic activity within certain areas
of the state.
For California's major metropolitan
areas these numbers provide a reason
for concern.
"The probability of a magnitude 6.7
or larger earthquake over the next 30
years striking the greater Los Angeles
Area is 67 percent," according to an
Apr. 14 press release from the USGS.
"In the San Francisco Bay Area it is 63
percent."
Stanford Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82 said he believed that the

University
has taken the
right measures
and developed a

feasible plan to prepare for the worst.
"We are constantly assessing our
earthquake preparedness, both in terms
of building safety and in terms of
response planning," Etchemendy said.
"We maintain stocks of emergency food
and water on campus for use during an
earthquake or other emergency.
Recently, we decided to increase those
stocks by about 60 percent, for added
safety."
Etchemendy also noted that
Stanford has a thorough building
review policy that is constantly being
reevaluated to ensure that buildings are
up to safety standards. Citing the prece
dent set after the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake that shook the Bay Area, he
stated that many buildings have been
reinforced to protect from major dam
age.
"Every building that posed a life-

The Stanford
Daily
safety hazard to its occupants has
now been seismically retrofitted —
or. in some cases like the Old
Chemistry building, closed," the
Provost said.
Such strict earthquake regulations
are the reason behind Meyer
Library's demolishment by the year
2012.
"Our concern about Meyer
library has more to do with its exter
nal safety than with the safety of its
occupants," Etchemendy said. "We
feel that the tile roof overhangs are
a potential risk. Since the remedies
for this would be both extraordinar
ily expensive and unsightly, we have
decided Meyer should be demol
ished."
Still, even building safety cannot
completely prevent the destruction
by a potential earthquake.
"In a severe earthquake, many
buildings on campus would suffer
damage — that's inevitable. But we
do not believe there are anv that

would experience a serious structur
al failure," Etchemendy stressed.
"One can never reduce earthquake
hazards to zero."
Geophysics Professor Greg
Beroza stated that regardless of the
exact probabilities forecast by the
study, anyone in the areas men
tioned would be wise to heed these
warnings.
"It's difficult to assess accuracy in
something like this," Beroza said in
an email to The Daily. "The bottom
line is that living in either place, you
had better be prepared for a large
earthquake."
Sandwiched between two major
fault lines, the Northern San
Andreas and the Hayward faults,
Stanford remains at risk for seismic
activity more violent than the fall
2007 quake. Though Stanford is not
located in one of the most likely
regions for a quake, the figures still
place this campus at risk.
"The fault that is thought most
likely to rupture in the San
Francisco Bay Area is the Hayward
fault (31 percent chance over the
next 30 years), which last ruptured
in a big earthquake in 1868," Beroza
wrote. "The San Andreas Fault is

closer to Stanford, but it had a great
deal of slip in 1906 and is thought to
be less likely to be ready to rupture
again. The report indicates a 21 per
cent chance for the northern San
Andreas over the next 30 years."
Ron Pomper '11, whose family
experienced the magnitude 5.2
Illinois earthquake two weeks ago,
voiced his concern regarding the
University's lack of emphasis on
what the individual should do in
case of such a disaster.
"I don't think we're that pre
pared because we haven't really
done anything to prepare," Pomper
said. "I feel that building safety and
regulations are stressed heavily by
campus authorities. [Regarding]
individual safety and preparations, 1
don't know if we would be ready for
such a large scale disaster."
