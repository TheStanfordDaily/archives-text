# Stanford prepares for earthquakes
## California to get major quake within 30 years, expats say 
### RYAN MAC 
The 5.6 magnitude earthquake that
shook Stanford in the fall of 2007 may
only be a taste of what's to come,
according to a recent U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) study.
In the report released this month,
geologists announced predictions that
all but guaranteed the occurrence of a
major earthquake in California within
the next 30 years.
The report, which places a ( )9 percent
probability of a 6.7 magnitude quake
occurring along some major fault line in
California, confirmed earlier predictions
and placed more accurate probabilities
on seismic activity within certain areas
of the state.
For California's major metropolitan
areas these numbers provide a reason
for concern.
"The probability of a magnitude 6.7
or larger earthquake over the next 30
years striking the greater Los Angeles
Area is 67 percent," according to an
Apr. 14 press release from the USGS.
"In the San Francisco Bay Area it is 63
percent."
Stanford Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. '82 said he believed that the

University
has taken the
right measures
and developed a

feasible plan to prepare for the worst.
"We are constantly assessing our
earthquake preparedness, both in terms
of building safety and in terms of
response planning," Etchemendy said.
"We maintain stocks of emergency food
and water on campus for use during an
earthquake or other emergency.
Recently, we decided to increase those
stocks by about 60 percent, for added
safety."
Etchemendy also noted that
Stanford has a thorough building
review policy that is constantly being
reevaluated to ensure that buildings are
up to safety standards. Citing the prece
dent set after the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake that shook the Bay Area, he
stated that many buildings have been
reinforced to protect from major dam
age.
"Every building that posed a life-
