## Study cites prevalence of hazing at colleges 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
As a new Sigma Nu pledge class ran
across the Meyer Library lobby in the
nude last Thursday, a gathered crowd of
bemused bystanders and sorority girls
gasped and giggled.
"They were clapping and cheering, and
a few had their hands over their mouths,
saying 'Oh my god,"' said Chris McCarty
'09, who witnessed the naked run.
The fraternal right of passage is noth
ing new. to Stanford or to universities
across America.
A study released last month by
University of Maine researchers surveyed
11,000 students from 53 schools about
hazing. According to the study, 74 percent
of varsity athletes and 73 percent of frater
nity and sorority members were hazed at
some point of their initiation into the team
or organization. Varsity teams and Greek
organizations were not the only groups
who hazed members, the study said, with
64 percent of club sport athletes and 56
percent of performing artists reporting
some kind of hazing during initiation.
Definitions of hazing vary among dif
ferent institutions. Stanford's official haz

ing policy is more specific than the
California Penal Code, which outlaws any
initiation activity that is likely to cause
bodily harm to any student. Violations
that do not result in injury are misde
meanors, according to California law,
while violations that do cause injury are
felonies.
On top of state law, Stanford expands its
own definition to include psychological
effects of hazing in its official policy.
"Hazing includes any activity ... that
causes or is reasonably likely to cause
another student to suffer bodily danger,
physical harm or significant personal
degradation or humiliation." according to
the Stanford Bulletin.
The University also adds a specific
corollary to include voluntary hazing.
"Consent, implied or expressed, is not a
defense to any complaint or charge alleg
ing a hazing violation," the policy reads.
Penalties for violating Stanford's policy
include loss of organizational recognition,
revocation of student activity eligibility
and even expulsion.
According to Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe, hazing at
Stanford is neither common nor
extreme when compared to practices
at other universities. Although reports
of hazing are not announced or made
public, Howe said that there are fewer
than two official reports of hazing in a
typical year.
Howe said hazing reports in the
past have included alcohol abuse,
sleep deprivation, intimidating situa
tions, but "nothing that is in and of
itself extraordinarily harmful."
She added that a number of past haz
ing violations have come from housed
fraternities.
"Most of the periods where we have
reports happen right after recruit

ment. which just ended," Howe said.
Howe was not aware of any inci
dents so far this year, though Ryan
Bethell '08, recruitment chair for the
Intra-Fraternity Council (IFC), jok
ingly dubbed the week "hell week."
At Stanford, members of fraterni
ties keep University hazing policy in
mind when planning initiation rituals,
but do not necessarily follow every
detail, according to Bethell.
"The spirit of the law is followed," he
said. "But as far as the actual letter, 1
would say that most fraternities don't
follow it. No one would join any of
these groups if they weren't tacitly
complying to take part of this ritual."
Hie Inter-Sorority Council and
Stanford Sierra Camp declined to
comment on this story.
Bethell and other members of
Greek organizations were hesitant to
tell The Daily specifically what their
initiation rituals include, not wanting

to ruin the surprise for new members.
"By [University] standards, yeah
hazing does go on," Bethell said. "It's
not something that any of us see as a
problem."
Bethell said that fraternities see
certain provisions as unnecessary. For
example, he said the University pro
hibits initiation rituals that involve
embarrassing clothing.
"We don't find that everything
prescribed [in the University's policy ]
necessarily would correlate with hurt
ing someone's mental well-being by
asking them to wear a costume." he
said. "A lot of times they design their
own costumes."
Bethell admitted that most frater
nity members are generally ignorant
of school policies.
"1 wouldn't say that most people in
the Greek system know what the pol
icy says,"he said.
Fraternities use a distinction between

mandatory and voluntary events to
avoid allegations of hazing.
"Fraternities, love it or hate it, want
their members to drink more,"
Bethell said. "But there are very limit
ed, if any, instances where new mem
bers are forced to drink. We never
make them do anything that they
don't necessarily enjoy doing. At no
point does someone say, 'you have to
do this.'"
For example, sending new pledges
on a trip to Reno is a common initia
tion practice by some fraternities, but
new members are not required to go.
Shared experience and bonding is
seen as an incentive to participate.
"Those who participate get to
know the people in their pledge class
better" Bethell said.
According to Bethell, the spring
Draw system is a limiting factor for
risky initiation rituals. Because frater
nities have to fill their houses, he said

it would be unwise to compel new
pledges to attend mandatory func
tions or do unappealing things.
Both Bethell and Howe also fin
gered Varsity sports teams as leading
perpetrators of hazing on campus,
although they do not fall under the
OSA's jurisdiction.
"A lot of student groups have ritu
als much closer to hazing than any
thing fraternities do," Bethell said.
1 lowe called hazing activities a vio
lation of the fundamental standard.
When asked about a potential gap
between University policy and actual
enforcement. Howe said she felt none
existed.
"1 don't see a double standard."
she said. "Ilie University has clear
expectations and expects people to
follow them."
