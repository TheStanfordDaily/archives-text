## Study cites prevalence of hazing at colleges 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
As a new Sigma Nu pledge class ran
across the Meyer Library lobby in the
nude last Thursday, a gathered crowd of
bemused bystanders and sorority girls
gasped and giggled.
"They were clapping and cheering, and
a few had their hands over their mouths,
saying 'Oh my god,"' said Chris McCarty
'09, who witnessed the naked run.

across America.
A study released last month by
University of Maine researchers surveyed
11,000 students from 53 schools about
hazing. According to the study, 74 percent
of varsity athletes and 73 percent of frater
nity and sorority members were hazed at
some point of their initiation into the team
or organization. Varsity teams and Greek
organizations were not the only groups
who hazed members, the study said, with
64 percent of club sport athletes and 56
percent of performing artists reporting
some kind of hazing during initiation.
Definitions of hazing vary among dif
ferent institutions. Stanford's official haz

ing policy is more specific than the
California Penal Code, which outlaws any
initiation activity that is likely to cause
bodily harm to any student. Violations
that do not result in injury are misde
meanors, according to California law,
while violations that do cause injury are
felonies.
On top of state law, Stanford expands its
own definition to include psychological
effects of hazing in its official policy.
"Hazing includes any activity ... that
causes or is reasonably likely to cause
another student to suffer bodily danger,
physical harm or significant personal
degradation or humiliation." according to
the Stanford Bulletin.
The University also adds a specific
corollary to include voluntary hazing.
"Consent, implied or expressed, is not a
defense to any complaint or charge alleg
ing a hazing violation," the policy reads.
Penalties for violating Stanford's policy
include loss of organizational recognition,
revocation of student activity eligibility
and even expulsion.
