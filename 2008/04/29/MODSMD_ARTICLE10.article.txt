Structured Liberal Education (SLE) is a one-year program
that combines residential and academic life and allows fresh
men to live and learn together. Academically rigorous, SLE
fills 28 units over the course of the year and is notorious for its
24-hour final during fall quarter. Students study classical liter
ature and religion, as well as philosophy from Greece, Israel
and India. In addition, the program explores the Renaissance,
the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, colonization,
capitalism, politics and social criticism. Participation in SLE
fulfills the Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) and Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) requirements.

Would you recommend SLE to a Pro Fro?
It depends on the person — it depends on what they're look
ing for from their freshman year. You have to he willing to ac
cept that it will take up a lot of your time and that you won't
get to meet a lot of people unless you go out of your way. Some
people enjoy it; some don't.
It's like a band-aid — if you want to get it all out in one
painful blow, then do it.
How does it affect your time at Stanford?
I don't necessarily regret my decision, but my freshman year
would've been totally different if I hadn't done it. I wouldn't
have made a different decision, though.
What did you dislike about it?
I'm not a humanities person — 1 plan on being a doctor. It's
not necessarily my kind of thing, but it was just a very practi
cal choice. It leaves me that space to get my work done.
Hiyabel Tewoldemedhin 11
Why SLE?
1 went to a small school, and I'm used to getting a lot of help
and personal attention. In a large IHUM class, I would feel
like 1 couldn't go to the professor and get help. In SLE, you
have that personal, first-name-basis relationship with profes
sors.

Would you suggest it to a Pro Fro?
I would ask them what they're interested in, and base my an
swer on that. SLE is not for everyone. For me, it was definite
ly a good choice; I don't regret it.

Best SLE memory?
After my third
paper fall quarter,
my section leader
told me I was be
ginning to write
SLE papers rather
than high school
papers. I finally had
the right idea.
What about those
24-hour exams?
I had a good eight
hours of sleep that
night. My first reac
tion when I saw the
prompts was panic,
but, after taking my
time and working
through them at a
steady pace. I even
tually got through

it. I think I prefer that kind of final to an in-class essay final.
Is it true that SLE kids do not have fun?
It's very amusing to hear the stereotypes. You really think all
we do is read all the time? Alondra is all frosh with SLE kids,
and they party all the time. I'm not personally offended by the
stereotypes. Not all SLE kids are the same. Some people do
enjoy discussing philosophy in their spare time. 1 personally
don't, and 1 do enjoy going out with my friends.
As an international student, how does it change the way you
look at Stanford?
There is a large percentage of international students. It brings
so many different backgrounds; you see the history of human
ity as you learn about it around you.

Rachel Cristy 10
Why SLE?
I looked at the curricula from a few years back during Admit
Weekend, and 1 liked the idea of reading a bunch of books that
were considered classics — the necessary components of an
education, things I had meant to read but had never actually
gotten around to. I talked to someone form my high school,
and he warned me that Stanford was not a very intellectual
place. People were smart but not necessarily eager to discuss
ideas and what they were learning at the dinner table. SLE is
this idea of an intellectual island.

Would you recom
mend it to a Pro Fro?
It depends on the
ProEro. You have to
know what you're
getting into. I would
n't universally rec
ommend it. My
roommate last year
hated SLE because
she didn't like phi
losophy. It has to be
someone [who likes]
having an environ
ment where people
you live with and
have classes with are
all the same. They
have to like the abil-

ity to commiserate and do without the separation of your ac
ademic and residential life.

Best SLE memory?
I really enjoyed section in spring quarter. Toward the end of
the year, it felt like all the ideas we were exposed to started
coming together.
5. What about those 24-hour exams?
It just comes with the territory. The commiseration with your
dorm mates is a lot better because you all have to do it togeth
er. It's fun to see people's antics during the SLE final. People
go crazy, but people go crazy together. It's kind of oppressive,
but it's all right because you're among friends.
How did it affect your time at Stanford?
It gave me a very good foundation. I find myself constantly re
ferring to things I read in SLE — a history of ideas I have a
grounding in. I feel like I have a big picture and view of this
Western intellectual history, and it really comes in handy for
giving me a background in other things and classes I want to
take.

Why SLE?
One of SLE's most
valuable characteris
tics is its breadth. In
three quarters, a stu
dent will have been
exposed to an im
pressive canon of
philosophical
thought. It's a helpful
foundation for a per
son with academic
plans of any sort,
since these texts con
vey human concerns
and themes that re
main relevant. SLE is
a credit to Stanford's
humanities offerings.
It is also compact,
since it covers
IHUM and PWR re
quirements in one
year. The residential
aspect guarantees

« r ~ ~
that students know each other outside the classroom, and
close-knit friendships often result.

Would you recommend it to a Profto?
Yes. Each student works one-on-one with an older Stanford
student, who tutors them as they write essays. This can help
students feel supported in a new academic environment.
Is it true SLE kids don't have fun?
The "anti-social" SLE stereotype is completely untrue. SLE
attracts people of all personality types who engage in numer
ous student groups and activities, including student govern
ment. SLE kids work hard, but they also have fun and enjoy
the community. SLE alumni can be found all over the Stan
ford social scene, including Row and Greek life. People who
avoid SLE kids because of an arbitrary stereotype are missing
out on a really dynamic, fun group of people.

How did it affect your time at Stanford after freshman year?
Academically, it was nice to be exempt from PWR my sopho
more year. Socially, I enjoy close friendships with people I met
in my SLE dorm freshman year. 1 have also enjoyed getting to
know current SLE frosh; in that sense, it's an ongoing commu
nity for me.
What did you dislike about it?
SLE involves a lot of late-afternoon and evening class time,
which makes some classes or activities unavailable to students
in the program.

Why SLE?
More than the curriculum itself, I really wanted to get a lot of
my requirements out of the way freshman year. Also, I had
heard that SLE forges a very close, tight-knit community, and
that is the kind of social environment that really appealed to
me as a freshman.
Would you recommend it to a Pro Fro?
I would definitely recommend SLE to a Pro Fro, and I don't
just say this because I am biased toward the program. Like all
other academic programs at Stanford, SLE has its pros and
cons. Knowing what I know now, if I had to go back in time and
decide between SLE and IHUM, I would pick SLE all over
again.The idea of exploring a broad range of texts rather than

a smaller range in more depth is just more intellectually stim
ulating. SLE's reading list is impressive, and just staring at the
collection on my bookshelf makes me feel very accomplished
(granted that 1 read maybe 60 percent of the texts on that list).
Also, contrary to popular opinion. I think SLE actually is less
work than IHUM and PWR put together. We like to call this
the best-kept secret at Stanford.
Best SLE memory?
Pulling an all-nighter for a Nietzsche and Marx paper with five
of my friends and acting completely ridiculous/delirious from
the lack of sleep. That's really the best part of SLE (and, no,
I'm not talking about sleep deprivation — that's probably a
function of my poor time management skills in life) — you re
ally end up creating life-long friends by sharing things you find
intellectually exciting and experiences that you wouldn't real
ly be able to have anywhere else. You eat, hang out with and
take classes with the same people, and this experience helps
you to form some very close bonds.
Worst SLE memory?
1 don't know if this counts as a memory, but I remember being
frustrated about not being able to take afternoon classes.
Is it true SLE kids don't have fun?
This one I actually find ridiculous. Every dorm has a mix of
people who like to go out and others who prefer staying in to
read or watch TV. I don't think SLE kids are particularly dif
ferent in that regard. Everyone on campus knows a SLE kid
and knows that SLE kids are actually physically capable of
having fun. I was in SLE, and 1 really enjoyed it. But I made
lots of friends outside SLE — I was at frat parties, I took a
Thanksgiving trip to Vegas with my non-SLE friends, joined a
dance team, etc. But there were weekends where I also stayed
in to talk to my friends, or maybe catch up on my Plato read
ing. All experiences for me have been fun, and shaped by Stan
ford experience in some way. The stereotype is unfair.
How did it affect your time at Stanford?
Academically, I think I am a much better writer because of
SLE. I'm pretty sure I can communicate complex ideas much
more effectively (and in a much more structured way) when
writing papers than I could at the start of freshman year. So
cially, some of my closest friends at Stanford were in SLE, and
we had an incredible freshman year experience together. I
don't think I could have made the same kind of close friends
had I lived in some other dorm back then.
How do you think it will affect your time after Stanford?
Writing and communication skills are critical in the real world
and are becoming increasingly important (and sought out) in
the professional arena. I have more confidence in my ability to
write and communicate, and these skills will serve me well
even beyond Stanford.

lots of friends outside SLE — I was at frat parties, I took a
Thanksgiving trip to Vegas with my non-SLE friends, joined a
dance team, etc. But there were weekends where I also stayed
in to talk to my friends, or maybe catch up on my Plato read
ing. All experiences for me have been fun, and shaped by Stan
ford experience in some way. The stereotype is unfair.
How did it affect your time at Stanford?
Academically, I think I am a much better writer because of
SLE. I'm pretty sure I can communicate complex ideas much
more effectively (and in a much more structured way) when
writing papers than I could at the start of freshman year. So
cially, some of my closest friends at Stanford were in SLE, and
we had an incredible freshman year experience together. I
don't think I could have made the same kind of close friends
had I lived in some other dorm back then.
How do you think it will affect your time after Stanford?
Writing and communication skills are critical in the real world
and are becoming increasingly important (and sought out) in
the professional arena. I have more confidence in my ability to
write and communicate, and these skills will serve me well
even beyond Stanford.

Structured Liberal Education (SLE) is a one-year program
that combines residential and academic life and allows fresh
men to live and learn together. Academically rigorous, SLE
fills 28 units over the course of the year and is notorious for its
24-hour final during fall quarter. Students study classical liter
ature and religion, as well as philosophy from Greece, Israel
and India. In addition, the program explores the Renaissance,
the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, colonization,
capitalism, politics and social criticism. Participation in SLE
fulfills the Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) and Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) requirements.
.adidi Garba II

Would you recommend SLE to a Pro Fro?
It depends on the person — it depends on what they're look
ing for from their freshman year. You have to he willing to ac
cept that it will take up a lot of your time and that you won't
get to meet a lot of people unless you go out of your way. Some
people enjoy it; some don't.
It's like a band-aid — if you want to get it all out in one
painful blow, then do it.
How does it affect your time at Stanford?
I don't necessarily regret my decision, but my freshman year
would've been totally different if I hadn't done it. I wouldn't
have made a different decision, though.
What did you dislike about it?
I'm not a humanities person — 1 plan on being a doctor. It's
not necessarily my kind of thing, but it was just a very practi
cal choice. It leaves me that space to get my work done.
Hiyabel Tewoldemedhin 11
Why SLE?
1 went to a small school, and I'm used to getting a lot of help
and personal attention. In a large IHUM class, I would feel
like 1 couldn't go to the professor and get help. In SLE, you
have that personal, first-name-basis relationship with profes
sors.

Would you suggest it to a Pro Fro?
I would ask them what they're interested in, and base my an
swer on that. SLE is not for everyone. For me, it was definite
ly a good choice; I don't regret it.

Best SLE memory?
After my third
paper fall quarter,
my section leader
told me I was be
ginning to write
SLE papers rather
than high school
papers. I finally had
the right idea.
What about those
24-hour exams?
I had a good eight
hours of sleep that
night. My first reac
tion when I saw the
prompts was panic,
but, after taking my
time and working
through them at a
steady pace. I even
tually got through

it. I think I prefer that kind of final to an in-class essay final.
Is it true that SLE kids do not have fun?
It's very amusing to hear the stereotypes. You really think all
we do is read all the time? Alondra is all frosh with SLE kids,
and they party all the time. I'm not personally offended by the
stereotypes. Not all SLE kids are the same. Some people do
enjoy discussing philosophy in their spare time. 1 personally
don't, and 1 do enjoy going out with my friends.
As an international student, how does it change the way you
look at Stanford?
There is a large percentage of international students. It brings
so many different backgrounds; you see the history of human
ity as you learn about it around you.

K
Rachel Cristy 10
Why SLE?
I looked at the curricula from a few years back during Admit
Weekend, and 1 liked the idea of reading a bunch of books that
were considered classics — the necessary components of an
education, things I had meant to read but had never actually
gotten around to. I talked to someone form my high school,
and he warned me that Stanford was not a very intellectual
place. People were smart but not necessarily eager to discuss
ideas and what they were learning at the dinner table. SLE is
this idea of an intellectual island.

Would you recom
mend it to a Pro Fro?
It depends on the
ProEro. You have to
know what you're
getting into. I would
n't universally rec
ommend it. My
roommate last year
hated SLE because
she didn't like phi
losophy. It has to be
someone [who likes]
having an environ
ment where people
you live with and
have classes with are
all the same. They
have to like the abil-

ity to commiserate and do without the separation of your ac
ademic and residential life.

Best SLE memory?
I really enjoyed section in spring quarter. Toward the end of
the year, it felt like all the ideas we were exposed to started
coming together.
5. What about those 24-hour exams?
It just comes with the territory. The commiseration with your
dorm mates is a lot better because you all have to do it togeth
er. It's fun to see people's antics during the SLE final. People
go crazy, but people go crazy together. It's kind of oppressive,
but it's all right because you're among friends.
How did it affect your time at Stanford?
It gave me a very good foundation. I find myself constantly re
ferring to things I read in SLE — a history of ideas I have a
grounding in. I feel like I have a big picture and view of this
Western intellectual history, and it really comes in handy for
giving me a background in other things and classes I want to
take.

Why SLE?
One of SLE's most
valuable characteris
tics is its breadth. In
three quarters, a stu
dent will have been
exposed to an im
pressive canon of
philosophical
thought. It's a helpful
foundation for a per
son with academic
plans of any sort,
since these texts con
vey human concerns
and themes that re
main relevant. SLE is
a credit to Stanford's
humanities offerings.
It is also compact,
since it covers
IHUM and PWR re
quirements in one
year. The residential
aspect guarantees

« r ~ ~
that students know each other outside the classroom, and
close-knit friendships often result.

Would you recommend it to a Profto?
Yes. Each student works one-on-one with an older Stanford
student, who tutors them as they write essays. This can help
students feel supported in a new academic environment.
Is it true SLE kids don't have fun?
The "anti-social" SLE stereotype is completely untrue. SLE
attracts people of all personality types who engage in numer
ous student groups and activities, including student govern
ment. SLE kids work hard, but they also have fun and enjoy
the community. SLE alumni can be found all over the Stan
ford social scene, including Row and Greek life. People who
avoid SLE kids because of an arbitrary stereotype are missing
out on a really dynamic, fun group of people.

How did it affect your time at Stanford after freshman year?
Academically, it was nice to be exempt from PWR my sopho
more year. Socially, I enjoy close friendships with people I met
in my SLE dorm freshman year. 1 have also enjoyed getting to
know current SLE frosh; in that sense, it's an ongoing commu
nity for me.
What did you dislike about it?
SLE involves a lot of late-afternoon and evening class time,
which makes some classes or activities unavailable to students
in the program.

Rahul Shaikh '08
(corresponded with The Daily via email)
Why SLE?
More than the curriculum itself, I really wanted to get a lot of
my requirements out of the way freshman year. Also, I had
heard that SLE forges a very close, tight-knit community, and
that is the kind of social environment that really appealed to
me as a freshman.
Would you recommend it to a Pro Fro?
I would definitely recommend SLE to a Pro Fro, and I don't
just say this because I am biased toward the program. Like all
other academic programs at Stanford, SLE has its pros and
cons. Knowing what I know now, if I had to go back in time and
decide between SLE and IHUM, I would pick SLE all over
again.The idea of exploring a broad range of texts rather than

a smaller range in more depth is just more intellectually stim
ulating. SLE's reading list is impressive, and just staring at the
collection on my bookshelf makes me feel very accomplished
(granted that 1 read maybe 60 percent of the texts on that list).
Also, contrary to popular opinion. I think SLE actually is less
work than IHUM and PWR put together. We like to call this
the best-kept secret at Stanford.
Best SLE memory?
Pulling an all-nighter for a Nietzsche and Marx paper with five
of my friends and acting completely ridiculous/delirious from
the lack of sleep. That's really the best part of SLE (and, no,
I'm not talking about sleep deprivation — that's probably a
function of my poor time management skills in life) — you re
ally end up creating life-long friends by sharing things you find
intellectually exciting and experiences that you wouldn't real
ly be able to have anywhere else. You eat, hang out with and
take classes with the same people, and this experience helps
you to form some very close bonds.
Worst SLE memory?
1 don't know if this counts as a memory, but I remember being
frustrated about not being able to take afternoon classes.
Is it true SLE kids don't have fun?
This one I actually find ridiculous. Every dorm has a mix of
people who like to go out and others who prefer staying in to
read or watch TV. I don't think SLE kids are particularly dif
ferent in that regard. Everyone on campus knows a SLE kid
and knows that SLE kids are actually physically capable of
having fun. I was in SLE, and 1 really enjoyed it. But I made
lots of friends outside SLE — I was at frat parties, I took a
Thanksgiving trip to Vegas with my non-SLE friends, joined a

Best SLE memory?
Pulling an all-nighter for a Nietzsche and Marx paper with five
of my friends and acting completely ridiculous/delirious from
the lack of sleep. That's really the best part of SLE (and, no,
I'm not talking about sleep deprivation — that's probably a
function of my poor time management skills in life) — you re
ally end up creating life-long friends by sharing things you find
intellectually exciting and experiences that you wouldn't real
ly be able to have anywhere else. You eat, hang out with and
take classes with the same people, and this experience helps
you to form some very close bonds.
Worst SLE memory?
1 don't know if this counts as a memory, but I remember being
frustrated about not being able to take afternoon classes.
Is it true SLE kids don't have fun?
This one I actually find ridiculous. Every dorm has a mix of
people who like to go out and others who prefer staying in to
read or watch TV. I don't think SLE kids are particularly dif
ferent in that regard. Everyone on campus knows a SLE kid
and knows that SLE kids are actually physically capable of
having fun. I was in SLE, and 1 really enjoyed it. But I made
lots of friends outside SLE — I was at frat parties, I took a
Thanksgiving trip to Vegas with my non-SLE friends, joined a
dance team, etc. But there were weekends where I also stayed
in to talk to my friends, or maybe catch up on my Plato read
ing. All experiences for me have been fun, and shaped by Stan
ford experience in some way. The stereotype is unfair.
How did it affect your time at Stanford?
Academically, I think I am a much better writer because of
SLE. I'm pretty sure I can communicate complex ideas much
more effectively (and in a much more structured way) when
writing papers than I could at the start of freshman year. So
cially, some of my closest friends at Stanford were in SLE, and
we had an incredible freshman year experience together. I
don't think I could have made the same kind of close friends
had I lived in some other dorm back then.
How do you think it will affect your time after Stanford?
Writing and communication skills are critical in the real world
and are becoming increasingly important (and sought out) in
the professional arena. I have more confidence in my ability to
write and communicate, and these skills will serve me well
even beyond Stanford.
