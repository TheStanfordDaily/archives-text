INDIO, Calif. (AP) â€” Sean Penn spoke at the
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Sunday,
urging the young crowd to involve themselves politi
cally
The Oscar-winning actor, a late addition to the
music festival, joking referred to his out-of-place
billing among the 125-plus performers.
Wearing a T-shirt and jeans and smoking a ciga
rette while he sat on a stool, Penn said he unfortu
nately couldn't perform his "a cappella Celine Dion
cover act" since he had "compromised his upper reg
ister."
Instead. Penn urged festival-goers to join him on
his "Dirty Hands Caravan," a biodiesel cross-country
bus trip he plans to launch Monday, arriving in New
Orleans 011 May 4. The purpose of the trip, which he
hopes 300 will join, is to encourage young people to
be more politically and environmentally involved.
" Hie government can't do it," Penn said. "They
can't save this thing."
