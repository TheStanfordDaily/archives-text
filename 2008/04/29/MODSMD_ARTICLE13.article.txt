Stanford researchers create stem
cells
A team of Stanford researchers in the School of
Medicine has successfully transformed normal skin cells
into cancer stem cells. The advancement will aid in can
cer research as cancer stem cells are believed to be vehi
cles for all forms of cancer.
The work, led by Howard Chang, assistant professor
of dermatology, was published in Cell Stem Cell on
April 10.
The researchers have also discovered that cancer
stem cells are more like the stem cells found in embryos
— ones that can develop into any type of cell — as
opposed to adult stem cells. They believe this piece of
the puzzle may be key in determining how normal cells
transform into cancer cells.

Stanford's Paul Milgrom was announced as the win
ner of Northwestern University's 2008 Nemmers Prize
in economics. Milgrom, who is a professor in the
Economics department, will be awarded a $150,000
stipend for his win.
According to TTie Chronicle of Higher Education.
Milgrom is being recognized for "contributions dramat
ically expanding the understanding of the role of infor
mation and incentives in a variety of settings, including
auctions, the theory of the firm, and oligopolistic mar
kets."
Milgrom won one of two Nemmers prizes; the other
prize is awarded in mathematics and was given to Simon
Donaldson of Imperial College.
