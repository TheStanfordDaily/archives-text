## Middle school program preps kids for college 
### MARK PRATT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Most students at Mildred
Avenue Middle School come from low-income,
minority families and have parents who didn't go
to college. Many don't speak English at home
and have no plans to attend college.
Which is exactly why officials decided to make
it the only middle school in Boston with a full
time college counseling office. They want to con
vince the school's 560 students that college is
attainable.
Middle school offices specifically dedicated to
college guidance are part of a growing trend at
schools across the country as officials try to make
sure students don't begin planning too late.
"Middle school is when students are still open
to all the opportunities and options they have,
because by the time they get to high school they
are often at the point where they say 'Oh. I can't
do that.'" said Jill Cook, assistant director of the
American School Counselor Association.
Getting to students early is especially impor
tant in a time when many elite schools are either
increasing financial aid or eliminating loans for
low-income students, said Bill Fitzsimmons,
Harvard University's dean of admissions.
The Mildred Avenue program, funded in part
by a Gear Up grant from the Department of
Education and managed by TERI, a nonprofit
group that helps students plan and pay for col
lege, is one of seven middle school college-guid
ance programs in the state.
All serve largely low-income students, who
are statistically less likely to attend college.
About 31 percent of low-income, college-age stu
dents enroll, compared to 75 percent of high
income students, according to the Washington
D.C.-based Pell Institute, which promotes better
college access.
Gear Up - which stands for Gaining Early
Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate
Programs - has been successful is setting up coun
seling offices in middle schools and high schools
across the country, said Diane Jones, assistant
secretary for postsecondary education. More
than 55 percent of students involved in Gear Up
programs enrolled in college within a year of
graduation, she said.
Rashad Cope and Jeanna Murat, who run the
college guidance office at Mildred Avenue, focus
on different ideas for different grade levels.
Seventh-graders learn about types of colleges -
junior, undergraduate and graduate - and how
much schooling they would need
for different careers.
One student, Shante Maddix,
looked flabbergasted recently
when Murat told her she would
need at least four years of college,
followed by another three years of
law school, to become a judge. That
estimate didn't include the time it
would take to be elected or
appointed.
Still, Shante wasn't discouraged.
"1 was kind of surprised by how
long it would take, but it hasn't
made me change my mind," she
said. "It doesn't matter what I have
to do."
In eighth grade, students learn
about how they can finance their

education, about dorm life and how
to manage money and time.
They make campus visits to col
leges in the Boston area and even
one out-of-state visit this spring,
scheduled for Rutgers University
in New Jersey.
Cope, who grew up in Boston,
attended Boston public schools,
and went on to Fitchburg State
College, tracks students when they
get to high school to make sure
they are taking the right classes
and performing well.
Eighth-grader Larisa Osorio is
among the students who has taken
full advantage of the help the pro
gram offers. Her study skills have
improved, her grades are up. and
she's focused on what she needs to
do academically to attain her goal
of owning a health spa.
"I learned that I have to take
health classes, learn about anatomy
[and] the nervous system."
