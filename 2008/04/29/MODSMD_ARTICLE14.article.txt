BOSTON (AP) â€” Most students at Mildred
Avenue Middle School come from low-income,
minority families and have parents who didn't go
to college. Many don't speak English at home
and have no plans to attend college.
Which is exactly why officials decided to make
it the only middle school in Boston with a full
time college counseling office. They want to con
vince the school's 560 students that college is
attainable.
Middle school offices specifically dedicated to
college guidance are part of a growing trend at
schools across the country as officials try to make
sure students don't begin planning too late.
"Middle school is when students are still open

Harvard University's dean of admissions.
The Mildred Avenue program, funded in part
by a Gear Up grant from the Department of
Education and managed by TERI, a nonprofit
group that helps students plan and pay for col

All serve largely low-income students, who
are statistically less likely to attend college.
About 31 percent of low-income, college-age stu
dents enroll, compared to 75 percent of high
income students, according to the Washington
D.C.-based Pell Institute, which promotes better
college access.
Gear Up - which stands for Gaining Early
Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate
Programs - has been successful is setting up coun

across the country, said Diane Jones, assistant
secretary for postsecondary education. More
than 55 percent of students involved in Gear Up
programs enrolled in college within a year of
graduation, she said.
Rashad Cope and Jeanna Murat, who run the
college guidance office at Mildred Avenue, focus
on different ideas for different grade levels.
Seventh-graders learn about types of colleges -
junior, undergraduate and graduate - and how
