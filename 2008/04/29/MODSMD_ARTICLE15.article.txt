## Sick Sad World No no no: I am not graduating 
### 
No, I am not graduating at the
end of this year. No, I am not
walking. And no, I don't feel
bad about it.To answer any and every
question that inevitably accompanies
these preliminary questions: No, no,
no. No.
"Do you feel like a failure?" No. 1
made a choice to dive in, swim hard
and explore every nook and cranny of
this University. 1 feel far more secure
in my decision than some other peo
ple 1 know, people who will be going
to top law schools next year, people
who will be working at top consulting
firms because they didn't know what
else to do with themselves. I feel far
more secure in my decision than some
other people 1 know who spent four
years drudging from one econ class to
another, hating every minute of their
undergraduate experience.
1 have majored in public policy.
German studies, urban studies, civil
and environmental engineering, in
terdisciplinary studies in the humani
ties and architectural design. After all
of that, 1 will be graduating with a BS
in science, technology and society
and a minor in German studies. After
tasting the bounty of every school at
Stanford, 1 am confident in my
choice. It would have been nice to
save some cash and figure out my
life's calling a bit sooner, but I'll grad
uate supremely passionate about my
area of study. How many people get
to say that?
"But isn't your family disappoint
ed?" No. 1 come from a great family
tradition of soul-searching path-find
ers. My father took eight years to
graduate from college. When he did,
he finished with a Masters, to boot.
He then went on to get the highest
grade in eight of his classes at the
Stanford School of Medicine (they
don't actually rank their students).
Today, 30 years later, my father still
loves medicine.
My brother took seven years to
graduate. But when he did. he was at
the top of his field of study. He is also
one of the most content and brilliant
people that I know — two qualities
that rarely go together. So. no. My
family isn't disappointed.They would
have been disappointed if I had cho
sen a major my freshman year, and
stayed blindly devoted to it for four
years.
"Don't you want to move on?"
No. From what is there to move on?
From Stanford? From the Bay Area?
There are people who think that
changing locations or jobs will
change their lives. I am not one of
those people. You change yourself.
There is nothing about going to grad
school or working at Yahoo! that in
herently alters who you are as a per
son. It is the experiences we accumu
late, the things we see and the people
we meet, tha'i challenge us to change.
A drastic shift in vocation or location
is one way for a person to confront
things within themselves. But the
funny thing about moving on is that
you are always you, regardless of
where you go or what you do.
The Stanford that I know today is
not the Stanford of my freshman
year. The fountains do not hold the
same allure, nor does a raucous game

I come from a
great family
tradition of
soul-searching
pathfinders.

of sloshball. My Stanford of today is
exciting because of the intellect and
innovation buzzing all around me.
And. yes, perhaps the occasional
rounding of the sloshball bases still
appears attractive on a fine Saturday
afternoon. But, in general, I have
moved on from my freshman year
self. And a change in location had
nothing to do with it.
"So, you think that everyone else
is a sucker?" No. I am envious of my
friends who have known their life
paths since they were 12. My fresh
man year roommate came to Stan
ford wanting to be a vet, and will be
going to vet school at Penn next year.
I feel only appreciative that I know
someone who found her life ambition
at an early age. The people who 1 do
not understand are the ones who re
fuse to look for something that makes
them happy, and instead settle for
something that might make them
money.
I understand the need to make
money — boy, do I understand the
need to make money. But life isn't a
zero-sum game where you're either
making profits or you're happy. My
mom needed a job when she graduat
ed, but she picked nursing because of
all the choices it offered her. She
could have been a teacher, a lawyer,
a...you get the point. Thirty years
later, she still works in healthcare.
And she also still stays up until 2am,
working in her office on projects that
she finds interesting. She describes
her job as "working in an intellectual
candy shop."
"So, you have all the answers,
huh?" No. Of course not. Just like
everyone else, 1 am not sure where I'll
be ten years from now or what Ill be
up to. But, I do know that when 1 look
back on my time at Stanford, I'll be
able to say, "1 did it right. I seized
every opportunity I could. 1 drank
from the fire hydrant that is Stanford,
and 1 held on until I had savored the
very last drop."
