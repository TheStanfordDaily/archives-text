## Am I in high school again? 
### 
Did you hear Jessie got into
UCSF med school? James is
going to Yale Law — of
course he would get in.
Spring is the time when blossoms
rain from the heavens along Mayfield
Ave., hikini-clad co-eds gratuitously
tan in public spaces, and showy shirt
less football players act overly macho.
It is also when "What are you doing
next year?" begins to bear the weight
of judgment and critique, future plans
are revealed, and once again top uni
versities become a brand of self
worth.
Cue flashback to senior year of
high school. As our four-year romp in
the LeLand-o-Plenty draws to a dra
matic close, it seems that 1 have
turned into Michael J., Marty McFly
ing myself fours years back to those
days of brown-paper-bagged text
books, jerky driving, acne, tsunami
soggy French kisses and free educa
tion. It truly seems as if I've gone back
to the future. We cram for standard
ized tests, puff up our resumes, apply
to school, and then judge our acquain
tances and friends by their stuffed (or
not-so-stuffed) mailboxes. We be
come acutely nostalgic about the im
pending dissemination of our friend
group, and persistently swear to make
the best out of this last month we have
together. From "make the best," our
vocabulary snowballs into one large
lexicon of entirely vague, romantic
abstractions: we leave "forever
changed," "ready to make a differ
ence," and "eagerly awaiting our next
journey."
We take buddy pictures for the
yearbook, donate to the class gift fund

and take the bus to senior formal.
Who knew I would end up nervously
asking someone to a dance,four years
after I thought the last one of my life
was out of the way? Soon, our families
will gather, we'll get weepy, hear gen
eralized truths from a moderately-fa
mous speaker about the subject of life
and possibly how we are the hope for
the future. It seems like I have done it
all before.
I am as sentimental as the next,
and there is no way I am not dancing
my little heart out at my (last?) for
mal,or donating my $20.07 to the class
of'o7. All these eerie similarities, how
ever, leave me to wonder — have
things changed at all? Rory, Dawson
and Screech all remained about the
same when Gilmore Girls, Dawson's
Creek and Saved by the Bell tackled
the college years. As this graduation
unexpectedly parallels the last one
more and more, it seems that, for
once.TV got it right. I,too, am trapped
in a too-long-running TV series — my
plot material has been recycled.
In so many ways things are about
the same as they were in high school:
I still wonder who this Katie Taylor is.
I am constantly stumbling upon and
redefining my interests. I assumed my
life-calling would naturally reveal it

self to me in a timely and obvious
fashion — one higher education later,
and 1 am still left wondering what in
fact I would like to do professionally.
Google? Grad school? Adventure?
What if I never find the one thing that
is meant for me? And are we so sure
there is only one?
Although, remarkably, 1 feel the
same sense of confusion about my
life, 1 still thought some things would
be different this time around. As col
lege graduation looms, however, I
can't help but get a potent sense of
deja vu. All the she-got-ins, he-got-ins
leave me to think we are just as pre
occupied with name recognition as
we naively were four years prior. Our
pre-grad obsession with post-grad
plans has slowly spiraled into a Ph.D-
M.D.-J.D. or bust creed that leaves
me anxious, heavy-hearted, and an
noyed. Jessie is not a genius because
she is going to UCSF. James isn't bril
liant because he got into Yale. They
are hard-working, dedicated, intelli
gent students for whom more school
ing was the right decision. College
was an obvious step for most of us,
but now, when there is no longer an
unambiguous path to take, labeling
our friends by their grad school both
oversimplifies their achievements
and falsely links their merit to their
post-grad plans.
In any case, all of these stories of
elite schools are strikingly similar to
gambling tales. You hear only about
Study McSmart's med school accept
ance, just as you only seem to hear
how much your old roommate won in
Vegas — no one mentions the multi
ple rejection letters or the net hun

dred dollar loss from playing slots in
the Luxor lobby.
I bet a vast majority of us will do
something intriguing, wonderful, and
important, whether we already have a
job lined up or a grad school waiting.
Until then. I'll try to reassure myself
things have in fact changed (including
myself) during my four year stay at
Stanford.
Oh. hey, 1 heard your mom is tak
ing us dress-shopping at the mall,what
time should 1 be ready?
