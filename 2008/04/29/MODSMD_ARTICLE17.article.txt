## Celebrating the spirit of volunteerism in Palo Alto 
### 
It is National Volunteer Week (April 27-May 3), a
time to recognize volunteers and celebrate the
spirit of volunteerism.
We all know a volunteer. Many of us are ourselves
volunteers. We know first-hand the selfless nature of
people who give with no expectation of being paid for
their time.
Volunteers do work for free, but volunteers will tell
you that they are well-paid. They contend that the re
ward for their work is not money but is, instead, the
satisfaction of helping others, active involvement in
the community and the friendships that form through
volunteer work.
The theme of National Volunteer Week is "Change
the World," and that is just what Red Cross volunteers
do. Without volunteers, the American Red Cross
could not complete its mission to provide relief to vic
tims of disasters and help people prevent, prepare for
and respond to emergencies.
At the Palo Alto Area chapter of the American
Red Cross, more than 250 volunteers help people af
fected by domestic and international disasters, teach
lifesaving skills and serve members of the military and
their families. On March 8 of this year, more than 300
community members were trained by volunteer in

structors in CPR and First Aid in Spanish. English and
Mandarin — for free. Last year, our Safe Ride pro
gram provided more than 570 free, completely confi
dential safe rides home to our local youth, by our
youth volunteers.The Red Cross "Be Prepared, Make
a Plan, Get a Kit" preparedness presentation has been
heard by more than 1000 community members, taught
by volunteers. Our Red Cross volunteers have re
sponded to nine local fires in the past year, and about
20 local volunteers have been deployed to support na
tional disasters, including the San Diego wild fires and
Pacific Northwest, Midwest and east coast floods.
The Palo Alto Area chapter welcomes volunteers
of all ages and skills — from seventh grade to 70-plus!
Right now, we especially need people who are inter
ested in teaching CPR in Spanish and English, can
provide data entry and special event support in our of
fice, be trained to lead emergency preparedness pre
sentations in our community and support our youth
programs, in particular Safe Ride and Safe Kids. To
volunteer, contact Margot Harrigan at
mharrigan@paarc.org.
