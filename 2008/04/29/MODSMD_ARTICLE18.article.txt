## Long ball beats Cardinal again 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR

peninsula to take on Santa Gara last night
for its third showdown with the Broncos
this year. 1 n its previous two games, the Car
dinal handled Santa Clara with ease, win
ning 3-1 and 13-6 on April 14 and 21, re
spectively. But this time around, it was the
Broncos who triumphed, downing Stan
ford 10-9 in a game that was televised na
tionally by CBS College Sports Network.
With the score tied at nine in the eighth
inning. Broncos first baseman Ryan Conan

count, putting Santa Clara ahead for good.
For the No. 3 Cardinal (25-14-2, 10-5

row — and came by the same score, no less.

its weekend series against USC, the Trojans
avoided the sweep in Sunday's series finale,
10-9. The Cardinal had not lost back-to
back games since April 9 and 11 against
UC-Davis and Oregon State, respectively.
Stanford went a remarkable 10-1 between
its losing streaks.
Santa Clara (26-16,7-5 West Coast Con
ference) was boosted by the tremendous
hitting of shortstop Jon Karcich, who bat
ted fifth to go 3-for-5 with a home run, four
RBls and a pair of runs scored to lead the
Broncos offensively. Conan and third base
man Gabe Alcantar also buoyed the Santa
Clara attack, as each belted a home run,
Conan scored three runs and Alcantar
drove in three.

Jason Castro also had a big night, going 3-

off solo shot which started the game.
Fearnow allowed a single to start the
inning but recorded a strikeout of left
fielder Evan Leßlanc just as the Car
dinal defense caught the runner steal
ing second. But after issuing a two-out
single and walk, Karcich burned Stan
ford with a three-run homer.
The Broncos offense recorded an
other big inning in the fifth against a
pair of Cardinal right-handers, sopho
more Cory Bannister and freshman
Michael Marshall. Bannister allowed
four runs, as Santa Clara set the table
with a leadoff walk and a single before
being helped by a fielding error by
Phelps to load the bases. A sacrifice fly
and Alcantar's home run brought the
runners home and caused Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess to make a call
to his bullpen once again.
Marshall allowed the Broncos to
bring one more run home, though, as a
two-out walk and stolen base put a
runner in scoring position for
Leßlanc, who singled to left to bring
Matt Long home.
Santa Clara's pitchers, meanwhile,
held the Cardinal offense largely in
check over the final four frames, as
Justin Kuehn and Mark Willinsky
combined for four scoreless innings
pitched.
The Cardinal has been victimized
by the long ball in each of its past two
losses, as it gave up three home runs
apiece to the Trojans and Broncos.
Previously, Stanford pitchers had al
lowed just 26 homers all season.
Stanford will hit the road again this

Wednesday as it takes on UC-Davis in
Davis, Calif., at 2:30 p.m. before facing
San Jose State in a home-and-home
two game set this weekend. Saturday's
game is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. at

peninsula to take on Santa Gara last night
for its third showdown with the Broncos
this year. 1 n its previous two games, the Car
dinal handled Santa Clara with ease, win
ning 3-1 and 13-6 on April 14 and 21, re

ford 10-9 in a game that was televised na
tionally by CBS College Sports Network.
With the score tied at nine in the eighth
inning. Broncos first baseman Ryan Conan

count, putting Santa Clara ahead for good.
For the No. 3 Cardinal (25-14-2, 10-5
Pac-10), the loss was the team's second in a
row — and came by the same score, no less.

its weekend series against USC, the Trojans
avoided the sweep in Sunday's series finale,
10-9. The Cardinal had not lost back-to
back games since April 9 and 11 against
UC-Davis and Oregon State, respectively.
Stanford went a remarkable 10-1 between
its losing streaks.
Santa Clara (26-16,7-5 West Coast Con
ference) was boosted by the tremendous
hitting of shortstop Jon Karcich, who bat
ted fifth to go 3-for-5 with a home run, four
RBls and a pair of runs scored to lead the
Broncos offensively. Conan and third base
man Gabe Alcantar also buoyed the Santa

GAME NOTES: The No. 3 Cardinal fell again by the
score of 10-9 last night, this time at the hands of
Santa Clara after losing to USC by the same score
on Sunday. Stanford pitchers allowed three home
runs in the game, and it was a Ryan Conan solo
shot to left that drove in what proved to be the
winning run for the Broncos in the eighth and sent
Stanford home with its second straight defeat.

most notably junior second baseman Cord
Phelps, who went 2-for-5 at the plate with a
home run and four RBIs. Junior catcher
Jason Castro also had a big night, going 3-
for-5 at the plate, while freshman third
baseman Colin Walsh went 2-for-3 with
three RBIs and drew a pair of walks.
Santa Clara jumped out to an early lead
in the bottom of the first inning, scoring
three runs in a two-out rally off of Stanford

off solo shot which started the game.
Fearnow allowed a single to start the
inning but recorded a strikeout of left
fielder Evan Leßlanc just as the Car
dinal defense caught the runner steal
ing second. But after issuing a two-out
single and walk, Karcich burned Stan
ford with a three-run homer.
The Broncos offense recorded an
other big inning in the fifth against a
pair of Cardinal right-handers, sopho
more Cory Bannister and freshman
Michael Marshall. Bannister allowed
four runs, as Santa Clara set the table
with a leadoff walk and a single before
being helped by a fielding error by
Phelps to load the bases. A sacrifice fly
and Alcantar's home run brought the
runners home and caused Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess to make a call
to his bullpen once again.
Marshall allowed the Broncos to
bring one more run home, though, as a
two-out walk and stolen base put a
runner in scoring position for
Leßlanc, who singled to left to bring
Matt Long home.
Santa Clara's pitchers, meanwhile,
held the Cardinal offense largely in
check over the final four frames, as
Justin Kuehn and Mark Willinsky
combined for four scoreless innings
pitched.
The Cardinal has been victimized
by the long ball in each of its past two
losses, as it gave up three home runs
apiece to the Trojans and Broncos.
Previously, Stanford pitchers had al
lowed just 26 homers all season.
Stanford will hit the road again this

Wednesday as it takes on UC-Davis in
Davis, Calif., at 2:30 p.m. before facing
San Jose State in a home-and-home
two game set this weekend. Saturday's
game is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
