## Long ball beats Cardinal again 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball traveled down the
peninsula to take on Santa Gara last night
for its third showdown with the Broncos
this year. 1 n its previous two games, the Car
dinal handled Santa Clara with ease, win
ning 3-1 and 13-6 on April 14 and 21, re

row â€” and came by the same score, no less.
After Stanford took the first two games of
its weekend series against USC, the Trojans

back games since April 9 and 11 against
UC-Davis and Oregon State, respectively.
Stanford went a remarkable 10-1 between

Broncos offensively. Conan and third base
man Gabe Alcantar also buoyed the Santa
Clara attack, as each belted a home run,
Conan scored three runs and Alcantar
drove in three.
