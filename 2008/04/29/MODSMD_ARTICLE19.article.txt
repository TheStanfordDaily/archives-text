## Stanford relay falls just short of Texas-sized upset Men's distance medley nearly tops defending champ Longhorns 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ilie weekend for the men and women's traek
and field teams was filled with numerous ups and
downs as seemingly successful situations often
turned into disappointment forthe Cardinal.The
men's distance medley relay (DMR) was a prime
example of this trend during the Penn Relays.
TTie relay team, consisting of junior Garrett
Heath, freshman Andrew Dargie and seniors
Michael Garcia and Russell Brown finished sec
ond to the world record-holding and national
championship winning team of Texas. Stanford's
time of 9:33.16 almost bested the Longhorns.
who finished the event with a time of 9:32.89.
And while such a close race run against such a
notably stellar team marks the Cardinal as a
force to be reckoned with, the runners did voice
their frustration.
"It was really disappointing," Dargie said.
"We all hate to lose, and we know we could have
beaten Texas. 1 think if we raced them again,clos
er to home, we could definitely win. Now the
focus shifts to our home meet this weekend, and
then Pac-10 championships."
Brown, the anchor on the relay, had a lot to say.
having fully analyzed and studied the race.
" Ihe Texas team is beyond just a good team." he
said. "They are the world record-holders, the defend
ing champions, and have been unequaled during their
time running together and only a few times in history'.
They will go down as either the best, or one of the best
groups of middle distance runners ever, and they de
serve all the credit they will get.
"That said, we went into this race expecting to
win," he continued. "The only other time our four
guys have matched up with those four guys was last
year at Indoor NCAAs. We beat them by a lot. and al
though we didn't beat them at their best, we felt like,
despite their numerous victories, head to head we
were the team to beat."
At the same meet, the Cardinal women's DMR
team of junior Alicia Follmar, junior IdaraOtu, fresh
man Madeline Duhon and senior Lauren Centrowitz
finished in third place with a time of 11:05.48. The
team boasts three All-Americans — Follmar, Otu
and Centrowitz — who were joined by the freshman
standout Duhon.
"I felt that we did well as a team," Otu said. "We
had new lineup since Nationals, and 1 believed every
one performed well. Special kudos should [go] to Ali
cia Follmar. who was tripped,spiked in the head [and]
bleeding for two laps but still managed to bring the
baton in third."
The rest of the Stanford team headed off to Cal to
compete at the Brutus Hamilton Invitational. While
the meet was not marked by any spectacular per
formances or exceedingly close races, the Cardinal
had several athletes achieve regional qualifying stan
dards and top finishes.
The Cardinal had a strong showing in the hammer
throw. Sophomore Jaynie Goodbody finished in third
place for the women with a regional qualifying mark
of 188-06, while senior Kyle Davis-Hammerquist
placed in third for the men with a regional qualifying
mark of 197-1. Senior Ben Dickens achieved another
notable finish in the field events by placing third in
the pole vault with a regional qualifying mark of 16-
6.75.
In the sprints, sophomore Griffin Matthew, re
turning from injury, placed third in the women's 1(H)-
meter dash with a time of 11.76 seconds, barely miss
ing the regional qualifying mark by one one-thou
sandth of a second. Also in the sprints, the men's
4xloo-meter relay finished in second while achieving
a regional mark with their time of 40.59 seconds.
While most of the top distance runners were away
at the Penn Relays, freshman Elliott Heath barely
missed the regional qualifying mark in the 1500 meter
run for the men, but still secured a third place finish
for Stanford.
Stanford will compete next at home at the Payton
Jordan Invitational on Sunday before heading oft to
Tempe. Ariz., for the Pac-10 Championships.
