### ANDREA FULLER MANAGING EDITOR 
The man The New York Times
has hailed as "the funniest man in
America" gave the packed crowd at
Memorial Auditorium some life
advice Monday night:
"Don't mess with the Hoosiers."
"This nation leads the world in
Wienermobiles."
"Whatever else you do, don't ask
the Oregon State Highway division
to help you."
Dave Barry — winner of the 1988
Pulitzer Prize for Commentary,
author of several dozen books and
retired syndicated columnist for The
Miami Herald — kept the crowd
laughing last night, even eliciting the
occasional hysterical shriek from the
back of the room.
"Before 1 came here, I did a lot of
poking around on the Internet," the
author said. "You know what I found
out? There's a lot of pornography on
the Internet."
Barry addressed subjects from
the current presidential campaigns
to his experience at a sewage lifting
station. At one point, following the
request of a fan during the conclud
ing question and answer session.
