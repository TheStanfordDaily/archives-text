## Dave Barry does Stanford Humorist tackles politics, Tupperware 
### ANDREA FULLER MANAGING EDITOR 
The man The New York Times
has hailed as "the funniest man in
America" gave the packed crowd at
Memorial Auditorium some life
advice Monday night:
"Don't mess with the Hoosiers."
"This nation leads the world in
Wienermobiles."
"Whatever else you do, don't ask
the Oregon State Highway division
to help you."
Dave Barry — winner of the 1988
Pulitzer Prize for Commentary,
author of several dozen books and
retired syndicated columnist for The
Miami Herald — kept the crowd
laughing last night, even eliciting the
occasional hysterical shriek from the
back of the room.
"Before 1 came here, I did a lot of
poking around on the Internet," the
author said. "You know what I found
out? There's a lot of pornography on
the Internet."
Barry addressed subjects from
the current presidential campaigns
to his experience at a sewage lifting
station. At one point, following the
request of a fan during the conclud
ing question and answer session.
Barry's brother joined him onstage
with a fellow band member for a song
about Tupperware.
"We've raised a lot of money for liter
acy. though we don't really do it for liter
acy." Barry said of his author-comprised
band. "We do it because it's fun."
The once hard-news reporter dis
cussed his experiences writing a column
over the years, from angry fans who
responded to his jabs at Indiana and
North Dakota, to his favorite column —
one about attempts to dispose of a dead
whale in Oregon — to his times driving
around a Wienermobile.
"If you don't learn anything else from
this speech, do not mess with North
Dakota." he said. "I got an angry letter
from everybody in the state. I got 115 let
ters."

Barry talked extensively about his life
in Miami, where he moved in 1986 "from
the United States." He took on Florida
drivers, noting that one 73-year-old
drove up a runway at the Miami
International Airport.
"They wouldn't let me enter a plane
with personal hygiene products" Barry
said. "This man got out there in a
Chevrolet Cobalt."
In a discourse on dogs, "the stupidest
form of life on earth," Barry targeted
beloved pet/superhero Lassie.
"[Timmy] would go out and fall into
the quicksand. Every week." he said.
"Who in the hell buys a farm with that
much quicksand?"
, Barry also took on hot-button issues
like how roller blade Barbie can set

underwear on fire, as well as contempo
rary politics.
On President Bush: "He seems to be
discovering what his policies are as he
reads them on the teleprompter."
On Vice President Cheney: "[Bush]
has a weird vice president who you don't
see that often, [except when] he comes
out and shoots a lawyer."
On John McCain (R-Ariz.):
"Strengths: he's a war hero ... The
weakness is that if he serves both terms,
he'll be 117 years old.
On the Democratic candidates: "They
hate each other the way two people can
only do when they agree on everything."
But the candidate Barry is really root
ing for? Himself.
"I'm running for president of the

United States," he said. "I'm a straight
shooter. 1 speak from the heart. 1 let the
chips fall where they may and many
other cliches. I agree with you."
Perhaps a centerpiece of his cam
paign?
"I favor the death penalty for whoev
er is responsible for making Americans
use low-flow toilets," he said. "We [once]
had toilets that could suck down a
mature sheep."
But he and A 1 Gore probably will not
get along on environmental issues if
Barry enters the White House.
"It's payback for hip-hop," the
humorist said of global warming.
