## Zito deals with Giant decline 
### 
As he nears the end of one of the
worst opening months ever for
a pitcher, the San Francisco Gi
ants' Barry Zito will head to the
bullpen. It's just the latest development
in the downward spiral of a man who
was once baseball's best young hurler.
Since inking the largest contract for
a pitcher ever at the end of the 2006 sea
son, Zito has gone a paltry 11-19, in
cluding 0-6 this year. According to The
San Francisco Chronicle, Zito is one of
only three pitchers in the last 52 years
to have that poor a start to his season.
It is a far cry from his heydays across
the Bay in Oakland, where he began his
MLB career.
Barry Zito burst onto the scene in
2000 as a mid-season call-up for the A's.
He appeared in just 14 games but was
so effective that he placed in the top six
in Rookie of the Year voting. He
helped the A's win their first division
title since 1992.
The next year, Zito only improved
and, at age 23, established himself as
baseball's newest phenom. His success
was particularly impressive because he
lacked a dominant fastball — his pitch
es rarely topped out at above 90 miles
per hour. However, he had a lethal
combination of off-speed pitches, in
cluding his renowned curveball, which
was practically unhittable. Batters
would swing hopelessly at balls that
started at eye level and ended up below
the waist.
Zito and teammates Tim Hudson
and Mark Mulder led a daunting Oak
land rotation that was comparable with
few others in baseball. Zito, though,
was the ace,and in 2001 .his first full sea
son in the majors, he placed in the top
10 in the American League in all the big
statistical categories — wins, strike
outs, ERA, and so on.
But his best was yet to come: in 2002,
Zito turned in one of the most domi
nant pitching seasons in the modern
era. He won the AL Cy Young Award,
as he compiled a phenomenal 23-5
record to go along with his 2.75 ERA
and 1.134 WHIP
In 2003, his win totals dropped off
due to poor run support, but he main
tained otherwise good numbers and
went to his second All-Star Game.
But it was all downhill from there.
Though just 26, Zito began to lose mo
mentum on his pitches, which didn't
have much to begin with. His 12-6
curveball, his best weapon, no longer
dropped as low — or as quickly — as it
had previously. Simply put, batters
started to figure the young ace out, and
he could no longer control games like
he used to. He had a hard time winning;
his ERA went over four; and his strike-
