## Zito deals with Giant decline 
### 
As he nears the end of one of the
worst opening months ever for
a pitcher, the San Francisco Gi
ants' Barry Zito will head to the
bullpen. It's just the latest development
in the downward spiral of a man who
was once baseball's best young hurler.
Since inking the largest contract for
a pitcher ever at the end of the 2006 sea
son, Zito has gone a paltry 11-19, in
cluding 0-6 this year. According to The
San Francisco Chronicle, Zito is one of
only three pitchers in the last 52 years
to have that poor a start to his season.
It is a far cry from his heydays across
the Bay in Oakland, where he began his
MLB career.
Barry Zito burst onto the scene in
2000 as a mid-season call-up for the A's.
He appeared in just 14 games but was
so effective that he placed in the top six
in Rookie of the Year voting. He
helped the A's win their first division
title since 1992.
The next year, Zito only improved
and, at age 23, established himself as
baseball's newest phenom. His success
was particularly impressive because he
lacked a dominant fastball — his pitch
es rarely topped out at above 90 miles
per hour. However, he had a lethal
combination of off-speed pitches, in
cluding his renowned curveball, which
was practically unhittable. Batters
would swing hopelessly at balls that
started at eye level and ended up below
the waist.
Zito and teammates Tim Hudson
and Mark Mulder led a daunting Oak
land rotation that was comparable with
few others in baseball. Zito, though,
was the ace,and in 2001 .his first full sea
son in the majors, he placed in the top
10 in the American League in all the big
statistical categories — wins, strike
outs, ERA, and so on.
But his best was yet to come: in 2002,
Zito turned in one of the most domi
nant pitching seasons in the modern
era. He won the AL Cy Young Award,
as he compiled a phenomenal 23-5
record to go along with his 2.75 ERA
and 1.134 WHIP
In 2003, his win totals dropped off
due to poor run support, but he main
tained otherwise good numbers and
went to his second All-Star Game.
But it was all downhill from there.
Though just 26, Zito began to lose mo
mentum on his pitches, which didn't
have much to begin with. His 12-6
curveball, his best weapon, no longer
dropped as low — or as quickly — as it
had previously. Simply put, batters
started to figure the young ace out, and
he could no longer control games like
he used to. He had a hard time winning;
his ERA went over four; and his strike-
out totals started falling.
The writing was on the wall: despite
a brilliant start, Zito simply did not
have the pitches to be a consistent,
overwhelming pitcher for his entire ca
reer. And there was the question of
whether his arm could last — since his
early twenties, he had thrown over 200
innings a year. He could still pitch, but
he no longer belonged at the top of the
rotation.
Zito had a bit of resurgence in 2006.
as he retooled his pitches fairly effec
tively. But his numbers were still a far
cry from those of old. Zito was becom
ing, at best, a slightly above-average
pitcher.
But that being said, he was still the
best hurler in an otherwise weak free
agent market that off season. Two
general managers in particular — the
New York Mets' Omar Minaya and
the Giants' Brian Sabean — made
hard pushes for Zito. When it seemed
that Minaya had the inside track to
ward landing Zito, the overzealous
Sabean gave the pitcher an offer he
couldn't refuse and Minaya couldn't
match: $126 million over seven years.
That's not just ace-worthy money.
That's best-pitcher-in-the-league
money. Zito wasn't close to either.
From the moment he donned a
Giants' uniform, Zito disappointed.
He was entirely inept in 2007, as he
turned in perhaps his worst profes
sional season.To top it off, he was fac
ing National League hitters, who. as a
whole, are undoubtedly worse than
the AL sluggers he used to face.
And, this year, he has hit rock bot
tom, and the Giants' management,
which entrusted the franchise's future
— financially and otherwise — in
him just a short while ago, has lost its
faith.
Instead of being the staff ace, he
has been the bane of a rotation that
featured talented youngsters like Tim
Lincecum and Matt Cain.
Instead of being the example for
the Giants' young guns.he's now a cau
tionary tale both to pitchers and GMs
alike of how a career could flame out
after such a promising beginning.
