## Dawkins formally introduced as Cardinal coach yesterday 
### 
Johnny Dawkins was officially ushered in
as the new head coach of the men's basketball
team during a 4 p.m. press conference held by
the athletic department yesterday.
Introduced by Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby, Dawkins seemed cool throughout
the conference, although he continually em
phasized his excitement at the opportunity to
be at the helm of the Stanford program.
"I'm really thankful for the opportunity
that has been presented to me by Stanford
University," Dawkins said. "To be at such an
elite program, athletically and academically,
couldn't be better... We're gonna do some
thing special here."
Bowlsby, impressed by Dawkins' pedigree
as a player and assistant at Duke — a program
many have compared to Stanford's in the past
due to the similar academic natures of the
schools — cited fit as the most important fac
tor in selecting the new Cardinal coach.
"Fit was even more important," Bowlsby
said. "As soon as we began visiting with coach
Dawkins, it became apparent he fit hand and
glove with Stanford University."
Dawkins was first contacted by the Univer
sity just last week, but was offered the job on
Friday. When asked how long it took him to ac
cept the position, Dawkins responded,"About
10 minutes," inciting a chorus of laughter
among those in attendance.
Overall, Dawkins seemed thrilled at the
prospect of joining the Stanford community,
both in the gym and on campus.
"I'm into people. I'm into what this univer
sity represents," he said. "You can see it in peo
ple's faces — how nice it is, how good of an ex
perience they're having. Stanford is Stanford.
It's one of the best universities in the world."

proven track record of free agents making
NFL rosters, and this year's crop will certainly
