sweep. The Hawks are headed back
to Beantown all tied up with the
mighty Celtics. Joe Johnson scored
35 points — 20 in the fourth quarter
— and Josh Smith added 28 points
and seven blocks for Atlanta, which
surprised the Celtics again 97-92 on
Monday night to even the best-of
seven series at two games apiece.

A Game 5 that many never ex
pected to happen is now on, Wednes
day night in Boston.
The Hawks, who had the worst
record (37-45) of any playoff team,
overcame two double-digit deficits
to beat a team that won an NBA
leading 66 games during the regular
season.
"It's time to shock the world," the
public address announcer screamed
at one point in the third quarter to
the sellout crowd of 20,016.
