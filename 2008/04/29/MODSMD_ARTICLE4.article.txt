# Task force looks at class size
## Student input low at town hall meetings to discuss freshman class expansion 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
In its continued effort to increase
dialogue and transparency, the task
force on undergraduate expansion
held two hour-long town-hall meet
ings Monday to discuss the prospect
of increasing the size of Stanford's
u ndergrad uate popula t i on.
The meetings — part of what the
task force is calling a formalized
spring outreach program — were
held in the Old Union Clubhouse
and were open to the public but fea
tured lower-than-expected turnouts.
Only one student attended the noon
meeting.
Chaired by Board of Trustees

member Jim Canales 'NX. M.A. '89
and Humanities and Sciences
Professor Ramon Saldivar. the task
force nonetheless posed a list of
questions to the students in atten
dance and took notes while ideas
were tossed around. The pair
stressed that dialogue about expan
sion remains in what Saldivar called
a "listening and questioning mode."
"'lTiis has always been intended
to be an exploration." Canales said.
"We are currently still in the out
reach phase."
Saldivar identified three spheres
of discussion regarding freshman
expansion to be touched upon with
in the larger campus dialogue — the
academic impact, the financial impact
and the impact on everyday student
life.
Shelley Gao "11. a newly elected
ASSU undergraduate senator and a
Daily staff member, voiced several
concerns to the task force during
yesterday's first meeting at noon.
The topics of her concerns ranged
from U.S. and international financial
aid. the size of the international stu
dent population, class sizes, faculty
accessibility, the housing crunch and
the University's reputation and pres
tige.
"1 really care about the image, rep
utation and global standing of my uni
versity," Gao said. "I know it doesn't
mean everything, but it really does
matter in terms of international appli
cants."
Gao also said she enjoys being
able to connect with fellow freshmen
and is worried a larger class may hin
der future freshmen from doing the
same.
Other student concerns expressed

at the second meeting included the
lack of sufficient mental and physical
health resources, which could be exac
erbated by a larger student popula
tion.
Patrick Cordova '09. an ASSU
undergraduate senator, cited suicides
in recent years as a reason to focus
mental health resources on current
students.
"We might not even have enough
resources right now," he said.
With regard to the changes in the
admission process that could follow
an expansion of the freshman class,
Hershey Avula '08, ASSU President
and student member of the task force,
said Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Richard Shaw had previously
addressed the task force, though Shaw
did not answer specific questions
regarding changes in admission.
Saldivar said students admitted to
a larger class could be "more of the
same," or better represent interna
tional students or demographics.
Jeff Wachtel. task force member
and Senior Assistant to President
Hennessy, said he is "confident that
[admission] selectivity would remain
at the highest level."
In the September/October issue of
Stanford Magazine, President John
Hennessy cited record application

numbers as the reason for beginning a
dialogue regarding freshman expan
sion.
"My primary' rationale for asking
this question is the dramatic growth in
the number of applicants — a signifi
cant fraction of whom are prepared to
do Stanford-caliber study," the
President wrote in his column.
Hennessy also said more freshmen
would result in increased interaction
and broader perspectives and experi
ences for Stanford students.
Still, Canales said he has met with
an overall disapproval of expansion.
"I sense in conversations with stu
dents that there's been a general pre
disposition against doing this," he
said.
Max Sosna-Spear '11 told the task
force that he feels he is one of few in
favor of expansion.
"I'm in favor of expanding the
freshman class, and 1 do feel like I'm
in the minority," he said.
The task force has created a Web
site for members of the Stanford com
munity to submit input on questions
regarding freshman expansion. The
site's URL is http://expansion.stan
ford.edu/.
