# STUDENT LIFE
## University urged to act on rising birth control prices 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
In light of Columbia University's recent
triumph in the battle against rising birth con
trol costs, Stanford Students for Choice are
leading campus efforts to follow suit. Co-
Presidents Kate Benham '09 and Meryl Holt
'09 held an informational session Friday
afternoon to discuss how recent legislation is
affecting Stanford students.

The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of
2005 was implemented in 2007 with the
intention of reducing student loan costs. As a
result, pharmaceutical companies lost gov
ernment subsidies that enabled them to pro
vide drugs to low-income and college health
clinics at a discounted rate.
"We started working on this issue because
we realized that this was happening and that
it was going to affect college students every
where," Benham said. "About 39 percent of

college students across the country use birth
control pills as their primary contraceptive
method."
On Tuesday of last week. Columbia's
Health Services announced that it would
reduce the price of birth control, taking the
Nuvaßing down from $40 to $20 and gener
ic brands down to $5.
Stanford's Vaden Health Center, in antic
ipation of the DRA, started stockpiling
"clinic packs" of oral contraceptives when

the act was announced. Vaden expects prices
to increase when the supply of these
reduced-price packs runs out.
"It was a really great deal," Benham said
of the reduced-price birth control, which will
continue to be offered at Vaden until the
stock has been depleted. "Everyone was eli
gible regardless of their insurance status by
just being a Stanford student."
Students with Cardinal Care will
not be affected by the DRA. For
students without Cardinal Care,
Vaden currently charges a flat fee
of $10 for generic brands, which
students pay each month out of
pocket. In the near future, the costs
will vary due to individual insur
ance plans and the type of pill.
"It could be anywhere from $25
to as much as $65 per pack,"
Benham said. "That's really prohib
itive for most people. Once [the
clinic packs] start running out, 1
think people are really going to
start feeling this crunch."
Holt agreed.
"I find it really ironic because
now we're seeing a situation where
a lot of women are having to

choose between buying birth con
trol — and having safe sex — and
buying school books," Holt said.
"And actually, all of the official
explanations say it was a mistake
and they didn't mean for the DRA
to increase the price of these
drugs."
Benham and Holt have created
a petition that has been circulated
around the student body, as well as
a preliminary survey for Stanford
women.
"There are some additional
issues that come along with this."
Holt said. "At the moment, you can
still buy generics for your original
co-pay, but the generic is not a per
fect substitute for what you were
taking before. A lot of women
experience side effects. Also,
there's been a noted increase in the
use of Plan B emergency contra
ception since this bill was enacted."
Benham. trained as a Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center
counselor, stated that Plan B was

nut a feasible substitute for regular
birth control.
"It's safe to take Plan B, but it's
not a viable alternative," she said.
"It causes unpleasant side effects
for many women, and as it's rela
tively new, long-term effects
haven't been widely studied."
Some college campuses have
already replaced their stock of
birth control with a stock of Plan B.
Benham and Holt hope to prevent
this from happening at Stanford by
presenting their petition to the
administration.
"We're going to make a presen
tation to the ASSIJ in the next cou
ple of weeks," Benham said.
"Hopefully with their collabora
tion, the petition and the survey
results, we'll take all of this to the
Vice Provost and the Dean of
Students and ask them if they can
subsidize this gap."
