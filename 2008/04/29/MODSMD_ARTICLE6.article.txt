# Card leads Pac after two
## No. 7 Stanford holds narrow lead after two rounds of Pac-10 play 
### ROXANNE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a grueling day of competition
with a stacked field of top teams. No. 7
Stanford men's golf came out on top
after two rounds of play at the Pac-10
Championships held at the Meadow
Club in Fairfax, Calif. Though the
Cardinal has a three-under par score of
707, it will not have an easy road
ahead, as the difference between first
and third place is only three strokes.
Coming in second for the day was
No. 49 California, which trails the
Cardinal by one stroke. No. 4 UCLA is
in third with a two-under score of 709,
No. 3 Southern California was fourth
with a two-over par 712 and Arizona
rounded out the top five at four-over
714.
No. 44 senior Rob Grube fired a
four-under par score of 138 on the day
to go into today's rounds in a four-way
tie for the top spot on the individual
ladder. Grube only improved as the
day went on yesterday, notching a one
under 70 and a three-under 68 for the
first two rounds of the tournament.
The individual competition is very
close: though Grube managed an
under par first round score, he was tied

GAME NOTES: The golf team currently stands in
first place at the Championships. The team
had four golfers in the top 20 of the leader
board: senior Rob Grube, freshman Steve
Ziegler, sophomore Jordan Cox and junior
Dodge Kemmer. The Roc-10 Championships
will be the Cardinal's last outing before it tries
to win its second straight national title.
for 21st at the time. Just two strokes
currently separate first from eighth
place.
"Rob's performance today just
shows his resilience," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "Rob has been very
sick and wasn't able to play in the prac
tice rounds. We thought it would be
best if he slept all day Sunday to rest
up for the first rounds. Quite often you
see that sick athletes perform very well
because they come out worried about
just getting one foot in front of the next

Californian and No. 4 UCLA, both within three strokes of the Card.
and not attaching a lot of expectations to the
round. He had a heck of a round going; he had
a sensational outing and really led the charge
for us, which is fitting for our senior captain."
Only one stroke behind Grube is freshman
Steve Ziegler. He has played consistently well
for the Cardinal as of late and posted a one
under par score of 70 for both of yesterday's
rounds. Ziegler has come alive late in the sea
son. posting two top-10 finishes in the team's
last two tournaments.
"Steve has really stepped up his game since
the first of the year," Ray said."He is more con
fident and is putting better. Everyone is excit-

Ed to see him play well. With Jsophomore]
Joseph Bramlett out. we needed someone to
step up, which is a lot to ask for in a freshman,
but he has risen to the occasion."
TVailing Ziegler by one is sophomore Jor
dan Cox. who earned himself a stake in the
five-way tie for 12th place. Cox got off to a
great start after recording a two-under 69 for
the first round and managed a one-over 72 for
the second. Junior Dodge Kcmmcr concluded
the day only one-over par but this put him in a
tie for 20th due to the high level of competi
tion. Ktfmmer putted his way to seven birdies
on the day.

Rounding out the Cardinal six are junior
Daniel Lim. who shot a five-over 147, and No.
10 freshman Sihwan Kim. who finished with a
seven-over 149.
"Everyone is playing well," Ray said.
"There are still two rounds left, though, and
everyone will have a chance to play their game.
Conditions are supposed to be tough [today],
but the guys feel good,so we will sec what hap
pens."
After storming back in the second round of
play yesterday, Stanford has put itself in as
good a position it could be in going into the
third and final rounds on lliesday and Wednes

day, the last before the NCAA tournament.
"It's about each individual guy handling his
own golf ball and playing the course, not the
guy next to him." Ray said. "We had a great
week of practice going into the tournament.
Hopefully, we are just starting to peak at the
right time and this is just a precursor for us as
we enter the post season. The guys have high
expectations. Though we are definitely not the
favorite, it's nice having some people to shoot
for."
