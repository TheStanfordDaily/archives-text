# Card leads Pac after two
## No. 7 Stanford holds narrow lead after two rounds of Pac-10 play 
### ROXANNE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a grueling day of competition
with a stacked field of top teams. No. 7
Stanford men's golf came out on top
after two rounds of play at the Pac-10
Championships held at the Meadow
Club in Fairfax, Calif. Though the
Cardinal has a three-under par score of
707, it will not have an easy road
ahead, as the difference between first
and third place is only three strokes.
Coming in second for the day was
No. 49 California, which trails the
Cardinal by one stroke. No. 4 UCLA is
in third with a two-under score of 709,
No. 3 Southern California was fourth
with a two-over par 712 and Arizona
rounded out the top five at four-over
714.
No. 44 senior Rob Grube fired a
four-under par score of 138 on the day
to go into today's rounds in a four-way
tie for the top spot on the individual
ladder. Grube only improved as the
day went on yesterday, notching a one
under 70 and a three-under 68 for the
first two rounds of the tournament.
The individual competition is very
close: though Grube managed an
under par first round score, he was tied

Ziegler, sophomore Jordan Cox and junior
Dodge Kemmer. The Roc-10 Championships
will be the Cardinal's last outing before it tries
to win its second straight national title.

currently separate first from eighth
place.
"Rob's performance today just
shows his resilience," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "Rob has been very
sick and wasn't able to play in the prac
tice rounds. We thought it would be
best if he slept all day Sunday to rest
up for the first rounds. Quite often you
see that sick athletes perform very well
because they come out worried about
just getting one foot in front of the next
