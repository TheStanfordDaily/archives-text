## City, University look to market Palo Alto Destination Palo Alto to bring tourists and money 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
The city of Palo Alto will invest
up to $24(),()(X) over the next two
years to improve upon Destination
Palo Alto, a homegrown market
ing project to promote the city
nationally and internationally. Hie
city will use the money to hire a
professional firm to take over the
project in hopes of attracting and
entertaining visitors to the area.
Destination Palo Alto was
spawned two years ago and is now
a collaboration of the city of Palo
Alto, the University, local business
groups, the Palo Alto Arts Center
and Palo Alto Weekly, among oth
ers. Since its inception, the project
has sponsored special events,
developed marketing

materials and worked to
encourage visitors to
spend more time-and
money-in the communi
ty.
The idea tor the joint
marketing initiative
between the city and the
University came from
Palo Alto city officials,
downtown merchants
and the city's Chamber
of Commerce, according
to Jean McCown, direc
tor of community rela
tions at Stanford.

"They contacted Stanford through
my office in order to get involved
in the initial open discussions."
McCown told The Daily.
"Destination Palo Alto started as a
brainstorming conversation about
what things could be done to
encourage visitors who come to
the city or Stanford to find more
activities around the community."
"The University is a large
attraction to the Palo Alto com
munity and, therefore, it is a logical
partner of Destination Palo Alto,"
said Susan Barnes, the city's man
ager of economic development.
Funding for the marketing proj
ect will be procured from hotel-tax
revenue-"transient occupancy
tax"-and city sales tax. Stanford
does not provide money to the
program but shares resources and
staff time, McCown said.
During Admit Weekend, the


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
University provided free shuttle
buses that took visiting parents to
downtown PA to promote the city.
"We funded the shuttle, and the
staff of the admissions office was
heavily involved in this. We have

also put a lot of staff time," McCown
said.
Past projects of Destination Palo
Alto have included co-hosting the
opening of the new Stanford foot
hall stadium. For that event, the
University created a communica
tions partnership with both Palo
Alto and Stanford's Athletic
Department.
"The University did not pay
money to Palo Alto, but provided

them with some added value by put
ting together a program and by pro
moting the football stadium,"
McCown said.
The recent Tour of California
bike race prologue was co-spon
sored by the University and
Destination Palo Alto as well.
How the formal marketing cam
paign will formalize is partially
dependent on which companies,
groups or people apply to the city's
request for proposals and what they
intend to do with the city's allocated
funds, Barnes said.
City staff expects to award the
contract to a professional firm in
July and formal operations should
start in the fall.
A professional marketing effort
could help bring more regional visi
tors to the area on a consistent basis
rather than the city's current
approach of sporadic, massive
events, Barnes said.
"For the past two years we have
been in a learning stage, but now we
are looking for experts in the field
who can come in. take over and tell
us what are Palo Alto's strengths
and weaknesses," Barnes added.
