## City, University look to market Palo Alto Destination Palo Alto to bring tourists and money 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
The city of Palo Alto will invest
up to $24(),()(X) over the next two
years to improve upon Destination
Palo Alto, a homegrown market
ing project to promote the city
nationally and internationally. Hie
city will use the money to hire a
professional firm to take over the
project in hopes of attracting and
entertaining visitors to the area.
Destination Palo Alto was
spawned two years ago and is now
a collaboration of the city of Palo
Alto, the University, local business
groups, the Palo Alto Arts Center
and Palo Alto Weekly, among oth
ers. Since its inception, the project
has sponsored special events,
developed marketing

materials and worked to
encourage visitors to
spend more time-and
money-in the communi
ty.
The idea tor the joint
marketing initiative
between the city and the
University came from
Palo Alto city officials,
downtown merchants
and the city's Chamber
of Commerce, according
to Jean McCown, direc
tor of community rela
tions at Stanford.

"They contacted Stanford through
my office in order to get involved
in the initial open discussions."
McCown told The Daily.
"Destination Palo Alto started as a
brainstorming conversation about
what things could be done to
encourage visitors who come to
the city or Stanford to find more
activities around the community."
"The University is a large
attraction to the Palo Alto com
munity and, therefore, it is a logical
partner of Destination Palo Alto,"
said Susan Barnes, the city's man
ager of economic development.
Funding for the marketing proj
ect will be procured from hotel-tax
revenue-"transient occupancy
tax"-and city sales tax. Stanford
does not provide money to the
program but shares resources and
staff time, McCown said.
