## Research links erotic photos to risk-taking 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Heterosexual men exposed to
erotic photos are more likely to take
larger financial risks than they other
wise would, according to a recent
study by Stanford researchers.
Assistant Psychology Prof. Brian
Knutson told Hie Stanford Report
that the erotic photos create a positive
emotional stimulus that triggers an
area of the brain associated with antic
ipation of reward.

Knutson and his fellow researchers
studied heterosexual male undergrad
uate college students and used func
tional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to examine participants'
brains as they viewed photographs of
positive, negative or neutral images.
Erotic photos were used to trigger a
positive response, images of snakes
and spires were used to stimulate a
negative response and photos of
office supplies were used to prompt a
neutral response.
Immediately after viewing the
images, the participants, who were
each uiven ten dollars to gamble with
before entering the MRI scanner, had
to decide whether to gamble a dollar
— the high-risk option — or gamble
a dime — the low-risk option. Each
option carried a 50 percent of chance
of winning.
Knutson told The Stanford Report
that the study, which was published in
March 26 issue of Neuroßeport. is the

first to demonstrate that emotional
stimuli can influence financial risk
trading. The study was also authored
by Camelia Kuhnen Ph.D. "06.
Columbia University psychology
graduate student G. Elliot Wimmer
and UCSD Psychology Professor
Piotr Winkielman.
Knutson also told The Stanford
Report that there is more work to be
done in researching the effects of
emotional stimuli on behavior. He
plans to study women's responses and
the influence of time, or lasting influ
ences.
