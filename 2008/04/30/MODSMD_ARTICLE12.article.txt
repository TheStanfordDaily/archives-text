## Editorial Board Stanford rush timing presents unique challenges 
### 
With the onset of spring quarter
across Stanford campus, a new ex
perience is presented to the ever
willing freshman class: the unique process
that is "rush." In a week-long process for the
women, and a two-week process for the men,
freshman (and interested sophomores and
juniors) get to meet and greet with a variety
of Greek organizations from across campus.
Stanford's rush timing is a rare exception
from the national fraternity and sorority
scene in that Greek rush is held exclusively in
the spring, as opposed to many other schools
that hold their primary rush events in the fall.
Some schools hold rush events as often as
every quarter. However, with the spring-only
approach. Stanford runs into its own set of is
sues it must learn to handle.
Ihe biggest problem with the scheduling
of spring rush seems to be the immense im
pact it has on the campus social life. While
Greek organizations do not throw all the
major open parties on campus, they do throw
a large majority of them. This, coupled with
the fact that the majority of the freshman
party-goers are busy vying for spots in their
Greek organizations of choice, leads to a fair
ly dormant party scene across campus for the
first few weeks of the quarter. Furthermore,
due to the minimal calendar-overlap be
tween fraternity and sorority rush, the social
draught is extended much longer than many
would like.The slack is picked up to some ex
tent by the other houses on the row. but hav
ing 11 houses socially out of commission is
bound to hurt.
Many larger, state schools hold rush
events in the weeks prior to classes even
starting in the fall. While this avoids the prob
lem of rush scheduling hampering social
events on campus, it also puts freshmen in the
position of needing to commit their entire
collegiate careers to a particular organiza
tion without even having stepped into their

first lecture hall.
While this may seem as an efficient and
effective way as any to disperse freshman
among the Greek institutions on campus
without having it interfere with class or any
other school oriented events, this process ef
fectively pigeon-holes freshman into four
year long obligations that may or may not be
what they had in mind.
TTie advantage of the spring rush at Stan
ford is that it gives freshman two full quarters
to not only get used to the lifestyle change
that embodies the college experience, but
also that it gives nearly six full months for the
young and starry-eyed frosh to get a feel for
what each Greek organization is about and
whether or not "going Greek" is right for
them.
Committing one's self to one particular
organization and one group of people is
much more impactful on the college experi
ence than many people realize, and the abili
ty to have time to really mull the decision
over greatly increases the chances of that de
cision truly being the right one for the indi
vidual in question.
This time to adjust to college and get to
know each individual fraternity or sorority
and the people it contains is an absolutely
priceless element of the spring rush and is
what makes the Stanford Greek community
so vibrant, diverse, and successful. By giving
freshman two quarters worth of time. Stan
ford makes sure that they are ready to make
what is truly an important and college-life-al
tering decision.
While it is not without its negatives, the
Editorial Board wishes to commend the
Stanford Greek community and the involved
Stanford administrators for maintaining the
spring rush tradition. This form of scheduling
and organization creates the best opportuni
ty for freshman to make better informed de
cisions.
