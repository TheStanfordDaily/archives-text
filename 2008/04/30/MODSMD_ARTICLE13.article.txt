# Co-Terminal Illness
## Happy World Press Freedom Day! 
### 
Last Saturday morning began like any
other for Andrew Mwenda. The out
spoken, Ugandan journalist got out of
bed, showered, dressed, ate breakfast,
hopped in his truck and drove to work in
downtown Kampala. Then. five unmarked
cars surrounded his vehicle while govern
ment agents arrested him at gunpoint. His
crime? Publishing a deserter's allegations of
human rights violations by the Ugandan
army. At the same time,military intelligence
officers ransacked his home in search of
"seditious" materials. They confiscated a
computer, DVDs, personal papers and the
manuscript of the book he began writing as
a Knight Fellow while at Stanford last year.
Andrew Mwenda will be fine. Within
hours of his arrest. Reuters, BBC and The
Associated Press published stories online
about his arrest, and he was released on bail
later that day.
A happy World Press Freedom Day to
you and yours! You are forgiven for not
knowing that World Press Freedom Day is
on Saturday. The American media doesn't
spill as much ink as it could about threats to
journalism, opting instead to focus on more
profitable issues like Hillary's shot of
Crown Royal and Obama's "dainty" bowl
ing style.
Plus, there are plenty of other important
celebrations that fall on the same day. May
3 is also National Scrapbooking Day (for
appreciating good scrapbooks). Lumpy
Rug Day (for appreciating good rugs) anil
the Kentucky Derby (for appreciating that,
despite the money jockeys are making, you
are not five feet tall).
Rev. Jeremiah Wright, another media fa
vorite, famously stated after 9/11 that,
"America's chickens are coming home to
roost" after we "supported state terrorism
against the Palestinians and the Black
South Africans." I disagree with that specif
ic argument, but not the reasoning behind it:
shortsighted American foreign policy is
having a lot of unintended consequences.
I don't think anyone would argue that
the United States government systematical
ly sets out to hinder press freedom. Yes, the
military has detained a number of journal
ists in Iraq and Afghanistan on flimsy
charges, and the Voice of America has been
accused of paying journalists for favorable
news coverage, but by and large we are a
country that respects the free press.
But. digging deeper into the Mwenda
case, who were the government agents that

arrested him at gunpoint and looted his
home? Many were members of the Joint
Anti-Terrorism Task Force, a Ugandan se
curity service created in 2002. Skittish about
terrorism and eager for allies, the United
States blessed the agency's creation with
diplomatic and financial support. As the
second-largest aid donor to Uganda, your
tax dollars may have helped pay for the pis
tol that was shoved in Andrew's face as he
was bundled into a waiting vehicle.
There are some fun examples of press
mistreatment in Uganda with a strong Stan
ford connection, too. Katherine Roubos '07
worked in the Ugandan capital last summer
on a Communication Department stipend.
She was assigned a series of stories about
gay and lesbian issues — homosexuality is
illegal in Uganda — and by the time she had
written her third story on the topic, a host of
religious leaders were calling for her to be
deported.
Leading the charge was Pastor Martin
Ssempa, a virulent homophobe who has
also received millions in funding for his ab
stinence-based awareness programs from
President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief. Despite calling for the deportation
of an American student because of her hon
est reporting and for being a "homo sympa
thizer," Ssempa continues to receive Amer
ican taxpayer money for his programs.
The irony is that even Ssempa has cause
to support a robust press. The good pastor
actually found his most damning "evi
dence" against Katherine — she had volun
teered at Stanford's LGBT Resource Cen
ter— by searching The Daily's online
archives. Who says this paper is useless!
As you lie on a nice rug this Saturday,
making a scrapbook about the Kentucky
Derby while sipping a mint julep, remember
that while any foreign policy is going to have
unintended consequences, we ought to
work a bit harder to fix them.
