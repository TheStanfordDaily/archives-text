# You're Not Special
## A 						quiet life 
### 
When I came to college, I was sure that
I would soon become one of those
students who disappear all week
into the library, the ones whose best friends
are the grad students at their advisors' lab. In
retrospect, there was little basis for this as
sumption. since even in high school I was a
very lazy person.
Both my parents are professionals with
doctorates, and while neither demanded that
I follow any particular career, the assumption
was that I would eventually be filled with a
passion for law or molecular chemistry and
be swept along to graduate school.
But. things did not turn out that way. From
the moment I stepped onto campus I was
confronted with the dilemma that would
soon come to occupy much of my time here.
1 am not very comfortable in social situa
tions, and I find life here very lonely. When I
am alone, I feel very little desire for human
contact. At home, I can go for weeks without
speaking to someone who is not in my imme
diate family. But at college, the masses are
unavoidable. And they are always there,
leading interconnected lives.
Even when my door was closed, people
were right outside,carrying on conversations,
making friendships, falling in love. My once
enjoyable solitude now made me feel like I
was being shut out of campus life. Simple in
terpersonal interactions were extremely dif
ficult for me. When I was around people, I
was extremely uncomfortable, and when I
was in large groups of people, I'd find it diffi
cult to strike up conversations. It took me
years to learn how to casually call up a friend
or drop by their room to hang out. I rapidly
discovered that I was not the kind of person

My once-enjoyable
solitude now made
me feel shut out of
campus life.

who could juggle a social life and other re
sponsibilities.
I could have, and perhaps I should have,
done what many of my friends did: I could
have moved into Mirrielees, isolated my
self and let my tenuous relationships wither
away. It would have been a momentary pain,
but perhaps 1 could have stopped obsessing
over what I was missing.
Instead. I decided that I would overcome
these deficiencies within myself. I threw my
self into the social scene. I rushed fraternities

(abysmally). I forced myself to go to parties,
and once there. I forced myself to stay at
them, not really interacting with anyone, just
sort of drifting along in the background until
they finally ended and I could wander home.
1 drew into 680 Lomita and then spent the
next two years in Synergy, possibly the worst
possible place on campus for someone with
my inclinations.
And this life has had its satisfactions. I
have made friends, many more than 1 would
have ever thought possible. I've interacted
with a wide range of people, had many inter
esting conversations and gone on a scattering
of adventures. But all this has happened at a
substantial cost to my schoolwork and the
sort of intellectual life I thought I would lead
at college.
And my internal progress has not nearly
been as complete as I would have hoped. 1
still get anxious about calling people. 1 still
find large gatherings awkward, find it hard to
speak to people 1 don't know and am uncom
fortable interacting with new groups. I'm still
not sure that I have the sort of close friends
that many people at Stanford seem to ac
quire so easily, and I've yet to recapture the
sort of easy comfort I had in high school.
In seven weeks. I will graduate. I can't re
ally regret the way I have spent my time here.
There was no other way I could have acted.
But if I sacrificed my academics merely to
learn that friendship and popularity are not
the sort of prize that will make me happy, that
seems a thin sort of lesson to learn from four
years and $2(X).(XX) of higher education.
