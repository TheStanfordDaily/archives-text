## CASTRO SURGING Finally healthy, Stanford catcher putting up great numbers 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Junior catcher Jason Castro may current
ly be in second place in his fantasy baseball
league on Yahoo! but when it comes to real
life he and the Cardinal are currently on top
in the tight race for the Pac-10 crown.
Castro is the go-to player when Stanford
needs a run in the clutch. He has started in
all 41 games this season and is the offensive
frontrunner with 64 hits, 45 runs, 40 RBls,
ten homeruns and the top batting average
on the team at .379.
He had a great performance this past
week and will look to extend his ten-game
hitting streak in tonight's match against
Davis. Over the past six games for the Car
dinal. Castro has batted .560 (14-for-25) and
roped some big hits, including a triple and
his ninth and tenth home runs. He drove in
nine runs and scored 12 of his own while
drawing three walks and not striking out
once.
Castro claims that he has an advantage at
the plate because, as a catcher, he works
with pitchers so much that it helps him esti
mate which pitches will be chosen under
vary ing circumstances. His position also en
ables him to lead the team both offensively
and defensively.
"1 get to have the inside track for differ
ent counts." Castro said. "This year I am for
tunate enough to catch almost every game
which means I get to handle each pitcher in
dividually This personal relationship helps
me to understand what works for each play
er.
"Catching is my favorite position and
getting more experience behind the plate
has helped me to feel more comfortable out
there. Because I am a catcher. I see myself as
one of the leaders on this team and 1 think I
can handle the responsibility of my position
pretty well."
With all of the success Castro is having, it
is easy to forget last year when he struggled
offensively while battling injury. In the off
season he rallied back in one of the top sum

mer leagues in the country, the Cape Cod
Baseball League.This was a turning point in
his collegiate career which launched him
into his "go-to" role on the Stanford squad.

"It does something
for your confidence
to be able to
compete and do well
at a high level."

Junior catcher

"1 got hurt during the beginning of the
season last year." Castro said. "It was a lin
gering issue all season. Being able to be
healthy all season is great because I am able
to play and show what I can do."
For his Cape Cod team, he had a .341 bat
ting average over a total of 39 games. He im
proved his game offensively accumulating
four homeruns. 22 RBIs and six stolen bases
which earned him All-League recognition
and a guaranteed spot in the All-Star Game.
"Cape Cod gave me the opportunity to
play every day against some of the top com
petition in the country," Castro continued.
"It does something for your confidence to
be able to compete and do well at a high
level. My goal was to carry over that confi
dence into this season."

What sets Castro apart from most other
fantasy baseball players is that he actually
has a shot to play for his team one day. In
2005, the Boston Red Sox drafted him as a
43rd round pick in the MLB First-Year Play
er Draft, right after his senior high school
season. Though he did not sign a contract
then, he is now eligible for the MLB Draft
again and dreams of playing on a profes
sional team.
"My main goal is to play professional
ball," Castro said. "Being drafted by the Red
Sox was a great experience, but 1 would be
happy getting the chance to play for any
team."
If Castro and the Cardinal continue to
consistently play hard and get wins, come

June they will find themselves in Omaha at
the College World Series where MLB scouts
flock to pick out the top players in the na
tion.
"We want to go to Omaha," Castro said.
"But we try to mainly focus on the game at
hand and let things take care of themselves."
That approach has worked wonders so
far for the Card, who started the season un
ranked and have climbed to a current high
of No. 3 in the national rankings. There is
still a lot of baseball to play, but Omaha is
seeming more and more like a very real pos
sibility.
