# Softball having record year
## 2008 squad smashing prior numbers 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 8 Stanford Softball
team is in the midst of a stellar
season, with 42 wins against
just 10 losses and a respectable
7-8 record in the loaded Pacif
ic-10 Conference, good for
fourth place. With six games
left to go in the regular season,
the Cardinal already has as
many conference wins as it did
all of last season, and the team
eclipsed its overall win total
from 2007 (Stanford went 35-
21-1 last year) weeks ago.
As one might expect on a
team that is breaking through
last year's records, the 2008
edition of the Cardinal is driv
en by a number of athletes who
are making their marks not
only on this season, but also on
the program record books.
Stanford has a real shot at win
ning 50 games, something only
the 2001 team has done in the
14-year history of Cardinal
Softball. That success has been
driven by players on both sides
of the ball that are knocking on
the door to Stanford's all-time
record lists. ,
Pitcher Missy Penna (30-9)
belongs at the top of any dis
cussion of Stanford's star per
formers this year. The junior
right-hander has pitched 261.2
innings over 40 of the Cardi
nal's 52 games this season, tal
lying 327 strikeouts along the
way.
Penna sits just behind Car
dinal great Dana Sorenson for
the season records in both wins
and strikeouts at Stanford.
Sorenson won 34 games and
struck out 358 batters in 2004
to break her own Stanford
records, but with two regular

season weekends plus postsea
son play still to come this year.
Penna stands a great chance of
topping those marks.
While Penna has been
keeping runs off the board for
Stanford's opponents, sopho
more catcher Rosey Neill has
been piling them on in favor of
the Cardinal. Neill has explod
ed for 17 homeruns so far this
year, just two shy of third base
man Michelle Smith's program
record of 19. Neill. who leads
the team with 48 RBIs, is also
likely to become just the sixth
player in Stanford history to
record 50 RBIs in a season, al
though the single season
record (66) might be out of
reach.
Part of what has made Neill
so dangerous at the plate this
year is that she has had runners
on base to drive home. The old
Stanford record for walks, 33,
has been broken by not one but
two players this season. Desig
nated player Erin Howe has
taken ball four 35 times this
year and shortstop Maddy
Coon has walked 46 times.
Howe and Coon are leading
a team that, with 231 walks, has
obliterated the old Cardinal
team record of 198 walks with
games left to play. Thanks to
those free passes, Stanford
players are getting on base at a
productive .395 clip.
Neill and sophomore Alissa
Haber, who is leading the team
in batting average for the sec
ond year running, have 25 and
28 walks respectively. All four
players have on-base-percent
ages over .460.
With a roster this full of
record-setters, the chances of a
deep postseason run look pret
ty good for a Cardinal program
that hopes to get back to the
Women's College World Series
for the first time in four years.
