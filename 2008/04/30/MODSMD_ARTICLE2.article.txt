A key voice in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process visited Stanford Tuesday night as part
of a speaking tour of American universities.
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Ambassador to the United States At if Safieh
spoke at Kresge Auditorium in an event pre
sented by the Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (CJME). Hie event was co-sponsored by
the Organization of Arab Students in Stanford
and Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel.
Lecturer Khalil Barhoum, coordinator of
the University's African and Middle Eastern
Languages program, introduced Safieh. read
ing from an open letter Safieh wrote to
President George W. Bush in a 2003 issue of
The Guardian.
"1 believe, Mr. President, that you are badly
advised and poorly surrounded, and 1 sincerely
hope that you will unburden yourself of the
shallow and belligerent neo-conservative ideol
ogy and the delirious Christian fundamentalist
theology," Barhoum read aloud in Safieh's

words. "My understanding of the Christian
faith is that Christ has never left us and that
there is no need to support unquestioningly
Israel's territorial appetite to accelerate His
return."
Safieh opened by speaking about the situa
tion of the Palestinian people.
"Palestinians have been the victims of the
victims" Safieh said. "They have suffered three
successive denials — a denial of their mere
physical existence, a denial of their national
rights and, the most morally disturbing, a denied
recognition of their pain and suffering."
Safieh said he felt that America, which plays
a large role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, has allowed Israel too much leeway.
"1 believe America to be the locomotive for
bringing about a Palestinian nation," Safieh
said. "America is a super-power and deals with
us as the only remaining super-power. But
when it deals with Israel, it acts like it is
Luxembourg or Liechtenstein."
Safieh criticized what he saw as a lack of

Palestine Liberation Organization Ambassador to the U.S. Afif Safieh spoke in Kresge Auditorium last night, criticizing U.S. President
George W. Bush both for his "neo-conservative ideology" and for allowing Israel "too much leeway" in the Middle East peace process.
international ' involvement and
intervention in the conflict.
"Too much has been left to local
military authorities," Safieh said.
"There are two asymmetrical play
ers. and Israel becomes tempted to
impose conditions."
"Any diplomatic outcome that
reflects the imbalance of power will
not be permanent, durable or last
ing" he added.
Safieh urged greater involve
ment from powers besides the
United States in the conflict, though
he felt that ultimate success would
depend upon America.
"Europe is still an actor in search
of a role," he said. "And the Middle
East has a role in search of an
actor."

Safieh also criticized Israeli reac
tions to the suffering of Palestinian
civilians.
"Any society that is insensitive to
the pain they inflict should expect a
reduction in sympathy for the pain
they suffer," he said.
The crowd in attendance met
Safieh with a positive reception, with
little or no sign of disagreement in
questions and crowd reactions.
"I agreed with every word he
said," said Nir Evron, a graduate
student in Comparative Literature.
"I thought it was really good,"
said Amir Badat '10. "I'm not really
that familiar with the conflict, but as
a speaker you could tell he was pas
sionate. You'd expect him to be tired
after saying these things so many
times, but he had emotion."
Students recognized, however,
that the event represented only one
take on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"I thought it was a fairly good
event," said Jonathan Gelbart '11,

who described himself as pro-Israel.
"I've heard much worse from
Americans regarding anti-Israel
sentiment."
"Obviously he's coming from the
other side from Israel," Gelbart
added. "But nothing he said was too
outrageous. I thought the stuff read
from his letter was more extreme."
Jen Wang '10 offered Safieh a
final question, asking which U.S.
presidential candidate he supports.
"As a foreign diplomat, we are
expected to exercise self-restraint in
something like that — unlike
American diplomats in our country,
1 might add," he said. "But we've
seen a reawakening of American
idealism in this campaign, and 1
hope the result won't send the youth
back to disillusionment."
"This is a chance for America to
reconcile with the world," he added.
