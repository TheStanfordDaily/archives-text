# Where's the future?

With all due respect to the
Stanford basketball pro
gram, the Lopez twins. Bob
Bowlsby, and the freshly minted
head coach of the Cardinal men's
team, Johnny Dawkins, it should be
obvious to anyone really paying at
tention that this was no one's first
choice.
By which 1 mean this probably
wasn't what Bowlsby or former
coach Trent Johnson wanted. It defi
nitely wasn't what the University or
its sports fans wanted. And really, as
Dawkins will probably find soon
enough, this job isn't even what he
envisioned, and hence, maybe not
what he wanted either.
I'm speaking of course of the re
cent drama that played out in a mat
ter of a few weeks. The exact se
quence of events is somewhat con
fusing, but suffice it to say that John
son isn't here any more, Mike Mont
gomery is across the Bay, and the
Stanford program — for better or
worse — looks to be headed in a
drastically different direction after
its best season in years. Needless to
say, many were taken by surprise.
I would imagine Johnson himself
was taken by surprise as well, given
the rumors flying around the Bay
Area about how he feared for his job
security entering the final year of his
contract. But when you're losing, by
far, your program's most talented
players, with no sure replacements
on the horizon and an instant pay
raise in the offer from the Tigers, you
take what you can get and move on.
I doubt very much that there will
be any hard feelings between John
son and most of his colleagues in the
Department of Athletics, despite his
departure. Indeed, I doubt many
Stanford fans will be that upset with
the man who many thought always
wanted to be a "lifer" with the Stan
ford program.
But that dilemma is, finally, be
hind Bowlsby and the Cardinal. Sort
of. Because even though the coach
the Stanford Athletics Department
selected to replace Johnson appears,
in many ways, to be an excellent fit
for the program, it's hard to envision
a way in which things could have
gone worse following Stanford's
Sweet 16 finish in the NCAA Tour
nament.
That Dawkins is worthy of a pro
motion to the Division 1 head coach
ing ranks is no doubt true. The fail
ures of other former Duke assistants
aside, it would be hard to envision a
program that could better groom a
coach for the unique challenges pre
sented by the Stanford situation.
But realistically, what's the up
side? The best-case scenario?
Let's say things go well for
Dawkins, and in two or three years
he has the program humming again
like it once did under Mike Mont
gomery. Stanford has an identifiable
style and is a contender year in and
year out. As fantastic a development
as that would be, isn't it likely to be a
short one? If Dawkins is the kind of
coach who can fix what is sure to ail
Stanford next season, then he'll be
exactly the kind of coach that Duke
might want in the not-too-distant fu
ture when Coach K eventually de
cides to call it a career. Or some other
athletic department with deeper
pockets than the Cardinal's, for that
matter.
Stanford basketball was seen as a
possible final destination for their
coaching careers by two men that we
know of—Montgomery and John
son. For pretty much everyone else in
the coaching world it's a stepping
stone — a place to show your worth
at a University that operates under
special conditions. The thinking is
that if you can make it work here, you
can make it work better somewhere
else that will let you recruit someone
to play for you independent of his ac
ademic abilities.
In a little over a week, the Cardi
nal lost its chance to lock down a
good coach for a career. Now, it's
back to square one.
