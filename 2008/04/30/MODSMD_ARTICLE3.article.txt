### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Leslie Hume Ph.D. '79 has been elected to
serve as the first female president of the
Board of Trustees since Jane Stanford in
1903.
Hume, whose term as president will begin
in July, said she was surprised and honored to
receive the appointment, and that she is
pleased at the progress women have made in
higher education in recent years.
"1 feel incredibly fortunate," Hume said.

"Stanford is a place that has done a tremen
dous amount for me, and 1 just feel lucky to
be able to do something small for Stanford."
Hume — who has served on the Board of
Trustees since 2000 and on numerous com
mittees within the Stanford administration
— will take over as head of the Board at the
start of the 2008-2009 academic term on July
1.
Her tenure will end the 105-year streak of
male board presidents. Hume sees her capa
bility to rise to this position in the University
as part of a larger trend among institutions of

higher education nationwide over the last ten
years.
"Education and non-profit sectors have
really opened up to women in ways that the
corporate sector has not," she said, citing the
presence of female university presidents at
Harvard, Princeton, Brown and the
University of Pennsylvania, and in leadership
roles at various education institutions.
Hume also credited Stanford with pro
moting an academic community that pro
vides women with equal opportunities for
advancement.

"I happened to be in the right place at the
right time," Hume said. "Stanford has really
had a historic commitment since the begin
ning. This is a place that has embraced
women."
But Hume also acknowledged the fact
that Stanford's "historic commitment" to the
role of women in higher education has yet to
translate into the appointment of a female
president of the University. U.S. Secretary of
