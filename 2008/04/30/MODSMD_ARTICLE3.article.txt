# Trustees elect female president
## Hume is first female to lead the Board since Jane Stanford 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Leslie Hume Ph.D. '79 has been elected to
serve as the first female president of the
Board of Trustees since Jane Stanford in
1903.
Hume, whose term as president will begin
in July, said she was surprised and honored to
receive the appointment, and that she is
pleased at the progress women have made in
higher education in recent years.
"1 feel incredibly fortunate," Hume said.

"Stanford is a place that has done a tremen
dous amount for me, and 1 just feel lucky to
be able to do something small for Stanford."
Hume — who has served on the Board of
Trustees since 2000 and on numerous com
mittees within the Stanford administration
— will take over as head of the Board at the
start of the 2008-2009 academic term on July
1.
Her tenure will end the 105-year streak of
male board presidents. Hume sees her capa
bility to rise to this position in the University
as part of a larger trend among institutions of

higher education nationwide over the last ten
years.
"Education and non-profit sectors have
really opened up to women in ways that the
corporate sector has not," she said, citing the
presence of female university presidents at
Harvard, Princeton, Brown and the
University of Pennsylvania, and in leadership
roles at various education institutions.
Hume also credited Stanford with pro
moting an academic community that pro
vides women with equal opportunities for
advancement.

"I happened to be in the right place at the
right time," Hume said. "Stanford has really
had a historic commitment since the begin
ning. This is a place that has embraced
women."
But Hume also acknowledged the fact
that Stanford's "historic commitment" to the
role of women in higher education has yet to
translate into the appointment of a female
president of the University. U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice's service as Provost
from 1993 to 1999 marked the high
est-level administrative office held
by a woman at Stanford so far.
Hume is confident that women
will continue to rise in administra
tive positions at Stanford and
other universities, although she
said she would not want to serve as
the University president because
she thinks the position should
instead be filled by a tenured facul
ty member.
"1 would hope that, having bro
ken through these barriers, you're
going to have more and more
women breaking through," she said.
"There's still a long way to go."
When I lume takes over as presi
dent of the board this summer, she

and the board will begin to consider
which issues across the University
they will address in the coming
term.
Iliese issues will likely include
reviewing the recommendations of
the University's taskforce on fresh
man expansion. An expansion of
undergraduate housing, which
would likely follow any such growth
in the student body, is also likely to
be under consideration. Other
items for deliberation, she said, will
likely include the expansion of the
Stanford Hospital and the findings
of a special taskforce on the oppor
tunities and challenges of globaliza
tion.
Hume claimed that it came as
both "a huge honor and a huge sur
prise" when she found out she had
been elected president of the board.
Prior to the announcement she
never thought she would serve in
this position as she "just assumed

there would be other people" who
the trusteeship would select to head
the board. Even so. she feels capa
ble of working with President
Hennessy. her fellow board mem
bers and the administration in mak
ing decisions for the University.
"1 understand governance," she
said. "1 understand what it means
for a chair to work with a board and
an administration."
In addition to serving as a mem
ber of the Board of Trustees, Hume
also serves on the Stanford
Challenge Executive Committee,
the Stanford Challenge Leadership
Council, the Arts Initiative Council
and the Humanities and Sciences
Council. She graduated from
Stanford in 1979 with a Ph.D. in his
tory and has worked as a lecturer,
administrator and consultant.
