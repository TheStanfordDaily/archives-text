# GAUTHIER CAPS GREAT CAREER
## SENIOR REFLECTS AND LOOKS FORWARD TO NCAAS 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
One single goal. Today, that is basically
nothing for Stanford's Jackie Gauthier. After
all. the senior two-meter player is tied for the
second most goals on the team with 45 on the
season, giving her an average of over one and
a half scores a game. But that single goal was
in fact all she scored during her freshman sea
son on the Farm — which makes her transi
tion into one of the Card's go-to scorers all
the more remarkable.
"She has an amazing feel for where there
are shooting openings, which makes her a
great finisher," said Stanford head coach John
Tanner. "Of course, we had no idea she'd turn
out this way after her freshman year."
However. Gauthier made up for lost time
during a breakout sophomore season in which
she scored 20 goals. She was also named to the
MPSF and the AWPCA All Academic teams
— a feat which she repeated last year in her
junior season. Her junior year also brought
about another big increase in goals, up to 41,
good for third most on the squad. And with a
possible three games left for the Cardinal this
year, the 50-goal plateau is still within reach.
She has also done this while adapting to
new positions, playing on the interior, perime
ter and even in goal during her four years.
This year, she has settled into the two-meter
position.
"(The position] takes a significant skill set,
experience, strength and toughness, and

Jackie has thrived," said Tanner.
Megan Nesland — Gauthier's only fellow
senior on the team — was also in awe of her
versatility.
"Jackie is amazing in the pool because she
can adapt to anything — this year we needed
more two-meter players, so she just stepped
up and filled that role," said Nesland. "It's
hard enough to train for one position, but she
trains for all of them because she can play all
of them."
Gauthier admitted that, as the numbers
show, she has grown a lot as a player during
her four years on the team.
"My teammates, past and present, and
coaches have taught me so much," she said. "I
know more now about water polo than 1
could have imagined when 1 started playing
ten years ago."
She also believes that her time on the team
has helped her grow a lot as a person.
"I have learned both how to win — and lose
— gracefully, and how much of a difference
having confidence in yourself and your team
mates can have."
Gauthier has also had to take a leadership
position this year, as she is the only senior in
the pool for the Cardinal. Nesland is working
as an assistant coach with the team due to
injury.
"It has been a little strange being the only
true senior in the water," she said. "But

quiet freshman year.
