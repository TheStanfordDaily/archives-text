# STUDENT LIFE
## Weekend helps seal the deal Prospective freshmen hail Admit Weekend as valuable 
### VERONICA LANDA 
This past weekend more than
one thousand prospective fresh
men. lovingly known as ProFros,
got their first taste of Stanford life
at the University's annual Admit
Weekend. According to several
ProFros with whom The Daily
spoke, their experiences at Admit
Weekend played a large role in
their decision to attend Stanford.
Out of the many activities
Stanford arranged for the ProFros,
the Academic Expos were very
popular.
"The Academic Expos were a
great way to hear a lecture from a
professor who could potentially he
your professor next year, and to
meet other ProFros with similar
academic interests," said Lauren
Piatt of San Diego, CA, who stayed
in Otero during the weekend.
For Caitlin Gerrity of Bellevue,
WA, the weekend made her opti
mistic about her future freshman
dorm experience.
"Most valuable to me was some
thing 1 hadn't really expected,"
Gerrity said in an email. "1 figured
out that the kind of housing I origi
nally thought I'd like (quiet, small,
co-ed by floor, potentially four
class) is definitely not what 1 actual
ly prefer, and so I'm much more
confident that my freshman dorm
experience will be good. I'm now
thinking medium-large, co-ed by
room, all frosh (or mostly frosh)
and louder."
Sugoon Fucharoen of Thailand,
who stayed in FroSoCo, said in an
email that he "really felt at home
[at Stanford]."
This notion, reflected in many
other ProFros' reactions to Admit
Weekend, is what, as Kauanoe
Batangan of Hawaii said, will
"[seal] the deal" and "make these
new students confident in choosing
Stanford."
"Admit Weekend sealed the
deal," an excited Batangan said in a
phone interview.
Batangan said he was previously
95 percent sure he would accept
Stanford's offer, but that after stay
ing in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk for the

weekend, he enrolled as soon as he
got home.
Gerrity said that during her stay
in Naranja, she "liked hanging out
with current students — at meals
or in the dorms — and relaxing on
campus to get a feel for it."
For Edgar Navarro of Salinas,
CA, who spent the weekend in
Twain and Roble, the best part of
the weekend was "meeting poten
tial classmates and exploring the
campus."
"The RoHos were great and
friendly, and 1 enjoyed all the activ

ities Stanford had set up for us,"
Navarro said.
To some ProFros, however, the
weekend was not without fault.
"1 wish we had bikes to use just
for that weekend." Gerrity said.
"My four to five trips daily between
Naranja and Donner, plus other
walking and fountain hopping (also
in new flip flops), had me tired by
the end of the day and 1 think has
given me an inaccurate perception
of how large campus is."
"1 have this idea that it is huge
and somewhat unmanageable, but 1

know this won't be true as soon as 1
have a longboard or bike," she
added.
When asked what, if anything,
he did not like about Admit
Weekend, Batangan had a difficult
time answering.
"That's a tough one," he said. "I
guess that 1 couldn't do everything
I wanted to, and I couldn't attend
all of the activities. 1 wish there was
more time."
