## Take a ride on the Marguerite 
### AN LE NGUYEN STACIECHAN ROXNA IRANI 
In response to a burning desire to escape the Stanford Bubble and dorm food, Features writers spent their Saturdays on
Marguerite roadtrips in pursuit of the best attractions and recreational activities in town. For your traveling expertise, here
are the results of their excursions to Palo Alto along the Shopping Express route.

When you Google "Fun Things to Do in
Palo Alto," one of the top ten attractions
recommended by www.tripadvisor.com
is Steve Jobs' garage. This speaks vol
umes about the sleepy city of Palo Alto
— there just isn't much excitement here.
At New York University, you may find Ashley Olsen
zipping from club to club in the hustle and bustle of the Big
Apple. At Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, you are
lucky if you can spot Mark Zuckerberg at a lunch meeting
with corporate hotshots.
While Palo Alto may never gain repute for its wild so
cial scene, it does offer an escape from the humdrum of
campus life. Traveling on the Marguerite, you will be sur
prised to find a myriad of places to take your mind off of
midterms and papers.The next time you feel stifled by the
Stanford Bubble, try exploring the stops along the Shop
ping Express route. You may find yourself enchanted by
the comfortable, suburban appeal of Palo Alto.
California Avenue
When you board the Shopping Express at Tresidder
Union, it will take you through the East Residences to the
intersection of El Camino Real and California Avenue. As
you walk down California's Avenue of the Arts, you will
discover a delightful collection of public artworks. Among
the pieces that playfully adorn the avenue are "Go
Mama," "Jungle Jane," "Year of the Ocean," "Body of the
Urban Myth" and "Sun Flowers."
California Avenue also offers a wide selection of
restaurants from which you can get your Saturday morn
ing brunch. Cafe Brioche, for instance, is a Zagat-rated
restaurant with a French flair. Here you can enjoy a hearty
breakfast of freshly made pancakes, eggs and chicken
apple sausage for $7.95. The more discerning connoisseur
may appreciate the roasted leg of lamb, served on brioche
with roasted eggplant and rosemary aioli.for $8.95.
Students who are incurably fed up with dining hall
desserts can also satisfy their sweet tooth with delicious
snacks from the Palo Alto Baking Company. This bakery
offers a mouthwatering array of pastries and desserts,
ranging from your standard butter croissant to decadent
white chocolate mousses.
If you want a real meal, however, hightail over to The
Counter. This restaurant is strikingly characterized by its
graffiti-inspired artwork, gigantic flat-screen televisions

and energetic buzz.'lTie Counter allows you to personalize
your burger, and offers a wide selection of cheeses, top
pings, sauces and buns.The sweet potato fries are a must.
Further down the avenue, you will find Know Knew
Books, one of the best haunts in Palo Alto. 'Iliis maze-like
second-hand bookstore has an impressive collection of
books,CDs, DVDs and records. For the eternal nerd, there
are Star Trek action figures and Marvel comics galore. It is
a paradise for bookworms and geeks alike.
Wal-Mart and Targe!
If you are in desperate need of supplies, the next Shop
ping Express stop is a no-brainer.
Take a brief trip to Wal-Mart and Target for reasonably
priced school materials, dorm adornments and the like.
Shopping Center
No doubt the avid shopper will be satisfied by the mul

titude of stores found in the Stanford Shopping Center.
With retailers as varied as Armani Exchange, Betsy John
son, Burberry and Nike, the only thing you have to worry
about is spending the equivalent of your tuition money on
accoutrement.
Palo Alto Transit Center
End your Marguerite journey with a leisurely stroll in
downtown Palo Alto.
Far off the beaten path, on Waverley Street, you can ex
plore Elizabeth Gamble Garden, a historic estate distin
guished by its stunning collection of flowers and greenery.
You can dine and converse alfresco at the Carriage House
Patio and the Tea House Patio in Palo Alto's prettiest gar
den. The picturesque setting is sure to capture your imag
ination.
If this notion does not interest you. contemplate a visit
to the historic Cardinal Hotel or an ice-skating extrava
ganza at Winter Lodge. Take advantage of the California
sunshine and picnic at Rinconada Park on Embarcadero
Road. If you do not care to travel that far, enjoy a brief so
journ at the smaller Scott or Johnson parks.
Along University Avenue, you will also find Pizza My
Heart, a popular restaurant that is frequented by high
school and college students alike. The pizza is pretty de
cent and the prices are reasonable.Those with a hankering
for a more exotic dining experience should consider the
Zao Noodle Bar. Sample tofu fries for $5.50, chicken sum
mer rolls for $7 and ginger-garlic-chili chicken and prawns
for $11.50.
Hie eager dessert seekers will stumble across Michael's
Gelato and Cafe right next to Borders. Granted a gelato is
more expensive than your standard ice cream cone, but
the savory sensation is well worth your money. Request
the affogato if you have a penchant for coffee.
At the close of your Marguerite road trip, enjoy a
movie at the Stanford Theatre which, 83 years after its
opening, still serves as the premier place to view classic
Hollywood films. Once immersed in the theatre's glam
orous 1920s atmosphere, you can easily imagine
Humphrey Bogart lounging about the foyer with a cigar in
hand. Independent and foreign language cinema buffs
should also consider the Aquarius Theatre, which offers
showings of the latest movies.
Food, film and fun. What more could a college student
ask for?

Maybe the luxury of ears spoils us;
maybe it doesn't. But when gas gets
too expensive or parking is just im
possible to find, that big white bus
shuttling Stanford students around
campus and Palo Alto is a lifesaver.
And sometimes it can definitely be more than a free
transport service — if you look a bit further, the
Marguerite is a convenient means to an entertaining
weekend afternoon!
It was Admit Weekend, and, socially, campus was
pretty much dead — apart from Hohopalooza. at
least. For some unknown reason, we were inspired to
revert to our good old freshman days of limited
transportation and rely on Stanford's public trans
portation to entertain us on that 80 degree Saturday.
For those of you who incessantly complain about the
absence of something fun to do around Stanford, you
need to read on. I lop on the Shopping Express with
a Marguerite time schedule and absolutely no itiner
ary whatsoever, and a lackluster Saturday can quick
ly become a magical one.
The night before, like true Stanford students, we
were preparing to map out the most time-efficient,
exciting Marguerite route possible. But it's a Mar
guerite trip. What's there to plan ahead anyway? So
we scratched the itinerary and set off to explore the
Wild Wild West that is Palo Alto.
We started off by almost missing the earliest Mar
guerite line that stops on Escondido at 10:17 a.m. It
was a Saturday morning. You know it's not that easy.
Our first stop brought us to the intersection of El
Camino and California, the perfect place for you and
friends to find a satisfying, affordable brunch from a
large number of cafes in a row. For those in a rush,
Quizno's is always a great fall back option, along
with five dollar footlongs at Subway — if you can't
get enough of it on campus itself! Izzy's Bagels,
Mediterranean Wraps and Joanie's Cafe are also
worth checking out. It only depends on what you're
craving for that sunny Saturday morning.
For those over 21, you can explore the finer side
of Palo Alto, beyond the rug stores, and do some
wine tasting at Vin VinoWine.Also.be sure to hit up
the Farmer's Market on California Avenue — every
Sunday morning at 9 a.m.

After spotting the hidden Zagat rated sticker, we
decided to grab a quick bite at Cafe Brioche. Unfor
tunately, it turned out not to be as quick as we'd
hoped. Apparently 50 minutes isn't enough to have a
leisurely brunch as well as roam the streets of Palo
Alto.
We left Cafe Brioche satisfied and even had left
overs for snacks on the afternoon portion of our
Marguerite day. We highly recommend their' Home
made Beignets". not much more than dough and
powdered sugar, but fluffy little tastes of wonder.
How can you go wrong? Five tasty little pillows of
heaven for only $4.25. Sounded like a pretty good
deal to us.
We then walked up and down California Avenue,
jay walking,commenting on people's dress sense and
keeping our metabolisms going with nibbles on the
beignets. We never got around to figuring out what
"Know Knew Books" really meant, but it definitely
provided some entertainment. And the Country Sun
Natural Foods was a great place to pick up snacks to
take back to campus with us.
We then caught the 11:52 a.m. shuttle to the San
Antonio Shopping Center. Ok. that sentence may
have just lost us 89 percent of our male readers, but
we promise that not all shopping is the work of the
devil. Sports Authority, for example, is a perfect
source of entertainment for guys when the girls go off
to make a dent in their parents' wallets. And a trip to
Target or Wal-Mart can provide hours of unforeseen
fun. We recommend test-riding the bikes in the back
of the Target store and then racing down the aisles,
given it's out of sight of the employees. And on the
side of caution, get a third person to look out for you.
For the ladies out there, the list of stores in the
shopping center is practically endless. And the
prices? Stellar! Discount stores like Ross, Sears. Pay
less Shoe Source and Shoe Pavilion provide prod
ucts at half the price. And when people ask you
where you got those cute shoes, you can say they
were a gift. Or just conveniently drop the name of the
brand of the shoes rather than the store at which you
actually purchased them.
We had to somehow work off those beignets as
well as the Brioche scone and omelets, so we took a
15 minute walk down to Palo Alto Bowl. It was a Sat
urday afternoon,so the prices were pretty expensive.
But from 5 p.m. through 7:30 p.m., you can bowl for
only 50 cents a game using a coupon from

www.fun2spare.com. And another recom
mendation — maybe go bowling first so
you don't have to walk around with your

shopping bags.
The day was long, but fulfilling. The
Marguerite did its job all the way, bringing
us back to campus in time to get our crazy
Stanford lives back into order. The shut
tle, powered by bio-diesel, and us, pow
ered by good food and awesome compa
ny. made for a fantastic Saturday.
So go check out the Marguerite in all
its glory. Gas-guzzling cars are overrated
anyway, especially at over four dollars a
gallon.

ucts at half the price. And when people ask you
where you got those cute shoes, you can say they
were a gift. Or just conveniently drop the name of the
brand of the shoes rather than the store at which you
actually purchased them.
We had to somehow work off those beignets as
well as the Brioche scone and omelets, so we took a
15 minute walk down to Palo Alto Bowl. It was a Sat
urday afternoon,so the prices were pretty expensive.
But from 5 p.m. through 7:30 p.m., you can bowl for
only 50 cents a game using a coupon from

www.fun2spare.com. And another recom
mendation — maybe go bowling first so
you don't have to walk around with your

shopping bags.
The day was long, but fulfilling. The
Marguerite did its job all the way, bringing
us back to campus in time to get our crazy
Stanford lives back into order. The shut
tle, powered by bio-diesel, and us, pow
ered by good food and awesome compa
ny. made for a fantastic Saturday.
So go check out the Marguerite in all
its glory. Gas-guzzling cars are overrated
anyway, especially at over four dollars a
gallon.

In response to a burning desire to escape the Stanford Bubble and dorm food, Features writers spent their Saturdays on
Marguerite roadtrips in pursuit of the best attractions and recreational activities in town. For your traveling expertise, here
are the results of their excursions to Palo Alto along the Shopping Express route.

When you Google "Fun Things to Do in
Palo Alto," one of the top ten attractions
recommended by www.tripadvisor.com
is Steve Jobs' garage. This speaks vol
umes about the sleepy city of Palo Alto
— there just isn't much excitement here.
At New York University, you may find Ashley Olsen
zipping from club to club in the hustle and bustle of the Big
Apple. At Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, you are
lucky if you can spot Mark Zuckerberg at a lunch meeting
with corporate hotshots.
While Palo Alto may never gain repute for its wild so
cial scene, it does offer an escape from the humdrum of
campus life. Traveling on the Marguerite, you will be sur
prised to find a myriad of places to take your mind off of
midterms and papers.The next time you feel stifled by the
Stanford Bubble, try exploring the stops along the Shop
ping Express route. You may find yourself enchanted by
the comfortable, suburban appeal of Palo Alto.
California Avenue
When you board the Shopping Express at Tresidder
Union, it will take you through the East Residences to the
intersection of El Camino Real and California Avenue. As
you walk down California's Avenue of the Arts, you will
discover a delightful collection of public artworks. Among
the pieces that playfully adorn the avenue are "Go
Mama," "Jungle Jane," "Year of the Ocean," "Body of the
Urban Myth" and "Sun Flowers."
California Avenue also offers a wide selection of
restaurants from which you can get your Saturday morn
ing brunch. Cafe Brioche, for instance, is a Zagat-rated
restaurant with a French flair. Here you can enjoy a hearty
breakfast of freshly made pancakes, eggs and chicken
apple sausage for $7.95. The more discerning connoisseur
may appreciate the roasted leg of lamb, served on brioche
with roasted eggplant and rosemary aioli.for $8.95.
Students who are incurably fed up with dining hall
desserts can also satisfy their sweet tooth with delicious
snacks from the Palo Alto Baking Company. This bakery
offers a mouthwatering array of pastries and desserts,
ranging from your standard butter croissant to decadent
white chocolate mousses.
If you want a real meal, however, hightail over to The
Counter. This restaurant is strikingly characterized by its
graffiti-inspired artwork, gigantic flat-screen televisions

and energetic buzz.'lTie Counter allows you to personalize
your burger, and offers a wide selection of cheeses, top
pings, sauces and buns.The sweet potato fries are a must.
Further down the avenue, you will find Know Knew
Books, one of the best haunts in Palo Alto. 'Iliis maze-like
second-hand bookstore has an impressive collection of
books,CDs, DVDs and records. For the eternal nerd, there
are Star Trek action figures and Marvel comics galore. It is
a paradise for bookworms and geeks alike.
Wal-Mart and Targe!
If you are in desperate need of supplies, the next Shop
ping Express stop is a no-brainer.
Take a brief trip to Wal-Mart and Target for reasonably
priced school materials, dorm adornments and the like.
Shopping Center
No doubt the avid shopper will be satisfied by the mul

titude of stores found in the Stanford Shopping Center.
With retailers as varied as Armani Exchange, Betsy John
son, Burberry and Nike, the only thing you have to worry
about is spending the equivalent of your tuition money on
accoutrement.
Palo Alto Transit Center
End your Marguerite journey with a leisurely stroll in
downtown Palo Alto.
Far off the beaten path, on Waverley Street, you can ex
plore Elizabeth Gamble Garden, a historic estate distin
guished by its stunning collection of flowers and greenery.
You can dine and converse alfresco at the Carriage House
Patio and the Tea House Patio in Palo Alto's prettiest gar
den. The picturesque setting is sure to capture your imag
ination.
If this notion does not interest you. contemplate a visit
to the historic Cardinal Hotel or an ice-skating extrava
ganza at Winter Lodge. Take advantage of the California
sunshine and picnic at Rinconada Park on Embarcadero
Road. If you do not care to travel that far, enjoy a brief so
journ at the smaller Scott or Johnson parks.
Along University Avenue, you will also find Pizza My
Heart, a popular restaurant that is frequented by high
school and college students alike. The pizza is pretty de
cent and the prices are reasonable.Those with a hankering
for a more exotic dining experience should consider the
Zao Noodle Bar. Sample tofu fries for $5.50, chicken sum
mer rolls for $7 and ginger-garlic-chili chicken and prawns
for $11.50.
Hie eager dessert seekers will stumble across Michael's
Gelato and Cafe right next to Borders. Granted a gelato is
more expensive than your standard ice cream cone, but
the savory sensation is well worth your money. Request
the affogato if you have a penchant for coffee.
At the close of your Marguerite road trip, enjoy a
movie at the Stanford Theatre which, 83 years after its
opening, still serves as the premier place to view classic
Hollywood films. Once immersed in the theatre's glam
orous 1920s atmosphere, you can easily imagine
Humphrey Bogart lounging about the foyer with a cigar in
hand. Independent and foreign language cinema buffs
should also consider the Aquarius Theatre, which offers
showings of the latest movies.
Food, film and fun. What more could a college student
ask for?

Maybe the luxury of ears spoils us;
maybe it doesn't. But when gas gets
too expensive or parking is just im
possible to find, that big white bus
shuttling Stanford students around
campus and Palo Alto is a lifesaver.
And sometimes it can definitely be more than a free
transport service — if you look a bit further, the
Marguerite is a convenient means to an entertaining
weekend afternoon!
It was Admit Weekend, and, socially, campus was
pretty much dead — apart from Hohopalooza. at
least. For some unknown reason, we were inspired to
revert to our good old freshman days of limited
transportation and rely on Stanford's public trans
portation to entertain us on that 80 degree Saturday.
For those of you who incessantly complain about the
absence of something fun to do around Stanford, you
need to read on. I lop on the Shopping Express with
a Marguerite time schedule and absolutely no itiner
ary whatsoever, and a lackluster Saturday can quick
ly become a magical one.
The night before, like true Stanford students, we
were preparing to map out the most time-efficient,
exciting Marguerite route possible. But it's a Mar
guerite trip. What's there to plan ahead anyway? So
we scratched the itinerary and set off to explore the
Wild Wild West that is Palo Alto.
We started off by almost missing the earliest Mar
guerite line that stops on Escondido at 10:17 a.m. It
was a Saturday morning. You know it's not that easy.
Our first stop brought us to the intersection of El
Camino and California, the perfect place for you and
friends to find a satisfying, affordable brunch from a
large number of cafes in a row. For those in a rush,
Quizno's is always a great fall back option, along
with five dollar footlongs at Subway — if you can't
get enough of it on campus itself! Izzy's Bagels,
Mediterranean Wraps and Joanie's Cafe are also
worth checking out. It only depends on what you're
craving for that sunny Saturday morning.
For those over 21, you can explore the finer side
of Palo Alto, beyond the rug stores, and do some
wine tasting at Vin VinoWine.Also.be sure to hit up
the Farmer's Market on California Avenue — every
Sunday morning at 9 a.m.

After spotting the hidden Zagat rated sticker, we
decided to grab a quick bite at Cafe Brioche. Unfor
tunately, it turned out not to be as quick as we'd
hoped. Apparently 50 minutes isn't enough to have a
leisurely brunch as well as roam the streets of Palo
Alto.
We left Cafe Brioche satisfied and even had left
overs for snacks on the afternoon portion of our
Marguerite day. We highly recommend their' Home
made Beignets". not much more than dough and
powdered sugar, but fluffy little tastes of wonder.
How can you go wrong? Five tasty little pillows of
heaven for only $4.25. Sounded like a pretty good
deal to us.
We then walked up and down California Avenue,
jay walking,commenting on people's dress sense and
keeping our metabolisms going with nibbles on the
beignets. We never got around to figuring out what
"Know Knew Books" really meant, but it definitely
provided some entertainment. And the Country Sun
Natural Foods was a great place to pick up snacks to
take back to campus with us.
We then caught the 11:52 a.m. shuttle to the San
Antonio Shopping Center. Ok. that sentence may
have just lost us 89 percent of our male readers, but
we promise that not all shopping is the work of the
devil. Sports Authority, for example, is a perfect
source of entertainment for guys when the girls go off
to make a dent in their parents' wallets. And a trip to
Target or Wal-Mart can provide hours of unforeseen
fun. We recommend test-riding the bikes in the back
of the Target store and then racing down the aisles,
given it's out of sight of the employees. And on the
side of caution, get a third person to look out for you.
For the ladies out there, the list of stores in the
shopping center is practically endless. And the
prices? Stellar! Discount stores like Ross, Sears. Pay
less Shoe Source and Shoe Pavilion provide prod
ucts at half the price. And when people ask you
where you got those cute shoes, you can say they

Marguerite day. We highly recommend their' Home
made Beignets". not much more than dough and
powdered sugar, but fluffy little tastes of wonder.
How can you go wrong? Five tasty little pillows of
heaven for only $4.25. Sounded like a pretty good
deal to us.
We then walked up and down California Avenue,
jay walking,commenting on people's dress sense and
keeping our metabolisms going with nibbles on the
beignets. We never got around to figuring out what
"Know Knew Books" really meant, but it definitely
provided some entertainment. And the Country Sun
Natural Foods was a great place to pick up snacks to
take back to campus with us.
We then caught the 11:52 a.m. shuttle to the San
Antonio Shopping Center. Ok. that sentence may
have just lost us 89 percent of our male readers, but
we promise that not all shopping is the work of the
devil. Sports Authority, for example, is a perfect
source of entertainment for guys when the girls go off
to make a dent in their parents' wallets. And a trip to
Target or Wal-Mart can provide hours of unforeseen
fun. We recommend test-riding the bikes in the back
of the Target store and then racing down the aisles,
given it's out of sight of the employees. And on the
side of caution, get a third person to look out for you.
For the ladies out there, the list of stores in the
shopping center is practically endless. And the
prices? Stellar! Discount stores like Ross, Sears. Pay
less Shoe Source and Shoe Pavilion provide prod
ucts at half the price. And when people ask you
where you got those cute shoes, you can say they
were a gift. Or just conveniently drop the name of the
brand of the shoes rather than the store at which you
actually purchased them.
We had to somehow work off those beignets as
well as the Brioche scone and omelets, so we took a
15 minute walk down to Palo Alto Bowl. It was a Sat
urday afternoon,so the prices were pretty expensive.
But from 5 p.m. through 7:30 p.m., you can bowl for
only 50 cents a game using a coupon from

www.fun2spare.com. And another recom
mendation — maybe go bowling first so
you don't have to walk around with your

shopping bags.
The day was long, but fulfilling. The
Marguerite did its job all the way, bringing
us back to campus in time to get our crazy
Stanford lives back into order. The shut
tle, powered by bio-diesel, and us, pow
ered by good food and awesome compa
ny. made for a fantastic Saturday.
So go check out the Marguerite in all
its glory. Gas-guzzling cars are overrated
anyway, especially at over four dollars a
gallon.
