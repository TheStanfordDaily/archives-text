### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At last night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing, senators officially confirmed the 2(X)K election
results and passed budget bills for the 2(H) 1 ) fiscal year.
ITie new Senate-elect will have its last transitional
meeting with the current senators next week.
Following the meeting, the newly elected senators will
officially take office and choose their Senate and
Deputy Chairs.
Senators also passed both the Fee and ASSU
Operating Budgets for the 2(XW fiscal year Tuesday
night. While discussing the Operating budget, sena
tors threw around the idea of possibly creating a new
role for a parliamentarian for next year, going back
and forth on whether the position is really necessary.
What they could agree on was that, regardless of
whether the position is created or not, the job is one
that needs to be done.
"I think the role of the parliamentarian is to pro

vide some institutional memory," said Senator
Jonathan Kass '10 regarding the general responsibili
ty of the position.
Some senators believe that as long as responsibili
ties are clearly allocated, having a parliamentarian
present at meetings could be effective.
"As long as we can have a clear, concise job
description for the position." said Senator-Elect
Yvorn Doc Aswad '11. "I feel as though the role for
parliamentarian is necessary and is beneficial."
As the meeting drew to a close. ASSU Vice
President Mondaire Jones '09 ended with uplifting
advice for current and new ASSU members.
"We are so pleased with what the ASSU has
accomplished this past year as a whole." Jones said.
"We are really glad Jonny [Dorsey] and Fagan
[Harris] are here and expect great things from them.
Continue to do what you do. do it better and good
luck."
