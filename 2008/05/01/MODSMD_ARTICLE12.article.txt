## GSC elects over a dozen new officers Segalova and Bloom named GSC co-chairs 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) elected new officers at its
weekly meeting last night. The
highest ranking positions voted on
were those of GSC chair and
financial officer, although over a
dozen officer positions were filled.
Polina Segalova, an engineering
student, and George Bloom, a
humanities student, were elected
as GSC co-chairs, defeating
Melahn Parker and Fen Zhao nine

votes to one. Bloom served as
GSC co-chair last year as well,
along with Kristina Keating.
One of the foremost issues dis
cussed by the two pairs of candi
dates prior to the voting session
was how best to manage and allo
cate the ballooning reserve funds
at the council's disposal —
approximately $250,000.
"I don't think we only should
be talking about keeping things
the same," Bloom said in response
to questions about his plans for
the future. "I don't see why we
shouldn't expand what we're
doing and try to get more of the
graduate student community
involved in the decision-making
process."
Nanna Notthoff, a first-year
psychology graduate student, was
elected to the officer position of
financial officer, narrowly defeat
ing Zhao six votes to five.
"1 am used to dealing with
things as they come to me,"
Notthoff said, "and will be very
efficient in terms of keeping
things in order, compensating par
ties when necessary and all of
that."
Candidates for these two posi
tions had to be drawn from the fif
teen voting members of the GSC.
The current council members

were elected in the ASSU
Elections two weeks ago.
All other officer positions, how
ever. were open to everyone in the
graduate community. Positions
included funding committee chair,
programming coordinators and
secretary. Very few of these elec
tions were contested, and a major
ity of them were filled by individ
uals who had served in that role
the prior term.
Jonny Dorsey '09. newly-elect
ed ASSU president, and Fagan
Harris '09, newly-elected ASSU
vice president, also addressed the
council at the beginning of the
meeting. They spoke of the impor
tance of increasing communica
tion and collaboration between
the undergraduate and graduate
communities.
"Ultimately, we represent you
guys just like we represent the
undergraduates," Dorsey said to
the council, "but we cannot pre
tend to know what you guys want
or need as well as we do with the
undergraduate community. So feel
free to call us at any time and let
us know what you want us to do or
what you think we should be
doing differently."
