## The Wanderer Hungry? Why wait?

Santiago, Chile — Good thing
you already paid your board
bill. The "silent tsunami" of the
global food crisis is still building in
scope and destructive potential. In
an interview on the Center for
Global Development's Web site, ex
pert Peter Timmer estimated that 10
million people could die premature
ly if the crisis continues at its current
pace. Timmer, a visiting professor at
Stanford's Center for Food Security
and the Environment, added that
"unless some way can be found to
stop the explosive rise in food prices
generally, and rice prices in particu
lar, we will see sharply higher mor
tality."
I'm wondering how long it will be
before everyday American life, even
in the Stanford microcosm, is affect
ed. Like many people, I read the
news a lot, and I knew abstractly that
there was a food crisis. I knew the
price of staples like rice and corn had
doubled in many parts of the world. I
read that developing country' farm
ers had difficulty getting credit to
buy increasingly expensive fertilizer
and as a result they planted less this
year and the crisis will worsen. A
great series in the Washington Post
told me that U.S. farm subsidies have
made it profitable to plant corn for
ethanol rather than for food, mean
ing arable land has steadily been
taken away from other food crops
like wheat.
But it was only last weekend in
Mendoza, Argentina, that I had to
deal with some of the impacts first
hand. Others who had been to Ar
gentina got me excited for the trip by
raving about the people, the wine
and especially the cheap and deli
cious beef.
The meat was delicious — and
still cheap compared to a steak in the
U.S. — but the tsunami effect was
very visible. Nearly every restaurant
had menus with the new higher price
marked by cross-outs and revisions.
Our hostel, which advertised weekly
steak-centered barbecues, told us the
events had been discontinued due to
the high price of meat.
Food is one of Argentina's main
exports, with soy and grains among
the biggest crops along with the
trademark beef. And while some
farmers have benefited from the
high global prices, the same prices
have trickled down to create a huge
problem for food consumers. The
president, Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner, decided to try and fix this
problem by heavily raising taxes on
exports. But in a country where the
economy is driven by agriculture,
raising taxes on farmers led to mas
sive strikes and the resignation of the
finance minister. The dilemma re
mains unsolved: keep domestic
prices low at the cost of the economy,
or deal with the hungry poor as the
economy grows with high world
prices?
So can the United States dodge
the bullet? It seems almost in
evitable that some prices will go up,
even if not as catastrophically as
elsewhere. Equally important, can
our government help relieve the cri-

sis? With high oil prices, a financial
sector struggling to recover, people
losing their homes in the foreclosure
mess and our military involved in
two wars overseas, helping feed the
hungry elsewhere might seem like a
low priority.
Yet food should also be a key part
of the domestic and international
policy of the United States and other
rich countries. British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown already knows this.
"Hunger is a moral challenge to each
one of us as global citizens, but it is
also a threat to the political and eco
nomic stability of poor nations
around the world," he said last week,
according to the Washington Post.
Congress recently allocated more
money to international food aid. so
there has not been a complete failure
to respond. But the remaining popu
larity of ethanol is a huge step in the
wrong direction. Even though the
price of corn on the world market is
at nearly an all-time high. Congress is
essentially giving farmers extra
bonuses to produce even more of it
(for even bigger profits) but only if it
is not used for food. This is ludicrous.
In the words of Peter Timmer. the
food economy expert, "there is no
way the rich countries can play a
leadership role in bringing this crisis
under control as long as they insist
there is plenty of food for people,
livestock AND automobiles. There
just isn't."
Maybe some new awesome tech
nology is just around the corner and
there really is no need to panic.
Maybe having blind faith in human
innovation is enough to deal with
food shortages, electricity shortages
and global warming. "Faith," said
Martin Luther King Jr.,"is taking the
first step even when you can't see the
whole staircase." Not only do we
need someone to take a real first step
— like cutting farm subsidies — but
it would be nice to have a clear idea,
as King did, of where the staircase is
going.

Has McDonald's raised prices yet? Let
