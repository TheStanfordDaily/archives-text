# Stu's Views
## Admit Weekend is insane 
### 
Back in senior year of high
school, when I saw that big
white-and-red envelope with
'Congratulations!' across the front,
I started to jump up and down.
It was to my surprise, then, that at
Stanford's Admit Weekend I found
myself on the brink of going to an
other school I didn't particularly
like. I know I made the right decision
to come to Stanford, but Admit
Weekend was one of the worst expe
riences of my life. Many fellow
ProFros, I have learned, shared this
experience. Says one friend at Stan
ford, "I absolutely hated Admit
Weekend. I think the 'Camp Stan
ford' quality of admit weekend was a
huge turn-off." Another student told
me she wanted to go to Stanford her
whole life and Admit Weekend near
ly convinced her against it.
In 2004, Sarah Ball published an
article in the Washington Post at
tacking Stanford's Admit Weekend.
This article attracted a great deal of
negative publicity for Stanford.
Ball, who declined to be interviewed
for this column, criticized the "glitzy
packaging, superficial presentation
and the ever-peppy salespeople"
and the immediate sorting of stu
dents into different minority,gender
and sexual orientation groups. This
disillusioned her so much that she

chose to go to Duke. My experience
at Admit Weekend two years later
was similar.
Ball's editorial touched a nerve
at Stanford, and the negative public
ity did induce some superficial re
forms to Admit Weekend. But as the
sting of Ball's editorial fades. Admit
Weekend has again become what
she and other students hated so
much. Ball criticized the sorting of
students into ethnic groups almost
immediately upon arrival, observ
ing, "various ethnic groups are en
couraged to stick to their own." The
number of class-wide events is
frighteningly small, while the num
ber of events targeted at narrow
groups of students is growing.
This year's iteration also had at
least ten hours of dorm program
ming. One's experience at Admit
Weekend is remarkably dependent
on his assigned dorm, which limits
interaction with students outside
the 10-30 others assigned to the
same residence as you. The attitude

of the HoHo's (most of whom seem
like RA's-in-training) can be any
where from "peppy" to "terrifyingly
enthusiastic." Admit Weekend
should give prospective students an
opportunity to meet as many others
ProFros as possible. Instead.
HoHo's seem intent on recreating
their own insular dorm experience
at NSO, replete with flags.
If Stanford wants to attract a
more diverse range of students.
Admit Weekend needs serious re
form. Instead of the rah-rah booster
ism of dorm cheers and matching t
shirts, we should give ProFros an
ample amount of time to interact
with students uninfected with rabid
enthusiasm. Dorm-specific events
should give way to more class-wide
events so students can meet hun
dreds, rather than tens, of their peers.
While the parents are shuttled off
to Palo Alto for a fine Chinese or Ital
ian meal, students are in their third
hour of icebreakers back at the dorm.
There is no organized system for stu
dents to get to Palo Alto even once
during their stay. Students are not en
couraged to go. Ridiculous. Insane.
Admit Weekend suffers from
some limitations that prevent it
from portraying a totally accurate
picture. Pretending that college
doesn't have alcohol, for example, is

a huge impediment to giving stu
dents a picture of what Stanford is
really like. As another friend said of
the generally egregious and egre
giously sober "HoHoPalooza," "It
was one glaring example of how
much Stanford invests to convince
its admits that it has a social atmos
phere, hut it reeks of trying too hard.
Admits ... grind with random 18-
year olds for 3 hours. Perhaps it's


Stun- Boimel
meant as a preview of the social
scene that awaits."
One Admit Weekend coordina
tor. speaking about students who
don't fit in at Admit Weekend, sug
gested. "We don't want them any
way" or "they don't belong here." a
response that seems to be shared by
many students.To suggest that some
students who were admitted don't
belong at Stanford smacks of the in
sularity and arrogance that many
students at Admit Weekend find so
unattractive. Students that don't
buy the"Camp Stanford" atmos
phere might not pick Stanford be
cause they are so put off by the lack
of seriousness. Stanford is serious
about academics and achievement
and careers; to pretend otherwise to
make the school seem more fun is
dishonest.
Admit Weekend is run by stu
dents who love Stanford and can't
seriously imagine that ProFros

would want to go elsewhere. In
stead of giving students the infor
mation to make a good choice be
tween colleges. Admit Weekend
seems wholly focused on making
Stanford seem great to students
who already are committed. But
some are considering other presti
gious schools, and don't we want
those students too? The planners
and organizers of Admit Weekend
need to recognize that some high
school seniors have to make a diffi
cult decision and must be willing to
engage those students on the merits
of that decision.
Admit Weekend forces on stu
dents a dominant image of Stanford,
or what the organizers and involved
administrators think Stanford is. By
putting off some students, Stanford
is sacrificing diversity for the unifor
mity of Camp Stanford.
