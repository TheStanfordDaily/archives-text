University must honor
promises to janitors
To the editor,
One year ago, Stanford students,
workers and community members
went on a hunger strike for a real liv
ing wage policy at Stanford. April 20,
2008 marked the one-year anniver
sary of the end of the fast, which
came after a week of negotiations be
tween the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) and University
administrators.
Major strides were taken in creat
ing a just living wage policy for our
campus's workers. For example, the
policy now covers all temporary and
casual workers, and has been extend
ed to employees at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center.
Although these changes repre
sent great progress, a clause exclud
ing unionized workers from the liv
ing wage policy remains. As a result,
more than 200 workers, including the
ABM janitors who clean educational
facilities, make less than the living
wage. This exclusion remains an
issue; just yesterday, the group Jus
tice for Janitors organized a rally in
the Oval in support of these exclud
ed employees.
SLAC was willing to end the fast
despite the administration's refusal
to lift this restriction because the
University agreed to create a "Pre
ferred Contractors List," consisting

of subcontractors that agreed to pay
all of their employees — unionized
or not — the living wage.
According to the agreement, all
University contracts would be
awarded to contractors on this list,
unless there is a compelling non-fi
nancial reason to do otherwise. Ef
fectively. this list would secure a liv
ing wage for unionized subcontract
ed workers not guaranteed one else
where in Stanford's labor policies.
The Preferred Contractors List
was to go into effect on September
Ist, 2007. It is now April 2008. After
multiple meetings with the adminis
tration, in which SLAC urged the
University to follow through with the
list agreed upon at the end of the fast,
it has yet to be posted.
A supposed "Preferred Contrac
tors List" has recently been added to
the procurement office's Web site.
However, to be included on this list, a
contractor need only meet the living
wage policy's minimum require
ments, which do not cover unionized
workers. This list is redundant (every
employer must agree to these terms
to secure a contract), and referring to
it as a "Preferred Contractors List" is
disingenuous.
We call on Stanford to honor its
word and implement the agreed
upon Preferred Contractors List im
mediately.
