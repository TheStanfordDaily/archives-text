## A 						world without waste Nick Enge 
### 
The chair in which I write this
column is a toxic conglomera
tion of mixed plastics, several
unknown alloys of metal, cardboard,
grease and polyurethane foam
soaked in carcinogenic flame-retar
dants. If the intention of my anony
mous chair designers was to pollute
my indoor environment and create
twenty pounds of un-recyclable
waste, they've certainly succeeded. If
it was to provide a place for me to sit,
they could've done better.
My chair is a classic example of
"cradle to grave" product, an artifact
designed to have a brief life at the
lowest cost to the manufacturer and
customer, regardless of the waste and
environmental impact.Though creat
ed from the highest-quality steel and
plastic, my chair, with all of its valu
able aggregate materials, is destined
for a landfill. As an eco-conscious en
gineer, even if I attempted to recycle
the metal and plastic in my chair, the
best I could do is "downcycle" it —
turn the unidentified plastic into plas
tic lumber, and make low integrity
junk from the mixed metals.
Consider how different this life
cycle is from what a monkey sits on: a
tree branch, the product of an elegant
combination of seed, water, carbon
dioxide and soil. After its useful life

providing services for monkey and
tree, the branch is decomposed di
rectly into the same basic building
blocks of life: water, carbon dioxide
and soil.
The basic biological nutrients pro
duced by this decomposition may then
be reused for a myriad of other local
purposes. Instead of downcycling or
trashing "waste," nature "upcycles" it
by eternally reusing nutrients without
degrading their quality — the life
cycle of a tree branch is"cradle-to-cra
dlenot "cradle-to-grave."
Let's consider how a chair in the
future will be made.
As dictated by the great Truth-in-
Labeling Act of 2015, each chair is la
beled with a prominent ingredient
list, and seeing as my local Environ-
Mart carries only cradle-to-cradle
products, each chair's list will include
at most four or five easily recogniza
ble compounds: steel, high quality
non-toxic plastic, an organic uphol
stery fabric and several plant based
dyes. In fact, every time I shop at En
viron-Mart. I am astonished by the
overwhelming diversity of options
made from so few materials, but so
too am I amazed when in nature I see

such diverse wonders, made mostly
from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
In 2030, my eco-chair is still going
strong, but I'm in the mood for some
thing a bit snazzier. So I load the eco
chair into my electric car, and drive
not to the dump, as I did with my toxic
chair in 2007, but back to my local En
viron-Mart. At a window labeled
"Upcycling Return." a helpful neo
hippie takes the chair off my hands,
and presents me with store credit for
the value of the steel, plastic and or
ganic materials I just returned.
From there, my chair is transport
ed to the local manufacturer, who dis
assembles it into its component steel,
plastic, and organics, and feeds each
high quality material straight back
into the manufacturing process —
the steel and plastic are melted down
and recast, the organics composted
and used to nourish new upholstery
fiber at a neighboring organic farm.
The manufacturer is thus able to cre
ate a new chair, using only my re
turned materials.
Back at the store, I pick out a new
chair of the latest 2030 style and
apply my store credit to the purchase,
effectively paying only the cost of
labor, recycling energy and trans
portation.
In a hypothetical world with con
stant population, cradle-to-cradle
manufacturers could provide a con
stantly evolving supply of stylish re
placements without ever depleting
resources or creating wastes, simply
by recycling everything.There would
be just as much economic activity in
the chair market, just as many chair
making jobs, and as much diversity
of design as there is today, but the
whole system would create zero
waste, zero pollution, zero health ef
fects and zero resource depletion.
That's a chair on Which I 'd be proud
to sit.
