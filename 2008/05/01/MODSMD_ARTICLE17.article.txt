## OUSTED BY AGGIES 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Six outs. Just six more outs. 'Hint's how
many Stanford had to get when it headed into
the bottom of the eighth inning leading UC-
Davis 8-6 yesterday. Instead, for the second
consecutive game, the Card gave up the go
ahead run on the road in the bottom of the
eighth inning and failed to score in the top of
the ninth as it dropped a 10-8 decision to the
Aggies.
In Santa Clara on Monday, it was a solo
homer that broke a 9-9 tie. Last night in Davis,
it was a series of little things that all added up
to one big number: four. The Aggies (27-16)
didn't get anything more than a single, but
managed to score four runs in the eighth to
turn a 6-8 deficit into a 10-8 lead, and all of it
came before a single out had been recorded.
The end result: No. 3 Stanford (25-15-2)
gave up 10 runs for the third straight game and
is now on its longest losing streak of the year at
three games.
But a lot happened before that frustrating
eighth inning. Indeed, there was time for a lot
to happen in a game which lasted just two min
utes shy of four hours.
Stanford got on the board first in the second
inning when freshman Jake Schlander deliv
ered a two-out double to drive in senior Randy
Molina and freshman Colin Walsh,making the
score 2-0. Davis answered back quickly,
though, and jumped on Card starter senior
David Stringer for four runs in the second in
ning.
Davis's Kevin James hit a two-run single to
tie the game and Scott I leylman singled right
after him. Stanford center fielder Sean Ratliff
misplayed the ball, allowing James to score and
Heylman to set to third. Ryan Royster was the

next batter and drove in Heylman with a single
to make the score 4-2. Stringer was able to get
out of the inning after that,but his day was over
after just two innings pitched,five hits and four
runs (three earned).
Davis added another run in the bottom of
the third to make it 5-2, but the Cardinal bats
opened up in the next two frames. Stanford
jumped back ahead 6-4 in the fourth inning,
which included a Joey August triple.a RBI sin
gle by Walsh and a two-RBI knock from junior
Jason Castro.Two more runs were added in the
fifth to make the score 8-5, but that was all the
offense Stanford would get.
Freshman Danny Sandbrink had pitched
three strong innings in relief of Stringer when
Royster launched a homerun to lead off the
sixth inning. That blast made the score 8-6 and
marked end of the night for Sandbrink. Anoth
er freshman, Alex Pracher, shut down the Ag
gies in the rest of the sixth and seventh, before
handing it over to fellow freshman, closer
Drew Storen.
Storen was never able to find a groove. Fac
ing Royster to lead off the eighth — who came

into the game 11-for-12 in stolen base attempts
— Storen induced a groundball to short where
Sehlander charged in to make a nice pick, but
stumbled trying to hurry his throw to catch the
speedy Royster.
"I knew Royster has a lot of speed." said
Sehlander. "The ball had some weird spin on it
and got into my feet. I tried to hurry it but 1
think he would have beaten it out anyway."

third base. Hie bases were loaded, and Jake
Jefferies delivered a two-run single to tie the
game at eight. Kyle Mihaylo singled two bat
ters later to make it 9-8 Davis.
Junior Blake Hancock came on in relief.
After allowing the tenth run to score on a wild
pitch, he got all three outs without allowing an
other run to score. Stanford was unable to get
a hit in the ninth, but did send the tying run to
the plate after junior Cord Phelps was hit by a
pitch with two outs.
With Castro, who leads the team with 42

RBIs, waiting on deck and representing the go
ahead run. junior Jeff Whitlow lined one sharply
towards left field, but Heylman was there at
short and made a nice leaping catch to rob Whit
low and put the rally to bed.
Storen took the loss, falling to 1-3. The win
went to Andy Suiter (2-0) while Justin Fitzger
ald picked up his team-leading eighth save,
tying him for the single season record at UC-
Davis.
