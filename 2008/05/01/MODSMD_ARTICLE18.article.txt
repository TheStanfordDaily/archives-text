# Stanford comes up short at Pac-10s
## No. 11 Cardinal comes in fifth at Pac-10 Championships 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Facing rough wind conditions and a difficult
golf course, the No.l 1 Stanford men's golf team
finished fifth with a 22-over score of 1444 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships yesterday
at The Meadow Club in Fairfax, Calif. The Cardi
nal finished the first two days of the tournament
in the top spot hut gradually fell in the third and
fourth rounds, due partly to high wind speeds and
bad luck.
"1 think that obviously we were disappointed
that we didn't play better," said head coach Con
rad Ray. "[The] wind conditions and golf course
were really difficult."
No. 2 Southern California finished the tourna
ment in a tie for first with No. 29 Arizona State
with a 15-over par score of 1,435. The Trojans
managed to beat the Sun Devils in the tiebreaker
on the 18th hole. 21-23, to take the Pac-10 title.
Third and fourth place were also hard fought with
California with an 18-over 1.438 only edging out
N0.3 UCLA by one stroke to take third.
Senior captain Rob Cirube concluded his last
Pac-10 Championships with a bang as he led his
team the whole tournament. I le finished the final
round yesterday in a three-way tie for third place
with a cumulative one-under score of 283. Even
though he was unable to participate in the prac
tice round due to a touch of the flu, he rallied
back from his sickness to end day one on a high
note in the No. 1 spot individually after firing a
four-under 68. Staying consistent and competi
tive, he finished his final Pac-10 round with a two
over 73.
"We've relied on Rob so much this season,"
coach Ray said. "Everyone gets shell shocked
when he's not himself, but he really came back to
play well for us. 1 le had a great chance to win the
individual tournament today, but he had a double
bogey on the 17th hole that made the difference.
Despite all that, it was a great week for Rob and
he made a good showing. Iliis is a great cap to an
awesome year for him."
Sophomore Jordan Cox stepped up his game
and finished in a tie for 21st place with a six-over
score of 290 for the tournament. Cox. like many
other golfers, had a tough time adjusting to the
wind conditions in the third round which put him
in a tie for 24th. Luckily, he did not let the bad
weather get to him, finishing the final round at an
even par 71.
Just two strokes behind his sophomore team
mate was No. 16 freshman Sihwan Kim. Though
he started out slow with an 11-over 224 that put
him in a tie for 43rd after the first three rounds,
Kim finally became accustomed to the high level
of competition and the difficulty of the course to
blast a 3-undcr score of 68 in the final round
which put him in a tie for 24th overall.
Freshman Steve Ziegler had a strong showing
for his first Pac-10 Championship, ending yester
day's rounds in a tie for 27th with a nine-over
score of 293. Ziegler was on fire on the first day of
the tournament, posting a two-under 140 for the
first two rounds. I le also was able to get a hole-in
one on the 11th hole of the second round. He
found himself slipping when the winds picked up

Stanford finished in fifth place at the Pac-10
Championships after coming into Tuesday's third
round atop the leaderboard. The Card will now
look forward to the NCAA Regionals on May 15.
for the third and fourth rounds but still made it
into the top 30 individually.
Junior Dodge Kemmer significantly con
tributed to the Cardinal's success posting a one
under 70 for the first round and two-over 73s in
the second and fourth rounds. He had trouble in
the third, leading him to score the nine-over 80
that put him in a tie for 38th overall.
Rounding out the Stanford six was junior
Daniel Lim. Lim finished up the tournament with
a 17-over 301 for the tournament, which put him
in 51st place in the individual standings.
Coach Ray was optimistic about the conclu
sion of the Pac-10 Championships and hopes that
playing at such a high level will give his golfers
more experience and confidence going into the
NCAA Regionals in mid-May.
"We have a young team," coach Ray said. "We
just need to be more consistent. I am looking for
ward to some of the younger guys stepping up
into leadership roles like Daniel and Dodge. Sih
wan had a tough week but came back strong in
the end. Cox also played well. We have all of the
tools we just need to put it all together to earn a
great finish."
The Cardinal is guaranteed a spot in the
NCAA Championships but must wait until the
field is announced to find out where it will be
playing and who it will be facing. After capturing
the national title at NCAAs last year, Stanford
has high hopes as it looks to defend its champi
onship.
