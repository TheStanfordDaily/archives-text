# Barte takes over for Card
## 
### BY ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman 1 lilary Barte of the Stanford women's tennis
team has certainly put on a show for the Cardinal fans.
In just her first year with the program, Barte is 27-6
overall with a 20-3 dual match record.She is 16-2 against
Pac-10 opponents and 18-4 against nationally ranked
players.
Most impressively, Barte was the owner of a 19-match win
streak, which included 17 straight wins at No. 1 singles spot.
Barte finds herself in the company of former Cardinal players
such as Amber Liu. Laura Granville and Marissa Irvin.
"It's pretty humbling," Barte said. "It's pretty cool."
Standing at just 5-foot-5. Barte is no giant among the likes of
Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

But with the support of each teammate and coach rallying be
hind her every match, Barte has been a force to reckon with in
women's tennis

"College tennis is differ-

ent from juniors or high school."
Barte said. "The team aspect
makes it so much more gratifying

to win, because you're winning for

more than yourself. You're winning
for your team, you're winning for

your program and you're win
ning for your coaches."

Prior to
Stanford. Barte was already
making a name for herself,
playing in the singles quali-

fying and doubles main
'draw of the 2007 US.
Open.

"I took my

senior year [of high
school] off to play for a

while," Barte said. "I was
testing the waters to see

what it was really like
out there."

But on a re-

cruiting trip to
Stanford, the team
swayed Barte to
play on the Farm.

"Jen [Yen] and
I were watching

them play Washington,"
Barte said. "I was sitting

here meeting the diehard
fans and they didn't know I
was coming. I got a good
feeling from the team.
"Just sitting in that team

room, I knew 1 wanted to come
here," Barte said.
Since then, Barte and the
Cardinal squad have gone hand
in hand.
In the team's surprising

loss to Cal in February. Barte
dropped her match to C'ristina Visi-

"Just sitting in that team room, I
knew I wanted to come here."
— HILARY BARTE, Freshman

Co. Upset over the loss. Barte kept to herself after the match, not
saying a word.
"After we lost to Cal, I was pretty upset about it — we all were
about the loss," Barte said.
But at dinner that night, sophomore Lindsay Burdette came
to Barte's side.
"Lindsay came up to me,didn't say anything, I hadn't said any
thing to anyone and she gave me a huge hug." Barte said."lt was
just what I needed. I didn't need her to say anything.The team has
done that throughout the season — we've been there for each
other."
After that loss. Barte was put into the No. I spot in the lineup.
She would not lose for another two months.

Following the road trip to Washington, senior

Celia Durkin picked Barte up after her

first wins at number one.
"One day after the Washing-

ton trip,Celia came

up to me and told me. 'Hey, you're
doing a great job. It's a lot of pressure

up there. Just keep doing what you're
doing,"'she said.

With the team behind her. Barte has grown as a tennis player
and as a person.
Her success can he attributed to a newfound calmness on the
court, conferred by head coach Lele Forcxxl and Burdette. her
doubles partner.
"I've learned to stay calm," Barte said. "It's more important
than anything not to panic — there's never any reason to freak
out on the court. We were in the car once and we asked Lele,
'Don't you ever panic?' She said, 'No, panic is going to war, panic
is getting bombed.'
"I think Lindsay is actually pretty wise, even though she's just
a year ahead of us," she added. "She gives me great advice when
we're out there playing doubles. She keeps me calm and we play
well together."
Since late February. Barte has gone on a tear, winning 19
straight matches, 15 of them against ranked opponents.
"My most memorable moment was acing Riza [Zalameda] to
clinch against UCLA," she said of the streak.
But at the Pac-10 Championships in Ojai, Barte strained her
shoulder against Cal's Claire Ilcinkas. She would have to forfeit
the match, her first loss in two months, and was rushed to the hos
pital for an MRI.
But again, her teammates were there to pick her up when she
needed it the most.
Fortunately, the NCAAs are in two weeks time, giving Barte
the chance to heal up and represent Stanford in the tournament.
Dubbed "The Flash" by assistant coach Frankie Brennan,
Barte represents the young nucleus of a Cardinal squad looking
to reclaim the national title. Although Barte has accomplished
plenty individually this season, it won't be possible without the
whole squad.
"I love my team," she said.

clinch against UCLA," she said of the streak.
But at the Pac-10 Championships in Ojai, Barte strained her
shoulder against Cal's Claire Ilcinkas. She would have to forfeit
the match, her first loss in two months, and was rushed to the hos
pital for an MRI.
But again, her teammates were there to pick her up when she
needed it the most.
Fortunately, the NCAAs are in two weeks time, giving Barte
the chance to heal up and represent Stanford in the tournament.
Dubbed "The Flash" by assistant coach Frankie Brennan,
Barte represents the young nucleus of a Cardinal squad looking
to reclaim the national title. Although Barte has accomplished
plenty individually this season, it won't be possible without the
whole squad.
"I love my team," she said.
