## Bookstore looks to offer reusable bags Two sophomores push for environmentally friendly bags 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Future Stanford students may have
another option for toting their purchases to
and from the Stanford Bookstore if a stu
dent-initiated project to sell reusable bags is
realized.
According to Stanford Bookstore
Director Stacy Zapko, the idea for replacing
plastic bags with an environmentally friendly
option was discussed at various times by
Bookstore administrators, but the true
momentum came from undergraduates
Bethany Wylie '10 and Rachel Kraus '10.
"We just emailed the manager of the
Bookstore and proposed our idea," Wylie
said. "She said it was really cool and said that
she wanted to get started as soon as possi
ble."
According to Wylie. the Bookstore is
using its own supply company to produce the
bags. The material for the bags has currently
not been decided.
According to Zapko and Kraus, cloth and
recycled plastic bottles are being considered.
Kraus claimed that, because of significant
time delays between manufacturing and
implementation, the bags will be introduced
next year.
"It takes three weeks for them to get the
bags done," Wylie said. "Not that many peo
ple will be around during the summer to see
them."
The organizers of the initiative would ide
ally like to see the complete phasing out of
non-reusable bags at the Bookstore, but they
acknowledged that a significant usage reduc
tion is probably a more realistic goal.
"Initially, the reusable bag will be selling
exactly at cost," Zapko said. "You can get the
free plastic bag if you need the bag. but these
will be offered as an alternative."
In order to increase awareness, the
Bookstore is sponsoring a competition for
the design that will be displayed on the bag
with a $250 prize for the winning entry.
While the original deadline is tomorrow,
the contest organizers are planning to extend
the deadline by one week. Submissions are
currently being accepted at the Bookstore
customer service desk.
"There are some great designs so far,"
said Bookstore Marketing and Event
Planning Manager Michele Carson. "It's
exciting."
Bookstore administrators see the bags as
part of a greater measure to curtail the
Bookstore's environmental footprint.
According to Carson, cashiers have been
trained to ask students whether or not they
want a bag. Zapko said that the University is
also planning to introduce measures that
emphasize recycling of bookstore products.
"We are getting ready to place plastic bins
in the front of the store so that people can
bring their plastic bags to recycle," Zapko
said. "Green is our future, and that's where
we're headed."
