# Housing allowance, six-year contract offered to lure Dawkins to Stanford
## Coach's salary below top level 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coaching basketball at Stanford is no
easy task.
New men's basketball head coach
Johnny Dawkins will have a relatively
small pool of players he can recruit
because of the University's high admission
standards, but will compete in arguably
the nation's toughest basketball confer
ence.
And for his efforts, Dawkins will likely
earn far less than the market rate.
San Jose Mercury News sports writer
John Wilner told The Daily that, based on
accounts from several coaches who were

offered the head-coaching job over the
last several weeks, Dawkins will earn
approximately $800,000 to $900,000 next
year excluding incentives.
While Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
disputes the accuracy of these numbers, he
told The Daily that Dawkins' salary well
exceeds the average salary of a Stanford
professor — about $173,000 according to
the American Association of University
Professors — but does remain below the
going rate for a top basketball coach.
"Our institution has adopted a philoso
phy of not having our coaches be among
the highest paid employees at the
University," Bowlsby said, calling this a
"laudable position."

"I don't think any of our coaches or
administrators are being paid at the top
level nationally," he continued.
Wilner estimated that the normal
salary for a top basketball coach with
NCAA tournament experience is in the
$1.5 to $2 million range. Former coach
Trent Johnson, now at LSU, will earn at
least $1.2 million next year. Bowlsby has
told reporters that he thought Johnson
would double his salary with the move to
LSU.
"1 do think that, for those who might
move here with money as the motivation,
or those who have the opportunity to get
a lot more elsewhere, we are going to lose
people sometimes," Bowlsby said.

Further complicating the math behind
coaching compensation at Stanford is the
high cost of living in the Bay Area.
"We try and work through it with hous
ing allowances," Bowlsby said. "We have
acquired properties that we allow people
to live in. we have rent subsidies."
Dawkins will not he receiving on-cam
pus housing from the University, but will
be given a housing allowance, Bowlsby
said.
To lure Dawkins away from Duke,
where he has been an assistant coach for
11 years, Bowlsby offered the new coach a
six-year contract. Bowlsby confirmed that
all six years are guaranteed.
"He's in a very secure situa
tion," Bowlsby said. "He's moving
a young family all the way across
the country and he's taking on a
big job and a job that is in some
ways more difficult due to the rel
atively small pool of people who
meet the admissions standards. We
certainly want to take the long
view on that sort of thing."
Bowlsby emphasized that how
the coach fits in at the University is
very important.
"There are only a few universi
ties around the nation that can lay
claim to being an institution simi
lar to Stanford, and he happens to
come from one," Bowlsby said. "I
think we hired a person that fits
hand and glove with Stanford."
Working around the various
constraints of a Stanford coaching
job makes for a very difficult hiring
process, and Bowlsby said that he
had to be creative to land
Dawkins.
"We've tried to be as innovative
as we can, and we were successful,"
Bowlsbv said.
