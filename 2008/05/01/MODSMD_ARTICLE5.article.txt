## New plans to affect housing Changes made to draw procedure, residences 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
The deadline to enter the housing
lottery is drawing closer, and students
will face a number of changes in the
process this year.
According to Executive Director
of Housing Rodger Whitney, at the
end of Autumn Quarter 2008,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial will
he closed for a nine-month renova
tion project. The project will culmi
nate in the dormitories becoming
undergraduate buildings, part of the
Housing Master Plan.
"Graduate students in these
buildings will be reassigned to
Munger and other University
assigned housing." he said. "But
|theyj will be guaranteed the same
rent for the remainder of their
Crothers or Crothers Memorial con
tract."'
Whitney said that additional
housing will be provided at low cost
to replace the options lost when
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
I lalls are closed to graduate students.
"These will include renovation of
the Blackwelder Apartments into
two-bedroom efficiency apartments,"
he said. "We also will be adjusting
rents for some apartment types to be
sure we are meeting the needs of
graduate students who depend upon
the low cost option of Crothers and
Crothers Memorial."
Director of Housing Assignments
Sue Nunan said in an email to The
Daily that Xanadu will also be closed
in the fall.
"Xanadu is undergoing renova
tion this summer and autumn and is
not a choice for autumn assign
ments," she said. "Given the past
popularity of this house, this may
change cutoff numbers for other
locations on campus."
The closing of residences is not
the only change to the Draw process.
Perhaps the biggest initiative is the
much touted gender-neutral housing
pilot program option available for
both undergraduate and graduate
students. The program will affect a
portion of rooms in Narnia, Terra,
Castano. Mirrielees and Rains.
A number of more minor changes
will also have an effect on students.
For both undergraduate students
and graduate students, the number of

choices on the housing application
has been expanded from eight to six
teen.
" This increase will allow students
more control of their housing choic
es," Whitney said. "Also, undergradu
ate students now have a single appli
cation deadline of May 4 but will be
able to change their housing location
choices through May 1 l.This is easi
er for students to understand than
having a separate group and individ
ual deadline."
Whitney also said that graduate
students will be allowed to apply in
mixed-gender draw groups and use
group retention like undergraduates
currently do.
Nunan said that modifications to
the Draw process could lead to
changes in demand for certain hous
ing locations across campus.
"Students have sixteen choices,
which could change the demand for
certain housing locations," she said.
"Zapata is changing to its original
configuration of traditional double
rooms in September and Serra is
changing in January. These rooms
were downgraded to singles during
the most intense period of construc
tion on the Munger construction site
but will now be returning to normal
occupancy.This will most likely result
in a change in demand for these
housing locations. The new gender

neutral housing locations may
increase the popularity of some
buildings depending upon demand."
Following this year's housing lot
tery, Whitney said, the University will
remain committed to improving the
process for students. Stanford will
convene a Draw Review Task Force
in the spring to develop "streamlined
housing assignment protocols and
policies for undergraduate students
in support of the Housing Master
Plan."
Whitney will chair this review
committee, and Senior Associate
Vice Provost of Residential and
Dining Enterprises Shirley Everett
will convene the task force.
"The recommendations of the
task force will be implemented in the
2008-2009 draw process," Whitney
said. "The task force will be review
ing topics such as special priorities,
the in-house draw processes, alloca
tion of space in the master plan,
methods to simplify the draw and
new enhancements available
through enhanced technology,
among several other topics."
The deadline to apply for the
undergraduate Draw and get a first
round number is Sunday. May 4 at 6
p.m.
