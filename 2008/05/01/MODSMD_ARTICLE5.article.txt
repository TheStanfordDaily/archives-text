will face a number of changes in the
process this year.
According to Executive Director

end of Autumn Quarter 2008,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial will
he closed for a nine-month renova
tion project. The project will culmi
nate in the dormitories becoming
undergraduate buildings, part of the
Housing Master Plan.
"Graduate students in these
buildings will be reassigned to
Munger and other University
assigned housing." he said. "But
|theyj will be guaranteed the same
rent for the remainder of their
Crothers or Crothers Memorial con

Whitney said that additional
housing will be provided at low cost
to replace the options lost when
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
I lalls are closed to graduate students.
"These will include renovation of
the Blackwelder Apartments into
two-bedroom efficiency apartments,"
