## Obama supporters canvass Democratic primaries 
### ALAN GUO 
Although the California primary is long
over, a few students from the Stanford
community are still directly engaged in the
ongoing nomination process of the
Democratic Party, particularly Ohama
supporters.
Three students left campus this week to
work on the Obama campaign in Indiana:
Jonathan Jourdane '08, Sean Augenstein
and Dan Berkenstock. both graduate stu
dents in Aeronautics and Astronautics.
In the week prior to the Pennsylvania
primary, six students flew out to partici

pate in the Obama campaign effort there.
Angelina Cardona '11 and Sarahi Padilla
'11 shared their experience canvassing in
Pennsylvania with The Daily.
The students were both in Philadelphia
for about a week. While Cardona can

"I was in West Philadelphia, which could
be considered the lower income part of the
town," Cardona said. "They were all over
whelmingly for Obama. So the issue wasn't
persuading voters to want him. it was just a
matter of persuading them to go."

She worked with a team to canvas in
West Philadelphia to drum up support for
the Illinois Senator in the days leading up
to the primary.
"Day-to-day, we knocked on doors, we
had literatures for them, we had door
hangers with number to call if they have
any question about voting, or if they need!
a ride to polling," Cardona said.
Padilla worked in the campaign office
from 8 a.m. to about 2 a.m. each day.
"1 was usually sorting out the data [col
lected by canvassers]. 1 usually worked in
the office." she said. "A lot of times when
we were pressed for time, we would leave

one person in the office, and everyone
would go out to canvass."
While Padilla acknowledged it was not
easy to make it through eightcen-hour
workdays for a week, she was determined
to help out as best as she could.
"We have a saying in the campaign
called 'fierce urgency of now.*" Padilla
said. "You have to feei this 'fierce urgency'
and when you feel it you can just keep
going."
Padilla. who has been involved in the
campaign in five states, said she feels moti-
