## Leaning forward: The segway's Emerging role
### SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN 
Moving through the hospital
corridors, no one ran up to
Dr. Peter Poullos to tell him
he couldn't be on his Segway, or to de
mand why he doesn't just walk or to
ask to see some proof of his disability.
Yet these demands, and worse, have all
happened before. Poullos is a radiolo
gy resident physician at Stanford Hos
pital. In July of 2003, he was riding a
bike in San Francisco when he had an
accident that threw him over his han
dlebars and injured his spine. He can
walk, but not for long without assis
tance. Poullos. and thousands of others
nationwide, have recently discovered
that the Segway is the perfect mobility
aid. But the story is more complicated
than that: the Segway is challenging ac
cessibility laws, medical marketing and
attitudes about new technology. Poul
los' story encompasses all these things.
After his accident. Poullos spent
months in therapy, and gained the abili
ty to walk short distances, but eventual
ly his recovery plateaued. He was given
a wheelchair to get around so he could
get back to work. He hated using it. Peo
ple stared, he felt confined and the chair
drew huge amounts of attention to his
disability. He recalled people from the
physically disabled community trying to
teli him that getting around this way
was not worse, just different.
"Well it is worse," he said. "It's a hell of
a lot worse, and your body doesn't work,
and you need this thing to get around, and
I 'm sorry: it simply is not as good as being
normal and able-bodied. The closer you
can get to that, the better."
Something had to change. Late one
night, watching the Travel Channel
with his wife, a show came on called
"Accessible Adventures." One seg
ment showed people using Segways in
travels all over the world.
"It was only a short section of the
show." he recalled. During that short
section, it became clear that Segways
were an option that might work for
him. He thought. "Oh my God. this is
an incredible idea." He bought his Seg
way and has never looked back.
When he first started using it at
work, some people in the hospital ap
proached him about whether he was
allowed to be using it there. Mostly, the
people complaining were not in au
thority. Once, a nurse started harassing
him about getting off his Segway in the
hospital cafeteria.
"She ended up walking up to my
friends who I was talking to and asking
them if I was really handicapped," he
said. "Totally inappropriate stuff."
Such reactions finally drove Poullos
to action. On Feb. 17. he published an
op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle
about how the Segway has trans
formed his ability to get around and
the negativity he has had to face for it.
Of course, not all people are antag
onistic; many people find the Segway
really exciting. They ask him where he
got it. how it works. At work, his col
leagues' reactions have been over
whelmingly positive: "Anyone who's
familiar with my injury sees me on that
and they're like. 'Oh, perfect! That's
exactly what you need. Why didn't we
think of this beforehand?"'
A disability like Poullos' becomes
almost invisible on a Segway. He ap
preciated this invisibility so much that

he was reluctant at first to use the
handicapped placard, hut the hostility
he faced as a young man cruising on his
Segway forced him to do so. Still, he
doesn't feel as disabled as he did in the
wheelchair. He has also noticed a shift
in his peers' perceptions.
"Nothing's really changed physio
logically and yet their perception is
that I've made this huge improve
ment." he said. He can talk in a group
without feeling forgotten, and he can
hold his wife's hand when they walk to
gether.

Poullos' story is similar to many
heard by Jerry Kerr, one of the
founders and the current president of
Disability Rights Advocates for Tech
nology (DRAFT). His belief in the
benefits of Segwavs for people with
disabilities caused him to start the ad
vocacy organization. Founded in 2003,
DRAFT has worked everywhere from
San Francisco's Mayor's Office to the
Federal Department ofTransportation
to craft legislation that allows for the
use of this device for the disabled. Kerr
has given lectures and presentations all
over the world, emerging as the leading
authority on the use of Segways by
people with disabilities.
In his paper "People who have Dif
ficulty Walking and the Segway," Kerr
sites extensive research on all of the
benefits of using the Segway and other
technology that follows the principle
of "universal design" — simple and in
tuitive to use. He documents all of the
maneuverability and balancing advan
tages. and the psychological benefits.
He also notes numerous physical ben
efits — better balance, strengthening
of the muscles and bones in the leg and
improvement of circulation, digestion
and breathing. With modifications that
add a seat to the device, it is a possible
mobility solution even for people who
cannot stand. The Segway "integrates
people into society, it gets people out,"
Kerr said. "That's one of the greatest
things in the world."
But the use of Segways by people
with disabilities is not that simple.
When Dean Kamen invented the self
balancing technology used in the Seg
way, he also used it for the iBOT, a
wheelchair that can go up stairs. Kerr
explained that Johnson & Johnson
bought the medical rights to this tech
nology, and funded the process of get
ting FDA approval for the iBO T as a
medical device. Segway LLC reserved
rights for the commercial use of th 6
technology. The iBOT is now an ap
proved device that is prescribed by doc
tors and costs insurance companies
$20,000. The Segway is sold commer
cially at around $5,000.
Because it has not gone through the
grueling approval process to be certi
fied as a medical device, the Segway
cannot legally be marketed to people
with disabilities. Steven Steinberg, one
of the owners of Segway of Oakland,
said that his contract includes a clause
stating that he cannot market directly
to that demographic. "Segway doesn't
want the liability." he said.
Yet however they hear about it. dis
abled people are finding their way to
the Segway. Steinberg said that a third
of their Segways are sold for mobility
assistance, while another third are used
for police and security forces, and the
rest for the general public. In fact, two

of his employees have multiple sclero
sis and use the Segway as their mobility
aid.
Segway shows no inclination to mar
ket the Segway as a mobility aid. Carla
Vallone, a Segway spokeswoman, told
The New York Times in 2004 that dis
abled people are "sort of like an un
sought market for us at this point — a
market we did not seek to retain or
build, but it has come about on its
own." Part of the resistance to pursu
ing this market might stem from the
concern that doing so would saddle the
device with the stigma of disability, ru
ining its broader appeal.
Kerr notes that the general appeal
of the Segway has not been over
whelming in any case. All of Segway's
initial hype was greeted with a resound
ing thud when the device came into the
market in 2003. For the first few years,
the company struggled to survive. It de
veloped its own kind of stigma — lazi
ness, extravagance and nerdiness. This
contributed to Poullos' predicament —
he was ridiculed and criticized, not for
being disabled, but for being a seeming
ly healthy young man who chose to
travel on a Segway. Though it caused a
smaller stir than originally expected,
Kerr said. "People are finding out that
it really is changing the world, but for a
different group of people."
The lack of targeted marketing
means that many people inadvertently
stumble onto the idea of using the Seg
way as a mobility device. Instead, advo
cacy is now helping to spread the word.
A program DRAFF recently started
called Seg4Vets awards donated Seg
ways to wounded veterans coming
back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Since
veterans have done much to spur ad
vancements in disability rights, the
hope is that this program will honor
their service, while helping to advance
the idea of Segway as a mobility device.
So far they have awarded 81 Segways
to disabled veterans and hope to award
another 250 by the end of 2008.

Legally, the use of Segways as mobil
ity aids has always been protected by the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Seg
ways are used both recreationally and as
medical aids, so the regulations regard
ing their use are similar to those govern
ing the use of guide dogs — the prohibi
tion of dogs inside buildings is vofd if the
dog is aiding someone with a disability.
Susan Mizner. the director of the San
Francisco Mayor's Office on Disability,
explained that, as it stands now. if a dis
abled person riding a Segway on a San
Francisco sidewalk is stopped by a po
liceman, they are not required to have a
handicapped placard or any documen
tation proving a medical condition —
they are taken on their word.
Yet Segways have a long way to go
before they gain recognition as a legiti
mate aid for the disabled. Despite their
protection under the ADA and advoca
cy work, private facilities still have
complete authority to regulate use.
Walt Disney World recently caused an
outcry by banning the use of Segways in
its parks, citing safety issues. A suit was
filed against Disney, but a Federal
Judge dismissed it because none of the
plaintiffs had evidence they were plan
ning to visit the park. Poullos has also
run into this problem in hotels and pri
vate shopping centers. Until a suit chal
lenging these policies succeeds, ban

ning Segways is the private facility's
prerogative.
The hostility directed at people with
disabilities who use Segways is not lim
ited to private regulation — it also
comes from fellow citizens, which Poul
los' experiences make clear. One com
ponent of this attitude is a general lack
of awareness. The possibility that Seg
ways could be mobility aids is still en
tirely under the public's radar. After his
injury, the Segway didn't even occur to
Poullos as an option because it was
never suggested that it might serve that
purpose. The specific need that it meets
— for people who can stand but have
trouble walking — represents a cate
gory of disability that many people neg
lect to consider.
"Most people don't ever think of the
nuance of someone who can walk, but
not that far, or someone who can walk
far but not that fast, or somebody who
needs to alternate between walking
and a wheelchair to get around," Poul
los said. The Segway fills a need that no
specific device has filled before, and it
may take quite a while before the idea
really begins to spread.
However. Poullos' op-ed and similar
pieces have made a real contribution to
the awareness effort. His op-ed has
been reprinted in the Stanford Report
and linked from numerous blogs. Kerr,
who met Poullos and corresponded
with him by email, found his article to
be incredibly exciting.
"All that Peter says exists out there,"
he said. "For him to write about it is
wonderful because people who took
the time to read it and understand
might perhaps change their mind,
change their attitude."
At Stanford campus, some regulato
ry changes might come out of his article
as well. Rosa Gonzales, the director of
Stanford's Diversity & Access Office,
had never heard of the Segway as a mo
bility option before reading Poullos' ar
ticle. Her office works with the Depart
ment of Public Safety and Parking and
Transportation Services to react to dis
ability needs that arise on campus. She
imagines that in the next few years they
may create policies specific to Segways.
"We'll probably come up with a pro
tocol or a guideline for their use, most
ly so that people who do need them —
students, staff, faculty — aren't being
harassed," she said. That might include
a registration similar to the one set up
for golf cart use on campus. "I think it's
terrific and hopefully will open up
worlds to a lot of people."
What is the future of Segways as a
mobilitv aid? "1 think the use
