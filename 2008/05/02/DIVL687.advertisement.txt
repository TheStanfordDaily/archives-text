Write code.
Mostly Python. (Some Squeak and Lua.)
No Python experience required ... as long as you can learn it quickly.
Get paid.
And have fun. I'm an MIT grad and "parallel entrepreneur" looking for a
boatload of summer interns to crank out code for 3 different projects.
This summer.
Near Boston, MA. Live out in the suburbs to be close to work; take the
commuter rail into Boston if you need more excitement on weekends.
And beyond?
I'm also looking for at least one 2008 (or earlier) grad to continue the
momentum beyond the summer.
Use Croquet or similar metaverse tool to build a cutting-edge 3D
environment for kids age 6-9 to learn a second language.
Other tasks include machine learning, information extraction, and misc.
slicing & dicing of textual and numeric data to present on the Web.
