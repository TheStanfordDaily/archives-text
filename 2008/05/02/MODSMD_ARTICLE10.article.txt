## Stanford reaches out to community partners Over 140 freshmen sign up for Community Partnership Day 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford hosted the first day of its second bien
nial Community Partnership Program on
Thursday, a two-day event that will take more than
400 Stanford faculty, staff, students and alumni
from inside the Stanford bubble to reach out to the
surrounding communities.
"The goal is to engage the Stanford community
with local organizations in the hope that they will
form a longstanding partnership and appreciation
of the value of volunteerism," said Anna Wilson,
event coordinator of the Community Partnership
Program.
After debuting in April 2006 as a one-day event
held in alternating years with Community Day —
a free University open house designed to bring
Stanford's neighbors on campus — the Office of
Public Affairs decided to expand this year's pro
gram from one to two days to accommodate the
large turnout of volunteers and organizations. With
over 400 volunteers, this year's turnout was double
that of 2006.
"The biggest difference is that this program
involves more people, so it is becoming a true com
munity partnership program," Wilson said. "We are
working more with the community by looking at
what they need and how we can help. We have also
expanded the variety of volunteer opportunities
including a wider range of interests, from new envi
ronmental projects to assistance projects for the
elderly and homeless in our community"
The surge in participation can be attributed to
the efforts of Frosh Council and its idea to collab
orate with Stanford Events to organize and a fresh
man day of service called the O-Leven Day of
Activism. Over 140 freshmen signed up to volun
teer as part of the program, which represents a
marked increase over the last time the program
ran in 2006, when only 10 students participated.
A total of 40 percent of the volunteers this year
are students.

"When the possibility to
pair with Community
Partnership Day arose, we
jumped at the chance,"

said Zachary Warma
'11, a member of

Frosh Council who
spearheaded the

creation of a
class - w i d e
community *
service project.
"This is the very

first time in recorded
memory that the
freshman class has
attempted such an
ambitious project."

"It really means a lot
knowing there are
people in the
community who care

Koren Bakkegard, director of New Student
Programs, said that she was impressed by the ener
gy and commitment of the Frosh Council organiz
ers and hopes that an event centered on a day of
service will become an annual fixture for Frosh
Council for the Class of 2012 and beyond.
"The opportunity to study and work at Stanford
is a privilege, and we have an obligation to
acknowledge that," Bakkegard said. "Participation
in Community Partnership Day is one way to

begin to recognize the responsibility we have to
others.
"Freshman participation is especially important
since they are at the beginning of their relationship
to Stanford and the communities that surround
Stanford," Bakkegard added. "1 believe it's quite
unusual, and commendable, for the Class of 2011
to be participating in Community Partnership Day
as a class and not simply as individuals."
Participants will be volunteering with a broad
array of organizations such as Abilities United, the
Boys and Girls Club of the Peninsula and Save the
Bay to work on issues ranging from health care
and homelessness to the environment.
Linda Chin of Abilities United, a non-profit
serving Bay Area residents who have developmen
tal and other disabilities, said that having Stanford
volunteers not only helps the organization finish
projects that reach beyond its budget but also
helps to boost the morale of both staff and clients.
"It's really wonderful to have the Stanford vol
unteers come," Chin said. "It is heartwarming to
know that people from the community will give up
a day to make a difference to an organization like
ours.

years and I think having Stanford
volunteers not only boosts the
morale of our staff but enriches the
lives of our clients," Chin added. "It
really means a lot knowing that
there are people in the community
who care."
Though the two-day volunteer
efforts have been beneficial to com
munity organizations, volunteers
believe that this program has the
potential to extend beyond its two
day duration and encourage volun
teers to continue their service.
Peter Davis '11, who was the
project leader for an event at St.
Anthony's Padua Dining Room on
Thursday, said that he and the other
Stanford volunteers received an
amazing response from all of the
volunteers there and are motivated
to continue volunteering over the
next few months.
"Many of the volunteers at the
event felt so inspired and excited by
the work they did that many are
considering volunteering regularly,"
Davis said. "St. Anthony's needs all
the help they can receive, and each
of us was touched by what we saw
and our experience. I'm sure that
many of us will go back — I know 1
will — and help in any way we can."
Warma said that this event was
important not only for the communi
ty but for Stanford students because
it enabled them to expand their hori
zons beyond the Stanford bubble.
"I personally feel blessed that I
get a chance to spend four years of
my life on this incredibly gorgeous
campus," Warma said. "As 1 see it.
we dishonor both ourselves and this
institution if we are not working to
help others who perhaps have not
been so fortunate as us."
