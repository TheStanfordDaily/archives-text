## Candidate disputes slate election conduct 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 2008 ASSU Elections
may be well over, hut a dispute
between the two junior class
presidential slates over use of the
Class of 2010 email list is yet to
be resolved.
During last month's elections.
The Giving Tree sent out a state
ment to the Class of 2010 email
list informing students about the
class presidents' accomplish
ments. Because The Giving Tree
was running for reelection,
Ocean's Oh-Ten interpreted this
as a campaign violation. In
response. Ocean's Oh-Ten sup
porters sent out a statement to
email lists criticizing The Giving
Tree's actions.
Cameron Drake '10, a current
sophomore class president and
member of The Giving Tree slate,
which lost its bid for reelection, is
still upset with the conduct of the
winning slate. Ocean's Oh-Ten,
and the response of the Elections
Commission.
"We still have yet to receive a
formal apology, and I won't stop
until we receive it," Drake said.
"In this apology, the other slate
has to acknowledge that they
lied. An objective party is going
to have to acknowledge that they
lied and what they did was wrong
because those are the facts."
"Until that is a known fact, I
am not going to rest. I don't care
if I have to go put fliers around
campus myself," he added.
Drake first tried to pursue the
matter with Judicial Affairs, but
he was told that it was up to the
Elections Commission to deal
with the conflict.

"Because the Elections
Commission is put in place to
govern [elections]. Judicial
Affairs won't get involved,"
Drake said. "I may not be done
taking this up with the Election
Commission."
But working with the
Elections Commission to address
his concerns may not be easy for
Drake, who has been vocal in his
criticism of the body.
"The Commission is a great
thing in practice, but it has obvi
ously done a poor job," Drake
said. "It failed me and it failed
our slate. The Commission really
cripples the victims and leaves no
recourse. Everything is supposed
to be handled by the
Commission, and because they
didn't do their job when they
were supposed to, there is no
avenue to pursue this."
Since it will not be possible
for the Elections Commission to
change the results of the election,
which was certified by the
Undergraduate Senate several
weeks ago, Drake instead intends
to concentrate on reforming the
system.
"I am going to lobby the best
I can to see that things are
changed," Drake said.
Current Elections
Commissioner Ryan Woessner
'10 is already taking steps to
ensure that this year's events do
not repeat themselves in the
future.
"One of the new things I will
do is work on the specific areas
of the rules talking about incum
bents and talking about slander
