## Editorial Board Admitting mistakes 
### 
The newly-admitted Class of 2012 has
the distinction of being the first Stan
ford class to use the Common Appli
cation and of being the first class required to
fill out its application online.
Iliese revisions to the admission process
are well-intentioned steps in the wrong di
rection. As a unique cojlege, Stanford ought
to have a unique application. The Office of
Undergraduate Admission should revert to
the old Stanford-specific institutional forms,
and students should once again have the op
tion of submitting their Stanford applica
tions by paper.
The Common Application is a standard
set of application forms used by 315 member
colleges. Among its members are Harvard.
Princeton, Yale and, now. Stanford.
Stanford does require applicants to fill
out a special Stanford supplement to bolster
the Common Application. The most impor
tant parts of the application, however, in
cluding the teacher recommendations and
the long essay, are now beyond Stanford's
control.
For example, Stanford's old application
asked teachers to assess an applicant's "en
ergy" and "warmth of personality," qualities
that Stanford should seek out in its candi
dates. The current application does not ask
such questions.
The quality of the long essay prompt has
also suffered. Applicants to Stanford's Class
of 2010 had to select from these two choices:
• "'A picture is worth a thousand words," as
the old adage goes. Include a photograph
or picture that represents something im
portant to you. and explain its signifi
cance."
•"As you reflect upon your life thus far.
what has someone said, written, or ex
pressed in some fashion that is especially
meaningful to you?"
Nowadays, Stanford applicants choose
from six prompts such as:
• "A range of academic interests, personal
perspectives, and life experiences adds
much to the educational mix. Given your
personal background, describe an experi
ence that illustrates what you would bring
to the diversity in a college community, or
an encounter that demonstrated the im
portance of diversity to you,"
• "Topic of your choice."
The old questions were more inspired
and hearkened to applicants' depth and per

sonality.
Other changes are more subtle. In the
past, the Stanford application provided fewer
spaces than the Common Application for stu
dents to list their extracurricular activities. In
this way, Stanford encouraged high school
students around the world to join a healthy,
sane number of clubs and after-school activi
ties. Now Stanford's hands are tied in this re
gard by 314 other member colleges.
When asked about the switch to the
Common Application last year. Dean of Un
dergraduate Admission Richard Shaw told
The Daily that it "provides wonderful access
for students." I le lauded the Common App's
"convenience" in a presentation to the Fac
ulty Senate. This is all true. Indeed, the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admission deserves
high praise for making the admission
process more accessible. Admission officers
are now recruiting more heavily in inner-city
schools, and Stanford's financial aid pro
gram has received a much-needed boost.
But. in a bid to lure in even more appli
cants through the use of the Common App
(as if 23.956 were not enough), the Faculty
Senate and the Admission Office have
stripped Stanford's application of its teeth.
At the most basic level, this is a bad trade.
Stanford is an uncommon institution. It has
no need for a common application.
Also last year came the Admission Of
fice's decision to drop paper applications.
Unless a student has a disability or lacks In
ternet access, and unless that student has ex
plicit permission from the Dean of Admis
sion, he or she has to submit an online appli
cation. This change is misguided.
The Common Application Web site is un
wieldy and difficult to use. But underlying
the switch is a more fundamental problem.
By forcing students to apply online, the Ad
mission Office is forcing students to use a
medium plagued by phishing scams, online
traffic monitoring and. in some countries,
outright censorship. Electronic systems are
liable to glitches and hacking, and applicants
may have legitimate concerns about submit
ting their personal information online.
The solution is simple. Any applicant who
wants to fill out a paper application should
still have that option.
Change is not always good. Dean Shaw
and the Faculty Senate should return Stan
ford to a better time, a time when the Uni
versity had more flexibility in preparing its
application and when its applicants had
more flexibility in filling it out.
