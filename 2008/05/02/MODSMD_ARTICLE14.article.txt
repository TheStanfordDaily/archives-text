## The
						real world 
### 
It's funny what we make TV shows out of
these days. Gone are The Jetsons, a sym
bol of an era in which TV shows were
clearly false. In its place is Reality television,
whose intent is to depict our everyday lives
not in Technicolor but in the full visible spec
trum. Perhaps the first reality TV show,The
Real World, is the best example of this shift.
Its title alone suggests that it has some claim
to objective truth, but it proceeds to set its
episodes in well-outfitted mansions in exot
ic locales. Although they market it as an inar
guable truth. The Real World is obviously
false. Add to that the cast of reality TV
wealthy heiresses, high-strung models and
strung-out rock stars, all masquerading as
everyday people.
'Ihe fact of the matter is that TV is false,
was false and always will be false. But, 1
would like to add to these misuses of "real"
the perennial claim that students at Ameri
can colleges don't know what it's like "in the
real world."
This Real World to which people so often
refer usually involves some kind of money
making. In fact, one of the ways to tell if you
are in The Real World is if you have to fend
for yourself and pay the bills with the spoils
of your hard labor. The Real World is de
scribed as cold, unforgiving and uncaring.
My mental image of The Real World is a
dusty alleyway, a dirty trench coat thrown
over the shoulders of a homeless man. "In
the Real World, no one is going to hold your
hand." they claim.
Forget for a moment all the people out
there working easy jobs, sitting comfortably
in a middle management position with du
ties that consist chiefly of pretending to do
work all day. Forget for now the fact that
most people enjoy a supportive network of
relatives and friends that, given extreme cir
cumstances, would come to their aid. But
still, some insist this Real World exists, and is
a Very Frightening place.
Furthermore, The Real World involves
considerable responsibility, accountability
and various other -bilities that we as college
students arc supposed to lack. I don't know
about you, but the myth of "growing up,"
with all of its alleged maturity and rationali
ty, was burst for me some time ago.The idea
thatTYue Adults cannot be irresponsible, im
mature and ignorant is blind, at best.

Talk of ITie Real World goes hand in
hand with talk of the Stanford Bubble —
due to our geographic location, and the na
ture of modern academic life, students at
Stanford are unable to understand Real Life
issues.
I won't be the first to say it, but yes, the
Stanford Bubble exists. But do you know
what else exists? Other bubbles. Many, many
other bubbles. I currently reside in a bubble
inside a bubble inside a bubble. I go to Stan
ford University. Stanford University is locat
ed in Northern California. Northern Califor
nia is in California, and California is in the
United States, which is itself in the Western
hemisphere.
Just because my school's bubble is more
identifiable than yours doesn't mean yours
doesn't exist. Any claim that I don't under
stand The Real World is simply the claim
that I haven't visited your personal bubble
yet.
I will grant you: I am in a unique position
in my life right now, provided for financially,
intellectually and emotionally. I live in a
super suburb of sorts, with no crime besides
the occasional theft of GPS devices. Any
claim that I'm not in a peculiar situation
would be patently false. But the error that is
often made is the comparison of my current
situation to a supposed norm — we are all
biased by our own worldview, geographical
ly. culturally and monetarily, at the very
least. And as a result, you have no more
claim toThe Real World than I.the homeless
man in the alleyway or even MTV.
Let's lay off of "reality" for a while, and
focus on a more important word: bias — in
the real Real World — exists. It's realer than
MTV could ever imagine.
