## Lax in league final again Cardinal women gunning for fourth straight MPSF title, regular season vengeance against Denver tomorrow 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford women's lacrosse avenged one of its
two conference losses yesterday in an 11-8 win
over Cal in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF)Tournament semifinals at Memori
al Stadium in Berkeley.Tomorrow, the team will
try to make up for its other loss when it takes on
Denver in the finals.
Tied 4-4 at halftime. the Cardinal came out
with two quick goals — one from sophomore at
tacker Claire Hubbard and the other from senior
attacker Daphne Patterson — in the first five
minutes of the second half to take a two-goal
lead that it would not relinquish.
"It was good to get some revenge today," said
sophomore Dana Lindsay, who had a goal and
assist in the team's victory. "I think it was just a
lot of fight from everybody. It wasn't our pretti
est game. With Cal being such a huge rivalry it's
always vicious. 1 think everyone stayed com
posed under all the pressure they threw at us."
"It's always our
goal to be best
in the west."

senior goalkeeper
"It was just awesome," said senior midfielder
Megan McClain. "It was great for our team to
come together and beat them on their home turf.
It was a really emotional win. It's great to beat
Cal."
Freshman midfield Karen Nesbitt was the star
for the Cardinal yesterday, recording a hat trick.
Sophomore midfield Julie Christy also had two
goals to lead the Stanford attack.
"I think we've learned a lot over the course of
the season," said senior goalkeeper Laura Shane,
who had 13 saves on the day. "We knew it was
gonna be physical going into the game with our
big rivals. We were more ready for that this time
and just stayed tough the entire game.
Yesterday's victory over the Golden Bears set
the Cardinal up for tomorrow's final against the
Pioneers. A possible NCAA berth will be on the
line; if Stanford wins, it will have a shot at quali
fying for the NCAA Tournament through an at
large bid. That said, a win does not guarantee a
berth — the primary concern of the team is win
ning the conference for the fourth year in a row.
"In terms of [the] MPSF [Tournament), it
would just be so great to win it again this year,"
Lindsay said. "The seniors have won it the past
three years so it would be nice for them to go out
with a kind of dynasty in the conference ... It
would really be nice to keep the conference in
our name."
"Winning MPSF four years in a row would be
something really nice for us to go out on," Shane
added. "It's always our goal to be best in the west
so that would definitely be nice. Making the
NCAA Tournament would be a huge step for us

Stanford made up for one of its league losses by defeating archrival Cal in the MPSF semifinals yesterday. Tomorrow, the team gets another
crack at Denver, the only other team that beat the Cardinal in the conference, in the finals. Stanford is trying to win its fourth straight MPSF title.
but we're gonna worry about Den
ver first."
The No. 17 Pioneers certainly
won't be an easy opponent. Denver
had little trouble with Oregon yes
terday, putting up 18 goals on the
Ducks in the team's 18-12 victory.
The team is 13-5 on the season and
went undefeated in conference
play. The Cardinal and Pioneers
clashed nearly two weeks ago on
April 20, and despite Stanford
jumping out to a 4-0 lead, it was
Denver who went on to win the
game, 13-9.
"We are really looking forward
to avenging that loss," McClain
said. "They are a very aggressive
team so we're gonna have to hold
our own and fight back. We just
need to go strong for a whole 60
minutes."

"Denver's a great team, they're
very athletic," Lindsay said. "If we
can keep the tempo in our favor
and just play composed lacrosse
then we should be great."
Tomorrow's match-up with
Denver will take place at 1 p.m. at
Cal's Memorial Stadium.
Win or lose, however, the Cardi
nal women were able to reflect on a
season that has been filled with ups
and downs. Wins over Penn (now
ranked No. 1 in the country) and
Notre Dame have been the high
lights, although the team has strug
gled at times.
"We definitely had some rough
stretches of the season but in the
past few games we've gotten to
playing to how we know we can,"
said Shane, who might be playing in
her final collegiate game this Satur
day "We're just looking to finish
strong at [the] MPSF [Champi
onships]."
