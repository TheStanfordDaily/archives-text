## BCS commissioners vote no on football playoff 
### RALPH D. RUSSO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HOLLYWOOD, Fla.— Even a
three-game playoff was too much
for the BCS. Bowl Championship
Series officials rejected a plan
Wednesday to turn the much-criti
cized system for deciding a national
champ into a playoff involving four
teams, starting in the 2010 season.
The BCS format will remain the
same until at least the 2014 season.
"After a very thorough, very
good discussion among the group,
we have decided that because we
feel at this time the BCS is in an un
precedented state of health, we feel
it's never been healthier during its
first decade, we have made a deci
sion to move forward in the next
cycle with the current format." At
lantic Coast Conference commis
sioner John Swofford said.
During five hours of meetings,
Southeastern Conference commis
sioner Mike Slive presented a plan

for a plus-one format, matching the
No. 1 team in the nation against No.
4,and No. 2 vs. No. 3 in the marquee
howl games. The winners would
meet about a week later in the BCS
title game. The plan also called for
creating a sixth BCS game.
In the end. only the SEC and
ACC wanted to even continue the
discussion of the plus-one.
"I'm not unhappy," Slive said
after those meetings with the 10
other conference commissioners at
a resort hotel.
"There's no such thing as stand
ing pat. I think we've done a service
(by presenting the plan for a plus
one). We owed the fans and media
an explanation as to why we're not
moving ahead.
"I can't say I'm surprised.There
is a bit of disappointment."
There was no vote taken, thp
commissioners said, but the leaders
of the Big East, Big 12, Pac-10 and
Big Ten made it clear they didn't
want to move the BCS toward a
playoff in any way.
in the current BCS format, the
top two teams in the BCS standings
— which use polls and computer rat
ings to grade teams — after the reg
ular season are matched in the title
game.
The idea behind the plus-one is to
alleviate some of the controversy by
sending four teams into the postsea
son with a chance to win the national
championship.
The BCS has two years left on its
current four-year, $320 million TV
deal with Fox.
The decision to shelve the plus
one came as no surprise. It was a long
shot to survive, at best.
Coming into the meetings, Big

Ten commissioner Jim Delany and
Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen
had said they were opposed to the
seeded plus-one format Slive was to
present.
On Wednesday, Big East commis
sioner Mike Tranghese and Big 12
commissioner Dan Beebe, for the
first time, made it known publicly
that their leagues also were against
even the smallest possible playoff.
"There's a strong sense in that
room of the slippery slope view that
there's never been a collegiate or
professional playoff that's stopped at
four teams," Delany said.
Tranghese said he favored an un
seeded version of a plus-one, which
would set the championship game
matchup after the four major bowls
are played using the BCS standings,
over seeding the top four and play
ing them off.
"The seeded model looked like a
playoff, and we don't think a playoff
is in the best interest of college foot
ball," he said.
The Big Ten and Pac-10's rela

tionship with the Rose Bowl has al
ways been viewed as the major hur
dle to changing the BCS.Tlirns out it
was far from the only obstacle.
College football's leaders are
concerned a playoff would turn foot
ball into a two-semester sport and
lessen the importance of a regular
season that now has a do-or-die feel
to it from week to week.
The Bowl Championship Series
was implemented in 1998 after the
Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl
agreed to join with the other four
major conferences and three mar
quee bowls to create an annual na
tional title game involving the top
two teams in the country after the
regular season.
While the BCS has created cham
pionship games that never would
have happened under the old bowl
system, it's been far from perfect. For
the many college football fans des
perate to see a playoff that would
crown a more definitive champion,
the BCS has been a target for their
angst.

Almost every season, there's
been some dispute leading into the
championship game about whether
the BCS selected the two most de
serving teams.
Undefeated Auburn, from the
SEC, being left out in 2004 in favor of
Southern California and Oklahoma
was what first got Slive thinking that
No. 1 vs. No. 2 might not be enough.
Last year, Georgia fans were the
loudest to complain when the Bull
dogs passed over for the BCS title
game in favor of LSU and Ohio
State.
Of course, Slive's plus-one would
n't have solved last year's problems.
Georgia, which finished second in
the nation in the AP poll behind
LSU, was ranked fifth in the BCS
standings at the end of the regular
season and wouldn't have qualified
for a four-team playoff.
So the BCS will stick with the im
perfect system it has instead of in
stalling another.
"If it isn't broke," White said,
"don't fix it."

season that now has a do-or-die feel
to it from week to week.
The Bowl Championship Series
was implemented in 1998 after the
Big Ten, Pac-10 and Rose Bowl
agreed to join with the other four
major conferences and three mar
quee bowls to create an annual na
tional title game involving the top
two teams in the country after the
regular season.
While the BCS has created cham
pionship games that never would
have happened under the old bowl
system, it's been far from perfect. For
the many college football fans des
perate to see a playoff that would
crown a more definitive champion,
the BCS has been a target for their
angst.

Almost every season, there's
been some dispute leading into the
championship game about whether
the BCS selected the two most de
serving teams.
Undefeated Auburn, from the
SEC, being left out in 2004 in favor of
Southern California and Oklahoma
was what first got Slive thinking that
No. 1 vs. No. 2 might not be enough.
Last year, Georgia fans were the
loudest to complain when the Bull
dogs passed over for the BCS title
game in favor of LSU and Ohio
State.
Of course, Slive's plus-one would
n't have solved last year's problems.
Georgia, which finished second in
the nation in the AP poll behind
LSU, was ranked fifth in the BCS
standings at the end of the regular
season and wouldn't have qualified
for a four-team playoff.
So the BCS will stick with the im
perfect system it has instead of in
stalling another.
"If it isn't broke," White said,
"don't fix it."
