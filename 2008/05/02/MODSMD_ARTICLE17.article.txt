## BCS commissioners vote no on football playoff 
### RALPH D. RUSSO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HOLLYWOOD, Fla.â€” Even a
three-game playoff was too much
for the BCS. Bowl Championship
Series officials rejected a plan
Wednesday to turn the much-criti
cized system for deciding a national
champ into a playoff involving four

title game. The plan also called for
creating a sixth BCS game.
In the end. only the SEC and

one). We owed the fans and media

"I can't say I'm surprised.There

There was no vote taken, thp
commissioners said, but the leaders
