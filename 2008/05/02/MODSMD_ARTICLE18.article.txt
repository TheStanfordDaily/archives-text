Dawkins completes
recruiting trip

up his first recruiting trip as the Car
dinal's head coach, as a "quiet peri
od" barring coach-initiated contact
with recruits started yesterday.
Dawkins left after his introducto
ry press conference on Monday to
visit two of Stanford's committed re
cruits for next year's team, shooting
guard Jeremy Green of Texas and
swingman Jarrett Mann of Delaware.
Stanford's third commit, power
forward Miles Plumlee, asked to be
released from his letter of intent just
before Dawkins was hired and may
be headed to Duke, Dawkins' former
school. WRAL in North Carolina re
ported last night that Plumlee will
sign with the Blue Devils if Stanford
grants his release.
