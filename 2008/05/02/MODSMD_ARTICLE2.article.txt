NOTES: No. 3 Stanford will be trying to
break a three-game skid when it meets
San Jose State for a pair of non-league
match-ups this weekend. Pitchers Erik
Davis and Jeffrey Inman will go for the
Cardinal, which has surrendered 10 runs
in each of its last three games. San Jose
State's high-average, low-power lineup
will piesent an interesting challenge for
Stanford.

Stanford baseball entered this week
riding the high of a four-game winning
streak and a 10-1 stretch that saw the
Cardinal play some of its best games of
the season. But following Sunday's 10-
9 loss against USC, the Cardinal
dropped a pair of midweek games
against non-conference opponents
Santa Clara and UC-Davis on the
road.
Suddenly, a weekend home-and
home series against non-conference
San Jose State looks to have taken on a
great deal of added significance as the
No. 3 Cardinal (25-15-2, 10-5 Pacific
10) looks to end its streak of losses
against another local rival.
The Spartans (25-18) enter the
weekend showdown against Stanford
with momentum leading in the other
direction, having won two in a row and

nine of their last 11.
There's no doubt the SJSU play
ers will be looking to make a state
ment in the series against a local
rival and, according to the rankings,
a national power. Stanford, mean
while, will need to maintain its focus
in the midst of six non-conference
games before its series with Cal be
ginning a week from today.
Despite three straight less-than
stellar results, the Cardinal has kept
things close in its series finale
against USC as well as in midweek
match-ups with Santa Clara and
Davis, losing 10-9,10-9 and 10-8, re
spectively.
After getting burned by the long
ball against the Trojans and Bron
cos — Stanford pitchers gave up
three homers in each of those
games — a late rally victimized the
Cardinal on Wednesday against the
Aggies. Davis scored four runs on
five base hits, a wild pitch and two
walks, putting them two runs ahead
of Stanford before they ended the
game with a three-up, three-down
ninth in the next half inning.
The Cardinal will likely get help
on the weekend from its two most
consistent starters of late — sopho
more Jeff Inman and senior Erik

Davis. The pair of right-handers
boasts the top two win totals for the
Stanford squad.
Davis has pitched brilliantly
since a rocky start to the year in his
first game against Nebraska, amass
ing a 7-1 record. Davis has chipped
away at an ERA that stood at 8.10
on March 8, bringing that mark all
the way down to 3.75. Perhaps most
impressively, though. Davis pitched
in four straight complete games
from March 29 through April 19 be
fore throwing six solid innings
against USC last Saturday.
Inman, meanwhile, got roughed
up in his previous two starts, allow
ing nine earned runs after throwing
only 3.1 innings.The Stanford soph
omore will doubtless be looking to
get back on track this weekend, but
he still brings a 3.40 ERA and 5-2
record into the two-game set with
San Jose State.
Stanford's pitchers will face a
lineup featuring plenty of solid hit
ters but little pop when they take on
the Spartans. SJSIJ infielders Kyle
Bellows and Corey Valine share the
team lead with three homers apiece.
San Jose State does, however, have
three regular contributors with av
erages above .300, led by infielder

Danny Stienstra, who is hitting .384
with a .441 on-base percentage. Still,
Stienstra's production is emblemat
ic of the Spartans limitations — de
spite amassing an impressive 53 hits
on the year, just eight were for
extra-bases.
Ibe Cardinal is likely to face
Spartan starters Scott Sobczak (4-1,
3.86 ERA) and David Berner (2-5,
4.80) on the mound. Berner has
been the workhorse of the Spartan
rotation thus far on the year, as he
leads the pitching staff with 65.2 in
nings pitched and is the team leader
in strikeouts with 52. Sobczak,
meanwhile, has shown good con
trol. walking just ten on the year
while striking out 37.
The Cardinal will host San Jose
State in a 1 p.m. game at Sunken Di
amond tomorrow before hitting the
road to visit the Spartans for a fol
low-up game on Sunday at the same
time. Stanford will then take anoth
er pair of non-conference oppo
nents on Monday and Tuesday in
Pacific and San Francisco before re
suming conference play next Friday
against Cal at home.
