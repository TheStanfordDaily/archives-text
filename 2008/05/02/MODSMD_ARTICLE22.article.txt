## Editor's Note 
### 
Some people think of May as an idyllic month: the begin
ning of spring, barbeques, summer love and all that is good
in this world. But these people are idiots. For my money,
May is the crabbiest month. On the quarter system, at least,
we've got both midterms and finals to contend with, intern
ships to stress over and, for seniors, every passing moment
just amplifies the death rattle of honors thesis deadlines.
Phooey on you, May. That's why this week Intermission
is celebrating pet peeves: all those little things that get under
your skin. And today, on the eve of the penultimate draft of
my honors thesis, I've decided to procrastinate by ranting
away the pain with a list 0f...
Pet peeves that make me want to punch a nun:
People who lecture me for not voting. I don't get on your
case for not reading poetry, do l?Administrations last for
four years, tops. Art is forever.
Dorm chat lists. Mirrielees, along with being the unofficial
smokers' dorm (seriously, if you need a light, just come over
— even if you can't find a Bic, just wait five minutes and you
can catch a light off of the grease fire that will have inevitably
started in some dumbass's kitchen), is also proud to open

its doors to every student on campus who doesn't under
stand the basic concept of a dorm chat list. Maybe it's just
because we have our own kitchens, but you can't go two
minutes without getting half a dozen requests for butter, bat
teries or the occasional emergency weave removal. Sure,
at two in the morning some of these requests make sense,
but at four in the afternoon?! Come on, guys. They sell this
shit in on-campus stores.
Dorm chat list flame wars. Seriously, Mirrielees. What is
wrong with you?
Wacky fonts. Don't use them. Futura? No. Papyrus? No.
That goofy one that looks like blood is dripping down the let
ters? No. Comic Sans MS? NO NO NEVER NO. Just ...
don't.
People who don't know when to use commas in lists of
adjectives. Bear with me for a sec; this one is pretty esoteric,
but we're adults now. It's time to figure this out once and for
all: when we use a series of adjectives, we must use them
in a certain order. This is one of those things that you know
intuitively but have probably never thought about. Take for
example the phrase: "the tiny new red Italian sports car."
Overburdened but basically unremarkable, right? Now try

saying: "the red Italian new tiny sports car." It sounds a little
ESL.
Generally adjectives are said in the sequence: size, age,
shape, color, origin, material and purpose. (Opinion adjec
tives, like "handsome" or "heinous" are more specialized
and their location in English-speaking sentences is a little
more variable.) That's why "the big old orange cat" sounds
fine, but "the orange old big cat" will get you funny looks.
Anyway, note the lack of commas between adjectives in
these enormous strings? You do not need commas be
tween different types of adjectives. If all of the adjectives
you're using are from difference categories, you're comma
free, baby. You only need commas between adjectives of
the same category. In my experience, people only use mul
tiple "opinion" adjectives, which is why you need commas
for 'the interesting, beautiful, honest girl," but not to describe
"the short young Bulgarian woman."
Don't you feel better having learned something?
People who lecture you about grammar. Sorry, guys.
People who constantly give high-fives. Stop touching
me. Please.
Honors theses. WHY WONT MAY END ALREADY?!
