A pet peeve is a minor annoyance that can instill great frustration in an individual, like constantly humming glam rock outfit Warrant's 19% hit 'Cherry
Pie."

Origin (edit)
The term 'peeve,' referring to something that annoys one a great deal, only came into usage very recently, appearing first as a noun in a 19(H) Washington
Post column. The term is a back-formation from the 14th-century 'peevish,' which referred to the frustration felt when one's roommate chose to listen to a
single derivative rock anthem on repeat. 'Peevish' is in turn derived from the Latin 'perversus.'
Description [edit]
Pet peeves often represent a single outlet for all of the combined frustration contained within a relationship, as when someone one lives with and has got
ten along fine with for months suddenly rediscovers, with so-called ironic' intent, the top-charting pop hits of the '90s. "Listen to this song," this person may
say to the individual while one is attempting to memorize the decarboxylation mechanism. "Isn't this catchy?" This person will in almost all cases be unaware
of the fact that the song they are listening to is nearly identical, in both form and content, to previous smash hits "Pour Some Sugar on Me" and "1 Love Rock
N' Roll." by British hard rockers Def Leppard and American Joan Jett. respectively, neither of which were particularly great songs in the first place. When
one tries to inform him of this fact, he will ignore the individual and begin singing indistinctly along with the chorus, declaring his desire for the "cherry pie"
of the title.
The conflict underlying a pet peeve may involve disrespect, manners, personal hygiene, family issues or unimaginative guitar riffs, and resolution of such
complex issues is often damaging to the relationship in question. When, for instance, one takes one's laptop s extension cord and attempts to strangle one's
roommate as he slouches asleep at his computer, "Cherry Pie" still looping hellishly on his iTunes. it may be very difficult to explain one's motivation's as the
roommate suddenly awakes due to an alien pressure on his trachea. One may justify such an action by suggesting that his head resembled a small wheel of
Gruyere through which one hoped to cut using only the tools at hand, but the use of safer methods from the outset are recommended by those experienced
in the field. Blunt force trauma may prove a s.urer way to silence the insistently musical.
Pet peeves, as the term implies, are very personal in nature, and the offending roommate will often find one's annoyance illogical. This can often be frus
trating to the individual concerned. "Max," the roommate will say. "It's just a song." No, Doug. It's not just a song. It's not a song after it has been played in
cessantly for three weeks. It is every bad decision I have ever made rolled into a nauseating power chord goulash screeched by four neuronal abortions in
matching headbands. It is a particularly ropey strand of bile vomited up by the post-apocalyptic Angeleno fuckscape, already bent over the cultural toilet bowl
after spending the latter half of the 1980s choking down hvpercolor emetics and Arthur Laffer's economic theories. It is the human capacity for sadism encap
sulated, and I want nothing more than to soak it in kerosene and trehuchet it off that highest waterfall I can find, watching it vamp its way lightly up and then
earthwards in a great, orangely flaming huck."
Other examples of pet peeves might include the sound of knuckles cracking, or inconsiderate driving.
