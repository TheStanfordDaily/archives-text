## Most Annoying People at Stanford University 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION ANNOYANCE ARBITRATOR 
The majority of people at Stanford are wonderful, intelligent, caring and insightful individuals. But there are some people who manage to be incredibly irritat
ing. For me, these people tend to fit into one of four categories: insensitive, inconsiderate, incompetent or simply out of touch with reality. Here is my top 10 list
of the most annoying people on campus.
10. People who are in line at Moonbean's for 10 minutes and can't decide what they want by the time they get to the front of the line.

It's a coffee drink, guys. Not brain surgery. It doesn't take that long to get a frappuccino, and some of us have class to get to.
9. The people who go to the Manzanita Basketball Courts to play basketball at 9 a.m. on Saturday.
| Everyone knows that 9 o'clock is sleep time on Saturday mornings, and yet you are happily awake and waking me up with your incessant dribbling and
shouting. If you are that happy to be awake that early in the morning, clearly you are either not working hard enough or not partying enough. Please stop
waking me up.
8. Girls in engineering who ask for help by saying that they "just don't get math."

I he Women's Liberation Movement happened in the 19705, and if you're majoring in engineering, you know how to do math. Pretending to be incompetent
is not cute.

7. People who complain that there is no dating at Stanford but never ask anyone out.
Is this laziness, simple fear of rejection or a sense of entitlement? Either way, get over it.
ft. People who don't make it to the toilet to vomit, making the rest of the bathroom disgusting.

If you can't handle making it to the toilet or at least refrain from puking in common areas, then you v
can't handle your liquor. And if you can't handle your liquor, you don't get to drink. Your mom is not
here, so you need to learn to be responsible.

5. People who like/play/recitc Soulja Boy.
1 have two problems with this. First of all, do you even know what the lyrics mean? If you don't, please
look them up on Urban Dictionary, because they are appalling. Second, almost none of you grew up in an
area where it makes any sense for you to be relating to gangsta rap. And by the way, the students who did
grow up in those kinds of areas don't listen to that nonsense.
4. Environmentalists who make dubious claims.

I love the environment. But if you make illogical statements, you're going to have a hard time getting people on your side.
For example, I recently saw a flyer promoting local eating. The tlyer said that we should buy local because Kenyans only get
17% ol the retail value ol their food. Well, guys, if you only buy local, they won't get any money.

3. People who dismiss the opinions of people without academic degrees.
Sometimes having real world experience is more useful than studying something, and you just sound like an elitist snob.
2. People who try to dismiss the admission of their fellow classmates by saying that they only got in because they were an athlete/underrepresented
minority/poor/had a hardship/were a legacy/had a parent pay off the University.
a
Stop dragging others down out of insecurity. You have no idea why your classmates got in, and if you spend any time at all engaging in this activity, you arc
probably going to get owned by the athlete/underrepresented minority/poor/had a hardship/was a legacy/had a parent pay off the University student sitting next
to you, becausc they aren't wasting their time.

1. Ihe Most Annoying People: Anyone who thinks that this economic downturn simply means that people won't be able

to buy new jet skis for the year, or anyone who thought that just because Obama was overwhelmingly popular on campus

that he would win California.

This is a group of people who are astonishingly out of touch with reality. Do me a favor: Please drive through a
poor neighborhood and talk to working class people. In the real world, economic problems mean that some people
don t get to eat as much. In the real world, most people do not drive BMWs. You are in an economic minority at
Stanford; you are not reflective of the middle class if your parents make more than $200,(MX) a year (in fact you are
in the upper 3%). Go volunteer somewhere and get in touch with the real world, and then feel grateful to be so
blessed and at Stanford.
