## Jerk Kid in the Bank 
### DAN HIRSCH 
April 7,2008
With a twisted upper lip and endless freckles on his high cheekbones, the kid strutted
around the room. Even then, at the ripe age of eight, Jake could discern that this kid, with
the skinny chicken arms, slight snaggletooth and black bowl-cut hair was a strutter, was
someone who had been given things in his life, and could walk around like he owned the
place.
This afternoon in the transition between activities and dinner, Jake could be alone in a
rare moment of down time and freedom and quiet in Bunk 2A. Before the kid had entered,
Jake was drawing. That summer it was knights and dragons: green dragons and knights with
pointed, beak helmets. With a green marker he had been coloring in, a large expanse of
wing stretched out over the white sheet of computer paper and then the screen door
slammed with a clattering twang, and there was the kid. He smelled of dirt, hot pavement,
farts and Laffy Taffy.
The kid stood at the door for a moment by Jake's bed. Jake stopped drawing. The kid
looked down at Jake's paper, his lips contorted in a sneer, his blue eyes un-sclf conscious
ly nosy. Jake brought his paper to his chest and looked at the kid.
"What are you doing?" the kid demanded.
"Nothing," Jake replied.
Obviously losing interest, the kid raised his eyebrows and grunted and crossed the room
to his bed. The colorful New York Mets sheets that had been impeccably tucked in by the
kid's mother on the first day were now a sloppy mess of half-assed hospital corners and pil
lows askew. Their division leaders were always yelling at them during bunk clean to make
their beds perfect; to create crisp corners and neatly stack their pillows. But despite all the
nagging commands of grown-ups, the kid would walk away with a still-messy bed and a
knowing smirk, and mysteriously unscathed by punishments. Jake would watch him as he

went, still trying to get his own olive green flannel blanket to sit smoothly on his mattress.
The kid's oversized white Nikes made a clomping noise as he moved around the room.
He was going from bed to bed looking at his bunkmate's things, picking up so and so's base
ball mitt and then the boy with glasses's stack of Mad Magazine. I le weighed each one in
his hand, momentarily pondering whether or not the item was worth his time and tossed
them off when he decided that, no, his time was more valuable than that. Jake watched the
kid stick a box of someone else's Nerds into his pocket. The kid did not even bother to look
over to see if Jake were watching. Jake looked back down at his drawing, but did not draw.
After more clomping footsteps and a squeak as the kid hopped onto his own mattress
across the room, Jake heard the piercing chime of the kid's Sega handheld start up.
With the chirping and blinging of the lit-up screen emanating from the plastic gadget,
Jake could tell the kid was playing Sonic the hedgehog. They had watched all summer over
the kid's shoulder as he effortlessly clicked his thumbs on the machine's sleek buttons, mov
ing the blue creature through the colorful fantasy world of the little bright screen. They had
all been eager to try their luck at the high speed loopty-loops, the gathering of gold coins,
and avoiding tiny, pixelated bad guys. But no, never once had he said yes to their pleas to
share. Even when it was someone else's birthday, or when the boy with the sprained ankle
couldn't play capture the flag with everyone else. Never. Not once. It was his. why should
he share it with anybody? Jake looked down at his drawing. With the magic silence of the
late afternoon broken by this kid and his toys, Jake's dragon was suddenly plain, suddenly
boring, altogether babyish.
In this summer of spending his days with boys from New Jersey, Long Island and the
suburbs surrounding New York City — boys who did not go to a progressive elementary
schools like him, nor had lesbian babysitters from the local women's college — Jake would
learn the appropriate vocabulary to describe this kid. It would feel awkward on his tongue
at first, but in time he would come to know its simple effectiveness and appreciate the small
strength it gave him. Fucking prick, Jake would learn to say with each syllabic sharp, that
kid is a fucking prick.
