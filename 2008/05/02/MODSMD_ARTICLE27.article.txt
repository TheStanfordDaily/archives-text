# WORST ROOMMATES EVER
## 
### ALSHA WELLS INTERMISSION ROCKIN' ROOMIE 
Look, college students for the most part do three things: eat, sleep and study (and drink, but whatever,
that's not the point). A lot of people would prefer to study and sleep in near or complete silence. The worst
roommate is therefore the one that feels the need to do every little thing in the bedroom while you're try
ing to catch up on sleep: doing homework, rustling papers around, stomping, talking on the phone, turn
ing the faucet on and off for whatever reason, etc.

It's not so much that these actions are annoying in and of themselves; it's that they're being done right
when 1 decide to take a nap. Think of it this way: Living with roommates is entirely based on compro
mise. That's pretty fair, right? So, if I'm tired I basically have only one option, which is to sleep in my
bed (yeah. I could sleep somewhere else, but why find another room when I have my own bed?). You,

on the other hand, have an entire campus (one of the largest ones in the country) in which you can do
homework or talk on the phone. Why must you pick the one place 1 have to sleep in? Think about
these things.

This one really haflles me. It's almost as if you're totally ignoring the fact that someone invented head-i
phones at the turn of the century. Why do you think they made them in the first place? I can assure you that it

wasn't out of boredom. Remember "compromise"? If I'm doing something important like writing a paper worth *
25% of my grade and you want to listen to Lil' John, then bust out your Sonys, Phillips, Skull Candys or whatever

brand soaks up all your cash, and plug up. Some might ask, "Well, what if their music isn't so bad and you actually'
like Lil' John?" This is quite possible, yes, but when I'm writing my paper, do you see me listening to music? Do 1
have headphones on at all? No. Therefore, if I won't even play MY music while I'm studying, and we have similar
tastes, then 1 damn sure don't want hear you blasting yours.

To all the dirty roommates out there, don't pretend like this doesn't apply to you. I'm not even going to lie to you

You're dirty as hell and a massive pain in the ass. First of all. realize that I'm not asking you to spot-clean every five min
utes and compulsively file all your papers; there is a difference between mess and dirt. Mess is generally disorganiza
tion: papers strewn all over the desk, hags littering the floor, books tossed everywhere — anything that doesn't cause
an odor, yet makes the room look like a non-stop after-party hangout. Dirt, by contrast, includes leaving week-old food

out in the open, collecting crusted dining hall dishes, refusing to pick up your dirty socks/underwear, your disgusting

unwashed body — anything that could induce my gag reflex or give me a bacterial infection. So yes, it sucks being
called "dirty" but shove your political correctness. The truth is the truth: You're a slob, and it sucks something

Pet peeves: what an apt subject for Intermission right before the housing
draw, 1 have been waiting for a chance to finally say what all freshmen should
have said to their roommates on move-in day. Between September and now, I'm
sure we've all cursed the fact that we didn't lay the ground rules from the begin
ning, but now we have no choice but to live through the next five weeks as best
we can. By "live through the next five weeks." I mean complain all the things
that piss us off about bad roommates (or so I've heard from other people; my
roommates are actually not so bad. Thanks guys!):

It's because you're coughing up phlegm, sweetheart. And you're not bothering to cover your
mouth or throw away your green, mucous-laden tissues or wipe off the door handles. You're the
human incarnation of Sickness. Yes, with a capital "S". Some people would rather not catch the
plague, and you can probably help them out by staying clean and as far away as possible.

This is another one I don't understand. What's the purpose of kicking out your roommate for an
entire night? You don't have that much stamina. You get half an hour, tops. Isn't that plenty of time
for foreplay and the "bang, bang, bang, skeet, skeet, skeet"? What are you going to do afterwards?
Talk? Please. Understand this: It's really inconvenient to have to find a place to sleep other than the
room to which the University assigned you — even if you have a bunch of friends. So slip it in, slip it
out and then tell your starry-eyed boyfriend/girlfriend to get the hell out.

Latchkey kids are the best, man. They had working mothers growing up, which means they were forced to
do things independently — like wipe their own asses and dress themselves. Latchkey kids know what it's like
to live on their own, and therefore don't think twice about taking out the trash, cleaning their dishes, vacuum
ing, etc. God forbid you get a roommate whose mother was constantly running behind them, cleaning their
messes, and reminding them to make their bed and put their plates in the sink —you know, stuff that only
adults would do themselves. Getting a latchkey kid roommate ensure you've got a hard worker in your domain.
Won't have to tell them twice. The non-latchkey kids...well. I don't know, man. You'd think someone at Stan
ford wouldn't be so lazy as to pile a heap of trash bigger than the city's sewage system. This campus is just full
of little surprises, isn't it?

Oh, this is a big one. Freshmen arc especially prone
to turning into what 1 call "space suckers": people who
basically transport their entire bedroom from home to
campus, forgetting that only half the space is theirs.
They'll bring absolutely everything, including stuff
that's necessary but that they don't use. I've definite
ly gone into a few rooms and seen empty shoe racks
hanging above a waste pile of sneakers, heels and san
dals. Or. there are people who wear the same 10-12 ar
ticles of clothing but have a stacked closet worthy of
its own airtime on MTV Cribs. There's more: crates,
little drawer things you buy from the "dorm needs"
section of Target, space savers (read: they take up
more space than they save), empty bottles of alcohol,
empty boxes (are you really going to put that much
away in storage?), etc. Get rid of that shit. You're a
fire hazard.

To whom this may apply, 1 hope you're cowering in interminable shame. You confuse
me, really. You've got the brainpower to get into this school, and possibly even be really
successful here, yet you somehow can't manage to carry your dirty dishes with you to the
dining hall, or put your clothes on your bed instead of the floor. Is mtelfigence inversely
proportional to common sense? Probably.

ford wouldn't be so lazy as to pile a heap of trash bigger than the city's sewage system. This campus is just full
of little surprises, isn't it?

Oh, this is a big one. Freshmen arc especially prone
to turning into what 1 call "space suckers": people who
basically transport their entire bedroom from home to
campus, forgetting that only half the space is theirs.
They'll bring absolutely everything, including stuff
that's necessary but that they don't use. I've definite
ly gone into a few rooms and seen empty shoe racks
hanging above a waste pile of sneakers, heels and san
dals. Or. there are people who wear the same 10-12 ar
ticles of clothing but have a stacked closet worthy of
its own airtime on MTV Cribs. There's more: crates,
little drawer things you buy from the "dorm needs"
section of Target, space savers (read: they take up
more space than they save), empty bottles of alcohol,
empty boxes (are you really going to put that much
away in storage?), etc. Get rid of that shit. You're a
fire hazard.

To whom this may apply, 1 hope you're cowering in interminable shame. You confuse
me, really. You've got the brainpower to get into this school, and possibly even be really
successful here, yet you somehow can't manage to carry your dirty dishes with you to the
dining hall, or put your clothes on your bed instead of the floor. Is mtelfigence inversely
proportional to common sense? Probably.








Look, college students for the most part do three things: eat, sleep and study (and drink, but whatever,
that's not the point). A lot of people would prefer to study and sleep in near or complete silence. The worst
roommate is therefore the one that feels the need to do every little thing in the bedroom while you're try
ing to catch up on sleep: doing homework, rustling papers around, stomping, talking on the phone, turn
ing the faucet on and off for whatever reason, etc.

It's not so much that these actions are annoying in and of themselves; it's that they're being done right
when 1 decide to take a nap. Think of it this way: Living with roommates is entirely based on compro
mise. That's pretty fair, right? So, if I'm tired I basically have only one option, which is to sleep in my
bed (yeah. I could sleep somewhere else, but why find another room when I have my own bed?). You,

on the other hand, have an entire campus (one of the largest ones in the country) in which you can do
homework or talk on the phone. Why must you pick the one place 1 have to sleep in? Think about
these things.

This one really haflles me. It's almost as if you're totally ignoring the fact that someone invented head-i
phones at the turn of the century. Why do you think they made them in the first place? I can assure you that it

wasn't out of boredom. Remember "compromise"? If I'm doing something important like writing a paper worth *
25% of my grade and you want to listen to Lil' John, then bust out your Sonys, Phillips, Skull Candys or whatever

brand soaks up all your cash, and plug up. Some might ask, "Well, what if their music isn't so bad and you actually'
like Lil' John?" This is quite possible, yes, but when I'm writing my paper, do you see me listening to music? Do 1
have headphones on at all? No. Therefore, if I won't even play MY music while I'm studying, and we have similar
tastes, then 1 damn sure don't want hear you blasting yours.

To all the dirty roommates out there, don't pretend like this doesn't apply to you. I'm not even going to lie to you

You're dirty as hell and a massive pain in the ass. First of all. realize that I'm not asking you to spot-clean every five min
utes and compulsively file all your papers; there is a difference between mess and dirt. Mess is generally disorganiza
tion: papers strewn all over the desk, hags littering the floor, books tossed everywhere — anything that doesn't cause
an odor, yet makes the room look like a non-stop after-party hangout. Dirt, by contrast, includes leaving week-old food

out in the open, collecting crusted dining hall dishes, refusing to pick up your dirty socks/underwear, your disgusting

unwashed body — anything that could induce my gag reflex or give me a bacterial infection. So yes, it sucks being
called "dirty" but shove your political correctness. The truth is the truth: You're a slob, and it sucks something

Pet peeves: what an apt subject for Intermission right before the housing
draw, 1 have been waiting for a chance to finally say what all freshmen should
have said to their roommates on move-in day. Between September and now, I'm
sure we've all cursed the fact that we didn't lay the ground rules from the begin
ning, but now we have no choice but to live through the next five weeks as best
we can. By "live through the next five weeks." I mean complain all the things
that piss us off about bad roommates (or so I've heard from other people; my
roommates are actually not so bad. Thanks guys!):

It's because you're coughing up phlegm, sweetheart. And you're not bothering to cover your
mouth or throw away your green, mucous-laden tissues or wipe off the door handles. You're the
human incarnation of Sickness. Yes, with a capital "S". Some people would rather not catch the
plague, and you can probably help them out by staying clean and as far away as possible.

This is another one I don't understand. What's the purpose of kicking out your roommate for an
entire night? You don't have that much stamina. You get half an hour, tops. Isn't that plenty of time
for foreplay and the "bang, bang, bang, skeet, skeet, skeet"? What are you going to do afterwards?
Talk? Please. Understand this: It's really inconvenient to have to find a place to sleep other than the
room to which the University assigned you — even if you have a bunch of friends. So slip it in, slip it
out and then tell your starry-eyed boyfriend/girlfriend to get the hell out.

Latchkey kids are the best, man. They had working mothers growing up, which means they were forced to
do things independently — like wipe their own asses and dress themselves. Latchkey kids know what it's like
to live on their own, and therefore don't think twice about taking out the trash, cleaning their dishes, vacuum
ing, etc. God forbid you get a roommate whose mother was constantly running behind them, cleaning their
messes, and reminding them to make their bed and put their plates in the sink —you know, stuff that only
adults would do themselves. Getting a latchkey kid roommate ensure you've got a hard worker in your domain.
Won't have to tell them twice. The non-latchkey kids...well. I don't know, man. You'd think someone at Stan
