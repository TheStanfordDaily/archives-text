## Meet Jin Xing: Crosses Her Legs, Comfortable With Contrasts 
### MELANIE REYNARD INTERMISSION XING QUEEN 
Meet Jin Xing, China's most fa
mous modern dancer/choreographer.
On Saturday evening before a packed
audience, a woman in a silky flowing
ruby red dress takes front stage right.
She looks with longing. The music
chimes accents from an Asian garden,
smeared into a Western classical sym
phony. She lifts her chin, reaches up
ward to the diagonal and pours in an
arch over the edge of the stage before
she frees her legs to slowly dial the cir
cumference around her. The woman
is elegant and striking, especially
amid a troupe of eight dancers who
have now entered the scene, wearing
golden togas that obscure their mas
culine and feminine forms. They face
the audience, form various clusters
and perform gentle reaches and leg
swings. Jubilation shifts to dark
melancholy.
Through the first dance "Half
Dream," it becomes clear that Jin
Xing is an artist who is very comfort
able with combining contrasts. The
movement itself is a combination of
soft, limp hands juxtaposed with the
group's overall military-like precision
and the occasional acrobatics. The
crescendo of the music is manifested,
ironically, by the dancers coordinated
kicks from low on the floor.
This comfort with contrasts mesh
es with Jin Xing's life story of strad
dling different cultures and scxuali
ties.

Meet Jin Xing, the most famous
Chinese transsexual. The only son of
Korean immigrants, Jin Xing went on

a hunger strike until his parents
let him join the army to train in
ballet at the age of nine. He at
tained the rank of colonel, won
a scholarship to train in New
York and then, after a sex
change operation in 1995. be
came a model, actress, mother
of three adopted children, wife
and creator of her own modern
dance company.

Jin Xing's dance company's
second piece, "Red and
Black," is a concise crowd
pleaser. The traditional red
fans flash out against stiff,
black traditional Chinese suits.
The pulsing drumbeats trans
fer like voltage through various
clusters until a man in the cen
ter performs a liquid solo,
flashing the red fan as it swirls
around his body. The fan opens
and closes where his torso has
been, as he ducks down and
whips around for a barrel jump
with his knees at his chest.

Movements are held for just a blink,
before the company continues into
the next isolated elbow raise or geo
metric gesture.
For the last piece. "Carmina Bu
rana," we enter a massive Dr. Seuss
nightmare — the dancers walk, or
rather float, in cuckoo-clock like pat
terns. A massive body of 200+ choir

singers overwhelms the back of the
stage, just behind a thick section of the
orchestra. The dancers, with brown
unicorn-like hats, tip forward and lift

bent legs. With brown boxes and
white lace they create a nest, while a
couple performs a rare yet sterile
duet. Even though their groins touch
and they become intertwined on the
floor with her feet beside his cheeks,
there is no tension and their interac
tion is merely a series of poses. They
continue to dance a nonsensical yet
epic story. Opera soloists come on

stage to continue an aria that comes to
us from 12th century monks that
strayed from their disciplines and
wrote songs about drinking.

Overall, the two-hour perfor
mance encompasses many diverse
elements, but the movement itself
never breaks through any ex
tremes. Jin Xing does throw in
some quirks — such as a good
minute in "Half Dream" during
which the ensemble hangs their
heads limp over their chests and
breaks out into a massive flailing
run. However, for the most part
there was minimal explosive ac
tion. Jin Xing's choreography can
be characterized as kind to the
body, careful, contained and de
mure. As one singer chirped in
credibly high notes, the dancers
posed so close around her that
there was a kind of intimacy, but
there were rarely established rela
tionships, no violence and despite
the staging reminiscent of a the
atrical neo-classical epic, there
was no comprehensible narrative.
Meet Jin Xing, the person. Jin
Xing comes out on stage in a white

bathrobe for the post-performance
discussion, as if coming out to her liv
ing room to talk with the audience
"before 1 take my shower." Her white
face is highlighted with a splotch of
red. Jin Xing crosses her legs and
claps graciously toward the audience
with whom "we communicated so
well tonight."

For such a punchy personality, Jin
Xing docs not pretend that her work
is symbolic of a deeper social mean
ing. Jin Xing claims her style is to "Be
simple. Be direct." For example,
halfway through "Carmina Burana"
she reappears on stage with a splotch
of red on her chalky face. "I come on
stage with this red on my face. The au
dience already familiar with the fig
ure. It's only to change the figure.
They think maybe it means she hurt
or blood — no, it's only to refresh the
figure."
While Jin Xing warns us not to
read too much into her artistic choic
es, she speaks candidly about wanting
to be seen not through the "lens of
who is this artist? Who is this transsex
ual?" but rather "who is this person?"
As she crosses her legs and carries on
with the audience, she is proud of her
success but she does not show off. Her
femininity and free spirit are not flam
boyant, but rather forceful. She says,
"1 can't ask for people to under
stand," and instead demands, "Free
dom to be woman, freedom to criti
cize."
In contrast to the provocative per
sonality of its creator, Jin Xing Dance
Theatre's program has not made any
revolutionary statements, nor has Jin
Xing defied any tradition of dance or
music. Even so, when you meet Jin
Xing, you cannot deny her success —
her strength evident from staunch
Chinese roots, crossed with palpable
energy as the Westernized celebrity
embraces her limelight.

es with Jin Xing's life story of strad
dling different cultures and scxuali
ties.

Meet Jin Xing, the most famous
Chinese transsexual. The only son of
Korean immigrants, Jin Xing went on

a hunger strike until his parents
let him join the army to train in
ballet at the age of nine. He at
tained the rank of colonel, won
a scholarship to train in New
York and then, after a sex
change operation in 1995. be
came a model, actress, mother
of three adopted children, wife
and creator of her own modern
dance company.

Jin Xing's dance company's
second piece, "Red and
Black," is a concise crowd
pleaser. The traditional red
fans flash out against stiff,
black traditional Chinese suits.
The pulsing drumbeats trans
fer like voltage through various
clusters until a man in the cen
ter performs a liquid solo,
flashing the red fan as it swirls
around his body. The fan opens
and closes where his torso has
been, as he ducks down and
whips around for a barrel jump
with his knees at his chest.

Movements are held for just a blink,
before the company continues into
the next isolated elbow raise or geo
metric gesture.
For the last piece. "Carmina Bu
rana," we enter a massive Dr. Seuss
nightmare — the dancers walk, or
rather float, in cuckoo-clock like pat
terns. A massive body of 200+ choir

singers overwhelms the back of the
stage, just behind a thick section of the
orchestra. The dancers, with brown
unicorn-like hats, tip forward and lift

bent legs. With brown boxes and
white lace they create a nest, while a
couple performs a rare yet sterile
duet. Even though their groins touch
and they become intertwined on the
floor with her feet beside his cheeks,
there is no tension and their interac
tion is merely a series of poses. They
continue to dance a nonsensical yet
epic story. Opera soloists come on

stage to continue an aria that comes to
us from 12th century monks that
strayed from their disciplines and
wrote songs about drinking.

Overall, the two-hour perfor
mance encompasses many diverse
elements, but the movement itself
never breaks through any ex
tremes. Jin Xing does throw in
some quirks — such as a good
minute in "Half Dream" during
which the ensemble hangs their
heads limp over their chests and
breaks out into a massive flailing
run. However, for the most part
there was minimal explosive ac
tion. Jin Xing's choreography can
be characterized as kind to the
body, careful, contained and de
mure. As one singer chirped in
credibly high notes, the dancers
posed so close around her that
there was a kind of intimacy, but
there were rarely established rela
tionships, no violence and despite
the staging reminiscent of a the
atrical neo-classical epic, there
was no comprehensible narrative.
Meet Jin Xing, the person. Jin
Xing comes out on stage in a white

bathrobe for the post-performance
discussion, as if coming out to her liv
ing room to talk with the audience
"before 1 take my shower." Her white
face is highlighted with a splotch of
red. Jin Xing crosses her legs and
claps graciously toward the audience
with whom "we communicated so
well tonight."

For such a punchy personality, Jin
Xing docs not pretend that her work
is symbolic of a deeper social mean
ing. Jin Xing claims her style is to "Be
simple. Be direct." For example,
halfway through "Carmina Burana"
she reappears on stage with a splotch
of red on her chalky face. "I come on
stage with this red on my face. The au
dience already familiar with the fig
ure. It's only to change the figure.
They think maybe it means she hurt
or blood — no, it's only to refresh the
figure."
While Jin Xing warns us not to
read too much into her artistic choic
es, she speaks candidly about wanting
to be seen not through the "lens of
who is this artist? Who is this transsex
ual?" but rather "who is this person?"
As she crosses her legs and carries on
with the audience, she is proud of her
success but she does not show off. Her
femininity and free spirit are not flam
boyant, but rather forceful. She says,
"1 can't ask for people to under
stand," and instead demands, "Free
dom to be woman, freedom to criti
cize."
In contrast to the provocative per
sonality of its creator, Jin Xing Dance
Theatre's program has not made any
revolutionary statements, nor has Jin
Xing defied any tradition of dance or
music. Even so, when you meet Jin
Xing, you cannot deny her success —
her strength evident from staunch
Chinese roots, crossed with palpable
energy as the Westernized celebrity
embraces her limelight.
