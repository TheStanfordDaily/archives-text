## Because you're brown enough to see this play 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE INTERMISSION RACE RELATER 
In an age where Asian-American public figures are pretty
much non-existent and at a school where approximately 25% of
the students are of Asian descent, it is clear that there is a dispar
ity between the number of Asian voices that exist and the number
of Asian voices actually getting heard. Stanford University Stu
dent Takeo Rivera seeks to challenge this unfortunate reality in
"R&L"— a play that asks the question, "What happened to
Asian-America?" Touchingly acted and creatively staged, every
Stanford student struggling with identity, relationships and just
how to live should make time to see this play.

Directed by Rachel Anderson and produced by Kenneth
Lam Stage, "R&L" is certainly a unique production, unlike a

traditional five-act play. The movements of the actors are not
necessarily choreographed like a dance, but the structure of
the play.does have an old Greek tragedy feel. A chorus
helps to set the tone and mood for the events, and the play
is not necessarily focused on visual realism. This is not an
example of art imitating life but of theater showing the
audience life in a different way.

"R&L" is arranged as several vignettes sur
rounding the death of Tom Fukunaga, played by Rich
Liu. Although each plot is unique and tells a different

story, they all somehow connect to the
disturbing death of this young Asian-

American man. Much of the play
is composed of flashbacks of
Tom's life or Tom himself speak
ing from the view of a dead man.

Liu is a strong actor and gives the character of Tom an important
depth, although sometimes the actor seems to have only two
ranges — quiet and nervous or loud and angry. Despite this.

though, the character of Tom is believable, and over the course of
the play he becomes real. It is depressing to know that he is dead,
a fact that gives "R&L" and the state of America in general a
sense of hopelessness.
Despite the sadness associated with the death of such a young

man, though, the play is mostly angry. Hell
hath no fury like an Asian stereotyped, trivi-

alized, ridiculed and boxed in. Rivera is very

confrontational and does not hide the fact

that everybody is to blame for the less
than ideal state of not just Asians but

all Americans. Pete Ramiro, played by
Mark Marzona, and Helen Matzuri,

played by Rachel Yong, are two of

several characters who deliver

speeches (which sometimes
come off as a bit sermony)

condemning many prob
lems particular to Asian-

Americans: gay OR
Asian, white men I'etishiz
-ing Asian women.

Asian women only dating

white men, etc.

Although the focus of

the play is on Asian-

Americans, this really is a

play for every Stanford
Student. You will notice

some tragic Asian figures
discussed in the story, but

"R&L" illumi
nates how we arc those
tragic Asian figures, too.

No one is free from struggle. Even if you aren't necessarily
Asian — or a person of color at all — family drama and identity
drama is as intrinsic to humans as opposable thumbs. The open
ing of "R&L" says it nicely: "Because you're brown enough to
care."
