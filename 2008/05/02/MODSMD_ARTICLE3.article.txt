### STEPHANIE WERNER COPY EDITOR 
After months of student outcry, the CoHo. Stan
ford's coffee house that was closed down at the end of
last summer, will be reopened for business by mid-June.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg Boardman an
nounced Thursday.
"Students let us know that they were really disap
pointed when CoHo closed," Boardman said in a press
release. "They missed the tradition of socializing, dining
and enjoying student programming in CoHo, so it
seems the time is right to recreate the coffee house."
"I am looking forward to seeing CoHo return as an
other fine option for students on campus and another
programming space where creativity can be highlight
ed," Boardman added in an email to The Daily.
The new CoHo will be a joint venture between Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE) and Ray Klein, owner
and manager of The Treehouse restaurant. SSE will
schedule and run the programming for the new CoHo.
including music events, game nights, movie nights and
speaker events. It will also partner with Klein to create
a mobile food cart that will deliver across campus, par
ticularly to dorms and houses without food on the
weekends.
Klein, for his part, will be crafting the restaurant and
its menu as well as running the day-to-day operations.
Before its reopening, he said, the interior of the CoHo
will get a major facelift.
"We're warming it up, getting rid of all the formica
and making it warm and fuzzy." Klein said. "I brought
some old San Francisco bars to put in as counter tops.
They're going to be sit-up counter tops like an old
diner."
In addition to the new decor, the revamped CoHo
will also feature a movie screen projector, a big screen
plasma TV and the well-loved stage of CoHo's last in
carnation.
"There are going to be student bands three or four
times a week," Klein said.
Klein, who referred to the CoHo as his "pet project,"
said that the most exciting part for him has not been
revamping the space itself but the prospects of "deliver
ing good food at a reasonable

price.
"We do that pretty well at

The Treehouse," Klein said.
"We get a lot of student
approval on our food there.
It's the kind of thing 1 do ,
best, and yet [Coho] will be '
different from the
Treehouse."
CoHo's new menu is set
to include a revival of the
crepes, always a student
favorite, as well as home
made baked goods, organic
granola, breakfast, coffee.

espresso, coffee cake and
many other artisan-style baked
goods.

Matt McLaughlin, incoming chief executive
officer of SSE for the fall of 2009. and current CEO
Matt McDonald were very excited about partnering with
Klein on the CoHo's revival.
"[When] we met Ray ... it will probably go down in
my memory as one of the best meetings I've ever had,"
McLaughlin said in an email to The Daily. "From the get
go, Ray, Matt McDonald and I were all on the same page.
The relationship has only grown stronger with time."
When McLaughlin and McDonald first heard rumors
of the CoHo's possible reopening, they were quick to
investigate and see how SSE could get involved.
"Matt and I both recognized the opening of the CoHo
as a tremendous opportunity for SSE and its employees."

McLaughlin said. "We firmly believed — as we still do —

that SSL's involvement with
the Col lo's operations would

ensure that [the] CoHo
would have a distinctly stu
dent feel."

"SSL is looking for
ward to participating in a
dynamic business that has an
enormous on-campus impact,"
McLaughlin added. "It has been
incredibly fun thus far."
Klein, McLaughlin.
McDonald and Boardman are
not the only ones exciting
about the reopening of the
CoHo.

112 "Having the CoHo return
really provides students with a
variety of late night options," said
Zachary Warma '11. "This was a smart
move by the University, particularly

in light of the overwhelming support
expressed by the students over these past few months to
revive the CoHo."
Peter Belisle '09 echoed that sentiment.
"While the Axe and Palm is good in its own way," he
said, "it'll be even better to have the CoHo back."
Hours for the new CoHo are expected to run from 7
a.m. until whenever the programming ends on any given
night, possibly as late as midnight or 1 a.m.
Any inquiries about the new CoHo should be for
warded to coho@sse.stanford.edu.
