## Jin Sho: An Education in Sushi 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION FISH FANATIC 
There are few things in life that are
more annoying or perhaps offensive
than cooked fish. The concept is per
verse. Why would anyone take a per
fectly good piece of moist, flavorful
raw fish and apply heat so as to create
a bland blob of tasteless flesh? Not
only do such acts waste scarce fish, but
in a world the very existence of which
is threatened by global warming,
burning fossil fuels in support of such
cooking puts literally billions of lives
at risk. Some might argue that some
fish is not of sufficiently high quality
to be edible raw. And while I cede
that point. I contend such fish is not
worthy of consumption, period. Ulti
mately, fish should be exclusively
served raw.
The people of the islands of Japan
seem to have figured out this seem
ingly obvious law of nature. For hun

dreds of years, Japan has been the
home to various preparations of raw
fish which, while not technically rigor
ous, can be collectively referred to as
sushi. Near Stanford, getting sushi can
be hit or miss. One popular option is
Sushi Tomo. Ever since eating there, I
have been trying to figure out what
form of radioactive toxic waste conta
minated the fishery that supplies their
fish. And while Fuki Sushi is a more
respectable choice, its prices are
rather high for sushi that is scarcely a
step above mediocre.
Five months ago, however, the bar
was raised in Palo Alto with the open
ing of Jin Sho on California Avenue.
The space is rather unassuming both
on the outside and the inside, but this
is not like every other Japanese
restaurant you've been to. Based on
the menu, there appeared to be two
ways to have a meal at Jin Sho. The
conservative option is to order a la
carte. The a la carte menu includes

most of the things you'd expect to see,
at prices a bit higher than average but
not exorbitant, with standard maki
rolls (e.g., spicy tuna) around $7 and
fancier rolls (e.g., dragon roll) around
$12. The other option is one of the
Omakase prix-fixe menus which in
clude a number of the chefs choices
from the sushi bar and kitchen for
around $60.
Apparently, there is a third option.
For this meal, I was in the company of
my frequent dining companion and
sushi guru, Robert Bonkowski. After
sitting down at the sushi bar and be
ginning to digest the menu, Robert re
moved the menu from my grip and
threw it aside informing me: "This is
for white people." This remark was
somewhat confusing because, last
time 1 looked in the mirror, my im
pression was that I am quite remark
ably white. But I decided to go with
the flow and let Robert and the sushi
chef figure out the best options based

on the catch of fish that had been
flown in from Japan that day.
It quickly became clear the Jin
Sho, thanks to its international ship
ments, offers a number of choices that
you simply can't find elsewhere. At
times it was difficult to figure out what
we were eating because many of the
fish did not have names in English.
But some of the delicacies included
golden snapper and needlefish nigiri
as well as a maki with squid that
looked like it could have been alive
moments earlier. Many of these were
delicious, although a few, like the
squid, made me wonder why 1 hadn't
stuck with the "white people" menu.
One standout was the eel nigiri. The
eel actually was alive when it entered
the restaurant, so it doesn't get any
fresher. And it was very delicately
seasoned rather than being drenched
in the sweet sauce usually used. At
first the absence of the sauce was off
putting, but it soon became clear that

Though it is difficult to say
whether this holds for table as well,
the service at the sushi bar was very
good. Tea was promptly refilled, and
the same sushi chef took care of us the
whole time. The only fluke (no pun in
tended) was a slight delay in taking
the credit cards for processing, which
is another pet peeve of mine. Serious
ly, there is absolutely no time during
the meal when it is more stupid for the
service to get sloppy than the moment
when all of the food has already been
served and the customer is trying to
pay. Especially when a moderate
amount of sushi for two comes to just
under $100 before tip.
Overall, Jin Sho should appeal to
people looking for a distinctly above
average sushi experience. The stan
dard fare, even on the "white people
menu," is probably worth the higher
than-usual price. But if you're looking
for a real educational experience in
the world of sushi, put yourself at the
mercy of the chef.


this was probably the best eel I had
ever eaten.
