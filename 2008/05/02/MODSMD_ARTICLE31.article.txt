## The 						Weepies will make you smile 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION MUSICAL MOPER 
The Weepies have been circling in on indie-pop
stardom for a while.
After the release of the second album, "Say I Am
You," the group's tunes were disseminated across
primetime's indie-loving soundtrack shows, includ
ing "Grey's Anatomy," "Everwood," "One Tree
Hill." "Scrubs" and "Gossip Girl." They also landed
songs in movie soundtracks, too, including Diane
Keaton and Mandy Moore's lady Hick "Because 1
Said So." The male-female singer-songwriter duo,
made up of Deb Talan and Steve Tannen, toured
with the Indigo Girls for a while, and Moore asked
them to collaborate with her on her folk-inspired lat
est album, "Wild Hope."

The self-proclaimed
pop-rock-acoustic pair met
while both Talan and Tan
nen were touring, pursuing
solo careers. After Tan
ncn's set, over a bottle of
wine, they played guitar to
gether, wrote songs and the
making of the band was

made. To top off the almost barf-in-my-mouth ro
mantic perfection of their courtship and rise to indie
pop notoriety, the two just got married in 2007.
The dynamic twosome is picking up (musical)
steam again now, with the release of their latest
album April 22, "Hideaway." In oh-so-indie-style,
they recorded it with some friends in their home in
Topanga, California.
"Hideaway" offers the same simple pleasure of
folk-indie music that "Happiness" (2003) and "Say 1
Am You" (2006) offered. Unfussy lyrics and gliding
melodies float over mellow guitars, soft Jack Johnson
drums, a bass and occasionally a keyboard or horns.
The couple trade off the job of lead singer as fluidly
as Fleetwood Mac, and the duo's frequent and
unique harmonization is perhaps the most distinctive
of their sound.
Both Talan and Tannen sing seemingly noncha
lantly — Talan's quiet and smooth voice croons
alongside, over and back-up to hubby Tannen's,
whose vocals travel along the group's laidback
melodies with ease and evenness. Oohing and ahhing
through choruses and verses alike, the two charm in
much a similar way as Frames front-man Glen
Hansard and Marketa Irglovain do in "Once" —
both girl-boy pairs make sincere, honest, simple,
from-the-heart music which also gets your foot tap
ping and lips moving.
Talan said that their admittedly curious band
name "came from wanting to make music that reach
es people in that feelingful place where tears come
trom ... for joy or sorrow... but that intensity of feel
ing is why we're drawn to music." And indeed The
Weepies, whose earlier singles include "Nobody
Knows Me At All" and"The World Spins Madly
On," don't shy from exploring all that is lonely and
melancholy. In fact, "Hideaway" stands as the
group's darkest album, focusing on self-doubt, uncer

tainty and lost love twice as often as they do love won.
On the opening song of the album — and perhaps
the best one too — Tannen sings, "You know there
will be days when you're so tired that you can't take
another step/ The night will have no stars and you'll
think you've gone as far as you will ever get." He tells
us in the end, in very U2 fashion, to "walk on, walk
on, walk on. "Just Blue" is about being exactly that.
On "Old Coyote," Talan sings, "Ring around Rosie
game/ always ends the same way/ we all fall down."
Perhaps most potently, Tannen sings on "Lighting
Candles" that "Trying not to hope too hard/ For what
I want/ Trying not to go too far/ With all the dream
ing/All the disappointment/ So hard to handle/1 am
still in the dark/ Lighting candles."
"Hideaway" has its upbeat moments, too, such as

on "All This Beau
ty" in which Talan
sings, "All this beau
ty/ you might have to
close your eyes/ and
slowly open wide/ we
traveled all night/ we
drank the ocean dry/
and watched the sun

rise." Tallen and Talan's lovey songs, like "Not Dead
Yet" drip with sincerity, and maybe it's because the
two are writing about themselves
"Hideaway" surprises as it winds along, from de-

pressed to ebullient, from pop-guitar to folk
blue-grass, along its 14 tracks. It offers in
sights on being down, being up. and being,
more often that not, somewhere in be-

tween. The Weepies won't be

headliners, and you proba
bly won't hear them on the

radio, but they'll leave
you looping their

album, looking up
lyrics and appreciat-

ing a group that sees
the gray, too, in this

world of ours.
