## takes the gold 
### ERIC MESSINGER INTERMISSION COMIC CRUSADER 
hero on fire was one of the lighter moments, but for a film that stays closer to the core glee and mischief of super
heroics the edge is still effective.
The movie also proudly wears its geek credentials on its sleeve, with nods to 5.H.1.E.L.D., Rhodes becoming War
Machine and even a future villain for the series. Old-fashioned butler Jarvis is appropriately updated to a wall-em
bedded robot, presumably some years away from acquiring H AL-9(X)0-style personality tics. As these movies are al
ways going to be gceky and always going to be a little bit silly, the touches help, especially in giving the sense that the
filmmakers care about the material.

The A-list cast — four Academy-Award nominees, including winner Paltrow — brings a lot the table. Paltrow and
Rhodes both do solid work, though neither of their roles feels fully developed, with Howard especially seeming over
whelmed by Stark's outsized personality in their scenes together.

Downey, Jr. is obviously the most important piece of the puzzle, and he puts in a great performance. Stark's partying, hard-

drinking lifestyle, mixed with a sincere desire to remake himself and do good for the world, hits a lot of interesting notes from
Downey, Jr. s own background. I le also does a great job of learning to be a hero, with the right mix of amazement, exasperation

and determination to carry a picture. The only letdown is his tone in some of the movie's many comedic sequences; his delivery is some
times flat and awkward, which is particularly surprising given how funny he was in "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang." Still, the film gets by with
comedy from other sources, including some great recurring gags with his robot assistants.

"Iron Man" also sets up a great dynamic between its hero and its villain. Bridges's Stane gets progressively sinister at a perfect

pace. At first, I thought I had misidentified him as the main villain, hut as the layers start to shed and his malice comes to the sur
face, it's clear that he's the real threat. Bridges gets a couple scenes where his menace becomes completely captivating. It adds a
lot of energy to Stark and Stane's rift, and the biggest disappointment with the film is how little time their conflict is given at its cli
max. The film perfectly sets up a well-earned rock-'em. sock-'em finish, as everything "Transformers" should have been comes

to life before your eyes. But it all comes to a close too soon.
I Jltimately, "Iron Man" takes a happy place amidst its comic-book peers. It's not the best entry
in the genre, but it's a smart, slick, funny take on the material. It makes for a great kick-off to the
second wave, as the big franchises have come and gone. If this is what superhero films will be like
for the next few years, then count me in.

If you wanted the life of a superhero, you couldn't pick much better than Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr). A true science
geek, complete with MIT pedigree, he also lives the high life as a billionaire CEO of the weapons-dealing Stark Industries, a
company he inherited from his father. He sleeps with supermodels and hot reporters, gets to play with awesome toys and he can
call up high-ranking military when he needs a favor. His life is even managed for him, complete with robotic servants and sec
retary extraordinaire, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).

None of that really changes over the course of the movie, but Stark gets a serious attitude adjustment in the form of an as-

sassination-turned-kidnapping at the hands of Afghani militia. Wounded after their attack on his convoy.
Stark wakes up to find that he's being kept alive by an electromagnet attached to his heart, powered by a
car battery. To add to his problems, the militia want him to build a nice new Stark-brand "Jericho" mis
sile.

Down on his luck. Stark builds himself a futuristic pacemaker of sorts, a glowing circle with signif
icant power. I le also tricks the militia, building a suit powered by the device instead of a missile, and
kicks ass without taking names as he punches, fires and blazes his way out of his cave prison. Rescued
by his military buddy Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard), he heads home to

America. Turning over a new leaf. Stark renounces the weapons business and sets to work perfect-

ing his new creation, sending him on a collision course with business buddy Obadiah Stane (Jeff
Bridges), who has other plans for the Stark empire.

In this bizarre world, where superhero films have somehow, gloriously, made themselves
an established force, "Iron Man" is one of the first that feels like a genre picture. The

film doesn't rewrite any rules with its basic idea — a guy has bad ex
perience and new capabilities, and he sets out to make the world right.
Needing an angle, director Jon Favreau takes the material and does
his best to fashion a slick, technological thriller. In the process, the film
also acquires a surprisingly gritty edge, with gunfire, grim locales and
an increasing sense of menace from Stark's enemies. Where Spider-
Man takes pains to avoid potentially lethal maneuvers. Stark swats,
torches and explodes bad guys without a second thought. It doesn't

head anywhere near the dark ter-

ritory of "Batman Begins,"
, where a villain setting the
