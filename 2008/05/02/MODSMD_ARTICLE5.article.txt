## Synchro in second at U.S. Nationals 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
With their fourth straight collegiate
national championship already taken care
of, the women of the Stanford synchro
nized swimming team is looking to finish
their unblemished season with a flourish

at the U.S. Nationals competition in TUc
son, Ariz.

The event began yesterday and will run
through tomorrow. ITie Cardinal current
ly sits in second place in the team compe
tition behind Ohio State — the very team
that Stanford ousted at the collegiate
championships a little over a month ago

— with a score of 95.167.'1Tie Santa Clara
Aquamaids are tied in second with the
Cardinal.

ALL DAY

NOTES: The NCAA Champion Cardinal is in
the midst of an attempt at the U.S. National
title as well, against pro-style club teams as
well as other collegiate competitors. Stan
ford sits in second place after the first day of
competition with 95.167 points, just behind
Ohio State. Senior Sara Lowe posted the
best individual score in the meet yesterday
(94.833).
94.833. Lowe teamed up with fellow
senior Courtenay Stewart to also
take first place in the duet as they
scored a 95.500.
The U.S. Nationals differ from the
Collegiate Championships in that
they are open to club teams. As Stew
art explained, the importance of the
event amps up a notch as there are a
number of top club teams around the
nation.
"Synchronized swimming is big
ger on the club level than it is on the
collegiate level," Stewart said. "Peo
ple either train full time or train to
make a national team.
"In the grand scheme of things this
is a bigger competition," Stewart con
tinued. "There's (sic) no limits at U.S.
Nationals. Club and collegiate teams
can be there, so it's truly an indicator
of who the best team in the country
is."

Unlike the Stanford team, club
teams have no limit on the number of
hours they are allowed to practice per
week.The Cardinal can only practice
20 hours a week due to NCAA re
strictions, but many club teams are in
the pool up to 40 hours a week.
The added dynamic of facing club
teams with players as old as 30 years
old makes for a different, more seri
ous kind of event.
"This competition has a more seri
ous feel than our NCAA competi
tions but at the same time I feel like
the level of competition is maybe just
a little bit more difficult," said sopho
more Taylor Durand.
The U.S. Nationals will be the
team's last meet of the year; more
than anything else, it serves as "icing
on the cake." as Durand put it. Win
ning this weekend's competition
would only further Stanford's recent

dominance of its sport: the program
has won four straight collegiate na
tional titles and also won the U.S. Na
tionals event last year, becoming the
first college program to achieve such
a feat.
This weekend's event will also
mark the end of the careers for four
Stanford seniors: Taylor, Lowe,
Melissa Knight and Poppy Carlig.
The four seniors won national titles in
all of their four years on the Farm,
and concluding their careers with a
win at the US. Nationals would cer
tainly be a fitting end.
"It's just been special," Durand
said. "The four seniors who are grad
uating are a really big part of this time
and have been huge role models.
We're all just trying to learn every
thing we can anil make this a really
great last season for them."
Although the team stands in sec

ond place going into today's competi
tion, the Cardinal has very high hopes
for this weekend.
"I'm really confident in our work
we've put in and 1 really think that we
definitely have a shot," Durand said.
"1 think we can definitely bring this
home."
"I think everyone on our team is
feeling very positive, unlike all of the
club teams, we've already had a huge
competition under our belts — the
Collegiate Championships," said
Stewart. "That was a learning experi
ence.
"We've had four weeks to im
prove despite injuries that have come
up on our team. We've definitely
pulled together as a team and are in a
really good place right now."
