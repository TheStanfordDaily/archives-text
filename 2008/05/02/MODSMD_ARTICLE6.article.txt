Pac-10 season. The Cardinal can put itself two games above .500 with a sweep.
the Ducks have given Stanford, as
well as other formidable opponents,
trouble all season.
The Cardinal needed two stellar
efforts from star pitcher Missy Penna
to beat the Ducks at Stanford earlier
this season. The junior went 14 in
nings in the two games, allowing just
one run and four hits overall while
striking out 17 batters.
Penna shut down an Oregon of
fense led by sophomore outfielder
Neena Bryant, who enters this week
end hitting .376 with nine homeruns
and 42 RBIs, sixth-best in the Pac-10.
After Friday night's game, the
Cardinal will travel to Oregon State
for a pair of afternoon games Satur
day and Sunday.
The meetings will be the teams'
second and third of the year, with the
Cardinal taking the first meeting 10-
1 in a six-inning, run-rule-shortened
game.
On that day on the Farm, the Stan
ford bats were alive, none more so
than that of sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill. Neill had three hits, in
cluding a homerun, while senior des
ignated player Erin Howe also
homered and drove in four runs for
the Cardinal offense.
While Penna has been consistent
ly brilliant in the circle for the Cardi
nal, Stanford's fortunes have swung
with its offensive output in the Pac
-10. In its seven wins Stanford has
scored 27 runs. In its eight losses, the
Cardinal has managed just four runs
total.
Neill and sophomore center field
er Alissa Haber lead the Stanford of
fense. Haber is hitting an impressive
.382. with Neill just behind at .370.
Neill also has a team-leading 17
homeruns and 48 RBIs.
Haber and Neill are the only two
Cardinal players hitting over .300.
Penna, on the other hand, has often
lifted the Stanford offense, going 30-
9 thus far this season with a 1.07 ERA
and an astronomical 327 strikeouts in
only 261.2 innings.
When the Cardinal battles the
Beavers. Penna will have to square
off against returning OSU Ail-
American Cambria Miranda. Miran
da enters the weekend with a .284
batting average to go along with 10
doubles and eight homeruns.
If Stanford does well this week
end, it will have a chance to salvage at
least third place in the Pac-10 when it
travels to Arizona next weekend to
take on Arizona and Arizona State.
