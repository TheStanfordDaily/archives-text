## ARMY GRANT MEETS POLICY Faculty Senate committee concludes research does not violate Univ. rules 
### BEN EPPLER STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research concluded that a high-tech
computing grant funded by the U.S.
Army did not violate the University's
prohibitions against conducting secret
research, according to a report by Civil
and Environmental Engineering
Professor Stephen Monismith, the com
mittee's chair, during a Faculty Senate
meeting on Thursday.
"There will be no classified research at
Stanford," Monismith said."The proposal
is consistent and the agreement is consis
tent with our policies."
The research committee report came a
year after the Army announced that a
consortium led by Stanford had been
awarded a $105 million contract to devel
op a new site for the Army High
Performance Computing Research
Center, previously housed at the
University of Minnesota. In June 2007,60
faculty members called for publication of
the grant proposal and an open discus
sion of the project's merits.
Monismith and his committee were
assigned the task of reviewing the Army
agreement's compliance with Stanford's
research policies, which prohibit
researchers from receiving funding for
projects whose findings are not freely
publishable and available to everyone.
After reviewing documents related to
the proposal, the Committee on
Research issued a 19-page report con
firming that the project complies with the
University's research policy.
The committee's report dismissed
fears that the project would be too close
ly directed by a military liaison, the
Cooperative Agreement Manager.
Stanford Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Charbel Farhat would instead play a key
role in directing research, according to
Monismith.
"They've got quite a detailed structure
for formulating an annual research plan.

and it's in fact produced by a collective
effort of the consortium. Professor Farhat
has a large say," Monismith said. "It's not
out of the ordinary."
Despite their findings that the pro
gram does not violate Stanford's rules,
the committee's report signaled they
were realistic about the ultimate uses of
the technology developed by the Center.
"It may lead to future classified
research," Monismith said. "The Army
isn't funding this out of the goodness of
their heart. They think there's something
in this for them."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth, who organized the faculty
petition last June, said that he remained
unconvinced that the project was ethical.
He remained especially concerned about
the role of the project's staff scientists.
These scientists are employees of consor
tium member High Performancy
Technologies, Inc., a private consulting
firm that works with the Department of
Defense.
"They have security clearance, they're
working on secret things and three of
them are stationed at consortium sites,"
Roth said.
Roth said he also remained concerned
about a provision of the grant agreement
which provides for summer math and sci
ence programs for students from middle
school to the undergraduate level.
"This is not to teach these people
math skills," he said. "It's to begin getting
them tuned into this kind of work so
they'll choose that as part of their
careers."
Members of the Faculty Senate also
heard an annual report on the status of
women and minority faculty by Patricia
Jones, vice provost for faculty develop
ment and diversity.
The proportion of underrepresented
minority faculty has remained stagnant
over the past decade, Jones said. The
