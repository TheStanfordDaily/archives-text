## Students stage anti-war rally Activists pretest Iraq war on anniversary of Hush 's speech 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Around 60 students, faculty and commu
nity members rallied Thursday to commem
orate the fifth anniversary of President
Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech,
when the president made a dramatic landing
on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln to declare
that "major combat operations in Iraq have
ended."
'I"he White House admitted Wednesday
that it had "paid a price" for the banner.

which has come to symbolize U.S. misman
agement of the war.
That was certainly the case yesterday
evening, as the protestors marched from
White Plaza to Hoover Tower bearing signs
and chanting anti-war slogans. There,
Amanda Gelender '09 stood on the Tower
steps and reenacted the Bush speech, draw
ing raucous laughter and applause from the
gathering.
The student group Stanford Says No to
War led the march, with Adam Hudson TO at
its helm.
"The president still wants to claim that
the war is a success," Hudson said, eliciting
boos from the crowd.
Hudson, megaphone in hand, expressed
frustration at the sense of student apathy

that pervades campus life.
"I learned that Stanford as an institution
is not friendly to student activism," Hudson
said. "But what's even more troubling than
the lack of institutional support is the atti
tude of many students on campus. We are
concerned more on making our resumes
look good than trying to solve serious
issues."
Yet the protest organizers said they were
pleased with the turnout at the rally, which
attracted students from beyond the tradi
tional anti-war circles.
"I'm really happy to see all the kids here,"
said Roy Nordblom '81, a member of
Veterans for Peace. "The peace movement is
traditionally a marginal thing [at
Stanford.]"
Nordblom exhorted the students
present to keep promoting the anti
war cause.
"You're going to keep fighting
this fight for the rest of your lives"
he said.
At one point, a student with a
megaphone attempted a one-man
counter-protest from a second floor
window of the Nitery, lauding the
economic benefits of warfare while
blasting the Edwin Starr song

"War" from a speaker.
Three officers from the Stanford
Sheriffs department arrived at the
Tower at around 6 p.m., at which
time only about five of the demon
strators remained. The officers said
they received a call from someone
at Hoover complaining about a dis
turbance.
In Washington, the White House
admitted Wednesday that the
"Mission Accomplished" banner
had not been handled correctly.
"President Bush is well aware
that the banner should have been
much more specific and said 'mis
sion accomplished' for these sailors
who are on this ship on their mis
sion." White House press secretary
Dana Perino said Wednesday. "And

we have certainly paid a price for
not being more specific on that ban
ner."
Now in its sixth year, the Iraq
war has claimed the lives of at least
4.061 members of the U.S. military.
The month of April saw at least 49
U.S. troops die in the conflict, mak
ing it the deadliest month since
September when 65 U.S. troops
died.
"It's been a very tough month in
Iraq," Perino said, "but we are tak
ing the fight to the enemy."
