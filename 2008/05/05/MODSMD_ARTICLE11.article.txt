SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Yahoo Inc.
Chief Executive Jerry Yang has gotten what he
wanted: a chance to prove his company is
worth more than the $47.5 billion that Mi
crosoft Corp. offered to buy the Internet pio
neer.
It will be a daunting challenge, as Yang will
be pointedly reminded Monday when in
vestors are expected to show how little they
think of Yahoo without a takeover bid on the
table. Faced with resistance from Yang and the
rest of Yahoo's board. Microsoft withdrew its
offer over the weekend.
Many analysts believe Yahoo's stock price,
which had climbed nearly 50 percent since Mi
crosoft's initial offer, will surrender most, if
not all. of that gain, leaving the Sunnyvale
based company's market value around $30 bil
lion.
Disillusioned shareholders are bound to
question whether the rejection of Microsoft's
sweetened $33-per-share offer was driven
more by emotion and ego than sound business
sense.
"Clearly there's frustration," said Darren
Chervitz. Co-manager of the Jacob Internet
Fund, which owns Yahoo stock. "I am not even
sure if Yahoo cares about its shareholders be
cause they didn't show much regard for share
holders' best interests in this process."
Despite such negative sentiment, Yahoo
shares are unlikely to immediately fall back to
their $ 19.18 pre-bid price, partly because some
investors may still be holding out hope that the
software maker will renew its takeover at
tempt if Yahoo continues to struggle.
Yahoo shares finished last week at $28.67,
slightly below the $29.40 per share that Mi
crosoft was offering before Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer agreed to raise the offer to $33
per share in a last-ditch effort to get a deal
done.
Accompanied by fellow Yahoo co-founder
David Filo, Yang flew to Seattle Saturday to in
form Ballmer that the company wouldn't sell
for less than $37 per share - a price that
Yahoo's stock hasn't reached since January
2006.

Analysts and investors were left to wonder
why the two sides couldn't compromise at $35
per share.
"They really didn't seem that far apart,"
Chervitz said. "There is probably blame to go
around on both sides, but 1 think most of it is in
Yang's hands."
Monday's anticipated shareholder back
lash will put Yang on the hot seat as he tries to
execute on a turnaround plan that he began
drawing up nearly a year ago after he replaced
Terry Semel as CEO amid shareholder angst
about the company's financial malaise.
"This squarely puts the pressure on Jerry
Yang to deliver results and shareholder
value," Standard & Poor's equity analyst Scott
Kessler said. "You are going to see a lot of
shareholders just throwing in the towel be
cause they are going to realize it's going to

take awhile for the stock to get back to where
it was Friday."
Ballmer also will be under the gun to prove
he can come up with another way to challenge
Google Inc.'s dominance of the Internet's lu
crative search and advertising markets.
The unsolicited bid was widely seen as
Ballmer's admission that Microsoft needed
Yahoo's help to upgrade its unprofitable In
ternet division.
Analysts now expect Ballmer to use the
money he had earmarked for the Yahoo acqui
sition to explore other possible deals with
large Internet companies like Time Warner
Inc.'s AOL and News Corp.'s MySpace and
promising startups like Facebook Inc. and
Linkedln Corp. Microsoft already owns a 1.6
percent in Facebook, the second-largest social
network behind MySpace.

Exterior view of Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. Microsoft Corp.'s withdrawal of its bid to
acquire Yahoo is likely to cause a precipitous drop in Yahoo's stock, which had been bolstered by
the 3-month-old takeover bid.
