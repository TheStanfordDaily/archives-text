## Endangered salamanders to be protected Permit would prohibit intentional harm to salamanders, other species 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford currently houses four kinds of
protected species. While the first three ani
mals that call Stanford home might he unfa
miliar to most community members, the
fourth is perhaps the most notorious
amphibian to ever walk the Stanford campus
— the tiger salamander.
This week, Stanford announced the draft
ing of an "incidental take permit" to protect
these species.
Steelhead trout, western pond turtles and
California red-legged frogs, the lesser known
of the animals in question, are removed from
the majority of Stanford's population, prima
rily making their homes in the San
Francisquito and Matadero creeks on the
outskirts of University property. The sala
mander, however, claims as its habitat Lake
Lagunita and many of the more populated

areas on campus.
"They're all over the land," University
Biologist Alan Launer said of the salaman
ders. "In the buildings, in the landscaping,
even interacting with the people."
An incidental take permit is essentially a
document that prohibits the intentional
destruction of an endangered animal or its
habitat.
"'Take' is a word for everything from
killing to wrecking habitat," Launer said,
"incidental' refers to anything that would
otherwise be legal."
If granted, the policy will allow certain
projects to unintentionally threaten the ani
mals, but any outright destruction will be
prohibited.
The new policy will make significant
changes to University practices along its
creeks, Launer said, but will not result in
changes that the average student or faculty
member would notice.
The man-made Lake Lagunita basin
once served as a site for waterslides and
windsurfing lessons, but now its water level
is generally much lower. The change has
prompted many students to speculate that
the presence of the salamanders is blocking

the reinstatement of a true lake
on west campus.
According to Launer, there is
misunderstanding about the
salamanders and recent lake !
water levels.
"The reason the lake is not
full is because the berm is not
safe," he said.
Launer said the water was
unlikely to ever reach a level high
er than the present without signifi
cant improvements to the lakt
damming walls.
"The dam is just full of rodent
and trees," he said. "It's not a goc
dam."

Launer told The Daily that if it had not
been for the salamanders in the lakebed, the
University may have been compelled to
keep the lake even drier than it has been in
the past because some wetlands were always
maintained for salamander habitats.
According to Launer, the new incidental
take permit will have no effect on future
Lake Lag policies.
The new conservation plan is one in a
series of measures taken to protect the sala-

The Stanford Daily
manders over the past decade.
Lake Lag serves as a mating ground for the
salamanders during the rainy winter months.
For many salamanders this migration means
crossing busy Junipero Serra Street. To cut
down on salamander mortality, the university
installed a $100,000 system consisting of three
migration tunnels under the road in 2001. The
tunnels — still present today — are lit and cir
culate water to entice the amphibians.

A draft of the new permit will soon be
posted online and will then be open to a 60-
day public comment period. Ideally, Launer
said, the plan will go into effect next spring.
"[The permit] sets up a framework for the
next fifty years of conservation planning,"
Launer said, 'it's a really good thing."
