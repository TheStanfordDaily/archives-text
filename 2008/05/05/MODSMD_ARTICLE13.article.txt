## Alumni discuss careers in academia Distinguished Alumni Scholars Day to focus on diversity 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students can get an in-depth look at
careers in academia today, as University alumni return
to campus to share their experiences as scholars.
The third-annual Distinguished Alumni Scholars
Day will consist of workshops and seminars for both
undergraduate and graduate students, informing stu
dents of the career opportunities in academia.
Nineteen scholars will participate, an increase from
eight last year and nine in 2006.
The event has centered on ethnic and cultural
diversity in its previous two years, and it will expand
this year to include gender diversity. This change came
about through an infusion of funding and support
from Vice Provost for Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport, who has emphasized concerns regarding
gender diversity.
"This year the event has been broadened to include
both focuses," said Associate Vice Provost for Faculty
Development and Diversity Jacyn Lewis.
The event also aims to provide a look into the
diversity of scholarly opportunities. ITie participating
alumni come from a variety of backgrounds, including
liberal arts colleges, large public universities and pre
professional institutions. In addition, some of the fac
ulty attending come from universities that serve spe
cific ethnic communities, such as the historically black
Howard University. Organizers hope this focus will
introduce students to experiences different from those
at research-focused Stanford, exposing students to
institutions with teaching focuses, strong religious
affiliations and other approaches.
"It exposes people to think about what it means to
be a scholar at an institution with a different focus,"
Lewis said. "The idea is to expose students to a broad
range of institutional types and faculty types."
"If they just see Stanford, students might find that
their interests are not aligned, but might still think that

they really want to teach, for instance," Lewis added.
"This allows them to be acquainted with other oppor
tunities."
The day will begin with workshops for undergrad
uate students in the early afternoon. Organized by dis
ciplinary' clusters, they will take place at five cultural
centers on campus, with the aim of integrating scholar
ly, ethnic and gender diversity.
"These will be casual Q&A's with the alumni about
their scholarship," Lewis said. "They will center
around faculty positions, and research within their
institutions."
Later in the day, scholars will meet with graduate
students in smaller seminars.
" ITiese will be more career-specific," Lewis said.
"They will address issues such as how to prepare to
become an academic, and how to pursue scholarship
at a more focused level."
In locating scholars to participate in the event, the
planning committee focused on identifying scholars
from databases and from prior personal contacts,
often dating back to when the scholars were students
at Stanford. In addition, the committee coordinated
with the School for Humanities & Sciences (H&S) to
bring in scholars seen by H&S as attractive recruit
ment prospects.
"If there are candidates Stanford is interested in.
the program can help in bringing some of those peo
ple here," Lewis said. "Department chairs partnered
with us, and helped us to identify several of the candi
dates. They also assisted in extending invitations to
attend."
Lewis said that this integrated effort will provide
strong opportunities to build connections with alumni,
and provide chances to increase faculty diversity on
campus.
"It allows us an opportunity to reconnect with
them as an institution," Lewis said. "It's a chance to
bring them in for a possible conversation, and for us to
get reacquainted."
"The University is always looking for new and cre
ative ways to help our efforts at increasing diversity,"
Lewis added.
