## Editorial Board Maintain vigilance to retain privileges 
### 
A recent armed robbery at a popular
Palo Alto ice cream parlor was a
rather jarring occurrence, even if
many of us on campus were blissfully un
aware of it. The simple fact is that Stanford is
located in suburbia, and we tend to assume
that we are relatively safe from most crime.
Our open campus encourages this carefree
attitude. While it is wonderful that the vast
majority of us enjoy a wide degree of freedom
and go about our business untroubled, it is
important that we do what we can to remain
vigilant so our campus can remain both open
and safe.
Other universities located in more urban
areas often have keycard-limited access to
most buildings and even security guards post
ed at the doors. Here, we are fortunate not to
have to resort to such measures. The Univer
sity's Department of Public Safety Web site
and police blotter mention only a few in
stances of prowling, sexual assault and auto
burglaries each month. While these are all un
fortunate occurrences, they remain rather un
common. and attempts to alleviate serious
crimes such as sexual assault are dealt with
through programming and other methods.
There are. however, certain issues of theft
that continue to plague our campus. Bike
theft flares up fairly frequently, a spate of auto
burglaries occurred over spring break and it
is not uncommon to hear of a break-in in one
of the dormitories. Not long ago, several lap
tops were stolen from Sterling Ouad.
In all likelihood, minor crimes will contin
ue. We are fortunate that, ever since an inci
dent of armed robbery on campus a few years
ago. Stanford has been relatively devoid of vi

olent crime. Campus security remains effec
tive at deterring potential crime. Many would
argue that the benefits of a free and open
campus far outweigh the marginal advantage
— security guards posted at dorms and key
card-access for buildings — of some other
schools, and this is certainly the opinion of
The Daily.
Still, we can all help maintain this laid
back atmosphere by paying attention to our
surroundings. We should not be too busy to
notice whether or not a stranger is entering
our dorm, and even engage in the awkward
and unfriendly "who are you and who are you
here to see" line of questioning. We should be
quick to file Fix-it requests for doors that do
not close completely, and not prop them
open. And if anyone sees a person walking
with a locked bike, don't be afraid to stop
them and amiably ask what they are up to.
The Department of Public Safety advises
such behavior as going to campus ATMs only
during the daytime, removing vehicular de
vices and mountings when away from the car
and recording the serial numbers of your
electronic equipment in case of theft. TTiese
and other conscientious behaviors will serve
us well in keeping our campus community as
amazingly safe as it us and our daily actions
unhindered.
Even if we are all on the lookout for suspi
cious activity, perhaps we would fail to catch
the audacious thieves who impersonated
piano repairmen and absconded with a Bran
ner piano several years back, but it would be
a start. By refusing to become complacent
and unaware of the potential threats, we can
help keep Stanford secure and free.
