# Little Ms. Modern
## Design for the people 
### 
After five years of the nomadic student
life. I've come to intimately understand
the critical first necessities of moving
into a new place: in the bathroom, toilet paper,
in the kitchen.Trader Joe's frozen pizzas and in
the bedroom, well, a bed. The first two items
are trivial to acquire, but finding oneself a bed
often proves more challenging. My preferred
solution, which developed over the course of
many hectic migrations, is now well-estab
lished: travel to the nearest IKEA, purchase
the cheapest bed they sell, assemble it accord
ing to their cute Swedish instruction cartoons
and enjoy a restful first night in your new
home.
This is precisely what I did during my most
recent move. My roommate, who also faced
the challenge of bedless-ness, took a consider
ably different tactic, one that I had never con
sidered. She rented a minivan, toured all of the
local Goodwills and Salvation Armys, found
an acceptable used bed to buy, and drove it
back. How novel! But it's funny how things
work out — despite our varying approaches,
we ended up with the exact same bed (the
DALSEV.for you fellow IKEA maniacs).and
we found that we had paid close to the exact
same price.
Our differing approaches to bed shopping
reveal conflicting attitudes towards modern
consumerism, an issue entrenched in difficult
contradictions and coated in a sticky layer of
admittedly deserved guilt. I default to IKEA
not only because I have no income, but also for
somewhat deeper reasons. Due to the enor
mous scale of their mass production opera
tions. IKEA's wares are dirt cheap, but still
well-designed and often delightfully beautiful.
Their message is cheerfully populist — by of
fering especially thoughtful design in an eco
nomically accessible way. the company under
mines the classism that is often strengthened
by the relative power to buy stuff.
The extreme accessibility of IKEA prod
ucts also makes them internationally übiqui
tous. A friend in Aachen, Germany and 1 have
the same orange flor-de-lis-covered bed
spread, each purchased at our respective local
warehouse. I find myself tickled by this univer
sality. but many modern people are discom
forted by the loss ol uniqueness and rareness.
It parallels our attitudes towards music —
some are happy to unite in a common love for
Justin Timberlake. while others feel they must
update their playlists whenever their favorite
band accumulates t<x) many fans.
This resistance to the universal in favor of
the rare is often also a fight against perceived
commercialism.The interests of corporate en
tities like IKEA lie in making money, a goal
which can often be achieved by cultivating a
base of dependent, controlled consumers who
are such devoted fans that they happily com
mit acts of free marketing (like writing articles
about their products in college newspapers).

Corporate control is certainly frightening —
we'd like to think that companies are serving
their customers, but what if it's the other way
around? Indeed, many people, probably in
cluding my roommate, view the übiquity of
IKEA products as the tightening grip of an un
welcome corporate hand around our throats.
Ironically, her efforts to escape the death
grip of commercialism were futile, in some
sense — she ended up with an IKEA bed any
way. But she probably still feels better than if
she had taken my route, because objects that
are unceremoniously stripped of their special
ty through mass ownership suddenly regain
some sparkle when they become second-hand.
They come attached wiih a story,or more inter
estingly, a mystery, about their past: they seem
to be imbued with a newfound authenticity.
The very same coffee mug that seems soulless
in a heaping pile of its peers at IKEA can sud
denly assume meaningful character when dis
covered at a thrift store. The problem is, of
course, that the coffee mugs are still, neverthe
less, the same. The authenticity, alas, is only a
fantasy. And it's especially hypocritical to self
righteously oppose consumerism when we are
still so clearly participating, albeit indirectly.
Is there a better answer than cheap mass
production or buying used? Perhaps. In re
sponse to these concerns, a new creative cul
ture focused on synthesis is developing. A blog
called "IKEA Hacker" documents one espe
cially interesting manifestation of this trend, in
which various contributors reinvent new
household objects from existing IKEA parts.
Some are small modifications, like inventive
light fixtures and re-imagined tabletop/legs
combinations. Others are more whimsical,like
a turtle terrarium made from a TV cabinet. All
the projects share a sense of unique identity
and personal meaning, but maintain the com
mon accessibility that characterizes the IKEA
parts they are comprised of.
By finding a dynamic process in products
that have always been merely static objects,
these hackers de-commodify the commodity
in a way that neither ordinary IKEA nor thrift
store purchases can do. The creators are in
spired. not controlled, by their purchases, and
the authenticity of their creations is legitimate
because they develop it themselves. It might
just be that the best modern design for the peo
ple is by the people themselves.

Caitlin is relocating again in June, and has a fan
tastic DA LSEV bed you might like to buy! If in
terested, reach her at niltiac@stanford.edu.
