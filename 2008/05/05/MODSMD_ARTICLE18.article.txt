## Celebrate your mothers 
### 
Allow me to deliver the following pub
lic service announcement for those of
you who haven't been visually bom
barded by the plethora of pastel pink greet
ing cards: this upcoming Sunday May 11, is
Mother's Day.
The origins of Mother's Day date back to
a time before Hallmark and 1-800-Flowers.
Many moons ago, the ancient Egyptians hon
ored the goddess Isis, mother of the
pharaohs, in an annual festival. In ancient
Greece, the mother deity C'ybele was also
celebrated in a festival every spring. In an
cient Rome, a festival called Matronalia paid
tribute not only to the goddess of childbirth.
Juno (like the movie!), but also to the moth
ers and women of the city. Husbands gave
gifts to their wives and women of the house
hold prepared a feast for the female slaves.
In Europe, Early Christians celebrated
"Mothering Sunday," but actually honored
the church in which they had been baptized
— their "Mother" church — not their birth
mothers. The day was transformed, later in
history, to celebrate actual mothers, too, and
members of the working class were given the
day off to travel home to visit their moms.
Lucky ducks.
The first phases of Mother's Day in the
United States began with Julia Ward Howe.
Twelve years after composing the rousing
lyrics to "The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
which is now rumored to be the unofficial an
them of the Republican Party, Howe recog
nized the futility of the war and issued the
Mother's Day Proclamation of 1870. In her
proclamation, she called for mothers around
the world to protest the war during a day that
would celebrate both peace and mother
hood.
Although Howe's vision never came to

fruition, her efforts were not in vain. In 1907,
Anna M. Jarvis campaigned for a Mother's
Day in remembrance of her activist mother,
Anna Reeves Jarvis. Anna M. quit work to
devote her life to petitioning for a day to cel
ebrate women and peace. In 1914, Woodrow
Wilson finally signed Mother's Day into na
tional observance and designated the second
Sunday in May as Mother's Day. On this day,
American citizens raised flags in honor of
mothers whose sons had died in the war.

Nowadays, Mother's Day is known for
other things — the highest grossing holiday
for flower sales, the most popular time of the
year to go out to restaurants, the best day to
break out the macaroni picture frames. But,
stripped of the pomp and capitalism-stance.
Mother's Day is still about honoring the ma
ternal presences in our lives, whether they
are our mothers, our friends, our teachers, a
Greek goddess or big mama Nature. And in
honor of the peace-seeking goals of Mother's
Day past, perhaps it is also a good day to set
aside any differences and appreciate the
women in your life who have cared about
you.
When I was younger, I used to agonize
over finding my mom the perfect present. 1
didn't have a car or money or common sense,
so I made do with what 1 had. Literally. 1
would forage for items around the house,
convince myself that she was unaware of

their existence, wrap them up in construction
paper and four rolls of Scotch tape and then
proudly present them to her. Despite the fact
that she had probably purchased nearly all of
the items 1 gifted her with, she acted sur
prised each time. Bless her soul.
As I have grown older, I now realize that I
actually celebrate my mom every day. As
those of you who know me can attest, the bet
ter portion of my wardrobe has been appro
priated from her closet. On any given day,
chances are I am wearing a part of her on me.
That sounds creepy, but my mom had some
pretty rocking threads. (Also, I'm cheap.)
If imitation is the sincerest form of flat
tery, then I also have been honoring my
mother in the fact that I am somehow, be
yond my control, turning into her. Every time
I freak out when 1 lose the tiniest thing, kick
a wayward grape aside at the grocery store so
no one will slip, find myself doling out a piece
of nonsensical, folksy advice... that's all be
cause of you. Mom.
That said, Mother's Day is still a great hol
iday because it reminds a lot of us to stop and
thank the people we often take for granted. I
know I plan on calling my mom and thanking
her for the never-ending supply of high
waisted skirts.
So honor the mothers of your life, whether
that involves re-wrapping something in your
dorm room, buying a cheesy card or simply
calling home and taking the time to have a
conversation that lasts longer than 25 sec
onds. Heck, maybe you could even go all out
and celebrate Mother's Week.

Natalie Jabbar wants to sincerely thank the ma
ternal figures who have graced her life. If you

tape, e-mail her at njabbar@stanford.edu.
