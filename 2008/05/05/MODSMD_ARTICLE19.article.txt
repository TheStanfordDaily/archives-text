## CARD WINS MPSF TITLE Stanford defeats Denver to claim fourth straight conference championship 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
The regular season may have heen a roller
coaster ride, but the Cardinal women's lacrosse
team seems to have knack for getting things done
when it counts. Stanford won its fourth straight
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) title
on Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley
after defeating Denver 9-8. avenging an earlier
loss to the Pioneers back on April 20.
The game was not over until the final nine sec
onds. however, when senior goalkeeper Laura
Shane stopped a shot from Denver's Karen Mor
ton. The Cardinal was led by freshman attacker

Sarah Flynn and sophomore midfielder Julie
Christy on offense; both had hat tricks on the day.
combining for six of the team's nine goals.
"We knew Denver was going to be a challenge
and that they would put up a fight at the end but
going out with four MPSF titles in a row is per
fect." said Shane. "I couldn't really ask for our
lacrosse careers to end any better than that. It's
just super exciting.
"I think we came out with a lot of confidence
this time." Shane said. "We knew what their game
plan was going to be and we had a much better
idea of how to shut that down. We just came out
and put together a full game and we came out on
top of them."

Shane was honored as the tournament's MVP.
hut was quick to praise the efforts of her team
mates.
"It's a really nice honor but I think it's really
just reflective of the whole team's effort and the
defense just played unbelievable the whole week
end so that makes my job a whole lot easier," she
said.
Senior attacker Megan McClain, senior de
fender Katharine Fox and sophomore midfielder
Dana Lindsay were all named to the all-tourna
ment team.

"We knew their
game plan. We had

The Cardinal took a 5-2 to lead to halftime and
continued its strong play in the second half, nearly
putting the Pioneers away with a 9-5 lead and only
five minutes remaining. Denver came back with a
flurry of three goals, however, and had a chance to
tie before Shane's save with nine seconds left.
Saturday's victory' over the Pioneers capped off
an impressive tournament run for the Cardinal.
Despite going only 3-2 in conference play, Stan
ford went through both Cal and Denver — teams
it had already lost to earlier in the season — to
claim the conference tournament title once again.
Stanford now looks to hear from the NCAA se
lection committee, which will decide whether the
team's body of work this year is good enough to
earn a bid to the 16-team NCAA Tournament,
which starts later this week. The MPSF is not a
strong enough conference to warrant an automat
ic bid, so the Cardinal will have to hope for one of
the eight at-large bids awarded every year by the
committee.
In the previous three years that the team won
the MPSF tournament, it was only invited to the
national tournament once. Stanford's regular sea
son does not particularly stand out, as the team is
12-8 overall and finished only 3-2 in the confer
ence games leading up to this past weekend's tour
nament.
That said, this year's team may be able to make
a stand with wins over top powers such as Penn
and Notre Dame. In any case, though, the Cardinal
certainly finished its season strong, regardless of
whether the team is invited to the NCAA Tourna
ment or not.
"Besides going to the NCAA Tournament, we
couldn't ask to go out in any better way," said
Shane, who may have played in her last game in a
Stanford uniform on Saturday. "It's really been an
incredible four years with a really incredible team
and we're super excited to have been the MPSF
champions for four years."
