# No change in store for med school aid
## Administrator stands behind current financial aid program 
### BY SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Changes are afoot for Stanford's rival medical
schools. In March, the Dean of Harvard Medical School
announced that the school will no longer require a fam
ily contribution from students whose parents earn less
than $120.00 per year. Three weeks later, the Yale School
of Medicine announced that it would eliminate the
required family contribution for households earning less
than $100,000 annually. The changes for both schools
will begin next year.
The Daily sat down with Charles Prober, Senior
Associate Dean of Medical Student Education, to ask if
the Stanford School of Medicine has any plans for simi
lar changes in its financial aid programs. Prober said as
yet. there are no plans to implement a policy compara
ble to Harvard and Yale's.
"Stanford tends to lead, not to follow," he said.
Prober stressed that it is critical to look at all the pieces
of a school's financial aid package, not just the required
parent contribution.
"When schools talk about removing the parent contri
bution and therefore tuition will be free, but on the other
hand they have a large student loan that obliges the stu
dent to take out debt — it's a little bit of a shell game," he
said. "Not that I'm accusing anyone of anything."

According to Prober, the bottom line in terms of
financial aid is a student's graduating debt; how much
that student owes in loans upon graduation.
"I say this to the incoming students: there's all this
complexity, but we want you to look at one number,
which is the average graduating debt," Prober said. "The
graduating debt — which we're very proud of —is
lower for Stanford students than for many of our com
petitors."
The graduating debt for the class of 2007 was $78,000
at Stanford, compared to $98,953 at Harvard and
$115,385 at Yale. TTie national average for private med
ical school is $150,000, according to Prober.
Despite the low graduating debt for its students, the
cost of attendance for the Stanford School of Medicine
is around $68,000 for the first year, according to Prober.
"Our sticker price is quite high," he said, but stressed
that very few students pay the full sticker price.
The price students actually pay is determined by sev
eral factors, including parental income and assets. As
long as a potential student is under 30 years old, his or
her parents are expected to contribute towards med
school tuition. Modifying factors include household size,
age of parents and how many of the family's children are
in college.
Prober said the key to
Stanford's low graduating debt lays
in several factors, including the
school's unit loan. A unit loan is the
amount each student is expected to
take out in loans towards tuition.
"A unit loan is like a deduction
on an insurance policy," Prober
explained. "This year's unit loan is
$13,500. Compared to the other
schools that I've mentioned, includ
ing our friends at Harvard and Yale,
it's the lowest unit loan out there."
If students have tuition left to
pay after the calculated parental
contribution and the unit loan.

Stanford covers the remainder with
a need-based grant.
Stanford has need-based financial
programs rather than merit-based
financial aid programs, since pick
ing students for any sort of merit
based scholarships would be nearly
impossible.
"We have 86 students and we
get 7,000 applicants," Prober said.
"There are a lot of meritorious
people in the bundle."
The need-based grants are
capped around $30,000. Any
remaining need must be covered by
outside loans or other sources.
Prober said Stanford also offers
many ways for students to earn
money towards their tuition bills.
"When we recruit medical stu
dents, we say, 'We want you to be
"doctors plus." We want you to be

leaders in something related to
healthcare when you graduate
from here,"' Prober explained.
To further this aim, medical stu
dents can earn up to $72,000 in
Stanford's Medical Scholars
Research Program by doing health
related research projects.
In addition, students can offset
their tuition bill with money earned
by working as teaching assistants, a
job that can be worth about $18,000
per quarter.
Med students are charged full
tuition for 13 quarters, after which
tuition drops by about 80 percent.
On average, Stanford med students
take five years to earn their
degrees, Prober said.
