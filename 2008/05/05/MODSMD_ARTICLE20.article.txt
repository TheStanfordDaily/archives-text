# Card outlasts Oregon schools
## Penna, Smith lead Stanford to Sunday win 
### DANIEL BOHM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team had
a successful weekend, winning all
three games in Oregon to com
plete season sweeps of both the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
Beavers.
Junior pitcher Missy Penna
continued her dominance in the
circle for the Cardinal as she
pitched complete games in all
three victories, including an eight
inning effort in Stanford's 2-1
extra inning win at Oregon State
on Sunday.
Senior third baseman Michelle
Smith was the hero in Sunday af
ternoon's game, as she doubled
home junior shortstop Maddy
Coon from second base with two
outs in the top of the eighth to give
the Cardinal the lead.
Coon got into scoring position
after being hit by a pitch and steal
ing second, setting the stage for
Smith.

Smith also knocked in Stan
ford's other run with an RBI single
to score pinch runner Michelle
Schroeder in the fourth to put the
Cardinal up 1-0.
Oregon State's lone run came
in the bottom of the sixth as desig
nated player Audrey Roderfield
drove a one-out Penna pitch over
the center field fence to tie the
score.
Sunday's win moved the eighth
ranked Cardinal to 45-10 overall
and 10-8 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence.
The victory completed a week
end sweep that began Friday after
noon in Eugene.
The Cardinal cruised past the
Ducks 6-0, pounding out 11 hits
against Oregon starter Melissa
Rice. Stanford also was able to take
advantage of five Oregon errors,
leading to three unearned runs.
The Cardinal led 1-0 entering
the final inning, but provided
Penna with plenty of insurance,
tacking on five more runs in the top
of the seventh to make it 6-0. The
big blow again came off the bat of
Smith who cracked a two-RBI
double to extend the lead to 3-0.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Stanford downed both Oregon and Oregon State this past weekend as it
nears the end of the regular season. The final match was an extra-inning
affair against the Beavers that the Cardinal won, 2-1, in eight innings.
Smith and sophomore second
baseman Shannon Koplitz led the
offensive onslaught for the Cardi
nal. Smith had a pair of hits, runs,
and RBIs, while Koplitz had the first
three-hit game of her Stanford ca
reer.
Penna was brilliant again, going
the full seven innings, allowing just
five hits and four walks, while strik
ing out ten in the shutout.
After Friday's game secured the
season sweep of Oregon, the Cardi
nal traveled to Corvallis to play Ore
gon State on Saturday and Sunday.
On Saturday the Cardinal of
fense managed just seven hits and
did not draw a walk — but took full
advantage of those hits, as it blasted
three homeruns, including two by
Coon to defeat the host Beavers 4-2.
Trailing 1-0 in the top of the sec
ond, Smith, who seems to have
found her stroke after struggling of
late, took a Kelly Dyer pitch over
the left field fence for her eighth
homerun of the season, and her first
in Pac-10 play.
Ttoo innings later Coon would

give the Cardinal the lead for good
as she dispatched the first pitch she
saw over the left field fence for a
two-run homerun, scoring pinch
runner Schroeder.
Coon would pick up where she
left off in her next at-bat. driving a
1-0 offering out to left center to ex
tend Stanford's lead to 4-1.
That would be more than enough
support for Penna, who scattered
four hits and a walk while allowing
two runs and striking out 11 en
route to her 32nd victory of the sea
son. She would then move to 33-9
with a win the following day.
Coon and sophomore center
fielder Alissa Haber were the only
Cardinal players with multiple hits,
as Coon went 2-for-3 with two
homeruns and three RBIs, while
Haber contributed a pair of singles
and a stolen base.
Stanford will look to build on the
momentum it gained this weekend
as it concludes its regular season
next weekend with a trip to the
desert to take on Arizona and Ari
zona State in three tremendously
important games.
With a pair of wins over the
Wildcats next week the Cardinal
can secure third place in the ultra
competitive Pac-10.
The Cardinal plays at Arizona

State Thursday before traveling to
Tucson to take on the Wildcats on
Friday and Saturday.

The Stanford softball team had
a successful weekend, winning all
three games in Oregon to com
plete season sweeps of both the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
Beavers.
Junior pitcher Missy Penna
continued her dominance in the
circle for the Cardinal as she
pitched complete games in all
three victories, including an eight
inning effort in Stanford's 2-1
extra inning win at Oregon State
on Sunday.
Senior third baseman Michelle
Smith was the hero in Sunday af
ternoon's game, as she doubled
home junior shortstop Maddy
Coon from second base with two
outs in the top of the eighth to give
the Cardinal the lead.
Coon got into scoring position
after being hit by a pitch and steal
ing second, setting the stage for
Smith.

Smith also knocked in Stan
ford's other run with an RBI single
to score pinch runner Michelle
Schroeder in the fourth to put the
Cardinal up 1-0.
Oregon State's lone run came
in the bottom of the sixth as desig
nated player Audrey Roderfield
drove a one-out Penna pitch over
the center field fence to tie the
score.
Sunday's win moved the eighth
ranked Cardinal to 45-10 overall
and 10-8 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence.
The victory completed a week
end sweep that began Friday after
noon in Eugene.
The Cardinal cruised past the
Ducks 6-0, pounding out 11 hits
against Oregon starter Melissa
Rice. Stanford also was able to take
advantage of five Oregon errors,
leading to three unearned runs.
The Cardinal led 1-0 entering
the final inning, but provided
Penna with plenty of insurance,
tacking on five more runs in the top
of the seventh to make it 6-0. The
big blow again came off the bat of
Smith who cracked a two-RBI
double to extend the lead to 3-0.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Stanford downed both Oregon and Oregon State this past weekend as it
nears the end of the regular season. The final match was an extra-inning
affair against the Beavers that the Cardinal won, 2-1, in eight innings.
Smith and sophomore second
baseman Shannon Koplitz led the
offensive onslaught for the Cardi
nal. Smith had a pair of hits, runs,
and RBIs, while Koplitz had the first
three-hit game of her Stanford ca
reer.
Penna was brilliant again, going
the full seven innings, allowing just
five hits and four walks, while strik
ing out ten in the shutout.
After Friday's game secured the
season sweep of Oregon, the Cardi
nal traveled to Corvallis to play Ore
gon State on Saturday and Sunday.
On Saturday the Cardinal of
fense managed just seven hits and
did not draw a walk — but took full
advantage of those hits, as it blasted
three homeruns, including two by
Coon to defeat the host Beavers 4-2.
Trailing 1-0 in the top of the sec
ond, Smith, who seems to have
found her stroke after struggling of
late, took a Kelly Dyer pitch over
the left field fence for her eighth
homerun of the season, and her first
in Pac-10 play.
Ttoo innings later Coon would

give the Cardinal the lead for good
as she dispatched the first pitch she
saw over the left field fence for a
two-run homerun, scoring pinch
runner Schroeder.
Coon would pick up where she
left off in her next at-bat. driving a
1-0 offering out to left center to ex
tend Stanford's lead to 4-1.
That would be more than enough
support for Penna, who scattered
four hits and a walk while allowing
two runs and striking out 11 en
route to her 32nd victory of the sea
son. She would then move to 33-9
with a win the following day.
Coon and sophomore center
fielder Alissa Haber were the only
Cardinal players with multiple hits,
as Coon went 2-for-3 with two
homeruns and three RBIs, while
Haber contributed a pair of singles
and a stolen base.
Stanford will look to build on the
momentum it gained this weekend
as it concludes its regular season
next weekend with a trip to the
desert to take on Arizona and Ari
zona State in three tremendously
important games.
With a pair of wins over the
Wildcats next week the Cardinal
can secure third place in the ultra
competitive Pac-10.
The Cardinal plays at Arizona

State Thursday before traveling to
Tucson to take on the Wildcats on
Friday and Saturday.
