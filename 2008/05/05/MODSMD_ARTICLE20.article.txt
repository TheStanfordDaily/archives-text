## Penna, Smith lead Stanford to Sunday win 
### DANIEL BOHM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team had
a successful weekend, winning all
three games in Oregon to com
plete season sweeps of both the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
Beavers.
Junior pitcher Missy Penna
continued her dominance in the
circle for the Cardinal as she
pitched complete games in all
three victories, including an eight
inning effort in Stanford's 2-1
extra inning win at Oregon State
on Sunday.
Senior third baseman Michelle
Smith was the hero in Sunday af
ternoon's game, as she doubled
home junior shortstop Maddy
Coon from second base with two
outs in the top of the eighth to give
the Cardinal the lead.
Coon got into scoring position
after being hit by a pitch and steal
ing second, setting the stage for
Smith.

Smith also knocked in Stan
ford's other run with an RBI single
to score pinch runner Michelle
Schroeder in the fourth to put the
Cardinal up 1-0.
Oregon State's lone run came
in the bottom of the sixth as desig
nated player Audrey Roderfield
drove a one-out Penna pitch over
the center field fence to tie the
score.
Sunday's win moved the eighth
ranked Cardinal to 45-10 overall
and 10-8 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence.
The victory completed a week
end sweep that began Friday after
noon in Eugene.
The Cardinal cruised past the
Ducks 6-0, pounding out 11 hits
against Oregon starter Melissa
Rice. Stanford also was able to take
advantage of five Oregon errors,
leading to three unearned runs.
The Cardinal led 1-0 entering
the final inning, but provided
Penna with plenty of insurance,
tacking on five more runs in the top
of the seventh to make it 6-0. The
big blow again came off the bat of
Smith who cracked a two-RBI
double to extend the lead to 3-0.
