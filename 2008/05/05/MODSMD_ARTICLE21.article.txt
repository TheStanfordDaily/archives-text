the Spartans jumped out to an early 1-
0 lead in the first.
Stanford remained scoreless on
Saturday until a three-run fourth in
ning that warmed up the Cardinal
hats. Junior Cord Phelps led off the
rally with his 29th walk of the season
which was followed by a perfectly

placed double down the left field line
from sophomore Toby Gerhart. With

ended the day for Spartan pitcher An

followed by a RBI double from Ger

After the one-two offensive punch


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Toby Gerhart and the rest of the Stanford bats exploded against San Jose State on Sunday, as the Cardinal plated eleven
runs in the ninth inning to put away the Spartpns. The big inning capped a two game weekend series win for Stanford.
from the Stanford lineup, freshman
right hander Alex Pracher and left
hander Michael De Groot teamed up
for the eighth and ninth innings as the
pair and Yount combined to shut
down the last 13 Spartan batters in
order to end the game.
After Saturday's commanding
performance, the Cardinal got a
rude awakening from the Spartans,
who claimed a 6-1 lead until the
eighth inning. The first half of the
game proved to be a pitcher's duel
with Stanford's Erik Davis and
SJSU's Scott Sobczak pitching four
scoreless innings. Davis allowed only
four hits and no earned runs over five
innings of work while Sobczak al
lowed five hits and three runs over 7.2
innings in the no-decision.
Stanford's first run came in the top
of the fifth with a long solo bomb
from junior Sean Ratliff, marking his
12th homerun and 38th RBI on the
year. The Cardinal wouldn't hold the
lead for long, as San Jose would an
swer with two runs.
The real Spartan offensive show
ing would come in the fifth when they
scored five runs, establishing their 6-1
lead. Though San Jose played well of

fensively, they got lucky and scored
two unearned runs due to a throwing
error by Milleville which prolonged
the inning. Senior right hander David
Stringer took over the inning from
Davis hut gave up three more runs
and was unable to record an out for
the Cardinal.
Stanford never said never, though,
and racked up 16 runs in the eighth
and ninth to seize the weekend sweep
of the Spartans. Ratliff bashed his sec
ond homerun of the game to cap the
eighth inning at a nail-biting 6-6. The
explosion came in the ninth when the
Cardinal scored 11 runs on 12 hits to
turn both of the weekend's games
into Stanford blowouts. 18 of 20 hit
ters reached base safely over both the
eighth and ninth innings to give Stan
ford the decisive victory.
The two wins improved Stanford's
record to 27-15-2. The team stands
tied atop the conference with Ari
zona State at 10-5 in Pac-10 play. Stan
ford will now turn its attention to the
final ten games of the regular season,
and then the NCAA Regionals. The
Cardinal will continue its match-ups
with non-conference opponents this
week, taking on Pacific tonight at
Sunken Diamond and the University
of San Francisco tomorrow on the
road.
