Synchro ties for national title
The Stanford synchronized
swimming team proved once again
that it was the best collegiate team
in the nation this past weekend, and
maybe the best squad in the country.
The Cardinal women tied for
first place at this weekend's U.S. Na
tional Synchronized Swimming
Championship in Tucson, Ariz.,
sharing the title with the Santa
Clara Aquamaids, a local club team.
Stanford and Santa Clara tied with
total scores of 40, easily topping the
nearest competition which was third
place Ohio State at 27.
"I am so proud of our team and
how they did here," coach Heather
Olson told GoStanford.com. "It is
very difficult to pick back up after
NCAAs with no recovery time and
perform they way they did here this
week. We had the best swims of the
season and that was our team goal
for the meet. This team performed
better than 1 could have anticipat
ed."
Senior Sara Lowe was the star for
Stanford, winning the solo title after

scoring a 95.677. Lowe's success did
not stop there, however, as she won
a duet title alongside fellow senior
Courtenay Stewart after the duo
scored a 96.000.
The Cardinal capped off its suc
cess in the team competition after
its squad of Lowe, Stewart, seniors
Poppy Carlig and Melissa Knight,
junior Erin Bell, sophomores Deb
bie Chen and Taylor Durand, and
freshmen Corinne Smith and
Michelle Moore finished in first
with a 96.083.
Stanford's performance this
weekend concluded a perfect sea
son for the team after the women
won their fourth national title over a
month ago at the Collegiate Cham
pionships. Finishing the season with
a championship in Tucson was sim
ply "icing on the cake," as Durand
put it, to a dominant season by a
dominant Cardinal squad.
Crew takes down Cal
The men's crew team captured
the Schwabacher Cup on Saturday,
defeating the California Golden
Bears to grab the prestigious trophy

for the first time since 1991.
The Cardinal's victory in the
2,000-meter event was a close one,
as it finished in 5:42.52, just 0.87 sec
onds ahead of Cal.
"We rowed a good race today
against a traditional national pow
erhouse." said senior Silas Stafford.
Stanford also raced an all-fresh
man boat that was able to hold its
own: the squad finished 4.30 sec
onds behind the Golden Bears'
freshman team.
At the same matchup at Red
wood Shores, Cal downed the Car
dinal women's rowing team, win
ning by 4.10 seconds. Stanford was
competitive for the majority of the
race, but Cal was able to pull away
once the teams approached the fin
ish line.
"[Stanford] learned today about
the kind of effort it is going to take
to make the medals at the Pac-10's
in two weeks," said Yasmin Farooq,
the women's head coach."That said,
the team is improving steadily."
