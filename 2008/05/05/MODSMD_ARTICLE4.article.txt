# GRADAUATE LIFE
## Grad student grants promote community Grants offered to encourage social events and academic collaboration 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Nick Weiler and Nick Steinmetz noticed
something unusual in their first year as neuro
science grad students.
"Grad school can be sort of isolating and
fragmented," Weiler said.
"All your time is spent in a lab," Steinmetz
added. "If you don't have an explicit reason to
go around and meet people, you won't."
Weiler and Steinmetz, roommates in Rains
and acquaintances since their Ph.D. interviews,
decided to do something about the lack of a
thriving graduate social community. They
received a $5,0(X) grant to foster discussion and
build community from Stanford's Office of the
Vice Provost for Graduate Education. The
office awarded seven grants to students in dif
ferent departments. The awards are known as

SPICE, Student Projects for Intellectual
Community Enhancement.
The SPICE grants are not just about chat
ting up other grad students, Steinmetz
explained. He said that the nature of grad
school necessitates collaboration.
"As an undergrad, you take all these classes
and do the homework, and you learn what
you're supposed to learn," he said. "As a grad
student, it's a much different ballgame. You
have to figure out what you need to know, what
kinds of questions to ask and what kinds of
hypotheses to make. One of the best strategies
is not just reading books, but discussing science
with other people."
As an example, Weiler mentioned a course
he is taking with neuroscience students from a
variety of different subfields.
"It's good seeing their point of view and
hearing the types of questions they ask, |since
they have] a different sort of background and
do different types of experiments," he said of
his classmates.
To foster this kind of discussion outside of
the classroom. Weiler and Steinmetz sent out a

survey to learn what sorts of activities interest
ed their fellow grad students. The survey got
responses from a third of the 90 neuroscience
graduate students, and the most popular option
was a series of lunchtime talks at which students
could discuss their own research.
The schedule of the lunchtime talks is still in
the works, but discussions "will encourage dis
cussion of the ideas behind the research," said
Steinmetz. "They'll be less focused on the data
and the experimental protocol and more
focused on the concepts and how they designed
the experiment and came up with hypotheses."
The research talks will also include snacks.
Ninety percent of the $S,(XX) grant will pay for
catered lunches, Steinmetz said.
"Grad students are notorious for enjoying
free food," he explained. "It's not a misplaced
stereotype."
Other planned activities include a book club
and movie showings — "fun get-togethers with
a neuroscience flavor," Weiler explained.
The book club will start in the summer, and
the first hooks are still being chosen.
"It could be a hard science book, or
a book by Oliver Sacks, or neuro-sci
ence fiction like Neuromancer,"
Weiner said.
Grad students will not have to
wait until summer for the movie
showings — the kickoff event was
last Friday.
"We watched 'Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind,'" Steinmetz
said. "It's my favorite neuroscience
movie."
