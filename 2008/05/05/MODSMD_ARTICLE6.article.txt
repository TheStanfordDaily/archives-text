## Ugandan journalist faces jail Knight Fellow alleges government misdeeds 
### ANNEKE NELSON STAFF WRITER 
Andrew Mwenda, a 35-year-old
Ugandan journalist and former
Knight Fellow, was arrested on April
26 after investigating allegations of
torture at the hands of the Ugandan
government. Though Mwenda is
currently out on bail, he could face
up to 75 years in prison for 15 counts
of "sedition" and "promoting sectar
ianism." according to his lawyer.
Mwenda's spent the 2006-2007
school year at Stanford after being
awarded one of the John S. Knight
Fellowships for Professional
Journalists, which give mid-career
journalists the opportunity to study
at the University Twelve journalists
from the United States and eight
from other countries are chosen.
"Mwenda got started [in journal
ism] when he was in university,"
Fellowship Director Jim Bettinger
said. "He's always been interested in
political journalism."
Mwenda was a long-time
reporter and writer for The Monitor,
a national Ugandan newspaper. He
had a nightly political call-in talk
show called Andrew Mwenda Live
— the most listened-to program in
Uganda, according to Bettinger.
In December 2007, Mwenda
started The Independent. a
bimonthly newspaper out of
Kampala. Uganda. On its Web site.
The Independent boasts:
"Uncensored News, Views &
Analysis."
It was this uncensored news that
led to Mwenda's arrest.
Mwenda and fellow journalists had
interviewed detainees held by the
government in Kampala and around
the country.
"We interviewed 17 people who
were arrested and detained for
years in [secret] prisons euphemisti
cally called safe houses," Mwenda
wrote in a May 2 email to Bettinger.
After learning of his investiga
tion, Uganda's Chieftaincy of
Military Intelligence (CMI) set out
to arrest Mwenda and two other
Independent journalists. In the
process, they searched his house and
ransacked The Independent office
for offending materials.
Gaaki Kigambo wrote an article
for The Independent about
Mwenda's arrest entitled "Andrew
Mwenda detained."
"At his house, the police confis
cated his lap-top, flash disks, 43 CDs
full of information," Kigambo
wrote. "The team is searching for

seditious material that the publica
tion is in possession of; transcripts
and audios of interviews of alleged
torture victims."
In the article, Mwenda described
his arrest.
"There were not witnesses
around," he said. "1 realized the
state wanted me to disappear with
out a trace. So I opened the car win
dow and shouted at people along
the road that I was Andrew
Mwenda being kidnapped by CMI.
At this point, the security operatives
pulled me back and this time hand
cuffed me so that I do not cause
more trouble."
Mwenda updated Bettinger on
his current situation in the May 2
email.
"Now they are trying to stop us
from printing the stories through
this intimidation, but we have firmly
held our ground," he wrote. "We are
very strong and determined to
defend the cause of liberty in this
country — even if it means forgoing
our freedom (by going to jail) or our
lives (if they kill us)."
He now reports every other day

to the police, although as of yet there
are no formal charges against him.
"The state seems determined and
resolved to do us harm." Mwenda
said in the email. "But we are also
determined and deeply resolved to
hold the fort of democracy and
defend it with tenacious zeal."
Bettinger said he was proud of
Mwenda s strength.
"1 think he's a very courageous
man, and this kind of outrage is
unconscionable." Bettinger said.
Mwenda gave further instruc
tions to Bettinger in his email.
"To all those you are talking to,
inform them that there are people
here in Africa determined to make a
difference in their country — what
ever the cost,"he said. "The conse
quences on us as individuals are not
particularly important and should
not obscure the cause we are fight
ing for. The fundamental issue of
contention is not our personal safe
ty, hut the future of liberty and free
dom in Uganda."
