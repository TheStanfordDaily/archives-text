## CARDINAL CAPTURES THIRD TITLE IN FOUR YEARS 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's rugby
team overcame a pair of tough
opponents and slow starts to claim
its fourth national championship,
and third in four years. After a big
second half in a 40-20 victory over
Navy in the semifinals, the Cardinal
needed a score in the final seconds
to get past Penn State, 17-10, in the
final.
On Friday, Navy got the first
points of the day with a kick for
three points after unsuccessful push
es back and forth by both teams.

Stanford finally scored a try late in
the first half with freshman Jennifer
Cooperrider putting the Cardinal on
the board.
Sophomore wing Jessica Watkins
notched the first of her four tries in
the match just before the end of the
half. Senior fullback Melissa Smit
scored one of the two conversions,
and Stanford went into halftime
with a 12-3 lead.
After halftime, though, the
momentum shifted to Navy and
Stanford found itself suddenly trail
ing, 15-12, after two tries and one
successful conversion early in the

Lions downed the Cardinal in last year's national title game, but could not find similar success this season.
half. Though Navy held a size advan
tage, the Cardinal played to its
strengths, beating the Midshipmen
with quick passes and speed.
Watkins scored to put the Cardinal
back on top after a sprint down the
sideline that saw her dodging tacklers
for half the length of the field. That try
and the conversion put the Cardinal
on top for good at 19-15.
Senior captain Erin Kobashigawa
commented on the comeback. "We
turned up the defense and did a better
job of keeping the ball, better ball re
tention. We were calmer and really
worked together to score some tries,"
she said.
Watkins quickly scored another,
again outrunning the Navy defense to
earn a hat trick, putting her team up
26-15. Navy managed one more try,
but missed a conversion attempt from
near the sideline, to close the gap to
26-20. Watkins answered again and
senior prop Rachel Danford added in
surance with a try that brought the
final score to 40-20 and sent the Cardi
nal into the national championship
match.
Defending national champion
Penn State, who edged Stanford in a

heartbreaking 22-21 final last spring,
beat Brown in the other semifinal by a
score of 41-7 to earn a return trip to
the championship. Unlike last year,
which saw the Nittany Lions score 17
points in the first halt this final was a
defensive battle as neither team was
able to score early.
Stanford was the first to break
through, with Watkins again turning
the corner and beating the defense
down the sideline. Senior flyhalf Jossy
Tseng added another try before half
time, putting the Cardinal ahead 10-0
after Smit missed both conversion at
tempts.
After the halftime break, Penn
State finally broke through to cut the
Stanford lead to 10-5 after a try and
missed conversion. After a second try
for the Nittany Lions, a conversion
would have given them a lead, but the
kick from near the sideline fell short
and the score was tied at 10.
That tie held through most of the
half and overtime looked inevitable
when Stanford began to drive as time
was running out. With the clock read
ing zeros, the Cardinal moved up the
field and it was Watkins who broke
through and was tackled into the try

zone, giving Stanford the 15-10 win
and the 2008 national championship.
"We actually didn't know that time
was out. After Penn State scored their
last try, we knew that it was a tie game
and there was about five minutes left,
hut we had our backs to the score
board. We just held onto the ball and
worked hard to get downfield. We did
a great job keeping the drive on and
then a hole opened up and we took it,"
said Kobashigawa.
This is the Cardinal's fourth cham
pionship after winning back-to-back
titles in 2005 and 2006, along with its
first in 1999.
"The celebration was awesome.
I'm a senior and it was one of the best
feelings I've had in four years, to final
ly play like we knew that we could and
play to our full potential. We worked
hard this season and feeling that all
that work paid off was brilliant," said
Kobashigawa.
In the men's final, also held at Stan
ford's Steuber Stadium. California
blew out BYU by a score of 59-7 to
win its fifth consecutive title.
