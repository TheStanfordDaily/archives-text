# Annual Cook-Off sizzles
## Five teams compete for culinary fame 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
In front of the salad bar in Wilbur din
ing hall, Stanford students in white
paper hats and buttoned chef coats
labor over steaming pots and pans. It's
just after 5 p.m. on Friday, and five
teams arc hard at work in Stanford's fifth an
nual Cardinal Cook-Off, Stanford Dining's
culinary challenge for gastronomically in
clined students.
"The competition is heating up here," says
an announcer wearing a suit and polka-dot
tie. He outlines this year's Cook-Off rules. All
teams start with 40 points and lose them for
any flaws in their cuisine. Organization
counts for 10 points; cooking skills and tech
nique also count for 10; and taste counts for
20 points.The required ingredient this year is
local halibut, he explains.
Judges walk around with clipboards, and
each group has a kitchen timer, which is cur
rently counting down from 28 minutes.
The Daily has permission to shadow one
duo. Wendi Goh '09 and Sarah Dyen '09 are
wearing chef coats with "Team Infusion" em
blazoned in red. Ihey are preparing halibut
three ways, inspired by three different
cuisines â€” from China; cilantro, sesame and
ginger halibut; from Japan: halibut in a
caramelized nnso sauce; and from Thailand:
halibut poached in red curry.

The curry bubbles enticingly as Sarah lifts
out an egg noodle and drops it in her mouth.
"They need a little more time," she says,
chewing carefully.
Wendi changes her latex gloves and coats
a small pink plate with sugar. "We're ready to
caramelize the halibut," she explains.
Wendi rolls bite-sized fish pieces in the
sugar until they're evenly coated. She drops
them in a pan of oil, where they sizzle satisfy
ingly.They're light brown and smell fishy and
sweet.
To Wendi and Sarah's right, the first team
has finished minutes before the deadline.
"Congratulations to team one!" says the
announcer with the polka-dot tie. He carries
the microphone over to interview Tito Bal
samo '11 and Lara Ortiz-Luis Tl, who dis
play their finished plate. Gathered spectators
clap and cheer.
Lara and Tito made herb-crusted halibut
with pan-seared prawns and apple-fennel
salad.
" How'd it go?" asks the announcer.
"I think it went well," says Lara."We kept
calm."
Tito adds that they made a last-minute
change to the way their food was arranged on
the plate. "We changed a symmetrical pres
entation to a fish shape," he said.
The dining hall has gotten more crowded
as Wilbur residents show up for dinner. "This
is so cool," says one spectator.
Another student squints at the plate. "Is

that a balsamic reduction?" he asks skepti
cally. "You'll never taste the shrimp under
that."
One plate is offered for spectator sam
pling, two are saved for the judges' palates
and the last is scored on presentation.
Team Infusion's timer reads 6:36. Sarah
examines it anxiously and moves the device
closer to Wendi.Then she leaves the table for
a few minutes. When she returns, she whis
pers to Wendi in urgent tones.
"What do you mean it doesn't work?"
Wendi says. "What happened?
Stanford Dining Food Service Supervisor
Jeff Rosen is close by."Jeff!" says Sarah. "Our
steamer isn't working!"
The group tried to heat their cilantro-gin
ger halibut in the provided steamer, but the
appliance was broken. Jeff's solution is to set
the foil-wrapped halibut in a pot with some
boiling water. There are no pot lids, so Sarah
sets a fry pan on top of the pot to trap the
steam. She looks worried.
Wendi presses on. She's laid cubes of
sticky rice on four plates and carefully
spreads pesto mayonnaise on top.
"It's a spin on traditional Japanese cui
sine," she says.
Jeff is back to check on Team Infusion.
"The judges should have their plates in 3:40,"
says Jeff. "Do you feel good about that?"
"Yep," says Wendi, a little unconvincing
ly. She is rolling thinly shaved slices of cu
cumber in soy sauce and shaping them ar

tistically.
When the plates are done, each has a neat
line of all three halibut dishes. The steamed
cilantro-ginger halibut rests on a bed of cu
cumber. Red curry and halibut tops a tiny
bowl of egg noodles. A rice cube is stacked
with pesto mayonnaise, an avocado slice and
the caramelized halibut.
Sarah examines the plates. "Let's send
these two to the judges," she suggests, point
ing.
Wendi uses a napkin to wipe any stray soy
sauce off the plates, and Team Infusion is
ready to be judged.
The announcer swoops in. His forehead is
damp by this point in the contest.
"Let's hear it for the team!" he says. When
the applause has died down, he extends the
microphone for comment.
Sarah ducks, so Wendi speaks up.
"We had a couple of hiccups," she says.
"There were some technical difficulties with
the steamer."
"Improvisation is the heart of good cook
ing," declares the announcer.
At 6:0(), the last teams are frantically as
sembling their plates. There's a break while
the judges sample the food and discuss their
choices.
The winners are supposed to be an
nounced at 6:30, but the judges are still shuf
fling papers at 6:35.
Wendi chats with supporters while she
waits for the results.
"I feel pretty good, all things considered."
she says, when asked about her chances for
first place. She explains that in addition to the
problem with the steamer, the team's induc
tion burner broke at the beginning of the con

test. They eventually got a new one, but they
wasted a lot of time waiting.
Wendi says she has three chef coats by
now. She and Sarah have participated in the
Cook-Off since their freshman year and were
allowed to keep them after each contest.
"Freshman year, we had our first names
embroidered. Sophomore year, our last
names. And this year. Team Infusion,""
Wendi says. "We won third place freshman
year, and fifth place last year, so hopefully
this is our year."
Finally, the judges call on all competitors
to line up for a group picture. Most still have
their coats and hats on, and they smile nerv
ously.
"There can only be one first place, but
you're all winners," says Jeff."Every year you
guys raise the bar."
"Thank you. Chef Jeff," says the announc
er in the polka-dot tie. Fifth place goes to Tito
and Lara, while Phil Stenberg GSB 08 and
Carrie Bourguignon GSB '08 took fourth
place.
The nail-biting ends for Wendi and Sarah
when the announcer hands them a third
place certificate.
Jenna Yang '11 and Sarah Grandin '11 re
ceive second place, which leaves John
McGee '08 and Greg Williams '08 holding up
an enormous $1000 check. There's a pause
for pictures.
"Our reigning champions!" says the an
nouncer.
For Team Infusion, there's always next
year.
