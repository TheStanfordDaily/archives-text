## New parking structure to open this month 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
The 1,180-space Wilbur underground
Parking Structure 6 (PS6) is scheduled to open
later this month, pending regulator)' inspections.
Once the structure is complete, several parking
lots on campus are scheduled to close.
According to Mark Bonino, special projects
manager at the Department of Project
Management, the regulatory inspections are
currently under way to prepare for a May 20
opening.
"Each construction project has inspections
by regulator)' agencies before the work can be
considered completed," Bonino said. "In this
case, we will have inspections on most of the
major components, including life safety systems,
fire protection systems, elevators and emer
gency generators."
The temporary parking lot outside of Soto —
constructed to address the parking deficit
between the closure of the Stern and Law
School lots — will close in accordance with con
ditions set by the County of Santa Clara, Bonino
added.
Although a fence has been placed at the
front, this parking lot will continue to operate
until May 20.
"The fence in front of this parking lot was
placed for its eventual closure and use for con
struction and logistical support," Bonino said.
The parking lot across from Vaden will also
close upon completion of PS6.
According to Bonino. the Vaden parking lot
needs to be reconfigured to provide safe access
onto Bowdoin Lane, which serves as the princi
pal entry into the parking structure.
"It is scheduled to re-open in the early sum
mer," he said of the Vaden lot.
The Wilbur underground parking structure is

being constructed primarily for student use, but
it will also have commuter, visitor and disabled
parking.
Bonino said the landscape and related site
work will continue through June.
On a similar construction schedule, the
Munger Graduate Residences project is still
underway. When completed, the Munger
Residences will provide housing for 600 gradu
ate students near the center of the Stanford
campus. Campus parking and transportation in
the surrounding areas have been heavily affect
ed by the construction project.
According to Bonino. the Munger Graduate
Residences is scheduled to open in phases
between January and June 2009.
"[Currently], the first building is being
enclosed, while the second building will be
enclosed within the next couple of weeks," he
said.
Throughout this week, there will be intermit
tent one-way traffic control on Arguello Mall
between Campus Drive and Bowdoin Lane due
to construction on a new walkway along
Arguello Way.
