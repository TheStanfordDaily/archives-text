## Sick Sad World Why do you read this page? 
### 
Why do you read the Ops
Section of the Daily? Real
ly — why? As 1 rush to
meet my last deadline as a Daily
columnist, I have been looking
through the columnist archives.
Jumping ffom writer to writer has
made me realize that between us
columnists and the editorial board,
we all have very different ideas of
what is supposed to be on this page.
And I'm positive that you. dear read
er, have an opinion all your own. In a
world where we can get information
almost effortlessly and get a feel for
the student pulse via Facebook and
blogs, what's the purpose of an ops
section?
Columnists tend to view them
selves as "personalities," with four
loose categories of style: the shit-stir
rers, the storytellers, the political
commentators, and the jaded ob
servers. Sure, we fluctuate from week
to week, experimenting with differ
ent roles and voices, but at the end of
the day, each of us inevitably returns
to one of these vantage points. Rat
tells a story. Darren stirs the shit.
Andy used to be our politics guy.
Chris is our sardonic observer. And
so it goes, each columnist sharing his
or her persona and outlook, one self
aware profile photo at a time.
Compare this to the edit board,
who use anonymity to step up on a
soap box and try to pump some kind
of feeling into an apathetic student
body. ITieir articles can also be split
into four loose categories: student
happenings, passing judgment on
new (or old) school programs, na
tional politics, and space fillers. (As
someone who has written an op-ed
belonging to the latter category, I'll
own up and take the hit: I wrote
about fun things to do on the week
end. It was a dark moment in my life.
We're human, it happens.)
So. what's supposed to be happen
ing in this section of the paper? Is the
goal to entertain you while you
munch your Smart Start? Should we
take a stand, piss you off. and give
you something to write about on the
"online comment feature"? Should
we be a blog? A formal argumenta
tive essay? 1 don't think that anyone
has ever asked the readers what they
want to read. I'd like to know. Just
don't tell me that you want more
sports, because that will break my
heart.
What role can this page fill that
isn't accomplished via either a social
networking site or a national news
source? There is so much informa
tion available to challenge the pur
pose of a college newspaper, let
alone*an Ops Section. One argument
is that the Daily provides quality
control — writers are chosen and ar
ticles are edited before they go to
print. But blogs have built-in quality
controls, as well — the most viewed
ones, presumably the most interest
ing, rise to the top. the bad ones sink
to the bottom. So what's our niche?
How do we stay pertinent? The for
mal op-ed section is a recent inven
tion, starting in 1970 at 'ITie New
York Times — time's not up yet. is it?

1 spied on some other college pa
pers to try to find the fountain of op
ed youth. ITiankfully, they are grop
ing around, as well. The ops page at
the Harvard Crimson reads like a
neurotic co-ed's diary. Monday's
signed pieces were titled: "Finding
Happiness at Harvard," "On Doing
Well," "The Best Four Years of Your
Life?" "Believing In Your Thesis,"
'"Holding On' Through Harvard,"
and "Shifting the Race Debate."
These titles speak for themselves.
On the other end of the spectrum,
in 2(K)5, University of Pennsylvania's
The Daily Pennsylvanian was con
sidered by Newsweek to have a slick
business model, and by all financial
accounts, the paper is doing pretty
well for itself. But its ops page reads
like a business journal. It's well-in
formed, clearly structured, and —
erm — boring as hell.
When 1 asked one of my friends
what he would like to read, he said.
"Stereotypes. Give me more stereo
types. 1 want the jock. 1 want the
Rasta-guy. I want the indie girl who
hates life. Let me read about them
and make fun of them at lunch. I
want to be entertained."
I don't know how I feel about this
idea. I have to admit, we columnists
are an eerily homogeneous bunch —
put our column pictures together
and the albedo is startling. But if we
want to get more viewpoints on the
Ops Page, we need a greater pool of
applicants from which to choose.
Mention the Daily at a SLAC meet
ing, and you get knowing glances
and jaded stares, not a line of appli
cants. 1 would sort of like to read a
first-hand account of the hunger
strike. Or why someone thinks that
Roe v. Wade should be reversed. But
diversity is different from stereo
types (clearly). Making the sole pur
pose of this page into a textual song
and dance seems like a cheap solu
tion. I agree that more diversity on
the ops page would be appreciated,
but 1 want to learn something or get
worked up from reading an op-ed,
not be mindlessly entertained via ex
pected cliches.
Ultimately, we are at a crucial
time in the direction of college pa
pers, and ops sections in particular. A
communication professor recently
told me offhandedly that the only
current purpose of a college paper is
to train writers for when they have
something to say. and to be ready for
commentary in case another Azia
Kim happens. For all other cases,
their purpose is waning.This can't be
true — can it?
