# Stu's Views
## Hillary and Obama on campus 
### 
The battle for the Democratic
nomination is very much a bat
tle of demographics. Hillary
Clinton has marshaled the support of
Latinos. Barack Obama has African-
Americans. Clinton has lower-mid
dle-class blue-collar voters. Obama
has highly educated professionals.
But Obama also has a stranglehold on
one key constituency — college stu
dents. One poll shows that Obama
leads the 18-24 age group 71-29 over
Clinton. Hie support for Obama
among the youngest voters has trans
lated to the Stanford campus. The
main Stanford Obama Facebook
group has 1044 students; "Stanford
Students for 1 lillary" has 81.
It's tough being a Hillary support
er on a college campus. I interviewed
a variety of public Hillary supporters
on campus, and their experiences
tended to be uniformly negative.
Obama supporters were often dis
missive or aggressive. While most
Obama supporters are clearly not in
clined to engage in aggressive politi
cal tactics, the lack of substantial al
ternatives to Obama on campus en
tails a veritable echoing chamber.
One Hillary supporter complained
that some Obama supporters were
extraordinarily self-righteous and
could not comprehend supporting
any other candidate. Many Hillary
supporters also seemed surprised at
the level of anti-Hillary vitriol on
campus. One had posters on his door
torn down repeatedly. Another told
some Stanford student activists she
was supporting Hillary, who yelled
back, "That bitch!" It's unclear
whether they were deriding the sup

porter or the candidate.
I"he anti-Hillary sentiment trans
lates even to Stanford administrators.
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Julie Lythcott-Haims is a well
known Obama supporter and dele
gate to the Democratic National
Convention. Until recently, she was a
member of a Facebook group enti
tled "Stop Hillary Clinton (One Mil
lion Strong AGAINST Hillary)."
Lythcott-Haims left the group after I
emailed her about it, commenting, "I
have had no indication that the 'Stop
Hillary' group is participating in the
mean-spirited activities you de
scribed, and that 1 despise. 1 left the
group because I do not want my ac
tions or intentions on behalf of
Obama to be misconstrued."
Obama's ability to appeal to col
lege students is certainly impressive.
In a campus culture that embraces
and emphasizes racial and ethnic
identities. Obama's mixed-race back
ground is compelling, more so than
the feminist appeal of Hillary. Race is
a sensitive subject, however. One
Hillary supporter complained, 'it's
like we have to go underground with
our support at Stanford lest we be la
beled...racially insensitive." Another
says of Obama supporters, "They as
sume that anv liberal, forward-think

ing student would automatically sup
port the mixed-race candidate...l
don't understand why Hillary doesn't
receive just as much celebration for
her woman-ness as Barack does for
his mixed-race-ness."
While Obama's ethnic back
ground is treasured and lionized,
Hillary's history-making identity as a
woman is often derided or dismissed.
On a racially sensitive campus, gen
der has nowhere near the same cache.
One Hillary supporter comments, "A
majority of attacks against Hillary
(by Stanford students) have been
derogatory slurs about her appear
ance or her personality." The double
standard that Hillary' is held to in the
national media — essentially behav
ing the way the men do, but being
treated differently for it — seems to
carry over to Stanford students' polit
ical attitudes. While it would be im
possible to dismiss a mixed-race stu
dent for supporting Obama, several
female Hillary supporters I inter
viewed have been dismissed by other
students with statements like "Well
of course you would be! You're a
WOMAN!"
What is remarkable about the
louder Obama supporters on campus
is the remarkable confidence of their
views. Part of this is due to the lack of
a critical mass of Hillary supporters
on campus. Obama is significantly
younger than Hillary Clinton; most
college students don't remember Bill
Clinton's presidency. And his rhetoric
of "We Are the Change We Have
Been Looking For" is appealing to
students confident about their ability
to change the world, and ones who

don't have to worry about health care
and gas prices. While certainly not
true for all Obama supporters, or
even most of them, his campaign has
engendered an extraordinary sense
of confidence and self-righteousness
in some. Many Hillary supporters
now feel left out of the campus poli
tics dialogue, which is uniformly pro-
Obama as a matter of course. Obama
supporters may eventually realize the
long-term harm of alienating Hillary
supporters on campus — it poisons
campus politics — but there's no in
dication of that so far.
