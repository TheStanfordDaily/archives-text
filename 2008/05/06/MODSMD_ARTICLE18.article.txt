## "That Kid" 
### 
Regrettably, That Kid receives the annoy
ing-student baton and sprints by all of
the foot-tapping, bubble-gum popping,
AIM-chatting, Internet-shopping competition.
He is the IHUM Kid's evil twin brother —
twice as outspoken and four times as obnox
ious, and he populates every one of your class
es,humanities and otherwise.That Kid isn't just
the student that sits in the front and consistent
ly raises his hand, arm stick-straight, fingers
wiggling like worms with ADD. That was
IHUM Kid, a mere oddly-shaped, benign mole
compared to That Kid's cancerous melanoma.
In large lecture halls. That Kid is the one
who asks questions that don't help clarify any
thing and instead pertain to material that the
professor has explicitly stated will not be on the
final. Her inquiries are generally far beyond
the scope of lecture, and she almost always
draws comparisons to other classes she has
taken or is taking concurrently. Sometimes she
even likes to describe real-life personal experi
ences which, luckily, relate to the subject of the
lecture. Just as she learned in her other devel
opmental psychology class, young twins (exact
ly like the ones she happens to baby-sit regular
ly) display the same cognitive deficiencies
which surprisingly resulted in me stapling her
mouth shut.
In small seminars. That Kid offers gems of
analysis five times more than anyone else, in

eluding the professor. His answers are invari
ably too long and always contain massive vo
cabulary words. I can't help but roll my eyes,
completely annoyed at his pitiable and see
through attempts to cultivate an iota of self
confidence by parading his barely above-aver
age lexicon. Although sometimes, I write down
the words I don't know and look them up at
home.
The most insufferable thing about That Kid,
that is besides her nasally voice, ail-too rich vo
cabulary, eager finger-wiggling and should-be
asked-in-office-hours questions, is her ambigu
ous motivations. That Kid speaks both to im
press the teacher and to satisfy her own bot
tomless personal quest for knowledge — she is
a maddeningly odd blend of proud self-con
gratulation and genuine academic interest. I
hate her for her unbelievably poor lecture eti
quette, yet I admire how unswervingly pre
pared for class she is, regardless of a heavy
reading load or complicated problem sets. This
scholastic respect only fuels my hatred, howev
er. since when pitted head-to-head against
Geeky Mcl-don't-understand-social-cues, I
know she will win the Better Student Award
every time.
Sometimes 1 imagine That Kid in ten, or
even five years, and I start to mentally drown in
a frothy bitter pit of despair. Because he raised
his hand so freely and was so joyously involved

in every discussion section, optional class, and
office hour, eighty-five tenured, emeritus Stan
ford professors not only knew That Kid, hut
had him babysitting their children and proof
reading their latest publications for petty
grammar mistakes and scholarly vocabulary
insertion. Their relationship, further bolstered
by their mutual passion for Proust and their pe
rusal of rare book fairs to discover and pur
chase other such gems of early 20th century
modernist literature, in turn leads to the most
staggeringly praiseful recommendation letter
that the world has ever known, where That Kid
is actually compared to Gandhi, Mother Tere
sa, Paul Farmer and Bono in a few letters of
note. These deep connections to the zenith of
America's intelligensia, lands That Kid not
only an internship that is more selective than
candidature for the Papacy, but also a six-digit
dream job "consulting" for an "environmental
ly conscious" company that donates millions
annually to AIDS research.offers complemen
tary meals and massages and urges employees
to sit on big green bouncy balls instead of office
roily-chairs to increase core strength and foster
a healthy, ergonomic work space. That Kid ac
tually then becomes your dad's boss, and you
have never felt more strongly than now that
Denis Quaid deserved an Oscar nod for his
poignant role in the film "In Good Company."
Perhaps a little embarrassment in front of a lec

ture hall of 300 people is worth it.
Then again, however, That Kid isn't perfect.
She shows up to a board meeting, so your fa
ther tells you, and while she bobs up and down
on her green bouncy ball, she interrupts, side
tracks the meeting and tells personal stories
which are only marginally related to the topic
at hand. Once, at another board meeting, she
heard a similar theme discussed and there they
all shared their personal goals which resulted
in. quite surprisingly, your father binder-clip
ping her lips together. Eyes roll, and pens begin
to tap — her group manners are as off-putting
as always.
Perhaps we should all take a few cues from
each other. I could raise my hand more. That
Kid could leave the library on a Friday night
(there's a reason Green closes so early). I could
visit office hours occasionally, That Kid could
work on fostering an interaction with the oppo
site sex outside of Beginning Social Dance.
After all, that is what diversity is about, learn
ing from those who are different from our
selves. And who knows, maybe That Kid and
IHUM Kid could start a beautiful life together.
