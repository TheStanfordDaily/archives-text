TRACK AND FIELD
5/4 Payton Jordan Cardinal
Invitational
GAME NOTES: The Stanford track and field squad hosted
the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational last weekend and
saw several athletes put up top notch performances. No
tably, Stanford scored extremely well in the women's dis
tance events, as Lauren Centrowitz and Alicia Follmar,
among others, stepped up with excellent times. Next up
for the Cardinal are the Pac-10 Championships in
Tempe, Ariz., beginning May 16.

The meet started in the early afternoon
and ran until midnight after the men's 10,000-
meter race concluded. Stanford junior
Oluvvadare Kolawole and freshman Spencer
Castro pounded on overturned garbage cans
to a steady beat in support of their teammates
for over three hours as the men and women
ran the long event.
The Cardinal women were led by senior
Lauren Centrowitz, who ran a personal best
in the 1,500 with a time of 4:16.13; she fin
ished seventh in the race but secured the sec
ond fastest time in the NCAA for 2008. Ju
nior Alicia Follmar, who recovered after her
fall last week during a race, had an impressive
run, finishing 12th in the event with a time of
4:21.25.
One of the most spectacular events of the
evening was the run by freshman Alexandra
Gits, who finished third in the 10,000-meter
run with a NCAA automatic qualifying time
of 33:19.42. While this achievement in itself
would be impressive enough. Gits made an
even greater impression on onlookers as she
ran the entire last half of the race with just
one shoe, after losing one at the 5.000-meter
mark. Spectators were awed by her determi
nation and steady pace despite her equip
ment difficulties, and the audience broke into
applause as she crossed the finish line.
Senior Lindsay Allen finished in ninth
place at the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a
season-best time of 10:08.84. Her time moves
her into first place in the Pac-10 list and third
in the NCAAs. Clearly, several of the runners
at this meet are prepared for competition be
yond the collegiate level. Another impressive
performance in the long-distance races was
put forth by senior Arianna Lambie, who ran

a personal best 15:22:51 in the 5.000-meter
run — the third best time by an American
this year.
There were also several successes in the
sprints and field events. Sophomore Griffin
Matthew earned a regional qualifying mark
in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.70
seconds after barely missing out last week
end. Matthew had a great start, taking an in
credible lead in the short race. Junior Idara

Otu finished first in the 400 with a collegiate
best time of 55.40 seconds: Otu doubled back
to finish third in the 200 meters with a time of
24.97 seconds.
The hurdlers were led by junior Myles
Bradley, who ran a personal best in the event
with a time of 13.78 seconds to finish second.
For the women, junior Deborah Akinniyi
also notched a personal best and regional
qualifying time of 13.79 seconds in the 100

meter hurdles.
"It was really amazing to finally break 14
seconds," Akinniyi said. "After being injured
and not being able to compete at all last year,
hitting the regional standard in the hurdles
seemed very far out of reach."

One of the most spectacular events of the
evening was the run by freshman Alexandra
Gits, who finished third in the 10,000-meter
run with a NCAA automatic qualifying time
of 33:19.42. While this achievement in itself
would be impressive enough. Gits made an
even greater impression on onlookers as she
ran the entire last half of the race with just
one shoe, after losing one at the 5.000-meter
mark. Spectators were awed by her determi
nation and steady pace despite her equip
ment difficulties, and the audience broke into
applause as she crossed the finish line.
Senior Lindsay Allen finished in ninth
place at the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a
season-best time of 10:08.84. Her time moves

yond the collegiate level. Another impressive

put forth by senior Arianna Lambie, who ran

a personal best 15:22:51 in the 5.000-meter
run — the third best time by an American
this year.
There were also several successes in the
sprints and field events. Sophomore Griffin
Matthew earned a regional qualifying mark
in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.70
seconds after barely missing out last week
end. Matthew had a great start, taking an in
credible lead in the short race. Junior Idara

Otu finished first in the 400 with a collegiate
best time of 55.40 seconds: Otu doubled back
to finish third in the 200 meters with a time of
24.97 seconds.
The hurdlers were led by junior Myles
Bradley, who ran a personal best in the event
with a time of 13.78 seconds to finish second.
For the women, junior Deborah Akinniyi
also notched a personal best and regional
qualifying time of 13.79 seconds in the 100

meter hurdles.
"It was really amazing to finally break 14
seconds," Akinniyi said. "After being injured
and not being able to compete at all last year,
hitting the regional standard in the hurdles
seemed very far out of reach."
