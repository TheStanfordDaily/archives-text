# Rushdie weighs modern literature
## Acclaimed author pushes for continued literary engagement 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sir Salman Rushdie, the renowned and controver
sial author of "Midnight's Children" and"The Satanic
Verses." addressed a packed Kresge Auditorium last
night in the second-to-last ASSU Speakers Bureau for
the academic year.
Rushdie addressed his experiences dealing with
religious groups and national governments that
opposed the content of his novels. Rushdie famously
received a "fatwa" — which has come to be interpret
ed as a religiously mandated death sentence — from
Ayatollah Khomeini in 1988 for "The Satanic Verses."
Both Indian and Pakistani governments have also
criticized unfavorable historical details included in his
other works.
"One of the things 1 learned was that memory can
be public, if the official memory clashes with the truth
of what you remember." Rushdie said. "Simply the act
of saying, 'I remember this happened' is a political
statement, when those in power say,'No, it didn't."'

"That kind of conflict of being at odds with the offi
cial truth is what happened to ''Ilie Satanic Verses,"' he
added. "It became a conflict about who can tell which
stories."
Rushdie emphasized that freedom of speech goes
beyond questions of political rights and addresses fun
damental human concerns.
"Human beings, of all the creatures on the earth,
are the only creatures who tell stories," Rushdie said.
"We are the species that has developed this curious
habit of telling our stories to learn what kind of crea
tures we are."
"The attempt to limit or deny or obstruct speech is
not just a literature question; it's an existential ques
tion," he added. "It denies the right to do something
natural to ourselves."
Rushdie also emphasized the need for continued
literary engagement in the modern era.
"Literature used to bring the news to people,"

Renowned and controversial author Sir Salman Rushdie addressed a packed Kresge Auditorium last night. Rushdie discussed
his dealings with those opposed to his works and weighed the effects of politics and technology on modern society.
Rushdie said. "People would read
about things they weren't aware of.
and. if they were, it would heighten
their awareness."
"When you confront the inade
quacy of what passes today for news,
you begin to feel literature has a
place." he added. "You feel like there
might be some more information left
to cover."
Rushdie further assessed the state
of modern society, labeling it "surreal
istic."
"The world seems to be going
through a particularly surrealistic
phase. Through the surface of ordi
nary life there emerge these outcrop
pings. I guess you could call them

bushes." he said to laughter from the
audience.
Rushdie said that transformations
in politics and technology have had
great effects upon the perspectives of
citizens.
" I he great difference between the
world in which we live and other
times is that the distance between
public and private life has shrunk,"
Rushdie said. "Public events impinge
on our private lives on a daily basis.
Actions occur in places we are not,
and decisions are made in rooms
whose existence we do not suspect."
In Rushdie's view, these transfor
mations have significant implications
for literature.
"What this does is create a prob
lem for literature," he said. "At the
heart of the novel has always been the
idea that our characters are our fates.
What I'm suggesting is that more and
more, perhaps more than ever before,

our lives are shaped by things outside
our control."
"There is a thing in the novel that
wants to he provincial and wants to he
small, to be intimate," he added. "It
wants to never lose sight of the
human scale, but novelists in our time
have been forced to do that."
Rushdie closed his lecture with his
conception of the place for literature
in a changing world.
"Great art tries to open the uni
verse a little more," Rushdie said.
"Great art increases, by some small
amount, what it's possible to know,do,
say and. therefore, to be. And we can't
do that sitting in the middle.
"At a time when politics invades so
much the boundaries of ordinary life,
going to the frontiers and pushing
back is the job," he added.
