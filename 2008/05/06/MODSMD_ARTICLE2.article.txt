# Rushdie weighs modern literature
## Acclaimed author pushes for continued literary engagement 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sir Salman Rushdie, the renowned and controver
sial author of "Midnight's Children" and"The Satanic
Verses." addressed a packed Kresge Auditorium last
night in the second-to-last ASSU Speakers Bureau for
the academic year.
Rushdie addressed his experiences dealing with
religious groups and national governments that
opposed the content of his novels. Rushdie famously
received a "fatwa" — which has come to be interpret
ed as a religiously mandated death sentence — from
Ayatollah Khomeini in 1988 for "The Satanic Verses."
Both Indian and Pakistani governments have also
criticized unfavorable historical details included in his
other works.
"One of the things 1 learned was that memory can
be public, if the official memory clashes with the truth
of what you remember." Rushdie said. "Simply the act
of saying, 'I remember this happened' is a political
statement, when those in power say,'No, it didn't."'

"That kind of conflict of being at odds with the offi
cial truth is what happened to ''Ilie Satanic Verses,"' he
added. "It became a conflict about who can tell which
stories."
Rushdie emphasized that freedom of speech goes
beyond questions of political rights and addresses fun
damental human concerns.
"Human beings, of all the creatures on the earth,
are the only creatures who tell stories," Rushdie said.
"We are the species that has developed this curious
habit of telling our stories to learn what kind of crea
tures we are."
"The attempt to limit or deny or obstruct speech is
not just a literature question; it's an existential ques
tion," he added. "It denies the right to do something
natural to ourselves."
Rushdie also emphasized the need for continued
literary engagement in the modern era.
"Literature used to bring the news to people,"
