Lacrosse left out of NCAA
Tournament
Despite winning its fourth straight
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) title on Saturday, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team was left out of
the NCAA Tournament after the tour
nament bracket was released yesterday.
The Cardinal defeated two of the
teams who are in the 16-team tourna
ment field â€” No. 2 seeded Penn and
unseeded Notre Dame.The team held a
12-8 record on the season after finish
ing on a roll at the MPSF tournament,
but a stretch of six losses in eight games
in the middle of the season was ulti
mately their undoing when it came to
the NCAA selection committee.
The announcement did not come as
a shock to the Cardinal women, who,
despite winning their conference tour
nament, knew that it was going to be
tough to sway the committee. Yester
day's news officially marks the end of
the careers of a senior group of impor
tant contributors throughout their four
years on the Farm: Daphne Patterson,
Amanda Soto, Laura Shane, Bri Ned,
Alicia Soto and Katharine Fox all
played in their last games in Stanford's
victory over Denver in the MPSF cham
pionships.
