## LA's Bryant likely to be awarded his first MVP honors 
### JOHN NADEL AP SPORTS WRITER 
LOS ANGELES - The NBA has scheduled a
news conference for Tuesday at a Los Angeles hotel,
where Kobe Bryant is expected to be announced as
winner of his first Most Valuable Player award.
Neither NBA spokesman Mark Broussard nor
the Lakers would discuss the subject of the news
conference, although the league did refer to it as an
NBA Awards Announcement.
The Los Angeles Times reported last Friday that
the 29-year-old Bryant had won the award. League
spokesman Brian Mclntvre refused to confirm or
deny the report on Saturday.
"I didn't know if it was going to come in my ca
reer, but to have the moment come now is special,
especially to share it with the group of guys we have
here," Bryant told reporters Saturday. "We talked
about (how) winning this MVP is extremely special
because that means I'm doing good. I'm making my
teammates better, putting them in a position to
win."
Bryant, who entered the season as the league's
two-time defending scoring champion, had finished
as high as third in the MVP voting twice - after the
2002-03 campaign, when he averaged 30 points for
the first time, and again last year, when Dallas' Dirk
Nowitzki won the award and two-time MVP Steve
Nash finished second.
Bryant averaged 28.3 points, 6.3 rebounds,s.4 as
sists and 1.84 steals while playing in all 82 games de
spite tearing a ligament in his right pinkie finger in
February. A hand specialist recommended surgery,
but Bryant decided to put it off until after the
Olympics this summer.
