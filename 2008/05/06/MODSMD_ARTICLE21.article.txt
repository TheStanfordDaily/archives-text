## LA's Bryant likely to be awarded his first MVP honors 
### JOHN NADEL AP SPORTS WRITER 
LOS ANGELES - The NBA has scheduled a
news conference for Tuesday at a Los Angeles hotel,
where Kobe Bryant is expected to be announced as
winner of his first Most Valuable Player award.
Neither NBA spokesman Mark Broussard nor
the Lakers would discuss the subject of the news
conference, although the league did refer to it as an
NBA Awards Announcement.
The Los Angeles Times reported last Friday that
the 29-year-old Bryant had won the award. League
spokesman Brian Mclntvre refused to confirm or
deny the report on Saturday.
"I didn't know if it was going to come in my ca
reer, but to have the moment come now is special,
especially to share it with the group of guys we have
here," Bryant told reporters Saturday. "We talked
about (how) winning this MVP is extremely special
because that means I'm doing good. I'm making my
teammates better, putting them in a position to
win."
Bryant, who entered the season as the league's
two-time defending scoring champion, had finished
as high as third in the MVP voting twice - after the
2002-03 campaign, when he averaged 30 points for
the first time, and again last year, when Dallas' Dirk
Nowitzki won the award and two-time MVP Steve
Nash finished second.
Bryant averaged 28.3 points, 6.3 rebounds,s.4 as
sists and 1.84 steals while playing in all 82 games de
spite tearing a ligament in his right pinkie finger in
February. A hand specialist recommended surgery,
but Bryant decided to put it off until after the
Olympics this summer.
Bryant is expected to receive the
MVP trophy Wednesday night from
commissioner David Stern before the
Lakers face the Utah Jazz in Game 2
of their best-of-seven second-round
playoff series. The Lakers won the
opener 109-98 on Sunday.
Bryant, second in the NBA in
scoring behind Cleveland's Leßron
James, would be the first member of

the Lakers to win the MVP award
since Shaquille O'Neal was a near
unanimous choice in 2000. Other pre
vious Lakers to win the award dating
back to 1956 when it was first present
ed were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
Magic Johnson, who won it three
times each. Abdul-Jabbar also won
three with the Milwaukee Bucks.
Bryant and O'Neal led the Lakers
to three consecutive NBA champi
onships. from 2000-02, and a berth in
the NBA finals in 2004. The Lakers
hadn't won a playoff series since then
until sweeping the Denver Nuggets in
the first round last month.
