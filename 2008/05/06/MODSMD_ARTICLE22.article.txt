## Debating Kobe v. CP for MVP 
### 
Kobe Bryant will win his first
MVP award this week.
But does he deserve it?
Certainly, Bryant added yet an
other great season to his brilliant ca
reer. Amidst changing personnel and
an über-competitive Western Confer
ence, he led Los Angeles to a No. 1
playoff seed and has them in good po
sition to grab their first championship
since 2002. On many nights, he was
the most dominant player on the
court and in all of basketball — his
consistency was nearly unparalleled.
All this is well and good, but was
he the best or most valuable player in
the league this year? That is a point of
contention.
There were four main candidates
for MVP: Bryant. New Orleans'
Chris Paul. Boston's Kevin Garnett
and Cleveland's Leßron James.
When Garnett was traded to
Boston last year, he instantly helped
turn the Celtics into an Eastern Con
ference powerhouse. But, unlike his
previous seasons in Minnesota, he
wasn't the only force on the team:
Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, two stars
in their own right, helped form a
dominant Boston troika that was on
par with any other trio in the league.
While he is. perhaps, the premier in
side player in the NBA, Garnett's
value was as a part of this group, not
as an individual.
The story of King James is the op
posite. 1 le carried his team more than
any other candidate did. The Cava
liers had only one other consistent
contributor: Zydrunas llgauskas.
Otherwise, it was James and James
alone who propelled Cleveland into
the playoffs. But the East was terribly
weak this year, and the Cavaliers
were mightily unimpressive — they
wouldn't have sniffed the playoffs if
they had been in the West. It is gener
ally taboo to award the MVP to play
ers on mediocre teams,and,even with
James's laudable individual work,the
Cavs were just that.
That brings us to Paul, Bryant's
presumptive runner-up. Simply put.
Paul turned in one of the best seasons
ever by a guard. He led the league in
assists and steals while also adding
over 21 points of scoring per game.
His Player Efficiency Rating — a
complex but accurate statistic devel
oped to show a player's per minute
performance — was the best in
league history for anyone not named
Michael Jordan.
He overtook two-time MVP Steve
Nash as the league's best point guard,
a distinction he won't likely relin
quish for the next decade. And, de
spite a plethora of commentators say
ing that the Hornets couldn't with
stand an intense stretch run, he kept
New Orleans in top position in the
West into April, with one otherworld
ly performance after another. The
Hornets ultimately took the No. 2
seed in the West, right behind the
Lakers.
As the season progressed, Garnett
and James took a back seat to the two
frontrunners. Frankly, all four candi
dates are worthy, and no choice could
be categorized as wrong — especial
ly in the case of Bryant v. Paul.
If I had a vote (note to editors: get
on that) it'd go to Paul. As an effec
tive floor general, Paul made all of his
teammates better. David West is a
very good forward, but, without Paul,
he wouldn't have approached the
nearly 21 points and 9 rebounds a
game he averaged. The same goes for
Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojakovic and
the rest of the Hornets.
ITie knock on Paul is that his sur
rounding talent was better than
Bryant's, and thus his individual
value is diminished, but that's mis
leading: Bryant had a constant low
post presence from Andrew Bynum
and then Pau Gasol. Bynum was de
veloping into a star beneath the bas
ket before his mid-January season
ending injury; Gasol, already a pre
mier big man who came over from
Memphis in a trade in early February,
replaced him. Kobe was the super
star, but. for the first time since Shaq
left, he had another star to comple
ment him. Los Angeles also had
Lamar Odom and Derek Fisher, both
fine contributors, as well as a slew of
role players who did their part to help
L.A.'s cause.
ITic most flawed reasoning I've
seen is that Kobe was simply "owed"
an MVP.There were times in the past
(namely, the 2005-2006 season) when
many believed that he was robbed of
the award. As a result, the voters de
cided to make it up to him.
On top of that, many believe that
Paul has yet to "pay his dues" in the
league — in other words, the elec
torate does not generally award the
MVP to young players. The first idea
isn't exactly unprecedented: Karl
Malone won the MVP award in 1996-
1997 over a more-qualified Jordan
because, many believed, he was
"due." But historical examples can't

make this argument any less legiti
mate. Give the MVP to the player
who deserves it based on his play that
year, not because of his cumulative
work and past events. To do other
wise is to insult both candidates and
the award itself.
The race was so close that you
could flip a coin to award the MVP this
year. Paul is my choice, but 1 respect
and understand the decision of those
who went with Bryant. I just hope they
chose him for the right reasons.
