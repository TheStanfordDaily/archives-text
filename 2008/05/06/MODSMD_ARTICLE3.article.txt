# GRADUATE LIFE
## Number of doctoral women on the rise 
### MANEESHA LIMAYE STAFF WRITER 
For the first time in Stanford's history, a
female Ph.D. student was questioned by an
all-female examination committee in the
School of Engineering last Wednesday in
Wallenberg Hall.
Three out of 54 faculty are women in the
Computer Science Department; four out of
67 in the Electrical Engineering Department;

and seven out of 33 women in the
Management Science and Engineering
Department.

Prof. Margot Gerritsen, one of the five exam
ination committee members, was the research
advisor for student Shalini Krishnamurthy, a
graduate student in the Institute for
Computational and Mathematical
Engineering.
"Of the past 1.000 Ph.D.s in the last four

years, so few have been women, let alone
been questioned by all women," Gerritsen
said. "It just shows you that we are finally get
ting to a state where we can get enough
females to do this."
Gerritsen said, however, that the all
female committee was not planned.
"It wasn't by design that the entire com
mittee ended up being comprised of all
females," she said. "All of the people we want
ed who specialized in Shalini's line of work

just turned out to be women."
Krishnamurthy's work focused on compu
tational methods for gas injection processes
for enhanced oil recovery in petroleum engi
neering as well as CO2 sequestration.
"The examination was fantastic,"
Gerritsen said. "Shalini is a very good stu
dent. so it was wonderful."
Krishnamurthv said she was excited for
the opportunity to defend her work in such
an unprecedented event.
"Having all these who people who
achieved so much on the committee is inspir
ing," she said. "I really felt more thrilled
defending that day in front of all those
women because 1 realized such a thing had

never happened before."
Gerritsen added that the event was a
milestone for female scholarship in science.
"A lot of women who work here only see
men around them," she said. "So it is empow
ering to see women accomplishing some
thing like this. For Shalini, I think there was
a sense of pride being a woman herself, and
having also reached a Ph.D. level in a male
dominated environment that made it even
more special."
Krishnamurthy agreed and said that she
was proud of her achievements thus far.

"1 come from India, and this is the first
generation where women have made such a
leap in the professional stream,"
Kirshnamurthy said.'i am the first Ph D stu
dent in my family, and I feel great that I have
come so far."
Gerritsen said that the School of
Engineering is actively trying to diversify its
students and faculty.
"There is a strong push by the School of
Engineering and School of Sciences to
actively search for minority applicants,
including women." she said. "And 1 think this

effort is paying off."
Gerritsen added that she was optimistic
that engineering disciplines would continue to
build their appeal to female scholars but said
that more advances still needed to be made.
"I think there is an incredible awareness
that it is very hard for women to reach these
positions," she said. "It really is a milestone
event that should be recognized, and also a
stark reminder of how far we still have to go."
