## Studies eye SAT writing 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
According to the preliminary
results of two new studies, the newly
added writing portion of the SAT is
actually a better predictor of grades
for freshman college students than the
older critical reading and mathematics
portions. Hut Andrea Lunsford,
English professor and director of
Stanford's Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR), maintains that it is
notoriously difficult to measure writ
ing. especially on a one-shot writing
test.
The College Board, which adminis
ters the standardized test that many
students entering a four-year universi
ty are required to take, studied test
scores from 150.1KX) freshmen entering
110 colleges in 2006 and then looked at
their grade point averages (GPAs) at
the end of their freshman year, accord
ing to Wayne Camara, vice president
of research for the College Board.
"Our study suggests that the writ
ing test is the best single predictor," he
said of freshman grades in a public
statement. But he added that the study
will not be finalized until the summer.
The University of California
arrived at similar conclusions from an
analysis of its incoming 20(H) freshmen
and their GPAs. said Sam Agronow,
coordinator of admission research and
