## Studies eye SAT writing 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
According to the preliminary
results of two new studies, the newly
added writing portion of the SAT is
actually a better predictor of grades
for freshman college students than the
older critical reading and mathematics
portions. Hut Andrea Lunsford,
English professor and director of
Stanford's Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR), maintains that it is
notoriously difficult to measure writ
ing. especially on a one-shot writing
test.
The College Board, which adminis
ters the standardized test that many
students entering a four-year universi
ty are required to take, studied test
scores from 150.1KX) freshmen entering
110 colleges in 2006 and then looked at
their grade point averages (GPAs) at
the end of their freshman year, accord
ing to Wayne Camara, vice president
of research for the College Board.
"Our study suggests that the writ
ing test is the best single predictor," he
said of freshman grades in a public
statement. But he added that the study
will not be finalized until the summer.
The University of California
arrived at similar conclusions from an
analysis of its incoming 20(H) freshmen
and their GPAs. said Sam Agronow,
coordinator of admission research and
evaluation at the university's office of
the president in a public statement.
According to the University of
California's system-wide senate
review proposal to reform the UC"s
freshman eligibility policy, "The
Writing test has the greatest predictive
validity in relation to UC freshman
GPA."
Stanford, however, has not con
ducted research on the relationship
between SAT writing grades and
PWR grades or overall GPA.
"I do believe the University plans
to make some of those comparisons as
part of the institutional accreditation
review that Stanford is currently car
rying out," Lunsford said. "But we do
not at this time have such compar
isons."
The Faculty Senate decided in 2(X)1
that Stanford would not accept AP
credit for writing at Stanford â€” a pol
icy similar to those at many other top
schools, including I larvard.
"That is not to say that AP courses
are not important or helpful but,
rather, that first-year college writing
should be a different thing, should go
well beyond high-school level writ
ing," she said. " Ihus, every student
who enters Stanford naturally has
room for development in terms of
writing, and in PWR 1 and 2 we can

track this development taking place."
Lunsford argued that writing abili
ty develops slowly and recursively
over many years and is difficult to
measure in a single test.
"I much prefer a portfolio system
for evaluation of student writing, as it
allows for a series of detailed photo
graphs rather than a simple snapshot
of that writing," she said.
Such a series of writing samples
was obtained by Stanford in a recent
study. In September 2(X)1. Lunsford
and Vice Provost John Bravman "79
invited a random sample of entering
freshmen to participate in the
Stanford Study of Writing (SSW).The
five-year study, which contained over
15.(XX) pieces of writing, investigated
the writing practices and development
of Stanford students during their
undergraduate years and their first
year beyond college in professional
environments or graduate programs.
Preliminary results from the study
indicated that students entered
Stanford with a fairly wide range of
writing abilities and that writing abili
ty improved progressively over time.
Lunsford described a study that
used data from the SSW in which
about 300 pieces of writing by stu
dents from across the five years were
used in a "blind" reading.
"Not surprisingly, student writing
improved on every aspect of the
rubric," Lunsford said.
