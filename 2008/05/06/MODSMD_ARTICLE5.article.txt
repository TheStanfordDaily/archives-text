with USF tomorrow in San Francisco.

that spurred him to a 5-0 record
before he dropped his last two
starts, failing to get past the third
inning in either of them.
Pacific (9-35). on the other
hand, was just trying to get a win
any way it could. The Tigers took

the first game between these two
teams at Klein Field at Sunken
Diamond 10-6 in late March but
had won just three more in the
interim. Indeed, the Tigers came
into last night's game with just one
win in their last 13 games and sent
Larry Holscher — who picked up

the win against Stanford back in
March — to try to snap them out of
the skid.
In the end, it was Inman who
came through.The Cardinal sopho

Junior center fielder Sean Ratliff launched a three-run home run in the fifth inning to help propel the Cardinal
to its victory over Pacific last night. Ratliff leads Stanford with 14 blasts on the year and is second with 45 RBI.
with an excellently located fastball
that made Inman's few breaking
pitches all the more effective. He
went five innings to pick up the 7-2
win while allowing just two runs and
striking out five, improving his record
to 6-2 on the year.
I"he Tigers held on for the first half
of the game, though, and even
jumped out to an early 1-0 lead. With
two outs in the second inning. Inman
issued a walk to Tigers catcher Kurt
Wideman, bringing first baseman
Noah St. Urbain to the plate. St. Ur
bain jumped all over a fastball and
drove it into deep right-center field
for an RBI double.
The Cardinal answered quickly,
though, and took the lead for good
with a three-run third inning. Junior
Brent Milleville delivered a bases
loaded single into left field to drive in
freshman infielder Jake Schlander
and junior outfielder Joey August,
giving Stanford a 2-0 lead. Milleville
took second, and junior Jason Castro,
who was on first when Milleville hit
the single, took third on a fielding
error by Tiger left fielder Brett Man
ning. ITie misplay proved costly as
Castro came home moments later on
a Randy Molina groundout to make
it 3-1 Stanford.
Wideman came around to score
again in the fifth, making it 3-2, but in
the bottom half of that inning Stan
ford stepped on the gas and put the
game away.
With David Rowse in relief of
Holsher. Milleville reached with a

one-out single followed by a walk to
Molina to put runners on first and
second with one out for junior Sean
Ratliffc Ratliff —who hit two home
runs Sunday against San Jose State,
including a game-tying grand slam in
the eighth — crushed an inside fast
hall well over the wall in right center
for his 14th homerun of the year to
make it 6-2. For Ratliff, it was the first
time in his career he has hit more
than two homeruns in any two-game
span.
"I got a hold of that one pretty
good," Ratliff said.'i was thinking he
was going to work me inside with a
fastball after coming with a few
changeups outside. I saw it pretty
well out of his hand and was able to
get my hands inside it and get it up in
the air, and. fortunately for me. it
went out."
Stanford put one more run on the
board in that frame and ran the rest
of the way with the 7-2 lead. Fresh
man Danny Sandbrink came on in re
lief of Inman to start the sixth and
threw two shutout innings while
striking out three before yielding to
fellow freshman Drew Storen.
Storen shut down the Tigers, turning
in shutout frames in the eighth and
ninth. He allowed just one hit.
With the win, Stanford took the
season series from Pacific three
games to one, running its all-time
record against the Tigers to 51-8-1.
The Cardjnal returns to action to
morrow afternoon with a 3 p.m. game
at the University of San Francisco be

GAME NOTES: After downing Pacific 7-2 on
Monday night, the Cardinal will bring a
three-game winning streak into its game
with USF tomorrow in San Francisco.

his 14*h home run of the season while

hill to try to rediscover the stuff
that spurred him to a 5-0 record
before he dropped his last two
starts, failing to get past the third
inning in either of them.
Pacific (9-35). on the other
hand, was just trying to get a win
any way it could. The Tigers took

the first game between these two
teams at Klein Field at Sunken
Diamond 10-6 in late March but
had won just three more in the
interim. Indeed, the Tigers came
into last night's game with just one
win in their last 13 games and sent
Larry Holscher — who picked up

the win against Stanford back in
March — to try to snap them out of
the skid.
In the end, it was Inman who
came through.The Cardinal sopho
more dominated the Tigers' lineup

Junior center fielder Sean Ratliff launched a three-run home run in the fifth inning to help propel the Cardinal
to its victory over Pacific last night. Ratliff leads Stanford with 14 blasts on the year and is second with 45 RBI.
with an excellently located fastball
that made Inman's few breaking
pitches all the more effective. He
went five innings to pick up the 7-2
win while allowing just two runs and
striking out five, improving his record
to 6-2 on the year.
I"he Tigers held on for the first half
of the game, though, and even
jumped out to an early 1-0 lead. With
two outs in the second inning. Inman
issued a walk to Tigers catcher Kurt
Wideman, bringing first baseman
Noah St. Urbain to the plate. St. Ur
bain jumped all over a fastball and
drove it into deep right-center field
for an RBI double.
The Cardinal answered quickly,
though, and took the lead for good
with a three-run third inning. Junior
Brent Milleville delivered a bases
loaded single into left field to drive in
freshman infielder Jake Schlander
and junior outfielder Joey August,
giving Stanford a 2-0 lead. Milleville
took second, and junior Jason Castro,
who was on first when Milleville hit
the single, took third on a fielding
error by Tiger left fielder Brett Man
ning. ITie misplay proved costly as
Castro came home moments later on
a Randy Molina groundout to make
it 3-1 Stanford.
Wideman came around to score
again in the fifth, making it 3-2, but in
the bottom half of that inning Stan
ford stepped on the gas and put the
game away.
With David Rowse in relief of
Holsher. Milleville reached with a

one-out single followed by a walk to
Molina to put runners on first and
second with one out for junior Sean
Ratliffc Ratliff —who hit two home
runs Sunday against San Jose State,
including a game-tying grand slam in
the eighth — crushed an inside fast
hall well over the wall in right center
for his 14th homerun of the year to
make it 6-2. For Ratliff, it was the first
time in his career he has hit more
than two homeruns in any two-game
span.
"I got a hold of that one pretty
good," Ratliff said.'i was thinking he
was going to work me inside with a
fastball after coming with a few
changeups outside. I saw it pretty
well out of his hand and was able to
get my hands inside it and get it up in
the air, and. fortunately for me. it
went out."
Stanford put one more run on the
board in that frame and ran the rest
of the way with the 7-2 lead. Fresh
man Danny Sandbrink came on in re
lief of Inman to start the sixth and
threw two shutout innings while
striking out three before yielding to
fellow freshman Drew Storen.
Storen shut down the Tigers, turning
in shutout frames in the eighth and
ninth. He allowed just one hit.
With the win, Stanford took the
season series from Pacific three
games to one, running its all-time
record against the Tigers to 51-8-1.
The Cardjnal returns to action to
morrow afternoon with a 3 p.m. game
at the University of San Francisco be
fore wrapping up its home schedule
with four games this weekend at
Sunken Diamond, including a three
game Pac-10 series against rival Cal.
"All the Pac-10 series are huge, es
