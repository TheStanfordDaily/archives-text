has been "a fixture" ever since,
according to jazz studies coordina
tor Jim Nadel.
Stein, who had worked for the
Department of Music since 1985.
taught saxophone lessons and per
formed until his death.
"He continued to play and be
active until the end of his life,"
Nadel said. "You could often see
him in San Francisco, playing in
nightclubs that you would associate
with the younger jazz musicians."
Nadel worked alongside Stein
for several years.
"He played very strong in the
jazz tradition," Nadel said. "He
emulated Lester Young and
Charlie Parker, and he sounded
like them."
Fred Berry, a lecturer in jazz and
the director of the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra, also worked closely
with Stein and played in a band
with him.
"He kind of had a reputation
among players because he was one
of those rare musicians who played
with Charlie Parker." Berry said.
"He and Stan Getz were friends."
It was Stan Getz. who taught at
Stanford as an artist in residence in
1985, who brought Stein into the
program as a lecturer.
"(Stein) was very accommodat
ing," Berry said. "He was a men
toring type. A lot of the students
all thought very highly of him."
Stein stopped teaching after fall
quarter, taking a medical leave of
absence. L.izz Fay *11 was one of
Stein's students before he left.
"He was very weathered." she
said. "He knew what he wanted,
and he was really funny."
Nick Murray '11 also took saxo
phone lessons from Stein during
fall quarter.
"He was definitely a great jazz
musician," he said. "He was old
school. He played at 16 with
Charlie Parker."
Nadel praised both Stein's
character and musicianship.
"He was very witty, and that
came across in any personal con
tact you had with him," Nadel said.
"He had a very warm sound and a
great flow of ideas, which is impor
tant in playing jazz."
Charlie McCarthy, woodwind
professor at the City College of
San Francisco and saxophone
instructor at Sonoma State
University, has taken over Stein's
classes.
