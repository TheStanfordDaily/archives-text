## EVERYBODY KNOWS ONE: IHUM KIDS 
### GABRIEL JIMENEZ MEDINA 
For about four hours two times a week,
most Stanford freshmen enter a new
dimension. A dimension of sight, of
sound and of mind.They move into a
land of both shadow and substance,
things and ideas — I HUM!
The meeting time of Introduction to the
i iumanities (IHUM) classes is anywhere from
Monday mornings (The Fate of Reason) to
Thursday afternoons (World History of Sci
ence). Ihe place is Annenberg Auditorium
(Life of Contemplation or Action?) or per
haps the Geology Corner (Inventing Classics).
Meet the cast of characters, some 12-15 stu
dents per section, who ultimately comprise
most of the freshman class at Stanford. Many
share a common urgency — they're trying to
get IHUM over with.
For those students, IHUM is simply anoth
er GER on a laundry list of classes that stu
dents have to take to earn their diplomas from

Stanford. They see IHUM as just some nui
sance that one has to get through, but for that
riira avis that not only goes to IHUM,but actu
ally loves it.it is an opportunity to embark on
an "egomaniacal dream ride."
So says Harley Adams i 1. He's what some
might call an " IH U M Kid." Some students con
sider the IHUM Kid to be that slightly eccen
tric, oddly brilliant, wily-tongued devil that

seems to exude confidence and bravura at the
discussion sections many loathe to even attend.
The insights of the IHUM Kid are pro
found, witty, often comic and sometimes over
your head, but not so high that you don't rec
ognize that you've just heard something
deeply meaningful. IHUM Kids have a ten
dency to monopolize conversation, which can
drive their fellow students crazy or cause them
to merely shrug their shoulders and feel grate
ful for having to do less work.
Tommy Tobin '10. FroSoCo sophomore
president, was willing to recollect on the record
about being labeled as an 1 HUM Kid.
Tobin recalled the halcyon days of his
youth — winter quarter 2007.
"A student in my class called me an IHUM
Kid," he said. "I did talk a lot, spouting off in
formation, [but] I talked within the class not to
hear myself speak, but to keep myself awake."
Not exactly the ringing endorsement for
IHUM that one might expect from a true
IHUM Kid.
Others regard the IHUM Kid moniker in a

much more positive light.
"My friends tell me that I have I HUM Kid
tendencies, but I should probably leave it at
that "admitted Cynthia 1 le' 10, currently a res
ident writing tutor. She enjoyed IHUM be
cause she was able to "hear some really erudite
perspectives. As a bio major, 1 don't get many
opportunities to read great works in a struc

tured setting."
But how does the present batch of IHUM
Kids feel about the situation?
Discussing his own section, Adams, cur
rently in Richard Martin's Inventing Gassics
IHUM and an Art of Living veteran, waxes
eloquent about the positive effects of IHUM
on his social life.
"Steve Ziegler [*11] was in [Art of Living],
so we started being friends because of it,"he
said. "We'd go to dinner after section and con
tinue arguing about Nietzsche — I love saying
Nietzsche now."
Among authors studied in IHUM, Plato is
also a favorite of Adams.
"Here's this guy thousands of years ago
who says you can be immortal by creating
beautiful ideas... using others and sharing in
these ideas through thought and art." he said."l
think I wrote an essay on' Symposium' being an
orgy of the mind. That really blows my mind."
Adams described his perception of what it
means to be an IHUM Kid.
"I think people have a conception that the
IHUM Kid does all the reading, does all the
work, comes to the lecture all the time and
knows everything and wants to suck up about
it and wants to get a good grade because this is
another class," he said."l think the IHUM Kid
is like any other student who skips lectures and
reads half the reading and is tired in section but
is really passionate about the material and sees
this as a great opportunity to discuss it and to
talk about some really great stuff."
"That's the IHUM Kid for me," he added.
"I guess that's what I hope."
