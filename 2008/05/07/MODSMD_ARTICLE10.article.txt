Clear a path to a safer world
Long after wars are over landmines remain scattered in close
to 80 countries around the world. This makes land unusable
for farming, schools or living, and prevents people from re
building lives torn apart by conflict. These indiscriminate
weapons maim or kill 15,000 to 20,000 civilians every year.
They cost as little as $3 to produce, but as much as $ 1000 to
remove. Come for a discussion, as well the showing of a
short documentary film, on the crisis that landmines cause
and what can, and is, being done about it.
