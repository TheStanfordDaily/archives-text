Another branch of Caffe del
Doge is set to open in the Palo Alto
Caltrain station, according to the
Palo Alto Daily News. Though nego
tiations to secure the coffee shop's
space have been tricky, the
University, which leases the station
to the City of Palo Alto, has come to
an agreement with Santa Clara
Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) and Venice-based Caffe del
Doge.
While coffee vendors in the sta
tion have been unsuccessful in the
past, the VTA believes Caffe del

Doge will benefit from a six-month
rent-free window. After six months,
the cafe will pay the VTA $1,500 per
month.
According to Claudia Cornejo,
CEO of the American Branch of

for business in late August or early
September.
