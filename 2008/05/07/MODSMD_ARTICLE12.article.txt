## Editorial Board Green hours extension shows process working 
### 
Last month,administrators approved a
request to extend Green Library's
hours until 2 a.m. on Sunday through
Thursday nights.This came as a welcome an
nouncement to many students, though same
may be wondering when, if ever, these
changes will really take place. Although the
later hours will not be implemented until the
fall, the move to keep Cireen open later
should be held up as a successful example of
the ASSU and Stanford administration col
laborating to fulfill students' wishes.
Many candidates for the ASSU Senate
promoted the idea of later library hours.
Within a week of the election, students re
ceived a brief email survey asking their opin
ion on the current library situation, their late
night study habits and whether they would
appreciate Green remaining open later dur
ing the week.
Having established that there was sup
port for the idea, the ASSU then worked
with the administration to implement a plan
in accordance with student wishes.The Uni
versity agreed to cover the additional cost
through the General Fund, meaning that the
library did not have to cut funding in any
other areas. The library staff then began
doing what was necessary to implement the
later hours.This exemplifies what we should
hope for: the ASSU solicited student input,
advocated on their behalf and worked with
the relevant individuals and organizations to
accomplish their goal.
According to Director of Library Com
munications Andrew Herkovic, there are a
number of steps necessary to change the li

brary's schedule. Foremost among them is
the need to hire new, permanent and full
time staff members — and it is difficult to
find people willing to work until 3:30 a.m.
and potentially never meet their supervi
sors. These staff members must be trained on
the library's surprisingly complicated clos
ing procedures, and they must also be able to
deal with issues any number of in the library,
given that there are few staff members
working at that time of night.
There are additional systemic issues that
must be addressed, such as reconfiguring
automatic lighting, alarm and large-scale
backup systems. None of these matters are
insurmountable, and all are being ad
dressed.
Instead of fixating on the fact that the li
brary will not be staying open later until next
year, we should appreciate an instance in
which the system worked. Herkovic noted
that he thought the student body did its job
well in expressing its desire for a change,
which made it easy for the Stanford library
system to respond.
'ITie ASSU should consider this a feather
in its cap. The early closing time is certainly a
nuisance for some, and these are the kinds of
matters that our advocates to the adminis
tration should be aware of and voice. The ad
ministration and library staff should also be
commended for responding promptly to im
prove a perceived campus problem.This was
an admirable effort on all sides and should
be appreciated, even if it will be a few
months before librarv-goers can burn the
midnight oil a few hours later.
