# Co-Terminal Illness
## Attention: Stanford cheapskates! 
### 
Stanford students are world-class
mooches and hagglers. Trapped within
our little oasis where everything is ei
ther free or pre-paid, many of us have no
idea how to manage money in the simplest
of situations.
Maybe it's because we don't have to deal
with cash on a regular basis, because we use
our Stanford cards to pay for every thing and
many of us don't venture into the city that
often. But even still, we seem paranoid
about getting nickel and dimed by our
friends.
I've hung out with students from many
different colleges, but I've found that only
Stanford students are capable of staging a
twenty-minute stand-off at T.G.I. Friday's
while waiting for someone to fess up for or
dering that second Wild Berry Mojito.
1 've seen many other ridiculous examples
of cheapness while at Stanford. One of my
friends got us kicked out of a bar in San
Francisco after sneaking in a can of Bud
weiser he'd brought from home. One of my
roommates in Mirrielees ate the same low
cost meal every night â€” Kraft Mac-n-
Cheese with bits of Costco Roast Beef sprin
kled on top. And I once caught a slick Eco
nomics major stealing food from a dorm
fridge, only to have him tell me it wasn't his
problem. Rather, "the tragedy of the com
mons" was to blame.
Just as bad as the cheapskates are the
people who don't realize that everyone
else's parents aren't necessarily as. ahem,
generous as theirs.They want to order bottle
service at the club and think you're lame for
just wanting to dance.They order the lobster
at dinner and then insist on splitting the bill
equally. Never mind that they're using dad's
credit card to pay their share.
Along with food and alcohol, the biggest
way that students mooch off of each other is
gas. Now that gas is getting close to five dol
lars a gallon, giving a ride to your car-less
friends involves more than just an invest
ment in time. Before this year, it was com
mon courtesy to throw your friends five dol
lars for a ride to the airport, but now it costs
about that much to go to and from the local
Safeway.
Nothing sucks more than arguing with
friends over money. Having had my share of
these squabbles, I figure I'd offer a few ideas
on how to avoid them:
1) Never try to make a profit on your
friends. If you buy ten bucks of beer, don't
ask for $20 to compensate for your time.The
exception to this rule is when buying booze

for freshmen and others under the legal age,
in which case the underage beer tax goes
into effect, and all bets are off.
2) Sometimes it's not good enough to just
pay people back for things. If you never go
grocery shopping but are always happy to
give your grocery-shopping friends a list of
things you need, don't think it's okay to just
reimburse the cash value of your stuff. You
have to reciprocate.
3) Once you've offered to pay someone
back in cash, you can't get out of it.The worst
thing you can do is to dredge up some long
forgotten debt and say, "Now we're even."
As my roommate once put it, this will make
the other person feel "like a deadbeat dad
having his wages garnished."
4) Every once in a while, splurge on some
expensive gesture of goodwill. For example,
after Stanford won Big Game, one of my
friends bought a flat of mid-level cham
pagne for the celebration. Just make sure it's
showy enough to get noticed.
5) If you go out to dinner with friends, act
like a real customer. I've seen people who
order nothing but an appetizer, no drink and
no main dish, and then gorge themselves on
the free bread, expecting that their friends
will compensate for their tactlessness. And it
really sucks for the waiter or waitress when
everyone at the table says:"l '11 just stick with
water, thanks."
6) If your parents pay for something,
don't charge your friends full value for use of
it. If mom and pop cover your gas, don't in
sist on recouping every last cent of your driv
ing expenses.
7) Don't wage subtle class warfare on
your wealthier friends. Just because they're
rich or get a big allowance doesn't mean
they should pay a bigger share for every
thing.
8) Finally, don't use elementary econom
ic principles to justify highway robbery.
"Tragedy of the Commons," my ass.

To the person who stole an entire birthday
cake from a fridge in the Stanford House in
Oxford: feel free to come clean at hselhQPstan
