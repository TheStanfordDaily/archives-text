# You're Not Special
## The
						king of America 
### 
Americans are starved for royalty, and
it shows in the treatment of our pres
idential candidates. Sure, we want
someone who can run the country well and
solve the myriad crises that face this nation.
But we also want someone who looks good,
makes pretty speeches, provides us with en
tertainment and projects an image of Ameri
can might to the rest of the world. Our prob
lem is that we try to compress all these things
into one person.
If you want evidence of the royal nature of
our president, look at the way he is treated as
compared to the prime minister of the Unit
ed Kingdom, a country that does indeed have
a monarch. The president lives in a massive
mansion that is easily the equal of Bucking
ham Palace, while the prime minister lives in
a town-house. When Bush flew over Stan
ford. his Marine One was surrounded by a
half-dozen military helicopters. The prime
minister doesn't even have his own plane.
The president only talks to the media during
infrequent, carefully scripted press confer
ences, so he does not embarrass himself,
while the prime minister endures a weekly,
televised ordeal where he fields whatever
questions are thrown at him from the mem
bers of Parliament.
The two are treated differently by their re
spective nations because the prime minister
is just a guy whose job is running the govern
ment. Whereas the only person we have to
represent the power and prestige of the Unit
ed States of America is our president, when
Britain wants symbolism, they turn to their
royal family.
That's why the legal troubles of the Bush

twins get reported on the front page of the
limes of India, and there are villagers in
Mongolia who know that Bill Clinton had sex
with Monica Lewinsky the symbolic
role of the president is important. If we elect
someone that we wouldn't want to have a
beer with, then, by extension, the rest of the
world won't want to have a beer with us.
Usually, however, attractive, friendly peo
ple with nice voices have developed those
traits at the expense of other qualities that
are more useful in governing, like aggressive
ness, intelligence and wonkish attention to
detail. That's why we so often have to choose
between a genial incompetent and an un
charismatic egghead, like George W. Bush vs.
A 1 Gore.
Iliese trade-offs are part of what make
our presidential elections both more difficult
and more boring than they should be. When
ever we really want to focus on how inspiring
Barack Obama is, we need to realize that
we're about to give this man tremendous
power over the future of the world. Whenev
er we focus on Hillary's experience, we also
have to think about whether she is the right
face for America to present to the world.
And then, even if we elect a president with

both charisma and competence, I think I'll
have a nagging sense that we've gotten the
worst of both deals. Will we have someone
who is less charismatic or less intelligent than
if he had specialized?
But there is a solution to this problem. We
need to separate the ceremonial and admin
istrative roles of the presidency and give
them to two people. Suddenly, a massive
range of possibilities opens up. We can have
our movie star and our nerd at the same time.
Let's elect a King in addition to the Presi
dent.
The King wouldn't need to have beliefs or
policies. He could focus on unifying the coun
try. He could just go to ribbon-cuttings and
make friendship visits to other countries. He
could have Hollywood speech-writers who
would be freed from the burden of trying to
solve problems. Instead they could give us a
steady array of short speeches, rousing or
solemn as the occasion demanded, perfect
for the evening news.
And our President wouldn't need to look
good. He wouldn't need for people to like
him. He could just sit in some Washington
sub-basement surrounded by white papers
and policy briefs and budgets.
Forget Hillary Clinton, let's get some
arch-nerd no one has heard of to be Presi
dent. And forget Barack Obama, I say we
elect Harrison Ford as King. We wouldn't
need to settle anymore.

Rahul Kanakia thinks its too had that Charlton
Heston is dead. He would have had my vote for
King any day. Email him at rahkan@stanford.
