## BIG INNING BLUES Ratliff homers again, but Card falls 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
No. 6 Stanford baseball rolled into its af
ternoon match-up with San Francisco yester
day riding a three-game winning streak and
looking to build momentum in its final non
conference contest of the season. But an of
fensive outburst from the Dons in the fourth
inning led to an ultimately insurmountable
lead as USF outpaced Stanford. 13-9, aveng
ing a Cardinal win in extra innings on April
16.
The Cardinal (28-16-2,10-5 Pac-10) start
ed freshman right-hander Alex Pracher
against the Dons (29-21): the freshman has
gotten off to a rocky start in his collegiate ca
reer with a 1-1 record and an 8.04 ERA.
Pracher was wild to start the contest as he al
lowed a leadoff double in the bottom of the
first. USF got on the scoreboard before the
end of the next at-bat as a passed ball and
wild pitch brought the runner home.
Pracher would go on to allow three runs in
1.1 innings of work, foreshadowing a rough
day for the Cardinal staff in which four pitch
ers allowed multiple runs and lasted less than
two frames.
The Cardinal, however, showed the ability
to keep up with San Francisco early in the
game, as junior center fielder Sean Ratliff hit
his team leading 15th homerun on the season,
driving in senior Randy Molina and junior
Brent Milleville to briefly give the Cardinal
the lead before USF answered back in the
bottom half of the inning.
In its last two victories, Stanford has used
big innings — a five-run eighth and 11-run
ninth at San Jose State and a four-run fifth
against Pacific two nights ago — to achieve
victory, but in a bit of role reversal, it was the
Dons putting up a crooked number to bury
Stanford's hopes.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, with
the score tied at three, the Dons rallied with

bAME NOTcS: The Cardinal were riding a three game
winning streak before losing at USF yesterday. They are
0-1-1 against Cal so far this year, with both games
being played in Berkeley and the most recent ending in
a 5-5 tie after 13 innings. Stanford is currently a half
game behind ASU in the Pac-10. The Friday game is

senior David Stringer on the mound, hitting
three consecutive singles to start the inning,
putting runners at the corners with USF on
top by a run. Freshman Michael De Groot
came on in relief of Stringer, but immediately
walked a batter to load the bases. One out
later USF right fielder Garrett Luippold hit a
two-RBI single to right, which was followed
immediately by first baseman Mitchell
Bialosky's three run homer. De Groot al
lowed another two singles before recording
his second strikeout and being relieved.
Junior right hander Max Fearnow finished
out the inning for the Cardinal, allowing just
one additional run to cross the plate. But the
damage was done as the Dons scored all the
runs they would need, taking a 10-3 lead.
Fearnow went on to throw three solid in-

nings, allowing just one earned run.
His outing was by far the best of any
Stanford pitcher yesterday and gave
the Cardinal a chance to come back,
as the squad rallied for three runs in
the fifth. Stanford plated another
three in the eighth as senior right
fielder Brendan Domaracki hit the
second three-run homer of the day.
which marked his first round-tripper
of his season. But the Dons added an
insurance run in the seventh and an
other two in the eighth to put the
game away at 13-9.
The Cardinal will now have a
couple of days off before taking on
California (29-15-2.9-9 Pac-10) in a
three game series beginning on Fri
day. The Bears are currently tied for
fourth in the Pac-10.
Stanford needs every win it can
get down the stretch, as it currently
sits a half game behind Arizona
State's 12-6 record in the conference
standings. Friday's game is set to
begin at 6 p.m. at Klein Field at
Sunken Diamond and is Town &
Country Village Fireworks Night.
