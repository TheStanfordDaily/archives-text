# Warriors: the time to act is now
## 
### 
The Mavs are gone and Avery
Johnson is out in Dallas. The
Suns and Mike D'Antoni?
Ditto and probably ditto. Even the
once mighty Spurs are down 2-0 fac
ing the upstart Hornets in the wild
Western Conference playoffs, as
Chris Paul and company are poised
to shred the defending champions.
Everywhere you look in the
NBA, big changes are afoot. The
Celtics? Clearly back as they have
been all season. But it was a midsea
son trade for Pau Gasol that made
the Lakers perhaps their most like
ly opponents in the Finals. That is if
KG, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce can
make it that far. The Association is
currently undergoing a seismic shift
as the old guard steps aside for the
new guard ... which, ironically, ex
cept for the Hornets, was actually
the old guard not so long ago.
So, let's say you're the old guard.
The current version, 1 mean. What
exactly do you do? More and more
across not just basketball, but all
professional sports in the US, the
procedure teams are coming to
seems to be increasingly odd. The
new trend seems to be blowing up a
franchise before it collapses in on it

self, and that's probably the smart
way to do things.
Look at the Lakers for example
— yes, they probably could have
won, another title with Shaq and
Kobe, or at least challenged for one,
but there's no way they would have
been able to set themselves up for
another title run so quickly, as the
Gasol-Bryant-Andrew Bynuni core
looks to be one of the NBA s most
solid going forward. It was because
Los Angeles acknowledged that
their current situation wasn't going
to be great for them over the long
haul that the team was able to re
build itself into the contender it has
become now.
Whether firing a coach falls
under that general umbrella of
knocking down the old so that you
can build up the new is another mat
ter entirely, but the fact remains
that more and more teams are
choosing to be brutally honest with
themselves in order to save long
term pain. As the example of the
Lakers shows, this is, indeed, a phi
losophy of team building that has
plenty of merit. But the question
then becomes: when is the right
time to pull the trigger on a rebuild

ing project?
And. locally, is the time now right
for the Golden State Warriors —
who suffered a late season collapse
— to stage their own mini-rebuild?
Perhaps attempting to trade older
players and make youngsters
Monta Ellis, Andris Biedrins and
Brandan Wright the new center
pieces?
It's a difficult problem, and it's
one that another Bay Area team has
recently failed dealing with, albeit
in a different sport.The San Francis
co Giants rode the Barry Bonds
gravy-train beyond any sensible
limits; it wasn't until this off-season
when the team began to contem
plate life without one of the greatest
offensive forces to ever play the
game.
A forward-thinking team might
have realized that the years where
Barry could be expected to carry
the Giants single-handedly were
over following 2004's heartbreak
ing near miss of the postseason.
Bonds' injury riddled 2005 season
should have sent a much clearer
message. By 2006, even the slowest
of GM's would have realized that
the former star's best days were be

hind him and it was time to move
on.
But the Giants waited until mid
way through 2007 to begin rebuild
ing their barren farm system, and
tried to hedge their bets by signing
the ever-consistent Barry Zito to a
gigantic contract in the '06 off-sea
son. A look at the standings and at
Zito's statistics as a Giant should
show you just how well that's turn
ing out.
So what's to be done in the situa
tion here, by the Bay, when it comes
to the Warriors? Well, a good start
would be picking a plan and sticking
with it. If Golden State wants to be
in the playoff bonanza next season
(and really, we should all be hoping
for that given the sheer entertain
ment that has been the Warriors up
tempo style in recent years), they
need to make the tough choices. It's
your move, Warriors.
