# Internet rumors fly regarding Moonbeans

### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Despite the claims of frantic email
rumors, popular campus coffee shop
Moonbeans will not be packing up its
espresso machines - at least not yet.
Though Moonbeans, which contracts
its campus operations with Stanford
Libraries, is coming to the end of its sec
ond five year contract, the snack-serving
espresso house may not necessarily be
going anywhere.
"This is the normal, natural end of a
contractual relationship," said Andrew
Herkovic, director of Communications
and Development for the Stanford
Libraries, "which is not to say that it's
the end of the relationship with
Moonbeans."
The panic surrounding the possibility
of life without Moonbeans surfaced on
email chat lists, as a Moonbeans survey
was emailed across campus.
"This [panic] is a complete misinter
pretation of the facts," Herkovic said. "1
gather that this rumor situation has a
lot to do with the fact that Moonbeans
put out a survey of its customers. It
really has nothing to do with the larger

reality."
"I'm really kind of tickled that the
fear of Moonbeans going away created
a little commotion," he continued. "The
libraries had to make some effort to get
that building approved in the first place
... and in a sense, it's really gratifying
that the students care enough about it to
be worried."
Students have, in fact, expressed
quite a bit of concern.
"It was a surprise to me that they are
considering closing down Moonbeans,"
said Bowen Jiang "08. "Where are stu
dents going to get caffeinated on East
Campus if there's no Moonbeans?"
Rachel Wolfson' 11 echoed this state
ment.
"1 go to Moonbeans every day and
practically live in the library," she said. "I
really don't know what I would do with
out my Moonbeans fix."
But Herkovic reassured The Daily
that students will definitely be able to
get their East Campus coffee in the
future.
"The libraries and University have
every intention of offering a coffee con
cession in the location currently called
Moonbeans," he added. "Whether it

happens to be that company or another
I don't know. It depends on a bidding
process ... but that has nothing to do
with the University forcing anything nor
does it have anything to do with the con
tinuing service of the coffee operation at
that location."
The important thing to take away,
according to Herkovic, is that coffee will
continue to be provided at that location
and the only thing in question is who
will be doing that providing.
"There is no plan to close the coffee
shop," added University Librarian
Michael Keller.
"I like Moonbeans, I like their stuff,
so 1 prefer Moonbeans over something
else," said Eric Boromisa '08."But I pre
fer a coffee shop over some other func
tion of that building. Given that there's
no CoHo [at the moment],
[Moonbeans] fills the niche."
Even if the coffee shop lives on as
something other than Moonbeans, how
ever, some students feel that it will not
be the same.
"[Moonbeans] is more than just a
coffee shop," said Molly Spaeth "11. "It's
