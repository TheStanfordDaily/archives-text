## Mauer double breaks up Floyd's no-no in ninth 
### RICK GANO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHICAGO - Gavin Floyd's no-hit
bid lasted until the ninth this time. Joe
Mauer doubled with one out off
Chicago's young right-hander for the
Minnesota Twins' only hit and Floyd
had to settle for a 7-1 victory Iliesday
night as the White Sox ended a six
game losing streak.
Floyd (3-1) was taken out to a
standing ovation after Mauer's double
to left-center and Bobby Jenks came
on to get the final two outs.
Floyd, who held Detroit hitless for
7 1-3 innings on April 12 before Edgar
Renteria singled, walked three and
struck out four.The only run the T\vins
could muster was aided by an error on
Chicago left fielder Carlos Quentin in

the fourth inning.
With a spirited crowd at U.S. Cellu
lar Field cheering loudly. Brendan
Harris struck out looking at a curve
hall to start the ninth inning. As the
tension built. Mauer drove a ball into
the gap — Chicago center fielder
Nick Swisher made a diving attempt
but was about a foot short — to end
Floyd's bid and his night.
Manager Ozzie Guillen then
popped out of the dugout and went to
get his 25-year-old right-hander, who
threw 105 pitches.
After Floyd walked Mauer to lead off
the fourth. Justin Morneau hit a slicing
liner to left that Quentin got his glove
on but couldn't hold for an error. One
out later, Jason Kubel's sacrifice fly
gave the T\vins a run without a hit and
cut Chicago's lead to 3-1.

After Morneau reached on the
error, the 6-foot-5 Floyd got stronger
and appeared on his way to pitching
the second-no hitter at U.S. Cellular
Field in just more than a year.
Mark Buehrle pitched the 16th no
hitter in White Sox's history on April
18,2007 against Texas.
Floyd is a former first-round pick of
the Phillies whose career never took
off in Philadelphia where he was 7-5
with a 6.% ERA from 2004-06 when
he made 1 9 starts. He joined the White
Sox along with Gio Gonzalez in a
trade for Freddv Garcia in December,
2006.
He was 1-5 a year ago when he
made 10 starts for the White Sox while
splitting time between the majors and
Triple-A. But he has found his con
fidence and his stuff this season as
the White Sox's No. 5 starter.
Floyd took his first loss of the
season in his previous outing
against the Twins in the
Metrodome on April 29 when he
gave up five hits and three runs in
six innings.
1 le survived a shaky first Tuesday
night, walking two of the first three
batters before escaping the threat.
And on a comfortable 70-degree
night, he kept the Twins in check for
most of the night. His only career
complete game was a five-inning
win over the Mets almost two year
ago on May 11,2006.
Twins manager Ron Gardenhire
missed his fourth straight game fol
lowing the death of his brother last
Thursday. He is expected to rejoin
the team Wednesday.
Jermaine Dye hit his fourth
homer of the season leading off the
bottom of the sixth off Nick Black
burn (2-2). who gave up six hits and
four runs in six innings. That put the
White Sox and Floyd up 4-1. Quentin
added a two-run single off Jesse
Grain in the bottom of the seventh.
