### RICK GANO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHICAGO - Gavin Floyd's no-hit
bid lasted until the ninth this time. Joe
Mauer doubled with one out off
Chicago's young right-hander for the
Minnesota Twins' only hit and Floyd
had to settle for a 7-1 victory Iliesday
night as the White Sox ended a six
game losing streak.
Floyd (3-1) was taken out to a
standing ovation after Mauer's double
to left-center and Bobby Jenks came
on to get the final two outs.
Floyd, who held Detroit hitless for
7 1-3 innings on April 12 before Edgar
Renteria singled, walked three and
struck out four.The only run the T\vins
could muster was aided by an error on
Chicago left fielder Carlos Quentin in

the fourth inning.
With a spirited crowd at U.S. Cellu
lar Field cheering loudly. Brendan
Harris struck out looking at a curve
hall to start the ninth inning. As the
tension built. Mauer drove a ball into
the gap — Chicago center fielder
Nick Swisher made a diving attempt
but was about a foot short — to end
Floyd's bid and his night.
Manager Ozzie Guillen then
popped out of the dugout and went to
get his 25-year-old right-hander, who
threw 105 pitches.
After Floyd walked Mauer to lead off
the fourth. Justin Morneau hit a slicing
liner to left that Quentin got his glove
on but couldn't hold for an error. One
out later, Jason Kubel's sacrifice fly
gave the T\vins a run without a hit and
cut Chicago's lead to 3-1.

After Morneau reached on the
error, the 6-foot-5 Floyd got stronger
and appeared on his way to pitching
the second-no hitter at U.S. Cellular
Field in just more than a year.
Mark Buehrle pitched the 16th no
hitter in White Sox's history on April
18,2007 against Texas.

the Phillies whose career never took
off in Philadelphia where he was 7-5
with a 6.% ERA from 2004-06 when
he made 1 9 starts. He joined the White
Sox along with Gio Gonzalez in a
trade for Freddv Garcia in December,
2006.
