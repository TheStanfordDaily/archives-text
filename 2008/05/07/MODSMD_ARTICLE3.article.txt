# STUDENT LIFE
## University examines privacy law 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE ERIC MESSINGER 
In the wake of school violence in
2007, including the shooting at
Virginia Tech. Stanford and other
universities are paying more atten
tion to student mental health and to
those who may he prone to violence.
This attention, however, brings up a
number of legal and ethical issues
relating to students' privacy.
Both the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
and the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
protect information privacy on col
lege campuses by heavily restricting
the circumstances in which mental
health information can be released.
Only in the case of an emergency sit
uation, where a student is considered
an imminent threat to themselves or
others, may a professional release
information on her patient.
The Federal Education
Department enacted new regulations
in March to reassure universities that
they will not face penalties for
reporting concerns about the mental
health of students in emergency situ
ations.
"In the case of an immediate
threat, mental health professionals
have a duty to provide a warning,"
said University General Counsel
Debra Zumwalt. "FERPA will pro
tect information, but in the case of an
immediate threat you can do what
you need to do."
Stanford's use of private medical
data falls under the purview of both
these federal acts and California law,
and the University's policies are
guided by legal dictates.
"We really do stay within the
boundaries." Zumwalt said.
Zumwalt provided an example of
a situation where Stanford would
release information.
"Essentially, if there's a student who
is believed to be a danger, we would
act," Zumwalt said.
"If they said, I hate that Daily
newspaper, I'm going to burn it
down, we would warn you."
Though the shootings have not
changed the letter of the law, they
have brought renewed attention to
university policies.
"Virginia Tech caused us to think
again about security and communi
cations issues," Zumwalt said.
The most significant change in
University policy has been the for
mation of a task force that meets to
discuss issues of general student
health, as well as, in special circum
stances. cases of individual students
that might require additional atten
tion or further action.
"We discuss the climate of mental
health on campus, and how to deal
with specific issues." Zumwalt said.
"Hut we always try to comply with
legal restrictions."

"I hope we are never in a situa
tion where we have to sacrifice [the
privacy of a student] for the [safety
of the school]," Zumwalt added.
Zumwalt emphasized that
Stanford has not had a history of dis
putes over its use of data.
"We haven't had any complaints
in the eight years I've been here," she
said. "As well. Vaden and CAPS
[Counseling and Psychological
Services] want to be careful, and
maintaining the trust of students is
crucial to the process."
Some students felt that informa
tion should be acted on in the inter
ests of safety, within limits.
"When a student specifically
threatens people, it is okay for the
administration to violate their priva
cy for the wider safety of the school,"
said Jeannette Westwood '11.
"However, it is not right to release a

person's mental health information
just because they are angry or feeling
violent in general."
Others expressed doubts that
there could be an acceptable situa
tion to act.
"There's always going to be the
extreme circumstance where some
one is actually the Incredible Hulk,"
said Andrew Suciu iO. "But other
wise. you're violating rights for an
uncertain reward."
