## University examines privacy law 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE ERIC MESSINGER 
In the wake of school violence in
2007, including the shooting at
Virginia Tech. Stanford and other
universities are paying more atten
tion to student mental health and to
those who may he prone to violence.
This attention, however, brings up a
number of legal and ethical issues
relating to students' privacy.
Both the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
and the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
protect information privacy on col

the circumstances in which mental
health information can be released.
Only in the case of an emergency sit

an imminent threat to themselves or
others, may a professional release
information on her patient.
The Federal Education
Department enacted new regulations
in March to reassure universities that
they will not face penalties for
reporting concerns about the mental
health of students in emergency situ

"In the case of an immediate
threat, mental health professionals
have a duty to provide a warning,"
said University General Counsel
Debra Zumwalt. "FERPA will pro
tect information, but in the case of an
immediate threat you can do what
you need to do."
Stanford's use of private medical
data falls under the purview of both
these federal acts and California law,
and the University's policies are
guided by legal dictates.
"We really do stay within the
boundaries." Zumwalt said.
Zumwalt provided an example of
a situation where Stanford would
release information.
"Essentially, if there's a student who
is believed to be a danger, we would
act," Zumwalt said.
"If they said, I hate that Daily
newspaper, I'm going to burn it
down, we would warn you."
Though the shootings have not
changed the letter of the law, they
have brought renewed attention to
