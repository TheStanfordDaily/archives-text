As Sen. Barack Obama (13-111.) earned a deci
sive victory in the North Carolina primary Tuesday
night and fought to a virtual tie in Indiana with his
rival. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.). his
supporters on campus were happy with the results
and predicted that the Democratic Party would
coalesce behind whomever the eventual nominee
is.
Obama's convincing win in North Carolina,

where he beat Clinton by 14 percentage points,
seemed to blunt the momentum she had built since
her win in the Pennsylvania primary two weeks
ago. In doing so, Obama s supporters on campus
indicated, the Illinois senator seemed to have
weathered the storm surrounding the incendiary
comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his
former pastor.
Obama's big win in North Carolina combined
with a split decision in Indiana means that he will
earn a larger share of the 200-plus delegates at
stake in the two states last night and increase his

already substantial lead over Clinton in that col
umn.
"Barack exceeded expectations going into
[TUesday] in both states," said Jonathan Jourdane
'08, the campus coordinator for Students for
Barack Obama, on Tuesday evening. "He was pro
jected in the latest polls to lose Indiana by five or
six percent and he's either going to win or it's going
to be really close. For North Carolina, he also
exceeded expectations there."
At press time, Clinton held a slim
23,000-vote lead in Indiana, which she
seemed to have won by a mere two
percentage points. Results from the
Hoosier State were not known until
after 10 p.m. Pacific Time because
Lake County, a virtual suburb of
Chicago, counted its votes very slowly.
"I'm thrilled that Senator
Clinton was victorious this
evening," said Clinton supporter
Patrick Cordova '09. "1 hope that
her wins will continue."
Sarah Woodward '09 backed
Clinton early in the primary season,
but she realized that the Illinois sena
tor had a power to reach out to peo
ple who were not typically interested
in politics.
"As the campaign has gone fur
ther, I've started to be excited for
Obama's new perspective," she said.
"I feel like he's not as tainted by the
system, -which I have kind of lost
faith in."

Jourdane said that there are a
number of committed Stanford stu
dents who were in Indiana campaign
ing for the Illinois Senator, who has
consistently outperformed his rival
among college students.
"Because Indiana was so close we
have a bunch of Stanford students
there working," he said. "Some are
there full time, some just for the
week."
He said that Charlie Davis '08
graduated early to become a full-time
field organizer for Obama in
Indianapolis and that there will be
Stanford students traveling to many
of the upcoming primary states,
including nearby Oregon, which
votes on May 20. Jourdane added
that there are Stanford students
working five days per week in the
Palo Alto field office making calls to
the voters in states that have yet to
cast their ballots.
Support for Obama on campus
transcends the undergraduate popu
lation. Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-
Haims '89 and Law School student
Matt Haney J.D. '10 were recently
picked to represent California's 14th

district, which includes Stanford, as
Obama delegates at the 2008
Democratic National Convention in
August in Denver.
While on-campus Obama sup
porters are celebrating Tuesday's vic
tory, some backing Clinton hope the
race will continue. Cordova dis
agreed with people pressing her to
drop out of the race.
"1 think that they're discounting a
significant amount of Americans who
clearly support her campaign," he
said. "To suggest she should just drop
out, we're suggesting their voice is not
valid."
Cordova also pointed out one
bonus of an extended primary season
— it has brought Democrats to the
polls in unprecedented numbers.
"There have been all these special
elections," he said, "and because of
that, there's been higher Democratic
turnout so that we've been able to win
some of these seats."
Despite the furor surrounding
Obama in recent weeks as specula
tion about his relationship with Rev.
Wright seemed to hurt him. Jourdane
was optimistic that the Democratic
Party would unite around him should'

he win the nomination.
"The Democratic Party will unite
b\ November to win the general elec
tion, regardless of who the nominee
is," Jourdane said. "And we can only
hope that Obama and Hillary sup
porters will come together to win in
November and 1 think we will."
Recent polls have indicated that
shrinking numbers of both candi
dates' supporters would be willing to
back the other if their candidate did
not win the nomination — a sign of
the increasingly divisive turn the cam
paign has taken in recent weeks. A
CNN poll from TUesday, for example,
revealed that only 48 percent of
Clinton supporters said they would
back Obama if he were the nominee.
But Jourdane predicted that these
divisions would disappear as the gen
eral election approaches.
"I think that'll definitely change,"
he said. "The election in November is
too important and people are just so
into every state's primary and every
state's caucus that I'm certain that by
November that the Democratic
Party will unify around the nominee
and win."
Nonetheless, Jourdane said, the
protracted fight for the nomination
has been nothing if not thrilling.
"It's exciting," he said. "It's an
emotional roller coaster."

As Sen. Barack Obama (13-111.) earned a deci
sive victory in the North Carolina primary Tuesday
night and fought to a virtual tie in Indiana with his
rival. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.). his
supporters on campus were happy with the results
and predicted that the Democratic Party would
coalesce behind whomever the eventual nominee
is.
Obama's convincing win in North Carolina,

where he beat Clinton by 14 percentage points,
seemed to blunt the momentum she had built since
her win in the Pennsylvania primary two weeks
ago. In doing so, Obama s supporters on campus
indicated, the Illinois senator seemed to have
weathered the storm surrounding the incendiary
comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his
former pastor.
Obama's big win in North Carolina combined
with a split decision in Indiana means that he will
earn a larger share of the 200-plus delegates at
stake in the two states last night and increase his

already substantial lead over Clinton in that col
umn.
"Barack exceeded expectations going into
[TUesday] in both states," said Jonathan Jourdane
'08, the campus coordinator for Students for
Barack Obama, on Tuesday evening. "He was pro
jected in the latest polls to lose Indiana by five or
six percent and he's either going to win or it's going
to be really close. For North Carolina, he also
exceeded expectations there."
At press time, Clinton held a slim
23,000-vote lead in Indiana, which she
seemed to have won by a mere two
percentage points. Results from the
Hoosier State were not known until
after 10 p.m. Pacific Time because
Lake County, a virtual suburb of
Chicago, counted its votes very slowly.
"I'm thrilled that Senator
Clinton was victorious this
evening," said Clinton supporter
Patrick Cordova '09. "1 hope that
her wins will continue."
Sarah Woodward '09 backed
Clinton early in the primary season,
but she realized that the Illinois sena
tor had a power to reach out to peo
ple who were not typically interested
in politics.
"As the campaign has gone fur
ther, I've started to be excited for
Obama's new perspective," she said.
"I feel like he's not as tainted by the
system, -which I have kind of lost
faith in."

Jourdane said that there are a
number of committed Stanford stu
dents who were in Indiana campaign
ing for the Illinois Senator, who has
consistently outperformed his rival
among college students.
"Because Indiana was so close we
have a bunch of Stanford students
there working," he said. "Some are
there full time, some just for the
week."
He said that Charlie Davis '08
graduated early to become a full-time
field organizer for Obama in
Indianapolis and that there will be
Stanford students traveling to many
of the upcoming primary states,
including nearby Oregon, which
votes on May 20. Jourdane added
that there are Stanford students
working five days per week in the
Palo Alto field office making calls to
the voters in states that have yet to
cast their ballots.
Support for Obama on campus
transcends the undergraduate popu
lation. Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-
Haims '89 and Law School student
Matt Haney J.D. '10 were recently
picked to represent California's 14th

district, which includes Stanford, as
Obama delegates at the 2008
Democratic National Convention in
August in Denver.
While on-campus Obama sup
porters are celebrating Tuesday's vic
tory, some backing Clinton hope the
race will continue. Cordova dis
agreed with people pressing her to
drop out of the race.
"1 think that they're discounting a
significant amount of Americans who
clearly support her campaign," he
said. "To suggest she should just drop
out, we're suggesting their voice is not
valid."
Cordova also pointed out one
bonus of an extended primary season
— it has brought Democrats to the
polls in unprecedented numbers.
"There have been all these special
elections," he said, "and because of
that, there's been higher Democratic
turnout so that we've been able to win
some of these seats."
Despite the furor surrounding
Obama in recent weeks as specula
tion about his relationship with Rev.
Wright seemed to hurt him. Jourdane
was optimistic that the Democratic
Party would unite around him should'

he win the nomination.
"The Democratic Party will unite
b\ November to win the general elec
tion, regardless of who the nominee
is," Jourdane said. "And we can only
hope that Obama and Hillary sup
porters will come together to win in
November and 1 think we will."
Recent polls have indicated that
shrinking numbers of both candi
dates' supporters would be willing to
back the other if their candidate did
not win the nomination — a sign of
the increasingly divisive turn the cam
paign has taken in recent weeks. A
CNN poll from TUesday, for example,
revealed that only 48 percent of
Clinton supporters said they would
back Obama if he were the nominee.
But Jourdane predicted that these
divisions would disappear as the gen
eral election approaches.
"I think that'll definitely change,"
he said. "The election in November is
too important and people are just so
into every state's primary and every
state's caucus that I'm certain that by
November that the Democratic
Party will unify around the nominee
and win."
Nonetheless, Jourdane said, the
protracted fight for the nomination
has been nothing if not thrilling.
"It's exciting," he said. "It's an
emotional roller coaster."
