As Sen. Barack Obama (13-111.) earned a deci
sive victory in the North Carolina primary Tuesday
night and fought to a virtual tie in Indiana with his
rival. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.). his
supporters on campus were happy with the results
and predicted that the Democratic Party would
coalesce behind whomever the eventual nominee
is.
Obama's convincing win in North Carolina,

where he beat Clinton by 14 percentage points,
seemed to blunt the momentum she had built since
her win in the Pennsylvania primary two weeks
ago. In doing so, Obama s supporters on campus
indicated, the Illinois senator seemed to have
weathered the storm surrounding the incendiary
comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his
former pastor.
Obama's big win in North Carolina combined
with a split decision in Indiana means that he will
earn a larger share of the 200-plus delegates at
stake in the two states last night and increase his

already substantial lead over Clinton in that col
umn.
"Barack exceeded expectations going into
[TUesday] in both states," said Jonathan Jourdane
'08, the campus coordinator for Students for
Barack Obama, on Tuesday evening. "He was pro
jected in the latest polls to lose Indiana by five or
six percent and he's either going to win or it's going
to be really close. For North Carolina, he also
exceeded expectations there."
