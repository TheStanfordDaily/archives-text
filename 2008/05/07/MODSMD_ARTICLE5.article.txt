### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
It is safe to say that Phil Kao has been through it all.The
senior has lived the highs and the lows as a member of the
Stanford tennis team, both individually and as a part of the
team.
From tight matches in the NCAA championships to sea

have surgery in March of 2007. The coaches thought Kao

collegiate match since the surgery, Kao is 7-4 in his last 11
matches alternating between the No. 4,5 and 6 spots.

Zeller and juniors Matt Bruch and Blake Muller will
step into the seniority role next year, and have looked to
Kao this year as the senior figure, even though he is not one
of the "named" captains.
"It was tough for him [with his injury] last year, not able
to be as involved," Zeller said. "But he has embraced the
