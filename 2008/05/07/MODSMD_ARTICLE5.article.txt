# COMPLETE EXPERIENCE
## Senior Phil Kao has seen it all in his Stanford career 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
It is safe to say that Phil Kao has been through it all.The
senior has lived the highs and the lows as a member of the
Stanford tennis team, both individually and as a part of the
team.
From tight matches in the NCAA championships to sea
son-ending injuries, Kao has seen it all at Stanford but has
not missed a beat.
He holds a career record of 49-43 at Stanford despite
battling injuries and having to miss his entire junior season.
He tore a piece of cartilage in his right wrist and had to
have surgery in March of 2007. The coaches thought Kao
might never play again because of the location of the injury
and the nature of the sport. But he is back, and has played
most of this season.
"It's been a struggle trying to find my game since my sur
gery," Kao said. "But my shots have started to come back
and I am playing great."
After a rough start to the year which featured his first
collegiate match since the surgery, Kao is 7-4 in his last 11
matches alternating between the No. 4,5 and 6 spots.
He has been playing very well and has had some big
match-deciding victories. Furthermore, he is the only senior
on a team that features three freshmen and three sopho
mores.
"It's been really fun for me to see Phil transition to a
leadership role on the team this year," said junior Jeff
Zeller.
Zeller and juniors Matt Bruch and Blake Muller will
step into the seniority role next year, and have looked to
Kao this year as the senior figure, even though he is not one
of the "named" captains.
"It was tough for him [with his injury] last year, not able
to be as involved," Zeller said. "But he has embraced the

role [this year), he is a mentor to the
younger guys on the team.
"He's a guy that makes the people
he plays with better."
Kao is in the final stage of his Stan
ford tennis career. This weekend the
Cardinal will open play at the NCAA
championships, his third and final
NCAA tournament.
The senior couldn't have had a bet
ter sendoff before taking to the road
for NCAAs. Playing in his last two
home matches of the year last month,
he won both his singles matches in
front of his friends and teammates, in
cluding the clinching point over Ore
gon in his final home match.
Kao points to the 2006 NCAA
championships as his fondest and
greatest moment in the past four years.
The Cardinal was one of the top
teams in the nation and had the honor
of hosting the tournament. After
breezing through the first three rounds
that included a big upset of fifth-seed
ed Duke, Stanford was in the quarter
finals against Baylor University.
Those who were at that match
know just how intense it was. Rain
forced the match to be moved indoors
in San Francisco. The Cardinal was up

on the Bears 3-1 at one point, but the
Bears charged back and eked out the
victory. 4-3, in a match that lasted over
six hours. Kao played in that match at
No. 6 singles.
"The atmosphere surrounding
Stanford during our run for the cham
pionship is something I will never for
get." he said.
Though all the years on the team
and all things that he has been through.
Kao has remained positive about his
experience at Stanford as a whole.
"It is an honor to be accepted to
Stanford," Kao said. "I would have re
gretted going to any other school."
Injuries aside, his experience with
the Stanford tennis team has been un
forgettable and truly memorable.
"The best part of being on the tennis
team hits been the long hours spent
training and practicing with my team
mates," he said." We spend so much time
together that my teammates and coach
es have become like a second family.
"I can't really imagine what my
Stanford experience would be like if I
was not [on] the tennis team."
