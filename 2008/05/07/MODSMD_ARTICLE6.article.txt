### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting, the Ninth Undergraduate Senate
wrapped up its term and incoming senators
selected a new Senate chair and deputy chair.
During a three-hour long meeting. Senator Tiq
Chapa '10 won the Senate chair election against
returning Senator Patrick Cordova '09 in an 8-
7 vote. Senator Shelley Gao '11 defeated
Senator Stephanie Chan '11 for the deputy
chair seat.
During its last meeting, the Ninth Senate
finalized the remaining funding bills, and out
going members gave advice to the newly elect
ed senators.
"Congratulate yourselves," said outgoing
Senator Jonathan Kass '10. "Be excited for
what you are in store for. It won't always be
fun. but it will always be rewarding."
Outgoing Senate Chair Priyanka Sharnia '09
reflected on the accomplishments of the outgo
ing Senate while also encouraging the new sen
ators.
"In light of our obstacles, we had some good
successes this year," Sharma said. "I am very
happy that we managed to transfer our zest for
the Senate ... There will be many challenges:
deadlines, upset student groups and you may
even be at each other's throats at times. But.
always remember that your ultimate interest is
the student body."
After ASSU Vice President Fagan I larris '09
swore in the new senators, chair and deputy
chair elections took place. Chapa and Cordova
were both nominated for the posi
tion of chair, and after extensive
questioning and deliberation,
Chapa won by one vote.
A key issue on the table was
prior ASSU experience. Some sena
tors said that previous experience
was necessary for the position in
order to maximize on the Tenth
Senate's efficiency and effectiveness
throughout its term.
"1 ran for a second term,"
explained Senator Stuart Baimel '09
after the meeting in an email,
"because 1 felt experience and insti
tutional memory were important to
the Senate; having an experienced
chair was crucial for the Tenth
Senate running better than the
Ninth."
Other Senators, however,
believed that having a newcomer as
Senate chair had its own benefits.
"To be honest," said outgoing
Senator Esosa Ozigbo '10. "whether
it's a new or old senator as chair. 1
don't think experience should be a
hindering thing because it is really
about the passion."
Cordova and Chapa also dis
cussed how to keep other senators
motivated and on task. Both
focused on reminding senators of
their commitment to the student

body.
"1 would say that all of us
worked very hard to be here in the
Undergraduate Senate.' Chapa
said. "We fought very hard and felt
very strongly that we wanted to be
here, and now we are some of the
few that can say we are representing
the entire voice of the student
body."
"We are the only fifteen individ
uals that represent the student body,
and there is a lot of power that
comes with that and we need to
tune that." Cordova added.
hollowing Chapa's narrow victo
ry. senators held the deputy chair
election, in which Gao defeated
Chan 9-6. Gao showed great enthu
siasm for working as deputy chair
next year.
"For me personally," Gao said,
"it is about finding new talent for
the student government. 1 feel like
this is really an area we need to
work on as the ASSU. 1 plan to do
this through the Senate Associate
program."
"1 am so excited. 1 am excited
about the Senate," Gao told The
Daily after the election."! am excit
ed about what we can accomplish,
and 1 am just so thrilled to have this
opportunity to really work with
everyone to make sure that we are
effective senators and that we will
represent our constituent's voices."
