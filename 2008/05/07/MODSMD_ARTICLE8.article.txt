## THE 						RENAKANCE PRE-MED 
### ERICMESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pre-med stu
dents tend to
show a lot of
variety. Many
are brilliant,
more are stressed-out, some
are intense and all of them
hope to live through the
chemistry core. And since
Stanford doesn't offer a pre
med major, students take
their studies in many differ
ent directions, including their
choices for majors.
One of the most popu
lar options for pre-med stu
dents is to major in Biology or
Human Biology (Hum Bio),
which overlap in focus and re
quired courses with pre-med
requirements. While Biology
offers a Bachelor of Science
(8.5.), Hum Bio students
earn a Bachelor of Arts
(B. A.) and are free to pursue
more humanities courses within

the major. Many students find this
balance attractive in choosing their
courses of study.
"I'm interested in aspects of the
humanities," said Sara Parke '09, a

Hum Bio major. "I like political issues,
poetry, writing and other 'fuzzier' activities, and this
provided a broader scope."
"I believe that Human Biology would be more
applicable to me as a doctor." added Stacey Chu
'11, a Hum Bio major. "Biology, certainly, involves
a more detailed understanding of the more minute
parts of animals and plants. Human Biology, how
ever. encompasses the social and cultural side as
well, aspects that I believe would be important to
get a grasp on as a doctor working with people."
Other students find themselves more interested
in the hard sciences, though they occasionally feel
taxed by the combination of scientific and pre-med
ical training.

"It's hard when you take the higher-level math
and engineering courses" said Shashank Ravi '10. a
Chemical Engineering (Chem-E) major. "I sort of
use that as an excuse for not doing as well."
Still, those pursuing rigorous tracks can pick
themselves out of a crowd.
"You definitely know who the other Chem-E
kids are," Ravi said.
With double majors increasingly popular, some
students find themselves bridging the Farm's sci
ence-humanities divide, especially with opportuni
ties for interdisciplinary work.
"I wanted a major that would allow me to take
classes that were of my own particular interests,"
said Ginille Lazaro '09, who is double-majoring in
Hum Bio and Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CSRE). "1 have been able to look at the
'human' side of medicine through my major and the
public service courses that I have had the opportuni
ty to take."
"Because CSRE has a public service concentra
tion track." Lazaro added."l have the opportunity to
engage in many service projects and coursework
that are related to minorities in health."
Other pre-meds have found themselves gravitat
ing towards Classics, a traditional home for students
who want to spend time with Plato and Catullus, for
a kind of complexity different from that of organic
chemistry.
"Classics has done wonders to complement my
science classes," said Classics major Nikita Vashi '09.
"Not only does it have direct applications, for in
stance in that a lot of medical/scientific terminology
has linguistic roots in Ancient Greek, but there are
so many connections between the fields that, to this
day, surprise me every time they pop up."
Classics major Jiahui Lin 10, who had been pur
suing a degree in Biomedical Engineering, also
found a home working with the ancients and revisit
ing the Latin she had taken in high school.
"It sounds cheesy, but when I switched in 1 fell in
love with it again," Lin said.
"Plus at the Classics socials they have better
food,and I'm a big foodie.so 1 definitely think it was
a good decision," she added.
Regardless of their choice, many pre-med stu
dents find themselves bonding closely with other
pre-meds, often more than with their peers in a
major.
"Pre-meds share a certain camaraderie that's ab
sent in other student populations," said Steve Ko'l 1,

who plans to double-major in Spanish and either Bi
ology or Hum Bio. "After all, how can two not he
come close after suffering through the Stanford
chemistry department together?"
Pre-meds often enter college knowing they
want to go to medical school, and the common ob
servation is that the number of pre-meds falls over
the course of four years. Still, some students find
themselves pulled into the track later than they ex
pected, drawn by the possibilities of medicine.
"I basically had my major picked out before I be
came pre-med," said Kristine Baluyot'lO.a Psychol
ogy major. "But 1 started to become unhappy with
how insubstantial psychology can be, and i wanted
to study something clearly physical and clearly
meaningful, that would have a definite impact."
"It was 3 a.m. during the winter quarter of my
junior year when 1 chose," said Daniel Novinson '08,
a major in Public Policy and possible double-major
in Economics, who also writes for The Daily. "I was
pre-law, 1 had taken the LSAT and I knew that you
can have a societal impact through becoming a
lawyer. But 1 was thinking of what was the one field
where I could maximize the odds of doing meaning
ful work, and public health seemed natural."
Many students hope their majors will provide an
interesting four years, even if their careers will take
them elsewhere.
"It's somewhat difficult to do everything you
want to do in college and still fulfill the pre-med re
quirements," said Hillary Lin '11. a Symbolic Sys
tems major. "But even if 1 ultimately decide not to
become a physician, 1 will still have taken classes that
I'm very interested in."
Regardless of students' individual interests, the
lure of medicine still seems to cross all disciplinary
boundaries.
"All my life 1 wanted to be a doctor, largely be
cause both of my parents were doctors," Vashi said.
"But. towards the end of high school. I realized I had
so many other interests, particularly in the humani
ties. At first. I avoided all science classes completely."
"But eventually I enrolled in an introductory
seminar on the cardiovascular system." she contin
ued. "In the second class, we dissected cow hearts
and it was absolutely thrilling. I went back to my
dorm and gushed about it to my roommate who
pointedly remarked.'You're really bad at not being
pre-med.' I realized she was right."
