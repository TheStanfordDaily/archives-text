## Student-run company works with clients to reduce emissions MEMBERS OF ENPALO:

Many students vie for internships at
high-tech companies. But Evan
Macmillan 09, Chris Olivares '10
and Blair Silverberg 4 10 started their
own.
Last year, the three students founded Enpalo.a
company that helps organizations reduce their
emission of carbon-based fuels.
"We were interested in starting some sort of
business in this renewable energy space and even
tually settled on the concept of Enpalo," Macmil
lan said."We met last August in Austin and worked
for two weeks to get the initial groundwork laid for
the company."
Carbon-based fuels are scarce and expensive.
Businesses that rely on fossil fuels face reputa
tional, legislative and environmental risks, so the
incentive to transition to clean technologies is
high. That's where Enpalo comes in.
One focus is to provide organizations with car
bon credits and renewable energy certificates
(RECs) to help them reduce emissions. Credits
essentially put a price on pollution, providing an
economic incentive for companies to lower emis
sions. An REC, meanwhile, represents a
megawatt-hour of electricity produced from a re
newable energy source, signifying that a company
is utilizing renewable energy.
"We provide organizations with information
about renewable energy projects and access to
those projects' credits streams," Silverberg wrote
in an email toThe Daily."The hope is that when or
ganizations have great information and access,
more quality projects will get capitalized and im
plemented."
To do this, Enpalo partnered with Green-e, a
certifier of RECs. Last October in Geneva, the
students also signed an agreement with Gold
Standard, a certifier of carbon credits, to offer
American companies access to high-quality car
bon products.
"It's really exciting for us to be working for an
organization that's aiming for this really high stan
dard," Macmillan said. "And for companies, they
get to be connected to the best organizations in the
world, and get Enpalo's evaluation on any projects
they want to implement in order to reduce the en
vironmental impact [of carbon emissions]."
The company itself has already developed its
own technology. Recently, it debuted Enpalo Hy
brid(tm), the first calculator of its kind to estimate

carbon emissions associated with air travel.
"The calculator takes specific data to come up
with a more accurate emissions number associated
with a flight,"Olivares said."lt'll take into account
specific data — plane type, how much fuel that
plane burns,class,airline,destination,etc. — toget
a carbon footprint of commercial flights."
Research is ongoing. According to its Web site,
enpalo.com, the company is "designing systems to
empower energy accountability."The students are
also working on improving the information pro
vided to companies concerning carbon credits and
RECs.
"We believe that organizations looking to in
vest in renewable energy projects want more in
formation than is currently available," Silvcrberg
said. "Our objective is to bring that information to
organizations."
Right now, the Enpalo team consists of a group
of engineers and mathematicians — also Stanford
students — and an advisory board, chaired by
Palo Alto-based Pacific Edge president Karen
Payne, whose members have business back
grounds in finance, energy and the environment.
And what's more, the company is still recruit-

ing. Students who are good with numbers, interest
ed in the environment or excited about startups
are encouraged to lend their talents. And who
wouldn't be excited about startups? Think about
all those Harvard undergraduates who turned
their heads away from Bill Gates.
But for the founders,it's all about discovery and
the possibility of environmental change.
"We want to do something with our time that's
not only interesting but also impactful," Olivares
said. "We're in an area that can really change the
world, so we're just working very hard to see what
this company can do."
