## GSC approves plan for musical instruments $5,050 allocated for community equipment 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) unanimously voted
Wednesday night to approve a pro
posal that will commit $5,050 to the
purchase of musical equipment that
would be available to all graduate
students.
The proposal was put forth by
Sean Young, a student at the School
of Medicine.
"Graduate students often come
here from other states or other
countries as musicians and some
times don't have their own equip
ment with them," Young said. "This
money will allow us to provide
instruments that can be loaned out
to graduate students, free of charge."
Young plans to use the funding to
purchase a guitar, bass, drum set,
guitar amplifier and bass amplifier,
as well as DJ equipment, for the
graduate community to share. He
stressed that the range of possible
prices for musical instruments such

as these is wide, but thought that the
requested amount — $5050 —
would allow him to buy quality
equipment at a reasonable price.
The funding will also cover all main
tenance costs.
The equipment will be made
available to all graduate students for
periods of five hours at a time.
In his proposal. Young also made
the point that increasing accessibili
ty to musical instruments will allow
more bands to form, practice and
perform at events around campus,
fostering a greater sense of commu
nity among the graduate student
body.
The money will come from the
GSC's reserve funds. The council
agreed to commit the money to
Young's project as a bulk sum,
rather than on an instrument-by
instrument basis, because this will
give him more maneuverability in
the bargaining process.
The GSC also voted to loan
smaller amounts of money to
Blackstage, the Comedy Club and
the Stanford Taiwanese Student
Association for upcoming events.
