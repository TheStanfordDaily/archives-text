### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The screening, treatment and
control of high blood pressure are
being handled inadequately nation
wide. according to a new study
released by the Stanford University
School of Medicine.
The study, published in the May
issue of "Hypertension." analyzed
data from a 2003-2004 study on
medical care services provided at
the offices of private physicians
across the country. It found that,
across the board, doctors are not
conducting blood pressure screen
ings routinely enough. Also, a very
low percentage of patients diag

nosed with high blood pressure
actually reach recommended blood
pressure reduction goals after diag
nosis.
The study was authored by for
mer Stanford research associate
Jun Ma and Randall Stafford, asso
ciate professor of medicine.
