## Watering down protests 
### 
Protesting is a little different
here in Santiago, Chile. "The
anarchists decide to take over
our campus about three our four
times a year," said my friend Cesar
from the University of Chile. "We're
surprised it hasn't happened yet this
year," he added,"lt's very normal."
Our conversation followed the
May 1 holiday for the International
Day of the Workers — Labor Day
everywhere but in the United States.
As usual in Chile, the peaceful labor
union marches were interrupted by
occasional rioting.
There are always a number of
young people who take it upon
themselves to try and break things
(obviously windows are just symbols
of capitalist oppression) and fight the
cops that are employed for crowd
control. They do it in the name of
labor, sometimes socialism and occa
sionally anarchy.but I don't think the
real workers appreciate it very much.
It confuses the legitimacy of the
unions with the chaos of the trouble
makers.
"Every year, it's always the same,"
my host mother sighed as we watched
the news. "They get together, throw
rocks and someone gets hurt."
Chile's civil police, the cara
bineros, are pros at dealing with this
sort of thing. They even have a spe
cial crowd control tank with a high
powered water hose as a turret. It's
called a guacon. named after a breed
of spitting llamas. In my first week
here I happened to be downtown
when an impromptu protest broke
out, stopping traffic, and the guacon
cut things very short. I guess it's hard
to protest when you're soaking wet.
When I read about last week's
small anti-war demonstration by
Stanford Says No to War, it made me
kind of nostalgic. The demonstra
tion, complete with a hilarious
sounding reenactment of Bush's
Mission Accomplished speech, was

not big, hut it seemed to get the job
done. The speech even attracted a
double-parody as someone leaned
out of a nearby building shouting far
cical rhetoric about all the reasons
war could be great.
The contrast with Chile reminded
me that I kind of like the protests at
Stanford. All of them. For Israel,
against Israel, sweat-free, fair hiring,
to remember New Orleans, to con
demn the government of Burma and
of course, anti-Rumsfeld.
With a few fun variations like per
formances, hunger strikes, sit-ins and
nudity, the mechanics follow a simi
lar pattern. Student activists gather
along with a smattering of older
"community members" — no one is
ever sure how these people found
out about the protest, but some are
pretty cool if you take the time to
talk to them — and then the speech
es, chants and sign waving begin for
the cause. The crowd is sometimes
mobile, sometimes not.
When it is all over, the students all
still have problem sets and papers, so
the end is usually anticlimactic.
There is often coverage in The Daily,
and if it's really big there might even
be reporters from local papers. In the
interviews, participants are praised,
Stanford's institutional stance to
ward social activism is usually con
demned and protesters denounce
apathy on the part of the student
body that decided not to show up.
Does this sound cynical? Maybe,
but I really do enjoy the protests. I've
never had the fire, or nerve or time
management skills to participate

much, but it is good to see what other
students are passionate about. Even
though I don't support an immediate
withdrawal. I'm truly sorry to have
missed the Mission Accomplished
speech.
What was disappointing about
the anti-war protest was when the
leader of the group reverted to the
same frustration with the entire stu
dent body's apathy that so many
other groups have already worn out.
"[The student body is] concerned
more on making our resumes look
good than trying to solve serious is
sues," he told The Daily.
First, I'd be curious to know
whether the protestors have anti-war
leadership on their resumes. If not,
maybe they should. Are serious is
sues and resumes entirely separate
spheres? And regardless, while some
students are apathetic, many do care
about "serious issues." But they can't
care about all of them all the time.
Most people have one or two ones
they really care about, from saving
cheap birth control to demanding ac
tion on Darfur. If you summed the
number of activists for all the serious
issues, you'd have a higher percent
age of the undergraduates than you
might think.
On a campus with a small under
graduate population and heavy
workload, we should not be ashamed
if our protests are small. The majori
ty of Stanford students may not be
radical enough to get hosed down or
overthrow the school for a few hours,
and yeah, they may want to do their
homework. But measuring commit
ment by willingness to neglect other
responsibilities is a questionable
rubric. Some students are apathetic,
but for many of us, it is wrong to say
that we don't care, even if we don't all
go to every demonstration.

Been in a protest lately? Let Michael
know at wilkerson@stanford.edu.
