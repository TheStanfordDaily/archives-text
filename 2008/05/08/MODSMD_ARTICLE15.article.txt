## Electricity: fuel of the future 
### 
££ A merica is addicted to oil,"
/\ admitted President Bush
A. \. in his 2006 State of the
Union address. Petroleum accounts
for 40 percent of all energy use in the
United States today, and a whopping
96 percent of U.S. transportation en
ergy. Our addiction is a major con
tributor to our economic problems
(the deficit, high product prices), our
social problems (terrorism, war) and
our environmental problems (re
source depletion, climate change). If
we want any chance at continued
prosperity in the future, we will need
to free ourselves from oil.
In order to break our addiction to
this admittedly awe-inspiring sub
stance, we will need a swift economy
wide fuel shift toward an energy re
source that is domestic, efficient, eco
nomic and clean. Despite the hype
around biofuels. the only fuel that
truly meets these needs is electricity.
Not only does electricity meet the
needs of the transportation sector —
it triumphs over both biofuels and
gasoline in all relevant metrics. To
begin with, electricity is the fuel that
most efficiently makes use of the lim
ited resources available to us. Unlike
petroleum, which will eventually be
depleted, electricity can be generat
ed renewably from the sun. Of
course, the biofuels "solution" also
utilizes solar energy. But given an
acre of switchgrass, and an acre of
solar panels, you could drive 70 times
farther in an electric vehicle (EV)
than you could running on cellulosic
ethanol. If we covered all sun-facing
roof space in the United States with
solar panels, we could meet our en
tire transportation energy demand
with solar power. Alternatively, an
area in the desert one-fortieth the
size of Nevada would do. Cellulosic
ethanol would require us to plant a
crop of switchgrass over an area the
size of Colorado and Wyoming com
bined.
With the option of solar power
available to us. electricity is also the
cleanest transportation fuel we have
(black bars in the figure). While the
average U.S. gasoline car emits more
than four tons of carbon dioxide each
year, along with various other pollu-

tants. a solar-powered electric car
would have zero emissions. Current
biofuels have repeatedly been shown
to reduce carbon emissions very lit
tle, if at all, and the research of Stan
ford professor Mark Jacobson has
suggested that widespread use of
ethanol could increase emissions
toxic to human health.
But what if the source of electrici
ty is not the sun? Even charging the
car with power from the average U.S.
electricity grid — half of which
comes from coal — the yearly carbon
emissions would be one and a half
tons, significantly less than gasoline's
four. Even in the wildly unreasonable
scenario that an electric car was
charged with one hundred percent
coal-fired electricity, emissions would
be two and a half tons per year, still
less than corn ethanol's three. Re
gardless of its source, electricity is the
cleanest transportation fuel.
Perhaps most surprisingly, elec
tricity is also the cheapest fuel avail
able (gray bars in the figure). While it
costs almost $1,500 per year to drive
the average gasoline car, and would
cost about $1,200 to fuel up with
ethanol, an electric car would cost

just $300 per year to charge from the
regular power grid. Charging an EV
with residential solar power in Cali
fornia would cost $500. Even in
Massachusetts, which has significant
ly less solar potential than other
parts of the country due to its climate
and latitude, a solar electric car
would cost just $750 per year — half
that of your current gasoline car.
Historically, the biggest drawback
to EVs has been their range — even
today, the best all-electric car, the
Tesla Roadster, is limited to 220
miles per charge. However, in the
coming transition to electric vehicles,
you need not worry that you will be
restricted in your ability to roam.The
all-electric cars of the near future will
be joined by "range-extended elec
tric vehicles" (REVs), also known as
"plug-in hybrids" (PHEVs), which
will feature small gasoline genera
tors to recharge the cars battery on
the-go. With an REV, you will be able
to drive all-electric for your daily
commute (up to about 40 miles per
day), then hybrid gas-electric for an
unlimited range beyond that.
So when can you buy an EV, and
for how much? The first full-featured
EVs will be hitting the road later this
year. Although the Tesla Roadster
EV. which accelerates from zero to
sixty in 3.9 seconds, is selling for
$100,000, more affordable options
are on the way. The Aptera Typ-1
(available as EV or REV) and Chevy
Volt (REV) will be available in 2009
and 2010 respectively, for about
$30,000 each. A Tesla'REV in the
same price range is expected in 2012.
By then, Toyota, Honda and others
can be expected to join the market. If
you can't wait until then, a regular
hybrid like the Prius is the best op
tion for 2008.
But remember, even driving a
Prius will not reduce your petroleum
demand and carbon emissions
enough to solve all the problems as
sociated with oil. If we want a sus
tainable energy source for fuel that is
domestic, affordable and clean, the
only logical choice is electricity.
