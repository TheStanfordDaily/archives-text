## Challenging Sir Rushdie: Just how free is the European media? 
### 
On Monday night, I had the pleasure of
hearing Sir Salman Rushdie, one of my
favorite authors, give a talk on campus.
I found his lecture to be entertaining and pro
found, just as I find his writing. I especially en
joyed his discussion of the responsibility of the
artist: to "open the universe a little bit more"
and push the boundaries of human conscious
ness.
Though the topic of his discussion was pri
marily literature. Mr. Rushdie touched on some
ideas relating to the media. It was in this context
that he made a comment I found confusing.
T\vice during the evening. Mr. Rushdie criticized
the American media for what he described as its
"right-wing authoritarian" suppression of di
verse opinions and alternative viewpoints. Fur
thermore. he asserted that the European media
is in fact more generous and welcoming of di
verse opinions and perspectives than the Amer
ican media. It is true that the American media is
far from perfect. Reporting blunders, overem
phasis of banal, unimportant news items and
layoffs of dozens of employees in necessary cut
backs are testaments to the instability and unre
liability of America's media institutions. Fur
thermore. the rise of the blogosphere has con
vinced many that one need not rely on CNN or
FOX News for information. So yes, American
media institutions are in trouble,but I found Mr.
Rushdie's condemnation of "right-wing author

itarian" news monopolists to he borne more out
of his necessity to compliment and counterbal
ance his critique of "left-wing appeasement of
Islamic Fundamentalism."
That said. 1 found his assessment of Euro
pean media as more open and free than Ameri
can media to be rather bizarre and even trou
bling. First of all, regardless of the increasing co
hesiveness of the European Union, the coun
tries that comprise Europe are incredibly differ
ent from each other, especially politically and
socially, with equally diverse media cultures.
Some European countries do have rather free
media institutions.The most powerful recent ex
ample I can think of was in regards to the resur
gence of the Muhammad cartoons controversy.
To me, the most striking moment occurred in
February of this year when 17 Danish newspa
pers that had initially refused to publish the con
troversial cartoons changed their position and
printed them out of solidarity — solidarity with
a cartoonist who now lives in hiding because of
death threats from offended Muslims.
The fact that newspapers, initially opposed to
printing these cartoons, would change their po
sition solely to support a colleague is a noble and
rare feat. It exemplifies the notion that the con
tent of any published piece is less important
than the freedoms that justify and welcome its
presence in the public forum. Speech is not free
if it is accompanied by the risk of threats and vi

olent actions. In their concerted efforts, the Dan
ish papers sought to show their firm resolve
against intimidation and threats to free public
expression.
France, however, is an entirely different
country with different political and media insti
tutions from those of Denmark. In France, poli
tics and media are often one and the same, no
tably with the case of the television station
France 2. France 2 is nationally owned, meaning
the government has direct control over how
news is presented. Furthermore, the manner in
which the station handles errors in reporting re
flects larger political forces. In recent years,
France 2 made a significant reporting error and
their response has been to ignore and deny the
issue.
I am referring to the story of Muhammad al-
Dura.a Palestinian boy reportedly killed by Is
raeli soldiers in September 2000. The boy's
death at the hands of the IDF served as a pre
text for countless acts of violence against non-
Muslims, ranging from numerous suicide
bombings in Israel to the beheading of Daniel
Pearl. Plentiful evidence clearly demonstrates
the fraudulence of the original news footage.
Not only that, for the last two years, a defama
tion lawsuit has been underway, waged against
an independent media analyst on behalf of
France 2's most prominent foreign correspon
dent, Charles Enderlin.

Still, the French media has been utterly silent
about the Muhammad al-Dura affair.This is not
the silence of ignorance, but a concerted, know
ing silence, designed to protect the reputation of
France 2. This situation epitomizes the corrupt
and suppressive tendencies of French media,
which easily trumps Mr. Rushdie's "right-wing
authoritarian" American media. As Mr.
Rushdie affirmed the transparency and open
ness of the European media, 1 could not help but
wonder what he thinks of France's treatment of
the al-Dura affair. Of course, there is the possi
bility he is not familiar with the case — after all,
he wouldn't have learned about it from the
French press.
In the coming days, we look forward to wel
coming two important figures in the European
media to campus to share their views on these
significant issues. Last night, May 7, Flemming
Rose, the cultural editor of the Danish paper Jyl
lands-Posten who commissioned the now-infa
mous Muhammad cartoons, spoke in Cubberley
Auditorium. On May 12, Philippe Karsenty will
speak on the al-Dura affair and his role as defen
dant in the libel case brought against him by
France 2.1 encourage you to attend these events
and assess whether the European media is as
free as Mr. Rushdie claims it to be.
