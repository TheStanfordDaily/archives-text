## TRANSITION COMPLETE Junior Sean Ratliff moves to center, excels at the plate 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Junior Sean Ratliff has come a long way in
his Stanford career. You might never guess it if
you watched him patrol center field so familiar
ly today, but the anchor of the Stanford outfield
and the big bat in the middle of the order began
his time on the Farm as a freshman working out
of the bullpen.
Indeed, when the southpaw arrived from
Niwot High School in his home state of Col
orado, the now 6-foot-3,225-pound Ratliff was
known as much for his arm as for his bat. In his
final two prep years he batted .580 with 23
homers, but even more important was his pitch
ing; he went 19-0 with a 0.73 ERA. He even
managed to strike out 121 batters in just 64 and
2/3 innings his senior year.
With Stanford's lineup pretty much estab
lished, Ratliff didn't get many chances to swing
the bat as a freshman. He had just 14 at-bats, in
fact, and not a single hit. But there is always
room for another left arm out of the bullpen,
and Ratliff made his presence felt there. He
picked up his first collegiate win in his first ap
pearance, going 3 and 2/3 shutout innings, allow
ing just one hit while striking out six against Cal
State Fullerton. By the end of the season. Ratliff
was 2-0 with a team-leading 9.76 strikeouts per
nine innings pitched.
Things changed a bit his sophomore season.
Ratliff started in the outfield in all but one game
and didn't get a single opportunity to show off
his arm on the hill. No matter. Ratliff dusted off
his bat and knocked out his first and second hits
in the opener â€” against Fullerton again. The
season did not go as the Cardinal hoped, but
Ratliff established himself as an offensive force
at the collegiate level, being named First Team
All-Pac-10 and finishing with a .339 average. He
tied for first on the team in homeruns with 12
and was second in RBls with 45.
Those numbers were good enough to land
him on the Wallace Award-an award given to
the best player in the nation-Watch List this sea
son and, so far, Ratliff hasn't disappointed.
"1 didn't have anything specific 1 wanted to
work on from last year," he said. "I just wanted
to have another good year and keep improving
my game all around."
He has started every game so far in center field,
and has even had a chance to pitch a few games,
picking up two wins. But, as was the case last
year, it has been with the bat that Ratliff has de
fined himself.
He has already passed his power numbers
from last year with a team-leading 15 homeruns
and is tied with fellow junior Jason Castro for
first with 48 RBIs.
But despite the numbers, Ratliff would be
the first to admit that hitting like that is not easy.
It took patience and a lot of hard work for him
to get back on track after enduring a bit of a

slump, which saw him strike out 12 times in just
26 at-bats from the end of April to early May.
"I was a little frustrated that things weren't
coming together for me," said Ratliff. "I spent
some extra time in the cages and put in a lot of
extra work on my own trying to iron things out
and get back on track."
The work seems to have gotten him not just
back on track, but into the zone. In the three
games since that rough patch. Ratliff is 5-for-12
(.417) with four homeruns and 11 RBIs. With a
big Pac-10 series at Sunken Diamond against
Cal this weekend, he could not be heating up at

a better time.
"We are going to have to keep playing good
baseball on the weekends to compete in the
[Pac-10]," Ratliff said. "We have three tough
weekends ahead of us, and it will be important
to get off to a good start against Cal."
Stanford is currently ranked No. 6 and sits
just half a game back from ASU in the confer
ence with a 10-5 record. But to Ratliff and the
rest of this Stanford team, the Pac-10 is just the
beginning of the road.
"When we end practice we break on the
'Omaha,'" Ratliff said, referring to the site of the

College World Series in the middle of June. "To
get there is the goal. It is not that it would be nice
to make it to the College World Series and com
pete for a title, it is that we are expected to do so.
We haven't been able to the last couple of years,
and this year is going to be our chance to get
back there."
It will require everybody to play at their best,
but with players like Ratliff, the Cardinal is con
fident that it has what it takes to keep playing in
June.
