The No. 8 Stanford softball
team travels to Arizona this week
end looking to wrap up its stellar
regular season and secure a third
place finish in the conference. The
Cardinal will play Arizona State
tonight before facing off against
the University of Arizona on Fri
day and Saturday.
The pair of games against No. 9
Arizona (33-16, 10-8 Pac-10 Con
ference) is particularly important
for the Cardinal and could not
have been scripted better for a
season finale. After a sweep in
Oregon last weekend. Stanford
(45-10. 10-8 Pac-10) is tied with
the Wildcats in third place in the
conference.
Either Stanford or Arizona can
assure itself of a third-place finish,
behind No. 2 Arizona State and
UCLA, by sweeping both games.
First up, however, is the Sun
Devils, the Pac-10's top team and a
national power. The Sun Devils
(54-4, 16-2 Pac-10) have the top
offense in the league by a wide
margin. Arizona State hits .335 as
a team, 19 points better than sec
ond-place Arizona, and ASU's
whopping 414 runs is over 100 bet
ter than the next closest team.
Outfielders Kaitlin Cochran
and Jackie Vasquez are the only
two hitters in the conference with
batting averages over .400. with
Cochran hitting .443 and Vasquez
just behind at .418. Cochran, who
has 11 homeruns. is a threat with
power and average, and she has
also drawn 52 walks in 201 plate
appearances, giving her a massive
.606 on-base percentage.
