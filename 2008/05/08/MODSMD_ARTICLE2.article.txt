# New plan for White Plaza
## Renovations to include new stage, expanded lawn 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the spirit of last summer's major reno
vation of Old Union, the University is
embarking on another major construction
project this summer — this time in White
Plaza.
"Students have been polling to improve
White Plaza to make it more student-orient
ed for a number of years," said Cathy Blake,
assistant director and University landscape
architect at the Stanford University
Architect & Planning Office. "After reno
vating Old Union, there was a lot of momen
tum from students, faculty and staff to con
struct in White Plaza as well."
"The President of the University commit
ted part of the presidential fund to support
this project," Blake added.
According to Blake, construction in
White Plaza will begin on June 16 and end
shortly before New Student Orientation
2008 begins on Sept. 14.

"There were five main reasons why we
wanted to renovate Old Union," Blake said.
"To make it safer in terms of traffic, to make
it more organized, to create more shade, to
create more performance locations and to
give White Plaza more of an identity on
campus."
TTie White Plaza construction project,
officially titled the "Campus Center
Exterior Space Plan," will significantly
change the layout and feel of White Plaza.
According to the Executive Summary of
the renovation plan, construction will "clari
fy and improve circulation, reduce asphalt,
consolidate small pieces of unusable lawns
and landscape, create improved outdoor
paces suitable for the various programs iden
tified by the users and generally upgrade the
appearance of the outdoor spaces."
Trees will be added at intervals in the
plaza to create more shade, and concrete
blocks will be added for seating purposes.
Grass fields will be consolidated into one
large park-like central open space between

Old Union and the Bookstore. Pedestrian
sidewalks will also be constructed to create
more regularity and organization in traffic
along White Plaza.
"This construction project will improve
bicycle and pedestrian safety at White
Plaza," said Kelly Rohlfs. project manager at
the Department of Project Management.
"Pedestrians can now walk on the sidewalks,
and bikes will no longer be criss-crossing
through White Plaza. Instead, there will be a
centralized blow of bicycles."
Group bicycle parking will be construct
ed at the four entry points into White Plaza
to encourage bikers to leave their bikes
behind and continue on foot.
An outdoor raised stage will also be built
attached to the side of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
In the construction period. White Plaza
will be fenced off. Detour routes, however,
will allow students and visitors to reach
Tresidder, Old Union, the bookstore and the
Stanford Post Office.

"All businesses will remain open during
construction." said Eva Leavitt, administra
tive associate at the University Architect &
Planning Office.
During renovation, students will easily be
able to access the bike shop and pedestrian
crossings will connect Tresidder and the
Stanford Bookstore to Old Union. From the
Tresidder parking lot. students will have to
go through Braun Music Center to reach the
post office and the Bookstore.

"People will have to walk longer dis
tances around the job site to get to these
locations." Rohlfs said. "But there will be
signs on the fences directing people where
to walk."
"The newly renovated White Plaza will
accommodate all the current programming
that occurs there now," Blake said.
