# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Regionals up next for ladies 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The women's golf team will hit the
links today for the first round of the
NCAA West Regional. Stanford is
ranked No. 8 in their bracket,and will
have to hold or improve that position
in order to make it to the NCAA
Championships — the top eight
teams from each of the four regionals
will advance to the finals.
The Cardinal tied for first in the
2007 West Regional, and will face a
difficult field as it tries to repeat that
result this year. Stanford will face a
slew of Pac-10 foes, such as confer
ence champion and No. 1 seed USC,
No. 2 Arizona State, No. 4 Arizona,
No. 6 Cal and No. 15 Oregon. No. 3
Arkansas and Big 12 title winner No.
5 Oklahoma State headline the out
of-conference competition.

Stanford will face
a difficult field as
it tries to repeat
last year's result.

Stanford is coming off a sixth
place finish at the Pac-10Tournament
and. just before that, its first win of the
year, at the Peg Barnard Invitational.
The Cardinal is led by junior Mari
Chun, the second team All-Pac 10
performer who was Stanford's most
consistent golfer throughout the sea
son — she finished in the top ten in
four tournaments.
But whereas Chun was normally
the Cardinal's lone star during the fall
season, her teammates have begun to
join her at the top of the leader board.
Sophomores Angela King and Cathe
rina Wang have both played well re
cently. Wang, an All-Pac 10 honorable
mention, was Stanford's top finisher
at the Pac-10 Tournament, placing
tenth.
Stanford will need such contribu
tions from all of its players if it hopes
to compete with some of the best
golfers in the country.
USC boasts an impressive five
some. All placed in the top ten at the
Pac-1 OTournament. including individ
ual first place finisher Paola Moreno.
She and teammates Belen Mozo and
Dewi Claire Schreefcl comprised a
third of the All-Pac 10 team, and
Lizette Salas was named the confer
ence's Freshman of the Year.
But there is little drop-off after the
Trojans. Arizona State and Arizona
have star golfers of their own. and
Oregon, despite its lower seeding, still
has good and productive talent on its
squad.
And that's just the in-conference
competition. Oklahoma State had
four players named to the All-Big 12
team, and Pernilla Lindberg won the
conference's Player of the Year
award. Her teammate. Jaclyn Sweeny,
was named Newcomer of the Year
after winning the Big 12 individual
championship.
But while the Cardinal is ranked
under the Cowgirls.it is slotted higher
than a number of other elite teams,
such asTUlsa.The Golden Hurricanes,
the Conference USA champions,
have three players who have placed
within the top two in a tournament
this year, including Leisl Hasbrouck.
who is one of only two amateur play
ers who will compete in this year's
LPGA SemGroup Championship.
It all leads to a tough road to the
NCAAs for the Cardinal, but if the
women hold their ground, they'll be
able to advance to the Championship,
where they finished fifth last year.
The West Regional is hosted by
Sacramento State at the Lincoln Hills
Golf Club. Play will start today and
last through Saturday.
