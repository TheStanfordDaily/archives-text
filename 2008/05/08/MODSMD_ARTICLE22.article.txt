## Students address domestic hunger Food Challenge draws attention to inadequacy of food stamps 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
According to the organizers of the Stanford
Food Challenge, surviving on $3 a day is a reality
that over 28 million Americans have to face, with
federal food stamp payouts only covering $21 a
week.
The Food Challenge, a week-long event that
started Monday and culminates Friday with a din
ner featuring hunger activist Norm Carroll, is
meant to raise awareness of poverty and hunger
in America. The event is led by the new student
group Students Taking on Poverty (STOP) and
co-sponsored by Stanford NAACP, Stanford
American Indian Organization (SAIO). Stanford
Project on Hunger (SPOON), Stanford in

Government (SIG) and Stanford Students for
Relief (SSR).
For the challenge, students pledged to con
sume only $3 worth of food on Wednesday.
Informational booths from the organizations
involved as well as food for the participants were
available at the entrance of Old Union. STOP
Co-director Debbie Warshawsky '08 said that the
food presented at the event reflected the poor
nutritional options available to the poor, a prob
lem which has contributed to the obesity epidem
ic among lower-income people.
According to Tommy Tobin '10. director of
SPOON, an organization that provides food to
homeless people in the area, the event also
aimed to raise awareness about more nascent
poverty activist groups on campus like STOP
and galvanize the student population to get
involved.
"We saw it as a great way to promote our
organization and our goals while helping STOP
out,"Tobin said. "So we are supplying some of the

funding for the event and giving them some pub
licity."
STOP co-director and Food Challenge coordi
nator Alyssa Battistoni '08 said that many
Americans have misconceptions about America's
hunger issues.
"People think that America is the richest
country in the world and hunger means that
you're in sub-Saharan Africa "said Batistoni."We
don't want to contest that that's a very serious
issue, but we also want to bring people's attention
to hunger here at home."
According to Warshawsky, the food challenge
is based on a similar event started by members of
Congress last year in a bid to raise awareness of
the plight of those relying on food stamps.
"We were really moved when we read about
the many civic leaders and Congresspeople who
participated in the Food Stamps Challenge last
year," Warshawsky said.
