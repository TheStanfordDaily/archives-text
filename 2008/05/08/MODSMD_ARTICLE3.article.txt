j lc g| ow i n g rC( j light 0 f th c digital clock changes
to 3:36 as Russell Brown keeps his eyes fixed on
the three numbers. Brown envisions crossing
the finish line and having those same numbers
Wm blazing brightly on the screen. He always makes
sure to look at the clock when it's on the exact time he
hopes to run.
This is one of Brown's several pre-race rituals. The red
shirt senior obviously knows what he needs to do before a
race, being not only one of Stanford's premier middle dis
tance runners, but also standing at the top of the NCAA
rankings.
A nine-time All-American and National Champion,
Brown brings a spark to the Stanford track and field team
â€” and hopes to make it brighter before he ends his
Stanford career this June.
As a fifth-year academic senior. Brown is predominant
ly focusing on his running this quarter, as he only has two

classes to worry about to finish up his co-term degree in
sociology. Brown's typical day at Stanford consists of run
ning, making and eating meals, going to class, watching his
favorite television show ("Law and Order"), doing work,
running more, and resting; he has to allow his body to
recover to prepare for the next day of hard training.

A nine-time All-American and
National Champion, Brown brings a
spark to the Stanford track team.

Brown was first introduced to the sport of running by his
elementary school gym teacher. He hopes to hang up his
running shoes after only slightly more than four years as a
professional runner. Aside from his several Ail-American
honors, numerous school. Pac-10 and national titles belong
to him.
These include a third-place finish at the MPSF
Championships in the mile as a freshman, second place in
the 1,500 meters at Pac-lOs as a sophomore, winner of the
mile at MPSF Championships as a sophomore, a third
place finish after running a career best time of 3:37.56 in the
1,500 meters at NCAA Outdoor Championships as a jun
ior, another win in the mile at MPSF Championships as a
junior, second place at NCAA Indoor Championships in
the mile as a junior, and the highlight of his running career:
winning a national championship in the distance medley
relay at NCAA Indoor Championships in 2007.
Teammate, fellow miler and training partner Garrett
Heath speaks highly of Brown, commending his leadership
and passion for the team.
"Russell has been a great leader for this team over the
past couple of years. 1 le has been a key part in building up
the extremely talented middle distance group that we have
today, and that has allowed us to compete for national
championships the last
couple of years," Heath said.
"Having him around as a workout partner on a daily
basis has been extremely helpful for me," he added. "Being
able to run and train with someone who has such high goals
for themselves inspires you to run faster and train harder as
well. The races that we have run together have been some
of our best memories from college."
A talented middle distance runner who can contribute
in all the distance events. Brown will shortly end his illustri
ous and decorated Stanford career. When asked about his
Olympic and professional potential, he had a lot to say.
"I want to be pro after I finish up my eligibility," he said.
"I am lucky in that I have a lot of friends who have already
navigated this process, and 1 don't think it will be too pre
carious.
"I hope to make the Olympic team this year, and in
London, but it is going to be very, very difficult," he contin
ued. "1 have to be top three at the trials this year, and hon
estly. the odds are against me. But I am due for a break
through. and 1 really do
believe I am capable."
Brown has proven his capability thus far, but taking his
running to the next level will be mentally and physically
taxing. However, Stanford has prepared him well, and
