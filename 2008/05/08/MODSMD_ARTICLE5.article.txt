## Recruiters receive email addresses from Registrar 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Each quarter, the military sends information
about scholarship opportunities through email
to many students who never requested it. What
these students may not know is that, by law, the
Registrar's Office must release student names
and email addresses to military recruiters.
Because of the Solomon Amendment,
passed in 19%, institutions of higher education
that accept federal grants must also allow mili
tary recruitment on campus. Although many
schools claim the military's "Don't Ask. Don't
Tell" policy violates their anti-discriminatory
recruitment policies, the Solomon Amendment
was affirmed in a unanimous Supreme Court
decision in 2006.
In addition to allowing military recruiters on
campus, all federally funded universities,
including Stanford, are required to provide
information about students — including
addresses, telephone listings, date and place of
birth and academic majors — to the military.
"This federal law requires that once a quar
ter. if requested, each branch of the military can
ask for the names and contact information for
enrolled students, and we legally are required
to give it," said Associate University Registrar

Jackie Charon is.
The Registrar's Office makes exceptions for
students who request blocks on this informa
tion. In such cases, however, no information
about the student can be released, not even to
a prospective employer calling to confirm a stu
dent's status.
An Army recruiter, who wished to remain
anonymous due to a policy prohibiting inter
views with the press, said he and his colleagues
try to reach students at least three times each
year.
"We try to send [emails] to most of the jun
iors and seniors, usually at the beginning of the
year, the middle of the year and again at the
end of the year," he said.
The recruiter said he uses the information
given to speculate whether specific students
might be interested in the scholarships.
"The degrees don't say pre-med, pre-dental,
pre-vet. but [for] students studying, say, math or
the hard sciences, we'll email all those seniors
and juniors," he said. "We are only allowed to
send information concerning scholarships to
students. We do not 'target' students — we look
at a student's major and send information that
may be used for continuing education."
Though both are knowledgeable
about the Solomon Amendment and
its implications, neither Larry
Kramer, dean of Stanford Law
School, nor Law Prof. Richard Ford
had heard of this particular policy.
Kramer emphasized that the dis
tribution of student email addresses
is certainly constitutional.
"Especially if students can opt

out, it's hard to see that there's much
basis for objection," he said. "If the
University has raised the cost of opt
ing out, saying it's all or nothing, it
seems there's an easy solution.
Students who don't want to share
their information with the military
should be able to tell the Registrar:
if X calls, you should be able to
share my information with X.' Then
nobody has any legal objections."
The recruiter said that if students
say they do not want to be contact
ed, they are removed from the list
and should not receive any more
emails from military recruiters.

Jeff Ma '08. however, said he had
emailed recruiters telling them to
take him off the list, but continues to
receive emails, albeit from different
recruiters.
"It's more of a nuisance than an
actual problem," Ma said. "I just
ignore them."
Douglas Stanford '09, a physics
major, said he has received recruit
ing emails from at least three differ
ent recruiters since sophomore year.
Stanford said he understood the
University's obligation to comply
with federal law in order to receive
funding, but still thought the policy

or something The Stanford Daily
gives money to
Stanford, it would be really bizarre if
in exchange Stanford gave email
addresses to Yahoo recruiters," he
said, 'i don't think it makes the situ
ation qualitatively different just
because it's the federal government."
Charonis said that student infor
mation is never distributed in a list
format, except when it is distrib
uted to the military. Rather, indi
viduals seeking directory informa
tion must request information
about a particular student. Students
can control what information is
released via the privacy settings on
Axess; however, they cannot con
trol to whom the information is
released unless they block out their
information entirely.
"We're really protective and we
would only do things if [they were]
mandated by federal law," Charonis
said. "We get lots of requests for infor
mation and we say no all the time."

Flemming Rose ■lemming Rose, the cultural editor at the
Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, spoke at Cubberley Wednesday
evening. The editor was principally responsible for the publishing of the
cartoons that initiated the Islamic Prophet Muhammad cartoons contro
versy, which led to protests across the Muslim world, some of which esca
lated into violence.
Rose stated Wednesday night that commissioning the controversial
cartoons was a journalistic exercise in testing the issue of self-censorship.
He said that several examples of exercising restraint in expression
because of ethical standards in Europe convinced him that the widening
fear of intimidation when dealing with issues related to Islam was stifling
free speech.
The editor pointed out that he was in favor of complete free speech,
including removing blasphemy laws that still exist in many European
nations and removing laws that prevent people from denying the
Holocaust. However, he said that he would draw the line when it came
to material that incited violence, but not when the materials themselves
caused violence.
Rose said that he was not against any specific religion but simply those
individuals who did not accept the liberal values in Western constitutions.
