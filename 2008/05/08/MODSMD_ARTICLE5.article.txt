## Recruiters receive email addresses from Registrar 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Each quarter, the military sends information
about scholarship opportunities through email
to many students who never requested it. What
these students may not know is that, by law, the
Registrar's Office must release student names
and email addresses to military recruiters.
Because of the Solomon Amendment,
passed in 19%, institutions of higher education
that accept federal grants must also allow mili
tary recruitment on campus. Although many
schools claim the military's "Don't Ask. Don't
Tell" policy violates their anti-discriminatory
recruitment policies, the Solomon Amendment
was affirmed in a unanimous Supreme Court
decision in 2006.
In addition to allowing military recruiters on
campus, all federally funded universities,
including Stanford, are required to provide
information about students — including
addresses, telephone listings, date and place of
birth and academic majors — to the military.
"This federal law requires that once a quar
ter. if requested, each branch of the military can
ask for the names and contact information for
enrolled students, and we legally are required
to give it," said Associate University Registrar

Jackie Charon is.
The Registrar's Office makes exceptions for
students who request blocks on this informa
tion. In such cases, however, no information
about the student can be released, not even to
a prospective employer calling to confirm a stu
dent's status.
An Army recruiter, who wished to remain
anonymous due to a policy prohibiting inter
views with the press, said he and his colleagues
try to reach students at least three times each
year.
"We try to send [emails] to most of the jun
iors and seniors, usually at the beginning of the
year, the middle of the year and again at the
end of the year," he said.
The recruiter said he uses the information
given to speculate whether specific students
might be interested in the scholarships.
"The degrees don't say pre-med, pre-dental,
pre-vet. but [for] students studying, say, math or
the hard sciences, we'll email all those seniors
and juniors," he said. "We are only allowed to
send information concerning scholarships to
students. We do not 'target' students — we look
at a student's major and send information that
may be used for continuing education."
