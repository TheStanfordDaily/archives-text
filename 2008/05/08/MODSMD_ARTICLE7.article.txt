## THE
						DRAW: 
### E. BLAIR LAING 
From Bob to the 'lees,
navigating Stanford housing
can be a daunting task.
Features tells you where to
live —and where to avoid.

It's that time of the year again, the one hitch to spring
quarter: the Draw. Everywhere students are scrambling to
figure out draw groups and their housing plans for next
year. Unfortunately, the Draw isn't like class: you can work
at it all you want, hut ultimately it comes down to one ran
dom number.
DGTW€GM 1 AMD 500
For those lucky students who drew between 1 and 500.
you are practically guaranteed the best housing. If you
want a lively social scene, great food and nice rooms. Bob.
Mars, Jerry and 680 all live up to their reputations.
BOD
Most of the rooms in Bob are spacious two-room dou
bles, except for the unfortunate presence of two quads and
a quint. Bob's prime lower Row location ensures that this
house is never quiet. According to Mikayel Currim '08,
"There is usually Beirut going on three or four times a
week." and"the chef is the bomb." Good food, good social
life and big two-room doubles.

MARS
If you're afraid of getting stuck in that quint — or a
sophomore with low status in the in-house Draw — then
maybe Mars is the place for you. Here, seniority is not used
in the in-house Draw. All the rooms are one-room doubles,
though, and they vary in size from broom closet to cav
ernous. However, if you're lucky enough to end up on the
third floor, the lofted ceilings and spacious rooms are com
pletely worth it. According to fifth year co-term Lizzie
Suiter. Mars' "central staircase means that you see every
body," and there are lots of social events, creating a 'pretty
tight knit community.'" And don't worry, the cook is excel
lent and will prepare special dishes if you ask.

J€RRY
If you'd like a little more personal space, then check out
Jerry. Almost all the rooms are huge two-room doubles, al
though sophomores may end up in a triple instead. And

naturally, with its
great location —
right on Lake Lag,
next to KA — Jerry
has a thriving social
life. One caveat: the
bike uphill to get
home is grueling.
But once you're
home, "the food is
great and the chef is
amazing," says Mia
Hamamoto '10.

680
And if you want to he 'that kid,' the one who gets the
hest number and lives in the classic holy grail of houses,
you have to look into 680. 680 is right next to Theta Delt,
Kappa Sig and SAE. According to Jen Avrin '08, 680 is
"pretty loud" with lots of partying on the weekends. To top

it off, it has "the best open kitchen, the best food on cam
pus." says Avrin.
bctwccn 500 AND 1000
Now if you didn't draw under 500, don't worry: the
range between 500 and l(XX) offers excellent housing too.
There are the classics like Narnia — great rooms but a re
ally long bike ride — and Phi Sig — intimate and right
next to the row. There are some other places, though, that
might not be on your radar yet.
CHI THCTA CHI
If you're into co-ops (and you applied for priority). Chi
Theta Chi has a good location and a unique atmosphere.
With a gorgeous house just off of Mayfield. Chi Ilieta Chi
is known for hosting parties with live bands. As a co-op. all
the food preparation is allocated communally — as is the
cleaning, which can leave it a little dirty at times. According
to sophomore Ahmed Alkooheji,"a big part of the house
is being willing to take care of it." And as a house that is
"able to maintain a house identity from year to year," ac
cording to Patrick Fortune '09. it really does offer a distinc
tive environment.
GROVI€ LASUCri AMD NAYfICLD

If you want to
stay close to the
row, the Grove
houses are just a
step away from
everything. Their
situation is slightly
unique: Grove is
split into Grove La
suen and Grove
Mayfield, but you
draw into them as
one. And if you're
in a group larger
than four, your
group may be di
vided between the
two houses. The

food is decent, according to Sara Heaps' 10, who observed.
"If 1 go to dinner and 1 don't like what we're having. I'm
surprised." Heaps also said that the house is relatively
quiet, that "it's not a party house, but it's fun."
DURAMD

If you prefer a nice, newly renovated house a little fur
ther from the commotion, Durand has a gorgeous lawn and
a nice view down the hill. The house is mostly one-room
doubles of decent size, with interestingly shaped rooms
and sloped ceilings on the third floor. Holly Stebing '09
said that Durand "is pretty well known for having a social
house" despite its trek down the row, and that "the chef
makes great and unique desserts."
ZAP
And if you don't mind being surrounded by sorority
girls in the Cowell cluster. ZAP is all large two-room dou
bles. According to Max Zamkow '09,"the food is one of the
three or four best on campus," although Avrin felt that it
wasn't quite as good as the food at 680. Both, however,
agreed that there were a good number of social events at
ZAP. including lots of parties on weekends.
Dcrween 1000 and 2000
Now if you draw a preferred number higher than 1000.
the Draw becomes a bit more challenging. Most of the fa
vored housing is no longer available, so you have to figure
out where exactly your priorities lie — rooms, food, dis
tance from campus, etc. The range from 1000-2000 covers
everything from the co-ops to Lagunita to GovCo. It's all
about what you prefer.
YOff
Yost, located reasonably far down Sant'a Teresa, is the
Spanish language themed dorm in GovCo. It is made up of
mostly large one-room doubles, with a handful of two
room doubles and singles available as well. According to
Kit Garton '10,"the food is not fantastic," but fellow soph
omore Caroline Kusin said that there are amazing Indian
dinners. And this year the students living in Yost have real
ly bonded, according to both Kusin and Garton. So if you
don't mind sharing a big room (two double beds fit com
fortably in these doubles), and you're into Indian food,
Yost may be the place for you. Just make sure to rally your
friends to maintain the great atmosphere, because accord
ing to Garton. with a fun group of students," Yost is the best
place ever."
LAGUNITA

A little closer to the center of campus (but not by much)
is Lagunita. As Ashley Lohmann '10 commented, "Lag
tends to be known for its quietness." There usually isn't
much mingling between the freshmen and the upperclass-
