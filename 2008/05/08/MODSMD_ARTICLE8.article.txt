# The 						food stamp meal plan: $3 a day
## 
### STACIE CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I want to rip my stomach out. I am famished. I am rav
enous. I am STARVING. For those who know me, this is
nothing new. But this time, I actually have good reason to
be hungry.
"Today, I, Stacie Chan, pledge to live on a meal budg
et of $3 for today, May 7,2008, in order to raise awareness
for those who must endure this struggle everyday," read

my little pledge card. On the back were 12 squares, each
representing 25 cents, for a grand total of three whole dol
lars.
Three Dollars? $3 doesn't even get you a Naked Juice
at The Axe & Palm.
But this penny-pinching budget is exactly what 28 mil
lion Americans living on food stamps must survive on —
the largest number since the program began in the 19605,
according to an article by New York Times reporter Erik
Eckholm.
In an effort to raise awareness about hunger and
poverty in America, Stanford Students Taking On
Poverty (STOP) sponsored the Food Stamps Challenge
all week to show what low-income families must face
every day.
Yesterday I was joined by 200 other Stanford students
as we trekked to Old Union during lunch and dinner to
scrounge through the representative options. For lunch. I
had two pieces of white bread (25 cents) and a quarter
can of tuna (67 cents), and I splurged on one piece of sushi
(50 cents), for a total of $ 1.42. For a snack. I grabbed 2 car
rots on my way out (6.25 cents.)
Other suggested plate options included a PB&J sand

wich (75 cents), a banana (45 cents), and 24 oz. of soda (30
cents), or 2 slices of bread (25 cents), 1/8 of a can of spam
(40 cents), a slice of cheese (21 cents), and an apple (66
cents).
Or, there was the "chips and Coke" option, which Co-
Executive Director and founder of STOP, Debbie War
shawsky '08, told me she had been munching on all day.
Yum.
To assuage my stomach pains, I drank water like a
camel, but from water fountains. Bottled water would
have cost at least a dollar from my precious budget.
Aside from the hunger that consumed the majority of
my thoughts throughout the day, 1 was left alone to real
ly think about this pressing problem that exists in the
United States. It is very difficult to live off $21 a week
and not go hungry, especially when the average person is
supposed to consume around 2000 calories a day. The
plate options listed above do not allow for the suggested
caloric intake.
And this challenge was comparatively easy in contrast
to what Americans realistically must face. Food is not
neatly laid out for them at a con
venient location. With astronomi
cal gas prices, transportation costs
can detract from Americans' food
budgets. Also, STOP was kind
enough to offer food in small por
tions. At the supermarket I would
n't be allowed to crack open a jar of
jelly and ask the cashier to ring up
2 tbs. for only 25 cents. People have
to purchase the entire jar for about
$2,2/3 of a day's budget.
And for someone who desper
ately tries to maintain a certain
level of nutrition in her diet, 1 was
appalled by what i was able to af
ford for $3. Healthy food options
do not come cheap. There is no fea
sible way to maintain a basic level
of nutrition. Gone were my usual
snacks like the Kashi granola bars,
Oatnut bread and Ranch-flavored
rice crackers. All of these cost
somewhere between 2 and 3 dol
lars. I definitely would not have
been able to afford them on a $21-
per-week budget.
And 1 was thoroughly disturbed
by the lack of nutrition I had
throughout the day. I got a little pro
tein from the tuna, and some Vitamin
C from the carrots and banana, but
that was it. There were no vegetables
in sight. 1 was hesitant to get an apple,
because of its price tag of 75 cents. On
a table representative of what a
week's worth of groceries would look
like, there were simple carbohy
drates galore. For $21, you could get a
loaf of simple, white bread, 4 boxes of
pasta, a box of Easy Mac, a can of
tuna, and gallon of milk. All adding
up to little to no nutrition.
At the end of day — though I
could barely concentrate on what 1
was writing, and I eventually slept
just to end the hunger — 1 was con
tent with my experience. For me, the
most effective way to truly under
stand others' plights is to complete
ly immerse myself in a cause. 1 had
to do this for 24 hours, while there
are 28 million people who survive
on $3 a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks
out of the year. Something must be
done to make the food stamps pro
gram more realistic.
