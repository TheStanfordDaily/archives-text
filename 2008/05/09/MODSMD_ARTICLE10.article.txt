### BRIAN ANDREW STAFF WRITER 
A commemoration of the sixtieth anniver
sary of Israel's independence took place
Thursday in White Plaza, in what has become
an annual Stanford tradition.
TTie celebration was met by a small peace
ful counter-demonstration.
ITie festival, a part of Israel Pride Week,
was sponsored by Millel at Stanford, the-
Jewish Student Association and the Stanford
Israel Alliance (SIA).
Lexi Shechtel '10, co-president of the SIA
and joint organizer of Israel Pride Week, said
the event was organized to be a joyous
remembrance of Israel's independence and an
opportunity to expose the Stanford communi
ty to a side of Israel that they usually do not
see on the nightly news. Schectel said that she
and other organizers did not want the cultural
celebration to be drawn into the political rhet
oric that often clouds the region.
"On [the] Fourth of July, we don't talk
about Bush, or Republicans, or Democrats.
We celebrate America," Schectel said. "And
that's what we were trying to do [for Israel].
Ibe organizers chose to hold the event in

non-Jews in the celebration.

university such as Stanford is learn
ing about a diverse set of cultures,"
said Adina Danzig, executive direc
tor of Hillel at Stanford. "A purpose
of every cultural student group is to
celebrate that culture in an open
way and thereby enrich the universi
ty as a whole."
Thirty yards from the snaking
line for free falafel. about twenty
students held a quiet protest against
alleged human rights abuses in Israel
and the occupied territories with
signs demanding an "End to the

Apartheid." Although no student
group officially sponsored the
protest, many of the protesters were
members of student groups con
cerned with human rights in the
Middle East.
Amanda Gelender '09, co-chair
of the Jewish Committee on Human
Rights (J-COHR), said that it's
important for her as a Jew to speak
out for greater human rights in
Israel. J-COHR is a committee
under Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel (SCAI), a stu
dent group that encourages Stanford
University to divest from companies
in Israel or the occupied territories
that profit from human rights viola
tions.
"Since Israel is a Jewish state, it

supposedly speaks for our actions"
Gelender said. "Attempting to
defend the human rights abuses of
Israel undermines the roots of the
Jewish faith, tikkun olam [literally
meaning "world repair" in
Hebrew]."
SCAI held a Gaza rally and
march on Tuesday in White Plaza to
protest the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza and to repeat their call for uni
versity divestment. SCAI president
Fadi Quran '10 said that the schedul
ing of the SCAI rally during 1 lillel's
Israel week was not done on pur
pose but that it was simply the best
dav available.
