## Univ. plans new arts district Administration sketches long-term vision for new arts facilities 
### JULIANNE STERN 
This summer's White Plaza renovations will not be
the only changes to the Stanford landscape in coming
years.
Plans are shaping up to transform the area sur
rounding the Cantor Center for Visual Arts into a
diverse arts district over the next twenty to thirty years,
according to Assistant Vice President for the Arts
Karen Nagy.
The new arts district will feature a building adja
cent to the Cantor Arts Center that will house the
Department of Art and Art History and the Art and
Architecture Library, as well as a new concert hall on
the other side of Palm Drive near Frost Amphitheater.
The new art building will likely be built on the space
currently occupied by the Old Anatomy building
directly behind Cantor, according to University
Architect David Lenox.
The Cummings Art Building, a facility across from
the History Corner that currently houses the Art
Department and Art Library, will likely be demolished
to make way for a new Hoover Institution facility,
Lenox said in an email to ITie Daily.
Nagy said the Art Department's move will remedy
the severe space crunch that has confronted the
department in its current facility.
"Space has been so tight in Cummings that faculty
have been bumped out to other buildings in the Quad."

Nagy said.
"We're very much pushing out of the space we're in
already," said Kristine Samuelson, chair of the
Department of Art and Art History. "We need a lot
more room to do the many things that we do, both in the
studio and out, in classrooms and in screening rooms.
Right now we're housing three undergraduate majors,
three M.F.A. programs and a doctoral program."
The new art building, which will occupy about
90,000 square feet, "will house faculty offices, class
rooms, film screening spaces, the digital art program, all
the art studios and the art library," Nagy said.
"We want to create a research lab space for students
and researchers that offers access to digital media and
digital resources in a space that has quiet spaces and
public spaces, with a readily available and rich litera
ture collection in the stacks," said Art Librarian Peter
Blank.
Blank said that he envisioned "the kinds of spaces
that encourage people to come into the library." includ
ing multimedia seminar rooms that could be used for
student study groups or classes that want to utilize rare
archival materials.
Nagy cautioned, however, that plans for the new Art
Building were still at a very early stage. She said the
next step will be a planning process with the Art
Department "to design the academic and programmat
ic goals for the building and that'll translate into a
building program."
"It will be a central place for the Art Department
and the other things that we do." Samuelson said. .She
added that increased collaboration between the Art
Department and its new neighbor
Cantor "will surely be part of the
exciting conversations we'll have."
Lenox said in an email to The
Daily that at this point in the plan
ning process it is unclear whether
the Old Anatomy building will be
renovated or torn down to make
way for the Art Building.
"As planning progresses and the
program is solidified, we will have a
better idea of what portions of Old
Anatomy will be renovated and
what part of the project will be
housed in [a) new structure," Lenox
said.
Lenox indicated that the Old
Anatomy building would have to
be carefully studied before a deci
sion could be made.
"Typically to renovate a build
ing like Old Anatomy, one would
evaluate the structure for historical
significance, seismic, program
adaptability, sustainability and
cost," Lenox said.
The other major component of
the proposed Arts District is a new
concert hall that will house 900

seats and will be used primarily as
a music performance venue.
The concert hall will stand on
the site of the Old Gymnasium,
which was destroyed in the 1906
earthquake. The venue will face
Cantor from across Palm Drive
and will lie on an east-west axis
with the museum and the new Art
Building.
Most parties involved in the dis
cussion about the new arts district
agreed that the major buildings
would go up well within the next
decade. The concert hall would
likely open by 2012, Nagy said.
Beyond the major construction,
Nagy said, the arts district could
grow to include a diverse array of
facilities, including "a kind of con
nective path [between Cantor and
the new concert hall], maybe with
sculpture and small performance
spaces, wandering through the
Arboretum."
Additional construction of arts
facilities could be a twenty or thir
ty year plan. Nagy said.
"The idea is to try to move the
academic and smaller performance
spaces for music or drama into that
area," she said.
