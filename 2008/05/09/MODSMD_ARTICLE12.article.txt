### JULIANNE STERN 
This summer's White Plaza renovations will not be
the only changes to the Stanford landscape in coming
years.
Plans are shaping up to transform the area sur
rounding the Cantor Center for Visual Arts into a
diverse arts district over the next twenty to thirty years,
according to Assistant Vice President for the Arts
Karen Nagy.
The new arts district will feature a building adja
cent to the Cantor Arts Center that will house the
Department of Art and Art History and the Art and
Architecture Library, as well as a new concert hall on
the other side of Palm Drive near Frost Amphitheater.
The new art building will likely be built on the space
currently occupied by the Old Anatomy building
directly behind Cantor, according to University
Architect David Lenox.
The Cummings Art Building, a facility across from
the History Corner that currently houses the Art
Department and Art Library, will likely be demolished
to make way for a new Hoover Institution facility,
Lenox said in an email to ITie Daily.
Nagy said the Art Department's move will remedy
the severe space crunch that has confronted the
department in its current facility.
"Space has been so tight in Cummings that faculty
have been bumped out to other buildings in the Quad."

Nagy said.
"We're very much pushing out of the space we're in
already," said Kristine Samuelson, chair of the
Department of Art and Art History. "We need a lot
more room to do the many things that we do, both in the
studio and out, in classrooms and in screening rooms.
Right now we're housing three undergraduate majors,
three M.F.A. programs and a doctoral program."
The new art building, which will occupy about
90,000 square feet, "will house faculty offices, class
rooms, film screening spaces, the digital art program, all
the art studios and the art library," Nagy said.
"We want to create a research lab space for students
and researchers that offers access to digital media and
digital resources in a space that has quiet spaces and
public spaces, with a readily available and rich litera
ture collection in the stacks," said Art Librarian Peter
Blank.
Blank said that he envisioned "the kinds of spaces
that encourage people to come into the library." includ
ing multimedia seminar rooms that could be used for
student study groups or classes that want to utilize rare
archival materials.
Nagy cautioned, however, that plans for the new Art
Building were still at a very early stage. She said the
next step will be a planning process with the Art
Department "to design the academic and programmat
ic goals for the building and that'll translate into a
building program."
"It will be a central place for the Art Department
and the other things that we do." Samuelson said. .She
added that increased collaboration between the Art
