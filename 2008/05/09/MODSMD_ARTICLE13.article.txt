## Clinton presses on, ignores calls to quit 
### BETH FOUHY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) —
Her voice raspy her tone determined.
Hillary Rodham Clinton urged her
supporters on Thursday to ignore the
political pundits who have declared

her toast.
The former first lady raced into a
long West Virginia-to-the-West Coast
campaign day. declaring she would
move forward with her presidential
effort and insisting anew that she, not
rival Barack Obama. would be the
stronger F3emocratic candidate to

face Republican John McCain in
November.
At a rally under the dome of the
West Virginia Capitol, Clinton dis
missed calls for her to drop out as
"deja vu all over again." She said she
had faced similar pressure before
going on to win in New Hampshire,
Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania.
She made her case for pressing on.
even as she thanked her supporters
for doing the same.
"A lot of you have stuck with me;
you've been through all the ups and
downs in this campaign, the biggest
victories and toughest moments,"
Clinton said. "I think it is because you
understand that you've got to have a
president who gets up every day and
fights for you, who never gives up on
you."
Her fading chances didn't diminish
the loyalty of Evelyn Smith, 78, one of
hundreds of supporters who jammed
into the Capitol and waited nearly two
hours to hear Clinton speak.
"It's going to take a miracle for her
to get the nomination, which 1 could
sit down and cry about because 1 think
she really deserves to be president

and the first lady president," Smith
said.
Whatever the odds. Smith said
Clinton should stay in the race until
the final contests June 3. She said."l'm
a lot like she is. and 1 would go to the
finish line even if 1 came in last and
took a fall. I'd make it to the finish
line, and I think she should, too."
Jim Duffield, 64, agreed.
"We don't have a winner yet. Of
course she should keep going until we
get a winner," Duffield said.
Said Clinton as her audience
cheered: "I'm running to be president
of all 50 states. 1 think we ought to
keep this going so the people of West
Virginia's voices are heard."
In contrast to her confrontational
comments in speeches leading up to
recent primaries. Clinton's only men
tion of Obama was to say next
Tuesday's election would be a test for
both her and the Illinois senator. She
did highlight her strengths with vari
ous voting blocs through the primar
ies, an implicit comparison with her
Democratic foe. She said the states
she has won and the voters she has
attracted are essential if the party is
to heat McCain and claim the White
House.
"We need to bring back hard
working people to the Democratic
Party," the New York senator said.
"I'm winning Catholic voters and
Hispanic voters, blue-collar workers
and seniors. People Sen. McCain will
need in the general election."
She added, "Some call you swing
voters. I call you Americans."
Exit polls in Indiana and North
Carolina on Iliesday showed Clinton
continuing to dominate Obama in
attracting support from whites, par
ticularly white men, and voters who
lack college degrees. An average of
57 percent of whites have backed the
New York senator in Democratic pri
maries since Super Tuesday on Feb. 5.
West Virginia's demographic
makeup of white, older voters favors
Clinton. During her appearance
lliursday, she offered the same pop
ulist pitch she began making in the
closing days before Indiana and
North Carolina.
