CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) â€”
Her voice raspy her tone determined.
Hillary Rodham Clinton urged her
supporters on Thursday to ignore the
political pundits who have declared

her toast.
The former first lady raced into a
long West Virginia-to-the-West Coast
campaign day. declaring she would
move forward with her presidential
effort and insisting anew that she, not
rival Barack Obama. would be the
stronger F3emocratic candidate to

face Republican John McCain in
November.
At a rally under the dome of the
West Virginia Capitol, Clinton dis
missed calls for her to drop out as
"deja vu all over again." She said she
had faced similar pressure before
going on to win in New Hampshire,
Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania.
She made her case for pressing on.
even as she thanked her supporters
for doing the same.
"A lot of you have stuck with me;
you've been through all the ups and

Clinton said. "I think it is because you

she really deserves to be president

and the first lady president," Smith

line, and I think she should, too."
Jim Duffield, 64, agreed.
"We don't have a winner yet. Of

get a winner," Duffield said.
Said Clinton as her audience

keep this going so the people of West

In contrast to her confrontational
comments in speeches leading up to
recent primaries. Clinton's only men

Tuesday's election would be a test for
both her and the Illinois senator. She
did highlight her strengths with vari
