### ALLISON HOFFMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN DIEGO (AP) —The
suspected leader of a drug traf
ficking ring was among seven
students who pleaded not guilty
Thursday to charges stemming
from an undercover operation at
San Diego State University that
netted more than 100 arrests.
Kenneth Ciaccio, an honors
student at the 34,000-student
school, is accused of selling
cocaine twice to government
agents. He faces up to six years
and four months in prison in
convicted.
"Ciaccio was identified early
as a main source." Deputy
District Attorney Shawn
lafreshi said during the court
hearing.
Ciaccio and six others plead
ed not guilty to selling an array
of drugs including marijuana.
Ecstasy, hallucinogenic mush
rooms and cocaine. All but one
remained in custody in lieu on
bonds ranging from $10,000 to
$ 150.0(H) for Ciaccio.
Ciaccio. 19, was among 13 fra
ternity members arrested in
morning raids TUesday at nine
locations near the university,
including fraternity houses and
off-campus housing. University
officials said 33 students have
been suspended as a result of the
busts.
Ciaccio's lawyer. Michael
Messina, said he had not seen
any evidence proving that his
client was at the center of the
ring purportedly operating out
of the rundown Theta Chi frater
nity house, a block off Fraternity
Row.

"1 do not believe he's the
main guy," Messina said after the
court hearing.
Campus police asked under
cover federal agents for help
infiltrating the university's drug
scene after the cocaine overdose
death of a freshman sorority
member in May 2007.
Authorities said they ultimately
targeted an array of overlapping
drug networks, some operating
out of fraternities.
Federal officials said 128 peo
ple, including at least 75 univer
sity students, were arrested dur
ing the five-month investigation.
That figure includes students
detained for minor drug offenses
or other infractions turned
informants for federal agents in
the probe.
Tafreshi said Ciaccio bragged
to undercover agents that he
could procure a quarter-pound
of the drug for $2,300. According
to court papers, he sent a mass
text message to clients advertis
ing cut-rate specials before leav
ing town for the weekend.
A 21-year-old member of
Delta Sigma Pi fraternity sus
pected of dealing drugs, includ
ing Ecstasy, from a university
parking lot across the street
from Fraternity Row was
ordered held in lieu of $25,000
bond. According to court papers,
Thomas Watanapun made no
effort to conceal the cash he
made from dealing, driving
directly from one deal to a bank
to deposit $400.
"It's a matter where, due to
peer pressure and poor judg
ment, he finds himself in this
predicament," said attorney
Nathan Acuilar in court.
