## Editorial Board Consider limiting wireless access in class 
### 
In his spring letter to alumni. University
of Chicago Law School Dean Saul Lev
more made quite an interesting and
bold announcement. In between construc
tion updates and faculty change notifica
tions. Dean Levmore announced that.start
ing this quarter, he would be shutting off all
wireless and wired Internet connections, in
cluding cell phones with Internet access, in
the Chicago Law School's classroom wing.
While our initial reaction as students
may be one of outrage or righteous indig
nation, few among us can deny having drift
ed off to the whimsical land of the World
Wide Web while fighting to stay awake in
an early morning I HUM lecture. Dean Lev
more admits this weakness himself, saying
that he too has caught himself glancing
under the table at his Blackberry during
staff meetings, something that brought
around an assessment of his university's
policy concerning the issue.
Chicago is not the first school to imple
ment this measure — numerous other law
schools, along with other graduate and un
dergraduate programs, have taken steps to
block Internet access in classrooms. There
are already some Teaching Assistants and
professors at Stanford that have a "no lap
top" policy in their classes. Perhaps taking
campus-wide action would not be such a
bad idea here, but it would require careful
deliberation.
In today's hyper-connected world there
is never a shortage of tasks, obligations,
commitments or distractions available.
From looking at finances to re-organizing
Facebook groups, one can always find
something to do online. Now. with the intro
duction of more Internet-capable phones
into the general population, drifting away
has never been easier. A simple click or a
quick button press, and the lecture hall
fades away and the clock speeds up — who
could ask for more? But how often do we
stop to consider the negative effects of such
voluntary distractions?
Surfing the Web during class is not a vic
timless crime: beyond the more immediate
personal distractions, people who browse
the Internet during class can also be a dis
traction to those sitting around them with
out computers. It becomes exponentially

more difficult to pay attention to the pro
fessor when one has a smorgasbord of com
puter screens to view in the surrounding
seats.Turning to the left and reading the lat
est F.SPN Draft article or tilting to the right
and watching You Tube videos makes focus
ing on your trusty pen and paper just that
much more difficult; the externalities of In
ternet usage in class are a very important
consideration.
There is no denying that computers are
an integral part of the modern collegiate
education process. From note taking to
presentation making, a laptop or desktop is
absolutely indispensable in college. We
don't believe anyone would rationally be
calling for the banning of computers from
classrooms. The Internet, on the other
hand, is an entirely different animal. There
are. of course, always exceptions. Some
times one needs to be both at a review ses
sion and writing a letter to a family member
or an employer. For many a busy Stanford
student, multi-tasking has become second
nature. But just because it is "normal" does
not make it a good idea.
Going to class without paying attention
seems, at best, a little counter-productive.
Are we really paying $30,000 plus in tuition
fees annually in order to browse Facebook
or write emails to our high school friends?
Perhaps we do need a little more policing in
order to, as Dean Levmore phrased it in his
letter, "protect us from ourselves."
The discussion of Internet usage and in
class distractions is a very pertinent topic.
While the Editorial Board doesn't believe
that completely cutting off the Internet is
the best possible answer, we do believe that
everyone should be made more aware of
the potential negative effects of constantly
browsing the Internet during class.
We at Stanford believe in freedom of
choice and allowing individuals to make
the decisions they feel are best. This free
dom. however, does not mean keeping
quiet about potentially harmful choices or
habits. Next time you have the temptation
to click away your lecture boredom, con
sider that perhaps what the Professor is
saying has been included in class for a rea
son and try to hold off on that very tempt
ing escape.
