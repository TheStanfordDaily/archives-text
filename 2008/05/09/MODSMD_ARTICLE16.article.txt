## ASSU chooses new chairs 
### 
This story urn inspired Iry the Wednesday Daily
story of the some name
At Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, the Ninth Under
graduate Senate wrapped up its term
and incoming senators selected a new Sen
ate Chair and Deputy Chair. During a five
hour long meeting, Barca Lounger and Ikea
Swivel won out against last year's Laz-E Boy
and Love Seat in an 8-7 vote.
The room was a flurry of catalogue rifling
and tensions were high. This year's choices
were pivotal ones, as many current senators
voiced disapproval with last year's chairs.
One senator perhaps spoke to the mood of
the room when he noted that he felt "un
comfortable" with the older chairs and that
they didn't provide enough backing for the
key initiatives he wanted to put forth.These
initiatives have included H.R. 245, the Sen
ate Rocking, Leaning Back and Rolling pro
posal of 2007, a bill that he himself authored.
Others were quite satisfied with the old
chairs. "I think for the purposes of institu
tional memory, these chairs are a vital part of
our senatorial makeup," one senator said. "I
think what I'm trying to say is that they're
not a pain in the ass like the other options
we've got going for us."
The chairs are responsible for upholding
a high standard of integrity and dignity, as
well as a weight roughly equal to a maximum
of 300 pounds. Their duties consist of sitting
for long periods of time and doing nothing
exceptional.
A third senator was concerned with the
character traits of the vying chairs: "We've
got to sec what they're made of. be it poly
ester, vinyl or leather. We need to see how
they will stand up under pressure. All of the
candidates bring a lot to the table, but some
are sturdier and more reliable than others."
After a period of discussion, the first
round of voting was conducted. Predictably,
this vote was split along partisan lines.
Frustrated that the Senate had spent two
hours in discussion, the self-appointed Stu
dent Ciovernment Secretary of Interior Dec

oration voiced his disapproval. A respected
member of the Senate thanks to his cam
paign video from last year in which he put
his face onto the body of Oueen Latifah in
Hairspray, he noted "We need to break
through all this partisan bickering and find a
chair that we're all happy with."
The secretary proceeded to give a de
tailed Powerpoint presentation that he had
created on the benefits and drawbacks of
rolling chairs. His presentation included the
data from a survey he had created and
emailed out to the student body asking what
they looked for in a chair, to which the num
ber one response was "no opinion."
"From my thorough analysis," the secre
tary concluded, "I think they're fun to roll
around on and you can do that thing where
you joust while holding brooms. And I think
a large part of the student body agrees with
me, though they didn't say so outright."
The second, third and fourth rounds of
voting turned out exactly the same as the
first, continuing to be directly split on parti
san lines. On the fifth round, candidate
Barca Lounger won out over Laz-e-Boy
when a previously undecided senator was
swayed by the high quality, one-piece con
struction, easy to operate, three-position
lounger, distinctive Bustle Back Charles of
London Arm, and decorative nail head trim
of the prospective senator.
When asked to comment on the results of
this election, the winning senator, had one
thine to say:"Holy Cow."

Nat would like to once again emphasize the
comfort and affordahility of the barcalounger
chair. He hopes it will serve the new round of
senators well. Email him with complaints at
