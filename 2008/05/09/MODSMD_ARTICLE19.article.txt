## Music today: worse or much worse? 
### 
There comes a time in life when one
reminisces about the past and disap
proves of the present. Music, being so
embedded in our lives and memories, is fre
quently the subject of this reminiscing/disap
proving phenomenon. Usually this phenom
enon arises when one is well past 30.The fact
that I'm 23 and already reminiscing leaves
me worried that I'm becoming a conserva
tive old fogey, condemning everything made
after a certain point in time.
Yet I feel I have good cause for concern
about music today. I think most people
would agree that the 90s and early 00s were a
golden era for music. We rocked out to amaz
ing bands like Sublime, Nirvana and Smash
ing Pumpkins and bobbed our heads to the
addictive sounds of Dre, Snoop, lupac and
Biggie. And this is just a sampling of the leg
endary music produced during this era.
Up until 2007. great music was still pro
duced — though I'd say it still pales in com
parison to the 90s. I think the true value of
this era is its emphasis on danceable music
with faster paces and more catchy beats, like
Lil Jon's "Window to the Wall" or Justin Tim
berlake's"Sexyback."Timbaland's"The Way
I Are" marked the peak of the second era,
after which we descended into this current
music era.
I can't even identify an average song from
today's music since most blend away into
background noise. Sean Kingston, for exam
ple, who isn't even the worst of the bunch,
sounds like a Jamaican version of a mono
tone, robotic-voiced text-to-speech comput
er programs. Lyrics have taken a nose-dive,
too. Now. I think main role of lyrics is to chan
nel the overall musicality of a song — I 'd find
it difficult to find someone whose music se
lection was based on lyrics rather than musi
cal qualities.That being said, however, I real

ly do feel like stopping the music when I hear
"Please don't stop the music" repeated a
thousand times. Flo Rida's "Low", whose
main chorus is "She hit the floor, next thing
you know, Shawty got low, low, low. low. low.
low. low," always gets me thinking, "So?" If I
called up a friend and told him "Yea man, I
was at this club, and there was this girl, and

she got really, really low!" he would slap me
in the face.
Maybe it's natural to write off music out
side of one's formative years. After all, our
grandparent's generation wrote off great
rock'n'roll as noise pollution. But, it seems
good music only comes around every other
era. Although the 90s and early 2000s were
great, we could live without the 80s (exempt
ing Prince and MJ, of course.) The 70s were
amazing,but the 60s needed some work. And
so here we are today, in the cycle of another
lackluster era of music. From what I've
heard, we've got another long 10 years ahead
of us.
