NOTES: No. 4 Stanford begins a three-game
series with Cal today as it looks to hold onto
its first place standing in the Pac-10. After
being ranked as high as third in the nation,
the Cardinal has struggled a bit recently,
dropping four of its last seven games. Stan
ford and Cal have met twice this season —
Cal won the first meeting, 8-3, while the sec
ond meeting resulted in a 5-5 tie after 13 in
nings of play.

Stanford will take on Cal this weekend at
Sunken Diamond, as the No. 6 Cardinal hosts
its last home series of the season.
The Cardinal (28-16-2,10-5 Pac-10) was on
a tear throughout April but could not close the
month well, dropping three straight games, all
to weaker opponents. Stanford turned it
around at the beginning of May, winning its
first three games, but their latest contest was a
13-9 defeat at the hands of San Francisco,
where the Dons scored seven runs in the fourth
inning to take a commanding lead they would
not relinquish.

The score is indicative of where the Cardi
nal is as a team: the offensive firepower is al
most always there but the pitching — while
certainly better than in years past — has a ten
dency to be sporadic.
This cannot be the case against a potent Cal
offense, which has propelled the Golden Bears
(30-15-2,9-9 Pac-10) to a No. 16 national rank
ing. Their latest victory was a 13-4 drubbing of
UC-Davis, a team Stanford has lost to twice
this year.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess, in an inter
view with GoStanford.com, was quick to ac
knowledge Cal's strengths.
"Cal is a premiere team in this league," he
said. "[They] have unbelievable power in their

lineup."
Indeed, Cal is second in the Pac-10 — be
hind Arizona State — in homeruns, with 65,
and batting average, at .314. Stanford, by con
trast, stands at 49 and .304, respectively.
It adds up to a difficult situation for the
Stanford pitching staff, but they'll roll out some
of their best arms against the Golden Bears.
Junior Austin Yount, who held USC score
less through seven and a third innings two
weeks ago — following the performance up
with a seven-inning, four-hit, one-run perform
ance against San Jose State last weekend —
will take the mound for the Cardinal tonight.
Yount, a converted infielder, has been a wel
come surprise for Stanford. Staff ace senior

Erik Davis, who will pitch on Saturday, will fol
low him. The ever-consistent sophomore Jef
frey Inman will take to the rubber on Sunday.
Marquess was complimentary of his pitch
ers and pointed to Davis's performance in par
ticular as being one of the main reasons behind
the Cardinal's success.
"We have really had great contributions
from a lot of pitchers," he said. "Erik Davis
though has really stepped up and has had a
phenomenal year for us."
ITie pitchers will have a hot offense to back
them up.
Junior Sean Ratliff, who was in a slump

through most of April, has come alive
over the past few games, hitting four
homeruns in his last three games.
Fellow juniors Cord Phelps, Brent
Millville and Jason Castro< —as well as
senior Randy Molina — help form one
of college baseball's best lineups, which
has carried the Cardinal throughout the
year.
"We have hit the ball hard and been
able to put up a lot of extra base hits,
which has really helped us," said Mar
quess.
But they'll be matched by Cal's stars,
the best of whom are senior second
baseman Josh Satin and junior first
baseman David Cooper. Satin has put
together a phenomenal season: he's bat
ting over .400 and has 16 homeruns and
49 RBIs. Cooper leads the Golden
Bears with 19 dingers.
Stanford will also likely face off
against one of the west coast's best
hurlers, Tyson Ross, who owns a 7-2
record and the high praise of Marquess.
"'They have one of the best pitchers
in the country in 'tyson Ross," he said.
Cal and Stanford have already met
twice this season. In March, the Golden
Bears downed the Cardinal, 8-3, on a
rare off-night for the Stanford offense.
In a wild, early April, non-conference
game, the two teams tied in 13 innings at
five runs apiece, as Marquess
went through ten pitchers before the
game was called because of darkness.
If anything, both teams match up
well against each other, which should
make for an entertaining series between
the two rivals.
"The rivalry is always healthy as it is
with many of the sports we have here.
California is a very good team and has
always been a good program and they
will be tough to beat this weekend," said
Marquess."They have been playing well
and we will have to play well this week
end."

five runs apiece, as Marquess
went through ten pitchers before the
game was called because of darkness.
If anything, both teams match up
well against each other, which should
make for an entertaining series between
the two rivals.
"The rivalry is always healthy as it is
with many of the sports we have here.
California is a very good team and has
always been a good program and they
will be tough to beat this weekend," said
Marquess."They have been playing well
and we will have to play well this week
end."
