Lake Lag and its dam
The May 5, 2008 article on endangered
salamanders contained information about
Lagunita and its dam that needs clarifica
tion. Lagunita is a storm water collection
basin for foothills runoff.That function and
the resulting water containment is what at
tracts salamanders to breed there. The dam
is considered safe for water containment of
these runoff flows up to several feet above
the current water surface elevation to the
level of the dam's spillway, which is located
south of the Driving Range.The California
Department of Water Resources Division
of Safety of Dams inspects it annually.
Their inspections cover the condition of
the dam itself and its major components, as

well as its operation and maintenance pro
cedures.
In years when winter rains have partially
filled Lagunita and salamanders have been
attracted to it for breeding, we supplement
runoff to Lagunita with lake water from our
creeks and lakes in order to sustain them,
particularly when spring rains are not ade
quate. Lagunita's water percolates into the
ground rapidly, recharging groundwater, so
we do not routinely fill it to the brim because
of water conservation reasons. We rely on the
water we store in Felt and Searsville Lakes
for the summer's irrigation supply.
