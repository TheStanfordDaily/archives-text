The No. 22 Stanford men's tennis squad makes its return to the NCAA tournament this weekend, where the team will face UC-Santa Barbara in the first round of play.
Cardinal has won the title a record
17 times. Stanford teams in the past
have been able to make deep runs
into the tournament,something that
this year's team thinks it can do as
well.
"We were at Pepperdine in [the
2005 NCAA tournament],"
Whitlinger said, referring to Stan
ford's second round loss to the
Waves that year. "Hopefully we can
change that up a little bit this year,"
he said.
Stanford will be led into Malibu,
Calif, by freshman Alex Clayton,
who is ranked seventh in the nation.
Junior Matt Bruch and sophomore
Richard Wire. Stanford's other
ranked players, will likely join him at
the top of the singles lineup.
Last time Stanford was in the
NCAA tournament, the team made
a run to the quarterfinals only to be
ousted by Baylor in an emotionally
intense six-hour long match. Bruch,
Muller, junior Jeff Zeller and senior
Phil Kao were all on that team and
hope that this year brings something
different.
If the Card can win two this
weekend, they will be headed to
Tulsa. Okla. for the Round of 16
hosted by Tulsa University. A possi
ble match-up with fourth-seeded
Georgia looms if Stanford wants to
achieve its highest NCAA finish
since 2003.
"We are looking forward to
being in the NCAAs again after not
qualifying last year," said
Whitlinger. "Everyone is excited to
get going on Saturday."
The Cardinal begins play at 2
p.m. in Malibu on the Pepperdine
campus. If Stanford moves on, it will
play on Sunday at 1 p.m.
