### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two Stanford record holders in
the multi-events, senior Josh Hustedt
and junior Lauren Stewart, join a
team of other Stanford multi-event
athletes in heading off to Tempe,
Ariz, this weekend for the Pac-10
Multi Championships.
Hustedt holds the school record
in the men's heptathlon with a score
of 5,359 points, while Stewart holds
the school record for the female's
pentathlon with a score of 3,788
points. Both records were set in 2006.
Hustedt, from Utah, will compete in
the decathlon this weekend, for
which he is currently ranked third in
the Pac-10. Stewart, from Tennessee,
will compete in the heptathlon this
weekend; Stewart is ranked fourth in
the Pac-10.
Track multi-events, like Hustedt
and Stewart,have a long and glorious
history. When Jim Thorpe won the
decathlon in the Stockholm
Olympics of 1912. the King of Swe
den named Thorpe the "World's
Greatest Athlete." Indeed, the event
tests an individual's speed, strength,
skill, endurance and mental tough
ness. The demanding and tasking
event allows little rest, as several dif
ferent athletic abilities are called
upon.
Hustedt had a successful fresh
man year at Stanford in 2003, record
ing some of the team's best times,
throws and jumps throughout the
season. After spending two years on
a Mormon mission, Hustedt re
turned in 2006 as a sophomore, and
went on to place fourth in the de
cathlon at Pac-10 Championships.
He also recorded several top marks

"[Multi-event
athletes] like
Hustedt and
Stewart have a
long and glorious
history."

during that year, along with being the
top long jumper for the Cardinal.
Hustedt's highest level of success
thus far has come this year — he
placed second in the heptathlon at
the NCAA Championships, scoring
5,836 points.
Hustedt was named an All-Amer
ican after his second place finish,
marking the second time that he re
ceived such honors. This weekend,
he'll look to make his mark at Pac
10s, improving his current score
while also adequately preparing
himself for the NCAA Champi

unships in June.
Stewart also had an incredibly
successful freshman year on the
Farm, setting a freshman record in
the heptathlon at Pac-10 Champi
onships. She broke the school record
in the pentathlon and contributed as
a 100-meter hurdler and high jump
ing for the Cardinal. In her sopho
more year. Stewart finished fifth in
the pentathlon at the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF) In
door Championships. This year has
already proved successful for Stew
art, who has numerous top finishes in
the event.
Other Stanford athletes compet
ing this weekend include sophomore
Kara Bennett and freshman Whitney
Liehr. Bennett placed twelfth in the
heptathlon at Pac-lOs last year with a
career best of 4.41b points, while
Liehr came in third at the California
Invitational Heptathlon earlier this
season, with a personal best score of
5.126 points. Liehr has also had sev
eral individual event wins this year.
Lexie Spiranac. another freshman,
will also be competing. Joining
Hustedt for the men will be freshman
Corey Dysick. who has already made
his mark on the Farm this year. The
2007 Arizona decathlon champion,
Dysick is certainly a notable athlete
in the event.
The small contingent of Stanford
multi-event athletes hope to run,
jump and throw their way to victory
this weekend. Following their outing
this weekend, the rest of the Stanford
track and field team will head to
Tempe, Ariz, next weekend for the
general Pac-10 Championships.
