## Brand puts emphasis on scholastics

INDIANAPOLIS — NCAA president Myles
Brand wants college teams concerned as much
about academic scores as final scores. If they aren't,
they might be barred from NCAA tournaments.
Brand warned the underachievers Tuesday they
could get hit with the NCAA's harshest sanctions —
fewer scholarships, reductions in practice and even a
postseason ban. Nearly 150 teams face potential
scholarship losses and another 26 are on the brink of
a postseason ban because of poor academics.
"Academic reform is here to stay, and those
penalties resemble what we give for major infrac
tions. So these are serious penalties and there are a
number of teams that received those," Brand said
after releasing this year's Academic Progress Re
port. "Yes, there are individual institutions who have
seen a steady decline (academically) over the last
four years, and for them, the situation is dire."
Brand was mostly pleased with what he saw in
the report.
Overall scores improved by four points since the
NCAA began collecting data in 2003. Scores are also
up in 26 of 29 sports over the last four years, and
fewer teams were penalized than even NCAA offi
cials expected last year. One reason was the substan
tial academic improvement made by baseball and
football players. Those sports increased their aver
age scores by 12 and 11 points since 2003, respective
ly, which equate to graduation rates in the mid 60s.
There was plenty of reason for concern, too.
More than 700 of the 6,272 Division 1 teams fell
short of the mandated cut score of 925 to avoid
penalties, and 218 were assessed punishments rang
ing from warning letters to reductions in practice
times. Some were granted waivers while others
showed enough improvement to avoid penalties.
But the 26 teams that have now scored less than
900 in two consecutive years must improve now. A
third consecutive score below 900 would keep them
out of NCAA tournaments 2009-10, and a fourth
straight year on the list could lead to having Division
