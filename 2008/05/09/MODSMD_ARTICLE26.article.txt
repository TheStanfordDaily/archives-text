## OFF-CAMPUS Olympic flame summits Mount Everest 
### TINI TRAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BEIJING (AP â€” Cheering mountaineers raised
the Olympic torch at the summit of the world's
highest peak Thursday, producing the triumphant
image that China has longed for in the run-up to
the Beijing Olympics.
The final ascent along Mount Everest's icy
ridge was broadcast live and provided organizers
with a dramatic counterpoint to the pro-Tibet
protests that marked parts of the torch's interna
tional relay.
"One World, One Dream," team captain
Nyima Cering, a Tibetan, yelled in English as his
torch was lit a few yards from the summit - the slo
gan for the Beijing Olympics in August.
The 19-member team, dressed in red parkas
emblazoned with Olympic logos, broke camp at
27,390 feet before dawn and reached the top of
the 29,035-foot mountain a little more than six
hours later.
The flame was passed up a line of five torch
bearers to a Tibetan woman named Cering Wang
mo on the summit. The other team members un
furled Chinese and Olympic flags as a Tibetan
prayer flag lined the path and fluttered in the

wind.
The jubilant group clustered together, shout
ing in Chinese "We made it,"and "Beijing wel
comes you."
The emotional moment, shown on national
TV, displayed teamwork and national pride
among the Tibetan and ethnic Han Chinese
mountaineers - and none of the anti-government
sentiment or ethnic tensions that fueled recent
protests in Lhasa and other Tibetan areas of west
ern China.
China Vice President Xi Jinping hailed the
feat as "one of the greatest events in the history of
Olympic Games and a precious gift given by the
Chinese to the Olympics and people worldwide,"
in comments carried by the official Xinhua News
Agency.
The Everest torch was separate from the main
Olympic flame, which on Thursday was on the op
posite side of China, in the southeastern province
of Guangdong.
China had planned for the Beijing Olympics to
be a showcase of its rapid development from im
poverished agrarian nation to rising industrial
power.
Its preparations have been meticulous: build
ing glittering new venues, modernizing Beijing

and even ordering residents to stop bad behavior
like spitting, littering and jumping in line.
But taking the torch to the top of Everest had
been criticized from the outset because of China's
often harsh rule over Tibet - where Everest is lo
cated on the border with Nepal - and the torch
relay drew even more intense scrutiny after re
cent unrest in Tibet and Tibetan areas of western
China.
Tibetan activists continued to accuse Beijing
of using the climb to symbolize its control over
Tibet. China says it has ruled Tibet for centuries,
although many Tibetans say their homeland was
essentially independent for much of that time.
"The Chinese government's obsession with
summiting Everest with the Olympic torch be
trays the depth of its insecurity over its rule in
Tibet which was so clearly challenged by Tibetans
in March and April,"Tenzin Dorjee, deputy direc
tor of Students for a Free Tibet, said in a state
ment.
Chinese officials and state media have tried to
depict the climb as a demonstration of the
Olympic spirit.
