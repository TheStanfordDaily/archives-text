## Environmentalists, owners reach land deal 
### NOAKI SCHWARTZ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LEBEC, Calif — A group of envi
ronmentalists and the owners of a
large stretch of wilderness have
reached a deal that would set aside
the largest parcel of land for conser
vation in California history.
After years of legal tussles, con
servationists including the Sierra
Club have agreed not to challenge
proposed development on the
sprawling Tejon Ranch north of Los
Angeles in exchange for close to
240,(KX) acres, in a deal announced
Thursday by officials including Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
At 375 square miles, the preserve
of desert, woodlands and grasslands
would be eight times the size of San
Francisco and nearly the size of Los
Angeles,said Bill Corcoran, the Sierra
Club's senior regional representative.
"There is, in my opinion, no other
place like it in California - it's unri
valed in the diversity of native
wildlife and plants," said Corcoran,
who helped negotiate the deal.
"Tejon is key to us because it's the
only place where the Sierra

Nevadas, the coastal range and Mo
jave Desert and Central Valley all
meet."
Tejon Ranch sits atop the
Tehachapi Mountains 60 miles north
of Los Angeles and is home to elk,
wild turkeys, coyotes, bears and ea
gles, as well as a critical habitat for
condors.
The Tejon Ranch Co. has been
trying for years to develop three
projects, or 10 percent of the 270.000
acre ranch, while appeasing environ
mentalists.
The other groups that have
signed on are the Natural Resources
Defense Council, Audubon Califor
nia, Planning and Conservation
League and Endangered Habitats
League.
In 2005, the company and a na
tional land trust hailed an agreement
to sell more than one-third of the
ranch for use as a nature preserve.
That agreement, however, failed to
satisfy the Tejon Natural Heritage
Park Committee, a coalition of 12
conservation groups.
I>ess than a year later, another
promising agreement fell through,
llie developer promised to set aside

100,000 acres as a natural preserve
but environmentalists wanted more
than double that size.
At the time. Sierra Club execu
tive director Carl Pope and other en
vironmental leaders said they would
make the Tejv>n Ranch their top pri
ority in California. Conservationists
threatened to unite and file a lawsuit
against the developer under the fed
eral Endangered Species Act.
Instead they went back to the ne
gotiating table.
"After nearly two years of negoti
ations, which were often difficult but
always in good faith, we have
achieved an unprecedented agree
ment protecting close to 90 percent
of the ranch." Corcoran said.
At least one front remained, how
ever. The Center for Biological Di
versity. which walked away from the
talks in 2007, denounced the pact on
grounds it allows for the largest de
velopment ever proposed in the
state and would harm the population
of the endangered California con
dor.
"On paper the deal sounds good,
but a close examination shows that
very little is gained biologically and

far too much is sacrificed," Peter
Galvin. the group's conservation di
rector, said in a statement.
The Tejon Ranch Co. is dedicat
ing 178,000 acres and about 62,000
will he purchased in part with state
conservation bond money. While it is
not clear how much the land will
cost, the developer agreed to a state
appraisal.
An independent conservancy will
be set up to manage the land and the
developer has agreed to donate
some money for its upkeep, Corco
ran said.The agreement also seeks to
establish a large state park that will
be open to the public.
"in my opinion it's a near certain
ty that California will never again
see a private land conservation
agreement of this size and ecological
importance," Corcoran said.
