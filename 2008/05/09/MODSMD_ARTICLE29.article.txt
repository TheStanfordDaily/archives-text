## Facebook, states set bullying, predator safeguards

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) â€”
Facebook, the world's second
largest social .networking Web
site, is adding more than 40 new
safeguards to protect young users
from sexual predators and cyber
bullies under an agreement with
officials nationwide that was an
nounced Thursday.
The measures include
banning convicted sex offenders
from the site, limiting older users'
ability to contact subscribers
under 18 and participating in a
task force set up in January to find
ways to verify users' ages and
identities.
"The agreement marks anoth
er watershed step toward social
networking safety, protecting kids
from online predators and inap
propriate content," said Con
necticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal, who an
nounced the agreement Thursday
with his counterparts in other
states.
Officials from Washington,
D.C., and 49 states have signed
on.
Facebook, which has more
than 70 million active users
worldwide, already has enacted
many of the changes and others
are in the works, its officials said
Thursday.
"Building a safe and trusted
online experience has been part
of Facebook from its outset," said
Chris Kelly, Facebook's chief pri
vacy officer."The attorneys gen
eral have shown great leadership
in helping to address the critical
issue of Internet safety, and we
commend them for continuing to
set high standards for all players
in the online arena."
Texas did not endorse the
agreement or a similar one
reached in January among the
other states, the District of Co
lumbia and MySpace, the world's
largest online social network with

200 million users worldwide.
Texas officials say they want
the sites to work faster on verify
ing users' ages and identities.
The attorneys general have
been negotiating for months with
Palo Alto, Calif.-based Facebook.
"Social networks that encour
age kids to come to their sites
have a responsibility to keep
those kids safe," North Carolina
Attorney General Roy Cooper
said. "We've now gotten the two
largest social-networking sites to
agree to take significant steps to
protect children from predators
and pornography."
MySpace, Facebook and other
online networks have created a
new venue where sexual predators
could lie about their age to lure
young victims to chat, share im
ages and sometimes meet in per
son, law enforcement officials said.
The networks also have em
powered cyberbullies, who have
sent threatening and anonymous
messages to classmates, acquain
tances and other users.
John Palfrey, executive direc
tor of the Berkman Center for In
ternet and Society at Harvard
University, said research shows
online bullies are far more com
mon than sexual predators.
"It's very rare for an adult to
meet a child on a social network
and to do them harm, although
the ones that do occur get a huge
amount of attention, and they are
terrible," he said.
Online bullying, whether
through instant-message pro
grams or social networks, is on the
rise, he said.
The issue has gained national
attention after recent high-profile
cases, including the 2006 suicide
of a 13-year-old Missouri girl who
was victimized by an Internet
ruse. Megan Meier hanged her
self after receiving nasty online
comments from a MySpace friend
who turned out to be fictional, in
vented by two acquaintances and
the mother of one of those girls.
