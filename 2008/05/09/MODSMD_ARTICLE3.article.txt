In a dominating season
with a 25-4 record, tourna
ment play seems to be the
only thing that has caused
heartbreak for the Stanford
women's water polo team.
The Cardinal dropped a
5-4 decision to USC in the
group stages of the Stanford
Invitational back in early

February, keeping the Card out of the championship match. A few
weeks later, the team made it to the championship game of the Irvine
Tournament,only to lose 8-7 in sudden-death overtime to UCLA. Fi
nally, two weeks ago in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) conference tournament, the team once again fell 5-4 to
USC, this time in overtime of the semifinals.
So as the NCAA championships kick off at Stanford's home pool
in the Avery Aquatic Center this afternoon, the Card hopes that the
fourth time will be the charm in its search for a national title this sea
son.
As the No. 2 seed in the eight-team tournament, Stanford will face
off with No. 7 seed Marist in the first round.The Red Foxes — whose
home pool resides in Poughkeepsie, New York — won their confer
ence championship in dramatic fashion to earn their tournament
berth, beating Siena in double overtime in the semifinals and then
winning a 7-6 thriller against lona in the conference championship

£ame.
Despite the fact that they are not
nationally ranked — although they
did receive votes for the top-20 —
Marist still boasts a 27-7 record overall.
And although Marist only shared two
regular season opponents with Stan
ford — Brown and Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps — the Red Foxes beat them
both.The Cardinal will still be expect
ed to advance to the second round, but
Marist will not be a pushover.
If Stanford does get by Marist. the
team will face the winner of the
match-up between third-seeded USC
and sixth-seeded Michigan. Michi
gan, ranked No. 10 in the country,
swept through the CWPA conference
championships two weeks ago to run
its record to an impressive 33-9. The
Wolverines played a tough non-con
ference schedule this year.and almost
all of their losses came early in the
year against MPSF opponents —in
fact, the squad has been undefeated
since losing to San Diego State back
on Feb. 23. Michigan is on an astound
ing 27-game winning streak.
Even with Michigan's hot form,
though, the fact still remains that
USC beat the Wolverines handily a
few months ago, 15-7. The Women of
Troy have been a mainstay in the top
three all season, and if they go
through to the semifinals they will
likely meet Stanford for the fifth time
this season.
Under normal circumstances,
playing one team five times in a
roughly 30-game season could get
fairly boring, but Stanford and USC
have produced instant classics in each
of the games they have played this
season. All four matches have been
decided by one goal — with each
team winning two — and three of the
matches have gone into overtime.
With the stakes now at their highest,
another thriller can be expected if the

No. 2 and No. 3 teams in the country
square off again.
On the other side of the bracket,
No. 1 UCLA will be playing No. 8
Pomona-Pitzer and No. 4 San Diego
State will match up with No. 5 seed
UC-Davis. While anything can hap
pen m a tournament, it would take a
very brave soul to bet against UCLA
making it to the championship game.
The Bruins have yet to lose this
season — not counting a 6-5 exhibi
tion loss to the U.S. National team —
and it would be an enormous upset if
they were to fall in one of the first two
rounds. Even fourth-seeded San
Diego State, who compiled a 29-6
record on the year, was beaten by
twelve goals. 17-5, after facing UCLA
earlier this season.
IT\at's not to say that UCLA is a
lock for the title, though — both
Stanford and USC have proven that
they can play right with the Bruins.
USC has met UCLA three times this
year.and after losing the first meeting
8-4. the Trojans lost the second and
third by only a goal each. As for Stan
ford. the Cardinal dropped a sudden
death overtime loss to UCLA in Feb
ruary and also lost a close 9-7 decision
a month later. Clearly, USC or Stan
ford could be capable of being the
first — and only — team to blemish
UCLA's undefeated record this year.
The Stanford players, however,
aren't looking ahead to UCLA just
yet — even senior Jackie Gauthier,
who will be ending her Cardinal ca
reer this weekend, was more focused
on just enjoying the experience.
"| I'd just like to say] what a great
opportunity it is to have NC'AAs here
to showcase both Stanford and Stan
ford water polo," said Gauthier.
"[And] also, how important it is and
great it is to have lots of fans there to
support us.
With the support of the home fans
and a little luck, it could be a tourna
ment to remember for Gauthier and
the Cardinal.

square off again.
On the other side of the bracket,
No. 1 UCLA will be playing No. 8
Pomona-Pitzer and No. 4 San Diego
State will match up with No. 5 seed
UC-Davis. While anything can hap
pen m a tournament, it would take a
very brave soul to bet against UCLA
making it to the championship game.
The Bruins have yet to lose this
season — not counting a 6-5 exhibi
tion loss to the U.S. National team —
and it would be an enormous upset if
they were to fall in one of the first two
rounds. Even fourth-seeded San
Diego State, who compiled a 29-6
record on the year, was beaten by
twelve goals. 17-5, after facing UCLA
earlier this season.
IT\at's not to say that UCLA is a
lock for the title, though — both
Stanford and USC have proven that
they can play right with the Bruins.
USC has met UCLA three times this
year.and after losing the first meeting
8-4. the Trojans lost the second and
third by only a goal each. As for Stan
ford. the Cardinal dropped a sudden
death overtime loss to UCLA in Feb
ruary and also lost a close 9-7 decision
a month later. Clearly, USC or Stan
ford could be capable of being the
first — and only — team to blemish
UCLA's undefeated record this year.
The Stanford players, however,
aren't looking ahead to UCLA just
yet — even senior Jackie Gauthier,
who will be ending her Cardinal ca
reer this weekend, was more focused
on just enjoying the experience.
"| I'd just like to say] what a great
opportunity it is to have NC'AAs here
to showcase both Stanford and Stan
ford water polo," said Gauthier.
"[And] also, how important it is and
great it is to have lots of fans there to
support us.
With the support of the home fans
and a little luck, it could be a tourna
ment to remember for Gauthier and
the Cardinal.
