In a dominating season
with a 25-4 record, tourna
ment play seems to be the
only thing that has caused
heartbreak for the Stanford
women's water polo team.
The Cardinal dropped a
5-4 decision to USC in the
group stages of the Stanford
Invitational back in early

February, keeping the Card out of the championship match. A few
weeks later, the team made it to the championship game of the Irvine
Tournament,only to lose 8-7 in sudden-death overtime to UCLA. Fi
nally, two weeks ago in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) conference tournament, the team once again fell 5-4 to
USC, this time in overtime of the semifinals.
So as the NCAA championships kick off at Stanford's home pool
in the Avery Aquatic Center this afternoon, the Card hopes that the
fourth time will be the charm in its search for a national title this sea
son.
As the No. 2 seed in the eight-team tournament, Stanford will face
off with No. 7 seed Marist in the first round.The Red Foxes — whose
home pool resides in Poughkeepsie, New York — won their confer
ence championship in dramatic fashion to earn their tournament
berth, beating Siena in double overtime in the semifinals and then
winning a 7-6 thriller against lona in the conference championship

Sophomore driver Kelly Eaton and the second seeded Cardinal women will look to capitalize on their dominant
regular season record at the NCAA tournament after stumbling in tourney play throughout the year.
