## "Chekhov is for Lovers" not just for Chekhov-lovers 
### CHELSEY LITTLE INTERMISSION SEAGULL 
Passion, rage, desperation, love
and a rollicking good time! These are
the things you'll find if you venture
into the unknown world of the under
ground drama scene here at Stanford
University. "Chekhov is for Lovers"
is an event put on by an independent
production group on campus under
the direction of Jeff Norman '10.
An appropriate title for a rendi
tion of Anton Chekhov's plays "The
Proposal" and"The Bear." as these
two pieces present the tension in
volved in the passionate struggle of
romance. Not overtly sentimental, the
plays depict the fury of passionate
love and the humor that stems the
battle of the sexes.
Love and frustration seem to be an
underlying theme for many theatre
companies and productions; the
whole process involves such a deep
commitment and ardor, but the frus
tration at Stanford can often come
from the lack of an outlet for this fer
vor for the arts. Norman commented
on the lack of a forum at Stanford for
the kind of theatre he wanted to do.
Sure, Ramshead produces Gai

eties and One-Acts, StanShakes does,
well, Shakespeare and the Stanford
Drama Department presents all sorts
of avant-garde productions, but
where is the Shaw, the Ibsen, the
O'Neil or Odets?
It is true — Stanford seriously
lacks this kind of theatre and it is pos
sible that this is due to the lack of
funding for such ventures. "You can't
get funding if you are not an

official Stanford student
group," Norman said, and the
process for becoming such a
group can be quite drawn out
and torturous.
Providing a "unique ser
vice" and being able to sustain

the group's activities for
enough years to display longevity are
just a few of the requirements for stu
dent groups. This may not sound par
ticularly challenging, but at Stanford,
a world where everyone is competing
for space and performance time, just
finding a place that will let you per
form can be very difficult.
"We had to fight really hard to get
this space," Norman says of the room
in the Elliott Programming Center
where the show will be held. "It was
n't easy at all." But one could say that

nothing worth doing ever is.
And was it worth it? Norman re
marked that his favorite part of the
production process was the opportu
nity the theatre gave him, an only
child, to experienced th brotherly and
sisterly love he missed out on growing
up. "Just being able to develop close
personal relationships, building
something, growing together..." make

the production process worthwhile
for this director.
And speaking of building some
thing together, the cast and crew of
"The Bear" and"The Proposal" have
created something incredibly delight
ful. The night is one full of highs and
lows and ups and downs that keep the
audience on the edge of their seats.
Packing two of Chekhov's shorter
plays together, the whole night is ex
pected to take a mere 65 minutes —
including an intermission — but the

entertainment packed into that one
hour is immense.
A few highlights of "The Propos
al" include the mother-daughter unit
played by Jessica Jacobs '08 and Jas
min Yu '10. Taking some liberty with
the genders of the play as written by
Chekhov, the character who was once
the father Stephan Stepanovich
Chubukov is now "Stepania." The

switch works well though —
Jacobs is able to maintain that
air of authority combined with
an elegance that would other
wise be lacking onstage.
Both her character and the
character of her on-stage
daughter, Natalya, are simply

hilarious when paired together,
each one feeding off the energy of the
other and providing the audience with
an amusing portrayal of this family re
lationship. And the man who brings
the conflict and love into the scene is
Ivan Vassilevich Lomov, played by
Rico Roque '09. The physical comedy
he brings to the scene keeps the action
going at a steady pace and affords the
viewer many laughs.
"The Bear" also has a cast of three
characters, Elana Ivanovna Popova,
played by Maria Carolina Roeller '10;

Grigory Stepanovich Smirnov, por
trayed by Sam Alimi '11 and the ser
vant, Luka, with another gender
switch performed flawlessly by Sarah
Guerrero '11. Guerrero's rendition of
Luka is done seamlessly; physically
and vocally, her performance is flaw
less and a true delight, the epitome of
how an actor can take a "small" role
and make it something really worth
watching. The weeping widow played
by Roeller is also absolutely charming
— the character's arc of development
is presented in a way that is quite be
lievable and interesting.
Then there is "the Bear" — burly,
brusque, mean and angry. Alimi's
portrayal is right on the money. And
while the chemistry between his char
acter and the widows is unexpected
upon first entering the scene as the
two are at such odds with each other,
this tension makes the final romantic
embrace a cathartic and amusing one.
All in all, this night of under
ground theatre is one you won't want
to miss! "Chekhov is for Lovers"
opened Thursday, May 8, and runs
through Saturday, May 10. It is show
ing at the Elliott Programming Center
and starts at 8 p.m. Admission is $5.
