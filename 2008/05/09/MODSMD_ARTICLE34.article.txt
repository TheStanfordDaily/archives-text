# Mother

### MELANIE REYNARD 
The beads of sweat multiply
on my nape.
That's where my mother
reached to embrace
When she drove me home
under a black sky.
I'm hunched over the leather
steering wheel
In the parking lot of the yogurt
shop.
I was a little imp, fifth height
percentile
(She says she liked me
so small for so long)
I remember rocking for hours in
the rocking chair. In silence.
She loved me up.
When she rubs my back tonight
I'm afraid
that I am completely lost in age.
Will she remember my
childhood for me?
Because I can't remember everything

I remember the day I learned her name.
"laurie." That's my mother. That's my mother.

Suddenly a stranger, no relation.
She took friends and me to the
yogurt shop
On tiptoes I peered over the
counter
We tried to win their favor with
flavor.
It didn't work because just the
next day
Those friends did not get any friendlier.
Does Melanie's mother even
exist?
I can have her whenever I want
her,
I can have her wherever I want
her,
I own her, her unrequited
service.
When 1 see her she no longer
has a face.
I feel angst but her embrace
simplifies.
For my pleasure she will self-

sacrifice.
And sometimes I forget to say
"thank you,"
Because she makes everything
so easy,
I could do it myself.
Nevertheless,
I deny she could ever deny me.
Hugs years ago, my cheek
reached her belly,
And she would pull away as I
dragged her.
Now our shoulders cave in to
each other's
She waits to let go until I roll
'way
And never really lets go —
always embracing.
The beads of sweat multiply
on my nape.
