## Mom Mash-Up 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION MAMA'S BOY 
Your mother may be great. She may make the best pies, send
the best care packages, tell the best bedtime stories — whatever.
But is she the best? Is she really Mo'.her of the Year material? To
answer this question, Bracketology has assembled sixteen mas
ters of matriarchy to compete in a no-holds-barred Mother's Day
Massacre. Let's go, girls.
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Mother Nature vs. 16. Mama Celeste
Mother Nature's gifts are abundant and wonderful: trees,
water, grass, stalagmites, stalagtites, gold, plums, quicksand — so
much goodness. Yet Mama Celeste provides us with something
even better: delicious bite-sized frozen pizzas! Celeste was essen
tially a second mother to me throughout elementary school.. .but
I guess I'll begrudgingly go with Mother Nature since, after all,
she is the reason we have fake tomato sauce and cheese to begin
with.
EDGE: Mother Nature.
8. A female grizzly bear vs. 9. Mama Bear
There is no questioning the average mother bear's devotion:
female grizzlies protecting their cubs make up 70% of all grizzly
human fatalities. But can the average mama bear compete with
Mama Bear of the Bcrenstain Bears? Hell no. Mama single
handedly cured her family of "the gimmies," taught us to not be
racist towards pandas and pleased Papa every night.
EDGE: Mama Bear.
5. Mrs. Robinson vs. 12. Lorelai Gilmore
Two totally unrealistic moms. "The Gilmore Girls" has some
how convinced every mother-teenage daughter combo in the
country that they too are "just like sisters!" Mrs. Robinson's se
ductive ways in the"The Graduate" are similarly implausible, but
at least her situation is more appealing. If you, dear reader, have
found your own Mrs. Robinson, well then...here's to you.
EDGE: Mrs. Robinson.
4. Your Mom vs. 13. Estelle Costanza
Both your mom and George Costanza's mom ("Seinfeld") are

equally annoying and intrusive. Both have seen you doing un
speakable things. But your mom loves you deep down. George's
Mom...well, I'm not so sure she does.
EDGE: Your mom.
3. Mother Goose vs. 14. Grendel's Mom
Mother Goose is great for stories and rhymes, but she sucks as
an actual mom. Nothing wrong with being career-oriented, but
still. On the other hand, Grendel's Mom has only one thing on her
mind: using Beowulf s semen to make monster babies. Now that's
dedication.
EDGE: Grendel's Mom
6. Mrs. Weasley vs. 11. Mrs. Potts
Molly Weasley does it all for her children: she knits them
sweaters, kills Death Eaters for them and even has that slightly
disturbing magical clock that shows where they are at all times.
Conversely, Mrs. Potts (the teapot from "Beauty and the Beast")
doesn't seem to care about any of her cup children except for
Chip. I do not condone playing favorites. 1 cannot reward that bla
tant cupism.
EDGE: Mrs. Weasley.
7. Jocasta vs. 10. Lorraine McFly
Lorraine McFly from "Back to the Future" represents Marty's
Oedipal nightmare. Jocasta is Oedipus' nightmare. Even worse,
she became a mom again via Oedipus. So why does she advance?
Because 1 like saying "Jocasta." Try it:
Joe-cahs-tahhhhh. I'm so easy.
EDGE: Jocasta.
2. Mother Teresa vs. 15. Juno
Teresa is the Mother of India. Juno is the mother of indie
movies. I'm going to go with the one that annoys me less
EDGE: Mama Teresa.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Mother Nature vs. 9. Mama Bear
Between global warming, hurricanes and putting all the good
oil in the Middle East, Mother Nature has made things pretty
rough on her children. Not so with Mama Bear. She's always good
for a backscratch and a warm glass of honey when you need it

most.
EDGE: Mama Bear.
5. Mrs. Robinson vs. 4. Your Mom
Mrs. Robinson may be the MlLFiest woman in movie history.
But I did your mom last night.
EDGE: Your Mom.
14. Grendel's Mom vs. 6. Mrs. Weasley
If this was Mrs. Weasley vs. Angelina "More Cambodian
refugees, please" Jolie, it might be a tough call. But no. It's Mrs.
Weasley against naked Angelina Jolie with a scorpion tail. I
wouldn't want my mom to be nude r>r arthropodic, let alone both.
EDGE: Mrs. Weasley.
7. Jocasta vs. 2. Mother Teresa
Not incest > incest.
EDGE: Teresa.
FINAL FOUR
9. Mama Bear vs. 4. Your Mom
Mama Bear is great, but who read you "The Berenstain
Bears?" That's right, your mom. (Also, your mom's hotter. Just
sayin'.)
EDGE: Your Mom.
6. Mrs. Weasley vs. 2. Mother Teresa
Would Mother Teresa ever have defended one of her Indian
orphans by screaming "not my daughter, you bitch!" No way.
Easy call.
EDGE: Mrs. Weasley.
CHAMPIONSHIP
4. Your Mom vs. 6. Mrs. Weasley
Molly Weasley may well be the best fictional mom ever. But
your mom exists, and she made you. While this may be one of
those hokey decisions like when Time Magazine made "You"
(Us!) the person of the year in 2006, just bear with me. Call your
mom up right now and have a non-fighting conversation. It's her
day.
CHAMP: Your Mom.
MVP: Birth canal.

Joe-cahs-tahhhhh. I'm so easy.
EDGE: Jocasta.
2. Mother Teresa vs. 15. Juno
Teresa is the Mother of India. Juno is the mother of indie
movies. I'm going to go with the one that annoys me less
EDGE: Mama Teresa.
ELITE EIGHT
1. Mother Nature vs. 9. Mama Bear
Between global warming, hurricanes and putting all the good
oil in the Middle East, Mother Nature has made things pretty
rough on her children. Not so with Mama Bear. She's always good
for a backscratch and a warm glass of honey when you need it

most.
EDGE: Mama Bear.
5. Mrs. Robinson vs. 4. Your Mom
Mrs. Robinson may be the MlLFiest woman in movie history.
But I did your mom last night.
EDGE: Your Mom.
14. Grendel's Mom vs. 6. Mrs. Weasley
If this was Mrs. Weasley vs. Angelina "More Cambodian
refugees, please" Jolie, it might be a tough call. But no. It's Mrs.
Weasley against naked Angelina Jolie with a scorpion tail. I
wouldn't want my mom to be nude r>r arthropodic, let alone both.
EDGE: Mrs. Weasley.
7. Jocasta vs. 2. Mother Teresa
Not incest > incest.
EDGE: Teresa.
FINAL FOUR
9. Mama Bear vs. 4. Your Mom
Mama Bear is great, but who read you "The Berenstain
Bears?" That's right, your mom. (Also, your mom's hotter. Just
sayin'.)
EDGE: Your Mom.
6. Mrs. Weasley vs. 2. Mother Teresa
Would Mother Teresa ever have defended one of her Indian
orphans by screaming "not my daughter, you bitch!" No way.
Easy call.
EDGE: Mrs. Weasley.
CHAMPIONSHIP
4. Your Mom vs. 6. Mrs. Weasley
Molly Weasley may well be the best fictional mom ever. But
your mom exists, and she made you. While this may be one of
those hokey decisions like when Time Magazine made "You"
(Us!) the person of the year in 2006, just bear with me. Call your
mom up right now and have a non-fighting conversation. It's her
day.
CHAMP: Your Mom.
MVP: Birth canal.
