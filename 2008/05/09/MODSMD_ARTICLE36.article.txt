# Motherly Love

Subject: Like mother, like daughter

I'm a unique individual. I promise.
I 've got weird hair (it's all afro-like). I can hold my breath under water
for a minute and 23 seconds. And I've gone my entire Stanford career, al
beit short, without taking economics, computer science or math. I'm, like,
one in six billion or something. Swear on it.
That's why a few months ago I was a little shocked — alright, super
shocked — when a couple of my friends told me there was someone out
there exactly like me. Actually, come to think of it, they didn't even give
me that courtesy. They informed me that I was exactly like someone else
already out there — as if the other person were the original and I was the
imitation! The nerve!
"Wha? Ahem? I think not," I quickly alerted my misinformed com
patriots.
To which they promptly replied, "Yep. You are just like your moth
er."
But alas! Is it true? Have 1 been deceived all along? Is my originality
merely an illusion, a mirage, a red herring? Have I somehow met my bi
ological and social destiny by turning into my mom? How did this hap
pen'?
I knew that I was different from my mother when I was 11 years old
— you know, that age when a person finally start to see himself as a sep
arate being from his parents. I began shaping my own identity and des
tiny. independent of parental influence.
When I was that age I was so sure my mother and I had little in com
mon (except for our fantastic looks). Mumsers was a high-powered busi
nesswoman — making deals, hiring and firing people, doing business
things. Me? I never saw myself in the office where my mom worked.
I knew from an early age that I wanted to be an artist. I was good at
drawing, writing and acting. How could I ever be a businesswoman?
Math was always my weakest subject, and I can't say my organization
al/managerial skills were something to write home about (of course, I was
11). The thought of directing business fairs never entered my mind.
That's how I knew that I wasn't like my mother — well, one of many
ways how 1 knew.
Basically, Mumsers and I disagree on so much. Of course we're not
alike! She's Obama; I'm Clinton (although I'm beginning to switch al
liances...oh, dear!). She likes order; I like chaos. She makes charts; I make
messes. She wears cute, frilly shirts while I tend to like cliched graphic T
shirts (a like that is steadily waning, much to my mother's fancy).
I remind myself of our differences as my friends mistakenly try to per
suade me that Mumsers and I are alike. "You guys are crazy," I tell them.
They are.
"You're the crazy one. Just look at her," they tell me. So I do. I still
don't see it. When I tell this to my friends they are happy to show me what
I'm missing. Apparently, we talk just alike, argue in the same way, have

the same mannerisms and are both really passionate.
I mean, okay. Sure, maybe they are right about those few incidental
little things, but surely that's not enough to warrant them saying my mom
and I are alike. I've spent my whole life trying to establish my indepen
dence only to have my work discounted by two crazy friends. But were
they right? I propose to myself to be more conscience of my actions.
Bad decision. I am totally, 10()% my mum.
Sigh.
I realize this as my roommate and I rearrange our room for the third
time this year. I mean seriously rearrange — the kind of rearrange where
we break out the tools, break into sweat and break a few bones. But why?
Wasn't it just a few months ago that I laughed as my mother told me how
she was re-decorating (again!!!!) our apartment? New furniture, new
paint jobs, new tile. As a teenager I always thought it silly that she was al
ways changing things around. After she was done she'd ask me what I
thought. Of course I always found that it was quite nice, but it seemed
bizarre to put all that work into decoration — something that was so in
significant to me.
Dear me.
And socks — clothes in general, in fact. Why must people always
leave them on the floor? Mumsers used to get so upset when I acciden
tally dropped clothes after doing laundry or something, leaving them in
the hallway. I mean, I'd see them, of course. But it never bothered me.
Why did it bother her so much?
Because it's really annoying, people. I work hard to make mutual
space clean and tidy. Is it so hard for you to make a five-second trip from
the place you're standing to the hamper or the drawer?
What have I become? My mum. After this startling realization, I
quickly send an email to an old friend of mine and tell him the news.
"Yeah. duh. You guys have always been just alike," he says. How could
no one have told me? I ask him what he means, "Well, you're both real
ly obsessed about nitpicky things. Remember how you used to hate it
when I'd mark your clothes with a tiny piece of pen? Also, you're both
really smart and funny and ambitious." Really smart, funny and ambi
tious? Hm. I mean. I suppose there are worse things to share in common
with someone.
That's when another realization hits me. Dude, I'm my mum. Frickin'
sweet. Sure, maybe I'm not as original or unique as I thought it was, but
maybe Mumsers is onto a good thing. Come to think of it, maybe my
grandmother was onto a good thing. Granny supported seven kids while
taking in people's ironing and eventually earning a nursing degree. Mom
supported me while getting her MBA and eventually her J.D. (she's a big
shot New York lawyer now!). Why wouldn't I want to follow in the steps
of such greatness? People love Mumsers. She's well-liked and people al
ways come to her for advice. She's a dynamic personality, and we love
hanging out together. Yeah, maybe I am my mom. And I couldn't be hap
pier about it.

Subject: Speaking your mother tongue

My mother knows five languages, and English isn't her first. She
grew up speaking Teochew, what seems to me like a far-off, exotic
language — perhaps because 1 don't understand it. Along the way,
she picked up a couple of others. These were also exotic, and also be
yond my level of comprehension. Then, somewhere along that long
road, there was English.
My mother switches back and forth easily, from phone calls to
her Teochew-speaking mother, to lunches with her Cantonese--
speaking in-laws, from conversations with Hokkien food vendors in
their roadside stalls, to me — English-speaking, English-thinking,
barely bilingual me.
It's sort of amazing. I constantly wonder how a brain can store so
much information, and if there are different little drawers for each
language. Perhaps a little brain minion pulls these drawers out every
time you need a language change, and some brain minions are just
more active than others are. Mum's, I think, is in constant overdrive,
pumped up on intravenous caffeine, switching gears like clockwork
as one language morphs into another. Mine's just lazy, and probably
a little bit of a slob too.
But there's one language that my mother can't seem to learn, and
it's a language that most mothers, however linguistically talented,
can't seem to either: the ever-mysterious language of the Internet
revolution. There are mums with AOL emails, mums who try to use
"LOL," mums who wonder if "g33k" is a different kind of Morse.
Our mothers just don't seem to understand the nuances and sub
tleties of the information age, where shorthand has been shortened
to the effect of castration and our brains have been wired to assimi
late a new, constantly changing lexicon of words.
My mother is quite the same. With her, however, the problem ac
tually began with the invention of computers. I still remember trying
to teach my mother how to type on a Word document more than a
decade ago. The concept of "backspace" was elusive, and so, appar
ently, was the idea of a mouse. My mum would flip out every time
the screensaver came on, as if it were some kind of suspicious, hallu
cinogenic device placed there by an alien seeking world dominion. I
can't even begin to count the times she would look at me, quite for
lornly over her first Word document, desperately wishing that it
were still the Dark Ages. She would give up light bulbs and mi
crowaves if she didn't have to press another "enter" key, turn on an
other monitor or deal with another hallucinogenic alien trap.
When the Internet came around, it was d£j& vu. I don't think my
mum really understood the instant pleasure of online shopping, or

the addictive quality of instant messaging. I didn't even know if she
could email, a fact that was most troubling as I prepared to board my
20-hour flight across the Pacific for Stanford. With a huge time dif
ference, emails seemed to be the only way of keeping in touch.
Necessity, thankfully, is the mother of invention, and my mother
is beginning to learn. She sends me an email a day, a daily paragraph
of news, and it's quite like receiving a digest from Postcards From
Yo Momma (http://postcardsfromyomomma.com). Like Postcards
From Yo Momma's emails that read, "So you know about my expe
rience with the goose and the raccoon last night," or "I went to a
plastic surgeon yesterday to talk about Brenda's and my droopy eye
lids and my many chinz," my mum too has her own brand of hilari
ty-
Out of the 205 emails my mother has sent me so far (all titled "hi"
or "From mom"), here are some of my favorites.
A warning against narcissism: "Sometimes, instead of talking
about yourself it is interesting to ask about [other people]."
On eating healthy: "Told dad your jean size — he says you are
catching up with him."
On my fear of caterpillars: "Earlier, at the Goldhill bus-stop, I
saw a lady flicking a green caterpillar off her body. It landed on the
concrete seat and started crawling. The trick is to stay cool and not
be alarmed if ever one landfs] on you while in Stanford. Always be
prepared, but hope it won't happen. Keep your spirits up!!"
Encouraging me to lose my dignity for the rest of my Stanford ca
reer: "Looks like it is raining again in Stanford. Do you wear your
poncho or carry umbrella when you ride your bike?"
. A random string of wisdom: "Love the photos of the cute cats and
seal!! Good to take up yoga but remember your time management."
On safely: "Good to buy the new bike, as I can imagine the frus
tration of riding a lousy bike with brake and gear not functioning
well. Happy peddling!!"
It must be all the exclamation marks, or perhaps just the fact that
she's my mother. The Internet probably still eludes her, and I think
all technology overwhelms her. But when you get an email telling
you that your parents are thinking of you(!), to have a great day(!!)
and that your mother, however far away, still LOVES YOU(!!!), it's
impossible not to be happy.
