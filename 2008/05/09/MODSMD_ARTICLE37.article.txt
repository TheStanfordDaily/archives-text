## What to buy Mom for Mother's Day 
### AISHA WELLS INTERMISSION MATERIAL GRIL 
Mothers deserve a lot, don't they?
Most of them cook, clean, clean after
you, cook for you...and your father,
etc. In short, they're a hardworking
bunch, well deserving of serious son
and-daughter appreciation. I'm sure
many of us can attest to the fact that it
is probably our mothers' selflessness
that helped us get into Stanford. You
know, all that nurturing and stuff.
Coming home after a hard day at
school to the smell of grilled cheese
and sweet things, getting a loving kiss
on the cheek, perhaps even a running
bath waiting for you. (Hey, some peo
ple have it made.) In any case, show
your mother just how much she
means to you with these totally awe
some, original gifts.
A Season Pass to Six Flags Great
America

You're damn right. No more spas,
massages, and cliche getaways. Your
mother has spent the last 18 to 22
years slaving away after you, your lazy
siblings and your even lazier father.
Now is time for some fun — none of
that silly relaxation stuff you read in
"women's" magazines like "Marie
Claire" and "Cosmopolitan." There's
a pretty good chance your Mom's
youth ended a while ago, but don't re
mind her and send her into a mid-life
crisis with some prototypical spa
treatment.
"Queer as Folk: The Complete Se
ries"
Just what the doctor ordered: hot
steamy man sex. You heard me. Hot
steamy man sex, not to mention all the
rippling, muscled bodies strutting
across the screen. Men shouldn't be
the only ones to have all the fun. Sur
prise your Mom with this raunchy
Showtime feature about five horny

gay men living in Pittsburgh —
though their definition of "living" is
quite different from ours. Like, "liv
ing" as in "go clubbing and screw the
first hard-body you see." Ain't noth
in' wrong with that.
A Visa (lift Card
Sounds so innocuous, doesn't it?
Your mother will definitely love this
one for the freedom it offers. These
things can be taken anywhere. Hand
it over to her and watch her crack a
huge, mischievous grin. Don't ask her
where she's going to use it. There are
some things about your mother that
you just shouldn't know.
"Ride the Lightning" by Metaliica
1 would guess that your Mom does
n't exactly listen to the best music. By
"best," I mean the hardest rockin'. If
so, check your bank account, make
sure you've got at least 10 dollars,
open up iTunes and download what

is, arguably, Metallica's magnum
opus (or "Master of Puppets" —
whatever). This is for when your Dad
starts getting annoying, and all she
wants to do is drown out his incessant
whining. Double-click "Fight Fire
with Fire," turn it up to nine (Metalii
ca doesn't even have to go up to 11;
they're that damn good), and start
headbanging. It's quite therapeutic
— cures depression, you know.
If you've got the cash...one of
those remote-controlled massage
chairs
This is totally better than a manual
massage. Now that she has one of
these in her living room, she (and you
for future Mother's Days) doesn't
have to worry about dropping serious
bucks on a masseuse trip. You pay
one large sum for the chair, and there
you have it: a permanent place for re
pose right in front of the TV — for
when she's watching "Queer as Folk."

And Best of A 11...
Whatever it is she wants (a.k.a. I
can't think of anything else she would
want)
And neither can you sometimes.
So to stay on the safe side, why not just
let your Mom decide what's going to
happen on Mother's Day? This would
certainly take the burden off of you,
and I'm sure she would appreciate
your willingness to do or buy whatev
er makes her happy. Imagine, she
would probably be thinking, "Oh,
how sweet! My little baby is so charm
ing and considerate!" (Read between
the lines: lazy little bastard...)
Now, take some time to think this
all over. Don't be too hasty now.
Mother's Day should be perfect,
more or less, so be sure to put as much
effort into it as possible. And remem
ber: no...wire...hangers...
