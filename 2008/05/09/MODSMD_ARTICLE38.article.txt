## A 						brief history of the "Yo Momma" joke 
### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION COMEDY ARCHIVIST 
1891 — The "Yo Momma" joke is
discovered by Moravian missionaries
deep in the Amazonian rainforest.
Though the expedition's Ya_omamo
guides maintain the creature is fierce
and not to be approached, leader
Gilliam Nitschmann succeeds in cap
turing and subduing the beast. The ef
fort severely injures the evangelists'
egos, killing four.
1897 — The joke is transferred
from the private collection of the
Moravian College and Theological
Seminary to the Smithsonian after the
joke releases itself from its fetters and
begins prowling the greater Bethle
hem, Pennsylvania area in search of
people with mommas.
1908 — The first attempt at har
nessing the joke's power in the service
of art appears in turn-of-the-century
vaudeville banjo soloist Fred Bacon's
wax cylinder recording, "Medley of
Southern Airs":
FRED BACON: Is your mother
not corpulent?
CHILD'S VOICE: Yes, sir.
FRED BACON: (Slide whistle.)
Bacon is eventually driven mad by
the effort of the performance.

1912 — Taking advantage of the
Smithsonian's recent purchase of a
sturdier joke-cage, The Washington
Post features a more ambitious exem
plar of the "Yo Momma" joke in a
criticism of Woodrow Wilson by
famed columnist Jarvis Ochs Gen
zlinger: "[Wilson's] bony counte
nance and notable ineptitude in the
game of golf bespeak the overween
ing childhood presence of a singularly
large mother — a mother large
enough to be, arguably, on both sides
of the family. Bam!" Gen/linger, un
aware of the historical significance of
his gibe, then immediately resumes
comparing Wilson to "the Nip
ponese."
1931—The Great Depression
fosters a sharp up-tick in the joke's
popularity, as well as a corresponding
diversification of its subject matter.
Popular derivatives include "Your
mother is so poor," "Your mother is
poorer than my mother," "Your
mother is a migrant" and "Your
mother is very poor."
1943 — An expanding war effort
sees the first use of the phrase by a
governmental agency — the U.S. mil
itary incorporates a version of the
joke in propaganda leaflets air
dropped over German towns. A
translation error, however, causes the
messages to read, "Your mother is so

large, she steeplechase prawn insou
ciant." The popularity of seafood
briefly spikes in Central Europe.
1954—1n the first televised ap
pearance of the "Yo Momma" form.
Senator Joseph McCarthy justifies his
aggressive persecution of American
communism by comparing Mother
Russia to a pair of buttocks and, after
a brief pause, executing a half-hearted
pop-lock.
1967 — Timothy Leary experi
ences a vivid hallucination of a world
"entirely taken up," as he describes it,
"by your momma."
1978 — Celebrated disco singer
Evelyn "Champagne" King releases
the hit single "Your Momma
(Momma Momma)," which makes up
for its derivative melody line with its
inspirational message ("Your
momma, momma, momma").
1985 — In what The New York
Times later acknowledges may have
been biased coverage of the
Nicaraguan Sandinista-Contra con
flict, the newspaper refers to Sandin
ista founder Carlos Fonseca's mother
as a "skeezy bitch," suggesting that
her vagina is large enough to accom
modate a variety of unlikely objects.
This marks the last time a major
media outlet exhibits partiality.
1993 — Pharmaceutical company

GlaxoSmith Kline introduces its series
of "Yo Momma" television commer
cials, directed at the American mar
ket. "Yo momma so fat she at in
creased risk for coronary disease,"
states a 20-something man with
spiked hair. "Adipose tissue has been
decisively linked to congestive heart
failure, dogg." The campaign is criti
cized for being too confusing, and the
corporation soon switches to ads fea
turing a frog riding a bicycle.
2001—Writer Michael Chabon
publishes his Bright City — a novel
constructed as a single, extended "Yo
Momma" joke: "Dickie sat, en
veloped by the gray armchair. Histor
ical Heirloom, as though pounded tap

by tap downwards with the hammer
of this opportunity. He had been
taken in by the sheer optimism of the
moment that plainspoken promoter
had constructed, full up with Manhat
tan soirees and the ephemerally clad
nymphs that populate New York
apartments in snakelike knots, the
fame that would trace his spoor as
originator of such an attraction, the
cash his mother could bring. He had
to consider it. She was so very fat."
2007 — After lying chained for
nearly a century, the Smithsonian's
original "Yo Momma" joke escapes,
savaging a convention held by the So
ciety for People with Fat Mommas.
There are no survivors.

"Yo Momma" jokes from the modern era
Yo momma so fat she eats Wheat Thicks.
Yo momma so ugly her mom had to be drunk to breast feed

Yo momma so fat, when she turns around, people give her a

Yo momma so old, she older than yo grandma.
Yo momma so fat, she walked into The Gap...and filled it.
Yo momma so smelly, the only dis I'm going to give her is
disinfectant.
Yo momma so greasy, her freckles slipped off.
Yo momma so fat, she can't even jump to conclusions.
