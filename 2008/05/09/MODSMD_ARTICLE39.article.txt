## "Son of Rambow": Imagination on steroids 
### COURTNEY "THOMAS" VANCE INTERMISSIONQUIRK COLLECTOR 
British movie "Son of Ram
bow."
Despite the wholesome,
loveable plot, the film reeks
of amateurism. "Son of
Rambow," written and di
rected by Garth Jennings,
loses its way not with story
but with production quality
and delivery. At times, the

Meet Will (Bill Milner) — the young son of a
widowed woman who is a member of an Amish
like religious sect called "The Brethren." Now
meet Lee (Will Poulter) — scorned bully, basically
orphaned, who spends his time making and selling
bootleg videos, harassing the elderly and shooting
a screen test for an upcoming film competition.
Will and Lee are blood brothers — or at least they
come to be throughout the course of the adorable

movie seems as if it's been hastily put together
Rather than a unified whole that flows smoothly
from one scene to the next, the film seems like a
collection of scenes shoddily placed one after the
other. It's a shame because bad production is like
bad writing: The audience loses much of the won
derful content when the task is executed poorly.

The less-than-perfect delivery doesn't ruin the
film, though. Besides, any movie in which the star
uses the Bible as his coloring/sketch book can do
very little wrong. "Son of Rambow" makes up for
its amateurism in many other ways. For example,
instead of injecting fake quirkiness into itself like
its beloved art film relative "Juno" (does anyone
still drink Sunny Delight?), the movie stays very

genuine. One never doubts that these are real peo
ple and real families.

This is particularly true in the case of the film's
young actors, who brought a realness and depth to
the roles rarely seen from child actors. While one
would think Milner might get caught up overplay
ing the sweetness of Will, he manages to avoid sap
piness and actually angers the audience at times (as
he is supposed to). And although Poulter some
times struggles with the emotional scenes (which
could be a failure of the script), he is for the most

part very convincing. He is
very funny (though a little
off on timing), and he fully
embodies the 12-year-old
bully that actually has a
heart of gold.
Sure, "Son of Rainbow"
dips more than once into the
realm of the pretty unbeliev
able, but vou find yourself

saying, "It could happen..."
For example, for a reason not addressed in the
film. Will's mother somehow finds it fit to send him
to the local, public school despite her fundamental
ist religious beliefs. Maybe the audience could buy
that. Surprisingly. Will gets along fine. He must
simply remember to let himself out of the class
room when the teachers decide to show an educa
tional film (he is not allowed to watch television).
No real trouble comes his way until the bully Lee
singles him out as his next victim. One absurd event
after another, and Will finds himself in the garage
of Lee's house watching the violent, machine-gun
movie "First Blood" — starring Sylvester Stallone
as the war hero Ranibo.

Will is inspired. The highly imagi
native hoy creates a new life for him
self free from the restrictions of his re
ligious home. He writes and illus
trates his imaginings in comic hook
form and declares his work as well as
himself "Son of Rambo." Lee and
Will team up together to film the
story, hut after a number of hi-jinks,
broken bones, bad '80s haircuts — it
becomes clear that this movie is more
than a film within a film. It's a film
about bonding and stuff. And love.
These themes lend themselves well to
a number of great friendship mon
tages.
Friendship montages can't hold a
film together, though. "Son of Ram
bow" begins to lose its direction to

ward its center. The plot begins to
drag and many scenes entirely irrele
vant. It's as if Jennings had a great
idea hut wasn't really sure where to go
with it.
Enter "Didier" — a French ex
change student who manages to gar
ner a cult following at Will and Lee's
school, because let's face it, that's
what the French do. He, as well as his
posse, decides to join in on the fun of
shooting the film. But with the
Frenchman comes trouble (surprise,
surprise). Soon, Will and Lee's idyllic
friendship is put to the test.
At times, Didier's role seems noth
ing more than a way to add unneces
sary conflict to the already tumul
tuous plot. Instead, he becomes a

dragging force that further slows the
pace of the movie. That said, he docs
seem rather important to the movie, if
only for the reason that he is absolute
ly hilarious and colorful.
This film isn't perfect. In fact, it's
not much better than just "pretty
good," a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. But it's
funky — funky and original. Further
more, it manages to achieve this funk
iness without being pretentious or un
convincing. Many indie art films have
the appearance of trying too hard.
"Son of Rambow" doesn't try at all. It
is simply fun and imaginative, the way
films should be. It makes you smile
and laugh and also sometimes sad.
But ultimately, it just makes you feel
good and reminds you not to take life
too seriously.
