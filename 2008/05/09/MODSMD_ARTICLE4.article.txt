# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## No. 4 Stanford set for NCAA Tournament 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite making its 27th consecutive appearance
at the NCAA Tournament this afternoon, the No. 4
Stanford women's tennis team has a different feel
coming into this year's championships.
As the fourth seed in the tournament, the Cardi
nal women enter as underdogs behind defending
champion Georgia Tech and powerhouse North
western. If anything, however, this is to Stanford's ad
vantage.
"There's always a different feeling every single
year," junior Jessica Nguyen said. "We're in a differ
ent position than I've ever experienced,coming in as
the four seed. It's huge for us to know that people
don't expect us to win.
"We know we have the ability and talent to win
and it really gets us riled up."
And getting the Stanford women's tennis team mad
isn't something the rest of the field wants to do.
The Cardinal women are on a seven-game win
