# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## No. 4 Stanford set for NCAA Tournament 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite making its 27th consecutive appearance
at the NCAA Tournament this afternoon, the No. 4
Stanford women's tennis team has a different feel
coming into this year's championships.
As the fourth seed in the tournament, the Cardi
nal women enter as underdogs behind defending
champion Georgia Tech and powerhouse North
western. If anything, however, this is to Stanford's ad
vantage.
"There's always a different feeling every single
year," junior Jessica Nguyen said. "We're in a differ
ent position than I've ever experienced,coming in as
the four seed. It's huge for us to know that people
don't expect us to win.
"We know we have the ability and talent to win
and it really gets us riled up."
And getting the Stanford women's tennis team mad
isn't something the rest of the field wants to do.
The Cardinal women are on a seven-game win
streak and have come out on top in 13 of
their last 14 dual matches.
In the meanwhile, they have continued
their home dominance, stretching their
home win streak to 132 consecutive
matches.
"We're very excited and fortunate to
host the first two rounds," Nguyen said.
"It's definitely a different environment.
It's more intense than any other home
match. It'll he great because the freshmen
haven't experienced that yet".
This afternoon, Stanford squares off
with Boston University at I p.m. at the
Tauhe Family Tennis Stadium.
The Terriers are making their tenth
consecutive appearance at the tournament
after winning their 15th straight American
East title.
The winner of this first round match
will go on to face either Texas A&M or
Washington.
Though the Cardinal has not faced
Boston or Texas A&M. the team is ready to
take on any opponent.
"Right now, our mentality is that we're
going to go out there and play 100 per
cent," Nguyen said. "It doesn't really mat
ter who we've faced — whether we've
played them before or whether we know
the girls. We're going to go out there and
focus on ourselves and focus on perform
ing.
"When we do that, we come out on
top," Nguyen said.
Certainly Stanford has set its eyes on be
yond the first two rounds.a
The top-16 teams in the tournament
will advance to'Tlilsa.Okla. where a cham
pion will be crowned.
"Everybody's been focused and in
tense," Nguyen said. "You can really tell
that we have our eyes on the goal. We go
through a whole season before NCAAs
but we know our only goal of the entire
year is to win NCAAs."
In the postseason,Stanford has regular
ly stepped up its game. They are 104-12 in
the postseason, winning 15 of the 26 possi
ble titles.
For now, the task at hand is to advance

past these opening rounds, which was
made more difficult by injuries at the Pac
-10 Championships.
One of the most striking blows to the
squad was a strained pectoral suffered by
freshman Hilary Barte, who has simply
dominated at the top of the lineup.
Fortunately for the Card. Barte's injury
has healed after two weeks of recupera
tion.
"Hilary's been playing for the past
week and it looks like she's on her game,"
Nguyen said. "She's playing really well,
and we're excited to have her back at the
number one spot. It's looking very good
for us 1 think."
With the two week layover, the Cardi
nal women have been able to rest for the
long haul.
"Everything we did leading up to
NCAAs was preventative and more pre
cautionary." Nguyen said. "Our main goal
is to be healthy for the first day of NCAAs
and I think we've accomplished that. Peo
ple have been taking care of themselves,
getting treatment and right now we're in
really good shape."
So, with a recovered squad, Stanford
now attempts to reclaim the national
championship.
As the postseason comes along, the in
tensity surely has ramped up for the Cardi
nal.
"We've all seen a big change in our
practices," Nguyen said. "We can't wait to
host the first two rounds here. It's such a
treat to have it here. Hopefully, we're look
ing forward to going to TUlsa and taking
the title."
