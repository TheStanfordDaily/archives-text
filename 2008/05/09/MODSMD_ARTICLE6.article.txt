## Falling dollar Weak dollar makes for tight budgets for students abroad 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
As the value of the U.S. dollar tumbles
internationally, some Stanford students
planning to take advantage of Stanford's
study abroad programs have expressed
concern over the fluctuating world
exchange rates and increased projected
costs of their time abroad.
The U.S. dollar has fallen to record
lows against the euro and has weakened
significantly against several other world
currencies, including the Chinese yuan
and British pound. In the last six months,
the dollar has fallen approximately 15
percent to the euro, according to the
Bloomberg currency exchange and
Yahoo! Finance.
At press time, one euro was worth
$1.53 dollars, and one pound was worth
$1.95.
Uarya Tarekegn "09. who studied
abroad in Paris last quarter, said that

though she was aware of the decreasing
value of the dollar, it really did not really
hit her until she landed.
"The weak dollar really affected us
when we were in Paris," Tarekegn said.
"When we landed, the exchange rate was
$1.40 to a euro and by the time we left it
was $1.60 to a euro."
Tarekegn said that the fluctuating rate
restricted some students from taking full
advantage of their time in Europe.
"Increasing exchange rates meant that
by the end of the quarter, people stopped
traveling as much,"Tarekegn said. "It also
impacted spring break plans as a lot of
people who had planned to travel around
Europe during the break ended up having
to cut their trips short. It just got too
expensive."
As a result of the high exchange rates,
students abroad said that they had to pay
extra careful attention to their budgets
and spending.
"1 think that people were really aware

of the exchange rate when we were fl
there,"Tarekegn said. "Every time we
went out to eat, all the students would
calculate the cost of their meal in dol
lars and decide whether or not to eat
there. You just can't justify it to your
self to have a $15 lunch everyday."
In light of the weak dollar and
high exchange rates, some students
like Jessica Perez '10 are rethinking ™
their overseas study plans and loca
tions, particularly those programs in
Europe.

"I got accepted to the Madrid program
for next year, hut now I'm thinking about
going to Santiago instead." Perez said. "It
is much more expensive now to spend a
quarter in Madrid. The dollar is just more
valuable in Santiago."
Despite higher exchange rates, the
popularity of Bing Overseas Studies
Program's (BOSP) has steadily increased.
According to David Boyer. associate
director of the BOSP. the program has not

seen a drop in interest or enrollment. The
number of students who will be abroad
during autumn quarter 2008-09 will be 25
percent higher than this past fall.
Similarly, the number of student appli
cants for autumn quarter 2008-09 was 16.6
percent higher than for autumn quarter
2007-08.

Cooper said that the Office of
Financial Aid makes every effort to
make studying abroad an afford
able experience for all students
regardless of the state of the U.S.
economy.
"When students on aid go over
seas in one of Stanford's programs,
an additional allowance is added to
their budget," Cooper said. "The
allowances are specific to the center
they are attending and meant to
cover transportation expenses as
well as standard expenses that
aren't covered by BOSP"
"We also recognize that while
students are overseas, they typically
aren't able to work so the work
expectation in their regular finan
cial aid package is reduced," Cooper
added. "The increased need is met
with a combination of scholarship
funds and loan eligibility."
BOSP gives every student in a
particular program the same
stipend, a stipend that is kept con
stant regardless of currency fluctua
tions.
"They gave us a very generous
stipend, and you could definitely get
by just with that," said Vithia An '10,
who studied in Berlin last quarter.
"When the U-Bahn [the metro, the

students' primary means of trans
portation] went on strike for two
weeks, some students had to take
taxis to the center, and the BOSP
reimbursed us for that."
Though the high exchanges rates
made spending in Europe more dif
ficult. Political Science Prof. John
Ferejohn. faculty-in-residence in
Paris last quarter, said studying
abroad could be affordable if you
prepare for it.
"It was not really a surprise to
me that the dollar was losing value
— that has been going on for years
so 1 braced myself for it by not
going to expensive restaurants and
not buying things to bring home,"
Ferejohn said. "While food is not
cheap, there are lots and lots of lit
tle places that are excellent and
[have] pretty low prices — even
now. Paris Chinatowns — there are
two big ones — are great too and
very different from the ones in the
U.S."
Despite high exchange rates, stu
dents said they treasured the oppor
tunity to study abroad.
"It was really a life changing
experience for me." An said. "1 had
the opportunity to truly embrace
another culture, and it was not like
anything I had imagined. 1 would do
it again in a heartbeat — regardless
of the exchange rate."

by just with that," said Vithia An '10,
who studied in Berlin last quarter.
"When the U-Bahn [the metro, the

students' primary means of trans
portation] went on strike for two
weeks, some students had to take
taxis to the center, and the BOSP
reimbursed us for that."
Though the high exchanges rates
made spending in Europe more dif
ficult. Political Science Prof. John
Ferejohn. faculty-in-residence in
Paris last quarter, said studying
abroad could be affordable if you
prepare for it.
"It was not really a surprise to
me that the dollar was losing value
— that has been going on for years
so 1 braced myself for it by not
going to expensive restaurants and
not buying things to bring home,"
Ferejohn said. "While food is not
cheap, there are lots and lots of lit
tle places that are excellent and
[have] pretty low prices — even
now. Paris Chinatowns — there are
two big ones — are great too and
very different from the ones in the
U.S."
Despite high exchange rates, stu
dents said they treasured the oppor
tunity to study abroad.
"It was really a life changing
experience for me." An said. "1 had
the opportunity to truly embrace
another culture, and it was not like
anything I had imagined. 1 would do
it again in a heartbeat — regardless
of the exchange rate."
