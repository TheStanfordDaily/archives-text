## Falling dollar Weak dollar makes for tight budgets for students abroad 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
As the value of the U.S. dollar tumbles
internationally, some Stanford students
planning to take advantage of Stanford's
study abroad programs have expressed
concern over the fluctuating world
exchange rates and increased projected
costs of their time abroad.
The U.S. dollar has fallen to record
lows against the euro and has weakened
significantly against several other world
currencies, including the Chinese yuan
and British pound. In the last six months,
the dollar has fallen approximately 15
percent to the euro, according to the
Bloomberg currency exchange and
Yahoo! Finance.
At press time, one euro was worth
$1.53 dollars, and one pound was worth
$1.95.
Uarya Tarekegn "09. who studied
abroad in Paris last quarter, said that

though she was aware of the decreasing
value of the dollar, it really did not really
hit her until she landed.
"The weak dollar really affected us
when we were in Paris," Tarekegn said.
"When we landed, the exchange rate was
$1.40 to a euro and by the time we left it
was $1.60 to a euro."
Tarekegn said that the fluctuating rate
restricted some students from taking full
advantage of their time in Europe.
"Increasing exchange rates meant that
by the end of the quarter, people stopped
traveling as much,"Tarekegn said. "It also
impacted spring break plans as a lot of
people who had planned to travel around
Europe during the break ended up having
to cut their trips short. It just got too
expensive."
As a result of the high exchange rates,
students abroad said that they had to pay
extra careful attention to their budgets
and spending.
"1 think that people were really aware

of the exchange rate when we were fl
there,"Tarekegn said. "Every time we
went out to eat, all the students would
calculate the cost of their meal in dol
lars and decide whether or not to eat
there. You just can't justify it to your
self to have a $15 lunch everyday."
In light of the weak dollar and
high exchange rates, some students
like Jessica Perez '10 are rethinking â„¢
their overseas study plans and loca
tions, particularly those programs in
Europe.

"I got accepted to the Madrid program
for next year, hut now I'm thinking about
going to Santiago instead." Perez said. "It
is much more expensive now to spend a
quarter in Madrid. The dollar is just more
valuable in Santiago."
Despite higher exchange rates, the
popularity of Bing Overseas Studies
Program's (BOSP) has steadily increased.
According to David Boyer. associate
director of the BOSP. the program has not

seen a drop in interest or enrollment. The
number of students who will be abroad
during autumn quarter 2008-09 will be 25
percent higher than this past fall.
Similarly, the number of student appli
cants for autumn quarter 2008-09 was 16.6
percent higher than for autumn quarter
2007-08.
