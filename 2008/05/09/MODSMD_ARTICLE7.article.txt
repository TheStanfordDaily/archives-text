### MOHAMMAD ALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When election time rolls around
this November, more than the pres
idency of the United States will be
at stake. Last night, two foreign
officials articulated their vision of
the role the United States' next
president will play in global affairs.
"I would like to see a president
who looks at the world with a
mutual respect," said Alejandro
Toledo Ph.D. '93, the former presi
dent of Peru from 2001-2006 who
currently serves as the Payne
Distinguished Lecturer at Stanford.
"A president that respects small
countries and big countries."
Toledo, who was the first demo
cratically elected President of Peru
of indigenous descent, grew up in
an impoverished family of 16 chil

Toledo earned money shining

Suphamongkhon said that
America needs to regain its moral

understand the nuances of global

"The world is not black and
white," he remarked. "The world is
full of colors and shades."
Both dignitaries talked about
their experiences in working with
other countries to arrive at multilat
eral solutions for world problems.
"I would like to see a president
from the United States who pro
motes democracy in a concrete
sense, beyond the political speech."
Toledo said. "Not just a political
democracy but a democracy that
provides clean water, quality of
health care, quality of education,
rural electricity."
Suphamongkhon stressed the
need for a human element in inter

"I have always been allergic to

Suphamongkhon said. "1 would
