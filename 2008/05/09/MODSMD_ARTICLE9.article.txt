# STUDENT LIFE
## Scholarship memorializes Morsette Dare to Dream scholarship to help Native student a afford college 
### VERONICA LANDA 
When an aunt was painting the room of
Maurice "Mo" Morsette '09. she found a coin on
his dresser inscribed with a short but powerful
message: Dare to dream.
It is this message that his family hopes to share
with others through the Dare to Dream
Scholarship, which was established in Morsette's
memory after his passing in April 2007. The schol
arship will help a male Native student from
Morsette's hometown of New Town. ND afford a
college education.
Stanford's annual Powwow will also host a
three-on-three basketball tournament this Sunday
to commemorate Morsette's life as an active mem
ber in the Stanford Native community.
Tanaya Winder '08 said that Morsette, who
played for the Native community's intramural bas
ketball team, "used to say that basketball was his
one true love. It is a good tribute to [his] life."
In addition. Winder and Morsette's family hope
that the Dare to Dream scholarship will expand
college options for underserved students.
"His family wanted something to give back in
his honor, something to help other Native students
in college," Winder said.
"There aren't very many students from reserva
tions at schools like Stanford," Winder added. "I
don't think I've ever come across a scholarship for
Native males from a reservation. It is a very under
served group."
The scholarship will be awarded next year, and
Winder hopes that it will inspire the people of their
community to pursue higher education.
"Most scholarships I've heard of are named for
older people who have worked for this corporation
or that non-profit," Winder said. "It is nice to see a
scholarship come together out of pure love for an
individual because he had so much love for every
one else."
"It is amazing to think that somebody so young,
20 years old. was able to make such an impact on
people," she added.
Winder and the Morsette family have been rais
ing funds since February and hope that they will be
able to raise enough money to expand the scholar
ship so that they can help the recipient throughout
his college career. They also hope that with enough
funds they can award scholarships to multiple stu
dents.
"I'm hoping it will be something that will carry
on and be something for men from reservations in
general," Winder said.
Winder said efforts have come along quite well
in such a short time and they are amazed at the
response from the community.
"There is a good mix of people who knew him
really well and people who didn't working for this,"
Winder said. "It is really nice to see his legacy car
rying on, to see how many people he touched."
