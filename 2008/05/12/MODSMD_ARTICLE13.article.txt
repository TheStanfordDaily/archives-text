### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
In order to be prepared for a campus-wide crisis,
Stanford will test out its emergency mass notification sys
tem this Wednesday. The notification system, dubbed
AlertSU, will send test messages to all Stanford students,
faculty and staff this Wednesday. Messages will arrive via
voicemail, text and email, and will be sent to all personal
contacts listed in Axess. If students have listed their home
phone number, their families will also receive a message.
In a press release, Stanford officials said that the test mes
sages will clearly state that there is no current emergency
and no response is necessary. Testing the AlertSU system
is an important step to increasing safety on campus,
according to the press release.
