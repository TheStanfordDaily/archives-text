## Protect first amendment, says journalist 
### PATRICK WALTERS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” A former USA
Today reporter facing fines for failing to reveal her
sources for stories about the 2001 anthrax attacks
said Saturday that news organizations need to go on
the offensive in the fight to protect the First
Amendment.
"As we all know, the news business is on a collec
tive nervous breakdown," Toni Locy told a coalition
of open-government and press groups. "It's time to
stop running. It's time to turn and fight. If we don't
fight for the First Amendment, who will?"
Locy. who now teaches journalism at West
Virginia University, spoke at the annual convention
of the National Freedom of Information Coalition.
She said the country needs a shield law that would
protect reporters from having to reveal their sources.
"The First Amendment needs some help," she
said. "In this environment that we're in now, it needs
some help."
Locy is appealing an order from U.S. District
Judge Reggie B. Walton that requires her to pay as
much as $5,000 a day until she gives up her sources
for stories about the government's investigation of
the anthrax attacks.
