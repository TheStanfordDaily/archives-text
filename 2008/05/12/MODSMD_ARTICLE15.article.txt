## Facebook makes profiles portable 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Facebook Inc. is loosening its grip
on millions of personal profiles to
allow inhabitants of its popular
Internet hangout to transplant the
information and applications to
other Web sites.
With the changes announced
Friday, Facebook joins a growing
movement to make it easier for
people to share their favorite pic
tures, information and applications
with family and friends anywhere
on the Internet.
Facebook, which has about 70
million users worldwide, unveiled
its plans the day after its bigger
rival, News Corp.'s MySpace, made
a similar commitment.
Unlike MySpace, which has
about 200 million users worldwide,
Palo Alto-based Facebook plans to
allow users to take their personal
profiles to any Web site that wants
to host them. For starters, MySpace

is opening user profiles only to a
select group of sites, including lead
ing destinations owned by Yahoo
Inc. and eßay Inc.
Both Facebook and MySpace say
several weeks remain before their
users' data becomes portable.
The transition poses a risk for
Facebook and MySpace because
they are effectively tearing down
the barriers that sequestered the
personal profiles on their sites. This
so-called "walled-garden" approach
kept people coming back to the
sites and sticking around, creating a
magnetism that appeals to advertis
ers.
But pressure to offer portable
profiles has been building as people
have embraced the Internet as a
convenient way to swap personal
information and interests.
Internet search leader Google
Inc. waded into the fray last year by
creating a network that's supposed
to make it easier to share music, pic
tures, video and other personal
interests on a range of online hang

outs.
MySpace joined the Google sys
tem, known as Open Social, but
Facebook hasn't.
If freeing up the personal pro
files on its site turns Facebook into
the command center for shaping
and steering social interactions
across the Web, that could make
Facebook even more powerful than
it already was becoming.
Facebook's Web site could also
become an even more attractive
platform for hosting a wide range of
mini-applications, known as "widg
ets," now that its users will be able
to take the same bundle of pro
grams to other Web sites. Drawn by
a potentially larger audience, devel
opers may see greater reason to cre
ate applications for Facebook.
The portability of personal pro
files also may help other top Web
sites, like Yahoo, that have struggled
to create their own social networks.
Yahoo is hoping to drum up more
advertising by featuring more social
applications from outside sources.
