## Editorial Board Stanford Med School ahead of the ethics curve 
### 
Stanford's School of Medicine has distin
guished itself in its research and its
medical care. It has again done an ad
mirable job of staying ahead of the curve,
this time in the field of ethics.
Two weeks ago. the influential Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges
(AAMC) issued guidelines urging every
medical school in the country to heavily re
strict gifts from the pharmaceutical industry
The AAMC guidelines would forbid faculty
and students from the common practices of
accepting handouts such as free travel, free
meals and the ghost-writing of academic pa
pers. Although AAMC recommendations
are non-binding, nearly all medical schools
follow them closely.
But Stanford has beaten the AAMC to
the punch. Stanford's School of Medicine
adopted similarly strict conflict-of-interest
policies in October 2006, after a University
appointed task force recommended the
changes. Although a handful of faculty
members expressed opposition, the School
of Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo, along with
Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics,
championed these new conflict-of-interest
guidelines and helped make them institu
tional policy. Their accomplishment is com
mendable, and Stanford's policies are al
ready some of the most rigorous in the
country.
The institutional changes address the ex
cessive gifts that industry provides doctors.
According to an April New York Times arti
cle regarding the AAMC's recommenda
tions:
"Drug companies spend billions wooing

doctors — more than they spend on re
search or consumer advertising. Medical
schools, packed with prominent professors
and impressionable trainees, are particularly
attractive marketing targets.
"So companies have for decades provid
ed faculty and students free food and gifts,
offered lucrative consulting arrangements
to top-notch teachers and even ghost-writ
ten research papers for busy professors."
These gifts in turn boost the pharmaceu
tical companies' bottom line. Study after
study demonstrates that these industry gifts
have some measurable effect on doctors'
prescribing habits.
The substantial costs of these outlandish
gifts make drugs more expensive for pa
tients. And doctors that accept industry gifts
— or medical students taught by professors
who accept these gifts — cannot be expect
ed to make the best, medically-sound deci
sions for their patients. By banning most
pharmaceutical gifts, Stanford is acting ethi
cally, is providing its patients with a higher
standard of medical care and is helping to fix
our country's badly broken health care sys
tem.
The medical school is currently reviewing
other ways in which industry may be influ
encing its faculty and students. A School of
Medicine Task Force on Industry Support
for Continuing Medical Education will de
liver its own findings in the coming months.
This is heartening news. We hope that Dean
Pizzo and Stanford's School of Medicine will
continue to lead the nation in eliminating
conflicts of interest from its research, teach
ing and medical care.
