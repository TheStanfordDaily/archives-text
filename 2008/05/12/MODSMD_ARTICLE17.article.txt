## How I (re)learned to ride a bike 
### 
Whoever made up that asinine cliche,
"It's like riding a bicycle to con
note a skill that we could never for
get clearly didn't do their research. Lies, I
say. All lies.
I once knew how to ride a bike. I used to
glide around my giant backyard on my hot
pink wheels with my white streamers blow
ing in the wind and my pet snail Timmy rest
ing snugly in my pink and white cross
hatched basket. Eventually, the training
wheels were removed as they are in every
young child's formative years, and I glided
onwards with Timmy in tow.
Sometime in between Timmy's death and
the onset of puberty, 1 just lost interest in rid
ing. I think I was first turned off after I saw
my cousin careen off a bike and break both
of her arms. And then I never even consid
ered biking after 1 moved to Florida, where
there's a high chance you'll get run over by
an elderly person in a 1992 Cadillac DeVille
if you cycle too far from your driveway.
The summer before I came to college, a
few of my friends tried to re-teach me to ride
a bike so that 1 could be a "real" Stanford
student. Because they were so confident that
I would remember how to ride the moment
I got on a bicycle again, they didn't listen to
my complaints that a) I was wearing flimsy
flip flops, b) we were on a sidewalk near a
busy street.c) it was pitch dark out. Needless
to say. when we gave up an hour later, all I
had learned was that my muscle memory
sucks and that I bruise really easily if I fall on
pavement repeatedly.
Contrary to my friends' concerns, my in
ability to ride a bike has never caused me
problems at Stanford. I naturally walk way
too fast. I like to interact with people. Plus, I
don't have to spend time locking and un
locking a bike, and I don't get yelled at by
that overzealous traffic dude who shouts at
people when they go the wrong way around
the intersection of death.
Although 1 don't plan on changing my
walking lifestyle. I recently realized that bik
ing is an important skill to have under my
belt, much like swimming, driving and read
ing chapter books — all of which I have
mastered.
So I called on my friend Susan, whom I've
known since kindergarten. If you have to
embarrass yourself with someone, it's best to
choose an individual who has seen you eat
paste. Anyway, Susan teaches small children
to play the violin, so I knew she'd have the
proper amount of patience to educate a not
so-small child in the art of bicycle riding.
On Saturday morning, we met up on the
residential road on the far side of Mayfield
Playficld, the smallish patch of grass across
from Haus Mitt. We started at 9:30 — too
early for sloshballers to gawk at me or bowl

me over.
It took me awhile just to get used to sit
ting on the bike. Those seats really aren't
that comfortable. Then I learned the basics.
Brakes, steering.etc. We went back and forth
along the street for almost an hour, with
Susan in front, facing me and holding on to
the handles and backing up slowly as I got
used to peddling.
My biggest problem was balancing. De
spite my political inclinations. I kept veering
right, taking poor Susan along with me. How
humiliating.
A man passed by. laughed and offered
some strange advice about pulling me from
the back with a towel? That's how he had
taught his kids, he said. Yeah, sir, unfortu
nately I don't weigh 40 pounds anymore.
Thanks, though.
He actually turned out to be sort of right.
I did a lot better when Susan started to light
ly hold on to the back of the bike, because
there was that illusion that she wasn't there
and I was, you know, actually biking. As I
grunted away, an elderly lady gracefully
hiked by. "You can do it, you can do it," I
whispered under my breath as I wiped my
sweaty hands on my jeans and glared at her
enviously.
An hour and a half had passed, and it was
getting really hot. Susan decided that the only
thing keeping me from getting it on my own
was my fear of falling. It's high up there on
that seat! So I convinced her to let me try on
the grass even though it'd be harder to pedal
there. She pushed me off and I was soaring.
Sort of. "I'm biking!" I shouted until I fell five
yards later. Susan beamed at me like a proud
parent, and then we did it one more time,
without me falling. Hello, Tour de France.
There is something wonderfully hum
bling about sucking so badly at something
and then finally getting it. How's that for an
eloquent proverb? As we get older, we are
sadly deprived of that exhilarating sense of
primitive accomplishment that we constant
ly have when we are younger. I have to say,
I'm glad that I forgot how to ride a bike...al
though my buttocks now ache every time I
sit down.
