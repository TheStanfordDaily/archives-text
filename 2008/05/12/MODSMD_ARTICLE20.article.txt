# Little Ms. Modern
## Hopelessly homesick 
### 
There is arguably no better way to irk
modern experts than to forcibly expose
them to the pop culture version of their
respective areas of expertise. Bad science, bad
cooking, bad singing and many other forms of
bad abound in our contemporary media land
scape, all of which undoubtedly do all kinds of
dangerous things for people's blood pressure.
I can only imagine the rage real chefs must
feel when Rachael Ray makes some Riceroni
knockoff and then calls it "wild mushroom
risotto." Luckily, I'm not an expert in science,
cooking or singing, so I can usually watch TV
without digging my nails into my legs.The one
exception to this is the Home and Garden
Network, whose never-ending lineup of crap
py home improvement programming drives
me unreasonably insane.
I know I should just let people have their
fun. It's really no harm done to me if middle
aged suburbanites try to spruce up their
houses with cheap spray paint and imitation
tile. But it's no use — I cannot get past the
fact that these chipper TV personalities are
perpetuating not only inexcusably bad taste,
but also, more critically, the myth that it's
easy to establish an authentic sense of home.
A home is exactly what most modern peo
ple lack, and there's certainly no easy way to
get it back. We are like fragile flowers ripped
out of our nurturing, earthy abodes, our
newly exposed roots shivering in the brisk
modern air. In some ways, it's wonderful to
be uprooted: we are no longer held back by
stagnant traditions and outdated expecta
tions. But it's impossible to gain mobility
without giving up the undeniable comfort of
familiarity Now that we have virtually limit
less geographic and intellectual wiggle room,
we have lost the sense that there is one spe
cial place where we belong.
Humans, however, have an amazing ca
pacity for imagination, and we often use this
power of pretending to make believe that the

A home is exactly
what most modern
people lack, and there's

to get it back.

modern problem of psychological homeless
ness simply doesn't exist. We cling to empty
symbols of geographic affiliation, like sports
franchises, to validate our connections to the
places we live — becoming a true Bostonian
is as simple as buying a Red Sox cap. We build
new buildings to look as if they're old, in
order to lend them a reassuring, albeit false,
sense of establishment. We convince contest
ants on home makeover TV shows that a
freshly painted red accent wall will alleviate
their yearning for an old-fashioned sense of
home, one which new paint will never create.
This sort of eager self-deception is espe
cially rampant in the United States, as almost
everyone in this melting pot of immigrants is
originally from somewhere else. This country
was made because people left their homes

and moved, and it flourished because people
continue to do so. But today, we have an infe
riority complex about our relative newness
— we are insecure about our lack of extensive
history and tradition. We are hopelessly
homesick for well-established origins that
simply don't exist.
We must therefore cope with a despera
tion that Europeans will never know. While
they effortlessly acknowledge their pasts but
focus on progress forward, we are distracted,
jealously lusting after their medieval city
walls and impressive graveyards. We struggle
to compete, and so alongside the classic
American ideal of the new, an antithetical,
and ultimately hopeless emphasis on the old
has emerged. Some of us tell ourselves that
the culture of Small Town USA will make us
happy — home is the suburb in which we
have lived all of our lives, where things have
never changed and certainly never should.
This explains the vigor with which some
Americans defend what they consider to be
traditional values — they're defending their
sense of home.
But this is a false sense, and we'll never be
satisfied if we don't acknowledge that the
old-fashioned concept of home is impossible
to achieve. Small Town USA is more than a
few hundred years old, and the newness of its
inception, is far more remarkable than the
fact that it has been around for a little while.
The pioneers and immigrants of early Amer
ica understood this far better than we do
now. Conquering the modern wilderness re
quires the same fearlessness they champi
oned. Abandoning our hopeless homesick
ness is crucial — we may never find home
again, but we'll finally be free to embark on
our adventures forward.
