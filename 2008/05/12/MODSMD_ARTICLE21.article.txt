## ROUND OF 16 AWAITS STANFORD Women's tennis travels to Tulsa, Okla. looking to win its fourth national title in five years 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two down, four to go.
Opening the 2008 NCAA Tournament
on the Farm, the No. 4 Stanford women's
tennis team punched its ticket to Hilsa,
Okla. with two wins over the weekend.
Playing in front of the home crowd, the
Cardinal women continued their domi
nance "at home.
"I definitely love playing at school and in
front of the Stanford crowd," freshman Hi
lary Barte said. "There's something electric
about the crowd. 1 could definitely feel it
turn up the intensity to another level men
tally and energy-wise for both matches."
To start off their 27th consecutive ap
pearance at the Tournament, the Cardinal
women blanked Boston University 4-0, in
quick fashion.
Barte returned to the courts in doubles,
teaming up with sophomore Lindsay Bur
dette for an 8-0 win.
Stanford would sweep doubles for a 1-0
lead.
Recovering from a strain at the Pac-10
Championships, Barte was kept out of the
singles lineup against the Terriers as a pre
cautionary measure.
"I was itching to get out there," Barte
said. "I knew we'd be playing a lot of tennis
ahead, so there was no need to rush. By
helping myself I was helping the team."
Junior Jessica Nguyen stepped in for
Barte and easily won 6-0, 6-0 against
Francine Whu. Burdette also recorded a 6-0,
6-0 victory, and freshman Carolyn McVeigh
sealed the win with a 6-1,6-2 victory.
In the match, senior Celia Durkin ap
peared to injure herself against Vanessa
Steiner. Despite the injury, Durkin led 6-4,
4-1 when play was suspended.
"Cel[ia]'s such a fighter and competitor,"
Barte said. "Even when we're practicing and
she's hurt, she doesn't tell anyone. Last year
she played the entire year with mono and
she did great.
"If she's hurt, she'll make up for it in ef
fort," Barte added.
Saturday's matchup against Texas A&M
wasn't nearly as easy as the opening round,
however.

5/10 vs. Texas A&M W 4-1

CLEMSON (ROUND OF 16)
5/15 Tulsa, OK.

GAME NOTES: Stanford hod little trouble this weekend,
only losing a single team point in its victories over
Boston University and Texos A&M. The Cardinal now
moves on to face No. 13 Clemson; if Stanford wins, it
will face the winner of the Baylor-Miami match-up. >

On the afternoon, doubles play began at
12:13 p.m. and finished at 1:55 p.m. when
Durkin and McVeigh won 9-8 (2) on Court
3.
"To watch Cel[ia] and Carolyn pull off
the win was great," Barte said. "Throughout
the season, they've been extremely clutch.
When I see them battling out and they're
the last team on. I feel confident â€” they re
ally come through when we need them to."
In singles. Barte returned to the top of
the lineup with a quick and flawless 6-0,6-2
win over Elze Potgieter.
"It felt great to get back out there and
play side by side with my teammates," Barte
said. "I look forward to more of it in Tulsa."
In fact, Barte logged only 1 hour and 42
minutes of court time, nearly the length of
Durkin and McVeigh's doubles match.
But, timing aside, the results are what
counted in the 4-1 victory over the Aggies.
"We all go out there and give it our all
every match," Barte said. "It doesn't matter
how long it takes, as long as you get it done."
After Barte's win. Durkin fell 6-2,6-1 to
Anna Blagodarova, trimming the Cardinal
lead in half.
However, McVeigh surged back for a 6-3,
6-0 win. and senior Whitney Deason
clinched the match with a 6-3,6-3 tally.
With the two wins, the Cardinal women
are now 106-12 in the postseason. They ex
tended their home win streak to 134 match
es, and have won their last 28 postseason
matches on the Farm.

Though Stanford now heads to Tulsa
along with 15 other top programs, they are
confident in their abilities to win away from
home, especially after a travel-heavy season.
"We played away a lot this season," Barte
said. "In February we were gone almost
every weekend. We're looking forward to
making Tulsa our home court for a week."
On Thursday, Stanford will face off

against No. 13 Clemson in the Round of 16.
But, currently on a nine-match win
streak, the Cardinal women are certainly
aiming for higher goals.
"We're definitely one of the top teams
vying for the national championship," Barte
said, "It's definitely going to be a battle.
We're not going to just walk through. We
have a chance but we just have to fight

hard."
Today, Stanford will head to Tulsa, where
they'll prepare for their Thursday match
against the Tigers. Starting then, the Cardi
nal will he four victories and five days away
from reclaiming the national title.
