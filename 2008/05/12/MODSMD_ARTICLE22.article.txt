### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR

two of three to rival Cal,
Stanford was able to sal
vage its weekend series
with the Golden Bears
in a big way yesterday at

slam down the right
field line was just inside
the foul poll, and gave
Stanford a 7-3 lead
which it would never re
linquish.
"I hit it well,"
Milleville said. "Right at
the last second it went
fair. I really thought it
was going to go foul.
"To get swept is

GAME NOitS: After this weekend's
action, the Cardinal now sits one
game behind Arizona State in the
Pac-10 with six games left to play on
its conference schedule. Stanford
will face Santa Clara for the fourth
time this season; it has already won
two of the three match-ups.

continued. "This is huge for us going into our last week
end series with the rest of the Pac-10.
"Cal is obviously our big rival and you never want
them to come into your house and push you around so it
was big to get a win tonight," junior Cord Phelps added.
Sophomore right hander Jeffrey Inman earned the
win after 6 and 2/3 innings of work, improving his record
to 7-2 on the year. Freshman pitcher Drew Storen came
in to close out the game's final two innings,shutting down
Cal and tallying his fifth save of the year in the process.
The No. 6 Cardinal (29-18-2,11-7 Pac-10) was able to
snap a three-game skid with the win on Sunday, keeping
the team afloat in the highly-contested race in the Pac

10. No. 3 Arizona State is currently a game up in the
standings on Stanford with a 12-6 conference record.
Though yesterday's victory certainly ended the
weekend on the right note, it did not completely over
shadow the rest of the teams series with the Golden
Bears.
Friday: Cal 4, Stanford 3
Friday's match-up was marked by both hot pitching
and tempers between the two squads, as Bears ace Tyson
Ross and Stanford junior Austin Yount were both firing
on all cylinders in a game which saw two ejections take
place on the Cal side.The Bears took a 3-1 lead into the
bottom of the ninth behind the arm of Ross before the
Cal pitcher finally succumbed to the Cardinal bats.
Freshman Colin Walsh led the inning off with a double.
Next up was junior Joey August, who drew a walk, putting
runners on first and second. A fielder's choice by junior
Jason Castro put runners on second and third, setting up
Milleville's sacrifice fly. With two outs and August still on
base, senior Randy Molina came through in the clutch
with a single up the middle, tying the game at three.
Cal came back to score in the top of the tenth inning.

however, and the Cardinal was not able to get a run on
the board in its last chance, losing by the score of 4-3.The
game ended in an unorthodox manner: Freshman Zach
Jones was called out on strikes with one out while soph
omore pinch runner Wande Olabisi was attempting to
steal second base. Jones was called for interference with
the Bears catcher, nullifying any possible steal by
Olabisi; the game was over after Olabisi was called out
on the play. Cal's Matt Gorgen got the win while Cardi
nal freshman Danny Sandbrink was charged with the
loss.
Saturday: Cal 5, Stanford 2
Saturday's afternoon game with the Bears was no
better for Stanford, as senior Erik Davis gave up three
runs in the critical top half of the seventh inning, which
gave the Bears a 4-2 lead. Cal added another run in the
eighth, making the score 5-2. which is what the final
score would be.The Bears' Craig Bennigson got the vic
tory after giving up only one run in six innings of work,
while Matt Gorgen earned his ninth save of the season.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Junior pitcher Austin Yount fired away against a Cal batter during the Cardinal's 4-3 loss to the Bears on Friday.
After its three-game series with the Golden Bears, Stanford's Pac-10 record now stands at 11-7.
It may not have been the best of
weekends for the Cardinal, but the
team was still happy to come away
with the third and final game.
"Sometimes rivalries make games
hard and this weekend's losses to
them, it was a real tough thing to swal

low," Milleville said."By winning this
last game we got ourselves on the
right foot for the rest of the season."
The Cardinal will look to main
tain the momentum from yester
day's victory when it takes on the
Santa Clara Broncos at home in the

Junior pitcher Austin Yount fired away against a Cal batter during the Cardinal's 4-3 loss to the Bears on Friday.
After its three-game series with the Golden Bears, Stanford's Pac-10 record now stands at 11-7.
It may not have been the best of
weekends for the Cardinal, but the
team was still happy to come away
with the third and final game.
"Sometimes rivalries make games
hard and this weekend's losses to
them, it was a real tough thing to swal

low," Milleville said."By winning this
last game we got ourselves on the
right foot for the rest of the season."
The Cardinal will look to main
tain the momentum from yester
day's victory when it takes on the
Santa Clara Broncos at home in the
team's last non-conference game of
the regular season. Tonight's game
begins at 6 p.m.
