GAME NOTES' Despite losing two straight
games to end the regular season, Stanford
finished with on astounding overall record of
46-12. The No. 12 overall seed in the 64-
team NCAA tournament, the Cardinal soft
ball squad is looking to go deep into this
year's postseason.

leaving Stanford alone in fourth.
After getting a terrific performance from junior pitch
er Missy Penna in Thursday's victory, Stanford's pitching
was sub-par on Friday and Saturday in the pair of losses.
The Cardinal suffered its first run-rule defeat of the sea
son Friday, falling 8-0 in six innings, and also lost Saturday
6-1.
On Friday, the game was never particularly close as
Stanford was outplayed in every facet.
Cardinal starter Ashley Chinn, a freshman, was lit up
to the tune of eight runs, 11 hits and five walks in the five
inning complete game. Chinn was not helped by the de
fense behind her. as Stanford committed three errors.
The offense fared no better, man
aging just two hits — a pair of sixth
inning singles from senior left fielder
Tricia Aggabao and sophomore cen
ter fielder Alissa Haber — as the
team was nearly held to a no-hitter.
Cardinal batters also struck out ten

times in six innings against Wildcat
ace and reigning ail-American Taryn
Mowatt.
The Wildcats were in control of
the game from the get-go as Mowatt
struck out two in the top of the first
en route to a 1-2-3 inning. In the bot
tom of the frame, Jenae Leles hit the
first of three Arizona homeruns in
the game to put the wildcats up 1-0.
They would not look back from
there, tacking on three runs each in
the second and fifth innings before

Laine Roth led off the sixth with a
solo homerun. giving the Wildcats an
eight-run lead and the run-rule vic
tory.
The Cardinal didn't look much
better the following day, dropping its
final regular season contest by the
score of 6-1.
Stanford's offense showed a little
more life on Saturday, pounding out
eight hits, including three by Haber,
but still only had one run to show for
it all.
ITie pitching and defense were
again not at their best, as Penna al
lowed seven hits, including two
homeruns, while the Cardinal de
fense committed two errors which
led to three unearned runs.
The game started off well for the
Cardinal as Wildcat centerfielder
Adrienne Acton was unable to make
a play on Haber's liner in the left
centerfield gap, allowing Haber to
pick up her first triple of the season.
Sophomore second baseman Shan
non Koplitz would then knock her in
with a sacrifice fly to right field. That
would be all the scoring the Cardinal
would muster on that day, however.
Stanford's lead did not last long
as Arizona jumped ahead 3-1 in the
bottom half of the inning on back-to
back homeruns by Leles and Roth
following a K'Lee Arredondo dou
ble. That was all the offense Mowatt
would need as she shut out the Car
dinal for the rest of the game.
The Wildcats would add three
more runs in the bottom of the fifth
after Stanford first baseman Erin
I lowe dropped a throw from Koplitz
with two outs and the bases loaded,
allowing two runs to score and the
inning to continue.
In losing the final two games of its
season, Stanford may have also lost
its shot at hosting a regional. The
Cardinal found out Sunday that al
though it is the No. 12 overall seed in
the NCAA Tournament, it will have
to travel all the way to Amherst,
Mass. for regional play.
Hie 64-team field was announced
Sunday evening and the Cardinal's
four-team regional begins this com
ing Friday.The regional field consists
of Stanford, host University of Mass
achusetts, Lehigh and Princeton.
If the Cardinal wins the regional
it will advance to the Super Region
al the following weekend.
Stanford begins play in the re
gional this Friday against Lehigh.
