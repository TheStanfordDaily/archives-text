## Rosters to keep out impostors Residence staff say lists updated too infrequently 
### PRACHI PRIYAM 
Almost a year has passed since
the University discovered that Azia
Kim was posing as a Stanford stu
dent and occupying campus housing.
In an effort to address lingering con
cerns about dormitory security, this
year's resident assistants (RAs) have
more frequently been receiving
updated emergency rosters for resi
dents in their houses.
Sue Nunan. director of Housing
Assignments, said in an email to The
Daily that printed and electronic
copies are sent to house staff twice a
quarter, one two weeks into the
quarter and another after the sixth
week.
Several members of house staff,
however, were not completely satis
fied by this system.
"The system has been really con
fusing for me, at least," said Terra
House Manager Nick Hartfield '09.
Last quarter. Hartfield did not get
the most updated version of the
Terra emergency roster until seven
weeks after classes began.
"When people ask where my
emergency roster is, I have to say I
never got one," Hartfield continued.
Hartfield had to draw up Terra's own
updated roster in case anyone asked
who was living in the house.
For Cardenal Resident Assistant
(RA) Rahul Shaikh '08, the rosters
have been a valuable resource
because he had more than four resi
dent changes in his hall during win
ter quarter alone. But Shaikh has
also had criticisms about the roster
updates. He said he only received
emergency rosters two weeks after a
new resident had moved in.
"We wouldn't know that there is
supposed to be a change in the roster
until Residential Education would
tell us," Shaikh states. "They're effec
tive when we have updated ver
sions."
"We would hear about the person
coming through either the Resident
Fellows or just word-of-mouth." he
continued, "but there is the slight
chance that someone might come in
when we have an out-dated version
of the roster, and we might not know
that they aren't supposed to be
here."
In response to these concerns, Nunan said,"lf an RA has
someone arrive on their floor that they have not been noti
fied about, they should immediately contact [the adminis
tration] and confirm that this person has been assigned to
that floor. They should not be waiting until the emergency
roster arrives to make this determination."
Rodger Whitney, executive director of Housing, told Hie
Daily in an email that the rosters are one of a series of
changes implemented since Kim was kicked out of Stanford
housing.
"There have been some organizational and system
changes since Azia Kim that have changed some proce
dures in both Housing and Residential Education," he said.
For example, RAs and house managers no longer have
access to room keys that they used to give to new students
who were moving in. The Housing department's front desk
now controls access to these keys.
Nunan also said that Stanford hopes to move to a secure
online roster system that can be accessed by RAs.
Despite concerns about kinks in the system. RAs were
generally pleased with the implementation of a roster poli
cy.
"They're very effective," Hartfield said about the emer
gency rosters. "Once this gets worked out, it will be super
secure and great."
