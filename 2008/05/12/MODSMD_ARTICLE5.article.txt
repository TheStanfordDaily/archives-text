# Classmates fight for jailed MBA
## Friends call for Jude Shao's release 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
While the Graduate School of
Business Class of '93 mingled at its 15
year reunion last weekend, classmate
Jude Shao MBA '93 remained locked in a
Shanghai jail cell.
Shao, the founder of medical equip
ment importer China Business Ventures,
has served ten years in prison for charges
of tax evasion, charges that classmates
and human rights advocates have called
unfounded. At least six legal scholars at
the People's University of China have
said Shao deserves a retrial.
Shao was detained in 1998 after tax
auditors confiscated his records to con
duct a special tax audit, and he refused to
pay what h£ interpreted as a "bribe" to
stop the investigation, according to the
Free Jude Shao Web site. He was denied
access to a lawver for 22 months, and

given one only 10 days before his trial in
Shanghai Intermediate Court No. 1 —
not enough time to obtain copies of the
documents that proved his innocence.
During the class reunion, Shao's
friends and classmates sat down to write
letters on his behalf, calling on Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice to make his
release her top priority when human
rights dialogue resumes between the U.S.
and China in the coming months.
While Shao initially attempted to gain
a retrial through the Chinese legislative
system, his appeals have been ignored.
Classmates, family members and human
rights activist John Kamm. all of whom
have worked on Shao's behalf, now
believe U.S. government negotiation is
the best option for securing his release.
"The best people can do is to keep him
in mind and keep bringing him up." said
