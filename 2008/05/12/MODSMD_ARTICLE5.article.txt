# Classmates fight for jailed MBA
## Friends call for Jude Shao's release 
### HEATHER HEISTAND STAFF WRITER 
While the Graduate School of
Business Class of '93 mingled at its 15
year reunion last weekend, classmate
Jude Shao MBA '93 remained locked in a
Shanghai jail cell.
Shao, the founder of medical equip
ment importer China Business Ventures,
has served ten years in prison for charges
of tax evasion, charges that classmates
and human rights advocates have called
unfounded. At least six legal scholars at
the People's University of China have
said Shao deserves a retrial.
Shao was detained in 1998 after tax
auditors confiscated his records to con
duct a special tax audit, and he refused to
pay what h£ interpreted as a "bribe" to
stop the investigation, according to the
Free Jude Shao Web site. He was denied
access to a lawver for 22 months, and

given one only 10 days before his trial in
Shanghai Intermediate Court No. 1 —
not enough time to obtain copies of the
documents that proved his innocence.
During the class reunion, Shao's
friends and classmates sat down to write
letters on his behalf, calling on Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice to make his
release her top priority when human
rights dialogue resumes between the U.S.
and China in the coming months.
While Shao initially attempted to gain
a retrial through the Chinese legislative
system, his appeals have been ignored.
Classmates, family members and human
rights activist John Kamm. all of whom
have worked on Shao's behalf, now
believe U.S. government negotiation is
the best option for securing his release.
"The best people can do is to keep him
in mind and keep bringing him up." said
Kamm. the founder and director of
The Dui Hua Foundation, which
works to promote human rights in
China and secure the release and
sentence reductions for non-violent
political and religious prisoners. "If a
Chinese delegation comes to
Stanford, make sure his name is
mentioned. Write to your senator,
write to your congressman and say
Jude Shao is of high priority to you."
Although Jude Shao's name has
been on the lips of many prominent
politicians, including Secretary Rice,
who raised his case in a meeting
with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang
Jiechi, the Chinese government has
refused to grant him the parole he
was eligible for two years ago.
Under Chinese law, all prisoners
— regardless of nationality — are
eligible for parole after completing
half the time of the original sen
tence, but according to the People's
Daily newspaper, in one southern
province, only one in 200 foreign

prisoners had been granted parole
compared to a 30 percent rate of
releasing Chinese nationals to
parole. Shanghai-born Shao is a nat
uralized American citizen, and has
served ten years of his original 16-
year sentence.
Kamm estimated that 5.000 for
eign nationals are currently held in
Chinese prisons, of which about 100
are American.
"China presents many great
opportunities, but there are many
risks involved. The case of Jude
Shao tells us what can happen if
things go wrong," Kamm told The
Daily.
"This discriminatory treatment is
a violation of Chinese law. China's
WTO obligations and violates inter
national human rights law since it
meets the U.N.'s definition of arbi
trary detention," said Chuck
Hoover, Shao's grad school room
mate. "We are highlighting these
violations in the hopes that the
Chinese government will decide to
follow their own law and parole
Jude."
