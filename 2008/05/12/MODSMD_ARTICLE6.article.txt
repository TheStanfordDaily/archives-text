# MEDICAL SCHOOL
## Expansion in progress for medical school, hospitals Groundbreaking held during school's centennial celebration 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
The western edge of Stanford's cam
pus is gearing up for what urban planner
Bruce Fukuji called "the most significant
construction project to take place in Palo
Alto in a very long time."
The construction project expected to
be completed first is the School of
Medicine's $90 million, 120,000 square
foot Li Ka Shing Center for Learning
and Knowledtje (CLK). The five-story

building will house education facilities,
administration offices and training pro
grams for the School of Medicine. The
complex is named after a Hong Kong
businessperson who has donated more
than $1.1 billion dollars to charity over
the past several years, including more
than $30 million to Stanford.
The School of Medicine broke ground
for the limestone and glass building at
the site of the former Fairchild
Auditorium on April 25 during the
School of Medicine's centennial celebra
tion.
"It's clearly just time to build facilities
that are in keeping with medicine in the
21st Century," said School of Medicine
Director of Media Relations Ruthann
Richter. "That's the motivation for the
[Medical Center] project."
Stanford will also break ground this
summer on a new Stem Cell Research
Center. The 200,000 square foot building
will stand four stories tall at the south
end of the medical school on Campus
Drive. Following the reception of a $43.6
million grant from the California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine,
Stanford committed to raising the
remainder of the building's $200 million
cost, mostly from private donations.
Stanford is also spending an estimat
ed $2 billion dollars to expand and
upgrade the Stanford Medical Center,
including the Stanford Hospital and
Clinics and the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital. The Stanford
Shopping Center, furthermore, has a
240,000 square foot addition planned
and a 120 room hotel.
Both the Hospital and Shopping
Center expansions are still in the plan
ning and approval phases. Because the
proposed hospital expansion exceeds
the existing Palo Alto zoning and height
restrictions, its development must be
approved by a majority of the nine
member Palo Alto City Council.
Councilwoman and former Palo Alto

Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto MBA '79 was
largely supportive of the new plans,
especially the accommodation of envi
ronmentally friendly innovations.
"Overall I was very encouraged by
last week's presentation," she said of a
hearing held last Monday. "If we can't
achieve our goals of reducing green
house gasses, who can?"
Deputy City Manager Steve Emslie,
who advises the council, told The Daily
that ultimate approval was "very proba
ble" despite exceptional building specifi
cations.
Palo Alto currently has a 50 foot
height limit on all new buildings, and the
proposed hospital plan includes two 130
foot towers. Palo Alto also limits "build
ing coverage" — that is. the total ground
area of a site occupied by any building
— and the University's proposal
exceeds the city's building coverage
standards.
"Because they're exceeding the stan
dards. we look for exceptional circum
stances, what are their space needs, other
industry standards, and how health care
is provided," Emslie said.
He added that traffic is another con
cern for the City Planning Office.
"It's a matter of being very clear
about what the impacts are" Emslie
said. "Primarily in the area of traffic.

[we're] looking for ways to reduce vehi
cle trips to and from the site."
The 130 foot towers did not appeal to
some members of the City Council who
were eager to preserve Palo Alto's sky
line.
"I'm not very happy with the height
extension that the hospital wants," said
Councilman Jack Morton. "Having two
large towers is sort of inconsistent with
the kind of buildings that our communi
ty values."
Morton said that Stanford's tradition
of building within city limitations was
endangered by the University's new
building strategy.
"Stanford sneezes and everyone says
bless you," he said. "Stanford uses [the
hospital's world class reputation] to beat
people about the head."
"Stanford will pack city hall with lit
erally hundreds of people who all say
Stanford is wonderful therefore they
should be able to do whatever they
want," he continued. "Stanford is very
heavy-handed in its negotiations."
Morton said that the council hopes
that some percentage of the finished
hospital's employees can be housed at
Stanford to minimize commuting.
There are yet more plans for that
aspect of the project. Although no for
mal proposals have been made, two

plots near Hoover Pavilion have been
approved by Santa Clara County for 350
housing units over 14.2 acres, the Palo
Alto Weekly reported last week.
Faced with several billion dollars of
new facilities bringing thousands of new
employees to the area, Palo Alto City
officials are eager to integrate the
improved areas into the city.
At last week's planning meeting, City
Council members pushed Stanford plan
ners to design an overall plan with a "vil
lage feel" where people would be
encouraged to walk instead of drive
from place to place. A smaller-scale feel
and design is expected to lessen the traf
fic and environmental impacts of the
upcoming expansions.
By creating several connected pedes
trian zones and public meeting places,
the city hopes to link the medical school,
hospital and shopping center with Palo
Alto's transit points and downtown area.
The individual projects are loosely
planned together, yet still allow a great
deal of autonomy for the individual
buildings.
"We obviously work very collabora
tively, but each project has its own time
table." Richter said.
