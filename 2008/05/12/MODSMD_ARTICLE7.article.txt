# Conquered by Troy: Water polo falls short
## No. 2 Stanford's season comes to close vs. USC 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
and sophomore Kelly Eaton scored for the
Card. Two more scores from Stanford before
the end of the third effectively put the game
on ice. The only question: Could the Cardinal
pitch a shutout?

Even though UCLA was the heavy
favorite coming into the weekends NCAA
Championship Tournament, the Stanford
women's water polo team still believed they
could knock the Bruins off. The Cardinal hail
played them extremely close in two games
earlier this season, and with the tournament
being played at Avery Stadium, it seemed like
the third time could be a charm.
Alas, Stanford never even got the chance,
losing to a familiar foe in Southern California
in the semifinals. The team did end the season
on a positive note, though, capturing third
place after beating UC-Davis.
The Card started off the tournament with
a first round match-up against seventh-seed
ed Marist. Although Stanford was heavily
favored to advance, the Red Foxes played the
Cardinal even for most of the first quarter.
Junior Heather West scored the game's first
goal with 1:50 left in the opening period, but
heading into the second quarter the score was
just 1-0 to Stanford.
The Card got three more goals in quick
succession in the second quarter while still
keeping Marist off the board to make the
halftime score 4-0.

it was already 6-0 as freshman Allie Gerrity

As Stanford scored four more goals to
take a 12-0 lead, it looked as if they might get
their first shutout since 2003. Marist kept
fighting though, and eventually was able to
get on the board with 50 seconds left.

Nevertheless, it was still a dominant effort
from Stanford, who gave up the least amount
of goals in a game since 2005.
The 12 Cardinal goals were scored by nine
different players, as Eaton, senior Jackie
Gauthier and junior Lolo Silver each scored a
pair. Freshman goalkeepers Amber Oland
and Kim Hall stopped 14 shots between them
in the cage for Stanford.
In the semifinals, the Card faced a familiar
nemesis in USC — in four matches this sea
son the Cardinal and the Women of Troy had
produced four nail-biters.
With a shot at the national championship
on the line, it looked like the large crowd on
hand was in store for another classic. The
game's first goal came about halfway through
the first quarter, courtesy of Gauthier.
It looked like the Card would keep the
advantage heading into the second period,
but USC's Veronika Bartunkova scored with
just five seconds remaining to knot things up.
Tilings began to heat up in the second
period. Oland had to make a point-blank stop
just over a minute in, but at the 6:04 mark
USC got past her for a 2-1 lead. Stanford
answered with two six-on-five scores, one
from junior Megan May and one from junior
Kira Hillman. However, USC regained the
lead once again with two more goals before
halftime to put the score at 4-3.

with her second goal for Southern Cal, but
Eaton halved the deficit for the Card on
another six-on-five score. With the score at 5-

Stanford's run for the national title ended on Saturday with the team's 10-6 loss to USC. The Card
bounced back yesterday, however, beating UC-Davis, 15-7, to capture third place honors in the process.
4, it looked as if the two teams that
could not be separated all season
were going down to the wire again.
At that point though, the wheels
came off for the Cardinal. USC
scored the game's next four goals —
three of them coming on extra-at
tacker situations — and suddenly
Stanford found itself down 9-4 with
five and a half minutes left in the
game.
West pulled one back for the
Card, but USC's Michelle Stein
sealed the outcome with her third
goal of the match. Silver would con
vert a 5-meter shot with three sec

onds left in the game, but it was only
a consolation goal. USC moved on to
the championship game, where they
would lose to UCLA as the Bruins
topped off their undefeated season
with a 6-3 victory on Sunday.
Although the team was out of the
running for the championship, Stan
ford still had the third place game on
Sunday against fifth-seeded UC-
Davis; it was clear from the start that
the Card was ready to take out its
anger from the previous day's loss on
the Aggies.
Stanford tallied six goals in the
first period alone, as many as it
scored the entire game against USC.
The team would add four more in the
second period, taking a 10-5 lead into
halftime. After shutting out Davis 2-
0 in the third period, the game was
basically in the bag, and the Cardinal

cruised to a 15-7 victory to earn third
place.
Even though the season ended up
being trophy-less for the Card, it
does not reflect the type of year the
team had. The squad finished with a
27-5 record, was ranked in the top
three the whole year, and overall
played some great water polo.
"I'm so proud of everything this
team has done this season and in
the previous three years," said
Gauthier, a departing senior.
"We've lost before but that's not
what we remember. We remember
the wins we've had, the fun times in
practice, the competition and the
family that we've built throughout
this season."
