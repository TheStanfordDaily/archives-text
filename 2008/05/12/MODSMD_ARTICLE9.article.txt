## Over 20 dead in Missouri, Oklahoma, Georgia after new round of storms Tornadoes DEVASTATE MISSOURI 
### ROXANA HEGEMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SENECA. Mo. ( AP) — Stunned survivors
picked through the little that was left of their
communities Sunday after tornadoes tore
across the Plains and South, killing at least 22
people in three states and leaving behind a trail
of destruction and stories of loss.
At least 15 people died in southwestern
Missouri. In the fading mining town of Picher,
Okla.. at least six people were killed, and at
least one person died in storms in Georgia.
Susan Roberts,6l,stared at the smashed re
mains of her classic 1985 Cadillac sitting on her
living room floor - the only thing left of her
Seneca home. A woman who had apparently
sought shelter in the car died there, she said.
"That is what is tearing me up." Roberts
said. She had warned the woman - who stopped
to change a tire as Roberts and her 13-year-old
grandson drove away from the rental house - to
escape.The tornado hit just minutes later.
"I'm from Kansas. I grew up watching
storms." she said as she walked through the de
bris. "If I didn't have my grandson with me, I
probably wouldn't have left."
The same storm system earlier hit Okla
homa. where at least six people died and 150
people were injured in Picher.
The town, once a bustling mining center of
20,0(X) that dwindled to about 8(X) people as
families fled lead pollution there, was a surreal
scene of overturned cars, smashed homes and
mattresses, and twisted metal high stuck in the
canopy of trees.
"I swear I could see cars floating," said Her
man Hernandez. 68. "And there was a roar,
louder and louder."
Ed Keheley was headed to town to help out
Saturday night when he heard a woman
screaming. He looked over to see her hand
reaching out of debris.
"She was sitting in the bathtub, she had
curlers in her hair and she wanted out of

there," said Keheley, who along with several
others pulled her out.
The area is part of a Superfund site, and res
idents have been asked to take part in state and
federal buyouts in recent years.
"From what I've been able to determine,
that wouldn't have any bearing on whether a
disaster declaration would come forth," said
Federal Emergency Management Agency
spokesman Earl Armstrong.
One storm victim's child was initially re
ported dead, but state emergency manage
ment spokeswoman Michelann Ooten later
said the infant was actually alive at a Tulsa hos
pital.
As the system moved east on Sunday, one
of at least six tornadoes in Georgia killed a per
son in Dublin, about 120 miles southeast of At
lanta, the National Weather Service said.
The small town of Kite was destroyed by
the storm, said Caroline Pope, a spokeswoman
for the Johnson County Sheriff s Department.
Close to I,(XX) people live in the community,
she said.
"From what they're telling me, it's gone,"
she said from the dispatch center in the jail,
which was operating on a generator because
the power was out.
Storms later Sunday in North Carolina de
stroyed several mobile homes, and six people
were slightly injured, said Patty McQuillan of
the state police. And in South Carolina, a pos
sible tornado damaged several homes, but no
injuries were reported, said Charleston Coun
ty spokeswoman Jennie Davis.
President Bush has talked with governors
to express his condolences for the lives lost and
to discuss needs for recover)', according to the
White House.
"The federal government will be moving
hard to help," Bush said.
In Missouri, the tornado hit the rural area
about eight miles north of Seneca and contin
ued east.
Jane Lant climbed over splintered wood to

go through the mud-caked remains of her
bridal shop.
"I just feel so awful, going through this rub
ble when they are out looking for bodies," she
said as she motioned to the search dogs wan
dering the field behind her. An unidentified
body lay under a blue tarp nearby.
Among the dead were five family members
of her neighbor who had been going to a wed
ding when the tornado caught their vehicle in
front of her store, she said.
Next door, her husband's feed store also lay

in shambles. But one bright moment came
Sunday when rescuers heard chirping from the
mound and found a half-dozen chicks. They
had rescued about 100 the night before.
Susie Stonner. spokeswoman for the state
Emergency Management Agency, said it was
unclear how many homes had been damaged.
But she said officials in Newton County, which
includes Seneca, had initial estimates of 50
homes damaged or destroyed there.
In storm-weary Arkansas, a tornado caused
significant damage in Stuttgart, but no one was

seriously injured, said Weather Service mete
orologist Joe Goudsward.
Tornadoes killed 13 people in Arkansas on
Feb. 5. and another seven were killed in an out
break May 2. In between was freezing weath
er, persistent rain and river flooding that dam
aged homes and has slowed farmers in their
planting.
