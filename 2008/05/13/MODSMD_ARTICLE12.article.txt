# ADMINISTRATION
## Officials stand by online copyrights 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Copyright complaints at univer
sities tend to center on student file
sharing of films and music — but a
recent case has brought attention to
abuses in academic contexts.
Three publishers recently filed a
lawsuit in Atlanta District Court
against Georgia State University
(GSU), alleging "pervasive, flagrant
and ongoing" violations relating to
online uploads of material for stu
dents. Professors are accused of
intentionally violating copyright to
provide the material more cheaply
to students.
At Stanford, professors also
make heavy use of Coursework,
the campus' online class resource,
and course readers to distribute
copyrighted material. Lauren
Schoenthaler, staff counsel in the
Office of the General Counsel,
explained via email the measures
in place on Coursework to prevent
copyright infringement.
"Coursework has functionality
built into the software to consider
copyright issues before uploading
content," Schoenthaler said. "llie
course administrators should only
be uploading to the site if use of the
content is within the fair use doc
trine of copyright law, or if permis
sion has been obtained. Permission
is often obtained through paying a
royalty and securing a limited
license. Coursework has an embed
ded link to the Copyright Clearance
Center, a permissions clearing
house, to request permission when
appropriate."
"In theory, when you are looking
at material on Coursework. it has
been vetted," she added.
Schoenthaler explained that this
policy fit with a commitment from
the Provost's office to ensuring
copyright compliance.
"The Provost issues an annual
Copyright Reminder each year,
which provides an overview of
copyright law and asks that all
members of the Stanford communi
ty respect copyright law."
Schoenthaler said.
Schoenthaler emphasized that
efforts are ongoing to make use of
already-existing copyright permis
sions through University libraries.

as integration can reduce costs for
courses and provide more access to
material.
"Stanford University Libraries
has paid for more than 10,000
licenses to digitized content, and
Coursework supports directly link
ing to content through SUL." she
said.
Schoenthaler added that steps
are in place to prevent a similar
incident to the one at GSU.
"Stanford's Copyright Reminder
provides that if permission is need
ed to include content in a print
coursepack, then it's likely that a
license is needed to include that
content in an electronic version of
the coursepack." Schoenthaler said.
Violations similar to the ones at
GSU have not been a problem at
Stanford.
"There are no flagrant violations
of copyright law that 1 have been
made aware of," Schoenthaler said.
"In the instances that have been
brought to my attention so far, edu
cation has resolved the issues."
Such violations would result in
significant consequences.
"Were such a case to arise, it is a
violation of both University policy
and the law to engage in such con
duct," Schoenthaler said. "An inten
tional violation of law could result
in employment action up to and
including termination."
The economics behind rising fees
for copyrighted material, which
contributes to the environment that
leads to copyright infringement, are
largely beyond campus control.
"They're entirely a function of
the publisher, and the price they set
for intellectual property," said Ken
Bowers, director of stores at the
Stanford Bookstore. "Publishers are
the gatekeepers for those fees."
"It's one of those ongoing things
that is like the price of textbooks in
general." he added. "It's one of
those same issues."
Negotiations over costs and
copyright often occur outside of the
view of students.
"There's a value perception issue
there," Bowers said. "It's often diffi
cult to understand on the part of a
student."
