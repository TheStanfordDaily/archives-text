## Sick Sad World Some great expectations 
### 
If you've seen me in the past cou
ple weeks, you've probably no
ticed that my pectorals are
swollen. You likely also noted my
skin's rosy glow and my more fre
quent trips to the ol' watering hole.
And whether you've crossed my
path or not, I'm sure you've noticed
that I've missed my last two weekly
column cycles.
What unites these disparate snip
pets of information? Well, if you
couldn't guess, I'm expecting! A
child!
No, I haven't yet convinced a
womb-equipped human to bear the
fruit of my loins. My imaginary girl
friend barely tolerates my presence,
and I'm sure that the moment 1
broach the topic of making mini-mes
she'd bolt for the door as fast as she
did when I mentioned the idea of co
writing a Broadway adaptation of
Dostoyevsky's "Notes From the Un
derground." And no, we've not yet
reached the advanced age when men
can — a la the Governator in "Ju
nior" — inject themselves with "Ex
pectane" in order to be part of an in
cisive and poignant 109 minute ex
ploration of how men would feel if
they were the ones who got preg
nant.
The explanation of my morning
sickness and nausea is the impending
arrival of my nephew(s) or niece(s).
In a matter of months. I will be the
proud uncle to one or more small liv
ing creatures bearing, on average, a
quarter of my genetic material, and
I'm psyched!
Maybe he/she/zie will have my
charming smile, my deep brown eyes
or my uncanny ability to recite ver
batim the script of "The Big Lebows
ki." Maybe it will be that squash part
ner! s) I 've been seeking for so long.
But wait, what if s/h/zie enters the
world, not with a subset of my few
positive characteristics, but instead
with a lion's share of my innumer
able flaws? I got 99 problems but a
kid ain't one! Maybe, through no
fault of my own. this child or group
thereof will have my intractable love
handles, chronically sharp pitch and
continual inability to ever be consid
ered smarter than a fifth grader.
What will 1 do then?
Now that I think about it. I'm not

sure I'm ready to take this step in my
life. I feel like it was just yesterday
that I was taking safaris in Namibia
without a care in the world except
not getting caught importing ivory
for 87 keys of my piano (middle C is
made of blood diamonds). Today, I'm
pondering my mortality and self-lim
itations as 1 sit on the brink of wel
coming the next batch of Sridharans
to this world.
In fact, with all due respect to the
parties involved. I'm a little miffed
that no one consulted me in this deci
sion-making process. Am I not an
equal participant in the sacred union
of my brother and his wife? Doesn't
what they choose to do with their
bodies affect me as much if not more
than it does both of them? In a cou
ple months when that head crests,
won't I be there in spirit but thou
sands of miles away in the flesh be
cause I have another engagement
that I'm just not sure I can get out of
because 1 planned it a long time ago
and I don't want to be one of those
people who flakes just because?
I guess that when I take a serious
look at my life these days, it troubles
me to think that a new generation is
already on my heels. I'm in law
school, but I don't know why. My fi
nances are in the red. and 1 can't
imagine them ever going black —
though if they do, I doubt they'll ever
go back. I'm more than a quarter
century old. and the longest relation
ship I've ever had was with my mom,
who stopped speaking to me 13 years
ago after she gave up any hope of me
turning out any better.
Basically. I'm a scared and naive
kid, and the world right now seems
like a blooming, buzzing confusion.
Maybe my nephew(s)/niece(s) and I
can do a little growing up together.
