## The 						trap of PowerPoint 
### 
In a recent Bio 43 lecture, the fol
lowing equation appeared at the
bottom of a PowerPoint slide ex
plaining "Offspring Genotype Fre
quencies": Q'=l/2*2PQ+2PR+( 1/2)
02+(l/2)20R=2(P+l/2Q)(R+l/20)
=2pq. As the professor waved his
laser pointer around and explained
the slide, filled with variables and
other equations, I took a look around
to see if other students were as unen
gaged as I was. A roomful of blank
stares, tapping pencils and busy Face
book checkers indicated that very
few of us were processing or benefit
ing from anything the professor was
saying. By the time I tuned back into
the prof, the next slide was up, this
one filled with more charts and equa
tions.
1 thought to myself,"lt's cool, the
lecture will be posted on Course
work. and I can look through it
later." Upon further reflection. I de
cided it wasn't cool at all. What is the
point of sitting in I lewlett for an hour
when 1 II have to go over it all by my
self later? Lecture should be a time
of quality explanation of concepts,
and out-of-class work should be for
re-familiarization of those concepts.
Something tells me that, not long
ago. this was how things worked at
college. But this isn't how it works
anymore, and I think this is largely
the fault of professors' dependency
on PowerPoint. So far this year, I
have taken the following classes that
used PowerPoint as the primary lec
ture tool: Advanced French Gram
mar.Chem 31A and Band Bio 43. All
of these classes, however, require
writing and derivations that simply
cannot be presented effectively on a
slide. When a prof takes the time to
write on a board, students are able to
visualize the logic of equations and
the structure of sentences. It also
forces the class to move at a pace
conducive to note taking.

Lectures that don't depend on
PowerPoint are typically more en
gaging, as well. I hear that Robert
Sapolsky just gets up and talks dur
ing his Human Behavior Biology
class — sans PowerPoint — and
that's supposed to be one of the most
interesting classes on campus! In my
own class schedule. I have encoun
tered very few professors who either
1) don't use PowerPoint or 2) use it
effectively. Only Econ 50 with Ran
Abrainitzky gives me hope that
some profs can overcome Power-
Pointlessness. He used a tablet lap
top, and his slides contained a title
and some x andy axes. Then he filled
everything in as he spoke.
My observation is that professors
who use PowerPoint tend to load a
lot of text and graphs onto their
slides, post the slides on Coursework
and call that a lecture. 1 ask you, fel
low students, to not settle for such
half-ass teaching. There is something
you can do. and that is give feedback.
Shoot a quick email to your prof or
head Teaching Assistant and men
tion that you would appreciate on
the-board explanations. Mention
these issues in your end-of-quarter
evaluations. Our professors are cer
tainly capable of teaching in differ
ent ways — they just have to know
the demand is there. I sent one email
to the head Bio 43 TA, and, the next
day, the professor mentioned in class,
"I know that these equations don't
mean much to you like this on the
slide, but go home and practice and
you'll get it." Obviously that wasn't
the response I was looking for, but it
was a start. What if more people sent
emails and spoke up? Save Stanford
from the infectious PowerPoint
trend. Otherwise, you're being
gypped of time, money and respect.
