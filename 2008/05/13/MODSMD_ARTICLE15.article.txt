# Stu's Views
## Pearls of wisdom 
### 
OK, fine, I'll admit it. I couldn't
think of a compelling column
topic for this week. So instead
of my usual pearls of wisdom on a
single topic, I present to you six col
umn topics that I thought about be
fore giving up entirely and writing
about all of them at once.
1. I read The Daily's story on its
annual journalism awards this morn
ing and was charmed to read that a
"Coop" commented, "No award for
Stuart Baimel? That's insane." It is in
sane, folks. If my beloved and
staunchly loyal readers want to or
chestrate an incensed letter-writing
campaign to The Daily to write me a
four (or five!) figure check, they have
my full support. Otherwise, there's al
ways next year. I thought about writ
ing a compelling case for myself as a
check recipient due to my coura
geous opposition to Ron Paul and
Admit Weekend, but thought the bet
ter of it.
I could even make a template for
potential letter-writers, just like
those incredibly annoying TSF tem
plates.
2. The Draw might be the most
dramatic phase of the Stanford cal
endar. The people you can't stand get
into Grove; you get into Robinson.

Sucks.This week, I toyed with award
ing the Draw the dreaded "insane"
moniker but backed away from it, for
now. Not only would that be a rather
predictable maneuver, but it would
n't really help me erase the pain of
my Draw number. If the Draw com
puter is reading this, hopefully it real
izes 1 haven't been mean yet, and it
places me into Jerry.
3. One friend suggested that, in
stead of writing critiques and giving
them gaudy adjectives, 1 should write
a positive column about something I
like. I don't like many things, obvi
ously. So I thought about writing an
"All These Things Are Sane" column
describing my favorite things —
schadenfreude, T.S. Eliot, Chinese
food, democracy. But would anyone
outside my (admittedly enormous)
fan club and maybe my mom want to
read that? (Hi Mom!) Doubt it.
4. I've noticed that, when reading

emails or online comments about my
articles, most people call me "Stu,"
not "Stuart." I admittedly called my
self "Stu" so it would rhyme, but few
people in real life have ever called
me Stu. Most admittedly, my awe
some eighth-grade math teacher did.
the one who had frequent open
book. open-note group tests. He was
pretty cool.
Yeah,so that column idea was sort
of a non-starter. Moving on.
5.1 thought about the increasing
ly burdensome email situation on
campus. Students seem to think that
repeatedly emailing the same list
will get students to go. If I see an
event to which I don't want to go, an
other 20 emails advertising the same
event won't get me to go. If an event
speaks louder, does it attract more
students? Sometimes I find myself
wishing that events had a two email
maximum; I received 15 emails ad
vertising the Stanford Powwow over
a two-week period. They must mean
business.
6. My default topic is Hillary and
Obama. We're finally at a point
where we are seeing the beginning of
the end of the Democratic nomina
tion process. As to where it goes from
here, no one knows. We do know that

the nomination process will never be
like this again. Barack Ohama will
exit the primaries battered and
bruised.
Clearly this has been a week of
writer's block. Maybe 1 should get
some treatment for that. Anyone
want to write a guest column?
