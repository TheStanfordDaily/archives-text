## Wyndam Makowsky Bonds' bat still intrigues 
### 
The biggest name in baseball is a
man without a team: the incom
parable Barry Bonds.
As the season begins to hit its stride.
Bonds, one of the most elite hitters of all
time, remains on the market — un
wanted.
We all know why: steroid allega
tions against him carry an enormous
cloud wherever he goes. He is notori
ously demanding, and, needless to say,
is reportedly not the greatest team
mate. He is a danger to team chemistry
and morale.
But while he is a potential "intangi
bles" nightmare, he is still a statistical
monster who, as an offensive weapon,
would be an asset to any team.
Simply put. do the positives out
weigh the negatives? And. if so, why is
Bonds still sitting at home?
Put aside the brouhaha surrounding
Bonds (I know — that's quite a chal
lenge) and look at the extraordinary
numbers the left fielder has compiled
over his career. In an average 162 game
season. Bonds smacks 41 home runs, a
pace that led him to the home run
record. Even at age 43, he has hardly
slowed down: in only 126 games last
season, he hit 28 home runs, which
translates to an extrapolated average of
36 over a full season.
Many point to his success as a by
product of steroid usage.That's fine; its
a legitimate concern, and one I sincere
ly share. I still find his power, especially
at such a comparatively old age. to be
impressive.
But what may be more notable is his
eye at the plate — a skill that steroids
cannot enhance. Too many adjectives
bring down the quality of one's work,
but superlatives are necessary in this
case: Bonds possesses t he best eye of his
generation.
Those who watched him saw his
steadfast patience at the plate. A ball a
fraction of an inch off the comer — a
pitch that nearly any hitter would swing
at — wouldn't even draw a flinch from
Bonds.
Since 1992, Bonds has lead the Na
tional League in walks 12 times. His
career on-base percentage is a mind
boggling .444. In 2004, at the age of 40.
he was on base .609 percent of the time
— this in a sport where reaching base
four out of every 10 times is deemed
all-star worthy. Bonds did it at will.
