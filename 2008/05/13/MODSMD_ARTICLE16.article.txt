## Wyndam Makowsky Bonds' bat still intrigues 
### 
The biggest name in baseball is a
man without a team: the incom
parable Barry Bonds.
As the season begins to hit its stride.
Bonds, one of the most elite hitters of all
time, remains on the market — un
wanted.
We all know why: steroid allega
tions against him carry an enormous
cloud wherever he goes. He is notori
ously demanding, and, needless to say,
is reportedly not the greatest team
mate. He is a danger to team chemistry
and morale.
But while he is a potential "intangi
bles" nightmare, he is still a statistical
monster who, as an offensive weapon,
would be an asset to any team.
Simply put. do the positives out
weigh the negatives? And. if so, why is
Bonds still sitting at home?
Put aside the brouhaha surrounding
Bonds (I know — that's quite a chal
lenge) and look at the extraordinary
numbers the left fielder has compiled
over his career. In an average 162 game
season. Bonds smacks 41 home runs, a
pace that led him to the home run
record. Even at age 43, he has hardly
slowed down: in only 126 games last
season, he hit 28 home runs, which
translates to an extrapolated average of
36 over a full season.
Many point to his success as a by
product of steroid usage.That's fine; its
a legitimate concern, and one I sincere
ly share. I still find his power, especially
at such a comparatively old age. to be
impressive.
But what may be more notable is his
eye at the plate — a skill that steroids
cannot enhance. Too many adjectives
bring down the quality of one's work,
but superlatives are necessary in this
case: Bonds possesses t he best eye of his
generation.
Those who watched him saw his
steadfast patience at the plate. A ball a
fraction of an inch off the comer — a
pitch that nearly any hitter would swing
at — wouldn't even draw a flinch from
Bonds.
Since 1992, Bonds has lead the Na
tional League in walks 12 times. His
career on-base percentage is a mind
boggling .444. In 2004, at the age of 40.
he was on base .609 percent of the time
— this in a sport where reaching base
four out of every 10 times is deemed
all-star worthy. Bonds did it at will.
And he still does: last year, despite
playing in 36 fewer games than he could
have, he led the MLB in bases on balls
and OBP and was atop the NL leader
board in OPS and OPS+.
Bonds has shown few signs of slow
ing down offensively. He is practically
guaranteed to get on base in nearly half
of his plate appearances. It is simple:
Bonds remains one of the most lethal
hitting threats in the league. He is a
powerhouse, despite all the sideshows

and shadows.
But the distractions are at the top of
a list of reasons why he has yet to be
signed.
During his last few years in San
Francisco, the Giants were never the
story: Bonds was. Young phenoms like
Tim Lincecum and Matt Cain were
overshadowed by the never-ending
melodrama that the Bonds story had
become.
Bonds would invariably bring that
with him wherever he might go from
here — he is the man the media loves to
hate, and the coverage would be con
stant.
Furthermore. Bonds is used to luxu
ry, even more so than the normal base

ball player. His corner in the Giants'
clubhouse with a personal big screen
television and recliner became some
thing of lore, and another knock against
Bonds. Would his sense of entitlement
carry over to his new team?
Lastly, he is still demanding an eight
figure contract from potential suitors,
which is reasonable when measured
against his play, but, in the context of the
whole situation, may not be. As hell
only be playing, at best at this point,
two-thirds of the season, it may be too
high a price for the vast majority of
teams to pay.
So. will Bonds be signed this year?
It's hard to predict: National League
teams may be scared off because of his

defensive decline in left field, even
though his offensive numbers would
seem to more than make up for it. At
this point in his career, though, he is best
suited for a designated hitter's role.
Bottom-feeders and solidly middle
of-the-pack teams have little incentive
to sign him, since they won't make the
playoffs anyway, thus making the sign
ing an irrelevant waste of money.
That leaves only a couple sets of
teams: the juggernauts and the con
tenders. Many of the former — the
Boston Red Sox, for example — al
ready have established DHs. But there
are a few squads on the cusp of playoff
contention that do not. The Tampa Bay
Rays, for instance, are competing this

year, but there are many questions
about their ability to win down the
stretch. Bonds may fit there. Or in Min
nesota with the Twins. Maybe even in
New York, with the Yankees.
There certainly are possibilities out
there for Bonds to come in as a late sea
son addition. But while teams will sali
vate at the production he will bring to
the squad, they will need to be able to
overlook his tumultuous past and turn a
blind eye to the media uproar that
would ensue.
