### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's tennis team's
season ended on Sunday with a loss to
No. 13 Pepperdine in the second round
of the NCAA Tournament. The No. 22
Cardinal's bid for an upset fell short in
a 4-2 loss to the Waves in Malihu. Calif.
The match started out with all the
momentum in Stanford's favor. The
team played one of its best doubles
points all season, winning convincing
ly at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles to secure
the point. At No. 1, juniors Blake
Muller and Matt Bruch beat No. 24-
ranked Andre Begemann and Omar
Altmann, 8-4. while sophomore
Richard Wire and freshman Greg Hir
shman won at No. 3 doubles over
James Lemke and Mahmoud Kamel.
With Stanford up 1-0 after the
break and only needing three out of
six singles victories to move on. Pep
perdine came out firing. They jumped
ahead at No. 1 and 2 singles very
quickly and never looked back.
"We were really excited about
[doubles]." said head coach John
Whitlinger. "We played a good dou
bles point. Everybody played the way
they were capable of playing."
Freshman Alex Clayton, Stan
ford's leader in singles victories this
year, fell to No. 11-ranked Begemann,
6-0, 6-3. Whitlinger described Bege
mann's play simply, calling it "incredi
ble." Bruch, a two-time Pac-10 individ
ual champion, was quickly bested by
No. 37 Bassam Beidas, 6-0,6-4. Senior
Phil Kao lost to Kamel. 7-5, 6-0, and
Pepperdine was up 3-1.
Muller then won at No. 4 singles to
cut the lead to 3-2 after earning a
straight sets victory over Lemke, 6-4,
6-0.
The final two singles matches both
went to three sets. Stanford would
need to win both of those matches to
move on.
