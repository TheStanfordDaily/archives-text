# CARD ROCKS BRONCOS

### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After last weekend, Stanford baseball
needed a winning streak in the worst way. One
day after just avoiding a sweep at home —
breaking its streak of 12-straight three-game
series wins and dropping out of the top 10 —
the Cardinal (30-18-2) welcomed Santa Clara
(32-19) to Sunken Diamond for the season fi
nale between the two South Bay schools and
the final regular-season home game for Stan
ford.
The Broncos had lost the first two meetings
before edging the Cardinal 10-9 in Santa Clara
two weeks ago, but they came into Monday
fresh off a sweep of Saint Mary's and were 6-2
since they last faced the Cardinal. Stanford
had a taken a different road, going 4-4 while
sliding in the rankings from No. 3 to 14.
Early in the game, both teams seemed to
continue on their respective paths. The Bron
cos put up four runs in the third inning,capital

izing on a throwing error by freshman third
baseman Zach Jones and getting a few singles
together off junior starter Max Fearnow and
senior reliever David Stringer.
Meanwhile, Broncos starter Justin Kuhen
was cruising, allowing just one hit and no runs
through the first three innings. The Cardinal
men found their bats in the fourth, though,and
it was all Stanford from then on.
Junior Brent Milleville led off the inning
with a homer — his third in four days — to
make it 4-1. Senior Randy Molina batted next
and drew a walk, bringing junior Sean Ratliff
to the plate. After being shut down by the
Bears all weekend, Ratliff broke out and
smoked his 16th homer to make it 4-3. Kuhen
settled down and escaped the inning, but his
night was over.
Santa Clara went to its bullpen in the fifth,
bringing in Alex Rivers. Unfortunately for
Rivers, the fifth has been Stanford's inning all
year.

u NOiES: Stanford baseball hopes it has started a new
winning streak after falling in the rankings all the way from
No. 3 to No. 14 in recent weeks and dropping two of
three against Cal this The Cardinal's bats were
red hot against the Broncos last night, as homers from
Castro, Ratliff and Milleville helped propel Stanford to its
second win in a row.

three-run home run from junior Jason Castro,
to make it 6-4. Rivers then struck out Ratliff,
but Jones delivered a bases-loaded two-RBI
double to make it 8-4. Rivers was then pulled
for Matt Rcnner. but the Cardinal was not fin
ished yet. as junior Joey August added a two-
RBI single to make it 10-4 Stanford.
"It is amazing the way these hitters always
get their bats coins," said Stringer. "We have a

huge amount of confidence in all of them, and
it is always enjoyable to watch them rounding
the bases."
With the seven-run fifth, Stanford has now
outscored its opponents 91-43 in the fifth and
has scored almost 25 percent of all its runs in
that frame. All seven runs were charged to
Rivers, who only recorded one out.
Stanford rode singles from August. Castro,
Milleville, Molina and Jones to five more in
the seventh, and the bullpen kept the Broncos
quiet the rest of the way. Stringer went 2.2
shutout innings to get the win while freshman
Danny Sandbrink also tossed 3.1 scoreless in
nings. Senior Rex Pet rill got the final two outs.
"1 got a little emotional during batting
practice today when I realized this could be
my last game at Sunken." said Petrill. "It was
great to get the win because it is all about win
ning."

Jake Schlander and an improved Cardinal defense have been key to Stanford's turnaround this season after a disappointing .500 finish in 2007. Stanford routed Santa Clara on Monday, 15-4.
