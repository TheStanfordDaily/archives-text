## Wrestling's Coach McCoy to leave Farm for Maryland job 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
Cardinal wrestling head coach
Kern McCoy announced yesterday
that he is leaving Stanford for a head
coaching position with the University
of Maryland. McCoy, who was hired in
2006, just completed his third full sea
son as Stanford's coach.
"The decision to leave Stanford was
very hard for me," McCoy said in a
statement to GoStanford.com. "I truly
love Stanford and everything assiviat
ed with the program and the Universi
ty, the team, the parents, the alums, the
administration, everything. The last
three years of my life have been incred
ible. The decision to head back east was
ultimately made because it's going to
be a better situation for my family."
McCoy w ill be leaving behind a pro
gram that is clearly in transition, as top
performers Tanner Gardner at 125
pounds and Josh Zupancic at 156
pounds just closed out their collegiate
careers this winter. As the pair of multi
ple Ail-American award winners and
team captains graduate, the Cardinal
will need to look to a new core group of
athletes, possibly including junior Luke
Feist, sophomores Zack Giesen and
Jake Johnson, redshirt freshman Lucas
Espericucta and true freshman Kyle
Barrett, who came on strong late in the
2(X)8 season, to lead Â»' e tean. forward.
Now. that change will have to come
under a new head coach, as ell.
As Stanford's head coach, McCoy
guided the Cardinal to a 19t i place fin
ish nationally last season, its second
highest ever. McCoy also coached five
wrestlers to the NCAA championships
in each of the past two years, i program

record.
Stanford's former head coach was
previously a lauded athlete on the in
ternational stage, representing the
United States in the 2(XX) Summer
Olympics in Sydney as well as in the
2(X)4 games in Athens, finishing fifth
and seventh, respectively. McCoy also
won five consecutive U.S. National
Freestyle Wrestling Championships
from 2000-04.
It was truly an interesting sequence
of events that sent McCoy to Man
land, as former Terrapins head coach
Pat Santoro accepted a head coaching
position at Lehigh, where both he and
McCoy served as assistant coaches
under longtime coach Greg Strobel.
When Strobel moved into his new role
as an athletic department official, San
toro got the call to replace him. and
McCoy replaced Santoro in turn at
Maryland.
McCoy's short tenure with the Car
dinal is not unusual for the program:
aside from one notable exception
(Chris Horpel from 1980-2001), Stan
ford wrestling coaches have never
stayed on for more than five seasons in
the over 90-year history of the sport on
the Farm.
At Maryland. McCoy will inherit a
program that tied for 21st place at the
NCAA Championships this season
and is headlined by Hudson Taylor at
197 pounds, who placed third national
ly as just sophomore.
A release on GoStanford.com
promised that a nationwide sc r ch for
the next Stanford coach woulu begin
immediately.
