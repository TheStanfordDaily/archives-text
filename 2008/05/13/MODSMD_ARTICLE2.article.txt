## Students haunted by bike tickets Unpaid citations lead to warrants, court dates 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
When Erin Waller '09 went to
pay an old bike ticket that had been
issued during fall quarter, the last
thing on her mind was that there
was a warrant out for her arrest.
"1 got a bike ticket last
November." Waller said. "I never
thought about it again until I went
to the police station this spring to
pay for the ticket. The officer there
told me to go to the courthouse
immediately because 1 had a war
rant out for my arrest."
After leaving the library around
10 p.m. one evening fall quarter.

police at the intersection of
Escondido and Campus Drive for
biking without a bike light.
When Waller looked at the tick
et closely later that night, she
noticed that the citation did not
state she was missing a bike light,
and instead said her bike was
unregistered.
"I had registered my bike since
freshman year," Waller said.
What she thought to be a minor
mistake made by the police officer
turned out to be a huge hurdle.
The California Vehicle Code
states that bicycle riders have the
same rights and responsibilities as
motor vehicle drivers do and are
therefore subject to the same cita
tions and fines — which are often
hundreds of dollars. Failing to
appear in court for this type of mis
demeanor violation is grounds for
an arrest warrant. Violators may
also be punished with six months
in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.
"I went to the court house in a
panic. The [clerk] said there was a
warrant out for my arrest and I had
to pay a fine of [approximately]
$150," Waller added. "Since I
refused to pay that amount, [the
clerk] set up a court date for me."
Waller did not receive a cour
tesy notice from the court remind
ing her to pay the inaccurate tick
et, and a "failure to appear" charge
had been filed against her. A judge
dismissed all violations after she
provided proof of her bike regis
tration.
According to Bill Larson, public
information officer at the
Department of Public Safety, if stu
dents do not receive a courtesy
notice, they still need to remember
to pay their bike tickets before the
deadline.
"A courtesy notice may be
mailed by the court to the address
shown on the citation, but if you do
not get the notice, you are still
required to pay the fine on time
and appear in court if necessary,"
Larson said.
Students should contact a Santa
Clara County Court clerk if they
do not receive a courtesy notice,
Larson added, and even write
down the officer's name and the
date when the ticket was issued for
future reference.
When a ticket has not been
processed by the court, students
should also contact the courthouse
directly. Preferably, students
should plan to pay on time and
should also have in mind that
delays in processing times at the
court may also occur, Larson said.
Alison Claire Murphy '09 was
willing but unable to comply with
the law when trying to pay her
ticket fine before the deadline.
"I got one [ticket] for running a
stop sign in early March. As of
today, the ticket has not been
processed by the county court, and
I have not been able to pay it.
Stanford's Police Office has been
very helpful," she said. "But since I
heard it would go on my perma
nent record if 1 did not pay [the
ticket] on time, I am really wor
ried."
According to Larson. Stanford's
Department of Public Safety can
not go into the county's system and
check the status of a ticket.
"If you have a problem with
your bike ticket, you should work
with the court who takes over pro
cessing of that violation," Larson
added. "The [police] station will
not have record of it."
