## Students haunted by bike tickets Unpaid citations lead to warrants, court dates 
### SUSANA MONTES STAFF WRITER 
When Erin Waller '09 went to
pay an old bike ticket that had been
issued during fall quarter, the last
thing on her mind was that there
was a warrant out for her arrest.
"1 got a bike ticket last
November." Waller said. "I never
thought about it again until I went
to the police station this spring to
pay for the ticket. The officer there
told me to go to the courthouse
immediately because 1 had a war
rant out for my arrest."
After leaving the library around
10 p.m. one evening fall quarter.
Waller was stopped by campus
