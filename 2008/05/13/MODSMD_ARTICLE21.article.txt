# Card leaps to head of Pac

### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford multi-event athletes
definitely made their mark this week
end in Tempe, Ariz., as the Pac-10
Multi-Event Championship conclud
ed with the Cardinal women in a tie
for second place and the men in third.
Indeed, the small contingent of six
Stanford athletes put forth several
strong performances and personal
bests this past weekend, which should
only help the team moving forward
into this weekend's Pac-10 Champi
onships.
Not surprisingly, the men were led
once again by the remarkable talent
of senior Josh Hustedt. Hustedt ran a
season best time of 50.64 in the 400
meters and followed that up with
some spectacular finishes in other
events. The Stanford senior also
notched a second place finish in the
long jump, first place in the high
jump, second place in the pole vault
and third place in the 1,500-meter run
— leading to an overall third place
finish in the men's decathlon with
7,181 points.
Competing also for the men was
freshman Corey Dysick, who, though
he finished in 11th place, had colle
giate bests in the 110 hurdles (15.21
seconds), the discus (115-10) and the

1,500 meters (4:50.45).The reason for
Dysick's poor finish despite his top
marks was due to a "no height" mark
in the pole vault.
"[TTie] 'no height' in the pole vault
... killed my chances to score in the
meet," Dysick said. "While the meet
did not go as well as I would have
liked, I walked away with a few event
[personal records] and great compe
tition experience."
Dysick's experience gained in
events like these could prove crucial
down the line, as the freshman's bur
geoning talent should be formidable
in the years to come. For now, though,
Hustedt remains the top contributor
of the Cardinal multi-event squad on
the men's side.
"Josh, of course, did extremely
well," Dysick said."He is a senior, [so]
this was his last Pac-10 Champi
onships." Dysick went on to laud his
teammate for his achievements off
the track, which included his plans to
attend medical school at Yale next
year.
The Stanford women were led by
junior Lauren Stewart, who recorded
a season best in the 100-meter hur
dles with a time of 14.24 seconds.
Stewart also had a season best of 19-
3.25 in the long jump and a career
best in the javelin with a throw of 120-
4. Her impressive results propelled

her from sixth place on day one to a
fourth place finish with a personal
best score of 5,440 points.
Also faring incredibly well for
Stanford was freshman Whitney
Liehr, who finished directly behind
teammate Stewart in fifth place, with
a personal best score of 5.186 points.
Liehr had a career best throw in the

javelin with a toss of 118-8. The other
Cardinal women in the competition
— sophomore Kara Bennett and
freshman Lexie Spiranac — finished
in 11th and 16th with collegiate best
scores of 4,799 points and 4,468
points, respectively. Spiranac, a fresh
man, spoke of Pac-10 Championships
as an "amazing experience" and was

happy to "have completed the gruel
ing two-day event."
With these successful finishes, the
Cardinal is well prepared to return to
Arizona next weekend for the final
round of Pac-10 Championships.
