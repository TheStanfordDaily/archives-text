## Winners and losers of the 2008 Draw 
### MARISSA MILLER EMMA TROTTER FEATURES EDITORS 
The law of large numbers
said it had to happen once.
This year — rather than
going to a gaggle of bright
eyed freshmen girls — the
Draw's lowest number belongs to a
more eccentric pair: rising seniors Red
Daly and Sean Follmer.
If you can't quite place the names,
Daly and Follmer were the master
minds behind Rumsfest, a mock cele
bration of Donald Rumsfeld's
appointment as a Hoover Fellow.
Earlier this spring, Daly gained quasi
celebrity status on campus through his
run for ASSU president. His slate,
REVOLUTION!, is known by its
palm and sickle emblem — which, in
the week before the election, was pro
jected in red lights onto the side of
Hoover Tower — as well as its spec
tacular failure in the election itself,
where it garnered fewer than 200
votes.
Daly sees his draw number as
political vindication.
"I think it's kind of a wink and a
nod from somebody," Daly said. "I
think this clearly indicates our tri-
umph over our political toes. 1 mean, 1
did get a better number than every
other candidate — put that on your
five-point platform "
Last week, five sophomores and
one freshman received a different
kind of sign from the heavens — this
unlucky Draw group received the
number 3,000.
"We're just extremely unlucky,"
said Abe Cabangbang 10. He and his
drawmates do not believe that they
did anything to jinx themselves.
"If 1 start thinking about that. I'll
get really paranoid." he said.
However, more superstitious stu
dents might blame the circumstances
under which the boys found out their
number.
"My roommate made a joke like
five seconds before we checked about
being 3.000," recalled Dan Matte '10,
who currently lives in Twain with four
other members of the group. 1 lis fifth
drawmate lives in Mars.
The other four students are Matt
Hartz TO, Sevastian Tchernov Ml.
Greg Enenstein TO and Reid
Chandler TO.
The drawmates get a strange satis
faction out of telling friends about
their number.
"At first they don't believe it. or
they just laugh at us." Matte said.
"People will come up to us and say.
You won't believe how bad our num
ber is.' but then it's actually a 2500 or
something. They think they're the
most screwed until they find out what
our number is."
Daly and Follmer don't have to
worry about that kind of reaction.
When asked about how it feels to
draw a number one. Daly responded:
"I actually got a half. Sean got the
other half."
"Sean is in Spain." he continued.
"He called asking what our Draw
number was, and I told him — before
I'd seen it — that it was one. He said.
'Bullshit.' and hung up. Then I got an
email from him the next day.and he
told me we got a one. so I emailed
back, 'Bullshit.' And then 1 looked
online — and. sure enough — we got
number one."
"1 was looking on Axess." recalled
Follmer. "and 1 was like. well, that's
where the number's supposed to go.

but there's only one number
there...that's strange."
In fact, Daly and Follmer have
been drawing number one since they
were freshmen. Or at least, that's what
they've been telling people.
"Freshmen year, my four draw
mates and I threw a party celebrating
getting number one...before we actu
ally got our number," said Daly.
"One of our friends. Lisa Ruskin
['09], told us we were going to get a
1999," Follmer said.
"We ended up drawing a 1983,"
Daly said. "Horrible year — horrible
year for the country, horrible year for
Red."
"Lisa's in Madrid with me right
now. so, this year. I asked her to bless
my draw group, and then we got a
number one," said Follmer. "We're
pretty sure she's a witch."
Rather than draw into Bob — the
traditional residence for Draw victors
the two are opting for Chi Theta
Chi. But then. Daly and Follmer are
anything but traditional.
"Bob has rats," said Daly."And I've
found that people who live outside
Chi ITieta Chi are degenerates.
Freaks. I just want to live with some
normal people — good, wholesome
American living. That's what they do
so well at Chi Hieta Chi."
One of the most popular co-ops on
campus. Chi Theta Chi rarely accepts
residents who do not apply lor priori
ty beforehand.
"I got priority there after a hard
day of labor. It was grueling. It was
very intense," said Daly. "Well, actual
ly I couldn't say. 1 had one of my assis
tants do it for me — my time is worth
more than that."
"It's where we've wanted to live
every year." Follmer added.
As for Matte, Cabangbang and fel
lows, they might be living in Murray
next year.
"Four of us got priority, but the
other two didn't, so I don't know what
we're going to do about that," Matte
said. "At this point, though. 1 think we
all might be equally screwed."
Cabangbang regrets not applying
to be on staff next year instead.
"In retrospect, it'd be nice," he said.
One thing the group does not want
to do is live off campus.
"I'd rather camp on Escondido."

said Cabangbang. "I definitely want to
stay on campus, even if it means living
in graduate housing."
What Cabangbang finds so unap
pealing about living off campus is "the
idea of being so isolated from every
one on campus."
"I'd just feel so disconnected from
everyone," he said. "On campus, the
people you want to see are right next
door."
Both groups have strong opinions
about reforming the Draw.
"A lot of people have been talking
about reforming the Draw," Daly said.
"It's pernicious, and it goes against my
personal American values of free
enterprise."
"I never would have been able to
achieve what I've achieved were it not
for the great free market system at
Stanford and beyond," he added.
Matte and Cabangbang, though
both were unlucky this year, have dif
ferent ideas about the draw.
"Maybe people who want a better
room could pay more, and people
who don't could pay less." Matte said.
"It's just more efficient."
■ Ihey'd get shitty housing!" coun
tered Cabangbang.
"Yeah, but they can at least stay
here for cheaper," Matte rejoined.
"I think it'd be nice if the Draw
were more specific," Cabangbang
said, suggesting breaking the three
years up by the thousands. "Make it
less likely that people get screwed all
three years, and more likely that peo
ple can join the 90 club."
That would certainly include Daly
and Follmer. Although there are cur
rently no plans to celebrate the num
ber. Daly encourages everyone to
attend Floatopia — what he calls the
"main feature" of the quarter.
Floatopia, scheduled for May 25th,

will he "a floating party on Lake Lag
— everyone is building boats, weird
watercrafts," said Daly.
"There w ill be absolutely no alco
hol," he added. "So don't bring a float
ing keg."
"Everyone should come to
Floatopia," Follmer said.
Cabangbang may have to wait a lit
tle longer to celebrate, but he believes
that the just universe will eventually
repay him for the 3.000.
"How? I have no idea," he said.
"That's the beauty of it."
Matte disagrees.
"1 believe in justice and stuff, but 1
don't think anyone cares about my
high Draw number," he said. "I'm not
really that superstitious. Whatever, it's
a number. It's luck of the draw, it real
ly is. At the end of the day it is what it
is — completely out of our control."
"There's so many things that are
worse in life that could happen to
you." he added. "Just the opportunity
for good housing is good enough for
me."
