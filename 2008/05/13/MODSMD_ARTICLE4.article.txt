# Family mistakenly detained
## Graduate student claims police held him, wife at gunpoint while looking for burglar 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An Escondido Village couple out for a late
afternoon stroll found themselves staring down
the barrel of a gun in what proved to be a case
of false suspicion of vandalism by campus
police.
Around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 24. a
first-year Stanford graduate student, his three
month pregnant wife and their two-and-a-half
year-old son were finishing a walk around the
Dish, accompanied by a friend visiting from out
of town.

The Daily agreed to withhold the individu
als' names since they were accused of no crime
and wished to retain their privacy as a condition
of being interviewed.
The couple said that their son wanted to
walk down the last hill of the trail, so the student
and his friend placed their bags in the child's
stroller. As the four crossed Junipero Serra onto
Stanford Ave., where their car was parked, the
men walked ahead while the mother lagged
behind with her child.
The adults walking a stroller loaded down
with bags along a busy road during rush hour
aroused the suspicion of police. Stanford

University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) Public Information Officer Bill
Larson said in a written statement that deputies
responded to "a report of three individuals who
appeared to be looking into parked vehicles."
The Department of Public Safety is other
wise staying relatively mum about the incident,
declining repeated requests for them to con
firm, deny or comment on any of a series of
claims made by the family. Police instead pro
vided a statement with general Department
policies on detaining suspected criminals.
Larson noted that vehicle burglaries have
been on the rise.

"Before and after this incident occurred, we
have continued to focus our efforts on those
areas of the campus that have experienced a
recent rash of vehicle burglaries and van
dalisms, including that portion of Stanford Ave.
where this incident originated." Larson said.
"These efforts include canvassing the area with
alert fliers, increased patrols and responding to
reports of suspicious persons and circum
stances."
Shortly after the family and friend began to
drive down Stanford Avenue, they were sig-
naled by a policeman to pull over. As
they did so, more police cars came
from the opposite direction and
blockaded the party on Stanford
Avenue, according to the parents.
"When 1 stepped out of the pas
senger door, I came face to face with a
pistol," the friend said in a police
report, which he submitted to the
Santa Clara County Internal Affairs
Unit and was obtained by The Daily.
"The man holding the gun ... looked
nervous. When 1 saw he had the gun
pointed at me with both hands, 1 said
to him, 'What's going on?' We really
had no idea whether we were in dan
ger or were being accused of being
dangerous. He screamed, 'Shut up'
[and] 'Get over there.' Other officers
were ordering us with totally unneces
sary profanities even though we total
ly complied with their demands."
Larson would not comment on the
status of any internal investigation

and did not respond to questions
about the use of guns or profanity, say
ing only that detention of suspects
may require a variety of procedures in
order to protect police officers.
"Detentions may include the use
of verbal commands, drawn weapons,
handcuffing and restriction of move
ment in order to control individuals
who are being detained and assure the
safety of the sworn officers," Larson
said. "According to the Uniform
Crime Reports, which [are] compiled
each year by the FBI, law enforce
ment officers are injured or killed dur
ing routine traffic stops more often
than virtually any other type of call."
Once the adults were out of the
car, they said, the officers instructed
them to lie face down on the road with
their hands behind their backs, still at
gunpoint. The three adults were then
handcuffed, according to the adults'
police reports.

"Deputies arrived within moments
and detained the individuals until it
could be determined if a burglary or
vandalism had been committed, or
was in the process of being commit
ted," Larson said.
"The manner in which deputies
stop and detain individuals is based on
training, past experiences.
Department policies and procedures,
the type of crime and other informa
tion that may have been relayed to
them." Larson continued. "Given the
information that a felony burglary
may have been committed, deputies
would have had a heightened concern
about the possibility of people fleeing
from the scene either on foot or in a
vehicle, as well as the potential for vio
lence."
The officer-in-charge soon arrived
at the scene, the mother said, and he
released her so she could comfort her
child. Her husband and the friend

were released from handcuffs and
asked if they would allow their car to
be searched.
Larson said those detained had not
been involved with thefts or any other
criminal activity.
Still, the family remains shaken up.
"The offensive language and
threats with deadly force were exces
sive," the mother said. "These officers
thought they were arresting thieves.
Theft is not a violent crime and 1 do
not understand why so much force
was used. It would have been a far
lesser offense to our family to have
returned from our hike to find that
the car had been broken into and the
radio stolen."
Regardless of the shock, the family
is not taking legal action, though all
three adults submitted reports to the
county for investigation.
"We're not pressing charges
against them," the wife said. "We're

just saying this isn't OK, and we want
it to be acknowledged. There are peo
ple that, when things like this happen
to them, just feel totally disempow
ered and don't do anything because
they're afraid. I think it's important
for people to acknowledge what goes
on with the police."
Larson said that SUDPS has a for
mal complaint process to deal with
such concerns.
"If a member of the community
would like to complain about a nega
tive experience that resulted from a
contact with any member of the
Department of Public Safety," he said,
"or a service that was provided or not,
he/she is welcome to file a formal
complaint by completing the proper
form in person at the Department of
Public Safety."
