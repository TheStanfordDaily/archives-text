## Graduate student claims police held him, wife at gunpoint while looking for burglar

An Escondido Village couple out for a late
afternoon stroll found themselves staring down
the barrel of a gun in what proved to be a case
of false suspicion of vandalism by campus
police.
Around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 24. a
first-year Stanford graduate student, his three
month pregnant wife and their two-and-a-half

policies on detaining suspected criminals.
Larson noted that vehicle burglaries have
been on the rise.

"Before and after this incident occurred, we
have continued to focus our efforts on those
areas of the campus that have experienced a
recent rash of vehicle burglaries and van
dalisms, including that portion of Stanford Ave.
where this incident originated." Larson said.
"These efforts include canvassing the area with
alert fliers, increased patrols and responding to
reports of suspicious persons and circum

Shortly after the family and friend began to
drive down Stanford Avenue, they were sig-
