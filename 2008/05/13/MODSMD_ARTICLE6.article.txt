# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Greeks lose draw privilege 
### 
Going Greek will always have its
benefits, but those who rush will
have one fewer advantage in the
Draw come next spring.
Students in this year's pledge
classes who enter into the Greek sys
tem with a housed fraternity or
sorority will no longer have the
option of later using a preferred year
for on-campus housing if they are
unable to live in the house or choose
not to do so.
"Starting with those students who
pledged Greek houses this spring, all
preferred years will be removed
from the student's record when we
receive the pledge list from the hous
es." Director of Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan wrote in a
statement to explain the change in
policy "If these students or any
future Greek students apply for
campus housing, they will need to
apply unpreferred. ITiey can file a
petition to request these preferred
years returned if they have to live
out of the house for two years or if
they de-pledge the fraternity or
sorority."
This change marks a departure
from existing policy, according to
Executive Housing Director Rodger
Whitney. With the old policy, a stu
dent living in non-Greek housing for
junior year could use their single
remaining preferred year and return
to their house senior year, despite
the fact that the student would tech
nically have no preferred years
remaining. But with the new policy.

Greek students will forfeit both of
their preferred years when they join
a fraternity or sorority.
Whitney emphasized that the
change fit with the University's per
spective on housing for students in
the Greek system.
"The basis of the [new] policy
regarding housing for Greek stu
dents is that once a student pledges a
fraternity or sorority, the responsi
bility of providing housing to the
member falls to the house," Whitney
wrote in a statement.
Both Whitney and Interfraternity
Council Vice President Brian Inouye
agreed that, ideally, members of a
Greek house wouid live there for
three years.
"We will begin to work with fra
ternities and sororities to ensure that
their members are provided at least
two years of housing in their Greek
house," Whitney said, "although ide
ally it would be three years living in
the house."
"Each fraternity member is inte
gral in the composition of each
house," Inouye added. "There are
many community service and social
events that each member takes part
in, and, if they want to participate, it
is easier if they are living in the
house."

lnouye expressed disagreement
with the change in policy.
"1 think that there are new prob
lems with the new system," lnouye
said. "Specifically, what happens if
someone joins a fraternity and
decides to live out of the house with
"lt closes a loop
hole, in a way,
because frat
houses are a
pretty good deal."

out de-pledging because he would
like to continue participating in the
structured community service and
social events? If he moves out of the
house sophomore year, he doesn't
have any preferred years for junior
or senior year. I find this to be
incredibly unfair."
lnouye added that he understood
the reasons behind a change.
"As a fraternity member, I don't
want the system touched," lnouye
said. "But as a Stanford student, I
would understand why they would

do so."
Whitney Martin '09, a member of
the Intersorority Council's
Executive Board, also expressed
reservations about the policy.
"I think it's geared towards trying
to equalize in terms of those not in a
frat or sorority," Martin said. "But
because the Greek system is getting
bigger, the houses can't always
house everyone."
"Ideally, there would be at least
two years in the house, and one year
un-preferred" outside of the house,
she added. "But there could be a sit
uation in which a person is unable to
fit and then has two years unpre
ferred."
Other students weighed in on the
change.
"I think that it's just one of the
advantages of being in a frat," said
Stephen Burhenn '10, a pledge of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity. "It's just
like if you live off campus for a year,
and come back and still have a pre
ferred year. I don't think it's neces
sarily fair."
Others disagreed.
"The change seems fair," said
Alex Krimkevich '10. "It closes a
loophole, in a way, because frat
houses are a pretty good deal. You
really do get three years of preferred
housing living in them, and, granted,
it was a benefit of joining a frat, but
I don't think it was fair."
