# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Greeks lose draw privilege 
### 
Going Greek will always have its
benefits, but those who rush will
have one fewer advantage in the
Draw come next spring.
Students in this year's pledge
classes who enter into the Greek sys
tem with a housed fraternity or
sorority will no longer have the
option of later using a preferred year
for on-campus housing if they are
unable to live in the house or choose
not to do so.
"Starting with those students who
pledged Greek houses this spring, all
preferred years will be removed
from the student's record when we
receive the pledge list from the hous
es." Director of Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan wrote in a
statement to explain the change in
policy "If these students or any
future Greek students apply for
campus housing, they will need to
apply unpreferred. ITiey can file a
petition to request these preferred
years returned if they have to live
out of the house for two years or if
they de-pledge the fraternity or
sorority."
This change marks a departure
from existing policy, according to
Executive Housing Director Rodger
Whitney. With the old policy, a stu
dent living in non-Greek housing for
junior year could use their single
remaining preferred year and return
to their house senior year, despite
the fact that the student would tech
nically have no preferred years
remaining. But with the new policy.
