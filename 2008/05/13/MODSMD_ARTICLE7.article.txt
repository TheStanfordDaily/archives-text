## Alumni start-up to enrich online news experience 
### KELSEY MESHER DESK EDITOR 
For one Stanford grad, an undergraduate
dream has materialized into reality — cyber
reality, at least. 'IYistan Harris '06 watched
over three years of hard work pay off last
month when he and a team of fellow alumni
launched the online media enhancement
company Apture.
The company, which began initially as a

brainstorming project between Harris, a
friend and a few Knight fellows, aims to pro
vide publishers with a user-friendly program
to integrate diverse media. Apture links run
of-the-mill news stories to video clips, pic
tures, articles or even PowerPoint and PDF
documents.
"The goal of Apture," Harris said, "is to try
and turn flat Web pages into rich multimedia
experiences."
Harris emphasized the originality of the

program's accessibility.
"Up until now if you wanted to add a
video or image to your page, you had to have
some knowledge of how the Web works," he
said. "It's never been possible for lay people
who are not technically savvy to link PDF
documents together with an image, with a
PowerPoint, with an MP3, together with a
video and have all that information presented
in context."
"We really wanted to make it dead simple

for anybody to take multimedia from around
the Web and link it into their page ," Harris
added.
The company, which launched in April
2008. has already contracted with big name
publisher The Washington Post. According to
Harris, several others, including The Daily,
have agreed to move forward. The Daily
implemented Apture on its Web site this
week. The program is also available
to individuals — including bloggers
and those with personal Web sites
— free of charge.
"Apture adds a new dimension
— a web of information — inside
washingtonpost.com stories and
continues our mission of bringing
readers the most comprehensive
and in-depth news coverage," said
Washington Post Executive Editor
Jim Brady in a press release.
Beyond helping publishers diver
sify their media, Harris mentioned
the philosophical motivation behind
Apture.
"We're trying to generate empa
thy and interest in things that peo
ple wouldn't be expected to be
engaged in," he said.
Harris noted that readers are

often apathetic about issues if they
do not know the context or back
ground. He mentioned as an exam
ple that readers may be more inter
ested in reading about Burma if
they knew where it was located on a
map.
"If they don't know that one
piece of information — it's up to
them to look it up," he said.
While researching something
new may be second nature to a
Stanford student, said Harris, it may
be cumbersome or even embarrass
ing for some to look up a fact they
feel they should already know.
"With Apture. someone can link
the name of that person to the
Wikipedia article to an interview on
BBC and have the video playing
alongside the background of who
that person is." he said. The idea is,
"Make this person real to me.
[Then] they can care about it."
