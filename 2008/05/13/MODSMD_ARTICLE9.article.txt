## POWWOW: ANCING THROUGH HISTORY 
### EMILY RIALS 
At first, all is relatively quiet.The
Friday sun is beginning to set;
the circular arena is enveloped
with the lulling buzz of conver
sation. Then the drums begin,
strong beats joined by strong
voices. You can feel the leading beats in your
chest. Conversation ceases. The procession be
gins. slow-stepping bearers bringing forward the
eagle staffs and the flags. The head dancers fol
low. flashy and energetic. Behind them,younger
girls dance, representatives of other gatherings.
In order, group by group, category by category,
the dancers enter the arena, moving to the
rhythm of the song,surrounded by the overpow
ering voices of the singers and the Master of Cer
emonies, who announces each group as it ap
pears.
The colors are what strike you first. Bright
yellow and crimson and pale pink, turquoise and
orange and black,gold and ivory and deep green.
No two outfits are alike. Some sparkle with
beads, others clink with bells. Some ripple with
fringes and ribbons, others shuffle with feathers.
Some wear their hair bound, some braided, some
loose;some carry feathered fans,some brilliantly
patterned shawls. Toddlers trot alongside their
parents and grandparents; no age group is unrep
resented. A little girl in a long purple dress bites
her lip as she steps, the metal cones sewn to her
skirt jingling. As the dancers move in a broad
clockwise circle around the ring, stamping down
the grass, the songs change but the sentiment
stays the same: these people have come from all
over the country to be here, at Stanford, for the
first Grand Entry of the 2(X)<S Stanford Powwow.
*
This year's Powwow was Stanford's 37th.
Founded in 1971 by the "newly formed Stanford
American Indian Organization," explains Katie
Jones '08. this year's Powwow publicity coordina
tor, the Powwow was organized for the purpose
of "offsetting the negative image of the [Stan
ford] Indian mascot and bringing a diverse Na
tive American presence to the campus."
Since its inception, the Powwow has grown to
become both the largest student-run powwow in
the country and the largest student-run event on
Stanford's campus. Seventeen subcommittees,
headed by thirty-five Powwow Committee
members, are involved in organizing the event,
aided by around 2(K) volunteers during the Pow
wow itself.
"Almost every [Stanford] student attends
Powwow at least once," writes Joseph
Cartwright'o9 in an email, but "we do in fact draw
crowds from around the Bay Area and across the
country." Cartwright is one of this year's Powwow
Committee co-chairs. Ihe Powwow Committee
expected 30.000 people to attend over the course
of the weekend.

Saturday morning, the grove is again alive
with activity. People are everywhere; the few
bleachers and hay bales available for seating are
already overcrowded. Dancers and drum groups
and other attendees have set up their own tents
around the circle and sit in the shade, waiting for
the arena activities to begin.
Toward the far boundary of the clearing, vans
and trucks and bikes have been parked. One
van's trunk is open. A young woman, already
dressed for the afternoon's Grand Entry, sits and
smiles as another separates and braids her hair.
An older woman steps forward to correct a
young girl's fancy shawl technique: Keep your
shoulders back.The little girl grins and twirls, the
bright cloth clutched in her hands a blur of color.
"My one complaint is that it's too dusty,"Earl
Sherman comments. "Not enough grass." Sher
man.a Navajo-Ute, works as a Special Education
teacher most of the year, but he travels north in
the summer to attend powwows. "It's my vaca
tion," he says. Sherman ventures to other pow
wows to compete as a traditional dancer with
other members of his family, but this weekend,
he has been helping his niece sell jewelry.This is
Sherman's first visit to the Stanford Powwow.
He stands beside his niece's corner booth,
wiping dust off the sets of earrings. "I'm planning
to come back next year." he adds, gazing toward
the arena, "and dance."
*
At the center of the Powwow festivities is, of
course, the dancing. Both men and women can
compete in a variety of dance styles, each corre
sponding to particular outfits and sets of foot
work. At this weekend's Powwow, women could
compete in Women's Traditional Dancing, which
the powwow program explains "involves a slow
or non-moving bouncing step" and intricately
decorated dresses; Fancy Shawl Dancing, which
features complicated footwork and whirling of i
the eponymous fancy shawls; or Jingle Dancing,
an adaptation of a healing dance in which com
petitors wear dresses adorned with up to seven ;
"tiers" of metal cones that shake and jingle as i
they move. t
The men's divisions included Grass Dancing. I
described in the program as "the most highly- I
competitive form of Northern dancing to be i
found today"; Men's Fancy Dancing, in which i
competitors wear huge feather bustles and jump i
and spin about to the beat of the drum; and Tra- (
ditional Dancing from both the Northern and
the Southern tribal traditions.
The prizes in these competitions ranged from
$800. given for first place in a division of men and <
women aged fifty and above, to one dollar and a
handful of Jolly Ranchers, given for participation <
in the "Tiny Tots" special dance, open to "future
champions" aged six and below.
Additional special dances were announced
during the weekend, as well. Both the I lead Man
Dancer, Adam Tsosie Nordwall. and the Head
Woman Dancer, Jennifer Young Bear,

sponsored dance spe

cials.The family of Desi Small-Roderiguez, who
will receive her Master's degree in Sociology
from Stanford later this year, sponsored a dance
special in which teams of three to five women
performed synchronized dances. And in the
LGBT Community Resources Center's Switch
Dance, the men dressed and danced as women,
and vice versa.
Around 200 dancers registered to compete in
this year's Powwow, though many entered the
arena to celebrate their culture without officially
registering to compete. During the weekend's in
tertribal social dances, when dancers in the audi
ence were invited to join the registered dancers,
it was not uncommon to see individuals in jeans
and tank tops stepping alongside individuals in
full traditional regalia.
"The Stanford Powwow truly showcases the
richness and diversity of Native American cul
tures." Jones asserts. "It demonstrates that our
cultures are not relics of the past, but are instead
alive and thriving."

Before Grand Entry on Sunday morning, as
the sun is making its way to its apex and many
Powwow-goers are still making their way for
ward from parking lots and campsites, a group of
eight young adults. Stanford students, takes to
the hay-strewn floor of the arena. Jones is among
them.To the side, a man with a shovel attempts to
even out the ground for the dancers, reorganiz
ing hay. tossing sticks and rocks into a bucket.
The young adults are the Cherokee Student
Ciroup. which. Jones explains to the audience,
"focuses on Cherokee culture, food, and lan
guage." Wearing bright red t-shirts and holding
sets of lyrics before them, they sing four songs in
theTsalagi language, from a children's lullaby to
a piece sung during the tribe's removal Jong the
Trail of Tears. The group's presentation is one of i
the onlv student performances of the weekend. i
I
The scents of burning sage, fresh fry bread, I
and stamped-down hay mingle around the ven- ;
dors' area Sunday afternoon, drums beating in
the background. Vendors like Earl Sherman and i
his niece have set up their booths in long lines ;
flanking the circular dance arena. Signs advertise 1
everything from hanks of colored beads to print
ed t-shirts. handmade jewelry to pottery and ce- j
ramie instruments, herbal remedies to dream- I
catchers.
On the far side of the arena, promises of i
lemonade, Indian tacos, fry bread with strawber
ries and whipped cream, or massive cobs of corn ]
draw great crowds to the food vendors' stands. I
The breeze picks up and covers everything,
everyone in a thin film of dust. Eucalyptus leaves
shower down like feathers on Powwow atten
dees.
George is a middle-aged Sioux man who has i
been dancing since he was four. "My parents i
taught me," he says, drinking an iced beverage <
while wandering around the powwow grove. «
Originally from Montana, George now travels i
to various California pow- i
wows to compete

in grass dancing. He has danced in five or six
Stanford Powwows before now.
Today, his regalia is black, decorated with
small mirrors and beaded flowers in white, yel
low, red, and blue.The powwow experience is re
ally "about the people — the extended family,"
he explains, "the Powwow family. Part of it's the
dancing, too — you dance for your family."
*
Aside from the Fun Run/Walk, which took
place with ninety registered participants, this
year there was a new addition to the collection of
Powwow activities: Sunday morning, sixteen
teams took part in the First Annual Maurice
Morsette Memorial Basketball Tournament.
Morsette, Jones explains, was "a dear communi
ty member who passed away last year. Mo was a
fervent basketball player, and we thought that
this tournament was the best way to honor and
remember his life."
All the proceeds from the tournament will be
donated to the scholarship Morsette's family has
organized to allow a high school student from
New Town. North Dakota, Morsette's home
town, to go to college.
*
It is the last competition of the Powwow:
hand-drumming. Six teams of drummers walk up
to the microphone at the head of the arena, one
by one, to sing their songs.The arena is cleared of
people, at first. As the music builds, a few young
girls, still in traditional dress, run out to the floor
and begin to dance, in groups of three or four,
around the perimeter of the circle.
What begins as a group of maybe a dozen
young women grows quickly to a throng of
dancers over 100 strong as the Master of Cere
monies announces that these Round Dances will
be the last chance for dancers to step together in
this year's Stanford Powwow. ITie circle grows
and grows. They hold hands.
"Come on out here!" exhorts a middle-aged
man with white stripes painted across his face
and arms, feathers fanning out at the back of his
head, as he passes the bleachers.
"I'm eating," replies the man he's addressed,
gripping his plate of strawberry-adorned fry
bread.
"It'll still be there," the first man says,beckon
ing again.
The second man, wearing jeans and a green
polar fleece, hands his plate to the woman beside
him and steps forward to join the circle.
*
"For me," Jones says,"it's incredible to be part
of an event that... brings the community together
in such a powerful way." Watching the final
dances, t he laughter and the affirmation, so many
disparate groups of people joined together on a
common ground to dance common steps, it seems
this year's Powwow has accomplished just that.
