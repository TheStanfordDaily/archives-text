Eight US soldiers face the most difficult decision of their lives: to kill or not to kill. Made with official
permission from the US Army, this film transcends the usual rhetoric of politics to reveal the human truth
that all of our soldiers are soldiers of conscience, wrestling with the demands of duty and the call of
conscience. (USA, 86 minutes, PG-13) National PBS Broadcast - October 2008
Directors Catherine Ryan and Cary Weimberg have been making award-winning documentaries for over 20
years. Their films, and films they have worked on, have won national Emmy Awards, were nominated for
Academy Awards; and have been seen and won "best of" awards in festivals around the world.
