## THE 						ONE, THE ONLY... PETER "B'JÜRK" BERG '10 
### AISHA WELLS 
No matter how many home football games you refuse to attend, it is
hard to be a Stanford student and escape the grandiose presence of
the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band — affec
tionately known as LSJUMB or simply the Band.

As one of the oldest and largest student-run organizations on campus, the
Band has made a name for itself, both through impressive musical talent and wild
and crazy attitude. Peter "B'jurk" Berg'lo, who holds the position of "drumz sex
ion leader." embodies these seemingly paradoxical qualities.
If you've ever been to a Band performance, you may have noticed the

guy enthusiastically pounding an enormous bass drum, all the while running
across the field like an Olympic athlete.That's Berg, leader and handler of
his drum, the Axis O' Rhythm. Just nearing the end of his sophomore

year, Peter was named section leader, a position he will continue to hold
until the end of the 2008 calendar year.
Though playing with the Band is an enjoyable experience, the
job of section leader is more time-consuming than many people may
believe.

"Band takes up a lot of time," Berg said. "[Most people at Stan
ford] only see some performances, but they don't see all the prac
tice time and other performances."
According to Berg, if one compared his weekly practice sched
ule to that of a varsity athlete, they would be roughly identical.
And while athletes are often told in advance when meets or
games will take place — giving them time to talk to professors or

make up exams — the Band and its members are often called
without preamble to perform or prepare for an upcoming show.
Despite long hours in the Shak and a mixed campus reputation,
the Band manages to remain true to its undeniably chill atmos
phere. Berg maintains. He calls that atmosphere the best part of
being in Band.
While they work hard. Band members surely know how to liven

up. Other bands, like Berkeley's or USC's, are entirely different —
complete with full uniforms and strict practice schedules.They are proto-

typical college marching bands. Stanford's, by contrast, is loved not only for
its energetic presence but also its inclusive attitude.
"Band is so welcoming," Berg said. "Anyone who wants to play can play."
New members are also given equal opportunity to perform at events across the
country. Whereas other schools require a certain level of training and talent, the
Band leaves the Shak doors open to all who share its love for fun.
When asked about students with unconventional musical talents. Berg, crack
ing a grin, is still inviting.
"We have an electric violin player," he said."How many schools have an electric vi-

olin player? We also have a keg player and a bicycle wheel player."

Earlier this year, students observed the shocking stunts appli
cants performed in the quest/to become the new Tree, the
Band's mascot. Though many expected the process to be

a little more than just crazy, they were still surprised to
learn that Jack Cackler *09 ate a snake and encour
aged others to smash fluorescent light bulbs

c c —
across his chest.
Events such as these are what led

Berg to think about how other students
perceive The Band.
"There needs to be a line you don't
cross. Eating animals and self-mutila
tion is probably crossing that line," he
i said.

But could it be precisely the
band's edgy aura that draws crowds
and makes for great entertain
ment?
"I would say that most of us
have two personalities: one
amongst ourselves and another
wackier, crazier side that we show
to everyone else," Berg claimed. "If
you only show one side, they're not
going to see the other side. But
we're not as eccentric or weird as
other people seem to think. It's kind
of fun to have a stage personality."

Though the Band's personality
may occasionally get it into trouble
with other universities, it still
remains an essential aspect of cam
pus life. From the Midnight Band
Run to performing amongst
smooching students during Full
Moon on the Quad to enjoying good
food and sun at a Band BBQ, it is
hard to imagine what Stanford
would be like without the beloved
LSJUMB.
"1 came here because 1 knew
about Stanford's band," Berg said.
"It's a great opportunity to be a part
of something so unique."
