# FOR LOVE OR FOR MONEY?
## Why next year's RAs signed on 
### STACIE CHAN 
Resident Assistant (RA) decisions
came out recently, introducing a
new group of freshman dorm RAs
for next year. The Facebook
groups were created. The dorm
. staff contacting began. And doors were deco
rated with congratulatory signs.
For the 2008-2009 year, these new RAs will
be functioning on little to no sleep. They will
; have to shuttle freshmen to the hospital after
. bouts of alcohol poisoning.They'll be awoken
| at all hours of the night after freshmen get

locked out for the umpteenth time. They will
he cleaning up vomit in places they didn't
even know existed in the dorm. They will be
leading the enthusiastic freshmen in those in
famous dorm cheer battles while unabashed
ly waving their dorm flags and leading a cho
rus of "Oh-T\velve!" All by choice.
Granted, the high salary is an appealing
bonus, but the inherent call to be an RA isn't
answered because of the salary.These students
genuinely wish to be the advisors, mentors,
role models and friends of the Class of 2012.
"RAs are beyond belief," said Cliff Nass,
Otero Resident Fellow (RF). "Their role is
beyond human conception."

We all remember the Scavenger Hunt. Ski
Trip. Screw Your Roommate, Secret
Snowflake, Assassins, Crossing the Line, study
breaks, hall dinners and countless other
events that permanently engraved freshman
year into our memories forever. And we have
our RAs to thank for the incredible times that
defined our first year at Stanford.
And not just anyone gets the opportunity
to play such a huge role in the lives of fresh
men. After rounds of applications, group and
individual interviews, the few, the proud, are
selected by RFs and current RAs. But what
exactly does it take to qualify for one of these
coveted positions? Those selected for next

year's positions spoke out.
"An R A has to be a jack of all trades," said
future Ujatnaa RA Mondaire Jones,'o9. "An
RA has to be the person who serves a bit of
the HPAC role in terms of providing academ
ic and intellectual guidance, someone who re
ally gives counseling in terms of people's per
sonal lives, the first person a resident goes to
when there is a problem and just a positive
role model."
"RAs are all different. There isn't just one
certain type," said future Burbank RA Katey
Mulfinger iO. "I, for example, am personally
really open to a lot of different things. I've ex
perienced many things on campus and tried
out lots of different groups, so I have knowl
edge about various opportunities on campus.
And I never judge people on their culture or
where they come from."
RFs revealed a few traits they seek in RAs.
"RAs can range from bubbly to more
reserved, from athletic to artistic, from quick
thinkers to more thoughtful types," said
Branner RFs Clyde Moneyhun and Nancy
Buffington in an email.
ITiough the personalities of RAs run the
spectrum, all share at least one quality.
" I"he common element of all RAs is their
dedication to helping the frosh have a great
first year at Stanford," Moneyhun said. "We
look for staff members who can be good men
tors to the frosh, who can share a variety of
Stanford experiences both academic and
beyond."
"I want to make sure the freshmen have
the same awesome experience that 1 had living
in Ujamaa." Jones said. "1 just have a personal
connection to the dorm since I stayed there
my freshman year."
Some RAs knew they wanted the job

since the moment they stepped
on the Stanford campus.
"It was something 1 knew 1

wanted to do freshman year.'
said ex-Branner RA Alana

Dong '08. "I love meeting
new people, listening to
them and being in a
position to help them
out."

And the year spent hein^

an RA doesn't just spai
nine months, it's an experi
ence that students take
with them even after

they leave The Farm.
"Once an RA
always an RA," Dong
said.
