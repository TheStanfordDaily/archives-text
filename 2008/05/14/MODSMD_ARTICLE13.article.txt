## Online bulletin to be revamped for 2008-2009 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The online Stanford Bulletin —
currently a series of difficult-to-nav
igate, downloadable PDF files —
will be accessible from the
University Web site in a fully
indexed and searchable HTML for
mat beginning fall 2008.
The 750-page Bulletin, which is
published every August, outlines the
courses and degree requirements for
all undergraduate programs, and
provides information on graduate
programs as well.
"We have long felt that the
Bulletin needed to be available in a
fully HTML, Web-based format,"
said Bulletin Editor and Assistant
University Registrar Stephen Arod
Shirreffs, who has worked on seven
Bulletins to date. "We definitely feel

that there is a demand for this, and it
is an improvement that the students
will appreciate."
Shirreffs said another major
improvement in the new online
Bulletin format will be the alphabet
ical listing of available courses by
department. In a separate section,
degree requirements will be listed
alphabetically by school and then
department as well.
"That's probably the biggest
change in the way the book will
look," Shirreffs said in an interview
with The Stanford Report.
"Chemistry majors, for instance, will
look in one section to see what they
have to do to get a degree in chem
istry. and look in another section for
course descriptions."
Degree requirements and avail
able courses are currently listed
together in the same section.

Stanford still plans to publish
hard copies of the University
Bulletin, but expects demand to fall
sharply.
"We expect students will want to
use the online product, as it will be
more convenient and accessible,"
Shirreffs told The Daily. "And in the
process we'll save a lot of trees."
The new online Bulletin will
offer all of the features available in a

Google Advanced Search, including
the option to search multiple terms
or to exclude terms, allowing users
to make more precise searches.
The new Bulletin will be avail
able online and in its finished format
late this summer before Axess opens
for the academic year.
