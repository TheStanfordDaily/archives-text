## Chemistry professor strives for HIV cure 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender,
senior author of a paper in the May
2 issue of Science Magazine, has
studied how a plant compound can
be synthesized to flush out HIV.
Wender and coworkers Jung-Min
Kee and Jeff Warrington discovered
in the lab a method of synthesizing
prostratin and DPP â€” two com
pounds that occur naturally in
plants. Together, the two compounds
can "flush HIV out into the open
where the immune system and anti
retroviral therapies can destroy it,"
according to a May 1 article in The
Stanford Report.
However, there are several
impediments to the scientists' further
research. Not only is the availability
of the plants limited, but heavy har
vesting of the wild plants, which
occurs largely in Samoa, could dis
rupt the ecology of the region.

Wender and his team developed
their synthesis method by using
renewable croton oil from Asia. He
also told Hie Stanford Report that
his team's work began with Samoan
healers who prescribed tea made
from local bark to tackle hepatitis
like symptoms. Samples of the bark
were sent to the National Institutes
of Health, where researchers ana
lyzed the bark and isolated pros
tratin.
The research conducted by
Wender and his team was funded by
the National Institutes of Health.
