# Research uses platypus genome to study testicular descent
## 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine recently used the
newly sequenced platypus genome
to trace the evolution of two genes
involved in the testicular descent

that occurs in most mammals.
Testicular descent is the moving
of the testicles away from the
warm core of the body during
development. According to a May
6 article published on Medical
News Today, understanding the
molecular mechanisms behind tes
ticular descent "may help physi
cians understand why the testes of
about 30 percent of premature
boys fail to descend to the scrotum
properly."
According to Sheau Yu Teddy
Hsu. assistant professor of obstet
rics and gynecology, the platypus is
a bridge between non-mammals
like birds and reptiles, which hold
their testicles in their body cavity,
and placental and marsupial mam
mals, which maintain their testicles
in an external scrotum.
Hsu published his research on
the platypus genome in the May 8
issue of the Genome Research jour
nal. alongside papers on findings
made possible by the newly
sequence platypus genome. The
report can be found by searching
