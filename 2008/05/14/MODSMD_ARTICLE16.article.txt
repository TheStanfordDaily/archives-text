## Editorial Board Biking tickets raise money, not awareness 
### 
As far as college campuses across the
country are concerned, we can com
fortably call Stanford very safe. One
side effect, however, of having a police force
that is not occupied with more serious crimes
is that they tend to find less significant things
to monitor, like bike traffic violations.
Those unfortunate souls who have been
victims of local police "ticket parties" know
how the Stanford police sometimes spends
its time. Every few weeks, one can find a pack
of police officers scattered somewhere
around campus sporadically enforcing cer
tain, obscure traffic laws and handing out ex
orbitant fines.
Expensive tickets for failing to stop at a stop
sign, not hand-signaling while turning or wear
ing iPod headphones while biking are handed
out at Stanford every year for violations that
some students do not even know exist.
The Editorial Board does not want to
come off as railing against some imagined ex
treme police oppression at Stanford. In fact,
some of the laws make perfect sense. It is a
bad idea to ignore a stop sign when rolling
down University Avenue. It is an equally bad
idea to be biking down the middle of El
Camino Real with headphones in and the
music blasting.The only problem is that these
tickets are handed out around quiet campus
roadways and not on traffic-heavy streets.
The problem with laws that apply to
something as broad and as general as "public
streets" is that there is no way to account for
exceptions to the rule. Legal paternalism,
while detestable in many aspects, can also be
arguably necessary in others — sometimes
\vi do need to be protected for ourselves, or

at the very least others need to be protected
from our voluntary risk-taking.
But taking the time to include every ex
ception to a potential law becomes an ab
solute bureaucratic nightmare and not feasi
bly possible. Hence, laws are passed with a
broader scope and the discretion is left to the
enforcing officer or magistrate.
What we have on campus is an ever-grow
ing failure to use that discretion.
Police officers have been known to give
the justification of "we're just trying to raise
awareness" when handing out tickets for
over a hundred dollars each. Well, if that's the
case, then there are more effective ways to
raise awareness.
Yes, punitive measures might help make
students aware of bike traffic laws. More
likely than not, however, this policy causes a
lot of ire and is less effective than other pos
sible options. Stopping a biker and informing
her of the law or having outreach events in
freshman dorms or in White Plaza will be
substantially more effective than erratically
writing citations to the few violators that the
police are able to catch.
This policy of spontaneously issuing bike
tickets causes students to have a negative at
titude toward police officers and severs the
link of trust and friendship that many stu
dents have with local law enforcement.
Throwing that trust away by issuing cita
tions in unnecessary situations is not the best
way to raise awareness. It is time to try anoth
er approach that will continue to build trust
with students rather than make police offi
cers just another road obstacle to be avoided
en route to class.
