## Stanford secrets revealed 
### 
I'm rounding the bend and headed into
the homestretch of my Stanford career.
After five years of reconnaissance work
on campus, today I bequeath to you, dear
reader, some of the priceless tricks, cheats
or simply little-known facts that make life
on The Farm a little bit easier.
1. During the first three weeks of every
quarter, log onto refund.stanford.edu to
take back special fees money from groups
you don't like. Depending on how big a
stingy jackass you are, you can reclaim $30
or more per quarter. A month or so later
you'll receive your very own ASSU eco
nomic stimulus package.
2. The J. Crew at the Stanford Shopping
Center gives a 10 percent discount to stu
dents. Whether you want to spend $65 on a
belt with a lobster-claw buckle is your busi
ness.
3. At the end of winter quarter, the
Bookstore offers shoppers a plush cow doll
for every $100 you spend. Stock up on hun
dred dollars worth of gift cards — money
you are going to spend on books for winter
and spring quarters anyway — and now you
have a few expensive-looking bovines to
give as Christmas presents to those relatives
who are still impressed you got into Stan
ford.
4. Want to avoid annoying your senior
friends? Stop asking what they're doing
next year. A lot of them don't have jobs yet,
and they will invariably resent you for being
the twelfth person this week to inquire. In
stead, ask your friends what they want to do
next year. If they have jobs, great. If not,
they probably have plenty of post-gradua
tion ideas, and they will be grateful you
asked such a thoughtful question.
5. It's fun to impress your visiting high
school friends with Stanford's lax open con
tainer law. But did you know you can also
drink openly on the Caltrain? During a trip
to the city two weeks ago, a passing conduc
tor nodded approvingly at my friends and
me as we sipped beers. He then scolded an
elderly woman for resting her feet on the
seat across from her.
6. John Bravman. vice provost for under
graduate education, donated $1,000 to
George W. Bush's re-election campaign in
2004, according to The Huffington Post. It's
not really a secret, and probably won't af
fect your time on campus, but after four
years, I still can't wrap my mind around that
fact.
7. Forget your SUID in your room? Too
cheap to buy a meal plan? No matter. Enter
any campus dining hall, grab a dirty cup

from the conveyor belt and stride past the
register without making eye contact with
the cashier. You'll look like a nice kid get
ting a refill of Mr. Pibb, and the card-swiper
will invariably be too busy to see that you've
helped yourself to a few vittles. Trust me on
this one.
8. You can borrow video games from
Green Library for free for one day (two if
you renew the title online). We're not talk
ing Duck Hunt here either: Green already
has a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV for PS3.
9. You can get five moving boxes from
the Alumni Center for free during the wan
ing days of spring quarter. You're technical
ly supposed to be a member of the Stanford
Alumni Association, but they usually don't
care enough to check.
10. Wear bug spray to graduation. I don't
know if it was a fluke, but the stadium grass
was teeming with gnat-like insects last year.
11. Can't tolerate that snaking, start-of
the-quartcr line at the Bookstore? You can
pay for books upstairs in the Apple store if
you're also buying a computer-related prod
uct. Grab a CD-Rand save valuable minutes
so you can resume not doing your work.
12. There may be no such thing as a free
lunch in the real world, but free food
abounds on campus. Today alone there is a
free noon lunch with The New York Times'
classical music critic, a lecture by the former
president of Peru followed by a reception
with complimentary appetizers and a talk
by Larry Brilliant, director of Google.org,
followed by a "mixer" (read: free alcohol
likely). Come for the booze, stay for the
schmooze.
Still in line at Subway? Kill another
minute and tally how many of these you al
ready knew.
