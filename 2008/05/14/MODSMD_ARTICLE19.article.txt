# You're Not Special
## We're not all in this together 
### 
I was recently having a discussion with a
friend of mine about how some univer
sities fold Queer Studies into their
Feminist Studies departments. 1 argued
that the two are part of separate move
ments that address separate ills. She insist
ed, however, that all movements for social
equality were related. She said that the
real evil was stereotyping in and of itself,
and that every affected minority should
come together to combat that underlying
problem.
But stereotypes are useful tools. I am
six feet and seven inches tall. I weigh 300
pounds. And I can beat up your dad. If you
saw me staring at you from a dark alley,
you would be terrified.
Some time ago, after two muggings oc
curred on campus, 1 was heading home
from Meyer Library. I was walking about
40 feet behind a female, who happened to
be walking in the same direction. Periodi
cally, she would glance back at me, and
then quicken her pace. Finally, she took a
long look back at me and then broke into a
sprint.
For awhile, I was very hurt that I would
be stereotyped, on looks alone, as a dan
gerous person. After awhile, though, my
hurt feelings gave way to understanding. It
makes sense to be frightened by someone
who looks like me.
Our minds are wired to generalize. We
extrapolate information about current sit
uations from past experiences, or from
whatever other salient facts we've run
across during our lives. We are at times
asked to make split-second decisions,

Our minds are wired to
generalize. We
extrapolate information
about current
situations from past
experiences.

sometimes on matters of life or death,
based on little more information than how
someone dresses or speaks. And as long as
different groups of people actually do act
in different manners, stereotyping will

continue to be a useful tool.
Prejudice cannot he combated by say
ing that the mere act of making assump
tions about certain groups on the basis of
past experience and available information
is wrong. The real problem is one of incor
rect stereotypes. And these can only be
combated by stripping away each set of
stereotypes through a long, slow, informa
tional campaign.
And that sort of outreach is boring. I'm
sure it feels terrible for groups that are vic
tims of false prejudices to try to justify
their actions and beliefs with studies, sta
tistics and examples of good behavior,
when they feel that no justification ought
to be necessary.
Nor is it particularly effective for dis
parate groups to join one, single umbrella
cause. In the minds of most prejudiced
people, their beliefs about different groups
are separate.
Also, some victims of prejudice are
themselves prejudiced. Some Asians want
to be accepted in white society, but are
afraid of African-Americans. Some
straight females who want to break the
glass ceiling believe that homosexual ac
tivity is immoral. Some homosexual men
treat women poorly.
Sadly, there is no help for me. 1 doubt
that any movement, no matter how organ
ized, will convince people not to feel
threatened if they are followed by a large,
disheveled man in the middle of the night.
