## EYEING THE PRIZE Stanford sets sights on NCAA repeat 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a long year of playing golf tourna
ments all over the country, the No. 7 Stanford
men's golf team's hard work all boils down to
its performance during the three-day NCAA
Regional tournament this weekend in Bre
merton, Wash. The Cardinal needs to earn
one of the coveted top-ten ranks to have a
chance to defend its title at the NCAA Cham
pionship tournament in Lafayette, Ind.
Though the Cardinal's previous perform
ances do not affect its qualification for the
NCAA Championships, they play a major
role in the team's confidence and momentum
entering this crucial qualifying competition.
Because the tournament is purely about
qualification, the Cardinal will be "getting
down to business" and will be solely fo
cused on making it to NCAA Champi
onships on the national stage.
"One of the things that we
were really good at last
year was only worry
ing about what

we can control," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "Not so much about who we were up
against, what conditions might present them
selves or what we should be doing. We are
only going to focus on our business. Everyone
knows that if we have our best day, there are
not many teams that can beat us."
Stanford has had to start from scratch this
year with the loss of sophomore Joseph
Bramlett to injury and three of its top golfers
graduating last year. To fill the gaps on the
team, Ray recruited some of the top fresh
men in the nation, all of who have played a
major role in the program's success as of late.
The team has built a new dynamic which has
resulted in major improvement over the
course of the year â€” Stanford has posted
eight top five team finishes out of ten total
events.
"It is exciting to see two freshmen [Steve
Ziegler and Sihwan Kim] play major roles
this year." Ray said. "It is huge to be able to
have a competitive team, especially without
Joe [Bramlett], which speaks a lot for the guys
on the team this year. We have built a deep
team and we have improved with each tour
nament, even if it is only a little bit. After
playing in many different situations with dif
ferent conditions, we have gained some valu
able experience going into the tournament."
Because they are such a young team, Stan
ford has been focusing on team work and
gaining experience by playing in highly com
petitive tournaments such as the U.S. Colle-

giate Championship, the Pac-10
Championship and the NCAA tour
naments.
In addition to the efforts of head
coach Ray, senior captain Rob
Grube has helped the team tremen
dously in his unifying role as team
captain to set an example with his
consistent play. He has recorded
eight top-25 finishes on the individ
ual ladder.
"Rob is the one and only leader of
our team." Kim said. "With his expe
rience and leadership, he was able to
help us build good team work during
the season. Our team unity is getting
better because we are more connect
ed than before and we really trust
each other when playing. Coach Ray
is also a main source of our team
work. He really pushes us to get the
job done and we all feel much happi
er when we win as a team."
The Cardinal has incorporated a
few new strategies into its arsenal
specifically in preparation for the
NCAA Championships. Stanford
has built a new, state-of-the-art facil
ity for the golf program that the team
has been able to use just in time for

post-season play.
The team has also faced rough
weather conditions that the Stanford
golf course does not present given
the perpetual good weather at the
Farm. In order to simulate different
conditions, Stanford golfers could be
spotted all over the Bay Area over
the past week, playing at the
Olympic golf course and other
courses in order to prepare for many
different situations that may present
themselves this weekend. But the
focus is not so much on physical
preparation, but more on mentally
preparing for the road ahead.
"If we can focus on managing
our own game, emotions and expec
tations, everything will take care of
itself," Ray said. "The guys are very
focused. Rob wants to go out with a
bang and has significantly improved
his short game. Sihwan has played a
lot of big events over his junior ca
reer and 1 think that the bigger the
event, the better he plays. We have a
lot going for us and, with golf, you
never know what you're going to
get."
Sihwan Kim gave a positive out
look for the Championship tourna
ment, specifically referencing the
team's desire to succeed.
"Overall, we didn't do too bad
this season but I think we did not
play up to our full potential as a

team." Kim said.'i really want to win
the NCAAs as a team and I hope
that we can play four rounds without
regrets. I'm a little nervous yet fired
up for my first NCAA [Tourna
ment). I plan to approach the tourna
ment with all the same intensity and
seriousness as previous competi
tions."
Stanford will have to battle 15 of
the top-50 teams in the nation this
week in order to seize a bid for the
Championships in Indiana.The Car
dinal has spent all season fine tuning
its game in order to make it this far.
And, both Ray and the golfers can't
help but think about the possibilities
of winning it all after last year's phe
nomenal performance.
"The feeling is really good right
now." Ray said. "We had a great
week of practice and we plan to
bring our best stuff before the season
is over. Stanford-type kids tend to
rise to the occasion.
"If we can just worry about our
selves and not the scores, we'll be in
good shape," he continued. "1 can't
help but think about the possibility
of getting it going and playing really
well.The winner could be anyone be
cause everyone has a fair chance to
win at NCAAs."
