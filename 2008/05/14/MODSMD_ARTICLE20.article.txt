## EYEING THE PRIZE Stanford sets sights on NCAA repeat 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After a long year of playing golf tourna
ments all over the country, the No. 7 Stanford
men's golf team's hard work all boils down to
its performance during the three-day NCAA
Regional tournament this weekend in Bre
merton, Wash. The Cardinal needs to earn
one of the coveted top-ten ranks to have a
chance to defend its title at the NCAA Cham
pionship tournament in Lafayette, Ind.
Though the Cardinal's previous perform
ances do not affect its qualification for the
NCAA Championships, they play a major
role in the team's confidence and momentum
entering this crucial qualifying competition.
Because the tournament is purely about
qualification, the Cardinal will be "getting
down to business" and will be solely fo
cused on making it to NCAA Champi
onships on the national stage.
"One of the things that we
were really good at last
year was only worry
ing about what

we can control," head coach Conrad Ray
said. "Not so much about who we were up
against, what conditions might present them
selves or what we should be doing. We are
only going to focus on our business. Everyone
knows that if we have our best day, there are
not many teams that can beat us."
Stanford has had to start from scratch this
year with the loss of sophomore Joseph
Bramlett to injury and three of its top golfers
graduating last year. To fill the gaps on the
team, Ray recruited some of the top fresh
men in the nation, all of who have played a
major role in the program's success as of late.
The team has built a new dynamic which has
resulted in major improvement over the
course of the year â€” Stanford has posted
eight top five team finishes out of ten total
events.
"It is exciting to see two freshmen [Steve
Ziegler and Sihwan Kim] play major roles
this year." Ray said. "It is huge to be able to
have a competitive team, especially without
Joe [Bramlett], which speaks a lot for the guys
on the team this year. We have built a deep
team and we have improved with each tour
nament, even if it is only a little bit. After
playing in many different situations with dif
ferent conditions, we have gained some valu
able experience going into the tournament."
Because they are such a young team, Stan
ford has been focusing on team work and
gaining experience by playing in highly com
petitive tournaments such as the U.S. Colle-

Senior captain Rob Grube lined up a putt at Stanford last month. Grube is the undisputed leader of
this year's team and has been crucial in getting the younger players to bond.
