# Kobe: another look
## 
### 
I was watching the Boston Celtics-
Leßron James game last night
(there were some other players
involved too. I think they were from
somewhere in Ohio) when I was
struck by a shockingly irrelevant
thought. The announcers were dis
cussing other ongoing playoff series
when they came to the injury status
of Kobe Bryant.
It was at this point that the
strangely irrelevant thought came,
for no particular reason 1 could fath
om at the time: You know what. I bet
he vvwvinnocent.
Now. that statement comes not
because I had previously presumed
him to be guilty, though like most
people I probably have a tendency to
read too much into the hubbub be
fore any celebrity trial. Nor was it be
cause I suddenly put all the pieces to
gether in Holmesian fashion, deduc
ing at long last that perhaps LA's
brightest star couldn't possibly have
been guilty of sexual assault in 2(X)3.
No. my understanding of that case
is entirely superficial and my shift in
thought came more from just a gut
feeling than any basis in fact. As
Stephen Colbert might say. I found
something "truthy" and latched on. It
was particularly irrelevant in that it
didn't give me a new appreciation for
Kobe at all. He is still a great player
whose personal life probably should
n't be emulated by children (one way
or another, after all. it is pretty clear
that Kobe at the very least cheated or
attempted to cheat on his wife).
But rather it was the realization
yet again of just how true it is that
perception is reality, especially in the
media-rampant environment of pro

fessional sports. Because 1 bet I'm
not alone in moments like these —
when you suddenly see an athlete in
a slightly different light and realize
just how much perception, as op
posed to fact, has to do with his pub
lic image. Because now, five years
after the incident in Colorado, 1
think Kobe is finally being forgiven
both for his hotel indiscretions and
for his much publicized rift with
Shaq that ended up in the Big Fella
being shipped off to Miami.
It's like Kobe had to be the anti
hero for a while before people could
come back and realize just how tal
ented he is. You've got to fall from
grace to be redeemed, and if Bryant
and the newly rejuvenated Lakers
can make enough noise in this post
season. I think that journey will be
complete. Because even playing
through an injury, Kobe was the
most important player in his most re
cent game against the Utah Jazz.
That's just the kind of player he is,
and now that he has a decent sup
porting cast once again, he seems
like he's out to prove it to the world
every night.
It's similar to an analogy Steve
Young uses often as an analyst on
ESPN — in sports, you are what you
seem to be. The "fiery leader," like
Brett Favre for instance, doesn't
have to make a tremendous Knute
Rockne-esque style speech before
every big game because his team
mates, presumably, already view him
as a leader.
A simple word or two, a nod, or
even a glance was enough to get his
teammates to fall in line behind their
veteran quarterback. Contrastingly,
if Adam 'Pacman' Jones so much as
sneezes in the presence of a law en
forcement officer in the coming year
and the NFL or the media gets wind
of it, his career could be over.
In the postseason, though, where

legacies are truly born and sus
tained. it's all the more obvious how
Kobe's legacy is being reshaped
even as we watch. His presence on
the court,obviously,is practically be
yond compare. You could make an
argument for perhaps a handful of
players being more valuable than
Bryant, in part because they are
younger — Leßron James, Chris
Paul, and Pwight Howard come to
mind.
But I don't think you can make
the argument that anyone means
more to his team's chances this year
than Bryant, regardless that he is
currently hurting. That's why he's
the MVP. And the fact that he may
just be, not only the most valuable,
but also the most talented and the
best player on any court any given
night only adds to the sense of awe
that has suddenly returned in
watching Lakers games. Before, it
was all about Kobe and Shaq. Now
it's about Kobe and Co. Big differ
ence.
To be sure. 1 don't expect the re
appreciation of a truly astounding
athlete to happen overnight. Nor do
1 expect that everyone will someday
decide overnight that maybe Kobe
has been judged a bit unfairly for
various off-the-court accusations.
But it is enough to make me wonder
what would happen if Barry Bonds
had been young enough that he'd
been caught up in the steroids con
troversy in the middle of his career
rather than at the end.
If Bonds had enough years left in
him to continue playing past the
point at which people will inevitably
realize that heaping all the sins of an
entire generation of baseball players
onto Bonds' shoulders, maybe that
perception would shift as well. As it
is though, that ship has probably
sailed.
But Kobe's? Well, in the court of
public opinion, maybe his has just
come in. Again.
