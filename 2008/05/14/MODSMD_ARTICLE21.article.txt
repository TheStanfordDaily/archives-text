# Kobe: another look
## 
### 
I was watching the Boston Celtics-
Le√üron James game last night
(there were some other players
involved too. I think they were from
somewhere in Ohio) when I was
struck by a shockingly irrelevant
thought. The announcers were dis
cussing other ongoing playoff series
when they came to the injury status
of Kobe Bryant.
It was at this point that the
strangely irrelevant thought came,
for no particular reason 1 could fath

he vvwvinnocent.
Now. that statement comes not
because I had previously presumed
him to be guilty, though like most
people I probably have a tendency to
read too much into the hubbub be
fore any celebrity trial. Nor was it be
cause I suddenly put all the pieces to
gether in Holmesian fashion, deduc
ing at long last that perhaps LA's
brightest star couldn't possibly have
been guilty of sexual assault in 2(X)3.
No. my understanding of that case
is entirely superficial and my shift in
thought came more from just a gut
feeling than any basis in fact. As
Stephen Colbert might say. I found
something "truthy" and latched on. It
was particularly irrelevant in that it
didn't give me a new appreciation for
Kobe at all. He is still a great player
whose personal life probably should
n't be emulated by children (one way
or another, after all. it is pretty clear
that Kobe at the very least cheated or
attempted to cheat on his wife).
But rather it was the realization
yet again of just how true it is that
perception is reality, especially in the
media-rampant environment of pro
