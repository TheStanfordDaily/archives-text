# Bogey in three-way playoff hole costs Card NCAA final bid
## 
### 
day's third round in a three-way tie
for the eighth and final spot, which
led to a one-hole playoff to deter
mine which squad would move on.
"I think that as a whole we were
very psyched going into the playoff.
We were really excited because we
were given another chance to prove
ourselves," said sophomore Catheri
na Wang.
No. 23 Stanford faced off against
No. 36 Ohio State and unranked UC-
Davis. The Cardinal and the Buck
eyes both shot plus-one on the hole,
but the Aggies trumped both teams:
with a score of minus-one, UC-Davis
won the playoff to claim the final bid
to the NCAA Championships.
"Unfortunately we were unable
to produce the results," said Wang.
The playoff concluded a weekend
where the Cardinal's team scores fell
in each round, which led to a subse
quent fall in the rankings each day.
After the first round, Stanford sat
in a tie for sixth place. Freshman Re
becca Durham — whose play had
gotten steadily better as the season
progressed — led the Cardinal with
an even 72. Sophomore Angela King
was right behind her teammate at
plus-one.
Stanford's solid play put the team
in good position to grab a champi

sued, and Stanford could not pull out
a win.
Still, the Cardinal had a number
of impressive individual perform
ances throughout the weekend. King
shot one-under-par in the final
round. Stanford's lone below-par
score of the tournament. King fin
ished the regional at one-over-par
and in eleventh place in the individ
ual rankings.
Durham entered the clubhouse at
plus-five, a score good enough for
her third top-25 finish of the year.
"Angela and Rebecca had a great
tournament," said Wang.
Wang ended at plus-nine, and jun
ior Mari Chun, normally Stanford's
star, had one of her worst results of
the year: she shot plus-13, overall.
Freshman Piper Miller, the final
Stanford golfer, finished at plus-32.
I believe Mari, Piper, and I were
disappointed with our results be
cause we definitely had the ability to
do better but we didn't live up to our
expectations," said Wang.
No. 2 USC, the Pac-10 champions,
won the tournament by a staggering
15 shots as a team, they finished
nine-under. No. 4 Arizona State was
a distant second, and No. 47 UNLV
was even further off at third. UC-
Davis was the only unranked team
in the nation to advance to the
NCAA Championship.
Stanford's season now comes to a
close, a disappointing follow up to
last year, when the Cardinal won the
West Regional and placed fifth in
the championship tournament.
"As a team we did not fair as well
as last year and definitely did not
fair as well as we have hoped for,"
said Wang. "However, we are a very
young team and we have a lot of po
tential and we're hoping to work
harder and hopefully improve next
year."
