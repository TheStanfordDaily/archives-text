HOUSTON - Saying the
NCAA has "new information,"
president Myles Brand promised
to investigate former Southern
California basketball star O.J.
Mayo, who allegedly received
thousands of dollars in gifts from
money given to an event promoter
by a sports agency.
On Sunday, ESPN reported that
Bill Duffy Associates provided
Rodney Guillory with about
$200,000 before Mayo arrived at
USC. Louis Johnson, a former as
sociate of Mayo's, told "Outside
the Lines" that Mayo received
about $30,000 and other benefits

from Guillory while in high school
and during his one season at USC.
Brand, speaking Tuesday in
Houston to kick off this week's Di
vision II National Championships
Festival, said that "our enforce
ment division has new informa
tion" about Mayo's case "and as a
matter of fact, when we have new
information on any case, we will in
vestigate."
He would not comment further
on the specifics of Mayo's case.
Duffy denied any illegal activity
involving Mayo on Monday, but
USC acknowledged that the school
is working with the NCAA and the
Pac-10"in a cooperative investiga
tion to review these new allega
tions."

NCAA rules prohibit giving col
lege athletes money or other gifts.
Brand said the schools have more
of a direct obligation than the
NCAA to shield their athletes
from sports agents, boosters and
other outsiders.
"We are not the cops on the cor
ner," Brand said. "The schools
themselves have the responsibility
to follow the rules and that means,
and includes, separating agents
from interfering with student-ath
letes."
Brand said he has no say on
whether the NBA will raise its age
limit when the current collective
bargaining agreement expires in
-2011. Currently, the league's mini
mum age is 19. Mayo turned 20 in
November and joined the growing
number of players who play one
season in college and bolt for the
pros.
Brand would like to see the NBA
require players to stay in school for
"two, three or four years," but says

he's powerless to sway any decision.
"The NCAA has no ability to in
fluence, in any way. the age rule," he
said. "So any age limitation rules,
the 19-year-olds who are so-called
"one and done," are the result of
bargaining negotiation between the
NBA and the players' association.
The NCAA was not involved in any
way in that bargaining in setting up
the rule. Only the NBA manage
ment and the players association set
those rules."
Brand said he won't be afraid to
sanction USC or any other high

profile school caught in violation of
NCAA rules. He admitted that pun
ishing the schools sometimes is not
enough to deter agents and other
outsiders from influencing players
with cash, gifts or other benefits.
"This is not acceptable behavior
and on occasion, it's illegal," Brand
said. "You get thrown in jail if you
rob a bank, but people keep robbing
banks. The fact of the matter is these
kinds of activities are unacceptable,
they are unfortunate. We expect the
schools to enforce the rules and pro
tect our student-athletes."
