SAN JOSE, Calif. - The San Jose
Sharks fired coach Ron Wilson on
Monday after his club followed an
other outstanding regular season
with yet another early exit from the
Stanley Cup playoffs.
The Sharks won the Pacific Divi
sion title and compiled the NHL's
second-best record with 49 wins and
108 points, but the Dallas Stars
knocked them out of the second
round in six games on May 4. San
Jose has ended its past three seasons
with six-game losses in the second
round, and general manager Doug
Wilson decided his coach would
take the fall for his talented playoff
underachievers.
"Sometimes the class needs a
new professor, and sometimes the
professor needs a new class," said
Doug Wilson, who claimed the
Sharks played only "five good play
off games" among their 13 postsea
son outings this spring.
The Sharks led the NHL in total
victories over the past four seasons,
but San Jose never repeated its trip
to the 2004 Western Conference fi
nals in the last three years despite
fielding one of the NHL's most tal

ented rosters starring former MVP
Joe Thornton, captain Patrick Mar
leau and goalie Evgeni Nabokov.
Ron Wilson, who coached nine
seasons in Anaheim and Washing
ton before joining San Jose, became
the Sharks' leader in victories and
winning percentage while going
206-134-45 and winning two divi
sion titles during 4 1/2 seasons be
hind their bench. His 518 victories
are the eighth-most in NHL history,
trailing only Mike Keenan and
Bryan Murray among active coach
es, and he's ninth with 1,091 career
games coached.
"In most ways I was shocked
when Doug told me, but in some
ways I guess I was not surprised,"
Ron Wilson said in a telephone in
terview. "When it happens when
you don't expect it, you're disap
pointed. 1 can honestly say that 1
couldn't be prouder of my work
here. I think our team's record
speaks for itself. Obviously we did
n't win a Stanley Cup while 1 was
here. I'm disappointed in that as any
coach would be."
Rob Zettler and Tim Hunter,
Ron Wilson's respected assistant
coaches,remained under contract to
the Sharks and will be candidates in
Doug Wilson's coaching search, the
general manager said.
After putting together a 20-game
streak without a regulation defeat
shortly before the regular season
ended, the second-seeded Sharks
seemed poised for their playoff
breakthrough, with many experts

picking them to win their first title.
San Jose tenaciously held off
Keenan's Calgary Flames in the
first round before falling into an 0-3
hole to the Stars in the tight second
round series, which featured four
overtime games.
"I can't control guys falling
down," Ron Wilson said, remem
bering the decisive goal in San
Jose's Game 2 loss to Dallas, which
was set up by Joe Pavelski's prat
falling turnover to Brad Richards. "I
can't control bounces in the play
offs. I would play that series again

and go in with the same game plan.
You out-chance and outshoot a
team, and sometimes it isn't meant
to be."
Wilson, who also has coached the
U.S. national team on several occa
sions, is likely to be a candidate for
most NHL coaching vacancies if he
decides to jump right back behind a
bench. Colorado, Florida and Toron
to currently have openings, but Wil
son said his first priority is to decom
press back home in South Carolina
before a summer which includes his
oldest daughter's wedding.
