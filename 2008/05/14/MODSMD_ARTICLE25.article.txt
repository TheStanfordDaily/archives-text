SAN JOSE, Calif. - The San Jose
Sharks fired coach Ron Wilson on
Monday after his club followed an
other outstanding regular season
with yet another early exit from the
Stanley Cup playoffs.
The Sharks won the Pacific Divi
sion title and compiled the NHL's
second-best record with 49 wins and
108 points, but the Dallas Stars
knocked them out of the second
round in six games on May 4. San
Jose has ended its past three seasons
with six-game losses in the second
round, and general manager Doug
Wilson decided his coach would
take the fall for his talented playoff
underachievers.
"Sometimes the class needs a
new professor, and sometimes the
professor needs a new class," said
Doug Wilson, who claimed the
Sharks played only "five good play
off games" among their 13 postsea
son outings this spring.
The Sharks led the NHL in total
victories over the past four seasons,
but San Jose never repeated its trip
to the 2004 Western Conference fi
nals in the last three years despite
fielding one of the NHL's most tal

ented rosters starring former MVP
Joe Thornton, captain Patrick Mar
leau and goalie Evgeni Nabokov.
Ron Wilson, who coached nine
seasons in Anaheim and Washing
ton before joining San Jose, became
the Sharks' leader in victories and
winning percentage while going
206-134-45 and winning two divi
sion titles during 4 1/2 seasons be
hind their bench. His 518 victories
are the eighth-most in NHL history,
trailing only Mike Keenan and
Bryan Murray among active coach
es, and he's ninth with 1,091 career
games coached.
"In most ways I was shocked
when Doug told me, but in some
ways I guess I was not surprised,"
Ron Wilson said in a telephone in
terview. "When it happens when
you don't expect it, you're disap
pointed. 1 can honestly say that 1
couldn't be prouder of my work
here. I think our team's record
speaks for itself. Obviously we did
n't win a Stanley Cup while 1 was
here. I'm disappointed in that as any
coach would be."
Rob Zettler and Tim Hunter,
Ron Wilson's respected assistant
coaches,remained under contract to
