# Stem cell research gets major boost
## $43.5 million poured into new building, expected to draw researches 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Stem cell research at Stanford
got a boost last week when the
California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)
announced the distribution of $271
million in grants to build stem cell
laboratories in universities and
institutions statewide. Stanford
took home the biggest chunk of
the money, with $43.5 million
going toward a new research
building.
"All the major details that the
architects and builders need are in
place," said Michael Clarke, a pro

gram director of Stanford's Cancer
Stem Cell Research Program.
The four-story, 200,000 square
foot building has been in the
works since 2001, and Stanford
hopes it will draw researchers
interested in various aspects of
stem cell biology.
The CIRM. California's stem
cell research agency, was created
after California voters passed
Proposition 71 in November 2004,
allocating $3 billion in research
grants. California leads the pack in
funding stem cell research — so
far, all other states combined have
pledged just over $1 billion.
"California has always had fair

ly progressive thinking," Clarke
said. "(Voters] felt stem cells had a
lot of promise for helping many,
many human diseases."
Clarke's lab currently studies
the way in which existing stem
cells generate new stem cells — an
important topic in recent medical
research.
"It's the same mechanism by
which cancer cells make tumors."
Clarke explained.
The CIRM has previously allo
cated money to fund training and
research programs for various sci
entific groups. Money from the
CIRM is important to the field of
stem cell biology, because funds
from federal agencies like the
National Institutes of Health can
only go to a limited number of lab
oratories. Because the stem cells in
question are derived from human
embryos. President George W.
Bush declared that no federal
funds could be used to create new
embryonic stem cell lines after
August 2001, and research conduct
ed with any other lines would not
be eligible for federal funding.
"There's nothing illegal about
doing research on the other cell
lines, but you cannot use federal
funds to do it," said Roeland Nusse,
who is also a program director of
Stanford's Cancer Stem Cell
Research Program.
Seven years after Bush's fund
ing announcement, scientists are
increasingly looking beyond the so

called Presidential cell lines, as the
approved stem cells are aging, and
scientists have lost several lines
due to mutations. In addition, the
small number of Presidential lines
means a particular genotype might
not be available for study.
Federal restrictions can also
complicate life in research labs.
Regulations state that even equip
ment purchased with federal funds
may not be used to conduct
research on non-approved stem
cells. For this reason, a stem cell
biologist may be forced to use two
incubators — one for Presidential
cell lines and one for any others.
Nusse said he expects many of
the research restrictions will be
softened when the next U.S. presi
dent takes office. But Stanford's
new building will be designed to
circumvent federal funding regula
tions.
"Not even the pipes delivering
the water will be paid for with fed
eral funding," Nusse said.
