# Stem cell research gets major boost
## $43.5 million poured into new building, expected to draw researches 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Stem cell research at Stanford
got a boost last week when the
California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)
announced the distribution of $271
million in grants to build stem cell
laboratories in universities and
institutions statewide. Stanford
took home the biggest chunk of
the money, with $43.5 million
going toward a new research
building.
"All the major details that the
architects and builders need are in
place," said Michael Clarke, a pro

gram director of Stanford's Cancer
Stem Cell Research Program.
The four-story, 200,000 square
foot building has been in the
works since 2001, and Stanford
hopes it will draw researchers
interested in various aspects of
stem cell biology.
The CIRM. California's stem
cell research agency, was created
after California voters passed
Proposition 71 in November 2004,
allocating $3 billion in research
grants. California leads the pack in
funding stem cell research — so
far, all other states combined have
pledged just over $1 billion.
"California has always had fair

ly progressive thinking," Clarke
said. "(Voters] felt stem cells had a
lot of promise for helping many,
many human diseases."
Clarke's lab currently studies
the way in which existing stem
cells generate new stem cells — an
important topic in recent medical
research.
"It's the same mechanism by
which cancer cells make tumors."
Clarke explained.
The CIRM has previously allo
cated money to fund training and
research programs for various sci
entific groups. Money from the
