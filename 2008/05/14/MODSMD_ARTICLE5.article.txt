There was an elephant in the room at Tuesday night's
Undergraduate Senate meeting — the word partisanship.
Last nights meeting, the first with Tiq Chapa *10 as
chair, quickly degenerated into a partisan mudslinging con
test. as senators duked it out over appointments to the
Appropriations Committee, all while trying their best to
avoid saying the "p word."
Outgoing ASSU Vice President Mondaire Jones '09
was the first to broach the subject, alleging that partisan
ship was the reason for the uproar over Appropriations
Committee appointments. Of the eight appointed mem-
hers, four sport Students of Colored
Coalition (SOCC) endorsements, and
four do not.
But Senator Luukas lives '09 —
outspoken in his criticism of the
Appropriations appointments — was
quick to dismiss Jones' allegation.
"1 wasn't aware of partisanship,"
lives responded. "I didn't bring it up
in this meeting; you [Jones] did."
While Chapa was SOCC
endorsed, lives was not. lives held up
the banner for the non-SOCC
endorsed senators at the meeting,
though he never explicitly admitted
that partisanship was driving his
actions.
But the partisan tone of the meet
ing was set before it even began. An
email sent by lives to several senators
explained a strategy in which he and
his allies would use parliamentary
measures to "block business in the
Senate" as a means of criticizing
Chapa's committee appointments.
The email suggested several ways
to bring the meeting to a grinding

halt, including repeatedly calling for
"motions to waste time" which
require all senators to be silent for
one minute, and dividing questions so
that numerous roll call votes were
required.
But lives' email, which was
intended only for a specific group of
senators, was printed and distributed
to all the senators at the meeting.
Although he admitted that the email
found its way onto the Senate floor
by mistake — the senator mistyped
an address while sending it — lives
insisted that his tactics were not
underhanded.
"There was nothing sneaky about
the email." lives said. "This is normal
in any legislature."
Despite the unintended circulation
of his strategy email, lives did not hes
itate to use stalling techniques to his
advantage.
After his proposal to make Orr
Keshet '09 the ninth member of the
appropriations committee failed 8-6
when deputy chair Shelley Gao '11
voted no, lives motioned for a roll call
vote on each of the 36 committee
appointments. Gao, who originally
asked secretary Tim Ford TO to come
back to her, paused for two minutes
when casting her vote.
Partisan fighting came to the fore
front of the Senate debate largely
because of what some senators per
ceived as Chapa's failure to adequate
ly justify his choices for
Appropriations Committee member
ship. Of the 11 senators who applied.
Chapa denied membership to himself,
along with two non-SOCC-endorsed

senators — Prachi Priyam '11 and
Keshet.
Because of his position as chair.
Chapa deferred to the preferences of
other senators, as has been done in
the past. But Chapa's failure to pro
vide a reason for excluding Priyam
and Keshet heightened tension in the
room.
"Tiq promised, right before his
election, that he would take factors
like senator expertise into account,
and that he would run a fair process,"
lives said. "He did not take these
things into account, and he did not
run an open process. It is difficult to
call this fair."
lives, who butted heads with
Chapa throughout the meeting, was
openly critical of the new chair's per
formance.
"He said explicitly, 'I am going to
look at senators' expertise, whether
they do a good job,"' lives said of
Chapa. "1 don't know whether he is
lying or just reneging on what he
promised he'd do."
But Chapa told The Daily that
evaluating senators' abilities was not
necessary.
"There is no precedent for that,"
Chapa said. "I believe that all 11 [who
applied] were competent."
Chapa insisted that it was not nec
essary to contact all 11 applicants and
evaluate their abilities, and that his
choices were completely random.
"It was tough," Chapa said. "To be
honest, there were 11 [competent
applicants] and I did roll the dice."
For lives, however, Chapa's dice
roll was not satisfactory, especially
considering that both senators exclud
ed from the committee were not
endorsed by SOCC.
"Tiq didn't provide any convincing
explanation that would lead you not
to believe that SOCC affiliation was a
factor in the decisions he made," lives
said. "There was no evidence to the
contrary, besides his claim that he
rolled on the dice. A roll of the dice is
not an acceptable metric."
