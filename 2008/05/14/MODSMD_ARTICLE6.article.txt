## Alternatives to Middle East major offered Other top schools offer majors in Near or Middle Eastern Studies 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While its peer universities offer dedicated
Near or Middle Eastern Studies programs for
undergraduates, Stanford's opportunities in
Middle Eastern studies are less centralized.
Harvard, Yale and Princeton offer degree
granting programs in Near Eastern Studies or
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and
UC-Berkeley offers a program in Middle
Eastern Studies. But Stanford does not offer a
major in Near or Middle Eastern Studies.
Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani, director of
the Center for Iranian Studies, said Stanford's
current situation came about as a result of
choices in the University's past.
"The reason for it is a strategic decision
Stanford [made] maybe 30 to 40 years ago, to
focus on the Soviet Union and Africa," Milani
said. "And they made, 1 think, a very costly
strategic decision."
Milani, however, felt that the University's
program offerings have improved in recent
years.
