## Alternatives to Middle East major offered Other top schools offer majors in Near or Middle Eastern Studies 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While its peer universities offer dedicated
Near or Middle Eastern Studies programs for
undergraduates, Stanford's opportunities in
Middle Eastern studies are less centralized.
Harvard, Yale and Princeton offer degree
granting programs in Near Eastern Studies or
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and
UC-Berkeley offers a program in Middle
Eastern Studies. But Stanford does not offer a
major in Near or Middle Eastern Studies.
Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani, director of
the Center for Iranian Studies, said Stanford's
current situation came about as a result of
choices in the University's past.
"The reason for it is a strategic decision
Stanford [made] maybe 30 to 40 years ago, to
focus on the Soviet Union and Africa," Milani
said. "And they made, 1 think, a very costly
strategic decision."
Milani, however, felt that the University's
program offerings have improved in recent
years.
"As the Soviet Union fell and the
Middle East became more promi
nent, [Stanford] realized the Middle
East was the big kahuna," Milani
said. "They made a decision belated
ly, that they were going to fill this
gap"
Milani highlighted the diversity of
opportunities currently available as a
solid base for continued improve
ments.
"With the Iranian studies. Islamic
studies and Jewish studies programs
here, I think we have a good base to
go forward." he said. "I think we are
on our way to having enough of a
variety in these departments — and
in history, art, political science cours
es — that I think a major program is
a possibility in the not-too-distant
future."
For the moment, undergraduates
pursuing a formal course of study
focused on the entire region rely on
the minor in Middle Eastern

Languages, Literatures and Cultures.
The minor is coordinated through the
African and Middle Eastern
Languages and Literature (AME)
program and offers tracks in both
Arabic and Hebrew, as well as
grounding in both language study
and non-language cultural courses in
Anthropology, Comparative
Literature, History or Religious
Studies.
"From my perspective, I really like
the idea of a minor," said Senior
Lecturer Vered Shemtov, who coordi
nates Hebrew within the AME pro
gram. 'it's been growing tremen
dously in the last few years. It allows
students to earn the minor, and then
to major in something like
International Relations."
Senior Lecturer Khalil Barhoum,
the coordinator of the minor pro
gram who teaches Arabic classes, also
believes the program has achieved
success with students.
"We've had a very happy clientele
so far," Barhoum said, "and we rival
any other institution in terms of our
retention rate. Arabic is often hard,
and student numbers fall over the
years, but our retention rate has

remained exemplary."
Both Shemtov and Barhoum
allowed for the possibility of the pro
gram's future expansion into a major.
"Students ask often for an Arabic
major," Barhoum said.
"I would like it if there's interest,"
Shemtov added.
The AME program is affiliated
with other cultural centers on campus
that serve the region as well, includ
ing the Abbasi Program in Islamic
Studies and the Taube Center for
Jewish Studies, which offer support
and guidance for students pursuing
courses of study in the field.
Students also have the option of
pursuing an Individually Designed
Major in association with either pro
gram, though the process is not insti
tutionalized and still requires a more
rigorous approval process than a nor
mal major.
Undergraduates interested in the
Middle East can also pursue regional
focuses in History. Religious Studies.
International Relations and other
departmental programs.
