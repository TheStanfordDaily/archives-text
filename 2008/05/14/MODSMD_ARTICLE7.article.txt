# FROM MORAGA TO MAPLES
## Incoming freshman Jack Trotter brings relief to ravaged team 
### SARAH OHR 
With the recent loss of Brook and Robin Lopez, as well
as facing the transition into his first head coaching job after
being an assistant at Duke, Stanford men's basketball coach
Johnny Dawkins has his work cut out for him in building a
strong team ready to take on the 2009 season.
Some relief may have come, however, in the form of a 6-
foot-9, 205-pound forward from Campolindo High in the
nearby town of Moraga. His name is Jack Totter and the
freshman-to-be is the newest addition to the Cardinal ros
ter. With a GPA of 4.2, Trotter signed his letter of intent as
a preferred walk-on and just might be the diamond in the
rough that can help the squad down low.
He made the decision to don the Cardinal jersey as a
preferred walk-on after turning down scholarships else
where.
"St. Mary's offered me a scholarship and UC-Davis
offered me a scholarship," he said.
Trotter has numerous family connections to Stanford.
He will be the ninth in his family to attend the University
and the first to play a varsity sport for the Cardinal.
Trotter's father played basketball at Occidental College.
His family's tradition did not seem to influence his deci
sion too much.Trotter's parents were supportive during the
recruiting process.
"The decision was ultimately his, and his alone," said his
father, Dave Trotter J.D. '80. "Because of the strong family
ties to Stanford, he has been making visits to Palo Alto for
football games since he was a toddler. I am sure that these
ties played a role in his decision, as well as the desire to play
college basketball in the Pac-10."
"Stanford was always somewhere I was interested in,"
