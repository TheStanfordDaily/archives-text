# FROM MORAGA TO MAPLES
## Incoming freshman Jack Trotter brings relief to ravaged team 
### SARAH OHR 
With the recent loss of Brook and Robin Lopez, as well
as facing the transition into his first head coaching job after
being an assistant at Duke, Stanford men's basketball coach
Johnny Dawkins has his work cut out for him in building a
strong team ready to take on the 2009 season.
Some relief may have come, however, in the form of a 6-
foot-9, 205-pound forward from Campolindo High in the
nearby town of Moraga. His name is Jack Totter and the
freshman-to-be is the newest addition to the Cardinal ros
ter. With a GPA of 4.2, Trotter signed his letter of intent as
a preferred walk-on and just might be the diamond in the
rough that can help the squad down low.
He made the decision to don the Cardinal jersey as a
preferred walk-on after turning down scholarships else
where.
"St. Mary's offered me a scholarship and UC-Davis
offered me a scholarship," he said.
Trotter has numerous family connections to Stanford.
He will be the ninth in his family to attend the University
and the first to play a varsity sport for the Cardinal.
Trotter's father played basketball at Occidental College.
His family's tradition did not seem to influence his deci
sion too much.Trotter's parents were supportive during the
recruiting process.
"The decision was ultimately his, and his alone," said his
father, Dave Trotter J.D. '80. "Because of the strong family
ties to Stanford, he has been making visits to Palo Alto for
football games since he was a toddler. I am sure that these
ties played a role in his decision, as well as the desire to play
college basketball in the Pac-10."
"Stanford was always somewhere I was interested in,"

Incoming freshman Jack Trotter is the ninth in his family to come to the Farm
but the first to don the cardinal and white in varsity athletics.
Jack Trotter echoed.
Trotter signed to play for the Car
dinal after getting in contact with both
previous coach Trent Johnson and
Dawkins.
"1 sent in some game film and that
put me on the radar,"Trotter said.
His late surge in high school play
was also undoubtedly helpful in get
ting him on the map. As of his junior
year. Trotter had only averaged 11.8
points per game, but come his senior
season he really hit his stride. He had
a breakout year with 24.1 points and
13.6 rebounds per game, and led
Campolindo to a North Coast Section
Division 111 title.
"[Trotter is] one of the most under
recruited guys for his ability," his high
school coach Chris Whirlow told the
San Francisco Chronicle. "Potentially,
he could be twice the player he is in six
months."
His parents are also anxious to see
what he can do at the collegiate level.
"Obviously, [his mother] and I are
very proud of Jack's achievements on
the basketball floor," said Dave Trot
ter. "He has worked very hard over
the past two or three years to elevate
his game and be in a position to attract

attention from the Stanford coaching
staff."
Jack Trotter seems to believe that
now it is time to work hardest in the
weight room.
"'The biggest transition [to colle
giate basketball] will be with the size
of the players," said Trotter. "Dealing
with that will be very important be
cause of my position."
Coach Dawkins most certainly
hopes that Trotter can make this tran
sition easily and quickly. With Brook
and Robin Lopez out of the picture,
and with recent losses in the incoming
freshman class due to the coaching

"Potentially, he could
be twice the player
he is in six months."

change.Trotter is certainly going to be
given the opportunity to prove him
self on a Cardinal squad that is des
perately lacking in the post.
"[Dawkins] made it clear that 1
wasn't coming just to be a practice
player,"Trotter said. "There would be
opportunities to compete for playing
time. A few weeks ago [Stanford] was
pretty deep at forward, but they lost a
few players with the coaching
change."
This loss includes Miles Plumlee, a
6-foot-10 power forward from North
Carolina. Plumlee recently asked to
be released from his letter of intent
and ironically plans to play for Duke,
the school Dawkins just left.
"(The coaching change) may have
hurt a little â€” it caused a loss of con
tinuity," said Trotter. "But coach
Dawkins is more than qualified."
Dawkins will have the chance to
show just that if the Cardinal can con
tinue to pick up players with Trotter's
attitude, as the program looks to fill
the holes left by the tumultuous 2008
off-season.
