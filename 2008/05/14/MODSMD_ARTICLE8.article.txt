## Housing apps face Web lock Heavy deadline traffic caused delays, confusion 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Several students reported seeing
incorrect information on their
online housing applications around
the 6 p.m. draw deadline this past
Sunday, finding wrong email
addresses, inaccurate rankings and
mistaken priority assignments on
Axess.
Director of Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan said in an
email to The Daily that students
reported seeing wrong information
during periods of heavy Internet
traffic, as students were editing their
rankings up until the 6 p.m. pub
lished deadline. She said whatever
errors appeared on students'
screens were not present in the edit
ed applications they had successful
ly submitted to Housing
Assignments.
"When students contacted us
over the weekend, we asked them
to review the applications again
themselves and we also looked
them up in our database view,"
Nunan said. "In every case we have
confirmed that the application was
stored with the correct informa
tion."
"When we asked them to log
back in, the correct information
appeared," Nunan added. "This
[problem] was limited to the infor
mation displayed to the students,
and does not reflect what is stored
in our database."
Nunan said that her office had
not encountered problems like this

before but that it was taking steps
to make sure students' applications
are complete and accurate.
"We have and will continue to
perform exhaustive data audits
when situations such as this occur,"
Nunan said. "Students are contact
ed if their applications have been
compromised. In this case, we do
not see any applications that are
showing incorrect information."
Students reported seeing incor
rect email addresses displayed on
their applications while others
found themselves unable to log in.
Some students also reported see
ing priority numbers assigned to
them for houses that they had not
ranked. These numbers disap
peared after they logged out and
subsequently signed in again.
"Priorities are entered by the pri
ority representatives," Nunan said.
"Students should log into their
applications in Axess and review
their priorities. If they are not seeing
their priority they should contact

their priority representative and be
sure the priority was entered."
Brian Howald '09 said he spent
several hours trying to access his
housing application Sunday, and
when he had finally gotten a chance
to submit his edited rankings, he
received an error message from the
Web site.
"I didn't know what to do
because it had taken me an hour to
get to this point, and the prospect of
waiting several minutes for the
page to reload could put me past
the deadline," Howald said. "It was
really stressful."
Howald said that even after he
had successfully submitted his
application, he still found that his
revised rankings had not appeared
on his application.
Although his second sign-in
attempt finally revealed the proper
rankings, Howald sent a message to
Housing Assignments to confirm
that the correct application had
been received. He said Housing
Assignments replied saying it
would keep the housing applica
tions open for editing until 11:59
p.m. Monday.
"I do think that the response of
extending the deadline was the

right thing." Howald said.
Nevertheless, Howald said the
Draw comes at a time when stu
dents are making a lot of other deci
sions at the end of the year and
should be changed to ease the
process.
"It's something that is incredibly
stressful because it's a rigid process,"
Howald said. "And they should be
taking every step to ensure the infor
mation is correct and it doesn't take
too long. If they're going to make
mistakes, they need to be more flex
ible with deadlines."
Although the causes of these
glitches are still under investiga
tion, Nunan said the problems seem
to have occurred because of a
heavy volume of transactions
around the time of the deadline.
"Students can verify their own
applications online by clicking on
the 'View Active Applications'
link," Nunan said. "If anyone
believes their final selections are
not accurate, they should first close
their browser window and re-login
to verify again, or they can contact
the Housing Assignments office."
