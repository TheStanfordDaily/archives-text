## Housing apps face Web lock Heavy deadline traffic caused delays, confusion 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Several students reported seeing
incorrect information on their
online housing applications around
the 6 p.m. draw deadline this past
Sunday, finding wrong email
addresses, inaccurate rankings and
mistaken priority assignments on
Axess.
Director of Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan said in an
email to The Daily that students
reported seeing wrong information
during periods of heavy Internet
traffic, as students were editing their
rankings up until the 6 p.m. pub
lished deadline. She said whatever
errors appeared on students'
screens were not present in the edit
ed applications they had successful
ly submitted to Housing
Assignments.
"When students contacted us
over the weekend, we asked them
to review the applications again
themselves and we also looked
them up in our database view,"
Nunan said. "In every case we have
confirmed that the application was
stored with the correct informa
tion."
"When we asked them to log
back in, the correct information
appeared," Nunan added. "This
[problem] was limited to the infor
mation displayed to the students,
and does not reflect what is stored
in our database."
Nunan said that her office had
not encountered problems like this
