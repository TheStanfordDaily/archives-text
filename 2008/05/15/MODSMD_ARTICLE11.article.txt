# STUDENT GROUPS
## Athletics fan group formed FanatAXE offers resources for all Cardinal sports 
### ALAN GUO 
Stanford's athletic department
has been consistently rated one of
the top in the nation — the
University has won 13 consecutive
Directors' Cup titles, an award hon
oring the nation's top overall athletic
program. Yet with the fast pace of
student life. Cardinal fans cannot
always make it to games, particularly
for less recognized sports programs.

In response. Zachary Warma '11
recently founded a new organization,
Cardinal FanatAXE, which seeks to
build broad bases of fan support for
all varsity and club sports.
"FanatAXE will serve as the
school's centralized fan support
organization to make sure that all of
the school's sports team receive the
publicity they have rightly earned."
Warma said in an email to The Daily.
In particular. Warma said that
FanatAXE will focus on "publicity
and [programming] for small, less vis
ible sports."
FanatAXE has been approved by
the ASSU to take chanze of Big

Game Week planning, along with the
AXE Committee. It will also assist
the student body by setting up a com
prehensive Web site that will supply
up-to-date information on all student
athletic teams and groups.
The group will collaborate with
other spirit groups like the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band, Stanford 6th Man and the
AXE Committee to rally student
excitement. Warma also expects the
group to provide bussing services to
students for key games against Cal.
"In general, we just want to pro
vide fun and exciting programming
to really get Cardinal spirit flowing
on this campus," Warma said.
In the future, Warma hopes
FanatAXE will become the huh of
student fan support for athletic pro
grams.
"Unlike 6th Man. [FanatAXE] is
dedicated not to a single sport or
team, but rather to all Stanford ath
letics," he said.
Warma also acknowledged the
importance of the AXE Committee,
but he envisioned FanatAXE to dif
fer from the AXE Committee with
regard to "the more enlarged scope
of the organization's workings."
Warma pointed to school spirit as
his main motivation for getting the
group off the ground.
"I love this school, and I am
someone that believes in the ability
of sports to bring together otherwise

Many students, in particular stu
dent athletes, seem to embrace the
idea of FanatAXE.
"It would be great if other ath
letes and other students came to
smaller events because we do have a
lot of talents" said Lauren Stewart
'09, a heptathlon athlete who cur
rently ranks 12th in the nation.
