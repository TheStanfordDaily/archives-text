## GSC creates publicity sector 
### NATASHA KIM 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
Wednesday night discussed general funding poli
cies and introduced a new GSC publicity sector.
The GSC reviewed general funding policies
for the academic term in order to outline how
student groups can receive funding from the
GSC. The main agenda item that was disputed
among representatives was the policy that there
should be "no funds for off-campus recreational
activities".
GSC Co-chair Polina Segalova explained that
rare exceptions have been made to this rule.
"The one exception that the GSC has made in
the past was for PowderBound whose whole
point is off-campus recreational activities, specif
ically snowboarding," Segalova said. "What I
propose that the GSC discuss is if we should
make more exceptions to this policy."
Representative Aleksandra Korolova felt
that there should be very limited exceptions.
"1 feel that many groups, including
PowerBound, do not advertise or present events
in a way that everybody feels invited," Korolova
said. "And the whole point of the GSC is to serve
the entire graduated student population."
GSC Parliamentarian Adam Beberg, howev
er, cited GSC precedence.
"Historically there have been very few excep
tions to this rule because there is a huge liability
for the GSC for off-campus events," Beberg said.
"Plus, there are also other venues besides the

GSC where student groups can get funding for
off-campus activities."
All representatives agreed that the policy was
an important matter, and resolved to spend
more time addressing it at the next GSC meet
ing.
Plans of the newly formed GSC publicity sec
tor were also presented by representatives Zeng
Fan and lvette Estay.
"We want the graduate population to know
about the GSC, what role it plays in the graduate
experience and advertise about GSC events,"
Estay said. "We plan to educate and be helpful
to the graduates. For example, at sponsored
events we want to give out useful items such as
pens, memory sticks, etc."
Another suggestion included the creation of
GSC Social Hours.
"We basically want to make the GSC repre
sentatives celebrities," Estay said. "We were
thinking that each constituent could host at least
one social hour per year. They would be really
fun. perhaps themed social events with the goal
being that members of the constituent could
come and ask questions, suggest ideas, etc."
Satija supported this suggestion, noting it
would be good publicity for the GSC.
"1 definitely agree that we should have pho
tos showing GSC-sponsored events," said Satija.
"The main thought is that all the GSC does is sit
around and talk — and that's just not true."
