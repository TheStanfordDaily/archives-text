Contributions from Stanford researchers
have helped develop new theories of human
progression which claim the human race came
dangerously close to extinction at one point.
The Stanford study, together with a study
conducted through the National Geographic
Society, IBM. Arizona Research labs and other
organizations, showed that humans came close
to extinction 70,(X)() years ago, with the human
population shrinking as low as 2,(KK) before
numbers began to rise again. Both studies uti
lized studies of mitochondrial DNA to trace
the progression of ancient humans.
