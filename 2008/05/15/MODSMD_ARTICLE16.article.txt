# Positive Sustainability
## Slow down 
### 
If there's one thing I wish Stan
ford had in common with Har
vard. it would have to be their
welcome letter. Included in Har
vard's orientation packet is a seven
page letter from former Dean Harry
Lewis,entitled:"Slow Down: Getting
More Out of Harvard by Doing
Less." In it. freshmen are explicitly
advised to postpone declaring their
major, to choose a profession based
solely for interest, to take a year off,
to keep extracurriculars under con
trol and to be average. I expect that
many students laugh at such a letter,
but 1 hope at least some readers take
it.and today's column, to heart.
Stanford students are obsessed
with speed. At all hours of the day
and night, they whiz by on their
bikes, narrowly avoiding death at the
aptly named intersection thereof. At
the post office, students in line roll
their eyes and tap their toes, aching
to hurry it along. It seems that we all
have somewhere to go, and we want
to get there as fast as we can.
We've even developed a special
name to describe Stanford students'
veiled compulsion to stay on the move
— the Stanford Duck Syndrome —
which forces all afflicted, presumably
the entire student body, to keep afloat
by paddling madly under the surface
while presenting a calm facade to their
peers. Until recently. I believed this
analogy to be inherently valid...until I
actually observed a duck.
Granted, when ducks want to
move, they can paddle their little tail
feathers across the pond in record
time to grab a meal, or to avoid be
coming one. But for most of the day,
they just float there, no mad paddling
required, slowly dabbling around the
pond.The reason ducks look so calm
is because they are — they have
nothing on their minds except eating,
sleeping and tloating. Believe me, if
Stanford students really had Duck
Syndrome, we'd do nothing but chill
on the Oval all day.
As Dean Lewis was well aware,
students at top universities are driven
individuals. We petition to take 21

units when we know that 15 is a nor
mal load. We join as many groups as
possible, and when that's not enough,
we make plans to start our own. We
come to Stanford with a resume as
long as our arm, and we leave with
one as long as our leg. We don't date,
because we're too busy studying.
Consider, however, what would
happen if we all took Lewis' advice
and simply slowed down a bit. Would
the world come crashing down
around us? Would dropping a few ex
tracurriculars to make time for
friends and family compromise your
chances at getting a good job? Would
postponing an Econ problem set
long enough to go on a date with the
could-be love of your life really make
you a failure? Lewis argues, and I
wholeheartedly agree, that the an
swer to all of these questions is a re
sounding "No." Unfortunately, stu
dents far too often put their academ
ic success before those aspects of life
which are, in fact, ultimately more
fulfilling: leisure,love, and happiness.
Slowing down can often provide the
perspective needed to make more
balanced decisions.
Around the world, people are be
ginning to realize that slowing down
is not only the best way to stay sane,
it's also one of the best ways to live
more sustainably. In recent decades,
"Slow Movements" have developed
to slow down almost every activity
imaginable. There is Slow Food,
which promotes sustainable agricul
ture as an alternative to factory
farms and fast food; Slow Cities,
which advocates eco-cities designed
for pedestrians and bikes instead of
cars; and Slow Design, which deeply

considers the impacts of products on
their users and the environment.
Other movements include Slow
Books, Slow Exercise, Slow Schools,
Slow Shopping, Slow Travel, Slow
Thinking and even Slow Sex. "In
Praise of Slowness" (2004) by Carl
Honore is an enjoyable read about
every thing slow.
So whether you're interested in
saving the Earth or just staying sane,
take some time in your busy day to
slow down — your family, your
friends and your future self will
thank you for it.
