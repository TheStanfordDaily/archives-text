How much help
should the
international
community provide
when this happens?
And what do we
do if that help
is refused?

It has been a rough couple of
weeks for natural disasters. In
Chile on May 2. the Chaiten Vol
cano erupted near the city of the
same name, forcing mass evacua
tion: the ash-covered city has since
flooded. In Myanmar. Cyclone Nar
gis hit on the same day, and the Red
Cross estimation of the death toll
now exceeds 60,000. In China on
Monday, one of the most powerful
earthquakes the country has seen in
decades toppled buildings in an
area populated by 15 million peo
ple. and the death toll has reached
15,000 according to government es
timates.
On my Stanford email lists, I've
already seen that students are re
sponding to try and help those afflict
ed. But on a broader note, how much
help should the international com
munity provide when stuff like this
happens? What do we do if, as is the
case with the Myanmar cyclone, that
help is refused?
Chile has been able to manage the
evacuation and displacement itself
— which is not surprising, consider
ing the smaller scale of the problem.
China scaled up a massive rescue ef
fort. including over 50,000 soldiers,
and has been happy to accept inter
national contributions to help those
affected, even though it declined for
eign aid workers.
Myanmar s government, in the
meantime, has told everyone — aid
organizations, other countries and
essentially its own citizens — to piss
off. The repressive and paranoid
junta that rules the country is likely
culpable for much of the destruction,
given its failure to warn its own citi
zens of the impending disaster so
they could take shelter before the cy
clone struck. Maybe they didn't even
know themselves. But even worse,
with palpable fear of losing political
power in the chaos, the junta has said
no to almost any international help
for the thousands of victims of the
disaster.
It's worth mentioning as a side

note that the United States and
Britain still officially refer to Myan
mar as Burma, its historic name that
was only changed a few years ago
under the junta's leadership. Acced
ing to the name change has been con
sidered a symbolic nod to the ruling
party, since so many countries still
use the old name.
This week, after much pleading,
the decision was finally made to
allow four relief planes to land in
Myanmar (which led to the embar
rassing and tragic discovery that the
regime didn't even have the equip
ment to unload them), and a few in
ternational experts have been al
lowed in to analyze the extent of the
damage. But most relief organiza

tions predict that the lack of access
to food, water and basic healthcare
could cause the death toll to triple
— something that can only be avert
ed with a full and unencumbered re
lief effort like the one in the wake of
the December 2004 tsunami in In
donesia.
So the question then is: what do
you do when someone tells you they
don't want your help? Despite the
minimal concessions, the leader of
Myanmar's junta has still refused to
take all phone calls from Ban Ki-
Moon, the Secretary General of the
U.N.
Fueled by Bernard Kouchner,
France's Foreign Minister, much dis
cussion has followed over whether
military' force should be used to force
Myanmar's government to let emer
gency aid get to those who need it
most. Kouchner and many others
argue that the U.N. does have a "re
sponsibility to protect." Further
more, in his book "The Bottom Bil
lion," Oxford economist Paul Collier
finds well-performed military inter
ventions to be incredibly cost-effec
tive in preventing further humanitar
ian losses.
In an op-ed in yesterday's New
York Times, analyst Robert Kaplan
points out that the United States
does have forces nearby in Thailand.
And the people of Myanmar certain
ly deserve help. But for us, now, an
other military adventure just seems
like a bad idea. Whether by working
with China or through the U.N.,
something needs to happen in Myan
mar, and as the last two weeks have
shown, there are plenty of people
who are willing to give money to
help.
After the 2004 tsunami, the out
pouring of help from the internation
al community was inspiring. Today,
help is available; someone just needs
to convince the rulers to take it.

too? Tell Michael at wilkerson@stan
