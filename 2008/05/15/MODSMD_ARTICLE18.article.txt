Thanks, Vice Provost Boardman
To the editor.
I've learned a lot this spring quarter, but I
want to share what I learned about the coolest
man on campus — Vice Provost Greg Board
man.
To make a long story short. I'll just say that
some of my friends and I had an awesome sail
boat on Lake Lag. which, for all you east-siders
who never venture so far. is currently a lake.
The boat suddenly and mysteriously disap
peared about nine weeks ago,and I immediate
ly launched an investigation. After wrongfully
accusing the organizers of Chi Overboard, I
eventually found out that the real culprit had
been — surprise! — the University. Upon this
discovery, I marched straight home and
emailed — who else? — President Hennessy.
If anyone knew what had happened to my
boat, he would.
"Dear President Hennessy," I wrote, "I be
lieve you owe me a boat."
My friends laughed when I told them what I
had done. "You'll never hear back from him."
they told me. "The University hates fun. They
don't care about your sailboat.They don't even

care about you." This seemed to be the over
whelming consensus, and it made me very sad.
The next day before lunch I received an
email. It was a note from President Hennessy's
assistant, Jeff Wachtel. "Dear Eva," it said,
"President Hennessy has asked me to look into
this." He referred me to about five different
people, each of whom I could contact to try to
get the boat back.
And, fortunately, one of those people was
Vice Provost Boardman. He agreed to meet
with me right away, and I showed up promptly
in his office. He was friendly, supportive and
had already put an amazing amount of effort
into researching the past and present boating
policies at Stanford — he even went so far as to
find out which state laws I should be aware of,
so the boat could not later be taken away on
legal grounds. He assured me that he and his
colleagues in the administration make every
possible effort not to kill fun, and that, actually,
they want us to enjoy ourselves here at Stan
ford. He told me he was very disappointed in
the Stanford police for removing the boat with
out making any effort to contact the owner, and
together we talked about ways to prevent this
from happening in the future. Before I even left
his office, he called the police to authorize the

release of my boat. I could expect a call from
them, he told me, later that day, to arrange a
time when they could drop the boat back off at
the lake.
I'd been told that the University hates fun.
And maybe it does. But Greg Boardman cer
tainly doesn't. I left feeling like he really truly
cared about me — me and that stupid little
boat.
The University stole my boat, but Greg
Boardman stole my heart.

Stanford should not accept
Penner donation
To the editor:
Stanford recently received a donation of $4
million from the Walton Family Foundation, an
organization funded by the family of Wal-Mart
founder Sam Walton. The family is worth over
$76 billion, making them one of the richest fam
ilies in the world. Almost all of their worth is a
result of their holdings in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
The recent donation was made at the behest

of two Walton family members in particular:
Carrie Walton Penner, Sam Walton's grand
daughter, and her husband Greg Penner. Both
are Stanford alumni and sit on the University's
Leadership Council. Greg is about to be elect
ed to the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, Carrie
is the trustee of the Walton Foundation; they
are both deeply involved with the company.
Wal-Mart's ethically bankrupt business
practices are the source of the recent donation
Stanford received. The company relies on low
wages, poor health care, sweatshop-like factory
production and taxpayer subsidies for its prof
its. No morally responsible university should
accept money made this way.
Wal-Mart may be helping out Stanford, but
the company is damaging the U.S. economy
and communities across America. Tell the ad
ministration to either demand changes from
the company or return this donation. Greg
Penner is quickly gaining power at Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. and must be held responsible for
the company's actions. Stanford students
should demand better of the school's alumni
and of the world's largest retailer.
