## Emergency alert system tested on students 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Wednesday at 4:45 p.m., phones rang
and email programs beeped all over cam
pus as Stanford officials tested the
University's emergency mass alert system.
"This is a test of the Stanford
University AlertSU Emergency Alert sys
tem ... in a real emergency, you would

receive specific information about the
nature and location of the emergency and
brief instructions," said the message.
Earlier this quarter, students were
prompted to update their contact infor
mation on Axess. Yesterday afternoon,
students were contacted simultaneously
via email, text message and phone.
Students who answered their phones
heard a prerecorded message describing

the purpose of the test. Voicemails were
left for students who missed the call.
Keith Perry. Stanford's Environmental
Health and Safety Training and
Communications manager, explained that
a test of Stanford's notification system was
prompted by campus emergencies at
other universities, including last spring's
shootings at Virginia Tech, where a stu
dent shot and killed 32 people before

turning a gun on himself.
Perry said that
Stanford's previous notifi-

cation system only sent emails and left
voicemails.
"That was a pull method," he said.

explaining that it required sti
dents to actively read their

emails or check their voice mailbox.
The new system, by contrast, also
leaves text messages and a live voice
message if students pick up their
phones. Perry called the new system a
"push method" because it only
required that students be near their
phones.
Yesterday's campus-wide test fol
lowed a smaller test directed specifi
cally at Stanford staff that was con
ducted last Tuesday
"The overall success was very
good,'' Perry said. "We reached 92
percent of the staff through at least
one contact method."
Perry said the goal was to notify a
critical mass of people in the event of
an emergency.
"As long as we reach a certain per
centage, we can ensure that the local
procedures take over," he said.
Student reactions to the test were
generally positive.

"I think it's a good system," said
Joel Wright '09. "I remember that
after the Virginia Tech shooting, the
school ran an independent investiga
tion and found their communication
wasn't very effective."
Amanda Christian '08 said she
was expecting the AlertSU message
today, since she got three emails this
week telling her about the upcoming
test.
"I got my voicemail in class," she
said. "The professor's phone rang. 1
don't know if that was his emergency
notification or not."
Christian said she thought the
system would probably be effective
in the event of an emergency.
"I'm glad Stanford finally got it
together," she said.
Perry said that the results of the
AlertSU test will be available by
Thursday, and will be analyzed.
Students are encouraged to report
any problems they had receiving
alert messages to Stanford safety offi
cials.
