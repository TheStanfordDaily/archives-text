# Teammates, Roommates

### BY DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mirrielees is like most upper
class residence halls on
campus: if you wander the
halls you will find a mot
ley crew of different social

niches. Football players living across the hall
from a cappella singers and engineers next
door to ballet dancers. In one corner of the
third floor, however, you will find room 320. a
room occupied by three Stanford softball
players: Maddy Coon, Alissa Haber and
Rosey Neill.
Aside from the five Stanford softball
posters on the wall, the room could be that of
anyone else in the four-story complex. 'ITiere

are dirty dishes in the sink, a half-empty re
frigerator and clothes strewn all over the
floor.
This room is different, however. It's not a
coincidence that three of Stanford's best play
ers — the entire trio were named First Team
All-Pacific Region — all live together. Each
one has her own role, and together the three
are able to enjoy the excitement of starting
the season a school record 15-0. And together

they have overcome the hardship of losing the
first five games of the Pac-10 season.
Neill. a sophomore catcher who is enjoying
a breakout season at the plate, is the cook of
the bunch, and also the one who makes sure
that everyone does what they need to get
done.
To say she is the leader of the group would
be a stretch, however, with junior shortstop
Maddy Coon in the same room. Coon is not
only the field general on the diamond, but she
has lived like this before and understands
how it works. As a sophomore she lived with
Softball players, and she is able to show Haber
and Neill how to balance school with softball
and a social life.

"There are more important
things in this world than a
clean room,"Neill added.
"Like winning a
championship,"
said Coon.

The decision to live together was made last
year on a random evening when Coon and
Haber decided it made sense for them to be
roommates. Not long after, Neill joined the
crew and it was set.
Although the girls may not always realize
it.it could not have turned out better. They all
make sacrifices — I labergave up her claim to
the single bedroom in Spring Quarter to give
it to Rosey, while Maddy offered to take the
top bunk because she sometimes enjoys the
seclusion it provides her.
By living with one another they are also
able to enjoy each other outside the context
of softball, and live a somewhat normal Stan
ford life when they are not on road trips.
"The room is good to provide us with any
thing that doesn't involve softball," Coon ex
plained.
It is for that reason that at any given time
you could find neighbors from across the hall
sitting on the futon with the girls watching
"America's Next Top Model" or "Family
Guy."
"It's impossible to get work done in here,"
said Neill, sounding a lot like any other Stan
ford student would.
These girls are not any other Stanford stu
dents, however. All three have flourished
since moving in with one another.
Coon is enjoying her best season since
coming to Stanford, batting .281 with eight
homeruns and 38 RBIs. She is also second on
the team in on-base percentage, trailing only
Haber, with a .456 mark.
Haber was an ail-American last year as a
freshman playing centerfield, but she is hav
ing an even better season this year. Haber
leads the team hitting .380 with six homeruns
and a team-high 44 runs scored.
Neill is having a monstrous year for the
Cardinal hitting in the cleanup spot. After an
inconsistent freshman year, she is batting .348
as a sophomore with a team-leading 18 home
runs and 4 l ) RBIs.
Despite the accomplishments of its three
tenants, Haber insists that the room is perfect
ly normal.
" ITiis is a typical room; I wouldn't say any
of us are clean or anything," she said.
"But there are more important things in
this world than a clean room," Neill added.
"Like winning a championship," Coon fin
ished.
They all have that goal in mind, and they
will take it with them to Amherst, Mass. for
Regionals and the beginning of the NCAA
tournament this weekend.
