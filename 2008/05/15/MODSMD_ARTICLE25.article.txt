## Edwards endorses Obama for nominee 
### CHUCK BABINGTON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GRAND RAPIDS. Mich. (AP)â€”
Democrat John Edwards endorsed
former rival Barack Obama on
Wednesday, a move designed to help
solidify support for the party's likely
presidential nominee even as Hillary
Rodham Clinton refuses to give up
her long-shot candidacy.
The surprise endorsement came a
day after Clinton defeated Obama by
more than 2-to-l in the West Virginia
primary, and it helped the Obama
campaign steer much of the evening
news coverage away from a painful
subject. The West Virginia outcome
highlighted Obama's challenge in
winning over "Hillary Democrats" -
white, working-class voters who also
supported Edwards in significant
numbers before he exited the race in
late January.
Edwards made the carefully
timed announcement at an Obama
rally here, as the Illinois senator cam
paigned in a critical general election
battleground state.
Edwards, who received a thunder
ous ovation when Obama introduced
him to the crowd of several thou
sand. said, "brothers and sisters, we
must come together as Democrats"
to defeat McCain. "We are here
tonight because the Democratic vot
ers have made their choice, and so
have I."
He said Obama "stands with me"
in a fight to cut poverty in half within
(0 years, a claim Obama confirmed
moments later.
Edwards also praised Clinton,
saying "we are a stronger party"
because of her involvement, and
"we're going to have a stronger nom
inee in the fall because of her work."
He said Clinton is a "woman who
is made of steel. She is a leader in this
country not because of her husband
but because of what she has done."
Speaking after Edwards in the
packed Van Andel Arena, Obama
gave one of his most animated
addresses in days, much of it devoted
to his guest's favorite topic, fighting
poverty. In America, he said, "you
should never be homeless, you
should never be hungry."
As president, he vowed to "lift up
every American out of poverty."
Clinton campaign chairman Terry
McAuliffe said in a statement. "We
respect John Edwards, but as the vot
ers of West Virginia showed last
night, this thing is far from oveh"

Edwards, a former North Carolina
senator and the 2004 vice presiden
tial nominee, finished second to
Obama in the lowa caucus in early
January before coming in third in the
following three contests. I le dropped
out in New Orleans, the location a
reminder of his attention to poverty.
Both Obama and Clinton imme
diately asked Edwards for his
endorsement, but he stayed mum for
more than four months. His endorse
ment would have carried far more
clout if he had made it in February,
when the Obama-Clinton outcome
was very much in doubt.
Obama, speaking to reporters on
his plane late Wednesday Jis he Hew
from Michigan to Chicago, said
Edwards can help draw working
class voters and others to his cam
paign.
"I have no doubt that John
Edwards can be extremely helpful to
us campaigning in every demograph
ic. But his passion and credibility
when it comes to issues of poverty
and the plight of working people in
this country, I think, is a message that
is powerful and one that fits with the
kind of vision I have for America."
A person close to Edwards, speak
ing on condition of anonymity, said
he wanted to get involved now to
begin unifying the party. The two
men spoke by phone Iliesday night,
and Edwards agreed to fly to Grand
Rapids the next day.
Edwards didn't even tell many of
his former top advisers because he
wanted to inform Clinton personally,
said the person close to him.
Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, who has
said she thinks Clinton has the supe
rior health care plan, did not travel
with him to Michigan and is not part
of the endorsement.
David "Mudcat" Saunders, a chief
adviser for Edwards on rural affairs
during the presidential campaign,
said the endorsement should take
some sting out of Obama's resound
ing loss in West Virginia.
"For Barack Obama, I think he
ought to kiss Johnny Edwards on the
lips to kill this 41-point loss."
Saunders said.
Edwards waged a scrappy under
dog campaign for the Democratic
nomination, always outshone by the
historic nature of Obama possibly
being the first black nominee and
Clinton the first woman. I le contin
ued to campaign after the family dis
closed that his wife's breast cancer
had returned.
