## Death count rises in Myanmar 
### EDITH LEDERER AND JOHN HELPRIN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
YANGON. Myanmar (AP) —The
Red Cross estimated Wednesday that the
cyclone death toll in Myanmar could be
as high as 128.000 — a much larger figure
than the government tally. The U.N.
warned a second wave of deaths will fol
low unless the military regime lets in
more aid quickly.
The grim forecast came as heavy rains
drenched the devastated Irrawaddy
River delta, disrupting aid operations
already struggling to reach up to 2.5 mil
lion people in urgent need of food, water
and shelter.
"Another couple of days exposed to
those conditions can only lead to wors
ening health conditions and compound
the stress people are living in," said
Shantha Bloemen, a spokeswoman for
UNICEF.
A tropical depression in the Bay of
Bengal added new worries, but late in the
day forecasters said it was weakening and
unlikely to grow into a cyclone.
Myanmar's government issued a
revised casualty toll Wednesday night,
saying 38.491 were known dead and
27,838 were missing.
I"he International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies, how
ever. snid its estimate put the number of
dead between 68.833 and 127.990. The
Geneva-based body said the range came
from a compilation based on other esti
mates from 22 different organizations,
including the Myanmar Red Cross
Society, and on media reports.
Even though the figures seemed pre
cise. spokesman Matthew Cochrane said
they were not based on body counts, but
were only rough estimates designed to
provide Red Cross donors and partner
organizations with an idea of the num
bers being discussed within the aid com
munity.
U.N. officials have said there could be
more than 100,000 dead.
The Red Cross estimated the number
of people needing help after cyclone
surged over the low-lying delta on May 3
at between 1.64 million and 2.51 million.
But the junta still refused to accept
help from foreign aid experts, who have
vast experience in handling humanitarian
crises.
It insisted Myanmar can handle the

disaster on its own - a stance that
appeared to stem not from the isolation
ist regime's ability but from its deep sus
picion of most foreigners, who have fre
quently criticized its human rights abuses
and crackdowns on democracy activists.
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-nioon said he secured support
from Myanmar to increase the flow of
relief aid.
"In view of the magnitude of this cri
sis, much more needs to be done," Ban
told reporters after a nearly two-hour
meeting in New York with Myanmar, its
neighbors and key donors. The
"Myanmese ambassador has assured that
the Myanmese government will do all to
assist."
Ban also said that during the meeting
aimed at boosting aid to the stricken
nation he was also able to win backing
from the groups for a high-level confer
ence to raise funds for disaster aid this
month.
Myanmar's prime minister, Lt. Gen.
Thein Sein, told visiting Thai Prime
Minister Samak Sundaravej on
Wednesday that the government was in
control of the situation and didn't need
foreign experts.
"They have their own team to cope
with the situation," Samak said after
returning to Bangkok. He said the junta
gave him a "guarantee" that there was no
starvation or disease outbreaks among
survivors.
But critics say the government is woe
fully lacking in helicopters, trucks and
boats as well as planning expertise need
ed to distribute aid to survivors, who have
jammed into monasteries and relief cen
ters or are camping outside.
U.N. agencies and other voluntary
groups have been able to reach only
270,000 of the affected people, said
Elisabeth Byrs of r the U.N. Office for
Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva.
She said the World Food Program
would need 55.000 tons of rice to feed
750,000 people for three months, but the
agency had been able to ship in only 361
tons so far.
On Thursday, aid agencies were
preparing or moving in a wide-range of
relief supplies including material for tem
porary shelters, rice, drinking water,
kitchen utensils and medicines including
2.000 anti-snake bite kits. The U.N. World
Health Organization says an increase in
snake bites is feared in coming days.

The junta did grant approval
Wednesday for a Thai medical team to
visit the delta, said Dr. Thawat
Sutharacha of Thailand's Public Health
Ministry. If the team goes as scheduled
Friday, it will be the first foreign aid
group to work in the ravaged delta.
Myanmar has limited the few interna
tional aid workers in the country to
Yangon, the country's biggest city, and
used police to keep foreigners from going
to the delta.
The U.N. has also expressed concern
this week that some of the food and aid
donated by international groups isn't
making it to the most needy, but is being
diverted by officials or the military. And
some aid workers and survivors said that
in many cases spoiled or poor-quality
food was being given to survivors.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the American
ambassador to the U.N. has said the U.S.
is concerned about the issue and wants to
make sure thSt that aid goes to the people
that are intended to be the recipients.
The government gave a little ground
to demands that it let in more experts. It
announced it would allow in 160 relief
workers from neighboring countries -
India, China, Bangladesh and Thailand.
Except for the Thais, it was not clear
whether they would be permitted to go to
the delta.Hie U.N. also said that an emer
gency rapid assessment team from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
was being assembled for movement into
Myanmar within the next 24 hours.
In New York, U.N. humanitarian chief
John Holmes welcomed the junta's move
to let in the Asian relief workers. But he
said it was not enough and demanded
that Myanmar open its borders to foreign
relief specialists and let outsiders work in
the Irravvaddy delta.
"The relief getting through under the
kind of restrictions we're operating under
is by no means adequate to the task, and
it's hard to see how just continuing with
the status quo can ever be sufficient in
the current critical time period that we're
working in," Holmes said.
While it has kept out all but a few for
eign aid workers, the regime has accepted
tons of provisions sent by international
donors, including the United Nations and
the United States.
Five U.S. C-130 military transport
planes delivered drinking water, blankets,
mosquito nets and plastic sheets
Wednesday.
