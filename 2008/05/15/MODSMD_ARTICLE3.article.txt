oMV Stanford baseball is looking to
Wnxp mW regain some of the momentum
that carried it through much of
the season, to as high as No. 3 in the nation at the
team's peak. To be sure, it has not been easy, as the
Cardinal is 5-6 over its last 11 games and 2-3 in its last
five.
With just six games remaining in the regular season
— all against Pac-10 foes — Stanford looks to contin
ue a recent surge that has seen it win its past two
games by a combined 14 runs.
Helping the Cardinal (30-18-2, 11-7 Pac-10) stay
afloat and even bounce back of late has been junior

Brent Miileville,
whose red hot
bat has been a
key component
to the Cardinal's
offense, especial
ly in the past
week of play.
Miileville is bat
ting .471 over
the past five
games while
notching a slug
ging percentage
of 1.059 over
that span. The
first baseman
and catcher has

"Hitting a baseball is
hard, and when you try
and do too much you
just make it a lot harder"

— BRENT MILLEVILLE

racked up three homeruns in his past four games and
accounted for eight RBIs in the past five.
How has he done it? Even Milleville himself didn't
sound too sure.
"I don't know,"he said when asked about his
recent offensive surge. "I've just been reverting back
to a swing I used to have in high school and just stay
ing relaxed. I'm not thinking too much or trying too
hard. Hitting a baseball is hard, and when you try and
do too much you just make it a lot harder."
The Wichita, Kan. native's season stats have clear
ly spiked to the point where there can be no doubt of
how much he means to the Stanford offense. His sea
son slugging percentage of .630 is second on
Stanford's roster, behind only junior center fielder
Sean Ratliffs mark of .637. But Milleville not only
brings power to the plate, but also discipline and a
knack for getting on base as well. His .419 OBP is
good for third on the squad, while his .353 batting
average also ranks third among frequent starters.
