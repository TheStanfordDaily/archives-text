oMV Stanford baseball is looking to
Wnxp mW regain some of the momentum
that carried it through much of
the season, to as high as No. 3 in the nation at the
team's peak. To be sure, it has not been easy, as the
Cardinal is 5-6 over its last 11 games and 2-3 in its last
five.
With just six games remaining in the regular season
— all against Pac-10 foes — Stanford looks to contin
ue a recent surge that has seen it win its past two
games by a combined 14 runs.
Helping the Cardinal (30-18-2, 11-7 Pac-10) stay
afloat and even bounce back of late has been junior

Brent Miileville,
whose red hot
bat has been a
key component
to the Cardinal's
offense, especial
ly in the past
week of play.
Miileville is bat
ting .471 over
the past five
games while
notching a slug
ging percentage
of 1.059 over
that span. The
first baseman
and catcher has

"Hitting a baseball is
hard, and when you try
and do too much you
just make it a lot harder"

— BRENT MILLEVILLE

racked up three homeruns in his past four games and
accounted for eight RBIs in the past five.
How has he done it? Even Milleville himself didn't
sound too sure.
"I don't know,"he said when asked about his
recent offensive surge. "I've just been reverting back
to a swing I used to have in high school and just stay
ing relaxed. I'm not thinking too much or trying too
hard. Hitting a baseball is hard, and when you try and
do too much you just make it a lot harder."
The Wichita, Kan. native's season stats have clear
ly spiked to the point where there can be no doubt of
how much he means to the Stanford offense. His sea
son slugging percentage of .630 is second on
Stanford's roster, behind only junior center fielder
Sean Ratliffs mark of .637. But Milleville not only
brings power to the plate, but also discipline and a
knack for getting on base as well. His .419 OBP is
good for third on the squad, while his .353 batting
average also ranks third among frequent starters.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
But perhaps the scariest thing
about Milleville from the perspec
tive of Cardinal opponents has been
his ability to come through with the
game on the line. Most recently,
Milleville's grand slam in Sunday's
series finale against Cal proved to be
the edge Stanford needed, as the
team got an 8-5 win and staved off a
Bears sweep. Though that particular
shot came in the fifth inning,
Milleville has been just as dangerous
in the eighth and ninth.
"I've kind of been lucky and just
gotten the opportunity to be up there
late in the game," he said. "You try
not to approach it in a way different
from any normal at bat and I've been
lucky, got some lucky hits and things
worked out in the late innings."
Also of note for Stanford opponents
is that despite playing a key role on
an offense that has scored nearly 7.5
runs per game, Milleville believes

that there is still room for improve
ment in the Stanford lineup.
"Our offense, we have our ups
and our downs," Milleville said.
"We've had some games where
we've shown what we can really do.
Santa Clara [a game the Cardinal
won 15-4] was a good example of that
on Monday. And I really think that if
we get hot these last two series then
we've got a real good chance of mak
ing a run to the postseason. I'm just
looking for our offense to show a lit
tle more consistency for the rest of
the year.
"A big thing [to improve down the
stretch] is just being consistent," he
went on. "We've slacked off in mid
week games and played well usually
on the weekends. Everyone's pretty
happy with how we have played on
the weekends, and I think these next
few series we're playing a couple of
good teams. And I think that we just

need to approach it like this could be
our last game and give it everything
we have and just go out and play."
As for how much improvement
Stanford has shown a year after a dis
appointing .500 finish, Milleville sin
gled out the leadership that has been
provided by the team's upperclass
men.
"This year we have a lot of juniors
and seniors, a lot of experience, and
[that] really helps out a lot," he said.
"You look at our lineup and we do
have some freshmen in there and
they're doing well, but I really think
it's the juniors and seniors that have
just [provided] the team leadership
that has definitely improved from
the first two years I've been here."
In the awkward transition from
college to the professional minor
leagues, for juniors like Milleville
who are eligible for the draft but de
pending on how high or where they

are selected, may also opt to return
for their senior seasons — it can be
difficult to sum up a collegiate career
that may or may not he in its final
stretch. But Milleville seemed con
tent with the uncertainty in his near
future as the MLB First-Year Player
Draft rolls around on June 5.
"I really don't know how the draft
is going to work out — you never re
ally know until the day you do get
drafted." Milleville said."l think that
coming to Stanford you get the kind
of experience that really nobody else
gets playing at a top level in baseball
and going to such a great school.
"If this is my last year then I've
loved it. I've loved every minute of it.
But I'm not looking too far ahead
and just waiting to see how every
thing pans out."

— BRENT MILLEVILLE

racked up three homeruns in his past four games and
accounted for eight RBIs in the past five.
How has he done it? Even Milleville himself didn't
sound too sure.
"I don't know,"he said when asked about his
recent offensive surge. "I've just been reverting back
to a swing I used to have in high school and just stay
ing relaxed. I'm not thinking too much or trying too
hard. Hitting a baseball is hard, and when you try and
do too much you just make it a lot harder."
The Wichita, Kan. native's season stats have clear
ly spiked to the point where there can be no doubt of
how much he means to the Stanford offense. His sea
son slugging percentage of .630 is second on
Stanford's roster, behind only junior center fielder
Sean Ratliffs mark of .637. But Milleville not only
brings power to the plate, but also discipline and a
knack for getting on base as well. His .419 OBP is
good for third on the squad, while his .353 batting
average also ranks third among frequent starters.

But perhaps the scariest thing
about Milleville from the perspec
tive of Cardinal opponents has been
his ability to come through with the
game on the line. Most recently,
Milleville's grand slam in Sunday's
series finale against Cal proved to be
the edge Stanford needed, as the
team got an 8-5 win and staved off a
Bears sweep. Though that particular
shot came in the fifth inning,
Milleville has been just as dangerous
in the eighth and ninth.
"I've kind of been lucky and just
gotten the opportunity to be up there
late in the game," he said. "You try
not to approach it in a way different
from any normal at bat and I've been
lucky, got some lucky hits and things
worked out in the late innings."
Also of note for Stanford opponents
is that despite playing a key role on
an offense that has scored nearly 7.5
runs per game, Milleville believes

that there is still room for improve
ment in the Stanford lineup.
"Our offense, we have our ups
and our downs," Milleville said.
"We've had some games where
we've shown what we can really do.
Santa Clara [a game the Cardinal
won 15-4] was a good example of that
on Monday. And I really think that if
we get hot these last two series then
we've got a real good chance of mak
ing a run to the postseason. I'm just
looking for our offense to show a lit
tle more consistency for the rest of
the year.
"A big thing [to improve down the
stretch] is just being consistent," he
went on. "We've slacked off in mid
week games and played well usually
on the weekends. Everyone's pretty
happy with how we have played on
the weekends, and I think these next
few series we're playing a couple of
good teams. And I think that we just

need to approach it like this could be
our last game and give it everything
we have and just go out and play."
As for how much improvement
Stanford has shown a year after a dis
appointing .500 finish, Milleville sin
gled out the leadership that has been
provided by the team's upperclass
men.
"This year we have a lot of juniors
and seniors, a lot of experience, and
[that] really helps out a lot," he said.
"You look at our lineup and we do
have some freshmen in there and
they're doing well, but I really think
it's the juniors and seniors that have
just [provided] the team leadership
that has definitely improved from
the first two years I've been here."
In the awkward transition from
college to the professional minor
leagues, for juniors like Milleville
who are eligible for the draft but de
pending on how high or where they

are selected, may also opt to return
for their senior seasons — it can be
difficult to sum up a collegiate career
that may or may not he in its final
stretch. But Milleville seemed con
tent with the uncertainty in his near
future as the MLB First-Year Player
Draft rolls around on June 5.
"I really don't know how the draft
is going to work out — you never re
ally know until the day you do get
drafted." Milleville said."l think that
coming to Stanford you get the kind
of experience that really nobody else
gets playing at a top level in baseball
and going to such a great school.
"If this is my last year then I've
loved it. I've loved every minute of it.
But I'm not looking too far ahead
and just waiting to see how every
thing pans out."
