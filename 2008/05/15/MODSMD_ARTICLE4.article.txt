# Class of 2012 has highest yield rate ever
## 72 percent of profros accept admission 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
1,727 students have accepted
Stanford's offer of admission to the Class
of 2012, placing the yield rate for this
admission cycle at a University record
high of 72 percent, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission told ITie
Daily yesterday, lliese numbers are like
ly to change, however, because many of
Stanford's peer institutions have recently
announced they will be accepting wait
listed applicants.
"72 percent is, in fact, a Stanford
record," said Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott in an email to Ibe Daily.
"But again, that figure might be prema

ture, as we may lose students to other uni
versities who go to their waitlists."
Last year the University's yield rate
stood at approximately 70.8 percent,
while the previous year's rate hovered
around 69 percent.
In an admission cycle that saw both a
record-high 25,298 admission offers and a
record-low 9.5 percent acceptance rate,
Abbott noted that a high yield is not nec
essarily a plus.
"Unfortunately, our record yield had
at least one negative consequence," he

said. "It necessitated that we reduce the
number of admission offers to transfer
students from 40 to 20."
In addition to the cut in admitted
transfers, the Office of Admission also
has to handle potential over-enrollment
- a problem that surfaced during the last
admission cycle when 1,745 students
enrolled in the Class of 2011.
Dean of Admission Richard Shaw
told The Daily in a March email that his
office had been cautious to avoid
over-enrollment, although Abbott
confirmed that the problem is now a
real possibility.
"Clearly, we needed to be very
aware [that] we could not have
another year where our incoming
class is too large," Shaw said in
March. "We would rather be slightly
short of enrollment target and go to
waitlist than be over."
But Abbott told The Daily yester
day that the target class size is 1,670
â€” almost 60 less than the 1,727 who
are now prospective freshmen.
"We are hoping to enroll as close
to 1,670 freshmen as possible," he
said.
Abbott said approximately six
percent of applicants were originally

waitlisted in March, and just over 100
remain on the list now. As of yester
day, however, the towering yield is
preventing the admission office from
accepting any waitlisted applicants,
although Abbott emphasized that the
decision remains open until students
who accepted Stanford's offer but
remain waitlisted at other schools
make their final decisions.
"[lt is still] too early to tell
whether or not we will be able to
admit anyone from the waitlist,"
Abbott said.
"We only admit students from the
waitlist if there is space available at
Stanford," he added. "Since there is
[currently] no space available, it sim
ply isn't possible to admit anyone
from the waitlist [as of now]."
Most of Stanford's peer institu
tions, on the other hand, have recent
ly announced that they will be
accepting waitlisted applicants.
Harvard, with a 7.1 percent
acceptance rate and a projected 76
percent yield, announced that it will
offer admission to more than 200
waitlisted students, while Yale, which
had an 8.3 percent admit rate and
approximately 69 percent yield,
made an initial round of 45 admis
sion offers to waitlisted applicants
last week. Princeton also offered
admission to 86 waitlisted students
last week, and MIT said it expects to
send offers to approximately 35 stu
dents.
