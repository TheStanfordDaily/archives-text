## Animal research bill offers shield Proposed bill would protect identities of researchers 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
California State Assemblyman
Gene Mullin (D-South San
Francisco) has recently proposed a
bill that would make posting the
names of academics who conduct
animal research online illegal.
Biology Prof. Russell Fernald
said that the bill would help ensure
personal safety for animal
researchers from animal activist
groups.
"I think we're up against opera
tions and people whose passions
about these issues transcend their
own sense of fairness," he said.
"We're not dealing with people who
are rational and reasonable. If I
could trust these activist groups to
look carefully at what I'm doing, 1
wouldn't be opposed to them.
"But like other researchers, I
would not want them to threaten my
family, which they've done when
they found out the names of other
scientists," he continued. "For them,
it's not about the issue, it's about tor
menting the researchers. People are
made targets. They're made to drop
their research work; anything we
can do to reduce threats can be
good."
While the bill is being considered
in the State Assembly, a recent poll
by People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals (PETA) has labeled
Stanford University as one of the
worst institutions in the nation with
regard to treatment of laboratory
animals. The poll specifically con
demned the labs of Psychiatry and
Behavior Sciences Prof. Alan
Schatzberg and Developmental
Biology Post Doctoral Scholar
David Lyons.
Schatzberg and Lyons have pub
lished numerous papers that study
the behavioral effects off stress inoc
ulation in primates. Both
researchers declined to comment on
PETA's accusations.
"We really stress that when a
juvenile monkey is exposed to this
level of stress, it's not just for the
duration of the protocol," said
PETA laboratory oversight special
ist Alka Chandna. "They'll have a
lifetime of problems — they'll never
be properly socialized, they'll have a
higher likelihood of self mutilation
and they'll exhibit what we call
stereotypic behaviors such as rock
ing back and forth or circling madly
in their cages."
Fernald said that there are
already sufficient regulation appa
ratuses in place to ensure the
humane treatment of animals.
"We as biologists are really care
fully regulated by government, state

and local agencies to ensure that
everything we do with animals is as
careful and as pain-free as possible,"
he said.
"We're regulated by four agen
cies that come and inspect protocol,"
he continued. "We have all kinds of
training, and we're very careful
about what we do. There should be
no concern with whether what we
are doing is reasonable and safe and
careful. There are people on the reg
ulatory committees who are from
the local areas. They're reflecting
community values. It's reasonable to
protect medical scientists from intru
sion because we are regulated in a
way that adequately protects the
animals we're working with."
Fernald added that, ultimately,
animal research is necessary to
ensure the health and safety of
human life. He said that many of the
drugs and ointments people use are

nyt tested on animals, which could
lead to severe and unexpected phys
iological responses in people who
use these products.
"Without animal models you
could never test [such situations),in
a real life model," he said. "I would
contend that we shouldn't do any
thing without testing it thoroughly,
and 1 think we're doing too little.
With the lax regulatory regime
we're in now. we run the risk of real
physiological damage because we
don't know what we are doing to
our bodies."
"We have to recognize we share
an evolutionary history and physio
logical response with many ani
mals." he added. "Why is animal
testing needed? Because we are ani
mals."
