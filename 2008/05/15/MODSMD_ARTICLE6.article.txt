## Animal research bill offers shield Proposed bill would protect identities of researchers 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
California State Assemblyman
Gene Mullin (D-South San
Francisco) has recently proposed a
bill that would make posting the
names of academics who conduct
animal research online illegal.
Biology Prof. Russell Fernald

own sense of fairness," he said.
"We're not dealing with people who

they found out the names of other
scientists," he continued. "For them,
it's not about the issue, it's about tor
menting the researchers. People are
made targets. They're made to drop
their research work; anything we
can do to reduce threats can be
good."
While the bill is being considered
in the State Assembly, a recent poll
by People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals (PETA) has labeled
Stanford University as one of the
worst institutions in the nation with
regard to treatment of laboratory
animals. The poll specifically con
demned the labs of Psychiatry and
Behavior Sciences Prof. Alan
Schatzberg and Developmental
Biology Post Doctoral Scholar
David Lyons.
Schatzberg and Lyons have pub
lished numerous papers that study
the behavioral effects off stress inoc
ulation in primates. Both
researchers declined to comment on
PETA's accusations.
"We really stress that when a
