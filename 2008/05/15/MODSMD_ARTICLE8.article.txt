## In two places at once Professor Clifford Nass 
### STACIE CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The joy of research
is to know something
that no one else
knows, then tell
everyone about it."

glasses and the unshaven, beaming face beneath.
If you were a Thomas M. Storke Professor in Communi
cation, as well as a professor in the Computer Science, Soci
ology, Science and Technology in Society and Symbolic Sys
tems departments — not to mention director of Stanford's
Communication between Humans and Interactive Media
(CHIMe) Lab. and co-director of the Kozmetsky Global
Collaboratory — appearance might be the last thing on your
mind, too.
"Cliff's one of the most brilliant people I've ever met,"
said Jonathan Jourdane '08, former Otero Resident Assis
tant (RA) where Nass is an RF.'And not just when it comes
to his research We can discuss everything from calculus to
matrix algebra to politics to computer science to life. He lis
tens really attentively to any issue that people are having
and always has some profound insight."
It seems impossible that Nass can be a professor, research
director, RF and advisor all at the same time. Perhaps it's his
training as a magician that allows him to vanish from one
place to the next, arriving just in the nick of time with a half
tucked-in. mis-buttoned dress shirt, sweatpants, high socks
and tennis shoes.
His research and theories have been applied to over 250
media products for companies like Microsoft,Toyota, BMW,
Sony, Time-Warner and Hewlett-Packard. One of his more
famous theories, "The Media Equation," explains that hu
mans interact socially with computers just as they would
with other humans — this theory of computers as social ac
tors is heavily referenced in many social-psychological pa
pers today.
But the ever-humble Nass is quick to shift the spotlight
to his students. Eager to share his passion, Nass encourages
all students to conduct their own research through his Com
munication 268 class,"Experimental Research in Advanced
User Interfaces."
"It's the only class of its kind in the nation," Nass explains.
"We need more courses like this to capture the joy of discov
ery, not just the 'right' answer."
His main philosophy, as he puts it, is that "the joy of re
search is to know something that no one else knows, then tell
everyone about it."
"That's my reason for researching," he added. "It's good
motivation, and 1 really do believe that's the magic. That's
what gets students excited."
Nass manages to inspire his students, regardless of what
class he may be teaching.
"Cliff is an incredibly gifted teacher, one who can make
everyday lessons come to life and get students excited about
learning " said Communication coterm student Matt Vassar.
"More than that, though, he's a caring man — one who has

always been willing to help me in any of my academic strug
gles."
But it's not these endless accolades that he cites as his
most important accomplishments; it took hard work to get to
where he is. After graduating cum laude from Princeton — a
difficult journey both socially and academically — he al
most threw in the towel.
Rejected by 15 professional journals, Nass was ready to
resign to being a professional magician, but he gave acade
mia one more chance. His perseverance was rewarded when
the International Journal for Computer Science published
his theory.
The entire social-psychology field has benefited from his
over 100 published papers and two books, "The Media
Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and
New Media Like Real People and Places" (Cambridge Uni
versity Press) and "Wired for Speech: How Voice Activates
and Advances the Human-Computer Relationship" (MIT
Press), which won the International Communication Associ
ation Outstanding Book Award for 2007.
Despite his fame, being an RF is the job at which Nass

truly thrives.
"Cliff just brought this energy to the dorm," said former
resident Lovie Hutson '10. "He made people happy just by
being around them. And he was always concerned about the
well-being of his students. He helped me realize things about
myself as a person and as a student."
"Cliff has been an absolutely amazing RF and I can't
imagine freshman year without him," added Amelia Herrera
•11.
Wanting to provide a solid environment for his 16-year
old son, Matthew. Nass began his first year as an RF last year
in Otero.
"I was feeling really disconnected with undergrade and I
thought this would be a great way to reconnect," he said.
"And it's certainly been that. I've learned more about under
grads in one year as an RF than in my previous 21 years as a
professor."
"These kids are unbelievably energetic and amazingly,
stunningly sophisticated," he says, as his voice squeaks with
enthusiasm. "They're kids, and as an RF, it's a great, noble
thing to help transition kids to adulthood."
As an academic, Nass believes fostering a safe, secure en
vironment can help students mature and take academic
risks.
"You need kids to feel like the dorm is their home," he
said. "They need to feel that they're not going to be yelled at
or fall through the cracks."
He creates this environment by searching his vast rolodex
of speakers and inviting them to the Otero lounge, holding
Math 51 tutoring sessions for his residents or hosting a
Thanksgiving feast in his RF cottage.
"He takes on so much but he never does anything less
than his best," Jourdane said. "And through it all, he has a
genuine care for every single person that he's encountered,
from residents to random people he meets on the street. I
don't know how he does it, but he does."

everyone about it."
"That's my reason for researching," he added. "It's good
motivation, and 1 really do believe that's the magic. That's
what gets students excited."
Nass manages to inspire his students, regardless of what
class he may be teaching.
"Cliff is an incredibly gifted teacher, one who can make
everyday lessons come to life and get students excited about
learning " said Communication coterm student Matt Vassar.
"More than that, though, he's a caring man — one who has

always been willing to help me in any of my academic strug
gles."
But it's not these endless accolades that he cites as his
most important accomplishments; it took hard work to get to
where he is. After graduating cum laude from Princeton — a
difficult journey both socially and academically — he al
most threw in the towel.
Rejected by 15 professional journals, Nass was ready to
resign to being a professional magician, but he gave acade
mia one more chance. His perseverance was rewarded when
the International Journal for Computer Science published
his theory.
The entire social-psychology field has benefited from his
over 100 published papers and two books, "The Media
Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and
New Media Like Real People and Places" (Cambridge Uni
versity Press) and "Wired for Speech: How Voice Activates
and Advances the Human-Computer Relationship" (MIT
Press), which won the International Communication Associ
ation Outstanding Book Award for 2007.
Despite his fame, being an RF is the job at which Nass

truly thrives.
"Cliff just brought this energy to the dorm," said former
resident Lovie Hutson '10. "He made people happy just by
being around them. And he was always concerned about the
well-being of his students. He helped me realize things about
myself as a person and as a student."
"Cliff has been an absolutely amazing RF and I can't
imagine freshman year without him," added Amelia Herrera
•11.
Wanting to provide a solid environment for his 16-year
old son, Matthew. Nass began his first year as an RF last year
in Otero.
"I was feeling really disconnected with undergrade and I
thought this would be a great way to reconnect," he said.
"And it's certainly been that. I've learned more about under
grads in one year as an RF than in my previous 21 years as a
professor."
"These kids are unbelievably energetic and amazingly,
stunningly sophisticated," he says, as his voice squeaks with
enthusiasm. "They're kids, and as an RF, it's a great, noble
thing to help transition kids to adulthood."
As an academic, Nass believes fostering a safe, secure en
vironment can help students mature and take academic
risks.
"You need kids to feel like the dorm is their home," he
said. "They need to feel that they're not going to be yelled at
or fall through the cracks."
He creates this environment by searching his vast rolodex
of speakers and inviting them to the Otero lounge, holding
Math 51 tutoring sessions for his residents or hosting a
Thanksgiving feast in his RF cottage.
"He takes on so much but he never does anything less
than his best," Jourdane said. "And through it all, he has a
genuine care for every single person that he's encountered,
from residents to random people he meets on the street. I
don't know how he does it, but he does."
