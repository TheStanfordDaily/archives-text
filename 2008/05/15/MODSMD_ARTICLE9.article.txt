# Stanford students start it up

—- n-tre-pre-neur. Most of us couldn't pro
' nounce that word until we were twelve, let
alone understand its significance. Here on
the Farm, however — though we may still
JL—J have difficulty spelling that word — it has
become part of our everyday lexicon.
What's the deal with Stanford spawning so many
entrepreneurs anyway?
"Everyone and their mother at Stanford wants to
start a company," said Kayvon Beykpour TO, co
founder of TerriblyClever Design, an advertising

agency with clients that include Sprint,
Best Buy and Comcast."What's great
L, is that the resources in people.

P ideas and collaboration that
, Stanford provides make it so
conducive to do so."

Features presents a closer
look at two startups, Increo Solu
tions and Terribly Clever, run by
current students.

Increo Solutions
Increo Solu
tions was founded
one year ago by
L Stanford students
Jeff Seibert '08,

Kimber Lock
hart '08.

Rebecca Illowsky '08 and Ray Thang '08. The idea
arose from CS 194, a course that gave the four stu
dents an entire quarter to craft their own project.
To aid in their brainstorming, the team created a plat
form for members to share their project ideas. They
soon realized the power that sharing different ideas
could have, so they decided to build an idea exchange
network that would make it easier for everyone to ac
cess and share ideas.This is how Backboard was born.
"Backboard allows users to give and receive feed
back, exchange thoughts and brainstorm ideas on any
document," said Seibert. "This makes it a very func
tional and practical tool, especially for group proj
ects."
"Not everyone wants to share their ideas with the
world," said Lockhart, speaking of blogs and other
open platforms for thought-exchange. "However,
people working within a group or company have
more incentive to make their ideas be heard, ex
changed and implemented, which is what Backboard
seeks to address."
But the path to fame thus far hasn't been an easy
one.
"We worked almost full-time on the project dur
ing summer and the school year." said Lockhart.
"Raising money,especially as a student, is very tough,
and bottlenecks are many and unexpected — you
just have to focus on the task at hand and work to
ward achieving it as quickly as possible."
So how has being at Stanford complemented the
journey?
"Coming from Baltimore, a city dominated by
[Johns Hopkins University] where everyone wants to
be a doctor, Stanford has been nothing short of en
couraging in my endeavor to establish a tech start
up," said Seibert. "The network database is invalu
able; you just need to learn to leverage it."
Ito "The Stanford culture has a high tolerance
k for failure," added Lockhart. "If your start-up
doesn't do too well, it is not representative of your
skills; embrace the failure and see how much more
the Valley has to offer."
The Increo team concluded with this advice.
"Find a good team," Lockhart said. "Everyone
kept telling me to do so but I didn't realize how im
portant that bit of advice actually was until I started
spending hours on end with my group."
"Also, incorporate early on," Lockhart added.
"Once life picks up, you realize that there's no time
for small things later on."

Terribly Clever Design
Finding that perfect team can be a challenge, but
sometimes it's an obvious choice — like parternering
with your best friend since elementary school. That's
just what sophomore Kayvon Beykpour did with Joe
Bernstein, who currently works full-time for the com
pany out of Boston.
Terribly Clever is an advertising agency that spe
cializes in helping big brands expand to the Facebook
medium. What started out as a basic Web design plat
form five years ago has turned into a company that
assists clients with bringing their marketing cam
paign to Facebook.
"As consumers and producers of Facebook, we are
in a good position to build upon the expertise of the
medium and develop sophisticated applications to
change the way people think about applications,"
said Beykpour.
"Our newest application, Travel Journal, lets the
user document his or her trips on Facebook, provid
ing a centralized place to put pictures, journal entries
and scrapbook notes," he said. "Letting the user see
geographically what his or her trips look like is a cool
way to contextualize your trips."
Beykpour shared his take on this Valley term of
"entrepreneurship" and founding companies as a
Stanford student.
"Terribly Clever has been a great experience in
dealing with people, managing time and balancing
school and work," he said. "Undeniably, however,
the resources at Stanford made for a very con
ducive environment to collaborate, learn and

grow."
As for advice. Beykpour's thoughts are
simple.

"You need to love what you do — 1
wouldn't have been able to spend 900
hours on a project if I didn't feel passion
ate about it,"he said. "And on a side note,
my Facebook status was online through- I
out those 900 hours, but I'm really not that
massive a stalker."
