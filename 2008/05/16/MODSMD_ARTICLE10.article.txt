## Bone marrow donors sought for Cal grad Students hope to register donors to help find bone marrow match 
### KELSEY MESHER DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford students are rallying behind Cal
grad Michelle Maykin in her battle against acute
myeloid leukemia.
Project Michelle, organized by friends and
family, has put together a local registration drive
taking place today between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in
the Juniper room of Tresidder Union. The drive is
part of a larger nationwide campaign to find a
bone marrow match for Maykin, who was diag
nosed with leukemia in 2007.
Born in Texas, Maykin grew up in the Bay Area
and graduated from UC-Berkeley in 2004 with a
double major in Business Administration and
Political Economy. She recently became a mem
ber of the Stanford community when her
boyfriend of six years. Van Le, was admitted to the
Graduate School of Business this spring.
"She's gone through chemotherapy before and
this latest development is the impetus for the
bone marrow transplant," said Robbie Evans, a
friend of Maykin's who works at the Stanford
Management Company. "This is a fairly recent
development â€” [we learned about it] just a cou
ple of weeks ago."
Maykin's friends and family have created
Project Michelle in hopes of finding a donor
match before June 21. Their goal is to register
15,000 new potential donors through hundreds of
drives over the next six weeks.
But reaching that goal is not Project Michelle's
only challenge: organizers are especially looking
to attract high numbers of Asian donors to match
Maykin's Chinese-Vietnamese-Thai background.
Because tissue type is inherited, the best chance
for a match is a donor with a similar ethnic back
ground as the patient.
"The donor registry is really lacking in minori
ty donors, especially Asians and Pacific Islanders,"
Evans said.
"Asians, for cultural reasons and just because
there are less of them, are less likely to partici
pate," said Phillip So '09, former community serv
ice chair for Asian interest fraternity Lambda Phi
Epsilon, which is nationally affiliated with the
Asian American Donors Program and holds sev
eral registration drives on campus. "Asian patients
are much, much, much less likely to find a match."
Evans said that while registration is always free
for minorities, the Asian American Donor
Program (AADP) has recently been providing
financial support for Caucasians who register.
After May 19. however, fees will be put back in
place.
"Recently this organization has been under
writing the cost of testing," Evans said. "It will still
be free for minorities to register but for
Caucasians there will be a fee incurred."
While a match for Maykin will probably not be
from a Caucasian donor, an increase in people
who register may translate into more matches for
other patients in need.
Stanford students, faculty and staff can help
Michelle and others like her by registering today
at Tresidder, at the Clark Building of the Stanford
Medical School on May 23 or at any local registra
tion drive.
In bone marrow drives, registrants are usually
expected to complete a short health questionnaire
and take a cheek cell swab that can be tested for
tissue type. These samples are stored in a donor
registry that will be used to help locate a match
between donors and patients in need of a bone
marrow transplant.
