## Academic Council reviews building plans 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President John Hennessy and a
panel of University officials dis
cussed construction on the Stanford
campus at the fortieth annual
Academic Council meeting
Thursday afternoon.
"Over the next three or four
years we will be engaged in a build
ing program whose scale is larger
than anything since the earliest days
of the University," Hennessy said.
The construction, which includes
a new building to house the
Graduate School of Business, a new
lab for the School of Medicine and
the completion of a second Science
and Engineering Quad, will focus on
energy conservation and flexibility,
panelists said.
Rising energy prices and envi
ronmental concerns have driven
Stanford to attempt to build cost
and energy-efficient buildings,
Hennessy told assembled faculty,
students and community members.
He said that the University
would apply lessons learned in the
construction of the Jerry Yang and
Akiko Yamazaki Environment and
Energy Building, which was dedicat
ed last March, to bring the entire
Science and Engineering Quad "to
the same environmental standards."
The ability to adapt the same
room for multiple purposes has
become crucial as rooms, even in
professional schools, must be used
for lectures, seminars and small
group breakout sessions.
"We need to build things flexi
ble," said Business School Senior
Associate Dean David Kreps, "so
that the same space can be reconfig
ured quickly and efficiently to meet
different needs on different days."

Panelists also emphasized the
importance of interdisciplinary col
laboration in planning for the build
ings. Many of the new facilities "will
house programs from a number of
different schools, independent labs,
centers and institutes under the

same roof," said Vice Provost and
Dean of Research Ann Arvin.
All of these needs must be met
while maintaining the Farm's tradi
tional ambience â€” which is no easy
task, according to University
Architect David Lenox.

"We are looking for a way to do
inspiring buildings and still have
them fit into the Stanford context."
Lenox said. "And that's hard."
