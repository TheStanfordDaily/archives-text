## Former lecturer to distribute free flying disks 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Former Engineering Lecturer
Alan Adler. the inventor of a long
range Aerobie flying disc, plans to
celebrate his seventieth birthday by
giving away a thousand Aerobies at
Manzanita Field on Saturday morn
ing at 11 a.m.
Adler said he took an interest in
the aerodynamics of flying discs like
Frisbees and soon discovered he
could improve the design.
"Whenever 1 played with a
Frisbee, [I was) aware of how thick it
was and how much air had to push
aside to make it fly," Adler said. "It
was interesting to come up with
something thinner that would have
less aerodynamic drag."
Adler did the first test flight of an
Aerobie ring across Roble Field in
1984 while teaching in the
Department of Mechanical
Engineering. The Aerobie set the
Guinness World Record in 1985 for
the farthest human-thrown object
by traveling 1,333 feet, which is
more than a quarter mile.
The Aerobie has been tossed
across Niagara Falls and the
Potomac River.
"The older I get, the more fun I
get from giving toys away," Adler
said.
