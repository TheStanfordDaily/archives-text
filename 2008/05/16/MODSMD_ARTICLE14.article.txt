## Editorial Board Yield uncertainty complicates admission decisions 
### 
On Thursday,The Daily reported that,
as of now, Stanford's undergraduate
admission yield rate for the Class of
2012 is an unprecedented 72 percent, while
peer institutions such as Harvard and Yale
announced that they plan to go deep into
their waitlists to fill up their classes. It is com
mendable that the University wishes to offer
acceptance to as many qualified applicants
as possible, and equally positive that so
many high school seniors are eager to accept
that offer. It is also testament to the success
of Admit Weekend that so many ProFros —
many struggling to pick between Stanford
and other attractive options — chose The
Farm.
But these soon-to-be freshmen will need
a place to live, and the current housing
crunch has been a hot topic on campus thus
year. In light of the strain on our current
housing infrastructure, the University
should either expect a higher yield rate —
and use the waitlist if necessary — or devel
op a feasible solution for its housing woes.
Next year's incoming class size is current
ly 1,727, and the Office of Admission's target
class size is 1.670 freshman. With Harvard
and other schools offering admission to be
tween 50 and 150 waitlisted students, it is en
tirely possible that some members of the
Class of 2012 will get off the waitlist at other
schools and opt to forgo the Stanford expe
rience. Nonetheless, it appears that the high
number of admitted freshmen could lead to
over-enrollment, despite Dean of Admis
sion Richard Shaw's March statement that
his office was being cautious to avoid such a
situation.
If over-enrollment does occur, the Uni
versity will likely face fall housing problems
once again. In February, Associate Director
of Student Housing Imogen Hinds told The
Daily,"[Student Housing is] challenged with
finding enough bed spaces to accommodate
all of the Stanford students that would like
to live on campus during certain quarters of
the year," she said. "We have had to convert
various non-traditional spaces into student
rooms and, based on equity standards, up
rate some student rooms to allow for an ad
ditional resident."
The anticipated opening of the Munger
graduate housing complex is likely to relieve
some of the crunch, but it is evident that
Stanford is bursting at the seams. Even
though housing alone is not the sole deter

minant of happiness in college, less-than
ideal housing situations can reflect negative
ly on a student's Stanford experience, espe
cially for freshmen new to dorm life.

As of now, Stanford's
undergraduate admission
yield rate for the Class of 2012
is an unprecedented
72 percent.

Given the last two year's yield rates of 69
and 70.8 percent respectively, it does not
seem surprising that 72 percent of those of
fered admission this year accepted — this is
certainly not an enormous increase in yield
beyond what the Office of Admission could
reasonably be expected to anticipate. As a
result of Harvard and Princeton discontinu
ing their early admission policies, it is under
standable that the yield was especially diffi
cult to predict. In light of the attendant hous
ing crunch, however, the University might
have hedged its bets by admitting fewer stu
dents and going to the wait list if needed. It
is unclear whether other institutions' deci
sions to admit more conservatively and ac
cept more waitlisted students is a better
method, but it would seem to preclude the
over-enrollment problem that Stanford may
face next year.
While we are constantly reminded of the
outstanding qualifications of the applicants
to Stanford and sympathize with admission
officers who must deny acceptance to thou
sands of exciting applicants, the prospect of
over-enrollment leads to tough choices. Al
ready the Office of Admission plans to halve
the number of transfer students from 40 to
20, a move that Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott called a "negative conse
quence" of such a high yield. In an Apr. 2
Daily story about the discontinuation of
transfer acceptance at Harvard and Prince

mitted to accepting transfer students, "espe-
