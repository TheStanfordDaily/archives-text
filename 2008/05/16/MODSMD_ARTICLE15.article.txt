## Stopping personal tragedies in advance 
### 
I should have known it was going to hap
pen. Six people, one small car. reckless
driving and. of course, no seatbelts. The
car crash came so fast that I didn't even have
time to process what was going on. I thought
I was going to die at any moment, that these
were my last few seconds of consciousness
before everything was going to go blank.
After the car came to a stop, it took me a
while to realize that I was still alive, that my
body and mind were intact.
I came away from that event with a new
found appreciation for the fragility of life
and the speed at which it can be taken away.
Yet death wouldn't have even been the
worst outcome of that crash. What really
scares me is the idea that, although still
alive, I could experience a drastic decrease,
in the quality of life. I imagine myself,
turned vegetable, sitting in a bed for 30
years, silently screaming in agony as my
friends and family misinterpret my reflexive
smiles and babbles as signs of contentment.
This isn't some theoretical exercise â€”
every day, thousands of people, from college
students to grandparents, find themselves in
medical limbo. Whether they've become
comatose from a car accident or suffered se
vere brain damage from a stroke, they have
to endure a significant reduction in their
quality of life.
Most people do not explicitly state on
paper what kind of health treatments they
want in the event that they lose the mental
capability to decide for themselves. Thus
others, such as next of kin. make decisions
for them, and sometimes these decisions are
not what the injured person would have
wanted. Many conflicts arise when family
members decide to prolong a loved one's
life when that person would have wanted to
peacefully pass away, given the option. In
other cases, one section of the family wants
to let a person go while another faction
wants to continue aggressive treatment.
(The Terry Schiavo case was a prime exam

pic of this.) And in California, there is no
legal hierarchy for naming the decision
maker.
You can do a service to yourself and your
family by getting an Advance Directive.
ITiis is a type of will that designates your
healthcare wishes in the event that you can't
make them yourself, and it also lets you
choose "agents" who will carry out your
dying wishes. It enables you and your loved
ones to make good, rational decisions in the
calm of the present moment.
Although 1 am biased towards ending a
miserable existence sooner rather than
later, an Advance Directive by no means
hastens your death. It merely states, very ex
plicitly, what kind of health treatments you
do or do not want to receive.
Many people hold off on these conversa
tions and decisions until a situation de
mands it.but this is like figuring out a fire es
cape plan as a fire burns around you.
If you are interested in getting an Ad
vance Directive, there are resources on
hand to help you navigate the process. I con
sulted and got my own Advance Directive
from Betsy Carpenter, the contact for Ad
vance Directives at Stanford and at El
Camino Hospital. Many of us have grand
parents or even parents that may be faced
with strategic health choices soon, and it is
of utmost importance to make these health
decisions now. You can be in control in a cri
sis.
