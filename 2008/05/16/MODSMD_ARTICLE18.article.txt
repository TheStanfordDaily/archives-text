## In defense of unpunctuality 
### 
Punctuality — buzzword of business
men and army lieutenants alike. It is the
defining feature of the stereotypical
German, the mark of the prototypical train
conductor and the curse of the typical Stan
ford student. When 1 hear punctuality. 1 think
polished pocket watches and shined shoes,
long orderly military columns and board
rooms filled to capacity at the striking of the
hour. And. while it is generally bad form to
make comparisons to fascist dictatorships, I
immediately and directly associate punctual
ity with Italy from 1922 through 1943, during
which "the trains ran on time."
If you haven't guessed yet. 1 am not a fan.
And while, admittedly, we don't actually use
the word "punctuality" all that often in daily
speech, time is everywhere, and we give it
quite a high value, especially in this cut
throat academic environment. Deadlines
loom, appointments beckon and even time
spent with friends must be forced into a rigid
and unforgiving schedule.
Punctuality is an ultimate good: it is wide
ly assumed that you cannot be too punctual.
Thus, from some some, it has been classified
as a "virtue." But the unfortunate downside
of its status as a virtue is that there doesn't
seem to be a valid excuse for its opposite,
lateness, any more than there is a valid ex
cuse for evil as opposed to good. Lateness
has become hopelessly intertwined with evil
and, furthermore, that most hateful of no
tions, disrespect.
Surely, this is true, to a certain extent. I am
being disrespectful by showing up more than
a certain number of minutes late to various
functions.There really isn't any arguing here.
As such, a rational argument for premeditat
ed lateness would be tantamount to a public
endorsement of Satanism.
What I argue, however, is that it doesn't
have to be this way. Lateness is only disre

spectful because our culture dictates that it
be so. And, I will further argue, we should se
riously question where this punctuality
fetishism ultimately comes from.
Before the accusations of "entitlement"
start rolling in, as they inevitably do when any
Stanford student produces any kind of writ
ten output, 1 should note that whole swaths of
our country and, indeed, the majority of the
world, would agree with me when I say that
Americans overvalue the minute as a unit of
time. 1 am not claiming that I should be able
to be late because I'm special or anything of
the sort. Instead, I am arguing for a general
ized paradigm shift in the way we view late
ness. This new paradigm would apply just as
equally to me as it does to anyone else.
That said, what we as a culture fail to real
ize is that this temporal obsession is a partic
ularly American vice. In many North
African, Latin American and Mediterranean
countries, it is common, even accepted, to ar
rive late to various functions. A wedding din
ner scheduled for 9 o'clock will serve dinner
at two in the morning.
It was only March of last year that the
country of Peru launched an initiative to in
crease punctuality within its borders. On an
appointed day in that month, 28 million peo
ple synchronized their watches to twelve
noon. The government was attempting to
combat the typical notion of hora Peruana, or
"Peruvian time," a phrase typically denoting

up to an hour of lateness to every major func
tion. Hora Americana, American time, has
come to be the standard in Peru — such late
ness is no longer tolerated.
The change was initiated by Peruvian presi
dent Alan Garcia, who believed that the "prob
lem" of lateness was hurting national produc
tivity. And in typical fashion, he quoted the
adage "time is money" to justify his decision.
But here lies the problem of the decision.
At least since the democratic restoration of
Peru in 1979, it had been living fine, more or
less, without having to worry too much about
time, deadlines, punctuality and the like. It
had comfortably situated itself within a para
digm that allowed for lateness. But in a rush
to fully modernize, as it were, the leadership
felt it was necessary to enforce punctuality.
Punctuality is accepted as seemingly syn
onymous with progress, modernization, in
dustrial output and efficiency. To endorse a
system that allowed flexibility when it came
to lateness would mean to go backwards in
time, to revert to a simpler, more primitive
existence. After all, hunter-gatherers don't
have clocks or day planners.
But at the heart of all of this is a cultural
ly-biased perspective. 1 will not claim, as oth
ers have, that some "Protestant work ethic"
has fueled the modern shift. Instead, the
business world, with its insistence on efficien
cy above all else, has bled into our daily lives.
What has happened to spontaneity, to late
ness for the sake of beautiful irregularity? It
has been swallowed by the notion that time is
money. Punctuality may be good and fine for
the train conductor, but I don't want to con
duct my life like a train. I want to be derailed
sometimes.
