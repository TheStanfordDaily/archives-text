### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Cardinal track
and field team will head to Sun Angel
Stadium in Tempe, Ariz, to compete
in the Pac-10 Championships. In the
latest national rankings, the women
are ranked eighth, while the men are
42nd.
Six of the men's teams at this
weekend's competition are ranked in
the top 25 nationally; the women
have five in the top-25, led by No. 1
Arizona State.
Last season, the women placed
second at Pac-10 Championships —
held at Stanford — while the men
came in eighth. Arizona enters the
meet as the defending women's
champions, while Oregon hopes to
retain its champion title on the men's
side.
The Cardinal women are led by
two defending Pac-10 champions:
seniors Erica McLain in the triple
jump and Teresa McWalters in the
10,000 meters. For the men, 1.500
meter champion senior Russell
Brown will attempt to defend his
title.
Stanford also has several other
athletes who are in the top ten in the
Pac-10 in several events. These ath
letes will have the opportunity to
earn points for Stanford and im
prove upon their personal marks be
fore heading to NCAA Champi
onships. The men feature runners
like senior Wopamo Osaisai, fresh
man Andrew Dargie and Brown,
while the women have athletes such
as sophomore Griffin Matthew, jun
ior Alicia Follmar and senior Lauren
Centrowitz.
Stanford's top hurdler, Myles
Bradley spoke of the competition;
the junior will compete in both the
hurdles and the long jump.
"Pac-10's is a scored meet, so
everything is about place and points.
Everyone's focus in the preliminary
rounds is solely to make the finals,"

he said. "I've only competed in the
long jump one time this year, hut I
think if I can get some things togeth
er, then I will be in a great position to
score some points.
"I have more experience in the
hurdles, though the Pac-10 confer
ence is very deep in the event with
the top six hurdlers in the top 19 in
the country. 1 am very excited to
compete at this meet. I was hurt
freshman year and did quite poorly
and then was hurt and did not com
pete last year."
Bradley went on: "The men have
not done very well as a team the last
couple years at this meet, so we defi

nitely want to demonstrate our
depth with a great showing here. I
know everyone is very excited for
this meet and ready [to] put down
some great performances."
The multi-event athletes got Stan
ford off to a great start last year, as
they put the women in second place
and the men in third. The leaders of
last weekend for the Cardinal —
Stewart and Hustedt — return to
sunny Arizona this weekend to com
pete in individual events as they look
to contribute to a Cardinal victory.

Both the Stanford men and women will face difficult conference opponents
when they compete in the track and field Pac-10 Championships this weekend
in Arizona, but both squads have the personnel necessary to compete.
