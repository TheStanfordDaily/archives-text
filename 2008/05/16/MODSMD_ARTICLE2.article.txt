## Cardinal faces Wildcats with conference title on the line 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
As their regular season winds down.
No. 14 Stanford (30-18-2, 11-7 Pac-10)
will hit the road over the next two week
ends to face two tough Pae-10 opponents,
Arizona and Washington. Tomorrow,
they'll head to the desert to take on the
Wildcats.
Arizona (34-15,8-10 Pac-10) is partic
ularly difficult to face in Tucson — they
have only lost two games at home all
year. Stanford coach Mark Marquess rec
ognized the difficult task his team will
face.
"They're tough to beat at home," he
said.
The Wildcats will try and assert their

authority on the mound as they send up a
formidable threesome in Preston Guil
met, David Coulon and Eric Berger.They
have been a reliable trio for Arizona, a
team that doesn't have the same consis
tent offense that other Pac-10 teams
have.
Still, the Wildcats have a number of
strong hitters. Freshman shortstop Bryce
Ortega leads the starters in batting aver
age, while juniors Jon Gaston and Brad
Glenn and senior C'.J. Ziegler provide the
power for Arizona.
In particular, Ziegler — who was
drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals last
year but returned to school — has had an
impressive season. His .340 average and
16 homeruns are among the best in the
conference.

But Stanford's lineup has stars of its
own.
Senior first baseman and designated
hitter Randy Molina has been on fire as
of late, with a .412 batting average over
his past five games. He leads the team at
.370. His platoon partner, junior Brent
Milleville, has followed suit: he's slugged
1.059 over the same span, which includes
a big grand slam over Cal last weekend.
But while Molina and Milleville have
been hot lately, the Cardinal's offense
couldn't come through against the Gold
en Bears — largely productive pitching
performances went to the wayside as
Stanford couldn't push runners across

NOTES: Arizona has only lost two contests at home
all season. Stanford is currently one game behind
Arizona State in the Fbc-10 standings, which de
termine the team that will win the conference
championship. Both of the Cardinal's first base
men are on tears right now— Randy Molina has
hit .412 over his past five games and Brent
Milleville has slugged 1.059 over the same span.

the plate. Still, the offense has car
ried the team all season, and the Cal
series may prove to he an anomaly:
on Monday night, the bats erupted
to the tune of 15 runs.
Marquess was not concerned.
"(The hitting] has been really
consistent," he said. "1 think that's
why we are where we are."
The pitching has come through
as well — the bullpen's depth has
been on display throughout the lat
ter part of the season. But the suc
cess starts at the top and, more
specifically, with the three hurlers
who have become the steady week
end starters for the Cardinal.
Junior Austin Yount will head to
the mound on Saturday for Stan
ford. Yount began the year as a des
ignated hitter and infielder but
spent more time in the bullpen as
the season progressed. He has be
come a reliable starter for the Car
dinal. going for seven innings or
more in each of his past three starts.
"Austin has had some quality
starts," said Marquess. "That's
huge."
Senior Erik Davis, the staff ace,
will pitch the all-important middle
game.
"Davis is the critical guy. He's
the anchor," said Marquess.

"The hitting has
been really
consistent. I think
that's why we are
where we are."
— MARK MARQUESS,
Coach

Sophomore Jeffrey Inman, who
has quietly compiled a 7-2 record
and 3.51 FRA, will pitch on Mon
day.
Every game is important for
Stanford: the Cardinal has its eye on
the Pac-10 crown and the possibility
of hosting a regional in the NCAA
tournament. Currently. Stanford is
behind Arizona State by one game

in the conference. Stanford is a lock
to make the postseason, hut if the
Cardinal can overcome the Sun
Devils, then there is a good chance
that a regional bracket will be held
on the Farm. Securing one at home
would be considered quite a coup.
"If we finish No. 1 (in the confer
ence], we'll definitely host." said
Marquess. "Even if we finish No. 2.
there's a good chance we'll host."
But while a conference champi
onship is certainly the Cardinal's
goal, the team faces stiff competi
tion from not only Arizona State
but from a number of other Pac-10
contenders as well. Five teams have
a shot at the title, including Wash
ington. who the Cardinal will face
next weekend.
"The league is so strong from top
to bottom," said Marquess. "There
is so much parity."
There is no better example of
this fact than the Wildcats, who, de
spite an 8-10 Pac-10 record, have
dominated out-of-conference foes.
They pose a tough challenge to
Stanford as a potential spoiler of
their Pac-10 championship and
postseason aspirations.
