## Cardinal faces Wildcats with conference title on the line 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
As their regular season winds down.
No. 14 Stanford (30-18-2, 11-7 Pac-10)
will hit the road over the next two week
ends to face two tough Pae-10 opponents,
Arizona and Washington. Tomorrow,
they'll head to the desert to take on the
Wildcats.
Arizona (34-15,8-10 Pac-10) is partic
ularly difficult to face in Tucson — they
have only lost two games at home all
year. Stanford coach Mark Marquess rec
ognized the difficult task his team will
face.
"They're tough to beat at home," he
said.
The Wildcats will try and assert their

authority on the mound as they send up a
formidable threesome in Preston Guil
met, David Coulon and Eric Berger.They
have been a reliable trio for Arizona, a
team that doesn't have the same consis
tent offense that other Pac-10 teams
have.
Still, the Wildcats have a number of
strong hitters. Freshman shortstop Bryce
Ortega leads the starters in batting aver
age, while juniors Jon Gaston and Brad
Glenn and senior C'.J. Ziegler provide the
power for Arizona.
In particular, Ziegler — who was
drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals last
year but returned to school — has had an
impressive season. His .340 average and
16 homeruns are among the best in the
conference.

But Stanford's lineup has stars of its
own.
Senior first baseman and designated
hitter Randy Molina has been on fire as
of late, with a .412 batting average over
his past five games. He leads the team at
.370. His platoon partner, junior Brent
Milleville, has followed suit: he's slugged
1.059 over the same span, which includes
a big grand slam over Cal last weekend.
But while Molina and Milleville have
been hot lately, the Cardinal's offense
couldn't come through against the Gold
en Bears — largely productive pitching
performances went to the wayside as
Stanford couldn't push runners across

NOTES: Arizona has only lost two contests at home
all season. Stanford is currently one game behind
Arizona State in the Fbc-10 standings, which de
termine the team that will win the conference
championship. Both of the Cardinal's first base
men are on tears right now— Randy Molina has
hit .412 over his past five games and Brent
Milleville has slugged 1.059 over the same span.
