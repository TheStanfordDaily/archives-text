## Heat wave scorches Stanford, Bay Area Record-high temperatures beleaguer students 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
Stanford students are flocking to
the fountains to escape record-high
temperatures that have sent a heat
wave across the Bay Area.
The National Weather Service has
issued a second "Excessive Heat
Warning" for the Bay Area for Friday
afternoon, forecasting temperatures
up to 98 degrees.
"It is not uncommon for the Bay
Area to experience temperatures
nearing 100 degrees during the latter
part of the summer, hut it is very
uncommon this early in the season,"
said Associate Vice Provost for
Environmental Health and Safety
Lawrence Gibbs in an email to The
Daily.
Before Thursday's peak at over 97
degrees, the record campus tempera
ture for May 15 was 91 degrees in
1976. If temperatures today reach the
forecast high, they will surpass the
current May 16 record high of 97
degrees, set in 1970.
Despite the high temperatures
and dry conditions, the University
reports little concern over the poten
tial for fires in the Stanford foothills.
According to Gibbs, the University
this year widened the fire break along
the foothills perimeter to 30 feet. He
noted that last summer's fire near the
Dish may have lessened the threat of
fires this year.
"Due to the fire last summer, there
may actually be less fuel available for
fire in the same areas," he said.
In addition, the University recent
ly installed additional fire hydrants in
order to augment the fire depart
ment's ability to suppress brush fires.
Fire isn't the only danger in light
of rising temperatures. All week, stu
dents have been sunning themselves
and wading in campus fountains in
large numbers. But despite this
increased student sun exposure, the
University reports no incidences of
heat-related illness.
Other students have been stuck

inside this week. Annie Jonas '08 has
spent the past ten days and nights
locked in her residence's computer
cluster, hard at work on an honors
thesis on propaganda in Maoist
China.
"I have been hot," Jonas said.
To cool down. "I stand closer to

the door." she explained, noting with
dismay that her efforts "have not
been successful." Last night she aban
doned hope, escaping to Panera
Bread in Cupertino, an air-condi
tioned haven.
Maura Burk '08. also in the throes
of indoor thesis completion, agrees

with Jonas' climactic assessments.
"I was actually shocked," she said
of a foray outdoors yesterday."I
walked to Advanced Wine Tasting
today... and it was hot."
The National Weather Service
projects the heat to break by the end
of this weekend, with high tempera

tures forecast to return to the low 80s
by Monday.
