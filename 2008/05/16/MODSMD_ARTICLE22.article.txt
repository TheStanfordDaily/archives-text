## Court legalizes gay marriage Top Calif. court overturns voter ban 
### LISA LEFF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
California's Supreme Court
declared that gay couples in the
nation's most populous state can
marry — a monumental hut perhaps
short-lived victory for the gay rights
movement ITiursday that was greet
ed with tears, hugs, kisses and at
least one instant proposal of matri
mony.
1 Same-sex couples could tie the
knot in as little as a month. But the
window could close soon after —
religious and social conservatives
are pressing to put a constitutional
amendment on the ballot in
November that would undo the
Supreme Court ruling and ban gay
marriage.
Essentially, this boils down to
love. We love each other. We now
have equal rights under the law,"
declared a jubilant Robin Tyler, a
plaintiff in the case along with her
partner. She added: "We're going to
get married. No Tupperware,
please."
A crowd of people raised their
fists in triumph inside City Hall, and
people wrapped themselves in the
rainbow-colored gay-pride flag out
side the courthouse. In the Castro,
long the center of the gay communi
ty in San Francisco, Tim Oviatt wept
as he watched the news on TV.
"I've been waiting for this all my
life. This is a life-affirming moment,"
he said.
By the afternoon, gay and lesbian
couples had already started lining
up at San Francisco City Hall to
make appointments to get marriage
licenses. In West Hollywood, sup
porters planned to serve "wedding
cake" at an evening celebration.
James Dobson — chairman of
the conservative Christian group
Focus on the Family, which has spent
thousands of dollars to get the meas
ure on the ballot — called the ruling
an outrage.
"It will be up to the people of
California to preserve traditional
marriage by passing a constitutional
amendment. ... Only then can they
protect themselves from this latest
example of judicial tyranny," he said
in an e-mailed statement.
In its 4-3 ruling, the Republican

dominated high court struck down
state laws against same-sex marriage
and said domestic partnerships that
provide many of the rights and ben
efits of matrimony are not enough.
"In contrast to earlier times, our
state now recognizes that an individ
ual's capacity to establish a loving
and long-term committed relation
ship with another person and
responsibly to care for and raise
children does not depend upon the
individual's sexual orientation,"
Chief Justice Ronald George wrote
for the majority in ringing language

that delighted gay rights activists.
Massachusetts in 2004 became
the first, and so far only, state to
legalize gay marriage; more than
9,500 couples have taken advantage
of the law. But the California ruling
is considered monumental by virtue
of the state's size —38 million —
and its historical role as the van
guard of many social and cultural
changes that have swept the country
since World War 11.
California has an estimated
108,734 same-sex households,
according to 2006 census figures.
