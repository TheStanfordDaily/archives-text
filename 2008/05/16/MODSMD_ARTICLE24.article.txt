## 'Midsummer' is Dreamy 
### CHELSEY LITTLE INTERMISSION HARD-WATCHER 
"1 have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was." The Stanford Shakespeare Company's produc
tion of A Midsummer Night's Dream is a wondrous dream indeed, but not your typical rendition of this old-time fa
i voritc. For starters, it's set in 1950s Athens, USA. Director Julia Meltzer '09 decided to use this classic to mount an ex-
V ploration of gender roles in our post-war American society, raising questions concerning "sex, love, marriage, power
A and control."

The play certainly does raise such questions as the entire plot, which often centers around the delightfully mis
chievous Puck (played by Zach Chotzen-Freund '09), now focuses much more on the women characters in the
play: Helena, Hermia and Titiania. The stories of these characters are brought to the attention of the audience.
The plight of Helena (Emily Brauer '09) is particularly compelling as the audience watches her struggle for love
and for self-worth apart from the men who, under the influence of magic, profess their undying affection.

The face-off between Helena and Hermia (Geete Persad '10) is an excellent moment in the play — their
rapid-fire catfight, set off by the ridiculous display of masculinity by Lysander (Aaron Berg '09) and Demetrius
V (Alex Connolly '11), is uproarious and splendid. Each of the four lovers performs their role with articulate

humor, especially Connolly whose Demetrius is absolutely hilarious and on-point; each word and move-
ment is perfect. Connolly, whom you might recognize from Rams Head's Gaieties, brings out a great

deal in his fellow ensemble members as the connection between him and Brauer, albeit magically

induced, is still quite passionate.

MSND opened Wednesday night to a decent crowd full of supportive and en
couraging Stanford students reclining on the grass and consuming fine wine and

goodies while enjoying the spectacle that ensued. Old Union Courtyard, host
V to the event for its entire duration, is a splendid location for this outdoor

theatre experience. Coupled with the first warm nights of the year, MSND
V is the perfect theatrical event to attend this weekend.

But forget about the weather and location — if nothing else, this play
is worth viewing for its fantastic ensemble work and perfectly executed
individual characterizations. Each player onstage adds to the magic tak-

ing place, whether speaking or not. Every single member of the Stan-
Shakes ensemble adds to the energy and vibrancy of the piece and when
a formerly silent character opens their mouth, if you were skeptical before.

/ all doubt disintegrates as the beautiful verse is splendidly articulated. Spe
cific moments of ensemble brilliance include the face-off between gangs of
Oberon and Titania and the Rude Mechanicals production within the pro
duction of Pyramus and Thisbe.

The actors execute their roles brilliantly, but the highlight of the evening

/ in many respects is Nisa Ari '08 as the fairy-queen, Titania. With her four
112 years of experience with StanShakes, one can expect nothing less. Her por
trayal of the empowered women beguiled by Oberon (Michael Hammersley
'11) is eye-opening and remarkable. The chemistry between the two fairy

112 leaders onstage is also extremely striking and believable. Hammersley (who
can also be seen in the upcoming SLE production of Clifford Odet's "Waiting
for Lefty Thursday," May 29th) has quite the presence on-stage. The audience is

' compelled to both love and hate him as he exhibits both a detestable scorn for Ti
tania's affection and, simultaneously, a touching care for the plight of the other lovers
l the woods.

The Rude Mechanicals are extraordinary to say the least. Marlene Kennedy '11 plays

J Quince, the director of these players, and each and every line she delivers is comically truth
ful. Paired with the over-bearing yet somewhat charming Bottom (whom StanShakes veteran
Matt Velasco '08 represents divinely), she keeps the little ass in check in his moments of scene
stealing glory. Each of the players is unforgettable, among them the oh-so-cute Snug (Sashen
dra Aponso '11) who plays the cowardly lion and the subtly witty Snout (Michael Bateman '08)
, whose character, Wall, is almost too perfect.

Physically, the most noteworthy mechanical has to be Starveling, the tailor, played by Fa
reez Giga '08 whose staunch character stance and determined glare brings humor to scenes
. that would otherwise be missing that lovely element.

All in all, the production is sure to be an extremely delightful experience for all who
attend. The Stanford Shakespeare Company's production of "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" runs through Sunday, May 18th, with runtimes at 8:30 PM every evening
with a matinee performance Saturday, May 17th at 2:30 PM. Admission is free.
