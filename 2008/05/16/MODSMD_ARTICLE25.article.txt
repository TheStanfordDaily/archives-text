## Summer Scrum 
### TEDDY STEINKELLNER INTERMISSION SUMMER CHAMP 
Summer is never as much fun as you think it'll be. Boredom
abounds. Sunscreen sucks. There's never really a girl's cabin
across the lake. Our one escape from the constant disappoint
ment is the world of fiction: summer blockbusters and groovy
tunes glorify the season as a time for surfing, sex and switching
places with your long-lost twin. This week, Bracketology selects
the best fictional summer ever. Study it. emulate it, and you just
might have fun, fun, fun.
SWEET SIXTEEN
1. Beach Boys songs vs. 16. "The Lizzie McGuire Movie"
For anyone who's ever wanted to spend their summer like
Lizzie, switching places with an Italian pop star and riding around
on a Vespa with a cute boy â€” congratulations, you're a 12-year
old girl and everyone hates you. For normal people, an awesome
summer follows the Beach Boys' formula: good waves, good girls
and lots and lots of prescription drugs! (Okay, 2/3. Still.)
EDGE: Beach Boys.
8. "School's Out For Summer" vs. 9. "Summer of '69"
Alice Cooper's "School's Out For Summer" is the perfect an
them for all those times you thought you would celebrate as the
final school bell rang but never did. Bryan Adams's "Summer of
'69" is the ideal song for all those fake summer memories you'd
like to think you had with your friends. Tiebreaker? Innuendo.
"'69" wins.
EDGE: '"69."
5. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" vs. 12. "The Parent Trap"
In Shakespeare's classic, bitchy fairies turn young lovers
against each other. In the Lohan classic, bitchy little girls bring
their middle-aged parents together. As partial as I am to the se
cret butler handshake, it's hard to ignore the Bard's cultural sig
nificance. It's not as if "The Parent Trap" is being performed on
campus this very weekend. (It should be, though.)
EDGE: "Midsummer."
4. "Independence Day" vs. 13. "Summertime"
Will Smith is officially the King of Summer, and "Indepen
dence Day" is his seminal cinematic spectacular. But to me, the

Fresh Prince's magnum opus is the family-friendly rap "Summer
time." And no, DJ Jazzy Jeff, I'm not giving you any credit.
EDGE: "Summertime."
3. "Jaws" vs. 14. "Heavyweights"
Which of these movies presents the more terrifying scenario:
"Jaws" and its gargantuan, boat-chomping, lover-devouring
great white shark, or "Heavyweights," in which the world's great
est fat camp becomes a fitness-obsessed prison? The Judd Apa
tow-written (seriously!) "Heavyweights" does feature the great
est summer innovation since the air conditioner (You Tube
"Heavyweights + The Blob" now), but "Jaws" is the original
blockbuster.
EDGE: "Jaws"
6. "Stand By Me" vs. 11. "The Sandlot"
If I could trade my childhood memories for the ones the kids
had in these movies, I totally would. I feel deprived because I
never got chased by a big scary dog. I never saw a dead body. And,
most regrettably, 1 never fake-drowned in order to make out with
a hot lifeguard
EDGE: "The Sandlot."
7. "Dirty Dancing" vs. 10. "Almost Famous"
Both of these movies perfectly encapsulate what summer is all
about: gaining independence from your parents, going on crazy
vacations and losing your virginity (come on, Patrick Swayze and
Baby totally did it). Final verdict? Dancing Swayze > "Tiny
Dancer."
EDGE: "Dirty Dancing."
2. "Summer Nights" vs. 15. "Salute Your Shorts"
To me, the ultimate summer camp has always been Camp
Anawanna from Nickelodeon's "Salute Your Shorts." You
haven't officially grown up until you've received an Awful Waf
fle. But as far as influence goes, well, has a karaoke night ever
gone by without someone singing "Summer Nights" from
"Grease"?
EDGE: "Summer Nights."
ELITE EIGHT
1. The Beach Boys vs. 9. "Summer of '69"
Bryan Adams made one song about summer memories. The

Beach Boys are summer memories.
EDGE: Beach Boys.
5. "Midsummer" vs. 13. "Summertime"
It's hard to imagine anything more fun than chilling with scant
ily clad girls at a barbecue...oh, right. Chilling with scantily clad
fairies all the time.
EDGE: "Midsummer."
3. "Jaws" vs. 11. "The Sandlot"
The shark in "Jaws" is scary, sure. But it's nothing compared
to the-the-the-the...the BEAST!
EDGE: "Sandlot."
7. "Dirty Dancing" vs. 2. "Summer Nights"
A virtual deadlock. Travolta's superior coolness (back then,
not now. Dear Lord not now) squeaks him past Swayze.
EDGE: "Summer Nights."
FINAL FOUR
I. The Beach Boys vs. 5. "Midsummer"
If I'm gonna cruise down to the beach with my summer bros,
I'm sure as hell not going to blast Shakespeare-on-tape.
EDGE: Beach Boys.
11. "The Sandlot" vs. 2. "Summer Nights"
The 11 -year-old boy in me has to go "Sandlot." I mean, I don't
want anybody to think of me as a can't-hack-it pantywaist who
wears my mama's bra. An L-7 Weenie, if you will.
EDGE: "Sandlot."
CHAMPIONSHIP
1. The Beach Boys vs. 11. "The Sandlot"
The Beach Boys are everything summer is supposed to be. But
"The Sandlot" has everything you really want summer to have:
baseball, fireworks, carnivals, public pools, a stereotypical group
of ragtag friends, James Earl Jones and lots of contrived-yet
meaningful feel-good moments. And that's why it will live on in
our memories for-e-ver, for-e-ver, for-e-ver...
CHAMP: "The Sandlot."
MVP: Squints.
