# The 						Hospitality of Jose Lais Magaña Lemus

### MAX McCLURE INTERMISSION POLYGLOT WEIQI SAMANTHA TOH INTERMISSION FREELANCE TRAVEL AGENT 
Ever since the age of two, I've gone overseas at least once a year. Granted, that isn't a very
difficult thing to do — I live in Singapore, where it takes about an hour to travel from one

side of the country to the other. Beyond this, I'm bound to find myself crossing a na
tional boundary. But maybe it's the small size of my home city that gave my family the
impetus for travel, something that always occurred during the long months of summer.

I've always been glad for that and, more recently, even more so. As I think about what
comes after university — the daily grind, the short few weeks of leave, high blood pres
sure and work even as you try to holiday in the Bahamas with x number of clients calling
you on your multiple Blackberries — it seems like there's no better time to traverse
HL the world than now.

Finding A Middleman

' As broke college students, there are a few places to get cheap flights. Domestically, I x
there's the well-known Expedia, which can list flights according to prices, duration and departure or arrival
times. For international flights, however, STA Travel is probably the best option. STA has an office in Palo
Alto, and they have rather innovative travel packages, ranging from "Tours-n-Treks" to itineraries that
allow you to travel and volunteer at the same time. Examples include "Surf and Save Sea Turtles" in Costa

Rica. You can also work with orphans or elephants in Argentina and Namibia, respectively. Though 1 haven't tried any of these packages, the range
possibilities present does reflect the popularity of these projects.

Getting There

Depending on your budget, you have a host of airlines to choose from. If you're scrimping, I'd suggest picking the cheapest airline options
on Expedia or STA. You might have three-hour-long layovers, but bring a book, a laptop and a mobile phone, and time will pass in a hurry.
For those not on a budget, however, I'd recommend sampling some good airlines polled from Skytrax (http://www.airlinequality.com). I don't
mean to plug them shamelessly, but Singapore Airlines does come in tops — and that's objectively speaking. I just booked my flight home
l and was quite surprised to see an option that allowed me to pick a meal preference among the broad categories of "child, dietary, oriental
V and seafood, religious, vegetarian," within which there were further subsets. On the flights, there are also entertainment systems that in
\ elude a range of recently released movies (on last count, 25, from all continents), tens of CDs, games, etc. And for the record, I personal-
A ly also dig Cathay Pacific and Emirates.

Deciding Where To (Jo

Europe

W Traveling in Europe is, to put it succinctly, bloody expensive. For example, in 2005, the last time I
* \ was in Great Britain, I couldn't get a decent meal for less than £6(11.67 USD), much less anything
delicious. Still, trips to Europe are worth it for the 18th-century snobby culture that we'd like to be
lieve we absorb. Assuming limitless amounts of cash, I would probably live there.

\ Getting around, however, is easier. Eurorailways provided great service when I commuted between Germany an<
France, and there are hosts of low-cost airlines with special offers that are often a steal. A friend of mine reports having traveled
from London to Madrid and back for a total of £15 (29.14 USD).

Of the Western European countries I've visited, I enjoyed Italy the most. 1 don't think Venice can ever be overrated, however much
praise it already receives, while Assisi, 1 believe, is the most serene place 1 have ever visited. Even though 1 had arrived in the midst of
a wet September, and even though I resembled, for the most part, a drowned rat, everything around me still remained quite beautiful *
and glistening, touched by light.
So if cathedrals, museums and architecture are your thing, bust that wallet out — Europe's for you.
Australia/New Zealand

1 still remember visiting Australia when I was six, being slobbered over by a llama and a couple of sheep and driving around in a car with my parents on a long road trip
to eat oysters. New Zealand was all about the ferry, the blue waters and more sheep. 1 don't think there is much else to say because it's difficult to describe scenery without
it all sounding the same. As much as I loved the bustle of the cities (Sydney being my favorite — sorry, Melbourners!), there is something about this region that's deeply mov
ing and also markedly different — and definitely for the nature people.
Asia

An Asia-obsessed friend once said that part of his fixation came from the region's affordability. I've bought jeans for 150 baht (4.64 USD), jackets for a third of the price
and food for a fraction in Bangkok, Thailand. There are markets in Shanghai with street after street of incredible food, from 5 RMB (0.71 USD) boba tea to an

— amazing Chinese meals for 10 RMB (1.42 USD). Hong Kong too has the small coffee shops where you squeeze shoulder-to-shoulder as you
slurp tossed noodles and drink a porcelain cup of hot coffee.
Part of the thrill is going to a place so unlike anything you will ever see in the West. There are certainly complications associated with the
language barrier, especially in countries like China, Japan and northern Southeast Asia, so it will help if you go with a friend who speaks the na
tive tongue.
Asia, 1 think, is for people who like to try new things, to step out of boundaries, and to shop and eat.
For the undecided

There are still continents that I haven't been to (Africa, South America, Antarctica) and have no room to write about. But perhaps you can just
pick up a NatGeo magazine. Read some travel books. Close your eyes and jab a world map at random. Or perhaps you can find the nearest interna
tional student and hide in his suitcase as summer nears and see where you end up. Whichever way you pick, remember to live it up.

■ We eat breakfast at the first Jose Luis Magana Lemus's house. He is the first Jose Luis Magana Lemus
* because he is much older than the other Jose Luis Magana Lemus, who lives down the street but is not, as

far as we can tell, related. Our host does not find it interesting or surprising that he lives in a town with his doppelganger. Ah
yes, he says to us. "Jose Luis Magana Lemus, down the street. He works with windows.
Gary and I have noticed Sr. Magana before. He is a squat man with a pronounced hunch who speaks from his chest. His lips
are tough and rubbery and seem to suck inwards from lack of teeth. He whistles a lot. With his wife and chickens. Sr. Magana
lives in a ramshackle assortment of structures just across the street from the local clinic and has offered to feed us breakfast, lunch
and dinner today.
Gary and I live and work as volunteers in the town and, consequently, are dependent on its residents to feed us. Up to this
point, we have eaten at, among others:
* Three large, clean, multi-floored houses occupied by lonely women whose husbands and sons are in Nebraska

A kindergarten graduation ceremony
* Several roadside carts specializing in menudo
* A single-room shack with dirt floors occupied by a lady who owns four cats, all of which she hates
* The lopsided home of the local DJ
* Two really bad pizza places.

Sr. Magaiia is probably the least attractive of our hosts so far.
As he lets us into his house, Jose Luis Magaiia Lemus leans in very close, as a way of making us feel welcome. Unfortunately, as he
explains to us. he had tried to beat a marauding skunk away from his chickens with a two-by-four only a few hours earlier. This is per
haps why he smells very much as if he had been sprayed by a skunk. He elaborates a little about the incident as we walk, massaging
my shoulder with great enthusiasm. He mumbles and my Spanish is bad, so the story comes through somewhat garbled: I can make
J out that he hit the animal on the head very hard. He also says, as far as I can tell, that his awning plough is on fire.
His wife waits inside the small, dark kitchen area, with teal walls sparsely featuring crucifixes and unframed photos of family

1 ' members. The floor is covered with sacks of beans and, oddly enough, thick books, bound in wood. The wife immediately informs
us that her husband has recently been sprayed by a skunk. We let her know that we are aware of this, and she nods. She then tells us that her
name is Eusebia Magaiia Magaiia de Magaiia. 1 choke a little bit.
Is something wrong? she asks me.
No, no, but I maybe only have a little somethings in my throat, I reply in my Spanish.
Brushing flies away from the families' bag of week-old pastries and sipping sweet tea, it soon becomes clear that Sr. Magana's habit of
leaning in close to talk is, while disconcerting in that it reveals his spotted gums, necessary if we ever to hope to understand him. His mum
bling is not helped by his tendency to speak while chewing.
[—] a n 0 f y OU [—]? he asks us. We wait for a moment. It becomes clear that there will be no further explanation. I turn to Gary.
Pardon? says Gary.
How, he repeats, does [ — ]?
Good, I say. Very good. This is a dangerous move. I probably should have said "just last week," or maybe "nonprofit organization."
[ — ] i Sr. Magaiia clarifies. I decide that my next response, regardless of his question, will be "Fantastic."
Sr. Magaiia has now realized that we do not understand him and, in an ill-advised attempt to get through to us some other way, has begun
singing — softly at first, and then much louder, in a wavering baritone.
Veeeeeeennnnnn acadaddaaaadddaaadcia, moreeeeeeeeeeenaaaaaaaaaaa, he says.

Fantastic, I say.
To be frank, I am ready to leave at this point. I have had my share of sweet tea, and I'm a busy man. Before 10 rolls around. I
have to make a working model of the large intestine from construction paper. I can feel my habitual morning-time exhaustion creep
ing up as our hosts become less and less intelligible. But Sr. Magaha is not done. In fact, his extended family is coming to visit now.,
What is interesting about this plan is that, judging by the family photos I could see from the table, the Magana clan is larger than
most countries' legislative bodies, and Greg and I already take up a substantial portion of our hosts' tiny home.
Heralded by the sound of four white '97 F-150s parking on gravel, approximately 10,000 people enter a room the size of a box
of Chinese takeout. I don't remember their names, these spike-haired, be-poloed city folks who crowd around our calloused host,
showing pictures of their friends to grandpa on their cell phones. There are too many of them, and they are too well dressed. Stand- .
ing room only.

The room is very much filled, I point out to Sra. Magana, who nods.
Her husband begins to sing again.
There is something strange about dining in a complete stranger's home. It is the travel experience condensed
and contained, held in by the stare of the cook and a bowl of corundas. Caught in the press of the Magana blood
line, perpetually massaged by a 60-year-old I cannot for the life of me understand, I can do little more than ac
cept another cup of tea. I am paralyzed by mental mockery of the situation. An ancient, musky campesino
singing? It must be symptomatic of the larger rift between the Mexican and American ways of life.
Only weeks later, when Jose Luis Magana Lemus, still unintelligible, asks me to take his only copy of Bernal
Diaz's "Historia verdadera de la conquista de Nueva Espafia" as a gift, do I realize that I should have joined [
in.

singing — softly at first, and then much louder, in a wavering baritone.
Veeeeeeennnnnn acadaddaaaadddaaadcia, moreeeeeeeeeeenaaaaaaaaaaa, he says.

Fantastic, I say.
To be frank, I am ready to leave at this point. I have had my share of sweet tea, and I'm a busy man. Before 10 rolls around. I
have to make a working model of the large intestine from construction paper. I can feel my habitual morning-time exhaustion creep
ing up as our hosts become less and less intelligible. But Sr. Magaha is not done. In fact, his extended family is coming to visit now.,
What is interesting about this plan is that, judging by the family photos I could see from the table, the Magana clan is larger than
most countries' legislative bodies, and Greg and I already take up a substantial portion of our hosts' tiny home.
Heralded by the sound of four white '97 F-150s parking on gravel, approximately 10,000 people enter a room the size of a box
of Chinese takeout. I don't remember their names, these spike-haired, be-poloed city folks who crowd around our calloused host,
showing pictures of their friends to grandpa on their cell phones. There are too many of them, and they are too well dressed. Stand- .
ing room only.

The room is very much filled, I point out to Sra. Magana, who nods.
Her husband begins to sing again.
There is something strange about dining in a complete stranger's home. It is the travel experience condensed
and contained, held in by the stare of the cook and a bowl of corundas. Caught in the press of the Magana blood
line, perpetually massaged by a 60-year-old I cannot for the life of me understand, I can do little more than ac
cept another cup of tea. I am paralyzed by mental mockery of the situation. An ancient, musky campesino
singing? It must be symptomatic of the larger rift between the Mexican and American ways of life.
Only weeks later, when Jose Luis Magana Lemus, still unintelligible, asks me to take his only copy of Bernal

Ever since the age of two, I've gone overseas at least once a year. Granted, that isn't a very
difficult thing to do — I live in Singapore, where it takes about an hour to travel from one

side of the country to the other. Beyond this, I'm bound to find myself crossing a na
tional boundary. But maybe it's the small size of my home city that gave my family the
impetus for travel, something that always occurred during the long months of summer.

I've always been glad for that and, more recently, even more so. As I think about what
comes after university — the daily grind, the short few weeks of leave, high blood pres
sure and work even as you try to holiday in the Bahamas with x number of clients calling
you on your multiple Blackberries — it seems like there's no better time to traverse
HL the world than now.

Finding A Middleman

' As broke college students, there are a few places to get cheap flights. Domestically, I x
there's the well-known Expedia, which can list flights according to prices, duration and departure or arrival
times. For international flights, however, STA Travel is probably the best option. STA has an office in Palo
Alto, and they have rather innovative travel packages, ranging from "Tours-n-Treks" to itineraries that
allow you to travel and volunteer at the same time. Examples include "Surf and Save Sea Turtles" in Costa

Rica. You can also work with orphans or elephants in Argentina and Namibia, respectively. Though 1 haven't tried any of these packages, the range
possibilities present does reflect the popularity of these projects.

Getting There

Depending on your budget, you have a host of airlines to choose from. If you're scrimping, I'd suggest picking the cheapest airline options
on Expedia or STA. You might have three-hour-long layovers, but bring a book, a laptop and a mobile phone, and time will pass in a hurry.
For those not on a budget, however, I'd recommend sampling some good airlines polled from Skytrax (http://www.airlinequality.com). I don't
mean to plug them shamelessly, but Singapore Airlines does come in tops — and that's objectively speaking. I just booked my flight home
l and was quite surprised to see an option that allowed me to pick a meal preference among the broad categories of "child, dietary, oriental
V and seafood, religious, vegetarian," within which there were further subsets. On the flights, there are also entertainment systems that in
\ elude a range of recently released movies (on last count, 25, from all continents), tens of CDs, games, etc. And for the record, I personal-
A ly also dig Cathay Pacific and Emirates.

Deciding Where To (Jo

Europe

W Traveling in Europe is, to put it succinctly, bloody expensive. For example, in 2005, the last time I
* \ was in Great Britain, I couldn't get a decent meal for less than £6(11.67 USD), much less anything
delicious. Still, trips to Europe are worth it for the 18th-century snobby culture that we'd like to be
lieve we absorb. Assuming limitless amounts of cash, I would probably live there.

\ Getting around, however, is easier. Eurorailways provided great service when I commuted between Germany an<
France, and there are hosts of low-cost airlines with special offers that are often a steal. A friend of mine reports having traveled
from London to Madrid and back for a total of £15 (29.14 USD).

Of the Western European countries I've visited, I enjoyed Italy the most. 1 don't think Venice can ever be overrated, however much
praise it already receives, while Assisi, 1 believe, is the most serene place 1 have ever visited. Even though 1 had arrived in the midst of
a wet September, and even though I resembled, for the most part, a drowned rat, everything around me still remained quite beautiful *
and glistening, touched by light.
So if cathedrals, museums and architecture are your thing, bust that wallet out — Europe's for you.
Australia/New Zealand

1 still remember visiting Australia when I was six, being slobbered over by a llama and a couple of sheep and driving around in a car with my parents on a long road trip
to eat oysters. New Zealand was all about the ferry, the blue waters and more sheep. 1 don't think there is much else to say because it's difficult to describe scenery without
it all sounding the same. As much as I loved the bustle of the cities (Sydney being my favorite — sorry, Melbourners!), there is something about this region that's deeply mov
ing and also markedly different — and definitely for the nature people.
Asia

An Asia-obsessed friend once said that part of his fixation came from the region's affordability. I've bought jeans for 150 baht (4.64 USD), jackets for a third of the price
and food for a fraction in Bangkok, Thailand. There are markets in Shanghai with street after street of incredible food, from 5 RMB (0.71 USD) boba tea to an

— amazing Chinese meals for 10 RMB (1.42 USD). Hong Kong too has the small coffee shops where you squeeze shoulder-to-shoulder as you
slurp tossed noodles and drink a porcelain cup of hot coffee.
Part of the thrill is going to a place so unlike anything you will ever see in the West. There are certainly complications associated with the
language barrier, especially in countries like China, Japan and northern Southeast Asia, so it will help if you go with a friend who speaks the na
tive tongue.
Asia, 1 think, is for people who like to try new things, to step out of boundaries, and to shop and eat.
For the undecided

There are still continents that I haven't been to (Africa, South America, Antarctica) and have no room to write about. But perhaps you can just
pick up a NatGeo magazine. Read some travel books. Close your eyes and jab a world map at random. Or perhaps you can find the nearest interna
tional student and hide in his suitcase as summer nears and see where you end up. Whichever way you pick, remember to live it up.

■ We eat breakfast at the first Jose Luis Magana Lemus's house. He is the first Jose Luis Magana Lemus
* because he is much older than the other Jose Luis Magana Lemus, who lives down the street but is not, as

far as we can tell, related. Our host does not find it interesting or surprising that he lives in a town with his doppelganger. Ah
yes, he says to us. "Jose Luis Magana Lemus, down the street. He works with windows.
Gary and I have noticed Sr. Magana before. He is a squat man with a pronounced hunch who speaks from his chest. His lips
are tough and rubbery and seem to suck inwards from lack of teeth. He whistles a lot. With his wife and chickens. Sr. Magana
lives in a ramshackle assortment of structures just across the street from the local clinic and has offered to feed us breakfast, lunch
and dinner today.
Gary and I live and work as volunteers in the town and, consequently, are dependent on its residents to feed us. Up to this
point, we have eaten at, among others:
* Three large, clean, multi-floored houses occupied by lonely women whose husbands and sons are in Nebraska

A kindergarten graduation ceremony
* Several roadside carts specializing in menudo
* A single-room shack with dirt floors occupied by a lady who owns four cats, all of which she hates
* The lopsided home of the local DJ
* Two really bad pizza places.

Sr. Magaiia is probably the least attractive of our hosts so far.
As he lets us into his house, Jose Luis Magaiia Lemus leans in very close, as a way of making us feel welcome. Unfortunately, as he
explains to us. he had tried to beat a marauding skunk away from his chickens with a two-by-four only a few hours earlier. This is per
haps why he smells very much as if he had been sprayed by a skunk. He elaborates a little about the incident as we walk, massaging
my shoulder with great enthusiasm. He mumbles and my Spanish is bad, so the story comes through somewhat garbled: I can make
J out that he hit the animal on the head very hard. He also says, as far as I can tell, that his awning plough is on fire.
His wife waits inside the small, dark kitchen area, with teal walls sparsely featuring crucifixes and unframed photos of family

1 ' members. The floor is covered with sacks of beans and, oddly enough, thick books, bound in wood. The wife immediately informs
us that her husband has recently been sprayed by a skunk. We let her know that we are aware of this, and she nods. She then tells us that her
name is Eusebia Magaiia Magaiia de Magaiia. 1 choke a little bit.
Is something wrong? she asks me.
No, no, but I maybe only have a little somethings in my throat, I reply in my Spanish.
Brushing flies away from the families' bag of week-old pastries and sipping sweet tea, it soon becomes clear that Sr. Magana's habit of
leaning in close to talk is, while disconcerting in that it reveals his spotted gums, necessary if we ever to hope to understand him. His mum
bling is not helped by his tendency to speak while chewing.
[—] a n 0 f y OU [—]? he asks us. We wait for a moment. It becomes clear that there will be no further explanation. I turn to Gary.
Pardon? says Gary.

Good, I say. Very good. This is a dangerous move. I probably should have said "just last week," or maybe "nonprofit organization."

As he lets us into his house, Jose Luis Magaiia Lemus leans in very close, as a way of making us feel welcome. Unfortunately, as he
explains to us. he had tried to beat a marauding skunk away from his chickens with a two-by-four only a few hours earlier. This is per
haps why he smells very much as if he had been sprayed by a skunk. He elaborates a little about the incident as we walk, massaging
my shoulder with great enthusiasm. He mumbles and my Spanish is bad, so the story comes through somewhat garbled: I can make
J out that he hit the animal on the head very hard. He also says, as far as I can tell, that his awning plough is on fire.
His wife waits inside the small, dark kitchen area, with teal walls sparsely featuring crucifixes and unframed photos of family

1 ' members. The floor is covered with sacks of beans and, oddly enough, thick books, bound in wood. The wife immediately informs
us that her husband has recently been sprayed by a skunk. We let her know that we are aware of this, and she nods. She then tells us that her
name is Eusebia Magaiia Magaiia de Magaiia. 1 choke a little bit.
Is something wrong? she asks me.
No, no, but I maybe only have a little somethings in my throat, I reply in my Spanish.
Brushing flies away from the families' bag of week-old pastries and sipping sweet tea, it soon becomes clear that Sr. Magana's habit of
leaning in close to talk is, while disconcerting in that it reveals his spotted gums, necessary if we ever to hope to understand him. His mum
bling is not helped by his tendency to speak while chewing.
[—] a n 0 f y OU [—]? he asks us. We wait for a moment. It becomes clear that there will be no further explanation. I turn to Gary.
Pardon? says Gary.
How, he repeats, does [ — ]?
Good, I say. Very good. This is a dangerous move. I probably should have said "just last week," or maybe "nonprofit organization."
[ — ] i Sr. Magaiia clarifies. I decide that my next response, regardless of his question, will be "Fantastic."
Sr. Magaiia has now realized that we do not understand him and, in an ill-advised attempt to get through to us some other way, has begun
singing — softly at first, and then much louder, in a wavering baritone.
Veeeeeeennnnnn acadaddaaaadddaaadcia, moreeeeeeeeeeenaaaaaaaaaaa, he says.

Fantastic, I say.
To be frank, I am ready to leave at this point. I have had my share of sweet tea, and I'm a busy man. Before 10 rolls around. I
have to make a working model of the large intestine from construction paper. I can feel my habitual morning-time exhaustion creep
ing up as our hosts become less and less intelligible. But Sr. Magaha is not done. In fact, his extended family is coming to visit now.,
What is interesting about this plan is that, judging by the family photos I could see from the table, the Magana clan is larger than
most countries' legislative bodies, and Greg and I already take up a substantial portion of our hosts' tiny home.
Heralded by the sound of four white '97 F-150s parking on gravel, approximately 10,000 people enter a room the size of a box
of Chinese takeout. I don't remember their names, these spike-haired, be-poloed city folks who crowd around our calloused host,
showing pictures of their friends to grandpa on their cell phones. There are too many of them, and they are too well dressed. Stand- .
ing room only.

The room is very much filled, I point out to Sra. Magana, who nods.
Her husband begins to sing again.
There is something strange about dining in a complete stranger's home. It is the travel experience condensed
and contained, held in by the stare of the cook and a bowl of corundas. Caught in the press of the Magana blood
line, perpetually massaged by a 60-year-old I cannot for the life of me understand, I can do little more than ac
cept another cup of tea. I am paralyzed by mental mockery of the situation. An ancient, musky campesino
singing? It must be symptomatic of the larger rift between the Mexican and American ways of life.
Only weeks later, when Jose Luis Magana Lemus, still unintelligible, asks me to take his only copy of Bernal
Diaz's "Historia verdadera de la conquista de Nueva Espafia" as a gift, do I realize that I should have joined [
in.
