## My descent into retail hell 
### AISHA WELLS INTERMISSION CRANKY CLERK 
Out of all the summer work advice
you could possibly receive, this one
will sum it up best: never work in re
tail. Really, there is no job that could
be more exhausting, frustrating and
low paying as folding clothes and then
standing by to watch as people unfold
them all over again. Such dishearten
ing experiences can sometimes incite
the violent nature lurking within.
The summer before college, I had
the displeasure of working in Chica
go's downtown Levi's Store, not real
izing that there were some qualifica
tions — "hipster" and "wear-skinny
jeans-every-day" — I simply did not
have. As if people were not already
overwhelmed by the range of jean op
tions available to them, whoever de
signed this location decided to use
every inch of the store for display,
which ended up being nearly half a
block long. For seven hours, five days
a week, 1 refolded so many jeans that
their dyes began to give my skin an ef
fect reminiscent of brownish-blue
sandpaper. At least some part of
every paycheck was used to find a
more intensive moisturizer.
It's widely believed that retail is
easy because it "only" involves ar
ranging and stacking clothes and
helping inquisitive customers. This
can be true about two percent of the

time. The majority of your day is
spent refolding, sizing and aligning
the same pile of jeans or shirts be
cause, right after you stocked them, a
customer came prancing along (who's
not even really shopping; they're "just
looking"), rifled through them,
stretched every size out against their
body (some guys just want to see if
that dream about them fitting into a
pair of 30-inch jeans had a little truth
to it), threw a couple over a shirt rack,
took six sizes into the changing room,
left them there, came out to get anoth
er pile, and then shot an indignant
"No!" at you when you asked them if
they needed help. Yes, that is the life
of a retailer.
People who have been in retail for
longer than three months are general
ly smart about how to manipulate it in
their favor. They know what shifts to
take, what visual assignments (dress
ing mannequins or assembling store
fronts) are the least or most amount
of work, and what are the best hours
for breaks. My late entry into the mas
sive Levi's Hell meant that I had to
stay late, trying to yank a pair of 501's
over a male mannequin's bulging
crotch or find a belt that fit a girl's 23-
inch waist, take breaks when the
fewest customers were around, and
got the worst shifts: the ones that end
at closing. Not only was I slammed
with a barrage of late-day shoppers,
but dressing rooms — which 1 was

completely responsible for cleaning
— were packed with clothes from
every corner of the store, half of
Chicago was asking me where such
and-such item was, and I usually had
to pee. When the store finally closed
each night, I literally dropped to the
ground and praised whoever was
watching over me for their good
graces. There was no one there to
curse me out for not having a certain
size, no one there to recount stories of
his favorite pair of 501's while I held
two tall stacks of toppling shirts in
each arm — there was no one. Just
me and my other coworkers.
But you didn't think that was the
end, did you? No, no, no — another
aspect of retail most people don't
know about is that your shift isn't over
until the entire store has been replen
ished and cleaned. When you happen
to work at a location rivaling Michael
Jordan's Illinois mansion, that equals
an extra three to four hours of drag
ging your throbbing feet across the
entirety of the store, searching for un
sized stacks and misplaced jackets.
And for what? A rate laughably close
to minimum wage and one that, by
far, under-compensates for your em
ployee "discount." What's 15% any
way? In Chicago, that's basically tax.
This doesn't even take into account
that most brand-name jeans you buy
directly from the retailer make you
collapse into a fit of giggles when you
