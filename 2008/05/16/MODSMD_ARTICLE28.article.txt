## Shredding documents on taxpayer money 
### HEATHER BUCKELEW INTERMISSION CIVIL SERVANT 
During the spring of last year, I had
two main goals for my summer. One
was to make money, and the other
was to do it as close to my parent's
house as humanely possible, it's not
that living in my parent's house is ex
ceptionally comfortable, or that my
mommy makes my bed or anything.
(Note: she doesn't and never has, but
my parents do know how to have a
good time.) I just didn't want to have
to pay expensive rent somewhere. I'd
rather save my money for something
else (i.e., the exorbitant cost of buying
10 books per class as a history major).
So I got a job working for the govern
ment at the now-commercial Air
Force Base about a half-hour bike
ride from my house (which is a five
minute drive).
My first mistake was assuming that

riding a bike would be a responsible
thing to do. Not only is the area
around my house and on the way to
work non-bike friendly — there is
frequently broken glass, cracks in the
road and crazy drivers — but Sacra
mento also hits, on average, 95 de
grees throughout the summer. So not
only did I have to ride my bike in a
dangerous area (where I crashed
three times throughout the summer),
but 1 had to wear "business casual" in
the blistering dry heat of Sacramento.
1 had to recover from heatstroke a
number of times throughout the sum
mer.
This all probably would have been
fine with me if I a) hadn't become a
spoiled brat from living at Stanford,
and b) if my I didn't have the most op
pressively boring and useless job on
the face of the planet.
When I showed up at work, 1 was
expecting it to be menial secretary

kind of work. But 1 didn't consider the
fact that 1 was working for the govern
ment, and not the exciting part of the
government, either. The commis
saries. In Public Affairs. For the
record, I am not anti-military, so I had
no moral objections to this, but the
commissaries are often the best and
only place for the soldiers to shop. So
why we need that much work to be
done in Public Affairs is completely
beyond me, even after the summer. In
fact, I came into my job very gung ho
about it and was told to chill out be
cause it didn't matter whether I got
my work done quickly or not. Some
times I was working on a deadline and
sometimes I wasn't, and typically the
deadline was flexible. I was going to
get paid as long as I showed up on
time.
1 ended up spending most of my
summer shredding documents, sitting
on the phone with Store Directors

(managers for those not in the com
missary business) and trying to figure
out how to make things pretty. This is
not my strong suit.
What I learned from my job is that
the government wastes a lot of money
— on hiring people like me. I feel like
we could probably train monkeys to

shred documents, but, of course, that
would he animal cruelty. Now, admit
tedly 1 have almost no marketable
skills as a history major (except that 1
speak Chinese), so, unlike CS majors,
there is a pretty good chance that 1
will never be hired for what I've been
trained to do.
I thought at first that my job would
be relaxing. No thinking? Shredding
documents? Writing nice PR adver
tisements for something that doesn't
need PR? Sweet, I'm taking a vaca
tion. Instead, 1 learned that I am real
ly awful at vacationing. Hopefully,
this summer will be better, although
it's good to know that the government
will always be willing to use tax dollars
to employ me, no matter how useless
I am.
