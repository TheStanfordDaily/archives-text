## Then she lost me 
### ERIC MESSINGER INTERMISSION CINEMATIC SEEKER 
Art has an ability to make us think that
some characters live, breathe and think be
yond the confines of the things we see
them saying and doing. For me, this is still
impossible to understand, and I'm worried
about exploring it too deeply, as I might
ruin that living quality around my favorite
movie characters. Helen Hunt, however,
could have used more work on the subject
before she went into the director's chair.
"Then She Found Me," directed by and
starring Hunt (along with acting assistance
from Colin Firth, Bette Midler and
Matthew Broderick) follows trying times i
in the life of schoolteacher April Epner
(Hunt). She is newly married to Ben
(Broderick), who splits after months of <
failed attempts to have a baby. The shock i
causes chaos at her job and sends April's ;
adopted mother to the grave, and also |
places her within the eyes of the sympa- i
thetic. divorced Frank (Firth). Left by her |
husband, newly orphaned and dealing with :
an attractive but troubled rebound
prospect, she receives yet another crisis in :
the form of a message from Bernice
Graves (Midler), a local-access TV star

who claims to be her birth moth-

too, making sure that the initial slate of
drama doesn't have to carry the film by it
self. And even as you start to predict, based
on the "what's the worst thing that could
happen to April at this moment?" princi
ple, the plot still manages to keep its share
of surprises while keeping the film from
drowning in misery.
The film achieves this, however, at
great cost. "Then She Found Me" makes
only the most minimal effort toward devel
oping full, rounded characters with the ap
pearance of off-screen lives. April is in
every scene, and the supporting characters
slide onstage, perform their routines and
slide back off. Ben exists as a kind of paro
dy of a passive, neurotic, well-intentioned
husband — not exactly the hardest role for
already passive, nice guy Brodcrick. His
conversations with April follow a recur
ring pattern, and it would be easy to forget
about him if his actions didn't keep having
plot consequences. Frank, too, seems to
end every conversation in the same exas
perated walk-off. Even Midler's Bernice
seems to have no cares besides April, com
ing off as sweet but also giving the creepy
sense that there's nothing else in her life.
The film becomes a series of short act-
features, with April and whomever

sharing their thoughts for four min
utes before the next scene kicks

in. This is not to say that this is
not amusing or moving.

Firth, especially, has a way
frustration and indignation
that fills the film with electric
energy whenever he raises his
voice. Midler plays Bernice
with a strength and unflappa
bility that seem like just what
April needs. And Hunt herself
has lost none of her acting tal
ent or instinct, making April
timid but not pitiful, capable
of speaking up for herself
when she must.
And the exterior-only ap
proach to character also,
bizarrely, assists the film's
pace and plotting. With no

solid grasp on the people we encounter, it's
difficult to anticipate how they will act or
what they will say, and the film can trade
off that tension to keep everything uncer
tain. The scenes' relative independence,
also, partitions the misery, sealing off the
emotional scarring from one scene from
lingering too painfully into the next.
Where this becomes a fatal flaw, however,
is in its central character.
Everything April carries around with
her never seems to take its toll, but she
doesn't seem formidable enough to justify
such resilience. Despite the relentless
focus on April, and Hunt's strong work in
making the audience care about her, who
she is or why she does the things she does
never really comes to the fore. She's obvi
ously confused about the same questions,
but Hunt makes no distinctions between
her character's and the film's perspective
on the world she finds herself in, and,
without access to the thoughts of the per
son we're watching, it's difficult to come
out of a viewing feeling like anything sig
nificant has taken place. And the ending
doesn't help: the film throws up its hands
in defeat and lacks the courage to say why.
"Then She Found Me" winds up feel
ing like a ride on rails at an amusement
park: a trip through cardboard exteriors,
pleasant and sometimes impressive but. in
the end, only making you wonder what's
going on in the back. All kinds of people
find April, sure, but the audience never
gets its chance.
