## Stanford cruises into quaterfinals Cardinal disposes of Clemson, moves on to rematch with Baylor 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Cardinal women kicked off their opening
round of 16 in TLilsa, Okla. with a 4-0 shutout of No. 13
Clemson, perhaps one of the hottest teams in the field.
As if championship tennis wasn't hard enough al
ready, Stanford had to do it before most students on cam
pus even got up.
"Our first challenge was playing a match nine o'clock
central time because that's 7 a.m. for us," head coach Lele
Forood said. "So we worked really hard the last three
days to acclimate to the time schedule here, getting up
and practicing very early."
Indeed, the hard work paid off as the Cardinal women
easily dispatched the Tigers amidst poor weather and a
half hour rain delay.
Clemson entered the tourney on a 12-match win
streak that included key wins against Duke and defend
ing national champion Georgia Tech.
In fact, the Tigers defeated Duke twice, the second
victory earning them an ACC crown.
"We were very aware of how well they had finished
the regular season and how much confidence they had
after beating a couple top-ten teams," Forood said. "We
were extremely aware of them and we were very pre
pared."
As much as the Tigers were rolling, the Cardinal
women were even better.
In doubles, Stanford dominated with wins on courts
two and three.
After a marathon two-hour doubles match against
Texas A&M, senior Celia Durkin and sophomore Car
olyn McVeigh were the first to finish with an 8-3 win.
Senior Whitney Deason and junior Jessica Nguyen
quickly followed with an 8-0 victory to claim the doubles
point.
"That was a good start," Forood said. "We really
steamrolled in the beginning at doubles. That gave us a

5/17 Tulsa, Okla. 9:00 A.M.
GAME NOTES; Clemson was arguably the hottest team in
the country coming into their match against Stanford,
but the Cardinal made quick work of the Tigers and
won 4-0. Stanford freshman Hilary Barte, ranked No.
3 in the country, defeated one of her toughest oppo
nents of the year, No. 2 Ani Mijacika, on Thursday.
Stanford beat Baylor earlier this year by a score of 4-2.

lot of confidence and we went on [to] singles
and had really good performances."
Then in singles came the marquee match
up of No. 3 freshman Hilary Barte against
No. 2 sophomore Ani Mijacika. Both were
28-6 heading into the match.
In the first set, Barte and Mijacika ex
changed break points before Barte pulled
away 6-3.
"Clearly she hasn't played a lot of match
es lately so ... I wouldn't say she's [necessari
ly] at peak form right now," Forood said.
"There was a lot of intrigue to the first set. It
was going on and on, but she was mentally
tougher. That took a little resolve."
Then Barte took over and finished off Mi
jacika for her 29th win of the year, including
her 19th straight as Stanford's number one
player.
"Everyone can see the scoreboard, and
you never know whether that impacted Ani's
effort in the second set," Forood said."Hilary
got more consistent and maybe Ani's resolve
dropped a bit too which led to a quicker sec
ond set. Hilary played pretty smart and won
a lot of key points.''
After McVeigh's 6-3,6-4 win against Lau
rianne Henry and Barte's easy win, it was
only a matter of time before the Cardinal
women advanced to the quarterfinals.
"It was just a matter of seeing who would
finish next," Forood said.
Eventually, sophomore Lindsay Burdette
clinched the match with a 7-5, 6-1 win over
Ina Hadziselimovic.
Despite all the hype around the match,
Stanford easily came away with a win, which
Forood attributes to the team's hard work
since arriving in TUlsa.
"We've had great practices here," Forood
said. "Everyone's done exactly what they've
had to do and we were very well prepared
when we went on court. It showed up in

today's match."
On Saturday, Stanford will square off
against No. 5 Baylor in the quarterfinals.
The two teams met earlier in the season in
the first round of the National Indoors, where
Stanford easily won by the score of 4-2.
"Because we don't play them in the sea
son, it's nice to have played them at the In

doors," Forood said. "We know who they are,
we know what to expect. The familiarity will
be good for us."
Still, much has changed with the Cardinal
lineup since early February, such as having
Barte entrenched at number one.
"Our lineup's a bit different now since in
doors, so there'll be three different match-

Ups in singles," Forood said. "On the other
hand, they have a revenge factor on that side,
but we can't worry about that. All 1 know is
that we can take comfort knowing who they
are."
In fact, with the match slated for 9 a.m PT,
Stanford can take comfort in having no more
early morning matches like the Clemson one.

"If we are able to keep proceeding in the
tournament, we won't have to play early any
more," Forood said.
Beyond that, reclaiming the national title
wouldn't hurt as well.

Stanford relied on a number of players in both doubles and singles play to defeat a streaking Clemson team and looks to keep that consistency intact against a tough Baylor squad.
