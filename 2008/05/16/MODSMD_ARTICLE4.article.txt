# Card leads off in NCAAs
## Stanford faces Lehigh to begin the Amherst Regional 
### DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford softball team travels to
the Amherst Regional at the University
of Massachusetts this weekend to take
part in the three-day double elimination
first round of the NCAA tournament.
Despite being the top seed in the re
gion and the 12th overall seed in the
tournament, the Cardinal (46-12) was
forced to travel cross-country to try and
prolong its season.
The other three teams in the region
are the second-seeded University of
Massachusetts, the third-seeded Prince
ton Tigers and the fourth-seeded
Lehigh Mountain Hawks.
Stanford opens play today against
the Mountain Hawks.
The Cardinal enters the weekend
with a 46-12 record on the year but in a
bit of a rut of late, having lost the last
two games of the season to Arizona by a
combined score of 14-1.
These losses not only dropped the
Cardinal into fourth place in the Pacific
-10 Conference but also likely prevented
Stanford from hosting a regional.
Nonetheless, head coach John
Rittman is excited about traveling
across the country for the regional.
"This is a great opportunity to see a
different part of the country and play

teams we don't typically get to play," he
said.
Of the three other teams in the tour
nament, the Cardinal has only faced
Princeton this season, beating them 10-
0 in five innings in March as part of the
Stanford Invitational 11.
The team has yet to face the Moun
tain Hawks, who earned an automatic
bid to the NCAA tournament by win
ning the Patriot League. They enter the
game with a 38-15-1 record on the sea
son and are led by Lisa Sweeney, who is
both their ace pitcher and best hitter.
Sweeney holds a 25-4 record in the
circle with a 1.54 ERA. She also is hit
ting .416 with 13 homeruns and 36 RBIs.
If the Cardinal defeats Lehigh it will
move into the winner's side of the
bracket and take on the victor of the
UMass and Princeton match-up for a
chance to get to the regional title game.
The Minutemen — the champions
of the Atlantic-10 conference — earned
an automatic bid to the tournament.
They enter the regional with a prolific
29-game winning streak. The Minute
men are certainly a dangerous team, as
they upset then-No. 2 Texas A& M earli
er in the year.
Brandice Balschmi has been domi
nar' \n the circle all year for UMass. She
has "powered hitters to the tune of a
28-6 re«.„rd and a miniscule 0.54 ERA

on the year.
UMass's opening round opponent,
Princeton, is the champion and auto
matic qualifier from the Ivy League.lTie
Tigers enter the tournament with a 25-
22 record on the year.
Princeton is led by a trio of hitters:
Kelsey Quist who is hitting .358 with 13
homeruns and 37 RBIs, Jamie Lettire
who is hitting .352 with 14 homeruns
and 40 RBIs and Kathryn Welch who is
hitting .345 with 13 homeruns and 35
RBIs.
Despite the traveling and the
strength of the region, anything but a
championship this weekend would be
disappointing for the Cardinal, who has
its eyes set on a much bigger prize: the
national championship.
"We're definitely in a position to
make it to the World Series, as long as
we play our game. When it comes to
winning a national championship, at
some point you're going to have to play
and beat some very good teams," senior
third baseman Michelle Smith told
GoStanford.com.
"You're going to have to beat quality
opponents, you're going to have to win
on the road," said Rittman. "It starts
right here in the UMass Regional."
