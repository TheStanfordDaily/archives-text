## Janitors consider striking Workers threaten to walk out unable to negotiate a living wage with contracting employer 
### ANNALISE BLUM 
A local union of Stanford janitors met
Wednesday to consider striking if their
demands for a living wage are not met by
ABM Janitorial Services, an outside contrac
tor that supplies workers to the University.
Stanford hires 132 janitors through ABM
who are part of the local branch of the
Service Employees International Union,
known as Local 717. The workers' five-year
contract with ABM expired on April 30. and
since then the janitors have been in a state of
limbo as their union and ABM negotiate for
the next contract.
Under the former contract, the workers'
wages increased by a total of $1 over five
years. ABM's starting offer in current con

tract renegotiations was a five-year contract
with a wage increase of 10 cents each year.
ABM also indicated that, because of increas
ing cost of Medicare, they may no longer
provide the workers with health insurance.
"The cost of living in this area increases a
lot," said Imar Liborio, who addressed the
lecture hall full of fellow janitors dressed in
matching grey ABM t-shirts. "Ten cents
more each year is not enough."
The janitors are hoping to obtain a wage
equal to the living wage paid to other
Stanford workers. Following a hunger strike
led by the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SI.AC) last year. Stanford agreed to pay
most of its workers the living wage.
This policy, however, excludes these
unionized workers.

These workers are hoping that ABM's
next offer will be more generous. If not, they
are looking to Stanford to make up the dif
ference and ensure that they are paid a more
generous wage.
Local 717 held a "Justice for Janitors"
rally at Stanford on April 30. Over a hundred
Stanford janitors and students marched
through the quad and into White Plaza
demanding higher wages, health care and
more rights.
A similar rally was held the next day at
Google's campus in Mountain View. Google
soon after agreed to pay all of its workers
hired through ABM a living wage even if
their contractor refuses to do so. Genentech,
another Silicon Valley company, has
announced it will do the same.

"Other companies like Google have
already done this," Liborio explained last
night. "Stanford has more money. And, there
are people who are on both the Google and
the Stanford Board."
If these workers decide not to accept
ABM's final offer, janitors will opt to strike if
Stanford does not provide an agreeable sub
stitute offer.
Doroteo Garcia, a janitor in the Cantor
Arts Center who was featured in a 2005 New
York Times article, implored the workers
assembled to join in should there be a strike.
"If we don't push the companies," Garcia
explained, "they will do what they want. It is
ridiculous and unjust. If you don't go, it's on
your conscience — you need to fight for us
all. But if we all join in the struggle, everyone

will benefit."
A young woman with red-tinted hair
spoke up.
"What about the people who don't
strike?" she asked. "I will strike because 10
cents is an embarrassment. But what about
people who can't support the strike?"
Liborio didn't hesitate.
"People who go against a strike have 10
days to leave the union," Liborio said. "If you
want to continue with the wages you current
ly get, you agree to only survive, not to live."
"We are janitors." Liborio said. "But we
have dignity. We need to fight for that dig
nity."
