## Senate endorses IHUM Faculty make no major changes to curriculum 
### BEN EPPLER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) will remain a core element
of the freshman academic experi
ence for the foreseeable future,
according to a committee report
delivered to the Faculty Senate yes
terday afternoon.
The report, the result of a ten
year review by the Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy, recommend
ed no immediate change to the sta
tus of the Area One requirement
for undergraduate education, which
is currently fulfilled by IHUM or,
for a few freshmen. Structured
Liberal Education.
Speaking on behalf of the com
mittee, Electrical Engineering Prof.
Brad Osgood told the Senate that
the IHUM program was "doing
very well," and that the Committee
"does not believe that there should
be a revamp at this time."
"We have a program that's
working well," agreed IHUM
Director Russell Berman, a profes
sor of comparative literature and
German studies.
Both Berman and Osgood noted
that although they were not recom
mending 1 HUM's overhaul, they
were optimistic about the prospect
of experimentation in some IHUM
courses, a decision which was
approved by the Senate earlier this
year.
"It remains a work in progress,"
Berman said.
He cited smaller lecture sizes,
greater involvement with the arts
and "soft" three quarter sequences
as proposals for .some new IHUM
courses. Unlike the current model,
which offers one interdisciplinary
quarter of IHUM in the fall and a

two-quarter, department-specific
sequence in the winter and spring,
the three quarter sequence would
link one discipline across the entire
freshman year. Students would be
able to opt in and out freely after
fall quarter of the course.
While several Senators compli
mented IHUM on its longevity and
success, a few expressed dismay at
what they saw as the review's lack
of scrutiny of the program.
"I'm sorry to say that I'm disap
pointed the report was so thin,"
said History Prof. Philippe Buc.
"We have to know what we're
doing, if we're asking kids to spend
one third to one fourth of their
time in this program. In terms of
monitoring, this is not the docu
ment I wanted to see."
"I do want to urge us to have a
discussion of the intellectual
rationale for the area one require
ment and whether we think the
current way we have of satisfying it
is the right way," added Philosophy
Prof. Debra Satz. "I took it that the
ten year review was partly to force
us to ask those questions." .
The report did acknowledge
that a review of the area one
requirement may need to take

place in the future.
"Conditions that would man
date significant changes in our
undergraduate requirements of the
sort that have brought such
changes (n the past have not yet
risen to the point where a major
overhaul of the curriculum is
required, but the outline of such
conditions are discernible," the
report read.
Such a review remains at least
two years in the future. Provost
John Etchemendy and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Greg Boardman proposed conven
ing a task force on undergraduate
curriculum in fall 2010.
The recommendations of that
task force would not be implement
ed until the following year at the
very earliest, so IHUM is set to stay
for the foreseeable future.
"I'd like to congratulate the
IHUM program," said Law Prof.
Hank Greely. "Of the three prede
cessor programs, not one of them
lasted more than 12 years, and it
looks like IHUM is going to beat
that."
