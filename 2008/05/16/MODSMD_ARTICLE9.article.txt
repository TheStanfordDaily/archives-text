## Cancer Society CEO warns against tobacco pandemic 
### JULIANNE STERN 
In the twentieth century, tobacco was
causally linked to one hundred million
deaths globally. And. without intervention, it
will kill one billion people this century,
according to John Seffrin. Chief Executive
Officer of the American Cancer Society, who
spoke at the Medical School on Thursday
afternoon.
Seffrin said that in industrialized nations
like the United States and Canada, where
markets for tobacco are already saturated,
the number of deaths linked to tobacco will
likely remain stable over the next century.
Most of the increase in the death rate will
come from developing countries like China
and India. Seffrin said.
"The developing world will shoulder the
bulk of tobacco deaths in the coming centu
ry," Seffrin said.
China and India are home to about forty
percent of the world's 1.3 billion smokers,
according to Seffrin. Globally, about one
third of people 15 years or older are smokers.
"The tobacco industry is spreading its
tentacles to every part of the globe." Seffrin
said.
For many parts of the world, the most
severe consequences of what Seffrin called a
"tobacco pandemic" are still to come.
Seffrin said that in most countries, tobac
co use can be mapped to a one-hundred-year
cycle. Generally, the number of smokers
peaks at around fifty years. Only later in the
cycle — at about seventy-five years — does
the number of tobacco-related deaths begin
to climb steeply.
While nations like the United States and
Canada are near the end of this cycle, South
America and some parts of Asia, including
China, are still in the beginning stages of the
cycle — most tobacco-related deaths arc still
to come.
"Tobacco is already the number one

cause of preventable deaths in the United
States," Seffrin said. "By 2030. if we don't
act, it will be the number one cause of death
worldwide."
China alone could face one million tobac
co-related deaths per year by 2030.
"No country has ever had one million
lung cancer deaths a year," Seffrin said in an

interview with The Daily. "If that happens, it
will raise any number of public health, polit
ical and social issues."
Seffrin had harsh words for the tobacco
industry, calling tobacco "the world's great
est weapon of mass destruction."
"It will kill 600 million people alive today
in the world if we don't actSeffrin said.
Seffrin emphasized that the potential
spike in tobacco-related deaths would have
costs beyond human suffering. For many
countries, including China, tobacco-related
illnesses would severely strain an already
inadequate healthcare infrastructure.
"At the height of the epidemic fin the
United States], we had maybe 160,000
deaths a year," Seffrin said. "It brought our

John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, called
tobacco "the world's greatest weapon of mass destruction," predicting that it
could kill as many as 600 million people alive today if no action is taken.
