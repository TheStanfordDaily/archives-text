## M.A. programs discussed, debated Many students seek higher credentials 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The number of students earning
master's degrees nationwide has dou
bled since 1980, and grown by 150 per
cent since 1970, according to The New
York Times, with degrees in business
and education seeing the biggest
jumps.
As undergraduates compete heav
ily to distinguish themselves, particu
larly in a tight job market, many
Stanford students look to pursue a
master's or co-terminal master's
degree.
Not all departments at Stanford
with graduate programs offer master's
degrees. Fewer offer co-terminal pro
grams, which provide opportunities
for Stanford undergraduates to earn a
master's degree on the Farm concur
rently with or directly following their
undergraduate degree.
Several department chairs pointed to
the possibilities of the programs as a
way for students to explore their field
of study further.
"I think [co-term programs] have
some neat possibilities," said
Chemistry Department Chair
Richard Zare. "I'm always interested
in them as an interesting stepping
stone to other things."
"It lets students get their feet wet,"
said Department of Communication
Chair James Fishkin. "A student can
explore and think about his or her
options... A co-term is a way of
broadening your experience," he
added.
But departments discourage seek
ing the degree purely out of a desire to
resume-pad.
"We have some excellent students
who have done much of our [under
graduate] program and reached grad
level coursework." said Department
of Classics Chair Richard Martin in an
email to The Daily. "They are intellec
tually strong and deserve the chance
to get an advanced degree. There are
always a few, however, who have less
interest in the field but just can't give
up the habit (Stanford-induced) of
picking up all the glittering prizes
within reach, or who think it looks
nice on a CV. We like to believe we
discourage those types."
"We will, starting next year, be
ratcheting up our entry requirements
for the co-term to make sure we get
the most serious intellectuals out
there," he added.
Co-terminal and master's pro
grams also provide an opportunity for
interdisciplinary work, with many
undergraduates choosing to pursue
special opportunities offered by such
programs.
"There is a master's degree pro
gram in financial math: this is an inter
departmental program run jointly
with statistics," said Department of
Mathematics Chair Rafe Mazzeo in

an email to The Daily. "This program
is booming and attracts more and
more students, but these are usually
coming to Stanford just for this pro
gram. Financial math programs of this
sort are a very good way to launch a
career in the financial industry; stu
dents typically go from this directly to
work in hedge fund divisions of banks,
etc."
Students often choose to complement
their undergraduate degrees with co
terminal master's programs in a relat
ed discipline.
"Since communications is so inher
ently interdisciplinary in the way we
approach it, it makes sense for people
coming from other disciplines."
Fishkin said. "That can be political sci
ence, or psychology, or even computer
science, and it provides an additional
period of study."
In many fields, however, students
are encouraged to skip master's
degrees, and move into a Ph.D. pro
gram.
"We rarely accept any master's stu
dents, co-terms or otherwise," said
Department of Linguistics Chair Tom
Wasow in an email to The Daily. "We
let our undergraduates know that an
M.A. in Linguistics really isn't worth
much more than [a B. A.] We tell them
that if they want to go on to a Ph.D.
program, they should do it without
doing the M.A. first."
But obtaining financial aid can be
difficult for master's students. Ph.D.
programs commonly provide financial
assistance for students in exchange for
teaching and other assistance, which
allows spending additional years
studying to be financially feasible.
Students in master's programs, how
ever, typically do not receive aid from
departments, and no longer qualify for
the financial aid they received as
undergraduates.
"Co-term students are eligible for
undergraduate funding through 12
quarters of enrollment," said Director
of Financial Aid Karen Cooper in an
email to The Daily. "Once they are in
their 13th quarter they are considered
to be master's students. Graduate stu
dents are independent — parent
income is not considered — but only
loans are available from the Financial
Aid Office."
"We don't have any financial aid
for master's students," Wasow added.
"The high cost to the students is one
reason we discourage them from pur
suing the M.A."
In looking at alternatives to a mas
ter's program, Zare suggested explor
ing their intellectual interest further
while still an undergraduate.
"People are always trying to collect
all sorts of distinctions," Zare said.
"What really matters is what people
say about you and what you actually
do. I think a really great honors thesis
can often tell you more about a per
son."
"But not everyone agrees with
me," he added.
