## Editorial Board Forgive med school loans 
### 
Last month was Stanford's School of
Medicine Match Day, a celebration
where soon-to-be-graduates learned
with which medical residency programs they
had been paired.
Ihese graduates are faced with a difficult
decision regarding which medical field to
enter, and an increasing number of top medical
students around the country are applying to
residencies in dermatology and cosmetic sur
gery.'lhese fields offer lucrative pay and regu
lar hours Many cosmetic procedures are not
covered by insurance, allowing doctors to ask
for money up-front without having to tussle
with insurance companies.
Meanwhile, critical fields like geriatrics, a
specialization in care for the elderly, and inter
nal medicine, which cares for adults, are facing
growing physician shortages. Much of this
shortage can be blamed on less-attractive
hours and salaries. Many seniors are covered
by Medicare and Medicaid, which in some
cases provide skimpy reimbursements for
•medical care. This in turn drives down the
salaries of those physicians who choose to care
for the nation's poorest, weakest and most
infirm citizens. And as the shortage of these
primary-care physicians worsens, these deb
tors have to put in longer and longer work
weeks to fulfill their expanding caseloads.
As Dr. Eric Parlette, a dermatologist in
Massachusetts, said in an interview with The
New York Times in March: "It is an unfortu
nate circumstance that you can spend an hour
with a patient treating them for diabetes and
hypertension and make $ 1 (X). or you can do
Botox and make $2,000 in the same [amount
of] time." Ile said he chose his field because he
wanted to perform procedures like skin can
cer surgery and cosmetic treatments while
keeping regular hours and earning a reward
ing salary.
Troublingly, top graduates of top medical
schools are effectively discouraged from
entering primary care.This worsens America's
primary-care physician shortage, and as
•America's population continues to age, the
demand for primary-care physicians will con
tinue to grow.
But Stanford's School of Medicine can do
something to stop this vicious cycle — by for
giving loans for graduates who enter these cru

rial fields. While the School is at it.it should go
even further by instituting a loan forgiveness
program for those graduates entering public
service and also for those serving underserved
areas.
Graduates of Stanford's School of
Medicine emerge saddled in debt; as Dr.
Charles Prober, an administrator at the med
ical school, told The Daily last week, the aver
age indebtedness of graduating students is
pegged at $78,000. While this figure is quite
low compared to most medical schools, and
the national average of over $ 150,000, it is sub
stantial enough to sway many graduates'
career decisions. A loan forgiveness program
would give Stanford School of Medicine grad
uates a real incentive to enter the career paths
that they feel are most fulfilling, not just those
that are most lucrative.
A similar, successful system is in place at
Stanford's Graduate School of Business
(GSB). where for each year a student works at
a non-profit (or in some circumstances, an
international organization in a developing
country), a portion of their outstanding loans
is paid for by the GSB.
The School of Education announced this
year that it is partnering with the Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowship Program to pro
vide generous $30,000 annual stipends to top
students who opt to teach at needy secondary
schools.
And Stanford Law School announced last
month that it will be expanding its long-stand
ing loan forgiveness program for graduates
making less than $100,000 a year. As The Daily
reported in April, some public defender and
non-profit positions have annual salaries of as
little as $50,000 a year, scanty compared to the
six-figure entry-level salaries available in pri
vate law practice.
But Stanford's School of Medicine is con
spicuously absent from the list of Stanford's pro
fessional schools offering commendable loan
forgiveness initiatives Last week, the Editorial
Board commended Dean Philip Pizzo and
Stanford's School of Medicine for banning gifts
from pharmaceutical companies, This week, it
urges the medical sch(x>l to join the trend of
loan forgiveness. Stanford's School of Medicine
ought to reward its graduates who enter under
served professions and communities.
