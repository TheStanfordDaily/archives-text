## The 						millennium of mayhem 
### 
Remember the Y2K hug? Back when
we were partying like it was 1999
because it was 1999, we were also
greatly concerned that mass disaster would
accompany the dawn of the new millennium.
Things were looking bad — those silly com
puter programmers forgot to tell their
machines that space-time in the fourth
dimension is bigger and longer than ninety
nine years. All the worlds computers, it was
foretold, would assume it was 19(X) at the
stroke of midnight and majorly freak out.
Luckily, the crisis was averted. Whether the
computers were fixed in time or the problem
was just alarmist hype, everyone breathed a
global sigh of relief on Jan. I,2(XX) and moved
on with their lives.
1 hate to be a grump. but 1 can't help but
note that despite our sweet, sweet victory
over the Y2K bug, the third millennium has
kind of sucked so far. We kicked things off by
losing all of our money in the dot-com bub
ble, and then we proceeded to accidentally
elect a barely literate man to the White
House. We suffered a horrific terrorist attack
in New York soon after, which spawned an
ongoing military mess in Iraq and an ongoing
architectural mess in Manhattan. We acciden
tally elected that barely literate man to a sec
ond term. Hurricane Katrina destroyed New
Orleans, a tsunami destroyed Phuket,
Thailand and as Al Gore recently let us know,
we are destroying what remains of the earth
by burning up all of our resources and coat
ing the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.
And of course, most recently, Myanmar was
devastated by Cyclone Nargis, and China by
the Sichuan earthquake.
What's the deal? It might be that I hap
pened to become news conscious right
around the year 2(XX) (in fact, that's definite
ly the case). Still, it seems that an improbable
amount of tragedy is suddenly upon us. I've
heard that some people say that all these
events are precursors to an imminent, total
apocalypse. Some of the more reasonable
types just think that God is mad at us, for
being gay or for living in a red state or some
thing. (Have you seen that map of Florida
'with hurricane tracks superimposed on the
red-blue voting districts? It's both interesting
and very tasteless). And 1 recently learned
that there are even some crazies who think
academics are fabricating all of these disas
ters in order to acquire research grant money.
Those of us who don't believe in God and
who aren't crazy are stuck blaming global
warming, Karl Rove and probability theory.
The truth is that we can't identify the reason

why all these bad things are happening.
There's nothing like catastrophe to bring out
the amateur philosopher in us all.
In a recent seminar on risk assessment, a
visiting speaker brought up a provocative
point: perhaps it is irresponsible of engineers
to work to make buildings perform safely in
earthquakes or to prevent coastal cities from
flooding in hurricanes. By making life possi
ble in inherently dangerous regions, we are
implicitly encouraging people to take more
risks than are necessary. And as technology
advances, the problem only grows worse —
now, we are not only building in seismic
regions, but we're building tall, and we're
building a lot. In some sense, this only adds to
the economic and physical destruction that
occurs when disaster strikes.
Of course, as my professor noted the next
day in class, such thinking is a perilously slip
pery slope. Following along the same logic,
we might conclude that doctors shouldn't
research fatal genetic diseases, which teeters
just a tad too close to social Darwinism for
my taste. And anyway, as I forgot to mention
in my list of mayhem, we're also suffering a
population crisis. If we restrict living to disas
ter-free areas only, we'll have to invent better
deodorant and redefine the personal space
bubble radius to negative seven inches.
Still, this doesn't mean that engineering
shouldn't check its ethics barometer once in a
while, or that the public shouldn't be urged to
modify unnecessarily hazardous behavior.
Responsibility entails addressing the problems
of the masses, like inadequate housing or
hunger, without creating further problems, like
mass nuclear exodus or carbon emissions. At
the same time, it requires that we foresee and
prevent future problems to the greatest practi
cal extent. We can't keep people from living in
seismic regions, but we can try to restrict their
building heights. We can't keen people from
burning fossil fuels, but we can provide incen
tives to use less. Indeed, deciding which prob
lems to solve and which to merely avoid is one
of the trickiest challenges of engineering, but it
is also the most fundamental.
