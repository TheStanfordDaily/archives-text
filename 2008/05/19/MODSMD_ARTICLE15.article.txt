						haiku: adieu. 
### 
Sick of writing prose
and you, sick of reading it,
shall we now haiku?
don't count the syllables
some of these rebel —
more like Kerouac than Basho.
too hot to think.
summer time, and the living is
sticky.
new freckles on my arm,
an everyday constellation
thank you. Sun.
legs float freely when
I'm in a dress,
skirting around you
licking away at popsicles
looking for childhood
joke's not funny anymore
if I wedge an orange peel
into your smile
will you be happy like this forever?
wrap around me like a porch
I will rest upon your limbs
and drink lemonade.
summer dreams drift in
through open windows.
Hot.
here is my yearbook:
I hope you can write more than
"Have a good summer."
even when time slows down.
it's still going too fast
slipping through my fingers, crushed silk.
packing my room in boxes.
will you fit between
the pencils and the poetry books?
Dear Reader:
Sorry for being so short—
figuratively, that is.
