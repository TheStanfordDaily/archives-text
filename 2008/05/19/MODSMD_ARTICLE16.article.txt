## CARD FALLS IN QUARTERS 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After enduring one of its more difficult
seasons in recent memory, the No. 4 Stanford
women's tennis team fell 4-1 to No. 5 Baylor
at the quarterfinals of the 2008 NCAA Cham
pionships.
Though their title run was cut short, the
Cardinal women had no excuses in defeat.
"I'm proud of us," freshman Hilary Barte
said. "We had a rollercoaster season with our
ups and downs but we fought hard. 1 think the
better team won yesterday."
Baylor only has two losses on the season
— one of them came vs. Stanford at the Na
tional Indoors early in the season.
After avenging that loss with Saturday's
upset, the Bears may have become the team
to beat as the tournament goes forward.
"We played them at Indoors so we knew
they were a tough team." Barte said. "It was
definitely disappointing that we lost, but we
lost to a tough team."
With the loss, Stanford finishes the season
22-5, the five losses being the most since 1983.
Had all of the matches been played on the
Farm, the results may have been different. All
five losses came on the road or at neutral sites.
Despite being an NCAA game, though.
Saturday's match was anything but neutral
for the Cardinal.
For the second straight season, homecourt
advantage appeared to play a role in Stan
ford's fall. A large contingency of Baylor fans
came out to the match making the near 400-
mile trek to Tulsa. Okla. from Waco. Tex.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
5/1 7 Baylor L 4-1
GAME NOTES; Stanford beat Baylor earlier in the season,
but the Bears came back and dominated the Cardinal
in the NCAA Quarterfinals this weekend, breaking a
10-year semifinal streak for Stanford. Lindsay Burdette
won the Cardinal's only point at No. 4 singles as Baylor
took advantage of a partisan crowd and a blister for
Stanford No. 1 Hilary Barte to run away with the match
and knock Stanford out of contention for a third NCAA
Championship in four years.

Unfortunately for the Card, their presence
was certainly felt.
"They were a little obnoxious and rude,"
Barte said of the Baylor fans. "When we were
playing doubles, they would clap when Whit
ney missed a first serve, which obviously is not
classy."
Still, there would be no excuses for this
Cardinal squad — a sure sign of maturity
after a tumultuous season.
"I can't blame them — it's college tennis,"
Barte added. "It's just part of the game."
Ultimately, the stars simply weren't
aligned for Stanford during the 2008 cam
paign.
Despite losing on court one in doubles.
Stanford held leads of 5-2 and 7-4 on courts
two and three.
Though senior Celia Durkin and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh won 8-6 at court three, sen
ior Whitney Deason and junior Jessica
Nguyen fell 9-7 in a heartbreaking match.

Already down 1-0 in the match, the Cardi
nal women couldn't pull another come-from
behind win out of their hat.
"1 don't want to say it set the tone, but it af
fected me more than 1 probably should have
let it," Barte said."The point could've gone ei
ther way. Against UCLA, we lost the doubles
point and won the match. We just had to re
mind ourselves to find a way to get it done."
To make matters worse. Barte developed a
blister on her left thumb playing against the
2(X)5 NCAA singles champion, three-time
All-American and four-time Big 12 Player of
the Year Zuzana Zemenova.
The freshman would fall 6-4, 6-2 for her
first dual-match loss at the number one spot.
Barte was also denied her 30th win of the sea
son, finishing 29-7 with NCAA Individuals
left to go.

Barte was disappointed about the timing
and location of the injury.
"[The blister] was right on my thumb and 1
could feel it on every shot," Barte said. "I
couldn't really play my game, but 1 did every
thing I could and I guess it wasn't enough."
Despite sophomore Lindsay Burdette's 6-
2,6-2 win at the number four spot, the Card
would eventually drop the next two points
and the match.
Though many of the Cardinal women
have a chance to avenge this year's loss, the
match was an abrupt end to the Stanford ca
reers of three seniors: Deason, Durkin and
Lejla 1 iodzic.
With two titles already under their belts,
the three were denied a third and final crown.
"It was kind of bittersweet for them."
Barte said. "I was proud of them. They did a

great job fighting and had great careers here."
For the individual tournament, Barte,
Nguyen and Burdette remain in Tulsa to try to
extend their season after bidding farewell to
the rest of their teammates on Sunday.
"My teammates left today that aren't play
ing in the individuals," Barte said."lt's heart
breaking to see them go down like that. We
fought hard, but it's disappointing to leave in
the quarterfinals."
In spite of the loss, the Cardinal women's
spirits remained indomitable.
"It was a tough loss and it hurts, but we're
all excited to get back out there and prepare
for next season and bring that title back to the
Farm," Barte finished.

Still, there would be no excuses for this
Cardinal squad — a sure sign of maturity
after a tumultuous season.
"I can't blame them — it's college tennis,"
Barte added. "It's just part of the game."
Ultimately, the stars simply weren't
aligned for Stanford during the 2008 cam
paign.
Despite losing on court one in doubles.
Stanford held leads of 5-2 and 7-4 on courts
two and three.
Though senior Celia Durkin and freshman
Carolyn McVeigh won 8-6 at court three, sen
ior Whitney Deason and junior Jessica
Nguyen fell 9-7 in a heartbreaking match.

Already down 1-0 in the match, the Cardi
nal women couldn't pull another come-from
behind win out of their hat.
"1 don't want to say it set the tone, but it af
fected me more than 1 probably should have
let it," Barte said."The point could've gone ei
ther way. Against UCLA, we lost the doubles
point and won the match. We just had to re
mind ourselves to find a way to get it done."
To make matters worse. Barte developed a
blister on her left thumb playing against the
2(X)5 NCAA singles champion, three-time
All-American and four-time Big 12 Player of
the Year Zuzana Zemenova.
The freshman would fall 6-4, 6-2 for her
first dual-match loss at the number one spot.
Barte was also denied her 30th win of the sea
son, finishing 29-7 with NCAA Individuals
left to go.

Barte was disappointed about the timing
and location of the injury.
"[The blister] was right on my thumb and 1
could feel it on every shot," Barte said. "I
couldn't really play my game, but 1 did every
thing I could and I guess it wasn't enough."
Despite sophomore Lindsay Burdette's 6-
2,6-2 win at the number four spot, the Card
would eventually drop the next two points
and the match.
Though many of the Cardinal women
have a chance to avenge this year's loss, the
match was an abrupt end to the Stanford ca
reers of three seniors: Deason, Durkin and
Lejla 1 iodzic.
With two titles already under their belts,
the three were denied a third and final crown.
"It was kind of bittersweet for them."
Barte said. "I was proud of them. They did a

great job fighting and had great careers here."
For the individual tournament, Barte,
Nguyen and Burdette remain in Tulsa to try to
extend their season after bidding farewell to
the rest of their teammates on Sunday.
"My teammates left today that aren't play
ing in the individuals," Barte said."lt's heart
breaking to see them go down like that. We
fought hard, but it's disappointing to leave in
the quarterfinals."
In spite of the loss, the Cardinal women's
spirits remained indomitable.
"It was a tough loss and it hurts, but we're
all excited to get back out there and prepare
for next season and bring that title back to the
Farm," Barte finished.

The Stanford women's tennis team has been to the NCAA semifinals every year since 1998, but a 4-1 quarterfinal loss to Baylor will keep the
2008 edition of the squad out of the next round. The Cardinal was trying to win its third team championship in the last four years.
