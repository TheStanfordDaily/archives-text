# Golf tees off at West Regionals
## Sixth-place finish earns Card a berth at championship 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's golf team will
return to the NCAA Championships this year
to defend its title after taking the sixth-place
spot in the NCAA West Regional Tournament
this weekend in Bremerton. Wash.
The Cardinal shot a 14-over par, 878 over
all, and had its best showing in the final round,
posting a three-under 285 on the day which se
cured the team's NCAA berth.
"We're really excited to qualify for
NCAAs," Stanford head coach Conrad Ray
said. "You just need one good week to win it
all. It is good to have a chance to play and look
at the teams who weren't able to qualify be
cause it really makes you appreciate being
able to be at the finals. We played great in
Washington and the guys really stepped up
when they needed to."
The Pacific-10 Conference will be well rep
resented at the Championships in West
Lafayette, Ind. Six of eight teams finished in
the top ten at Regionals to qualify for their
tournament spots.
The qualifying Pac-10 teams include No. 2
Southern California, which won the Regional,
and No. 48 Oregon, which came in second
place; Washington, No. 4 UCLA and Stanford
finished in the fourth through six spots.

Rounding out the Pac-10 qualifiers was No. 29
Arizona State, which ended up in eighth place.
Freshman Sihwan Kim played a key role in
Stanford earning its NCAA bid by taking fifth
place on the individual ladder. He was only
one stroke behind a three-way tie for second.
Kim got all of his postseason jitters out in the
first and second rounds, posting a one-over 73
and a one-under 71. The freshman then pulled
out of all of the stops in the final round,
recording eight birdies on the day for a four
under 68.
Kim's furious finish propelled him from a
tie for 19th place to a top-five finish.
Just one stroke behind Kim was senior Rob
Grube, who also was a big contributor to the
low Cardinal score. Grube claimed a share of
the sixth place spot, posting a three-under 213
for the tournament.
Like Kim, Grube posted consistent first
and second round scores, recording a one
under 71 and a one-over 73. For his last Re
gional match, Grube finished strong, posting a
three-under 69 on the final day of the tourna
ment which helped him jump six spots to sixth

place in the individual tournament.
"Both Sihwan [Kim] and Rob [Grube]
played phenomenally in the final nine holes,"
Ray said. "At the turn of the final round, we
were about a shot in or out and it was great to
see them hit 31 and 32 to make three and four
under par.
"It was pretty amazing to see them step up
because within an hour we went from maybe
being able to qualify to being in great shape,"
Ray continued. "Both guys have the ability to
win every time they play. The leaders of the
team have to step up and they have been our
team leaders all year."
Junior Dodge Kemmer, like his fellow
teammates, had his best showing in the final
round, which launched him to the 57th spot in
the individual ranks. Kemmer started the
weekend with a four-over 76 and a five-over
77, but he cut down his score significantly in
the final round with a one-over 73 for the day.
Sophomore Jordan Cox finished just one
stroke behind his junior counterpart and fin
ished with a cumulative 11-over score of 227,
putting him in a tie for 63rd place.

GAME NOTES: Stanford got fifth- and sixth-place individual
finishes from freshman Sihwan Kim and senior Rob Grvbe,
who shot 212 (-4) and 213 (-3) respectively. Kim finished
just behind a three-way tie for second place and propelled
the Cardinal back to the NCAA Championships, which the
team won last year. Stanford is one of six Fbc-10 teams
that will be heading to Indiana in two weekends.

Rounding out the Cardinal five was fresh
man Steve Ziegler, who had a 15-over 231 for
the tournament. Ziegler also played his best
round on the final day of the tournament,
posting a three-over 75 for the day.
This was Stanford's first taste of the high
level of competition at NCAA tournaments
this year. The Cardinal's score only improved
as the tournament went on, as the team went
from ninth place after the first round to a sixth

Ray said afterwards that he saw exactly

under 71 and a one-over 73. For his last Re
gional match, Grube finished strong, posting a
three-under 69 on the final day of the tourna
ment which helped him jump six spots to sixth

place in the individual tournament.
"Both Sihwan [Kim] and Rob [Grube]
played phenomenally in the final nine holes,"
Ray said. "At the turn of the final round, we
were about a shot in or out and it was great to
see them hit 31 and 32 to make three and four
under par.
"It was pretty amazing to see them step up
because within an hour we went from maybe
being able to qualify to being in great shape,"
Ray continued. "Both guys have the ability to
win every time they play. The leaders of the
team have to step up and they have been our
team leaders all year."
Junior Dodge Kemmer, like his fellow
teammates, had his best showing in the final
round, which launched him to the 57th spot in
the individual ranks. Kemmer started the
weekend with a four-over 76 and a five-over
77, but he cut down his score significantly in
the final round with a one-over 73 for the day.
Sophomore Jordan Cox finished just one
stroke behind his junior counterpart and fin
ished with a cumulative 11-over score of 227,
putting him in a tie for 63rd place.

GAME NOTES: Stanford got fifth- and sixth-place individual
finishes from freshman Sihwan Kim and senior Rob Grvbe,
who shot 212 (-4) and 213 (-3) respectively. Kim finished
just behind a three-way tie for second place and propelled
the Cardinal back to the NCAA Championships, which the
team won last year. Stanford is one of six Fbc-10 teams
that will be heading to Indiana in two weekends.

Rounding out the Cardinal five was fresh
man Steve Ziegler, who had a 15-over 231 for
the tournament. Ziegler also played his best
round on the final day of the tournament,
posting a three-over 75 for the day.
This was Stanford's first taste of the high
level of competition at NCAA tournaments
this year. The Cardinal's score only improved
as the tournament went on, as the team went
from ninth place after the first round to a sixth
place finish overall.
Ray said afterwards that he saw exactly
what he wanted from his golfers last weekend.
"Qualifying for the NCA As is a lot like the
game we play," Ray said. "No one asks you
how you shot your score after you play IS
holes and at the NCAA Championship, no
one remembers how you got there.
The guys have realized that we haven't
peaked yet. We have seen flashes of it this
weekend and throughout the season hut I'm
hoping that NCAAs will be the week that we
put it all together. Everyone knows that if we
do that, we can be one of the best teams in the
nation."
Now, the young Cardinal team can turn its
eyes to the task of grabbing its second NCAA
title in a row. Stanford will travel to Lafayette,
Ind. for the championship tournament in a
week and a half.
