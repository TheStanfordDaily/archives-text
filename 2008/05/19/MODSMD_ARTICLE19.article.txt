# Extra, extra: Card wins in 11
## Stanford drives in three runs in extra innings after four hours of baseball 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford stayed in the race for the Pac-10 title with a
crucial, 11-inning. 8-5 win over the Arizona Wildcats on
Sunday night. The Cardinal tied the three-game series
after losing the first game on Saturday night, 9-6.
Freshman Drew Storen threw five brilliant innings in
relief of starter Erik Davis. Storen. normally the Cardi

longest outing of his career.
Junior Jason Castro doubled home sophomore Wande
Olabisi and junior Cord Phelps in the eleventh to put
Stanford on top 7-5, and a Brent Milleville single plated
Castro to cement the Cardinal's lead. Storen made quick

second straight weekend series.
Stanford's offense started producing early, as sopho

Phelps. Gerhart would later come home as well, and the
Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 advantage.
But Wildcat Brad Glenn answered just a half inning
later when he hit a two-run homer off of Davis, Stanford's
ace.
Ilie Cardinal regained the lead in the fourth on a Sean
Ratliff homerun. Just one inning later, he hit a sharp sin
gle to right field that scored two more runs.
But Arizona responded immediately after, as Glenn
hit another two-run shot to bring the Wildcats within one.
Arizona squeezed out another run in the sixth to tie the
game.
It would be Davis's last inning, and coach Mark Mar
quess went to his young closer to stop the bleeding.
Storen recognized his task, and decided to take a dif
ferent approach than in his normal outings.
"In my first couple of innings. I took a starter's men
tality.'' Storen told KZSU after the game.
"Instead of going max out on every pitch. I tried to put
some movement on them," Storen continued.
But he was matched pitch for pitch by Arizona's clos-
