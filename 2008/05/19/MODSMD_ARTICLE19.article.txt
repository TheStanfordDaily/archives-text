# Extra, extra: Card wins in 11
## Stanford drives in three runs in extra innings after four hours of baseball 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford stayed in the race for the Pac-10 title with a
crucial, 11-inning. 8-5 win over the Arizona Wildcats on
Sunday night. The Cardinal tied the three-game series
after losing the first game on Saturday night, 9-6.
Freshman Drew Storen threw five brilliant innings in
relief of starter Erik Davis. Storen. normally the Cardi
nal's closer, allowed only two hits and no runs in the
longest outing of his career.
Junior Jason Castro doubled home sophomore Wande
Olabisi and junior Cord Phelps in the eleventh to put
Stanford on top 7-5, and a Brent Milleville single plated
Castro to cement the Cardinal's lead. Storen made quick
work of the Wildcats in the bottom half of the inning to
secure the win.
The combined performances of Castro and Storen
capped an exciting game in which the Cardinal couldn't
hold a 5-2 lead and looked to be in jeopardy of losing its

second straight weekend series.
Stanford's offense started producing early, as sopho
more Toby Gerhart hit a triple in the first inning to score
Phelps. Gerhart would later come home as well, and the
Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 advantage.
But Wildcat Brad Glenn answered just a half inning
later when he hit a two-run homer off of Davis, Stanford's
ace.
Ilie Cardinal regained the lead in the fourth on a Sean
Ratliff homerun. Just one inning later, he hit a sharp sin
gle to right field that scored two more runs.
But Arizona responded immediately after, as Glenn
hit another two-run shot to bring the Wildcats within one.
Arizona squeezed out another run in the sixth to tie the
game.
It would be Davis's last inning, and coach Mark Mar
quess went to his young closer to stop the bleeding.
Storen recognized his task, and decided to take a dif
ferent approach than in his normal outings.
"In my first couple of innings. I took a starter's men
tality.'' Storen told KZSU after the game.
"Instead of going max out on every pitch. I tried to put
some movement on them," Storen continued.
But he was matched pitch for pitch by Arizona's clos-

game in the ninth inning. He pitched
as well as Storen over his first two in

inning, and the Wildcats' last serious
scoring attempt.

But the fight they exhibited on
Saturday paid off on Sunday, as they
outlasted Arizona.
"We battled." said Castro. "That's

Stanford and Arizona will play
the rubber match tonight in Tucson.
Sophomore starter Jeffrey Inman
will take the hill for the Cardinal to
face the Wildcats' Eric Berger.
Stanford is currently two games
behind Arizona State in the Pac-10
standings with four contests remain

creasingly important for the Cardi
nal, as the team looks to keep its con
ference title hopes alive.
