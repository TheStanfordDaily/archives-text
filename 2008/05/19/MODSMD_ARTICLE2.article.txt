# Funding by tobacco companies examined
## Faculty Senate declined to ban tobacco-funded research one year ago; such research had already dwindled 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
One year ago this month, Stanford's
Faculty Senate rejected a resolution that
would have banned faculty from conducting
research sponsored by tobacco companies.
Though the presence of tobacco-sponsored
research on campus dwindled considerably
even before the ban was considered, large
sums of tobacco money have been granted
to Stanford researchers over the years, and
the issue of tobacco industry sponsorship
remains controversial.
THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO FUNDING
In March 2008, the Philip Morris
External Research Program (PMERP) —
one of the principal sources of tobacco
industry research grants in the nation — dis
banded after nearly eight years in operation.

John Cooke, professor of cardiovascular
medicine at the School of Medicine,
received funding from the PMERP for five
years, obtaining more than $800,000 to
research the effects of nicotine on blood ves
sel development.
In order to argue against the proposed
ban on tobacco industry-sponsored research
that was under consideration in the Faculty
Senate, Cooke broke ties with the Philip
Morris company in spring of 2007.
"I was hoping that would put me in a bet
ter position to argue against the ban on
tobacco funding," Cooke said. "I figured
once I stopped receiving funding 1 would be
in a better position to speak out against
what 1 thought was a very poor policy."
In May 2007, the Faculty Senate rejected
the proposed ban — which would have
barred any Stanford faculty member or
researcher from receiving research funding

from tobacco companies — by a vote of 21-
10. Cooke said he opposed the ban because
of the barriers it would have placed on fac
ulty members seeking sponsorship for aca
demic research.
"It's a restriction of academic freedom,"
he said. "Significant funding like that is nec
essary to run a laboratory for someone like
myself."
At the time that the tobacco research ban
was under consideration, Cooke said he was
the only Stanford faculty member receiving
funding for research from a tobacco compa
ny. But prior to the development of the
PMERP, other Stanford researchers
received funds from the program's parent
organizations, the Center for Indoor Air
Research (CIAR) and the Council for
Tobacco Research (CTR).
Statistics Prof. Paul Switzer worked for
several years with the CTR researching the

effects and disbursement of indoor pollu
tants. In an April 2007 email to Cooke, he
wrote that during his time with the CTR he
never felt pressured by the industry to reach
any specific conclusions in his research.
Cooke's experience working with the
PMERP left him with a similar impression,
and he said the evaluation and handling of
research findings through the Program was
comparable to the way findings are handled
through the National Institutes of Health
and other organizations that fund medical
research. And unlike the CIAR and previ
ous programs, he claimed the PMLRP oper
ated with a peer-evaluation system in which
findings were examined by fellow
researchers rather than tobacco company
marketing department officials.
"1 am no apologist for Philip Morris."
Cooke said, citing the health effects of
tobacco. Nonetheless, he said that he had

more restrictions placed on him with federal
research grants than by those he received
from the tobacco industry.
GOOD PUBLICITY FOR BIG TOBACCO?
The extent to which the tobacco industry
utilizes the findings of their researchers, or
in some cases does not utilize them, has long
been a controversial aspect of tobacco-fund
ed research.
I lugh McDevitt, professor of microbiolo
gy and immunology, served on the scientific
advisory board for the CTR — which ended
in 1999 —and received $100,000-$ 150,000
per year to fund his research. According to
McDevitt, the research funded through the
CTR had nothing to do with the effects of
tobacco use, and that was the intention of
Philip Morris.
"At the time I went on, I asked if there
was going to be any tobacco-related
research and they said no, and they stuck by
that," McDevitt said. "(Philip Morris was]
just trying to get some good PR."
"Everyone on that panel knew the
effects of tobacco," he added. "They didn't
ask these questions."
The allegation that Philip Morris funded
Stanford faculty and researchers from other
universities purely to create good publicity
for itself was touched upon in the Faculty
Senate debates over the research ban.
Switzer claimed that the main objection
to tobacco industry sponsorship through the
PMERP was that the program allowed the
industry to "burnish" its public image. But
he stated that even if this is true, tobacco
industry is no different from the countless
other industries — such as oil and utility
companies — that fund research to improve
the way the public views them.
While many corporations that fund aca
demic research may do so to improve their
images, the tobacco industry in particular
has also been accused of routinely manipu
lating research findings to downplay the
dangers of tobacco use.
Prior to his affiliation with the PMERP,
Cooke's research caught the attention of
Philip Morris when he was quoted in a May
2000 article in Tobacco Reporter entitled
"Healing Weed." In the article, Cooke's
research on the effects of nicotine on blood
vessel growth was used to bolster the idea
that tobacco could hold untapped therapeu
tic effects. But since this report was pub
lished, Cooke's research has also yielded
evidence supporting a link between tobacco
use and the acceleration of tumor growth, as
well as a link between tobacco use and
blindness.
"[As] a physician, I am constantly
reminded of the ravages of tobacco use, and
I vigorously utilize pharmacological and
behavioral methods to help my patients in
their efforts to stop smoking," Cooke wrote
to the Faculty Senate in March 2007. "In
that role, I understand the ambivalence
about the tobacco company funding. In the
past, the tobacco industry has used research
funding to support its political and corpo
rate agenda rather than sound science."
ETHICAL STANDARDS AND ACADEMIC
FREEDOM
For many of those who supported the
ban on tobacco-funded research, the possi
bility that the tobacco industry could use the
findings of Stanford researchers to deny or
simply foster doubt about the dangers of
tobacco was a significant concern.
"The industry support of sponsored
research is part of the conspiracy to defraud the
public about the nature of tobacco health haz
ards," said History Prof Robert Proctor, one of
the leading proponents of the funding ban.
According to Proctor, the history of uni
versity research sponsorship from the
tobacco industry is steeped in corruption,

deception and misinformation. Proctor said
that following the wide-scale scientific
recognition in the 1950s that tobacco was
harmful to a person's health, the tobacco
industry sought to use the research findings
of experts to spread doubt about the nega
tive health effects of tobacco. During this
time, the tobacco industry flooded universi
ties— including Stanford — with money
hoping that research findings would distort
the perceived consensus of the scientific
community.
Though tobacco-sponsored research on
campus has fallen since its heyday. Proctor
believes the University must take an ethical
stance against the abuses of the tobacco
industry.
"We thought if the University would
take a moral stand on tobacco it would
show that we have a moral backbone," he
said.
Proctor claimed that a major cause of the
defeat of the funding ban in tl\e Faculty
Senate was the administration's outcry
against the resolution. During the debates.
Provost John Etchemendy and President
John Hennessy expressed opposition to the
resolution on the grounds that it would
impede on academic freedom and set dan
gerous precedents for other areas of corpo
rate research sponsorship.
"The Senate voted down the proposal
after lively debate and the expressed oppo
sition from the Provost and President to
such restrictions on research funding,"
Switzer said. "The main argument against
the proposal was where to draw the line
regarding sources of research support — oil
companies? Foreign governments? Coal
companies? Drug companies? etc."
Proctor dismissed what he saw as "slip
pery slope" arguments by pointing to bans
on tobacco-sponsored research at Harvard.
Johns Hopkins, Emory and other universi
ties that have not resulted in a loss of aca
demic freedom or affected other areas of
research.
Neither Cooke, Switzer, nor McDevitt
said they were aware of anyone onvcampus
who is currently conducting any research
sponsored bv the tobacco industry. The
PMERP —like the CIAR and CTR before
it — was quietly shut down amidst
increased criticism of its funding motiva
tions and methods. But while the flow of
tobacco research money into Stanford may
have dried up on the surface level. Proctor
does not feel relieved. He said that private
consulting to the tobacco industry may pose
an even greater problem than sponsored
research, since faculty members are allowed
to consult for companies privately while
research funds must be disclosed to the
University.
"When 1 talked to people at the med
school. Proctor said, "they were more wor
ried about consulting than sponsored
research."

Philip Morris when he was quoted in a May
2000 article in Tobacco Reporter entitled
"Healing Weed." In the article, Cooke's
research on the effects of nicotine on blood
vessel growth was used to bolster the idea
that tobacco could hold untapped therapeu
tic effects. But since this report was pub
lished, Cooke's research has also yielded
evidence supporting a link between tobacco
use and the acceleration of tumor growth, as
well as a link between tobacco use and
blindness.
"[As] a physician, I am constantly
reminded of the ravages of tobacco use, and
I vigorously utilize pharmacological and
behavioral methods to help my patients in
their efforts to stop smoking," Cooke wrote
to the Faculty Senate in March 2007. "In
that role, I understand the ambivalence
about the tobacco company funding. In the
past, the tobacco industry has used research
funding to support its political and corpo
rate agenda rather than sound science."
ETHICAL STANDARDS AND ACADEMIC
FREEDOM
For many of those who supported the
ban on tobacco-funded research, the possi
bility that the tobacco industry could use the
findings of Stanford researchers to deny or
simply foster doubt about the dangers of
tobacco was a significant concern.
"The industry support of sponsored
research is part of the conspiracy to defraud the
public about the nature of tobacco health haz
ards," said History Prof Robert Proctor, one of
the leading proponents of the funding ban.
According to Proctor, the history of uni
versity research sponsorship from the
tobacco industry is steeped in corruption,

deception and misinformation. Proctor said
that following the wide-scale scientific
recognition in the 1950s that tobacco was
harmful to a person's health, the tobacco
industry sought to use the research findings
of experts to spread doubt about the nega
tive health effects of tobacco. During this
time, the tobacco industry flooded universi
ties— including Stanford — with money
hoping that research findings would distort
the perceived consensus of the scientific
community.
Though tobacco-sponsored research on
campus has fallen since its heyday. Proctor
believes the University must take an ethical
stance against the abuses of the tobacco
industry.
"We thought if the University would
take a moral stand on tobacco it would
show that we have a moral backbone," he
said.
Proctor claimed that a major cause of the
defeat of the funding ban in tl\e Faculty
Senate was the administration's outcry
against the resolution. During the debates.
Provost John Etchemendy and President
John Hennessy expressed opposition to the
resolution on the grounds that it would
impede on academic freedom and set dan
gerous precedents for other areas of corpo
rate research sponsorship.
"The Senate voted down the proposal
after lively debate and the expressed oppo
sition from the Provost and President to
such restrictions on research funding,"
Switzer said. "The main argument against
the proposal was where to draw the line
regarding sources of research support — oil
companies? Foreign governments? Coal
companies? Drug companies? etc."
Proctor dismissed what he saw as "slip
pery slope" arguments by pointing to bans
on tobacco-sponsored research at Harvard.
Johns Hopkins, Emory and other universi
ties that have not resulted in a loss of aca
demic freedom or affected other areas of
research.
Neither Cooke, Switzer, nor McDevitt
said they were aware of anyone onvcampus
who is currently conducting any research
sponsored bv the tobacco industry. The
PMERP —like the CIAR and CTR before
it — was quietly shut down amidst
increased criticism of its funding motiva
tions and methods. But while the flow of
tobacco research money into Stanford may
have dried up on the surface level. Proctor
does not feel relieved. He said that private
consulting to the tobacco industry may pose
an even greater problem than sponsored
research, since faculty members are allowed
to consult for companies privately while
research funds must be disclosed to the
University.
"When 1 talked to people at the med
school. Proctor said, "they were more wor
ried about consulting than sponsored
research."

One year ago this month, Stanford's
Faculty Senate rejected a resolution that
would have banned faculty from conducting
research sponsored by tobacco companies.
Though the presence of tobacco-sponsored
research on campus dwindled considerably
even before the ban was considered, large
sums of tobacco money have been granted
to Stanford researchers over the years, and
the issue of tobacco industry sponsorship
remains controversial.
THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO FUNDING
In March 2008, the Philip Morris
External Research Program (PMERP) —
one of the principal sources of tobacco
industry research grants in the nation — dis
banded after nearly eight years in operation.

John Cooke, professor of cardiovascular
medicine at the School of Medicine,
received funding from the PMERP for five
years, obtaining more than $800,000 to
research the effects of nicotine on blood ves
sel development.
In order to argue against the proposed
ban on tobacco industry-sponsored research
that was under consideration in the Faculty
Senate, Cooke broke ties with the Philip
Morris company in spring of 2007.
"I was hoping that would put me in a bet
ter position to argue against the ban on
tobacco funding," Cooke said. "I figured
once I stopped receiving funding 1 would be
in a better position to speak out against
what 1 thought was a very poor policy."
In May 2007, the Faculty Senate rejected
the proposed ban — which would have
barred any Stanford faculty member or
researcher from receiving research funding

from tobacco companies — by a vote of 21-
10. Cooke said he opposed the ban because
of the barriers it would have placed on fac
ulty members seeking sponsorship for aca
demic research.
"It's a restriction of academic freedom,"
he said. "Significant funding like that is nec
essary to run a laboratory for someone like
myself."
At the time that the tobacco research ban
was under consideration, Cooke said he was
the only Stanford faculty member receiving
funding for research from a tobacco compa
ny. But prior to the development of the
PMERP, other Stanford researchers
received funds from the program's parent
organizations, the Center for Indoor Air
Research (CIAR) and the Council for
Tobacco Research (CTR).
Statistics Prof. Paul Switzer worked for
several years with the CTR researching the

effects and disbursement of indoor pollu
tants. In an April 2007 email to Cooke, he
wrote that during his time with the CTR he
never felt pressured by the industry to reach
any specific conclusions in his research.
Cooke's experience working with the
PMERP left him with a similar impression,
and he said the evaluation and handling of
research findings through the Program was
comparable to the way findings are handled
through the National Institutes of Health
and other organizations that fund medical
research. And unlike the CIAR and previ
ous programs, he claimed the PMLRP oper
ated with a peer-evaluation system in which
findings were examined by fellow
researchers rather than tobacco company
marketing department officials.
"1 am no apologist for Philip Morris."
Cooke said, citing the health effects of
tobacco. Nonetheless, he said that he had

more restrictions placed on him with federal
research grants than by those he received
from the tobacco industry.
GOOD PUBLICITY FOR BIG TOBACCO?
The extent to which the tobacco industry
utilizes the findings of their researchers, or
in some cases does not utilize them, has long
been a controversial aspect of tobacco-fund
ed research.
I lugh McDevitt, professor of microbiolo
gy and immunology, served on the scientific
advisory board for the CTR — which ended
in 1999 —and received $100,000-$ 150,000
per year to fund his research. According to
McDevitt, the research funded through the
CTR had nothing to do with the effects of
tobacco use, and that was the intention of
Philip Morris.
"At the time I went on, I asked if there
was going to be any tobacco-related
research and they said no, and they stuck by
that," McDevitt said. "(Philip Morris was]
just trying to get some good PR."
"Everyone on that panel knew the
effects of tobacco," he added. "They didn't
ask these questions."
The allegation that Philip Morris funded
Stanford faculty and researchers from other
universities purely to create good publicity
for itself was touched upon in the Faculty
Senate debates over the research ban.
Switzer claimed that the main objection
to tobacco industry sponsorship through the
PMERP was that the program allowed the
industry to "burnish" its public image. But
he stated that even if this is true, tobacco
industry is no different from the countless
other industries — such as oil and utility
companies — that fund research to improve
the way the public views them.
While many corporations that fund aca
demic research may do so to improve their
images, the tobacco industry in particular
has also been accused of routinely manipu
lating research findings to downplay the
dangers of tobacco use.
Prior to his affiliation with the PMERP,
Cooke's research caught the attention of
Philip Morris when he was quoted in a May
2000 article in Tobacco Reporter entitled
