# Funding by tobacco companies examined
## Faculty Senate declined to ban tobacco-funded research one year ago; such research had already dwindled 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
One year ago this month, Stanford's
Faculty Senate rejected a resolution that
would have banned faculty from conducting
research sponsored by tobacco companies.
Though the presence of tobacco-sponsored
research on campus dwindled considerably
even before the ban was considered, large
sums of tobacco money have been granted
to Stanford researchers over the years, and
the issue of tobacco industry sponsorship
remains controversial.
THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO FUNDING
In March 2008, the Philip Morris
External Research Program (PMERP) —
one of the principal sources of tobacco
industry research grants in the nation — dis
banded after nearly eight years in operation.

John Cooke, professor of cardiovascular
medicine at the School of Medicine,
received funding from the PMERP for five
years, obtaining more than $800,000 to
research the effects of nicotine on blood ves
sel development.
In order to argue against the proposed
ban on tobacco industry-sponsored research
that was under consideration in the Faculty
Senate, Cooke broke ties with the Philip
Morris company in spring of 2007.
"I was hoping that would put me in a bet
ter position to argue against the ban on
tobacco funding," Cooke said. "I figured
once I stopped receiving funding 1 would be
in a better position to speak out against
what 1 thought was a very poor policy."
In May 2007, the Faculty Senate rejected
the proposed ban — which would have
barred any Stanford faculty member or
researcher from receiving research funding

from tobacco companies — by a vote of 21-
10. Cooke said he opposed the ban because
of the barriers it would have placed on fac
ulty members seeking sponsorship for aca
demic research.
"It's a restriction of academic freedom,"
he said. "Significant funding like that is nec
essary to run a laboratory for someone like
myself."
At the time that the tobacco research ban
was under consideration, Cooke said he was
the only Stanford faculty member receiving
funding for research from a tobacco compa
ny. But prior to the development of the
PMERP, other Stanford researchers
received funds from the program's parent
organizations, the Center for Indoor Air
Research (CIAR) and the Council for
Tobacco Research (CTR).
Statistics Prof. Paul Switzer worked for
several years with the CTR researching the

effects and disbursement of indoor pollu
tants. In an April 2007 email to Cooke, he
wrote that during his time with the CTR he
never felt pressured by the industry to reach
any specific conclusions in his research.
Cooke's experience working with the
PMERP left him with a similar impression,
and he said the evaluation and handling of
research findings through the Program was
comparable to the way findings are handled
through the National Institutes of Health
and other organizations that fund medical
research. And unlike the CIAR and previ
ous programs, he claimed the PMLRP oper
ated with a peer-evaluation system in which
findings were examined by fellow
researchers rather than tobacco company
marketing department officials.
"1 am no apologist for Philip Morris."
Cooke said, citing the health effects of
tobacco. Nonetheless, he said that he had

more restrictions placed on him with federal
research grants than by those he received
from the tobacco industry.
GOOD PUBLICITY FOR BIG TOBACCO?
The extent to which the tobacco industry
utilizes the findings of their researchers, or
in some cases does not utilize them, has long
been a controversial aspect of tobacco-fund
ed research.
I lugh McDevitt, professor of microbiolo
gy and immunology, served on the scientific
advisory board for the CTR — which ended
in 1999 —and received $100,000-$ 150,000
per year to fund his research. According to
McDevitt, the research funded through the
CTR had nothing to do with the effects of
tobacco use, and that was the intention of
Philip Morris.
