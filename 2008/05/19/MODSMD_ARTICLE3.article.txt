## Students felt quake in Chengdu Beijing campus escaped damage, students say 
### LOREN NEWMAN STAFF WRITER 
"It started with our desire to see
pandas," Chetan Sharma "09 told
ITie Daily in an email.
Sharma and three other students
studying at Stanford's overseas pro
gram in Beijing were visiting the
Panda Breeding Center in Chengdu
when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake
hit southwestern China. Sources
estimate that the quake has killed
more than 30,000 people, and
Chinese officials expect the final
death Moll to exceed 50,000. Nearly
5 million homes were damaged in
the earthquake, the epicenter of
which was in Sichuan Province and
about 60 miles from Chengdu.
Sharma's group arrived in
Chengdu about an hour before the
quake hit, and by the time the
ground began to shake, the students
were in a large, open Panda
Reserve area.
"We had the pleasure of merely
surfing on the rocking earth instead
of being knocked away by debris,"
Sharma said.
The group continued on a tour
of the compound after the earth
quake.
"The pandas didn't seem both
ered," said Pokey Rule '09, who was
also on the trip.
The Breeding Center complex,
comprised of shorter buildings, sus
tained much less damage than the
surrounding area. The group was
unaware of the magnitude of the
destrtltyion until leaving the
Center.
"We didn't really understand the
full extent of the damage until we
stepped outside the reserve,"
Maribeth Lock '08 said in an email
to The Daily. "We saw cracked side
walks, damaged roads, broken
water mains, flooding and collapsed
overpasses."
As the group hurried to the air
port. they encountered a chaotic,
crowded scene.
"A lot of the people . . . had
come to the airport because it was
considered to be the only struc-
turally sound building in the
province," Lock said.
Although the airport was soon
declared closed for the entire day,
the students caught a flight after
several hours, returning to Beijing
around 3 a.m. local time.
While waiting for a flight, an
aftershock hit the airport and the
three Stanford students ran for the
door along with the 3.000 other
panicked people inside the airport.
"A minute later we were all out
side again, except for Che
[Sharma]," Barry Burns "09 told
The Daily in an email. "[He] stayed
in the building to cut everyone else
in line at the ticket desk when they
all left."
Rule told The Daily that the
group had almost gone to Wolong,
an area much closer to the epicen
ter of the quake, but altered plans
at the last minute due to ticketing
difficulties.
Closer to the Stanford Overseas
Study Center in Beijing, students
did not notice any tremors, former
Daily editor Christian Tom '09
reported in an email. But many tall
buildings in districts across the city
were evacuated as a precaution.
At Stanford, a number of stu
dent organizations have planned
outreach events in response to the
disaster.
"I was actually really surprised by
the quick response from the
Stanford community," Lock said. "By
the time I got back to my email in
Beijing there were already about 10
emails from various student groups
about relief efforts and vigils."
"Hopefully the relief efforts will
provide enough aid that the
province can redevelop its infra

structure so that it's more capable
of safely supporting the large pop
ulation," she said.

"We didn't
understand the
full extent of
the damage
until we
stepped off the
preserve."
