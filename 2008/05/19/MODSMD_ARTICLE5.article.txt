## Students discuss gay marriage 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
After California's Supreme Court struck
down a law banning same-sex marriage last
Thursday, news cameras captured San
Francisco residents dancing in the streets in the
Castro district.
Stanford's LGBT community was similarly
jubilant.
"Everyone has been in a wonderful, won
derful mood," said Jamie Tam '10. "There have
been a lot more hugs and there's been a lot
more screaming."
Wedding bells will ring for at least one
Stanford faculty member: Education Prof. Ed
Haertel.
"I heard the news on the radio, driving into
campus," he said in an email to The Daily. "1
was surprised how emotional I felt. Drew and 1
have been partners for about 17 years. I got to
the office, called him to tell him the news and
said, 'Let's get married.'"
News of the court's decision quickly spread
to students across campus. Tam said she woke
up to a friend's text message on ITiursday
morning. "I read it and 1 literally jumped out of
my bed," she said. "I ran into the kitchen and I

was giggling and danc
ing."
Benj Fried '10 heard
the news shortly after
Tarn. "My mom called
and left me a voicemail
and she was so happy," he
said. "I think she was
really touched that I can
get married now. And my
sister is ecstatic."

Matt Bush '10 said he heard
the news when he walked into the
LGBT community resource center
after his morning classes.

"Someone said.'Did you hear? Gay
marriage is now legal!' At first I couldn't
believe it," Bush said.

Thursday's ruling makes California the
second state, after Massachusetts, to legally
recognize same-sex marriage.
"California was so overdue for this." Fried
said. "It's time we set a precedent."

Kimberley Stewart '10 pointed out that
California has made history before, striking
down a ban on interracial marriages in 1948
when 94 pereent of Americans opposed such
marriages.

"I've never been prouder to be a
Californian," Stewart said of Thursday's deci
sion.

Jessie Gardner '08 will move from
California to New York after graduation.
"This does make me sadder about

leaving the state," she said. "1 like that

if I wanted to get married. I
wouldn't have to drive for hours

to go to Massachusetts."

"It could all get overturned
in November." she said, refer
ring to the potential introduc
tion of a constitutional
amendment banning gay
marriage in California by

conservative groups. "You
need to get married soon!"
Fried also brought up

the chance that a measure
banning same-sex marriage could make the
ballot in California's upcoming election.
"We have to mobilize for November," Fried
said.
