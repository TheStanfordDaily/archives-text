# SUPER WIN FOR SOFTBALL
## 
### DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Facing elimination on Sunday after
noon, pitcher Missy Penna put the No. 8
Stanford softball team on her back and
carried it to the Super Regionals.
After losing yesterday morning to
the University of Massachusetts, 2-1, to
force a win-or-go-home game Sunday
afternoon, the junior right hander no
hit the Minutewomen to keep the
Cardinal's season alive. It was Stanford
and Penna's third time out against
UMass in two days.
Penna struck out nine and walked
just two in her near-flawless elimination
game. The shutout was Penna's third of
the weekend and 15th of the season.
The result of the championship
game was only briefly in question, as
the Cardinal scored three runs in the
top of the first and cruised to a 6-0 vic
tory.
Stanford advanced to the champi
onship of the four-team double elimina
tion tournament with a 4-0 win over
Lehigh on Friday and a 3-0 win over
UMass on Saturday, before falling in
the first game Sunday.
Penna pitched all 28 innings on the
weekend and did not allow an earned
run.
Stanford head coach John Rittman
could not have been more impressed by
his star pitcher's performance.
"For her to have that type of per
formance in a game of that magnitude
is an outstanding achievement for her
and our program." Rittman said in a

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal lost to UMass to start
the day but came back with a vengeance in the
afternoon, winning 6-0 to take the Regional title
and advance to the NCM Super Regionals against
Texas A&M. Junior pitcher Missy Rsnna tossed a
no-hitter to wrap up a phenomenal Regional in
which she did not allow a single earned run.

postgame press conference.
After the first two games of the
weekend it looked as if the Cardinal
would cruise through the Regional
without a hitch, but UMass put the
pressure on in the first game on Sunday.
The Minutewomen put two runs on
the board in the first inning to get
things started, aided by a pair of Penna
errors.
Meanwhile, Stanford was unable to
muster any offense against UMass
pitcher Brandice Balschmiter until the
bottom of the seventh. ITie Cardinal
loaded the bases with nobody out and
was primed for a rally, but a Tricia
Aggabao sacrifice fly, an Anna
Beardman fielder's choice, and an
Alissa Haber strikeout ended the game.
However. Stanford would jump on

Balschmiter, who was pitching her fifth
game in three days, in the second game
of the doubleheader.
The Cardinal scored three in the top
of the first on RBI hits by junior short
stop Maddy Coon, sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill and senior first baseman
Erin Howe.
In addition to catching Penna's no
hitter. Neill added her Stanford season
record-tying 19th homerun of the year
after leading off the fifth inning. The
blast extended the Cardinal lead to 5-0.
Neill was full of praise for her bat
tery mate after the game.
"| Penna] is definitely a clutch player.
She knew what she had to do and the
adjustments she had to make and did a
good job of going out there and getting
them." Neill said.
Neill had three hits in the champi
onship game, while Coon. Haber, Howe
and sophomore second baseman
Shannon Koplitz each had two.
Penna credited the offense for giv
ing her a lead and making her more
comfortable in the circle.
"I think a big theme in our series
with UMass was scoring first." Penna
said. "In all three games the team that
scored first won. I think it was a nice
cushion for them in the first game and
then for us in the second.
It was a relief that we scored first
and we could play our game without
being so tight and tense."
Penna knew she could dominate the
Minutewomen, having two-hit them a

day earlier in the first of the three
matchups.
In that game she struck out 11
and walked one, while the Cardi
nal scored two runs in the first and
one in the second to give her a
comfortable lead.
Koplitz led the offensive attack
in that game with a pair of hits to
go along with a run and an RBI.
A day earlier the Cardinal sent
Lehigh to the loser's side of the
bracket with a commanding 4-0
victory to open the tournament.
Penna struck out 14, and Coon
had a first inning homer to put
Stanford in control for good.
Haber led the offense from the
leadoff spot with a pair of hits and
a run scored.
