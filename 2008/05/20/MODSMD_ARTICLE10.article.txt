# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Students design, rally to help Myanmar victims Film fest, shirt sales to raise funds for relief 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Burma, a former British colony
now called Myanmar, is one of the
poorest countries in Asia. On May 2,
Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar and
killed close to 1 (K).(XK) citizens, leav
ing approximately 5b,(X)() missing.
Thousands of miles away, students on
campus are doing their part to raise
awareness of the Myanmar tragedy.
The Design for Extreme
Affordability class at the Stanford
Design School is making products to
help impoverished countries, such as
low-cost water pumps. Several stu
dents in the class handed together
after the cyclone hit and created a
group for Myanmar relief. Though
the students hope the products
designed in the class will someday
benefit nations like Myanmar, the
group is also putting on a film festival
and making t-shirts to fundraise for
disaster relief.
"We're trying to raise money
because that's the best way from here
that we feel we can benefit," said
Heather Bischel, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and a member
of the class. "We want to raise money
for groups that already have a longer
investment in Burma, not only for an

immediate relief effort, but for a
longer term recovery effort."
For Bischel, the Burmese situa
tion hits close to home. Her close
childhood friend's mother was from
Burma.
"I always wanted to find some
way to connect with Burma and also
to work on developing a sustainable
world," she said. "This class was a
perfect marriage of both."
Christina Liebner, a master's stu
dent in mechanical engineering, took
the class because of her interest in
sustainable development.
"The organization that we're
working with [is one] we feel so
closely connected with," she said,
"because they design products that
help people with their lives. Iliey're
serving as a humanitarian relief
organization, so they can grow rice,
vegetables and rebuild their lives."
While the Myanmar relief group
focuses on fundraising, a separate
group hopes to tackle the political
realities of the crisis.
Annalise Blum '10, who also writes
for The Daily, started the Burma
Action group last September in
response to the Saffron Revolution,
Burmese anti-government protests
led by monks. The protests were pro
voked by an increase in fuel prices by
1(H) percent.
"It was important to me to do
what we could do to support the
monks (here at Stanford]" Blum
said. "Wo have so much more power
to pressure the government to do
things."
Burma received its independence
from Britain in 1947. A political con
sensus could not be reached and, in
1962. a military coup overthrew the
government. Since then, Myanmar
has been ruled by a military junta
entitled the State Peace and
Development Council.
Now. after the cyclone, the mili
tary junta in power is heavily
restricting the acceptance of foreign
aid â€” an issue Blum's group aims to
illuminate. Blum said that the junta
may be afraid that allowing aid or
aid workers into the country will
give the people force behind a rebel
lion.
Burma Action will host a talk on
the political situation in Burma at 7
p.m. in the Encina Hall East
Conference Room, featuring one
speaker involved in the Burmese
Democracy Movement since the late
1980s, another who is the president
of the Burmese-American
Democratic Alliance and a third
who is an expert in Southeast Asian
relations.
