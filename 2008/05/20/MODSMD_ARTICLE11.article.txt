Hie couple moved to Palo Alto in
1939, when her husband accepted
a teaching position at Stanford.
The Lorings moved onto cam

1951, and Dorothy filled her time
driving her children to scouts,
music lessons and theater and
orchestra rehearsals. Loring also
assisted her husband in the labo

ratory with his early polio vaccine
development and later cancer

After her husband's death,
Loring continued to work at
Stanford in the Registrar's Office,
shepherding students through the
thorny process of signing up for
classes. Students and friends on
campus will remember Loring —
who preferred using public trans
portation until her stroke —
walking and riding the
Marguerite around town.
Margaret de la Cruz, degree
progress officer at the Registrar's
Office since 1976, remembered
Loring as a kind and compassion
ate woman.
'Dorothy was lovely," De la Cruz
said. "She enjoyed her job. She
worked here when we had the old
style arena registration process at
Maples Pavilion. She stamped the
students' forms and provided them
with their student ID cards."
As computers took over student
registration, Loring spent thirty-five
years volunteering at the VA
Hospital of Palo Alto. Cubherley
Community Center and La Comida
Dining Room, until her stroke in

2007.
"Dorothy volunteered 12,820
hours at the VA hospital of Palo
Alto since 1971," said William Ball,
chief of voluntary services at the VA.
"She was our 'Golden Lady' — a
special order we give to our volun
teers who are 90 and over. Dorothy
wanted to help anyone she could
and always had a smile on her face.
She helped transport lab specimens
to the lab."
Those at La Comida expressed
similar sentiments.
"She was the kind of person that
was always upbeat, always had a
kind word to say," added Mary Ruth
Batchelder, site manager of La
Comida. "Her personality is the

secret to a long life. She was a mar
velous human being,"
"She was remarkable — a charm
ing and inspiring woman who was
passionate about life." added Betty
Schneider, who goes to La Comida
for lunch.
In January, though paralyzed by
her stroke. Loring enjoyed a rousing
98th birthday celebration with her
children and grandchildren.
