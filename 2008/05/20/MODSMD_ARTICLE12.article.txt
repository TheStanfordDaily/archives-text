This column expresses skepti
cism about development work,
not disaster relief. Although
my time in Namibia left me with
reservations about the former, I have
nt) doubt that the latter saves innu
merable lives and rebuilds devastat
ed communities. Relief efforts are es
pecially essential in times like these,
and if any of you haven't yet con
tributed to organizations working in
China or Myanmar — or even if you
have — doing so would be a shining
example of a moral action. Just five or
ten dollars could do a world of good.
But development work is a differ
ent story. Doing development work
in Namibia hardened me as much as
it inspired me. I still believe that, in
the words of Robert F. Kennedy,
"each time a man stands up for an
ideal or acts to improve the lot of oth
ers he sends forth a tiny ripple of
hope, and crossing each other from a
million different centers of energy
these ripples build a current which
can sweep down the mightiest walls
of resistance." Lofty rhetoric aside, I
can't shake the feeling that much of
the work that NGOs and develop
ment organizations are engaged in is
of questionable value.
30,000 children die every year
from extreme poverty. Those of us in
this line of work — and many of the
rest of us with a conscience — firmly
believe that changing this dire situa
tion is the moral obligation of our
generation.To that end. over the past
five decades, the Western World has
spent approximately $2.3 trillion dol
lars on foreign aid. What's recognized
rarely, if ever, is that econometricians
have failed to find any evidence of a
positive effect of foreign aid on eco
nomic growth.
More qualified people have writ
ten tomes about how and why we
have gone wrong. For starters. Hill
Easterly's The White Man's Burden:
Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest
Have Done So Much 111 and So Little
Good lays out a pretty strong case
that aid efforts such as the Millenni
um Development Goals fail because
they lack "customer feedback, incen
tives and accountability."
What I'm more interested in ex
ploring are the reasons why,based on
my experience, so few people in
volved in development or public in
terest work — myself included —
openly grapple with the frequent fu
tility of our work.

One practical reason for this phe
nomenon. in my opinion, is that deliv
erables in this line of work are very
hard to measure, especially in the
short-term. Maybe as a result of our
efforts in Namibia, local magistrates
will have an easier time accessing cur
rent statutory and case law and will
thus be able to better implement the
law. If this ever happens, though, it
will be years down the road, we'll
never really know about it and our
part in improving their lot will be
minimal.
A more abstract rationale for our
selective blindness is the comfort we
generally take in having the best of
intentions. Ten Stanford Law Stu
dents traveled to Africa with the
noble goal of helping out those who
are severely disadvantaged, and our
sacrifices for this work pale in com
parison to others who work for other
human rights and development or
ganizations. As human beings. I think
it's hard to square away our fervent
devotion to undeniably just causes
and the very real chance that our net
impact on the ground may be negligi
ble.
Most importantly. I'd submit that a
prerequisite for this type of work is a
deeply grounded faith in humanity
and optimism about the future. If I
didn't believe that life actually could
be significantly better for the worst
off in our country and around the
globe. I would go corporate and
never look back. This hope for the
betterment of mankind doesn't easily
mesh with our stark failures in help
ing developing countries over the
past few decades.
To be clear. I'm not advocating de
featism or pessimism. My only point
is this: now that we Stanford Law stu
dents have left Namibia, our projects
might fall apart or simply be in vain.
If this is true, then the last thing we
should do as we walk away is pat our
selves on the back.

Seriously, let's donate something to dis
