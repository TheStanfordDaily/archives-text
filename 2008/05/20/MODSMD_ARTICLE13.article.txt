## A 						look at Stanford admissions 
### 
The Daily reported last week
that Stanford's current yield
rate, the percentage of stu
dents admitted who will likely at
tend. is 72 percent. 'ITie number may
surprise many admission-watchers,
since it was above Stanford's past
rates of 70.8 and 69 percent.
For the second consecutive year, it
appears Stanford has accepted too
many students. Some feel it was done
intentionally, "to force the issue" on
the proposal to expand Stanford's
class size. "Summer melt," however,
will likely pull the yield rate down to
last year's — Harvard announced it
will be pulling 2(X) or so students
from its waitlist and Yale and Prince
ton each will accept more than 50
students from theirs.
College admission consists of two
separate pools of applicants. One
group is those students who clearly
want to come to Stanford — those
students tend to apply early under
the "Single-Choice Early Admis
sion" process. The second pool is
made up of those students who don't
know where they want to attend and
need to be persuaded. It is this group
that Admit Weekend sorely under
serves, a topic I've discussed previ
ously. It is with this second type of
students that Stanford fails to com
pete with Harvard,Yale and MlT,ac
cording to statistics published by the
"Revealed Preference Ranking" in
December. 2005.
The college admission battlefield
has shifted in recent years. Harvard
has remained the de facto leader,
dropping its early admission pro
gram — Princeton followed, though
Stanford and Yale did not. Harvard
was also the first college to announce

a massive new financial aid program
for middle-class students — Stan
ford announced a new. less generous
program a few months later. And,
overall, according to The New York
Times, Harvard is Stanford's main
competitor. On September 16,2006,
the paper reported that 73 percent of
students choosing between Harvard
and Stanford would choose Harvard.
Stanford's admission process
seems to reveal a dangerous excep
tionalism relative to other schools.
Rather than competing for students
on the same level as our peer schools
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT,
we assume that students will come
here even though other schools offer
better financial aid packages and a
more comprehensive publicity cam
paign.
Attracting a diverse student body

is important. We shouldn't only want
students who are gung-ho to come
here since junior high — students
who take a long time to make up
their mind are just as valuable. And
Stanford misses opportunities to at
tract students who might not have
considered us initially. Unlike all of
those other schools, Stanford does
not do alumni interviews, thereby
missing a crucial opportunity to en
gage alumni,sell the Stanford experi
ence and put a personal, human face
on the admission process. Further
more. we still engage in early admis
sion despite the inherent unfairness
of the process and its abolition by
Harvard and Princeton.
What must be questioned is Stan
ford's commitment to attracting the
very best student. We assume that
students will want to come here no
matter what. And while many stu
dents have wanted to attend Stan
ford since the day they took that tour
sophomore year of high school,
many others don't feel that way, and
Stanford isn't doing enough to com
pete for those students.
Does competing with the Ivy
League for cross-admits even mat
ter? Most professors probably
wouldn't be able to notice a differ
ence if Stanford attracted 20 percent
of cross-admits with Harvard or SO
percent. But the fact of the matter is,
Stanford should be competing for
every student it admits. Why bother
to admit students unless we want
them to enroll? As of now. we are
writing off too many talented stu
dents.
