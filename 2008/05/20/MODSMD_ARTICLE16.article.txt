In Monday's article,"Funding by
tobacco companies examined," The
Daily inaccurately reported that
Prof. Hugh McDevitt received
$100,000-$ 150.0(H) per year from
the Tobacco Research Council to
fund his research. In actuality,
McDevitt only received travel
expenses to attend the CTR scien
tific advisory board's meetings, plus
a small honorarium.
