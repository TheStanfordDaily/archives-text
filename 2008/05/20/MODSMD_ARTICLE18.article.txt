# Arizona topples Stanford, 15-11
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
In a game that finished after eight innings
due to time restrictions on the Cardinal's travel
ing schedule, Stanford baseball dropped the
rubber match in its three-game series against
Arizona in Tucson. 15-11. thanks to a pair of
huge innings in the third and seventh by the
Wildcats.
The Cardinal (31-20, 12-9 Pac-10) jumped
out to an early lead, scoring five in the second
and three in the third before Arizona (36-16.10-

11) rallied for its first big inning in the bottom of
the third with a nine-run outburst.
Arizona did most of its damage with a flurry
of singles, a pair of walks and a hit batter to score
three runs before the Cardinal could record an
out. The only real power Arizona displayed all
inning was a one-out, two-run home run by des
ignated hitter Dillon Baird, the only extra-base
hit of the inning. Still, the damage was done as
the Wildcats battered the Cardinal with seven
hits, three walks and a Stanford throwing error.
The Cardinal scratched and clawed its way
back, however, scoring a single run in each of
the fifth.sixth and seventh innings to take a two
run lead at 1 l- 1 ). But Arizona responded once
again with a six-run seventh. The Wildcats' sec
ond big rally followed a formula similar to their
first — they had plated a pair of runs on four
singles, a stolen base and a wild pitch while
recording just one out before first baseman C. J.

Ziegler broke the game wide open with a grand
slam. The shot to center field put the 'Cats on
top for good. 15-11.
Aside from its pair of outstanding offensive
half-innings, the Arizona offense was incredibly
anemic, recording just three hits over its other
five innings of work. Still, virtually every pitcher
that Stanford coach Mark Marquess sent to the
mound for the Cardinal wound up with a disap
pointing day. Junior Max Fearnow was good for
3.2 solid innings, allowing just a pair of runs, one
of which was on first base when he left the game.
Jeremy Bleich also collected a pair of outs in
the Stanford ace's first appearance since March
28; the junior missed over a month and a half of
action due to injury, perhaps sparking some
hope that he could be ready to contribute to a
postseason run.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal dropped two of three games
against the Wildcats in Tucson, with the most recent loss
coming by way of a pair of huge innings for Arizona.
The Cardinal rocketed out to an 8-0 lead through two
and a half innings, but the Wildcats racked up nine runs
in the bottom of the third and another six in the bottom
of the seventh. The game was called after eight innings
due to Stanford's travel plans on getaway day.
Stanford's offense collected five
runs in the second in similar fashion to
the Wildcats' modus operandi of the
day, as seven runners reached base on
a fielding error, a pair of walks and
four singles before Arizona recorded
an out.The Cardinal's effort was good
for five runs in the inning before Matt
Chaffee came on in relief of the Wild
cats' starter and struck out junior
Brent Milleville. senior Randy Molina
and junior Sean Katliff, who had led
off the inning, in quick succession.
The third inning put the Cardinal's
power on further display as sopho
more Toby Gerhart hit a two-run
homer as part of a three run inning for
Stanford. Junior second baseman
Cord Phelps also hit a homerun in the
fifth, a solo shot to left, rounding out
Stanford's power display for the day.
With the victory, Arizona has now
defeated Stanford in six consecutive
series dating back to 2003.The Cardi
nal will take to the road again this
weekend for its final regular-season
action of 200K as it travels to Seattle to
face Washington in a three-game se
ries beginning on Friday at 6:30 p.m.

out to an early lead, scoring five in the second
and three in the third before Arizona (36-16.10-

11) rallied for its first big inning in the bottom of
the third with a nine-run outburst.
Arizona did most of its damage with a flurry
of singles, a pair of walks and a hit batter to score
three runs before the Cardinal could record an
out. The only real power Arizona displayed all
inning was a one-out, two-run home run by des
ignated hitter Dillon Baird, the only extra-base
hit of the inning. Still, the damage was done as
the Wildcats battered the Cardinal with seven
hits, three walks and a Stanford throwing error.
The Cardinal scratched and clawed its way
back, however, scoring a single run in each of
the fifth.sixth and seventh innings to take a two
run lead at 1 l- 1 ). But Arizona responded once
again with a six-run seventh. The Wildcats' sec
ond big rally followed a formula similar to their
first — they had plated a pair of runs on four
singles, a stolen base and a wild pitch while
recording just one out before first baseman C. J.

Ziegler broke the game wide open with a grand
slam. The shot to center field put the 'Cats on
top for good. 15-11.
Aside from its pair of outstanding offensive
half-innings, the Arizona offense was incredibly
anemic, recording just three hits over its other
five innings of work. Still, virtually every pitcher
that Stanford coach Mark Marquess sent to the
mound for the Cardinal wound up with a disap
pointing day. Junior Max Fearnow was good for
3.2 solid innings, allowing just a pair of runs, one
of which was on first base when he left the game.
Jeremy Bleich also collected a pair of outs in
the Stanford ace's first appearance since March
28; the junior missed over a month and a half of
action due to injury, perhaps sparking some
hope that he could be ready to contribute to a
postseason run.

against the Wildcats in Tucson, with the most recent loss

due to Stanford's travel plans on getaway day.
Stanford's offense collected five
runs in the second in similar fashion to
the Wildcats' modus operandi of the
day, as seven runners reached base on
a fielding error, a pair of walks and
four singles before Arizona recorded
an out.The Cardinal's effort was good
for five runs in the inning before Matt
Chaffee came on in relief of the Wild
cats' starter and struck out junior
Brent Milleville. senior Randy Molina
and junior Sean Katliff, who had led
off the inning, in quick succession.
The third inning put the Cardinal's
power on further display as sopho
more Toby Gerhart hit a two-run
homer as part of a three run inning for
Stanford. Junior second baseman
Cord Phelps also hit a homerun in the
fifth, a solo shot to left, rounding out
Stanford's power display for the day.
