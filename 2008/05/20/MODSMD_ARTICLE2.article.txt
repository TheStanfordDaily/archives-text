# FACULTY & STAFF
## Receiving tenure is long, stressful road The
						tenure track at the Farm requires top notch research, teaching, patience 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Shortly after the nation's high school seniors learn
the colleges into which they were accepted, the ranks
of Stanford junior faculty start receiving their own
highly anticipated news: whether they have earned
tenure.
Stanford has a rigorous tenure process. In the most
typical case. Stanford evaluates a junior faculty mem
ber for a tenured position in his or her seventh year at
Stanford, with the candidate usually at the rank of
assistant professor. In the years leading up to the sev
enth year tenure review, a number of candidates, who
may have ultimately been unsuccessful in receiving
tenure, leave Stanford.

Out of all assistant professors hired between 1995-
2000 who were on the tenure track, 51 percent earned
tenure at Stanford, compared with 44 percent of
those hired out of the past 25 years. But for those fac
ulty members hired between 1995-2000 who actually
reached the tenure review year, 84 percent received
tenure, compared with 77 percent over the past 25
years.
The tenure review process generally involves the
same basic evaluative steps across departments. A
candidate must pass through an initial tenure com
mittee and a vote of tenured department faculty.
Subsequently, the candidate must pass through evalu
ations and recommendations by the department
chair, an executive committee at the school level, the
dean of the school, a seven-member advisory board at
the level of the provost's office, the provost himself
and finally the University president.
"At all levels, there is a chance of tenure being
denied," Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. "82 told The
Daily.
Faculty and department chairs said that the total
process, though long and rigorous, is straightforward.
"Tenure is a very deliberate process that follows a
very laid-out process," said English Chair Prof.
Ramon Saldivar. "There are no surprises, and every
one knows exactly what's coming."
Given the rigors of the process. Stanford makes
efforts to recruit and retain faculty who they feel con
fident about enduring the evaluative process.
"We're very, very careful about hiring,"
Etchemendy said. "We only hire people we think real
ly have a chance to make tenure."
CRITERIA
The tenure review process examines, at the most
basic level, two components of an applicant's qualifi
cations: research and teaching. Research is consid
ered significantly more important than teaching in
evaluating a candidate.
Etchemendy explained that valuing quality in
research ensures that tenured faculty will continue to
interact with and contribute to cutting-edge scholar
ship. rather than providing entertaining but potential
ly outdated classes.
"I view the research criterion as an important part
of the evidence of whether they're going to be a good
teacher," Etchemendy said. "At the time of tenure,
someone might be able to teach a great class, but
twenty years later they might be teaching the same
class."
"Our research criterion is partly to ensure a long
term. career-long quality of teaching," Etchemendy
added. "Part of what you get at Stanford is that when
a faculty members says, that's special' [or| 'that's
new." you know that person knows what he or she is
talking about.There's a kind of access to the forefront
of knowledge that you get that you won't get without
the high quality of research."
Nonetheless, a scholar without the right teaching
skills could still be considered an inappropriate candi
date for tenure.
"There are cases where we've denied an applica
tion because the teaching wasn't good, but they (the
