# FACULTY & STAFF
## Receiving tenure is long, stressful road The 						tenure track at the Farm requires top notch research, teaching, patience 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Shortly after the nation's high school seniors learn
the colleges into which they were accepted, the ranks
of Stanford junior faculty start receiving their own
highly anticipated news: whether they have earned
tenure.
Stanford has a rigorous tenure process. In the most
typical case. Stanford evaluates a junior faculty mem
ber for a tenured position in his or her seventh year at
Stanford, with the candidate usually at the rank of
assistant professor. In the years leading up to the sev
enth year tenure review, a number of candidates, who
may have ultimately been unsuccessful in receiving
tenure, leave Stanford.

Out of all assistant professors hired between 1995-
2000 who were on the tenure track, 51 percent earned
tenure at Stanford, compared with 44 percent of
those hired out of the past 25 years. But for those fac
ulty members hired between 1995-2000 who actually
reached the tenure review year, 84 percent received
tenure, compared with 77 percent over the past 25
years.
The tenure review process generally involves the
same basic evaluative steps across departments. A
candidate must pass through an initial tenure com
mittee and a vote of tenured department faculty.
Subsequently, the candidate must pass through evalu
ations and recommendations by the department
chair, an executive committee at the school level, the
dean of the school, a seven-member advisory board at
the level of the provost's office, the provost himself
and finally the University president.
"At all levels, there is a chance of tenure being
denied," Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. "82 told The
Daily.
Faculty and department chairs said that the total
process, though long and rigorous, is straightforward.
"Tenure is a very deliberate process that follows a
very laid-out process," said English Chair Prof.
Ramon Saldivar. "There are no surprises, and every
one knows exactly what's coming."
Given the rigors of the process. Stanford makes
efforts to recruit and retain faculty who they feel con
fident about enduring the evaluative process.
"We're very, very careful about hiring,"
Etchemendy said. "We only hire people we think real
ly have a chance to make tenure."
CRITERIA
The tenure review process examines, at the most
basic level, two components of an applicant's qualifi
cations: research and teaching. Research is consid
ered significantly more important than teaching in
evaluating a candidate.
Etchemendy explained that valuing quality in
research ensures that tenured faculty will continue to
interact with and contribute to cutting-edge scholar
ship. rather than providing entertaining but potential
ly outdated classes.
"I view the research criterion as an important part
of the evidence of whether they're going to be a good
teacher," Etchemendy said. "At the time of tenure,
someone might be able to teach a great class, but
twenty years later they might be teaching the same
class."
"Our research criterion is partly to ensure a long
term. career-long quality of teaching," Etchemendy
added. "Part of what you get at Stanford is that when
a faculty members says, that's special' [or| 'that's
new." you know that person knows what he or she is
talking about.There's a kind of access to the forefront
of knowledge that you get that you won't get without
the high quality of research."
Nonetheless, a scholar without the right teaching
skills could still be considered an inappropriate candi
date for tenure.
"There are cases where we've denied an applica
tion because the teaching wasn't good, but they (the
faculty members being considered]
are Mac Arthur Fellows,"
Etchemendy said, referencing dis
tinguished Mac Arthur "genius
grants."
If a professor is denied tenure, he
or she can appeal, although steps are
in place to ensure that the denial
was made for proper reasons.
"People can always appeal the
decision," Etchemendy said. "But
we have various checks to make
sure the decision was indeed a rea
sonable one and wasn't made frivo
lously."
THE PROCESS
The most crucial step in the
process comes at the beginning,
when a candidate undergoes the
review of a specially appointed
tenure committee, usually consisting
of four peers and occasionally one
member from an outside, related
field. This committee compiles
materials relevant for evaluating the
tenure candidate. The materials are
both diverse and thorough, ranging
from personal statements from the
candidate to evaluations and letters
from undergraduate, graduate and
post-doctoral students who worked
with him or her. All told, the full
assembly of materials often reaches
the length of a book.
Among the most crucial materi
als is a collection of peer-review let
ters from other scholars in the facul
ty's field.
"To look at their research, the
committee will write to anywhere
from twelve to twenty people in
their field." Etchemendy said.
"These are top people in the field,
people recognized as experienced.
The committee writes to find out
whether [the candidate] has
achieved true distinction and
whether they're considered or are
on their way to being considered in
the top of their field."
Reviewers are asked to explain
the person's position and relative
strength in their field, and candi
dates under review are held to a
very high standard.
"They're typically asked to rank
them against the best four or five
people in the field," Etchemendy
said. "We expect and hope our per
son is going to be very competent,
and if they're coming up in the bot
tom of those lists, that's a concern."

"But if you pick a comparative
set well, and they're coming up sec
ond or third, that's pretty good," he
added.
Tenured professors at Stanford
are often asked to write reviews for
evaluations at other universities,
and some admitted that the process
of evaluating was trying.
"It's not really fun," said Classics
Department Chair Richard Martin.
"It's pretty painful. There are prob
ably twenty visible scholars out
there in a field, and you wind up
ranking people where you know
their life stories."
"You try to contextualize where
that person stands in relation to
other people's work." said
Psychology Department Chair
Brian Wandell.
"It's a pain in the butt," he
added.
Evaluators hope to get a full pic
ture of the candidate's research and
teaching through the letters and
evaluations that they compile.
"It's very unusual for the docu
ments not to speak with one voice."
Wandell said.
Once the initial materials are
sorted, the tenure committee pres
ents a summary of the materials to a
full department meeting and vote.
All active faculty are allowed to
state opinions and participate in dis
cussion. but voting is restricted to
tenured faculty.
"It is usually a very long meeting,
three or four hours," Wandell said.
"1 wouldn't say it's easy to get a con
sensus."
"The overall assessment is really
one that's come to after a long and
careful consensus," Saldivar added.
If the outcomes of these meet
ings are a decision against tenure,
the emotions involved can run high.
"It's very upsetting to turn some
one down." Wandell said. "These are
people you've worked with, and
when people are turned down, it's
something we all take very hard."
For the professors under evalua
tion. the confidential deliberations
of faculty, department heads and
administrators are out of sight and
mostly out of mind.
"For us it's an opaque process."
said Sociology Prof. Michael
Rosenfeld, who has just received
tenure and will be promoted to
Associate Professor, "it's not really
a process that we go through. You
spend several years building up a
portfolio and making yourself
known."
"My part in this is doing the most
interesting work that I can do and

achieving a reputation so that peo
ple twenty years my senior know
who I am," he added.
Despite the process" opacity,
however, those up for review ensure
that they have planned for the pos
sibility of not earning tenure.
Scholars who do not earn tenure
almost always leave Stanford, both
for reasons of their contract and
their career plans.
"It's not a sure thing, and you
have to have contingency plans,"
Rosenfeld said."When you're up for
tenure you apply for jobs in a few
other places, and you have to do
that."
Even if this planning proves to be
unnecessary. Rosenfeld added that
the process provides valuable
insights.
"Because a lot of the tenure
process depends on what other
scholars think about you. you do
have to consider that community,"
he said, "and one way to do that is to
apply for other positions."
Tenure evaluations in some
departments, too, provide unique
challenges.
"It is an extremely rigorous
process, as one would expect," said
Music Department Chair Stephen
Sano. "Sometimes it can be different
in that there's such a broad range of
what constitutes excellence in schol
arship as opposed to creative output
in performance and as a composer."
"Each discipline has unique chal
lenges," he added. "And part of the
process, and being successful in it as
a department, is understanding what
those challenges are. and addressing
them with transparency so everyone
involved in the process knows what
they're looking for."
Between schools, as well, there
are often differences in the policies
regarding positions and tenure.
"The main difference between us
and the rest of the University is that
tenure and promotion are coupled
together," said Law School Dean
Larry Kramer. "There is an initial
appointment at assistant professor,
and a promotion to associate profes
sor after three years, and when you
earn tenure in the seventh year, you
are a professor."
MAKING THE CUT
The tenure review process, how
ever. is generally regarded as some
thing safe from department politics,
even within departments as compli
cated as those within the Division of
Literatures. Cultures and Languages
[DLCL], which oversees six depart
ments and their respective tenure

reviews.
"Politics between departments in
the division and inside departments
are always at play, and that's
unavoidable," said Assistant
Manager with the DLCL Ryan
Johnson. "But 1 haven't seen any
evidence that it has a significant
impact. Rarely have 1 ever seen any
friction within the division regard
ing personnel cases at all."
In the final stages of evaluation,
the Advisory Board thoroughly
assesses the way the tenure review
was conducted. The Board members
are elected by the Academic
Council for three-year terms and
currently include Professors John
Boothroyd, Microbiology and
Immunology; Patricia Burchat,
Physics; Karen Cook. Sociology;
Harry Elam, Drama; Barbara Fried,
Law; Alan Garber, Medicine and
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell,
Management Science and
Engineering.
"We make sure that those
involved followed University rules
and that all regulations have been
followed." Pate-Cornell said.
Iliere's also a big amount of confi
dentiality. so we can assure that let
ter-writers are protected."
"The Board typically meets
weekly during the academic year,"
said Associate Provost for Faculty
Affairs Megan Pierson in an email
to The Daily. "Recommendations
for Academic Council appoint
ments, reappointments and promo
tions are submitted to the Advisory
Board. The Board performs a sub
stantive and procedural assessment
of each proposed action."
Ultimately, those involved say the
long, difficult process is worth the
effort in ensuring a top-level faculty.
"We're very comfortable with
the process we follow," Saldivar
said. "We believe in its integrity."
And for those who decide to
enter the tenure process at
Stanford, the challenge is part of the
reward.
"The kind of excellence they do
have here is a result of extra vigi
lance." Rosenfeld said."l could have
gone other places where the tenure
process was less opaque, but at
Stanford you can't tell, and because
it's harder they can't give you any
guarantees."
"You have to be made of strong
stuff," he added. "But 1 never felt
like 1 wanted to be some other
place."
