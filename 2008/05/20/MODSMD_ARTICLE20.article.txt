## Lester's triumph a treasure 
### 
With all that's gone wrong in
the sports world this past
month — Spygate reaching
its height, the euthanizing of Eight
Belles on the track at the Kentucky
Derby — it seems fitting for a na
tional feel-good story to emerge.
And it has, in the form of Jon Lester.
Lester is a pitcher for the Boston
Red Sox who entered the league in
2006 as a multi-tooled, left-handed
starter. He was in the midst of a very
good rookie season when he was
sidelined with an injury. But it wasn't
just any ailment: Lester was diag
nosed with anaplastic large cell lym
phoma, a specific form of the cancer
ous non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
While Lester's recovery prospects
were, on the whole, good, baseball
took a back seat. He did not return to
the Red Sox that year, and a
timetable for his return was not set.
His career stood a very good chance
of ending before it really started.
But he battled back, and as his dis
ease entered remission, began to
throw again. He started 2007 in
minor league Class A but was so suc
cessful in his rehab outings that he
made it back to the majors by late
July. He helped the Red Sox wrap up
their seventh championship with a
strong outing in the final game of the
World Series, allowing only three hits
and no runs in over five innings to
earn the win.
That he was able to make such an
authoritative recovery was, in itself, a
minor miracle. It was taken to new
heights last night, when, at age 24.
Lester threw the first no-hitter of his
career.
The young southpaw survival
story was simply spectacular. Lester
struck out nine batters and gave up
only two walks as Boston downed
Kansas City, 7-0.
It is the current apex to a wonder
ful story of revival and determina
tion, of faith and perseverance. It is as
much about baseball as it as about
human life and experience. And it's
something that supporters of all
teams can relish.
As sports fans, we are generally
divided based on our team alle
giances: the Cowboys will always
loathe the Redskins: Cal will hate
Stanford and. in the case of baseball,
the Yankees will despise the Red
Sox.
But there are times when every
one will stand in unison and applaud
— this is one of them. And as a devo
tee of the Bronx Bombers. 1 can say
that this may be the first game in my
lite when 1 haven't been angry over a .
Red Sox win — even if it does drop *
my team an extra half-game behind
the division leaders. On a human
level, it's hard not to recognize the
feat and the monstrous obstacle that
had to be defeated to attain it. Our
ties of local allegiance mean nothing
in times like these.
We can celebrate Lester's accom
plishment together; indeed, we
should. Far too often, the most publi
cized stories are of the most repre
hensible and defaming nature. Base
ball is still reeling from an unre
solved steroids era, and the names
that permeate the news cycles aren't
guys like Lester — they're divisive •
figures like Barry Bonds and Roger
Clemens.
Josh Hamilton and Rick Ankiel's
success stories last season after re
covering from a serious bout with
drugs and a sudden fall from star
dom, respectively, captured the
hearts of baseball fans. But they of
fered just a temporary reprieve from
the scandal du jour, as Ankiel himself
became mired in a mini-HGH scan
dal.
But Lester's tale is here to stay,
and his story is still growing. Who
knows where it might take him? He
could pitch another 20 years, win
more championships and awards and
hurl more no-hitters. His legend
could grow and grow. But even if he
decides to hang up his cleats tomor
row, he will still be an inspiration to
us all.
To cancer sufferers, their families
and the rest of us, he is the model of a
never-give-up attitude, even when
faced with the worst odds.
That is something we can all rallv
behind.
