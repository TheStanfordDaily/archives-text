# Photos return to Old Union
## Exhibit restored after negotiations, changes 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A controversial photo exhibit that
was removed from Old Union last
month has been put back up following
a compromise between the University
and the group Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel (SCAI).
The exhibit, titled "Life Under
Israeli Apartheid," was taken down
Aprilafter Old Union staff received
multiple complaints. After working
with senior University administrators,
SCAI agreed to display the exhibit
with its originally proposed title "1 lope
Under Siege" and new captions.
Ten of the 20 photos will be dis
played in the Old Union lobby with a
biography of the photographer. This
part of the exhibit will display the date
and location of each photo, but it will
not include captions. The other 10 pho
tos will be displayed with captions in a
first floor meeting room.
"It's all very complex," a relieved
sounding SCAI co-President Fadi
Quran 10 said by phone Sunday night,
"but that's what we've reached."
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
unions, and Chris Griffith, associate
vice provost for Student Affairs, made
the ultimate decision not to include
captions for the photos displayed in the
lounge.
Griffith said the decision to put pho
tos back up in the lounge without cap
tions stemmed from a desire to main
tain Old Union as a comfortable com
mon area.

"We wanted to maintain the com
fortable and welcoming environment
in the first floor common lounge area
while providing an interim solution to
the students' request for exhibit space."
she said in an email to The Daily
Monday night."l think we've achieved
that."
From the start, discourse surround
ing the photo exhibit has been mired in
miscommunication.
According to SCAI members, a
group member currently studying in
China planned the exhibit before going
abroad. The student submitted the pho
tos for approval by Old Union staff
winter quarter. SCAI members said the
title change stemmed from a miscom
munication between that student and
other group members who later
assumed responsibility for the project.
SCAI members had assumed they
could include captions with the exhibit
but did not submit them for approval.
When the captions provoked com
plaints, Old Union staff offered to
move the exhibit to White Plaza or
resume the show at Old Union without
captions.
"They decided against pursuing
either option," Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman said last
month.
The exhibit was taken down 48
hours after it was posted.
More than 50 students and commu
nity members marched into Old Union
April 21 to protest the removal, which
