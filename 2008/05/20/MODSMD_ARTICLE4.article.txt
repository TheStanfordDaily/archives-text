## Former president Toledo sees potential in U.S. politics 
### MOHAMMAD ALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The former president of Peru.
Alejandro Toledo, Ph.D. '93, says he
understands Barack Obama's unique
appeal to voters.
On campus this year as a lecturer in
the Freeman Spogli Institute, Toledo has
compared himself to the presumptive
Democratic nominee from Illinois.
"It's [as if] I look to see myself in the
mirror with Mr. Barack Obama," he said

in an interview last week, though he
stopped short of endorsing the Senator.
"There are enormous similarities
[between us], Barack Obama has
appeared in today's political scenario by
a destiny, because one does not choose
that. Our similarity is the unlikeliness [of
our political careers]."
Tlie first democratically elected presi
dent of indigenous descent in Latin
America in 500 years. Toledo spent his
early years in the mountains of Peru. As
a child, he earned money shining shoes

and selling newspapers and lottery tick
ets. I le met Peace Corps volunteers who
guided him in obtaining a scholarship to
America, where he made ends meet
pumping gas. I le went on to serve as a
consultant for several international
organizations and as a visiting scholar at
Harvard.
"In Peru for 500 years, someone with
my ethnic background was never accept
ed to even be a candidate," he continued
in comparing himself to Obama. "I was a
political intruder in the establishment of

politics in Latin America and in Peru."
Toledo, who served as president from
2001 to 2006. described the historic
opportunity for America to regain its
role as a leader in the upcoming election.
"I've been following politics of the
United States for 40 years," he said. "For
the first time in my life, after John F.
Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. [and]
Bobby Kennedy, 1 foresee the potential
for a huge stepping stone and the possi-
bility for the United States, perhaps
without knowing it. to send a clear
message to the world by having a
woman or a non-white man as pres
ident."
Toledo also spoke about Obama's
ability to inspire others when speak
ing.
"I've met a lot of students who
told me they get goosebumps listen
ing to this guy," he said. "I've lis
tened to every speech by him."
The former president also gave
his strongest indication yet that he
will be returning to Peru to run for
office again in 2011.
"I find enormous similarities
with [ObamaJ on the basis of a
dream that we can do together," he
said. "Let me put it this way: there is
a possibility that we might govern
together at the same time."
Toledo further addressed the
criticism of Obama that he is too
inexperienced, citing his own tenure
as president.
"My experience was on-the-job
training," he said.
Before assuming presidency.

Toledo had never run for public
office before. But he emphasized
that this was not necessarily a hand
icap.
"I ve said this publicly — thank
God I did not have a previous expe
rience before I decided to run for
president, because 1 didn't know
what was behind the curtains. So
don't be afraid to vote for someone
that doesn't have experience."
Asked how America can better
engage with the world once a new
president is elected. Toledo said
America should pay attention to a
broader area of the world.
"I hope that the next president
has a view of the world that has a
much wider spectrum, and 1 hope
that the next president will not be so
obsessed only with the Middle East
or the Arab countries," he said.
"There are other parts of the world.
Watch them. Russia. We need to pay
attention to China. We need to pay
attention to India. We need to pay
attention to Latin America."
Toledo was especially concerned
with the United States taking Latin
American countries for granted,
paying attention to them only when
an American national interest was
at stake.
"1 hope the next president will
have a wider view of the world." he

said. "I hope he will have the
courage and the intelligence and the
humbleness to consult and talk to
world leaders before making a deci
sion. I hope the next president will
respect the U.N. as a charter of the
world."
Toledo suggested America's
power does not give it a right to act
without respecting others.
"You may have your tanks, your
planes, your ships, your technology,
but that doesn't make you the
owner of the world," he said. "There
are issues that the leaders of the
world today need to confront that
require the convergence and the
opinions of other people."
"No one is powerful enough to
ignore the rest of the world," he
added.
If Toledo reenters politics, giving
a voice to Latin America will not be
his only drive. To him, inspiring oth
ers has been a motivating force
behind his career.
"To walk in the streets and to be
pulled by the poor, poor ladies and
to hear their dreams about their
children — sthat's incredible," he
said. "To me, that's the most power
ful accomplishment."
