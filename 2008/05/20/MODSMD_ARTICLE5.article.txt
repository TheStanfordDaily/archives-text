## Former editors share secrets of Washington 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two former Daily Editors returned to
campus Monday night to share stories of tire
lessly investigating government workings.
ITiis time around, though, they weren't
talking about reporting on the ASSU.
Phil Taubman '70. associate editor of The
New York Times and former Washington
Bureau Chief, and Rajiv Chandrasekaran '94.
assistant managing editor of the Washington
Post and former Baghdad Bureau Chief, lec
tured about their experiences investigating
Bush Administration missteps.
TAUBMAN
Taubman, who was Editor-in-
Chief of The Daily in 1969, centered
his talk on secrecy in Washington
around a discussion of the story The
Times ran in 2005 exposing the
NSA's warrantless surveillance
activities.
"(Times reporters] James Risen
and Eric Lichtblau came to me and
said that the NSA is listening in on
telephone conversations, without a
court order," Taubman said.
After the two reporters alerted
Taubman, the Bush administration
began to pressure The Times not to
publish the story, as reporting pro
gressed.
"If you don't publish, there's got
to be a damn good reason not to. In
this case, the reasons came immedi
ately and forcefully, and we paid
attention to them," Taubman said.
"They came starting with
Condoleezza Rice, who said that if
you expose this, Americans will die."
Taubman and senior Times edi
tors were convinced by Rice's pitch
in 2004, but a year later, they
changed their minds.
"By the fall of 2005, our thinking
had changed, and the main reason
was that the reporting was complete
by then," Taubman said. "We had
come to understand more about the
operation."
A new understanding that there
was dissent within the Bush admin
istration over the validity of the
NSA program led Taubman and the
Times editors to push forward and
publish the story.
But first, the administration took
one more try at killing the article.
"The culminating meeting was
with the president himself, who
asked [Executive Editor] Bill Keller
and the Publisher Arthur
Sulzberger to come to the Oval
Office." Taubman said. "He made a
very forceful case that we should
not publish it. Bill Keller caught the
spirit of the meeting well — Bush's
message was: you print this, you'll
have blood on your hands."
"We did publish it — Eric and

Jim won a Pulitzer Prize for that
story," Taubman said.
The former Daily editor attrib
uted much of the Bush administra
tion's penchant for secrecy to the
aftermath of 9/11.
"I'm not unsympathetic to the
reaction in Washington to 9/11,"
Taubman said. "There is an
American tendency to shut down
civil liberties and constitutional
rights during crises. It's part of a pat
tern, a xenophobic instinct in our
society. It was compounded by 9/11."
But Taubman suggested that
while the actual crisis might have
come to an end, the secret-keeping
continues.
The journalist ended his remarks
with a reminder for the audience —
the war in Iraq has now gone on
longer than World War 11.
CHANDRASEKARAN
Chandrasekaran, who served as
The Daily's Editor-in-Chief in the
fall of 1993, spoke of his experiences
as The Post's Baghdad Bureau
Chief, the subject of his book
"Imperial Life in the Emerald City."
The allegation leveled by
Chandrasekaran at the Bush admin
istration in his book, and in yester
day's talk, is that a combination of
poor hiring decisions and an insulat
ed Baghdad headquarters led to a
series of poor policy decisions that
ultimately doomed American recon
struction efforts in the country.
"In many cases, the government
just sent the loyal and the willing."
said Chandrasekaran of the person
nel sent to manage Iraq. "They
asked their hires some very blunt
questions — 'are you a member of
the Republican Party,' and 'Did you
vote for George W. Bush in 2004?'"
Chandrasekaran then detailed
several examples of startlingly inept
hiring decisions. Repeatedly, he
exclaimed,"! wish I was making this
up."
The official charged with reopen
ing the Iraqi stock exchange was Jay
Hallen, a 24-year-old who had no
previous securities experience,
Chandrasekaran claimed. A 21-
year-old White House intern was
given an important post in the
Ministry of the Interior.
According to Chandrasekaran,
the ineffectiveness of Iraq's

Coalition Provisional Authority was
compounded by the insulated home
of the temporary government - the
Green Zone.
"The Green Zone was Baghdad's
little America" Chandrasekaran
said. "Iraqi laws and customs didn't
apply in the green zone. Most of the
CPA staff had never worked outside
the U.S., more than half had gotten
their first passport to travel to Iraq,
and they needed the same type of
bubble oil companies built in
Indonesia and Nigeria."
Chandrasekaran described the
Green Zone as "a full-scale occupa
tion by Americans sitting in the
palace drinking beer and eating
bacon."
He also referenced one bureau
crat — given the senior most posi
tion in the healthcare reform group
— who spent his time trying to
establish a co-pay system and an
anti-smoking campaign. This was in
a country home to hospitals
Chandrasekaran described as "the
fifth circle of hell" with people
dying in the hallways.
Although he said several times
that he does not have a solution,
Chandrasekaran said that accepting
the reality of sectarianism and
embracing a federalist structure
would be a realistic way to proceed.
When asked if the Bush adminis
tration's missteps in Iraq stemmed
from malfeasance, Chandrasekaran
disagreed.
"1 haven't come up with any indi
cation that they were actively pursu
ing any kind of divide and conquer
strategy," Chandrasekaran said.
"This can be principally explained by
general incompetence. It seems so
outrageous as to be unbelievable."
While Taubman and
Chandrasekaran have come quite a
long way from their humble begin
nings managing writers in the
Storke Publications Building, not
everything has changed for the two
editors.
According to Chandrasekaran,
The Daily office and Baghdad
aren't too different from each other.
"Running The Daily gives you
early insight in managing a lot of
unruly people in a war zone," he
said.
