here's a stor>' behind the
making of every story. In the
case of "Shake Girl," a
graphic novel released just
J m last week by the Stanford
University Graphic Novel Project, the story be
hind the story is an epic.
The class listing in the Stanford Bulletin was
innocuous enough.
"Interdisciplinary," it read. "Evolution, subject
matter, form, conventions, possibilities and future
of the graphic novel genre. Guest lectures. Collab
orative creation of a graphic novel by a team of
writers, illustrators and designers."
The class title was English 190G:"The Graph
ic Novel." And from the very beginning, this par
ticular class had a mission — to create a graphic
novel through the collaboration of a group of stu
dents and instructors. Last quarter was the first
time such a class had been taught at Stanford.
"We didn't have any model," explained Tom
Kealey, a lecturer in creative writing and one of
the teachers of the course. What participants
could do in the course of a ten-week quarter re
mained to be seen.
Before Winter Quarter began, the applications
for spaces in the course poured in. Forty applica
tions were received, from which the instructors
selected a total of fourteen students. Some of the
students were experienced illustrators; some gift
ed writers; some had little experience with comics
but were effervescent with enthusiasm about the
subject of the class. Fourteen students and two in
structors, plus one Knight Fellow in Journalism
who was auditing the course, made seventeen.
Seventeen companions, embarking on a quest to
create a graphic novel.
One of the students selected was Jessica John
son '08. a student majoring in English with a cre
ative writing emphasis.
"I loved the idea of doing a comic," she said.
"And I liked the idea that some people said we
couldn't do it."
Eric Pape holds one of Stanford's John S.
Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalists.
His interest in the class, he explained, stemmed
from his ongoing imaginings of "the impact of a
graphic novel... the power to get information
out." He felt attracted to the idea that people who
might not be able to read the text of a graphic
novel can derive the story from the pictures, too.
With the team composed, it was time for prep
work. While working to decide what kind of story
they wanted their graphic novel to relate, the stu

was auditing the class, comes into play. Back in
2001. Pape wrote an article about a teenage girl,
Tat Marina, who used to be a karaoke dancer in
Cambodia.
"[She] basically gets drawn into a relationship
... into events way beyond her control," Pape ex
plained. "It's a teenage girl's story of first love." In
this young girl's case, first love ends in acidic vio
lence, in wounds both physically and emotionally
scarring.
After four weeks of hearing the students' de
spairing deliberations about the story they want
ed to tell. Pape presented to them a summary of
the article he had written. Soon after the presen
tation, he said, "the teachers called and said the
class had chosen unanimously." Tat Marina's
story, until now told only in Pape's unpublished
article, would be the subject of the graphic novel.
"The students felt very connected to this
young woman," Adam Johnson remembered. It
mattered to them that "she was real."
"It was the sort of story." Bautista said, "[that]
was just supposed to be told. And this seemed like
the right time to tell it."
And thus, the concept for "Shake Girl" was
born.

With the basic story outline established, the
creation of the novel itself could commence. The
instructors appointed certain students, Jessica
Johnson among them, to act as production man
agers. Students took on responsibilities as writers,
illustrators or both, taking the lessons learned
earlier in the quarter and applying them to a new
found purpose — telling Tat Marina's story.
"It was almost like Adam [Johnson] and I be
came members of the class," Kealey said. "We
helped out as needed."
Bit by bit. act by act, the script was written.The
story's script, described by Adam Johnson as "a
very articulated guide for the illustrators," had to
do more than incorporate the text that would ap
pear in the novel itself. A page of a graphic novel,
not unlike a page from a comic book, is made up
of a series of panels. The script the writers handed
to the illustrators also included concepts for the il
lustrations that would appear in each of the
novel's panels.
Even with Pape's original article from which to
glean details, the writers had to contend with
molding the nonfiction account of Tat Marina's
experiences into novel form.
When Pape interviewed Marina for his article,
her brother translated her speech.
"Her mouth barely worked and she spoke no
English," he said.This presented problems for the
writers because "one of our goals was to give the
main character a voice."
