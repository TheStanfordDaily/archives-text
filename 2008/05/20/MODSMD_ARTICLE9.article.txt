# IT'S NOT SHAKESPEARE
## But student-created graphic novel "Shake Girl" has achieved global fame nonetheless

dents also had to figure out what elements make
up a graphic novel and how a graphic novel is cre
ated.
The class became "a crash course on figuring
out what exactly we were supposed to do," ex
plained Cristina Bautista' 11, a student in the class
and a graphics editor for The Daily.
The students read books about comics. They
completed short introductory projects. For four
weeks, the students met, a couple of hours two
times a week, to acquaint themselves with the
tools and vocabulary of their new trade. They
were also acquainting themselves with each other
— a collaborative undertaking such as this re
quired that they be able to work together.
But when the introductory work was complet
ed, the team came up against its greatest obstacle
yet. It was the fourth week of winter quarter, and
they had yet to decide which story they wanted to
tell.

The decision had been made early on that the
class should not tell a fictional story — a story the
students would have to build from scratch, a story
whose characters and setting and plot they would
have to decide for themselves, before they could
make it into a novel.That path seemed perilous, at
best, even to the optimistic lecturers leading the
class.
"Some people would have wanted super he
roes," laughed Adam Johnson, the course's other
instructor and a lecturer in creative writing.
"Some people would have wanted talking dol
phins."
Kealey chimed in: "I was big on talking dol
phins."
Ehe solution, then, was to limit their ambition.
The class would find a story from the real world
and adapt it to the graphic novel form. Of course,
this too was easier said than done.
"We talked and talked and talked," Jessica
Johnson recounts, "and no one could agree. No
one was happy. Some wanted to write about the
Iraq war; some wanted to create a collection of
myths. Each story had its benefits and its compli
cations.
Here's where that Knight Fellow, the one who

"I LIKED THE
idea that some
people said we
couldn't do it."

The writers were responsible for taking Mari
na's story and creating from that story a character
into whose head they could climb and with whose
voice they could speak.
"The term graphic novel is what we're using
for lack of a better term," Adam Johnson admit
ted. Really, he said, the project is more like "cre
ative nonfiction."
That said, the creative nonfiction still had to fit
within particular parameters dictated by the
evolving form of the graphic novel. For example,
once the students created Tat Marina as she
would exist in their writing, her story would be
told with relatively little written language.
"Telling a story in fewer words was both a chal
lenge and a little bit of a relief," Kealey explained.
With drawings accompanying the text, the writers
didn't "do much description at all," he added.
At the same time, a writer of a graphic novel
has to contend with the idea of page flips — what
image, what text, lies beyond? TTiis is a sort of sus
pense that fiction writers rarely even think about,
a sort of suspense the class had to take on to
achieve drama as the story progressed.
When pieces of the script were completed, the

writing was passed into the hands of the illustra
tors.
"We were each given a section of an act," said
Sara Sisun '09, a Studio Art major. The script, she
explained, would say something like, "Draw two
women, motorcycle, daughter."
From there, the illustrators' work would be cut
out for them. Drawing time ranged, Sisun esti
mated, from "five minutes to draw [Marina's]
face in close-up, or a beer bottle in close-up, to
one to two hours to draw a really intricate scene
of Cambodia."
Initial sketches were done with blue pencil,
then a real pencil. Then the drawings had to be
inked.
"Sometimes we would ink each other's draw
ings," Sisun said, "[to] merge two people's draw
ing styles." Finished drawings were then scanned
into a computer, where layout designers con
structed the pages using InDesign and added the
bubbles to hold the novel's text.
"The word balloons matter a lot," explained
Bautista, who helped with both illustration and
layout."Even just how the word balloons look af
fects how you see [the story]."
The drawing process was laborious in itself,
but the students were also meticulous in getting
every detail right. They sought out photographs
of Cambodian urban environments, and relied
on Pape himself to help make the illustrations
true-to-life.
"1 was sort of the culture-police as much as
possible," Pape said."l would point things out like
... gutters are rare." Sketches were corrected and
redrawn to reflect a Cambodian landscape with
which the students were largely unfamiliar.
"The illustrators were like shamans!" Adam
Johnson exclaimed. The final draft of "Shake
Girl" would contain over 7(X) illustrations.
As the weeks inched forward, tensions ran
high. With fourteen creative students in the room,
conflict didn't end when the plot outline was es
tablished. Sections of the novel, once laid out in
InDesign, were converted into PDF files so the
group could workshop them.
There was. Jessica Johnson explained, the
"sense that it was impossible to satisfy that many
creative voiccs." Students stayed late after class,
racing against the quarter system clock to finish
their project, carving out time around papers and

exams to meet deadlines.
"Sometimes we [as instructors] were cheer
leaders," Kealey said.
"We knew they could do this all along." added
Adam Johnson.
"By end of finals week," Jessica Johnson re
ported proudly,"we had a copy of the book done."
In early May. the completed novel went glob
al. Within one week, the Web site, shakegirl.Stan
ford.edu, received over 10,000 hits from over 70
countries.
Then, last TUesday, several hundred books
were delivered to Kealey and Adam Johnson.
From the cover of each, a young girl with piercing
dark eyes and an orange shirt peers out, half-smil
ing, gripping a glass. Black drips from above her
face. In white smoky letters, the title — "Shake
Girl" is enscribed.
Now the next phase can begin — the hard
copies of the books will be used, according to the
project's website, "to create awareness about the
issues of violence against women, and more specif-

ically, the phenomenon of acid attacks in
Cambodia." Readers are also encour-

aged to donate to various charities
committed to addressing human

rights violations that continue
to occur in Cambodia.

The most rewarding part
of the project, maintained
Jessica Johnson, has been
"being able to say, 'Look, we
did something' ... to do
something real that exists
outside the void of acade
mia."

"In the end," Bautista
said, smiling, "it was worth it.
I'd take the class again."

Burgeoning graphic novel
ists and others seeking adven-

tures and challenges in the realm
of the creative, take note — the

class will he offered again next year.
