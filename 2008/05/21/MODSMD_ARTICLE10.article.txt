## Senate delays making funding decisions Senators to vote next week due to group budget problems 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Iliesday night's Undergraduate
Senate meeting lacked the fire
works of last week's meeting,
which featured a leaked strategy
email and ten consecutive roll call
votes used as stalling tactics.
The senators entertained a
presentation from Stanford
Students for Choice and passed
funding bills.
Meryl Holt '09 and Kate
Benham '09, co-Presidents of
Stanford Students for Choice,
painted a grave picture of what
will happen in June, when a feder
al bill will cause birth control
prices to skyrocket at Vaden.
The Deficit Reduction Act of
2005, which closed a loophole that
allowed for cheap birth control at
university clinics, will cause the
price increase.
"This hasn't hit Stanford yet,
but the stockpile held by Vaden
will run out in June," Holt said.
"Stanford students are really going
to feel it. For some women this is
going to be an increase from $120
to $720 a year."
Benham and Holt asked the
Senate to support them in efforts
to get the University to step in and
subsidize birth control.
"We know that you guys don't
have the funding to actually reme
dy this problem, but we do think
that you guys have a lot of symbol
ic value." Behnam told the Senate.
"If you guys could pass a resolu
tion and help us start this dialogue,
that would be a great help."
Senator Luukas lives '09 esti
mated the cost of subsidizing birth
control at $30,000.

Problems with the budgets for
FanatAXE, along with the
International Undergraduate
Community and Students for
Environmental Justice at Stanford,
led the senators to delay deciding
funding the three groups until next
week's meeting.
While the senators were initial
ly enthusiastic about FanatAXE,
following a brief presentation by
the group's leader, Zachary
Warma '11, SSE Capital Group
Director Chris Elmore '08 warned
of potential financial problems.
Warma said that the group,
which is asking for a $21,000 gen
eral fee transfer, will improve Big
Game Week, try to draw more stu
dents to more sporting events and
hopes to increase fan spirit.
But Elmore had harsh words
for the group's large, unstructured
budget proposal.
"This bill doesn't even tell us
where to put the money," Elmore
said. "You can pass this bill, and
beginning next year we'll put lots
of money into the account, and I'd
be very surprised if the financial
manager said you can't spend any
of this, it's just super-sketchy."
The hot tempers that prevailed
at last week's contentious meeting,
in which lives faced off with
Senate Chair Tiq Chapa '10 over
Appropriations Committee
appointments, had largely cooled
over the last week.
When Elections Commissioner
Ryan Woessner '10 referenced last
week's drama, he drew chuckles
from the senators.
"Basically 1 threw everyone in a
hat and drew," said Woessner
about selecting a senator to partic
ipate on the search committee for
next year's elections commission
er. "That was the process."
