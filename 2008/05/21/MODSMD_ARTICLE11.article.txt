## Editorial Board SPU a welcome addition to campus discourse 
### 
There are very few areas in which Stan
ford is lacking. Until recently, one of
the University's few deficiencies was
the non-existence of an effective debate soci
ety where students, faculty and speakers
could convene to discuss pertinent political
and social issues in an academic, yet colloqui
al, environment.
The members of the newly founded Stan
ford Political Union (SPU) have made the
first important steps toward filling this vital
gap and, unlike some other attempts in the
past, their early endeavors have already met
with success.
SPU's stated mission is to bring togeth
er students and speakers from varying po
litical backgrounds to debate and discuss
"issues that confront our campus, national
and international community." Judging by
the turnout and feedback from its first two
events, SPU is definitely starting off on the
right track to accomplish that mission.
The events are a unique mix of structure
and informality. The speakers and the discus
sion are technically moderated by SPU offi
cers, but everyone shows a great deal of re
spect for legitimate attempts at discourse —
at Monday's event about subsidized birth
control on campus, the moderator was left
silently observing most of the time.
What makes SPU even more unique and
popular is its efforts to involve the public as
much as the invited speakers. Rather than
dominating the discussion, the selected pan
elists merely act as representatives for certain
points of view, as members of the public lob
questions both at the panelists and at each
other.
The overall atmosphere is one of positive
political discussion that, while a little heated
at times, is well-regulated by moderators and
allowed to flourish. The interaction between
panelists and audience members provides for

a wonderful lack of rigidity that allows the
conversation to flow smoothly and presents a
plethora of differing viewpoints. On Monday
engaged and interested students continued
talking with one another well past the end of
allotted 90 minute time period, both with
their allies and political opponents.
The Editorial Board believes that an inte
gral part of maintaining this early success and
fostering even greater discourse across cam
pus is to maintain the informality that these
meetings currently possess — an informality
that allows everyone to speak their piece. This
will doubtlessly become a problem as the audi
ence sizes continue to grow, so it will be up to
SPU officers to creatively figure out how to
keep everyone present as involved as possible.
Furthermore, SPU would do well to keep
cultivating the types of relationships it has al
ready formed with varying aspects of Stan
ford's political spectrum. From The Stanford
Review and The Stanford Progressive, to
Stanford Students for Choice and Stanford
Students Say No to War, SPU has already
managed to pull in a very diverse political col
lective over the course of only two events.
SPU can serve to grow into a fantastic medi
um for these often contentious political
groups to work together and host joint events
that benefit all involved.
The Editorial Board would like to com
mend SPU on its initial efforts and wish the
group the best of luck in the future. We sug
gest that students take every chance they get
to attend one of these events, especially if
they are passionate about the issue being dis
cussed.The Stanford Political Union is an en
joyable, useful and thought-provoking new
student group that helps fill an overlooked
need for effective discourse on campus.
