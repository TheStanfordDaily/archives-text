## Behind the bar at Exotic 
### 
On Saturday I had the distinct honor
to help bartend Exotic Erotic with a
couple of friends. As one of them put
it. we were there to."see what it's like to have
a dozen greedy hands poking your way,
probing eyes begging for a nip of the good
stuff."
Mission accomplished. Let me just say
this: you people are savages. I'm talking
about you. Leopard Print Girl. What the hell
were you doing trying to crawl over the
boxes of cups to rub my shoulder like a
magic lamp, begging "puh-leease!" and
promising you would leave me alone if you
could just cut the line? Or you. Glassy-Eyed
Girl in the Orange Shirt — how did you con
tinuously sneak inside the bar without us
noticing you. and why. once inside, did you
just stand there, swaying back and forth
catatonically? And "savage" was no exag
geration. Take "Brandon and John," two
dashing young fellows in crimson. Hugh
Hefner-style robes who were seen pissing
into cups and leaving them out so people
might drink them by accident. Was this some
kind of homo-social fetish, or do they just get
their kicks from debasing other people?
For the occasion, we were asked to show
up at 9 p.m.. when the police cleared all the
residents out of 680 Lomita. Obviously the
police were hoping to avoid the debacle that
occurred my freshman year, when some
guys who were sick of waiting in line
knocked down the fence in the back corner
of the yard.
Since undergrads aren't allowed to bar
tend Exotic — "bartend," by the way, is a lu
dicrous overstatement — my friends and 1
were joined by a guy who had graduated
four years ago, and his earnest-looking
younger brother.The alum was a hedge fund
analyst, and he never offered a convincing
explanation for what he was doing back at
Exotic — he claimed to already have a girl
friend, after all.
At 10 p.m. the first revelers entered, and
at 10:20 p.m. it was still mostly freshmen,
who were content to hover around the bar
and fight over the neon glo-bands. Around
10:30. however, the over-21 crowd showed
up, and we spent the rest of the night on our
heels.
"I need cups! Cup, goddammit!" we
shouted, cries reminiscent of Corporal
Upham's tardy re-supply of ammo belts in
the finale of "Saving Private Ryan."
At the risk of sounding like an old crank,
this was a truly lackluster year for costumes.
Guys, wearing board shorts or boxers is not
only uncreative; it's a surefire sign of insecu
rity. (My freshman year, a student wore only
a trombone, fastened with a belt, to hide his
business.) Girls, why put on a bikini top

when there are plenty of more interesting
and humorous things that you could wrap
around or tape to your midriff? 1 pine for the
days when, as a young freshman lad, you
could show up to Exotic in a jock strap and
bike helmet and go home with a Branner
RA (which happened to one of my former
roommates).
By 11:30 p.m., the hedge fund guy had
wandered off to lord-knows-where, and we
were desperately understaffed. It didn't help
that the same people kept coming back
every two minutes with their empty cups. In
fact, the biggest surprise of the night was
how few people we interacted with. I'd guess
that we served about 70 percent of the beer
to the same fifteen or twenty people (usual
ly guys) who returned again and again — I
wondered if their friends weren't paying
them to wait in line because surely it can't be
fun to serve as the beer-lackey for an entire
party.
One of our three kegs was devoted to the
group of football players who had camped
out on the steps next to the bar. There they
sat for most of the evening, muttering in low
voices, scratching their barrel-chests and sul
lenly draining cup after cup of cheap lager.
By 1:15 a.m. the party began winding
down. Police slowly but surely began cor
ralling the last revelers out. while the saddest
sacks stumbled about, hoping the party
wouldn't end.
"Have you seen my phone?" a nasally
freshman whined, his girlfriend in tow. "It's
black."
"No, come back tomorrow."
"You're sure you haven't seen it?" he
asked, his eyes nearly welling up with tears.
"It's a Nokia."
"Please just go home," we sighed, our
brows damp and our pant cuffs soaked in
Keystone.
A skinny man, wearing a pair of white
briefs, stumbled over and began surrepti
tiously drinking half-finished beers. Natural
ly, we assumed he would want to be alone
during this difficult time in his life, and so we
left.

Brendan Selby hus never had so many people
try to make eye contact with him. Give him
