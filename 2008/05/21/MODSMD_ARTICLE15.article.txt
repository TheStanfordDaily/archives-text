## Joel Stein Self-Realization by 900 numbers 
### 
It looked like it would be a summer like all
the rest. Afternoons spent outside with
friends, gaily tossing Frisbees to and fro
while happily roasting decaying animal flesh
in the cool Jersey air.
But as the summer began to approach
quickly I began to realize something: I had no
job.
And I had honestly tried. I made innumer
able trips to Kinko's to put my internship ap
plications on the just-perfect, professional
looking, 12-cent bonded paper. But nothing
materialized, except for this thing at Playboy,
and, well, let's just say it didn't pay.
But the time school got out in June, my
odds of landing a prestigious mall job were
lower than my junior-high-school-aged sis
ter's. And even though she was at sleep-away
camp, the depression-era competition was
still way too stiff.
It looked like 1 would be doing what every
other rich, privileged, I-don't-know-how
much-room-and-board-is-because-I-just-
send-the-bill-home-to-my-parents Stanford
student experiences during the summer.
It looked like I would be working for my
dad.
I pictured walking into the office, with my
long hair and undeserved upper-echelon
telemarketing job and seeing all the secre
taries in their make-up splattered spandex
concoctions which they call style. And I
would know what was going on in their
minds: It's the boss' son.That's why he got the
job He can get away with whatever he wants,
even that awful haircut. I say we hang him,
then we tar and feather him and then we
make him our personal sexual slave ...
But then just when it seemed like the fan
tasy was picking up, I noticed a sign on the
front door of The Daily office:
"Internship available in Paradise, CA.
Contact Communication Department for de
tails."

Paradise. It sounded so beautiful. So an
gelic. So far away from my new spandex dom
inatrices in Jersey City.
This would mean not seeing all my high
school friends. This would mean not seeing
my family. This would mean not seeing that
guy on the corner of 38th and Lex. who does
that cool thing with the roach clips and the pi
geons.

It looked like I
would be
working for
my dad.

But I was growing up and 1 had to put all
of that behind me. Or at least in Paradise.
So with two weeks left before finals, I
packed up my pillow, blanket, Interplak
toothbrush, mint-flavored, unwaxed dental
floss and my Act Dental Rinse and headed
out to be a new reporter for Paradise.
Driving towards my new Chico home that
I had located through a want-ad in a local
newspaper, I epiphonized that as nervous as
I was, I was finally free. I made out the check

for my new apartment. I would pay for every
thing with the money I was making. And I
would be the one responsible for remember
ing to put the Snack Pack in my lunch box.
And the freedom was going to take place
in Chico - a town ruled and controlled by the
top-rated party school in the nation, accord
ing to Playboy magazine. The revenge on my
bunny-clad friends seemed too perfect.
But as I pulled over to ask three large,
bare-chested, drunken males where my
apartment was, and they informed me that I
lived in a complex widely-known as 'The
Zoo," I found myself forced to question my
freedom.
Laying myself down on my lumpy, Bud
weiser-sheeted mattres (They left off the
extra "s" for savings), cuddled up with my In
terplak and copy of "Being and Nothing
ness," I discovered that 1 was very lonely.
There were no dormmates, no one to tuck
me in at night, no one to play knick-knack on
my knees with.
Eventually I made friends, and I cooked
tofu and zucchini ad infinitum, and by the
second week I had built my own little post-5
p.m. niche in life.
But no matter how much fun I was having
in my self-imposed pseudo-adult asylum, I
couldn't avoid the nagging realization that
life outside this hollow shell of love that we
call college is a bit lonely. Every so often, late
at night, I would find myself furtively glanc
ing at the phone whenever the 900 number
flashed on my screen and that seemingly om
niscient blonde woman with the half-unbut
toned blouse would say, "Go ahead, 1 think
you'll be glad you did."
But, luckily, I'm more scared of not gradu
ating.
