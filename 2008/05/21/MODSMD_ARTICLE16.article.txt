The Conference Champi
onship round of the NBA
playoffs is underway, and a
prospective nightmare scenario has
taken shape for David Stern and
fans of the Association everywhere
that can be summed up in two
words: Spurs-Pistons.
A San Antonio win over the Los
Angeles Lakers in the Western
Conference coupled with a Detroit
victory over the Boston Celtics in
the Hast wouldn't just be bad for
the league; it would be a near disas
ter.
After a season replete with
amazing storylines from coast to
coast — from the rebirth of the
Celtics to the rise of the Hornets
and new superstar point guard
Chris Paul to the Pau Gasol trade
that rejuvenated the Lakers and
Kobe Bryant's career in L.A. — a
Pistons-Spurs match-up in the fi
nals would be a slap in the face to
literally millions of fans who were
convinced that the NBA was back
in a big way.
In short, it would be boring. Not
just boring like a baseball game in
mid-May can be, or like a Bud Selig
press conference either, but boring
in the mind-numbingly awful way
that only the Pistons and Spurs
could pull off. Boring in the kind of
way that I wouldn't even want to
watch the highlights on ESPN un
less I'd had a strong cup of coffee
just beforehand to keep me awake.
Boring in the kind of way that must
have David Stern tossing and turn
ing at night, as he prays for the sexy
L.A.-Boston rivalry to be reborn.
Yes, a Celtics-Lakers showdown
would be absolutely ideal for the
league at this point, and Stern no
doubt knows it. The star power is
there with Kobe and Garnett and
Co. The markets are huge and the
rivalry is historic. And there's defi
nitely a possibility that neither
Boston nor L.A. will advance be
yond this round.
To be honest, we probably
should have seen this threat com
ing. The Spurs have proven time
and again that they know how to
ramp up their intensity in the post
season and always come through
when it counts, while the Pistons
have been the most consistent
threat to win the East for most of
the last decade.
And yet. as Chris Paul and the
Hornets looked more and more like
a force to be reckoned with in the
West,giving the Spurs all they could
handle time and again and even
putting them against the ropes a
time or two. there was reason to
hope that at the very least the West
ern Conference Champions would
bring an exciting brand of basket
ball to the Finals.
But no more.
And so, the nation outside of San
Antonio and Detroit (and those
girls from my freshman dorm who
thought Manu Ginobili was the
cutest human being ever and made
sure the rest of the world knew it) is
left to hope that Kobe and Pau and
KG and Pierce can pull through in
their respective series to give us
something worth watching. After all
the trouble Boston had overcoming
the Cavaliers in the East, I'm not
holding out much hope for them.
ITiey'll have the home-court advan
tage and not much else going for
them in their match-up with the Pis
tons. a team that has been there be
fore and knows how to win. The
Celtics did just take game one.
though, so they may just make it to
the Finals after all.
The Lakers-Spurs match-up, on
the other hand, seems much more
compelling.True, the Lakers would
n't appear to have anyone who can
guard Tim Duncan, but there prob
ably isn't a player in the league who
can guard a healthy Kobe, and
probably not a player on the Spurs
who can guard an injured one.
Of course, it's always at this
point in a column ripping the Spurs
or the Pistons that the author has to
point out that the fact we find them
boring is more of an indictment
about today's sports-viewing public
than the teams themselves.The Pis
tons play solid, team-oriented, de
fensive-minded basketball, and the
Spurs are much the same. Indeed.
