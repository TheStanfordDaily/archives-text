## Quarterback Questions For card Four most likely candidates previewed as team shapes up for 2009 season 
### DENIS GRIFFIN AND CHRISTOPHER P. ANDERSON SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
With spring sports on the Farm
winding down, it's only natural to
take a look ahead towards the fall
and the Cardinal's second season
under head coach Jim Harbaugh.
As one might expect, given Har
baugh's past as a quarterback him
self at Michigan and in the NFL, the
position is of prime importance in
making sure the program continues
to take positive steps forward in
2008. As one might not expect —
given rising senior Tavita Pritchard's
noted success against Pac-10 power
house USC and arch-rival Cal — the
starting job still seems largely up for
grabs heading into the summer.
It's likely that a starter won't be
named until just before the season
kicks off,given the similar skill sets of
all involved, meaning that the of
fense overall should remain relative
ly unchanged no matter who starts at
QB. Still, the sooner a starter is
named, the sooner he can begin de
veloping chemistry with other key
players on the Cardinal offense and
getting the lion's share of the reps in
practice.
With the competition primed to
heat up in the coming months head
ing into the "08 season, here is a
breakdown of the potential candi
dates to fill the most important start
ing job on the roster for the Cardinal
next year, listed by name and their
year as of next season:
Tavita Pritchard, Junior
Pritchard led the Cardinal to one
of the greatest upsets in college foot
ball history on Oct. 6 against USC.

I lis mobility and athleticism are cer
tainly points in his favor, although
they were rarely featured last season
as Stanford couldn't afford to lose
Pritchard to an injury given the
teams thin depth at quarterback. He
also has an advantage in the experi
ence department, being the only
Stanford QB returning with signifi
cant game-day experience in the sys
tem. Inconsistent play, however,over
the full course of last season has
landed Pritchard in an open fight to
retain his spot as a starter.
Jason Forcier, Junior
A transfer from Michigan before
the 2007 season. Forcier had to sit out
last year due to NCAA rules but will
have two years of athletic eligibility
remaining starting this fall. Given
Michigan's reputation for churning
out solid pro quarterbacks and Har
baugh's own roots at the university,
Forcier has the background to make
himself more than a mere dark-horse
candidate for a starting role, and he
has looked athletic and strong
armed in team workouts. Forcier left
the Wolverines when he was beaten
out by freshman Ryan Mallett for the
backup role behind the since-depart
ed Chad Henne. Ironically. Mallett
left Michigan for Arkansas, which
could have cleared the way for Forci
er had he stayed.
Alex Loukas, Junior
While somewhat of an unknown
to most fans, strong rumors have
Loukas currently leading the field in
the competition for the starting spot
after spring practices. A dual threat
to run or throw, Loukas has yet to

Stanford junior Tavita Pritchard quarterbacked the miraculous October 6 victory at USC and appears to be the front
runner for the starting job next season. However, he still a long way from locking up the job.
