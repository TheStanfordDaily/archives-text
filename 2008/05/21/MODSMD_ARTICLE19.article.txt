game skid with a 6-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies
on TUesday night.

Bengie Molina finished 3-for-4 with
an RBI double in the first that was
originally ruled a home run before he
was placed back at second after the

the hand of a fan above the yellow
home run line,causing the ball to rico

Rowand's bloop single to left brought
in Molina, staking the team to an early
2-0 lead. Rowand finished the night 2-
for-5 with two RBIs.

quadriceps muscle on April 29. He
said he hasn't experienced anymore
pain from the injury,but doesn't know
when he'll be back. The second-year

Star break as the Rockies take a cau
tious approach with his recovery.
