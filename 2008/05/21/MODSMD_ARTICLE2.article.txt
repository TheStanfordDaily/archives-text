# GETTING IT DONE

### BY DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whenever Cardinal
softball needs a
pickup. Missy
Penna delivers.
She did it again
last weekend, coming through in
the biggest way when the team
needed her most.
Instead of panicking with
Stanford facing elimination at
the Amherst Regional — and
the end of her junior season —
the star pitcher went out and
threw a no-hitter against a team
that had beaten her just hours
earlier to lead the Cardinal into
the Super Regionals.

Penna struck out nine in the
complete game, hut more
importantly, she absolutely
demoralized the University of
Massachusetts Minutewomen.
Her performance left no doubt
that, as long as she is pitching,
Stanford can beat anyone.
"She is definitely a clutch
player," said sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill. "She knew what she
had to do and the adjustments
she had to make and did a good
job of going out there and get
ting them."
Head coach John Rittinan
raved about the performance of
his ace.

She showed a lot of heart in keeping her composure
after a tough loss."
Iliis composure is part of Penna's effectiveness. She
retires her opponents with a cool, calm demeanor in
the circle. You won't see her pumping her fist or
screaming at teammates — she lets her pitching do the
talking. Possessing excellent command on a variety of
pitches, she makes it near impossible for opponents to
get comfortable in the batter's box.
It is because of this levelheaded approach that
Penna was able to stay calm going into the decisive
game of the Regional.
"1 knew if I did my job and kept them off the bases,
my team would score runs and we would win." said
Penna.
Rittman sees Penna's stoic approach as her form of
leadership.
"Missy leads by example." he said. "She works ex
tremely hard and everything she says to her team
mates, she means, and she truly believes we will win
every time out."
Pitching games like that is nothing new to Penna
who threw her second no-hitter of the year — and
has put up absolutely phenomenal numbers all sea
son. So far this season she has a school-record 37 wins
and 411 strikeouts while boasting an ERA of just
1.00.
Penna has also become a workhorse for the Cardi
nal. having pitched all four games in the Regional and
327.2 innings on the year.
Despite the mileage, Penna still feels strong.

When asked if she can feel an effect on her stamina,
Penna smiled and simply said, "not yet."
That's a good thing, because with the team heading
to College Station, Texas to take on Texas A&M in a
three-game Super Regional. Penna will likely be asked
to pitch every inning against the No. 5 overall-seeded
Aggies.
"I don't foresee any problem [with her pitching that
much]," said Rittman. "She is used to the workload
from the Pac-10 season, plus she is used to the heat
from growing up in Miami."
Penna corroborated her coach's claims, and
added that she is extremely excited to be pitching in
the hot weather she got used to growing up in South
Florida, instead of the rain she was subjected to in
Massachusetts last weekend.
Penna knows the challenge will not necessarily
be pitching so much, but being able to adjust as the
opponents become more familiar with each other.
"In the first game 1 have to go at them and learn
their strengths and weaknesses so I can make ad
justments as the series continues," said Penna.
On a team in which the hitting has sometimes
looked unstoppable, and at other times has disap
peared. Penna has been the one consistent cog.
The Cardinal will ride her into the weekend, and
if she continues to pitch the way she has been, Stan
ford could soon be punching its ticket to Oklahoma
City and the College World Series.
