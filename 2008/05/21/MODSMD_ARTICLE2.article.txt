# GETTING IT DONE
## 
### BY DANIEL BOHM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whenever Cardinal
softball needs a
pickup. Missy
Penna delivers.
She did it again
last weekend, coming through in
the biggest way when the team
needed her most.
Instead of panicking with
Stanford facing elimination at
the Amherst Regional — and
the end of her junior season —
the star pitcher went out and
threw a no-hitter against a team
that had beaten her just hours
earlier to lead the Cardinal into
the Super Regionals.

Penna struck out nine in the
complete game, hut more
importantly, she absolutely
demoralized the University of
Massachusetts Minutewomen.
Her performance left no doubt
that, as long as she is pitching,
Stanford can beat anyone.
"She is definitely a clutch
player," said sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill. "She knew what she
had to do and the adjustments
she had to make and did a good
job of going out there and get
ting them."
Head coach John Rittinan
raved about the performance of
his ace.
