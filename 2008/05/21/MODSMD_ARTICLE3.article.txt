## Green dorm faces delay Two-year delay in fundraising sets back design for new dorm 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's innovative Green Dorm proj
ect is slated to be designed in detail later this
summer, after a two-year delay in fundrais
ing.
"We essentially took two years longer to
fundraise than we anticipatedsaid Jonas
Ketterle '08, student coordinator for the proj
ect. Ketterle partially attributed the delay to
other campus construction.
"The University is in a big construction
phase right now, and there are many larger
projects," he said, referring to the new Y2E2
building. Mlinger Graduate Residences, the
Stanford Stadium renovations and the
upcoming project for a new Graduate School
of Business. "All of that takes priority."
Civil and Environmental Engineering
(CEE) Prof. Richard Luthy said the funding
is now in place for design to begin.
"The good news is that most of the fund
ing is in place to start detailed design, which
should begin later this summer," he said.
"This would continue through part of the
next academic year in order to continue stu
dent involvement."
The original fundraising goal for the
building was $12 million, but according to
School of Engineering Senior Associate

Dean Laura Breyfogle, "the faculty would
also like to raise an additional $3 million to
fund tech support and tech renewal in the
dorm."
The funding for the project, according to
Ketterle, has come from a variety of
University sources and private donors.
"The project has been met with consider
able enthusiasm among donors and we are
making good progress toward our funding
goals" Breyfogle added.
Since the project is pioneered in large part
by students, some have expressed concern
about the consequences of leading students
graduating.
"I'm graduating, but I'm sticking around
for a master's degree for another few years,"
Ketterle said, "so I'll probably be here to see
the project through its completion. And oth
ers are still going to be on campus [too]."
Ketterle is joined in leading the project by
Mike Linn, a recent graduate, as well as Jen
Tobias '08, Nick Enge '09, who writes a col
umn for The Daily, and Sam Ramirez '10. The
students, who said they invest a lot of time
and energy into the project, were quick to
note that the CEE department and many
others have been helpful.
"It's a collaborative effort," Ketterle said.
"There's a Green Dorm Committee that has
engineers, an architect, different consulting
groups, different particulars system such as
electrical or water or who knows what, [and]
then there's professors, there's people from
