# Hoover photo error found
## American soldier mislabeled 10 photographs, mistake discovered after used in alumnus' book 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A collection of photographs housed at the
Hoover Institution has recently become a source
of a minor international controversy.
Ten photographs housed at the Hoover
Archives purported to show the aftermath of the
1945 atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima. The pho
tographs showed scenes of devastation and
destruction, including human bodies — a relative
rarity in Hiroshima photography. Sean Malloy
Ph.D. '02. an assistant professor of history at UC-
Merced, obtained the photographs from the
Hoover Archives for illustrative use in his book,
entitled "Atomic Tragedy: Henry L. Stimson and
the Decision to Use the Bomb against Japan." The
photographs drew attention after Malloy put
them on the Internet in late April, and received
coverage in the French newspaper Le Monde on
May 10.
Only one problem — the photographs actually
depicted devastation following the 1923 Kanto
Earthquake.
Malloy received information from the

Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on May 12
that convinced him the photographs were actually
of the earthquake aftermath. Malloy pulled the
photographs from his Web site and contacted his
publisher, I loover and Le Monde to inform them
of the error. On May 14 both Hoover and Le
Monde printed statements regarding the error.
Malloy explained that the photographs' human
dimension initially drew him to the photographs.
"They were, in many ways, quite unique,"
Malloy said. "The vast majority of photographs
taken are months after and do not contain peo
ple."
"Certainly they were striking," he added,
"though obviously in retrospect it was too good to
be true."
The context in which he encountered the pho
tographs also gave him confidence in their authen
ticity. The photographs themselves are in the
Archives' Robert Capp collection. Capp — an
American soldier — described the photographs in
an accompanying oral history as photographs
from after the Hiroshima bombing. Prior to the
controversy, the collection's catalog summary
read: "Sound recording of interview, photographs

and miscellany, relating to the aftermath of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. Includes
photographs of devastation and of bodies of vic
tims after the bombing."
Since the information has come to light.
Hoover has substantively changed the last sen
tence in its entry on Socrates, which now reads:
"Also includes photographs of victims of the
Tokyo earthquake of 1923." While Socrates is con
sidered the primary search tool for Hoover, both
the main entry cards and subject reports within
the archives themselves continue to list the cata
log with its prior, inaccurate description, as of yes
terday afternoon.
The collection is relatively small, and besides
the photographs of the human bodies there are
only photographs of rubble, Capp and his brother,
along with some of his insignia.
"With a little collection we tend to believe the
donor," said Hoover Assistant Archivist Carol
Leadenham.
Hoover contains over 5,600 collections with
hundreds of thousands of individual items. The
