# Hoover photo error found
## American soldier mislabeled 10 photographs, mistake discovered after used in alumnus' book 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A collection of photographs housed at the
Hoover Institution has recently become a source
of a minor international controversy.
Ten photographs housed at the Hoover
Archives purported to show the aftermath of the
1945 atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima. The pho
tographs showed scenes of devastation and
destruction, including human bodies — a relative
rarity in Hiroshima photography. Sean Malloy
Ph.D. '02. an assistant professor of history at UC-
Merced, obtained the photographs from the
Hoover Archives for illustrative use in his book,
entitled "Atomic Tragedy: Henry L. Stimson and
the Decision to Use the Bomb against Japan." The
photographs drew attention after Malloy put
them on the Internet in late April, and received
coverage in the French newspaper Le Monde on
May 10.
Only one problem — the photographs actually
depicted devastation following the 1923 Kanto
Earthquake.
Malloy received information from the

Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on May 12
that convinced him the photographs were actually
of the earthquake aftermath. Malloy pulled the
photographs from his Web site and contacted his
publisher, I loover and Le Monde to inform them
of the error. On May 14 both Hoover and Le
Monde printed statements regarding the error.
Malloy explained that the photographs' human
dimension initially drew him to the photographs.
"They were, in many ways, quite unique,"
Malloy said. "The vast majority of photographs
taken are months after and do not contain peo
ple."
"Certainly they were striking," he added,
"though obviously in retrospect it was too good to
be true."
The context in which he encountered the pho
tographs also gave him confidence in their authen
ticity. The photographs themselves are in the
Archives' Robert Capp collection. Capp — an
American soldier — described the photographs in
an accompanying oral history as photographs
from after the Hiroshima bombing. Prior to the
controversy, the collection's catalog summary
read: "Sound recording of interview, photographs

and miscellany, relating to the aftermath of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. Includes
photographs of devastation and of bodies of vic
tims after the bombing."
Since the information has come to light.
Hoover has substantively changed the last sen
tence in its entry on Socrates, which now reads:
"Also includes photographs of victims of the
Tokyo earthquake of 1923." While Socrates is con
sidered the primary search tool for Hoover, both
the main entry cards and subject reports within
the archives themselves continue to list the cata
log with its prior, inaccurate description, as of yes
terday afternoon.
The collection is relatively small, and besides
the photographs of the human bodies there are
only photographs of rubble, Capp and his brother,
along with some of his insignia.
"With a little collection we tend to believe the
donor," said Hoover Assistant Archivist Carol
Leadenham.
Hoover contains over 5,600 collections with
hundreds of thousands of individual items. The
Institution's Assistant Director
Richard Sousa indicated that the
size of the holdings prevented a
thorough authenticity check of all
archived material.
"Our goal is not to authenticate
every piece of information we get,"
Sousa said. "But we do document, in
each case, where it came from. We
do not go through and cross-refer
ence every single piece of material."
"I'd he surprised if the Library' of
Congress did that, or any big
archive," he added.
Sousa also said Hoover will not
be changing its policies for examin
ing its material, and Leadenham said
that the scholarly community is
expected to help verify materials
themselves.
"The basic principle of archival
work is 'caveat emptor' — buyer
beware," Leadenham said.
Le Monde correspondent Sylvain
Cepel, who wrote both the newspa

"The basic
principle is...
buyer beware."

per's initial report on the photo
graphs and subsequent pieces in the
wake of the correction, said that a
catalog description from an institu
tion like Hoover implied the materi
als had been checked for accuracy.
"If you go to the Library of
Congress," Cepel said, "and you find
some letter by Eisenhower, and it's
written on the box, 'this is a letter of
Eisenhower's,' you would not think
this is not by Eisenhower but by
Adlai Stevenson!"
"When 1 have the proof that
Hoover has written, 'these are pho
tos from there,' 1 believe them," he

added.
In the case of Malloy's book, the
photographs were incidental to his
argument and were included after
he had completed his manuscript.
"The argument of my hook isn't
based on a photograph," \1 alloy
said.
Malloy added that the experience
has provided lessons for his future
scholarship.
"This experience has really high
lighted the difference of working on
documents without words," Malloy
said. "With a document with words,
you can interrogate those words."
History Professor Barton
Bernstein, who was Malloy's Ph.D.
advisor, emphasized that mistakes
are a fact of life for scholarship.
"While getting the picture wrong
is a mistake, the argument is not
affected," Berstein said. "The funda
mental fact is one of destruction and
death."
"In mistakes that get caught in
scholarship, this is comparatively
insignificant," he added.
