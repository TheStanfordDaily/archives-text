## CFO explains handling of University debt Debt instruments issued primarily to finance facility capital projects 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the recent U.S. economic decline, scores
of colleges and universities across the nation have
been facing a sharp rise in interest payments on
their large debts. According to the 2007 Annual
Report, Stanford currently has approximately
$1.5 billion of debt outstanding.
Randy Livingston, vice president for business
affairs and the University's chief financial officer,
explained that Stanford issues debt primarily to
finance facility capital projects, such as new build
ing projects or the addition, renovation and
repairs of existing buildings, services and equip
ment. These debts are described as debt instru
ments and usually come in the form of loans from
banks, bonds, certificates, mortgages, leases or

other such agreements.
"Although we receive many gener
ous gifts to fund new facilities, the gifts
are rarely sufficient to pay the entire
cost of a new building." he said. "The
gap is funded either with University

debt or unrestricted cash reserves when avail
able."
He added that the University also uses the
debt to fund major building renovations and cer
tain major equipment purchases as well as to pro
vide mortgages to faculty to assist them in pur
chasing homes.
Variable-interest demand notes and auction
rate securities are two popular methods colleges
use to finance their long-term debt. Variable
interest demand notes are loans for which the
rate of interest is subject to change. When such a
change occurs, the monthly payment is adjusted
to reflect the new interest rate. Auction-rate secu
rities are loans for which the banks hold weekly
or monthly auctions to set the interest rates and
give holders the option of selling the securities. In

February,
a number of these auctions failed and the banks
also refused to support the auctions.
The collapse of the auction-rate debt market
forced universities to restructure millions of dol
lars of debt, as the interest payments doubled or
in some cases tripled beyond what officials had
budgeted. Stanford, too, was impacted by the col
lapse of the auction-rate debt market in February.
According to Livingston, the University had
approximately $318 million of auction-rate secu
rities outstanding.
"One of our debt instruments went from
approximately three percent interest rate to eight
percent within a week." he said. ITie change in
interest cost the University nearly $180,000.
