The Beatles' "Love Me Do" and Diana Ross' "I'm Coming Out" echoed from boom-box speakers as several dozen LGBT students
and their supporters gathered in White Plaza yesterday to celebrate the California Supreme Court's decision to allow same-sex mar
riages in the state. The event followed the tradition of Stanford Queer-Straight Alliance's annual "Freedom to Marry Day," which
includes mock wedding ceremonies in White Plaza. Organizers unfurled a banner in White Plaza that read, "Freedom to (Actually)
Marry."
