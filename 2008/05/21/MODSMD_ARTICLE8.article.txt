## Exotic Erotic Part I: Naked 
### MARISSA MILLER MANAGING EDITOR 
"Matti's been working nonstop," whispers
Wendi Goh '09, 680 s kitchen manager. Her eyes
trace the path he paces about the room. "It's his
baby."
In keeping with the theme — Exotic Erotic:
Hypnotic Rave — the hallway has been lined with
black butcher paper and spray-painted with sug
gestive graffiti. Ilie fluorescent graffiti ranges
from the unsurprising ("penis") to the hostile
("blow me XX"), to the slightly puzzling ("consen
sual sex").

"Matti's been
WORKING NONSTOP.
It's his baby."
— WENDI GOH '09

I lirpa snaps his phone shut and gestures silent
ly to the lounge, where a shirtless resident is busy
twisting glow sticks into bracelets. The boy looks
up briefly, then returns to his task.
"It's all gonna glow," says Hirpa. He folds his
arms across his chest, pausing for a moment to sur
vey the scene. "It's going to look amazing."
►P * *
By dinnertime, campus is quiet. The afternoon
heat still lingers in the air,but the sun is sinking be
neath the trees, bathing Mayfield in cool, blue
shadows. In the corner of the sky, a pale silhouette
of a moon appears.
Hirpa and three other residents are setting up
barricades when Alison Pena arrives from the Of
fice of Student Affairs (OSA).
"The lines should fit no more than two people
standing side-by-side," orders Hirpa. His aviators
hang around his neck, dangling from the string of
a red staff nametag. Wiping sweat from his brow,
he turns to Pena.
"Hey," Hirpa calls.
Pena makes the OSA look good. Deeply
tanned, with short, reddish-brown hair and glasses,
she greets Hirpa with a broad smile. As Stanford's
Assistant Fire Marshall, it's her job to make sure
the party doesn't end with 680 going up in flames.
In her hands is a clipboard, a pair of scissors and a
plastic, orange lighter.
"You ready for this?" she asks.

I lirpa nods, looking slightly apprehensive.
Pena Hips through her papers, making notes as
she walks through the house. When she reaches
the graffitied wallpaper, she bends down and cuts
a small, black swatch. Hirpa leads her outside,
where the two are joined by Goh and Carolyn
Celio '08, the dorm's financial manager.
"Do you understand how nervous 1 am right
now?" Celio laughs, clutching Goh for support.
"I'm literally shaking."
For the last hour. Celio has been double- and
triple- coating the walls with flame retardant.The
air around her smells faintly of chemicals.
Pena holds her lighter up to the paper. For a
moment, yellow flames dance along the corner,
and then — they disappear. She flicks the lighter
again, but the paper won't burn.
"Perfect," she says, and Celio lets out a whoop.
I lirpa breathes a sigh of relief.
* * *
Before anyone realizes it, the sun has set. The
orange glow disappears, and the sky fades to indi
go. The streetlamps flicker on, as the cool, night air
washes over 680. The lights on Hoover are tiny,
white pinpricks.
The house is now chaos, within and without. In
the hallway, police officers, fire marshals and
EMTs brush past residents, who slowly make their
way outside.
On the house's front steps, Leah Leff'oB,6Bo's
Resident Assistant, has marshaled her residents.
In an elaborate pink and green tutu, she barks out
name after name, assigning each to a shift: Sober
monitor. 10 to 11 .Ticket-taker, 11 to 12. Fire-alarm
guard, 12 to 1.
" This is really, really crucial," she yells, and the
crowd quiets down. "During your shift — if you
have to go to the bathroom — HOLD IT IN."
For campus security, this is just another day on
the job. Another year, another Exotic Erotic and
another group of rowdy, reckless college kids.
The officers cluster in the front, about to fan out
through the house. They hold flashlights up to
their maps, squinting to read in the darkness.
"It's almost like I was here yesterday," adds one
dryly under his breath, glancing over at the house.
"Oh, wait — 1 was."
Out in the parking lot, Pena waves a cheerful
goodbye to the Palo Alto fire engine.
"See you next week!"she laughs."Next party!"
Inside the house, a team of EMTs in blue winds

E
A, ji veryone is naked.
Well, almost naked. It's late Friday afternoon,
the day of Exotic Erotic, but the temperature still
hovers around 95. Already, the landscape is a mo
saic of flesh: hare, brown arms toss a frisbee across
the Oval: pink, freckled shoulders peer from be
neath black bikini straps. Bowing to the heat wave,
students take the night's dress code — one piece
of clothing for men. two for women — to heart.
Up on the row. sweaty Sigma Chis unload kegs
from a van. preparing for Saturday's Cowabunga.
Lounging on picnic benches, a cluster of Sigma
Nus watch listlessly as two boys play volleyball on
their lawn. A girl in a yellow bikini makes her way
to Kappa Sig, where the sprinklers are on and the
music is blaring.
The air is too hot to move in, too hot for anyone
to breathe. So instead, while they're holding their
breath, they wait. They wait for sunset, and they
wait for relief.
They are waiting for something to happen.
* * *
As it turns out. that something is scheduled for
10 o'clock that night. It's still only 4 p.m., but
preparations for Exotic Erotic are underway at
680.
680 Lomita is a squat, white house that over
looks central campus. In a few hours time, its front
yard will be brimming with students — half-naked
and wholly drunk, dressed only in their underwear
— but for now, the lot is completely deserted. In
the distance, a plane glides across the fierce blue
sky, disappearing for a moment behind Hoover
Tower. The asphalt burns black in the afternoon
sun.
Already, the house has been stripped of its fur
niture. The dorm's sofas and tables now adorn the
basketball court, and barbed wire fences span the
length of the backyard. Two girls in halter tops lie
sunning themselves in the grass, talking and laugh
ing as if this day at 680 were no different than any
other.
But Matti Hirpa "08. the house's social manag
er, has been waiting for this day since September.
The man behind the party, its success — or failure
— will fall on him and his staff.
Hirpa stands off to the side, nodding, as he
presses a cell phone to his ear. He runs his hands
again and again through his Icing, curly black hair.

its way through the halls, radios at the ready.
"Do NOT push the orange button," their su
pervisor instructs, holding up his radio."Do NOT
push the red button."
"Just don't push any colored buttons," jokes
one EMT.and the group laughs.
On the left, they are passed by two members of
TGI Funk, the first live band of the night. The
band drags its equipment through the house, to
ward the makeshift stage in the backyard.
One, hidden behind a large, black amplifier,
poses a crucial question to his lifting partner.
"As the talent," he call outs, sticking his head
around the amp, "are we allowed to imbibe?"
Up on the stage, the band sets up its instru
ments. A boy lies flat on his back, waiting for the
night to begin; others dangle their feet off the
edge of the stage, talking and laughing. A cloud of
gnats hovers in the yellow glow of the stage lights.
Someone is fiddling with the spotlight. It dims,
then brightens. Dims, then brightens. A flashing
golden halo against the purple evening sky.

to breathe. So instead, while they're holding their
breath, they wait. They wait for sunset, and they
wait for relief.
They are waiting for something to happen.
* * *
As it turns out. that something is scheduled for
10 o'clock that night. It's still only 4 p.m., but
preparations for Exotic Erotic are underway at
680.
680 Lomita is a squat, white house that over
looks central campus. In a few hours time, its front
yard will be brimming with students — half-naked
and wholly drunk, dressed only in their underwear
— but for now, the lot is completely deserted. In
the distance, a plane glides across the fierce blue
sky, disappearing for a moment behind Hoover
Tower. The asphalt burns black in the afternoon
sun.
Already, the house has been stripped of its fur
niture. The dorm's sofas and tables now adorn the
basketball court, and barbed wire fences span the
length of the backyard. Two girls in halter tops lie
sunning themselves in the grass, talking and laugh
ing as if this day at 680 were no different than any
other.
But Matti Hirpa "08. the house's social manag
er, has been waiting for this day since September.
The man behind the party, its success — or failure
— will fall on him and his staff.
Hirpa stands off to the side, nodding, as he
presses a cell phone to his ear. He runs his hands
again and again through his Icing, curly black hair.

its way through the halls, radios at the ready.
"Do NOT push the orange button," their su
pervisor instructs, holding up his radio."Do NOT
push the red button."
"Just don't push any colored buttons," jokes
one EMT.and the group laughs.
On the left, they are passed by two members of
TGI Funk, the first live band of the night. The
band drags its equipment through the house, to
ward the makeshift stage in the backyard.
One, hidden behind a large, black amplifier,
poses a crucial question to his lifting partner.
"As the talent," he call outs, sticking his head
around the amp, "are we allowed to imbibe?"
Up on the stage, the band sets up its instru
ments. A boy lies flat on his back, waiting for the
night to begin; others dangle their feet off the
edge of the stage, talking and laughing. A cloud of
gnats hovers in the yellow glow of the stage lights.
Someone is fiddling with the spotlight. It dims,
then brightens. Dims, then brightens. A flashing
golden halo against the purple evening sky.

The calm before the storm: Outside 680,
the chaos had yet to beain.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Students found refuge from the heat wave in
a campus fountain Friday afternoon pre-fes
tivities.
"Matti's been working nonstop," whispers
Wendi Goh '09, 680 s kitchen manager. Her eyes
trace the path he paces about the room. "It's his
baby."
In keeping with the theme — Exotic Erotic:
Hypnotic Rave — the hallway has been lined with
black butcher paper and spray-painted with sug
gestive graffiti. Ilie fluorescent graffiti ranges
from the unsurprising ("penis") to the hostile
("blow me XX"), to the slightly puzzling ("consen
sual sex").

"Matti's been
WORKING NONSTOP.
It's his baby."
— WENDI GOH '09

I lirpa snaps his phone shut and gestures silent
ly to the lounge, where a shirtless resident is busy
twisting glow sticks into bracelets. The boy looks
up briefly, then returns to his task.
"It's all gonna glow," says Hirpa. He folds his
arms across his chest, pausing for a moment to sur
vey the scene. "It's going to look amazing."
►P * *
By dinnertime, campus is quiet. The afternoon
heat still lingers in the air,but the sun is sinking be
neath the trees, bathing Mayfield in cool, blue
shadows. In the corner of the sky, a pale silhouette
of a moon appears.
Hirpa and three other residents are setting up
barricades when Alison Pena arrives from the Of
fice of Student Affairs (OSA).
"The lines should fit no more than two people
standing side-by-side," orders Hirpa. His aviators
hang around his neck, dangling from the string of
a red staff nametag. Wiping sweat from his brow,
he turns to Pena.
"Hey," Hirpa calls.
Pena makes the OSA look good. Deeply
tanned, with short, reddish-brown hair and glasses,
she greets Hirpa with a broad smile. As Stanford's
Assistant Fire Marshall, it's her job to make sure
the party doesn't end with 680 going up in flames.
In her hands is a clipboard, a pair of scissors and a
plastic, orange lighter.
"You ready for this?" she asks.

I lirpa nods, looking slightly apprehensive.
Pena Hips through her papers, making notes as
she walks through the house. When she reaches
the graffitied wallpaper, she bends down and cuts
a small, black swatch. Hirpa leads her outside,
where the two are joined by Goh and Carolyn
Celio '08, the dorm's financial manager.
"Do you understand how nervous 1 am right
now?" Celio laughs, clutching Goh for support.
"I'm literally shaking."
For the last hour. Celio has been double- and
triple- coating the walls with flame retardant.The
air around her smells faintly of chemicals.
Pena holds her lighter up to the paper. For a
moment, yellow flames dance along the corner,
and then — they disappear. She flicks the lighter
again, but the paper won't burn.
"Perfect," she says, and Celio lets out a whoop.
I lirpa breathes a sigh of relief.
* * *
Before anyone realizes it, the sun has set. The
orange glow disappears, and the sky fades to indi
go. The streetlamps flicker on, as the cool, night air
washes over 680. The lights on Hoover are tiny,
white pinpricks.
The house is now chaos, within and without. In
the hallway, police officers, fire marshals and
EMTs brush past residents, who slowly make their
way outside.
On the house's front steps, Leah Leff'oB,6Bo's
Resident Assistant, has marshaled her residents.
In an elaborate pink and green tutu, she barks out
name after name, assigning each to a shift: Sober
monitor. 10 to 11 .Ticket-taker, 11 to 12. Fire-alarm
guard, 12 to 1.
" This is really, really crucial," she yells, and the
crowd quiets down. "During your shift — if you
have to go to the bathroom — HOLD IT IN."
For campus security, this is just another day on
the job. Another year, another Exotic Erotic and
another group of rowdy, reckless college kids.
The officers cluster in the front, about to fan out
through the house. They hold flashlights up to
their maps, squinting to read in the darkness.
"It's almost like I was here yesterday," adds one
dryly under his breath, glancing over at the house.
"Oh, wait — 1 was."
Out in the parking lot, Pena waves a cheerful
goodbye to the Palo Alto fire engine.
"See you next week!"she laughs."Next party!"
Inside the house, a team of EMTs in blue winds

E
A, ji veryone is naked.
Well, almost naked. It's late Friday afternoon,
the day of Exotic Erotic, but the temperature still
hovers around 95. Already, the landscape is a mo
saic of flesh: hare, brown arms toss a frisbee across
the Oval: pink, freckled shoulders peer from be
neath black bikini straps. Bowing to the heat wave,
students take the night's dress code — one piece
of clothing for men. two for women — to heart.
Up on the row. sweaty Sigma Chis unload kegs
from a van. preparing for Saturday's Cowabunga.
Lounging on picnic benches, a cluster of Sigma
Nus watch listlessly as two boys play volleyball on
their lawn. A girl in a yellow bikini makes her way
to Kappa Sig, where the sprinklers are on and the
music is blaring.
The air is too hot to move in, too hot for anyone
to breathe. So instead, while they're holding their
breath, they wait. They wait for sunset, and they
wait for relief.
