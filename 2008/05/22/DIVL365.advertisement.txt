iff #5 ||| FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
IN A SECURITY-CONSCIOUS WORLD
The principle of freedom of access
by all interested persons to the underlying data,
to the processes, and to the final results of research
is of fundamental importance at Stanford.
How is this principle protected in light of concerns
about classified information and access restrictions
based on security or citizenship requirements?
The Committee on Research will review a case
that examines these questions at a public meeting
Thursday afternoon, May 22
from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m.
in Building 550, Room 553 R.
This review was requested by the
Senate of the Academic Council
and was presented at their meeting on May 1, 2008.
Stanford's Openness in Research policy is on the web at
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/DoR/rph/2-6.html
All are welcome.
