## GSC approves funds for "Grad Nights" Events set for last three Fridays of the quarter 
### ROBERT TOEWS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has voted to fund weekly
"Grad Nights" in the 750 Pub and
Eatery for the last three Fridays of
the quarter, starting this Friday May
23. The events will go from 9 p.m. to
11 p.m. or midnight and will feature
live bands and a free keg.
At first, the GSC had planned to
fund the event only for this week in
order to gauge the idea's popularity
among the graduate student body,
but decided it made more sense to
fund three weeks' worth of Grad
Nights at once, as a "package deal."
"By having all three events rolled
into one and approved as a package,
that gives us an opportunity to have
more continuity, by having repeated,
consistent, weekly events," said
George Bloom, a humanities grad
student and co-chair of the GSC.
"We think we can get more expo
sure, as students will hopefully
spread awareness of these events
through word of mouth."
The three live bands have
already been lined up for the events.

A jazz quartet from nut of state will
perform Friday. A local band called
Riot Squad will perform March 30,
and the Sandy Greenfield Trio will
perform June 6.
"All three bands will be the type
of bands that will provide good
background music, that you can
have conversations while listening
to," said Melahn Parker, one of the
key organizers of the events.
$570 per week was allocated for
each Grad Night — $300 for the
keg, $250 for the band and $20 for
marketing — for a total of $1,710 for
all three events. The funding was
approved by a vote of ten to two,
with two voting members abstain
ing.
"We were at first concerned that
having these events right at the end
of the year might be a problem in
terms of people needing to study for
finals." said Parker. "But we think
they will be a good way for graduate
students to take a break from study
ing and blow off some steam."
The weekly events will be held at
the 750 Pub and Eatery, which is
located on the first floor of the
Graduate Community Center, on
Escondido Road past Campus
Drive.
