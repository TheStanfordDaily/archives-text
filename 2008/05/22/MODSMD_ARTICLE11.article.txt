## Bone marrow drive seeks minority donors 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Project Michelle, a group formed
by friends and family of leukemia
patient and Cal grad Michelle
Maykin. successfully registered 67
potential bone marrow donors last
Friday. Of these, over half were
highly sought-after minority
donors; 41 percent of the total were
of Asian decent — the most likely
match for Maykin.
Two more registration drives will
take place over the next two days
under the direction of Project
Michelle. 'ITie group's mission is to
register 15.000 new donors in the
next six weeks in hopes of expand
ing the registry and finding a match
for Maykin — whose boyfriend of
six years was recently admitted to
the Graduate School of Business —
by June 21. The drives will be held
today, from 11:45 a.m. to 1 p.m. in
the courtyard of the Graduate
School of Business, and tomorrow,
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Clark
Center.
Registration is free for minori
ties, including mixed-race donors, as

there is a significant need for ethni
cally diverse donors in the general
registry. For individuals of
Caucasian decent, the registration
fee is $25. a figure which is still sub
sidized.
