## Positive Sustainability Sustainable sustenance 
### 
We all may want our cars, our
homes, our computers and
our jobs, but there is one
thing we can all agree we need: food.
Unfortunately, in the world today,
food is highly problematic — from a
global perspective, it's expensive, it's
unfairly distributed and its produc
tion is an environmental disaster. Sta
tistics detailing the extent of food's
many problems are easy to find, hut so
far,solutions to this global plight have
proven elusive.
There does not yet exist a simple,
out-of-the-box solution to the food
crisis. For the future, however, both a
class at Columbia University and a
small non-profit in Kansas are work
ing on two fundamentally divergent
solutions that could change the face of
cultivation forever: vertical farming
and Natural Systems Agriculture.
By the end of this year, more than
half of the world's population will live
in cities. Advocates of vertical farming
propose that food production should
follow this demographic transition
into the urban environment, with the
food of the future grown not in fields,
but in skyscrapers. While the idea
might sound at first a tad ludicrous.
Dr. Dickson Despommier and his stu
dents in Columbia's Medical Ecology
class are convinced of its potential.
By growing diverse crops aero
ponically — roots dangling in a fine
mist of nutrient-rich water — inside a
vertical greenhouse. Dr. Despommier
contends that a twenty story building
spanning a square city block could
provide adequate nutrition for 50.(XX)

people. It this figure could be practi
cally realized, it would mean that an
urban area the size of San Francisco
could feed the entire United States.
Dr. Despommier also contends
that his design would be energy posi
tive, producing almost twice as much
energy as it consumes. Unlike con
ventional farms, most of which re
quire fossil fuel inputs and pollute the
environment via synthetic chemical
runoff, the only inputs in vertical
farming would be solar energy, com
posted waste and water, and the only
outputs food, water and energy. Waste
generated inside the building would
be biologically recycled and used to
grow more crops, meaning no pollu
tion.
Individual floors of the vertical
farm could be conditioned to opti
mize growth for each crop, and the in
door nature of the system would elim
inate risk of crop failure due to
droughts, floods, and pests, and great
ly reduce the danger of food-borne
diseases. By switching to vertical
fanning,current cropland could ideal
ly be restored to its natural state, not
only eliminating the environmental

problems associated with agriculture,
but also producing environmental
benefits.
Wes Jackson and the researchers
of The Land Institute, on the other
hand, believe the answer is not a fur
ther departure from nature, but in
stead a return to it. By mimicking nat
ural systems instead of fighting them,
they say, human food production
could exist in harmony with the earth.
The Land Institute's new agricul
tural paradigm. Natural Systems
Agriculture, is based on the observa
tion that a prairie provides food for all
of its inhabitants without needing a
single drop of fossil fuel or synthetic
pesticide and fertilizer, while at the
same time sequestering carbon diox
ide and enriching the soil. What does
nature know that we don't? Nature
understands that without diversity,
and without closed cycles, nothing can
be sustainable.
Currently, most human agriculture
is based on a system of annual mono
culture, in which each field is designed
to grow only one crop which is har
vested. plowed over and replanted
annually. The problem with this
method is that it is equivalent to min
ing the soil for nutrients, a process
made possible only by copious doses
of synthetic fertilizer.
As opposed to our current agricul
tural methods. Natural Systems Agri
culture would be based on a system of
perennial polyculture, where multiple
different crops would grow on the
same field, retreat after they were
harvested, and then return naturally

when seasonal conditions again be
came favorable. Growing a diverse
range of crops in the same system
would protect against massive crop
failure, deter pests organically and
make each acre more productive. Re
turning organic wastes to the field in
the form of compost and matching
plants that generate essential nutri
ents for each other would eliminate
the need for chemical fertilizers.
While Natural Systems Agriculture
would still require massive tracts of
land for food production, these acres

could be returned to a more natural,
sustainable state.
In order to realize the concept of
Natural Systems Agriculture on a
wide scale, researchers at the Land
Institute are working to develop
perennial versions of important
crops. Like vertical farming. Natural
Systems Agriculture will require
more development to get things off
the ground. Though 1 remain cau
tiously hopeful about both methods,
awaiting full proof that these con
cepts are viable in practice, these in

novative ideas deserve further inves
tigation. as each provides an unprece
dented opportunity to provide cheap,
abundant and sustainable sustenance
for the future.

a sustainable strawberry,-vertical or
natural will do, as long as it's yummy.
