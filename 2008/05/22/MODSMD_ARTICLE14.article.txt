## Choosing whom to quote 
### 
While many news articles in
The Daily feature quotes
from newsmakers them
selves. from time to time there are
stories with quotes from "random"
members of a group affected by the
news. Often, for example, a story
about a change in sonic campus pol
icy affecting students will include
several quotes from undergraduates
who are supposedly randomly cho
sen.
The point of such quotes, it seems,
is to attempt to gauge the relevant
group's attitude toward these
changes, and relay these feelings to
the readers. The problem, however,
is how to choose whom to ask for
quotes.
In an ideal world, a journalist
would be able to take a scientific poll
of a sufficiently large number of
members from this group, asking for
their opinions on the issue. Of
course, this is entirely infeasible for
the average newspaper article.
Still, the idea of a scientific poll
should be kept in mind. Ideally, a
journalist would literally ask ran
dom students — stopping people
near Tresidder or outside the library
to ask them for their opinions. (Of
course, this wouldn't be truly a ran
dom sample, but it would be at least
a reasonable approximation. Anoth
er approach might be to randomly
choose names from frosh facebooks
from different years.)
1 took at a look at a handful of ar
ticles from the last month which fea
tured these sorts of quotes, and ex
amined how those quotes were cho
sen. For the most part, the authors I
talked to chose their quotes not
from a totally random sample, but
rather from their acquaintances.
Often, the choice of which acquain
tances to ask was made with at least
the goal of getting representative
opinions; reporters told me they
would consciously choose to ask
people from different years and dif
ferent social circles, for example.
Sometimes, though, this was not the
case: one article.on college rankings,
quoted only three members of the
fraternity to which the author be
longs.
There are several problems with
journalists choosing to ask for
quotes from people they know. First,
there is a danger that a given Daily
reporter's set of friends and acquain
tances is not at all a representative
sample of the student body. (Here, of
course, there are some cases where
this is worse than others; a student in
a reporter's I HUM section is more
likely to be "random" than a re
porter's friend.) Aggregated over all
Daily reporters — who 1 imagine
aren't as heterogeneous as the stu
dent body — this could lead to a sys
tematic bias in who The Daily
quotes.
Second, while allowing Daily re
porters to ask casual acquaintances

for quotes might not be too bad. it
could encourage a slippery slope to
wards reporters asking their friends
to give quotes.
Third, when a reporter asks
someone she knows for a quote, I
imagine that reporter is more likely
to take a casual, less professional at
titude than she would with a
stranger. When reporters cover im
portant newsmakers, it's inevitable
that they will get to know each other
and their conversations will be more
casual; indeed, such close relation
ships between reporters and sources
can lead to great scoops. But when a
reporter simply needs someone to
offer their opinion as a member of
the group and not as a newsmaker,
there's no reason not to choose
someone they don't know.
Finally, when The Daily acts less
than professionally by quoting re
porters' friends, it lowers readers'
expectations for the paper; Stanford
is small enough that readers, from
time to time, notice when this hap
pens.
[ MSOffice 1 ] Last Wednesday, a
sports article was published on the
front page about incoming freshman
basketball player Jack Trotter
["Freshman help for Cardinal
hoops," May 14J. The article noted
Trotter's "strong family ties" to Stan
ford; he'll be the ninth member of his
family to attend the University. The
article did not mention, however,
that Jack's older sister Emma Trotter
•10 is a features editor for The Daily.
One might wonder why there was
such prominent coverage for a "pre
ferred walk-on" to the men's basket
ball team, when the team's main re
cruits — Jarrett Mann and Jeremy
Green — have barely been covered.
Indeed, Trotter's family connection
to ITie Daily raises the question
whether there might have been a
conflict of interest in the article.
ITiis seems not to be the case.The
article appeared on a slow day for
sports; that, according to managing
editor for sports Jack Salisbury, is
why it was featured on the front
page. Beyond forwarding a San
Francisco Chronicle article on her
brother to the sports section, Emma
Trotter had nothing to do with the
article.
Still, it would have been better if
The Daily had explicitly acknowl
edged this family connection. It's im
possible to eliminate all bias in the
world of journalism. Such an act of
transparency would at least have
made readers aware of this potential
bias, and it would have showed that
The Daily itself was aware of the po
tential for bias in the story.
