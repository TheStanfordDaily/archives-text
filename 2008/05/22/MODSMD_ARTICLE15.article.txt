## A 						distinguished speaker...of Spanglish

Yo quiero Taco Bell. It takes
quite a bit of skill to provoke
deep thinking about what may
have been one of the most inanely ad
dictive advertising campaigns of all
time.
But for llan Stavans, a prolific au
thor and professor at Amherst Col
lege. Spanglish — the mix of English
and Spanish used by immigrant com
munities and increasingly in popular
culture — is a source of fascination.
Spanglish. Stavans thinks, is a "cultur
al phenomenon."
"With Latinos, there is something
unique taking place," Stavans told us
this week as a visiting distinguished
speaker to the Stanford center in San
tiago. "Instead of losing [the immi
grant language], it is becoming
stronger."The retention of Spanish in
the U.S., and the Spanglish that is re
sulting, is so important, Stavans said,
that Toyota is using it to sell cars. In a
recent ad for hybrids, a bi-lingual fa
ther alternates between talking to his
son in English and Spanish as he ex
plains how the car works, concluding
that hybrids, both of cars and lan
guage, are "for the future."
Stavans grew up in Mexico in a
Jewish family where he spoke Yiddish
at home, Spanish with friends and
learned English by watching TV. His
father even worked as a voiceover
actor, dubbing the Flintstones into
Spanish. As a journalist, essayist, aca
demic and storyteller, Stavans is ob
sessed with the role of languages in so
ciety, and he thinks Spanglish is more
than a weird, transitional type of slang.
I was initially skeptical when it was
announced that Stavans was coming
to visit. He has, after all, a doctorate in
letters, and like the average human, I
have no idea what that means. I
learned later from Wikipedia and

Google that he's somewhat of a liter
ary big shot, though you couldn't tell
by the leather jacket he wore as he ad
dressed us and didn't remove when he
accompanied us to an opera after
wards.
A 2005 book review in the San
Francisco Chronicle describes Stavans
as "so prolific, and so famous" that he
could sell a volume entitled "The Es
sential llan Stavans" at age 43. He is.
according to the Chronicle, "the virtu
al godfather of Latino literature."
Stavans does have the self-assured
demeanor of many successful profes
sors, but also a playful joy about his
own geekiness. "I love dictionaries,"
he said. "Who decided that we needed
to put all of our words between two
covers? How do you define the color
yellow?"
Aside from publishing and editing
so many things, Stavans is also quickly
emerging as the godfather of Spang
lish. After someone told him Spang
lish couldn't be taken seriously until it
produced a masterpiece like the Span
ish classic Don Quixote. Stavans de
cided to translate Don Quixote entire
ly into Spanglish. It was an act of blas
phemy sufficient to get the Royal
Spanish Academy (the traffic police of
official Spanish language matters)
pretty riled up. His strong defense of
the legitimacy of Spanglish has also
earned death threats here and there
from anti-immigrant crazies back in
the U.S. — though living in Amherst,

he seems pretty safe.
Still, Stavans is acutely aware of the
politically-loaded connotations of em
bracing Spanglish and other studies
related to immigrants. "The most con
servative forces in the U.S. perceive it
as a threat," he said. His approach has
generally been to embrace controver
sy, and use if for new inspiration. Dur
ing his lecture, he told us that Mexican
immigrants in the U.S. are in some
ways the Jews of today, arguing that
"no other groups would accept such
[verbal abuse]" like the abuse immi
grants receive. On shows like that of
CNN's Lou Dobbs, Stavans said, they
are called cockroaches and worse. In
one of his many forms of response to
the issue of discrimination, Stavans
wrote the text for a graphic novel com
ing out this summer called "Mr. Spic
Goes to Washington."
In an interview with me after his
talk, Stavans had no problem dis
cussing his aggressive advocacy for
Latino culture, immigrants and of
course, Spanglish. "I see the role of
teacher as an activist," Stavans said
before the question was even fully
formed. "I'm not coming to the class
room to sell my philosophical views
and turn my students into follow
ers," he added, emphasizing the im
portance of teachers who are en
gaged with their subject. "I'm fasci
nated by how the third world lives in
the first."
Though Stavans has received the
most attention for his work on Span
ish and Latino issues, he is scarily pro
ductive. He told me his latest project
is a book about the journey of the He
brew language (which he also speaks)
from pre-biblical times to Israel
today. "There are parts where He
brew and Arabic are mixed like
Spanglish." he said.

At heart then, Stavans is a lover of
a language. And in case you were won
dering, the books this doctor of letters
would take to a desert island are Moby
Dick, Don Quixote, 100 Years of Soli
tude and a dictionary.

Is "yo quiero Taco Bell" the best known
example of Spanglish ? Hasta la vista
baby? Tell Michael at wilkerson@stan
