## STEADY IN RELIEF 
### BY ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
I very time head coach Mark Mar
■ . quess waves to the bullpen late in
the game. Cardinal baseball fans
have faith in knowing that they can
count on freshman closer Drew
Storen to get the job done. This past Sunday in
Arizona, Storen earned his second win of the
season, posting a career-high five innings of
work allowing only two hits and one walk.
"1 came in with a mindset to close the game,"
Storen said. "After the first few innings. 1 got
tired and had to switch to a starter's mindset.
This means that I had to pace myself, use better
pitches, especially my fastball, i figured that I
was in it for the long haul. 1 would stay in there
until they took me out or we won."
Keeping this performance in mind, it is no
wonder that the New York Yankees drafted
Storen in the 34th round (1,050 th pick overall)
of the 2007 MLB First-Year Player Draft. He
was also ranked 49th among the 2007 Top 100
High School Prospects by Baseball America.

Though it was tempting to choose the big
leagues over Stanford. Storen decided to
play it smart and plans on majoring in
product design.
"Choosing between Stanford and the
majors was one of the toughest decisions 1
have ever had to make," Storen said. "Being
drafted by the Yankees was one of the
coolest experiences 1 have ever had.
"I needed a large financial commitment
from them in order to choose baseball over
Stanford because getting into Stanford is one
of the best things that has happened to me.
I'm happy that I chose to come here."
And Stanford is happy to have him. He
leads the Cardinal in saves with a total of
five, has one of the best E:RAs on the team
(2.91) and is second in strikeouts, with 40
batters downed over 43.1 innings pitched
this season. He has exceeded expecta
tions as a relief pitcher after being a
starter for most of his life.
"Training wise, starting is easier but
closing is much more exciting," Storen
said."l like them both but closing is a
lot more pressure. It's high risk, high
reward. Closing requires a different
mindset, and I figured out what 1

needed to do my first weekend against
[Cal St.) Fullerton.
"It is a lot of fun learning the
tricks on how to close, hut there is a possi
bility that 1 might start next year. I'm happy
with my role right now, and I'm just worry
ing about doing my job."
"Though Storen was a top-ranked play
er at the high school level, he has realized
that collegiate baseball has its differences.
The freshman has had to adjust to pitching
at a high level very quickly, especially now
as one of Stanford's top relief pitchers.
"The hardest part is knowing that if you
make a mistake, hitters will capitalize on
it," Storen said. "You can't get away with
bad pitches like in high school. Facing our
hitters in the fall, I learned that this is a dif
ferent ball game. You can't have a lapse in
concentration."

Storen has consistently pitched
against some of the top teams and hit
ters in the nation. As a closer, the
freshman right-hander normally
enters the game when the Cardinal
is in a jam. This is a high pressure
position, as he is expected to bail
Stanford out or sustain a narrow

lead late in the game.
"I try to minimize the game," Storen
said.'i try not to think about it. I try to keep
in mind this quote I read in this sports psy
chology book over the summer saying that
the situation is only as big as you make it in
your mind.
"I don't even look at the reports on the
hitters," he continued. "I just try to attack
the guys and look at it like I'm throwing in
the bullpen, even if the bases are loaded
with a good hitter up."
With only three more games to go in the
regular season, the Cardinal will need
Storen's cool head and hot arm in order to
make its best run at the Pac-10 title over
Arizona State.
The Sun Devils (15-6 Pac-10) only need
one win against their in-state rival Ari
zona (10-11) to clinch the title outright.
Stanford (12-9) will face Washington (10-
11) this weekend in Seattle, where they
will need to sweep the Huskies to have a
chance to tie the Sun Devils for the Pac-10
crown.
