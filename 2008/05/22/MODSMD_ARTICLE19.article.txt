### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A day after being named the 2(X)8 ITA Na
tional Rookie of the Year, freshman I lilarv Barte

advanced in the NCAA Singles Championship
with a 4-6. 6-2. 6-0 opening round win over
UNI.V's Elena Gantcheva.
In the first NCAA tournament appearance of
her collegiate career. Barte recovered from a
slow start to win her first three-set match since
April 5. when she clinched the Cardinal's 4-3 win
over eventual NCAA Champion UCLA.
Barte, who lost her last match to Baylor's
Zuzana Zemenova in the NCAA quarterfinals,
took a set to finally settle into a groove.
"I was just a little rusty in the first set," Barte

said. "But after that it was okay. First round's al
ways the toughest so it was nice to get through
it."
As the No. 3 seed, however. Barte is expected
to contend beyond just the first round. With the
win, she now boasts a team-best 30-7 record on
the year.
Also, with 30 overall wins and 20 dual victo
ries. Barte became the first freshman to accom
plish the feat since Theresa Logar did it in 2(X)4,
when she went 3S-4 overall and 27-0 in dual
matches.

"I thought it's pretty cool," Barte said of join
ing the 30-20 club."I had no idea about that be
fore today."
On Friday, she will take on Baylors Lenka
Broosova, who helped the Bears upset the Card
last Saturday in the quarterfinals. Broosova
cruised through the first round with a 6-1.6-0 win
over Nadia Abdala of Arizona State.
Junior Jessica Nguyen, also playing in the
main singles tournament, fell 6-1,6-3 to Miami's
