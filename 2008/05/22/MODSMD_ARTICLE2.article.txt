## Phishing scam more sophisticated New string of scam emails more elaborate than before 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Phishing scams, which have
plagued Stanford students over the
past two years, have become increas
ingly sophisticated in their attempts
to solicit private information. In the
most recent series of attacks affecting
Stanford, scammers are now posing
as governmental agencies offering
protection from future scamming.
"The National Credit Union
Administration (NCUA) and U.S.
Government developed a project to
protect your bank account and credit
card against Internet fraud, but for this
we need your help," reads one email.
"You just have to register with us."
The link below directs the recipi
ent to a fake Web site that asks for
sensitive credit card information that
can be used for unauthorized pur
chases.
The emails all contain links and
sender addresses from the .gov
domain, providing an illusion of
authenticity. According to Jon Pilat.
manager of Unix Systems in IT
Services, email addresses can be easi
ly forged.
Pilat added that attacks that
require a Web site to enter informa
tion have no need for a valid email
