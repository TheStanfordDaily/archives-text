w : g-fr%, Sm hile most freshmen are struggling to
iMi endure the endless hours of IHUM
W'#' YHHr lecture or talking about the party last
fei; Friday, Alexandra Gits'collegiate ca
reer thus far tells a different story.
A freshman standout on the Stanford track and field
team. Gits' day follows a "typical runner's schedule:" get
up, run. eat. class, eat. class, run again, study and home
work, and finally sleep. The freshman has already had an

incredibly successful season on the
Farm, but before she set foot on
the Stanford campus. Gits was al
ready quite the star in the world of
competitive high school running.
The 2006 Minnesota State
Cross Country champion and the
2007 Minnesota State Track and
Field 3.200 meter champion. Gits
holds several records at her high
school, and held the title of the
fourth fastest 5.000 meter time as a
junior in 2007 with a time of
16:50.47.
Gits recalls her favorite game of
"Cops and Robbers" in the play
ground during her elementary
school years â€” her first memory
of running a lot and thoroughly en
joying it. With the added dread that
the inevitable recess bell would

ring. Gits enjoyed every minute of the game, and eventu
ally joined a formal track team in middle school. That is
when her track and field journey began, and it is far from
over.
Perhaps the climax of Gits' college career thus far was
her spectacular race at the Stanford Payton Jordan Invita
tional, where she placed third in the 10,000 meter run with
an NCAA automatic qualifying time of 33:l 1 >.42. What
made the run more impressive was that she lost a shoe

after the first 5,000 meters, running the last half of the race
shoeless. Or perhaps it was her recent Pac-10 title in the
10.000 meter run, as she is one of the few freshmen to ever
claim the title in that event. Hither way, this freshman is on
her way to glory in the collegiate racing arena, and prom
ises to bring determination, intensity and passion to each
race.
Hoping to major in Human Biology while completing
Pre-Med requirements, Gits has a full plate on her sched
ule, and eventually hopes to merge her interests in sports
and medicine by pursuing a career in physical therapy. As
a freshman, she has faced her share of difficulties as a new
member of the Farm.
"The first quarter of the year had its trials; there were
so many new things to learn how to react to: school, run-

ning, living situations," she said.
"But eventually I got the hang
of things and have found a hit
more balance, but of course not
everything is perfected, and
each day I've got to put in the
effort to make it all fall into
place."
Initially drawn to Stanford
because of "a positive, driven
team, unbelievable weather
year round, and gorgeous trails
and training facilities," Gits
quickly got to know her older
teammates and has thrived off
the camaraderie and friendship
of the team.
"1 have been very fortunate
this year to be against some
great competition and train
with some awesome girls who

certainly helped me get to where 1 am." she said of her
older teammates.
"Being a freshman has so many advantages, including
having a flux of older girls to look up to and copy their
style and composure as they run.There is no one person I
can say I look up to the most;everyone on the team is spe
cial by bringing something different to the table."
