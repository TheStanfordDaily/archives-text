King represents Cardinal at
women's golf championships
Sophomore Angela King
opened the first round of the
NCAA Women's Golf Champi
onships on TUesday with a three
over-par 75. King is the only Stan
ford golfer competing after quali
fying as an individual at the
NCAA West Regionals two
weeks ago.
King had two birdies, three bo
gies and a double-bogey. Her
score is good for 53rd. The first
round leader is Nannette Hill of
Wake Forest, who shot a course
record 67 on the par 72 course in
Albuquerque. N.M.
USC leads the team competi
tion after day one with a collective
four-under-par 284. They hold a
five-stroke lead over Auburn and
UCLA, who both shot one-over
par rounds of 289.
King will be back on the course
tomorrow for the second of four
rounds, as play was suspended on
Wednesday due to windy condi
tions. She finished in a tie for 60th at
last year's NCAA Championships,
so the sophomore hopes to im
prove that standing over the last
three rounds of the tournament.
