## Kobe, Lakers rally big, take game one Bryant goes off late, Lakers overcome 20 point deficit 
### JOHNNADEL THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles
Lakers waited until the third quarter
to get going. Once they did, the San
Antonio Spurs couldn't stop them.
And the defending NBA champi
ons contributed to their own demise
with a brutal, uncharacteristic
fourth-period performance.
Bryant scored all but two of his 27
points after halftime. including a go
ahead. 10-foot jumper in the lane
with 23.9 seconds remaining, and the
Lakers rallied from a 20-point
deficit to beat the Spurs 89-85 on
Wednesday night in Game 1 of the
Western Conference finals.
"Kobe, he was doing a trust-his
teammates thing in the first half,"
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
"That's why he had five assists, and
he was checking it all out and see
where his territory was going to be.
In the second half, he went to work.
"Obviously a difficult loss and we
had a great opportunity. We didn't
take advantage of it. Hurts like hell."
Bryant, who finished with nine
assists and five rebounds, shot 1-for
-3 in the first half and 10-for-18 in the
second.
"I know I can make that push and
I knew once I did. 1 could get the
game back under control, get it
under 10 where we knew we could
be in striking distance," Bryant said.
"In the first half, we were a little
rusty, a little sluggish and a little ten
tative. Second half, it wasn't there.
"It is big for a young team to
come back from 20 against the de
fending champs."
Defensive specialist Bruce Bowen
held Bryant in check in the first half,
but it didn't last.
"Kobe put them on his back,"
Bowen said. "We had an excellent

opportunity, and we let it get away.
I'm very disappointed."
Game 2 will be played Friday
night before the best-of-seven series
shifts to San Antonio for the third
and fourth games. The Lakers are 7-
0 in the postseason at Staples Cen
ter. where they've won 13 straight
games overall.
Bryant's jumper put the Lakers
ahead for good after two free throws
by Manu Ginobili with 1:22 remain
ing and a follow shot by Tim Duncan

missed a 3-pointer and Sasha Vujacic
made two free throws with 7.3 sec
onds to go. completing the scoring.

24-13 in the fourth quarter, when
San Antonio shot 3-for-21, including
l-for-9 from 3-point range.
"We almost gave up home-court
advantage to a great effort by the
Spurs." Lakers coach Phil Jackson
said. "That was a big comeback. We
were deep in the hole, there was no
doubt about it. Twenty down and
half the quarter gone in the third pe
riod. It was a struggle to fight back
into the ballgame by the end of the
third quarter."
Pau Gasol had 19 points and
seven rebounds. Vujacic and
Vladimir Radmanovic scored 10
points apiece, and Lamar Odom had
eight points and eight rebounds for

points, 10 rebounds and six assists;

bili added 10 for the Spurs.
Ginobili shot just 3-for-13, and
Jackson credited Vujacic for his de
fensive work on the Spurs' star.
"Sasha had an assignment out
there tonight and he played Ginobili
very well," Jackson said. "Offensive
ly, Sasha had a lot better games, but
defensively, that was one of his best."
Vujacic played a career playoff
high 31 1/2 minutes.
The well-rested Lakers hadn't
played since Friday, when they beat
Utah to advance to the conference
finals for the first time in four years.

The Spurs advanced by winning at
New Orleans three nights later, but
their flight to Los Angeles was de
layed several hours and they didn't
arrive at their hotel in suburban
Santa Monica until Tuesday morn
ing around 9 a.m.
'"No one gives any excuse," Park
er said. "We were in pretty good
shape, had a great lead. We had a
great chance to win the game and we
just didn't play well enough in the
fourth quarter."
Popovich also said the plane de
bacle had nothing to do with his
team's late-game problems.
"They probably wore us down to
some degree, I'm sure," he said.
"And then, with that, we made very
poor decisions. The ball stopped
moving. Shots at the end of the
clock, no penetration to the rim, all
jump shots and they deserve credit
for that and they came back and had
a hell of a win."
Two straight baskets by Bryant
cut San Antonio's lead to three
points with eight minutes remaining.
Bowen made a 3-pointer with 7:38
left, but the Spurs went stone cold at
that stage, going scoreless for nearly
6 1/2 minutes.

ing 10 straight points for a four-point
