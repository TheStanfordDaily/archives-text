## Federal court strikes down military gay ban 
### GENE JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEATTLE (AP) — The mili
tary cannot automatically dis
charge people because they're gay,
a federal appeals court ruled
Wednesday in the case of a deco
rated flight nurse who sued the Air
Force over her dismissal.
The three judges from the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did
not strike down the military's
"don't ask, don't tell" policy. But
they reinstated Maj. Margaret
Witt's lawsuit, saying the Air Force
must prove that her dismissal fur
thered the military's goals of troop
readiness and unit cohesion.
The "don't ask,don't tell, don't
pursue, don't harass" policy pro
hibits the military from asking
about the sexual orientation of
service members but requires dis
charge of those who acknowledge
being gay or engaging in homo
sexual activity.
Wednesday's ruling led oppo
nents of the policy to declare its
days numbered. It is also the first
appeals court ruling in the country
that evaluated the policy through
the lens of a 2(X)3 Supreme Court
decision that struck down a Texas
ban on sodomv as an unconstitu

tional intrusion on privacy.
When gay service members
have sued over their dismissals,
courts historically have accepted
the military's argument that having
gays in the service is generally bad
for morale and can lead to sexual
tension.
But the Supreme Court's opin
ion in the Texas case changed the
legal landscape, the judges said,
and requires more scrutiny over
whether "don't ask. don't tell" is
constitutional as applied in individ
ual cases.
Under Wednesday's ruling, mil
itary officials "need to prove- that
having this particular gay person in
the unit really hurts morale, and
the only way to improve morale is
to discharge this person," said
Aaron Caplan, a staff attorney
with the American Civil Liberties
Union of Washington state who
worked on the case.
Witt, a flight nurse based at Mc-
Chord Air Force Base near Taco
ma, was suspended without pay in
2(X)4 after the Air Force received a
tip that she had been in a long-term
relationship with a civilian woman.
Witt was honorably discharged in
October 2(X)7 after having put in 18
years - two short of what she need
ed to receive retirement benefits.
