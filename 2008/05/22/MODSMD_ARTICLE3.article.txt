# Janitors strike for wages
## Rally on East Campus draws crowd of supporters 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
Nearly 100 University janitors went on
strike yesterday after reaching a stalemate in
contract negotiations with ABM Janitorial
Services, an outside contractor that supplies
workers to Stanford.
The workers — joined by friends and
family members, including children and
infants — congregated in the afternoon and
made their way en masse through the Stern
and Wilbur housing complexes, then contin
ued down Escondido Rd. and Serra St., even
tually culminating in front of ABM's campus
office on Bonair Siding.
At least three public safety officials and
two officers surrounded the crowd outside
ABM's office, redirecting car traffic that was
intentionally blocked by demonstrating
workers.
The workers' five-year contract with
ABM. which hires 132 janitors from the local
branch of the Service Employees
International Union known as Local 717,
ended April 30. Since then, the workers have
tried to negotiate with the contractor for
comprehensive family insurance and higher
wages, according to Eddie Iny. one of the
organizers of the strike.
"Janitors here at Stanford are facing ris
ing costs of gasoline, rising costs of food and

low hourly wages." Iny said over the sound of
chanting workers and a beating drum.
"There is just not enough money on the table
right now for workers to survive."
Under the former contract with ABM.
hourly worker wages increased by a total of
$1 over five years. According to Ernesto
Garcia, a former University worker and cur
rent member of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition. ABM's starting offer in the cur
rent contract negotiations was a five-year
contract with a wage increase of 10 cents per
year.
ABM has also said that the rising cost of
Medicare may prevent the contractor from
providing health insurance to the workers.
Iny said the primary reason for the strike
was ABM's refusal to budge in any discus
sion with the workers.
"When [workers] have stood up. the com
panies have intimidated them and threat
ened them, and that's part of the reason we
are on strike," he said.
A spokesperson at ABM's office said he
was unable to comment on the strike taking
place outside.
According to lnv. over 6,000 workers
across Silicon Valley. San Jose and Oakland
are affected bv the negotiations with ABM.

Striking janitors, along with their friends, families and supporters, stood outside the Quad
Wednesday afternoon in protest of their employer, ABM Janitorial Services. Please see Web
site for more photos.
Local 717 held a rally at
Stanford on April 30 in which over
one hundred University janitors
and students marched through the
quad and into White Plaza
demanding higher wages and more
comprehensive health care.
A similar demonstration took
place the following day at Google's
Mountain View campus. Google
later agreed to pay all of its work
ers hired through ABM a living
wage even if their contractor
refused to do so. Greentech, anoth
er Silicon Valley company, recently
announced it will follow Google's
example.
Karina Ponce, a worker who
took part in yesterday's strike, said
she plans to continue striking.
"While people are negotiating,
all we [workers] can do is strike,"
she said.
lny said the workers' move
ment. which was continued by
workers in Oakland last night, is
steadily growing and becoming
increasingly mobile.
