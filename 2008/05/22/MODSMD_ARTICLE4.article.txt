# FACULTY & STAFF
## Faculty salaries differ by speciality, tenure 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Recent data from the American
Association of University Professors shows
that the average salary of a full Stanford pro
fessor is $ 173.000. placing Stanford third in the
nation behind Rockefeller University and
Harvard.
But numbers from Stanford reveal that the

average salary figure is brought up by high
salaries at the professional schools.
Furthermore, the average faculty salaries lag
well behind coach and administrator salaries,
though by a smaller margin than at other
schools.
For the 35 assistant professors at Stanford
in the humanities, compensation at the 33rd
percentile is $68,000. Stanford does not dis
close data on individual salaries, and instead

provides data for the 33rd and 6bth per
centiles among various subsets of faculty.
"Anyone with a brain and a calculator can
see that the pay is atrocious." said Assistant
Anthropology Prof. Michael Wilcox. "I would
guess that many junior faculty have to borrow
money to make ends meet here. For the
amount of education that they have, they are
horribly underpaid."
While pay does increase as faculty move up

the ranks, humanities professors still lag far
behind the average for Stanford professors,
and even farther behind administrators and
coaches.
Two-thirds of humanities professors with
over 21 years of experience earn less than
$ 159, 196.
But at least two-thirds of assistant profes-
sors at the Graduate School of
Business make more than $131,500.
Virtually all full business school pro
fessors make over $200,000.
The School of Medicine boasts
some of Stanford's highest salaries.
In its 990 filing with the IRS, the
University must disclose the top five
highest paid Stanford employees.
The 2005 990 form lists Edward
Manche, Director of Cornea and
Refractive Surgery, as Stanford's top
earner, with a total cash compensa
tion of $2,377,211. The fifth-ranked
earner on the list is Michael
Edwards, Director of Regional

Pediatric Neurosurgery, at $863,450.
All five listed are Medical School
professors.
While Stanford's top earners
work in the School of Medicine, the
top salaries at many universities go
to athletic coaches. Although the
average Stanford professor is paid
significantly less than the football
and basketball coaches and the
University president, the gap
between faculty and coach salaries
at Stanford is far smaller than at
other schools.
San Jose Mercury News sports
writer Jon Wilner told The Daily last
month that he estimates that new
head men's basketball coach Johnny
Dawkins will earn between $800,000
and $900,000, while football coach
Jim Harbaugh makes between
$500,000 and $600,000.

The University's 2005 tax filing
— the latest provided to The Daily
— indicates that President John
Hennessy made $618,250 in total
cash compensation in 2005. Chief
Financial Officer Randall Livingston
was the second-highest earning
administrator that year, with
$434,000 in total cash compensation.
Nonetheless, according to a 2007
article in the Wall Street Journal,
Hennessy has made $43 million over
the last five years through his many
investments, most notably in
Google.
At other schools, the gap
between faculty salaries and admin
istrator and coach salaries is far
wider. For the 2007-2008 school
year, football coaches made 10 times
more than professors at Division IA
schools. At Stanford, Harbaugh
makes approximately 3.2 times more
than the average professor.
This is the result of a long-stand
ing unofficial Stanford policy of
keeping coaches off the list of the
University's highest paid employees.
"Our institution has adopted a
philosophy of not having our coach
es be among the highest paid
employees at the University,"
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby told
The Daily last month.
