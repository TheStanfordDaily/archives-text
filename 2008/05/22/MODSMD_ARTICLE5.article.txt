## Plans for green buildings outlined New facilities aim to cut electricity use 32 percent by 2050 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Y2E2 won't be Stanford's only green
building in the years to come — students can
count on massive University efforts to reduce
energy consumption over the next few
decades.
By 2010, Stanford aims to reduce overall
campus electricity use by 10 percent — or 20
million kilowatt hours (kwh) per year. The
University has also set a long-term goal of cut
ting electricity use by 26 percent — or 60 mil
lion kwh — per year by 2015, and 32 percent
— or 120 million kwh — per year by 2050.
The University adopted new building stan
dards last year that required all new buildings
to be 30 percent more energy efficient and 25
percent more water efficient than existing
buildings on campus.
Joseph Stagner, executive director of the
Sustainability and Energy Management
Executive Office, said that the University
would take four major steps to achieve these
goals.
"The first is design in the shell of the build
ing," Stagner said. "We will construct these
new buildings shells to be more energy effi
cient, have better insulation and better win
dows. Second, the buildings will be orientated
in relationship to the sun in a more optimum

fashion to take advantage of natural lighting
and solar heating."
"Third, mechanical and electrical systems
will be designed to be more efficient, to take
advantage of natural airflows, shading and
orientation. This way less energy is required."
he continued. "Finally, we will take advantage
of the surrounding landscape so as to use less
water and use less chemical pesticides and fer
tilizers in the landscaping."
In addition to the Jerry Yang and Akiko
Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building
(Y2E2), which was dedicated on March 4, sev
eral other environmentally friendly buildings
are currently undergoing construction.
Stagner said that the new Knight
Management Center of the Graduate School
of Business, which will be breaking ground
later this year, will be a building in this new
mold.
"The goal is to have the building have a
Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) rating of gold or platinum,"
he said. "One of the bellwethers used to rate
how well a hew building is constructed in
terms of energy and environmental issues is
the LEED rating, which is developed by the
U.S. Green Building Council."
The LEED rating ranks the environmental
friendliness of a building on a scale of plat
inum. gold, silver or simply certified, with
platinum being the highest level of achieve
ment.
According to Stagner. another example of
an effort made by the University is
in the new science and engineering
quad.
» "The first of the four buildings
was the Y2E2," he said. "The
remaining three buildings in the
science and engineering quad will
also be very green, and President
Hennessy has provided additional
funding to meet these high stan
dards. However, although we're not
applying for LEED certification on
these buildings, we estimate that
they'll be equivalent to at least
LEED silver or better."
Stagner claimed that students
will notice differences between the
new and old buildings.

"There will be much more natu
ral lighting," he said. "By doing that
you open the building up so it
seems much more open and invit
ing. By having it more open and
spacious, it's a much more enjoy
able place to be."
Stagner added that the buildings
will be "more modular and flexi
ble" than previous structures on
campus, so that they can undergo
renovations without losing envi
ronmental efficiency.
"As the building use changes
over time," he said, "the interior
can be adjusted more easily with
out compromising the environmen
tal systems. Students might detect
this increased modularity and flex
ibility in the interior spaces in the
design of the buildings."
