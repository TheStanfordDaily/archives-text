Exotic Erotic is a party for the
voyeurs and the exhibitionists, the
supremely confident and the
supremely desperate. It belongs
with the epic, the legendary: Sun
splash. Mausoleum. Full Moon on the Quad.
It\sacan't-nuss,a don't-miss.a won't-miss. By
the end of the night, somewhere between
1,500 and 2,000 students — roughly a quarter
of the undergraduate population — will pass
through the doors of 680 Lomita.
The Office of Student Activities (OSA)
divides campus parties into five distinct lev
els. Level one and two parties are private
events, with guest lists and no campus public
ity. Exotic Erotic is level three, what's called
an "all-campus" — flyers are distributed.
SUIDs required and one security monitor
must be present for every 50 guests.
In the backyard of 680, Social Manager
Matti Hirpa '08 points out exactly where
those officers will stand.
"We're going to have one over here," he
says, indicating the bar. "And one there" —
by the stage — "there" — by the bathrooms
— "there" — in the corner — "there" — in
the other corner — "and two over there" —
by the doors.
And this is just level three.
"A level four is open to outsiders as well,"
explains Hirpa,"so you're pretty much never
allowed to do those. And a level five is some-

thing ridiculous. A level five
i5..."
He trails off for a moment,
searching for the right words.
"Something incompre
hensible."

Meanwhile, on the other
side of campus, one Wilbur
sophomore prepares to em
bark on the long walk to 680.
Kara, a Symbolic Sys
tems major, emerges from
Trancos, eyes shining with
excitement. Her blonde

hair is pulled back in a ponytail, and she
wears a pink bikini patterned with black
skulls.
"1 have to catch up with my friends," she
says immediately, pointing to two girls hold
ing hands in the distance. One wears a blue
floral nightgown: the other, a gauzy pink
baby doll over a lacy push-up bra.
"She's a freshman RA [Resident Assis
tant]," giggles Kara, gesturing to the one in
the pink. The girl stumbles and lets out a
shriek, clasping her friend's hand tighter.
This is a walk of shame to be proud of, a
perverse parade — part circus, part fashion
show —as students from every corner of
campus appear in negligible attire. After all.
less, as the flyers say. is more.
Kara's friends lead the way, two girls
zigzagging across the sidewalks of Mayfield.
Up ahead, a tall boy in boxers veers onto the
path. His tan arms encircle the waists of the
two girls beside him.

At the corner of Campus, two figures
stretch out on a beat-up couch, watching the
partygoers process. They don't laugh or call
out, but sit in silence — eyes roving up and
down bodies — as they wait for the street
light to illuminate the next passersby.The pa
raders avert their gaze, refusing to acknowl
edge their audience. The boys shift awkward
ly in their seats.
ITie caravan swells as it winds its way to
ward 680; tonight, everyone makes the same
pilgrimage. On the balcony of 2AE, a boy sits
in the shadows, looking down on the scene
from above.
Finally, Kara reaches the entrance to 680.
A police officer lets the girls past the barriers,
taking their tickets, beckoning them forward.
They weave through the line,flashing IDs and
they brace themselves for what lies ahead.

Entering the party is like setting foot on a
movie set; it's not real, just some Hollywood
producer's idea of a college party.The smell of
beer and sweat hangs in the air. mingled with

something sweet — pot,
maybe, or just the scent of a
California summer night. Bod
ies slapped together, skin
flashing in every direction. A
base thumps in the back
ground. music comes in waves
and it's all drowned out by the
talking, talking, talking under
the purple evening sky.
Kara wades through the
crowd, searching out familiar
faces. When she finds one, she
stops, and she takes in the
sights.

After a while, all the girls
and their clothes run together:

the lacy blue bra: the red corset; the pink fly
away with garters — it's just a blur of glossy
pages in a cheap magazine. The girl in the
rhinestone bikini is a striking exception.Turn
ing heads as she floats through the party, the
strings of crystals sparkle against her taut,
brown skin.
"She looks like a porn star." whispers one
girl, her voice hushed with awe.

* * *
It is just before midnight when the party
explodes.'Hie heat of a hundred bodies blasts
through the hallways. On the dance floor.
Kara is swept off her feet as if by the party's
undertow, raked through the crowd as it puls
es in time to the music.
At the edge of the rave room, a girl ties a
glow stick around her waist. It floats seduc
tively as she swivels her hips, grinding against
a boy.
Just then. Kara sees a friend. He gives her
a hug, one that's too long.

He leans in close, a few inches from her
face, pushing a sweaty clump of dark hair out
of his eyes, and says he wants to tell her a joke.
Kara smiles indulgently, but gives him a
puzzled look after the joke. He gives her an
other hug. then wanders away.
Outside,The Jakes, the second band of the
night, huddle together, debating what to play
next. The party waits for music under a navy
blue sky.

Behind the bar, 680 Resident Assistant
Leah Leff '08 swings around, swishing her
pink and green tutu as she pumps a keg. The
tone of the party has changed: students stum
ble through the backyard, pushing past each
other without a backward glance. Someone
pulls himself off the ground, grabbing the leg
of a stranger for support. She looks confused,
then shoves him away, disgusted. The party is
dying.
Kara looks back at the dance floor.
"1 just don't want to be here any more,"
she says, and she pushes her way to the door.
The music, the talking, the heat — it all fades.
Where the black paper has been torn from
the wall, you can see through to the dance
floor. There, a girl buries her face in her part
ner's chest, I lis hands around her waist, they
sway softly to slow music that doesn't play.
Kara shivers in the night air, wrapping her
arms around herself for warmth. Standing
alone in a dark parking lot. she looks — for
the first time that night — naked.
