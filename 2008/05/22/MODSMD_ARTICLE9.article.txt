Tenzin Chagzoetsang'lo,who is of Tibetan ori
gin. lives in Utah with his family. Tenzin's
mother, Pema.runs a resettlement project that
allows Tibetan refugees in India to come to
Utah and work in hopes of eventual citizen
ship. while Tenzin's father worked as a restaurant man
ager at Benihana.Tenzin's cousin. Yangchen '07, recent
ly graduated from Stanford and is also a Tibetan activist.
The Daily sat down with Tenzin in the Axe & Palm. He
shared his experiences as a Tibetan-American Stanford
student during the current controversy surrounding the
fact that China is hosting the 2(X)8 Olympics, despite its
laundry list of human rights violations — especially
those against Tibet.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What part of Tibet is your
family from?
Tenzin Chagzoetsang (TC): Kham. Tibet, which is
known for producing bigger, stronger Tibetan warriors,
but I haven't been to Tibet yet myself.
TSD: What language do they speak in Tibet?
TC: Tibetan. It's a completely different language than
any other Asian language — everything from its syntax,
writing and actual words are different, and it has many
different dialects within itself.
TSD: How involved have you been with the Olympic
Torch protests?

TC: My brother and I ac
tually went clown to San
Francisco and participat
ed in the protests and ral
lies a couple weeks back.
TSD: How was protest
ing? Win did you protest?
TC: It was an amazing ex
perience. It was amazing
to see so many people will
ing to interrupt such a sa
cred ceremony knowing
China's human rights vio
lations are the bigger
issue. I protested because 1

found it was a good opportunity as a Tibetan Stanford
student to show those who can't protest in Tibet that we
[American Tibetans] haven't forgotten them, despite
being comfortably situated in such a privileged country
as America.
TSD: How many people protested?
TC: Several thousands, I couldn't tell you exactly, but
what was really cool was that the majority of people
protesting were non-Tibetans. Richard Gere and Arch
bishop Desmond Tutu also came out to speak in favor of
human rights in Tibet.
TSD: So do you think China should ultimately be al
lowed to host the Olympics?
TC: No, but that is my personal view.
TSI): No? C an you explain why?
TC: I think their [China's) record of human rights viola
tions is not where it needs to be, and China doesn't up
hold the ideals and morals that hosting the Olympics en

tail. By hosting the Olympics and other countries partic
ipating. the world gets this subtle message that there are
no more problems in China, but that simply isn't the case.
This is evident by seeing the abuse a few months ago in
Tibet to the Tibetan people by the Chinese military. The
fact that you see a whole bunch of Tibetans risking their
lives and livelihoods during those riots shows that there
is still a lot of unresolved distress in Tibet. Watching the
situation also shows the unnecessary force and aggres
sion that the Chinese government permits its army to use
in situations like these.
TSD: Did you hear about the protestors that climbed the
Golden Gate Bridge and tied a pro-Tibet sign to the side
of the bridge?
TC |smirkingj: Yeah, I knew about it before it went up.
Good to know there are people that passionate about
Tibet.
TSI): How do you and other Tibet supporters answer ac
cusations that the Dalai Lama is instigating violence and
riots in Tibet?
TC: Absurd! Anyone who knows of the Dalai Lama, his
spiritual beliefs and what he stands for would know that
non-violent activism is synonymous with his being. He
won a Nobel Peace Prize for crying out loud!
TSD I m not saying you don't have a point, but that is
how China has responded to the Dalai Lama in the na
tional news outlets. So how have you been involved in
the China-Tibet situation since protesting in San Francis
co while the torch went through?
TC: I m part of a Stanford organization called "Stanford
Friends of Tibet" whose main goal is to raise awareness
about Tibet's situation, promote peaceful constructive
dialogue and encourage Stanford students' involvement
and action in the peace process.
TSI): Just for those interested, can you give some more
information about Stanford Friends of Tibet?
TC: We meet once a week to plan events such as candle

light vigils and documentary screenings. [Recent events
have included] a vigil for a little boy who was supposed
to he the heir to the Dalai Lama, but he was abducted by
the Chinese government and has not been seen in years.
The Chinese government claimed that he or his family
did not want anyone disturbing him. We ac-

tually don't know if he is still alive, brain-

washed, whatever. But that's what the

vigil is for. He is the Panchen Lama

TSD:Thanks for sharing your expe
riences. Tenzin. but lastly, do you
think China will ever confront the
Tibet issue and negotiate freedoms
and/or independence for the peo
ple of Tibet?

TC: I truly hope so. We all strive to
better ourselves, whether on a per
sonal level or a national level. 1 feel
like this issue will not go away and
dialogue and confronting the issue
would be a natural step for China to
take if they really do uphold the justice
they advocate. Hi mom!

spiritual beliefs and what he stands for would know that
non-violent activism is synonymous with his being. He
won a Nobel Peace Prize for crying out loud!
TSD I m not saying you don't have a point, but that is
how China has responded to the Dalai Lama in the na
tional news outlets. So how have you been involved in
the China-Tibet situation since protesting in San Francis
co while the torch went through?
TC: I m part of a Stanford organization called "Stanford
Friends of Tibet" whose main goal is to raise awareness
about Tibet's situation, promote peaceful constructive
dialogue and encourage Stanford students' involvement
and action in the peace process.
TSI): Just for those interested, can you give some more
information about Stanford Friends of Tibet?
TC: We meet once a week to plan events such as candle

light vigils and documentary screenings. [Recent events
have included] a vigil for a little boy who was supposed
to he the heir to the Dalai Lama, but he was abducted by
the Chinese government and has not been seen in years.
The Chinese government claimed that he or his family
did not want anyone disturbing him. We ac-

tually don't know if he is still alive, brain-

washed, whatever. But that's what the

vigil is for. He is the Panchen Lama

TSD:Thanks for sharing your expe
riences. Tenzin. but lastly, do you
think China will ever confront the
Tibet issue and negotiate freedoms
and/or independence for the peo
ple of Tibet?

TC: I truly hope so. We all strive to
better ourselves, whether on a per
sonal level or a national level. 1 feel
like this issue will not go away and
dialogue and confronting the issue
would be a natural step for China to
take if they really do uphold the justice
they advocate. Hi mom!
