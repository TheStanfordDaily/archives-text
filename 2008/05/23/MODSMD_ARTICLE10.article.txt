# Intermission Presents
## Indiana Jones back, badder than ever "Crystal Skull" delivers iconic Indy settings, action sequences 
### BETSY WALLS INTERMISSION 
"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull" shows its hero's silhouette before his face, an
apt acknowledgement of the long shadows cast by
the success and classic status of the first three films
of the series. Rather than casting pallor over the
film, however, these shadows provide a rich back
ground for the characters as their relationships
unfold during the fighting, digging and car-chasing
hijinks that an Indiana Jones movie simply requires.
From the start, the movie picks up the story as
easily as Indy does his iconic hat. Though the series,
like the actor, is older and wiser, the film explodes
with action, energy and unexpected humor.
World War II has come and gone since viewers
last saw Harrison Ford fighting the Nazis in the
pre-WWII era. Thankfully, as much times has
passed in Indy's world as in our own: The film is set
in the 19505. Cinema's favorite archaeologist is vis
ibly aged but unshakably badass as he faces off
against — who else? — the Communists. Plenty of
humor is mined from the period: anti-Communist
fervor, cookie-cutter suburbs and greased hair per
mit an entertaining look at the past while driving
the plot.
The action sequences and exotic settings are, as
they have always been, the basis of Indiana Jones's
immense appeal, and both are present in spades.
There is punching, kicking, shooting, sword-fighting,
punching on cars, shooting at cars, etc. "Kingdom"
has all the ruins, treasure maps and KGB that a ded
icated fan of the genre could desire. But director
Steven Spielt>£T£ uj&o that his actors treat
their characters as real people. Human motivation
and emotion are emphasized even in the clean,
close cinematography.
Ford is the center of the film and carries the role
as well he did in 1981. It's difficult not to admire a
character who can stare down death with an ironi
cal quip moments before achieving an ingenious
escape. Of course, Indy is such an intriguing hero
because he is more than just a fighter. Indy's clever
ness and vast knowledge of archaeology are as
important as his gun and whip, as we are reminded
when an incredulous Mutt (Shia Leßouef) asks,
"You're a teacher?" and the good Dr. Jones
responds, "Part-time." The scenes in which Indiana
puts on his professor pants to teach are equally, if
differently, entertaining than the car-chases. If
Stanford had an archaeology professor half as sexy,
the entire student body would be learning to speak
ancient Mayan.
Leßouef does an excellent job portraying his
jaded, enthusiastic, hot-tempered, slightly rebellious
— i.e., teenaged — character. If the similarities
between his character and Ford's are less than sub
tle, they are also more than amusing. Cate Blanchett
makes a formidable Red lady (who actually looks
better in blue) and gives depth to a villain who
could have been one-dimensional. Generally, the
interactions between the characters push the movie
beyond a standard action film, adding humor and
