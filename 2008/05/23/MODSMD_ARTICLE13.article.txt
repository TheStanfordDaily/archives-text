### GLEN JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Barack Obama has agreed to
deliver the commencement address
at Wesleyan University in place of
Sen. Edward Kennedy, who pulled
out Thursday after finding out he
had brain cancer.
Kennedy, 76, had planned to
address the graduates - including
stepdaughter Caroline Raclin
Sunday in Middletown. Conn. The
commencement exercises coincide
with 25th reunion festivities for his
son, Edward Kennedy Jr., who grad
uated from the school in 1983.
The Massachusetts Democrat
decided against making the trip after
suffering a seizure last Saturday and
undergoing a brain biopsy on
Monday. A malignant brain tumor
was diagnosed on Tuesday
As he did immediately after
returning home, Kennedy went sail
ing Thursday. He spoke briefly to
reporters at his home in Hyannis
Port, saying that he felt "very well"
and that the hospital workers had
been "just spectacular."
"We received an incredible
amount of wonderful notes and let
ters from friends and colleagues in
the Senate, as well as people here in

Massachusetts," he said.
The senator said the outpouring
of support he received, which includ
ed honks and waves from drivers on
his way home and hand-lettered
signs in his neighborhood, have been
"very uplifting, very touching. And
I'm grateful for all that."
Obama, who leads in the race for
the Democratic presidential nomi
nation, said he and Kennedy had
talked earlier in the week about the
Illinois senator delivering the com
mencement speech. Kennedy has
endorsed Obama in his race against
fellow Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton and has campaigned for
Obama.
"Considering what he's done for
me and for our country, there's noth
ing 1 wouldn't do for him," Obama
said in a statement. "So I'm looking
forward to standing in his place on
Sunday, even though I know 1 won't
be able to fill his shoes."
Spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter
said Kennedy accepted Obama's
offer to help "knowing it would be
an historic opportunity for the
school and all those attending. ...
He's enormously grateful to Sen.
Obama and the support he's
received from all of his colleagues
this last week."
