## Facebook facelift to clear clutter 
### MICHAEL LIEDTKE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Having nearly tripled its audi
ence and added about 20,000 new
applications over the past year,
Facebook Inc.'s popular online
hangout is about to undergo a
housecleaning.
Visitors who can't stand the
clutter that's been piling up will be
glad to see that the site's new look
sweeps disparate bits of informa
tion into categories marked by
tabs at the top of each user's cus
tomized home page.
Basic personal background and
interests will be filed under an
"info" tab, for instance, while news
about users' buddies' latest activi
ties will land under a "feed" tab.
pictures will be corralled in a
"photo" section and applications
will be easily located under a
"programs" tab. That content is
now scattered, creating a confus
ing mishmash that has frustrated
some Facebook users.
The facelift, in the works since
January, is to debut in June.
Besides tidying the site, the
overhaul should give users more
control over their profiles,
Facebook managers said
Wednesday as they previewed the
redesign at the startup's Palo Alto
headquarters. Users will be able to
magnify information they want to
emphasize and downplay other
features, for example.
Even so. many users are likely
to protest, said Mark Slee, the
Facebook product manager over
seeing the facelift.

"Change is difficult for our
users, even positive changes," Slee
said. "But we are pretty confident
that we can walk everyone
through this so they will be
engaged with the changes and
enjoy them."
Facebook has had to quell two
user rebellions since Mark
Zuckerberg started the site a little
over four years ago while he was
still an undergraduate at Harvard
University.
In 2006. users railed against a
feature called "news feed" as too
intrusive because it shared too
much information about their
activities. The backlash caused
Zuckerberg to apologize and
tweak the application to give users
more control over how the infor
mation was shared. The news feed
is now a Facebook staple.
Zuckerberg. 24, apologized
again late last year after a tracking
tool called "Beacon" caught users
off guard by broadcasting infor
mation about their shopping
habits and personal preferences
expressed by their activity at other
Web sites. Facebook decided to
allow users to turn off Beacon,
diminishing its reach and possible
value to advertisers.
Despite those hiccups,
Facebook has emerged as Silicon
Valley's hottest startup since
Internet search leader Google
Inc., which recently has been los
ing some of its prized employees
to Facebook. Ben Ling, a former
top engineer at Google, is part of
the team working on Facebook's
overhaul.

Microsoft Corp. put its stamp
of approval on Facebook late last
year by paying $240 million for a
1.6 percent stake in the startup - a
deal that implied a $15 billion
value for Facebook.
Since dropping a $47.5 billion
offer to buy Yahoo Inc.. Microsoft
reportedly has been mulling a bid
for Facebook, although
Zuckerberg has repeatedly indi
cated he wants to preserve the pri
vately held company's independ
ence.
Facebook turned into a poten
tial gold mine as it extended
beyond its initial goal of allowing
college students swap information
about each other. The site now has
70 million users worldwide, up
from about 24 million a year ago.
Zuckerberg's decision to open
Facebook to outside applications
last year has played a key role in
Facebook's rapid growth. Since
then, developers have contributed
20.000 applications that make it
easier to distribute photos, share
music and play games.
But all those programs were
starting to make Facebook look
jumbled - a problem that also has
plagued the Internet's largest
social network. News Corp.'s
Myspace.com.
Facebook is trying to address
the situation without alienating
the outside developers who
helped fuel the site's success,
lliat's taken on added importance
since Google launched a network
last year to help developers create
applications to run on multiple
Web sites.
