## Editorial Board Draw process moving in right direction 
### 
Tomorrow, as many students know, is
when housing assignments are an
nounced, and Draw season, except for
the in-house Draw, is nearly over. The ques
tion on everyone's mind now is: "Will my
number get me into that place?" With only
the variable results of past years to go on.
there is always some uncertainty; hut, this
year, some changes in the Draw process
bring even more questions about how the
numbers will be affected. Housing has made
quite a few positive changes in the Draw for
this school year, but their implications re
main to be seen.
The most noticeable changes to the Draw
landscape are that Xanadu will be out of
commission for fall quarter of next year and
that Casa Zapata and Serra are going back
to their pre-Munger configurations: the sin
gles facing the construction site will be re
converted into doubles. Trancos will now
house only transfers,so Burbank will remain
an all-frosh dorm next year. But these types
of changes happen every year to accommo
date construction and changes in the size of
the incoming classes of freshmen and trans
fer students.
One of the biggest changes to the Draw
this year is the ability for Draw groups to
rank 16 choices for their residence choices as
opposed to the eight choices that have been
available in recent memory. This change will
hopefully eliminate the problem of students
who are locked out of their top eight choices
and subsequently assigned to an arbitrary
residence. Moving toward more choices in
dicates that Housing recognizes students'

desire to live in a place that they actually
rank. The only downside is the difficulty of
agreeing on 16 choices, as opposed to only
eight.
This change in the preference-ranking
system will hopefully assuage the negative
effect of the larger-than-normal draw pool.
The Class of 2011, approximately 150 stu
dents larger than the average class, enters
the Draw this year and makes getting into
each residence slightly more difficult. We
hope that increased choice of residences will
allow more students to end up in a house or
dorm in which they are choosing to live, de
spite the glut of extra students in the Draw.
Another very visible change is the start of
the gender-neutral housing pilot program in
Mirrielees.Castano.Narnia andTerra.This is
a great start to a program that will hopefully
expand into true gender-neutral housing op
tions in the coming years. However, under
the current structure, gender-neutral hous
ing cannot exist without gender-neutral
Draw groups. Given the ease with which co
ed draw groups are split in the residence as
signment process, students seeking gender
neutral housing may be dissuaded from
drawing together. A gender-blind assign
ment process will be needed to make gender
blind housing truly effective.
This Draw season has seen some positive
changes by 1 lousing to improve the way stu
dents pick their housing each year. These
steps are excellent moves as part of a broad
er agenda of making the Draw less stressful
and a more constructive experience for stu
dents.
