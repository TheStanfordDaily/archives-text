# Sick Sad World
## Date-A-Palooza 
### 
It's May! Flower petals clog the gutters of
Mayfield, freshmen have stopped caring
about I HUM, and The Claw has once
again become the bathtub of campus. In the
spirit of the moment, 1 think it's time to drop
my dire predictions of gloom and doom, and
introduce a clearly wonderful and well
timed concept: Date-A-Palooza.
The concept behind Date-A-Palooza is
fairly straightforward. Developed by my
friend, who we will call Matt for privacy's
sake, the goal of Date-A-Palooza is simply
to rack up as many dates as possible by the
end of the school year. Matt's justification
for such a bold campaign? "Reducing awk
wardness, both in the present and future."
Matt believes that "getting a job and try
ing to date — it's going to be awkward. You
might as well get used to the awkwardness
in a non-threatening environment. I figure
that after, say. ten dates, you should be a pro
at handling awkward dating situations. It's
about coping mechanisms — I am trying to
establish coping mechanisms for future,
possibly awkward scenarios."
Undeniably, there is a deep and mean
ingful campus-wide relationship with the
awkward. TTiere are both pro- and anti-awk
ward Facebook groups. There is the awk
ward turtle hand gesture, along with the
awkward penguin dance of awkwardness.
The use of the word and the actual state of
being permeate our campus in an anxious
mist.
Most people seem somewhat content to
bathe in awkwardness without searching for
a cure. We take awkwardness, especially in
the avenue of wooing, as an insurmountable
roadblock.
But Date-A-Palooza offers hope. Matt's
faith in the amelioration of awkwardness
through repeated exposure is inspiring. Stu
dents of Stanford, here is my weekly call to
action: Embrace possible failure and short
comings. grow a metaphorical sack, and ask
someone out.
Now. I know that my calls to action often
go unheeded. When I begged that the Row
boycott Admit Weekend's dry policy by
being social during admit weekend, the only
event that I could find on campus involved
playing spin-the-bottle in Rains. When I im
plored you to reconsider the assumed role of
women in the bedroom,only my staunch fol
lowing of radical feminist readers who live in
the Hast Bay responded to my plea. When I
asked for the option to submit soft copies in
stead of hard copies, I received six angry let
ters from various TA's, but no change. But
this week's plea is different. It's altruistic. It
has the capacity for fun. It might end with
you getting laid.
I want you to overcome your fear of pos
sible rejection before you're shoved out into
the Real World. Hell. I want to overcome my
fear of possible rejection. What are we so
afraid of, anyway?

I think a lot of our fear of dating stems
from the fact that most of us just haven't
done a lot of it. Co-ed dorms, bless their
hearts, make it very easy to by-pass the for
mal getting-to-know you phase. Instead,
most of us skip dinner and a movie and go
straight to the would-you-like-to-watch-a
movie-on-my-futon phase. Don't get me
wrong — this arrangement has its merits.
But I get the feeling that this tactic just won't
fly at work: Hey, Joe...why don't you stay
after hours and we can watch Apple trailers
on my laptop in the conference room? Now
that's awkward.
It's clear that we need to get used to the
idea of dating in order to avoid creepy en
trapment situations like the one depicted
above. However, because no one goes on
dates, the idea seems very formal. But hon
estly. how else are you supposed to get used
to the idea if you never do it? Practice makes
perfect, and if you never practice, then
you're sure as hell never going to be perfect.
So. let's all practice together and make a
good time of it!
When I ranted to some of my friends
about the gloriousness of a campus-wide
Date-A-Palooza, a bizarre objection involv
ing the balance of power was brought to the
table. I listened as my friends said things like,
"I'd need to wait for someone to ask me out.
If I were to ask someone out, then the
power-dynamic would be all off." Converse
ly, one of my guy friends said," I wouldn't ask
a girl I actually liked out on a date. If she said
no. then the future prospect of dating her
would be foiled. I'd have lost control be
cause of moving too soon."
This rhetoric of turn-taking and power
exchange is, for lack of a better phrase,
dumb. While my friends and I were off de
bating the politics of power in dating rituals,
valuable time to date and possibly to
smooch was squandered. Stanford students,
it is a beautiful thing that we have such agile
and analytical minds, but sometimes, we
need to learn how to turn them off. A date is
just a date. It doesn't have to be a political
power struggle, it doesn't have to be an audi
tion for the role of life-partner.
A date should, however, involve food,
beverage, or an activity. And perhaps a trip
to the magnetic wall. Just a friendly sugges
tion for as you embark on your own Date-A-
Palooza.
