She ran into me in Balboa Park in San
Jose. She was carrying a sign that said
"free hugs"; I was carrying a rice cake.
"Would you like a free hug?"she asked. And
while naturally I questioned her motives, I
nevertheless entered into the warm embrace,
enveloped in gentle arms.
When the hug was over. 1 had to ask.
"What is this? Why are you doing this?" Most
things these days have strings attached, after
all. She proceeded to tell me the story of her
Movement, the Free Hugs Campaign. When
it was all over, with my heartstrings pulled
and my day now brighter. I walked on my
merry way, wanting to join the Movement
myself, to spread the love she had just shared
with me. I had truly experienced a random
act of kindness. Sometimes, 1 mused, it's the
simple things in life that make it all better.
Or, rather, this is how the interaction
would have gone if I were someone else. In
stead of an unquestioning acceptance of a
message that is perceived as universal and
agreeable, 1 approached the situation with a
healthy amount of skepticism.
For those of you who haven't been hug
mobbed in the park or seen the You Tube
video about the Free Hugs Campaign, it is a
movement started by Australian Juan Mann
whose mission is to hug random people in
public places. To quote the Web site, the goal
of the hug movement is "making someone's
day a little brighter, meeting people and
showing the world that strangers aren't so
bad after all." Furthermore, "It's also about

bringing people together and sharing a
happy moment before heading back out into
the world feeling a little lighter."
This is an albeit paraphrased, but still
complete, description of the movement. Its
simplicity is its driving force: all people need
is someone to approach them and show them
that someone cares, and the world will be
come a brighter place.
And what a delightful message! I love free
things. I love hugs. What could go wrong
here? Hugs are great! Hugs bring happiness,
and happiness is great! Everyone wins!
We as a society have somehow gotten it
into our heads that if something is simple, we
shouldn't question it. But if you think about
it. this statement is misguided at best and
dangerous at worst.
The simplicity of the Free Hugs campaign
is, in actuality, its downfall. The moment one
begins to question the Free Hugs campaign —
which.by the way,you will be labeled heartless
for doing, as if you had said "I hate baby kit
tens!" — one begins to see the campaign for
what it is: a comfortable protest.

This is a "movement" for our generation:
minimal effort, maximal self-gratification and
a nearly zero real effect. The informational
video describing the Free Hug campaign on
YouTUbe has received 27 million views. People
feel they are part of a Movement with a capital
M, that they don't have to question member
ship in this Movement because 27 million
other people thought it was a good idea.
But who are these Free Huggers hugging?
Ironically, not the people who need it most.
As I read the 120-page "Illustrated Guide
to Free Hugs" available on the Movement's
site, complete with 40 illustrations highlight
ing 30 separate styles of hug, I realized that
the free huggers are not supposed to ap
proach anyone for a hug, but rather get the
hugs from people who approach them.
While this may eliminate problems in
which hugger preference is the deciding factor,
it still doesn't account for the problem of per
verts. All it takes is for one person who longs
for human contact and hasn't had any for
awhile to touch a butt during a hug, and the
free hugger might begin to question the move
ment. A hug is, in many ways, an inherently sex
ual gesture, a fact that the Free Hugs move
ment doesn't acknowledge. The hugger might
think twice before frequenting that area again.
Add to that the pivotal question of
"why?" It is a mighty convenient thing that
the central message of this campaign is so
inarguable. Could it be possible that huggers
