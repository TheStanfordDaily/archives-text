NOTES: In order to win the Pac-10, Stan
ford will have to sweep its weekend se
ries against Washington, while Arizona
State will have to lose all three of their
games to Arizona. Junior Jeremy Bleich,
the Cardinal's ace entering the year, re
turned from injury last weekend and will
factor into Stanford's pitching plans
against the Huskies.

You never quite realize how great it is to
be home until you have been gone for a
while. Stanford baseball is wrapping up its
season with two weeks away from the Farm
and would love nothing more than to come
home to Klein Field at Sunken Diamond for
NCAA Regional play next weekend. But. to
be awarded home field for the first round,
the Cardinal is first going to have contend
with the University of Washington in Seattle
this weekend.
"I'd say we probably need to take two out
of three up there [to get home field advan
tage]," said junior second baseman Cord
Phelps. "But it's important not to get ahead

of ourselves. We still have to finish the regu
lar season and get our job done before we
think too much about the postseason."
Getting the job done will be very impor
tant for the Card, and not just to earn home
field advantage. Stanford (31-20-2.12-9 Pac
-10) has struggled recently — dropping its
last two series 1-2 after having won 12
straight series — and slid down to No. 16 in
the national rankings after reaching a high
of No. 3 at the end of April. The skid has es
sentially cost Stanford the Pac-10 title — the
Card would need to sweep Washington and
have Arizona sweep Arizona State this
weekend to come out on top.
At this point, as Phelps said, Stanford just
needs to forget about the conference and
home field and simply get back to winning.

Momentum is the key to the playoffs, and a
winning series is the only way to advance.
It won't be easy to start another series
win streak in Washington, though. The
I luskies (32-20,10-11 Pac-10) were swept by
conference-leading Arizona State in Tempe
last weekend, but had won seven of their last
eight previously and are 22-8 in Seattle.
Their lineup boasts six players batting above
.300 and is powered by junior outfielder
Kyle Conley with 18 home runs and 55 RBI.
The Huskies' weekend rotation all hold
ERAs below 3.60, and the entire pitching
staff has held opponents to a batting average
of just .252 on the year.
