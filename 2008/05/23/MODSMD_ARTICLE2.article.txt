NOTES: In order to win the Pac-10, Stan
ford will have to sweep its weekend se
ries against Washington, while Arizona
State will have to lose all three of their
games to Arizona. Junior Jeremy Bleich,
the Cardinal's ace entering the year, re
turned from injury last weekend and will
factor into Stanford's pitching plans
against the Huskies.

You never quite realize how great it is to
be home until you have been gone for a
while. Stanford baseball is wrapping up its
season with two weeks away from the Farm
and would love nothing more than to come
home to Klein Field at Sunken Diamond for
NCAA Regional play next weekend. But. to
be awarded home field for the first round,
the Cardinal is first going to have contend
with the University of Washington in Seattle
this weekend.
"I'd say we probably need to take two out
of three up there [to get home field advan
tage]," said junior second baseman Cord
Phelps. "But it's important not to get ahead

of ourselves. We still have to finish the regu
lar season and get our job done before we
think too much about the postseason."
Getting the job done will be very impor
tant for the Card, and not just to earn home
field advantage. Stanford (31-20-2.12-9 Pac
-10) has struggled recently — dropping its
last two series 1-2 after having won 12
straight series — and slid down to No. 16 in
the national rankings after reaching a high
of No. 3 at the end of April. The skid has es
sentially cost Stanford the Pac-10 title — the
Card would need to sweep Washington and
have Arizona sweep Arizona State this
weekend to come out on top.
At this point, as Phelps said, Stanford just
needs to forget about the conference and
home field and simply get back to winning.

Momentum is the key to the playoffs, and a
winning series is the only way to advance.
It won't be easy to start another series
win streak in Washington, though. The
I luskies (32-20,10-11 Pac-10) were swept by
conference-leading Arizona State in Tempe
last weekend, but had won seven of their last
eight previously and are 22-8 in Seattle.
Their lineup boasts six players batting above
.300 and is powered by junior outfielder
Kyle Conley with 18 home runs and 55 RBI.
The Huskies' weekend rotation all hold
ERAs below 3.60, and the entire pitching
staff has held opponents to a batting average
of just .252 on the year.

not being able to hold down the Arizona offense — the team
allowed 29 runs on the weekend, most of them coming in big
innings.
"We take the attitude that if we allow 10 runs, we need to
score 11," Phelps said. "It is the same the other way as well. If
we only score four, we need to hold them to three."
That is the attitude of a team that truly plays together, but
this team is going to have to allow less than 29 runs per series if

they are going to be suc
cessful this weekend and
beyond. One reason to
believe those numbers
will improve is the return
of Stanford's preseason
ace, junior southpaw Je
remy Bleich.
"Jeremy is one of our
best pitchers," said
Phelps."Seeing him back
out there was great. We
know he is going to get
the job done whatever
the situation, and I look
forward to being able to
play behind him the rest
of the way."
Bleich came out of
the bullpen on Monday
at Arizona and got the
final two outs before the

game was called due to Stanford's travel arrangements. It was
his first appearance since being injured in late March and,
while it remains to be seen how long of outings he will be able
to make, his presence is a big boost to this team at a time when
it really needs a pickup.
"All of us are pushing really hard to get to [the College
World Series]," said Phelps. "That is our goal and has been
since the start of the year. Even if we don't make it, this has
been a good season because we have improved so much from
last year, but we aren't satisfied with that. We want to go to
Omaha."
If Stanford can get back on a roll this weekend, that goal will
be reasonably within reach. The first game is tonight at 6:30
p.m. while the Saturday game is set for 2 p.m. and the final reg
ular season game Sunday at 1 p.m. All three will be broadcast
