# OP-ED
## A 						well-deserved thank you 
### 
Provost Etchemendy Ph.D. '82, Vice
Provost Boardman and Associate Vice
Provost Griffith exerted a diligent and
caring effort in helping Students Con
fronting Apartheid by Israel (SCAI) bring
back its exhibit. On a campus where critics of
the administration are louder than its fans 1
believe that these leaders deserve a heartfelt
"thank you" for their efforts. They carefully
listened to students' demands, clearly ex
plained where they stood on the issue and
toiled for a solution that pleased us all. My in

teractions with them during the last few
weeks reflected the fact that they care deeply
for the students and sincerely have Stan
ford's best interests in mind. I am proud to
belong to an institution with such consider
ate, intelligent and reliable administrators. In
the name of the hundreds of Stanford stu
dents that became worried when the photos
came down: thank you.
Amanda Gelender '09 and Zaid Adhami
'10 also deserve a warm thank you. They
planned the protest that garnered the atten

tion of the administration and The Daily.
Without their quick planning and mobiliza
tion, the exhibit may have not been reinstat
ed. Their efforts stand as a monument to
what students can achieve when they set
their minds to restoring their rights on cam
pus. I say to them and to all the students that
came out on that day of protest: thank you.
The Stanford Daily also deserves a thank
you. Its reporters made sure the students re-
mained fully informed â€” and that's
an extremely important accomplish
ment. Patrick Fitzgerald reported on
this story from day one and re
mained objective throughout the
whole ordeal. 1 would like to thank
him and everyone on The Daily for
their reporting.
Quick and beneficial change can
only happen when students set their
minds to building a better campus
community, and when the adminis
tration has the students' best interest
in mind. As students, however, we
sometimes tend to forget our role in
making campus a better place for us,
and a more beneficial place for the
world. This task cannot be kept to
the administration alone because, in

many cases, administrators simply
do not know our needs. Moreover,
our needs may sometimes be
eclipsed by issues the University
may deem more important. Differ
ent administrative issues may pre
vent the University from taking the
average student's desires into full
consideration.
We must not shrink from the re
sponsibility of making our voices
heard. With administrators like
Provost Etchemendy, Vice Provost
Boardman and Associate Vice
Provost Griffith to listen, and stu
dents like Zaid. Amanda and the
dozens that protested outside Old
Union to speak, 1 think our Univer
sity is on the right path. Let's keep
moving forward.
