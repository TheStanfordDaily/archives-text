Steve Young speaks on "What Matters Most"
NFL Hall-of-Fame quarterback and former 49er Steve
Young addressed a crowd of a couple hundred at the Hewlett
Teaching Center yesterday, explaining to the audience how his
experiences in football have shaped his personal foundation.
Young, a resident of Palo Alto, engaged the crowd with his
anecdotes and often self-deprecating humor. He emphasized
the three fundamental things in his life which matter most
love, personal accountability and personal improvement. "My
thing is to see how good I can get, how great I can get," Young
said.
As a whole. Young urged the audience to approach life with
a straightforward and positive attitude.
"Life is going on," he said. "We're moving forward,
whether you like it or not. You can lay in bed all day, you can
waste all the time you want; life's still going on.
"The quest became so energizing," Young said, speaking
about his own life."How good can you be?"
