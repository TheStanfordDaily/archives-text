## Women fall in quarters Stanford upset in both team and individual play to end season 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's tennis team
officially finished its season yesterday, bowing
out of the NCAA Championships much earli
er than expected.
But after a long week in Tulsa, the Cardinal
women must be glad to return to the Farm.
The 2(X)8 Championships did not treat
Stanford very well. After a loss to No. 5 Baylor
in the quarterfinals of the team tournament,
the Cardinal women fell individually yester
day.
On Thursday, freshman Hilary Barte lost 6-
3, 6-2 to Baylor's Lenka Broosova in the
round of 32, ending her eye-catching rookie
season.
Hours later, the doubles team of Barte and
sophomore Lindsay Burdette fell 7-6 (3). 6-2
to William & Mary's Megan Moulton-Levy
and Katarina Zoricic.
Broosova defeated Barte in early Febru
ary at the National Indoors 6-2,2-6.6-3. How
ever, Stanford was able to come back for the
4-2 win.
Now, Broosova is on fire. She has won 19
consecutive matches and now boasts a 50-4
record on the season.
Barte, who has had a fine season herself,
could do little to stop Broosova. With the loss,
Barte finishes 30-8 overall and 21-6 against
nationally ranked opponents.
However, she was a mortal 7-6 on neutral
courts, which may explain the upset.
Similarly, Barte and Burdette had faced
Moulton-Levy and Zoricic earlier this sea
son. dropping an 8-3 decision back in early
March.
Despite being ranked ninth in the country,
Barte and Burdette quickly lost in the open
ing round, finishing the season 17-12 overall
entirely at the No. 1 spot.
Though winning six of their last nine
matches overall, the duo suffered a key loss
against Baylor in the quarterfinals.
Simply put. the Cardinal now has the sum
mer to recuperate and learn from a tumul
tuous season. Forced to learn to play the road,
Stanford appeared to have hit its stride enter
ing the NCAA Championships.
But unfortunate injuries and bad timing
continued to plague the Cardinal, as Pac-10
rival UCLA took home the national title.
Despite the losses and a less than happy
ending, Stanford persevered when the team
could have collapsed under the pressure. With
strong wins against UCLA.CaI and Southern
California, the Cardinal preserved the Pac-10
title and showed a strong fighting spirit.
But. ultimately, the 2008 season just wasn't
meant to be for Stanford.

Freshman Hilary Barte and the rest of the women's tennis team will be heading home early from the NCAA Champi
onships after losing to Baylor in team play. Barte, Stanford's top player, was defeated in both individual and doubles play.
Despite going undefeated at home, the Cardinal was unable to produce results, which led to its NCAA loss.
