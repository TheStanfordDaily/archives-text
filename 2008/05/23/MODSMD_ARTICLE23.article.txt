# Crew kept out of NCAAs
## Stanford shunned despite top five ranking 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Ranked No. 5 in the country, the Stanford
women's rowing team battled injuries and adversi
ty throughout the year, culminating in a second
place finish at the Pac-10 Championships last
weekend. However, of the 12 teams invited to the
team NCAA Championships next weekend in
Gold River, Calif., the Cardinal was not among
them.
The announcement of the NCAA Champi
onship field, administered on TUesday, was espe
cially shocking to the Cardinal, considering that
Washington State and Washington — which fin
ished third and fourth, respectively, behind Stan
ford at Pac-lOs — were invited to the Champi
onship.
"When they invited the teams that finished
below us, we were surprised," said coach Yasmin
Farooq. "The fact that they selected two teams

below us essentially nullifies the value of the re
gional qualifier."
Several coaches at other schools have also ex
pressed their shock to the Stanford women, includ
ing the coach of Washington. Michael Callahan.
"It's nothing personal against either of those
teams," Farooq said. "Those coaches, too, were
stunned. They were stunned to hear that Stanford
did not get a team bid. I had a call from the Cal
coach within 10 minutes of the selection. Everyone
was just shocked."
"Every one of my friends was like, that seems
so unjust, how could they do that?" senior Jessi
Reel added."My personal hunch is that there's just
a lot of politics involved."
According to the committee, the Cardinal was
not invited because of its weaker second varsity
eight squad. That said. Stanford's second varsity
eight defeated the counterpart squads on the
Washington and Washington state teams at the
I'ac-lOs. As a whole, those in the rowing communi
ty — on the Farm or off — agree that the decision
to exclude the Stanford team from NCAAs was a
clear mistake.

The Cardinal finished at No. sin the country and second in the Pac-10, but it was not among the 12 teams selected to participate
in the NCAA Championships. Shockingly, both Washington schools, who finished below Stanford in the Pac-10, received bids.
"1 think the committee made a
mistake. 1 think they got it wrong,"
Farooq said. "The committee got it
wrong, and I've never received so
many phone calls and emails from so
many coaches across the country.
[They were] emails and calls of utter
disbelief."
The decision was final, however,
and the Cardinal has accepted it and
moved on. The team's season isn't
over, either: as a consolation of sorts,
the first varsity eight received an at
large bid to the Championships and
will have a chance to avenge the de
cision at next weekend s competi
tion. If anything, they may be more
motivated than they would have
been before.
"Knowing that we still have

NCAAs ahead of us, if anything this
just gives the varsity eight a little in
spiration," said Farooq.
"It's fueling the fire that already
existed but is now more passionate
beeause it's for everybody else, as
well," Reel added. "The goal for the
next week is just [to] focus in and con
tinue improving on our speed, and we
leave for nationals in one week."
And though the decision by the
NCAA ended Stanford's decision
when it came to the team champi
onship. both Farooq and Reel were
able to reflect on a season in which
the team developed greatly in spite
of a short squad, numerous injuries
and illness. The team had literally all
of its members — except for one —
competing at the Pac-lOs while
squads like Washington carry well
over 50 members.
"It was a really huge accomplish
ment [to finish in second place at
Pac-lOs] given the lineups and what
was going on with our team," Reel

said. "It was fun to pull this win out
that people didn't expect."
"As far as the whole season is con
cerned. it's been an amazing year."
Farooq said. "I think the fact that we
have sueh a small group of people
and their performing at such a high
level speaks really highly of the char
acter of this team."
In particular, Farooq looks to use
this experience as a positive and con
structive one for the program in
coming years.
"I think that the future for Stan
ford women's rowing is incredibly
bright, and I hope that this team will
take away from this experience," she
said. "No one can ever take the
weekend away from us at Pac-lOs. It
was an excellent season capped by a
phenomenal I J ac-10 championships,
and this is just the beginning for this
team "
