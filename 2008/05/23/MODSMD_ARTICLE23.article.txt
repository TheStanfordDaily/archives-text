# Crew kept out of NCAAs
## Stanford shunned despite top five ranking 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Ranked No. 5 in the country, the Stanford
women's rowing team battled injuries and adversi
ty throughout the year, culminating in a second
place finish at the Pac-10 Championships last
weekend. However, of the 12 teams invited to the
team NCAA Championships next weekend in
Gold River, Calif., the Cardinal was not among
them.
The announcement of the NCAA Champi
onship field, administered on TUesday, was espe
cially shocking to the Cardinal, considering that
Washington State and Washington — which fin
ished third and fourth, respectively, behind Stan
ford at Pac-lOs — were invited to the Champi
onship.
"When they invited the teams that finished
below us, we were surprised," said coach Yasmin
Farooq. "The fact that they selected two teams

below us essentially nullifies the value of the re
gional qualifier."
Several coaches at other schools have also ex
pressed their shock to the Stanford women, includ
ing the coach of Washington. Michael Callahan.
"It's nothing personal against either of those
teams," Farooq said. "Those coaches, too, were
stunned. They were stunned to hear that Stanford
did not get a team bid. I had a call from the Cal
coach within 10 minutes of the selection. Everyone
was just shocked."
"Every one of my friends was like, that seems
so unjust, how could they do that?" senior Jessi
Reel added."My personal hunch is that there's just
a lot of politics involved."
According to the committee, the Cardinal was
not invited because of its weaker second varsity
eight squad. That said. Stanford's second varsity
eight defeated the counterpart squads on the
Washington and Washington state teams at the
I'ac-lOs. As a whole, those in the rowing communi
ty — on the Farm or off — agree that the decision
to exclude the Stanford team from NCAAs was a
clear mistake.

The Cardinal finished at No. sin the country and second in the Pac-10, but it was not among the 12 teams selected to participate
in the NCAA Championships. Shockingly, both Washington schools, who finished below Stanford in the Pac-10, received bids.
