## Stanford vies for World Series bid against A&M 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 12 seeded Stanford
Softball team has already broken a
number of team records and ad
vanced further than last year's
squad. Now, the Cardinal has the
chance to go down as one of the
greatest teams in Stanford softball
history.
After defeating the University
of Massachusetts 6-0 last weekend
behind a no-hitter from junior
pitcher Missy Penna, Stanford will
play No. 5 Texas A&M in a best-of
three NCAA Super Regional this
weekend for a berth in the
Women's College World Series.
Stanford (49-13) has made two
trips to the World Series in pro
gram history, in 2001 and 2004, be
fore getting bogged down in the
earlier rounds the last three years.
This year, a special ace put an
equally special team on her back
and carried it into the Super Re
gional in College Station, Texas.
Penna allowed a grand total of
zero earned runs in four complete
games in the Regionals, capping it
all off with a no-hitter in the clinch
ing game against UMass, which

Texas A&M's Megan Gibson threw no-hit
ters in the final games of their Regional Fi
nals. While the Cardinal possesses more
power than the Aggies, Texas A&M hits on
average much better than Stanford does.

started just minutes after a loss to
the same team.
Penna's superlative perform
ance — and a hefty dose of backup
from her offense — means that
Stanford and Texas A&M (52-7)
will likely get the chance to treat
spectators with a pitcher's duel of
rare quality. Aggies ace Megan
Gibson matched Penna's no-hitter
in Texas A&M's own Regional

final, a 6-0 victory over Louisiana Tech.
The parallels between the all-star pitchers do not
end there. Gibson has recorded 36 wins this season
against only one loss, with a 0.92 ERA and 304 strike
outs. Penna, pitching in the tougher Pac-10, went 37-11
with a 1.00 ERA (the second-best mark in Cardinal
history if it holds) and struck out an eye-popping 411
batters.
In a series featuring two pitchers with such excep
tional talent, along with a flair for the dramatic, each
game may hinge on one hit.
Stanford's sophomore catcher, Rosey Neill. has
been uncorking hits like that all season long. Neill has
19 home runs, tied for the single-season Cardinal

record, and 52 RBI to lead the Cardinal. Junior short
stop Maddy Coon is not far behind with 40 RBI. part
ly the result of nine home runs and 13 doubles.
Both Neill and Coon also draw a prodigious num
ber of walks, with on-base percentages more than 100
points higher than their batting averages, giving the
hitters behind them a chance to do damage,as well. Se
nior third baseman Michelle Smith has also driven in
40 runs this season, usually with Neill or Coon on base.
Texas A&M can only counter with one true slugger,
but what the Aggies lack in power they more than
make up for in batting average. In addition to her
pitching, Gibson has smacked 13 homers this year and
has 47 RBI. both team highs by wide margins.

However, Texas A&M hits .302 as a team, more
than 20 points better than Stanford, and has three reg
ulars hitting over .300, with two others knocking at the
door. The Aggies' RBI have been more spread out
than Stanford's,but the Big-12 team still knocked in 12
more runs than the Cardinal despite playing fewer
games.
Stanford and Texas A&M will play their first game
on Saturday at 6 p.m. PST, with another game to follow
on Sunday afternoon at 2:30. If the teams split the first
two games,a third, winner-take-all game will start half
an hour after the first Sunday game finishes.
