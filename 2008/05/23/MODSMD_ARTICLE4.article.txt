# Former provost hopes to write, teach on the Farm
## Rice plans return to Stanford 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested Thurs
day that she would likely he returning to Stanford after
she completes her service in the Bush administration,
saying she looked forward to writing about her public
service experience and returning to the classroom.
Speaking at a news conference with British Foreign
Secretary David Miliband at the Google campus in
Mountain View. Rice said she views the Silicon Valley as
her "natural habitat."
"1 have been at Stanford since said Rice, who is
currently on leave from the University. "I had a life long
before being national security advisor and being secre
tary of state. I expect to have a life after."
Rice said she hopes she will have an opportunity to
pursue writing and reflect on her experience serving in
the Bush administration.
"This has been a fundamentally different period in
American history and a period of great consequence,"
Rice said. "And it's not something you can reflect on from
within."
Rice said she also hopes to resume her previous prac
tice of coordinating policy simulations that allow stu
dents to adopt roles as high-level decision-makers in the
executive branch and craft policies that respond to mock
events that mirror real-world security challenges. Rice
said she hopes students will "get a little taste of how it's
actually not so easy to make those decisions."
"1 look forward to having an opportunity in the class
room again to discuss the dilemmas that we've faced, par
ticularly since September 11," Rice said.
If Rice were to come back to the Farm immediately
after her service as secretary of state, her return would
closely follow the controversial appointment of former
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as a distin
guished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.The ap
pointment of the former Bush administration official
sparked considerable uproar among many students, fac
ulty and staff members who objected to some of the deci
sions he made during his tenure, particularly those relat
ed to the conduct of the Iraq War.
"Universities aught to be places in which all points of
view are both represented and welcomed," Rice said. "If
universities are not open to views, no matter how contro
versial, I don't know where the practices of the freedom
of ideas will be carried out."
"1 was provost at Stanford." Rice added. "And if
there's one thing I defended, and defended uncondition
ally, it was the right of the faculty to hold whatever view
they have and to express it freely."
Rice said she does not anticipate a large public outcry
against her return.
"We'll see if people want me back." Rice said."l think
so."
Rice's remarks came during a two-day trip with
Miliband through Silicon Valley, where the officials
toured high-tech firms and received briefings on renew
able energy development.
During her remarks at Google's headquarters. Rice
defended the interrogation tactics against terrorist sus
pects approved by the Bush administration in the after
math of the September 1 1 attacks. Although she refused
to discuss internal deliberations within the administra
tion. Rice acknowledged that "a lot has happened, and a
lot has evolved in these years" since the attacks.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveled to northern
California with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband
to receive briefings on renewable energy development.
"As the United States did before,
it's going to continue to live up to its
laws domestically as well as to its
international obligations," Rice said.
"And I think Americans expect the
president to do whatever he can with
in the law to protect Americans."
Rice also discussed the efforts of
the International Atomic Energy
Agency (lAEA) and an international
coalition of industrialized countries to
persuade Iran to halt its enrichment
and reprocessing activities.
"One of the strongest parts of our
policy has been to require Iran to be

fully transparent with the lAEA,
which should have the right to the full
array of inspections in Iran," Rice
said. "If Iran has peaceful intent, as
they say. then they should have no
problem with the International
Atomic Energy Agency having com
plete. absolute and total access, and
the word that is coming out is that
that is not being provided to the
lAEA."
Putting politics aside. Rice said she
was inspired by the spirit of creativity
and innovation that encapsulates
Silicon Valley.
"I look forward to the date when I
can be here on a more regular basis,"
she said.
