## Congress revisits GI Bill Few Stanford students qualify for educational benefits 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
In what is called the biggest expansion
of the GI Bill in a quarter century', the
Senate overwhelmingly passed a new GI
Bill Thursday that would expand the edu
cational benefits for soldiers who have
served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Attracting
broad bipartisan support, this legislation
will help cover tuition costs for anyone
who has served in the military for at least
three years since the attacks of September
11.2001.
But these benefits may find few recipi
ents on the Farm. Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper said that there are typ
ically one or two students at Stanford each

year who qualify for benefits under the GI
Bill.
"In general, support for veterans hasn't
been a big deal at Stanford because there
have never been more than a handful of
students who qualified for benefits at any
given time," Cooper said. "Our need
based undergraduate aid program means
that whether the student is funded by the
government, some other outside source or
by Stanford, we'll make sure that student
has enough funds to enroll at Stanford."
The original GI Bill was introduced in
1944 and has been credited with educating
millions of American troops returning
from World War 11. Having helped edu
cate the majority of the American middle
class in the aftermath of the war, including

eminent personalities like Bill Cosby,
Joseph Heller, Johnny Cash and Bob
Dole, the GI Bill is also recognized as hav
ing fueled much of the nation's post-war
boom.
Major Bryan Price, who served in
Afghanistan from 2005-06 and is currently
a graduate student in political science,
credits the GI Bill with strengthening the
U.S. economy and infrastructure.
"Where would our country be today if
almost half of the 16 million Americans
that fought in World War II did not take
advantage of the training and education
opportunities afforded by the GI Bill?"
Price said. "Ten years after World War 11,
the GI Bill succeeded in producing almost
half a million engineers, 238,000 teachers.

91.000 scientists, and 89.000 doctors and
dentists."
According to The New York Times, the
GI Bill in its current form provides veter
ans up to $1,101 a month for education.
Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), chief sponsor of
the bill and a former marine, has argued
that the current benefits were devised for
a peacetime military and need to be
increased to reward those who have
served in a new wartime era, where troops
face repeated deployments in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
With college tuition rising, Webb
argues that the current benefits are not
able to cover the costs of tuition,
forcing veterans pursuing degrees to
come up with the money to stay in
college. The revamped legislation
would increase the monthly benefit
to the maximum tuition at a public
university in each state. On average,
the tuition assistance would amount
to $1,700 a month. It would also pay
up to $ 1 .(XX) a year for fees and
books, would provide a housing
stipend and would apply to anyone
who has served at least three years.
Stephen Funk *08, who joined the
Marines as a reservist and served in
Afghanistan, said that though the
bill affords veterans numerous
opportunities, it needs reform.
"The GI Bill is the military
recruiter's most persuasive argu
ment, but only half of qualified
applicants actually receive benefits,"
Funk said. "Most of these people
don't receive adequate funding, and
only a quarter end up attending a

argument...."

four-year college. Most civilians
don't realize that people in the mili
tary who elect to receive the Bill
[aid] put money into it from their
salary, and many veterans are essen
tially being robbed of well-deserved
pay."
"Veterans experience many
readjustment difficulties," Funk
added. "They are just 1 percent of
the population and 1/3 of the home
less. PTSD and other issues veterans

face lead to a higher rate of suicide.
Increased education has shown to
decrease suicide rates, and, in this
way, a fully supported GI Bill would
help save lives."
Though he did not receive his GI
Bill funding after filing for conscien
tious objector status during the Iraq
War. Funk said that Stanford's
financial aid program has enabled
him to afford school with only mini
mal loans.
"When the original GI Bill was
introduced after World War 11, it
was fully implemented and basically
created our middle class â€” which
could definitely use reinforcement,"
Funk said. "If Stanford actively
engaged veterans and let them
know about the financial aid pro
gram that allowed me to able to
afford [school] without help from
the GI Bill, veteran applications,
and hopefully enrollments, would
dramatically increase."
The revised Bill has enjoyed suc
cess in both houses of Congress,
passing in the House earlier this
month with a veto-proof majority
and in the Senate yesterday with a
landslide vote of 75-22. However,

according to both the Washington
Independent and The New York
Times, some members of Congress
are concerned that the Bill's pro
posed expansion of educational
benefits will hinder long-term reten
tion within the military, as many
troops will be lured away by
enhanced educational opportuni
ties.
Price acknowledged that the GI
Bill is fundamental to military
recruitment and is often one of the
primary reasons why young
Americans enlist in the military.
"Rewarding their selfless service
with educational opportunities is
the least we can and should do,"
Price said. "It's a win-win situation
for our country. These men and
women bravely serve our nation,
and. in return, they get to attend
school armed with new skills, lead
ership training and a unique per
spective about the world that makes
them an asset in any classroom.
They make for better students and
better citizens."
