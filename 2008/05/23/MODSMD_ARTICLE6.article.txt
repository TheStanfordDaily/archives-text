## Congress revisits GI Bill Few Stanford students qualify for educational benefits 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
In what is called the biggest expansion
of the GI Bill in a quarter century', the
Senate overwhelmingly passed a new GI
Bill Thursday that would expand the edu
cational benefits for soldiers who have
served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Attracting
broad bipartisan support, this legislation
will help cover tuition costs for anyone
who has served in the military for at least
three years since the attacks of September
11.2001.
But these benefits may find few recipi
ents on the Farm. Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper said that there are typ
ically one or two students at Stanford each

year who qualify for benefits under the GI
Bill.
"In general, support for veterans hasn't
been a big deal at Stanford because there
have never been more than a handful of
students who qualified for benefits at any
given time," Cooper said. "Our need
based undergraduate aid program means
that whether the student is funded by the
government, some other outside source or
by Stanford, we'll make sure that student
has enough funds to enroll at Stanford."
The original GI Bill was introduced in
1944 and has been credited with educating
millions of American troops returning
from World War 11. Having helped edu
cate the majority of the American middle
class in the aftermath of the war, including

eminent personalities like Bill Cosby,
Joseph Heller, Johnny Cash and Bob
Dole, the GI Bill is also recognized as hav
ing fueled much of the nation's post-war
boom.
Major Bryan Price, who served in
Afghanistan from 2005-06 and is currently
a graduate student in political science,
credits the GI Bill with strengthening the
U.S. economy and infrastructure.
"Where would our country be today if
almost half of the 16 million Americans
that fought in World War II did not take
advantage of the training and education
opportunities afforded by the GI Bill?"
Price said. "Ten years after World War 11,
the GI Bill succeeded in producing almost
half a million engineers, 238,000 teachers.

91.000 scientists, and 89.000 doctors and
dentists."
According to The New York Times, the
GI Bill in its current form provides veter
ans up to $1,101 a month for education.
Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), chief sponsor of
the bill and a former marine, has argued
that the current benefits were devised for
a peacetime military and need to be
increased to reward those who have
served in a new wartime era, where troops
face repeated deployments in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
With college tuition rising, Webb
argues that the current benefits are not
