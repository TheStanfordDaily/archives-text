## Food costs rise for Stanford Dining 
### SCOTT SAYARE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Dining's food costs have
risen 4 to 5 percent this year, with pro
jections for a 7 to 8 percent increase for
the 2008-2009 academic year, according
to Eric Montell, acting executive direc
tor of Stanford Dining.
Hut Montell said that, despite sharp
increases in domestic and international
food prices, Stanford dining halls have
not altered their offerings to students.
"Stanford Dining has not changed
the menu, portions, offerings, selections,
high quality, name brands, service or
service hours for meal plan students,"
said Montell in an email to The Daily.
Stanford Dining meal plan prices will
rise by only .75 percent next year,
according to Montell. This year, a year
long meal plan offering 19 meals per
week cost $4,945.
Domestic and international food
prices have skyrocketed in recent
months. In the U.S., the exploding cost of
food has caused serious consumer con
cern and dented an already sagging
economy as food purchases impinge on
discretionary spending. Internationally,
food scarcity and sharply rising costs
have sparked violence and protests in
India, Kenya, Senegal, Italy. Mexico and
elsewhere.
Rising food costs have also signifi
cantly impacted dining halls at other uni
versities. Harvard University Dining
Services has begun to "juggle offerings,"
removing certain items from dining hall
menus in response to rising costs. The
Harvard Crimson recently reported.
Stanford Dining has, thus far. been
able to "protect students from price
volatility." Montell said. "While our costs
may increase, we look for efficiencies
within our purchasing and production
system to absorb the added costs."
Montell cited Dining's general use of
Contract Manufacturing Agreements
(CMAs) with producers and leveraging

of group purchasing programs as means
of stabilizing costs in an unstable food
market.
Last month, national domestic food
costs were 5.1 percent higher than they
were one year ago, according to Labor
Department statistics. Bread and milk
prices have risen 14.1 percent and 13.5
percent, respectively, since April 2007.

"The world has been
consuming more than it's
been producing the last
several years."

"Purchasing a meal plan is a student's
best protection from the impact of rising
food and fuel costs," said Montell.
The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations reports that international prices
of wheat and rice doubled between
March 2007 and March 2008, while
maize prices increased by more than
one-third. The sharpest increases came
in the first three months of this year.
The FAO's Food Price Index for 2007
rose 24 percent compared to 2006 levels.
In 2006, the Index rose only 9 percent
compared to 2005 levels.
In explaining the recent explosion of
food prices, researchers cite the growth
of the middle classes of large developing
nations, such as China and India, and the
increasing proportion of planted crops
devoted to biofuel production instead of
food. Experts agree that increased
demand, and not shrinking supply, has
been at the root of the tightening inter

national food supply and increasing food
prices.
"The world has been consuming
more than it's been producing the last
several years," said Walter Falcon, co
director of the Center for
Environmental Sciences and Policy at
Stanford (CESP) and senior fellow and
former director of the University's
Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI).
Record-high fuel costs are also impli
cated in the swell in food prices.
Yesterday, crude oil prices for the first
time surged to over $134 per barrel. In
2007, crude oil averaged just over $70
dollars per barrel.
Beyond raising transportation costs,
high oil prices have driven the cost of
fertilizer, a petroleum product, "incredi
bly high at the moment," said Falcon,
pushing food prices even higher.
Additionally, he explained, govern
ments across the globe have instituted
export bans on food products in an
effort to stabilize internal food prices.
These bans have driven up international
prices for many staple foods, such as rice,
as those foods become more scarce on
the international market. Falcon further
noted that households and individuals
across the globe have increased their
stockholding of food products, hoarding
extra supplies out of fear of scarcity and
rising prices, resulting in further supply
strain and price increases.
This past week. Montell met with
food suppliers to the University to dis
cuss cost containment strategies.
"Other schools ... have eliminated
trays, reduced choices, substituted chick
en thighs for chicken breasts, removed
menu items and reduced service hours to
offset the increase in prices," Montell
said. "We have continued to offer the
same high value, high quality menu choic
es for students each day and every meal."
