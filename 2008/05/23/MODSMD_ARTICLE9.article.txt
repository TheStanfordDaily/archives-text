### JULIANNE STERN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Paintings by some of the most distin
guished European and American artists of the
past 40() years will be traveling to Stanford as
part of the "Spared from the Storm" exhibi
tion, which will open June 4 at the Cantor
Arts Center. The exhibition will showcase
paintings and sculptures from the permanent
collection of the New Orleans Museum of Art
(NOMA) that were rescued in the aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina.
The exhibition will feature 80 paintings,
drawings and sculptures by some of the most
significant European and American artists,
including Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso,
Edgar Degas, Jackson Pollock, Georgia
O'Keeffe and Rene Magritte.
The traveling "Spared from the Storm"
exhibit was organized by the NOMA to ben
efit its Katrina Recovery Fund, according to a
statement released by Cantor in January.
Much of the NOMAs collection was left
unscathed by Hurricane Katrina, said
Bernard Barryte, curator of European art at
Cantor, who oversaw the organization and
installation of the exhibition. But part of the
building was damaged, and the sculpture gar
den was decimated. Barryte said.
He added that NOMA "suffered in ways
other than the physical." The museum lost
much of its visitorship in the aftermath of the
storm and is still struggling to
rebuild its visitor base.
The works that will be on display
represent some of the highlights of
the NOMA'S collection, said Lauren
Silver, associate curator for educa
tion at Cantor, who worked along
side Barryte to organize the exhibi
tion. Silver added that NOMA
houses one of the strongest collec
tions in the Deep South.
"Our collection of European
and American art from the 17th
century through the l l )th century is
fairly small." Silver said. "The show
helps put some of our collection in

the larger context of Western art
history."
Barryte said that he first came
across the traveling exhibition at a
Manhattan gallery owned by a New
Orleans native. After talking with
the gallery owner. Barryte said, he
realized that the exhibition could be
a great fit for the Cantor Center.
"| Barryte] had been looking for
a good Old Masters show." said
Silver. "He was excited to be able to
bring those kinds of objects |to
Cantor]."
On Thursday. June 5. there will
be a special opening of the exhibi
tion for students from 7:30-9 p.m.
featuring a jazz combo from the
Stanford Jazz Orchestra.
