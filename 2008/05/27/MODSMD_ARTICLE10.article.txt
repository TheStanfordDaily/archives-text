## Stanford in Beijing students spread excitement about entreprenuership 
### BY CHELSEA MA STAFF WRITER 
It seems like every engineer at
Stanford wants to start the next
Google, but students at China's top
universities would rather just join
one.
"At Stanford, people get a lot of
respect for doing their own thing, but
that's not really the case in China,"
Tracy Chou'o9 said. "We noticed that
a lot of companies are started by for
eigners, and local Chinese students
are not that interested in entrepre
neurship. They're just looking at big,
prestigious companies."
That's why Chou and Helen
Zhang '09, who are studying abroad
this quarter in Beijing — hoping to
start their own company there, but
deterred by a lack of support — or
ganized a conference to promote en
trepreneurship last Sunday at Ts
inghua University.
Students with backgrounds in en
gineering, economics or finance from
Tsinghua and Peking Universities —
China's top two schools — poured
in, occupying every seat in the 130-
person maximum capacity room.
"The conference exceeded both
of our expectations," Zhang said in
an email to The Daily. "We'd been
worried that not enough people
would show up because we didn't
know the best ways to advertise in
Chinese universities, but students
kept on coming, and we filled the en
tire room by the time the keynote
started."
Speakers at the event included
newly graduated student entrepre
neurs, as well as chief executives of
tech companies like social network
ing site Xiaonei (the Chinese version

of Facebook) and search engine
Kooxoo.They informed the audience
of areas rife with entrepreneurship
opportunities — e-commerce, IT ed
ucation and gaming, to name a few
— and provided tips on how to get
started, giving the audience concrete
incentives to pursue entrepreneur
ship.
The participants also attended
workshops where they could prac
tice "elevator pitches" — approxi
mately 30-second overviews of ideas
for products — to venture capital
ists.
"[The workshop] was especially
successful," Zhang said. "It was very
interactive, the students got into it
and one guy even said he came up
with an idea that he could potential
ly start a company off of."
Pleased attendees expressed as
tonishment at the quick organization
of the conference. And with the help
of Abe Caplan, a consultant based in
Beijing, Chou and Zhang certainly
struck quite a deal. Sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association and
the Stanford in Beijing program, the
successful event gathered high pro
file businessmen, cost only about
$1,000 and was crystallized simply a
month after the idea was formed.
"A lot of Stanford connections
helped us get this together," Chou
said. "I planned a business confer
ence at Stanford in April, and the
whole process took several months.
This conference came together in
one month — there's much less bu
reaucracy here."
Chou and Zhang were thrilled
with the effectiveness of the confer
ence, noting how participant enthusi
asm energized the workshop and
Q&A sessions. Already, they have

been asked to speak at organizations
such as the Venture Capital Associa
tion at Peking University to share
their experiences.
"We just want to introduce the
spirit of entrepreneurship to Chinese
college students, and hope that the
conference helps build communities
that can link them to local venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs," Chou
said.
And by bringing the excitement
of entrepreneurship from Stanford
to Beijing, they may do just that.
