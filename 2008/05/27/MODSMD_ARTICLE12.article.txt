## Stu's Views Notes on Washington 
### 
Next week, Stu's Views is going to close
the year with a big bang, but this week
I am going to talk about my work in
the field this quarter — experiencing D.C.
with the Stanford-in-Washington program
for the past three months. The place is exact
ly what 1 thought it would be and, simultane
ously, nothing like it.
1. Everyone knows Washington is parti
san. But the partisanship extends far deeper
than just a situation in which Democrats tend
to hire only Democrats, with maybe a few
symbolic Republicans, and vice versa. What
is truly amazing is how many people are
dependent on the President for jobs. The
bureaucracy has literally thousands of politi
cal appointees; if the wrong administration is
in power, thousands of people are out of
work.This partially explains why there are so
many think tanks around town — people
waiting until their party wins the White
House. When the Republicans lost control of
the House and Senate in 2006, literally hun
dreds of people were put out of work.
2. Partisanship is important, but it seems
that luck is the name of the game. I've met a
lot of impressively accomplished and suc
cessful people here in Washington, and most
of their stories include getting a key job
because they knew someone. We at Stanford
like to believe that the egalitarian competi
tion of the classroom will get us to where we
want to go, but connections really do matter.
Many Washington figures wouldn't be where
they are today without one person acting on
their behalves. In George Bush's case, it was
Katharine Harris.
3. Before coming to Washington. I had
never had a cup of coffee in my life. Ever.
Really. By the end of the first week. I was
carrying around a Starbucks cup like my life
depended on it. And so is everyone else.
Washington runs on coffee and ego.
4. It's easy to demonize members of
Congress as lazy and corrupt. But a great
many of them really do care about public
service. The vast majority of what they do —
holding hearings, working on bills — really
does get ignored when they go back to their
districts. Congressional campaigns tend to
spiral into demeaning people for being too

liberal or too conservative, picking out a few
key votes to make the case. That doesn't do
justice to what the job actually entails.
5. You may have thought pandas are cool.
But when you see a live, adorable panda at
the National Zoo going to town on a piece of
bamboo, you squeal, melt and then buy over
priced stuffed pandas.
6. Being a Political Science major, I am
used to discussing issues in a certain way But
it's done totally differently in Washington. I
went to a book talk a couple of weeks ago for
an edited academic book about transatlantic
relations, and one of the professors there
proclaimed himself a "card-carrying member
of the Social Constructivist School." Not
only did I not know what the "Social
Constructivist School" was, but it was bizarre
to hear that in Washington. Washington just
don't approach a problem the same way an
academic would — there is much less theory,
much more pressure to get things done.
Academic approaches are still very impor
tant, of course, but it's not the whole story.
7. Riding the Metro is always an experi
ence. The underground stations are infernal
ly hot. During rush hour, the subway cars are
packed with all sorts of people, with outfits
ranging from the usual shorts and t-shirts to
the mysterious "business casual" to snappy
three-piece pinstriped suits replete with
American flags. How people wear those suits
during the humidity in the summer is a mys
tery to all of us.
8. Several people at the State
Department, foreign embassies and else
where have told me that, in crisis situations,
they have used Wikipedia to look things up.
