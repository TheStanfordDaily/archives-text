## Diversity: the next step 
### 
Sometimes folks ask us why we spend so
much effort on diversity, even though
we're only at this University for four years
at a time. We fight for diversity year after year
because we know it affects us each personally
and deeply.
Why ALL students should care
Increased diversity benefits everyone,
whether you are a member of a minority group
or not. A university is a place for academic and
personal growth. For your education to be the
most well-rounded, you must constantly chal
lenge your notions about different groups. This
is true no matter your background or your
position at this University. Inasmuch as this
University has a vested interest in producing
bright, world-wise, and accepting people, it is
Stanford's responsibility to support diversity
efforts on this campus.
As it stands, Stanford is performing miser
ably in graduate and faculty diversity. Since the
19905, the graduate population has boomed by
over 20 percent while the proportions of female
and underrepresented minorities have dropped
drastically. Faculty diversity is a major problem,
as well. Some departments have zero female fac
ulty members. The Office of the Vice Provost for
Graduate Education and the Faculty
Development & Diversity Office are working
hard on this problem, and we commend them
for this work, but we still have far to go.
What we can do
As students, we do not personally choose new
graduate students or new faculty, but we do
have the ability to create powerful change from
the ground up.
That partly means spreading awareness of
the problem. We must educate ourselves on the
state of diversity on this campus and find
events and people who can help us do so. Ask
yourself whether you fully understand what
diversity means and be open to learning how
diversity activists define the term. Oftentimes,
when we show people statistics associated with
our University, they are shocked.
We must capitalize on our large numbers in
this debate. That means attending diversity
themed events or being one of many who
wear a t-shirt on specific "diversity aware
ness" days. The little things make a big differ
ence. Signing a petition or supporting diversi
ty-related student groups might seem like a
weak way to get the University's attention,
but, if enough voices speak up, it does work.

We can take the retention of diverse faculty
members into our own hands by discussing
these issues with faculty â€” just ask what the
department is doing as part of the University's
diversity initiatives.
To sustain individual efforts, however, we
need strong student groups who fight for diver
sity at Stanford. Students Promoting Ethnic
and Cultural Kinship (SPEACk), for instance,
organizes events and activities to help bridge
some of the cultural gaps on this campus. One
of SPEACK's most recent events, "All 1 Really
Need to Know About Race I Learned in
Kindergarten," was very popular, with over a
hundred people in attendance.
You can help diversity-related student
groups by publicizing or coordinating events,
writing op-eds like this one to The Stanford
Daily, and even garnering attention on a
national level. If you're involved with student
publications, you have a particularly unique
opportunity to advocate for diversity at
Stanford.
A major problem in spreading awareness
about diversity is the decentralization of so
many of these efforts, particularly between
graduates and undergraduates. To address this
obstacle we are beginning to create a central
ized diversity organization where people can
turn to for diversity-related issues and events.
'Ibis organization will use a single list server,
Web site and calendar, and it will collect, in one
location, information on all the diversity-relat
ed events for the entire campus.
We can make such a group financially viable
through a few different methods. Related stu
dent groups can contribute funds and people
power to sustain the group. Organizers can tap
into the alumni network, the VPSA and the
VPUE to support such a centralized diversity
focused group.
Clearly, there are many ways students can
support campus-wide diversity. In this op-ed,
we intend to make clear that because we, as
students, are affected by Stanford's diversity
difficulties, we cannot sit idly by and wait for
someone else to take the lead in solving our
problems. If you take some of these recommen
dations seriously, you might see progress mate
rialize even quicker than you'd expect.
