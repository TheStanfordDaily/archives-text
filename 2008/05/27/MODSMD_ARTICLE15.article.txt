Mission accomplished.
Ihe Cardinal headed north to Seat
tle last weekend to take on Washington
for the final series of the regular season
Unking to get back on track and, hope -
fully.earn home-field advantage for the
NCAA Regional^
No. 1 b Stanford (33-21-2,14-10 Pac
-10) took the first two games to secure
the series, but Sunday didn't go as well
for the Cardinal. After jumping out to a
4-0 lead despite being held to just three
hits through six innings, the Huskies
(33-22,11-13) capitalized on a Stanford
error and ran away with a 7-4 victory.
Still. Sunday had a happy ending as the
announcement was made during the
eighth inning that Klein Field at
Sunken Diamond would be a host site
for the first round of the 64-team
NCAA tournament this weekend.
"We knew we needed to take two
out of three [to be selected as a host
site]." said junior Austin Yount. "The
difference was probably that we took
the first two, actually, because the selec
tion committee made their decision be
fore [the Sunday games finished]."
"Washington is a gixxl team," jun
ior second baseman Cord Phelps
added."We played some very good, re
laxed ball and had a pretty good week
end. We wanted to get back on track
going into next weekend, and this se
ries was a good step."
Friday: Stanford 9, Washington 4
Stanford didn't waste anv time in

the opener, as Phelps led off by launch
ing his 11th homer — his third leading
oft a game — to spot the Cardinal an
early 1 -0 lead. Three batters later, jun
ior Brent Milleville delivered a two-run
homer — his ninth — to make it 3-0.
Stanford.
Washington battled back in the
third, though. Trailing 4-0. Joey Dunn,
Andy Lentz and Kyle Conley all went
deep for the Huskies to even the game
at 4 apiece.
But those were all the runs the
Huskies could muster, as Stanford
starter Austin Yount turned in one of
the best performances of his career on
the hill. The right-hander pitched his
first complete game, allowing just four
runs on nine hits and one walk while
striking out 10 Huskies.The win moved
his record to 4-3 on the year.
"1 just tried to throw strikes." Yount
said. "It makes things easy when you
have great defense behind you.and our
defense was great. Getting some runs
on the board quickly was important
also."
Yount got some insurance from
junior Joey August, who picked up his
first home run of the year in the sixth in
ning to make it 9-4 Stanford. August
finished the day 3-for-5 and was a triple
shy of the cycle.
Saturday: Stanford 8, Washington 5
Washington starter Jason Erickson
kept the Cardinal lineup quiet almost
the whole afternoon but couldn't quite
reach the finish in the second game of
the series. He held Stanford to just two
runs on four hits through seven innings

Sunday: Stanford 4, Washington 7
Junior left-hander Jeremy Bleich
made his first start in eight weeks, leav
ing in the third inning after allowing no
runs and just three hits, but Stanford
couldn't quite get its offense going.
The Cardinal manufactured four
runs on just three hits — one of them

sophomore Toby Gerhart's fifth home
run of the year — to take a 4-0 lead into
the bottom of the sixth inning, when an
unfortunate error allowed the 1 luskies
to surge back into the game.
With sophomore Jeffery Inman
pitching in relief for Bleich and a run
ner on first with two outs. Washington
first baseman Troy Scott lilted a high
pop-up into foul territory. Phelps got
there on a King run. but the ball glanced
off his glove for an error. Scott drove
one over the left field wall just a few
moments later to start a rally that
would see Washington push across four
more runs in the inning and take a 6-4
lead.
The 1 luskies got one more in the
seventh to make it 7-4. Junior Blake
1 lancock took the loss to fall to 1-3.
By taking two of three on the week
end. Stanford finished the 2(X)8 regular
season second in the Pac-10 at 14-10.
behind only Arizona State's mark of
16-8 in the conference. The Cardinal

has not been to the postseason since
2006 and has not hosted a Regional
since 2004.
"['lliis group of Stanford players]
hasn't been able to play a playoff game
at home, so we are really excited for
that," said Phelps. "We are lucky to
have great talent in all four classes, and
we have some guys who have been [to
the postseason] before. I always look to
the upperclassmen to be the anchors."
"Leadership is always a key factor
for any successful team." agreed Yount.
"We have some great, experienced
leaders and look forward to competing
in the postseason."
Stanford is the No. 1 seed in the dou
ble-elimination Regional and will be
matched with No. 2 Pepperdine. No. 3
Arkansas and No. 4 UC-Davis this
