# Clayton's solo run stalled
## Freshman falls against nation's best, Dewarman 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Freshman Alex Clayton made a deep run into the
NCAA Tennis Singles Championships this past week, only
to he stopped by the best player in the nation in the semifi
nals.
Clayton's run began with a victory over Radford's No.
103 Martin Saver in the first round. He would need three
sets to oust Sayer.and eventually did in a 4-6,6-4,6-4 victo
ry'. Sayer played a great match, but the eighth-seeded Clay
ton was too much for him in the closing games.
"Every tournament, you have one of those matches that
can be difficult," head coach John Whitlinger said of Clay
ton's first round victory.
In the second round of play Thursday, Clayton met No.
23 Harel Srugo of UCLA. Srugo had beaten Clayton earli
er in the year in three sets,so Clayton was excited to get an
other chance at him.
Clayton would get the better of Srugo the second time
around, winning 6-3,7-6 (7), to advance to the Round of 16.
On Friday, the Stanford freshman went on to beat Ohio
State's No. 13 Bryan Koniecko, 6-2,7-6 (5), to advance to
the quarterfinals. In both matches. Clayton started hot but
allowed his opponent to creep back into it; but he would
have just enough stuff to seal the victories.
On Saturday, Clayton faced No. 37 Bassam Beidas in the
quarterfinals. Beidas pulled off one of the biggest upsets of
the tournament as he easily downed fourth-seeded Travis
Helgeson of Georgia in the Round of 16. Clayton had al
ready beat Beidas back in the fall in a fairly easy match, 6-
2,6-4, but Beidas was playing well and coming off a great
victory.
But,once again,Clayton had the right stuff: he beat Bei
das by the exact same score as before. I le started hot once
more and never looked back, taking the match 6-2,6-4 to
set up a semifinal match with the No. I seed, Somdev Dev
varman of Virginia.
Dewarman had been the No. 1 ranked player in the na
tion the entire year and previously defeated Clayton earli
er this year at the ITA National Indoor Championships. 6-
4.6-4.
The match was tight all throughout, with the players
trading points and consistently holding serve. Clayton got
an early break in the first set and was serving up 3-1 and 40-
15. But Dewarman clawed his way back. Combined with
some Clayton errors, Dewarman broke back and evened
the match before eventually breaking Clayton later in the
set. He then kept holding serve to take the first set. 6-4.
"That was a big turn in the match," Whitlinger said.
"[Clayton] played a little bit loose. [Dewarman} doesn't
miss a lot of balls and covers the court well."
Ilie second set was the same as the first, though Clayton
stepped up and did not lose his serve.The set came down to
a tiebreak at 6-6.and the tiebreak was tied 3-3 until Dewar
man broke though, winning four straight points on a couple
of wide shots by Clayton to clinch the set and the match.
"Alex is a great player," Dewarman said in a post-match

interview. "He is only a freshman, and he has a long way to
go.To be honest, he had a lot of chances in that match, and
he came out really well. 1 have to give him a lot of credit for
[it| being a great match."
"I really wanted the opportunity to play Somdev again
but could not quite win." Clayton said. "I had a lot of
chances and the match could have easily gone my way. I did
play well and he did serve [well] on many chances that 1
had. I have to give him credit for the way he played."
Whitlinger admitted that, with a freshman like Clayton,
one never knows how the tournament will go,even though
Clayton was seeded No. 8. After losing the first set of the
tournament, he did not lose another until the semifinal
match, when he ran into the two-time champion â€” Dev
varman was the 2007 champion and went on to win this
year's title, as well. Although Clayton ultimately fell short.
Whitlinger praised him for his performance.
"Alex did an awesome job, kept his composure and was
very focused," Whitlinger said.
Clayton finishes his freshman season as Stanford's only
All-American and with an impressive 30-9 record.
"[lt was] a great year for Alex," Whitlinger said. "He
played great tennis and was consistent all season long."
