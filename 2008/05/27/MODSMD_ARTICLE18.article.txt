## NBA Draft ahead for Lopez duo 
### 
Nearly two months ago. Brook
and Robin Lopez announced
to the basketball world their in
tentions to enter the NBA Draft. It was
a decision that surely took into account
many factors, one of the most impor
tant being the twins' draft stock.
Brook has been a projected top-five
pick for most of the year, while his
brother has gone from an expected sec
ond-round selection to a mid-to-late
first-round choice. But despite these es
timates, it was hard to pinpoint specific
places in the Draft where the twins
could be picked because the order had
yet to be set. Now, with the NBA Lot
tery over, we are better able to answer
the question: where will Brook and
Robin be chosen in next month's NBA
Draft?
Kansas State's Michael Beasley
and Memphis's Derrick Rose are the
consensus top-two players available.
Barring something unforeseen, they
will be first and second off the board to
Chicago and Miami in some order. A
number of athletes are vying to be cho
sen directly after them.The most high
ly rated players included in this crop
are Brook Lopez, Arizona's Jerryd
Bayless and USC's OJ Mayo. But the
ping pong balls seem to have fallen in
Brook's favor. Lopez has a very good
chance of being chosen third overall by
Minnesota.
If there was one team at the top of
the draft that desperately needed a big
man. it would be the Timberwolves.
They already have the immensely tal
ented A 1 Jefferson at center, but were
forced to start Ryan Gomes, a good
player better suited for a reserve role, at
power forward. In the past few drafts,
Minnesota has invested top picks in
guards and swingmen, which makes
those positions less of a priority, so they
should be able to focus on grabbing a
power forward.
After Beasley, Brook is almost uni
versally regarded as the next best big
man in the Draft, so it's natural that he
could slot in here, but nothing is certain.
The potential draftees have yet to par
ticipate in workouts for NBA teams,
and their performances during these
exercises will greatly affect their Draft
stock. Perhaps more than any other
professional sports league, the NBA is
infatuated with athleticism. The Lopez
twins aren't the most athletic players in
the Draft, and this may allow others to
leap ahead of them.
Italy's Danilo Gallinari Ls the for
ward expected to give Brook the great
est run for his money. Gallinari is ranked
highly as is, and workouts will provide
one of the first opportunities for teams
to scrutinize his abilities thoroughly in
person before the Draft. If he is impres
sive enough, he could land at No. 3.
If Gallinari or any other player sup
plants Brook, the Stanford star may be
in for a bit of fall. Bayless fits in much
better with Seattle at No. 4. Brook
makes sense for Memphis at No. 5, but
so does Mayo. Lopez doesn't fit the run
n' gun system employed by Knicks
coach Mike D'Antoni, who picks sixth,
so he could wind up with the Los Ange
les Clippers at No. 7, which should be
the lowest he could fall. But this is a
doomsday scenario. Right now, he is
the man to beat at No. 3.
Robin's position is much harder to
predict, since this Draft is particularly
deep throughout the mid-late first
round. Depending on his (and others')
workouts. Robin could sneak into the
lottery at No. 14 with Golden State,
which is likely the earliest he could be
selected. More realistically. Robin will
be chosen somewhere between picks
No. 17 and No. 24.
Toronto picks at No. 17, and the
Raptors could use an energetic, defen
sive-minded big man to pair with Chris
Bosh. Washington has a committee of
big men but hasn't been able to find
consistency at the center position for
years. While they have high hopes for
Andray Blatche, he is better suited to
play power forward. Robin is a more
natural center and would be a nice
choice at No. 18.
New Jersey picks at No. 21 and is
also in the market for a big man. Nenad
Krstic has been the future low post fu
ture for the Nets for some time, but his
development has slowed.
After that, both Utah at No. 23 and
Seattle at No. 24 could be destinations
for Robin â€” he s not likely to drop fur
ther than that because there are more
teams that need centers than there are
centers available.
Either way, both Brook and Robin
will be coveted as the latest parts of a
team's grander plans.
