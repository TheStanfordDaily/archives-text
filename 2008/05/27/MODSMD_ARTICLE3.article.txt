# Iranians at Stanford face hurdles
## Students confront Visa delays, visits from FBI 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
The following is the first of two reports on Iranian students
and scientists at Stanford. Part two will run in Wednesday's
issue of The Daily.
Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's high
ly competitive physics doctoral program was only the first
step in an arduous journey from Iran to California. After a
multitude of embassy visits, visa interviews and background
checks, the Iranian citizen arrived at Stanford in 2006 —
almost a year after he was originally set to begin his graduate
studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound
Iranian student has been delayed by ramped-up security
measures put in place following the attacks on September 11,
2001, and President Bush's declaration that Iran is a member
of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa
delays have hindered the academic pursuits of Iranian stu
dents at the University Students have also reported visits

from the FBI in which agents supposedly verified immigra
tion statuses. According to Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani,
these circumstances have created a climate of fear and intim
idation among Stanford's Iranian population.
The Visa Process and Its Effects
Security-threat safeguards consisting of name-based and
biometric checks are the same for prospective students and
scholars as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7,
2008 Congressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the
interagency database of qualified travelers, suspected terror
ists, international criminals and immigration violators, and
then screened through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition
database of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each
applicant's name and biodata are checked against a name
based database of over 32 million interagency entries, accord
ing to Edson. For certain travelers, including "students and
scholars with expertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation
concern." an interagency analysis of their application data —
known as a Visas Mantis clearance — is required.
This process can be particularly long for students from
Iran, one reason being the lack of a U.S. embassy in their
home country since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Students
and scholars wishing to travel to the U.S. must first travel to a
neighboring country to begin the visa application process.
"You have to go twice for an interview, and, if you're

lucky, you go a second time to pick the visa up." said Amin
Firoozshahian. an Iranian doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering. "Every time, it's just expensive. Every time, you
go through this burden of going to consulates, going to a third
country, reservations of flights, hotels, visas. It's a project. It's
a full-time project."
Firoozshahian, whose first visa application was rejected in
2001 in Turkey, later traveled to Dubai to reapply. Noorbala's
first attempt in 2(X)5 was also denied, allegedly because he did
not show enough intent to return to his home country follow
ing his stated length of stay — known as non-immigrant
intent,
"They told me,' You don't have enough social ties to your
home country,' or something like that," Noorbala said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International
Center, said Stanford steps in to assist when a University
bound student is denied a visa request.
"In these cases, we have been able to request a considera
tion," Pearson said in an email to The Daily. "The denial is
usually based on insufficient evidence that the student
intends to return to their home country after they have fin
ished their studies. Bechtel works with departments and con
sulates to ask for reconsiderations of the visa denial."
But students who have undergone the process say
Stanford can only do so much to help.
"The University helps you, provides you with paperwork,"
Firoozshahian said. "Mavbe sometimes thev send faxes to the
consulate or provide you with letters
to the consulate. But this is all the
University can do. In the end. it is the
sole discretion of the consulate offi
cer to decide if you're going or you're
not going."
Iranian students also emphasized
the hardships that visa rejections and
delays impose on families. Because
the vast majority of Iranian students
are only granted single-entry visas,
many do not go home for fear that
reapplying for a U.S. visa will result in
delay or denial.
"I've had friends who haven't
seen their families for six to seven
years because they couldn't afford
the travel or the delays,"
Firoozshahian said. "My parents
were trying to come to my [June]
graduation, and they got turned
down. [The consulate] said that only
one of them could come. It was kind
of tough — how could I make that
decision?"
Under "Watchful Eyes"
Abbas Milani — director of
Stanford's Iranian Studies Program,
fellow at the Hoover Institution and
Iranian exile since 1986 — said he
believes Iranian students are not
only scrutinized more when applying
for visas, but are also "watched
more" once in the U.S.
"I think they are under consider
ably more watchful eyes," said
Milani, who spent a year in an
Iranian prison in 1977 for his Marxist

teachings. "The FBI keeps a much
closer tab on them."
One Iranian student, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity
because he feared drawing attention
from the government, said that while
the FBI usually contacts students by
phone first, one agent simply showed
up at his door.
"He just knocked at the door and
said, Tm from the FBI. Let's make
an appointment,'" the student told
The Daily. "Our conversation was
long — like one hour. He asked me
about my family in Iran and about
my research here."
This student said he was expect
ing the visit because many of his
friends had received similar ones.
Firoozshahian, who received an
FBI visit two to three years ago, said
the agents who visited him in his
department office claimed to be
helping the Immigration and
Naturalization Service by verifying
student visa statuses.
"According to what they said, a
couple of the attackers of 9/11 were
on student visas, and they wanted to
make sure that the students here
were maintaining their legal status,"
Firoozshahian said.
"They were very nice," he added. "It
wasn't anything bad."
The Daily left repeated messages
for the FBl's San Francisco division
inquiring about the agency's stated
purpose for visits to campus, but the
messages were not returned.
Milani said the pre-9/11 U.S. was
"the most lax country for those who
overstayed their visas," but he
believes current FBI visits represent
"over-vigilance" on the part of the
post-9/11 government.

"Hie pendulum has to swing back
to the middle where the immigration
office knows who is here on visa sta
tus and when their visa status has
lapsed," he said. "Making them feel
like these interviews are a form of
checking up on them or frightening
them is, 1 think, counter-productive.
It leaves a bad taste."
Milani underscored the importance
of relaxing visa processes, highlight
ing the negative consequences of
continued U.S. policy.
"I understand the security aspect
of it,"he said, "although sooner or
later, if American universities and
European universities are closed to
Iranian students wanting to study
physics or chemistry, they'll go to
India, they'll go to China, they'll go

to Russia or Japan."
Milani also called American-edu
cated Iranians "Trojan horses of
democracy" because they experience
democracy and return to Iran with its
values.
"The path [from America to lran|
allows them to become willy-nilly
agents of change," he said. "To close
that path is so short-sided that it's
hard to imagine any other cause than
sheer ignorance or malice. I tend to
think it's more ignorance than mal
ice."

European universities are closed to
Iranian students wanting to study
physics or chemistry, they'll go to
India, they'll go to China, they'll go

to Russia or Japan."
Milani also called American-edu
cated Iranians "Trojan horses of
democracy" because they experience
democracy and return to Iran with its
values.
"The path [from America to lran|
allows them to become willy-nilly
agents of change," he said. "To close
that path is so short-sided that it's
hard to imagine any other cause than
sheer ignorance or malice. I tend to
think it's more ignorance than mal
ice."

The following is the first of two reports on Iranian students
and scientists at Stanford. Part two will run in Wednesday's
issue of The Daily.
Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's high
ly competitive physics doctoral program was only the first
step in an arduous journey from Iran to California. After a
multitude of embassy visits, visa interviews and background
checks, the Iranian citizen arrived at Stanford in 2006 —
almost a year after he was originally set to begin his graduate
studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound
Iranian student has been delayed by ramped-up security
measures put in place following the attacks on September 11,
2001, and President Bush's declaration that Iran is a member
of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa
delays have hindered the academic pursuits of Iranian stu
dents at the University Students have also reported visits

from the FBI in which agents supposedly verified immigra
tion statuses. According to Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani,
these circumstances have created a climate of fear and intim
idation among Stanford's Iranian population.
The Visa Process and Its Effects
Security-threat safeguards consisting of name-based and
biometric checks are the same for prospective students and
scholars as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7,
2008 Congressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the
interagency database of qualified travelers, suspected terror
ists, international criminals and immigration violators, and
then screened through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition
database of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each
applicant's name and biodata are checked against a name
based database of over 32 million interagency entries, accord
ing to Edson. For certain travelers, including "students and
scholars with expertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation
concern." an interagency analysis of their application data —
known as a Visas Mantis clearance — is required.
This process can be particularly long for students from
Iran, one reason being the lack of a U.S. embassy in their
home country since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Students
and scholars wishing to travel to the U.S. must first travel to a
neighboring country to begin the visa application process.
"You have to go twice for an interview, and, if you're

lucky, you go a second time to pick the visa up." said Amin
Firoozshahian. an Iranian doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering. "Every time, it's just expensive. Every time, you
go through this burden of going to consulates, going to a third
country, reservations of flights, hotels, visas. It's a project. It's
a full-time project."
Firoozshahian, whose first visa application was rejected in
2001 in Turkey, later traveled to Dubai to reapply. Noorbala's
first attempt in 2(X)5 was also denied, allegedly because he did
not show enough intent to return to his home country follow
ing his stated length of stay — known as non-immigrant
intent,
"They told me,' You don't have enough social ties to your
home country,' or something like that," Noorbala said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International
Center, said Stanford steps in to assist when a University
bound student is denied a visa request.
"In these cases, we have been able to request a considera
tion," Pearson said in an email to The Daily. "The denial is
usually based on insufficient evidence that the student
intends to return to their home country after they have fin
ished their studies. Bechtel works with departments and con
sulates to ask for reconsiderations of the visa denial."
But students who have undergone the process say
Stanford can only do so much to help.
"The University helps you, provides you with paperwork,"
Firoozshahian said. "Mavbe sometimes thev send faxes to the
consulate or provide you with letters
to the consulate. But this is all the
University can do. In the end. it is the
sole discretion of the consulate offi
cer to decide if you're going or you're
not going."
Iranian students also emphasized
the hardships that visa rejections and
delays impose on families. Because
the vast majority of Iranian students
are only granted single-entry visas,
many do not go home for fear that
reapplying for a U.S. visa will result in
delay or denial.
"I've had friends who haven't
seen their families for six to seven
years because they couldn't afford
the travel or the delays,"
Firoozshahian said. "My parents
were trying to come to my [June]
graduation, and they got turned
down. [The consulate] said that only
one of them could come. It was kind
of tough — how could I make that
decision?"
Under "Watchful Eyes"
Abbas Milani — director of
Stanford's Iranian Studies Program,
fellow at the Hoover Institution and
Iranian exile since 1986 — said he
believes Iranian students are not
only scrutinized more when applying
for visas, but are also "watched
more" once in the U.S.
"I think they are under consider
ably more watchful eyes," said
Milani, who spent a year in an
Iranian prison in 1977 for his Marxist

teachings. "The FBI keeps a much
closer tab on them."
One Iranian student, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity
because he feared drawing attention
from the government, said that while
the FBI usually contacts students by
phone first, one agent simply showed
up at his door.
"He just knocked at the door and
said, Tm from the FBI. Let's make
an appointment,'" the student told
The Daily. "Our conversation was
long — like one hour. He asked me
about my family in Iran and about
my research here."
This student said he was expect
ing the visit because many of his
friends had received similar ones.
Firoozshahian, who received an
FBI visit two to three years ago, said
the agents who visited him in his
department office claimed to be
helping the Immigration and
Naturalization Service by verifying
student visa statuses.
"According to what they said, a
couple of the attackers of 9/11 were
on student visas, and they wanted to
make sure that the students here
were maintaining their legal status,"
Firoozshahian said.
"They were very nice," he added. "It
wasn't anything bad."
The Daily left repeated messages
for the FBl's San Francisco division
inquiring about the agency's stated
purpose for visits to campus, but the
messages were not returned.
Milani said the pre-9/11 U.S. was
"the most lax country for those who
overstayed their visas," but he
believes current FBI visits represent
"over-vigilance" on the part of the
post-9/11 government.

"Hie pendulum has to swing back
to the middle where the immigration
office knows who is here on visa sta
tus and when their visa status has
lapsed," he said. "Making them feel
like these interviews are a form of
checking up on them or frightening
them is, 1 think, counter-productive.
It leaves a bad taste."
Milani underscored the importance
of relaxing visa processes, highlight
ing the negative consequences of
continued U.S. policy.
"I understand the security aspect
of it,"he said, "although sooner or
later, if American universities and
European universities are closed to
Iranian students wanting to study
physics or chemistry, they'll go to
India, they'll go to China, they'll go

to Russia or Japan."
Milani also called American-edu
cated Iranians "Trojan horses of
democracy" because they experience
democracy and return to Iran with its
values.
