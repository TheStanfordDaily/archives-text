# Iranians at Stanford face hurdles
## Students confront Visa delays, visits from FBI 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
The following is the first of two reports on Iranian students
and scientists at Stanford. Part two will run in Wednesday's
issue of The Daily.
Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's high
ly competitive physics doctoral program was only the first
step in an arduous journey from Iran to California. After a
multitude of embassy visits, visa interviews and background
checks, the Iranian citizen arrived at Stanford in 2006 —
almost a year after he was originally set to begin his graduate
studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound
Iranian student has been delayed by ramped-up security
measures put in place following the attacks on September 11,
2001, and President Bush's declaration that Iran is a member
of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa
delays have hindered the academic pursuits of Iranian stu
dents at the University Students have also reported visits

from the FBI in which agents supposedly verified immigra
tion statuses. According to Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani,
these circumstances have created a climate of fear and intim
idation among Stanford's Iranian population.
The Visa Process and Its Effects
Security-threat safeguards consisting of name-based and
biometric checks are the same for prospective students and
scholars as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7,
2008 Congressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the
interagency database of qualified travelers, suspected terror
ists, international criminals and immigration violators, and
then screened through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition
database of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each
applicant's name and biodata are checked against a name
based database of over 32 million interagency entries, accord
ing to Edson. For certain travelers, including "students and
scholars with expertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation
concern." an interagency analysis of their application data —
known as a Visas Mantis clearance — is required.
This process can be particularly long for students from
Iran, one reason being the lack of a U.S. embassy in their
home country since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Students
and scholars wishing to travel to the U.S. must first travel to a
neighboring country to begin the visa application process.
"You have to go twice for an interview, and, if you're

lucky, you go a second time to pick the visa up." said Amin
Firoozshahian. an Iranian doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering. "Every time, it's just expensive. Every time, you
go through this burden of going to consulates, going to a third
country, reservations of flights, hotels, visas. It's a project. It's
a full-time project."
Firoozshahian, whose first visa application was rejected in
2001 in Turkey, later traveled to Dubai to reapply. Noorbala's
first attempt in 2(X)5 was also denied, allegedly because he did
not show enough intent to return to his home country follow
ing his stated length of stay — known as non-immigrant
intent,
"They told me,' You don't have enough social ties to your
home country,' or something like that," Noorbala said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International
Center, said Stanford steps in to assist when a University
bound student is denied a visa request.
"In these cases, we have been able to request a considera
tion," Pearson said in an email to The Daily. "The denial is
usually based on insufficient evidence that the student
intends to return to their home country after they have fin
ished their studies. Bechtel works with departments and con
sulates to ask for reconsiderations of the visa denial."
But students who have undergone the process say
Stanford can only do so much to help.
"The University helps you, provides you with paperwork,"
Firoozshahian said. "Mavbe sometimes thev send faxes to the
