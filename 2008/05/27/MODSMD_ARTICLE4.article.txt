## Draw leaves record numbers unassigned Increased housing apps keep 122 students waiting 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Friday, May 23, students
learned their fate when Student
Housing sent out assignments via
email and posted Draw statistics for
the 2008-2009 school year — all but
122 students, that is.
An unprecedented 122 upperclass
men guaranteed housing were not

assigned housing this Draw cycle.
"The Undergraduate Housing
Draw saw an increase of 49 upper
classmen applicants this year, continu
ing the trend of higher application
numbers from last year," said
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney in a press
release. "This is the highest number of
undergraduate applications since
2002. There also was a higher yield in
freshmen admits than anticipated."
Among those unassigned were
Caroline Kusin '10 and her five draw
mates, who received the number 2860.
The cutoff for guaranteed housing for
women was 2813, and 2892 for men.
"We're laughing about it because
it's kind of ridiculous," Kusin said.
"Who doesn't get housing?"
Despite finding humor in their situ
ation. Kusin said she and her draw
mates were taken aback by an email
from Housing asking them to join the
waitlist.
"It was weird," said Kusin of the
additional steps required of her group,
"because it was completely their fault.
I can't believe 1 have to put more
effort in just because I got a bad num
ber."
In response to the additional hous
ing demand. Student Housing
announced a new option for those
undergraduates applying to the
autumn waitlist or seeking reassign
ment for autumn quarter. These stu
dents may live in Crothers during

autumn quarter and Xanadu for win
ter and spring quarters.
For those assigned, among the top
ehoices in the Draw for both men and
women were Jerry, 680 I.omit a, 808
and Mars. 'Ihe cut-off numbers for
these houses decreased significantly
from previous years. For example, the
cut-off Draw number for a group of
four females drawing into 680 Lomita
decreased from 230 in the 2007-2008
school year to 143 in the 2008-2009
school year.
The decreased cut-oft numbers for
Row houses this year caused some stu
dents with reasonably good Draw

numbers to miss living on the Row.
Andrew Chang '11. who drew in a
group of six males, received the draw
number 534 but was assigned to
Toyon, which had a cut-off of 1591 for
a draw group of 6 males with priority
last year.This year, 435 was the highest
number for a group of 6 males hoping
to be placed in any self-op.
"Toyon was our 14th choice,"
Chang said. "We really wanted to live
in Narnia or 717, but we also put Jerry,
808. Grove, Phi Sig and just about
every Row house on our preferences
before Toyon."
In addition to self-ops, co-ops on
the Row were also popular this year.
"Most [co-ops] filled out of both
priority and preferred status," said
Student Housing University Manager
Sue Nunan in a press release.
The newly implemented Gender
Neutral Housing pilot program in
Terra, Narnia, Castano and Mirrielees
did not significantly affect the popular
ity of these residences in the under
graduate Draw.
"Eighty-six students — about 2
percent of those assigned — who list
ed an interest in gender neutral hous
ing were assigned to one of the four
undergraduate gender neutral housing
locations," Whitney said. "Assignments
for gender neutral housing will take
place at the in-house Draws for these
residences."
