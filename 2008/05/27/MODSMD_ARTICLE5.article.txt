## Cardinal falls to Aggies in NCAA Super Regional 
### SCOTT BLAND DESK EDITOR 
The No. 12 Stanford softhall team
surged into the NCAA Super Regionals
with plenty of momentum after no-hitting
the University of Massachusetts the previ
ous weekend. But the Cardinal's momen
tum ran out in College Station. Texas, this
weekend as No. 5 Texas A&M knocked
Stanford out of the 2008 postseason,
sweeping the Stanford women behind 6-1
and 9-4 wins on Saturday and Sunday.
The Cardinal (49-15) never led at any
point in the Super Regionals. trailing 4-0
after the first inning on Saturday and then
facing a 7-0 deficit after four innings on
Sunday.
"Obviously, we're disappointed at the
end of the season but very proud of our
team and, in particular, our seniors." said
coach John Rittman following the
Cardinal's postseason exit."l thought they
did an extremely good job of continuing to
battle in a very tough situation."
The weekend was rough from the get
go for the Cardinal. The Bay Area heat

wave of several weeks ago was only scant
preparation for the temperatures in Texas.
Even still, the Stanford players barely had
time to break a sweat before the Aggies
(53-7) were all over them.
Sophomore leadoff hitter Alissa Haber
singled on a 2-2 pitch to open the game but
was then called out for leaving the bag too
early during the next at-bat. Texas A&M's
first hitter, first baseman Rhiannon
Kliesing, left nothing to chance by taking
her own 2-2 pitch over the left-field wall,
putting A&M up 1-0.

Ashley Chinn and the Cardinal saw their season come to a close in College Station, Tex.
over the weekend. The Aggies rode spectacular pitching to a 2-0 sweep of Stanford.
following the three-run shot. Penna
worked her way out of the inning,
but the damage was done.
Stanford could not climb out of
the hole against Aggies ace Megan
Gibson, who improved to 38-1 with
the two wins. Gibson allowed two
Stanford baserunners in the third in
ning, but she forced a key groundout
from junior shortstop Maddy Coon
to end the inning.
Ridley hit her second home run, a
two-run blast, in the sixth inning be
fore Stanford managed to put any
thing on the board. I laber scored on
an RBI groundout from sophomore
catcher Rosey Neill. The Cardinal
tried to rally again in the seventh, but
Gibson tallied another of her 10
strikeouts and forced a firjal ground
out to end the first game.
Gibson played things differently
on day two, striking out only one
Stanford batter and relying on su
perb defense to put the Cardinal
away. Despite putting their bats on a
number of pitches, Stanford could
not get the ball out of the infield for
long stretches of the game.
"That's a credit to Texas A&M's
defense," Rittman said. "We didn't
get a lot of breaks, but I think a lot of
that has to do with Texas A&M: first
their pitching and then their de
fense."
Meanwhile, the Aggies' hitters
kept putting the ball in the same
place as the day before: over the out
field fence.
After a scoreless first inning. Ag
gies shortstop Macie Morrow home
red to right-center field, scoring two.
Kliesing followed up with a solo shot
to start the third inning, marking the
end of the road for Penna.
"She's carried us all year long,
and 1 know she's hurting right now,"
Rittman said after the game."Hope
fully, she can learn from it and get
better next year."
Freshman reliever Ashley Chinn
could not stop the bleeding, as Texas
A&M went up 7-0 by the middle of
the fourth inning. Still, the Cardinal
kept on chopping away at the plate
and managed to come away with
some consolation from the game.
The Cardinal fought back with a
pair of home runs in the fourth and
sixth innings, with Coon hitting the
first and senior third baseman
Michelle Smith hittinu the second.

Smith's homer, which made it a 9-4
game,gave her 40 long balls to finish
her collegiate career, the second
highest mark in Stanford history.
"I'm very proud of our team after
being down. 7-0. to come back and
fight," Rittman said."'l"hat game had
run-rule written all over it, and that
just says a lot about our leadership in
our program and our seniors' never
sav-die attitude."

Ashley Chinn and the Cardinal saw their season come to a close in College Station, Tex.
over the weekend. The Aggies rode spectacular pitching to a 2-0 sweep of Stanford.
following the three-run shot. Penna
worked her way out of the inning,
but the damage was done.
Stanford could not climb out of
the hole against Aggies ace Megan
Gibson, who improved to 38-1 with
the two wins. Gibson allowed two
Stanford baserunners in the third in
ning, but she forced a key groundout
from junior shortstop Maddy Coon
to end the inning.
Ridley hit her second home run, a
two-run blast, in the sixth inning be
fore Stanford managed to put any
thing on the board. I laber scored on
an RBI groundout from sophomore
catcher Rosey Neill. The Cardinal
tried to rally again in the seventh, but
Gibson tallied another of her 10
strikeouts and forced a firjal ground
out to end the first game.
Gibson played things differently
on day two, striking out only one
Stanford batter and relying on su
perb defense to put the Cardinal
away. Despite putting their bats on a
number of pitches, Stanford could
not get the ball out of the infield for
long stretches of the game.
"That's a credit to Texas A&M's
defense," Rittman said. "We didn't
get a lot of breaks, but I think a lot of
that has to do with Texas A&M: first
their pitching and then their de
fense."
Meanwhile, the Aggies' hitters
kept putting the ball in the same
place as the day before: over the out
field fence.
After a scoreless first inning. Ag
gies shortstop Macie Morrow home
red to right-center field, scoring two.
Kliesing followed up with a solo shot
to start the third inning, marking the
end of the road for Penna.
"She's carried us all year long,
and 1 know she's hurting right now,"
Rittman said after the game."Hope
fully, she can learn from it and get
better next year."
Freshman reliever Ashley Chinn
could not stop the bleeding, as Texas
A&M went up 7-0 by the middle of
the fourth inning. Still, the Cardinal
kept on chopping away at the plate
and managed to come away with
some consolation from the game.
The Cardinal fought back with a
pair of home runs in the fourth and
sixth innings, with Coon hitting the
first and senior third baseman
Michelle Smith hittinu the second.

Smith's homer, which made it a 9-4
game,gave her 40 long balls to finish
her collegiate career, the second
highest mark in Stanford history.
"I'm very proud of our team after
being down. 7-0. to come back and
fight," Rittman said."'l"hat game had
run-rule written all over it, and that
just says a lot about our leadership in
our program and our seniors' never
sav-die attitude."

The No. 12 Stanford softhall team
surged into the NCAA Super Regionals
with plenty of momentum after no-hitting
the University of Massachusetts the previ
ous weekend. But the Cardinal's momen
tum ran out in College Station. Texas, this
weekend as No. 5 Texas A&M knocked
Stanford out of the 2008 postseason,
sweeping the Stanford women behind 6-1
and 9-4 wins on Saturday and Sunday.
The Cardinal (49-15) never led at any
point in the Super Regionals. trailing 4-0
after the first inning on Saturday and then
facing a 7-0 deficit after four innings on
Sunday.
"Obviously, we're disappointed at the
end of the season but very proud of our
team and, in particular, our seniors." said
coach John Rittman following the
Cardinal's postseason exit."l thought they
did an extremely good job of continuing to
battle in a very tough situation."

go for the Cardinal. The Bay Area heat

Sophomore leadoff hitter Alissa Haber
singled on a 2-2 pitch to open the game but
was then called out for leaving the bag too
