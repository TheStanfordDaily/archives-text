# FACULTY & STAFF
## Faculty weigh pros and cons of e-books 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven years after its inception, Google Books remains a
subject of debate among faculty, with some championing its
practical benefits and others worrying that the age of the
physical bonk has come to an end.
The project was conceived in 2(X)1 by University Librarian
Michael Keller, Director of Communications and
Development for the Stanford 1 libraries Andrew I lerkovic and
Google co-founder Larry Page '98. Participating institutions —
including Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, the University of
Michigan and the New York Public Library — now send books
to Google in order to be digitized and made available online.
"There are many reasons we participated in this project."
Herkovic said. "Not least is desire to get a hold of a fully dig
itized collection, which would prove valuable for text mining
and other analytical tools and services. We very much want to
digitize everything as much as possible."
I lerkovic also pointed out that Stanford, despite being
"maxed out" on library space,currently buys HX).(XX) or more
new books each year.
"So we will have [to] remove 1(X),(XX) books from campus
to accommodate for the new books," he said. "A lot of us want

to believe that making
books digitally search-1
able through the Google'
Books project will some
how mitigate the need to
move books off campus."

Some faculty members, 1
however, worry that the'
digitization of books may
lead to even more texts
being removed from cam

pus. History Prof. Philippe
Buc argued that reading and,
assimilating the content in hooks

on a computer screen is significantly differ
ent from having the book physically pres
ent. He cited the difficulty of annotating

texts on the screen, which he felt was key to reflection on con
tents and preparation for discussion.
"lor research, nothing replaces the physical experience of
browsing source collections," he said. "One cannot browse
online unless one has learned to ask the right questions
through experience with physical sources collections. I can
have 20 books open on my floor; I cannot have 20 computer
screens open simultaneously."
But Biochemistry Prof. Doug Brutlag, who previously
chaired the various Faculty Senate committees on academic
computing and information systems, saw the advantages of
well-indexed digital books for researchers.
"Google Scholar permits one to do an associative search,
finding other texts that are similar to the one 1 assign, permit
ting students to go into more detail and do research in an area
more thoroughly," he said.
He added that digital version of books can be carried
around on a laptop computer or electronic reader such as the
Amazon Kindle, so a scholar can essentially carry an entire
research library in a small space.
"I can opportunistically send a recent article or chapter of

a book and share the ideas with the
whole class, even if the article or book
appears in the middle of quarter,"
Brutlag said. "It also reduces the aver
age cost of my course reader from $50
to zero for the student."
Buc admitted that digitization
could have some benefits, but stood

by his support for hard copies of texts.
"Digitization should be a servant of
traditional scholarship, not a goal in
itself," he said. "We can be intelligent
about this, but we cannot be mindless
ly Utopian. One thing I would advo
cate is a new undergraduate and grad
uate library containing the best books
for teaching and paper research, on
the model of Yale's new Cross-
Campus library. We would just need to
duplicate Yale's shelf-list and add in
the areas we teach in that Yale does
not teach in."

Brutlag too, felt that digital books
have some limitations. 1 le said that it
the language or alphabet of a text was
not readily digitized, only allowing for
images of the pages, he would be less
likely to use them because the benefits
of increased indexing capabilities
would not apply.
Buc also raised concerns about the
reliability of online systems, citing the
example of numerous and inconven
ient Course Work crashes.
"The new Course Work 5.0 has
been problematic," he said. "It

crashed on all of us during the first
two days of the fall quarter, it was not
up for IHUM classes the first day of
the winter quarter [and) it crashed
during a fall quarter final exam. I like
technology, but only when it is reli
able."
Brutlag contested this claim, argu
ing that past failures in Course Work
and other network outages were clear
ly due to the failure of the University
to invest enough money in the mission
critical systems.
"Storing digital books for hundreds

of years is expensive," he said. "It may
be even more expensive than storing
[physical] books. Software search and
network distribution also has a high
overhead, but that can be shared with
other uses."
Brutlag agreed with Herkovic that
libraries will become more useful as
library collections change from hard
copy to digital.
'in the past we had stacks; in [the]
future we will have servers," he said.
"In the past we had Dewey Decimal
and Library of Congress numbers; in

the future we will have associative
search. In the past we had to go the
library; in the future the library will
come to us, no matter where we are in
the world. We will have more books,
more readily available and easier to
search and distribute."
"[Digitization] doesn't put libraries
out of business," Herkovic added. "We
are more about services than simply
circulating hard copies of books."
