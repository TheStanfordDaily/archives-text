# FACULTY & STAFF
## Faculty weigh pros and cons of e-books 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven years after its inception, Google Books remains a
subject of debate among faculty, with some championing its
practical benefits and others worrying that the age of the
physical bonk has come to an end.
The project was conceived in 2(X)1 by University Librarian
Michael Keller, Director of Communications and
Development for the Stanford 1 libraries Andrew I lerkovic and
Google co-founder Larry Page '98. Participating institutions —
including Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, the University of
Michigan and the New York Public Library — now send books
to Google in order to be digitized and made available online.
"There are many reasons we participated in this project."
Herkovic said. "Not least is desire to get a hold of a fully dig
itized collection, which would prove valuable for text mining
and other analytical tools and services. We very much want to
digitize everything as much as possible."
I lerkovic also pointed out that Stanford, despite being
"maxed out" on library space,currently buys HX).(XX) or more
new books each year.
"So we will have [to] remove 1(X),(XX) books from campus
to accommodate for the new books," he said. "A lot of us want

to believe that making
books digitally search-1
able through the Google'
Books project will some
how mitigate the need to
move books off campus."

Some faculty members, 1
however, worry that the'
digitization of books may
lead to even more texts
being removed from cam

pus. History Prof. Philippe
Buc argued that reading and,
assimilating the content in hooks

on a computer screen is significantly differ
ent from having the book physically pres
ent. He cited the difficulty of annotating

texts on the screen, which he felt was key to reflection on con
tents and preparation for discussion.
"lor research, nothing replaces the physical experience of
browsing source collections," he said. "One cannot browse
online unless one has learned to ask the right questions
through experience with physical sources collections. I can
have 20 books open on my floor; I cannot have 20 computer
screens open simultaneously."
But Biochemistry Prof. Doug Brutlag, who previously
chaired the various Faculty Senate committees on academic
computing and information systems, saw the advantages of
well-indexed digital books for researchers.
"Google Scholar permits one to do an associative search,
finding other texts that are similar to the one 1 assign, permit
ting students to go into more detail and do research in an area
more thoroughly," he said.
He added that digital version of books can be carried
around on a laptop computer or electronic reader such as the
Amazon Kindle, so a scholar can essentially carry an entire
research library in a small space.
"I can opportunistically send a recent article or chapter of
