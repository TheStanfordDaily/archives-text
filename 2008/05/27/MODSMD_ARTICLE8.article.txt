## Baboons, beards and Sapolsky 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Biology Professor Robert Sapolsky teaches the
wildly popular class "Human Behavioral Biology,"
offered every other spring. The class is a Stanford
institution in the same league its Dr. Dements
"Sleep and Dreams," and fire evacuation codes
forced the Biology department to cap the class at
h(X) students this quarter. Prof Sapolsky is a recip
ient of the Mac Arthur Fellowship "genius grant"
and the author of several popular books, including
"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: An Updated
Guide to Stress. Stress- Related Diseases and Cop
ing" and the autobiographical "A Primate's Mem
oir."
The Stanford Daily sat down with Prot Sapol
sky to talk about baboons, the death penalty and
his trademark facial hair.
SI): 1 read in "A Primate's Memoir" that, as a kid,
you had decided to be a mountain gorilla when
you grew up. How did you switch career paths to
become a Stanford professor?
RS: [laughs] Well, some reality crept in at some

point... I will take [the question) on two levels: first,
how did 1 go from wanting to study mountain go
rillas to actually studying babwns? That was be
cause of the science I wanted to be doing, such as
darting animals, and taking blood — you are not
going to be doing physiology on mountain gorillas.
SD: Because they're endangered?
RS: They're endangered and they're big! ...Not
much is known about their physiology. And they're
up in rain forests, so it's too dark to see them. It's
just not practical...
The other part of your question is how 1 shifted
from just primatology to primatology and neuro
biology. I went to college to study very specifical
ly from this one primatologist — who actually
turned out to be a huge disappointment; anyway,
my freshman year he had a very mild heart at
tack. He's still around and he's fine, but that year,
he cancelled all his classes Those were three of
the classes 1 was going to take, so I had to sched
ule others. Somewhat randomly, I ended up tak
ing this introduction to neurobiology' class, and I
decided that it was much more interesting to
think about behavior in the context of the brain

than behavior in the context of ecology and evo
lution.
SI): Do you go to Africa anymore?
RS: I was there last summer, for the first time in
three years.
SI): What did you research while you were there?
RS: We're looking into if there are rank-related
and personality-related [differences] in the ba
boons concerning their neurochemistry of anxi
ety....Essentially, if you are a low-ranking baboon...
you've got a hell of a lot of things in your life to be
anxious about on a regular basis, so you gear up
your benzodiazepine system like crazy because
you're in for it. big-time [benzodiazepines are nat
ural neurochemicals that are similar to Valium].
SI): I low do you have time to do it all? You teach,
you do research,you write books — do you have a
family, too?
RS: Yeah. 1 have two kids...l don't sleep much.
SI): How old are your kids?
RS: Nine and 11. We just took them to Africa for
the first time, which was very anxiety-provoking

and very spectacular.
SI): What do they think of Africa?
RS: Well, they have very different temperaments.
My 11-year-old son is considerably more cautious
than my daughter, so he could recite a long list of
every single tropical parasite within a 500-mile ra
dius...But my daughter is this extreme free spirit.
SI): Did they get to see the baboons up close?
RS: Yeah, they helped with darting, and my daugh
ter did a small and very unsuccessful experiment to
see whether all baboons had fingerprints that were
different. That consisted of her taking out her
marker pens that we brought for her to do, like,col
oring books, and taking the marker to the baboon's
finger and pressing and smudging it, and then the
next day taking a different baboon and smudging
that one's fingerprint...They were two different
smudges so, based on that, she announced that no
two baboons on Earth had the same fingerprint.
That was her contribution to primatology.
Sl):That's a good start.
RS: Urn...yeah. One more fingerprint and she
could publish!
SI): A friend of mine who's taking your class right
