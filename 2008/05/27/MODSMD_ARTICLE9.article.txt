# At your service: Gardner Fellows
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Every year, the John Gardner Fellowship Program selects six
seniors from the graduating classes of Cal and Stanford to receive
the opportunity of a lifetime: a $27,500 stipend and a 10-month
placement in a government or non-profit agency. Stanford's
three Gardner Fellows for 2008-2009 are seniors Olga Medina,
Elizabeth Kersten and Debbie Warshawsky.
(>lga Medina
Medina, who hails from Pasadena, Texas, will be graduating
this spring with a double major in Political Science and Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
"1 wanted to enter a network of public servants that would
support my passion for the advancement of social justice," said
Medina.
The child of undocumented immigrants, Medina said she wit
nessed the struggles of those in her community as she grew up. At
Stanford, Medina has served as an executive board member of
the Latino pre-law society. Derechos. In her senior honors thesis,
Medina researched The Immigration Reform and Control Act of
19H6, which gave her parents and many other undocumented in
dividuals in the U.S. legalized status.
Spending the fall quarter of her junior year at the Stanford in
Washington program, Medina interned at the Mexican Embassy,
which gave her more insight into how NAFTA policies have
spurred immigration from rural communities in Mexico to the
U.S.
"I became aware of how the immigration problem is more sys
temic than we may think." Medina said.
"With my John Gardner Fellowship placement. I hope to work
with an immigrants' rights advocacy group,"she added."! think it
is important to change the discourse of immigration policy away
from a politics that negatively stigmatizes immigrants."
Elizabeth Kersten
Kersten. of Wyoming. Ohio, will graduate this spring with a de
gree in Human Biology with an emphasis on global health. Ker
sten is unlike the other two rising Gardner Fellows in that she did
not begin her undergraduate career at Stanford. A sophomore
transfer from the University of Virginia, she immediately became
involved in various advocacy activities, including FACE AIDS,
when she set foot on the Farm.
"I remember seeing the first recruiting flyers, applying for a

position and walking out of the interview being so excited," re
called Kersten. "I transferred to Stanford so that 1 could get in
volved in amazing organizations like FACE AIDS."
She also spoke of her own core beliefs regarding global health.
"I'm interested in our obligation as privileged people to en
sure that an individual's access to health is not determined by his
or her location on a map," said Kersten.
She referenced her own experiences working in Zambia as a
project facilitator for the FORGE organization, a U.S. based non
profit that specializes in providing aid to displaced communities in
Africa. After a quarter at Oxford and a summer in Zambia, Ker
sten applied to become a Director for thinkßlG — a conference
on international women's health and human rights that took place
earlier this year. Kersten hopes to spend her fellowship at an or
ganization that works toward sustainable global health solutions.
After that, she is considering going back to school to study global
health equity.
I )ehbie Warshawsky
Warshawsky, a native of Cincinnati. Ohio, will graduate with a
degree in Urban Studies. She is also a recipient of the Truman
Scholarship.

"I want to dedicate my life to fighting against
racial, economic and political injustices," War
shawsky said. "Specifically, I am really passionate
about working in low-income communities to allevi
ate urban poverty and inequality."
As an underclassman, Warshawsky founded the
student group Students Taking on Poverty (STOP)
to address what she felt was a need for increased ad
vocacy and student engagement. Warshawsky
worked with Upward Bound and Habla El Dia, as
well as working as a tour guide for two years on the
Farm.
In her time off campus, Warshawsky became in
volved in a variety of policy and advocacy initiatives.
Taking advantage of a Chappell-Lougee fellowship,
she spent her post-sophomore summer studying
community organizing in Harlem's public housing
— the topic of her current honor's thesis. This field
work has coincided with her two years of more tra
ditional academic work at the Center for the Study
of Poverty and Equality under Professor David
Grusky. Although she is currently undecided as to
where her Gardner placement will be. Warshawsky

optimistically assessed the status of her policy interests, noting the
"really effective work being done in low-income communities all
over the U.S. in all different sectors of society."
"There's a lot to learn — it's an exciting time," Warshawsky
said.
