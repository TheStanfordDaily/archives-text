## Senate discusses shuttle service 
### MAHNCY MEHROTRA STAFF WRITER 
At last night's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting, sena
tors discussed a potential amendment
to the current ASSU constitution by
laws in order to preserve the ASSU
Shuttle initiative. Because of a techni
cality, shuttle service funding is in limbo.
The ASSU Shuttle was not placed
on the Special Fees ballot during this
year's elections, so the only option for
funding currently is ASSU General
Fees. But. according to the ASSU
constitution, general fees are limited

to funding "capital expenditures" and
"infrastructure improvement," The
ASSU Shuttle does not fall under
either of these categories.
ASSU President Jonny Dorsey '09
and Vice President Fagan Harris '09
are proposing an amendment to the
current by-law regarding the alloca
tion of ASSU General Fees, including
new coverage for "transportation
services." This will ensure that the
ASSU can continue to provide stu
dents with the shuttle service by
securing funding from general fees.
"Right now,as it stands, the shuttle
has to die," Harris said. "In winter

quarter, over 500 students used the
shuttle to get to the airport. The shut
tle is one of the few initiatives that the
ASSU is known for. Jonny and 1 don't
think it is a good idea to let it die. So,
we are proposing this amendment to
the current constitutional by-laws."
Next week, the Senate will be vot
ing on the amendment. If the amend
ment is passed, the ASSU Shuttle
Service will receive its money to fund
this quarter's services at the end of
the year.
