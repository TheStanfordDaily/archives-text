## Editorial Board Senior class presidents worthy of praise 
### 
Often, the Editorial Board writes about
deficiencies and problems at Stanford
and so it is a welcome change to be
able to praise a group of students that have
done a great job over the entirety of the
school year. The senior class presidents and
cabinet members exhibited creativity in their
class leadership position, and although not all
of their ideas were new. they executed their
jobs with efficiency and purpose.
The first and foremost responsibility of
the senior class leadership is running Senior
Pub Night. A Stanford tradition of busing
seniors to various bars and clubs in the area
each Thursday night. Pub Night is a staple
that most rising seniors look forward to as a
new-found right. This year's leadership
showed refreshing consistency by having Se
nior Nights ever>' week (with the exception of
some weeks where there were other things
going on). The job of putting on a Senior
Night every week might not sound too com
plicated. but it is a very important job that
they completed better than many previous
classes.
In addition to holding Senior Nights every
week, this year's senior leadership provided a
lot of variety in the places that Senior Night
was held. Seniors got a flavor of all around
Palo Alto, not just the staples Blue Chalk and
Illusions. Also, there were drink specials early
in the night (sometimes throughout the
night) to encourage people to get toTresidder
early and prevent busing back-ups.This year.
Senior Night went to Blue Chalk. Illusions,
British Bankers Club, Thirsty Thursday's at
Palo Alto Bowl. Nola's, Old Pro, Be4twelve.
Rudy's and multiple pub crawls in San Fran
cisco, to just name a few. For the last Senior
Night, seniors were able to vote on where
they wanted to go.

In addition to maintaining and running a
superb Senior Night series, this year's senior
class leadership was on top of sending out re
minders and keeping seniors in the loop
about what was going on. Whether it was a
University deadline about applying to gradu
ate, ordering one's cap and gown or a re
minder about pub night and formal, seniors
could always expect to get an email as a re
minder. Also, the leadership publicized
events important to seniors such as the post
graduate service program fair and a panel
about business school.
There were a variety of other events this
year's senior class leadership put on showing
a dedication to satisfying many different in
terests. This year, the class put on two"Smor
gys" with music and food at the Lake Lag
BBQ pit. The leadership also hosted two for
mals, one in winter and one in spring, instead
of the traditional formal/semiformal arrange
ment. One of their bigger events was the
Tainted Love Charity Concert. It was the
biggest charity event put on by any class in re
cent memory. All proceeds went directly to
FORGE, a non-profit organization that
works with displaced communities in Africa.
In addition to charity work, the senior class
presidents and cabinet put on a "Life After
Stanford" series dealing with issues that hap
pen in the real world.'Hie first event focused
on personal finances and the second event fo
cused on online identity
Iliis year's senior class presidents and cab
inet displayed a unique blend of dedication
and creativity when organizing this year's
senior events. What resulted was a wide vari
ety of social, charitable, informational and
just plain fun activities. The senior class
should appreciate all their hard work in mak
ing their senior year a success.
