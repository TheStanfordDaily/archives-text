# Co-Terminal Illness
## Time for a real job 
### 
During Bay to Breakers two weekends
ago, I ducked into the woods some
where around mile four to take a leak
with the rest of the unwashed masses. Stand
ing behind a tree. 1 spotted a man with a Ugan
dan flag draped around his neck.
"Oli otya?" I called, asking in Luganda
how he was doing.
"Ndi bulungi, ssebo," he replied with a
smile, dispelling any doubts I had that he was
really from Uganda.
Like any Ugandan you'll ever meet.
Simon Kalumba proceeded to tell me his en
tire life story. He told me that he is a track
coach in the United States, but that he is also
trying to raise money to build rural schools
back in Uganda.
"It's not enough to come here and enjoy
yourself." he said, casting his hand across the
debauched revelry."and say you've made it."
His story, the story of the immigrant who
does not forget his roots, is by no means new.
But amidst a crush of half-naked, drunk ur
banites. the awareness of his success as an op
portunity to help the less fortunate is hearten
ing — and also depressing.
When I ask fellow '07ers what they are
doing with their lives, I invariably wince right
before they tell me, because more often than
not I can already guess that there's a good
chance they are employed as one of the Big
Three: investment banker, consultant or cor
porate lackey.
During Admit Weekend five years ago. I
asked the proverbial "what do you want to be
when you grow up" question about fifty times.
Not once do I recall anyone saying,"l want to
work in derivatives markets," or "I want to be
a highly-paid executive assistant at a Silicon
Valley mega-corporation." Yet today 1 have 15
friends working at Google and three in the
Peace Corps. How, exactly, did we get to this
point?
Some of you may invoke the wisdom of
"Caddyshack" villain Judge Smails, who fa
mously remarks, "The world needs ditch dig
gers too." You're right, the world needs fi
nance wizards and corporate lawyers too. But
these professions, and I'm sorry to burst your
bubble here friends, don't make the world a
better or more interesting place.
You don't need to have attended Stanford
— to have studied literature and traveled
abroad and done independent research — to
pursue these careers. They are. very simply, a
waste of our talents, and Stanford ought to as
pire to more than merely funneling bright
young minds into safe, high-paying, anti-intel
lectual jobs.
It's not as if my classmates feel some over
whelming desire to spend 70 hours a week sift
ing through market data either. When Jane
Smith 07 tells me she works at Bain, she
knows it's a cop out.
"I'm consulting," she'll say sheepishly,
twisting her mouth into a half smile that's sup
posed to express self-awareness that her job

choice* is predictable and not terribly noble.
Why then are the greatest minds of our
generation performing the intellectual equiv
alent of pumping gas? Part of the answer may
lie in the fact that Stanford students are a no
toriously insecure lot. We scratched and
clawed our way into this top-five school be
cause when you can wrap yourself in the Stan
ford name, the world declares you a success at
face value.
And yet, as disappointed as I am when I
hear that another brilliant peer of mine is tin
kering with Excel spreadsheets at Google, 1
still feel a pang of jealousy. They have been
identified as a superior talent and rewarded
handsomely for it, while I try to justify that my
soon-to-be $30,000 salary in journalism
means I'm actually "making a difference."
No, "making a difference" is not quite as
easy as it sounds. Working at a non-profit for
next to nothing is not inherently valuable to
society. My friend Jamie, a recent Bowdoin
grad. is slugging her way through a teaching
fellowship at an inner-city public school in
Philadelphia. I ler students alternately call her
"cream puff and "white bitch," and, by all ac
counts, she depends on a few stiff drinks after
school to keep sane.
And yet Jamie, in between trying to control
a rowdy classroom and downing shots of
Crown Royal, is learning a lot about life. So is
my friend Emmerich '07, who has been living
in Calcutta for nine months doing research on
microfinance. Darren '07 is also following his
dream, writing fiction and working for Mc-
Sweeney's.
It's not that Jamie, Emmerich and Darren
couldn't have gotten jobs at Mcßain. Instead,
they chose to have an adventure.They are liv
ing proof of the pioneer spirit that brought Le
land Stanford to California and let him be
lieve that he could create something new and
wonderful.
We attend this university because we are
smart, but we are able to be here in the first
place because of Iceland Stanford's remark
able vision. The morning after his son died.
Stanford said to his wife,"The children of Cal
ifornia shall be our children." We are the in
heritors of this extraordinary gift, and as we
depart with world-class educations, we ought
to enter the world with an aim to enrich socie
ty and not just ourselves.

Jane Smith, if you are reading this, it is nothing
personal. Send your complaints to dherbertte 1
