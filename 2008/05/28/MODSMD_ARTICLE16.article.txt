## War crimes and word crimes 
### 
This week I've decided to talk about two
recent prosecutions that illustrate the
often-weird legal attitudes behind
some of our laws.
War Crimes
I've never been able to understand the
reasoning behind prosecuting soldiers for
war crimes. Not only does it seem somewhat
unfair, but it also leads to various perverse in
centives for the soldiers themselves.
First of all, war crimes tribunals are vic
tor's justice. They are just kangaroo courts
that are set up when one side has utterly de
molished the other and wants to humiliate
their opponents for causing so much trouble.
No country ever prosecutes itself for war
crimes. Bombing Dresden or Tokyo during
World War 11 was just a necessary, though re
grettable, tactic that was necessary to achieve
victory. During the Nuremberg trials. Admi
ral Nimitz testified that the same tactics Ad
miral Doenitz employed and for which he
was sentenced to ten years in prison — unre
stricted submarine warfare — were also used
by American forces in the Pacific Theater as
well.
Secondly, war crimes tribunals are based

on illegitimate law. A sovereign nation can
not he bound by the laws of another nation.
Governments have the ability to break inter
national treaties at will. If you are a soldier of
a government that has chosen to disregard
what is called "international law," then what
option do you have? You can either go
against the dictates of your government and
be prosecuted by your own side immediately,
or you can follow your government's orders
and hope that you win and never have to face
the consequences.
Which leads us to the third problem with
war crimes tribunals. They encourage a sort
of never-surrender, fight-to-the-death atti
tude amongst combatants. There is no incen
tive to turn in your arms, give up and go home
if you know that you will be punished for
what you have done. TTiis is especially evi
dent in the current wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, where we have turned the mere
act of fighting against a foreign invader into a
crime. Right now in Guantanamo, a young
man is being brought before a military tribu
nal for killing two American soldiers with a
grenade while he was part of the Taliban.
