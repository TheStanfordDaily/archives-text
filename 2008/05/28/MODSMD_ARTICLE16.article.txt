## War crimes and word crimes 
### 
This week I've decided to talk about two
recent prosecutions that illustrate the
often-weird legal attitudes behind
some of our laws.
War Crimes
I've never been able to understand the
reasoning behind prosecuting soldiers for
war crimes. Not only does it seem somewhat
unfair, but it also leads to various perverse in
centives for the soldiers themselves.
First of all, war crimes tribunals are vic
tor's justice. They are just kangaroo courts
that are set up when one side has utterly de
molished the other and wants to humiliate
their opponents for causing so much trouble.
No country ever prosecutes itself for war
crimes. Bombing Dresden or Tokyo during
World War 11 was just a necessary, though re
grettable, tactic that was necessary to achieve
victory. During the Nuremberg trials. Admi
ral Nimitz testified that the same tactics Ad
miral Doenitz employed and for which he
was sentenced to ten years in prison — unre
stricted submarine warfare — were also used
by American forces in the Pacific Theater as
well.
Secondly, war crimes tribunals are based

on illegitimate law. A sovereign nation can
not he bound by the laws of another nation.
Governments have the ability to break inter
national treaties at will. If you are a soldier of
a government that has chosen to disregard
what is called "international law," then what
option do you have? You can either go
against the dictates of your government and
be prosecuted by your own side immediately,
or you can follow your government's orders
and hope that you win and never have to face
the consequences.
Which leads us to the third problem with
war crimes tribunals. They encourage a sort
of never-surrender, fight-to-the-death atti
tude amongst combatants. There is no incen
tive to turn in your arms, give up and go home
if you know that you will be punished for
what you have done. TTiis is especially evi
dent in the current wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, where we have turned the mere
act of fighting against a foreign invader into a
crime. Right now in Guantanamo, a young
man is being brought before a military tribu
nal for killing two American soldiers with a
grenade while he was part of the Taliban.


Killing Americans is not a crime,
not if it occurs during a war. No mat
ter how reprehensible I find the Tal
iban, it cannot change the fact that
we invaded a sovereign country and
it is not a crime for the citizens of
that nation to attempt to defend
themselves.
Myspace Mom
Lori Drew is the mother who
created a false account on Myspace,
set herself up as the online
boyfriend of one of her daughter's
enemies and then taunted the poor
girl into committing suicide. Prose
cutors are pursuing a case against
her, on the legal basis that she vio
lated Myspace's terms of use by
using a false identity.

There are two major problems
with this case. One is that violating a
civil contract, like the one a user has
with Myspace, is not against the law.
It is ridiculous to say that it's illegal
to use a false name on the internet.
It's not illegal to say mean things
to people. It's not illegal to say really
mean things to people. It's not illegal
for an adult to say mean things to a
child. It's not even illegal to say such
incredibly mean things that a person
commits suicide. Everyone has the
same recourse when people say
mean things to them. Stop listening.
It's unfortunate, but vulnerable
people get exploited every day.
When 1 was a kid. adults said mean
things to me all the time. And some
times I cried. But that doesn't
change the fact that there is no pos
sible way to stop people from saying
mean things to each other.
