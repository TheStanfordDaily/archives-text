## Who fights for the occupation? 
### 
Earlier this month. The Stanford
Daily covered a celebration, attend
ed by hundreds, held in White Plaza
for Israel's 60th birthday. The article also
covered a small group of protesters. Two
days before, the same protesters held their
own rally in White Plaza, with signs read
ing "Free Gaza" and "Israel is an
Apartheid State." It may seem like the
protestor's main concern is human-rights
issues and the liberation of the Palestinian
people. But, in truth, these students are ad

vocating for the destruction of Israel.
How 80? In 2001, at the UN Anti-
Racism Conference in Durban, South-
Africa, a bloc of nations attempted to de
clare Israel an "apartheid" state, thereby
placing it in the same category to which
South Africa once belonged. Such a move,
which would lead to isolation, economic
sanctions and a demand for "one man one
vote" that includes non-Israeli Arabs in
the occupied territories, could eventually
destroy Israel's sovereignty. The attempt

failed, as most democratic countries recog
nized that the word "apartheid" was, as
South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister,
Aziz Pahad stated, "hijacked and used by
some with an anti-Israeli agenda to turn it
into an anti-Semitic event." In preparation
for the UN Anti-Racism Conference next
year, much effort has still been put into
branding Israel, falsely, as an "apartheid
state." As long as there is an occupation,
however, these nations still have a
chance to pass their proposal.
The Middle East conflict is not
about Palestinian liberation. In
1947, the United Nations voted,
with the required two-thirds ma
jority, that there should be two
states in the land between the Jor
dan River and the Mediterranean
Sea, one Jewish and one Arab. But
the Arabs objected, and the next
day a war started, at which time the
state of Israel declared its inde
pendence, 60 years ago this week.
Still today, the lines of battle are
between those who want two
states, as the U.N. prescribed, and
those who have never accepted
that resolution and want one state.
And they don't want the one state
to be Jewish.
This conflict is not only be
tween Israelis and Palestinians —
it divides the Arab world, and the
Palestinian themselves. For more
than 15 years now. Israel consis
tently has chosen the two-state

strategy. It is the Palestinians who
are as of yet undecided. While the
Palestinian Fatah movement is
leading a two-state strategy, the
Hamas movement is pursuing one
state, and are thus fighting very
hard to maintain the occupation.
For a while, it seemed propo
nents of one-state were losing. In
2005, PM Sharon withdrew from
Gaza, and, in 2006, the new centrist
Kadima party, which gained quick
ly gained a majority following, said
it would withdraw from the West
Bank. But the month after the new
government was sworn in, rockets
started flying from Gaza and
Lebanon, and Israeli soldiers were
kidnapped. Then the Lebanon war
began. Under this reality, with
drawal was no longer possible.
The Palestinians who are shoot
ing these rockets at random civil
ian areas are fighting for the occu
pation, not against it. They are
fighting to draw the Israeli army
back into Gaza, to keep the one
state dream alive. Israel, on the
other hand, which can justifiably
reoccupy Gaza in order to stop
these rockets, has so far been re
luctant to do so, exactly for that
reason — Israel wants two states.

Instead, Israel uses blockades,
sanctions and air-strikes against
the attackers, which are indeed
more likely to hurt civilians, in
order to avoid an actual occupa
tion.
Sadly, there are organizations
on campus today that actively sup
port the one-state strategy, essen
tially advocating the end of Jewish
sovereignty in Israel. As an Israeli,
I find it disturbing that more than
a few students side with the organ
izations that wish and pursue the
destruction of my country rather
than its repair.
When you are shaking your
head at the situation in the Middle
East and contemplating who is to
blame, please remember that,
while Israel is responsible for its
part, the occupation continues
today only because of those who
fight so hard to maintain it. The
Palestinians of Hamas and those
who shout "apartheid" in White
Plaza are on the same side. They
believe that the continuous suffer
ing serves a higher purpose, the end
of Israel.
