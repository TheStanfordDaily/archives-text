All disciplines contribute to
Stanford intellectual life
To the Editor,
As a graduating senior and
someone who has taken
many classes from both the
humanities (literature, religious stud
ies, music) as well as engineering,
mathematics and social science de
partments, 1 am deeply appalled by
the online comments left in response
to the faculty salaries article ["Facul
ty salaries differ by speciality,
tenure," May 22]. If these comments
had been left by members of the gen
eral public, 1 wouldn't be surprised.
But if these comments indeed reflect
the sentiment of Stanford students as
a whole, it would simply confirm the
nagging suspicion I've had all four
years here: Stanford, for all its pos
turing about valuing and fostering in
tellectual commitment and curiosity,
is in fact no more than a pre-profes
sional factory filled to the brim with
students driven not by a love of the
mind but by selfish and greedy ambi

tion.This is a depressing fact, but one
that I have come to accept over time.
Stanford, despite its reputation, is
full of conformist students who find it
"uncool" to appear too enthusiastic
about anything intellectual whatso
ever (the classic "duck syndrome")
— who happen to have some high
SAT scores. Most prefer to keep their
intellectual interests well hidden or
never had any genuine ones in the
first place.
If students are going to attack a
whole intellectual discipline for being
useless or impractical, we might as
well return to prehistory. Much of
cutting-edge scientific research has
no application, and many scientists
are driven not by greed or even altru
ism but simply by a love of discovery,
which is the same spirit that drives re
searchers in the arts and humanities.
If you wish to dismiss the humanities
on these grounds of impracticality,
you may as well throw out most of the
sciences, SLAC, mathematics, philos
ophy, anthropology, etc. and make
Stanford into the elite pre-profes
sional factory that it's always wanted

to he. At least no more pretenses
about what one commenter called
the "unwarranted self-importance"
of faculty in the humanities.
ITie equation of merit with market
pay is the fundamental, unwritten as
sumption made by those who attack
the humanities. The belief that the
market should determine what hu
manity deems worthwhile reveals
nothing less than the grossest kind of
ignorance. Unfortunately, this hap
pens to be a belief shared by those
who posted comments as well as a sig
nificant portion of the student body.
For them, the market determines all
— what one should study, what one
should do and who one ought to be!
1 have found many aspects of my
Stanford experience to be the very
antithesis of a liberal education. 1 am
not surprised by anything 1 have read
in the comments section. Bland, un
creative and selfish are the three ad
jectives 1 would use to describe many
of my peers.
