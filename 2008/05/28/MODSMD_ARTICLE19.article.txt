## No looking back 
### 
Nostalgia is a dangerous
thing; dangerous because
it's so tempting.
It's easy to remember the good
things about a player, a team or even
an era. Look no further than the
media denouncing the sins of the
"steroid era" in baseball — where
the sanctified records of the past
were "tainted" by the bad, wicked,
evil athletes of the present.
The steroid era was, of course,
preceded by the era of ampheta
mines or "greenies," which, in turn,
was preceded by racial segregation.
There are some gaps in there, true,
but those are the highlights.The un
evenness of the competition doesn't
really change so much, only the
means of its inception. The idyllic
days of yesteryear before the evils
of Barry Bonds, "Slammin"'Sammy
Sosa, Mark McGwire and so many
others may not have been so idyllic
after all.
And if that's a shock to you. then
you might want to look into the "Fab
Five" scandal at Michigan before
wondering aloud just how USC
could apparently violate the deli
cate balance between student-ath
lete and pre-professional with re
gard to O.J. Mayo.
So that was a long introduction
to a fairly simple point — that it's
far too easy to believe that things
were simpler, or better, or more en
tertaining or more pure in the past
than they are now. Especially in
sports, and especially when you're
emotionally invested in the teams
involved.
With that in mind, let me offer a
preemptive word of caution to all
the Stanford die-hards out there,
and I think there must still be a few.
No matter what happens next year,
don't run wailing to the top of
Hoover Tower decrying the cold
cruel fates that have brought down
Cardinal athletics, despite the nos
talgia that is bound to arise in the
2008-2009 school year for times
past. Because, in retrospect, the fu
ture is still pretty okay.
The first and most obvious case
of an impending case of nostalgia
from the ranks of the Cardinal cra
zies is likely to dawn as football sea
son rolls back around. Why? Be
cause wins over USC and Cal can't
come every year. While Stanford is
doubtless on the right path under
second-year head coach Jim Har
baugh it is entirely possible, even
likely, that the road back to re
spectability for the Cardinal foot
ball program will pass over more
than a few bumps along the way.
And. in contrast to last year, now
those won't be expected as much.
In retrospect, last season may
have signaled a sea-change with re
gard to how Stanford football is per
ceived on campus and off. It's now a
sport where optimistic fans are actu
ally beginning to think, "Yeah, they
could be pretty decent soon." A lot
of that has to do with the newfound
swagger Harbaugh's arrival brought
to the program. Anyone could see it
in the win over USC or Cal and in
virtually any other game Stanford
played last year.'lTiey were playing a
fearless brand of football. It was as if
the entire team woke up one morn
ing and realized. 'Hey, they all ex
pect us to lose, so what's the worst
that could happen?"
Hie problem is that those low ex
pectations aren't there anymore.
Last year, every win was considered
an added bonus for a program that
clearly needed some work. But
now? For the '08 season to be con
sidered a success, the team will have
to make progress on last year's mark
of 4-8 and maybe even challenge for
a postseason bowl berth. Last year,
any victory was viewed as an over
achievement, but now that the foot
ball team has set the baseline for its
new era, an improvement will be ex
pected.
Men's basketball, on the other
hand, may suffer from nostalgia of
another kind. With the loss of the
Lopez twins and head coach Trent
Johnson, big changes are clearly in
the offing, and it seems very likely
that the Cardinal's record will suffer
for it.
As opposed to football, in this
case it's important to remember that
the dazzling heights from which the
basketball program may be falling

actually weren't so dazzling to
begin with. A pair of likely first
round big men in Brook and Robin
Lopez, a veteran-laden team, and
an experienced coach still only got
the Cardinal to the Sweet 16. That
was an excellent mark, to be sure,
but probably the worst Stanford
could have finished and not had its
season considered a disappoint
ment. On some level maybe the
Cardinal needed a shakeup, and
while it will take a while for fans to
see what the university has in new
head coach Johnny Dawkins, he
should at the very least bring
exactly that.
On the whole, at least for
Stanford's two most high profile
sports, 2008-2009 might be a rocky
season. But in taking an honest
look at where they've been recent
ly, it's nothing that shouldn't be
expected.
