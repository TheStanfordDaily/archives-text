## Albright assesses U.S. policies 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Described as "insightful, candid and
humorous" by Political Science Prof. Scott
Sagan, former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright took a packed Kresge Auditorium
on an imaginary "world tour" last night,
highlighting critical regions and offering
strategic advice for the next president.
In a back and forth with Sagan, Albright
largely followed the theme of her recent
book. "Memo to the President Elect" in

which she outlines important geopolitical
hot spots and policy dilemmas for the
incoming executive.
Considering the challenges facing the
future commander in chief. "I think it's a
wonder that anyone wants to run for presi
dent," Albright said.
The first female secretary of state cited a
"dangerous lack of effective leadership
across the globe" for today's precarious
international system.
Throughout the talk, which lasted nearly
an hour and a half. Albright ventured

between concrete proposals (the embargo
on Cuba "has outlived its usefulness") and
election commentary (Sen. John McCain's
proposed league of democracies "doesn't
make sense to me").
Much of Albright's policy followed her
"indispensable nation" concept from the
Clinton years. America, she said, "must con
front our enemies without alienating our
friends."
