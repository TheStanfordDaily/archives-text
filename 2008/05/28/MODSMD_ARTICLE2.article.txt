## Albright assesses U.S. policies 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Described as "insightful, candid and
humorous" by Political Science Prof. Scott
Sagan, former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright took a packed Kresge Auditorium
on an imaginary "world tour" last night,
highlighting critical regions and offering
strategic advice for the next president.
In a back and forth with Sagan, Albright
largely followed the theme of her recent
book. "Memo to the President Elect" in

which she outlines important geopolitical
hot spots and policy dilemmas for the
incoming executive.
Considering the challenges facing the
future commander in chief. "I think it's a
wonder that anyone wants to run for presi
dent," Albright said.
The first female secretary of state cited a
"dangerous lack of effective leadership
across the globe" for today's precarious
international system.
Throughout the talk, which lasted nearly
an hour and a half. Albright ventured

between concrete proposals (the embargo
on Cuba "has outlived its usefulness") and
election commentary (Sen. John McCain's
proposed league of democracies "doesn't
make sense to me").
Much of Albright's policy followed her
"indispensable nation" concept from the
Clinton years. America, she said, "must con
front our enemies without alienating our
friends."
Albright, now a professor at Georgetown
University's School of Foreign
Service, mixed humor with analysis,
offering rare behind the scenes
glimpses from her travels around the
world.
"Our intelligence was not exactly
correct," she said about North
Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. "They
said he was crazy and a pervert. He's
not crazy."
On the rising power of China:
"First of all, I have only one predic
tion to make, and that is that the
Chinese will win most of the medals
because nobody else will be able to
breathe," she deadpanned.
She further described relations
between America and China as
"multifaceted" before elaborating
on the economics: "It's like the rela
tionship between a drug addict and

pusher, but you don't know which is
which."
Regarding !ndia, Sagan pressed
Albright on how to "square the cir
cle" of accommodating the energy
needs and security interests of the
world's largest democracy while
maintaining the integrity of the
nuclear non-proliferation regime.
Albright was candid in her
response.
"The non-proliferation regime is
broken," she said.
Moving to India's neighbor
Pakistan, Albright rattled off a laun
dry list of problems including terror
ism, poverty, religious extremism
and weak government.
"Pakistan contains every element
that gives you an international
migraine," she said.
While she often criticized the
policies of the Bush administration,
Albright rarely criticized the presi
dent by name. That changed, howev
er, when she called for diplomacy
with Iran.

"It is absolutely essential to talk
with your enemies," she said, con
demning Bush's remarks equating
talks with Iran with appeasement.
Those remarks before the Israeli
Knesset were largely interpreted as
a jab at Sen. Barack Obama, who
said at a presidential debate last
year that he would meet with
Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad.
She cautioned against such high
level talks without preconditions,
however, offering the cautionary tale
of President Kennedy's talks with
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev,
which she claimed led to
Khrushchev interpreting Kennedy
as weak.
Still, she said talking was the best
way to read an adversary.
"That is how you find out what is
going on, that is how you deliver the
tough messages," she said. "I deliv
ered some pretty tough messages."
"I believe you," Sagan quipped.
On the heels of Monday's report

from the International Atomic
Energy Agency offering serious con
cerns about Iran's development of
nuclear weapons, Albright decried
the uncertainty surrounding the situ
ation.
"As an average citizen, 1 don't
have a clue about what's going on in
Iran," she said, "and 1 don't know
who to believe."
Regarding Iraq, the former secre
tary echoed much-heard criticism,
condemning the war as the worst
foreign policy blunder in U.S. history
but warning "there are no good
options."
She called for a "responsible"
withdrawal of troops over time, and
called on U.S. allies and Iraq's neigh
bors to do their part to stabilize the
situation.
"Instead of a surge in troops, we
need a surge in diplomacy," she said.
"There is no military solution to
Iraq."
Albright largely avoided the
realm of domestic politics, but

offered her prediction for the
November election.
"I happen to think the
Democrats are going to control the
whole thing, but that doesn't stop the
fact there should be a bipartisan for
eign policy," she said, calling for the
winner of the election to include
members of the opposite party in his
or her cabinet.
At the end of her talk, Albright
took questions from the audience.
"And since I'm no longer secretary
of state I'll be able to answer them."
she quipped.
Asked by an audience member
why America is not ready for a
female president, Albright, who has
endorsed and vocally supported Sen.
Millar)' Clinton, had a rare moment
of exasperation.
"1 have no idea".she said. "1 hon
estly can't explain it. I find it
depressing."
