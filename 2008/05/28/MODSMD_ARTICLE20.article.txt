# Olympic Hopeful

### BY JACOB JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The NCAA men's gymnastics season
ended over a month ago. For the
Stanford men.it ended in disappoint
ment as the No. 1 ranked Cardinal fell
just short of a national title.
But for a few of the Stanford gymnasts, the
season was just one part — albeit an impor
tant part — of the journey. After a few days
off, the Ford Center was bustling once again
as a handful of Stanford gymnasts with na
tional and Olympic aspirations got back to
work.
Last weekend, their hard work paid off at
the 2008 USA Championships. Senior Dave
Sender, captain of the Stanford team, won the
overall competition. He also qualified for the
Olympic Trials to be held this June in Philadel
phia.
Sender wasn't the only Stanford gymnast
vying for a shot at the Olympic Trials this past
weekend. Also competing were redshirt junior

Sho Nakamori, junior Bryant Hadden. and
freshmen Josh Dixon. Ryan Lieberman and
Tim Gentry. Although all of the Stanford men
turned in solid performances throughout the
meet, only Sender advanced to Trials.
Sender placed fourth on high bar and floor

exercise, fifth on still rings, and eighth on par
allel bars. He also placed first on vault, claim
ing his third national title after winning the
event in 2004 and 2006.
Sender reflected on his victory after return
ing to the Farm on Sunday night.
'it was a lot of fun," he said. "There's still
plenty of work to do (in the weeks leading up
to Trials]."

Sender's training over the next month will
focus on perfection, rhythm and the little de
tails that become more important as the level
of competition increases.
Although his victory this weekend was an
important step towards an Olympic berth.

Sender still has his work cut out for him.
"Winning [USA Championships] helps,
but it doesn't mean you've made the
[Olympic] team," he said.
Because USA Gymnastics uses a selection
committee and not an objective points system
to pick the Olympic roster, there are no guar
antees.
"If 1 don't prove myself at Trials, they don't

have to take me."
There's no doubt that winning the national
title in the all-around competition helps his
cause. Sender will try to use the momentum he
gained this weekend to propel him to the ulti
mate goal of making the USA Olympic team.
He says he learned a valuable lesson from this
weekend — success comes easier when you're
having fun.
"I'm going to try not to view it as 'I'm the
National Champion' so I don't put too much
pressure on myself," he said.
The meet was a disappointment for
Nakamori, who has been a member of the
USA Senior National Team for many years.
He turned in solid routines throughout the
meet but finished 20th overall, six spots out of
contention for Trials. Sender was surprised
and disappointed that his teammate didn't
place higher, although he noted that it was a
positive sign of the improved depth of the US
team.
The Olympic Trials will be held June 19-22
in Philadelphia, PA.
