# SLAC-bound Iranians hindered
## Energy Department extensively screens all Iranian applicants 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
The following is the second of two reports on
Iranian students and scientists at Stanford.
Part one ran in Tuesday's issue of The Daily.
Though many Iranian students and
researchers hoping to study in the U.S. face
hurdles in their attempts to garner U.S. visas,
the obstacles do not end once they step foot
in the States.
But for those looking to conduct research
at one of the premier particle physics facili
ties in the world — the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, or SLAC — additional
government screenings are guaranteed. In
these cases, the extensive background checks
are issued by the U.S. Department of Energy,
which owns SLAC.
Shahram Rahatlou
Iranian-born Shahram Rahatlou conduct
ed research at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) for six years
before he was prohibited from entering the
facility in 2(X)3 by the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE).
Both Applied Physics Professor Emeritus
Herman Winick, who serves as assistant
director of the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory Division at SLAC, and
Physics Department Chair Patricia Burchat
confirmed Rahatlou's basic story to The
Daily. Rahatlou, now a professor in Italy, was
unavailable for comment.
At the time of his expulsion, Rahatlou was
called one of the top particle physics students
in the U.S. According to Burchat, Rahatlou's
Ph.D. thesis on research, which was done
using S LAC's Baßar particle detector, won
him the 2004 Mitsuyoshi Tanaka Dissertation
Award — an annual prize for an exceptional
thesis in experimental particle physics.
"I was very aware of Shah ram's work
because he was one of our really excellent
graduate students," Burchat said."l was real
ly pleased when he won that award."
Because he was barred from all DOE
facilities, Rahatlou was not allowed to repre
sent SLAC at a Baßar collaboration in
Illinois' Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory, or Fermilab.

"I le couldn't get on site to give the talk,"
Burchat said. "He ended up phoning in with
a phone into the conference room so that he
could be off-site and give the talk."
"It had a huge impact," Burchat added,
noting that Rahatlou eventually moved to
Rome because of the obstacles to working in
the U.S. At 34. Rahatlou currently serves as
an assistant professor of physics at the
Sapienza University of Rome.
According to a 2004 article in Nature
Magazine, DOE security officials offered no
explanation for Rahatlou's expulsion and
said the decision would not be appealed.
DOE spokesman Jeff Sherwood declined
to comment on Rahatlou's case.
SLAC and the DOE
On work done at SLAC, Winick empha
sized students and scientists at the facility
must publish all work and research.
"There is no secrecy here," he said. "There
are no guns, no guards, no dogs anywhere
here. No classified work can be done at
SLAC, according to the contract with the
government."
But while SI.AC is open to scientists of all
backgrounds, the DOE puts restrictions on
who can and cannot work at the facility.
"SLAC itself is extremely open to any
body," he said. "All they care about is if you're
a good scientist.The problem is the DOE and
the federal government put restrictions on
what we can do."
Sherwood told The Daily in an email that,
in general, the government does not have a
say in who Stanford hires at SLAC, "as long
as those hiring practices are consistent with
state and federal laws and protocols."
"As a DOE-funded, unclassified facility,
SLAC is required to report the visits and/or
assignments of individuals from countries
identified by the U.S. State Department as
sensitive or terrorist-sponsoring," he said, ref
erencing Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria.
If an individual from a T-5 country, or a
terrorist-sponsoring country, wants to visit or
work at SLAC or any DOE site, a back
ground check and DOE approval are
required. Usually that process takes four to
six months, Sherwood said, acknowl
edging that "based on backlog or the
complexity of the background
check, this process may take longer."
Mahdiyar Noorbala, a second
year doctoral student in physics,
applied for a research position at
SLAC in October 2(X)b. and said his
application was approved seven
months later.
"Science Is International"
With regard to graduate admis
sion, Burchat noted that the
University tries to overlook nation
ality in its evaluations. "We promote
bringing people here based on their
talents, not their nationalities," she
said. "We try to base our selection on
the applicant and not the ease with
which they are going to get a visa."
American Physical Society
President Arthur Bienenstock told
The Daily that the U.S. government

is wary of Iranian students due to
concerns that Iran is developing
nuclear weapons for military use.
The International Atomic Energy
Agency said Monday in a report that
Iran's nuclear research remains "a
matter of serious concern" and that
the country still owes the agency
"substantial explanations."
"Our administration [in
Washington] fears that Iran is on a
path to construct nuclear weapons,"
Bienenstock said, "and is appropri
ately fearful of it. So it's being very
careful about the Iranian students
that it admits to the United States
and those that it allows access to the
national laboratories in general."
Bienenstock previously served as
President Bill Clinton's associate
director of the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy,
assistant director of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
at SLAC and special assistant to
University President John Hennessy
on SLAC. I le emphasized Hennessy
is "very involved" in matters con
cerning science and security.
Winick, whose efforts have

resulted in the construction of a new
synchrotron radiation research facil
ity in the Middle Hast, acknowl
edged national security concerns hut
also underscored the importance of
scientific collaboration to interna
tional peace. "Science is internation
al." he said. "There is no such thing
as national science, just like there is
no national multiplication table. If
you restrict your science to only
national activities, it will fall so far so
far behind so quickly that it will
become irrelevant."
Winick noted that council meet
ings for the new facility in Jordan —
called SESAME — features repre
sentatives from countries that do not
recognize each other, but whose
council members come together
over scientific discussion.
"Israel sits next to Iran, and they
become friends. It's almost bizarre.
The science promotes understand
ing and ultimately, peace."
