# TRUE TWO-WAY PLAYER
## AUSTIN YOUNT SHINES FOR CARD BOTH WITH THE BAT AND ON THE RUBBER 
### BY DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The traditional phrase is "jack of all trades, master
of none." But don't tell that to Stanford hurler and
third baseman Austin Yount, who is rapidly
becoming one of the Cardinal's greatest assets
both on the mound and at the plate.
Yount, who pitched the first complete game of his
career on Friday, has had to take a more active role in his
duties as a pitcher for the Cardinal since the midseason
injury to preseason ace Jeremy Bleich. And in a game
Stanford probably needed to win to earn the right to host
a Regional, Yount came through with his best perform
ance of the season on the mound, going the full nine
innings, allowing four runs and showing excellent control

in walking just one and striking out ten in Stanford's 9-4
victory.
The Stanford junior, however, offered plenty of praise
for his teammates for the way they played defensively and
the support they gave him on the scoreboard in his win
over the Huskies.
"I was just trying to throw strikes and keep our team in
the ball game," he said. "Our team played great defense
behind me, and that helped me out a lot, and our offense

was able to jump out early making it a little easier to pitch.
It was really a whole team effort."
"Hosting a Regional is great for the home field advan
tage, and also, [with] our academics, being at home allows
us to stay in our classes and with finals coming up it makes
things a lot easier for us." Yount said when asked about the
impact of being able to play the Regional round of the

Stanford junior Austin Yount has been a crucial piece of this year's baseball team both in the batter's box and on the mound.
Last weekend he pitched the first complete game of his career to help secure host status for the Card in this weekend's
NCAA Regional.
postseason at Sunken Diamond.
Make no mistake, though,
Yount's contributions to the
Cardinal have amounted to far
more than a single brilliant start
this season. Albeit, in limited at
bats, he is the current owner of the
team's third highest batting average
(.343) and third highest on-base
percentage (.416); he's behind
offensive mainstays Jason Castro
and Cord Phelps in both categories.
When paired with his ERA of
3.88 — fourth best on the team
among players with who have seen
significant time — Yount's versatili
ty made him truly a dual threat off
the bench before his elevation to
the starting role. At a moment's
notice, coach Mark Marquess
would be free to insert Yount into
the lineup or onto the mound. It's a
role that Yount has relished as it
enables him to help the team in
nearly any situation.
"I try to prepare for both as best
I can during practice," he said. "I'll
hit, I'll throw and try to be ready for
whatever my role might be that day.

I just constantly try and do what 1
can to help the team, whether that's
hitting one day or pitching the
next."
Yount's name is doubtless famil
iar to baseball fans at Stanford and
beyond. He is the nephew of MLB
Hall of Famer Robin Yount, who
spent his 19-year career with the
Milwaukee Brewers, earning three
trips to the All-Star game and a pair
of AL MVP awards in the process.
Austin also has a father, Larry, with
plenty of experience in the game,
having pitched in the minor leagues
for the Houston Astros. Austin
gives credit to them both in helping
him build his own baseball career to
date.
"Definitely having my father
and my uncle around [has been] a
huge help," he said. "They both
know the game really well and
they've always been there for me.
My dad, he taught me to play, and
he's always been there, through the
good times and the bad. and you
can't say that enough, how much
he's helped me out throughout the
years."
Now, with the Cardinal gearing
up for the postseason, Yount will be
looking to draw on all that he's
learned from the deep baseball
roots within his own family, as well

as the experience he has built in his
own career going forward.
Although he had not yet been told
when he would get his next start as
of Tuesday, it seems likely that
Yount will be featured once again
in the Cardinal's starting rotation
given his most recent performance.
Yount's transition from the bullpen
to the rotation is just another exam
ple of the extraordinary versatility
the junior has displSyed this year.
"1 try to do anything 1 can to
help the team, and 1 in this case the
team needed some starting pitch
ing. so I've tried to fill in as best I
could," he said. "1 started in high
school, so it's not something I've
never done before."
As for the competition he's like
ly to face, Yount has no doubts
about their abilities.
"All the teams in the Regional
are very good and it's going to be
very competitive," he said. "I'm
looking forward to playing this
weekend. From here on out all the
teams are good and all the teams
deserve to be there."
As does the Cardinal. Thanks, in
part, to the contributions of perhaps
its most versatile player.
