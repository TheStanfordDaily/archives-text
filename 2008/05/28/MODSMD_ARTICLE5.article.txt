# STUDENT LIFE
## Program for teachers is popular 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Interest in Teach for America is surging
at schools across the nation, and Stanford is
no exception.
The highly selective program chooses
college students for a two-year teaching
commitment at schools nationwide. After
training, these students are assigned a sub
ject and grade level, ranging from pre-school
to twelfth grade. The teachers are then
placed in under-resourced schools through
out the nation.
Teach for America — founded by a
Princeton graduate and implemented in
1990 — trains selected students during the
summer and then continues training
throughout the school year within the stu
dent's assigned school district. After being
accepted to the program, students take a
school district test on the principles of
learning and teaching, with two subject-spe
cific tests similar to Advanced Placement
tests.
According to The New York l imes, appli
cations for the program increased by 28 per-
cent from 18,000 in 2007 to almost
25,000 this year.
Caitlin Berka '08, who is going to
New Orleans in the fall, has lived in
the Bay Area for most of her life and
wants to live in the South "for the
variety." Her tentative placement is
social studies, anywhere from sixth to
twelfth grade, but she said the place
ment depends on the needs of the
school district.
"One of the core members [in
New Orleans] said that this is our
generation's task." Berka said. "1
wanted to be able to say that 1 was
there actually lending a hand."
While she admitted that Teach for
America would be a good way to
postpone entering into the real
world, Berka said she loves learning
and is ready to take on the challenge
of teaching.
"My mom's a teacher, so I've seen
first-hand how hard it is," she said.
"Teach for America is a perfect way
to meld my desire for learning and to
pass learning on to younger kids."
Berka also said she believes those
recruited by the program will serve

the education industry well in the
future.
"1 feel like Teach for America
tries to recruit people who will really
he trying to shape education policy
at a nationwide level" Berka said.
Deepa Alagesan '07 — currently
teaching biology to ninth, tenth and
twelfth graders in New York City —
said the program has been an overall
positive experience.
"1 think [Teach for America) has
a lot of strengths," she said. "They've
been very supportive. Overall, 1
think they have a very dedicated and
competent staff. Even just the other
core members in my year. I've been
so impressed by the quality they
attract."
Alagesan admitted that she and
her fellow teachers struggled initial
ly, hut she pursued her teaching
because she had previously been
interested in the profession.
"1 never really got set on any one
career path when 1 was in college,"
Alagesan said. "It was a great oppor
tunity to get exposed to teaching and
see if it was what I wanted to do."
Berka said she is both apprehen
sive and excited for the next two
years.
"1 don't really know what I'm
going to get." she said. "But I feel
like that's probably what life after
college is like for most people."
Critics of the Teach for America
program have said students are not
effectively trained to be proper
teachers.
"It probably wouldn't continue to
exist if it weren't successful on some
levels," Berka said. "[But] there is
kind of an agenda that 1 don't always
entirely agree with. Teach for
America's very much concerned
with standardized testing scores,
which are important but not the best
measure of how someone's learning,
I think."
Alagesan's advised prospective
program applicants to evaluate their
career choices.
"1 think that people who are
interested should examine why they
want to [apply] and see what they
want to get out of it," she said.
"Some people struggle with it a lot,
but the more you ground yourself in
the reasons for being there, the
more you're able to pull through
those struggles."
