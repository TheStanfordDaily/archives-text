Like most busy students, it's fair to
say that Tom O'Sullivan doesn't al
ways have his feet on the ground.
The third year doctoral candidate
in electrical engineering, however,
takes it literally — and has his private pilot's li
cense to prove it.
"Around here 1 fly to Napa,Tahoe,southern
California, Monterey, and 1 enjoy checking out
new airports ... 1 fly about one to two times a
month to try to keep my currency," O'Sullivan
said. The Chicago native began flying while a
college student at Northwestern. His bedroom
is adorned with in-flight photographs of the
Midway skyline.
Chris Unkel. a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate
in computer science, has logged about 128
hours since learning to fly in May of 2004.
Unkel was egged on by a friend from college.
When his pal completed his pilot training,
"he said it was cool, and 1 thought if he can do
it, 1 can do it," Unkel said. He signed up for a
demonstration ride, hit it off with the instructor
and got his certificate ten months later, to the
day.
O'Sullivan and Unkel both fly out of Palo
Alto Airport (PAO) through the West Valley
Flying Club (WVFC), one of several private
clubs stationed at the airport. PAO is on the
eastern side of CA-101 off of Embarcadero
Road, adjacent to a municipal golf course and
a wildlife preserve on the shore of San Francis
co Bay. O'Sullivan knows of at least three other
Stanford students who fly through WVFC and
at least one Stanford professor who takes to
the skies.
Preparing lor takeoff
O'Sullivan is required by the flying club to
fly once every 60 days to maintain currency for
his club flight insurance. Early one spring
morning, he arrives at PAO at about 9 a.m. and
ducks into the aviation shop to get some charts,
then gets the airplane key in the flying club
lobby.
His plane on this day is a 2005-built Cessna
182-T Skylane — a larger cousin of the Cessna
172 Skyhawk, the most-produced aircraft
model in the world. The plane's fuel-injected
piston engine uses a leaded form of gasoline
which, like automotive gas. has hit pilots hard
with recent price increases.
O'Sullivan walks to the tarmac and. after
fetching a checklist from the back seat, begins
the very thorough process of evaluating the
plane's airworthiness. The first step involves
removing the tailrope that hooks the plane se
curely to the ground, something that has
caused considerable embarrassment to pilots
who have missed it.
On the outside,the entire plane's aluminum
body is visually and manually checked; a defor
mity in the plane's skin or wings could lead to
a loss of lift or an aerodynamic disturbance in
flight. Fuel tanks, control surface actuators, air
inlets, wheels and struts are all checked for
cleanliness and integrity.
In the inside of the cabin, oil and battery
readings are checked along with the plane's
registration and airworthiness certificate. A
look at the clock counter reveals the plane has
logged 609.1 hours.
O'Sullivan starts the Garmin GI(XX) com
puterized instrument panel, a dual-LCD setup
featuring graphical displays of all standard in
struments, plus a GPS map. Among the very

valuable items in a plane's instrumentation are
the altimeter,airspeed indicator,fuel indicator,
compass and a radio to communicate with Air
Traffic Control (ATC).
The setup includes the artificial horizon in
dicator, a gyroscopic device that gives a reli
able reading of the alignment of the plane's
nose — telling the pilot which direction is
down.
There is also an autopilot and radio naviga
tion aids. The 6-cylinder, 230-horsepower en
gine drives a three-blade propeller 79 inches in
diameter, providing forward and upward
power (see sidebar).The propeller is a danger
ous implement, and not just on the ground —
O'Sullivan remarks that on a night flight of his
from Chicago to Minnesota, he landed to find
that the propeller had taken out a bird in the
air and was covered in blood and feathers.
Content with the check. O'Sullivan fires up
the engine, taxis to the runway and gets clear
ance to take off. The runway heading is approx
imately 310 degrees, facing northwest towards
Palo Alto proper. After he pushes in the throt
tle, the plane hops off the runway; he banks left
over the Dumbarton Bridge and is off to the
Pacific coast.
(letting the license
A private pilot's license in the United
States, called a certificate by the Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA), requires a mini
mum of 40 hours of flight time in addition to
passing written and oral exams. The flying
hours must cover various scenarios, including
nighttime, cross-country — in excess of 50
miles one-way — solo flying and a minimum

1. Four forces — thrust, drag, lift and weight — govern the op
eration of an airplane.
A propeller engine pulls the plane through the air from the front of
the aircraft (as opposed to jet technology, which pushes hot com
bustion products out of the back of the engine).
Via Newton's Third Law concerning action and reaction, the pro
peller pushing air back creates a reaction force that pulls the plane
forward, slightly mitigated by drag forces. The action of air moving
across the wing produces an upwaid force on the wing called lift.
Lift counterbalances the aircraft's weight, and when large enough,
pulls the plane off the runway and upward in the air. A stall occurs
when the wing loses the flow of air due to low thrust or high nose
angle, causing lift to vanish.
[levators on the plane's tail can be moved up and down to change
the vertical orientation of the plane's nose, enabling fine control
over altitude and airspeed. Ailerons tilt the wings sideways, while
the rudder rotates the heading of the plane. If is desirable to syn
chronize the use of ailerons and the rudder to "lean in" to o turn,
avoiding the "corners" effect as when a car turns sharply and its oc
cupants ore forced to the outside of the arc.
Due to winds, the airspeed of the plane may be different from its
ground speed. Because lift is proportional to airspeed over the
wings, it is advantageous to take off facing into the wind, os the
positive offset in airspeed will produce enough lift foi takeoff given
a lower groundspeed; this means a shorter runway is required to
get up to takeoff speed.

number of takeoffs and landings.
The final step is passing an oral examina
tion and a checkride with an examiner. This
will qualify a pilot for the most basic paradigm
of flying, called Visual Flight Rules (VFR). In
VFR, the pilot is responsible for navigating,
avoiding obstacles and keeping clear of other
aircraft, all by looking outside the plane. The
restrictions and requirements of VFR can
make novice flying difficult in situations like
the continually-overcast winter skies of the Pa
cific Northwest or the dynamic weather pat
terns of the eastern seaboard.
Costs for the process include instructor fees
(around $50 per hour), aircraft rental (in the
vicinity of $150 per hour plus a fuel surcharge)
and "ground school." It is common for students
to take many more than the required number
of hours to get licensed, and it is not a cheap
hobby — both O'Sullivan and Unkel say it
took about 70 flight hours and more than
$10,000 to earn their private certificates.
Other certifications can be earned for com
mercial (for-hire) work, helicopters, acrobatics,
gliders and even airships. The most common
rating earned by private pilots after their initial
certificate is for Instrument Flight Rules
(IFR). Under IFR, the pilot relies completely
on instruments, with the help of ATC. to navi
gate and avoid obstacles including other
planes. It is the only option for flying in in
clement weather, and is the exclusive mode of
flying for major commercial aircraft.
Over Ihe hills to Monterey
As he converses with ATC, O'Sullivan
heads due west over the Stanford foothills and
then follows the coast to the south. ATC is re
sponsible for assigning airspace to planes in
space and time, and for granting takeoff and
landing permissions in an orderly fashion. Air
traffic controllers worldwide are required to
communicate in English if requested by a
pilot.
Upon reaching Monterey, O'Sullivan de
scends and undertakes two full landings and
re-takeoffs. Takeoff is a simple process — push
in the throttle until the proper airspeed is
reached, and a nudge of the yoke will bring the
wheels off the ground.
Conversely, landing the plane is a high
stress maneuver that involves descending to
just a few feet above the runway while drop
ping airspeed, pulling the nose up enough to
cause a stall (called a flare) and. hopefully,
touching down gently and at a low enough
speed to stop before overrunning the landing
area. It is even more complicated today due to
the crosswind, which requires a extra tech
nique whereby the two main wheels touch
down at different times.
In a humorous exchange, ATC converses
with a private jet on the parallel runway The
heavily-accented Australian pilot complains as
his departure is delayed for over five minutes,
due to a coyote on the runway who has de
clined to move out of the jet's takeoff path.
With the coyote affair behind him, O'Sulli
van proceeds to return home. Strip mines and
otherwise-hidden industrial operations in the
hills are visible from the air on the clear day.
The route back to PAO is full of sights, from
Moffet Field to the Shoreline Amphitheater
and numerous high school football stadiums.
Safety
There are myriad risks associated with avi
ation. Checklists, training and safety measures
seek to minimize the risks. Redundant systems

— two sets of instruments, two power sources,
and in some cases, two pilots — go a long way
towards avoiding disaster.
Pilots continually scan the sky for air traffic,
and listen to the ATC radio while in the air to
keep abreast of other planes in the area. Even
the start of a flight contains a safety measure
— before turning over the engine, the pilot
shouts "CLEAR PROP!" out the window to
ensure no bystanders will get hit with the
newly-rotating propeller.
Approaches to PAO can be complicated
due to nearby San Jose International Airport.
And there is the problem of flying at night. Ac
cording to Unkel, night flight in the Bay Area
is stunning, but can be particularly dangerous
in the hills west of the developed areas.
"It's like a carpet of lights laid out — San
Francisco is spectacular," he said, "but the hills
at 4,000 feet are invisible on a moonless night."
He added that fog rolling in on the coast can be
quite disorienting. Despite this, he asserts that
the area's safety record is "quite good."
Pilots can invest in their safety by filing a
flight plan with the FAA, documenting their
planned route. Under VFR they are not re
quired, but if a pilot is overdue, i.e. goes miss
ing, search and rescue will be activated. Under
IFR flight plans are mandatory in order to as
sist ATC in managing airspace.
Understandably, there are strict alcohol
regulations. A pilot must be eight hours "bottle
to throttle" to fly, and a pilot's blood-alcohol
content must be below 0.08% — though one
can imagine that a person who has abstained
from alcohol for eight hours and still has a de
tectable BAC at all is in no shape to be flying a
plane.
As with automobiles, insurance can provide
financial security in the event of an accident for
the plane, the pilot and any passengers.
A pilot is the master safety officer for a
flight, entrusted with all safety decisions, and
can even deviate from ATC instructions in an
emergency. The most effective safety measures
are stringently checking the aircraft before
takeoff, maintaining in-flight awareness and
avoiding high-risk activity.
Further licensing
Even for those who don't want to be aerial
acrobats, there are lots of exciting things to do
with a pilot's license.
One option is the Civil Air Patrol, the civil
ian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force.The CAP en
rolls private citizens to assist in regional emer
gency service and homeland-security activities,
and encourages youth education in aviation
and aerospace issues.
It's unlikely that flying yourself to a region
al destination will be cheaper than a commer
cial flight, but it will probably be more scenic,
and you won't have to take your shoes off or
empty your bag before boarding the aircraft.
Other paths include fly-for-hire, cargo car
rying, or aerial photography Due to the need
to maintain currency and the cost-splitting ad
vantages, social opportunities within the flying
clubs are strong.
And of course, there's just the fun of it.
"Many times I will go and take someone
just to get a bite to eat somewhere
else," O'Sullivan said. This is known among pi
lots as the "$lOO hamburger."
Unkel said, however, that with today's eco
nomics, "It's more like a $200 salad."

the aircraft (as opposed to jet technology, which pushes hot com
bustion products out of the back of the engine).
Via Newton's Third Law concerning action and reaction, the pro
peller pushing air back creates a reaction force that pulls the plane
forward, slightly mitigated by drag forces. The action of air moving
across the wing produces an upwaid force on the wing called lift.
Lift counterbalances the aircraft's weight, and when large enough,
pulls the plane off the runway and upward in the air. A stall occurs
when the wing loses the flow of air due to low thrust or high nose
angle, causing lift to vanish.
[levators on the plane's tail can be moved up and down to change
the vertical orientation of the plane's nose, enabling fine control
over altitude and airspeed. Ailerons tilt the wings sideways, while
the rudder rotates the heading of the plane. If is desirable to syn
chronize the use of ailerons and the rudder to "lean in" to o turn,
avoiding the "corners" effect as when a car turns sharply and its oc
cupants ore forced to the outside of the arc.
Due to winds, the airspeed of the plane may be different from its
ground speed. Because lift is proportional to airspeed over the
wings, it is advantageous to take off facing into the wind, os the
positive offset in airspeed will produce enough lift foi takeoff given
a lower groundspeed; this means a shorter runway is required to
get up to takeoff speed.

number of takeoffs and landings.
The final step is passing an oral examina
tion and a checkride with an examiner. This
will qualify a pilot for the most basic paradigm
of flying, called Visual Flight Rules (VFR). In
VFR, the pilot is responsible for navigating,
avoiding obstacles and keeping clear of other
aircraft, all by looking outside the plane. The
restrictions and requirements of VFR can
make novice flying difficult in situations like
the continually-overcast winter skies of the Pa
cific Northwest or the dynamic weather pat
terns of the eastern seaboard.
Costs for the process include instructor fees
(around $50 per hour), aircraft rental (in the
vicinity of $150 per hour plus a fuel surcharge)
and "ground school." It is common for students
to take many more than the required number
of hours to get licensed, and it is not a cheap
hobby — both O'Sullivan and Unkel say it
took about 70 flight hours and more than
$10,000 to earn their private certificates.
Other certifications can be earned for com
mercial (for-hire) work, helicopters, acrobatics,
gliders and even airships. The most common
rating earned by private pilots after their initial
certificate is for Instrument Flight Rules
(IFR). Under IFR, the pilot relies completely
on instruments, with the help of ATC. to navi
gate and avoid obstacles including other
planes. It is the only option for flying in in
clement weather, and is the exclusive mode of
flying for major commercial aircraft.
Over Ihe hills to Monterey
As he converses with ATC, O'Sullivan
heads due west over the Stanford foothills and
then follows the coast to the south. ATC is re
sponsible for assigning airspace to planes in
space and time, and for granting takeoff and
landing permissions in an orderly fashion. Air
traffic controllers worldwide are required to
communicate in English if requested by a
pilot.
Upon reaching Monterey, O'Sullivan de
scends and undertakes two full landings and
re-takeoffs. Takeoff is a simple process — push
in the throttle until the proper airspeed is
reached, and a nudge of the yoke will bring the
wheels off the ground.
Conversely, landing the plane is a high
stress maneuver that involves descending to
just a few feet above the runway while drop
ping airspeed, pulling the nose up enough to
cause a stall (called a flare) and. hopefully,
touching down gently and at a low enough
speed to stop before overrunning the landing
area. It is even more complicated today due to
the crosswind, which requires a extra tech
nique whereby the two main wheels touch
down at different times.
In a humorous exchange, ATC converses
with a private jet on the parallel runway The
heavily-accented Australian pilot complains as
his departure is delayed for over five minutes,
due to a coyote on the runway who has de
clined to move out of the jet's takeoff path.
With the coyote affair behind him, O'Sulli
van proceeds to return home. Strip mines and
otherwise-hidden industrial operations in the
hills are visible from the air on the clear day.
The route back to PAO is full of sights, from
Moffet Field to the Shoreline Amphitheater
and numerous high school football stadiums.
Safety
There are myriad risks associated with avi
ation. Checklists, training and safety measures
seek to minimize the risks. Redundant systems

— two sets of instruments, two power sources,
and in some cases, two pilots — go a long way
towards avoiding disaster.
Pilots continually scan the sky for air traffic,
and listen to the ATC radio while in the air to
keep abreast of other planes in the area. Even
the start of a flight contains a safety measure
— before turning over the engine, the pilot
shouts "CLEAR PROP!" out the window to
ensure no bystanders will get hit with the
newly-rotating propeller.
Approaches to PAO can be complicated
due to nearby San Jose International Airport.
And there is the problem of flying at night. Ac
cording to Unkel, night flight in the Bay Area
is stunning, but can be particularly dangerous
in the hills west of the developed areas.
"It's like a carpet of lights laid out — San
Francisco is spectacular," he said, "but the hills
at 4,000 feet are invisible on a moonless night."
He added that fog rolling in on the coast can be
quite disorienting. Despite this, he asserts that
the area's safety record is "quite good."
Pilots can invest in their safety by filing a
flight plan with the FAA, documenting their
planned route. Under VFR they are not re
quired, but if a pilot is overdue, i.e. goes miss
ing, search and rescue will be activated. Under
IFR flight plans are mandatory in order to as
sist ATC in managing airspace.
Understandably, there are strict alcohol
regulations. A pilot must be eight hours "bottle
to throttle" to fly, and a pilot's blood-alcohol
content must be below 0.08% — though one
can imagine that a person who has abstained
from alcohol for eight hours and still has a de
tectable BAC at all is in no shape to be flying a
plane.
As with automobiles, insurance can provide
financial security in the event of an accident for
the plane, the pilot and any passengers.
A pilot is the master safety officer for a
flight, entrusted with all safety decisions, and
can even deviate from ATC instructions in an
emergency. The most effective safety measures
are stringently checking the aircraft before
takeoff, maintaining in-flight awareness and
avoiding high-risk activity.
Further licensing
Even for those who don't want to be aerial
acrobats, there are lots of exciting things to do
with a pilot's license.
One option is the Civil Air Patrol, the civil
ian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force.The CAP en
rolls private citizens to assist in regional emer
gency service and homeland-security activities,
and encourages youth education in aviation
and aerospace issues.
It's unlikely that flying yourself to a region
al destination will be cheaper than a commer
cial flight, but it will probably be more scenic,
and you won't have to take your shoes off or
empty your bag before boarding the aircraft.
Other paths include fly-for-hire, cargo car
rying, or aerial photography Due to the need
to maintain currency and the cost-splitting ad
vantages, social opportunities within the flying
clubs are strong.
And of course, there's just the fun of it.
"Many times I will go and take someone
just to get a bite to eat somewhere
else," O'Sullivan said. This is known among pi
lots as the "$lOO hamburger."
Unkel said, however, that with today's eco
nomics, "It's more like a $200 salad."

Third year doctoral student Tom O'Sullivan
is training to receive his private pilot's li
cense. Earlier this quarter, he flew down the
coast, passing over Moss Landing (above)
along the coast north of Monterey.


CRISTINA BAUTISTA/
The Stanford Daily
Like most busy students, it's fair to
say that Tom O'Sullivan doesn't al
ways have his feet on the ground.
The third year doctoral candidate
in electrical engineering, however,
takes it literally — and has his private pilot's li
cense to prove it.
"Around here 1 fly to Napa,Tahoe,southern
California, Monterey, and 1 enjoy checking out
new airports ... 1 fly about one to two times a
month to try to keep my currency," O'Sullivan
said. The Chicago native began flying while a
college student at Northwestern. His bedroom
is adorned with in-flight photographs of the
Midway skyline.
Chris Unkel. a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate
in computer science, has logged about 128
hours since learning to fly in May of 2004.
Unkel was egged on by a friend from college.
When his pal completed his pilot training,
"he said it was cool, and 1 thought if he can do
it, 1 can do it," Unkel said. He signed up for a
demonstration ride, hit it off with the instructor
and got his certificate ten months later, to the
day.
O'Sullivan and Unkel both fly out of Palo
Alto Airport (PAO) through the West Valley
Flying Club (WVFC), one of several private
clubs stationed at the airport. PAO is on the
eastern side of CA-101 off of Embarcadero
Road, adjacent to a municipal golf course and
a wildlife preserve on the shore of San Francis
co Bay. O'Sullivan knows of at least three other
Stanford students who fly through WVFC and
at least one Stanford professor who takes to
the skies.
Preparing lor takeoff
O'Sullivan is required by the flying club to
fly once every 60 days to maintain currency for
his club flight insurance. Early one spring
morning, he arrives at PAO at about 9 a.m. and
ducks into the aviation shop to get some charts,
then gets the airplane key in the flying club
lobby.
His plane on this day is a 2005-built Cessna
182-T Skylane — a larger cousin of the Cessna
172 Skyhawk, the most-produced aircraft
model in the world. The plane's fuel-injected
piston engine uses a leaded form of gasoline
which, like automotive gas. has hit pilots hard
with recent price increases.
O'Sullivan walks to the tarmac and. after
fetching a checklist from the back seat, begins
the very thorough process of evaluating the
plane's airworthiness. The first step involves
removing the tailrope that hooks the plane se
curely to the ground, something that has
caused considerable embarrassment to pilots
who have missed it.
On the outside,the entire plane's aluminum
body is visually and manually checked; a defor
mity in the plane's skin or wings could lead to
a loss of lift or an aerodynamic disturbance in
flight. Fuel tanks, control surface actuators, air
inlets, wheels and struts are all checked for
cleanliness and integrity.
In the inside of the cabin, oil and battery
readings are checked along with the plane's
registration and airworthiness certificate. A
look at the clock counter reveals the plane has
logged 609.1 hours.
O'Sullivan starts the Garmin GI(XX) com
puterized instrument panel, a dual-LCD setup
featuring graphical displays of all standard in
struments, plus a GPS map. Among the very

valuable items in a plane's instrumentation are
the altimeter,airspeed indicator,fuel indicator,
compass and a radio to communicate with Air
Traffic Control (ATC).
The setup includes the artificial horizon in
dicator, a gyroscopic device that gives a reli
able reading of the alignment of the plane's
nose — telling the pilot which direction is
down.
There is also an autopilot and radio naviga
tion aids. The 6-cylinder, 230-horsepower en
gine drives a three-blade propeller 79 inches in
diameter, providing forward and upward
power (see sidebar).The propeller is a danger
ous implement, and not just on the ground —
O'Sullivan remarks that on a night flight of his
from Chicago to Minnesota, he landed to find
that the propeller had taken out a bird in the
air and was covered in blood and feathers.
Content with the check. O'Sullivan fires up
the engine, taxis to the runway and gets clear
ance to take off. The runway heading is approx
imately 310 degrees, facing northwest towards
Palo Alto proper. After he pushes in the throt
tle, the plane hops off the runway; he banks left
over the Dumbarton Bridge and is off to the
Pacific coast.
(letting the license
A private pilot's license in the United
States, called a certificate by the Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA), requires a mini
mum of 40 hours of flight time in addition to
passing written and oral exams. The flying
hours must cover various scenarios, including
nighttime, cross-country — in excess of 50
miles one-way — solo flying and a minimum

newly-rotating propeller.
Approaches to PAO can be complicated
due to nearby San Jose International Airport.
And there is the problem of flying at night. Ac
cording to Unkel, night flight in the Bay Area
is stunning, but can be particularly dangerous
in the hills west of the developed areas.
"It's like a carpet of lights laid out — San
Francisco is spectacular," he said, "but the hills
at 4,000 feet are invisible on a moonless night."
He added that fog rolling in on the coast can be
quite disorienting. Despite this, he asserts that
the area's safety record is "quite good."
Pilots can invest in their safety by filing a
flight plan with the FAA, documenting their
planned route. Under VFR they are not re
quired, but if a pilot is overdue, i.e. goes miss
ing, search and rescue will be activated. Under
IFR flight plans are mandatory in order to as
sist ATC in managing airspace.
Understandably, there are strict alcohol
regulations. A pilot must be eight hours "bottle
to throttle" to fly, and a pilot's blood-alcohol
content must be below 0.08% — though one
can imagine that a person who has abstained
from alcohol for eight hours and still has a de
tectable BAC at all is in no shape to be flying a
plane.
As with automobiles, insurance can provide
financial security in the event of an accident for
the plane, the pilot and any passengers.
A pilot is the master safety officer for a
flight, entrusted with all safety decisions, and
can even deviate from ATC instructions in an
emergency. The most effective safety measures
are stringently checking the aircraft before
takeoff, maintaining in-flight awareness and
avoiding high-risk activity.
Further licensing
Even for those who don't want to be aerial
acrobats, there are lots of exciting things to do
with a pilot's license.
One option is the Civil Air Patrol, the civil
ian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force.The CAP en
rolls private citizens to assist in regional emer
gency service and homeland-security activities,
and encourages youth education in aviation
and aerospace issues.
It's unlikely that flying yourself to a region
al destination will be cheaper than a commer
cial flight, but it will probably be more scenic,
and you won't have to take your shoes off or
empty your bag before boarding the aircraft.
Other paths include fly-for-hire, cargo car
rying, or aerial photography Due to the need
to maintain currency and the cost-splitting ad
vantages, social opportunities within the flying
clubs are strong.
And of course, there's just the fun of it.
"Many times I will go and take someone
just to get a bite to eat somewhere
else," O'Sullivan said. This is known among pi
lots as the "$lOO hamburger."
Unkel said, however, that with today's eco
nomics, "It's more like a $200 salad."

Third year doctoral student Tom O'Sullivan
is training to receive his private pilot's li
cense. Earlier this quarter, he flew down the
coast, passing over Moss Landing (above)
along the coast north of Monterey.

The Stanford Daily
Like most busy students, it's fair to
say that Tom O'Sullivan doesn't al
ways have his feet on the ground.
The third year doctoral candidate
in electrical engineering, however,
takes it literally — and has his private pilot's li
cense to prove it.
"Around here 1 fly to Napa,Tahoe,southern
California, Monterey, and 1 enjoy checking out
new airports ... 1 fly about one to two times a
month to try to keep my currency," O'Sullivan
said. The Chicago native began flying while a
college student at Northwestern. His bedroom
is adorned with in-flight photographs of the
Midway skyline.
Chris Unkel. a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate
in computer science, has logged about 128
hours since learning to fly in May of 2004.
Unkel was egged on by a friend from college.
When his pal completed his pilot training,
"he said it was cool, and 1 thought if he can do
it, 1 can do it," Unkel said. He signed up for a
demonstration ride, hit it off with the instructor
and got his certificate ten months later, to the
day.
O'Sullivan and Unkel both fly out of Palo
Alto Airport (PAO) through the West Valley
Flying Club (WVFC), one of several private
clubs stationed at the airport. PAO is on the
eastern side of CA-101 off of Embarcadero
Road, adjacent to a municipal golf course and
a wildlife preserve on the shore of San Francis
co Bay. O'Sullivan knows of at least three other
Stanford students who fly through WVFC and
at least one Stanford professor who takes to
the skies.
Preparing lor takeoff
O'Sullivan is required by the flying club to
fly once every 60 days to maintain currency for
his club flight insurance. Early one spring
morning, he arrives at PAO at about 9 a.m. and
ducks into the aviation shop to get some charts,
then gets the airplane key in the flying club
lobby.
His plane on this day is a 2005-built Cessna
182-T Skylane — a larger cousin of the Cessna
172 Skyhawk, the most-produced aircraft
model in the world. The plane's fuel-injected
piston engine uses a leaded form of gasoline
which, like automotive gas. has hit pilots hard
with recent price increases.
O'Sullivan walks to the tarmac and. after
fetching a checklist from the back seat, begins
the very thorough process of evaluating the
plane's airworthiness. The first step involves
removing the tailrope that hooks the plane se
curely to the ground, something that has
caused considerable embarrassment to pilots
who have missed it.
On the outside,the entire plane's aluminum
body is visually and manually checked; a defor
mity in the plane's skin or wings could lead to
a loss of lift or an aerodynamic disturbance in
flight. Fuel tanks, control surface actuators, air
inlets, wheels and struts are all checked for
cleanliness and integrity.
In the inside of the cabin, oil and battery
readings are checked along with the plane's
registration and airworthiness certificate. A
look at the clock counter reveals the plane has
logged 609.1 hours.
O'Sullivan starts the Garmin GI(XX) com
puterized instrument panel, a dual-LCD setup
featuring graphical displays of all standard in
struments, plus a GPS map. Among the very

valuable items in a plane's instrumentation are
the altimeter,airspeed indicator,fuel indicator,
compass and a radio to communicate with Air
Traffic Control (ATC).
The setup includes the artificial horizon in
dicator, a gyroscopic device that gives a reli
able reading of the alignment of the plane's
nose — telling the pilot which direction is
down.
There is also an autopilot and radio naviga
tion aids. The 6-cylinder, 230-horsepower en
gine drives a three-blade propeller 79 inches in
diameter, providing forward and upward
power (see sidebar).The propeller is a danger
ous implement, and not just on the ground —
O'Sullivan remarks that on a night flight of his
from Chicago to Minnesota, he landed to find
that the propeller had taken out a bird in the
air and was covered in blood and feathers.
Content with the check. O'Sullivan fires up
the engine, taxis to the runway and gets clear
ance to take off. The runway heading is approx
imately 310 degrees, facing northwest towards
Palo Alto proper. After he pushes in the throt
tle, the plane hops off the runway; he banks left
over the Dumbarton Bridge and is off to the
Pacific coast.
(letting the license
A private pilot's license in the United
States, called a certificate by the Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA), requires a mini
mum of 40 hours of flight time in addition to
passing written and oral exams. The flying
hours must cover various scenarios, including
nighttime, cross-country — in excess of 50
miles one-way — solo flying and a minimum

1. Four forces — thrust, drag, lift and weight — govern the op
eration of an airplane.
A propeller engine pulls the plane through the air from the front of
the aircraft (as opposed to jet technology, which pushes hot com
bustion products out of the back of the engine).
Via Newton's Third Law concerning action and reaction, the pro
peller pushing air back creates a reaction force that pulls the plane
forward, slightly mitigated by drag forces. The action of air moving
across the wing produces an upwaid force on the wing called lift.
Lift counterbalances the aircraft's weight, and when large enough,
pulls the plane off the runway and upward in the air. A stall occurs
when the wing loses the flow of air due to low thrust or high nose
angle, causing lift to vanish.
[levators on the plane's tail can be moved up and down to change
the vertical orientation of the plane's nose, enabling fine control
over altitude and airspeed. Ailerons tilt the wings sideways, while
the rudder rotates the heading of the plane. If is desirable to syn
chronize the use of ailerons and the rudder to "lean in" to o turn,
avoiding the "corners" effect as when a car turns sharply and its oc
cupants ore forced to the outside of the arc.
Due to winds, the airspeed of the plane may be different from its
ground speed. Because lift is proportional to airspeed over the
wings, it is advantageous to take off facing into the wind, os the
positive offset in airspeed will produce enough lift foi takeoff given
a lower groundspeed; this means a shorter runway is required to
get up to takeoff speed.

number of takeoffs and landings.
The final step is passing an oral examina
tion and a checkride with an examiner. This
will qualify a pilot for the most basic paradigm
of flying, called Visual Flight Rules (VFR). In
VFR, the pilot is responsible for navigating,
avoiding obstacles and keeping clear of other
aircraft, all by looking outside the plane. The
restrictions and requirements of VFR can
make novice flying difficult in situations like
the continually-overcast winter skies of the Pa
cific Northwest or the dynamic weather pat
terns of the eastern seaboard.
Costs for the process include instructor fees
(around $50 per hour), aircraft rental (in the
vicinity of $150 per hour plus a fuel surcharge)
and "ground school." It is common for students
to take many more than the required number
of hours to get licensed, and it is not a cheap
hobby — both O'Sullivan and Unkel say it
took about 70 flight hours and more than
$10,000 to earn their private certificates.
Other certifications can be earned for com
mercial (for-hire) work, helicopters, acrobatics,
gliders and even airships. The most common
rating earned by private pilots after their initial
certificate is for Instrument Flight Rules
(IFR). Under IFR, the pilot relies completely
on instruments, with the help of ATC. to navi
gate and avoid obstacles including other
planes. It is the only option for flying in in
clement weather, and is the exclusive mode of
flying for major commercial aircraft.
Over Ihe hills to Monterey
As he converses with ATC, O'Sullivan
heads due west over the Stanford foothills and
then follows the coast to the south. ATC is re
sponsible for assigning airspace to planes in
space and time, and for granting takeoff and
landing permissions in an orderly fashion. Air
traffic controllers worldwide are required to
communicate in English if requested by a
pilot.
Upon reaching Monterey, O'Sullivan de
scends and undertakes two full landings and
re-takeoffs. Takeoff is a simple process — push
in the throttle until the proper airspeed is
reached, and a nudge of the yoke will bring the
wheels off the ground.
Conversely, landing the plane is a high
stress maneuver that involves descending to
just a few feet above the runway while drop
ping airspeed, pulling the nose up enough to
cause a stall (called a flare) and. hopefully,
touching down gently and at a low enough
speed to stop before overrunning the landing
area. It is even more complicated today due to
the crosswind, which requires a extra tech
nique whereby the two main wheels touch
down at different times.
In a humorous exchange, ATC converses
with a private jet on the parallel runway The
heavily-accented Australian pilot complains as
his departure is delayed for over five minutes,
due to a coyote on the runway who has de
clined to move out of the jet's takeoff path.
With the coyote affair behind him, O'Sulli
van proceeds to return home. Strip mines and
otherwise-hidden industrial operations in the
hills are visible from the air on the clear day.
The route back to PAO is full of sights, from
Moffet Field to the Shoreline Amphitheater
and numerous high school football stadiums.
Safety
There are myriad risks associated with avi
ation. Checklists, training and safety measures
seek to minimize the risks. Redundant systems

— two sets of instruments, two power sources,
and in some cases, two pilots — go a long way
towards avoiding disaster.
Pilots continually scan the sky for air traffic,
and listen to the ATC radio while in the air to
keep abreast of other planes in the area. Even
the start of a flight contains a safety measure
— before turning over the engine, the pilot
shouts "CLEAR PROP!" out the window to
ensure no bystanders will get hit with the
newly-rotating propeller.
Approaches to PAO can be complicated
due to nearby San Jose International Airport.
And there is the problem of flying at night. Ac
cording to Unkel, night flight in the Bay Area
is stunning, but can be particularly dangerous
in the hills west of the developed areas.

Francisco is spectacular," he said, "but the hills
at 4,000 feet are invisible on a moonless night."

content must be below 0.08% — though one
can imagine that a person who has abstained
from alcohol for eight hours and still has a de
tectable BAC at all is in no shape to be flying a
plane.
As with automobiles, insurance can provide
financial security in the event of an accident for
