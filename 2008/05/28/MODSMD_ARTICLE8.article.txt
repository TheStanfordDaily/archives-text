# THE 						5-SURE DRIVER: A SUPERHERO IN A GOLF CART
## 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, Alison Ganem'll wanted to
get home from a party on the Row, but she did
n't feel safe walking alone. That's when she
thought of campus safety service 5-SURE and
decided to call for a ride home. Within 10 min
utes. her ride had arrived and she was driven
back by a student driver in a golf cart.
The process seems simple now, but 5-
SURE, a completely student managed service,
has evolved considerably over the past few
decades.
5-SURE was founded in l l )7 l ) by student
volunteers because of an editorial in The Daily
written by a woman who had been raped. Mack
then, the students were provided not with golf
carts and walkie-talkies but with whistles,
flashlights and ID cards. Escorts would then
bike to the callers' dorms and walk them to
their destinations.

Originally,s-SURE hired only male escorts
and encouraged female students to call. After
criticism from the feminist community, howev
er, it began employing female escorts and is
now open to all students, regardless of gender.
5-SURE employs 25 student drivers who
use seven golf carts. 5-SURE's full name is
Stanford United for Rape Elimination — a lit
tle known fact.
"When we answer the phone and say 'Stan
ford United for Rape Elimination' people ask
whether they got the wrong number," said
Matt Rivera '11, one of the student drivers.
When a student calls in and asks to be
picked up. he is asked for his name, destination
and phone number. The person who received
the call — in 5-SURE's office ;it Tresidder
Union — and is responsible for dispatch then
sends out a driver to pick him up. The driver
will call the person handling dispatch when he
is near the destination and the dispatcher lets
the caller know that his ride has arrived.

"We have been averaging 14 minutes for
pick up and are trying to get better at it," said
Kyle Knutson '09, co-manager of 5-SURE.
" ITiis quarter, we have been more efficient —
averaging around 12 minutes."
"Last month we received 718 calls [andj 68
cancellations and drove 1,138 people," added
Jeanette Smith-Laws, Director of Unions.
Even though 5-SURE has received increas
ing numbers of calls by the years, a lot of stu
dents are still not aware of this service.
The 5-SURE team is working on letting
people know about the service.To this end. the
team planned Classic 5-SURE night to coin
cide with Exotic Erotic.
"Classic 5-SURE night is a way to incorpo
rate the campus in our events and raise aware
ness of our mission statement," Knutson said.
"We wanted to do it in the spring and we knew
we would have a lot of employees that night.
Last year [on the night of Exotic Erotic] we got
a lot of calls, so it is a good night to have height

ened security."
Instead of sending out golf carts, the 5-
SURE team sent a walking escort to anyone
who called in, reverting back to the methods
originally used by escorts. Dressed in matching
t-shirts, the team handed out whistles and fly
ers bearing information on 5-SURE.
"We even have more flexibility since you
can get anywhere on foot," Knutson added.
However, Classic 5-SURE night did not
work out as planned.
"1 can walk. I don't need a walker!" ex
claimed one caller when informed that she
would be sent a walking escort instead of a golf
cart.
A lot of students cancelled their calls when
they were told that they would receive a walk
er, but a few did ask for escorts. The 5-SURE
employees see this is a good indication that the
riders generally feel safe on campus after dark.
Still, the organizers maintain that
students who asked lor walking es
corts were happy to get them.
"They did not want to walk
around campus alone, especially on
such a high risk night as Exotic Erot
ic," Knutson said. "That type of caller
is precisely what we are here for. and
we want that clientele to know that
thev can count on us for their safety."

5-SURE utilized walkers for four
and a half hours hut then switched to
carts. Even in the limited time, the
service was able to transport the
same number of people as any other
night, due to an increase in available
drivers.
On a normal night, two or three
people work a shift.
"I think we have an extraordinary
group of dedicated, understanding
students who care about the service a
lot." Laws said." I"hey understand the
complexity of it."
The student drivers are extremely
friendly and polite, considering they

have to work from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. on
weekdays or 3 a.m. on weekends. At
the same time, they have to be strict
about not letting people get on the
cart if it is full and not letting them
bring alcohol onto the cart."
One of the skills drivers acquire is
driving with one hand and using the
walkie-talkie with the other as well as
being able to listen in when a bunch
of excited people in the back are
screaming. They also learn to say no
to the sexual advances of people who
really want to get onto the cart.
"A lot of people love you when
vou work with 5-SURE!" Rivera

said. "It's a really popular service and
is really enjoyable. Sometimes peo
ple drink too much and Jike to share
secrets."
5-SURE uses three kinds of carts
— four-seat electric Ford Thinks that
go up to 25 mph. four-seat club cars
that run on gas and go up to 12 mph
and an eight-seat Yamaha that is run
on gas and goes up to 12 mph — usu
ally less when filled to capacity.
"They are really golf carts that are
not designed for six and eight peo
ple." Laws commented when asked
about the slow speed of the 8-seat ve
hicle. "They are never going to go as

fast as 25 mph like other carts."
Additionally, keeping a golf cart
running every day of the week for
hours back-to-back causes a lot of
wear and tear. Laws added that the
carts go through a lot of tires, bear
ings and suspensions and go to the
shop a lot for maintenance.
Laws suggested that some dam
age might be caused by drivers mis
judging distances in the night.
"We are trying to track if it is nor
mal wear and tear because of our
usage or normal wear and tear along
with running into a bollard or getting
off a curb too fast," she added.
In the future, 5-SURE plans to
look into faster and more environ
mentally friendly transportation op
tions. Managers have been meeting
with golf cart makers to see what
kinds of vehicles are available.
"We are looking at options that
may be a little faster, but the point is
to get a person from Point A to Point
B. not how fast the car goes," Laws
said.
5-SURE drivers are limited in
terms of options but as technology
gets better, they are looking to figure
out what other vehicle choices they
can use in the future.
"We are looking for vehicles that
are environmentally friendly and at
the same time short of a real vehicle,
something that we can criss-cross
across campus through the bollards,"
Laws said.
A golf cart service such as 5-
SURE is a type of service employed
by very few other universities. A lot
of other campuses use walking and
bicycle escorts and many use vehi
cles.
According to Knutson, Stanford
has the 5-SURE service for safety
reasons.
"This organization was founded
to help combat the problem of safety.
Few people know that there were
several rapists active at the time that
5-SURE came into being," he said.
"It's important for people to recog
nize how far this organization and
campus safety have come since then,
and we don't want anyone to take
that safety for granted."
"1 foresee a long future," Laws
said. "1 think it is going to be around
for a long time. 1 think the communi
ty of students support 5-SURE and
always have. The university has al
ways supported 5-SURE and will
continue to support it."
