# THE
						5-SURE DRIVER: A SUPERHERO IN A GOLF CART
## 
### SHRUTI TIBREWALA STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, Alison Ganem'll wanted to
get home from a party on the Row, but she did
n't feel safe walking alone. That's when she
thought of campus safety service 5-SURE and
decided to call for a ride home. Within 10 min
utes. her ride had arrived and she was driven
back by a student driver in a golf cart.
The process seems simple now, but 5-
SURE, a completely student managed service,
has evolved considerably over the past few
decades.
5-SURE was founded in l l )7 l ) by student
volunteers because of an editorial in The Daily
written by a woman who had been raped. Mack
then, the students were provided not with golf
carts and walkie-talkies but with whistles,
flashlights and ID cards. Escorts would then
bike to the callers' dorms and walk them to
their destinations.

Originally,s-SURE hired only male escorts
and encouraged female students to call. After
criticism from the feminist community, howev
er, it began employing female escorts and is
now open to all students, regardless of gender.
5-SURE employs 25 student drivers who
use seven golf carts. 5-SURE's full name is
Stanford United for Rape Elimination — a lit
tle known fact.
"When we answer the phone and say 'Stan
ford United for Rape Elimination' people ask
whether they got the wrong number," said
Matt Rivera '11, one of the student drivers.
When a student calls in and asks to be
picked up. he is asked for his name, destination
and phone number. The person who received
the call — in 5-SURE's office ;it Tresidder
Union — and is responsible for dispatch then
sends out a driver to pick him up. The driver
will call the person handling dispatch when he
is near the destination and the dispatcher lets
the caller know that his ride has arrived.

"We have been averaging 14 minutes for
pick up and are trying to get better at it," said
Kyle Knutson '09, co-manager of 5-SURE.
" ITiis quarter, we have been more efficient —
averaging around 12 minutes."
"Last month we received 718 calls [andj 68
cancellations and drove 1,138 people," added
Jeanette Smith-Laws, Director of Unions.
Even though 5-SURE has received increas
ing numbers of calls by the years, a lot of stu
dents are still not aware of this service.
The 5-SURE team is working on letting
people know about the service.To this end. the
team planned Classic 5-SURE night to coin
cide with Exotic Erotic.
"Classic 5-SURE night is a way to incorpo
rate the campus in our events and raise aware
ness of our mission statement," Knutson said.
"We wanted to do it in the spring and we knew
we would have a lot of employees that night.
Last year [on the night of Exotic Erotic] we got
a lot of calls, so it is a good night to have height

ened security."
Instead of sending out golf carts, the 5-
SURE team sent a walking escort to anyone
who called in, reverting back to the methods
originally used by escorts. Dressed in matching
t-shirts, the team handed out whistles and fly
ers bearing information on 5-SURE.
"We even have more flexibility since you
can get anywhere on foot," Knutson added.
However, Classic 5-SURE night did not
work out as planned.
"1 can walk. I don't need a walker!" ex
claimed one caller when informed that she
would be sent a walking escort instead of a golf
cart.
A lot of students cancelled their calls when
they were told that they would receive a walk
er, but a few did ask for escorts. The 5-SURE
employees see this is a good indication that the
riders generally feel safe on campus after dark.
