Kittens Missing
$50 Reward
The Stanford Cat Network is searching for a litter of
very young kittens who were orphaned when their
mother was killed attempting to cross Campus Drive
near Galvez two weeks ago. They are believed to be in
the area of Chemistry, Cantor Art Museum or the old
Human Anatomy building, between Campus Dr. and
Lomita Dr. Please call (650) 255-1547 if you see or hear
any sign of them or know they have been rescued. Time
is quickly running out for them to survive on their own.
The Stanford Cat Network is a volunteer non-profit organization supporting a
spay/neuter, feeding and adoption program for homeless cats at Stanford - by
agreement with, but not funded by Stanford University.
