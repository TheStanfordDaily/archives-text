■ Wilde, "means simply the
J bludgeoning of the people, by
the people, for the people." And there's
nothing like two painful years of presiden
tial campaign coverage to make you feel
bludgeoned. Though I do care about who
becomes our next president, I sometimes
long for the days before the CNN news
ticker.
Spin, hype and the quest for ratings
have made political contests into a freak
ish reality show. Just like The Real World,
stupid "unscripted" plot lines, bimbo-ish
preening and nonexistent clashes are
thrown in our faces and called a national
debate. Sure, scandalous stories (true or
not) have been used to sell newspapers
since the birth of the medium. But with the
explosion of the 24-hour TV news cycle
and the increased pressure of online
media, the focus is on news that sells. And
— surprise — crap sells.
I still read the comics, a procrastination
technique I've maintained since about the
third grade, and one of the best critics of
the mainstream media (MSM) today is the
cartoonist Darrin Bell, who writes the strip
Candorville. In last Sunday's comic, a sad
looking man is walking down the street
followed by a cheerful stand-in for the
mainstream media. The sad man tells his
plight panel by panel: he's lost his job, his
home, a child in Iraq,and has no health in
surance. At each despairing comment, the
MSM whispers in his ear, "Obama's scary
black pastor." By the end. despite his other
woes, the sad man is hypnotized by the re
frain.
The sensational and dumbed-down na
ture of news reporting and national poli
tics is not just hurting our chances of hav
ing a real national dialogue — though it
does make it harder for issues like health
care to be honestly debated. For politi
cians. the fear of how they could be por
trayed in sensational headlines or victim
ized by pundits and opposing candidates
has crippled their ability to make good
policy.
"In order to maintain their popularity,
politicians cannot afford to prescribe 'bit
ter medicine.'" explained Stanford Com
munication Professor Shanto Iyengar in a
2(X)ft interview with the Washington Post.
"Policy is adopted not on the merits,but on
the basis of'does it sell?' Pandering to pub
lic opinion replaces leadership as the
modus operandi of government."
For two easy examples of how pander
ing has replaced leadership, consider the
issues of illegal drugs and food subsidies.
The U.S. government has spent billions of
dollars on military drug interdiction oper
ations in places like Colombia and

Though I care who

president, I long for

Ecuador, has an entire department (the
Drug Enforcement Administration) fo
cused on the topic, and the country spends
countless more money on drug enforce
ment at state and local levels. But, as most
people know, the problem is not evil drug
lords trying to force their product on the
United States.The drug lords are certainly
not acting with our best interests in mind,
but they are simply responding to the eco
nomic demand the United States creates.
While countries like Mexico suffer —
hundreds of their federal police have been
killed battling the drug lords supplying the
U.S. — we waste money stopping boats
and burning cocoa fields. And legalizing
drugs isn't the only solution. A study by the
RAND Corporation which was commis
sioned by the White House and the Army
found that local drug treatment programs
in the United States are ten times more ef
fective per dollar at reducing drug use.
But no one wants to be the senator or
congressman who votes to stop funding
the war on drugs. You can imagine the at
tack ads in the next campaign: "Senator
Jones voted to stop trying to protect your
kids from drugs. Is this who you want as
your senator?"
The same is true of farm subsidies. De
spite commodity prices being at an all
time high. Congress could not pass a farm
bill that reduced automatic subsidy pay
ments to farmers already making more
than $700,000. Instead, for the first time.
Congress overrode a Bush veto, and much

was said about "growing American" and
protecting farmers (especially the rich
ones who donate to campaigns). No one
wants to be the politician accused of deny
ing hardworking Americans their giant
government checks.
I don't support rampant drug use, and I
don't hate American farmers. But at a time
when bridges are falling down, food prices
are up and we are financing our debt with
help from China and dictatorial oil states,
I'd just prefer to stop wasting my tax
money.
Winston Churchill is famous for
terming democracy "the worst form of
government, except for all the other ones
that have been tried." Fear of being torn
apart by Fox News pundits or losing the
next election means our representatives
are letting us down in order to keep their
jobs. Are there any politicians left with the
moral courage to vote for the smart policy,
even if it means taking some heat?
