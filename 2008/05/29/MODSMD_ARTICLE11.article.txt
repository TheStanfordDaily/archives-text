Palestinians support a two-state solution
To the Editor:
Wednesday's Op-Ed ("Who fights for the occupation?"
May 28] misstates the issues in asserting that "For more than
15 years Israel has consistently chosen the two-state solu
tion. It is the Palestinians who are as yet undecided." The
Palestinians, along with major Arab leaders, have over
whelmingly favored a two-state solution since at least 1988.
The conflict is over how each side defines two states. The
Palestinians are willing to settle for the territory Israel cap
tured in 1967, the West Bank, Gaza and Arab East
Jerusalem.This amounts to 22 percent of original Palestinian
territory and is in accordance with UN Security Council
Resolutions 224 and 338.
Israel has steadfastly opposed such a solution and insists on
retaining the large settlement blocs that lie on the West Bank's
main water aquifers, and the Jordan Valley, as well as the Jew
ish-only highway system that connects the settlements to
Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Israel has been rapidly building more
settlement housing both in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,
so that today 400,(X)0 Israelis live on land the Palestinians
hoped would be part of a Palestinian state. What the Israelis
envision is a Palestinian "mini-state" on the West Bank consist
ing of isolated chunks of territory, surrounded by Israeli settle
ments and roads and with no control over its borders or access
to water. Israel can have a two-state solution or retain the set
tlements, but not both.
