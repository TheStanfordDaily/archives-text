## Peterson Lab undergoes renovation 
### ALAN GUO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the summer approaching, construction projects
are gearing up on campus, including those at the School
of Engineering Building 550 — the Peterson Lab —
which will get its first facelift in almost 50 years.
The Peterson Lab was previously home to several
materials science laboratories, the Center for Integrated
Facility of Engineering (CIFE) and the Global Climate
and Energy Program (GCEP).
After the renovation effort, the new occupants of the
building will include the Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design (nicknamed "D. School") and the Design
Division of mechanical engineering.
The renovation effort will take just over a year.
"The reason [for the renovation] is that the building
has not had any major renovation since the 605," said
Brian Carilli, associate director of facilities and plan
ning at the School of Engineering, who is overseeing the
renovation effort. "Most of the infrastructure of the
building is still pre-1%0."
The building has a long history on campus. It was
first built in 1907. serving in part as a horse stable.
Stanford hopes to preserve the building's historical ele
ments in its redesign.
"We will keep the sandstones and windows to make
sure the building remains historic," Carilli said.
But the building will get a modern twist to keep it in
line with current environmental standards.
"Part of it is also consistent with our sustainability
goals," said Carilli. pointing out the green initiative in
this project. "We will try to recycle the material [torn
down from the interior] as much as possible."
The previous occupants of the building have all been
relocated to new buildings. Materials science laborato
ries have been moved to Durand, while CIFE and
GCEP have been moved to Y2E2.
The relocation efforts also aim to achieve greater
integration within each department.
"Moving materials science laboratories to Durand
makes sense because the majority of materials science is
in McCullough and Moore, which is right beside
Durand," said Carilli.
In the same vein, the design division of mechanical
engineering will be centered at Building 550. with hopes
of achieving greater integration within the mechanical
engineering department, which hovers around the
Panama Mall.
The newly renovated building will also be the per

manent home to the D. School, which has been relocat
ed twice in the past three years in its effort of expan
sion. The close ties between the Design Division of
mechanical engineering and the D. School may also
prompt the designation of the building to the two occu
pants after the renovation.
Professor Bernard Roth, a faculty in the Design

Division of mechanical engineering, thought the reno
vation was much-needed.
"The renovation is necessary since the building has a
lot of wrongs with it and is not suitable for the new ten
ants," he said.

The stone facade of the future Munger Graduate housing residence was nearly complete Wednesday afternoon. The
Munger residence, whose construction continues to progress, will house members of the graduate community.
