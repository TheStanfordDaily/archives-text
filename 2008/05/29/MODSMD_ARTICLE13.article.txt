### JULIANNE STERN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted unani
mously Wednesday night to confirm the appointment
of Matt McLaughlin "08 to the post of ASSU Financial
Manager.
As Financial Manager, McLaughlin will oversee the
ASSU's assets, investments and liabilities, and will act
as chief executive officer of Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE), an organization of seven business
enterprises whose profits provide funds for the ASSU.
McLaughlin was selected by a committee composed of
representatives from the GSC, the ASSU and SSE.
Prior to his appointment, McLaughlin served as
chief operating officer of SSE, and he said he had been
training for the past six months under outgoing finan
cial manager Matt McDonald "05.
McLaughlin said his priorities as financial manager
will include moving print advertising ventures toward
online advertising,expanding the Unofficial Guide and
potentially extending it to other universities and
improving student groups' access to financial planning
information.
The GSC also unanimously approved its first fund
ing request for the next academic year. The council
granted $1,600 to the Christians in Medicine
Fellowship to support a series of quarterly seminars for
students and faculty in the medical community.
A representative for the Fellowship said that the
seminars would serve as an opportunity for medical
students and Stanford Hospital employees to discuss
their experiences in the field of medicine. Although
about three quarters of this year's attendees were reli
gious. he said, the meetings were open to all.
The GSC also discussed upcoming events for the
graduate community. Financial Officer Nanna
Notthoff described last Friday's Grad Night at the 750
Pub as a relative success.
While the event brought a much larger than average
crowd to the 750, the grad students present failed to
finish the free keg provided by the GSC. Grad nights
will continue for the next two Fridays and will take
place from 9-11 p.m.
The GSC is also sponsoring a block party this
Friday at the Willis courtyard in Rains, with a barbeque
from 6-9 p.m. and a dance party from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Hie event will feature live music.
