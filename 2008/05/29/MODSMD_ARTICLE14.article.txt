## SAILING FINISHES STRONG Lady sailors compete at the ISCA's, finish fourth overall 
### SARAH OHR 
The Stanford women's sailing team has
concluded their first event at the Intercolle
giate Sailing Association's National Cham
pionships in Newport, R.I. The team
wrapped up the third and final day of sailing
with a respectable fourth place finish in the
ICSA Women's Championship. The field
consisted of 18 top-tier teams from around
the country, with Boston College taking
home the crown.
Only six teams can say they qualified for all
three of the national events: the Women's
Championship, the Team Racing Champi
onship and the Coed Dinghy Championship;
the No. 13 Cardinal is among them.This is only
the team's second time qualifying in all three
events during head coach Jay Kehoe's tenure
at Stanford.

The women's team was ranked fourth
going into the competition and came out as
just that. Leading the Cardinal in its fight was
the A-team of senior All-American Evan
Brown, junior Ail-American Kelly McKenna
and freshman Hannah Burroughs, which
placed third. The Brown and McKenna pair
made up the A-team last year as well, when the
Cardinal placed a respectable third at nation
als.
"This year's fleet was more competitive
and the conditions were tougher, and we are
still very proud of placing third again,"
McKenna said.
The B-team consisted of junior Taylor
Grimes and senior Sarah Schoknecht.
After the first day of racing, the Cardinal was
not where it had hoped to be. Facing tough
weather conditions and a disqualification for a
complicated foul, the women found them
selves in ninth place at the conclusion of day
one.
Day two brought more wind, but the
women were tough and fought their way to a
fifth place standing. Going into the final day,
the Cardinal jumped even further. The team
sat outside the top five for the majority of the

event, hut improved to fourth on the regatta.
"I'm extremely proud of how the girls bat
tled back from a [disqualification] and a cap
size to climb back to fourth place in the regat
ta," coach Kehoe told GoStanford.com after
the competition. "That kind of comeback is
unheard of and shows the strength of this
team."

Brown, one of the Cardinal's two graduat
ing seniors, was named as a women's Ail-
American skipper for the second consecutive
year, after being named an honorable mention
her sophomore year.
"I don't think there's much we could have
done better," McKenna said. "Coming back
from 9th is extremely difficult in events like
this. It's much easier to lose hope after a rough
day and we really came together as a team.
"Both divisions fought hard to climb back
to the top. It's really a good feeling to come to
gether as a team like that at the end of a long
season."
Next up for the Cardinal is the three-day
ICSA/APS Team Racing National Champi
onship, which kicks off on May 30. The Cardi
nal looks to carry the momentum through this
team event and then into the ICSA Coed
Dinghy Championship.
The two final events take place May 30-
June 1 and June 2-4, respectively. Next year,
Stanford will be hosting the 2009 ICSA
Women's and Dinghy Nationals at the St.
Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco.
