## Celtics one step closer to Finals 
### JIMMY GOLEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Ray Allen found his shooting touch just
in time to put the Boston Celtics within one
win of returning to the NBA finals for the
first time since the original Big Three.
Allen scored 29, hitting a long 2-pointer
after Detroit came within one point with a
minute left, then he and Kevin Garnett each
made a pair of free throws down the stretch
as the Celtics beat the Detroit Pistons 106-
102 on Wednesday night to take a 3-2 lead in
the Eastern Conference finals.
Garnett scored 33 — his most in the play
offs this year — Kendrick Perkins had 18
points and 16 rebounds, and Rajon Rondo
added seven points, 13 assists and six re
bounds for Boston. The 29 points was also a
playoff high for Allen, the usually reliable
scorer who had been cold for most of the
playoffs.
Game 6 is Friday in Detroit, and with a
victory there or on Sunday back in Boston,
the Celtics would advance to the NBA finals
for the first time since Larry Bird, Kevin
McHale and Robert Parish took them there
in 1987.
Chauncey Billups scored 26 and Richard
Hamilton had 25 points for Detroit, which
has reached the conference finals six con
secutive years but played for the champi
onship just twice and won once in that span.
Billups twice drove to the basket in the
final 10 seconds, hoping for a foul that was
n't there. He also missed an inconsequential
3-pointer at the buzzer.

Boston led by as many as 17 in the third
quarter, but Hamilton scored 13 points dur
ing a 21-8 Detroit run that made it 92-88
with 4:46 left.
Boston led 100-96 before Rodney Stuck
ey hit a 3-pointer with 1:22 left. But, after a
timeout with 6 seconds left on the shot
clock, Allen took the inbounds pass and put
up a jumper to give Boston a three-point
lead.
Billups tried an off-balance layup that
missed, but in the fight for the rebound the
Celtics tipped it out of bounds. Billups drove
again, putting it harmlessly off the front of
the rim.
The Celtics ran down the 24-second clock
before Garnett was forced to take an off
balance jumper. Rondo fouled Stuckey, and
he hit both free throws to make it 102-101
with 8.2 seconds left.
Allen matched them, then Rondo again
wrapped up Stuckey. But this time the rook
ie missed the first,giving the Boston Garden
crowd a reason to erupt.
Garnett hit a pair of free throws to clinch it.
The Celtics earned home-court advan
tage with an NBA-best 66-16 record in the
regular season, but the Pistons took it away
with a victory in Boston in Game 2. The
Celtics swiped it back with a split in Detroit,
and now have two chances to clinch - includ
ing a potential seventh game at home.
Detroit trailed 23-20 in the final minute
of the first quarter before scoring 13 of the
next 15 points. Detroit still led 42-36 with
five minutes left in the second
when Boston scored 11 in a row,
getting back-to-back 3-pointers
from Paul Pierce and Allen to take
the lead for good.
Garnett added a fallaway 3-
point bank shot at the 24-second
clock buzzer — just his second 3
pointer of the season — to give
Boston a 50-43 lead with 1:23 left
in the half. Perkins had two of the
first three baskets in the second
half to extend the lead to 11 points.
Allen added consecutive 3-
pointers midway through the third
to turn an eight-point game to a
14-point lead.
