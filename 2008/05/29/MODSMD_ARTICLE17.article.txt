# A
						year of Stanford sports

### 
This hasn't been the most dom
inant year for Stanford Ath
letics, but it certainly has been
one to remember.
Whether it wasTavita Pritchard's
fourth-and-goal toss to Mark Brad
ford which upset 41-point favorite
USC back in October, Brook
Lopez's off-balance shot in the wan
ing seconds against Marquette or
Candice Wiggins' inspiring perform
ance throughout the NCAA Tourna
ment in the team's trip to the cham
pionship game, there has been a lot
to remember this year. And let's not
forget the result of the Big Game
after all, as the Cardinal took down
Cal for the first time in six years.
It's also been a year of startling
change, in case you haven't been pay
ing attention. Coach Jim Harbaugh,
an enthusiastic and viable choice to
lead the football program, came in
and immediately showed that the
new Stanford program would "bow
to no man." While Harbaugh still
only won four games on the year, the
squad showed clear improvement
and got two big wins over its to
biggest opponents: the Trojans and
the Golden Bears. The men's basket
ball program also underwent vast
change, except there was more of an
exodus instead of a genesis.
With the departure of mainstays
like coach Trent Johnson, former
coach Mike Montgomery (who had
previously been working in the
Media Relations department at
Stanford), Fred Washington, Taj Fin
ger, and none other than the Lopez
twins, the current state of the men's
basketball team can be described in
one word: transition.
That said, new head coach Johnny
Dawkins appears to be a good fit,
and would make for the second solid
hire in the third year of Bob Bowls
by's tenure on the Farm. Ripe with a
decade of assistant-coach experience
under Duke's Coach K, maybe the
most respected coach in all of college
basketball, Dawkins — down-to
earth, fundamental and hard-work -
ing — may be just the guy to lead a
Stanford program which deals with
tougher recruiting standards than
most major schools. We'll obviously
find out next year and in the coming
years, but I think there was a reason
that Bowlsby took over a month to
make his decision: he was waiting for
the ideal candidate. Hopefully he's
right.
It's also been a year of near-miss
es. Women's volleyball tore through
the NCAA Tournament field before
falling short against Penn State in the
national championship game. Like
wise, the women's basketball team
shot the lights out during the NCAA
Tournament before succumbing to
the pressure of the Tennessee Volun
teers in the final game. Women's
water polo fell in the national semifi
nals, while, despite being ranked No.
1 going into the NCAA Champi
onships, the men's gymnastics team
ended up finishing in second place
nationally by two one-hundredths of
a point.
The only team to come through
and bring home a national title (thus
far, at least) was the women's cross
country team. Led by a slew of sen
iors, the Cardinal had no trouble get
ting over the hump to earn Stan
ford's 95th NCAA championship.
Near-misses, coaches and players
leaving, and everything else aside, it's
been a year that many will not forget,
especially this sophomore.
My first year on the Farm may have
been the worst in the history of the
three main sports: men's basketball,
baseball and football. Men's basket
ball had a mediocre season before
being embarrassed in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament, baseball
had its worst season in years, as did
football (the Walt Harris era seems
eons ago, though it was just last year).
All three showed considerable
improvement this year, and baseball
still has a chance to make a run at
Omaha and the College World Series
as Regionals start this weekend. In
any case, this year has been much
better than last year for Stanford
fans.
