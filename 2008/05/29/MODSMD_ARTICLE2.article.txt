# Defense research still controversial
## Open research policy complicates defense funding 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Since 1969, Department of Defense spon
sored research at Stanford has been required to
comply with a University-wide "no secrecy"
policy banning research on classified projects.
While this regulation has not hindered Stanford
researchers from receiving defense funding, it
has complicated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War. as stu
dents and faculty alike began to question
Stanford's involvement with the defense estab
lishment. the Faculty Senate approved policies
aimed at limiting the presence of the military on
campus. The Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) was expelled from campus, and
University researchers were forbidden to
accept federal funding for classified projects
following the implementation of the Openness
in Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classified
research, funding from the Department of
Defense continues to pour into campus, largely
for research in non-military areas such as med
icine, earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research, in the
2006-2007 academic year, the University
received $59,160,146 in research tunding from
the Department of Defense, approximately 6.4
percent of the University's total federal funding
for sponsored research. In 1991, following the
end of the Cold War. research funding from the
Department of Defense constituted roughly
$40 million or 16 percent of the University's
$240 million total federal research funding.
The Army High-Performance Computing
Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy played a
central role in the Committee on Research's
recent evaluation of the University's contract
with the Army for a $105 million computing
research program. The Army High-
Performance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in December
2007, is being funded by the Department of
Defense in hopes that researchers will develop
advanced simulation software that may lead to

advances in battlefield communication, protec
tion and sensor capabilities.
"[AHPCRC] research may subsequently
lead to classified research at Army research
labs, but this is not part of the research project,"
said Civil Engineering Prof. Steve Monismith,
chair of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an investigation
into this matter after 60 faculty members peti
tioned for the committee to examine whether
the AHPCRC conflicted with the University's
no secrecy policy At the committee's annual
public meeting on May 22, Monismith present
ed the committee's findings on its investigation.
According to Monismith, the committee found
that the AHPCRC was in full compliance with
University standards. He added that the com
mittee did not investigate the ethical concerns
of faculty members, but looked only for policy
violations.
"[The committee] only looked at the ques
tion of compliance." Monismith said. "We didn't
look at the issue of whether military research is
appropriate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling in the
program's favor, the AHPCRC will remain on
campus and serve as the headquarters of a
nationwide consortium of researchers at
Stanford, Morgan State University in
Maryland, New Mexico State University, the
University of Texas at El Paso and the NASA
Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AHPCRC met
the requirements of the University's open
research policies, Monismith said, the commit
tee examined four particular areas of concern
â€” whether classified research would take place
at the AHPCRC, if the center would contain
classified materials, if special security clearance
would be needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative Agreement
Manager [CAM] could interfere with the aca
demic freedom of researchers. After investigat
ing the Army's program proposal, the commit
tee ruled that classified research and materials
would have no place in the AHPCRC.
Furthermore, researchers would be allowed to
