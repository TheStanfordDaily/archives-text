# Defense research still controversial
## Open research policy complicates defense funding 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Since 1969, Department of Defense spon
sored research at Stanford has been required to
comply with a University-wide "no secrecy"
policy banning research on classified projects.
While this regulation has not hindered Stanford
researchers from receiving defense funding, it
has complicated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War. as stu
dents and faculty alike began to question
Stanford's involvement with the defense estab
lishment. the Faculty Senate approved policies
aimed at limiting the presence of the military on
campus. The Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) was expelled from campus, and
University researchers were forbidden to
accept federal funding for classified projects
following the implementation of the Openness
in Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classified
research, funding from the Department of
Defense continues to pour into campus, largely
for research in non-military areas such as med
icine, earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research, in the
2006-2007 academic year, the University
received $59,160,146 in research tunding from
the Department of Defense, approximately 6.4
percent of the University's total federal funding
for sponsored research. In 1991, following the
end of the Cold War. research funding from the
Department of Defense constituted roughly
$40 million or 16 percent of the University's
$240 million total federal research funding.
The Army High-Performance Computing
Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy played a
central role in the Committee on Research's
recent evaluation of the University's contract
with the Army for a $105 million computing
research program. The Army High-
Performance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in December
2007, is being funded by the Department of
Defense in hopes that researchers will develop
advanced simulation software that may lead to

advances in battlefield communication, protec
tion and sensor capabilities.
"[AHPCRC] research may subsequently
lead to classified research at Army research
labs, but this is not part of the research project,"
said Civil Engineering Prof. Steve Monismith,
chair of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an investigation
into this matter after 60 faculty members peti
tioned for the committee to examine whether
the AHPCRC conflicted with the University's
no secrecy policy At the committee's annual
public meeting on May 22, Monismith present
ed the committee's findings on its investigation.
According to Monismith, the committee found
that the AHPCRC was in full compliance with
University standards. He added that the com
mittee did not investigate the ethical concerns
of faculty members, but looked only for policy
violations.
"[The committee] only looked at the ques
tion of compliance." Monismith said. "We didn't
look at the issue of whether military research is
appropriate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling in the
program's favor, the AHPCRC will remain on
campus and serve as the headquarters of a
nationwide consortium of researchers at
Stanford, Morgan State University in
Maryland, New Mexico State University, the
University of Texas at El Paso and the NASA
Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AHPCRC met
the requirements of the University's open
research policies, Monismith said, the commit
tee examined four particular areas of concern
— whether classified research would take place
at the AHPCRC, if the center would contain
classified materials, if special security clearance
would be needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative Agreement
Manager [CAM] could interfere with the aca
demic freedom of researchers. After investigat
ing the Army's program proposal, the commit
tee ruled that classified research and materials
would have no place in the AHPCRC.
Furthermore, researchers would be allowed to
pursue their own research agendas
without direct interference from the
CAM.
"The legitimate question is does
that interfere with academic free
dom, the basic right of investigators
to pick their own research,"
Monismith said.
But even if the AHPC'RC is in
compliance with University regula
tions, other faculty members worried
that the program will serve as a route
through which Stanford research
could end up in Army research sta
tions.
At the public presentation of the
committee's findings. Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth
voiced his concerns that open
research conducted in the
AHPCRC could eventually lead to
classified Army projects and opera
tions. Roth expressed skepticism
over the committee's findings and

questioned whether the program is
really in compliance with openness
standards.
"We are told that all of these trou
bling issues have been resolved to
bring the agreement into conformity
with Stanford's rules," Roth wrote in
an email to The Daily. "Neither the
principle investigator nor the
University will make the agreement
or the proposal public."
Monismith pointed out that there
are still issues surrounding the pro
gram which have yet to be resolved.
In particular, Monismith worried
about the Army's use of the term
"sensitive" to describe some research
in place of "classified." He claimed
that the committee is currently work
ing to convince the Department of
Defense that "there is no such thing
as sensitive research — it's either
classified or not."
And while all Stanford
researchers will have equal access to
technologies, special security checks
will need to be made for researchers
of foreign citizenship status hoping to
gain access to NASA computers, with
Iranian and Chinese citizens particu

larly at risk of being blocked. In this
situation, blocked researchers will be
given access to what Monismith
referred to as "separate but equal"
computing facilities within the pro
gram.
In his presentation, Monismith
acknowledged that Stanford and the
Army had to rework plans for the
program before the AHPCRC could
meet the disclosure requirements of
the Openness in Research Policy.
"The Stanford consortium pushed
this in a way that the Army did not
want to go," Monismith said. "The
original plans for the center would
not have been acccptable at
Stanford."
The Ethics of Defense Research
While Monismith presented the
Committee on Research's positive
findings on the AHPCRC, he also
expressed disappointment that "in
the Faculty Senate, there wasn't more
discussing about the larger issues" of
Department of Defense research on
the Stanford campus.
According to Dean of Research
Ann Arvin, accepting federal funding

for research from the Department of
Defense does not entail thinking
about the research differently than if
the funding was from any other
organization.
"Considerations about openness
in research, faculty direction of
research and student participation
are part of the evaluation of all spon
sored research agreements, not
specifically defense department
sources," Arvin wrote in an email to
The Daily
But Roth's experiences and
observations through the course of
his career have led him to regard
defense research as generally more
problematic and ethically discon
certing than other forms of research,
so much so that he avoids research
funding from defense sources as a
matter of principle.
"My impression is that most of it
works in a manner fairly similar to
other funding sources," Roth said,
"except that it skews the research
direction into certain areas and influ
ences career choices into certain
areas."
Roth believes defense research

should be examined by the Faculty
Senate — much in the way spon
sored research from the tobacco
industry was examined in 2007.
"1 think there are moral and ethi
cal issues involved in military
research," he said. "The Faculty
Senate and University community
should undertake a discussion of
these questions."
Throughout the course of
Monismith's career, the amount of
research funds he has received from
the Office of Naval Research has
varied, but at its highest levels it com
prised 40 percent of his total funding
for research. The Office of Naval
Research currently is considering a
proposal of his which, if accepted,
would provide him with funding to
conduct oceanographic research in
the Florida Straight. This project, like
others for which he has received
defense funding, has no explicit mili
tary implications, but may help
defense researchers with their own
projects in the future.
"(With) the appropriation for
basic research, it's kind of hard to see
exactly how it's going to figure in

defense research," Monismith said. "I
don't really know what they're going
to do with it."
Monismith said that this kind of
"dual use" research — whose find
ings could potentially lead to
advances in both academic and
defense projects — characterizes
much of the research being lunded
by the Department of Defense at
Stanford and other universities.
While they may disagree on cer
tain areas of defense research,
Monismith, Arvin and Roth all
agreed on one thing — that
Stanford's Openness in Research
Policy has been beneficial to the aca
demic freedom of the University as a
whole.
"The University is part of a world
wide system of scholarship that
thrives on people building on previ
ous work and contributing to subse
quent scholarship," Roth said.
"Secrecy breaks this chain, and is
dysfunctional and counterproduc
tive."

could end up in Army research sta
tions.
At the public presentation of the
committee's findings. Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth
voiced his concerns that open
research conducted in the
AHPCRC could eventually lead to
classified Army projects and opera
tions. Roth expressed skepticism
over the committee's findings and

questioned whether the program is
really in compliance with openness
standards.
"We are told that all of these trou
bling issues have been resolved to
bring the agreement into conformity
with Stanford's rules," Roth wrote in
an email to The Daily. "Neither the
principle investigator nor the
University will make the agreement
or the proposal public."
Monismith pointed out that there
are still issues surrounding the pro
gram which have yet to be resolved.
In particular, Monismith worried
about the Army's use of the term
"sensitive" to describe some research
in place of "classified." He claimed
that the committee is currently work
ing to convince the Department of
Defense that "there is no such thing
as sensitive research — it's either
classified or not."
And while all Stanford
researchers will have equal access to
technologies, special security checks
will need to be made for researchers
of foreign citizenship status hoping to
gain access to NASA computers, with
Iranian and Chinese citizens particu

larly at risk of being blocked. In this
situation, blocked researchers will be
given access to what Monismith
referred to as "separate but equal"
computing facilities within the pro
gram.
In his presentation, Monismith
acknowledged that Stanford and the
Army had to rework plans for the
program before the AHPCRC could
meet the disclosure requirements of
the Openness in Research Policy.
"The Stanford consortium pushed
this in a way that the Army did not
want to go," Monismith said. "The
original plans for the center would
not have been acccptable at
Stanford."
The Ethics of Defense Research
While Monismith presented the
Committee on Research's positive
findings on the AHPCRC, he also
expressed disappointment that "in
the Faculty Senate, there wasn't more
discussing about the larger issues" of
Department of Defense research on
the Stanford campus.
According to Dean of Research
Ann Arvin, accepting federal funding

for research from the Department of
Defense does not entail thinking
about the research differently than if
the funding was from any other
organization.
"Considerations about openness
in research, faculty direction of
research and student participation
are part of the evaluation of all spon
sored research agreements, not
specifically defense department
sources," Arvin wrote in an email to
The Daily
But Roth's experiences and
observations through the course of
his career have led him to regard
defense research as generally more
problematic and ethically discon
certing than other forms of research,
so much so that he avoids research
funding from defense sources as a
matter of principle.
"My impression is that most of it
works in a manner fairly similar to
other funding sources," Roth said,
"except that it skews the research
direction into certain areas and influ
ences career choices into certain
areas."
Roth believes defense research

should be examined by the Faculty
Senate — much in the way spon
sored research from the tobacco
industry was examined in 2007.
"1 think there are moral and ethi
cal issues involved in military
research," he said. "The Faculty
Senate and University community
should undertake a discussion of
these questions."
Throughout the course of
Monismith's career, the amount of
research funds he has received from
the Office of Naval Research has
varied, but at its highest levels it com
prised 40 percent of his total funding
for research. The Office of Naval
Research currently is considering a
proposal of his which, if accepted,
would provide him with funding to
conduct oceanographic research in
the Florida Straight. This project, like
others for which he has received
defense funding, has no explicit mili
tary implications, but may help
defense researchers with their own
projects in the future.
"(With) the appropriation for
basic research, it's kind of hard to see
exactly how it's going to figure in

defense research," Monismith said. "I
don't really know what they're going
to do with it."
Monismith said that this kind of
"dual use" research — whose find
ings could potentially lead to
advances in both academic and
defense projects — characterizes
much of the research being lunded
by the Department of Defense at
Stanford and other universities.
While they may disagree on cer
tain areas of defense research,
Monismith, Arvin and Roth all
agreed on one thing — that
Stanford's Openness in Research
Policy has been beneficial to the aca
demic freedom of the University as a
whole.
"The University is part of a world
wide system of scholarship that
thrives on people building on previ
ous work and contributing to subse
quent scholarship," Roth said.
"Secrecy breaks this chain, and is
dysfunctional and counterproduc
tive."

Since 1969, Department of Defense spon
sored research at Stanford has been required to
comply with a University-wide "no secrecy"
policy banning research on classified projects.
While this regulation has not hindered Stanford
researchers from receiving defense funding, it
has complicated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War. as stu
dents and faculty alike began to question
Stanford's involvement with the defense estab
lishment. the Faculty Senate approved policies
aimed at limiting the presence of the military on
campus. The Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) was expelled from campus, and
University researchers were forbidden to
accept federal funding for classified projects
following the implementation of the Openness
in Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classified
research, funding from the Department of
Defense continues to pour into campus, largely
for research in non-military areas such as med
icine, earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research, in the
2006-2007 academic year, the University
received $59,160,146 in research tunding from
the Department of Defense, approximately 6.4
percent of the University's total federal funding
for sponsored research. In 1991, following the
end of the Cold War. research funding from the
Department of Defense constituted roughly
$40 million or 16 percent of the University's
$240 million total federal research funding.
The Army High-Performance Computing
Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy played a
central role in the Committee on Research's
recent evaluation of the University's contract
with the Army for a $105 million computing
research program. The Army High-
Performance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in December
2007, is being funded by the Department of
Defense in hopes that researchers will develop
advanced simulation software that may lead to

advances in battlefield communication, protec
tion and sensor capabilities.
"[AHPCRC] research may subsequently
lead to classified research at Army research
labs, but this is not part of the research project,"
said Civil Engineering Prof. Steve Monismith,
chair of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an investigation
into this matter after 60 faculty members peti
tioned for the committee to examine whether
the AHPCRC conflicted with the University's
no secrecy policy At the committee's annual
public meeting on May 22, Monismith present
ed the committee's findings on its investigation.
According to Monismith, the committee found
that the AHPCRC was in full compliance with
University standards. He added that the com
mittee did not investigate the ethical concerns
of faculty members, but looked only for policy
violations.
"[The committee] only looked at the ques
tion of compliance." Monismith said. "We didn't
look at the issue of whether military research is
appropriate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling in the
program's favor, the AHPCRC will remain on
campus and serve as the headquarters of a
nationwide consortium of researchers at
Stanford, Morgan State University in
Maryland, New Mexico State University, the
University of Texas at El Paso and the NASA
Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AHPCRC met
the requirements of the University's open
research policies, Monismith said, the commit
tee examined four particular areas of concern
— whether classified research would take place
at the AHPCRC, if the center would contain
classified materials, if special security clearance
would be needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative Agreement
Manager [CAM] could interfere with the aca
demic freedom of researchers. After investigat
ing the Army's program proposal, the commit
tee ruled that classified research and materials
would have no place in the AHPCRC.
Furthermore, researchers would be allowed to
pursue their own research agendas
without direct interference from the
CAM.
"The legitimate question is does
that interfere with academic free
dom, the basic right of investigators
to pick their own research,"
Monismith said.
But even if the AHPC'RC is in
compliance with University regula
tions, other faculty members worried
that the program will serve as a route
through which Stanford research
could end up in Army research sta
tions.
At the public presentation of the
committee's findings. Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth
