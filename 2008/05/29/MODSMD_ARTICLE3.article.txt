## Janitor strike comes to an end Contractor agrees to raise wages 85 cents the first year 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DESK EDITOR 
The workers' five-year contract ended
April 30, after which they began asking the
contractor for higher wages and more
comprehensive health insurance.
Garcia told Hie Daily that ABM broke
the stalemate in negotiations Wednesday
by offering the workers a raise of 85 cents
for the first year of the contract. I le called
the move acceptable, even though the
striking workers were asking for a raise of
90 cents to a dollar.
"We were asking for more," he said,
"but this is much better than what they
were offering us before."
ABM's initial offer was a five-year con
tract with a wage increase of 10 cents per
year.
After a similar strike by workers at
Google's Mountain View campus earlier
this month, Google stepped in to supple
ment worker salaries. But in a statement
that was passed on to The Daily earlier
yesterday, Stanford's Executive Director
of Human Resources Diane Peck said the

Stanford janitors ended their week
long strike yesterday after their contractor
— ABM Janitorial Services — gave in to
demands for higher wages.
The sound of chanting University jani
tors has lingered over campus since nearly
100 workers went on strike on May 21, but
according to Stanford Labor Action
Coalition member Ernesto Garcia, the
workers ended their strike Wednesday
afternoon after a final police-escorted
demonstration and a budge in negotiations
with their contractor.
The workers went on strike last week
after reaching a stalemate in negotiations
with ABM regarding new labor contracts.

University's living wage policy applies
only to employees and not workers sup
plied by outside contractors, and that the
I Jniversity would not enter into the nego
tiations.
"We respect the collective bargaining
process between employers and the unions
that represent their employees and do not
feel it is appropriate for us to intervene in
those negotiations," Peck said in the state
ment. "Stanford has a living wage policy
that applies to all of its employees. It does
not, however, apply to workers who are
not directly employed by the University
and are covered under the collective bar
gaining agreements of outside companies,
such as workers employed by ABM."
Garcia said that, although workers plan
to return to work today, they will continue
negotiating with ABM for increased bene
fits.

Striking janitors marched down Santa Teresa Tuesday afternoon in protest of their contractor, ABM Janitorial Service. One day later,
ABM agreed to the janitors' demands that a substantial increase in wages be included in their next contract.
