# TWO-SPORT TREASURE
## 
### BY ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Wopamo Osaisai of the
Stanford track and field and football
teams was born in the United States
but moved to Nigeria, where he lived
from age four to twelve.
Osaisai spent the majority of his youth racing
the other kids that lived near him in Nigeria,
realizing his speed and quickness (none of the
other kids could run away from him).
Upon returning to the United States.
Osaisai joined the track team at his middle
school, and has been running ever since,
whether on the track or on the football field.
A notable two-sport varsity athlete at
Stanford. Osaisai has made his mark on the
track, recently winning the 1 (X) meter dash at
the Pac-10 Championships two weeks ago.
Osaisai's prowess on the track paid off in
football, as he was among the fastest players
in the conference this past year. He also holds
the Stanford school record in the 100 meter
dash, with a time of 10.39 seconds, and the
Stanford indoor record in the 60 meter dash.
6.83 seconds.
He also is known for wearing socks with
the Cheshire Cat from "Alice in Wonderland"
on them during competitions.
According to Osaisai, during spring quar
ter, he wakes up, eats breakfast, attends class,
eats lunch, goes to track practice, then pre
tends to do homework until he falls asleep.
The busy senior has to divide his time
between track and football, allowing him to

maintain his peak physical condition through
out the year.
Osaisai was one of the top athletes in the
Bay Area in high school, excelling in football,
track and soccer. The highlight of Osaisai's
high school athletic career came when he won
both the 1 (X) and 200 meters at the 2(X)4 U.S.
Junior Olympics. Initially recruited to play

Senior Wopamo Osaisai is the Stanford school
record holder in the 100 m dash

football on the Farm. Osaisai chose to offer
his incredible running skills to the athletic
program as well, and immediately became a
standout sprinter for the Cardinal.
As far as his collegiate running career
goes, Osaisai claims winning Pac-lOs to be the
climax thus far, especially after placing last his
freshman year, not competing his sophomore
year and placing fourth in the event junior
year. It was an excellent way for him to finish
up his running career on campus.
After the upcoming NCAA
Championships, Osaisai will hang up his
spikes for good, only competing in football
next year as a fifth-year senior. The upcoming
Olympics are not an option the senior is con
sidering, although he might consider the
Olympics in 2012. For now, his main focus is
football, and hopefully entering the NFL
draft after completing his last season on cam

pus.
However, Osaisai is somewhat disappoint
ed with his track career thus far, although he
does see some hope for himself in the upcom
ing weeks.
"I haven't accomplished as much as 1 would
have liked to," said Osaisai. "But as long as 1
finish on top in the next two weeks, I'll be

content."
With regard to his fellow teammates,
Osaisai said that he and noted middle dis
tance runner Russell Brown "have a good
connection and chemistry."
So for one last time, Osaisai will don his
"Alice in Wonderland" Cheshire Cat socks
and spikes as he prepares to compete on the
track for the Cardinal. He will be competing
in the 100,200, and 4xloo relay this weekend
at the NCAA West Regional, hoping to qual
ify for the NCAA Championships in two
weeks.
However, if you miss him there, his fast
action can he viewed on the football field
come fall. Just keep an eye open for the
fastest man on the field.
