## Students sound-off on all-frosh vs. four-class housing MAD HOUSE 
### GEA KANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER ANDREASY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
emember when you were an incoming fresh
-1 man deciding where you wanted to live your
first year? Well, that time is almost here for
JL. V.the ProFros-turned-FoShoFros you saw
wandering around campus just a few weeks ago.
A central question to consider when making housing
decisions is: four-class or all-frosh? Each has a distinct at
mosphere, and students must assess which suits them
best. There are upsides and downsides to both options.
The upperclassmen in four-class dorms, for instance, pro
vide a natural network of "pseudo-mentors" for fresh
men. in the words of Phillip Arredondo '10.
Arredondo, who lived in Roble his freshman year,
strongly believes that freshmen benefit greatly from the
four-class residential experience.
"Freshman year is a crucible of sorts," Arredondo
said."Let's just say there are a lot of mistakes to be made,
and taking advice from various upperclassmen was defi
nitely a way to avoid lots of those mistakes. Sure, there
are peer-mentoring programs, but I think it's better when
it's more casual."
"And it's a big misconception that the upperclassmen
are just going to stick to themselves," he added. "In reali
ty, they're just all part of the family."
In fact, despite having initially ranked an all-frosh
dorm as his first choice. Arredondo said that he was "so,
so happy that that didn't come true."
"I was under the impression that living with all fresh
men would make it that was just because I was
naive," he said. "It could fie argued that living in an all
frosh dorm, you gain a sense of Stanford pride and fresh
man craziness. And while maybe that didn't hit us as
strongly in a four-class dorm. I still think there's a naivete
that comes with that mob mentality. Plus, freshman
dorms usually get very clique-y."
Stephanie Otani '11 —who lives in Junipero, an all
frosh dorm — agreed.
"I love J-Ro, but the cliques are so bad,"she said. "That's
so freshman-dorm. Sometimes I feel like I'm still in high
school."
When asked whether the all-freshman dorm experi
ence has lived up to her expectations in general, Otani
had mixed feelings.
"I wanted to get to know people in my class, and I
heard that all-frosh dorms are really tight communities,"

Sweet treats are always a delight to a Stanford
student's taste buds, providing that twist to the
usually common and bland menu offered by
the Stanford dining halls.The dining halls' mea
ger variety of desserts and sweet treats leaves
students wondering — Where can we get milkshakes,
cakes and a variety of flavors of FroYo?To satisfy any
one with a sweet tooth, many places on campus have
some sweet offerings.
The Axe & Palm (TAP) and Wilbur's Energy Zone
are located conveniently on campus. Located in the
Old Union building,TAP — which is open until 2 a.m.
for students working hard on papers and problem sets
— has milkshakes with a variety of flavors such as
vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and mint chocolate to
satisfy any milkshake lover. Looking for something
more filling? The TAP also serves dessert crepes after
6:30 p.m.To satisfy Stanford's FroYo fixation,TAP has
also added FroYo to the menu.
Energy Zone is Wilbur Dining's source for energy
drinks.smoothies and candy! Students who are prepar
ing for a midterm, writing papers and coming back
from a long day of class come here to get their boost to
get them through the rest of the day.
"I go to Energy Zone for their candy bars and sweet
smoothies," said Charlie Wang '08.
Sometimes, however, these on-campus venues just
don't cut it. Located in downtown Palo Alto, Fraiche

she said. "I have made a lot of good friends that I could
relate to because we're going through the same freshman
experience, but — and I feel like this is kind of difficult
for me to articulate — the practical side of the living ex
perience has been a lot more complicated and difficult."
"I think because freshmen are new to this college set
ting. they're testing the waters, and they haven't found a
balance in their lifestyles with regard to partying." she
added.
According to Branner Resident Fellow (RF) Nancy
Buffington. however, an all-frosh dorm can be the perfect
setting for finding this balance.
"An all-frosh dorm tends to have more staff support,
more programming and generally more going on." she
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Students interact more
with each other."
Perhaps it is Buffington's image of all-frosh dorms
that has led a majority of incoming freshmen in recent
years to rank these first on their preference forms.
"Most students I talk to enjoy and value that freshman
experience," she added.
However, there isn't enough all-frosh housing to ac
commodate all incoming freshmen who are likely to pre
fer it, according to Vice Provost John Bravman.
"In a given year, we might be short about 200 students
who wanted all-freshman housing but couldn't get it,"
Bravman said.
This shortage led in part to a housing overhaul plan
brought to the table in 2005. Among other goals, the plan
sought to increase the availability of all-frosh housing
and to "un-stuff" the campus in general — meaning that,
for example, current triples would be converted back to
doubles, and dorm seminar rooms and study spaces
would be reinstated.
Striving toward these goals would mean the conver
sion of more dorms in Wilbur and Stern Halls, for in
stance, to all-frosh housing and that of Branner. Toyon
and Lagunita Court to upper-class housing. The original
plan was revised to keep Roble four-class.
Buffington expressed regret about the proposed changes,
particularly in relation to Branner. "Branner has been an
all-frosh dorm for decades, and I'll be sad when this long
tradition ends." she said. "But I do understand some of
the reasons for the planned change."
After all, it is not the first time that longstanding cus
toms have faced transformation. The press release that
Bravman sent to The Daily in February 2005 noted:
"Branner Hall, for instance, was for decades a four-class
women's dormitory', and Wilbur Hall opened as a men's
dormitory. Change is hard. It is in and of itself neither
good nor bad."

is a popular place where students can get their FroYo
fix. Fraiche is loved for European-style homemade
yogurt and the availability of fruit and nut toppings
for reasonable prices. Fraiche's yogurt provides a
healthier alternative to ice cream, and the eatery also
has an assortment of baked goods to satisfy any pas
try lover.
According to Liliana Chan '11, "Everyone loves
sweets and it's better if they are organic and healthy."
If students aren't after health food, Gelato Classico
is a good place to get dessert after a delicious meal on
University Avenue. Gelato Classico serves up a wide
variety of gelato flavors that will definitely satisfy any
body looking for new and different flavors to try. Guar
anteed, your sweet tooth will be satisfied after having
some gelato from this place.
When asked why this place is a hit with the Stanford
students, Bryan Cauley '08 replied, "I really like the
taste and texture of gelato. It's definitely better than
ice cream!"

Thus far, the most immediate, visible
change on the housing scene will be the con-

version of Crothers, which currently houses
graduate students, to upper-class housing, which
will create 350 new beds for undergraduates
"We hope to be in there by fall 0f'09," Bravman
said.

If and when the housing plan goes through in its
entirety," We'd be erring on the other side rather than
the side we're erring on now." Bravman explained.

"We might end up with a somewhat smaller number of
students who want four-class and who we can't accom-

Cakes caters to every single cake lover. The cakes that
it serves are similar to the Japanese style Western cakes
served in cafes in Tokyo. The servings are small and a
bit pricey, hut it definitely gives its customers their sat
isfaction.
And who doesn't love pearl milk tea — also known
as bubble tea or boba — another Asian sweet treat?
Verde Tea House is located in Mountain View, and
many students drive there to satisfy a craving for pearl
milk tea. Verde offers hot milk tea and "freezes" —
similar to smoothies with tapioca pearls — in flavors
like Thai tea, peach, passion fruit and so many more.
"Boba is a great mix of a drink and chewy sweet
sensation. It gives me both caffeine and sugar," said
Katrin Larsen '11.
This is just a short list of places where students go to
satisfy any cravings they have for sweets.There are def
initely more places to try in the area. Be adventurous
;ind go satisfy your sweet tooth. Bon appetit!

modate, rather than the larger number of students
wanting all-frosh housing who we currently can't ac
commodate."
So, how far have we progressed in terms of the rest of
the plan?
"Nowhere," Bravman said. "It's years away, if ever.
This is all in the big idea stage — we're well removed
from the small detail stage. It's just a talking point for
those of us who are thinking about it — there are no de
cisions here at all."
The largest obstacle has been fundraising.
"We have to assess whether or not we can actually do
this," Bravman said. "This could easily amount to a billion
dollars, which is a lot of money. There just isn't the capac
ity right now."
This news would please Arredondo.
"I think it's foolish," he said of the plan.
Indeed, both Buffington and Bravman do agree that
all-frosh housing is not a good fit for all students.
"For some, the liveliness of an all-frosh dorm can be
overwhelming," Buffington wrote.
Bravman is on the same page.
"I have no doubt that four-class housing is the right
option for some students," he said. "[The plan] was not to
eliminate four-class housing; it was to do a better job of
meeting the demand," Bravman explained. "It was defi
nitely a reduction in the number of four-class beds, but
not an elimination. It's not an emphasis on an all-fresh
man campus — I don't want to do that, and we don't have
the space for that anyway."
Nonetheless, he still hopes that the plan will progress,
for reasons based on both initial demand and other data.
"We have done some surveying, and students in fresh
man dorms reported greatest satisfaction and also a
slightly higher GPA," he said. "That doesn't prove causa
tion by any means, but there is a suggested correlation."
Despite such data, some students do not believe that
student satisfaction with first-year housing has been ac
curately assessed.

"An exit poll would reveal a striking number of kids
who feel differently from their original choices,"
Arredondo said.
Bravman says that the administration has reached
out. but students have not been as responsive as hoped.
The senior survey response rate, for example, is at 30 per
cent.
"We have a difficult time getting student opinions," he
said. "Students say that we don't ask for their opinions,
and when we ask, they don't express their voice. It's sort
of the squeaky wheel syndrome. We try to be responsive,
but we end up responding to small groups of students or
not responding at all because we don't get their feed
back."
Regardless, Bravman noted plans to make further ef
forts to garner students' opinions.
"We are going to take more deliberate steps with the
incoming class this fall to get responses from them," he
said. "I don't know if it will have the desired effect, but we
just have to do better. 'We' meaning everybody — both
students and staff."
Meanwhile, when asked facetiously about which type
of freshman housing he personally would rank first,
Bravman — who "had a great time in Arroyo," which was
all-frosh his freshman year — said with a wry smile and a
hint of a wink, "FroSoCo, of course. You're asking the
wrong person."

emember when you were an incoming fresh
-1 man deciding where you wanted to live your
first year? Well, that time is almost here for
JL. V.the ProFros-turned-FoShoFros you saw
wandering around campus just a few weeks ago.
A central question to consider when making housing
decisions is: four-class or all-frosh? Each has a distinct at
mosphere, and students must assess which suits them
best. There are upsides and downsides to both options.
The upperclassmen in four-class dorms, for instance, pro
vide a natural network of "pseudo-mentors" for fresh
men. in the words of Phillip Arredondo '10.
Arredondo, who lived in Roble his freshman year,
strongly believes that freshmen benefit greatly from the
four-class residential experience.
"Freshman year is a crucible of sorts," Arredondo
said."Let's just say there are a lot of mistakes to be made,
and taking advice from various upperclassmen was defi
nitely a way to avoid lots of those mistakes. Sure, there
are peer-mentoring programs, but I think it's better when
it's more casual."
"And it's a big misconception that the upperclassmen
are just going to stick to themselves," he added. "In reali
ty, they're just all part of the family."
In fact, despite having initially ranked an all-frosh
dorm as his first choice. Arredondo said that he was "so,
so happy that that didn't come true."
"I was under the impression that living with all fresh
men would make it that was just because I was
naive," he said. "It could fie argued that living in an all
frosh dorm, you gain a sense of Stanford pride and fresh
man craziness. And while maybe that didn't hit us as
strongly in a four-class dorm. I still think there's a naivete
that comes with that mob mentality. Plus, freshman
dorms usually get very clique-y."
Stephanie Otani '11 —who lives in Junipero, an all
frosh dorm — agreed.
"I love J-Ro, but the cliques are so bad,"she said. "That's
so freshman-dorm. Sometimes I feel like I'm still in high
school."
When asked whether the all-freshman dorm experi
ence has lived up to her expectations in general, Otani
had mixed feelings.
"I wanted to get to know people in my class, and I
heard that all-frosh dorms are really tight communities,"

Sweet treats are always a delight to a Stanford
student's taste buds, providing that twist to the
usually common and bland menu offered by
the Stanford dining halls.The dining halls' mea
ger variety of desserts and sweet treats leaves
students wondering — Where can we get milkshakes,
cakes and a variety of flavors of FroYo?To satisfy any
one with a sweet tooth, many places on campus have
some sweet offerings.
The Axe & Palm (TAP) and Wilbur's Energy Zone
are located conveniently on campus. Located in the
Old Union building,TAP — which is open until 2 a.m.
for students working hard on papers and problem sets
— has milkshakes with a variety of flavors such as
vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and mint chocolate to
satisfy any milkshake lover. Looking for something
more filling? The TAP also serves dessert crepes after
6:30 p.m.To satisfy Stanford's FroYo fixation,TAP has
also added FroYo to the menu.
Energy Zone is Wilbur Dining's source for energy
drinks.smoothies and candy! Students who are prepar
ing for a midterm, writing papers and coming back
from a long day of class come here to get their boost to
get them through the rest of the day.
"I go to Energy Zone for their candy bars and sweet
smoothies," said Charlie Wang '08.
Sometimes, however, these on-campus venues just
don't cut it. Located in downtown Palo Alto, Fraiche

she said. "I have made a lot of good friends that I could
relate to because we're going through the same freshman
experience, but — and I feel like this is kind of difficult
for me to articulate — the practical side of the living ex
perience has been a lot more complicated and difficult."
"I think because freshmen are new to this college set
ting. they're testing the waters, and they haven't found a
balance in their lifestyles with regard to partying." she
added.
According to Branner Resident Fellow (RF) Nancy
Buffington. however, an all-frosh dorm can be the perfect
setting for finding this balance.
"An all-frosh dorm tends to have more staff support,
more programming and generally more going on." she
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Students interact more
with each other."
Perhaps it is Buffington's image of all-frosh dorms
that has led a majority of incoming freshmen in recent
years to rank these first on their preference forms.
"Most students I talk to enjoy and value that freshman
experience," she added.
However, there isn't enough all-frosh housing to ac
commodate all incoming freshmen who are likely to pre
fer it, according to Vice Provost John Bravman.
"In a given year, we might be short about 200 students
who wanted all-freshman housing but couldn't get it,"
Bravman said.
This shortage led in part to a housing overhaul plan
brought to the table in 2005. Among other goals, the plan
sought to increase the availability of all-frosh housing
and to "un-stuff" the campus in general — meaning that,
for example, current triples would be converted back to
doubles, and dorm seminar rooms and study spaces
would be reinstated.
Striving toward these goals would mean the conver
sion of more dorms in Wilbur and Stern Halls, for in
stance, to all-frosh housing and that of Branner. Toyon
and Lagunita Court to upper-class housing. The original
plan was revised to keep Roble four-class.
Buffington expressed regret about the proposed changes,
particularly in relation to Branner. "Branner has been an
all-frosh dorm for decades, and I'll be sad when this long
tradition ends." she said. "But I do understand some of
the reasons for the planned change."
After all, it is not the first time that longstanding cus
toms have faced transformation. The press release that
Bravman sent to The Daily in February 2005 noted:
"Branner Hall, for instance, was for decades a four-class
women's dormitory', and Wilbur Hall opened as a men's
dormitory. Change is hard. It is in and of itself neither
good nor bad."

wandering around campus just a few weeks ago.
A central question to consider when making housing
decisions is: four-class or all-frosh? Each has a distinct at
mosphere, and students must assess which suits them
best. There are upsides and downsides to both options.
The upperclassmen in four-class dorms, for instance, pro
vide a natural network of "pseudo-mentors" for fresh
men. in the words of Phillip Arredondo '10.
Arredondo, who lived in Roble his freshman year,
strongly believes that freshmen benefit greatly from the
four-class residential experience.
"Freshman year is a crucible of sorts," Arredondo
said."Let's just say there are a lot of mistakes to be made,
and taking advice from various upperclassmen was defi
nitely a way to avoid lots of those mistakes. Sure, there
are peer-mentoring programs, but I think it's better when
it's more casual."
"And it's a big misconception that the upperclassmen
are just going to stick to themselves," he added. "In reali
ty, they're just all part of the family."
In fact, despite having initially ranked an all-frosh
dorm as his first choice. Arredondo said that he was "so,
so happy that that didn't come true."
"I was under the impression that living with all fresh
men would make it that was just because I was
naive," he said. "It could fie argued that living in an all
frosh dorm, you gain a sense of Stanford pride and fresh
man craziness. And while maybe that didn't hit us as
strongly in a four-class dorm. I still think there's a naivete
that comes with that mob mentality. Plus, freshman
dorms usually get very clique-y."
Stephanie Otani '11 —who lives in Junipero, an all
frosh dorm — agreed.
"I love J-Ro, but the cliques are so bad,"she said. "That's
so freshman-dorm. Sometimes I feel like I'm still in high
school."
When asked whether the all-freshman dorm experi
ence has lived up to her expectations in general, Otani
had mixed feelings.
"I wanted to get to know people in my class, and I
heard that all-frosh dorms are really tight communities,"

Sweet treats are always a delight to a Stanford
student's taste buds, providing that twist to the
usually common and bland menu offered by
the Stanford dining halls.The dining halls' mea
ger variety of desserts and sweet treats leaves
students wondering — Where can we get milkshakes,
cakes and a variety of flavors of FroYo?To satisfy any
one with a sweet tooth, many places on campus have
some sweet offerings.
The Axe & Palm (TAP) and Wilbur's Energy Zone
are located conveniently on campus. Located in the
Old Union building,TAP — which is open until 2 a.m.
for students working hard on papers and problem sets
— has milkshakes with a variety of flavors such as
vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and mint chocolate to
satisfy any milkshake lover. Looking for something
more filling? The TAP also serves dessert crepes after
6:30 p.m.To satisfy Stanford's FroYo fixation,TAP has
also added FroYo to the menu.
Energy Zone is Wilbur Dining's source for energy
drinks.smoothies and candy! Students who are prepar
ing for a midterm, writing papers and coming back
from a long day of class come here to get their boost to
get them through the rest of the day.
"I go to Energy Zone for their candy bars and sweet
smoothies," said Charlie Wang '08.
Sometimes, however, these on-campus venues just
don't cut it. Located in downtown Palo Alto, Fraiche

she said. "I have made a lot of good friends that I could
relate to because we're going through the same freshman
experience, but — and I feel like this is kind of difficult
for me to articulate — the practical side of the living ex
perience has been a lot more complicated and difficult."
"I think because freshmen are new to this college set
ting. they're testing the waters, and they haven't found a
balance in their lifestyles with regard to partying." she
added.
According to Branner Resident Fellow (RF) Nancy
Buffington. however, an all-frosh dorm can be the perfect
setting for finding this balance.
"An all-frosh dorm tends to have more staff support,
more programming and generally more going on." she
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Students interact more
with each other."
Perhaps it is Buffington's image of all-frosh dorms
that has led a majority of incoming freshmen in recent
years to rank these first on their preference forms.
"Most students I talk to enjoy and value that freshman
experience," she added.
However, there isn't enough all-frosh housing to ac
commodate all incoming freshmen who are likely to pre
fer it, according to Vice Provost John Bravman.
"In a given year, we might be short about 200 students
who wanted all-freshman housing but couldn't get it,"
Bravman said.
This shortage led in part to a housing overhaul plan
brought to the table in 2005. Among other goals, the plan
sought to increase the availability of all-frosh housing
and to "un-stuff" the campus in general — meaning that,
for example, current triples would be converted back to
doubles, and dorm seminar rooms and study spaces
would be reinstated.
Striving toward these goals would mean the conver
sion of more dorms in Wilbur and Stern Halls, for in
stance, to all-frosh housing and that of Branner. Toyon
and Lagunita Court to upper-class housing. The original
plan was revised to keep Roble four-class.
Buffington expressed regret about the proposed changes,
particularly in relation to Branner. "Branner has been an
all-frosh dorm for decades, and I'll be sad when this long
tradition ends." she said. "But I do understand some of
the reasons for the planned change."
After all, it is not the first time that longstanding cus
toms have faced transformation. The press release that
Bravman sent to The Daily in February 2005 noted:
"Branner Hall, for instance, was for decades a four-class
women's dormitory', and Wilbur Hall opened as a men's
dormitory. Change is hard. It is in and of itself neither
good nor bad."

is a popular place where students can get their FroYo
fix. Fraiche is loved for European-style homemade
yogurt and the availability of fruit and nut toppings
for reasonable prices. Fraiche's yogurt provides a
healthier alternative to ice cream, and the eatery also
has an assortment of baked goods to satisfy any pas
try lover.
According to Liliana Chan '11, "Everyone loves
sweets and it's better if they are organic and healthy."
If students aren't after health food, Gelato Classico
is a good place to get dessert after a delicious meal on
University Avenue. Gelato Classico serves up a wide
variety of gelato flavors that will definitely satisfy any
body looking for new and different flavors to try. Guar
anteed, your sweet tooth will be satisfied after having
some gelato from this place.
When asked why this place is a hit with the Stanford
students, Bryan Cauley '08 replied, "I really like the
taste and texture of gelato. It's definitely better than
ice cream!"

Thus far, the most immediate, visible
change on the housing scene will be the con-

version of Crothers, which currently houses
graduate students, to upper-class housing, which
will create 350 new beds for undergraduates
"We hope to be in there by fall 0f'09," Bravman
said.

If and when the housing plan goes through in its
entirety," We'd be erring on the other side rather than
the side we're erring on now." Bravman explained.

"We might end up with a somewhat smaller number of
students who want four-class and who we can't accom-

Cakes caters to every single cake lover. The cakes that
it serves are similar to the Japanese style Western cakes
served in cafes in Tokyo. The servings are small and a
bit pricey, hut it definitely gives its customers their sat
isfaction.
And who doesn't love pearl milk tea — also known
as bubble tea or boba — another Asian sweet treat?
Verde Tea House is located in Mountain View, and
many students drive there to satisfy a craving for pearl
milk tea. Verde offers hot milk tea and "freezes" —
similar to smoothies with tapioca pearls — in flavors
like Thai tea, peach, passion fruit and so many more.
"Boba is a great mix of a drink and chewy sweet
sensation. It gives me both caffeine and sugar," said
Katrin Larsen '11.
This is just a short list of places where students go to
satisfy any cravings they have for sweets.There are def
initely more places to try in the area. Be adventurous

modate, rather than the larger number of students
wanting all-frosh housing who we currently can't ac
commodate."
So, how far have we progressed in terms of the rest of
the plan?
"Nowhere," Bravman said. "It's years away, if ever.
This is all in the big idea stage — we're well removed
from the small detail stage. It's just a talking point for
those of us who are thinking about it — there are no de
cisions here at all."
The largest obstacle has been fundraising.
"We have to assess whether or not we can actually do
this," Bravman said. "This could easily amount to a billion
dollars, which is a lot of money. There just isn't the capac
ity right now."
This news would please Arredondo.
"I think it's foolish," he said of the plan.
Indeed, both Buffington and Bravman do agree that
all-frosh housing is not a good fit for all students.
"For some, the liveliness of an all-frosh dorm can be
overwhelming," Buffington wrote.
Bravman is on the same page.
"I have no doubt that four-class housing is the right
option for some students," he said. "[The plan] was not to
eliminate four-class housing; it was to do a better job of
meeting the demand," Bravman explained. "It was defi
nitely a reduction in the number of four-class beds, but
not an elimination. It's not an emphasis on an all-fresh
man campus — I don't want to do that, and we don't have
the space for that anyway."
Nonetheless, he still hopes that the plan will progress,
for reasons based on both initial demand and other data.
"We have done some surveying, and students in fresh
man dorms reported greatest satisfaction and also a
slightly higher GPA," he said. "That doesn't prove causa
tion by any means, but there is a suggested correlation."
Despite such data, some students do not believe that
student satisfaction with first-year housing has been ac
curately assessed.

"An exit poll would reveal a striking number of kids
who feel differently from their original choices,"
Arredondo said.
Bravman says that the administration has reached
out. but students have not been as responsive as hoped.
The senior survey response rate, for example, is at 30 per
cent.
"We have a difficult time getting student opinions," he
said. "Students say that we don't ask for their opinions,
and when we ask, they don't express their voice. It's sort
of the squeaky wheel syndrome. We try to be responsive,
but we end up responding to small groups of students or
not responding at all because we don't get their feed
back."
Regardless, Bravman noted plans to make further ef
forts to garner students' opinions.
"We are going to take more deliberate steps with the
incoming class this fall to get responses from them," he
said. "I don't know if it will have the desired effect, but we
just have to do better. 'We' meaning everybody — both
students and staff."
Meanwhile, when asked facetiously about which type
of freshman housing he personally would rank first,
Bravman — who "had a great time in Arroyo," which was
all-frosh his freshman year — said with a wry smile and a
hint of a wink, "FroSoCo, of course. You're asking the
wrong person."
