# Best and worst of campus study options
## 
### NATASHA KIM 
Even though they appear quiet, libraries
can get pretty crazy.
You walk in with the weight of the world
on your shoulders, sit down and prepare to
devour parcels of information. "Concen
trate now!" you command yourself and be
fore you know it the deep snores of the man
next to you reverberate in your ears. You
look around to discover that the guy you
thought was intensely studying has a game
of Starcraft lighting up his screen; the couple
across the room is giggling and flirting, look
ing as if they belong on a first dinner date;
and the girl next to you begins taking out
from her bag no less than six drinks, includ
ing a small latte, a Naked juice and a bottle
of Dr. Pepper. Maybe you should ask if you
can buy something off of her?
Why do Stanford students go to libraries
— to study? to sleep? to socialize? Are some
libraries better suited for certain goals?
Generally speaking, Stanford students pur
posefully choose where they study, and their
choice often testifies to their particular
learning style.
Simon Kim' 11 chooses what library to go
to based on how productive he needs to be.
"If my work is not that intense 1 usually
go to Green Library knowing that I'll prob
ably run into one of my friends and talk for
a while." Kim said."But if I really need to be
productively favorite library to go to is the
Law Library — it makes me feel more pro
fessional. Plus, the chairs are so comfortable

— they cost more than $4(X> each!"
Sara Lewis J.D. '() l ) does not understand
why the Law Library is so popular among
undergrade
"I don't come here too much except
when I have to take take-home tests," Lewis
said. "I don't understand why anybody
would want to be here in the first place. It's a
really stressful atmosphere."
Meyer, on the other hand, is known to be
much more laid-back.
"I like Meyer because there is no bag in
spection and it is really accessible," said Talia
Karasov "08. "There's always the swinging of
doors with people passing by, a lot of people
are eating — it has a really relaxed atmos
phere, and there is always the option of
studying on the second tloor if the first floor
gets too noisy."
While Meyer may seem to be the more
casual environment, those who have stayed
into the wee hours of the morning know the
true story.
"Meyer is really intense," says Steve Ko
'11. referring to those who study there late
into the night. "These are the really dedicat
ed and driven students."
Many students sleep at Meyer simply be
cause it is the only library open 24-7. but
many agree that the Bender Room in the
Green Library wins hands down for sleep
ing comfort.
"I usually come into Bender because of
the good lighting and very comfortable
plush chairs,"said AlyssaTonelli '08."But al
most everv time I am in here somebody is

sleeping. I don't really mind because I've
done it before too; they're just so comfort
able so it's hard not to."
There are also a large number of students
who choose not to study in the library at all.
"1 love doing reading at Lake Lag," said
Serena Connor '08. "It's the perfect angle to
lie down and hold your book up without
falling asleep. Plus it's been proven that indi
rect light from the sun makes you more pro
ductive."
For the sake of productivity, Karis Tang-
Quan '11 also chooses to study in places
other than libraries.
"1 feel like if you really need to get down
and study you should find your own favorite
place on campus and keep it a secret,"Tang-
Quan said. "Or else 1 know personally that
I'd just end up hanging out with all my
friends."
C'hristophe Chong '11 chooses not to
study at libraries because it goes against his
principles.
"Libraries don't have atmospheres
where people feel comfortable asking some
one for help," said Chong. "There's no op
portunity for students to learn through shar
ing and exchanging ideas with each other.
Maybe it's because I'm an idealistic fresh
man who will change later: 1 know every
body has his own learning style, but person
ally, the way that students use libraries both
ers me."
