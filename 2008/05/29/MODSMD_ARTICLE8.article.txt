# LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE: STUDENT COPS POLICE PEERS
## 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
-yr- eith Knapp '11 was looking for a
112 1 / job on Cardinal Careers that
started quickly and paid well
when he stumbled upon a listing
-JL for the Student Special Events
Patrol (SSEP) — a unique on-campus job
that enables him to don a police badge and
uniform and write parking tickets.
"In winter quarter 1 needed a job and 1
looked online," he said." 1 applied to two, and
this one started faster than the other one."
One of three SSEPs, Knapp says he does
"whatever they want me to."
A typical day on the job starts with a short
briefing. Knapp drives a Community Service
truck around campus, perhaps stopping by a
parking lot and writing a few tickets.
"1 write tickets, I patrol the [arcades of
the] Quad to make sure nobody's riding
bikes in there," he said, describing his daily

routine. Other job responsibilities include
event security, emergency preparedness, bi
cycle abatement and traffic control.
"It's not that exciting," he said.
Still. Knapp said he enjoys the break from
academics that his job gives him.
"It's kind of fun to interact with older peo
ple outside an academic setting, because you
don't really get to do that very much here," he
said. "And I get to walk around and be out
side, so it's all good."
While the Special Events Patrol has long
been a Department of Public Safety (DPS)
fixture, Stanford students first joined the pa
trol as SSEPs in August 2007. according to
Bill Larson, public information officer for
DPS.
Knapp is not a sworn officer and is un
armed; he cannot issue bicycle or motor vehi
cle citations. He noted, however, that DPS
was interested in getting him involved in
crime-fighting efforts, such as patrolling
parking lots to watch for car break-ins.
"They also said they were going to use

me to try to break into buildings, because
most buildings on campus don't have cam
eras and most people don't lock their
doors," Knapp said. "A lot of the administra
tive places get left unlocked, and someone
could just go in there and take all the com
puters."
Although Knapp is a DPS employee, he is
first and foremost a student. He emphasized
that this background affects the way he ap
proaches his job.
"Sometimes it's hard to write tickets for
people who I know are students," Knapp ad
mitted. "If 1 was writing a ticket and a student
came up to the car, 1 would undo it, because 1
would feel bad about it."
Knapp noted DPS' emphasis on safety
rather than punitive measures, and com
mented that the SSEP program also served
as a DPS outreach effort to students — so
they don't see police as "big bad wolves," ac
cording to Knapp.
1 le added that as an SSEP, he has come to
know all of the Stanford police officers — a

perk that he suggested could come in handy
at some point during his time at Stanford.
Larson agreed that SSEPs and officers
"enjoy a close camaraderie."
Although Knapp doesn't see a future for
himself in law enforcement, he said that what
he has learned has been informative in ways
he didn't expect.
"I've learned a lot of tips on how to bypass
things — like places on campus where
there's free parking." he said."And for every
one's first ticket, if you do any kind of appeal
they let you off, which is nice to know."
Other insights, however, were harder to
convey to outsiders.
"It's a whole other world in there." he
said, describing the atmosphere at the sta
tion. "There's Stanford, like all of Stanford,
and then there's the police station, which is
like a totally different place."
"It's just strange," he added after a short
pause. "I don't know. It's different."
