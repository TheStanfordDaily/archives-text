## POSITIVE SUSTAINABILITY Building a solution 
### 
What if we could maintain all
of the energy-intense com
forts of home at just a frac
tion of the cost, even as energy prices
continue to rise rapidly?
Buildings are a crucial compo
nent of any sustainability plan be
cause their operation is responsible
for a full 40 percent of all energy use
and greenhouse gas emissions in the
United States. Residential buildings
account for half of that, and are si
multaneously the easiest and largest
opportunity for you to make a differ
ence with regard to climate change.
According to European experts
working on the "passivhaus," or "pas
sive house," building standard,
homes can now be designed to pro
vide identical services while using 90
percent less heating and cooling en
ergy than the average home, and sig
nificantly less additional energy for
hot water, lighting and electronics.
'I"he single largest user of energy
in homes is heating, accounting for
one-third of residential energy use.
1 n order to reduce heating energy de
mand. passivhauses are super-insu
lated and sealed, to the point of being
nearly airtight, preventing heat loss
through the walls.The passivhaus can
then be heated by a combination of
internal gains, heat generated by res
idents and appliances and solar gain
through windows. When internal and
solar gains are not enough, a small
active heating system may be added,
but at nothing near the size, cost, and
inefficiency of modern furnaces.
Of course, an airtight seal could
prove unhealthy for residents, who
on average spend 90 percent of their
lives inside buildings, which contain
significantly higher levels of pollu
tants and containments than outdoor
air. To solve this indoor air quality
problem, a passivhaus employs a
heat recovery ventilator to provide
fresh air without wasting heat. Heat
recovery ventilators use a heat ex
changer to transfer heat between the
incoming and outgoing airstreams.

Buildings are a
crucial component
of any sustainability
plan because they
account for 40
percent of all energy
use in the U.S.
preventing up to 95 percent of the
heat loss compared to ventilation
systems without heat recovery. The
heat recovery ventilator also pro
vides a central location for the
home's heating element, which in
passivhauses is effectively a hairdry
er.
Overhangs may be designed to
shade windows from the high sum
mer sun, when solar gains can be a
burden to cooling, while allowing the
lower winter sun to stream in
through southern, sun-facing win
dows when heating is most needed.
Thermal mass, in the form of tile
floors or masonry, are used to soak
up extra heat during the day and

reradiate it at night, minimizing fluc
tuations in temperature.
Insulation, airtightness, over
hangs and thermal mass, along with
passive cooling techniques like
opening windows at night, can also
all but eliminate cooling demand in
most climates. Any additional cool
ing needs are met by a cooling ele
ment in the passivhaus's heat recov
ery ventilators.
Energy requirements for water
heating can also be easily reduced.
By replacing traditional tank heaters
with new tankless water heaters, heat
losses can be greatly diminished
without any loss in amenity. In loca
tions with good sun. solar water
heaters can provide a significant por
tion of your hot water renewably.
Taking advantage of natural day
light can significantly cut lighting en
ergy use as well. There is no reason
that homes cannot be designed to
function with minimal artificial light
ing from dawn until dusk. Natural
light has been repeatedly shown not
only to save energy, but also to in
crease residential happiness and pro
ductivity.
Finally, energy efficient appli
ances can significantly reduce elec
tricity demand. While hot water,
lighting and electronics may not yet
be able to achieve the same 90 per
cent reduction in passivhaus heating
and cooling energy use. the savings
made available by these other sys
tems are still significant.
But won't such an efficient home
be prohibitively expensive? Actual
ly, a recent study of more than two
hundred certified passivhauses in
Europe found that these well-de
signed homes cost at most 10 percent
more than the average to construct.
Given the significant savings in
monthly energy bills, an intelligently
built and financed passivhaus can
make you money in the first year. In
places with adequate sun. like Cali
fornia, homes can be made even
more sustainable by applying these

savings toward the added cost of
solar photovoltaic panels to power
their remaining energy needs, mak
ing these homes completely carbon
neutral.
Passivhauses are not just a con
cept for the future. In Europe, there
are at least 6,000 passivhauses: the

United States lags behind in ambi
tion and number, but we're starting
to catch up. There remains no tech
nological barrier to their adoption,
only a lack of awareness among both
residents and architects. If you build
your own home in the future, make it
a passivhaus, and show your kids and

your neighbors that you've made a
lasting difference in the world.
