Web Developer
Work on stuff you love (and get paid)! We're a
startup in Redwoood City creating a physically
simulated online world where users build, invent,
combat, and play.
You're an expert web developer who knows a mix of
XHTML, Ajax/DHTML, CSS, XML, web services, and
object oriented programming (C#, Java, PHP).
