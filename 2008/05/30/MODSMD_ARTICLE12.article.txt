## Seniors to give to Stanford Fund Monetary donation given in lieu of physical object on campus 
### STEPHANIE WERNER STAFF WRITER 
Though The Stanford Fund doles out funds for
student activities and individual scholarships, the
Class of 2008 is giving back to that pool.
"Stanford asks its seniors to give to the senior gift
as opposed to an actual object because in many
ways it will last longer and provide more of a bene
fit to the community," said Senior Gift Committee
member Ben McKinley '08.
"Gifts to The Stanford Fund have more of an
impact on the undergraduate community than a
capital project," said Scott Jahnke, director of
Student and Young Alumni Development for The
Stanford Fund, in an email to The Daily.
"Stanford is constantly under construction and
any physical object we would likely give ... would
be knocked down relatively quickly," McKinley
said. "In this way we feel that giving back to the
community is a better idea than an actual object."
"The Stanford Fund supports scholarships, aca

"This is not the first year that Senior Gift has
been directed towards The Stanford Fund." Jahnke
said.
"Last year, the class of 2007 had 710 seniors
make a gift," Jahnke said. "The class of 2006 had 685
seniors and the class of 2005 had 584 seniors. Hie
2008 Senior Gift Committee has a goal of 50 percent
participation."
If the Class of 2008 does achieve 50 percent par
ticipation. they will exceed the participation record
set by the class of 2007 at 46 percent.
Members of the Senior Gift Committee seem
very committed to this goal.
"The Senior Gift Committee's goal is to get as
many seniors as possible to donate to Senior Gift,"
said McKinley.
"The committee works towards putting together
the entire senior gift campaign," Geier said. "This
includes everything from designing the t-shirts. cups
and sunglasses given as a thank you to donors, plan-
