## Editorial Board Partying sustainably 
### 
In recent years, many aspects of communi
ty and campus life have made strides to
ward a more sustainable or "green" way of
living. From new environmentally-friendly
buildings like Y2E2 to plans for a green dorm,
the environmentally-minded have increased
awareness of sustainability on campus.
Ihe campus social scene is one of the most
overlooked elements of student life that is
contributing to this campus-wide sustainabil
ity initiative. Ilie amount of needless waste
accumulated during an open Row or fraterni
ty party, especially some of the bigger parties
like Exotic Erotic, can be significant. Fortu
nately, sustainability-minded students have
begun to address concerns through the intro
duction of some new party amenities.
While students can recycle bottles and
cans, or even acquire larger alcohol contain
ers such as kegs to avoid the issue all togeth
er, the classic red cup add up to an astonishing
amount of garbage over the course of a year.
While these cups are technically recyclable,
students will notice a number six by the recy
cling logo if they look at the bottom of a red
cup. This indicates a particular level of recy
clability and helps recycling centers sort out
different items for different procedures.
While, theoretically, all numbered products
are recyclable, only products labeled with a
one or two make economic sense to recycle.
The number six on the red plastic cup is
also often accompanied by the letters "PS,"
indicating that the cup contains polystyrene,
the same basic ingredient found in the notori
ous non-recyclable Styrofoam. Realistically,
it is a very expensive and inefficient proce
dure to recycle these cups, meaning they
often get sorted into the trash pile at recycling

centers.
To combat this waste, some Row houses
and fraternities have begun to use #1 PETE
recyclable cups. Sigma Nu's Sunsplash.one of
Stanford's biggest spring parties, featured an
exclusively recyclable cup supply.
Unfortunately, the choice to use recycla
ble cups is not simple. The cups cost roughly
$54 per S(XJ when bought in bulk, as opposed
to $25 for S(X) classic red cups. Therefore, any
organization or house featuring recyclable
cups does so at a financial loss, more than
doubling their original cup expenditures.This
can make sustainability an unattractive goal
for a house that needs to purchase thousands
of red cups throughout a single school year.
In order to encourage this positive effort
to reduce waste, the ASSU and the Universi
ty should recognize, and potentially subsidize,
parties and events that make an effort to "go
green." In their campaign for ASSU Execu
tive, Jonny Dorsey and Fagan Harris suggest
ed the idea of an official "Green/Sustainable"
label for all events and parties that make a
concerted effort to be sustainable in their en
deavors.
The Editorial Board highly encourages
this idea, along with a potential allocation of
funds to help offset the cost of buying recycla
ble cups and other waste-reducing measures.
Students and organizations attempting to
make campus more sustainable should be
recognized for their efforts and financially
compensated to offset losses, at least in part.
I"hese recyclable cups are a fantastic start,
and the ASSU and the University need to
promote it in order to bring an even larger
portion of campus on board with the sustain
ability driveA
