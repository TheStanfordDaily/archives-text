# No You're Sick
## Tolerance vs. social acceptance 
### 
When interacting with any new person
or situation, there's always a period
of acclimatization, of jumping over
mental hurdles. No situation is inherently un
comfortable; it always depends on how you
view things. Watching someone die before
you, for example, could seem horrific to an
average citizen but normal to physicians in an
emergency room.
In new situations, something can hold you
back from reaching a state of comfort, or you
can become progressively more relaxed.
This duality became explicit to me when
some friends and I visited Asia SF last year, a
trendy restaurant/bar in downtown San Fran
cisco where the hosts and waitresses are
transsexuals. I wanted to be relaxed, yet I was
unable to do so for the longest time. Judging
from body language, other guys were in simi
lar straits.
Why is this the case? It could be a novel,
perhaps unsettling, feeling to acknowledge
someone as male who has female characteris
tics you find appealing.
What became apparent was the difference
between tolerance and social comfort; how
one reacts hypothetically versus in-person. In
my case, I had always been a staunch support
er of LGBT rights, yet I found myself nervous
in close, social interactions with my transsex
ual hosts at Asia SF. As an even starker exam
ple. I remember one night when my friend,
after a drag party, went directly to a college
bar. This place was the quintessential loud,
rowdy, frat-boy kind of bar. In comes my
friend, 6'4 in a red dress, shaved legs, dark
makeup and a long, black wig. The bar sud
denly hushed and guys couldn't get out of the
way fast enough.
True acceptance means possessing both
tolerance and social comfort for a particular
group of people. The social aspect of accept
ance is just as crucial as tolerance. Social iso
lation is one of the most painful experiences
in life — everyone knows the sting of feeling
unwelcome.
Social acceptance has two components:
the comfort of a person with him or herself

and the comfort other people have with that
person. The two are closely interlinked
since one's comfort level can often deter
mine and influence other people's and vice
versa.
To be truly unbiased, we have to ensure
that our side of the acceptance equation is
complete. 1 suspect everyone has a bit of un
conscious discomfort for one group of people
or another. I don't think, however, that moral
judgment has to be passed for having that dis
comfort. But that's not to say it's condoned —
as humans, it's within our capacity to control
our impulses. One has to recognize those hid
den biases and actively root them out.
That is what I found myself doing at Asia
SF. I became used to the physical presence of
the gender illusionists, as our hosts were
called. Generally, I just learned to enjoy my
self in the situation, which Asia SF, with its
playful atmosphere and performances, tries
to promote. My friends and I laughed along
with our hosts as they told us self-effacing
jokes like, "My dad wanted a boy, my mom
wanted a girl and. with me, they both won."
We all agreed that our night at Asia SF was
a transformative one. What felt really exhila
rating is that we had expanded our comfort
zones. And.it also gave us the freedom to do
things we would have never attempted be
fore — my friends and I threw a drag party
later that year. Funny thing about going drag
is that, for guys, you'll receive dramatically
more positive female attention dressed as a
girl than as a guy. Who knew that social com
fort had so many perks?
