## An issue of class 
### 
Our parents don't have prestigious jobs;
wc have no connections. As much as
we'd like to take that trip to China this
summer, we'll have to forgo the opportunity.
Even if we could find enough money to pay
for it, we'd still have to earn money for our
Stanford expenses next year. And no matter
how inexpensive that dinner may be, we al
ways have to consider the cost of necessities
first. We are students who come from families

making thousands of dollars less than the av
erage Stanford student's. Our parents don't
make hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year, but tens of thousands, if that. We're re
minded of this difference every day.
Imagine, if you come from a family with a
six-figure income, that you attend a school
where the majority of students come from
families making less than $45,000 a year and
that you are trying to blend in. People around

you always seem to be talking about their fi
nancial concerns.
While this situation is obviously not the
same, it is illustrative of the anxieties low-in
come students feel about being "discovered"
as different. Because the Stanford culture
values money and we come from families
that have little of it. we feel out of place talk
ing about our parents' jobs, our summer
plans, where we have or have not traveled
and where we might grab dinner on Saturday
night.
We understand that more economically
fortunate students aren't intentionally trying
to make us feel uncomfortable by sharing

their experiences. While we enjoy hearing
about our friends' lives, discussing topics that
reflect our class status can be stressful and
hurtful. We feel vulnerable when students
talk about their experiences as if everyone
should have had them. We should be aware of
what assumptions we make.
Stanford should be a place that is comfort
able for people of all backgrounds â€” includ
ing ours.
