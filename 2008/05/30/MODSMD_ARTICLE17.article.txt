# 'NAT'-URAL Philosophy
## Common-senselessness 
### 
You hear it all the time. "Stanford stu
dents may be book smart, but they
don't have any common sense."This is
an especially powerful claim to me because,
well, I will freely admit, I am a Stanford stu
dent and 1 also happen to lack common
sense.
1 can never really get an answer, though,
when I ask what not having common sense
means. Common sense is a nebulous term, as
sociating many disparate ideas under its col
lective umbrella. Regardless, it seems we
seem to lack whatever definition you choose.
Seeking a complete definition, although it
seems contrary to the nature of common
sense to find it in a book, I looked it up in the
dictionary and obtained the following: a
sound and prudent sense of things common
to humanity.
But what does this mean? Sound and pru
dent? A sense of things? Common to human
ity? Says who? What humanity?
Maybe a more informative approach to
defining common sense is to present for you
the times which others have scolded me for
lacking it. From these three examples, maybe
we can devise a better working definition:
1.) I recently attempted to order 800 hotdogs
for a barbeque of 400 people. It is "com
mon sense" that 800 hotdogs is entirely
too much for this variety of gathering.
Add to that, not only are 400 people not
going to eat 800 hotdogs, but I would not
be able to purchase 800 hotdogs from
Safeway, which I was trying to do.
2.) I slept next to a radiator on a cold night
the other day. I woke up with a burn

Sound and prudent?
A sense of things?
Common to
humanity?
Says who?

across my hack. It is "common sense" that
radiators burn skin.
3.) 1 tried to argue that leaving out a bag of
candy on your porch for Halloween would
be fine. But it's just "common sense" that
kids aren't going to just take one.

Anything involving natural phenomena,
bodily responses and social phenomena that
1 should have been aware of, I will admit fall
rightfully under "common sense." These
truths are, in many respects, inherent. Based
on the collective experiences of mankind,
they are known to avoid hurt and other mal
adies.
But what about the third? While here, its
application seems similar to the other two. It
is instructive to think about what applying
common sense is really saying. Ultimately,
"common sense" used in this context means
nothing more than "I'm taking this for grant
ed." It is a way to start in the middle of an ar
gument â€” to assume a shared knowledge
base of primitive, inarguably true premises.
And while this may make sense in the
context of safety brochures about radiators,
from a philosophical point of view it is horri
fying. Can we not get back to the days when
Descartes was able to doubt everything ex
cept his very existence? When he systemati
cally sought out those things which were in
herently true, and concluded that they were
dreadfully few in number (namely, there was
only one)?
Common sense seems to revolve around
the idea of "obvious." But I hate "obvious."
To quote Einstein here, and I rarely do this
because people quote Einstein too much,
"Common sense is the collection of preju
dices acquired by age eighteen.""Obvious" is
often nothing more than the status quo. The
best discoveries are not the obvious ones, but
those that are counterintuitive, that force us
to reconsider everything we previously held
self-evidently true.
To go around trumpeting "common
sense." at least in the third sense, is to go
around supporting the way things are and
saying it is the way things always will be.
You know what? I am proud to lack com
mon sense. While certain aspects of my com
mon-senselessness may indeed result in
physical harm or social embarrassment,
these are byproducts of a generalized skepti
cism, one which I believe is healthy and just.
The next time you are berated for lacking
common sense, first,check for burn marks. If
you don't see any, however, it may just be
that you are questioning something that
should be questioned.

Nat still has the hum, hut he argued valiantly
for candy on the doorstep at Halloween. Send
