## The
						truth about Tibet 
### 
For the past couple months, political ten
sion, riots and arrests in Tibet have sparked
controversy around the world. On the eve
of the 2008 Olympic Games, Tibet supporters
seized the opportunity to gain unprecedented
global attention by interfering with the Olympic
torch relay and advocating a boycot of the
Games.
I don't dispute China's track record on
human rights. Given the massive social transfor
mations in China. I'd be very surprised if there
was not tension or resentment. As a non-Tibetan
Chinese citizen, I hope that some day Tibetan
and Chinese people can enjoy the religious and
political freedoms common in a Western democ
racy. Tibetan protesters, however, need to recog
nize some larger truths.
'ITiough the relations between Tibet and
China are complicated, Tibet has been under
Chinese rule from the Yuan Dynasty of the
13th and 14th centuries to the Qing Dynasty
from the 18th century until the 20th. In 1751,
the Chinese emperor OianLong established

the Dalai Lama as Tibet's spiritual and political
leader, subject to supervision by a resident
commissioner from the Chinese central gov
ernment. Effectively, Tibet has been part of
China longer than the United States has been
an independent nation.
Since its establishment in the seventh centu
ry, Tibet has maintained a close connection with
regions of China. lTie first governor of Tibet.
Songtsan Gampo, married Princess Wencheng,
the niece of the Chinese emperor of the Tang
Dynasty. Both Chinese and Tibetan are tonal
languages and are from the same Sino-Tibetan
language family. Linguists today consider the Ti
betan language to be the closest relative to Chi
nese.
Although the Chinese government has been
at fault during many of its proceedings with
Tibet, it is unfair that Tibet supporters in the
West so rarely acknowledge China's great con
tributions to Tibet. ITie Chinese government
abolished slavery, feudalism and the Tibetan
serfdom system of unpaid labor. Before the

19505, when the Dalai Lama presided over Tibet.
the majority of the rural population, some
7(H).(KK) of an estimated rural population of
1,250,000, were serfs, forced to work on land
owned by monasteries or aristocrats. The Com
munists also brought economic prosperity and
social welfare, including daycare, health care,
housing and education. None of these services
were available to common Tibetans before the
installation of the Communist government.
While people may perceive the Tibet issue as
solely a matter of religious freedom, they must
understand that there is a greater context involv
ing the clash between China's modern economy
and the feudalism aspect of the Tibetan society.
There is a tendency amongst Westerners to
romanticize the Tibetan religion and the sup
pression of the Tibetan people. Tibet feudalism
is largely cloaked in Buddism, and Tibetans are
normal people,not perfected spiritualists or sim
ple political symbols. In fact,there are numerous
other groups that have been marginalized by the
dramatic social transformations on-going in

China today. Relative to many other ethnicities
in China. Tibetans actually enjoy more govern
mental benefits than most. As of 2007, Tibetan
Buddhism was still practiced widely and tolerat
ed by officials. TTie Chinese government ex
empts Tibetans from all taxation.
Tibet supporters should recognize that the
Communist Party has made numerous efforts to
aid Tibet's economic and social development.
With appropriate reforms, there is no reason
that Chinese and Tibetans cannot coexist peace
fully in a unified China. Those who boycott the
Games should also acknowledge the difference
between the Chinese people and the Chinese
government. 1 support the games as a represen
tation of the pride of all Chinese people, as a
symbol of Chinese progress and as a reminder of
the ideals and values that we must uphold as
China moves forward.

There is a tendency
amongst Westerners
to romanticize the
Tibetan religion and
the suppression of
the Tibetan people.
