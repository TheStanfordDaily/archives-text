## Packard hospital fined for self-reported error Ventilation error puts patient in danger 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital was fined $25,000 last week
by the California Department of
Public 1 lealth for failing to have cor
rect policies in place regarding the
use of ventilators and gases, which
the state concluded put a patient in
danger.
The hospital self-reported the
error to the state, which then levied
the tine despite disagreements with
hospital officials about the error.
A report provided to The Daily
by the health department cites the
hospital for failing to follow its
policy on the storage of ventilator
equipment and neglecting to have
diagrams illustrating the setup of
nitrogen gas for the ventilator.
"There was an incorrect config
uration of the ventilatory equip
ment at a patient's bedside, and
this error was immediately recog
nized and corrected." said Christy
Sandborg, the hospital's chief of
staff. "There was no harm done to
the patient."
The health department report
said the patient, a nine-day old

infant, had his heart rate drop to 62
beats per minute — well below the
normal newborn range of 100 to 160
— as a result of the ventilator error.
He had to be manually ventilated
five times.
"We self-reported the error
because we think that we have a
commitment to patient safety,"
Sandborg said. "The state defines
this as a danger to the patient. We
actually disagree, and we went to the
state and discussed it with them, and
they didn't change their opinion."
Sandborg disagrees with the fine
because hospital policies ensured
that the patient was not harmed by
the error.
"Because we were immediately
at the bedside, we didn't allow harm
to come to the patient," Sandborg
said. "The patient is doing well and
recovering."
The hospital is now taking steps
to make sure that such an incident
does not happen again.
"We've never had this issue hap
pen before," Sandborg said. "We
actually ensure that the instructions
are available, and our policy is to be
at the bedside when this sort of
thing is being set up. so we would
recognize if there was an error in the
configuration."
