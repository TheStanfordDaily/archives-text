NOTES: Stanford comes into its Regional as
the No. 1 seed, but this weekend will cer
tainly be no Cakewalk for the Cardinal. UC-
Davis, the team's opponent tonight, has al
ready beaten Stanford twice this year. Senior
Erik Davis will look to change that trend as
he is yet to face the Aggies but will take the
mound tonight in the Cardinal's biggest
game yet this season.

The Cardinal will begin play as the No. 1
seed of the Stanford Regional of the 2008
NCAA Baseball Championship tonight
when it faces off against No. 4 UC-Davis.
If Stanford wins, the team will move on to
face the winner of No. 2 Pepperdine and No.
3 Arkansas match-up, on Saturday.
But first the Cardinal must take down the
Aggies, who have given Stanford trouble all
season: Stanford has lost both match-ups

against UC-Davis this year. In early April,
the Aggies came from behind to win 9-8 in 12
innings, and at the end of the month, they
downed the Cardinal, 10-8.
"They're very good," said coach Mark
Marquess. "They've got some young players,
but the nucleus is an older team. They've
played a lot; they know how to play."
The Cardinal will face both an explosive
offense and the Aggies' staff ace, senior
right-hander Eddie Gamboa (6-3, 2.67
ERA). Stanford has yet to face Gamboa this
year as teams save their best arms for week

end series and both match-ups between the
Cardinal and UC-Davis have come during
the week.
"He's an experienced pitcher who knows
how to pitch," said Marquess. "He's going to
change speeds very well."
"It all starts with Eddie," said UC-Davis
catcher Jake Jeffries.
Stanford will send out its own ace, senior
Erik Davis, to combat a tough Aggies lineup.
Davis is 7-2 on the year, including four com
plete games. He normally pitches the middle
match of the weekend series but will head to

the mound on Friday to try and give the Car
dinal an early advantage in the tournament.
It will be the first time he has faced UC-
Davis on the year.
He will have an arduous task: Jeffries
headlines an Aggies' attack that features the
fast and powerful centerfielder Ryan Roys
ter and the ever-consistent third baseman"fy
Kelly.
"The teams you're playing are at their
best level. You have to play well defensively,"

said Marquess.
Stanford's lineup is dangerous as well,
though. Catcher Jason Castro, second
baseman Cord Phelps,center fielder Sean
Ratliff and first basemen Brent Milleville
and Randy Molina provide a solid center
to the Cardinal attack.
But Marquess said that the hitters that
may put Stanford over the top could be
unforeseen.
"In the postseason, it's guys you didn't
expect — guys at the bottom of your line
up," he said. "There's an element of luck.
It makes it exciting for fans, but it makes
coaches' hair go gray."
Playoff baseball, Marquess said, is
thoroughly unpredictable.
"There's so much parity" he said.
"There's a very fine line between winning
and losing."
"If you look at the history of the tour
nament, especially recently, it isn't always
the highest ranked team, it is the team
that is playing the best baseball at the
time," said UC-Davis coach Rex Peters.
"It is really a wide open field. Even this
region is wide open, it is really who is
playing the best baseball at the time."
Indeed. Marquess said that Stanford
isn't feeling the strain of being a No. 1
seed, both because of the breadth of the
teams involved and the Cardinal's own
remarkable season.
"There's not as much pressure be
cause it's unexpected that we're here," he
said. "We were picked to finish sixth or
seventh in the conference; we're not sup
posed to be here."
Still, that hardly means that Stanford
is settling.
"We're going to take each game at a
time, but we want to make it to Omaha,"
said Castro.
In order to do so, the Cardinal must
outlast its three regional opponents over
the course of the double-elimination
tournament. If Stanford wins, it'll face the
victor of the Waves/Razorbacks match
up and will be able to control its destiny.
But even with a loss, the Cardinal will be
able to redeem itself on Saturday and
could still potentially win the regional.
In any case, tonight's match-up with
the Aggies is the first step on the way to
Omaha. Tonight's game is set to start at 5
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
