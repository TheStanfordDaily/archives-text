### ANARGHYA VARDHANA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend the Cardinal will compete at the NCAA
West Regional meet at Cal State-Northridge.The regional
meet acts as a qualifier for the NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships in June. From each event, the top five individuals
will proceed to the next level, along with the top three re
lays.
Events that will not he contested this weekend include

the 10,000 meter run, the
decathlon and the hep
tathlon. In the 10,000
meter run, freshman
Alex Gits has already
achieved the automatic
qualifying standard, as
has junior Hari Mix of
the men's team. Senior
Josh Hustedt has a provi
sional standard in the de
cathlon, while among the
women junior Lauren
Stewart and freshman
Whitney Liehr have pro
visional standards in the
heptathlon.

meet with the women
ranked tenth nationally
and the men ranked
45th. Twenty men and 19
women will represent

NCAA West Regional
5/30-5/31 Northridge,
Calif.
NOTES: The men's and women's track
and field teams look to set themselves
up for the NCAA Championships in
mid-June, both individually and as a
team. The women are currently
ranked No. 10 in the country while the
men are No. 45. This weekend's
competition is a qualifier to the NCAA
Championships; the top five individu
als in each category will move on

the Cardinal at the West Regional, all in a variety of events.
"We're excited to bring a large group of regional quali
fiers to Northridge. Top five, that's the goal for everyone.
Our coach, coach Floreal, said. 'There is no difference be
tween fifth and first this weekend, they both get you to the
same place,' so that's the mission," said junior captain
Myles Bradley.
Another important achievement for the track and field
team this week came in the form of an award for senior and
team co-captain Russell Brown. Brown was awarded the
spring Pac-10 Scholar-Athlete of the Year award, winning
it with his 3.44 GPA as a Political Science major, fourth
place at Pac-10 Championships in the 1,500 meters and his
overall leadership and commitment to the team.
In response to the meet. Brown said,"All I can say about
Regionals is that despite it being just a qualifier, it is one of
the best predictors of NCA As.Treating it like an important
competition that you are trying to win helps prepare you
for the even bigger event right around the corner.
"In light of that, we are sending a huge team this year
and expect to do extremely well. Especially on the distance
side, we only had a few guys perform how they are capable
of at Pac-lOs, so Regionals is the opportunity to prove to
ourselves that we are national class competitors."
Brown will join the rest of his teammates in the much
cooler climate this weekend as opposed to the heat which
pervaded Arizona at the Pac-10 Championship. The athletes
look to exert the least amount of energy to achieve top five
positions while qualifying for NCAA Championships.
