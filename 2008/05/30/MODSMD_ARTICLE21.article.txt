## Lakers advance to NBA finals with win 
### JOHN NADEL THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
'ITie Lakers celebrated the Western
Conference championship before their
adoring fans at Staples Center, but not too
hard.
They've got one more goal to reach be
fore the real excitement begins.
Kobe Bryant scored 1 7 of his 39 points
in the fourth quarter, and the Lakers ral
lied from an early 17-point deficit to beat
the defending NBA champion San Anto
nio Spurs 100-92 on Thursday night and
win the conference finals in five games.
They get a week off before opening the
NBA finals next Thursday night at Boston
or Detroit. The Celtics lead the Eastern
Conference finals 3-2 with Game 6 on Fri
day night in Detroit.
"I think it is a tremendous accomplish
ment," Bryant said."l think the West is ex
tremely tough. We're all extremely excited
and proud about it.
Now, it's time to go on and see if we
can't finish it off."
The Lakers are 12-3 in the playoffs, in
cluding 8-0 at Staples Center, where they
haven't lost in two months.They have won
14 straight home games and 21 of their last
24 postseason games at home.
"My heart's still pumping, that adrena
line is still running from the game," said
Lamar Odom, who had 13 points and eight
rebounds. "Maybe when I sit down and
have something to eat, I'll realize what just
happened.
"We came out here, played our game,
and won. It's satisfying, but one more
step."
A basket by Odom gave the Lakers an

83-76 lead with s:4o»remaining. but a 3-
pointur by Brent Barry and a basket by
Tony Parker drew the Spurs within two
points. Manu Ginobili missed a 3-pointer
that could have given San Antonio the
lead before Bryant's jumper with 3:33 to
play made it 85-81.
A foul shot by Tim Duncan drew the
Spurs within three, but two more baskets
by Bryant made it 89-82 with 1:47 to play,
and the Spurs weren't closer than five
points after that.
Pau Gasol had 12 points, a career play
off-high 19 rebounds, five assists and four
blocked shots and backup guards Sasha
Vujacic and Jordan Farmar added nine
and eight points, respectively.
Parker scored 23 points and Duncan
had 19 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists
for the Spurs. Michael Finley scored 13
points, Barry and Kurt Thomas added 11
each and Ginobili was held to nine, shoot
ing just 3-for-9.
"Just got to gear it up again to go to
next year," Duncan said. "Love what we
had this year. We just weren't good
enough through stretches."
Former Lakers star and executive Jerry
West presented the Lakers the Western
Conference championship trophy on the
court following the game. By that time, the
players were all wearing T-shirts and caps
denoting their championship status.
Lakers coach Phil Jackson has won
nine championships, tied for the NBA
record with former Boston coach Red
Auerbach.
"1 like not to get involved personally in
this and think of this as a team effort," he
said regarding what playing in the NBA fi
nals means to him.b to be able to finish in

the finals and win."
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich pointed
to his team's offense-and the Lakers' de
fense-as the keys to the series.
"1 thought we did a fine job," he said.
"We just didn't muster the offense, for a
variety of reasons. The fact that we didn't
come through offensively is a disappoint
ment. but part of that is a credit to the
Lakers.
"(The Spurs) just played a team that
was better. That's why the Lakers won.
The better team won. You get a seven
game series, you win four games, you're
the best team."
TTie Lakers clinched their berth in the
finals a year to the day after Bryant called
the team's front office "a mess" during a
radio interview.
Hut once the season began, Bryant
bonded with his teammates, led the Lak
ers to the No. 1 seed in the rugged West
and won his first MVP award.
"Once the season started, I didn't think
about a trade or anything like that." Bryant
said."l just buckled down into what 1 need
ed to do to get this team to play our best
basketball. That's what we did."
The Lakers will be playing in the finals
for the 23rd time since moving from Min
neapolis to Los Angeles in 1%1 and the
29th time overall.They have won 14 cham
pionships-nine in Los Angeles and five in
Minneapolis.
San Antonio's elimination might signal
the end of its era of dominance. With Dun
can leading the way, the Spurs won cham
pionships in 1999,2003,2005 and 2007, but
with a rotation made up solely of 30-some
thing players except for the 26-vear-old
Parker, the future seems uncertain.
