## "Transient" exhibit Review of 
### JIREH TAN INTERMISSION CURATOR 
Old houses were scaffolding once
And workmen whistling.
— T.E. Hulmc
We deal, inevitably, with the ephemerality of our exis
tence. Houses arc built and abandoned, highways are con
structed and the routes are changed, nations rise and fall. But
one thing remains unchanged — the impermanence of it all.
"Transient," the exhibition of artwork created by Stanford's
three graduating MFA students, deals with the theme of time
slipping away.
Out of the three projects on exhibition, Naomi Van
derkindren's work is the most accessible. Her offering,
"Paramnesia," is a set of large-scale glass-plate negative and
small tintype photographs portraying desolate houses that
have been left to decay. Her photographic eye lingers on her
subject with a certain affectionate nostalgia, raising the ques
tion: who lived here, and why don't they live here anymore?
Undercutting the sense of wistful melancholy is the ironic
awareness of Vandcrkindren's technique — she has specifi
cally chosen these forms of photography to create the illusion
of age. We are aware of a faint sense of being manipulated.
Vandcrkindren's work is full of sentiment, but it is not senti
mental.
If irony is suggested in Vandcrkindren's work, it is blatant
in I ,ordy Rodriguez's "First Colony," an installation depict

ing a fictional immigration office where people can decide
whether or not they want to become a citizen of the imagina
tively-titled First Colony. A flagrantly unashamed satire of
current immigration policies, First Colony is self-consciously
kitsch. The image of maps, so innocuously colorful on first
sight, takes on a chilling tinge as we realize that cartography
is the first means by which colonial masters take control of
their subjects.
Landscape is the inspiration behind Matt Jones's "Traffic
Wave," made from woven wooden strips that warp and click
in response to a live video feed of the traffic outside. Decep
tively simple, "Traffic Wave" is a hypnotic work. You stand
and stare, not knowing when the next pop will be, or why. The
effect is strangely soothing, but bizarrely inexplicable — al
most like a Zen rock garden. The multi-sensory work invites
the reader to see, hear and (perhaps) touch the artist's con
ception of transience.
One could have hoped for a more coherent curation of the
separate works, which seemed to have been slapdashedly
thrown together in the Stanford Art Gallery. All things con
sidered, however, "Transient" is a clever exhibition, and a
strong showing from artists who will eventually go on to do
bigger, more daring work. "Transient," with its three bite
sized works, might prove to be worth your time.
"Transient" will be showing at Thomas Welton Stanford
Art Gallery, which is open Tuesday through Friday. 10 AM-5
p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 1-5 p.m. Admission is free.
The Gallery is located in the Stanford campus, off Palm Drive
at 419 Lasuen Mall.
