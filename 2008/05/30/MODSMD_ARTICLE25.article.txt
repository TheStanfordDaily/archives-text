# Editor's Note
## 
### 
Guys, it's the last Intermission of the volume. The last volume of the year. And,
for me, the last year of my (friggin' awesome) four-year career here at Stanford. It's not
entering the real world that I'm worried about — when going gets tough, the tough, um,
quit their temporary cubicle jobs to get MFAs — but leaving this incredible time behind.
One of the things that is hardest to say goodbye to is my beloved Intermission.
I'm going to get weepy on you and take a few column-inches to express my grati
tude to everyone who has been a part of Intermission this volume. Since literally the first
day I set foot on this campus, I have loved Intermish with my whole heart. My freshman
year was during the last leg of the Tam Vo Gilded Age of Intermish. Every week I ripped
up a copy of The Daily and felt like I had personally discovered this brilliant hidden gem of
a section, with its funny, sometimes raunchy articles and guerrilla layout (hate to break it
to you, guys, but the snappy pictures we bring you every week aren't the result of our
Massive Highly Copyright Respecting Image Database.)
I was thrilled by the movie and restaurant reviews — proof that someone, some
where actually gets off of this damn campus on a regular basis — and could think of no
greater fate than meeting (or crossing swords with) the inimitable Roxy Sass. Back in the
day, I suspect I thought she was actually a real person.
Surely it took brilliance, vision, God-given talent to put together such an icono
clastic display of journalism. Surely it couldn't be done by a schmuck like me. I believed
that right up until the day last September when I was the schmuck actually doing the job.
With all due respect to the illustrious Tam Vo and my many other predecessors,
whose work I spent much of last summer systematically examining, dissecting and admir
ing, turns out the job isn't really so hard when you have an incredible team of people work
ing alongside you, making magic week after week.
Huge thanks to my inspired layout editors, Tricia and Andrew, who somehow
managed to make every issue this volume look more beautiful than the last. I have ab
solutely no idea how you guys do it. In the beginning of the volume, our section was
cursed — literally everyone associated with it on the editorial side, except me, jumped

ship at the same time — and I joked that Kat-Mission was going to be handwritten on
paper towels. Not the case, thank god. You guys made Intermish exquisite. The long
hours we spent together every week, turning a jumbled mess of emails and Google Image
searches into this searingly fucking beautiful creation, were hilarious and social and seri
ously You Tube-abusing. I just wish there had been more pictures of Rod Stewart.
And what would a dizzyingly beautiful journalistic masterpiece be without top
notch creative content? I would say that never in the history of Intermission (and I've read
all of them from the past eight years) has this section been blessed with such a dedicated,
hilarious, scathingly original group of writers — but honestly, guys, that would just be
damning you with faint praise. The articles we've run this volume have been consistently
top-caliber. All volume, people from my freshman dorm who I didn't even think knew me
have stopped me to compliment this review or agree with the outcome of that bracket.
(And to answer a question I get not-infrequently: Yes, the same guy who writes the brack
ets also seeds them. I know this borders on shenanigans, but let's face it, Teddy gets
away with it because he's a friggin' comedic genius.) Your talent and creativity make Inter
mission something that people want to read and a project of which we can all be proud.
I also owe a deep debt of gratitude to Alex who, in spite of his busy schedule,
spent some of his time and genius every week creating the jaw-dropping covers that
make Intermish so attractive. Seriously, close the page and look at this damn thing. Takes
your breath away, doesn't it? Certainly every week it takes away mine.
My layout, my writers, my Intermission, I have loved you with frankly embarrass
ing passion. This year at the helm of Intermission has been the greatest romance of my
collegiate life. I'd like to give a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has played a pivotal
role in making this what I truly believe is the greatest (mid-circulation college paper Arts &
Entertainment) section in the modern era or possibly existence — and not least of all you
readers, who make this job so fulfilling. Particularly any of you bored or maudlin enough to
actually read this weepy old-man rambling.
You have made this year a perpetual joy.
