## BAD IDEA. 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION DUMBASS 
I had a bad idea once. Now, it didn't involve me going to the hospital or to jail, so I guess it wasn't the worst idea I've ever
had, but it was still pretty bad. It happened on March 17,2006, my bad idea. I remember the exact date because 1 have a mem
ory like the blade of a knife and am incredibly handsome. Also, it was St. Patrick's Day.
That day I had class until 4 p.m. My best friend and drinking buddy finished class at noon. Thus, by the time 1 was set to
begin the celebration, my friend was doing somersaults in the hallways of Branner and asking people if they wanted to buy any
of his hair.
"What's up?" 1 inquired of him.
"Irish car bombs," he replied. Still being in it's-the-middle-of-the-week-and-I-just-got-back-from-class mode, his reply at
first confused me. To tell you the truth, I looked for a second up at the ceiling to sec if there were indeed any Irish car bombs
up there. There were none.
"What does that mean, exactly?" I asked.
"We're doing Irish car bombs, fool!" he said with a fervor approaching the religious. ;
How could I say no? A
I should pause here and explain what an Irish car bomb is. An Irish car bomb is — like a sake bomb, a depth
a fountain hill rum bomb or a black hoe — a shot of some hard alcohol dropped in a cup of beer and drunk with
ity. Specifically, an Irish car bomb is a shot of Bailey's Irish cream dropped in a cup of Guinness. The idea behind
sort of bomb drink is that you drop the entire shot glass in the cup, so that the alcohols don't really mix all that
until you've drunk them. This will be important later, trust me.
So. we went back to his room, which had been dubbed for the evening "Ye Olde Publick House of Liquorc and!
Merry-ment." In it I found three guys passed out on the floor, a small shirtless man shadowboxing in the corner and I
Flogging Molly blasting from a computer that had been duct-taped to the ceiling. 1 was astonished; it really looked ■
like an Irish bar. It was stocked like an Irish bar, too: the beer fridge was full of Guinness, and the only hard alcohol
available was Bailey's Irish Cream and a half-drunk bottle of Jameson's which, try as I might, I could not pry ;
the hands of Passcd-Out Guy #2. There was only one thing a regular Irish Bar has that this bar didn't have: shot glass
cs. Which gets me to the "Bad Idea" part of the story.
"Shit dude," he said. "What are we gonna do?"
"1 don't know," I said.
I know now. We could have gone to someone else's room and borrowed two shot glasses. We could have used V ... ,
Dixie cups as shot glasses, or those little measuring cups you get with liquid medicine. We could have not drunk
the...well, OK, that wasn't really an option. But I couldn't come up with any of those ideas then. What I came up with ■SBST
was:
"Why don't we just pour the Bailey's into the Guinness?"
"Great idea!" my friend said. Wrong. Horrible idea. For the reason why, I direct the reader to the Wikipedia entry V
for "Irish car bomb," which reads: "Once mixed the drink must be consumed quickly, because it will curdle."
right; about 30 seconds into leisurely sipping my Irish car...leak, I found myself half-drinking half-chewing a pukey brown mix
ture of Guinness Stout and cottage cheese. I think I spat it on the walls, on my shoes and on my RA.
"Oh my God! That was disgusting!" I exclaimed with my "Thizz Face" on. "I'm throwing this out."
"Oh hell no you're not," my friends said. "Today is St. Paddy's Day. On St. Paddy's Day we drink, no matter what the cost.
Finish it."
I sighed. What can I say, he was right.
So I finished it. I wasn't happy about it, but I did it. Because sometimes, when you have a bad idea, you just have to roll with
it until it's all over. I made a comment to that effect to my friend a few minutes later.
"That's true, man, that's true," he said. "Hey, you wanna buy some hair?"
