## The
						Oasis: A casual pub in the desert of Silicon Valley 
### THEO POLAN INTERMISSION BEER GARDENER 
A week from now. it will be
Memorial Day weekend, the unoffi
cial start of summer. After a long
school year of lousy dining hall food,
it may be time to set your sights off
campus. But if you don't have a lucra
tive summer job lined up, eating in
Palo Alto can be rough on your wal
let. For a change of pace that is sure to
put you in the mood for summer with
out leaving your bank account empty,
consider heading over to The Oasis in
Menlo Park.
The Oasis (formally known as The
Oasis Beer Garden) has been serving
up pints and pitchers of beer with
burgers, wings and pizza for 50 years.
Unless you know it's there, it's easy to
drive past the small sign on El Camino
Real just south of Safeway hundreds
of times without ever noticing. From
the sign to the entrance to the interior.

it looks like little has changed since
The Oasis first opened. It has a small,
not particularly active bar and a larg
er dining room with big tables in the
middle — ideal for groups and more
secluded booths along the sides. The
dimly lit interior looks one step short
of being shut down by either the
health or buildings inspector f jtbanks
to its dirty floors, rickety seaung and
tables and walls with countless names
and initials carved into them,
But this is just what gives the place
its character. If you're looking for a
refined, clean space for an expensive
yuppie burger, go to The Counter. If
you're looking for a relaxed place to
drink a few beers and fill your stom
ach with cheap food, then The Oasis is
the place to be. Somewhat nmioying
ly, there is no table service. You place
your order at the bar and are given a
pager that flashes and vibrates when
your order is ready to be picked up.

Such high technology seems to clash
with the otherwise classic vibe.
The menu is fairly limited, consist
ing of burgers, sandwiches, pizza and
a few sides. For a place that prides it
self on burgers, the selection was fair
ly disappointing, with fewer than 10
total permutations to pick from. The
deluxe burger (which included let
tuce, tomato, onion, mayo and Cana
dian bacon) was good, but far from
impressive. The patty itself was of a
thickness that you might expect to
find at McDonald's. With so much
other stuff on the burger, it was near
ly impossible to actually taste the
meat. Tn fact, it was more like having
a Canadian BLT than a burger.
Speaking of which, offering only
Canadian bacon and none of the real
thing is not only unpatriotic, it's culi
narily offensive.
The Philly Cheesesteak was a bit
more impressive, combining gener

ous amounts of thinly sliced meat with
peppers and onions and no shortage
of cheese. Granted, any native of the
City of Brotherly Love would proba
bly scoff at Oasis's rendition, but it
was still good and probably a better
choice than the burger. The fries that
came with both sandwiches (each
with fries ran around $7) were surpris
ingly good. They were thicker than
most fries, allowing you to actually
taste the potato, but they were still
small enough to be crispy all the way
through and distinctly unhealthy.
While you can't always judge a
book by its cover, you most certainly
can judge a bar by its wings. Buffalo
wings are frequently an excellent indi
cator of overall food quality — al
most everyone has them, but few
places do them well. The Oasis nearly
failed the test at the time of ordering,
asking if I wanted ranch or bleu
cheese. This is not simply a matter of

preference: there is a right and wrong
answer to this question, and to leave it
open to the customer instantly dis
credits the establishment. But the
wings turned out to be quite good,
providing the distinctive Buffalo-style
flavor, rather than some generic spicy
taste. They would have been better if
the flavor were a bit more in the chick
en than in the copious quantity of
sauce on the outside. But still, the
wings were a good attempt for the
west coast.
Finally, a discussion of the beer
garden can't be complete without at
least mentioning the beer. The atmos
phere is definitely excellent for hav
ing drinks — especially with a group.
The Oasis has a reasonable assort
ment available on tap, but nothing too
exotic, and, for a place that calls itself
a beer garden, I'd expect a little more.
Having a rundown interior alone
doesn't quite cut it.
The Oasis wasn't outstanding in
any particular way, but it was satisfy
ing. The prices are very reasonable,
and the food is good for the type of
place it is. One flaw was that the ser
vice, even for a place that doesn't wait
on you. was a little slow. But ulti
mately, the atmosphere is what
makes or breaks the place. For a real
ly relaxed classic pub atmosphere,
this is the place to be, but if you want
something chic or classy, look else
where.
