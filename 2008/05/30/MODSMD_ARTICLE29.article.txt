## "Rockferry" Rocks 
### KATIE TAYLOR INTERMISSION DUFFER 
Twenty-three-year-old Welsh singer-songwriter
Aimee Duffy, who has gone simply by Duffy since she
was 19, is reminiscent of her fellow Amy (Winehouse) in
many ways. She is all full-sounding '60s soul with an alt
pop twist. There are trumpets, trombones and piano,
complete with vamping, simple choruses and call and re
sponse (most of which, quite refreshingly, Duffy record
ed over her own lead vocals.)
But where Winehouse is, although wonderfully so,
rather pouty and melancholy, Duffy is walking-down-the
street-in-new-shoes pop. Duffy has the same power
house, emotion-laden vocals as her Brit counterpoint, but
overall her freshman album "Rockferry" is a softer,
calmer, less-intense listen. Even her first single off the
album, "Mercy," which spent five weeks atop the UK's
singles' charts, is a lamenting yet up-beat dance-mix
ready tune about the vulnerability of attraction. She
sings, "I don't know what you do/ but you do it well/ I'm
under your spell/ You got me begging you for mercy/ why
won't you release me."
In fact, Duffy sings rather happily about heartache and
love lost throughout the album, which expounds almost
exclusively on the dealings of the heart. Over the funky
meets-pop beat of "Serious" she asks, "I get a feeling
deep down inside/ something just ain't right/1 get a feel
ing I know/ baby, you never show/ how you really feel for
me/ tell me can we ever be/ serious?" "Hanging on Too
Long," which starts as a slower, despondent track about,
well, figuring out that you've hung on a little too long,
works itself into a layered, full-bodied, toe-tapping cho
rus.
"Warwick Avenue," which is the second single off her
album, also starts slowly, bass plucking along a riff
straight from your mom's "Best of the '60s" album. The
song builds slowly to an orchestral chorus, complete with
strings and dramatic, staccato pauses where Duffy's
tremendous vocals take center stage. The music video for
the song is quite literally one continuous shot of her in a
cab, as it drives away from Warwick Avenue, while she
cries and sings the song.
But I think that is also the appeal of Duffy — she of
fers an easy recipe for good music. Her album insert is
eight simple pages of black background with a selection
of lyrics printed in white. The cover is a black and white
shot of her face. (No black pleather leotard, with mouth
open and legs spread.) And her music is a recognizable,
well-sung, well-played, well-written blend of good ol'
school funk and a modern sensibility for alt-pop. The
lyrics are unfussy, but then again it is refreshing to not
have to ponder over seemingly impenetrable verses or be
hit over the head with life-altering poetics.
And Duffy mixes it up. Put on your most recently pur
chased foot apparel and walk it out to "Mercy," "Seri
ous," "Delayed Devotion" and "Distant Dreamer."
Then slow it down, and seduce the apple of your eye with
"Syrup and Honey" or "I'm Scared." The two bonus
tracks to the album are indeed bonuses — they have lost
the funk influence of the album, and instead offer a more
modern, minimalist and uncomplicated approach that
make you lean in and listen closer, and then wish you had
the voice this girl does.
The first bonus song, "Save it For Your Prayers," is an
elegant piano and vocals song about leaving a love, while
"Oh Boy" is an equally unadorned song about waiting for
The One. With only acoustic guitar, Duffy's crystal clear
voice, and harmonizing back-up singers, Duffy croons.

"But if I find my feet/ down on lonely street, I'll be stand
ing there waiting for you/ hoy you got me."
And if there is anything more appealing than straight
forward, good music, it is a down-to-earth girl to sing it.
Duffy, whose first language is Welsh, grew up in a town
with fewer than 3000 people, and is as humble as any slice
of pie. About the title of her first album, she said, "Rock
ferry does exist. But I didn't write it about the actual
place. I wrote 'Rockferry' from the perspective that it's a
place everyone is trying to go if they are sort of struggling
with something. It is the place that ultimately everyone is
trying to get to in some form or way in their life." And
whether we ever get to that place or not, at least we will
have some from-the-heart tunes to listen to on our way.
