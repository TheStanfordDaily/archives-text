# Golf in eighth AT CHAMPIONSHIP
## Stanford needs top 15 finish today to advance to final round 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After two rounds of play at the single most
important and competitive tournament in the
nation, the No. 6 Stanford men's golf team is in
eighth place at the 2008 NCAA Men's Golf
Championship at the Kampen Course on the
Purdue University campus. Stanford only
needs to finish in the top 15 for today's round
in order to qualify for the fourth and final
round of the competition.
Stanford improved its score by 21 strokes
yesterday, giving the team a 21-over total of
597 which helped them climb up four spots on
the leaderboard heading into today's final
qualifying round. Hard-hitting winds helped
to put the Cardinal in the rough during the
first round: however, the second round's warm
and sunny weather placed the Stanford ball
back on track as was reflected in yesterday's
scores.
Stanford is currently only eight strokes
back from No. 10 Clemson, which sits in first
place at 13-over 589. Both Clemson and Stan
ford had the best rounds in the tournament,
scoring even par on the day. Clemson's even
par score in the second helped them to climb
four spots over the now-second place team,
N0.5 UCLA, and the third place team. No. 1
Southern California. Rounding out the top
