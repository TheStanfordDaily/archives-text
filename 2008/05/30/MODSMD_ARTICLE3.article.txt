# Golf in eighth AT CHAMPIONSHIP
## Stanford needs top 15 finish today to advance to final round 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After two rounds of play at the single most
important and competitive tournament in the
nation, the No. 6 Stanford men's golf team is in
eighth place at the 2008 NCAA Men's Golf
Championship at the Kampen Course on the
Purdue University campus. Stanford only
needs to finish in the top 15 for today's round
in order to qualify for the fourth and final
round of the competition.
Stanford improved its score by 21 strokes
yesterday, giving the team a 21-over total of
597 which helped them climb up four spots on
the leaderboard heading into today's final
qualifying round. Hard-hitting winds helped
to put the Cardinal in the rough during the
first round: however, the second round's warm
and sunny weather placed the Stanford ball
back on track as was reflected in yesterday's
scores.
Stanford is currently only eight strokes
back from No. 10 Clemson, which sits in first
place at 13-over 589. Both Clemson and Stan
ford had the best rounds in the tournament,
scoring even par on the day. Clemson's even
par score in the second helped them to climb
four spots over the now-second place team,
N0.5 UCLA, and the third place team. No. 1
Southern California. Rounding out the top

5/30-6/1 West Lafayette, Ind.
NOTES: Looking to defend its title from last year, Stanford
is currently in eighth place at the NCAA Champi
onships. The team is 21 -over par bat is still within strik
ing range, only eight strokes from the No. 10 Clemson
Tigers who sit in first place. Stanford has been led by
senior Rob Grube, who is in 13th place after shooting a
three-under 69 yesterday.
five are N0.7 Florida and No. 4 Oklahoma
State.
Senior captain and No. 22 Rob Grube is
showing the nation that he wants to end his
collegiate career with a bang as he leads the

team going into today's third round of play.
Grube struggled in the first round, posting a six
over 78 on the day but regained his foeus to fire
the best Cardinal round of the day with a three
under par 69 to put him in 13th going into
today's play.
"I hit it really well today,so it was pretty low
stress," Grube told GoStanford.com. "I hit 15
greens and a lot of fairways, which around this
place is really nice. The rough is really penal. I
hit some good putts, 1 made all the ones I should
have but 1 definitely left some out there, but
that's going to happen."
Just two strokes behind Grube is No. 6 fresh
man Sihwan Kim who is in an eight-way tie for
24th in his first NCAA Championship tourna
ment. Kim has consistently played well, proving
his score with each day from a five-over 77 in
the first to an even par 72 in the second round.
After his second round performance, Kim
jumped a whole 29 spots to claim his stake in
the tie for 24th.
Next up is sophomore Jordan Cox who has
launched himself 55 spots up the individual lad
der to a tie for 32nd after the second round. Cox
also struggled due to the high winds of the first
round as he shot a seven-over 79. The sunny,
calm weather from the second round allowed
him to focus on his play; he shot three birdies to
earn himself a one-under par 71 for the day.
Junior Dodge Kemmer remained in a tie for
70th with a 10-over score of 154 after two days
of tough competition. He earned a six-over 78
for day one then posted a four-over 76 for day
two.
Rounding out the Stanford five is freshman
Steve Ziegler. Ziegler started his first NCAA
Championship strong, leading his teammates
after day one with a four-over 76 putting him in
a tie for 40th. Ziegler couldn't hang on to his
lead and fell into a tie for 85th place yesterday
after recording a seven-over 79.
Yesterday's weather proved to be much
more conducive to the Cardinal's success on

the course. The Cardinal started off the tourna
ment in 12th place but came to the course ready
to get back in the game, earning its eighth-place
standing going into today's rounds.
"I hit 15 greens
and a lot of
fairways."

"I think in our meeting last night, the vibe
was really positive," head coach Conrad Ray
told GoStanford.com. "I felt like the guys, we
all kind of understood that the back nine is the
hardest nine and they may have some trouble.
We played the front nine great yesterday and
just hit a few balls out of play and it got away
from us a little bit. We talked a bit last night
about how our goal was just to get past through
this back nine, and we were able to do that."
Stanford has its work cut out for itself for the
rest of the tournament, but for such a young
team, the Cardinal is definitely making an im
pression on the national stage. With just one
more qualifying round to go, Stanford must stay
within the top 15 teams in order to have the
chance to defend its NCAA crown.

standing going into today's rounds.

"I think in our meeting last night, the vibe
was really positive," head coach Conrad Ray
told GoStanford.com. "I felt like the guys, we
all kind of understood that the back nine is the
hardest nine and they may have some trouble.
We played the front nine great yesterday and
just hit a few balls out of play and it got away
from us a little bit. We talked a bit last night
about how our goal was just to get past through
this back nine, and we were able to do that."
Stanford has its work cut out for itself for the
rest of the tournament, but for such a young
team, the Cardinal is definitely making an im
pression on the national stage. With just one
more qualifying round to go, Stanford must stay
within the top 15 teams in order to have the
chance to defend its NCAA crown.
