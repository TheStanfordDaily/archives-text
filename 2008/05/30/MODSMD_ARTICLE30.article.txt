## THE 						LANIES' NIGHT OF THE SUMMER 
### 
Ladies, dust off your Manolos and prepare for the ultimate girls' night out because the "Sex and the City" movie is the perfect friend date. Sarah Jes
sica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon return as Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. As expected, there is plenty of sex and
fashion; the movie, however, has a more subdued tone than the show, as the women struggle with difficulties in their relationships with their partners and
each other.
For the first hour the girls are happy and Carrie's upcoming nuptials to John "Mr. Big" Prescott (played by Chris Noth) take center stage. Of course
Carrie's wedding would not be complete without the perfect dress, and Carrie poses for Vogue as a 40-year-old bride in different gowns from Balencia
ga, Vivienne Westwood, Christian Lacroix, Oscar de la Renta and Karl Lagerfeld, among others. Meanwhile, Samantha has moved to Hollywood to
manage the career of her hottie Smith (Jason Lewis); Miranda and Steve (David Eigenberg) are still living in Brooklyn with their son; and Charlotte is
in domestic bliss with her Jewish husband. Harry (Fvan Handler), and their adopted daughter I ilv

After re-introducing the characters, the problems seemingly strike all at once. What begins as a
simple wedding in a label-less dress quickly spirals into something beyond what Carrie and Big
L ever em isioned. causing Big to question their motives for matrimony. Miranda's marriage is
far from perfect, and the lack of sex has led to a certain indiscretion. Samantha's newneigh
