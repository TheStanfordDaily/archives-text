# Opening contest is a catchers' showcase
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's opening match against UC-Davis is
being billed as contest between two of the best
catchers in the nation: the Cardinal's Jason Castro
and the Aggies' Jake Jeffries.
Both lead their respective teams in batting aver
age while posting high on base and slugging per
centages. Both have started every game their teams
have played. And, more than that, both call games
effectively and display good defense behind the
plate.
While their offense is apparent throw statistics,
their game management is more intangible — but
is just as important. They are responsible for utiliz
ing the strengths of a vast range of pitchers and, to
a certain extent, mentoring them from 60 feet away.
Castro in particular has been credited with aiding
the development of the Cardinal's young pitching
staff.
"I work closely with pitching coach Jeff Austin
to exploit holes in different situations," said Castro,
a junior.
For their efforts in all facets of the game, Jeffries
was named co-Big West Player of the Year, and
Castro was selected as one of 12 semifinalists for
the Johnny Bench Award, given to the best catcher
in collegiate baseball.
"Both of them are very good athletes," said UC-
Davis coach Rex Peters. "When you look at what
they have accomplished and the numbers that they
have produced offensively, it is pretty impressive.
Jason Castro is more of power type hitter than Jake
Jeffries is here. Jake is more of a line-drive, gap to
gap. hit for average, type hitter. Both are very good
defensively."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess had nothing but
praise for Jeffries. The junior has progressed each
season but has broken out in 2(H)8, batting close to
.400 in the process.
"He's a great player," said Marquess. "He and
Castro are two of the best catchers in baseball."
Their performances have not only helped their
squads but have opened the eyes of major league
scouts as well. Castro is currently projected as a
first round pick in next week's MLB Draft,and Jef
fries has been ranked amongst the top 100
prospects by various scouting services.
"[They] have drawn a lot of interest from scouts
this year," said Peters.
But the accolades and projections
haven't fazed Castro — his foeus is sole
ly on the College Baseball Champi
onships.
"Tliat can take care of itself when it
does," he said.
For now. he is Stanford's catcher and
field leader, and he and his UC-Davis
counterpart will be major players in
their team's success this weekend and
beyond.
