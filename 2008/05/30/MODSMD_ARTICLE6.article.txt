## Journalists report on 2008 election Reporters share stories from campaign trail 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For New York Times reporter Adam
Nagourney, the current presidential cam
paign is not just unprecedented because of
the historical implications of the election.
"This has been the most complicated
race I've ever covered," he said.
Nagourney joined four other journalists
from top-tier national news sources at
Stanford last night to discuss the 2008 pres
idential campaign.
Stanford's Department of
Communication sponsored "The Press and
the Presidency: Covering Campaign 2008,"
last night at the Kresge Auditorium. In
addition to Nagourney. the event featured
Dan Balz of the Washington Post.

Elizabeth Bumiller of The New York Times,
Anne Kornblut of the Washington Post and
Walter Shapiro of Salon.com in a discus
sion moderated by Communication Chair
James Fishkin.
Fishkin opened the two-hour plus event
marking the 42nd annual Carlos Kelly
McClatchy Memorial Symposium by intro
ducing the panelists and mentioning many
of the reasons why the 2008 campaign has
drawn great interest.
"In this highly unprecedented environ

"These are the people who have more
power than they'd like to admit."
Discussion revolved around covering
presumptive Republican nominee John

you legitimately cover a political phenome

fact that he's a phenomenon?"
'The reporters'also focused on the chal
lenges for Senator McCain in defining him
self during the general election.
"He's still making a very difficult transi
tion from independent or maverick — I've
stopped using the labels — to the standard
bearer for the Republican party," Bumiller

said.
In speculating about the general elec
tion, the reporters shared the issues they
would follow most closely. Some weighed
in upon the issue of Senator Obama's race
as an area to follow closely if he faces
McCain in November.
"All the trends in a normal election year
would say a Democrat will win,"
Nagourney said. "But race is an unknown.
I'm not sure how to measure it, and I'm not
sure if the polls measure it."
"I guess the big question for this elec

tion is: is Barack Obama JFK. who hits
after the prejudices have eroded?" Shapiro
said, referring to President Kennedy's
Catholic heritage. "Or is he Al Smith, who
was nominated before the prejudices erod
ed?"
Shapiro highlighted the prominence of
prediction and speculation in campaign
coverage.
"We have been awash in meaningless
national polls," Shapiro said. "One of the
