## Journalists report on 2008 election Reporters share stories from campaign trail 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For New York Times reporter Adam
Nagourney, the current presidential cam
paign is not just unprecedented because of
the historical implications of the election.
"This has been the most complicated
race I've ever covered," he said.
Nagourney joined four other journalists
from top-tier national news sources at
Stanford last night to discuss the 2008 pres
idential campaign.
Stanford's Department of
Communication sponsored "The Press and
the Presidency: Covering Campaign 2008,"
last night at the Kresge Auditorium. In
addition to Nagourney. the event featured
Dan Balz of the Washington Post.

Elizabeth Bumiller of The New York Times,
Anne Kornblut of the Washington Post and
Walter Shapiro of Salon.com in a discus
sion moderated by Communication Chair
James Fishkin.
Fishkin opened the two-hour plus event
marking the 42nd annual Carlos Kelly
McClatchy Memorial Symposium by intro
ducing the panelists and mentioning many
of the reasons why the 2008 campaign has
drawn great interest.
"In this highly unprecedented environ
ment, the media keeps score," Fishkin said.
"These are the people who have more
power than they'd like to admit."
Discussion revolved around covering
presumptive Republican nominee John
McCain and Democratic primary candi
dates Senator Barack Obama and Senator

Hillary Clinton.
"I think Obama has presented a particu
lar challenge for us," Balz said. "How do
you legitimately cover a political phenome
non? How do you intelligently cover the
fact that he's a phenomenon?"
'The reporters'also focused on the chal
lenges for Senator McCain in defining him
self during the general election.
"He's still making a very difficult transi
tion from independent or maverick — I've
stopped using the labels — to the standard
bearer for the Republican party," Bumiller

said.
In speculating about the general elec
tion, the reporters shared the issues they
would follow most closely. Some weighed
in upon the issue of Senator Obama's race
as an area to follow closely if he faces
McCain in November.
"All the trends in a normal election year
would say a Democrat will win,"
Nagourney said. "But race is an unknown.
I'm not sure how to measure it, and I'm not
sure if the polls measure it."
"I guess the big question for this elec

tion is: is Barack Obama JFK. who hits
after the prejudices have eroded?" Shapiro
said, referring to President Kennedy's
Catholic heritage. "Or is he Al Smith, who
was nominated before the prejudices erod
ed?"
Shapiro highlighted the prominence of
prediction and speculation in campaign
coverage.
"We have been awash in meaningless
national polls," Shapiro said. "One of the

things that has really undermined
the seriousness of this very impor
tant campaign is that so much has
been spent predicting things that
didn't happen."
The reporters also noted that
recent weeks have seen the race
become increasingly stagnant.
"The race has been stuck in
amber ever since Pennsylvania,"
Shapiro said.
After a question from Fishkin
regarding whether the public
received mostly "junk food" from
the media, the reporters weighed in
on the concern that campaign cov
erage is excessively trivial and
emphasized that the focus on two
Democratic candidates with similar
policies has marginalized some pol
icy discussions.
"I think people know the basic
position of all these candidates,"
Nagourney said.
"We're going to have really sub
stantive debates in the fall,"
Bumiller added.
Two of the panelists, Kornblut
and Bumiller, also shared their
experiences reporting with a focus
on specific candidates. Kornblut
follows Senator Clinton for the
Post, while Bumiller covers Senator
McCain for the Times.
"Being assigned to one of these
candidates is like getting a Ph.D. in
them," Kornblut said.
"For me, after covering the Bush
White House, I found the accessi
bility of the candidate absolutely
debilitating," Bumiller said. "I had
no time to write."
The reporters also pointed out
other storylines heading into the
fall, especially if Senator Obama
becomes the Democratic nominee.
"I'll be curious [to see) where
the Hillary Clinton voters go."
Kornblut said.
"And it's going to be fun to
watch them in the Senate," she
added, referring to the fact that the
two eventual nominees will be
sharing time on Capitol Hill
despite the campaign.
Speaking about Senator
McCain, Bumiller pointed to a cru
cial upcoming challenge, especially
in an unfavorable climate for
Republicans.

"The big question to look for is
whether he can succeed straddling
the left, right, and center," Bumiller
said. "(Within his campaign] they
are hoping he will set himself apart
from the congressional races."
"1 also think this year the vice
president choices will really mat
ter." she added.
Speaking with The Daily after
the event, Balz said the panel had
provided a reminder of a crucial
component of journalism.
"To get questions from an audi

ence like this is a reminder of some
of the responsibility you have,"
Balz said. "Our goal ought to be to
ask and try [to] answer the big
questions of this campaign."
"That was the subtext of most
of the questions," he added. "How
can you provide us with an even
better understanding of the choice
we can make? How can we count
on you?"

Reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post and Salon.com took a break from the campaign trail to offer their perspectives on the
2008 presidential election during the 42nd annual Carlos Kelly McClatchy Memorial Symposium held last night at Kresge auditorium.
things that has really undermined
the seriousness of this very impor
tant campaign is that so much has
been spent predicting things that
didn't happen."
The reporters also noted that
recent weeks have seen the race
become increasingly stagnant.
"The race has been stuck in
amber ever since Pennsylvania,"
Shapiro said.
After a question from Fishkin
regarding whether the public
received mostly "junk food" from
the media, the reporters weighed in
on the concern that campaign cov
erage is excessively trivial and
emphasized that the focus on two
Democratic candidates with similar
policies has marginalized some pol
icy discussions.
"I think people know the basic
position of all these candidates,"
Nagourney said.
"We're going to have really sub
stantive debates in the fall,"
Bumiller added.
Two of the panelists, Kornblut
and Bumiller, also shared their
experiences reporting with a focus
on specific candidates. Kornblut
follows Senator Clinton for the
Post, while Bumiller covers Senator
McCain for the Times.
"Being assigned to one of these
candidates is like getting a Ph.D. in
them," Kornblut said.
"For me, after covering the Bush
White House, I found the accessi
bility of the candidate absolutely
debilitating," Bumiller said. "I had
no time to write."
The reporters also pointed out
other storylines heading into the
fall, especially if Senator Obama
becomes the Democratic nominee.
"I'll be curious [to see) where
the Hillary Clinton voters go."
Kornblut said.
"And it's going to be fun to
watch them in the Senate," she
added, referring to the fact that the
two eventual nominees will be
sharing time on Capitol Hill
despite the campaign.
Speaking about Senator
McCain, Bumiller pointed to a cru
cial upcoming challenge, especially
in an unfavorable climate for
Republicans.

"The big question to look for is
whether he can succeed straddling
the left, right, and center," Bumiller
said. "(Within his campaign] they
are hoping he will set himself apart
from the congressional races."
"1 also think this year the vice
president choices will really mat
ter." she added.
Speaking with The Daily after
the event, Balz said the panel had
provided a reminder of a crucial
component of journalism.
"To get questions from an audi

ence like this is a reminder of some
of the responsibility you have,"
Balz said. "Our goal ought to be to
ask and try [to] answer the big
questions of this campaign."
"That was the subtext of most
of the questions," he added. "How
can you provide us with an even
better understanding of the choice
we can make? How can we count
on you?"
