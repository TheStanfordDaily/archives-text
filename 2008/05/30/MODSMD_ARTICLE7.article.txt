# SCANDAL ROCKS DAILY OFFICE
## TORRES TAKES PENGUIN, 29-0 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
Christian Torres '09 trounced
Jules R. Penguin by a 29 - 0 margin
during last night's editor-in-chief
election, hut the bird did not go
down quietly. Reports suggest that
Jules pulled all the "R" keys off the
office keyboards in protest, and stole
the office couch, which he claimed
held "personal significance."
With 29 ballots in, the election
was too close to call. Jules tried to
request that votes from fired staffers
count, and he was eventually award
ed half of those votes by outgoing
Editor-in-Chief Julie Klein' 09. Klein
had declared Jules' victory after only
the second vote, even though Jules
contested that "James Hohmann's
vote should count super extra spe
cial."
But Torres' victory celebration
may not last long. Rumors have
begun to circulate that Torres has
been implicated in a number of
office scandals.
"I just went in to do my business,"
said Desk Editor Theo
Milonopoulos '09 of a trip to the
bathroom last week. "Suddenly, this
foot reached across the stall and
tapped mine."
"I ran out of there, pants down. I
haven't been to the bathroom since,"
he added, bouncing up and down.
Desk Editor Devin Banerjee '11
also said that Torres began corre
sponding with him via instant mes
sager prior to his coming to Stanford
this past fall, requesting that
Banerjee serve as a Daily page.
"He IMed me and asked,' Where
does the '11' in 'devinll' come
from?"' Banerjee said. "That's not
something I'm really comfortable
talking about in public."
Torres has fervently denied the
allegations.
"It's really just a conspiracy to
smear my good name led by James
Hohmann," Torres said. "He's just
jealous that, if you took out the inspi
rational quotes, my platform is
longer than his if you know what I
mean."
Despite his claims touting both
his innocence and his ethics, other

sources suggest that he has paid a
high-priced manatee to accompany
him on dinner dates.
"I only know him as Client 9,"
said an anonymous female manatee.
"He was very soft and cuddly when I
held him under my flipper, but I
promise, we're just friends."
Jules is calling for Torres' immedi
ate resignation if any ethical viola
tions have been committed.
"I'm appalled that C. L. Torres
would behave in this manner, partic
ularly towards a fellow creature of
the sea," he said. "And if that boy
"My platform
is longer than
his, if you
know what
I mean."

Vol. 234 Editor-in-Chief
tapped his foot at me, I'd peck it
right off."
In his darkest hour, a loyal band
of supporters are sticking by Torres.
Several staffers spotted a mysterious
stain on Andrea Fuller's skirt, but
the managing editor was hesitant to
make any direct accusations of mis
conduct.
"I think it might be ketchup," she
said, emerging from the photo closet.
Jules said he's relishing in the
drama.
"I find it funny that Torres thinks
he can seduce and scandalize his way
to the top," Jules said. "Let's face it:
this beak can do things no man can."
