## Credits may not reduce emissions 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
As Congress gears up to debate regula
tions of greenhouse gas emissions next
week, a study by two Stanford Law School
faculty members published last month has
cast doubt on the effectiveness of a pro
gram that offers carbon credits to indus
tries to reduce emissions.
Research conducted by Law Prof.
David Victor and Law Lecturer Michael
Wara revealed that a substantial fraction
of the international carbon offset market
does not actually represent real reductions
in emissions. Many companies involved

are claiming credits for emission reduction
activities that they would have otherwise
pursued without the added incentive of
carbon credits. This practice results in few,
if any, net reductions in emissions, accord
ing to the researchers.
Published last month through the
Program on Energy and Sustainable
Development at the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, Wara
and Victor's new working paper, entitled
"A Realistic Policy on International
Carbon Offsets," investigates the world's
largest offset market — the Kyoto
Protocol Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) — and found an urgent need for

reform. Victor and Wara hope their
research on international carbon offsets
will convince Congress to pursue legisla
tion that will allow for a more effective
system for helping companies plan the
costs of complying with their carbon limits.
"We studied a scheme known as the
Clean Development Mechanism, which is
part of the Kyoto treaty on global warm
ing," said Victor, who serves as director of
the Program on Energy and Sustainable
Development. "We found that a large frac
tion of the market credits from that
scheme were not, in fact, real reductions in

emissions."
"This study has worrying impli
cations for the planet," Victor
added. "It means that the current
strategies for taming the volcano of
emissions from the developing
world are not working."
Victor and Wara's paper exam
ined 3,000 projects applying for or
already granted up to $10 billion of
credits from the UN's CDM funds
over the next four years. The
authors concludcd that the majority
should not be considered for assis
tance because, according to Victor,
"they would have been built any
way." Their research also states that
between one to two-thirds of the
total CDM offsets do not represent
actual emission cuts.
"The toughest energy problem
for the coming half century will be
slowing global warming," Victor
said. "Developing countries are key
to that because their emissions are
rising so rapidly, and the world must
find a market-friendly way to
encouraging those countries to cut
emissions."
Although the CDM has been
widely viewed as vital to the reduc
tion of global greenhouse gas emis
sions, the researchers' findings sug
gested that the actual experience
under the CDM has had perverse
effects in developing countries.
Rather than draw them into sub
stantial limits on emissions, the
CDM unintentionally rewarded
them for avoiding exactly those
commitments.
The researchers found that the
CDM was routinely abused by
chemical, wind, gas and hydro com
panies who claimed emission reduc
tion credits for projects that should
not qualify. To earn credits under
the CDM, emission reductions must
be in addition to those that would
have taken place without the proj
ect. The requirement of "additional
ly." however, was difficult to prove
and therefore resulted in wide

spread abuse of the CDM.
As a result of these abuses, the
researchers found an absence of
genuine pollution cuts, which in turn
undermined U.S. and other govern
ments' assurances that carbon mar
kets are dramatically reducing
greenhouse gases.
Law Prof. John Barton said that
Victor and Wara's research on car
bon credits is important for the
future of the carbon trading market.
"The importance [of their
research] is that the emissions-trad
ing process is our working substi
tute for a carbon tax, which would
economically be the most straight
forward way of creating appropriate
incentives to reduce CO2 emis
sions," Barton said. "As a political
matter, we will probably use an
emission trading process rather
than a carbon tax in any post-Kyoto
agreement. Hence, we need to make
it work well."
Victor said that the U.S. should
not to rely on offsets to provide a
reliable ceiling on compliance costs
or impose offset caps when design
ing the national regulatory system.
"Many companies are hoping to
get large numbers of these interna
tional 'offset' credits, the generic
term for the CDM, and use them to
comply with the looming require
ment to cut emissions here at home
in the U. 5.," Victor said. "Congress
is debating this legislation starting
next Monday. If you tighten up the
offset market then fewer credits will
be available. And given that, we sug
gest that Congress pursue a differ
ent and much more transparent and
effective system for helping compa
nies plan the cost of complying with
their carbon limits."
Law Prof. Alan Sykes agreed.
"Assuming the analysis is cor
rect, [this research] leads to serious
doubts about the Kyoto Clean
Development Mechanism and its
ability to lower carbon emissions
effectively," Sykes said. "The sug
gestion that the United States
should be careful not to repeat its
flaws seems wise."
