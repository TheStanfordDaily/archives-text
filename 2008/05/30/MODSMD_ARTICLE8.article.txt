## Credits may not reduce emissions 
### SALONE KAPUR STAFF WRITER 
As Congress gears up to debate regula
tions of greenhouse gas emissions next
week, a study by two Stanford Law School
faculty members published last month has
cast doubt on the effectiveness of a pro
gram that offers carbon credits to indus
tries to reduce emissions.
Research conducted by Law Prof.
David Victor and Law Lecturer Michael
Wara revealed that a substantial fraction
of the international carbon offset market
does not actually represent real reductions
in emissions. Many companies involved

are claiming credits for emission reduction
activities that they would have otherwise
pursued without the added incentive of
carbon credits. This practice results in few,
if any, net reductions in emissions, accord
ing to the researchers.
Published last month through the
Program on Energy and Sustainable
Development at the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, Wara
and Victor's new working paper, entitled
"A Realistic Policy on International
Carbon Offsets," investigates the world's
largest offset market — the Kyoto
Protocol Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) — and found an urgent need for

reform. Victor and Wara hope their
research on international carbon offsets
will convince Congress to pursue legisla
tion that will allow for a more effective
system for helping companies plan the
costs of complying with their carbon limits.
"We studied a scheme known as the
Clean Development Mechanism, which is
part of the Kyoto treaty on global warm
ing," said Victor, who serves as director of
the Program on Energy and Sustainable
Development. "We found that a large frac
tion of the market credits from that
scheme were not, in fact, real reductions in
