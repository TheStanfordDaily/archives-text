University Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'82 presented Stanford's annual budget report
for the 2008-2009 fiscal year at the Faculty
Senate meeting yesterday afternoon.
"The University is stronger than it's ever
been," Etchemendy told faculty, referring to
record-low admission rates, high endowment
returns and successful fundraising. The Stanford
Challenge, a fundraising drive launched last
year, has brought in $3 billion in pledged dona
tions.
Stanford is in good financial shape for the
coming year, Etchemendy said. The University is
projecting $3.8 billion in revenues and faces $3.5
billion in costs, yielding a surplus of $130 million
after transfers.
Despite the good news, Etchemendy cau
tioned that challenges remain.
"My message this year is, "Don't get compla
cent,'" he said.
"When we are finished,
we will have an
infrastructure second
to none."

Etchemendy pointed to a continuing decline
in federal research funding, which has been the
largest source of University revenue for every
year since World War 11. Next year, investment
income from Stanford's endowment — which is
currently valued at more than $17 billion — will
eclipse federal research grants to become the
largest single source of University funding.
Just under $1 billion of University revenues
are general funds, money that can be used for
any purpose. The rest of the budget is already
allocated in the form of research grants, gifts for
specific purposes or auxiliary programs like ath
letics and Residential and Dining Enterprises.
General funds, which consist primarily of
tuition income, money for indirect research costs
and endowment income that was not allocated
for specific purposes by the donor, will be "tight"
in the next five years, according to Etchemendy.
"We have to use [general funds] for our high
est priority, and that is faculty competitiveness,"
Etchemendy said. "We are primarily a people
enterprise."
Attracting and retaining faculty and staff is
the single biggest financial priority at Stanford.
Etchemendy said. About 52 percent of the
University's consolidated expenses next year
will go to salaries and benefits, and 67 percent of
general funds will be used for salaries.
