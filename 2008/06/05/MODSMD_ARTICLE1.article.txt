Stanford Law School faculty voted last week to
drop the school's letter grade system in favor of
an honors, pass, restricted credit or no credit sys
tem. Stanford will join Yale and Berkeley, among
other law schools, in eschewing traditional letter
grades.
The move was made to decrease excessive
competition among law students, a source of sig
nificant stress.
"One of the things we are trying to encourage
is [that] students shouldn't try to distinguish
themselves for no good reason at all," Dean Larry
Kramer told The Daily. "There's incredible

"The reform will have significant pedagogical
benefits, including that it encourages greater flex

Kramer wrote in an email to law students.
Eliminating letter grades may also stop law stu
dents from structuring their course schedules to
boost GPAs.
In the letter grade system, core doctrinal cours
es are usually taught "on-mean" and curved based
on a mean score, while most seminars are taught
"off-mean." Students seeking summer associate
positions could artificially boost their GPAs by
putting off the doctrinal classes until the third year
and taking more "off-mean" courses earlier on.

Stanford one step away

The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after
game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."

Potential football recruit killed in shooting
By THEO MILONOPOULOS
DESK EDITOR
Stanford Football had contacted the
coach of Los Angeles High School earlier
this year to inquire about 17-year-old
Jamiel Shaw, a star running back whose ath
letic abilities had earned him the distinction
of the Southern League's most valuable
player during his junior year.
About a week or two later, Jamiel was
shot dead just a few doors away from his
home.
Jamiel Shaw, Sr. said his son was return
ing home from a shopping mall on March 2
when a Latino man opened fire from a
nearby car.
Jamiel Sr. said he heard the gunshots
crack through the air and ran out to find his
son bleeding on the ground. Jamiel was
transported to the hospital, where he was
later pronounced dead.
"It was the worst feeling," Jamiel Sr. said
of his son's passing. "You're just stuck in
grief mode, and you can't get out of it. You
can't control your thinking. You just go

Los Angeles Police Department officers
arrested Pedro Espinoza on March 14 in

said Espinoza is allegedly a member of the
18th Street gang in Los Angeles and had
been released from jail on weapons charges
just one day before the shooting.
Authorities said Shaw was not a gang
member and called the shooting a random,
unprovoked gang attack.
Jamiel Sr. was dedicated to making sure
his son would make all the right decisions.
He said he had made an "18-year-plan" for
his son that would help him stay out of trou
ble and put him on a path to a bright future.
"If you stay out of trouble, mixed with
sports, with good grades, you're going to
make it," Jamiel Sr. said.

Shaw to stand
by standards
Coaches cite cooperation, teams win despite high
academic admission criteria
By PATRICK FITZGERALD
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean
of admission. The ball marks Stanford
football's dramatic 24-23 upset win over
the University of Southern California
last fall, which, the Cardinal faithful
hope, may indicate the beginning of a
new era in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play
a crucial role. Stanford is unique among
universities nationwide for its balance
of success in the classroom and on the
playing field. Yet for many, the admis
sion office is responsible for precluding
success in high profile sports such as
football and basketball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the
University this year, said he would not
compromise Stanford's stringent
admission standards in the name of ath
letic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of
values."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be high
er. Coaches complain when they can't
get their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all." he
continued. "If that means somebody
else might, that's the way it is. But we're
not somebody else, we're Stanford. 1
have no apologies for the place this is."
It's not that Shaw doesn't want to
win. He called the Cardinal's soon-to
be streak of 14 straight Director's Cups
"mind-boggling." And. of course, there
is the commemorative football in the
office.
"Do I like to win?" Shaw said.
"Yeah, 1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of
Colorado, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Michigan, Shaw under
stands the needs of winning athletic
departments. Shaw, who came from
Yale in 2005, was preceded by Robin
Mamlet, who came from Swarthmore
in 2000 — a liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania that had a Division 111
athletic program.
This past year has been one of the
most successful in recent years for the
larger men's sports like football, basket
ball and baseball. One reason is a small
sample size, but coaches and athletes
say the admission office has become
more cooperative since Shaw took over
in 2<X)5.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've
understood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery. "He looks real hard to
find a way to help, as compared to ... "
he said, trailing off.
"It's easy to say no." Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about deal
ing with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit
that he has worked to establish stronger
lines of communication with the athlet
ics department.
"In general, the goal is to have good
relationships with all segments of cam
pus." he said. "1 think we've established
good relations with [Athletic Director]
Bob Bowlsby."

Fewer Stanford students are going to the emer

vious years, according to statistics provided by the
Stanford University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) and Vaden Health Center. But many of the
cases reported this year involve not only freshmen but
also upperclassmen and graduate students.
The statistics also indicate that the number of
Stanford students cited by SUDPS for underage drink
ing has increased and that fewer Stanford students are
being cited for driving under the influence on campus.
ALCOHOL POISONING
Thirty-five cases of alcohol poisoning that required
transportation to an emergency room have occurred
on campus this year as of late May, according to Ralph
J. Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse Prevention
Program at Vaden Health Center.
Castro said the number of these alcohol poisoning
incidents has been decreasing dramatically since the
2004-2005 academic year, when 1 l l > cases were report
ed. Ninety-three cases of alcohol poisoning were doc

A commemorative football sits on a

football's dramatic 24-23 upset win over
the University of Southern California
last fall, which, the Cardinal faithful
hope, may indicate the beginning of a
new era in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play
a crucial role. Stanford is unique among

"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still

Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the

compromise Stanford's stringent
admission standards in the name of ath

"It's important to maintain stan

is a huge concern. But we have lots of

Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be high

"We're not going to get them all." he
continued. "If that means somebody

It's not that Shaw doesn't want to

"mind-boggling." And. of course, there

"Do I like to win?" Shaw said.
"Yeah, 1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of
Colorado, UC-Berkeley and the

departments. Shaw, who came from
Yale in 2005, was preceded by Robin

Pennsylvania that had a Division 111
athletic program.
This past year has been one of the

larger men's sports like football, basket
ball and baseball. One reason is a small
sample size, but coaches and athletes
say the admission office has become

Fewer Stanford students are going to the emer

Stanford University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) and Vaden Health Center. But many of the
cases reported this year involve not only freshmen but
also upperclassmen and graduate students.
The statistics also indicate that the number of
Stanford students cited by SUDPS for underage drink

being cited for driving under the influence on campus.
ALCOHOL POISONING
Thirty-five cases of alcohol poisoning that required
transportation to an emergency room have occurred
on campus this year as of late May, according to Ralph

Castro said the number of these alcohol poisoning

Law school
drops letter
grade system
Farm joins Yale, Berkeley in

By NIKHIL JOSHI
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Stanford Law School faculty voted last week to
drop the school's letter grade system in favor of
an honors, pass, restricted credit or no credit sys
tem. Stanford will join Yale and Berkeley, among
other law schools, in eschewing traditional letter
grades.
The move was made to decrease excessive
competition among law students, a source of sig

"One of the things we are trying to encourage

"The reform will have significant pedagogical
benefits, including that it encourages greater flex
ibility and innovation in the classroom and in
designing metrics for evaluating student work,"
Kramer wrote in an email to law students.
Eliminating letter grades may also stop law stu
dents from structuring their course schedules to
boost GPAs.
In the letter grade system, core doctrinal cours
es are usually taught "on-mean" and curved based
on a mean score, while most seminars are taught
"off-mean." Students seeking summer associate
positions could artificially boost their GPAs by
putting off the doctrinal classes until the third year
and taking more "off-mean" courses earlier on.
"1 am glad that the new grading system will
eliminate this 'on-mean' and 'off-mean' system so
that students can feel free to take whatever class
es they are interested in," said Amanda Bonn J.D.

The jury is still out on whether or not the new
grading system will help or hinder law students in
their search for clerkships and jobs.

Class size

By ERIC MESSINGER
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Despite widespread campus discus

Stanford community should not expect
any decision in the near future, according
to University administrators taking part
in the decision-making process.
"This is not an imminent event," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman.
Though plans for formal expansion
may be far down the road —or may
never materialize at all — Stanford
recently experienced an unplanned class
size increase due to high yield in admis
sion cycles. This year's class of incoming
freshman will total approximately 1,727
students — about 57 more than the 1,670
target. And, at this time last year, 1,745 ini
tially signed with Stanford for the Class of
2011.
Initial interest in the idea arose with
University President John Hennessy's
column in the September/October issue
of Stanford magazine. Since January, the
pros and cons of expansion have been
examined by a task force, chaired by
Board of Trustees member Jim Canales

Stanford one step away
FROM COLLEGE WORLD SERIES

The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after
game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."
Friday: UC Davis 4, Stanford 2

OFF-CAMPUS
Potential football recruit killed in shooting
By THEO MILONOPOULOS
DESK EDITOR
Stanford Football had contacted the
coach of Los Angeles High School earlier
this year to inquire about 17-year-old
Jamiel Shaw, a star running back whose ath
letic abilities had earned him the distinction
of the Southern League's most valuable
player during his junior year.
About a week or two later, Jamiel was
shot dead just a few doors away from his
home.
Jamiel Shaw, Sr. said his son was return
ing home from a shopping mall on March 2
when a Latino man opened fire from a
nearby car.
Jamiel Sr. said he heard the gunshots
crack through the air and ran out to find his
son bleeding on the ground. Jamiel was
transported to the hospital, where he was
later pronounced dead.
"It was the worst feeling," Jamiel Sr. said
of his son's passing. "You're just stuck in
grief mode, and you can't get out of it. You
can't control your thinking. You just go
berserk."
Los Angeles Police Department officers
arrested Pedro Espinoza on March 14 in
connection with the shooting. Prosecutors
said Espinoza is allegedly a member of the
18th Street gang in Los Angeles and had
been released from jail on weapons charges
just one day before the shooting.
Authorities said Shaw was not a gang
member and called the shooting a random,
unprovoked gang attack.
Jamiel Sr. was dedicated to making sure
his son would make all the right decisions.
He said he had made an "18-year-plan" for
his son that would help him stay out of trou
ble and put him on a path to a bright future.

Kramer wrote in an email to law students.
Eliminating letter grades may also stop law stu
dents from structuring their course schedules to
boost GPAs.
In the letter grade system, core doctrinal cours
es are usually taught "on-mean" and curved based
on a mean score, while most seminars are taught
"off-mean." Students seeking summer associate
positions could artificially boost their GPAs by
putting off the doctrinal classes until the third year
and taking more "off-mean" courses earlier on.
"1 am glad that the new grading system will
eliminate this 'on-mean' and 'off-mean' system so
that students can feel free to take whatever class
es they are interested in," said Amanda Bonn J.D.
'09.
The jury is still out on whether or not the new
grading system will help or hinder law students in
their search for clerkships and jobs.
ADMINISTRATION
Class size
discussions
to continue
By ERIC MESSINGER
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Despite widespread campus discus
sion regarding class size expansion, the
Stanford community should not expect
any decision in the near future, according
to University administrators taking part
in the decision-making process.
"This is not an imminent event," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman.
Though plans for formal expansion
may be far down the road —or may
never materialize at all — Stanford
recently experienced an unplanned class
size increase due to high yield in admis
sion cycles. This year's class of incoming
freshman will total approximately 1,727
students — about 57 more than the 1,670
target. And, at this time last year, 1,745 ini
tially signed with Stanford for the Class of
2011.
Initial interest in the idea arose with
University President John Hennessy's
column in the September/October issue
of Stanford magazine. Since January, the
pros and cons of expansion have been
examined by a task force, chaired by
Board of Trustees member Jim Canales
'88 M.A. '89 and English Department
Chair Ramon Saldivar.
The task force has spent much of win
ter and spring quarters gathering flata and
feedback and will continue to examine

CARD ADVANCES
Stanford one step away
FROM COLLEGE WORLD SERIES
By DENIS GRIFFIN
DESK EDITOR
The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after
game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."

OFF-CAMPUS
Potential football recruit killed in shooting
By THEO MILONOPOULOS
DESK EDITOR
Stanford Football had contacted the
coach of Los Angeles High School earlier
this year to inquire about 17-year-old
Jamiel Shaw, a star running back whose ath
letic abilities had earned him the distinction
of the Southern League's most valuable
player during his junior year.
About a week or two later, Jamiel was
shot dead just a few doors away from his
home.
Jamiel Shaw, Sr. said his son was return
ing home from a shopping mall on March 2
when a Latino man opened fire from a
nearby car.
Jamiel Sr. said he heard the gunshots
crack through the air and ran out to find his
son bleeding on the ground. Jamiel was
transported to the hospital, where he was
later pronounced dead.
"It was the worst feeling," Jamiel Sr. said
of his son's passing. "You're just stuck in
grief mode, and you can't get out of it. You
can't control your thinking. You just go
berserk."
Los Angeles Police Department officers
arrested Pedro Espinoza on March 14 in
connection with the shooting. Prosecutors
said Espinoza is allegedly a member of the
18th Street gang in Los Angeles and had
been released from jail on weapons charges
just one day before the shooting.
Authorities said Shaw was not a gang
member and called the shooting a random,
unprovoked gang attack.
Jamiel Sr. was dedicated to making sure
his son would make all the right decisions.
He said he had made an "18-year-plan" for
his son that would help him stay out of trou
ble and put him on a path to a bright future.
"If you stay out of trouble, mixed with
sports, with good grades, you're going to
make it," Jamiel Sr. said.

by standards
Coaches cite cooperation, teams win despite high
academic admission criteria
By PATRICK FITZGERALD
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean
of admission. The ball marks Stanford
football's dramatic 24-23 upset win over
the University of Southern California
last fall, which, the Cardinal faithful
hope, may indicate the beginning of a
new era in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play
a crucial role. Stanford is unique among
universities nationwide for its balance
of success in the classroom and on the
playing field. Yet for many, the admis
sion office is responsible for precluding
success in high profile sports such as
football and basketball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the
University this year, said he would not
compromise Stanford's stringent
admission standards in the name of ath
letic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of
values."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be high
er. Coaches complain when they can't
get their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all." he
continued. "If that means somebody
else might, that's the way it is. But we're
not somebody else, we're Stanford. 1
have no apologies for the place this is."
It's not that Shaw doesn't want to
win. He called the Cardinal's soon-to
be streak of 14 straight Director's Cups
"mind-boggling." And. of course, there
is the commemorative football in the
office.
"Do I like to win?" Shaw said.
"Yeah, 1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of
Colorado, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Michigan, Shaw under
stands the needs of winning athletic
departments. Shaw, who came from
Yale in 2005, was preceded by Robin
Mamlet, who came from Swarthmore
in 2000 — a liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania that had a Division 111
athletic program.
This past year has been one of the
most successful in recent years for the
larger men's sports like football, basket
ball and baseball. One reason is a small
sample size, but coaches and athletes
say the admission office has become
more cooperative since Shaw took over
in 2<X)5.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've
understood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery. "He looks real hard to
find a way to help, as compared to ... "
he said, trailing off.
"It's easy to say no." Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about deal
ing with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit
that he has worked to establish stronger
lines of communication with the athlet
ics department.
"In general, the goal is to have good
relationships with all segments of cam
pus." he said. "1 think we've established
good relations with [Athletic Director]
Bob Bowlsby."
STUDENT LIFE
Univ. sees drop
in alcohol
emergencies
By THEO MILONOPOULOS
DESK EDITOR
Fewer Stanford students are going to the emer
gency room because of alcohol poisoning than in pre
vious years, according to statistics provided by the
Stanford University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) and Vaden Health Center. But many of the
cases reported this year involve not only freshmen but
also upperclassmen and graduate students.
The statistics also indicate that the number of
Stanford students cited by SUDPS for underage drink
ing has increased and that fewer Stanford students are
being cited for driving under the influence on campus.
ALCOHOL POISONING
Thirty-five cases of alcohol poisoning that required
transportation to an emergency room have occurred
on campus this year as of late May, according to Ralph
J. Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse Prevention
Program at Vaden Health Center.
Castro said the number of these alcohol poisoning
incidents has been decreasing dramatically since the
2004-2005 academic year, when 1 l l > cases were report
ed. Ninety-three cases of alcohol poisoning were doc
umented for 2005-2006. and 54 cases were reported for
2006-2007.
"Basically with regard to other schools. Stanford
students tend to be more responsible in regards to the
frequency and quantity of alcohol use across the
