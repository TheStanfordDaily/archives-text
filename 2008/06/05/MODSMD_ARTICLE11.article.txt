Professors, Teaching Assistants and
students all manage busy lives —
negotiating academic duties, familial
responsibilities and extracurricular
activities. It's no wonder that some
people don't get as much rest as they
want.
In his popular winter quarter
class "Sleep and Dreams," Psychia
try Prof. William Dement teaches
that the average amount of sleep re
quired by undergraduates is nine
hours and 15 minutes. But for sen
iors who are just about to graduate,
finishing up their classes, throwing in
extra hours of work and possibly
working on a thesis, getting that
much sleep is likely an unattainable
luxury.
"I slept about five to six hours a
day during the time 1 was working
on my thesis, especially this quarter,
since I was focused on writing it,"
said David Lai 08. "On work days, 1
got up at 10:10 a.m. and then on the
sis days I'd wake up at 12:45 p.m."
Seniors also juggle extracurricu
lar activities that take up their time.
"1 got an average of seven hours
this quarter," said Charlie Wang '08.
"Usually, I choose to either work or
socialize, but most of the time, I slept
late because of lab."
"I went to bed around one and
woke up at seven," added Bryan
Cauley '08. "My hours of sleep a
night range from five to six. My rea-

sons for this are [ Resident Assistant]
RA duties, homework and social
life."
Social activities may be a main
reason why Stanford students
choose to forego sleep.

ing or socializing." said Kimberley
Stewart '10, who said she averages
about four hours of sleep a night.

with friends."
Even freshmen, although just fin
ishing their first year at Stanford, al
ready seem to have similar sleep
schedules, as well as packed agendas
both because of their many commit
ments and their need for relaxation
and recreation.
"My bedtime usually ranges
from 3 to 6 a.m. and I wake up be
tween 8 a.m. and 1 p.m." said David
Schneider '11. "I usually sleep late
because of a combination of work
and play."
Some students, however, take
Dements advice, making an extra
effort to get enough sleep.
"1 like my sleep so 1 get eight
hours of sleep on average," said
Woubzena Jifar '10. "This quarter 1
usually went to bed at midnight. Part
of the reason I stay up until midnight
is because I don't start work until 9
p.m."
Gongmyung Lee '11 has a differ
ent strategy for getting enough
sleep.
" I actually have been getting a lot
of sleep," he said. "My average for
this quarter would be around seven
to eight hours of sleep because I usu
ally sleep through most of my morn
ing classes."
According to Alyssa O'Brien, a
lecturer in the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR), professors are

sympathetic to students' lack of
sleep.
"I empathize," she said. "I know
most people work from 10 p.m.
[through] 5 a.m. It is challenge for
the students to balance the work and
activities they have and the
need to sleep."
However, in her opinion, sleep
ing through class is not the ideal so
lution. )
"1 feel strongly that (students
should] be in class," she said. "It is
very valuable to be in class because
of what you learn, and it's hard to
make up work. Nothing can replace
communal experience in class."
"But before all that, you have to
be awake," she added.
O'Brien proposed a solution of
her own — "teachers need to be
role models and get more sleep," she
said.
Even though not all students lis
ten to his teachings about sleep,
many would point to Dement as
Stanford's role model for sleep, and
his class has had an impact on some
students.
"For the class, we kept a sleep
journal that documents how much
sleep you got for a night and how
you feel throughout the day," Wang
said. "It taught me the strong corre
lation of sleep and how you feel dur
ing the day."
"It's interesting to learn about
how to create a better sleep situation
for yourself," Stewart added. "They
talked a lot about sleep debt, and
how it makes you less aware of
things and other negative effects.
You get extra credit for sleeping in
class, which encourages getting
enough sleep."
