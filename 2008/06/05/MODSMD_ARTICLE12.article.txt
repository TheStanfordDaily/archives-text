# Five days at the poverty line
## 
### AN LE NGUYEN 
"Poverty is more than just a
moral issue. It is a very costly deci
sion for the country as a whole. We
all pay the price, poor and non
poor."
As he says this. Sociology Prof.
David Grusky hands me a gigantic
tome — a 1,082-page whopper —
and tells me to read an article by
Barbara Ehrenreich.
"She's doing exactly what you're
doing," Grusky says. Ehrenreich, a
middle-class journalist, lived in
poverty for a month to test the as
sumption that work could lift poor
women out of their dire straits. But
Ehrenreich's experience greatly
surpasses what 1 hope to accomplish
by living at the poverty line for five
days.
In truth. I feel uncomfortable dis
cussing poverty. 1 do not have the
credibility of a seasoned researcher
to claim expert understanding of
this issue. Nor can I profess to know
what it is like to live at the poverty
line. So I decide to undergo the ex
perience myself — to walk in anoth
er person's shoes and hopefully not
stumble along the way.
Day 1: Getting Started
According to the Department of
Health and Human Services, the
2008 poverty threshold was set at an
annual earning of $10,400, more
than $1,000 short of the quarterly
undergraduate tuition for 2007 -
2008.
The number of Americans living
at or below the poverty line is stag
gering. Grusky, who founded the
Stanford Center on the Study of
Poverty and Inequality, pinpoints
two factors that contribute to the
high incidence of poverty in the
United States: poorly paying jobs
and a market economy with little re
distribution. He also asserts that
poverty engenders social problems
such as alcoholism, drug addiction
and crime. Like global warming, it is
a predicament with expensive
shared costs.
Armed with this information, I
expect the worst. But with classes as
a substitute for minimum-wage
work and Stern Hall as a proxy for
government-subsidized housing,the
situation is not so dismal.
As the Director of Property
Management for the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation (PAHC),
Georgina Mascarenhas is well ac
quainted with the ins and outs of
state-subsidized Section 8 housing.
She informs me that residents are
expected to contribute "30 percent
of their adjusted growth income"
for rent.
This means that $3,120 has al
ready gone down the drain. When I
subtract a liberal $960 for utilities,
$ 1 (K) for my bike and $1,500 for
sundry personal supplies, I am left
with $4,720 for the entire year. I cal
culate an expenditure of approxi
mately $12.93 per day, meaning din
ing hall meals are out of the ques
tion.
I bike to Safeway to stock up on
food provisions. All together, I
spend $14.06 on five days worth of
food. My meals are to consist of cup
of noodles, ham and cheese sand
wiches and apples. Granted, this fru
gal budget enables me to splurge on
an occasional cafe mocha or latte,
but it is mainly in anticipation of
crises. Those living at and under the

poverty threshold can survive on a
day-to-day basis. However, when
emergencies arise — an accident, a
health problem, a natural disaster
— the financial burden comes to the
forefront.
I heat up water in my room and
dig into my cup of noodles.
Day 2: Learning the Hard Way
Gradually, I realize that my ex
periment resembles an unhealthy
diet, rather than an earnest foray
into poverty. I feel like a candidate
for the latest lose-three-pounds-in
one-week ad, as opposed to an
emerging social activist.
I was not born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, but as a Stanford stu
dent. 1 am endowed with certain
privileges that make my assertions
about poverty appear, at best, igno
rant and, at worst, hypocritical. And
in spite of my efforts to approximate
living conditions at the poverty line,
I find myself far removed from the
plight of America s poorest.
My classes, however taxing they
may be, can never replicate the
physical and mental exhaustion that
accompanies low-wage jobs. The
relative safety and luxury of dorm
life does not reflect the dangers and
instabilities of Section 8 housing.
Sure, I can eat $3 worth of food
every day, but what good does this
do for the single-mother who works
two jobs to support her children?
I begin to feel that students, my
self included, may make very little
difference in the fight against pover
ty, and this realization strikes the
very center of my being. With all of
our good intentions, how have we
ameliorated the lives of the poor?
Have our community service ef
forts, poverty awareness programs
and food drives been in vain?
Day 3: A Two-Way Discourse
At the Haas Center, I encounter
Nick Cheng. As the Leadership Pro
gram Assistant, Cheng works close
ly with student leaders to support
the growth of Stanford organiza
tions. He becomes pensive when I
ask if these student groups make a
difference on the lives of their in
tended beneficiaries.
"The impact is at least as strong
on the individual that is going on
these volunteering events," Cheng
says."It is about appreciating the
community for teaching them about
these issues."
So community service is a two
way dialogue, I propose.
"Yeah, it's not just the immediate
impact, as in how much food you
provide for a night," Cheng contin
ues. "It's about the experience on
the students too."
This strikes me as a fresh
thought. In the midst of my sand
wich and noodle consumption, I
have forgotten that students also
benefit from service — that their
exposure to poverty might not pro
duce instantaneous gains, but may
pave the way for future change.
Day 4: Privilege and Responsibility
With the exception of library ac
cess and caffeine intake, I miss very
little from my "normal" life. If any
thing, I am more appreciative of the
simple blessings I possess — a warm
bed, a safe place to stay, meager but
enough food.
On the phone, I converse with
Tommy Tobin '10. Tobin co-directs
the Stanford Projection on Hunger

(SPOON) and.speaking with him, I
get the impression that alleviating
poverty is possible.
"Stanford groups and organiza
tions are doing a hit right now"
Tobin notes. "For example, the
Poverty and Inequality Center is
doing a lot with research ... There
are certain groups going at it from
an awareness realm — that's Stu
dents Taking on Poverty (STOP)."
From an outreach perspective,
SPOON picks up extra food from
student dining halls and the Faculty
Club to deliver to food banks. The
group's objectives are to reduce
food waste and to provide assis
tance to those in need. In light of
SPOON's achievement, it appears
as if students are playing an active
role in addressing the immediate
demands of the poor.
But we could do more,Tobin ar
gues. His goal is to ensure the suc
cess of Summer SPOON because
"there is very little aid going on in
the community over the summer."
Tobin's rationale is straightfor
ward. "It's not like hunger and
homelessness take a break," he
states. "My goal is to save a ton of
food and to have this as a recurring
program, even when 1 might not be
here."
He plans to coordinate with pro
grams that operate over the summer
session — Summer College, Sopho
more College, Upward Bound stu
dents and local high school kids.
Curious to know what motivates
Tobin to pursue these ambitious
goals, I ask him why SPOON and
outreach programs are meaningful
elements in his life.
"In dealing with all kinds of peo
ple," he begins, "you learn about
what you want to do and about
yourself and about the privileges
you have."
Tobin and his peers, I realize, are
simply trying to return the favor —
tenfold.
Day 5: Seeing the Light
On my last day living at the
poverty line. I am both relieved and
saddened. Throughout my experi
ence, I have learned more from the
people with whom I have interacted
than from the actual experiment it
self. My focus has shifted from just
experiencing what it is like to subsist
in poverty to the larger implications
of student actions to remedy the
problem.
Yet, the point does not drive
through until I speak to Alex Martin
'09, co-president of Night Outreach
to the Homeless. Martin leads Fri
day night walks up and down Uni
versity Avenue, and occasionally in
San Francisco's Tenderloin district.
Night Outreach volunteers do more
than bring food and clothing to the
homeless; they also make the effort
to get to know the homeless.
"For me. it's also a breaking
down of those artificial barriers of
who should be my friend, or just
someone I do charity with," Martin
says.
Martin describes her friend Den
nis, who lives on the streets of Palo
Alto. Despite the cold. Dennis tried
to dissuade her from buying him a
pair of gloves and a beanie from
Longs because they were too expen
sive. Martin bought them anyway.
"I would spend $20 in a heartbeat
on a friend back at school for some
thing frivolous, but it's not going to
keep them warm." she reasons.
