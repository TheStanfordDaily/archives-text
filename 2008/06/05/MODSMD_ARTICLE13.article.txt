# Campus ACLU chapter takes action
## 
### ROXNA IRANI STAFF WRITER 
Rights, derechos, droits — a term used in com
mon conversation, demanded liberally when some
one throws a tantrum and very often taken for grant
ed since most college students don't have to fight for
their rights each morning when they wake up. But
history hasn't always been fair. And that's where the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Stanford
Chapter comes in.
In between the many start-ups and the gorgeous
weather, Stanford lacked an organization dedicated
to discussions and awareness of civil liberties. In Jan
uary of this year, Eve Rips 08 realized this deficit
and decided to establish a Stanford Chapter of the
ACLU to help protect and increase civil liberties for
students on campus. With the support from the staff
at the Northern California offices of the ACLU and
interest from students who responded to emails she
diligently sent out. Rips was able to gather good sup
port on campus for the group.
"The ACLU is a national organization aimed at
protecting and increasing civil liberties. It deals with
issues such as First Amendment liberties, equality in
the work place, reproductive rights, gay marriage
and Habeas Corpus rights," Rips said. "The Stanford
chapter aims both at helping the ACLU out with
these projects on a national or state level, and at pro
moting knowledge of. and support for. civil liberties
across campus."

The ACLU was founded in 1920 by Rodger Bald
win, with the initial purpose to protect aliens from
deportation. Gradually, it has evolved into the
largest legal activism organization in the country
with membership around half a million.
The founding team this year included Events Co
ordinator Kacey Wulff '08, Advocacy Coordinator
Salone Kapur '10, who also writes for The Daily,
Fundraising Coordinators Danny Taing'o7 and Con
ner Peretti '09, Financial Manager Robert Steel '08
and Calendar Officer Victoria Lai '11.
Getting the group off its feet was a challenge, but
one for which ACLU members feel all their efforts
undoubtedly paid off.
"I expected this first year to be tough, and in a lot
of ways it has been. Details like getting funding, de
ciding where to meet and figuring out how to struc
ture meetings can be frustratingly complicated."
Rips said. "But I've also been overwhelmed by how
many people have responded to emails with glowing
comments and enthusiasm for starting up a civil lib
erties related group on campus."
Kapur, next year's co-president, is committed to
the cause of the organization and has been encour
aged by the enthusiasm garnered on campus.
"I think that having an ACLU chapter will fill a
very concrete need for an organization to fuel civil
liberties-related discussion and awareness on cam
pus," she said. "The group has provided me with a
much needed forum for the discussion of civil liber
ties issues and related legal constraints and I hope

that next year, we will continue and expand our ef
forts to provide such a forum for the greater Stan
ford community."
ACLU has teamed up with other campus groups
with related interests — such as the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN) and Stanford
Amnesty International — to co-host various events,
featuring renowned speakers on subjects as contro
versial and sensitive as Guantanamo.
"Through the Stanford ACLU chapter, we hope
to promote awareness of issues such as free speech,
racial and ethnic justice, religious freedom, women's
and reproductive rights and equality for underrepre
sented populations," Kapur said. "Throughout the
year, we plan to host speakers and debates on cam
pus, watch ACLU attorneys argue in court and par
ticipate in community events."
Meetings are held bi-monthly on TUesdays at 8
p.m. During each meeting, one officer conducts a ten
minute presentation on civil liberty cases to raise
awareness on campus about current issues.
ACLU has reached out to interested students and
participants both on- and off-campus, working on
projects that range from reproductive rights to crim
inal and racial justice to First Amendment protec
tion.
"We have been running weekly tabling in White
Plaza to raise awareness of various civil liberties is
sues that are particularly important at that time as
well as have done an outreach program with local
high school students intended to teach them about

their rights while at school," Rips said. "We've also
recruited volunteers for ACLU of Northern Califor
nia events, such as helping to provide legal observers
during the Olympic Torch rally in _

San Francisco."

racial and ethnic justice, religious freedom, women's
and reproductive rights and equality for underrepre
sented populations," Kapur said. "Throughout the
year, we plan to host speakers and debates on cam
pus, watch ACLU attorneys argue in court and par
ticipate in community events."
Meetings are held bi-monthly on TUesdays at 8
p.m. During each meeting, one officer conducts a ten
minute presentation on civil liberty cases to raise
awareness on campus about current issues.
ACLU has reached out to interested students and
participants both on- and off-campus, working on
projects that range from reproductive rights to crim
inal and racial justice to First Amendment protec
tion.
"We have been running weekly tabling in White
Plaza to raise awareness of various civil liberties is
sues that are particularly important at that time as
well as have done an outreach program with local
high school students intended to teach them about

their rights while at school," Rips said. "We've also
recruited volunteers for ACLU of Northern Califor
nia events, such as helping to provide legal observers
during the Olympic Torch rally in _

San Francisco."

"ACLU is focused on working
more extensively with civil liberties at

Stanford — events that deal with campus
hiring practices or the fact that White Plaza
is currently the only free speech zone on
campus issues — that students will directly
relate to," Rips said. "Hopefully next yeai

both the group itself and its effect
across campus will be bigger and
better, with more lectures from fac
ulty members and lawyers that stu
dents can attend."
Rips feels that ACLU abounds
in promise,especially with regard to
promoting understanding of the
true value of rights and liberties to
students across campus. As she puts
it, the mission of the Stanford
Chapter is to "protect and expand
students' fundamental freedoms
and civil liberties." 1 ler belief is that
this starts one step at a time — with
a trip to ACLAJ meetings at 8 p.m.
