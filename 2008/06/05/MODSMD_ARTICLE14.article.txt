# HARDCORE SENIORS
## 
### PAM SUD STAFF WRITER 
For many graduating seniors,
spring quarter senior year is defined
by a mixture of excitement, fear and
nostalgia. In the future, seniors may
remember fondly their final quarter
spent with drawmates, old friends and
senior class events. But how do aca
demics fit into all of this? How is the
graduating class of 2(X)K spending its

final quarter academically on the
Farm?
We all know that Resident Assis
tant (RA) down the hall cramming to
finish an honors thesis, or that senior
friend frequently spotted atop an
inner tube in the Claw. What is going
on? Is the spring of senior year taken
seriously anymore? Or. on the other
end of the spectrum, are Stanford sen
iors taking spring quarter too serious
ly?

"l chose classes based on interest
only," remarked Alex Bandza 08, a
graduating senior who is taking 20
units in addition to writing an honors
thesis. Bandza admits he is taking on a
lot, but has no regrets.
According to Paddy McGowan, di
rector of institutional research at the
Office of the Registrar, that puts
Bandza amongst the 277 graduating
students who are currently enrolled in
18 units or more.'lhat means nearly 1

in 5 seniors and co-terms graduating
this spring have chosen to spend their
final quarter with an 18+ unit quarter.
"These last two weeks will definite
ly be crunch time," Bandza admitted.
But even with such academic rigor,
Bandza says he still finds time to go
out approximately once a month.
This phenomenon is more rampant
than ever. The registrar reported that
42 students have chosen to enroll in
more than 20 units, exceeding the 20-
unit limit by submitting a petition or
by enrolling in both undergraduate
and graduate units. Is taking such a
large course load at the end of senior
year the latest Stanford trend?
Recent graduate Jon Chang '07
weighed in with a word of caution for
any juniors planning to go down this
path.
"When you leave college, you leave
college," he said, 'it's not the same
anymore." Chang thinks fondly upon
memories from his final quarter at
Stanford. "Spend your time at Stan
ford with friends, and enjoy the mo
ment."
Although Chang's wisdom may be
wise, it may not always be an option.
Senior Sheppard Peng '08 is spending
this quarter enrolled in 18 units to ful
fill his language requirement, an
entry-level class for his biology major
and a General Education Require
ment in ethics.
"1 was so focused on my major that
now I have to fit these requirements in
at the end," Peng commented.
There does exist a cohort of seniors
like Peng on campus, but overall, sta-

tistics reveal that the class of 2(X)8
also has a substantial number of
seniors taking it easy, or, in

some cases, taking no class
es at all. The regis
trar reported that

the average grad
uating, currently
enrolled senior
is taking 13.15 {
unitsâ€”l 2.77

is the aver
age without
co-terms.
In addi-

tion. 148 stu
dents are not

enrolled in classes at all. In other
words, nearly 10 percent of the gradu
ating class has opted to take a gradua
tion quarter, apply for a permit to at
tend or apply for a permit for services
only. These three statuses all have
slightly different implications, but all
involve no units while remaining on
campus. This situation, which some
dub "Camp Stanford," has become in
creasingly popular among seniors.
"It's given me the opportunity to
travel a bit, and relax before law
school starts," remarked Sean San
doloski '08, who is thoroughly enjoy
ing his time at Camp Stanford before
beginning Yale Law School in the fall.
"I work at undergraduate admission,
and I joined Netflix," explained San
doloski in response to how he fills his
time. "And those two aren't always
mutually exclusive."
Academic Advisor Sally Mentzer
of Undergraduate Advisinc and Re-

search (UAR) offered a perspective
on why Stanford seniors vary so much
in their academic load.
"Each senior is so different," she
said."Some will graduate fairly sure ol
what they want to do, while others are
still weighing their options."
Mentzer advises students of all
class years, some of whom she advises
throughout their entire four years at
Stanford.
"The hardest senior to advise is one
who has chosen something, but it is not
in line with their true interests." she
added. Perhaps the dichotomy of
some seniors knowing their career
path while others still figure it out cre
ates the dichotomous senior year
spring quarter.
