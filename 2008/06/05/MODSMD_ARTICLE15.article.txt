## Editor's Farewell 
### 
There is no manual explaining how to
run The Daily. Seventy issues ago,
when I began my tenure as editor-in
chief. I wanted such a handbook to guide
me through my new position. Sure, 1 had
worked at The Daily for two and a half
years at this point, but my past experiences
had in no way prepared me for all that 1
would soon encounter.
That first week, as I worked until 4 a.m.
for too many nights in a row, I continuously
reminded myself about the learning curve
of which my former editors spoke. The job
will get easier soon, they promised, the
paper will go to press earlier. But as the
weeks progressed, and the unreasonable
bedtimes continued, I found it difficult to
believe that 1 would ever completely figure
out this job. My predecessors had made it
look so effortless, editing articles while si
multaneously coordinating layout, answer
ing endless phone calls and ordering Tree
house for dinner to keep staff morale high.
When spring quarter began, things final
ly started to change. As the learning curve
kicked in. though. I came to understand
that the drama and stress would never fully
subside. In reality, the job would never be as
smooth as past editors had made it seem to
me. The paper did go to press earlier, and 1
did become more confident in my ability to
handle the phone calls and conflicts, but the
stressful situations themselves continued to
the end of the volume.
As Volume 233 comes to a close, 1 now
know that it would be impossible to actual
ly write a manual explaining how to run this
newspaper. Each situation that arises is too
distinct. Despite my desires, there is no sin
gle formula that holds all the answers. Only
1 can decide when to hold an article, when
to pursue an anonymous tip that sounds too
good to be true, and when to admit that, yes,
we made a mistake. Repetition alone has
given me the confidence in making these
decisions night after night.
Four months ago, I could never have
predicted the way this job would affect me.
Of course 1 have gained experience in jour
nalism — that was expected. But beyond
that, 1 have gained the ability to make

choices quickly, to think on my feet and to
stand behind my actions, even when doing
so upsets my coworkers or community
members. I have learned that an editor can
not please everyone, and 1 must trust my
own instincts to do what I think is right.
As I pass the reins to my successor.
Christian Torres, I now understand that 1
cannot hand him a Daily manual, nor can I
tell him exactly what it takes to successful
ly complete the job. All 1 can give him is the
same positive reassurance that past editors
gave me: it will get easier soon, I promise. 1
am certain that Christian will learn quickly
and take this paper in new directions, all the
while making it look effortless to those
below him.
All that I have learned, about journalism
and especially about myself, would not have
been possible without the help of my co
workers in the newsroom. Together, as the
volume progressed, we learned to work as a
team — and we had fun while doing it. 1
thank everyone in the office for patiently
working through the long nights to put out a
quality product, and I thank my past edi
tors-in-chief for answering the late-night
phone calls during the stickiest of dilemmas.
Tonight, as I send the paper to print yet
again, 1 cannot believe that my time as edi
tor passed so quickly. The nights may have
been long, but the high 1 got each night
from sending the paper to press existed to
this very day. 1 will miss the countless hours
spent in this office, but I look forward to
reading a new volume, edited by our new
editor in The Daily's brand new building.
Sincerely,
Julie Klein '09

Editor-in-Chief, Volume 233
