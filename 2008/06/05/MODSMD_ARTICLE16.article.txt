# Little Ms. Modern
## Little Ms. Postmodern? 
### 
During the past year of writing about
the ups and downs of modern life,
I've received quite a few comments
from my more fastidious readers that we are
actually living in the postmodern era. 1 con
fess that, after three academic quarters of
drowning in exclusively technical problem
sets, I am more unqualified than ever to ad
dress postmodernity in a scholarly way. Still.
1 hope you will pardon my amateurism be
cause this is my farewell column,and I'd like
to set the above-mentioned fastidious read
ers straight.
Colloquially,"postmodern" is used to de
scribe the cynical, absurd response to
today's media-saturated culture, in which
objective reality is arguably a fantasy, and
meaning and truth are purportedly the aspi
rations of the laughably naive. Think "Vote
for Pedro" t-shirts (or better yet, the whole
of "Napoleon Dynamite"). Wes Anderson's
more whimsical films, the ironic hipster
dress code and the many unlikely or bizarre
situations that make people chortle,"That's
sooo random!" (Randomness is built into
the universe at a subatomic level, you mo
rons— it's all random.) Architecture's
postmodern contributions include the
Frank Gehry building in Venice, California,
that is literally a pair of gigantic binoculars.
The postmodern movement is a direct
criticism of modernity and modernism,
which postmodernists see as characterized
by false hopes and unhealthy optimism. In
deed. a great deal of modernist work, while
acknowledging and bemoaning the difficul
ties of the modern world, expresses belief in
an eventual, often Utopian solution. Post
modernists have perceptively noticed that
modernism has thus far failed to solve the
problems of modernity — we are as alienat
ed, conflicted and emotionally bankrupt as
ever — and they have concluded that there
simply is no Utopia. It's kind of like in "The
Matrix Reloaded," when Neo meets with
The Architect and learns that the whole
Prophecy thing is hogwash, or, as I am told
by my boyfriend, like the wall scribbles in
the video game "Portal," which sadly reveal
that the cake is a lie.
Indeed, as I mentioned in my very first
column, modern architecture is intensely
disliked.or at least vastly misunderstood, by
many people. One shouldn't need several
college-level classes to know how to inter
pret the buildings in which one lives — that
undermines the entire goal of creating
spaces that address the modern problems of
the masses. Instead of honest, didactic and
ideologically rigorous, many modern works,
architectural and otherwise, come off as
anti-social party guests: callous, conde
scending and boring.
And as more and more of these boorish
acquaintances have worn out their wel
come. they've been replaced by their much
sillier, more easy-going postmodern
cousins, who are charmingly aloof and at
tractively disheveled enough to inspire
more than a few delirious crushes. See, the

postmodern building is cool. He doesn't
sweat the small stuff. In fact, he doesn't
sweat any stuff, because, like, what's the eff
ing point, dude?
Well, what is the point? Mine is that wal
lowing in the pointlessness of it all is inex
cusably selfish, superficial, and ignorant.
The postmodern party guest is distractingly
entertaining but ultimately useless and
quite insidious. By ridiculing our sense of
meaning and dismissing our sense of hope,
he scrapes out the meager emotional con
tent remaining inside us after modernity
tore through. And, frankly, all this self-in
dulgent cynicism is unnecessary. While
modernism may have failed in its trial ef
forts, its characterization of the modern
condition has been confirmed as highly ac
curate — the metaphorical rupture of the
pre-modern bubble has indeed been ex
tremely painful, as well as liberating, and
the problems resulting from this contradic
tion are indeed very difficult to solve.
Still, difficulties and failures do not re
quire that we throw up our hands in help
lessness and shift our focus to wearing
snarky t-shirts and designing buildings that
look like arbitrary household objects. Logic,
reason and science are friends who have
served us handily over the past century, and,
despite the well-documented current trends
of anti- and pseudo-intellectualism, it's in
our interest to keep these friendships intact.
A quick glance at the state of affairs a hun
dred years ago verifies that modern
progress is real, and while the originally en
visioned Utopia might have been overly sim
plistic, there's no doubt that our societal
condition can continue to improve.
So in this final paragraph of my final col
umn, let me unequivocally reassert my con
viction that, as citizens of a modern world
characterized by freedom, anguish and con
tradiction, we can only overcome our prob
lems by thoroughly acknowledging and di
rectly addressing them. Just as nostalgic at
tempts to deny the modern condition
through a sugary wistfulness for the old
fashioned lead us astray into self-deception,
postmodern attempts to dismiss it through
irony and superficiality are a wasteful, lazy
distraction. If, instead, we are earnest and
authentic, both in emotion and analysis, 1
suspect we'll find that the cake is not a lie
after all.
