# You're Not Special
## The 						shining city grows dark 
### 
I don't like rapid change. The world that we
live in has been good to me. I am happy and
prosperous. I know and understand this
world. Some other world, one in which we are
not rapidly stripping our planet of its natural re
sources and causing a rapid increase in the price
of oil, food and metal, might be less beneficial to
me.
In my column, 1 have decried radicalism of
all sorts. When a nation changes rapidly, the so
cial order is easily upset. Those who were once
on top often find themselves against a wall.
1 have no wish to wake up and find that the
world as I've known it has been turned on its
side, even if that change is for the better.
Many of my friends are more adventure
some than me. They dream of a better world.
They dream of a world without war, famine or
pestilence. They dream of a world where every
human being may reach his or her full potential.
They are idiots. And they will never achieve
that dream.
There will always be class disparities. As long

as people arrange themselves into different
groups — whether those groups be divided
along lines of sex, race or nationid citizenship —
those people will always hate each other.
Human beings are ornery, greedy bastards. And
when the government tries to corral our selfish
behaviors, we fall prey to the selfishness of the
people who run the government. We are
trapped by our human nature, and we will never
be able to move beyond it. I don't even bother
to try.
But still, there is a sort of beauty in the fool
ish idealism of these people. I have met men and
women who are as cynical as I am. I tend to dis

like them. I much prefer the company of dream
ers. They look at this world and. while acknowl
edging its shortcomings, never lose sight of what
a magnificent place it could be. 1 would rather
see that shining city reflected in their eyes,
knowing it can never exist, than have to live with
dismal reality.
If our world changes at all, it will not be be
cause of pragmatists like me. It will be because
of hopeless dreamers like you. Of course, our
world is not going to change. It cannot change.
And you will dash your dreams on the rocks of
that reality. But I applaud you for trying.
This will be my last column. And I want to
use it to thank the many people who have
shaped my worldview. So many of you are far
better people than me. And more importantly,
so many of you have been a far better friend to
me than I could have wished for. I will miss you.
