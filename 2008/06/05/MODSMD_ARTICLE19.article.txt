# Positive Sustainability
## A 						carafe of hope 
### 
It's a classic conundrum: is the glass half
empty, or half full? The pessimist, it is said,
believes half empty, the optimist half full.
The engineer believes the glass is twice the
necessary size.
1 believe that, regardless of its state, the
glass is waiting to be filled, and that beside
every glass sits a full carafe waiting to fill it. if
we would only pick it up and pour.
Although 1 am clearly hopeful about our
prospects for the future, I am also realistic
about the problems of the present. If the state
of the environment were represented in such
a metaphorical glass, we could reasonably ex
pect it to be significantly less than half full,
and draining fast. Fortunately, for the past
few decades, a dedicated community has
been gathered around this glass, examining
its diverse leaks while attempting to develop
solutions to patch them.Today, we profile the
various types of people who encounter this
glass.
The first type is the citizen who sees the
crowd, but turns a blind eye and continues
walking. Understandably overwhelmed by
the many problems we all face today, environ
mental and otherwise, she falls prey to the
false dichotomy of ignorant bliss versus en
lightened depression and eagerly chooses the

former.
The second person to encounter the glass
instead stops to understand the situation.
However, due to the overwhelming nature of
the problem and the tendency of those al
ready working on the leaks to sensationalize,
she soon comes to understand the crisis, but
has no sense of its solvability. Her knowledge
may haunt her each time she knowingly con
tributes to the problem, but she continues to
live in a state of morose inaction.
A third reacts more violently when he
comes across the glass and learns of the prob
lem. Not wanting to accept that he has the abil
ity to cause such a catastrophe, or the respon
sibility to stop it, he begins to deny that the
problem exists, convincing himself and any
one who will listen that they could not cause
such a problem, or that these leaks may some
how actually be beneficial.
The fourth type of person actually decides
to do something productive, jumping on the
bandwagon to help. She joins the crowd of
problem-solvers and lends a hand where she
can, learning the old-timers' techniques for
patching the holes in the glass. While she in
deed provides a helping hand, she succeeds
only at continuing what has been started, fail
ing to create anything new.

A fifth passerby also joins, but quickly real
izes that the current efforts are not nearly
enough. Despite continued efforts, the water
level in the glass is falling daily, as new, bigger
leaks keep springing open. In some cases, he
notices, the patching efforts are even con
tributing to the new leaks opening up. Hoping
he can change the problem solvers' old and
tired ways, this pessimist criticizes their meth
ods, publicly condemning their failures. When
his critical lectures do nothing to change their
ways, he retreats from the crowd, disillusioned
by the public process. He wanders off, search
ing for smaller glasses to fill.
Having seen the crowds failure in provid
ing meaningful change, and the critic's failure
in changing the way of the crowd, a sixth
passerby has what she hopes will be a revolu
tionary idea. Instead of focusing on the prob
lem or on the failed solutions, she focuses on
the positive, on demonstrating a better way
forward. She shows the crowd how they can
patch the holes so that they stay patched with
out opening new ones, and reveals to them


Nick
Enge
more positive ways of getting the at
tention of new passersby.
Finally, she inspires them with a
new goal: not only to sustain the
world, but to heal it as well — not
only to patch the holes and maintain
the water level indefinitely, but final
ly to reach for that full carafe, and fill
the glass right up to the brim. In this
column. I have aimed to be this sixth
type of citizen, and inspire this
change. As more people come to sup
port this mentality. I have ever)' hope
that we will indeed be able to solve
every problem we face today; to cre

ate a world that, for once, is ethically,
environmentally and economically
elegant.
Positive Sustainability will continue
to promote this forward-looking view
point as the ideas presented over the
past eight weeks are honed and ex
panded upon in a new book — "Posi
tive Sustainability: Sustaining and
Healing the Earth and World." But, as
the sixth passerby realizes, talk is cheap,
so my life will be dedicated to discover
ing and implementing the very best so
lutions in the real world. 1 hope you will
join me in my positive quest.

ability at nickenge@stanford.cdu.
