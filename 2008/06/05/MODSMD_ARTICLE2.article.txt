## Law school drops letter grade system Farm joins Yale, Berkeley in adopting pass/fail-like evaluations 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law School faculty voted last week to
drop the school's letter grade system in favor of
an honors, pass, restricted credit or no credit sys
tem. Stanford will join Yale and Berkeley, among
other law schools, in eschewing traditional letter
grades.
The move was made to decrease excessive
competition among law students, a source of sig
nificant stress.
"One of the things we are trying to encourage
is [that] students shouldn't try to distinguish
themselves for no good reason at all," Dean Larry
Kramer told The Daily. "There's incredible
demand for law students in the job market."
"The reform will have significant pedagogical
benefits, including that it encourages greater flex
ibility and innovation in the classroom and in
designing metrics for evaluating student work,"
Kramer wrote in an email to law students.
Eliminating letter grades may also stop law stu
dents from structuring their course schedules to
boost GPAs.
In the letter grade system, core doctrinal cours
es are usually taught "on-mean" and curved based
on a mean score, while most seminars are taught
"off-mean." Students seeking summer associate
positions could artificially boost their GPAs by
putting off the doctrinal classes until the third year
and taking more "off-mean" courses earlier on.
"1 am glad that the new grading system will
eliminate this 'on-mean' and 'off-mean' system so
that students can feel free to take whatever class
es they are interested in," said Amanda Bonn J.D.
'09.
The jury is still out on whether or not the new
grading system will help or hinder law students in
their search for clerkships and jobs.
