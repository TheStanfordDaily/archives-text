## Law school drops letter grade system Farm joins Yale, Berkeley in adopting pass/fail-like evaluations 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law School faculty voted last week to
drop the school's letter grade system in favor of
an honors, pass, restricted credit or no credit sys
tem. Stanford will join Yale and Berkeley, among
other law schools, in eschewing traditional letter
grades.
The move was made to decrease excessive
competition among law students, a source of sig
nificant stress.
"One of the things we are trying to encourage
is [that] students shouldn't try to distinguish
themselves for no good reason at all," Dean Larry
Kramer told The Daily. "There's incredible
demand for law students in the job market."
"The reform will have significant pedagogical
benefits, including that it encourages greater flex
ibility and innovation in the classroom and in
designing metrics for evaluating student work,"
Kramer wrote in an email to law students.
Eliminating letter grades may also stop law stu
dents from structuring their course schedules to
boost GPAs.
In the letter grade system, core doctrinal cours
es are usually taught "on-mean" and curved based
on a mean score, while most seminars are taught
"off-mean." Students seeking summer associate
positions could artificially boost their GPAs by
putting off the doctrinal classes until the third year
and taking more "off-mean" courses earlier on.
"1 am glad that the new grading system will
eliminate this 'on-mean' and 'off-mean' system so
that students can feel free to take whatever class
es they are interested in," said Amanda Bonn J.D.
'09.
The jury is still out on whether or not the new
grading system will help or hinder law students in
their search for clerkships and jobs.
Without letter grades, law stu
dents won't be able to cite their
CiPAs to distinguish themselves
from other applicants. To that end,
the law school will offer other ways
to showcase high achievement.
"We will probably increase the
number of prizes and awards that
are available," Kramer said.
"We've taken away competing for
grades just to separate yourself
from other students for no good
reasons, but we still will give stu
dents who care about certain
things opportunities."
High demand for law school
graduates in the job market may
ensure that the new grading sys
tem won't have a negative effect
on Stanford law students.
"The students competing for the
most competitive clerkships will
likely have to distinguish them
selves in other ways, e.g., positions
on law review, but they tend to do
so anyway," Bonn said. "For every
one else, the new grading system
will probably enable more students
to be competitive in the clerkship
process as, once again, grades won't
distinguish so minutely between
the bulk of the class."
Kramer was ultimately satis
fied with his conclusion that letter
grades no longer provided bene
fits to the law school and that the
time was right to move on.
"This really was about recog
nizing that we could improve the
internal culture and that it was ok
to make the move," he said.
