## The 						moralizing of career choice 
### 
For my valedictory end-of-the-year col
umn, 1 originally planned to write that 1
myself was insane. But a far more inter
esting and far less self-indulgent topic
emerged. There's been considerable talk in
the pages of The Daily over the past week
about Stanford's supposedly "pre-profession
al" character, which is portrayed in a negative
light. I'm not convinced that Stanford is near
ly as pre-professional as some other writers
make it out to be. and I'm even less convinced
that it's a bad thing.
Apparently those going off to jobs in con
sulting or investment banking next year
should feel bad because they don't contribute
as much to society as someone teaching in an
inner city or working at a clinic in India.
Never mind that the civic culture of all major
cities — museums, opera houses, universities
and symphonies depend on the largesse of the
wealthy. Never mind that a lot of the wealth of
the rich gets redistributed downward. And
never mind that many people who work in
high-income fields are happy, and that many
people who work in low-income public serv
ice fields are unhappy, frustrated with the
smallness of their apartment and the dingi
ness of their car — if they even have one.
Money, lifestyle and income do matter to
a lot of people. Some may have a desire to
have a certain lifestyle after college that can

only be maintained by high-income employ
ment. A job isn't everything, and it shouldn't
define who people are. Many people care far
more about what they do outside of the job
— if one has a passion for flyfishing, for ex
ample, or painting, it's much easier to fund
those activities when one has a lot of extra
cash. Many students have debts after college
or graduate school; those need to be paid off
before these students can even think about
doing something with a $30,000 annual
salary. A lot of things in life have a price tag
attached.
Public service is indeed an admirable ca
reer choice after college. But the moral supe
riority attached to public service professions
doesn't give the field a good name. The most
compelling charge leveled at high-income
jobs is the intellectual one — that brilliant
Stanford students give up academics to be
come corporate lackeys. I'm not convinced by
that either — for many people, hedge funds
or corporate law is truly a challenging, com
petitive and stimulating field. And it's unclear
whether being a low-level assistant at an
NGO is necessarily more stimulating than
being a consultant.
The most stimulating intellectual field, ac
adcmia, also seems to be something that is
looked down upon. Because academics aren't
directly helping people in the real world, they

should feel guilty. Academia, however, has an
important role to play in the intellectual char
acter of society. Here again, some people
merely make the decision to pursue what they
want to do after college. Even if academia
doesn't make a tangible contribution to the
material well-being of people, graduates who
choose to pursue this career path should not
be condemned for their choice.
Hie job market has a remarkable way of
sorting people efficiently. Those that want to
teach children in Africa certainly can, but
they have to make sacrifices to do so. And
those that want to have a certain lifestyle can
do that on Wall Street and elsewhere, and
they, in the end, are the ones who likely fund
the NGOs that put teachers in Africa.
rhe process of choosing a career after
school should be free of moralizing. Certain
ly, if one signs up to be a loanshark or merce
nary, his moral standing is dubious. But for the
vast majority of professions, it's simply a mat
ter of personal preference. No one (or at least,
very few people) chooses to enter the corpo-


Stuart Baimel
rate world purely out of passion for
spreadsheets and conference calls.
Instead, many simply have a differ
ent set of priorities than those enter
ing the public service, and they
shouldn't be judged negatively for
that.
So that is my message to the sen
iors, and to everyone: don't feel
guilty. Do what you want. Don't look
back.
