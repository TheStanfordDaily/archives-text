## Trivializing Tibet: China's rhetoric of non-action 
### 
Millions of people around the world are demon
strating for the Tibetan cause, while millions of
others have hit the streets to champion China
and the Olympic Games. While on tour, the Olympic
Torch has faced protesters, been escorted by police pha
lanxes, been extinguished five times while in Paris and in
spired the international tours of alternate torches (i.e. the
Human Rights Torch Relay and the Tibetan Freedom
Torch Relay). The Tibet-China issue has been thrust to
the forefront of contemporary politics.
The main conflict zone between the Tibetans and the
Chinese Government lies in public opinion. Official
sources from Beijing will tell you that Tibet's Exile Gov
ernment is telling lies in an effort to rally Western sup
port, win independence for Tibet and reinstate a system
of feudalism. However, official sources from Dharamsala
deny these claims and state that Beijing is responsible for
the information war, the Dalai Lama is asking for noth
ing more than meaningful autonomy and there is no de
sire to reinstate feudalism. Whom should you trust?
Recently, The Daily published an op-ed ["The truth
about Tibet," May 30] that gives a short acknowledgment
to "China's track record on human rights" and seems,
overall, to be very well-intentioned.
The article contains three statements that 1 adamant
ly support. I agree that Westerners, for a variety of rea
sons, tend to romanticize the Tibetan people and their
struggle. I agree that "with the appropriate reforms, there
is no reason that Chinese and Tibetans cannot coexist
peacefully in a unified China." And, 1 agree that the Chi
nese people deserve the opportunity to celebrate the pos
itive aspects of their nation's progress as it hosts the
Olympic Games this August.
In addition to these three reasonable and agreeable
statements, the op-ed presents several "larger truths,"
which I have condensed into the following six points. My
responses follow In parentheses.
(1) Tibet has been a part of China since the thirteenth
century (for a concise, comprehensive description of
Tibet's historical status see Eliot Sperling's "Don't know
Much About Tibetan History" at nytimes.com).
(2) The institution of the Dalai Lama as Tibet's politi
cal and spiritual leader was not legitimized until the Chi
nese emperor of 1751 made it so (in the 1640'5, with the
help of the Mongol prince, Gushi Khan, the sth Dalai
Lama united the eastern and western provinces of Tibet
and spiritually unified it under the Gelug school of Ti
betan Buddhism).
(3) The Tibetan language is the closest relative to the

Chinese language from the Sino-Tibetan language fami
ly (classical Tibetan is classified under the Tibeto-Bur
man family; derived from Sanskrit; it is not tonal, though
there are tonal dialects).
(4) China abolished Tibet's oppressive socio-political
system of feudalism and slavery and has brought wide
spread "economic prosperity and social welfare" (the
positives and negatives of both systems need to be con
sidered and weighed; Tibet would have modernized on its
own due to globalization).
(5) Tibetans actually have it better than Han Chinese,
because the Communist system offers them economic
and social favoring (are the costs of China's rule worth
these benefits'?).
(6) And, last but not least, Tibetan Buddhism has been
widely practiced and tolerated. (Practiced? Not as freely
as it could be.Tolerated? Increasingly so, but still insuffi
ciently: Tibetans cannot openly revere the Dalai Lama,
most active monasteries have a Chinese police station,
monastery populations are restricted, monks and nuns
have been imprisoned and tortured for being outspoken
and the Dalai Lama's choice for Panchen Lama is 19
years old and has been in Chinese custody for 13 years).
If these six points are blended together, they become
quite suggestive. Without any intellectual discourse, the
"truths" of this op-ed help to construct an image of ac
ceptability that invests too much faith in the official Chi
nese side. An image that says,"Tibetans have it good and
are free enough, so why is everyone making such a fuss?
Yes, there are some human rights abuses, but Tibet is a
part of China and China will solve its own problems.
Heck! Tibetan and Chinese are so linguistically similar.so
what's this nonsense about cultural genocide?"
Why is this image a problem? It is a problem because
it works. It serves a purpose. From this perspective, it
seems illogical to support the Tibetan cause. However,
real truths do not act as functioning agents. Real truths
tend to make decisions difficult, not easier.
While the West may be guilty of romantic exaggera
tion. pro-China sources are guilty of downplaying the im
portance of the Tibet issue. In a world where non-action
is the default, Beijing holds the upper hand if the inform
ative, bite-sized "truths" it propagates can convince a sig
nificant number of people that the Tibetan cause is not a
worthy one.
