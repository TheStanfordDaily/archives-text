As thi academic year draws to a
close and many of you ap
proach graduation, you may
find yourself in the midst of trying to fig
ure out who you are, what makes you
tick and where you want to be in 10
years. Moreover,you may be wondering
why you answer these sorts of questions
so differently each time you ask them.
Though I'm probably the last per
son you want advice from, I've learned
a thing or two as an undergrad (which,
in turn, has informed my existential
angst), and, in my last column of the
year. I'd like to share some of my wis
dom with you.
Let's start with the facts.
In 1%8, then-Stanford Professor
Walter Mischel published his ground
breaking work, "Personality and As
sessment," in which he cast doubt upon
the most fundamental tenet of prior
personality theories and our folk psy
chology. Instead of finding that indi
vidual behavior was the result of in
trinsic personality traits, Mischel's re
search demonstrated that extrinsic sit
uational cues were by far the most
powerful determinates of action. In
other words, how a person behaves in a
given context has much more to do
with that particular context than with
her inner "self."
To be fair, Mischel did find that in
dividuals exhibited unique and pre
dictable patterns of variability across
situations. Even though his subjects
didn't prove to be consistently "consci
entious" or "curmudgeonly," they

would act similarly in similar settings.
For instance. Mischel administered
tests to his subjects in a variety of con
texts, and. in each one, he gave them
the chance to cheat. When the subjects
took the same form of the test in the
same environment, their behavior was
extremely consistent. When they were
placed in diverse settings with dissimi
lar tests, however, the correlation of
their scores dropped significantly.
Thus, whether or not someone broke
the rules to further her own self inter
ests was less a function of her essential
"honesty" and more of a function of
the situational dynamics.
Why does this matter? Well, on a
personal level. 1 think that the non-ex
istence of stable personality traits is
both encouraging and humbling. It is a
cause for hope because we can try to
mitigate our worst habits simply by
modifying our environment. For in
stance. as was demonstrated by a re
cent study by researchers at UC-San
Diego and I larvard Medical School,
whether or not someone successfully
quits smoking has as much to do with
the behavior of those around her as
her own personal gumption: smokers
in the study who surrounded them
selves with non-smokers, or with

friends who had also quit, had a signif
icantly easier time giving it up them
selves.
At the same time, we must ac
knowledge that the better parts of our
selves are also heavily dependent on
external conditions. For example, in
their classic 1973 study "Situational
and Dispositional Variables in Helping
People," J. Darley and C. Batson found
that students at a Seminary, a place
where one would hope to find moral
exemplars, exhibited drastically differ
ent attitudes toward an injured man
they encountered, depending on
whether they were in a hurry or not.
Most alarmingly, when they were in a
hurry, the Seminarians ignored the
stranger even when they were on their
way to deliver a sermon on the virtues
of being a good Samaritan.
If we take seriously the contextual
character of our behavior, we emerge
with a certain tluid notion of human
nature that can fruitfully inform our
life decisions. Maybe when we consid
er what career we want, where we want
it and with whom, we can give utmost
priority to who we are in those con
texts and how that compares to the
person we'd most like to be. Although
there's no essential "you" that persists
forever, when it comes to your person
ality, your whole is no greater than the
sum of your parts.
