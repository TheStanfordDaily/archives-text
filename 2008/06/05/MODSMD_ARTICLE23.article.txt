# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## New J-Ro RFs to bring diversity 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Incoming Junipero Resident
Fellow (RF) Tania Mitchell's par
ents just have one quibble about her
partner of eight years.
"They don't talk about our rela
tionship being interracial, they don't
talk about Aaron being trans, but
they do talk about Aaron's septum
piercing," Mitchell said. "They say,
'Have you talked to him about that?
Is he taking it out yet?"
Mitchell and T. Aaron Hans will
be the new RFs in Junipero next fall.
Mitchell has worked as the Service
Learning Director for Stanford's
Center for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) for
the past academic year.
Hans, Mitchell's partner, works
as the Advocacy Program Manager
at the Gay-Straight Alliance
Network in San Francisco and will
be Stanford's first openly transgen
der Resident Fellow.
"It's just easier," Hans said,
explaining why he's chosen to be
upfront about his identity. "I don't
have to think about changing pro
nouns when I talk about playing
lacrosse in college."
"If you get to know me more
than 'How's the weather?' you usu
ally get told," he said. "If you
Google search me, you're going to
figure it out."

Hans cited the increasing num
bers of openly LGBT students on
college campuses as another moti
vation for his openness.
"1 believe that it is my responsi
bility to be out in a positive way for
young people," he said. "(As a col
lege student,] it was important for
me to see others who looked like
me, who struggled with similar iden
tity struggles and who allowed me to
see that I could grow up and be a
productive member of society."
"[Being out] is also about honor
ing and acknowledging who I am as
a whole person," Hans continued. "1
identify as transgender or gen
derqueer, but 1 don't necessarily
identify as a man. just like I didn't
necessarily identify as a woman."
Hans said he came out to
Junipero's Resident Assistant (RA)
applicants during the dorm's sec
ond-round interviews.
"There wasn't a whole lot of
reaction, which was refreshing,"
Hans said.
Mitchell explained that she and
Hans asked RA applicants to bring
in a few objects that said something
about their personal identity. Hans
and Mitchell talked about their
matching wristwatches, a symbol of
their commitment to each other.
"We're not married," Mitchell
said. "When people hear that, they
wonder why, and that's a good segue
into Aaron's identity."
Mitchell said she and Hans could
either accept the assumption that
they are a heterosexual couple or
repetitively inform people about
Hans' gender identity.
"You either never come out, or
you come out all the time," she said.
Being in a relationship with I lans
has redefined Mitchell's own identi
ty.
"Our relationship is queer, but I
was straight before I met Aaron,"

she said. "People ask 'How do you
identify now?' and 1 say 'I don't'...
It's not simple for either of us. We've
both learned a lot."
Hans says Californians in general
have been nonchalant about his
gender identity.
"Most people just go 'Oh, okay,'"
he said. Before coming to Stanford,
Hans taught freshman seminar
classes for six years at California
State University-Monterey Bay.
"1 expected my students to be
freaked out and to run away from
my courses," he said. "I told them on
the second day of class. Ibey had
five days to change their schedule,
but there was no mass exodus."
"I always say, if you have ques
tions, talk to me ... If people have

"We hope students will judge us based
on the work that we do and how
we engage with people."

questions or concerns, I'd rather
they talk to me openly instead of
behind my back," Hans added.
Mitchell also has extensive expe
rience with college students.
Mitchell lived in a residence dorm at
Indiana University at Bloomington,

where she was in charge of commu
nity building in a dorm for 750 fresh
men from 1997 to 1999. As the
CCSRE service learning director at
Stanford, Mitchell helps students
develop internships and find public
services opportunities that build on

their academic interests, and she
said she hopes the Rl position will
help her connect with undergradu
ates.
The pair discussed their hope
that they would not be defined by
I lans' gender identity.
' We have no intention of being
known as the trans RF couple,"
Mitchell said. "But we'll accept that
label."
"We hope students will judge us
based on the work that we do and
how we engage with people," Hans
added. "When people realize how
comfortable 1 am in my skin, then
it's not an issue."
