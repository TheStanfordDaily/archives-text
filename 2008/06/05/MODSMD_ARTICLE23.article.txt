## New J-Ro RFs to bring diversity 
### SHELBY MARTIN DESK EDITOR 
Incoming Junipero Resident
Fellow (RF) Tania Mitchell's par
ents just have one quibble about her
partner of eight years.
"They don't talk about our rela
tionship being interracial, they don't
talk about Aaron being trans, but
they do talk about Aaron's septum
piercing," Mitchell said. "They say,
'Have you talked to him about that?
Is he taking it out yet?"
Mitchell and T. Aaron Hans will
be the new RFs in Junipero next fall.
Mitchell has worked as the Service
Learning Director for Stanford's
Center for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) for
the past academic year.
Hans, Mitchell's partner, works
as the Advocacy Program Manager
at the Gay-Straight Alliance
Network in San Francisco and will
be Stanford's first openly transgen
der Resident Fellow.
"It's just easier," Hans said,
explaining why he's chosen to be
upfront about his identity. "I don't
have to think about changing pro
nouns when I talk about playing
lacrosse in college."
"If you get to know me more
than 'How's the weather?' you usu
ally get told," he said. "If you
Google search me, you're going to
figure it out."

Hans cited the increasing num
bers of openly LGBT students on
college campuses as another moti
vation for his openness.
"1 believe that it is my responsi
bility to be out in a positive way for
young people," he said. "(As a col
lege student,] it was important for
me to see others who looked like
me, who struggled with similar iden
tity struggles and who allowed me to
see that I could grow up and be a
productive member of society."
"[Being out] is also about honor
ing and acknowledging who I am as
a whole person," Hans continued. "1
identify as transgender or gen
derqueer, but 1 don't necessarily
identify as a man. just like I didn't
necessarily identify as a woman."
Hans said he came out to
Junipero's Resident Assistant (RA)
applicants during the dorm's sec
ond-round interviews.
"There wasn't a whole lot of
reaction, which was refreshing,"
Hans said.
Mitchell explained that she and
Hans asked RA applicants to bring
in a few objects that said something
about their personal identity. Hans
and Mitchell talked about their
matching wristwatches, a symbol of
their commitment to each other.
"We're not married," Mitchell
said. "When people hear that, they
