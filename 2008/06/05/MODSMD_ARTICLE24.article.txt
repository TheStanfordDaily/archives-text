# FACULTY & STAFF
## Farm seeks to accommodate young faculty Extended tenure track offered to those looking to start a family 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faculty members often face challenges in bal
ancing a family and career, hut Stanford is taking
these challenges into account as the University
strives to recruit and retain young faculty.
Though the University aims to improve its
numbers of women faculty, women on the road
toward tenure — especially those planning for
pregnancy — face particular challenges in achiev
ing a balance between home and work.
"The stress of combining family life and aca
demic life is somewhat higher for women than for
men," said Vice Provost for Faculty Development
and Diversity Patricia Jones.
"They have to make a lot of choices males do
not have to make," added Work Life Office
Director Teresa Rasco. "How do they balance
that? How do they have a family?"
On the most basic level, the University pro
vides the option of a tenure clock extension for
new parents, allowing them an extra year to pre
pare the necessary work. Stanford also provides
the option of a quarter of reduced teaching work
so that faculty with steep time demands can
devote their free energies solely to research.
Another key concern is child care.
"Child care cost is also a big deal," Jones said.
"Like everything else in the area, it's expensive."
With such cost in mind, the University intro
duced in 2007 the Junior Faculty Child Care

Assistance Program, which specifically targets fac
ulty on their way toward tenure.The program pro
vides between $5,000 and $20,(XX) per year to the
families of eligible faculty members with a child
under five. For additional children under five,
$1,000 per child is also provided.
Stanford also features the more general Child
Care Subsidy Grant Program, which provides up
to $S,(XX) a year to help offset child care costs.
Many young faculty members are also con
cerned about the availability of child care. Waiting
lists are often long for area child care centers,
including those on campus. In keeping with this
concern, Stanford is expanding its on-campus
child care through the construction of a two-build
ing, $10 million "East Campus Child Care
Center."The first building is set to open in autumn
2008, while the second is set for autumn 2(X)9.
"We hope that by the time the second one is
built, the waiting list for faculty will be very short,"
Jones said.
Stanford is hoping to improve its efforts to pro
vide back-up and emergency child care for unex
pected situations — also in response to faculty
feedback.
"We've had a program in place," Jones said.
"But it hasn't been very useful because you still
have to make all the phone calls and the arrange
ments yourself."
"[Now] the University has contracted with
local providers, so if a child is sick, or you hire a
nanny and the nanny is sick, they help you make
arrangements, and the university covers most of
the cost," she added.
For the time being, the administration believes
that the programs currently in place are providing
a stable base for addressing the needs of faculty.

"When one looks at the number and quality of
programs on campus, you get the clear sense that
the goal is to support the faculty here," said
Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs Megan
Pierson.
Administrators emphasized that concerns
regarding child care have generally played a sec
ondary role in retaining and recruiting new facul
ty, and in the decisions made by those faculty.
"If you look at the reasons of people who
choose not to come, or leave, child care is not one
of the top, because you will face those issues any
where else," Jones said. "It's important to helping
our faculty to be successful and to manage both
family and career, but there are other factors that
are the main drivers."
But Rasco said the importance of child care in
faculty decisions cannot be completely down
played.
"It seems like new professors coming in are
coming into my office to ask about child care and
those kinds of services more and more." Rasco
said. "I think those types of services have become
increasingly important to their decision."
Administrators acknowledged that programs
will only play part of the role in addressing the
needs of new faculty, particularly in fighting long
term trends within the academy.
"1 think we'll need to monitor the effect of
these programs," Jones said. "ITiere are other
issues that are harder to take care of with a new
program, like the understanding of everyone on
campus — especially managers and administra
tors and department chairs — that arrangements
need to be made."
