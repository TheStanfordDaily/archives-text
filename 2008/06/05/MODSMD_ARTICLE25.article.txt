## GOLF ONE STROKE SHORT AT NCAAS 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
One stroke was the deciding factor as the
sixth-ranked men's Stanford golf team nar
rowly missed national glory this past week
end at the NCAA Championships, held at
Purdue University's Kampen Course. Stan
ford was only a putt away from becoming the
first team in nearly twenty years to repeat as
national champions, falling to the new na
tional champion. UCLA. The Cardinal fired
a strong 43-over hut it just wasn't
enough to overcome Kevin Chappell and the
rest of the Bruin competitors.
Stanford. Clemson. UCLA and USC pro
vided an exciting finish to four days of gruel
ing competition between the top collegiate
golf teams in the nation. Going into the final
holes of the tournament, the four teams were
all in the running to take the national crown
and it was anybody's game. Stanford would
have to deal with a strong wind from the west
but finished its final round first posting a 14-
over 302. the lowest scoring round of all three
teams on the day.
The next few hours of the tournament
would decide the team's season. Clemson fin
ished next with a 24-over 310 that solidified a
fourth place finish which left the cross-town
rivals to compete for bragging rights and the
title of the best team in the nation. With Stan
ford eagerly waiting in the wings, the Trojans
bent to pressure and finished just one stroke
behind the Cardinal, leaving the title decision
to the final team on the green.
UCLA's Chappell almost mis-stepped by
double-bogeying the 17th hole. But on the
18th. he got serious and became the hero of
the day for the Bruins, taking an even par
score on the final hole to dash Stanford's
hopes and seize the NCAA team and individ
ual titles.
thinking about four or five guys
playing those last three holes," head coach
Cotfrad Ray told'GoStanford.com directly
following the tournament. "If you can play
those holes a couple over... based on what
the scores were it seemed like 40 or 41 [over
par] was going to have a really good chance.

golfer except for senior captain Rob Grube, the Car

We needed a little help there at the end and
didn't get it, hut hats off to UCLA. They
played solid all week and really did it when
they needed to."
