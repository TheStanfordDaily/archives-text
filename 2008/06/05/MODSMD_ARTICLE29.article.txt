It may seem strange to say, hut
when I look at Major League
Baseball from a fan's perspective,
something seems to be missing from
the overall experience.
This is at a time when the league is
thriving, raking in the dough hand
over fist, and riding the wave of an ex
citing new talent surge that's brought
players like Tim Lincecum of the Gi
ants. Jay Bruce and Edinson Volquez
of the Reds. Josh Hamilton of the
Rangers, Evan Longoria of the Rays,
Carlos Quentin of the White Sox and
Justin Upton of the Diamondbacks
into the national spotlight in just the
past couple of years. And while all
these players have had varying levels
of success and varying amounts of
time at the big league level in which to
prove themselves so far, none look
like one year, or one month, wonders.
In short, if the signs, scouting re
ports and statistics are to be believed,
it is these young players among others
who will be the headliners for base
ball over the next decade. And that's
never been more important given the
economic trends that have been de
veloping of late, as franchises have
one by one come to the conclusion
that young talent is the currency of
MLB.
The truly clinching evidence is
hard to find, but the circumstantial is
everywhere. League-wide, it's be
come more and more difficult for
teams to pry young, promising
prospects from their rivals in ex
change for more proven veterans.
Consider that the Boston Red Sox
could have had Johan Santana last
offseason, widely considered perhaps
the most dominant starter in either
league at the time, for a package of
three youngsters who had yet to
prove themselves at the big league
level.
And they turned it down. The
Boston Red Sox. Not a team building
for a championship three or four or
five years down the line, but a team
whose objective is to win early and
win often. The time is now for these
