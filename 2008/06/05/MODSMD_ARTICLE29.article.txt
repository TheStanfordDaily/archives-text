# The 						other 'Draft day'
## 
### 
It may seem strange to say, hut
when I look at Major League
Baseball from a fan's perspective,
something seems to be missing from
the overall experience.
This is at a time when the league is
thriving, raking in the dough hand
over fist, and riding the wave of an ex
citing new talent surge that's brought
players like Tim Lincecum of the Gi
ants. Jay Bruce and Edinson Volquez
of the Reds. Josh Hamilton of the
Rangers, Evan Longoria of the Rays,
Carlos Quentin of the White Sox and
Justin Upton of the Diamondbacks
into the national spotlight in just the
past couple of years. And while all
these players have had varying levels
of success and varying amounts of
time at the big league level in which to
prove themselves so far, none look
like one year, or one month, wonders.
In short, if the signs, scouting re
ports and statistics are to be believed,
it is these young players among others
who will be the headliners for base
ball over the next decade. And that's
never been more important given the
economic trends that have been de
veloping of late, as franchises have
one by one come to the conclusion
that young talent is the currency of
MLB.
The truly clinching evidence is
hard to find, but the circumstantial is
everywhere. League-wide, it's be
come more and more difficult for
teams to pry young, promising
prospects from their rivals in ex
change for more proven veterans.
Consider that the Boston Red Sox
could have had Johan Santana last
offseason, widely considered perhaps
the most dominant starter in either
league at the time, for a package of
three youngsters who had yet to
prove themselves at the big league
level.
And they turned it down. The
Boston Red Sox. Not a team building
for a championship three or four or
five years down the line, but a team
whose objective is to win early and
win often. The time is now for these


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
Red Sox, and given the chance to add
one of the best pitchers in the game to
their roster, they turned it down be
cause they didn't want to diminish
their stockpile of young talent.
Now, that decision looks incredi
bly smart in retrospect, as Santana
has failed to dominate early with the
Mets, and youngsters like Jed
Lowrie, Jon Lester (who threw a no
hitter on May 19) and Jacoby Ells
bury have all shown signs of fulfilling
their promise. But at the time, there
were certainly some in Boston and
around the country who wondered
why one of the leading contenders
for the 2008 World Series hadn't
leapt at the chance to bolster their
rotation with Santana.

The reasoning behind this young
revolution sweeping the major
leagues is largely economic in ua
ture. Young players have their
salaries largely controlled for a
handful of years to start their ca
reers, and if a team scores a hit on a
young star they will have him locked
up at a tremendous value to their
club. And if they miss? Well, young
players who don't perform well are
much cheaper mistakes than proven
veterans who don't. Just ask outgo
ing San Francisco Giants Managing
General Partner Peter Magowan
about that Barry Zito signing if you
need proof.
So, with the youth movement fully
underway across major league base
ball, it's time for the draft to rise to
prominence. This year's incarnation
of the Annual First Year Player Draft
is set to begin Thursday, with players
mostly being picked in anonymity.
But in subsequent years, expect that

to change. As fans catch on to the ris
ing importance of young players, ex
pect the Draft to he covered more
and more heavily. In the future,
young players like Georgia high
school product Tim Beckham, Van
derbilt third baseman Pedro Alvarez,
and even mid first-round possibilities
like Stanford's own Jason Castro may
be household names before they're
even selected. Well, at least among
sports loving households.
The key factor here, really, is that
the MLB is truly missing an opportu
nity to shine. With the national atten
tion the rival NBA and NFL Drafts
have drawn year after year in recent
decades, sooner or later, the MLB
will too want to cash in. And along
the way, they may even realize that
it's in their best interests to correct
the most glaring flaw in the college
game: aluminum bats.
If baseball could pressure the
NCAA to allow only wood bats in

their games, it's likely more fans
would be drawn to the games, both
because of better aesthetics and be
cause suddenly the biggest hurdle to
their evaluation of college players as
potential future big leaguers would
be eliminated. Such a move would
ultimately benefit both MLB and
baseball programs' bottom lines,
making the switch seem inevitable
down the line.
So, if you find yourself, like me, fol
lowing the MLB Draft Thursday and
wondering if you're alone, fear not.
Aside from the chance to learn where
possible Stanford draftees such as
Erik Davis, Jeremy Bleich, Cord
Phelps, Sean Ratliff, Brent Milleville
and Randy Molina, among others, will
land, you'll be riding the wave of the
future of MLB. It's only a matter of
time before everyone else catches on.

future of MLB. It's only a matter of
time before everyone else catches on.
