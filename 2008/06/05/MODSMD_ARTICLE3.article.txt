# ADMINISTRATION
## Class size discussions to continue 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite widespread campus discus
sion regarding class size expansion, the
Stanford community should not expect
any decision in the near future, according
to University administrators taking part
in the decision-making process.
"This is not an imminent event," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman.
Though plans for formal expansion
may be far down the road —or may
never materialize at all — Stanford
recently experienced an unplanned class
size increase due to high yield in admis
sion cycles. This year's class of incoming
freshman will total approximately 1,727
students — about 57 more than the 1,670
target. And, at this time last year, 1,745 ini
tially signed with Stanford for the Class of
2011.
Initial interest in the idea arose with
University President John Hennessy's
column in the September/October issue
of Stanford magazine. Since January, the
pros and cons of expansion have been
examined by a task force, chaired by
Board of Trustees member Jim Canales
'88 M.A. '89 and English Department
Chair Ramon Saldivar.
The task force has spent much of win
ter and spring quarters gathering flata and
feedback and will continue to examine
the issue throughout the summer as it
moves toward a recommendation on
whether or not to expand class size.
"This is an issue we want to be very
careful with and very deliberate with,"
Saldivar said. "We want to make sure
we've covered all the bases."
Drawing upon the lessons of past
expansions, the task force will attempt
to be conservative in its planning if
Stanford does decide to expand the
size of the freshman class. The class
size increase would likely be stag
gered so as to avoid excessive impact.
"If we were talking about an
increase, we'd be talking about a
phased increase," Saldivar said. "This
wouldn't happen overnight
"Stanford last increased its class
size around 35 years ago, and that was
a phased hundred person increase per
year.
"One hundred to two hundred is a
range," said Jeff Wachtel, senior assis
tant to President Hennessy and a
member of the task force. "That's put
out there to help target analysis."
A central concern is ensuring that
a class size increase would not take
away from the quality of student life.
"We're looking at the quality of
the residential life experience,"
Wachtel said. "People are concerned
about whether or not that will be com
promised."
One benefit of expansion would be
the opportunity for more students to
pursue a high-quality education.
"We've built the finest undergrad
uate education anywhere," Bravman
said. "If we can offer it to 2,000 more
people per decade, we should do
that."
"You can look ahead 100 years,
and see the opportunity that educa
tion provides for additional, supreme
ly qualified students, and the promise
that holds," Saldivar added.
Any decision to expand the class
size would mean addressing an inter
connected set of logistical challenges.
Providing housing for students is
already a concern on campus due to
space issues, and any expansion would
require the addition of a significant
amount of student housing space.
"The first and biggest [concern] on
everyone's mind is housing," Wachtel
said. "We already have enough hous
ing, but things are pretty tight as it is."
A class size expansion would also
require an increased number of facul
ty
"We're always looking for the best
faculty," Bravman said. "But the total
faculty size has been growing very
slowly."
"We'd have to do an increase more
rapidly, and that's very difficult to do,"
he added.
The expansion would also require
funding to accommodate the addi
tional strain on financial aid, on-cam
pus staff, overseas campuses and other
needs. This would require a major
fundraising campaign and would have
to proceed independently from and
subsequently to the ongoing, five
year, $4.3 billion Stanford Challenge.
"The president and the Board of
TVustees would have to call for a
major campaign," Bravman said. "The
scope of something like this can't be
funded on the margins."
Logistical challenges and planning
considerations, however, will be sec
ondary to the final decision. Those
involved say the most important fac
tor is choosing the best course for the
University.
"No one doubts we could do this if
we wanted to," Bravman said.
"This is Stanford, after all,"
Saldivar added. "Think of all the huge
things we've accomplished here."
