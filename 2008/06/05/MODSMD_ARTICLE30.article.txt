## An open letter to the Commissioner 
### 
Dear Commissioner Goodell,
1 would like an explanation of the lat
est actions taken by the NFL.
On Monday, you granted Adam
"Pacman" Jones of the Dallas Cow
boys a partial reinstatement. That
means he can practice with his team,
but is not yet cleared to play. But as
ESPN's Matt Mosley points out, "You
don't allow a player to participate in
minicamps and preseason games if
you're not going to lift his suspension."
So in essence, you're giving Pacman the
green light.
Why?
When you took over for Paul Tagli
abue in 2(X)6, you made it a top priority
to clean up the unlawful and embar
rassing actions of your league's mem
bers. You introduced the NFL Personal
Conduct Policy and did not hesitate to
suspend players and coaches for their
transgressions.
The three poster boys for your new
rules were Jones, the Bengals' Chris
Henry and the Bears' Tank Johnson,
who all received suspensions in 2007.
I lenry was benched for eight games for
a litany of alcohol-related legal trou
bles. Johnson was ordered to sit for ten
games after serving jail time on
weapons charges.
But the worst offender was Pacman
Jones, who was suspended for the en
tire 2007 season for his despicable ac
tions. Since he was drafted in 2005,
Jones has been unable to stay out of
trouble. He has been arrested on six
separate occasions and brought in for
questioning by police a dozen times. At
some point, it stops being a matter of
"wrong place at the wrong time."
The list of charges against him is
both long and disturbing: disorderly
conduct, felony vandalism, public in
toxication, assault, obstruction of jus
tice and more. He has been involved in
multiple shootings and fights, the worst
of which was an incident at a strip club
in Las Vegas during the 2007 NBA All-
Star Game weekend, when Pacman
and his posse shot a security guard
twice, leaving him paralyzed from the
waist down.
Let me repeat this, Roger: Pacman
Jones left this man — Tommy Ur
banksi, a father — paralyzed. No, he
didn't hold the gun. But he started the
incident after assaulting one of the
dancers and then threatening Ur
banksi's life when the bouncer tried to
intervene. Pacman and his crew came
ever so close to fulfilling their promise
— if not for a few centimeters, Ur
banksi would likely be dead.
But that's not all: Jones later paid
$15,000 in extortion money to protect
himself after the people who allegedly
shot Urbanksi said that they would at
tack Jones if he did not pay them for
the hit.
This was the final straw for you,
Roger. You arranged for a meeting
with Jones that April to speak with the
young cornerback about his future in
the NFL. He was exactly the menace

you wanted out of your league.This sit
down was supposedly his final shot to
prove that he was worthy of keeping
his job.
So, what does he do? The night be
fore he's set to meet you, he heads out
to a New York strip club. Pacman does
not mix well with nightclubs — besides
the Las Vegas incident, most of his al
tercations have occurred at such insti
tutions And yet a mere few hours be
fore he was to offer his "mea culpa," he
decided to visit one. Pacman wasn't
sorry: these were exactly the same type
of actions he'd taken previously that
had eventually led to trouble.
You weren't impressed with Jones.
You suspended him for the season — it
had been nearly 50 years since such a
harsh punishment had been handed
down. You were so firm in your deci
sion that Pacman dropped his appeal
on his own accord — he knew it was
going nowhere.
Despite pledging to clean up his act,
Pacman was accused in January of this
year of beating a woman at — guess
where — a strip club. And so you stood
strong and reaffirmed that Pacman
Jones had no place in the NFL.
But then the darndest thing hap
pened: Jones was traded to the Dallas
Cowboys. It was a low risk trade: Dallas
gave up a fourth round pick and
banked on Pacman's reinstatement.
For all of his legal troubles, he re
mained a talented,young football play
er with superstar potential. But you still
had given no indication that you
changed your mind.

Now, though, you were dealing with
Jerry Jones, arguably the NFL's most
powerful owner who, throughout his
tenure, has created one of the largest
fan bases in professional sports. He is a
savvy businessman, which leads
Mosley to make an excellent point:
"Jerry Jones would never have traded
for Pacman if he wasn't convinced he
would be reinstated.
"The truth is that the Cowboys
owner exerts a tremendous amount of
influence in the league office," he con
tinued. "In fact, there are only a hand
ful of teams that could have secured
the reinstatement of such a notorious
player."
We know that Pacman hasn't "seen
the light." So why let him back in the
league? For a commissioner whose
tough persona has been lauded since
Day One, you caved. This was a spine
less decision that sets a dangerous
precedent. What happens when the
next Pacman Jones comes along —
and he will, as you've now opened the
door — but he plays in Kansas City?
Does he get reinstated, too? What mes
sage does this send to your league's
young fans ?
Pacman Jones should have been
banned indefinitely. It's that simple,
and you know it's right. But you caved.
ITiis reinstatement is as disgraceful
as Pacman Jones himself.
And it's on you, Roger.
