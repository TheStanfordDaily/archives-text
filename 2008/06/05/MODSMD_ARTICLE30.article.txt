## An open letter to the Commissioner 
### 
Dear Commissioner Goodell,
1 would like an explanation of the lat
est actions taken by the NFL.
On Monday, you granted Adam
"Pacman" Jones of the Dallas Cow
boys a partial reinstatement. That
means he can practice with his team,
but is not yet cleared to play. But as
ESPN's Matt Mosley points out, "You
don't allow a player to participate in
minicamps and preseason games if
you're not going to lift his suspension."
So in essence, you're giving Pacman the
green light.
Why?
When you took over for Paul Tagli
abue in 2(X)6, you made it a top priority
to clean up the unlawful and embar
rassing actions of your league's mem
bers. You introduced the NFL Personal
Conduct Policy and did not hesitate to
suspend players and coaches for their
transgressions.
The three poster boys for your new
rules were Jones, the Bengals' Chris
Henry and the Bears' Tank Johnson,
who all received suspensions in 2007.
I lenry was benched for eight games for
a litany of alcohol-related legal trou
bles. Johnson was ordered to sit for ten
games after serving jail time on
weapons charges.
But the worst offender was Pacman
Jones, who was suspended for the en
tire 2007 season for his despicable ac
tions. Since he was drafted in 2005,
Jones has been unable to stay out of
trouble. He has been arrested on six
separate occasions and brought in for
questioning by police a dozen times. At
some point, it stops being a matter of
"wrong place at the wrong time."
