# Card rides team effort
## Stanford ready for Super Regionals 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It's probably not surprising that
Cardinal players dominated the
Stanford Regional All-Tourna
ment team given the squad's even
tual victory over the field and its
advancing to the Super Regional to
face Cal State-Fullerton. But the
balance, depth, and versatility of
the Stanford team evinced by the
honors have been a Cardinal hall
mark all season long, and provide
Stanford with its greatest chance in
recent years to make some noise on
the national stage.
Junior catcher Jason Castro, jun
ior second baseman Cord Phelps,
junior centerfielder Sean Ratliff,
sophomore corner outfielder Toby
Gerhart, senior designated hitter
Randy Molina and freshman right
hander Danny Sandbrink made up
the sextet of players named to the
All-Tournament team from the
Stanford Regional, with Ratliff
picking up "Most Outstanding
Player" honors as well. Pepperdine
and UC-Davis came closest to
matching the Cardinal with two
players apiece named to the Team.
While Sandbrink's one-run
complete game speaks for itself,
and the Cardinal have had numer
ous contributions from other pitch
ers over the course of the season, it
has been the emergence of a bal
anced and potent offense that has
truly shocked many observers.
The departure of rightfielder
Michael Taylor, who anchored the
Cardinal's offense in 2007 with a
.979 OPS (and is currently having a
red hot season for the Phillies Sin
gle-A affiliate in Lakewood. NJ
with a .994 OPS) left some doubt as
to where the Stanford offense
would turn for its run production in
2008.

What followed was an offensive
explosion from Castro, Molina,jun
ior first baseman Brent Milleville,
Ratliff and Phelps that served to
carry the Cardinal quite ably
through the 2008 season. Led by its
multitude of offensive talents, the
Cardinal is hitting .300 as a team
through 61 games played and has
scored 457 runs compared to its op
ponents' cumulative mark of 324.
Yet of those players, only
Milleville's and Ratliff's offensive
dominance could have been pre
dicted by an outsider heading into
this season. Ratliff is the Cardinal's
biggest power threat, with 20
homeruns on the year (Phelps is
second with 13) while Milleville has
posted solid all around numbers,
consistent late-game heroics and a
valuable right-handed bat for the
lefty-heavy middle of the Cardinal
lineup.
Meanwhile, Castro who has
been the Cardinal's best all around
offensive threat in "08 and figures
to be the first Stanford player se
lected in Thursday's MLB Draft
(possibly as early as 18th overall to
the Mets, as some draft gurus have
speculated) struggled through an
injury marred 2007 season in which
he hit .167 in 102 at bats. Neither
did his freshman year, while solid
with a .283 average and on base
percentage just over .360, offer
much hint that such an emergence
was in store.
The story is much the same for
Molina, who could only eke out a
.662 OPS in 44 at bats last season.
His sophomore numbers are more
encouraging, though, with a .773
OPS, but his slugging percentage
was still a lackluster .346.
Even Cord Phelps, Stanford's
leadoff man extraordinaire this
season, emerged from relative ob
scurity as a sophomore to his cur
rent status as a team cornerstone.
His OBP has jumped by more than
70 points to his team leading .447
while his batting average has risen
from just over .300 to .357.
While the impact of the recent
hot streak provided by Toby Ger
hart, the depth of Stanford's pitch
ing, and defense and solid overall
play by numerous other players
cannot be denied, the emergence of
such a vast array of legitimately po
tent threats has been the true cause
of the Cardinal's resurgence from a
.500 record in 2007 to the Super Re
gional and possibly beyond in 08.

So when you're looking to as
sign credit for baseball's latest
romp through the postseason,
don't forget the veteran coaching
staff assembled by Mark Marquess
and the work they've done in
bringing the Stanford offense
along. This season, perhaps more
than any other in recent memory,
is a testament of just how much
players can improve with a little
luck and plenty of hard work.

It's enough to lend some hope
to the notion that even with the
impending departure of so many
contributors to professional base
ball following this season, the Car
dinal just might be okay in 2009 if
it can develop its own talent as well
as it did this season.
