## Univ. to still admit two-year college transfers 
### JULIANNE STERN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate
Admission recently announced that,
because an unexpectedly high num
ber of students admitted to the class
of 2012 accepted their offers of
admission, the number of transfer
admits this year would be halved
from 40 to 20.
In mid-May. the admission office
reported a record yield rate of 72
percent for the class of 2012. mean
ing that the University could expect
1,727 new freshmen next year.
In spite of the radically reduced
size of the transfer class. Director of
Admission Shawn Abbott said in an
email that the Office of Admission
remains committed to its tradition of
selecting a majority of transfer
admits from applicants studying at
two-year and community colleges.
Because transfer students are
notified of their admission decisions
at least a month later than freshman
applicants, the admission office had
time to adjust the size of next year's
transfer class in order to accommo
date the oversized class of 2012.
"Because of our recent freshman
yield and our unusually high fresh
man-to-sophomore retention rate,
we have very little room to accom
modate new transfer students,"
Abbott wrote.
In a previous email to The Daily,
Abbott had cited the reduced rate of
transfer admission as a "negative
consequence" of this year's record
freshman yield. In each of the past
two years, the admission rate for
transfer applicants was only 1 to 2
percent.
Traditionally, just over half of
transfer admits are students transfer
ring from community colleges and
other two-year institutions.
"There is a huge misconception
that we favor students from elite uni
versities in the transfer admission
process when, in reality, the majority
of admits come from community col
leges," Abbott said.
The admission director also said
transfer applicants from community
colleges can often bring the most
unusual life experiences to campus.
"Many haven't had the traditional
high school to traditional college
path and are often among the most
interesting' candidates we review,"
he said.
Kee Hoon Chung '08 is one such
student. Chung transferred to
Stanford two years ago after spend
ing three years at Foothill College, a
community college in Los Altos.
Before enrolling at Foothill, Chung
spent over two years serving in the

Korean military.
"[Military service] is where 1 real
ized 1 want to do something good for
my life and my country," Chung said.
"Serving in the Korean military. I
realized that my interests lay in poli
tics."
Prior to his military service,
Chung had spent a disastrous year at
American University, eventually
dropping out with a CiPA of only 0.5.
Because of his academic record,
Chung was rejected by all of the
schools to which he applied after
leaving the military.
"I was kind of stuck with no place

"There is a huge mis
conception that we
favor students from
elite universities."

to go, and then I remember someone
telling my sister that there's a college
called Foothill in California, and, it
you do really well, you can go to
Stanford," Chung said.
Chung said he set his sights on
Stanford because "academic credibil
ity" is crucial to political success in
Korea, and he was attracted by
Stanford's reputation for having
well-rounded students.
Although Chungs advisor at
Foothill cautioned him that Stanford
was extremely selective in admitting
transfers, Chung could not be dis
couraged. He was accepted to
Stanford as a transfer student after
completing three years at Foothill.
At Stanford. Chung said his back
ground made his accomplishments
all the more meaningful. He also felt
that his performance reflected on
other transfer students from commu
nity colleges.
"I had a mindset that I should do
really well, because if I don't do well,
it might affect future community col
lege students who apply to
Stanford," Chung said. "That's one
thing I really like about Stanford,
that they accept a lot of community
college students."
