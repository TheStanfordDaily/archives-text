## Seniors sign sustainability pledge 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Seniors now have the opportunity to voice
their commitment to environmental stewardship after
graduation through the 2008 grad pledge. The online
pledge, which is sponsored by the Stanford Students for
Sustainability (SSS), is part of a national graduation
pledge movement intended to remind students of their
responsibility to the world as they embark on their
future careers.
"I pledge to explore and take into account the social
and environmental consequences of any job I consider,
and 1 will try to improve these aspects of any organiza
tions for which I work." reads the online pledge, which
can be signed at
http://sustainability.stanford.edu/pledge.html.
According to pledge coordinator Sarah Rizk '08. the
pledge is an opportunity for graduating seniors to make
a statement about their commitment to creating a sus
tainable future. Rizk said the statement has symbolic
value and reminds seniors that the decisions they make
in their careers can have an enormous environmental
impact.
"1 think it reinforces the values that students already
have," Rizk said. "I think that it reminds them of the
social responsibility they have as a cognizant citizen
leaving Stanford University."
According to Rizk. the pledge was started in 2002 by
a student as the culminating project of a class held by
environmental group Acterra. Because the pledge is
part of the broader national graduation pledge move
ment. SSS is not involved in the actual writing of the

pledge. Past year's pledges, which are available on the
Web site, have been significantly longer, enumerating
specific points about what students can do to promote
environmental sustainability.
Three-year SSS member Carolyn Mansfield '08, who
is also involved with the pledge, said involvement with
the national movement aims to show solidarity across
college campuses.
"We are not involved in the network in an active
way," Mansfield said. "We're plugging into the general
sentiment on college campuses."
Student response to the pledge has been strong.
According to Rizk, more than 100 students signed when
the list was first posted online. Mansfield said awareness
of the pledge was spread mainly through word of mouth
and email lists.
Ming Zhi '08 said signing the pledge was important
because he sees the environment as one of the top pri
orities of the current generation.
"Students being educated for four years at Stanford
have this responsibility to take care of the environment
and protect it for future generations," Zhi said.
Mansfield said that, in addition to the pledge, SSS is
handing out green ribbons to graduates that can be
pinned to their graduation gowns. Students can also
leave personal statements and affirmations to uphold
the pledge.
"The ribbon symbol is one of commitment to a
cause," Mansfield said. "More than being an achieve
ment. it's something that's aiming towards the future."
