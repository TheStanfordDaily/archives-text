## Gender-neutral pilot off to slow start 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 2008-2009 school year will he
the first in which students may live in
gender-neutral rooms. Fewer groups,
however, decided to draw into gender
neutral rooms than some staff expected
in all four undergraduate residences —
Narnia. Terra, Castano and Mirrielees
— that are part of the gender-neutral
housing pilot program.
"Surprisingly, nobody requested
gender-neutral housing," said 2008-
2009 Narnia Residential Computing
Consultant (RCC) Jon Merola '09,
referring to his house. "So everyone is
going to be living same sex."
In Terra, six pairs of roommates
decided to room gender-neutral next
year. Because Terra consists mainly of

two-room doubles. 12 of the 46 resi
dents who drew into Terra will be living
in mixed-gender rooms.
"Terra has unofficially been accom
modating mixed-gender rooms for
years before this, so the process was no
different this year than last year." said
Matt Bush '10, Terra's kitchen manager
for next year.
Historically, Terra has adopted a
hands-off policy regarding its residents'
living situations and arrangements.
"To my knowledge, there have not
been any complaints from other resi
dents in Terra about gender-neutral
roommate pairs," said Yoni Teitelbaum
'09, Terra's house manager for next
year. "Though, in the past, there have
been instances where residents learned
about the gender-neutral rooming at
Terra and moved out within the first

week of the quarter."
Draw groups hoping to live in
mixed-gender rooms had to sign a con
tract with Housing a few days prior to
the in-house Draw. Part of the contract
stipulates that gender-neutral housing
is not meant for romantic couples.
"It's pretty much left to the hands of
the people who want to live in gender
neutral rooms to ensure that they
understand that policy," Teitelbaum
added.
In Mirrielees, seven groups of three
decided to room in mixed-gender
rooms.
"A lot fewer people drew gender
neutral than I expected," said Kevin
Dumolga '09. a Mirrielees Resident
Assistant (RA) for next year. "One rea
