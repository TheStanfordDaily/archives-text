# STUDENT LIFE
## Gender-neutral pilot off to slow start 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 2008-2009 school year will he
the first in which students may live in
gender-neutral rooms. Fewer groups,
however, decided to draw into gender
neutral rooms than some staff expected
in all four undergraduate residences —
Narnia. Terra, Castano and Mirrielees
— that are part of the gender-neutral
housing pilot program.
"Surprisingly, nobody requested
gender-neutral housing," said 2008-
2009 Narnia Residential Computing
Consultant (RCC) Jon Merola '09,
referring to his house. "So everyone is
going to be living same sex."
In Terra, six pairs of roommates
decided to room gender-neutral next
year. Because Terra consists mainly of

two-room doubles. 12 of the 46 resi
dents who drew into Terra will be living
in mixed-gender rooms.
"Terra has unofficially been accom
modating mixed-gender rooms for
years before this, so the process was no
different this year than last year." said
Matt Bush '10, Terra's kitchen manager
for next year.
Historically, Terra has adopted a
hands-off policy regarding its residents'
living situations and arrangements.
"To my knowledge, there have not
been any complaints from other resi
dents in Terra about gender-neutral
roommate pairs," said Yoni Teitelbaum
'09, Terra's house manager for next
year. "Though, in the past, there have
been instances where residents learned
about the gender-neutral rooming at
Terra and moved out within the first

week of the quarter."
Draw groups hoping to live in
mixed-gender rooms had to sign a con
tract with Housing a few days prior to
the in-house Draw. Part of the contract
stipulates that gender-neutral housing
is not meant for romantic couples.
"It's pretty much left to the hands of
the people who want to live in gender
neutral rooms to ensure that they
understand that policy," Teitelbaum
added.
In Mirrielees, seven groups of three
decided to room in mixed-gender
rooms.
"A lot fewer people drew gender
neutral than I expected," said Kevin
Dumolga '09. a Mirrielees Resident
Assistant (RA) for next year. "One rea
son may he that some groups didn't
know they had to sign up for gender
neutral housing before the in-house
Draw."
"At least one or two groups that
wanted to room gender-neutral
missed the sign-up deadline and had
to re-arrange their Draw group,"
Dumolga added.
The new mixed-gender rooming
option did not affect the in-house
Draw at Mirrielees or Terra. At
these two houses, those hoping to
room in mixed-gender rooms fol
lowed the same procedure as other

Draw groups in terms of choosing
rooms.
But in Castano, those who decid
ed to room mixed-gender were
offered the choice of specific two
room doubles prior to the regular in
house Draw.
"The [Residence Student Affairs
Specialist] of Manzunita, Michael
Gray, set aside three two-room dou
bles, one on each floor, for the six
people that wanted mixed-gender
rooming," said 2008-2009 Castano
RA Rowza Rumma '10. "This only
affected the in-house Draw in that
there were fewer two-room doubles
to choose from for the other Draw
groups."
