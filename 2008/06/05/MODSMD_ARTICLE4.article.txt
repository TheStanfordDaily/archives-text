# FEEUN' SUPER: CARD ADVANCES
## Stanford one step away FROM COLLEGE WORLD SERIES 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after

game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."
Friday: UC Davis 4, Stanford 2
