# FEEUN' SUPER: CARD ADVANCES
## Stanford one step away FROM COLLEGE WORLD SERIES 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after

game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."
Friday: UC Davis 4, Stanford 2

Freshman Danny Sandbrink came up big in the Cardinal's 13-1 victory over Pepperdine on
Sunday. Stanford wilt now take on Cal State-Fullerfon in this weekend's Super Regionals.
Cord Phelps' leadoff double in the
first and junior Sean Ratliffs double
in the fourth to drive in senior Randy
Molina, gave the Cardinal a 2-0 lead
heading into the top of the seventh.
But Davis refused to go quietly in
its first game of the Regional, hitting
two singles, drawing a pair of walks,
smacking a two-RBI double and lay
ing down a sacrifice bunt to the pitch
er in a four-run inning for the Aggies.
Davis starter Eddie Gamboa, who
had excelled in limiting the Cardinal
to just two runs and four hits through
the first five innings, slammed the
door shut starting in the sixth, no-hit
ting Stanford over the remaining four
frames for a complete-game victory.
The loss was the Cardinal's third
of the year against Davis, which had
won 9-8 in 12 innings on April 9 and
10-8 on April 30. It was the Aggies'
first ever postseason baseball victory
as a Division I program.
Saturday: Stanford 5, Arkansas 1
The stories of the day for the Car
dinal, as it began its journey back up
through the Regional, were the out
standing pitching performances of
juniors Austin Yount and lefty Jere
my Bleich. Yount got the start for the
Cardinal, coming off of the first com
plete game of his career, a 9-4 regular
season win over Washington on May
23, and was spectacular yet again.
Yount demonstrated excellent
control, going five innings with no
walks, five strikeouts and seven hits.
He limited the Razorbacks to one
run, which came courtesy of three
consecutive two-out singles in the
fifth inning.
Bleich. the Cardinal's ace early in
the season who had been limited by
injury since March, came on in relief
of Yount to start the sixth, and was
somewhat of a mirror image to his
right-handed counterpart. Where
Yount had excelled in limiting his
walks issued, Bleich proved to be
much less hittable but struggled with
his control, allowing only two hits
over the final four innings but walk
ing five. Still, no runners crossed
home plate on Bleich's watch as he
earned his first save of the season.
The Cardinal offense, meanwhile,
was propelled by Molina, who hit a
solo homerun to lead off the second
inning for Stanford, and went 3-for-4

while scoring three of his team's five
runs on the day.
Sunday: Stanford 8, UC-Davis 4
The Cardinal's problem with the
Aggies pushed the team one step
closer to the brink of elimination be
fore junior first baseman Brent
Milleville added yet another late
game blast to his laundry list of hero
ics on the year.
With Stanford trailing 4-3 enter
ing the top half of the ninth inning,
Milleville put the Cardinal on top
with his two-run shot to left after jun
ior Jason Castro reached base on an
error to lead off the inning. Stanford
followed through with another three
runs of insurance, but that proved un
necessary as it went on to win 8-4.
"I was up in a big situation and 1
was trying to hit a line drive because
1 didn't want to hit into a double
play," Milleville told
GoStanford.com."l got a fastball and
I hit it, I wasn't thinking too much
and 1 was just able to hit the ball well.
After I hit it 1 knew it was going to be
a home run, which got me pretty ex
cited."
Sophomore Jeffrey Inman and
freshman Drew Storen combined to
limit the Aggies to four runs on
eleven hits, with lnman going seven
innings strong in allowing just three
earned runs and one unearned. Ju
niors Cord Phelps and Jason Castro
and freshman Jake Schlander sup
ported Milleville's efforts offensively
with 3-5 days at the plate. Phelps and
Schlander also each chipped in a pair
of RBI to match Milleville.
Sunday: Stanford 13, Pepperdine 1
After triumphing in dramatic
fashion in the ninth inning of its sec
ond postseason opportunity against
Davis, the Cardinal came into its sec
ond game on Sunday knowing it
would need two wins in a row over
Pepperdine in order to secure the
Regional title. But Stanford got some
help from an unheralded source, as
freshman Danny Sandbrink, making
just his fifth start of the year, went the
full nine innings against the Waves
for his first collegiate complete game.
"We felt he was a pitcher who was
capable of going deep into the game
for us," Marquess said in a press con
ference following the win."We didn't
necessarily think he was going to
throw nine inning for us, but we knew
he was capable of pitching well for us.
He got the big lead early and threw
the ball over the plate and really had
a strong command today. It was a

huge effort on Sandbrink's part."
"I just came into the game think
ing one pitch at a time and one inning
at a time," the freshman starter said.
"I wasn't thinking two innings down
the line and 1 just wanted to locate
my pitches and work on putting up
zeroes on the scoreboard."
Sandbrink, a right-hander out of
St. Louis, was dominant, allowing just
one run — which came on a solo shot
in the sixth — on six hits and a walk
while striking out six. But his team
mates made sure to give him plenty
of support as well.
The Cardinal offense poured it on
early and had amassed 11 runs
through the first four innings —
plenty more than enough for the
freshman emerging on the mound.
Phelps, sophomore Toby Gerhart,
and Castro, who batted first to third,
respectively in Stanford's lineup for
the day, each hit a homerun to back
up Sandbrink's effort. Phelps and
Gerhart each notched three runs
scored on the day, while Castro led
the Cardinal with three RBIs on the
day.
Monday: Stanford 9, Pepperdine 7
After winning three in a row, Stan
ford needed just one more victory
over the Waves to advance to the
Super Regional round, and handed
the ball to one of its senior leaders,
Erik Davis, who got the start on very
little rest. But while Davis displayed
plenty of confidence and courage, he
was unable to find his usual form, al
lowing five runs in just 2.2 innings of
work.
"1 was impressed with Erik Davis
wanting the ball," Marquess said.
"Obviously he wasn't as sharp as he
can be, with only two days rest."
Storen and Yount would come on
in relief and help the Cardinal stop
the bleeding. Storen went four in
nings and allowed just two runs, and
Pepperdine was unable to muster a
single hit against Yount over the final
2.1.
The Stanford offense, meanwhile,
began to chip away at the Waves'
lead, but had its one-run efforts in the
third and fourth answered by Pep
perdine in the bottom halves of both
innings. But a six-run fifth inning
loosened all the pent-up tension of
the home crowd at Sunken Dia
mond. as the Cardinal came to life
with a great display of patience and
power.
After a pair of leadoff walks, Cas
tro knocked a two-RBI double to left
center. Milleville was then hit by a
pitch before Molina went down 0-2 in
the count, but displayed a fantastic
eye in laying off a couple of close
pitches to load the bases with a walk.
Stanford's power leader, junior Sean
Ratliff then belted his second home
run of the game, a grand slam to right.

which cleared the wall just left of the
new scoreboard. The Cardinal would
add an insurance run in the seventh,
hut it proved unnecessary in the 9-7
victory.
"As 1 mentioned before, I'm just
as proud of this team as any I've had,"
Marquess told GoStanford.com fol
lowing the game. They've really bat
tled through a lot of adversity. There
were very low expectations and they
did a great, great job."
Up Next: Super Regional vs. Cal State-
Fullerton
The Cardinal will next face Cal
State-Fullerton (41-20) in a best of
three series in the Super Regional
Round of the NCAA Champi
onships. Stanford swept the Titans in
three games early this season at
Sunken Diamond —12-5, 11-7, and
6-5 from Feb. 29-March 2 — and will
look to continue its success starting
Friday, this time in Fullerton. The
Cardinal has not won a road series in
the Titans' home park since 2001.
Fullerton was dominant in its
opening win of the postseason over
Rider. 11 -0. But an 11-4 second game
loss against UCLA put the Titans'
backs against the wall. Fullerton, too,
triumphed in a series of edge-of
their-seat wins, topping Virginia 4-1
before needing to defeat the Bruins
twice consecutively, which thev did,
11-8 and 5-4.

Cardinal has not won a road series in
the Titans' home park since 2001.
Fullerton was dominant in its
opening win of the postseason over
Rider. 11 -0. But an 11-4 second game
loss against UCLA put the Titans'
backs against the wall. Fullerton, too,
triumphed in a series of edge-of
their-seat wins, topping Virginia 4-1
before needing to defeat the Bruins
twice consecutively, which thev did,
11-8 and 5-4.

The story of the weekend for Stanford
baseball was one of falling behind early
which made the victories all the more dra
matic when they came. After dropping it
opening game in the four-team double-elimi
nation NCAA Regional bracket last Friday,
the Cardinal's back was up against the wall.
Stanford needed four wins in a row, or its
postseason hopes of a return to Omaha. Neb.
and the College World Series for the first
time since 2003 would evaporate.
The pressure mounted in game after

game, as Stanford battled back, one win at a
time, knocking first Arkansas, then UC-Davis
and finally Pepperdine out of the
Tournament to at last emerge as the champi
on of the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"Anytime you lose the first game and
come back to win four in a row, that's very
hard to do with this competition," Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess told GoStanford.com
following his team's final win of the Regional
on Monday. "It's very difficult, almost impos
sible. 1 didn't tell the guys that, but it's tough
to do that."

JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Danny Sandbrink came up big in the Cardinal's 13-1 victory over Pepperdine on
Sunday. Stanford wilt now take on Cal State-Fullerfon in this weekend's Super Regionals.
Cord Phelps' leadoff double in the
first and junior Sean Ratliffs double
in the fourth to drive in senior Randy
Molina, gave the Cardinal a 2-0 lead
heading into the top of the seventh.
But Davis refused to go quietly in
its first game of the Regional, hitting
two singles, drawing a pair of walks,
smacking a two-RBI double and lay
ing down a sacrifice bunt to the pitch
er in a four-run inning for the Aggies.
Davis starter Eddie Gamboa, who
had excelled in limiting the Cardinal
to just two runs and four hits through
the first five innings, slammed the
door shut starting in the sixth, no-hit
ting Stanford over the remaining four
frames for a complete-game victory.
The loss was the Cardinal's third
of the year against Davis, which had
won 9-8 in 12 innings on April 9 and
10-8 on April 30. It was the Aggies'
first ever postseason baseball victory
as a Division I program.
Saturday: Stanford 5, Arkansas 1
The stories of the day for the Car
dinal, as it began its journey back up
through the Regional, were the out
standing pitching performances of
juniors Austin Yount and lefty Jere
my Bleich. Yount got the start for the
Cardinal, coming off of the first com
plete game of his career, a 9-4 regular
season win over Washington on May
23, and was spectacular yet again.
Yount demonstrated excellent
control, going five innings with no
walks, five strikeouts and seven hits.
He limited the Razorbacks to one
run, which came courtesy of three
consecutive two-out singles in the
fifth inning.
Bleich. the Cardinal's ace early in
the season who had been limited by
injury since March, came on in relief
of Yount to start the sixth, and was
somewhat of a mirror image to his
right-handed counterpart. Where
Yount had excelled in limiting his
walks issued, Bleich proved to be
much less hittable but struggled with
his control, allowing only two hits
over the final four innings but walk
ing five. Still, no runners crossed
home plate on Bleich's watch as he
earned his first save of the season.
The Cardinal offense, meanwhile,
was propelled by Molina, who hit a
solo homerun to lead off the second
inning for Stanford, and went 3-for-4

while scoring three of his team's five
runs on the day.
Sunday: Stanford 8, UC-Davis 4
The Cardinal's problem with the
Aggies pushed the team one step
closer to the brink of elimination be
fore junior first baseman Brent
Milleville added yet another late
game blast to his laundry list of hero
ics on the year.
With Stanford trailing 4-3 enter
ing the top half of the ninth inning,
Milleville put the Cardinal on top
with his two-run shot to left after jun
ior Jason Castro reached base on an
error to lead off the inning. Stanford
followed through with another three
runs of insurance, but that proved un
necessary as it went on to win 8-4.
"I was up in a big situation and 1
was trying to hit a line drive because
1 didn't want to hit into a double
play," Milleville told
GoStanford.com."l got a fastball and
I hit it, I wasn't thinking too much
and 1 was just able to hit the ball well.
After I hit it 1 knew it was going to be
a home run, which got me pretty ex
cited."
Sophomore Jeffrey Inman and
freshman Drew Storen combined to
limit the Aggies to four runs on
eleven hits, with lnman going seven
innings strong in allowing just three
earned runs and one unearned. Ju
niors Cord Phelps and Jason Castro
and freshman Jake Schlander sup
ported Milleville's efforts offensively
with 3-5 days at the plate. Phelps and
Schlander also each chipped in a pair
of RBI to match Milleville.
Sunday: Stanford 13, Pepperdine 1
After triumphing in dramatic
fashion in the ninth inning of its sec
ond postseason opportunity against
Davis, the Cardinal came into its sec
ond game on Sunday knowing it
would need two wins in a row over
Pepperdine in order to secure the
Regional title. But Stanford got some
help from an unheralded source, as
freshman Danny Sandbrink, making
just his fifth start of the year, went the
full nine innings against the Waves
for his first collegiate complete game.
"We felt he was a pitcher who was
capable of going deep into the game
for us," Marquess said in a press con
ference following the win."We didn't
necessarily think he was going to
throw nine inning for us, but we knew
he was capable of pitching well for us.
He got the big lead early and threw
the ball over the plate and really had
a strong command today. It was a

huge effort on Sandbrink's part."
"I just came into the game think
ing one pitch at a time and one inning
at a time," the freshman starter said.
"I wasn't thinking two innings down
the line and 1 just wanted to locate
my pitches and work on putting up
zeroes on the scoreboard."
Sandbrink, a right-hander out of
St. Louis, was dominant, allowing just
one run — which came on a solo shot
in the sixth — on six hits and a walk
while striking out six. But his team
mates made sure to give him plenty
of support as well.
The Cardinal offense poured it on
early and had amassed 11 runs
through the first four innings —
plenty more than enough for the
freshman emerging on the mound.
Phelps, sophomore Toby Gerhart,
and Castro, who batted first to third,
respectively in Stanford's lineup for
the day, each hit a homerun to back
up Sandbrink's effort. Phelps and
Gerhart each notched three runs
scored on the day, while Castro led
the Cardinal with three RBIs on the
day.
Monday: Stanford 9, Pepperdine 7
After winning three in a row, Stan
ford needed just one more victory
over the Waves to advance to the
Super Regional round, and handed
the ball to one of its senior leaders,
Erik Davis, who got the start on very
little rest. But while Davis displayed
plenty of confidence and courage, he
was unable to find his usual form, al
lowing five runs in just 2.2 innings of
work.
"1 was impressed with Erik Davis
wanting the ball," Marquess said.
"Obviously he wasn't as sharp as he
can be, with only two days rest."
Storen and Yount would come on
in relief and help the Cardinal stop
the bleeding. Storen went four in
nings and allowed just two runs, and
Pepperdine was unable to muster a
single hit against Yount over the final
2.1.
The Stanford offense, meanwhile,
began to chip away at the Waves'
lead, but had its one-run efforts in the
third and fourth answered by Pep
perdine in the bottom halves of both
innings. But a six-run fifth inning
loosened all the pent-up tension of
the home crowd at Sunken Dia
mond. as the Cardinal came to life
with a great display of patience and
power.
After a pair of leadoff walks, Cas
tro knocked a two-RBI double to left
center. Milleville was then hit by a
pitch before Molina went down 0-2 in
the count, but displayed a fantastic
eye in laying off a couple of close
pitches to load the bases with a walk.
Stanford's power leader, junior Sean
Ratliff then belted his second home
run of the game, a grand slam to right.

which cleared the wall just left of the
new scoreboard. The Cardinal would
add an insurance run in the seventh,
hut it proved unnecessary in the 9-7
victory.
"As 1 mentioned before, I'm just
as proud of this team as any I've had,"
Marquess told GoStanford.com fol
lowing the game. They've really bat
tled through a lot of adversity. There
were very low expectations and they
did a great, great job."
Up Next: Super Regional vs. Cal State-
Fullerton
The Cardinal will next face Cal
State-Fullerton (41-20) in a best of
three series in the Super Regional
Round of the NCAA Champi
onships. Stanford swept the Titans in
three games early this season at
Sunken Diamond —12-5, 11-7, and
6-5 from Feb. 29-March 2 — and will

Up Next: Super Regional vs. Cal State-
Fullerton
The Cardinal will next face Cal
State-Fullerton (41-20) in a best of
three series in the Super Regional
Round of the NCAA Champi
onships. Stanford swept the Titans in
three games early this season at
Sunken Diamond —12-5, 11-7, and
6-5 from Feb. 29-March 2 — and will
look to continue its success starting
Friday, this time in Fullerton. The
Cardinal has not won a road series in
the Titans' home park since 2001.
Fullerton was dominant in its
opening win of the postseason over
Rider. 11 -0. But an 11-4 second game
loss against UCLA put the Titans'
backs against the wall. Fullerton, too,
triumphed in a series of edge-of
their-seat wins, topping Virginia 4-1
before needing to defeat the Bruins
twice consecutively, which thev did,
11-8 and 5-4.
