## Potential football recruit killed in shooting 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Football had contacted the
coach of Los Angeles High School earlier
this year to inquire about 17-year-old
Jamiel Shaw, a star running back whose ath
letic abilities had earned him the distinction
of the Southern League's most valuable
player during his junior year.
About a week or two later, Jamiel was
shot dead just a few doors away from his
home.
Jamiel Shaw, Sr. said his son was return
ing home from a shopping mall on March 2
when a Latino man opened fire from a

nearby car.
Jamiel Sr. said he heard the gunshots
crack through the air and ran out to find his
son bleeding on the ground. Jamiel was
transported to the hospital, where he was
later pronounced dead.
"It was the worst feeling," Jamiel Sr. said
of his son's passing. "You're just stuck in
grief mode, and you can't get out of it. You
can't control your thinking. You just go
berserk."
Los Angeles Police Department officers
arrested Pedro Espinoza on March 14 in
connection with the shooting. Prosecutors
said Espinoza is allegedly a member of the
18th Street gang in Los Angeles and had

been released from jail on weapons charges
just one day before the shooting.
Authorities said Shaw was not a gang
member and called the shooting a random,
unprovoked gang attack.
Jamiel Sr. was dedicated to making sure
his son would make all the right decisions.
He said he had made an "18-year-plan" for
his son that would help him stay out of trou
ble and put him on a path to a bright future.
"If you stay out of trouble, mixed with
sports, with good grades, you're going to
make it," Jamiel Sr. said.
Following the advice of experts who said
parents should keep their kids
involved in sports. Jamiel Sr. signed his
son up for little league sports almost
every season and would often coach
the teams himself.
The plan sometimes called for
what Jamiel Sr. called "tough love."
'The night before Jamiel was mur
dered. his father refused to allow him
to attend a party because he worried
he might get shot.
It took "a lot of love, a lot of smoth
ering," Jamiel Sr. said. "I kept him
busy."
Jamiel Sr. said his son thought the
plan was crazy at first, but slowly
Jamiel became more receptive. He
remained dedicated to sports and
started having dreams of becoming a
physical therapist or a sports agent.
"Eighteen was like his independ
ence day," Jamiel Sr. said. "We built it
up to a time when you can control
your life, be in college, start your life
oft"
"He bought into it," Jamiel Sr.
added. "He stayed out of trouble."
By the time his son turned 17,
Jamiel Sr. said the plan was almost
complete. Jamiel had become a star
on the football field and was being
watched by many top schools. He
said his son was excited when he
returned from school one day
because his coach told him that
Stanford had called inquiring about
his transcripts.
"When he said Stanford, that woke
everybody up." Jamiel Sr. said. "That
made everyone realize this was big
time."
Jamiel Sr. said the plan ended when
he saw his son's body bleeding on the
sidewalk.

"TTiat's what makes it so bad," he
said. "We think that if we keep them
out of trouble, we'll keep them out of
harm's way."
Jamiel Sr. said he had just talked to
his son minutes before the shooting,
telling him to hurry home. When he
heard the gun shots go off, he called
his son back to see where he was.
Jamiel didn't answer.
Jamiel's father bolted out the front
door at full speed, turned the corner
and saw his son laying down on the
street. He said he pulled his son's face
up to his own and saw a bullet hole in
his head with his chest bleeding.
Neighbors had come out to wrestle
him away.
"It just devastated everything,"
Jamiel Sr. said. "You're going 1 (X)
miles per hour and then you hit a brick
wall."
Jamiel Sr. said he refused to believe
his son was dead and sat in the emer
gency for hours, telling himself that his
son was just in surgery and would be
coming out soon. 1 le went home later
that night thinking this whole thing
must be a nightmare. But when he
woke up, Jamiel Sr. said he had the
same feeling in his chest as when he
heard the gun shots the night before.
"I could still see the blood on the
sidewalk," he said.
Jamiel's mother. Army Sgt. Anita
Shaw, had been serving in her second
tour of duty in Iraq when she was
informed that her son was murdered.
Jamiel Sr. said that she was hysterical
on the same flight with soldiers who
were celebrating their return home.
"That was the worst day of her
life," he said.
Jamiel Sr. said his younger son.
Thomas, 9. was close to his older
brother and wanted to be like him. He
recalled an incident where shortly
after his brother's death. Thomas
asked him whether he was going to be
killed too.

"1 le knows it's serious." Jamiel Sr.
said, "but not how serious."
Jamiel Sr. said he couldn't take
reading about all of the reports of his
son's death but that the response from
the community was overwhelming.
Among the messages broadcast
was one from Stanford Football
Coach Jim I iarbaugh.
"All of our prayers go out to Jamiel
Shaw and his family." Harbaugh said
in a statement soon after the shooting.
"Jamiel was a young man we were
looking forward to getting to know
much better. He had a world of oppor
tunity ahead of him, and it is a true
tragedy for his bright future to be cut
short by this senseless act."
Jamiel Sr. said he still gets letters
from university coaches expressing
interest in having Jamiel play for their
teams. He received an email from a
Rutgers representative, who wanted
to check in because the school had not
heard from Jamiel in a while.
"That was a hard email to answer,"
Jamiel Sr. said.
Although gang violence is com
mon in areas south of Los Angeles
High. Jamiel Sr. said his neighborhood
had been relatively safe up until the
shooting.
"You know it's there," he said."But
you don't really get packs of gangs
roaming the streets like you would
think "
Jamiel Sr. said that since his son's
death, a lot of parents have come to
him expressing concern that their chil
dren won't be safe no matter what
they do to protect them.
"We thought we made it,"he said.
"We thought we knew what we were
doing."
