## Potential football recruit killed in shooting 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Football had contacted the
coach of Los Angeles High School earlier
this year to inquire about 17-year-old
Jamiel Shaw, a star running back whose ath
letic abilities had earned him the distinction
of the Southern League's most valuable
player during his junior year.
About a week or two later, Jamiel was
shot dead just a few doors away from his
home.
Jamiel Shaw, Sr. said his son was return
ing home from a shopping mall on March 2
when a Latino man opened fire from a

nearby car.
Jamiel Sr. said he heard the gunshots
crack through the air and ran out to find his
son bleeding on the ground. Jamiel was
transported to the hospital, where he was
later pronounced dead.
"It was the worst feeling," Jamiel Sr. said
of his son's passing. "You're just stuck in
grief mode, and you can't get out of it. You
can't control your thinking. You just go
berserk."
Los Angeles Police Department officers
arrested Pedro Espinoza on March 14 in
connection with the shooting. Prosecutors
said Espinoza is allegedly a member of the
18th Street gang in Los Angeles and had

been released from jail on weapons charges
just one day before the shooting.
Authorities said Shaw was not a gang
member and called the shooting a random,
unprovoked gang attack.
Jamiel Sr. was dedicated to making sure
his son would make all the right decisions.
He said he had made an "18-year-plan" for
his son that would help him stay out of trou
ble and put him on a path to a bright future.
"If you stay out of trouble, mixed with
sports, with good grades, you're going to
make it," Jamiel Sr. said.
