# Shaw to stand by standards
## Coaches cite cooperation, teams win despite high academic admission criteria 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean
of admission. The ball marks Stanford
football's dramatic 24-23 upset win over
the University of Southern California
last fall, which, the Cardinal faithful
hope, may indicate the beginning of a
new era in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play
a crucial role. Stanford is unique among
universities nationwide for its balance
of success in the classroom and on the
playing field. Yet for many, the admis
sion office is responsible for precluding
success in high profile sports such as
football and basketball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the
University this year, said he would not
compromise Stanford's stringent
admission standards in the name of ath
letic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of
values."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be high
er. Coaches complain when they can't
get their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all." he
continued. "If that means somebody
else might, that's the way it is. But we're
not somebody else, we're Stanford. 1
have no apologies for the place this is."
It's not that Shaw doesn't want to
win. He called the Cardinal's soon-to
be streak of 14 straight Director's Cups

"mind-boggling." And. of course, there
is the commemorative football in the
office.
"Do I like to win?" Shaw said.
"Yeah, 1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of
Colorado, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Michigan, Shaw under
stands the needs of winning athletic
departments. Shaw, who came from
Yale in 2005, was preceded by Robin
Mamlet, who came from Swarthmore
in 2000 — a liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania that had a Division 111
athletic program.
This past year has been one of the
most successful in recent years for the
larger men's sports like football, basket
ball and baseball. One reason is a small
sample size, but coaches and athletes
say the admission office has become
more cooperative since Shaw took over
in 2<X)5.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've
understood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery. "He looks real hard to
find a way to help, as compared to ... "
he said, trailing off.
"It's easy to say no." Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about deal
ing with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit
that he has worked to establish stronger
lines of communication with the athlet
ics department.
"In general, the goal is to have good
relationships with all segments of cam
pus." he said. "1 think we've established
good relations with [Athletic Director]
Bob Bowlsby."
Bowlsby, who came to Stanford in
2006 from the University of lowa, said
he hears some complaints from
coaches but he sees athletics and
admissions "on the same team."
"1 won't consider it to be us
against them — we're on the same
page," Bowlsby said, acknowledging
"there are certainly some disappoint
ments along the way."
Shaw admitted the nature of his
work places a bigger burden on
coaches and assistants in recruiting
the right player — one whose skills in
the classroom match athletic prowess.
"It puts more pressure on coach
es," Shaw said. "They have to go out
and find kids that might not be on
everybody's radar screen — taking
the right courses, doing well in the
classroom."
Meanwhile, Montgomery said that
coaches understand the unique bal
ance that Stanford finds between ath
letics and academics.
"Nobody wants somebody to
come in and open the gates —
nobody," Montgomery said. "The
coaches don't. Nobody does.
Everybody understands that we have
[a] harder job in terms of locating kids
that can do that kind of work that is
expected here. That's what makes for
the integrity of this whole thing."
"If it broke down, it would be a
problem," he added. "Nobody wants
that. The key word is fair, and/or rea
sonable."
Bowlsby said it was "pretty well
certain" that Stanford would take
home a record 14th straight
Director's Cup. which measures all
sports equally. But the athletic direc
tor expressed enthusiasm that the
high profile, revenue-producing
sports such as football, basketball and
baseball appeared on the upswing.
"I don't think you can call yourself
the best athletics program in the
country if you can't win consistently
in the sports that the media follows
fand) that fans covet," he said.
While athletics may have enjoyed
another winning season, Shaw said he
measures success largely by gradua
tion rates.
"This is college, this is about pursu
ing a degree," he said. "We don't
admit students of whom we don't

have every expectation will gradu
ate."
According to NCAA data,
between 2002-2005, 93 percent of
Stanford football players graduated,
by far the best showing in the Pac-10
conference — the University of
Washington was next, at 64 percent.
The Cardinal also topped the baseball
rankings, with % percent of players
graduating.
In basketball. Stanford showed
second at 67 percent, to Washington's
70. That was before the departure this
year of the Lopez twins, sophomores
Brook and Robin, for the NBA.
"I don't like that, one can imag
ine," Shaw said of the early depar
tures.
Shaw said he was "dismayed"
when he heard about the academic
troubles of Brook Lopez, who was
ruled academically ineligible fall
quarter.
"I don't know what was going on
in his mind," he said."lt's not OK with
me."
More distressing to the admission
dean are the graduation rates from
competing schools. Other institutions
known for academic prowess, like Cal
and UCLA, have performed dismally
in this respect. Cal graduated 52 per
cent of football players and 33 per
cent of basketball players, UCLA 56
and 40.
"We don't compromise, as others
do," Shaw said. "Other schools have
lost it, in my estimation. It's pretty dis
couraging to see."
