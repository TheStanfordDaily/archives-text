# Shaw to stand by standards
## Coaches cite cooperation, teams win despite high academic admission criteria 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean
of admission. The ball marks Stanford
football's dramatic 24-23 upset win over
the University of Southern California
last fall, which, the Cardinal faithful
hope, may indicate the beginning of a
new era in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play
a crucial role. Stanford is unique among
universities nationwide for its balance
of success in the classroom and on the
playing field. Yet for many, the admis
sion office is responsible for precluding
success in high profile sports such as
football and basketball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the
University this year, said he would not
compromise Stanford's stringent
admission standards in the name of ath
letic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of
values."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be high
er. Coaches complain when they can't
get their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all." he
continued. "If that means somebody
else might, that's the way it is. But we're
not somebody else, we're Stanford. 1
have no apologies for the place this is."
It's not that Shaw doesn't want to
win. He called the Cardinal's soon-to
be streak of 14 straight Director's Cups

"mind-boggling." And. of course, there
is the commemorative football in the
office.
"Do I like to win?" Shaw said.
"Yeah, 1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of
Colorado, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Michigan, Shaw under
stands the needs of winning athletic
departments. Shaw, who came from
Yale in 2005, was preceded by Robin
Mamlet, who came from Swarthmore
in 2000 â€” a liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania that had a Division 111
athletic program.
This past year has been one of the
most successful in recent years for the
larger men's sports like football, basket
ball and baseball. One reason is a small
sample size, but coaches and athletes
say the admission office has become
more cooperative since Shaw took over
in 2<X)5.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've
understood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery. "He looks real hard to
find a way to help, as compared to ... "
he said, trailing off.
"It's easy to say no." Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about deal
ing with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit
that he has worked to establish stronger
lines of communication with the athlet
ics department.
"In general, the goal is to have good
relationships with all segments of cam
pus." he said. "1 think we've established
good relations with [Athletic Director]
Bob Bowlsby."
