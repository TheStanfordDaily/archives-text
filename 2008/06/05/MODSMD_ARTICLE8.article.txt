## Univ. sees drop in alcohol emergencies 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS DESK EDITOR 
Fewer Stanford students are going to the emer
gency room because of alcohol poisoning than in pre
vious years, according to statistics provided by the
Stanford University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) and Vaden Health Center. But many of the
cases reported this year involve not only freshmen but
also upperclassmen and graduate students.
The statistics also indicate that the number of
Stanford students cited by SUDPS for underage drink
ing has increased and that fewer Stanford students are
being cited for driving under the influence on campus.
ALCOHOL POISONING
Thirty-five cases of alcohol poisoning that required
transportation to an emergency room have occurred
on campus this year as of late May, according to Ralph
J. Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse Prevention
Program at Vaden Health Center.
Castro said the number of these alcohol poisoning
incidents has been decreasing dramatically since the
2004-2005 academic year, when 1 l l > cases were report
ed. Ninety-three cases of alcohol poisoning were doc
umented for 2005-2006. and 54 cases were reported for
2006-2007.
"Basically with regard to other schools. Stanford
students tend to be more responsible in regards to the
frequency and quantity of alcohol use across the
board," Castro said.
Castro said his statistics represent a col
lection of information from a variety of
sources on campus, including SUDPS, resi
dence deans and the Freshman Dean's
Office.
The largest number of alcohol poisoning
incidents is traditionally reported in the fall,
Castro said. Twenty of the 35 cases reported
this year occurred during autumn quarter.
"What we now know is that, among cur
rent sophomores and freshmen, about three
out of four students were not regular
drinkers in high school," Castro said. "That's
three-quarters [of incoming students] who
don't really have a lot of experience with
alcohol, and it takes tremendous amounts of
education to understand the physiological
aspects of alcohol on the body and how to
make good decisions."
But Castro said the relative inexperience
of freshman drinkers cannot fully account
for the high volumes of alcohol poisoning
incidents at the beginning of the school year.
Although freshmen made up about half of
the 20 cases reported this fall, the other half
occurred among upperclassmen and gradu
ate students.
"Upperclassmen have problems," Castro
said. "It's definitely reflected in our num
bers."
POLICE CITATIONS
Fewer Stanford students have been cited
for driving under the influence of alcohol on
campus in recent years, according to SUDPS
statistics. And of the nine Stanford students
cited for drunk driving on campus so far this
year. Castro said five of them were graduate
students.
But many non-students driving onto
campus are being cited with greater fre
quency, as are underage drinkers. Although
13 Stanford students were issued minor-in
possession (MIP) citations in 2005-2006,
this number more than doubled in 2006-
2007 with 37 citations. This year, 30 stu
dents so far have been cited for MIP viola
tions.
Stanford Chief of Police Laura Wilson
said her officers have also cited many more
non-Stanford students for underage drink

ing on campus, including 32 this year. Wilson
said these numbers suggest her officers are
seeing a fair number of off-campus students,
including high school students, who obtain
alcohol despite University guidelines that
restrict campus parties to registered stu
dents.
Wilson said that her department is aware
that a considerable amount of underage
drinking occurs on campus, and officers will
cite students who appear to be drinking
underage or clearly drunk in public. But
with as few as four and as many as eight offi
cers on duty on any given night. Wilson said
that police generally focus on responding to
high risk incidents like alcohol poisoning or
allegations of abuse or sexual assault.
"If someone wants to drink, they're going
to drink," Wilson said. "That's why the
University is focused more on a health and
wellness approach."
Wilson said Stanford has a particular cul
ture with regard to drinking that seems bet
ter suited for educational measures, rather
than strict enforcement in ensuring students
are safe when consuming alcohol. Wilson
said that enforcement is only one tool in
dealing with drinking.
"It's about their safety, not about their
punishment," Wilson said. "Are there times
when people go to jail? Yes, there are. But if
you look at the number of people actually
cited ... it tends to be roughly the same if
not more of students being transported [to
emergency rooms] rather than being arrest
ed."
Nevertheless, Wilson said there still
needs to be some oversight.
"We enforce state law," Wilson said. "We
don't enforce University policy."
UNIVERSITY POLICY
The University's approach to alcohol is
largely in line with the Fundamental
Standard. Castro said. It assumes students
are going to make the right choice, and
Stanford develops policies with this in mind.
"We need to give students benefit of the
doubt," Castro said. "That basic understand
ing of how we perceive student behavior is
different from other schools."
Castro said other schools assume stu

dents will make the wrong choice when
drinking, and administrators will enact
heavy-handed measures to deter risky
behavior. Resident Assistants (RAs) at
these schools can be extensions of the
enforcement piece, confiscating alcohol or
reporting any violations to the police, which
Castro said may encourage students to
avoid reporting problems for fear of punish
ment.
Castro said that Stanford instead places a
strong emphasis on education, encouraging
students to look out for one another and
training residence staff to identify and mon
itor dangerous situations like alcohol poi
soning. He said an alcohol training module
was introduced this year to train residence
staff and fellows to better identify risky and

reckless behaviors involving alcohol, and for
the last two years incoming freshman have
been required to complete "AlcoholEdu,"
which seeks to educate students about alco
hol consumption.
"I do get the sense that our students, par
ticularly student staff like RAs and PHEs
[peer health educators], are being more
responsive and taking to heart the message
that if in doubt, call 9-1-1," Wilson said.
"We're seeing a little less fear that some
one's going to get a friend in trouble and a
little more realization that a friend is already
in trouble."
Although cases of alcohol poisoning are
in decline at Stanford. Castro said he is trou
bled by the increasing consumption of hard
liquor among college students, which he said

places them at very high risk of alcohol poi
soning.
"We've been very lucky at Stanford,"
Castro said. "We've never had an alcohol
poisoning death."
But Castro warned that the situation
could change drastically.
"All it's going to take is one serious
alcohol fatality on campus for the
University to really take a look at our
approach," Castro said. "We give so much
responsibility to students to make that
choice, we hope they embrace and respect
that honor so that we can continue to treat
them like adults."
