/ We are all so proud of your time on the farm. \
/ Your distinct voice & character on campus will always he remembered: \
By your concern for others — the Stanford calendar. I
By your equestrian accomplishments for the team —Ist & 3rd place iu
Nationals 06 & 'OS.
By your academic achievements earning you a Phi Beta Kappa Key.
Your distinct voice and character will always be remembered
By those who lives you touched as a daughter, sister, granddaughter
And the friendships yon have made.
Woohoo!
Love,
Mom, Dad, Peter and Tyler
