# Hennessy, senator at odds over endowment
## President opposes Congress efforts to regulate spending

The combination of rapidly growing en
dowments and increasing tuition costs at uni
versities around the country' has drawn re
cent scrutiny from Congress, which has
threatened to remove the tax-exempt status
of endowments if they fall below a minimum
annual spending requirement similar to
those placed on non-profit foundations.
Stanford President John Hennessy told
Ilie Daily he opposes any attempt by Con
gress to introduce legislation that would tell
universities how to spend their endowments.
"I oppose it for two reasons," Hennessy
said. "We have legally binding agreements
with donors as to how we spend the money,
|and] we have a permanent time scale, so no
matter what happens, we still have a universi
ty"
Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) along

with Senator Max Baucus '63, J.D. '67 (D-
Montana) sent letters in February to 136 uni
versities with endowments greater than $500
million, including Stanford, asking for data
about endowment spending, tuition and fi
nancial aid. The Senate Finance Committee,
of which Baucus is chair and Grassley is the
ranking member, also held a hearing on the
topic.
"I just want colleges to be aware of the
fact that the purposes of college are teaching,
educating and research, and that the money
ought to be used for that purpose," Grassley
said Monday in a conference call with The
Daily. "A college endowment should not be a
storehouse of funds."
Stanford's endowment grew 22 percent
last year to $ 17.2 billion, while next year's tu
ition also increased by 3.5 percent to $36,030.
Stanford, along with other universities,
uses a sophisticated "smoothing formula"
that lowers the actual endowment payout
below the target payout in years of excep
tional investment performance and increases
actual payout above the target payout in lean
years in an effort to produce a steady payout
level. While Stanford has set target payout
levels of 5 percent or more in each of the last
10 years, actual payout has fallen below 5 per

cent six times in that period.
Hennessy said the practice is essential to
the University's permanent timescale.
"You have these great endowment years,
but you also have some lousy years," Hen
nessy said, referring to the 19705, "and you
don't want to set a rate based on just great
years."
Hennessy said that the rules that apply to
foundations should not be extended to uni
versities because of their permanent
timescale.
"If the Ford Foundation goes bankrupt,
that's not a disaster," he said."lf Stanford ran
out of money, then that would be a disaster."
Grassley did not agree with Hennessy's
explanation of current endowment spending
practices.
"It seems to me that there is one thing that
endowments have over foundations," Grass
ley said. "They continue to have money com
ing in, while most foundations do not have
money coming in."
Grassley said that the threat of poor in
vestment years in the future is not a valid ex
cuse for limiting endowment spending, espe
cially because of the tremendous growth
among university endowments and the enor
mous wealth that they have accumulated.

Ilie top 20 university endowments add up to
almost $200 billion.
"If you've got a down time, instead of 20
percent growth if you have 5 percent growth,
there could be some expenditure of principal
until you get a chance to build it back up,"
Grassley said.
Stanford's Chief Financial Officer Randy
Livingston explained that although the
smoothing formula seems counterintuitive
— as it results in smaller payments during
good years and larger payments in bad ones
— it is necessary to achieve budget stability.
"If we simply try to keep spending con
stant from one year to the next, then in a year
when the value went way up, those [base] ex
penditures would be a small percentage of
the endowment, and when value goes down,
the expenditures would be a large percent
age of the endowment," Livingston said.
Livingston added that it was important
that base operating expenditures represent a
relatively constant portion of endowment
spending so that faculty salaries and other
key expenses do not fluctuate with the mar
ket.
Another point of conflict between col
leges and Congress is the restrictions placed
on endowments. In its response to the Senate

Finance Committee inquiry, the University
said that over 70 percent of endowment
funds are restricted by donors to particular
uses.
"The endowment is not one big account
with a lot of cash in it; there are thousands of
funds," Hennessy said. "Congress could say,
'Spend on Financial Aid,' but that would re
quire us to violate contractual agreements
[with donors]."
Grassley disputed the notion that spend
ing restrictions tie the hands of University of
ficials.
"1 think that you've got to realize that en
dowments have a lot of flexibility, even
though there is a lot of designated giving,"
Grassley said. "Even though 99 percent
might be [restricted], even if you take 1 per
cent of your endowment that's still a lot of
money, I*ll bet,and don't forget that probably
a lot of that 99 percent was donated for stu
dent aid, as well."
Livingston agreed with Grassley in that
the University does retain some flexibility
with the 30 percent of the endowment that is
not restricted. But he emphasized that when
you redistribute money to particular
causes, you must make sacrifices
elsewhere.
"There is no free lunch here," Liv
ingston said. "Any time we increase
allocation of money to one area, we
have to say what do we take away
from. Although there is widespread
support for the improved Financial
Aid package, we wouldn't do that at
the expense of cutting back faculty,
or other things."
Grassley was optimistic that the
Senate inquiry into endowment
spending will lead universities to
make changes on their own and that
legislation will not be necessary. Sev
eral top universities have already
made significant changes to their fi
nancial aid programs, with Stanford
eliminating tuition for all families
earning less than $100,000 a year.
"In the six years I've been investi
gating non-profits and just recently
this higher education aspect, we

have seen a lot of self-correcting,"
Grassley said, "and so the extent to
which your President (Hennessy]
would not like to have [legislation]
exactly the same as for foundations,
then to the extent which [universi
ties] continue to help students with
their endowments as opposed to
other uses of the endowments, I
think there is less chance that Con
gress would legislate."
Grassley strongly believes that
increasing endowment spending is in
the best interest of universities.
"Colleges and universities who
tap endowment dollars to help more
students access top-notch education
are investing in the American
Dream," Grassley said. "That Amer
ican Dream is going to keep these
colleges and universities going."
But President Hennessy is not
sure that members of Congress fully
understand the complexities of en
dowment management.
"We've got to do a lot of educa
tion for people in Congress about
how endowments work," he said.

explanation of current endowment spending
practices.
"It seems to me that there is one thing that
endowments have over foundations," Grass
ley said. "They continue to have money com
ing in, while most foundations do not have
money coming in."
Grassley said that the threat of poor in
vestment years in the future is not a valid ex
cuse for limiting endowment spending, espe
cially because of the tremendous growth
among university endowments and the enor
mous wealth that they have accumulated.

Ilie top 20 university endowments add up to
almost $200 billion.
"If you've got a down time, instead of 20
percent growth if you have 5 percent growth,
there could be some expenditure of principal
until you get a chance to build it back up,"
Grassley said.
Stanford's Chief Financial Officer Randy
Livingston explained that although the
smoothing formula seems counterintuitive
— as it results in smaller payments during
good years and larger payments in bad ones
— it is necessary to achieve budget stability.
"If we simply try to keep spending con
stant from one year to the next, then in a year
when the value went way up, those [base] ex
penditures would be a small percentage of
the endowment, and when value goes down,
the expenditures would be a large percent
age of the endowment," Livingston said.
Livingston added that it was important
that base operating expenditures represent a
relatively constant portion of endowment
spending so that faculty salaries and other
key expenses do not fluctuate with the mar
ket.
Another point of conflict between col
leges and Congress is the restrictions placed
on endowments. In its response to the Senate

Finance Committee inquiry, the University
said that over 70 percent of endowment
funds are restricted by donors to particular
uses.
"The endowment is not one big account
with a lot of cash in it; there are thousands of
funds," Hennessy said. "Congress could say,
'Spend on Financial Aid,' but that would re
quire us to violate contractual agreements
[with donors]."
Grassley disputed the notion that spend
ing restrictions tie the hands of University of
ficials.
"1 think that you've got to realize that en
dowments have a lot of flexibility, even
though there is a lot of designated giving,"
Grassley said. "Even though 99 percent
might be [restricted], even if you take 1 per
cent of your endowment that's still a lot of
money, I*ll bet,and don't forget that probably
a lot of that 99 percent was donated for stu
dent aid, as well."
Livingston agreed with Grassley in that
the University does retain some flexibility
with the 30 percent of the endowment that is
not restricted. But he emphasized that when
you redistribute money to particular
causes, you must make sacrifices
elsewhere.
"There is no free lunch here," Liv
ingston said. "Any time we increase
allocation of money to one area, we
have to say what do we take away
from. Although there is widespread
support for the improved Financial
Aid package, we wouldn't do that at
the expense of cutting back faculty,
or other things."
Grassley was optimistic that the
Senate inquiry into endowment
spending will lead universities to
make changes on their own and that
legislation will not be necessary. Sev
eral top universities have already
made significant changes to their fi
nancial aid programs, with Stanford
eliminating tuition for all families
earning less than $100,000 a year.
"In the six years I've been investi
gating non-profits and just recently
this higher education aspect, we

have seen a lot of self-correcting,"
Grassley said, "and so the extent to
which your President (Hennessy]
would not like to have [legislation]
exactly the same as for foundations,
then to the extent which [universi
ties] continue to help students with
their endowments as opposed to
other uses of the endowments, I
think there is less chance that Con
gress would legislate."
Grassley strongly believes that
increasing endowment spending is in
the best interest of universities.
"Colleges and universities who
tap endowment dollars to help more
students access top-notch education
are investing in the American
Dream," Grassley said. "That Amer
ican Dream is going to keep these
colleges and universities going."
But President Hennessy is not
sure that members of Congress fully
understand the complexities of en
dowment management.
"We've got to do a lot of educa
tion for people in Congress about
how endowments work," he said.

The combination of rapidly growing en
dowments and increasing tuition costs at uni
versities around the country' has drawn re
cent scrutiny from Congress, which has
threatened to remove the tax-exempt status
of endowments if they fall below a minimum
annual spending requirement similar to
those placed on non-profit foundations.
Stanford President John Hennessy told
Ilie Daily he opposes any attempt by Con
gress to introduce legislation that would tell
universities how to spend their endowments.
"I oppose it for two reasons," Hennessy
said. "We have legally binding agreements
with donors as to how we spend the money,
|and] we have a permanent time scale, so no
matter what happens, we still have a universi
ty"
Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) along

with Senator Max Baucus '63, J.D. '67 (D-
Montana) sent letters in February to 136 uni
versities with endowments greater than $500
million, including Stanford, asking for data
about endowment spending, tuition and fi
nancial aid. The Senate Finance Committee,
of which Baucus is chair and Grassley is the
ranking member, also held a hearing on the
topic.
"I just want colleges to be aware of the
fact that the purposes of college are teaching,
educating and research, and that the money
ought to be used for that purpose," Grassley
said Monday in a conference call with The
Daily. "A college endowment should not be a
storehouse of funds."
Stanford's endowment grew 22 percent
last year to $ 17.2 billion, while next year's tu
ition also increased by 3.5 percent to $36,030.
Stanford, along with other universities,
uses a sophisticated "smoothing formula"
that lowers the actual endowment payout
below the target payout in years of excep
tional investment performance and increases
actual payout above the target payout in lean
years in an effort to produce a steady payout
level. While Stanford has set target payout
levels of 5 percent or more in each of the last
10 years, actual payout has fallen below 5 per

cent six times in that period.
Hennessy said the practice is essential to
the University's permanent timescale.
"You have these great endowment years,
but you also have some lousy years," Hen
nessy said, referring to the 19705, "and you
don't want to set a rate based on just great
years."
Hennessy said that the rules that apply to
foundations should not be extended to uni
versities because of their permanent
timescale.
"If the Ford Foundation goes bankrupt,
that's not a disaster," he said."lf Stanford ran
out of money, then that would be a disaster."
Grassley did not agree with Hennessy's
explanation of current endowment spending
practices.

endowments have over foundations," Grass
ley said. "They continue to have money com
