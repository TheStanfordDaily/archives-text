## Recording industry serves 'prelitgation' notices to Stanford

Fifteen students have received pre-litigation notices from
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) de
manding that they pay settlement fees for illegal file sharing
through the Internet.
According to Lauren Schoenthaler, senior University
counsel, the University received the notices from the RIAA
on Jan. 9 and forwarded them to the respective students. Each
notice demanded that the students pay the settlements by Jan.
28; otherwise the RIAA would bring lawsuits against the 15
individuals.
While the pre-litigation notices stipulate that each student
pay upwards of several thousand dollars, the amount each stu
dent could owe if brought to court may be substantially
greater.
"In speaking with affected students and their parents, the
litigation process can be devastating financially and emotion
ally," Schoenthaler wrote in an email to The Daily.
The RIAA located the specific students through their In
ternet Protocol (IP) addresses,but it has not yet attained the
names and information of the students from whom it is re
questing settlement. Because the University is able to identi
fy individual students on campus through their IP addresses,
the RIAA relied on the University to relay the notices to the
individuals.The RIAA will subpoena the University for the
names and information of all those who fail to pay the settle
ment fee by the Jan. 28 deadline.
Greg Goldgof '08, one of the students being threatened
with a lawsuit by the RIAA, received an email forwarded via
the University from the law offices of Holme, Robert and
()wen LLP on behalf of the RIAA. It stated that he had used
the file sharing client Lime Wire to illegally download and
share files, and that he had until Jan. 28 to pay a $3,000 settle
ment, or else a suit would be filed. Goldgof claimed that, prior
to receiving the notice, he "had not received even a single
warning from Stanford."
After receiving the pre-litigation notice email. Goldgof
spoke with members of the Office of the General Counsel
(OGC) and the Legal Counseling Office (LCO) of the ASSU.
Goldgof claimed that the general response he received from
the LCO and Schoenthaler was that he should simply pay the
settlement. Unable to raise the $3,000 on his own. he contact
ed Prof. Lawrence Lessig of the Stanford Law School, who re
ferred him to the Law School's Fair Use Project. He was ad
vised to consider fund-raising as a means of raising the settle
ment amount.
"I realized that probably the best bet would
be to ask my friends to help me out," Goldgof
said.
In order to raise the needed funds to pay off
the settlement, Goldgof created an event page
on facebook.com entitled "Save Greg from the
RIAA!!!" in hopes that his friends and sympa
thizers would donate money to help him. As of
publication time, he had raised approximately
$1,200 through donations contributed via an
eßay link on the page. While he hopes to be able
to raise the full amount in time to meet the set
tlement deadline, he said he was in no way
pleased with any aspect of the situation.
"There's really no other option left open to
me," he said. "1 have to pay $3,(XK) — it's extor
tion."
Since February 2007. the RIAA has handled
the payment of anonymous settlement claims
such as these through an online settlement Web
site — www.p2plawsuits.com — through which
the specific amount is paid by credit card with
no personal interaction with lawyers.
"You basically go to some Web site and enter
your credit card number like you're buying a
book online," Goldgof said.
Since the first emergence of widespread on
line file sharing, the RIAA has filed numerous
lawsuits against both organizations and individ
uals accused of illegally sharing music, videos
and other media online. Those faced with the
charges have included children as young as 12,
as well as many college students from schools
across the country.
For Stanford, this is not the first time that
students here have been the target of suits by
the RIAA — Schoenthaler said that in Octo
ber 2(X)7, seven students were given notices sim
ilar to those Goldgof and others received.
"Each of those seven lawsuits |were| settled
by the students for thousands of dollars each
and therefore the subpoenas were withdrawn
before Stanford turned over any records."
Schoenthaler said. "Unlawful file sharing is just
not worth the risk."
In September 2007. the University of Ore
gon refused to comply with subpoenas de
manding that the University hand over the
identities of 17 students accused by the RIAA
of illegal file sharing. Oregon Attorney Gener
al Hardy Myers backed the University on
grounds that included student privacy.

In the past. Stanford policy has been consis
tently and staunchly against file sharing on cam
pus. In May 2007, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman announced that students
caught violating the 1998 Digital Millennium
Copyright Act would have to pay a fine before
their Internet connection was reinstated.
Schoenthaler. furthermore, likened illegal
file sharing to violating the Fundamental Stan
dard.
"Complaints against students for violation
of the Fundamental Standard have and will be
filed against students who illegally download or
upload copyrighted material," she said.
Schoenthaler claimed that the defining issue
ol the University of Oregon case was that the
school lacked the capability to identify each of
the alleged copyright infringers by their IP ad
dresses.
"By contrast, Stanford is able to concretely
link up individual users based on IP addresses,"
she said, "and therefore Stanford would not be
able to bring a sweeping motion to quash [the
RIAA's request] on the grounds cited by Ore
gon."
The 15 Stanford students facing potential
lawsuits from the RIAA have less than a week
as of publication date in which to pay the pre
litigation settlements. If they are unable to do
so by the deadline, subpoenas and lawsuits are
sure to follow. In previous cases, courts that
have found in favor of the RIAA have de
manded defendants to pay upwards of
$ 1 (K).(KX), and.sometimes the legal fees of the
RIAA as well.
"It seems that the RIAA has so much push
in Congress," said Paul Keser, associate officer
in the campus Information Security Office."lt's
been building for so long, and hopefully the
ones who are getting these notices are finally
starting to complain."
In Goldgofs case, if worse comes to worst
and he is forced by the courts to pay a massive
sum to the RlAA.it would almost certainly end
or at least delay his plans of going to graduate
school.
"Under these circumstances, normally I
would file for bankruptcy,"he said."! would be
indentured to the RIAA for a long time."
