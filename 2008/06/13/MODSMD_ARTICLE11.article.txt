Fifteen students have received pre-litigation notices from
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) de
manding that they pay settlement fees for illegal file sharing
through the Internet.
According to Lauren Schoenthaler, senior University
counsel, the University received the notices from the RIAA
on Jan. 9 and forwarded them to the respective students. Each
notice demanded that the students pay the settlements by Jan.
28; otherwise the RIAA would bring lawsuits against the 15
individuals.
While the pre-litigation notices stipulate that each student
pay upwards of several thousand dollars, the amount each stu
dent could owe if brought to court may be substantially
greater.
"In speaking with affected students and their parents, the
litigation process can be devastating financially and emotion
ally," Schoenthaler wrote in an email to The Daily.
The RIAA located the specific students through their In
ternet Protocol (IP) addresses,but it has not yet attained the
names and information of the students from whom it is re
questing settlement. Because the University is able to identi
fy individual students on campus through their IP addresses,
the RIAA relied on the University to relay the notices to the
individuals.The RIAA will subpoena the University for the
names and information of all those who fail to pay the settle
ment fee by the Jan. 28 deadline.
Greg Goldgof '08, one of the students being threatened
with a lawsuit by the RIAA, received an email forwarded via
the University from the law offices of Holme, Robert and
()wen LLP on behalf of the RIAA. It stated that he had used
the file sharing client Lime Wire to illegally download and
share files, and that he had until Jan. 28 to pay a $3,000 settle
ment, or else a suit would be filed. Goldgof claimed that, prior
to receiving the notice, he "had not received even a single
warning from Stanford."
After receiving the pre-litigation notice email. Goldgof
spoke with members of the Office of the General Counsel
(OGC) and the Legal Counseling Office (LCO) of the ASSU.
Goldgof claimed that the general response he received from
the LCO and Schoenthaler was that he should simply pay the
settlement. Unable to raise the $3,000 on his own. he contact
ed Prof. Lawrence Lessig of the Stanford Law School, who re
ferred him to the Law School's Fair Use Project. He was ad
vised to consider fund-raising as a means of raising the settle
ment amount.
