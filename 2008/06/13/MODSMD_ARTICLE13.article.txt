# Open research policy complicates defense funding
## Defense research still controversial

Since 1969, Department of De
fense sponsored research at Stanford
has been required to comply with a
University-wide "no secrecy" policy
banning research on classified proj
ects. While this regulation has not hin
dered Stanford researchers from re
ceiving defense funding, it has compli
cated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War,
as students and faculty alike began to
question Stanford's involvement with
the defense establishment, the Faculty-
Senate approved policies aimed at lim
iting the presence of the military on
campus.The Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) was expelled from
campus, and University researchers
were forbidden to accept federal fund
ing for classified projects following the
implementation of the Openness in
Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classi
fied research, funding from the De
partment of Defense continues to
pour into campus, largely for research
in non-military areas such as medicine,
earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research,
in the 2006-2007 academic year, the
University received $59,160,146 in re
search funding from the Department
of Defense, approximately 6.4 percent
of the University's total federal fund
ing for sponsored research. In 1991,
following the end of the Cold War, re
search funding from the Department
of Defense constituted roughly $40
million or 16 percent of the Universi
ty's $240 million total federal research
funding.
The Army High-Performance
Computing Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy
played a central role in the Committee
on Research's recent evaluation of the
University's contract with the Army
for a $105 million computing research
program. The Army High-Perfor
mance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in
December 2007, is being funded by the

Department of Defense in hopes that
researchers will develop advanced
simulation software that may lead to
advances in battlefield communica
tion, protection and sensor capabili
ties.
"[AHPCRC] research may subse
quently lead to classified research at
Army research labs, but this is not part
of the research project," said Civil En
gineering Prof. Steve Monismith, chair
of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an in
vestigation into this matter after 60
faculty members petitioned for the
committee to examine whether the
AHPCRC conflicted with the Univer
sity's no secrecy policy. At the commit
tee's annual public meeting on May 22,
Monismith presented the committee's
findings on its investigation. Accord
ing to Monismith, the committee
found that the AHPCRC was in full
compliance with University standards.
He added that the committee did not
investigate the ethical concerns of fac
ulty members, but looked only for pol
icy violations.
"[The committee] only looked at
the question of compliance," Moni
smith said. "We didn't look at the issue
of whether military research is appro
priate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling
in the program's favor, the AHPCRC
will remain on campus and serve as the
headquarters of a nationwide consor
tium of researchers at Stanford, Mor
gan State University in Maryland,
New Mexico State University, the Uni
versity of Texas at El Paso and the
NASA Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AH
PCRC met the requirements of the
University's open research policies,
Monismith said, the committee exam
ined four particular areas of concern
â€” whether classified research would
take place at the AHPCRC, if the cen
ter would contain classified materials,
if special security clearance would be
needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative
Agreement Manager [CAM] could in
terfere with the academic freedom of
researchers. After investigating the
