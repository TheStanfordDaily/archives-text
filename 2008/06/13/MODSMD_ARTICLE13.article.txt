# Open research policy complicates defense funding
## Defense research still controversial 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
Originally published on May 29,2(H)H
Since 1969, Department of De
fense sponsored research at Stanford
has been required to comply with a
University-wide "no secrecy" policy
banning research on classified proj
ects. While this regulation has not hin
dered Stanford researchers from re
ceiving defense funding, it has compli
cated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War,
as students and faculty alike began to
question Stanford's involvement with
the defense establishment, the Faculty-
Senate approved policies aimed at lim
iting the presence of the military on
campus.The Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) was expelled from
campus, and University researchers
were forbidden to accept federal fund
ing for classified projects following the
implementation of the Openness in
Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classi
fied research, funding from the De
partment of Defense continues to
pour into campus, largely for research
in non-military areas such as medicine,
earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research,
in the 2006-2007 academic year, the
University received $59,160,146 in re
search funding from the Department
of Defense, approximately 6.4 percent
of the University's total federal fund
ing for sponsored research. In 1991,
following the end of the Cold War, re
search funding from the Department
of Defense constituted roughly $40
million or 16 percent of the Universi
ty's $240 million total federal research
funding.
The Army High-Performance
Computing Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy
played a central role in the Committee
on Research's recent evaluation of the
University's contract with the Army
for a $105 million computing research
program. The Army High-Perfor
mance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in
December 2007, is being funded by the

Department of Defense in hopes that
researchers will develop advanced
simulation software that may lead to
advances in battlefield communica
tion, protection and sensor capabili
ties.
"[AHPCRC] research may subse
quently lead to classified research at
Army research labs, but this is not part
of the research project," said Civil En
gineering Prof. Steve Monismith, chair
of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an in
vestigation into this matter after 60
faculty members petitioned for the
committee to examine whether the
AHPCRC conflicted with the Univer
sity's no secrecy policy. At the commit
tee's annual public meeting on May 22,
Monismith presented the committee's
findings on its investigation. Accord
ing to Monismith, the committee
found that the AHPCRC was in full
compliance with University standards.
He added that the committee did not
investigate the ethical concerns of fac
ulty members, but looked only for pol
icy violations.
"[The committee] only looked at
the question of compliance," Moni
smith said. "We didn't look at the issue
of whether military research is appro
priate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling
in the program's favor, the AHPCRC
will remain on campus and serve as the
headquarters of a nationwide consor
tium of researchers at Stanford, Mor
gan State University in Maryland,
New Mexico State University, the Uni
versity of Texas at El Paso and the
NASA Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AH
PCRC met the requirements of the
University's open research policies,
Monismith said, the committee exam
ined four particular areas of concern
— whether classified research would
take place at the AHPCRC, if the cen
ter would contain classified materials,
if special security clearance would be
needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative
Agreement Manager [CAM] could in
terfere with the academic freedom of
researchers. After investigating the
Army's program proposal, the com
mittee ruled that classified research
and materials would have no place in
the AHPCRC. Furthermore, re
searchers would he allowed to pursue
their own research agendas without
direct interference from the CAM.
"The legitimate question is does
that interfere with academic freedom,
the basic right of investigators to pick
their own research," Monismith said.
But even if the AHPCRC is in com
pliance with University regulations,
other faculty members worried that
the program will serve as a route
through which Stanford research
could end up in Army research sta
tions.
At the public presentation of the
committee's findings. Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bernard Roth voiced
his concerns that open research con
ducted in the AHPCRC could eventu
ally lead to classified Army projects
and operations. Roth expressed skep
ticism over the committee's findings
and questioned whether the program
is really in compliance with openness
standards.
"We are told that all of these trou
bling issues have been resolved to
bring the agreement into conformity
with Stanford's rules," Roth wrote in
an email to The Daily. "Neither the
principle investigator nor the Univer
sity will make the agreement or the
proposal public."
Monismith pointed out that there
are still issues surrounding the pro
gram which have yet to be resolved. In
particular, Monismith worried about
the Army's use of the term "sensitive"
to describe some research in place of
"classified." He claimed that the com
mittee is currently working to con
vince the Department of Defense that
"there is no such thing as sensitive re
search — it's either classified or not."
And while all Stanford researchers
will have equal access to technologies,
special security checks will need to be
made for researchers of foreign citi
zenship status hoping to gain access to
NASA computers, with Iranian and
Chinese citizens particularly at risk of
being blocked. In this situation,
blocked researchers will be given ac
cess to what Monismith referred to as
"separate but equal" computing facili
ties within the program.
In his presentation, Monismith ac
knowledged that Stanford and the
Army had to rework plans for the pro
gram before the AHPCRC could
meet the disclosure requirements of
the Openness in Research Policy.
"The Stanford consortium pushed
this in a way that the Army did not
want to go," Monismith said. " Hie
original plans for the center would not
have been acceptable at Stanford."
The Ethics of Defense Research
While Monismith presented the
Committee on Research's positive
findings on the AHPCRC, he also ex
pressed disappointment that "in the
Faculty Senate, there wasn't more dis
cussing about the larger issues" of De
partment of Defense research on the

Stanford campus.
According to Dean of Research
Ann Arvin, accepting federal funding
for research from the Department of
Defense does not entail thinking
about the research differently than if
the funding was from any other organ
ization.
"Considerations about openness in
research, faculty direction of research
and student participation are part of
the evaluation of all sponsored re
search agreements, not specifically de
fense department sources," Arvin
wrote in an email to The Daily.
But Roth's experiences and obser
vations through the course of his ca
reer have led him to regard defense re
search as generally more problematic
and ethically disconcerting than other
forms of research, so much so that he
avoids research funding from defense
sources as a matter of principle.
"My impression is that most of it
works in a manner fairly similar to
other funding sources." Roth said, "ex
cept that it skews the research direc
tion into certain areas and influences
career choices into certain areas."
Roth believes defense research
should be examined by the Faculty
Senate — much in the way sponsored
research from the tobacco industry
was examined in 2007.
"I think there are moral and ethical
issues involved in military research,"
he said. "Hie Faculty Senate and Uni
versity community should undertake a
discussion of these questions."
Throughout the course of Moni
sniith's career, the amount of research
funds he has received from the Office
of Naval Research has varied,but at its
highest levels it comprised 40 percent
of his total funding for research. The
Office of Naval Research currently is
considering a proposal of his which, if
accepted, would provide him with
funding to conduct oceanographic re
search in the Florida Straight. This
project, like others for which he has re
ceived defense funding, has no explicit
military implications, but may help de
fense researchers with their own proj
ects in the future.
"[With] the appropriation for basic
research, it's kind of hard to see exact
ly how it's going to figure in defense re
search," Monismith said."l don't real
ly know what they're going to do with
it."
Monismith said that this kind of
"dual use" research — whose findings
could potentially lead to advances in
both academic and defense projects
— characterizes much of the research
being funded by the Department of
Defense at Stanford and other univer
sities.
While they may disagree on certain
areas of defense research, Monismith.
Arvin and Roth all agreed on one
thing — that Stanford's Openness in
Research Policy has been beneficial to
the academic freedom of the Universi
ty as a whole.
"The University is part of a world
wide system of scholarship that thrives
on people building on previous work
and contributing to subsequent schol
arship," Roth said. "Secrecy breaks
this chain, and is dysfunctional and
counterproductive."

"[The committee] only looked at
the question of compliance," Moni
smith said. "We didn't look at the issue
of whether military research is appro
priate for Stanford."
With the committee's results ruling
in the program's favor, the AHPCRC
will remain on campus and serve as the
headquarters of a nationwide consor
tium of researchers at Stanford, Mor
gan State University in Maryland,
New Mexico State University, the Uni
versity of Texas at El Paso and the
NASA Ames Research Center.
In considering whether the AH
PCRC met the requirements of the
University's open research policies,
Monismith said, the committee exam
ined four particular areas of concern
— whether classified research would
take place at the AHPCRC, if the cen
ter would contain classified materials,
if special security clearance would be
needed to gain entry and whether the
Army's appointed Cooperative
Agreement Manager [CAM] could in
terfere with the academic freedom of
researchers. After investigating the
Army's program proposal, the com
mittee ruled that classified research
and materials would have no place in
the AHPCRC. Furthermore, re
searchers would he allowed to pursue
their own research agendas without
direct interference from the CAM.
"The legitimate question is does
that interfere with academic freedom,
the basic right of investigators to pick
their own research," Monismith said.
But even if the AHPCRC is in com
pliance with University regulations,
other faculty members worried that
the program will serve as a route
through which Stanford research
could end up in Army research sta
tions.
At the public presentation of the
committee's findings. Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bernard Roth voiced
his concerns that open research con
ducted in the AHPCRC could eventu
ally lead to classified Army projects
and operations. Roth expressed skep
ticism over the committee's findings
and questioned whether the program
is really in compliance with openness
standards.
"We are told that all of these trou
bling issues have been resolved to
bring the agreement into conformity
with Stanford's rules," Roth wrote in
an email to The Daily. "Neither the
principle investigator nor the Univer
sity will make the agreement or the
proposal public."
Monismith pointed out that there
are still issues surrounding the pro
gram which have yet to be resolved. In
particular, Monismith worried about
the Army's use of the term "sensitive"
to describe some research in place of
"classified." He claimed that the com
mittee is currently working to con
vince the Department of Defense that
"there is no such thing as sensitive re
search — it's either classified or not."
And while all Stanford researchers
will have equal access to technologies,
special security checks will need to be
made for researchers of foreign citi
zenship status hoping to gain access to
NASA computers, with Iranian and
Chinese citizens particularly at risk of
being blocked. In this situation,
blocked researchers will be given ac
cess to what Monismith referred to as
"separate but equal" computing facili
ties within the program.
In his presentation, Monismith ac
knowledged that Stanford and the
Army had to rework plans for the pro
gram before the AHPCRC could
meet the disclosure requirements of
the Openness in Research Policy.
"The Stanford consortium pushed
this in a way that the Army did not
want to go," Monismith said. " Hie
original plans for the center would not
have been acceptable at Stanford."
The Ethics of Defense Research
While Monismith presented the
Committee on Research's positive
findings on the AHPCRC, he also ex
pressed disappointment that "in the
Faculty Senate, there wasn't more dis
cussing about the larger issues" of De
partment of Defense research on the

Stanford campus.
According to Dean of Research
Ann Arvin, accepting federal funding
for research from the Department of
Defense does not entail thinking
about the research differently than if
the funding was from any other organ
ization.
"Considerations about openness in
research, faculty direction of research
and student participation are part of
the evaluation of all sponsored re
search agreements, not specifically de
fense department sources," Arvin
wrote in an email to The Daily.
But Roth's experiences and obser
vations through the course of his ca
reer have led him to regard defense re
search as generally more problematic
and ethically disconcerting than other
forms of research, so much so that he
avoids research funding from defense
sources as a matter of principle.
"My impression is that most of it
works in a manner fairly similar to
other funding sources." Roth said, "ex
cept that it skews the research direc
tion into certain areas and influences
career choices into certain areas."
Roth believes defense research
should be examined by the Faculty
Senate — much in the way sponsored
research from the tobacco industry
was examined in 2007.
"I think there are moral and ethical
issues involved in military research,"
he said. "Hie Faculty Senate and Uni
versity community should undertake a
discussion of these questions."
Throughout the course of Moni
sniith's career, the amount of research
funds he has received from the Office
of Naval Research has varied,but at its
highest levels it comprised 40 percent
of his total funding for research. The
Office of Naval Research currently is
considering a proposal of his which, if
accepted, would provide him with
funding to conduct oceanographic re
search in the Florida Straight. This
project, like others for which he has re
ceived defense funding, has no explicit
military implications, but may help de
fense researchers with their own proj
ects in the future.
"[With] the appropriation for basic
research, it's kind of hard to see exact
ly how it's going to figure in defense re
search," Monismith said."l don't real
ly know what they're going to do with
it."
Monismith said that this kind of
"dual use" research — whose findings
could potentially lead to advances in
both academic and defense projects
— characterizes much of the research
being funded by the Department of
Defense at Stanford and other univer
sities.
While they may disagree on certain
areas of defense research, Monismith.
Arvin and Roth all agreed on one
thing — that Stanford's Openness in
Research Policy has been beneficial to
the academic freedom of the Universi
ty as a whole.
"The University is part of a world
wide system of scholarship that thrives
on people building on previous work
and contributing to subsequent schol
arship," Roth said. "Secrecy breaks
this chain, and is dysfunctional and
counterproductive."

Since 1969, Department of De
fense sponsored research at Stanford
has been required to comply with a
University-wide "no secrecy" policy
banning research on classified proj
ects. While this regulation has not hin
dered Stanford researchers from re
ceiving defense funding, it has compli
cated the controversy surrounding
such research.
At the height of the Vietnam War,
as students and faculty alike began to
question Stanford's involvement with
the defense establishment, the Faculty-
Senate approved policies aimed at lim
iting the presence of the military on
campus.The Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) was expelled from
campus, and University researchers
were forbidden to accept federal fund
ing for classified projects following the
implementation of the Openness in
Research Policy.
Despite Stanford's ban on classi
fied research, funding from the De
partment of Defense continues to
pour into campus, largely for research
in non-military areas such as medicine,
earth science and industrial materials.
According to the Office of Research,
in the 2006-2007 academic year, the
University received $59,160,146 in re
search funding from the Department
of Defense, approximately 6.4 percent
of the University's total federal fund
ing for sponsored research. In 1991,
following the end of the Cold War, re
search funding from the Department
of Defense constituted roughly $40
million or 16 percent of the Universi
ty's $240 million total federal research
funding.
The Army High-Performance
Computing Research Center
The Openness in Research Policy
played a central role in the Committee
on Research's recent evaluation of the
University's contract with the Army
for a $105 million computing research
program. The Army High-Perfor
mance Computing Research Center
(AHPCRC), which was instituted in
December 2007, is being funded by the

Department of Defense in hopes that
researchers will develop advanced
simulation software that may lead to
advances in battlefield communica
tion, protection and sensor capabili
ties.
"[AHPCRC] research may subse
quently lead to classified research at
Army research labs, but this is not part
of the research project," said Civil En
gineering Prof. Steve Monismith, chair
of the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Research.
The committee undertook an in
vestigation into this matter after 60
faculty members petitioned for the
committee to examine whether the
AHPCRC conflicted with the Univer
sity's no secrecy policy. At the commit
tee's annual public meeting on May 22,
Monismith presented the committee's
findings on its investigation. Accord
ing to Monismith, the committee
found that the AHPCRC was in full
compliance with University standards.
He added that the committee did not
investigate the ethical concerns of fac
ulty members, but looked only for pol
icy violations.
"[The committee] only looked at
