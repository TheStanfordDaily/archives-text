About 50 students and communi
ty members marched into Old Union
Monday afternoon, April 21, to
protest what they called "explicit po
litical censorship" on the part of the
University.The rally, inside the build
ing for roughly 15 minutes, was
sparked by the removal of a photo
exhibit sponsored by Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI).
Old Union administrators took
down the photos on April 9 after re
ceiving multiple complaints regard
ing the exhibit.
The 10 photographs, taken by
local photographer Lisa Nessan, of
fered various portrayals of Palestin
ian life in the West Bank.The photo
graphs appeared with captions,
which, according to members of
SCAI, were based on information
from human rights organizations
such as Amnesty International and
the United Nations.
University administrators, how
ever, stressed that the captions had
not been part of the exhibit initially
approved by Jeanette Smith-Laws,
director of unions. The original title
of the exhibit, "Hope Under Siege,"
had been also changed to "Life
Under Israeli Apartheid," according
to Associate Vice Provost Chris Grif
fith. The changes, combined with the
complaints, led to the exhibit's re
moval two days after it had ap
peared.
"People felt it was inflammatory,"
Griffith told The Daily, adding that
"multiple concerns" had been raised
by a "broad scope of folks."
SCAI members, however, con
tend that they were told initially that
general complaints and the title had
been the cause for the removal. After
offering to change the title, SCAI co
president Fadi Quran '10 said the or
ganization was then informed about
complaints regarding the captions.
"We provided all the information
that the administrators initially
asked for, but they did not request
any captions," he said. "We assumed
that the administration would expect
photo exhibits to include captions,
just as the exhibit that preceded ours
did."
"The exhibit could be reinstated if
the administration simply followed
through on their promises to show us
the complaints and allow us to meet
with those who filed them," he con
tinued. "Moreover, we believe this is
an attempt to deflect attention from
the true issue at hand: political cen
sorship."
SCAI member Amanda Gelen

der '09, who led Monday's rally, said
that Smith-Laws had promised last
week to provide the complaints to
SCAI so that concerns could be ad
dressed.
"So far she has failed to provide
them," Gelender said. "We don't
even know the nature of the com
plaints. It's all so vague; we really
want to see the complaints."
While the students criticized the
University as being uncooperative,
administrators said efforts had been
made to reach a compromise. Ac
cording to a statement by Greg
Boardman, vice provost for student
affairs, the University offered SCAI
the opportunity to relocate the exhi
bition "to another prominent loca
tion on campus or to resume the
show at Old Union in keeping with
their original proposal."
"They decided against pursuing
either option." Boardman said.
SCAI members met with Smith-
Laws last week to discuss a potential
compromise. Gelender said the ad
ministration's proposal to put the ex
hibit back up in its original state,
without titles or captions, was "unac
ceptable."
"It doesn't make sense to have a
photo display without captions," she
said.
The students were then told they
could go to White Plaza, according to
Gelender.
"[Old Union] was one of the only
places I thought we had free speech,"
Gelender said. "We can't afford this
additional suppression."
When it reopened in the fall
amidst great fanfare, administrators
expressed hopes that Old Union
could be a center for student expres
sion. But that vision, administrators
now say. was never clearly defined.
"What is it that students want this
building to be was not clearly articu
lated," Griffith told The Daily Mon
day. "When you don't define that,
people who use the building define it
themselves."
"We did the best we could," she
added. "We need to get some dia
logue going with students."
That dialogue, according to
Boardman, could be in the works
shortly.
"We have yet to fully articulate
the programmatic vision for Old
Union that will help establish poli
cies and procedures to guide us on
the use of communal space including
as a venue for artistic and/or political
expression," Boardman said. "We
will work with the incoming ASSU
leadership to seek student input on
this issue and are in the process of
creating an advisory group com
posed of students and staff to devel
op these policies and to help to assess
future uses of this space."
"We look forward to Old Union
serving as a center where dialogue is
encouraged while remaining a com
fortable gathering place for all," he
added.
