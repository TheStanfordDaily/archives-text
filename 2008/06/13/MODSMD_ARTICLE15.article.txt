A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean of
admission.The ball marks Stanford foot
ball's dramatic 24-23 upset win over the
University of Southern California last
fall, which, the Cardinal faithful hope,
may indicate the beginning of a new era
in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play a
crucial role. Stanford is unique among uni
versities nationwide for its balance of suc
cess in the classroom and on the playing
field. Yet for many the admission office is
responsible for precluding success in high
profile sports such as football and basket
ball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the Universi
ty this year, said he would not compro
mise Stanford's stringent admission stan
dards in the name of athletic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of val
ues."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be higher.
Coaches complain when they can't get
their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all," he
continued. "If that means somebody else
might, that's the way it is. But we're not
somebody else, we're Stanford. I have no
apologies for the place this is."

It's not that Shaw doesn't want to win.
He ealled the Cardinal's soon-to-be
streak of 14 straight Director's Cups
"mind-boggling." And. of course, there is
the commemorative football in the office.
"Do 1 like to win?" Shaw said. "Yeah.
1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of Col
orado, UC-Berkeley and the University
of Michigan. Shaw understands the needs
of winning athletic departments. Shaw,
who came from Vale in 2005, was preced
ed by Robin Mamlet. who came from
Swarthmore in 2000 — a liberal arts col
lege in Pennsylvania that had a Division
111 athletic program.
This past year has been one of the most
successful in recent years for the larger
men's sports like football, basketball and
baseball. One reason is a small sample
size, but coaches and athletes say the ad
mission office has become more coopera
tive since Shaw took over in 2005.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've un
derstood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He looks real hard to find a way
to help, as compared to ..." he said, trail
ing off.
"It's easy to say no," Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about dealing
with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit that
he has worked to establish stronger lines
of communication with the athletics de
partment.
"In general, the goal is to have good re
lationships with all segments of campus,"
he said."l think we've established good re
lations with [Athletic Director] Bob
Bowlsby."
Bowlsby, who came to Stanford in 2006
from the University of lowa, said he hears
some complaints from coaches but he sees
athletics and admissions "on the same
team."
"I won't consider it to be us against

them — we're on the same page," Bowls
by said, acknowledging "there are certain
ly some disappointments along the way."
Shaw admitted the nature of his work
places a bigger burden on coaches and as
sistants in recruiting the right player —
one whose skills in the classroom match
athletic prowess.
"It puts more pressure on coaches,"
Shaw said. "They have to go out and find
kids that might not be on everybody's
radar screen — taking the right courses,
doing well in the classroom."
Meanwhile, Montgomery said that
coaches understand the unique balance
that Stanford finds between athletics and
academics.
"Nobody wants somebody to come in
and open the gates — nobody." Mont
gomery said. "The coaches don't. Nobody
does. Everybody understands that we
have [a] harder job in terms of locating
kids that can do that kind of work that is
expected here. That's what makes for the
integrity of this whole thing."
"If it broke down, it would be a prob
lem," he added. "Nobody wants that. The
key word is fair, and/or reasonable."
Bowlsby said it was "pretty well cer
tain" that Stanford would take home a
record 14th straight Director's Cup. which
measures all sports equally. But the athlet
ic director expressed enthusiasm that the
high profile, revenue-producing sports
such as football, basketball and baseball
appeared on the upswing.
"1 don't think you can call yourself the
best athletics program in the country if
you can't win consistently in the sports
that the media follows [and] that fans
covet," he said.
While athletics may have enjoyed an
other winning season, Shaw said he meas
ures success largely by graduation rates.
"This is college, this is about pursuing a
degree," he said."We don't admit students
of whom we don't have every expectation
will graduate."
According to NCAA data, be
tween 2002-2005,93 percent of Stan
ford football players graduated, by
far the best showing in the Pac-10
conference — the University of
Washington was next, at 64 percent.
The Cardinal also topped the base
ball rankings, with % percent of play
ers graduating.
In basketball, Stanford showed
second at 67 percent, to Washington s
70.That was before the departure this
year of the Lopez twins, sophomores
Brook and Robin,for the NBA.
"I don't like that, one can imag
ine," Shaw said of the early depar
tures.

Shaw said.he was "dismayed"
when he heard about the academic
troubles of Brook Lopez, who was
ruled academically ineligible fall
quarter.
"I don't know what was going on
in his mind," he said."lt's not OK with
me."
More distressing to the admission
dean are the graduation rates from
competing schools. Other institutions
known for academic prowess, like Cal
and UCLA, have performed dismally
in this respect. Cal graduated 52 per
cent of football players and 33 per
cent of basketball players, UCLA 56
and 40.
"We don't compromise, as others
do," Shaw said. "Other schools have
lost it, in my estimation. It's pretty dis
couraging to see."

athletic prowess.
"It puts more pressure on coaches,"
Shaw said. "They have to go out and find
kids that might not be on everybody's
radar screen — taking the right courses,
doing well in the classroom."
Meanwhile, Montgomery said that
coaches understand the unique balance
that Stanford finds between athletics and
academics.
"Nobody wants somebody to come in
and open the gates — nobody." Mont
gomery said. "The coaches don't. Nobody
does. Everybody understands that we
have [a] harder job in terms of locating
kids that can do that kind of work that is
expected here. That's what makes for the
integrity of this whole thing."
"If it broke down, it would be a prob
lem," he added. "Nobody wants that. The
key word is fair, and/or reasonable."
Bowlsby said it was "pretty well cer
tain" that Stanford would take home a
record 14th straight Director's Cup. which
measures all sports equally. But the athlet
ic director expressed enthusiasm that the
high profile, revenue-producing sports
such as football, basketball and baseball
appeared on the upswing.
"1 don't think you can call yourself the
best athletics program in the country if
you can't win consistently in the sports
that the media follows [and] that fans
covet," he said.
While athletics may have enjoyed an
other winning season, Shaw said he meas
ures success largely by graduation rates.
"This is college, this is about pursuing a
degree," he said."We don't admit students
of whom we don't have every expectation
will graduate."
According to NCAA data, be
tween 2002-2005,93 percent of Stan
ford football players graduated, by
far the best showing in the Pac-10
conference — the University of
Washington was next, at 64 percent.
The Cardinal also topped the base
ball rankings, with % percent of play
ers graduating.
In basketball, Stanford showed
second at 67 percent, to Washington s
70.That was before the departure this
year of the Lopez twins, sophomores
Brook and Robin,for the NBA.
"I don't like that, one can imag
ine," Shaw said of the early depar
tures.

Shaw said.he was "dismayed"
when he heard about the academic
troubles of Brook Lopez, who was
ruled academically ineligible fall
quarter.
"I don't know what was going on
in his mind," he said."lt's not OK with
me."
More distressing to the admission
dean are the graduation rates from
competing schools. Other institutions
known for academic prowess, like Cal
and UCLA, have performed dismally
in this respect. Cal graduated 52 per
cent of football players and 33 per
cent of basketball players, UCLA 56
and 40.
"We don't compromise, as others
do," Shaw said. "Other schools have
lost it, in my estimation. It's pretty dis
couraging to see."

A commemorative football sits on a
shelf in the office of Richard Shaw, dean of
admission.The ball marks Stanford foot
ball's dramatic 24-23 upset win over the
University of Southern California last
fall, which, the Cardinal faithful hope,
may indicate the beginning of a new era
in Stanford athletics.
For that era to begin, Shaw will play a
crucial role. Stanford is unique among uni
versities nationwide for its balance of suc
cess in the classroom and on the playing
field. Yet for many the admission office is
responsible for precluding success in high
profile sports such as football and basket
ball.
"If we lose, guess who's at fault?"
Shaw said, pointing at himself. "And
that's fine. The reality is that we're still
going to sustain expectations."
Shaw, the gatekeeper who rejected
nearly 23,000 applicants to the Universi
ty this year, said he would not compro
mise Stanford's stringent admission stan
dards in the name of athletic success.
"It's important to maintain stan
dards," he said. "Intercollegiate athletics
is a huge concern. But we have lots of val
ues."
Shaw sits in a hard place. Professors
grumble that standards should be higher.
Coaches complain when they can't get
their star recruits admitted.
"We're not going to get them all," he
continued. "If that means somebody else
might, that's the way it is. But we're not
somebody else, we're Stanford. I have no
apologies for the place this is."

It's not that Shaw doesn't want to win.
He ealled the Cardinal's soon-to-be
streak of 14 straight Director's Cups
"mind-boggling." And. of course, there is
the commemorative football in the office.
"Do 1 like to win?" Shaw said. "Yeah.
1 think winning is OK."
With experience at such high-profile
athletic schools as the University of Col
orado, UC-Berkeley and the University
of Michigan. Shaw understands the needs
of winning athletic departments. Shaw,
who came from Vale in 2005, was preced
ed by Robin Mamlet. who came from
Swarthmore in 2000 — a liberal arts col
lege in Pennsylvania that had a Division
111 athletic program.
This past year has been one of the most
successful in recent years for the larger
men's sports like football, basketball and
baseball. One reason is a small sample
size, but coaches and athletes say the ad
mission office has become more coopera
tive since Shaw took over in 2005.
"Dean Shaw, from everyone I've un
derstood, is empathetic," said former
men's basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He looks real hard to find a way
to help, as compared to ..." he said, trail
ing off.
"It's easy to say no," Montgomery
continued. "Let's find a way to make it
work. Everyone feels good about dealing
with Dean Shaw."
Shaw, for his part, will only admit that
he has worked to establish stronger lines
of communication with the athletics de
partment.
"In general, the goal is to have good re
lationships with all segments of campus,"
he said."l think we've established good re
lations with [Athletic Director] Bob
Bowlsby."
Bowlsby, who came to Stanford in 2006
from the University of lowa, said he hears
some complaints from coaches but he sees
athletics and admissions "on the same
team."
"I won't consider it to be us against

them — we're on the same page," Bowls
by said, acknowledging "there are certain
ly some disappointments along the way."
Shaw admitted the nature of his work
places a bigger burden on coaches and as
sistants in recruiting the right player —
one whose skills in the classroom match
athletic prowess.
"It puts more pressure on coaches,"
Shaw said. "They have to go out and find
kids that might not be on everybody's
radar screen — taking the right courses,
doing well in the classroom."
