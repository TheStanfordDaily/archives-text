# Class size discussions to continue

Despite widespread campus discussion regard
ing class size expansion, the Stanford community
should not expect any decision in the near future,
according to University administrators taking part
in the decision-making process.
"This is not an imminent event," said Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education John Brav
man.
Though plans for formal expansion may he far
down the road — or may never materialize at all
— Stanford recently experienced an unplanned
class size increase due to high yield in admission
cycles. This year's class of incoming freshman will
total approximately 1,727 students — about 57
more than the 1,670 target. And, at this time last
year, 1,745 initially signed with Stanford for the
Class of 2011.
Initial interest in the idea arose with University
President John Hennessy's column in the Septem
ber/October issue of Stanford magazine. Since Jan
uary, the pros and cons of expansion have been ex
amined by a task force,chaired by Board of Trustees
member Jim Canales '88 M.A/89 and English De
partment Chair Ramon Saldivar.
The task force has spent much of winter and
spring quarters gathering data and feedback and
will continue to examine the issue throughout the
summer as it moves toward a recommendation on
whether or not to expand class size.
"This is an issue we want to be very careful with
and very deliberate with." Saldivar said. "We want
to make sure we've covered all the bases."
Drawing upon the lessons of past expansions.

the task force will attempt to he conservative in its
planning if Stanford does decide to expand the size
of the freshman class.The class size increase would
likely he staggered so as to avoid excessive impact.
"If we were talking about an increase, we'd be
talking about a phased increase," Saldivar said.
"This wouldn't happen overnight."
"Stanford last increased its class size around 35
years ago, and that was a phased increase of a mod
erate number of students," Saldivar added. "Just
looking at history, my sense is it would be a very
measured increase. No one wants to shake the
boat."
The size of the increase would also have to be
carefully targeted. Planners have not yet committed
to a number but are looking at some scenarios with
a one to two hundred person increase per year.
"One hundred to two hundred is a range," said
Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to President 1 lennessy
and a member of the task force. "That's put out
there to help target analysis."
A central concern is ensuring that a class size in
crease would not take away from the quality of stu
dent life.
"We're looking at the quality of the residential
life experience," Wachtel said. "People are con
cerned about whether or not that will be compro
mised."
One benefit of expansion would be the opportu
nity for more students to pursue a high-quality edu
cation.
"We've built the finest undergraduate education
anywhere," Bravman said. "If we can offer it to
2,(KK) more people per decade, we should do that."
"You can look ahead 100 years, and see the op
portunity that education provides for additional,
supremely qualified students, and the promise that
holds," Saldivar added.

Any decision to expand the class size would
mean addressing an interconnected set of logistical
challenges. Providing housing for students is al
ready a concern tin campus due to space issues, and
any expansion would require the addition of a sig
nificant amount of student housing space.
" Ihe first and biggest [concern] on everyone's
mind is housing," Wachtel said. "We already have
enough housing, hut things are pretty tight as it is."
A class size expansion would also require an in
creased number of faculty.
"We're always looking for the best faculty,"
Bravman said. "But the total faculty size has been
growing very slowly."
"We'd have to do an increase more rapidly, and
that's very difficult to do." he added.
The expansion would also require funding to ac
commodate the additional strain on financial aid.
on-campus staff, overseas campuses and other
needs.TTiis would require a major fundraising cam
paign and would have to proceed independently
from and subsequently to the ongoing, five-year,
$4.3 billion Stanford Challenge.
"The president and the Board of Trustees would
have to call for a major campaign," Bravman said.
" Ihe scope of something like this can't be funded
on the margins."
Logistical challenges and planning considera
tions, however, will be secondary to the final deci
sion. Those involved say the most important factor
is choosing the best course for the University.
"No one doubts we could do this if we wanted
to," Bravman said.
"This is Stanford, after all." Saldivar added.
"Think of all the huge things we've accomplished
here."
