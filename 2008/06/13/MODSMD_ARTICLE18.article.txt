Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested
Thursday that she would likely be returning to
Stanford after she completes her service in the
Bush administration, saying she looked forward to
writing about her public service experience and re
turning to the classroom.
Speaking at a news conference with British for
eign Minister David Miliband at the Google cam
pus in Mountain View, Rice said she views the Sili
con Valley as her "natural habitat."
"I have been at Stanford since 1981," said Rice,
who is currently on leave from the University. "1
had a life long before being national security advi
sor and being secretary of state. I expect to have a
life after."
Rice said she hopes she will have an opportuni
ty to pursue writing and reflect on her experience
serving in the Bush administration.
"This has been a fundamentally different period
in American history and a period of great conse
quence," Rice said."And it's not somethingyou can
reflect on from within."
Rice said she also hopes to resume her previous
practice of coordinating policy simulations that
allow students to adopt roles as high-level decision
makers in the executive branch and craft policies
that respond to mock events that mirror real-world
security challenges. Rice said she hopes students
will "get a little taste of how it's actually not so easy
to make those decisions."
"I look forward to having an opportunity in the
classroom again to discuss the dilemmas that we've
faced, particularly since September 11Rice said.
If Rice were to come back to the Farm immedi
ately after her service as secretary of state, her re
turn would closely follow the controversial ap
pointment of former Secretary of Defense Donald

"I had a lite long
before being national
security advisor...
I expect to have a
life after."

Secretary of State

Rumsfeld as a distinguished visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution.TTie appointment of the former
Bush administration official sparked considerable
uproar among many students, faculty and staff
members who objected to some of the decisions he
made during his tenure, particularly those related
to the conduct of the Iraq War.
"Universities aught to be places in which all
points of view are both represented and wel
comed." Rice said. "If universities are not open to
views, no matter how controversial. I don't know
where the practices of the freedom of ideas will be
carried out."
"I was provost at Stanford." Rice added."And if
there's one thing I defended, and defended uncon
ditionally, it was the right of the faculty to hold
whatever view they have and to express it freely."
Rice said she does not anticipate a large public

outcry against her return.
"YVe'll see it people want me back." Rice said."l
think so."
Rice's remarks came during a two-day trip with
Miliband through Silicon Valley, where the officials
toured high-tech firms and received briefings on
renewable energy development.
During her remarks at Google's headquarters,
Rice defended the interrogation tactics against ter
rorist suspects approved by the Bush administra
tion in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.
Although she refused to discuss internal delibera
tions within the administration. Rice acknowl
edged that "a lot has happened, and a lot has
evolved in these years" since the attacks.
"As the United States did before, it's going to
continue to live up to its laws domestically as well
as to its international obligations," Rice said. "And
I think Americans expect the president to do what
ever he can within the law to protect Americans."
Rice also discussed the efforts of the Interna
tional Atomic l£nergy Agency (lAEA) and an in
ternational coalition of industrialized countries to
persuade Iran to halt its enrichment and reprocess
ing activities.
"One of the strongest parts of our policy has
been to require Iran to be fully transparent with the
1 AE A, which should have the right to the full array
of inspections in Iran," Rice said. "If Iran has
peaceful intent, as they say. then they should have
no problem with the International Atomic Energy
Agency having complete, absolute and total access,
and the word that is coming out is that that is not
being provided to the lAEA."
Putting politics aside. Rice said she was inspired
by the spirit of creativity and innovation that en
capsulates Silicon Valley.
"I look forward to the date when I can be here
on a more regular basis." she said.
