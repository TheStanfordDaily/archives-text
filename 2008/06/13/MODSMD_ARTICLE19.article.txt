## Co-terminal illness 
### 
People always ask me what I'm
doing after graduation. On Tues
day, I'm flying hack to Brooklyn.
My mother and I will take a cah from
the airport, and when we get home I'll
climb our stoop, open the front door,
walk upstairs and lay down on my bed
in a room that has changed remark
ably little since I left it five years ago. It
will be dusk, and I'll be tired from the
whirlwind of commencement festivi
ties. I"he air conditioner will be on. I'll
probably take a nap.
I'll wake upon a beach in Sicily.Waves
are lapping against my feet, still sore
from a day of digging in the dirt for
pottery shards. 1 decide to go for a
swim. 1 paddle over to an jagged, rocky
island and climb to the top. Looking
down forty feet into the shimmering
aquamarine sea. I cross myself and
jump. I sink down. down, and then
start rising, rising and surface with a
huge breath.
I'm gulping for air now. It's 8-all, and
my squash racquet feels like a sack of
bricks. It's game four, and I don't have
enough in the tank for a fifth. I serve.
After a 20-hit point, my arm flailing
like a rubber hose. 1 smack a hard
cross-court that's too much for my op
ponent.
"9-8 from the left. Game, match ball,"
the marker calls.

1 step into the box and look at the
crowd. My coach smiles at me. and I
wink back. I toss the ball in the air and
then thwap!
It's the sound of a screen door closing.
Fred Masiga is walking towards me.
I le has a knife in his hand. The chick
ens look up at us and then go back to
pecking the red earth.
We grab one, but the other flies out the
open gate. A neighbor girl, no more
than five,corrals the run-away bird for
us.
I step on one wing, then the other. Fred
shows me how to pluck the neck hairs,
and then I start sawing. The blood is
trickling out. The chicken is convuls
ing, try ing to break free. The jerking
becomes twitching, and then it goes
limp.
"Now you are Ugandan!" Fred laughs.

He slaps me on the back.
1 spin around.
"Drei Euro achtzig," the vendor says,
his blue eyes smiling.
I take a Styrofoam cup of steaming
Gluhwein. I dip my tongue in but re
coil from the bitterness. Another gust
of wind tears through the Christmas
market and all of a sudden 1 appreci
ate this boiling hot mix of cheap wine,
spices and rum. 1 take another sip and
it tickles my mouth, my throat and
then finally my stomach. Cheered. 1
push on past a sea of flushed Teutonic
faces. I'm related to them, through
some distant grandparent or great
uncle.
"Entschuldigen," I say. picking my
way through the crowd. I imagine that
1 am Louis Herbert, that I haven't yet
taken that steamboat to New Orleans
and then that riverboat up to Cairo.
"Entschuldigen."
I turn my cup upside down, and the
last drop falls on my outstretched
tongue. I close my eyes and savor the
taste.
I open my eyes. I'm in Brooklyn.The
air conditioner is on. 1 was dreaming.
And I ain't done yet.
