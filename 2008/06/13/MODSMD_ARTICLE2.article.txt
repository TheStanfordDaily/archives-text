Unlike last year's highly criticized speak
er choice, this year's Commencement speak
er will not be suffering from a lack of star
power.
Oprah Winfrey, the world famous talk
show host and philanthropist, has accepted
the University's invitation to speak at Stan
ford's 118 th Commencement.
Oprah's choice to speak at Stanford may
have been influenced by the upcoming grad
uation of her goddaughter, Kirby Bumpus
'08.
"She doesn't really do commencements
unless it's for someone she knows," Bumpus

said. "That's the only reason she's coming.
She gets asked a lot, so she can really do it
only when she has a special connection."
Oprah's invitation follows last year's se
lection of poet Dana Gioia, who many stu
dents complained lacked sufficient name
recognition.
"Obviously Oprah won't have that prob
lem at all," said Senior Class President
Melinda Lee '08. "She does have celebrity
star power, but beyond that she can provide
seniors with a wonderful and enthusiastic
speech. Her whole life is based off of being
a motivational speaker."
Senior Class President Brent Pirruccello
08 said this year's speaker selection process
was not influenced by negative reactions to
the choice of Gioia.
"I would say every year, the class presi

dents and the President's office do their best
to bring in a speaker that will really satisfy
everyone, and it doesn't work out every
year," Pirruccello said. "There was a big ef
fort put in [this year], but there is always a
large effort put in."
Many seniors were happy that this year's
speaker is a household name.
"It'll be fun to tell people later who our
Commencement speaker was and have
them know who it is," said Katie O'Neil '08.
Oprah, however, was not chosen to speak
exclusively because of her fame.
"Each year at Commencement we en
courage graduating students to think about
the skills they have acquired and the impact
they can have in the world," Stanford Presi
dent John Hennessy said in a statement. "I
can think of few people who have put such

advice to better use than Oprah Winfrey."
Oprah's impressive philanthropic record
and success as a businesswoman was a
major reason the University asked her to
speak.
"She has relentlessly continued her edu
cation and sought to improve the world in
remarkable and varied ways," Hennessy
said."Her efforts in the areas of philanthro
py — and her heartfelt desire to improve
the lives of less fortunate people — serve as
a model to us all."
"She's a great role model for women,"
said Lauren Falcao '08. "I'm really excited
about it."
Still, not all seniors are enthusiastic about
this year's speaker choice.
"As an average college male, my universe
and the universe of Oprah don't intersect at

all," said Andrew Gay '08. "I'm sure my mom
will be happy, but the only way I'll be happy
is if she gives us free cars."
IT»e class presidents consider themselves
fortunate that Bumpus has a close relation
ship with Oprah.
"1 feel very lucky that Kirby was in the
class of 20<)8said Senior Class President
Jessica Stanley '08."President Hennessy's of
fice was working with Kirby and us simulta
neously."
Bumpus is confident that her godmothei
will provide a memorable commencement
address.
"She's an amazing speaker," Bumpus
said, "and I know she'll have some great
words for our class."
