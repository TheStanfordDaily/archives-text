# Co-terminal illness
## Still don't have a clue 
### 
Looking back to the time when I
first considered applying to
Stanford, I'm amazed at how
far my expectations were from reali
ty.
For one thing, I had always
thought Stanford was perched on an
emerald-green cliff overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. Imagine Half Moon
Bay, and then plop Stanford down on
the edge of it. Ah. yes. 1 was sure it
would look like that. But when I got
around to visiting Stanford's campus,
my hopes were dashed liked a blue
Pacific breaker against my beloved
but completely imaginary cliffs.
I was also obsessed with the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator, which
played a not insignificant role in my
decision to apply.
"At two miles long, it's the largest
linear accelerator in the world!" I
would tell my friends over fried
Chicken-O's in my high school cafe
teria. Iliough 1 knew even back then
that I would be a humanities major, 1
daydreamed about taking "Physics
740: Hie Hunt for the Higgs Boson"
to fulfill my science requirement. It
would meet once a week at the accel
erator and feature colorful explo
sions, which I would record with
painstaking accuracy in a graphing
paper notebook. 1 had no idea that
there was such things as prerequi
sites — I figured I could bring myself
up to speed on any topic in about a

week.
The list goes on. Sitting beneath a
hundred-foot-tall California Red
wood and munching on an avocado, I
would converse with my new friends
in our third language: would it he
Russian, Italian, or perhaps an ob
scure Asian dialect? Only time
would tell! Also, 1 liked the idea that
there would be a lot of Olympic-cal
iber athletes around, which would
limit the nerd-factor and keep the
party-train rolling. The way I imag
ined it, college students — athletes
and non-athletes alike — would
function perfectly well on four hours
of sleep a night.
At each progressive stage of my
Stanford career, my expectations
have ceded a little more ground to
reality. But new and equally far
fetched expectations always form on
the horizon. Earlier this year, I had
the whimsical idea of writing a thesis
as part of my co-terminal master's
program, even though I had done ap
proximately zero research and didn't
have a topic. No matter, two quarters

is plenty of time to throw something
together!
And, so. after five years at this
place, I am forced to admit that I still
don't know what Stanford is really
about, that I keep trading one set of
unreasonable ideas for another. This
thought has been a consolation to me
as 1 consider, with fear and trem
bling, what post-graduation will be
like.
Fortunately, at least one of my
cherished fantasies has come true.
When I was applying to Stanford, 1
dreamed of being an award-winning
reporter for The Stanford Daily,
working myself up to Editor in Chief,
and then easing into a leisurely re
tirement by writing a weekly column.
One of those three things has hap
pened. Guess which one.
Of course, in my fantasy, I would
be typing these words of valediction
while seated on a campus bench
overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the
smell of salt in the air. But all 1 can
smell right now is the slight tang of
vinegar wafting from the kitchen of
my too-small apartment, which has
n't been cleaned in weeks. As they
say, "Love the one you're with."
And so I can offer no truer words
of gratitude than to say: It's been
real.Thanks for reading.
