# Little ms. modern
## Steel in the concrete 
### 
For the 99 percent of you who
are not structural engineers,
allow me to present an interest
ing, perhaps revelatory fact: there is
steel in concrete. Yes, almost all of
the apparent monoliths of modern
construction — highway overpasses,
the enormous piers of the new Bay
Bridge, pesky parking garage
columns - are actually composites of
cured, pebble-infused goop and
bumpy bars of steel.
Ibis is for good reason. While con
crete does have impressive strength
on its own, it can only withstand
forces in compression, and when its
capacity is surpassed, its failure can be
dangerously explosive. With the inte
gration of steel, however, reinforced
concrete overcomes these inadequa
cies to achieve awe-inspiring feats,
like gracefully spanning 200-foot
gorges and deftly dancing through
seismic shakeups without giving way.
Perhaps some of you already
know all this, and perhaps most of
you don't really care. But please hear
me out. apathetic know-it-alls —
things arc about to get metaphorical.
First, it may be surprising (and
disturbing) to learn that I. a soon-to
be graduate of Stanford's Structural
Engineering Masters program, was a
little bit fuzzy about the steel-in-the
concrete concept just one year ago.
As a freshly graduated architecture

student. 1 was full of ideals,but some
what technically inept. Four years of
intensive doodling and getting glue
in my hair had been fun, but despite
many pensive all-nighters capped by
naps in a pile of sawdust under my
desk. I began to suspect I knew very
little about how buildings stood up.
For example, my perception of
concrete was quite different than
that of my current engineering class
mates. probably to a degree that
would scandalize them. 1 didn't care
about cement or aggregate or curing
time or the ductility of post-peak be
havior. I certainly didn't care about
reinforcing steel.
Instead, like most architects, I was
intrigued by the material's emotion
al properties: its solidity, its massive
ness, its roughness and raw simplici
ty, its poetic sculptural capacity, its
symbolism as an instance from a
mold. My understanding of concrete
and the physical world in general was
like unreinforced concrete itself —
authentically strong and formidable

in some regards, but quite narrow in
application, and prone to brittleness
and crumbling at its limits.
I yearned for a better technical
background, and so to my architec
ture professors' horror, 1 applied to
engineering school. To my delight,
Stanford accepted me. I won't bore
you with the obvious details of cul
ture shock and acute academic pain,
but here's the obvious punch line of
my metaphor: the past year of en
lightenment has reinforced my for
merly simplistic understanding of
the built environment with a much
needed steely resilience.
In my attempts to bridge architec
ture and engineering, two closely re
lated fields that are nevertheless
barely on speaking terms, I am con
tinuously struck not by the suprema
cy of one over the other, but by the
amazing, beautiful results of their oc
casional cooperation. Just as rein
forced concrete assumes greater ca
pacities than the sum of its ingredi
ents, an appreciation for both the
qualitative and quantitative wonders
of the world allows us both to dream
big and really make it happen.

Caitlin would like to thank her family,
friends, professors and especially her
classmates for a wonderful year of
steel, concrete, and love. Say good-bye
