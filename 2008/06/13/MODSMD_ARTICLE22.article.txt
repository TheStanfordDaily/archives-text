# Dirty cal student
## Stankeley 
### 
Dear Stanford,
It has only been a year since 1 first
set foot upon your attractive
grounds, and yet I prepare to
leave. I still remember that first day:
Bright sunshine illuminated the
sandstone and adobe buildings,
warm air abetted my step,and the ex
citement of being a student at Stan
ford filled my heart. ITiis daze was
temporarily interrupted by the sight
of a dumpster, with the word "Cal"
spray painted on its side. A tear made
its way down my cheek, a silent com
memoration to the defiling of alma
mater. Not all was fair and good in
the land of palm trees and bicycles.
Yet with professional opportuni
ties unrivaled, free food gracing
every event and great PE classes to
burn off all those calories, you are
still a winner in my book. Plus you let
me be a columnist; unloading the
bowels of my mind upon the campus
community Speaking of which, I'd
like to thank all of my readers, loyal
or otherwise. Knowing that my work
is actually read brings me unparal
leled joy. Big ups to the haters, my
most loyal fans. Who else takes the
time to read through an entire piece.

post up a comment online, and even
cite pieces of my past work that I my
self have forgotten?
As both a dirty Cal and Stanford
student, I feel this is a good time to
state winning points for each school.
Stanford has a more peaceful, se
cluded campus with nicer running
venues. There are better and more
professional opportunities at Stan
ford. Getting housing is less of a has
sle, same with getting into classes.
For many career paths, Cal has
(much) better value for your money.
With the space and freedom of apart
ments. partying is more fun and plen
tiful at Cal. Eating is also more en
joyable at Cal, especially when it's
late at night and you're drunk.
Academically, both schools are
even; the quality of your education is

the same at both.There are no differ
ences between the best and brightest
at both schools.
Otherwise, both schools put too
much energy into rivalry and not
enough into companionship. I've said
it once and I'll say it again —we
should have a Big Hug, not a Big
Game.
Therefore, I propose the creation
of a new university, which synthe
sizes the best of both schools. I t shall
be called "Stankeley", not unlike
the Outkast album "Stankonia". It
shall be built halfway between both
institutions.either in the neutral ter
ritory of San Francisco, or on an ar
tificial island created in the bay. A
giant obelisk, of a length greater
than the sum of both the Campanile
and Hoover Tower, shall be the
dominant structure on campus. The
school logo will picture a tree and a
bear shaking hands. At the end of
each day, mutual grooming and/or
orgies will commence to facilitate
social cohesion.
Go Stankeley, and Go Tree-Lov
ing Bears!
