# The
						turnaround comes around
## 
### 
I'm in the unusual situation of essentially
getting two undergraduate careers — the
result of the unusual process of having en
rolled to get a master's degree, electing a year
later to pursue a Ph.D. and then deciding that
maybe it wasn't for me after all. (It's never too
late to change lanes.)
Nonetheless, 1 took full advantage of the
chance. In addition to taking two master's de
grees worth of coursework. I've had the pleas
ure of writing news, sports and features at The
Daily, clocking over three years as a KZSU
sports broadcaster, educating the future engi
neers of the world as a teaching assistant,
learning to cook and spending a brief period as
The Daily's elder statesman following the re
tirement and graduation of the peripatetic but
brilliant Nav Sivanandam.
What's an engineer doing brewing beer and
building his own media empire? Well, engi
neers are taught to do a job right, not waste a
lot of resources and not get loose with the facts
— skills that transfer remarkably well to other
fields. It's really been an opportunity for me to
stay literate and well-spoken, a point of lever
age in my career ambitions.
When I finally leave Stanford this summer,
I will do so with strong memories of some
things of which I will be forever proud, and
can't be taken from me.
For one. I had the honor of broadcasting
Stanford's historic win at USC last October.
I have told colleagues and friends that I am
perfectly happy leaving sportswriting and
broadcasting behind because I got to be part of
a transcendent event, one that will stick in the
public memory for a long time. All broadcast
ers wish for that experience, and I was lucky
enough to get it.(I figured I'd get something
after covering that 1-11 season the year be-

fore.)
But a football game is, in the end, a game; I
also had the opportunity to do some actual
lasting good. Last summer, the editors took a
courageous step in printing almost verbatim
my fact-filled but incisive exegesis of the Duke
lacrosse rape hoax — the attempted framing
of three students by a politicized district attor
ney with the encouragement of a portion of
the Duke faculty.The column turned out to be
wildly popular among followers of the case,
getting posted on blogs and producing a com
ment war on the Daily's Web site.

I was honored to receive the praise of one
of the case's best bloggers,and thankful emails
from the parents of players.
On the subject of perspective, I left college
with what I thought were regrets, a disappoint
ment about things I didn't get around to doing.
You know what's funny about it? After four
more years in school trying to do all those
things. 1 have the same feeling about a new list
of things. 1 guess life's just too short.
I would be remiss if 1 didn't mention this:
for those considering graduate school, let me
say one thing — run. (Just kidding.) No; grad
uate school can be a great step, but treat it like
a job. Come to understand that it is not an ex
tension of the undergrad years, and you will
have a much easier time adapting. And think
very hard about whether you want or need a
Ph.D., and don't even start the process until
you are sure.
It seems that for every period of my life,
even the bad ones I couldn't wait to see end, 1
look back with some positive thoughts. My
high times and some very low times at Stan
ford are no exception, involving deadlines,
problem sets, qualifying exams, the Stanford
bubble, meeting and losing the would-be love
of my life, gaining her back and losing her
again for good — this time for the best.
In retrospect,everything looked bent out of
proportion, all the stress unnecessary. I wish
someone had told me by being open to the fu
ture and avoiding the things that drag you
down, your bad times will not last.
My true regrets are always the same — not
that I ever departed too early or too late, but
that I didn't enjoy things enough when I had
them. So take a deep breath, live your life hard
and keep your eyes open. Life is short, so catch
the wave.
