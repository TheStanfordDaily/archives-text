If there is one thing you should do while
at Stanford, it is to fail. Looking back
on my years of classes, staffing, extra
curriculars and relationships. I have to say
that all the advice I could want to give is
summed up by that sentence. Failure is a
necessary part of learning and growing
and there is no better place to do it than in
the comfort of the Stanford bubble.
Most people come to Stanford without
having encountered much failure in their
lives.They were the star athlete, straight-A
student, brilliant musician, computer whiz,
or all of the above. Stanford students are
really good at never giving themselves the
opportunity to fail. "I can't ask her out, if
she wants to go out with me she'll ask me."
"I didn't do well on that test but that is be
cause I didn't have time to study." When is
the last time you let yourself out of the box
called "your limits?"
Failure means different things to dif
ferent people. For some, the hardest thing
to do will be taking a class you know you
can't get an A in. For others it will be try
ing out for an A Cappella group and not
getting in, or being dumped by someone
for the first time.To another person, how
ever. these "failures" might seem only like
minor setbacks. Excellence in an area is
not a prerequisite for passion. You might
be surprised to learn that even though
you are tone-deaf,you really love singing.
Since classes and relationships are
often the areas where Stanford students
worry about failing most, 1 often tell my
freshmen that if you get straight As at
Stanford, you aren't challenging yourself
enough. There are classes, somewhere on
this campus, where you aren't going to be
the best no matter how hard you try. If
you never discover the mix of pride and
pain behind working the hardest you have
ever worked only to get a B, then you
aren't taking advantage of what Stanford

has to offer. As for relationships, it is no
wonder that many never get a chance to
start. We are too busy to put in the time
and too worried that it wouldn't work out
to start one.
Take a detour from your four-year
plan and try something you have never
done before. I hope when you look back
on your Stanford career, you can be pleas
antly surprised by the person you have
become.
In the real world, we will all fail, prob
ably in a spectacular fashion. So if we
don't get good at coping with failure now,
we are just going to hit the ground that
much harder later on. Where you imagine
yourself in ten years, you will probably
not be where you thought you would end
up. For better or worse, we can't control
everything that happens in out lives.
But,change and failure are not all bad.
I never expected to work at The Daily or
rebuild New Orleans over my spring
breaks. I certainly didn't expect to be on
academic probation by the end of my
freshman year. I didn't realize how hard
RAing was going to be or how much I
would love it. 1 am neither co-terming in
Aero/Astro Engineering as I had planned
nor minoring in Chinese. However. I am
pretty happy with where I am going and I
couldn't ask for anything more out of my
Stanford experience.
