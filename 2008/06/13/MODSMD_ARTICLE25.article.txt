You wrote yourself a letter on the sec
ond day of your freshman year, along with
every other member of the great class of
2008. The letter wasn't great, but don't
worry, it wasn't embarrassing either. You
were scared then, of change, of not making
any friends, of showing anyone that you
were scared. If I could give you this letter in
time, 1 would be able to comfort you.
You rightly point out that you, Sept. 21,
2004 Kat. don't have any friends at Stan
ford. lliis is true. What you don't know is
that you've already met the person who
will become your most valued friend —
you think she hates you, but I swear she
doesn't. Over the next four years, you will
love her with a fierceness and loyalty that
will come closer to approaching greatness
than anything else you have ever been a
part of. At the end of senior year, you will
have a medical emergency (learn what
Wikipedia is and look up "spontaneous
pneumothorax" so you're not so scared this
time) and spend a terrifying ten-minute car
ride convinced that you are going to die be
fore you have reached adulthood. During
this car ride, reflecting on your relationship
with her will bring you comfort that you
have lived a full life.
Also, don't try to befriend her by com
plimenting her Aqua ring tone. She will still

make fun of this four years later, when the
two of you co-host swanky parties with
your exquisite group of friends.
The driver of the car you thought you
were dying in will he someone you haven't
met yet, a hoy. (Yes, he's Jewish, don't
worry.) Treat him well. While the doctors
are gathering around and you are weeping
in the ER.you will realize that ten minutes
laying in bed with him, talking or not talk
ing. means more to you than all the great
books you have ever read. (But don't
worry, pretentious little schmuck, by the
time you are 21 you will have read a num
ber of great books, and not just lied about it
to impress people.)
Within his love, you will bloom and ma
ture — you will stop being so defensive
and mock-brassy all the time, and will be
comfortable with your insecurities, lliis
will make you less insecure.

You were afraid, when you wrote
your letter, that you would one day
forget how wonderful your childhood
was, and how much you love your
parents. It's okay, Kat. You will only
grow closer to them. Just pick up their
damn phone calls once in a while in
the coming months, okay? They are
worried about you and they are not
going to judge you.They will be there
when you do something incredibly
stupid in a few months, and they will
support you without making you feel
weak. Trust your mother's advice,
about boys and jobs and clothes. This
will save you some heartache.

You think you're in love now, and
are pretending to be casual about it.
This is not really love. It's okay, it
won't break you even though for a
long time you will feel broken. Even
tually you will be thankful that he was
the one who got you to come to Stan
ford. Do not send him drunk text
messages, Kat. Just do not.
You're doing well, man. You have
just started what in four years you will
regard as the best period of your life.
You will have made friends, had advi
sors and succeeded in projects that
are outside the scope of your vision
right now. Be brave. I have faith in
you.
