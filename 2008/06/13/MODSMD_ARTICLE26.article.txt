Thank you, graduates of Stanford University's
Class of 2033. I'm honored to be
here. I know most of you were hoping to
hear Chelsea Clinton. "01. hut 1 understand as
president of the United States, she's pretty
busy.
But I, too, once attended this fine institu
tion. And I 'd like to share with you some of my
insights and experiences from that dark time
known as the years 2004 through 2008, some 25
years ago...
Esteemed graduates, I hope ycu leave Stan
ford as 1 once did, ready to face the world
ahead, hut sad to leave the place you called
home for four years. And if there was a home
within a home for me at Stanford, it was called
The Daily.
You see. back then we had these things
called newspapers. They were printed on
paper — you know, that stuff made out of
trees. We had newspapers for getting informa
tion, and for doing crossword puzzles and Su
doku during lectures. And, for half of my jun
ior year, 1 was the editor — meaning I was in
the office until 2 am most nights working to
put out the paper the next day. It sounds ar
chaic. 1 know. But it was the experience of a
lifetime.
I came to The Daily as a wide-eyed fresh
man, hailing from Roble 11 all. In 2004, Roble
was a four-class dorm, which meant we had
juniors and seniors to buy us beer. Campus, of
course, was not dry then.
But I digress. After working as a reporter

If there was a home
within a home for me at
Stanford, it was called
The Daily.

during my freshman year, I was hooked. 1
signed on to edit the news section, and they
had me — first in the office once a week, then
every day. We enjoyed great times in the of

fice, which of course is in a different building
today. We also, from time to time, broke some
hard-hitting news. We may not have investi
gated enough — but who would have thought
that Hoover Tower was actually a rocket ship
built to fly Condoleezza Rice and Donald
Rumsfeld to the moon in 20W?
But I didn't live at The Daily all four years.
I spent some quality time in Mirrielees,
Robinson House and off campus senior year.
We had this thing called The Draw to assign
housing, but 1 won't get into that... I realized
that it doesn't matter where you live on this
gorgeous campus; it is who you live with. Ex
cept Donner. I don't think I could bring myself
to live there.
Class of 2033.1 won't bore you with my in
numerable fond memories of The Farm.
Camping out for basketball games, sneaking
onto the roof of Mirrielees and MemAud,
backpacking through Patagonia (1 got there
before all the glaciers melted), studying
abroad in Santiago, power rankings, power
hours.Band runs.pub nights... I could goon for
days.
Congratulations, class of 2033. Thank you
for the honor of addressing you. I'm sorry you
weren't as lucky as we were in 2008.
We had Oprah.
