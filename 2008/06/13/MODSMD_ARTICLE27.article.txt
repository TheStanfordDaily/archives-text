# No regrets

### 
r | ill ere is so much I didn't do. I never lived
on West Campus. While I often day-
X dreamed of sailing a makeshift boat in
Lake Lag during long, unproductive Sunday
afternoons. I never even made it over to see
the its glittering, transient waters. I've heard
Lag Late Night is leaps and hounds better
than Stern's, but I can't substantiate these
claims. In my four years at Stanford, 1 could
never really complain of long bike rides to
and from ciass, although this was a plus, and
there are at least five dorms that have ab
solutely no meaning to me. Granada who?
I never played The Game. I refused to
spend an entire night searching ceaselessly
for obscure clues, or spend the next day
sleeping in. Who knows how I could have
benefited? New friends? Knowledge of new
places? I was so certain the loss trumped the
probability of gain. I never took the opportu
nity to be adventurous.
I never went to Bay to Breakers.The lure
of early morning drunkenness, kegs in shop
ping carts, and ridiculous costumes always
eluded me. The requisite planning before
hand always proved too burdensome. I low

does the long line of runners and revelers
look from the top of I layes Street I lill? I've
only seen pictures. What is the average
booze-to-distance ratio? I can only cite sec
ondary sources.
Were my four years here hopelessly dis
appointing? Although 1 missed out on as
pects of campus life that seem inexcusable,
there were many things 1 did which merit
some prideful reflection. I survived the
plague at Toyon to live on the Row for two
years, once as a resident and once as a (re
sponsible?) staff member. I ended up more
than once on the roof of Sweet Hall, some
times to cap a romantic evening, sometimes
to cap a night of partying. And while I missed
some great events in San Francisco, 1 tried
making up for it by exploring Berlin during
my quarter abroad.
I low can you make up for lost time? Sure,
I had some fun. but in looking back on my col
lege experience,it is as much about what I ac
complished as what I didn't. What is the best
way to mitigate fixation on the latter? My so
lution is simple:stay at Stanford. And so I em
bark on that journey for those who need a lit

tic more time to fully enjoy the California sun:
the co-term degree. I have made a commit
ment to myself, however, to dedicate next
year to eradicating potential regrets, "lxave
nothing undone" will he my motto.
To all those who will be leaving The Farm
for good. I can only hope you have graduat
ed with little left undone — I hope that you
are satisfied with the time you have spent
here. Travel and spread all over the world,
and remember this place, where you have
spent some of your formative years. You par
ticipated in the formation of a special com
munity. It wasn't a perfect community — no
community is — but perhaps you. like me,
will remember this institution as an impor
tant steppingstone to a fulfilling life. A life, as
it were, with no regrets.
