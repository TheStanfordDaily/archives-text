I've made Erin Andrews smile. I've watched
Keith Jackson urinate. I've been called the
n-vvord by a black man and a coward by
anonymous internet posters.
I interviewed President Hennessy, and
helped break the news of President Hush's visit.
I broke the story of a drunk Tree losing her po
sition, and of Azia Kim losing hers too.
I've asked ill-received questions to Lloyd
Carr (who gave me a five-second stare and a
one-sentence answer) and Bobby Knight (who
did the same, before storming out of a press
conference).
I've sat at my laptop until 3 a.m., editing at
$6.25 an hour. I've sat courtside at what would
be $500 seats. I've sat in a cab with an alcoholic,
who stiffed me on a $20 fare.
I've walked in on friends making out in the
Daily office. I've had the favor returned by one
of the cutest girls in my grade at 5 a.m. (And re
ally. who decides to pick up their $40 paycheck
at 5 a.m.?)
1 wrote about others for four years. I might
just have found myself.
A head coach cursed me out behind my
back. A drunk basketball player cursed me out
to my face. ResEd higher-ups cursed me out in
both locations.
I've been interviewed twice on national TV.
I've kept my mouth shut — and a promise —
on a story that might have been number three.

I've been screamed at by fellow staff mem
bers. soundly defeated in an Editor-in-Chief
election. 1 couldn't get a local internship to save
my life, only for Fortune magazine to offer me
one in New York City.
I've had professors tear apart my writing in
their classes. I've had professionals across the
country email me congratulations on articles
well-done.
I've bonded with a girlfriend on five-hour
trips to games. I've nearly lost my RA job and
my housing. I've found a name for my first born
child. (Taj Novinson. Mr. Finger gave me his
blessing.)
I've learnt to take my lumps,learnt to handle
success, learnt to work hard, learnt to smile.
I've lived. And I wouldn't change a thing.
