So I'm not much of a writer. But
I've managed to consistently
spend a few days a week for
four years of my life in and out of
the little building tucked between
the Mechanical Engineering Re
search Lab and Terman Engineer
ing Building, which are. incidentally,
where I spent the rest of my time in
college. Ever since a fellow resident
in Burbank, my sophomore dorm,
who was into photography told me
that I could shoot pictures for The
Daily, I've managed to find myself
sitting at the photo desk, tweaking,
cropping, captioning and re-color
ing the night away. The question
now. looking back on it. is why the
hell I did it.
Not that I did it for the money (I
think I would have made more swiping
cards at Stern Dining),or the fame (the
rush of seeing my pictures in print
every week subsides just as quickly as
the buzz you get from smoking cheap
Mexican cigarettes). And it definitely
wasn't due to any fondness for the way

the men's bathroom smells (which, in
the time I've been here, has only gotten
worse). The free beer and ice cream
definitely helped (1 was a free-food
moocher even before becoming a
graduate student), as did the fact that
Camille Ricketts was the Editor-in-
Chief IC for the entirety of my first
year at The Daily. (Although Julie
comes pretty close on the awesome
and hotness scalc.)
Aside from the vices of photogra
phy. I even wrote four or five columns
two summers ago when 1 was in
Berlin, about the World Cup, about
why you should go streaking, and
about how I got a free beer when I
went to see the premiere of Snakes on
a Plane (probably one of the best
things that's ever happened to me). 1
was of course inspired by Darren
Franich, who 1 got to know in Ger
many. 1 clearly didn't fill those big
shoes he left behind.

Don't get me wrong; being a Daily
photographer definitely has perks,
like how much more trusting people
are when you have a giant camera.
When Chelsea FC (the soccer team)
visited last summer, I managed to
walk into the stadium without a tick
et. walk past three lines of security
and onto the pitch without having to
show any form of ID, and ended up
being 5 feet from Didier Drogba's ass
when he was doing warm-ups. So re
ally, working at Hie Daily is not about
getting paid, or getting recognition,
it's really about getting you the op
portunity to point a camera at famous
people's rear ends. And that's why I
got two engineering degrees from
Stanford.
Watch out Hollywood, here I
come!

John Sheti wants to let yon know that
he's available for photographing all
kinds of asses. He'll also he working in
San Jose putting those degrees to use.
