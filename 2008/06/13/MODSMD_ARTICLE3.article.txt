## Former secretary of defense to join Hoover as visiting fellow

In a move that has set student and faculty
email lists abuzz with angry chatter even he
fore most students have returned to campus,
Donald H. Rumsfeld will be joining the
Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting
fellow, the University announced Sept. 7.
It is still unclear when the former secretary
of defense will begin the appointment, and
when — if ever — he will set foot on the Farm.
But the news regarding the man who oversaw
the nation's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
has sparked a growing student and faculty
backlash — including talk of a mock trial for
war crimes, calls for a resolution in the Faculty
Senate condemning the appointment and an
online petition, with 1,305 signatures at press
time.
The debate has spurred political activism
rare at Stanford and broaches such topics as
campus partisanship, academic freedom and
the nature of the relationship between the Uni
versity and Hoover. The questions currently
asked may preview the looming dispute if and
when U.S. Secretary of State and former
Provost Condoleezza Rice returns to Stanford,

a move she has said in numerous interviews she
intends to make.
Task force role
According to Hoover Director John
Raisian, Rumsfeld will serve on a task force
pertaining to national security, ideology and
terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11,2001
terrorist attacks.
" I am pleased that he will spend time during
the coming year in thinking, writing and advis
ing on important matters of public policy,"
Raisian said in a statement."! have asked Don
to join the distinguished group of scholars that
will pursue new insights on the direction of
thinking that the United States might consider
going forward. I am delighted that he will par
ticipate in the deliberations of our task force."
Rumsfeld's ties to Hoover, the conserva
tive-leaning think tank, are numerous. In the
past, he has served as a member of the Hoover
Board of Overseers and as a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the board.
The Hoover Institution has not yet set a
timetable for Rumsfeld's appointment to
begin. Hoover Public Affairs Manager Michele
Horaney said; no other members of the task
force have been named. It is expected to con
vene infrequently, with members meeting from
time to time then going back to other endeav
ors. Rumsfeld is expected to begin work on his
memoirs, having met with several New York
publishing houses during the summer.
Hoover is aware of the comments in oppo
sition to the appointment, Horaney said, "but
the appointment has already been made."

Rumsfeld's position will consist entirely of*
work for the task force, and he will not teach
classes.
Growing opposition
Many other prominent conservatives, in
cluding former Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich and General John Abizaid, the for
mer commander of U.S. Central Command,
have been named to fellowships at Hoover
with little fanfare. But the appointment of
Rumsfeld — whose actions during the buildup
to and waging of the Iraq war are considered
particularly egregious and distasteful by many
students and faculty — has struck a particular
political nerve.
"Many Stanford faculty are outraged by
this appointment of a war monger and torture
facilitator into any part of the University envi
ronment, even if the Hoover Institute is not di
rectly connected with the University." said
emeritus professor of psychology Philip Zim
bardo, whose recent book "The Lucifer Effect"
holds the former defense secretary directly re
sponsible for the torture and abuse of de
tainees in military prisons such as Abu Ghraib.
"The perception of the world is that (Hoover]
is part of Stanford, a very visibly erect part of
our beloved campus. We value truth, justice,
peace and respect for human dignity — princi
ples which this former Secretary of War has
consistently violated."
