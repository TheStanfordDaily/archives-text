# Donald Rumsfeld coming to Stanford
## Former secretary of defense to join Hoover as visiting fellow 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Originally published on Sept. IS, 2(H)7
In a move that has set student and faculty
email lists abuzz with angry chatter even he
fore most students have returned to campus,
Donald H. Rumsfeld will be joining the
Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting
fellow, the University announced Sept. 7.
It is still unclear when the former secretary
of defense will begin the appointment, and
when — if ever — he will set foot on the Farm.
But the news regarding the man who oversaw
the nation's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
has sparked a growing student and faculty
backlash — including talk of a mock trial for
war crimes, calls for a resolution in the Faculty
Senate condemning the appointment and an
online petition, with 1,305 signatures at press
time.
The debate has spurred political activism
rare at Stanford and broaches such topics as
campus partisanship, academic freedom and
the nature of the relationship between the Uni
versity and Hoover. The questions currently
asked may preview the looming dispute if and
when U.S. Secretary of State and former
Provost Condoleezza Rice returns to Stanford,

a move she has said in numerous interviews she
intends to make.
Task force role
According to Hoover Director John
Raisian, Rumsfeld will serve on a task force
pertaining to national security, ideology and
terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11,2001
terrorist attacks.
" I am pleased that he will spend time during
the coming year in thinking, writing and advis
ing on important matters of public policy,"
Raisian said in a statement."! have asked Don
to join the distinguished group of scholars that
will pursue new insights on the direction of
thinking that the United States might consider
going forward. I am delighted that he will par
ticipate in the deliberations of our task force."
Rumsfeld's ties to Hoover, the conserva
tive-leaning think tank, are numerous. In the
past, he has served as a member of the Hoover
Board of Overseers and as a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the board.
The Hoover Institution has not yet set a
timetable for Rumsfeld's appointment to
begin. Hoover Public Affairs Manager Michele
Horaney said; no other members of the task
force have been named. It is expected to con
vene infrequently, with members meeting from
time to time then going back to other endeav
ors. Rumsfeld is expected to begin work on his
memoirs, having met with several New York
publishing houses during the summer.
Hoover is aware of the comments in oppo
sition to the appointment, Horaney said, "but
the appointment has already been made."

Rumsfeld's position will consist entirely of*
work for the task force, and he will not teach
classes.
Growing opposition
Many other prominent conservatives, in
cluding former Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich and General John Abizaid, the for
mer commander of U.S. Central Command,
have been named to fellowships at Hoover
with little fanfare. But the appointment of
Rumsfeld — whose actions during the buildup
to and waging of the Iraq war are considered
particularly egregious and distasteful by many
students and faculty — has struck a particular
political nerve.
"Many Stanford faculty are outraged by
this appointment of a war monger and torture
facilitator into any part of the University envi
ronment, even if the Hoover Institute is not di
rectly connected with the University." said
emeritus professor of psychology Philip Zim
bardo, whose recent book "The Lucifer Effect"
holds the former defense secretary directly re
sponsible for the torture and abuse of de
tainees in military prisons such as Abu Ghraib.
"The perception of the world is that (Hoover]
is part of Stanford, a very visibly erect part of
our beloved campus. We value truth, justice,
peace and respect for human dignity — princi
ples which this former Secretary of War has
consistently violated."

Protesters wore black coverings on their heads in White Plaza on Nov. 8 to protest the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting fellow.
Speeches and songs dotted the hour-long rally.
Polhemus entitled "Ten reasons why the appointment of Donald
Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institution at Stanford as a Senior Fel
low is sad, ridiculous and contemptible," has widely circulated
and garnered more than 40 responses from like-minded faculty
overnight, Polhemus said. The email, which condemns Rumsfeld
for his "arrogance, failure and incompetence," expresses worry
that Stanford's affiliation with Hoover will damage the Universi
ty's reputation and differentiates Rumsfeld from Gingrich or
Rice by his lack of "intellectual and academic experience and/or
some measure of achievement."
"It [the appointment] really struck me the wrong way," Polhe
mus said. "The University should not be supporting a guy like
this."
Relationship with Hoover called into question
The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace has
been a fixture on the Stanford campus since former U.S. president
Herbert Hoover (Class of 1895) donated a founding endowment
of $50,000 in 1919. Its charter, which was approved by the Univer
sity Board of Trustees, calls for the study of the forces behind
modem political and economic change. But beginning with the
tenure of former director Glenn Campbell, the think-tank has
emerged as a prominent voice in conservative politics, sometimes
at odds with Stanford's more liberal faculty and student body.
Tension first reached a peak during the mid-1980s when a stu
dent and faculty revolt effectively derailed plans to place the
Ronald Reagan Presidential library on campus. Relations have
since improved, Polhemus said,characterizing Raisian's tenure as
Hoover director as one of compromise and good feelings.
"But a line was crossed with appointment of Rumsfeld: he
doesn't have any previous academic background," Polhumus
said, adding, "We should really reconsider Hoover's relationship
with Stanford at this point."
There are no concrete proposals for what a different relation
ship would look like, but history suggests it could involve "normal
academic governance," with appointments requiring the ap
proval of the University's academic committees. That phrase was
invoked during the Reagan library debate in 1984 and dismissed
by Hoover fellows by chants of "nag, nag, nag."
Such a reconsideration is not in the University administra
tion's plans.
"The University is a place of free expression of ideas, and
there are some ideas that generate controversy, but that's not a
reason not to have those ideas expressed," said Jeff Wachtel, spe
cial assistant to President John Hennessy. Appointments and fel
lowships such as Rumsfeld's are the prerogative of individual in
stitutions and departments, Wachtel said, adding that the ques
tions regarding the relationship between the University and
Hoover are unfounded.
"Whenever there are controversial appointments, that ques
tion always gets asked," he said. "One controversial appointment
should not be the basis in which you would change a long-stand
ing relationship. It's not going to change the kind of relationship
the University has with Hoover."
Nonetheless, the growing student and faculty opposition
movement aims to make its position known and its feelings
heard. Plans are in the works for a campus-wide collaborative
protest against the appointment, said Sam Dubai '08, who found
ed the "Rumsfeld — You Are not Welcome at Stanford!" group
on Face book.
"It was necessary for students to be able to organize to express
their collective shock, disgust and anger with the arrival of a war
criminal on Stanford's campus," said Dubai, adding that political
ly inclined student groups such as the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East, the Stanford Anti-War Coalition, Muslim Student
Awareness Network and Amnesty International are likely to mo
bilize against the appointment. As of press time, the group boast
ed 220 members.
The conservative minority
Not all students are speaking out against Rumsfeld or his new
affiliation with Hoover.The University's Republicans, the minor
ity on campus and often the sole conservatives in lopsided politi
cal debates in class discussions, have called for respect of Rums
feld's position as a prominent politician. Some have attempted to
appeaJ to a sense of academic freedom and the free exchange of
ideas, despite ideological disagreements with Stanford's liberal
majority.
"I would expect Stanford students to be respectful of those
they disagree with — especially when it is someone within the
mainstream of American politics — but, then again, these are
also the same students who tried to physically obstruct President
Bush from attending a meeting at Hoover in April of 2006," said
Carl Kelm '09, the incoming president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "So I can't say I'm completely shocked [at the op
position]."

There are no concrete proposals for what a different relation

invoked during the Reagan library debate in 1984 and dismissed

Such a reconsideration is not in the University administra

"The University is a place of free expression of ideas, and
there are some ideas that generate controversy, but that's not a

"Whenever there are controversial appointments, that ques

should not be the basis in which you would change a long-stand

the University has with Hoover."
Nonetheless, the growing student and faculty opposition
movement aims to make its position known and its feelings
heard. Plans are in the works for a campus-wide collaborative
protest against the appointment, said Sam Dubai '08, who found

on Face book.
"It was necessary for students to be able to organize to express
their collective shock, disgust and anger with the arrival of a war
criminal on Stanford's campus," said Dubai, adding that political
ly inclined student groups such as the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East, the Stanford Anti-War Coalition, Muslim Student
Awareness Network and Amnesty International are likely to mo

The conservative minority
Not all students are speaking out against Rumsfeld or his new
affiliation with Hoover.The University's Republicans, the minor
ity on campus and often the sole conservatives in lopsided politi
cal debates in class discussions, have called for respect of Rums
feld's position as a prominent politician. Some have attempted to
appeaJ to a sense of academic freedom and the free exchange of
ideas, despite ideological disagreements with Stanford's liberal
majority.
"I would expect Stanford students to be respectful of those
they disagree with — especially when it is someone within the
mainstream of American politics — but, then again, these are
also the same students who tried to physically obstruct President
Bush from attending a meeting at Hoover in April of 2006," said
Carl Kelm '09, the incoming president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "So I can't say I'm completely shocked [at the op
position]."

In a move that has set student and faculty
email lists abuzz with angry chatter even he
fore most students have returned to campus,
Donald H. Rumsfeld will be joining the
Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting
fellow, the University announced Sept. 7.
It is still unclear when the former secretary
of defense will begin the appointment, and
when — if ever — he will set foot on the Farm.
But the news regarding the man who oversaw
the nation's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
has sparked a growing student and faculty
backlash — including talk of a mock trial for
war crimes, calls for a resolution in the Faculty
Senate condemning the appointment and an
online petition, with 1,305 signatures at press
time.
The debate has spurred political activism
rare at Stanford and broaches such topics as
campus partisanship, academic freedom and
the nature of the relationship between the Uni
versity and Hoover. The questions currently
asked may preview the looming dispute if and
when U.S. Secretary of State and former
Provost Condoleezza Rice returns to Stanford,

a move she has said in numerous interviews she
intends to make.
Task force role
According to Hoover Director John
Raisian, Rumsfeld will serve on a task force
pertaining to national security, ideology and
terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11,2001
terrorist attacks.
" I am pleased that he will spend time during
the coming year in thinking, writing and advis
ing on important matters of public policy,"
Raisian said in a statement."! have asked Don
to join the distinguished group of scholars that
will pursue new insights on the direction of
thinking that the United States might consider
going forward. I am delighted that he will par
ticipate in the deliberations of our task force."
Rumsfeld's ties to Hoover, the conserva
tive-leaning think tank, are numerous. In the
past, he has served as a member of the Hoover
Board of Overseers and as a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the board.
The Hoover Institution has not yet set a
timetable for Rumsfeld's appointment to
begin. Hoover Public Affairs Manager Michele
Horaney said; no other members of the task
force have been named. It is expected to con
vene infrequently, with members meeting from
time to time then going back to other endeav
ors. Rumsfeld is expected to begin work on his
memoirs, having met with several New York
publishing houses during the summer.
Hoover is aware of the comments in oppo
sition to the appointment, Horaney said, "but
the appointment has already been made."

Rumsfeld's position will consist entirely of*
work for the task force, and he will not teach
classes.
Growing opposition
Many other prominent conservatives, in
cluding former Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich and General John Abizaid, the for
mer commander of U.S. Central Command,
have been named to fellowships at Hoover
with little fanfare. But the appointment of
Rumsfeld — whose actions during the buildup
to and waging of the Iraq war are considered
particularly egregious and distasteful by many
students and faculty — has struck a particular
political nerve.
"Many Stanford faculty are outraged by
this appointment of a war monger and torture
facilitator into any part of the University envi
ronment, even if the Hoover Institute is not di
rectly connected with the University." said
emeritus professor of psychology Philip Zim
bardo, whose recent book "The Lucifer Effect"
holds the former defense secretary directly re
sponsible for the torture and abuse of de
tainees in military prisons such as Abu Ghraib.
"The perception of the world is that (Hoover]
is part of Stanford, a very visibly erect part of
our beloved campus. We value truth, justice,
peace and respect for human dignity — princi
ples which this former Secretary of War has
consistently violated."

JASON CHUANG/The Stanford Daily
Protesters wore black coverings on their heads in White Plaza on Nov. 8 to protest the ap
pointment of Donald Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting fellow.
Speeches and songs dotted the hour-long rally.
Polhemus entitled "Ten reasons why the appointment of Donald
Rumsfeld to the Hoover Institution at Stanford as a Senior Fel
low is sad, ridiculous and contemptible," has widely circulated
and garnered more than 40 responses from like-minded faculty
overnight, Polhemus said. The email, which condemns Rumsfeld
for his "arrogance, failure and incompetence," expresses worry
that Stanford's affiliation with Hoover will damage the Universi
ty's reputation and differentiates Rumsfeld from Gingrich or
Rice by his lack of "intellectual and academic experience and/or
some measure of achievement."
"It [the appointment] really struck me the wrong way," Polhe
mus said. "The University should not be supporting a guy like
this."
Relationship with Hoover called into question
The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace has
been a fixture on the Stanford campus since former U.S. president
Herbert Hoover (Class of 1895) donated a founding endowment
of $50,000 in 1919. Its charter, which was approved by the Univer
sity Board of Trustees, calls for the study of the forces behind
modem political and economic change. But beginning with the
tenure of former director Glenn Campbell, the think-tank has
emerged as a prominent voice in conservative politics, sometimes
at odds with Stanford's more liberal faculty and student body.
Tension first reached a peak during the mid-1980s when a stu
dent and faculty revolt effectively derailed plans to place the
Ronald Reagan Presidential library on campus. Relations have
since improved, Polhemus said,characterizing Raisian's tenure as
Hoover director as one of compromise and good feelings.
"But a line was crossed with appointment of Rumsfeld: he
doesn't have any previous academic background," Polhumus
said, adding, "We should really reconsider Hoover's relationship
with Stanford at this point."
There are no concrete proposals for what a different relation
ship would look like, but history suggests it could involve "normal
academic governance," with appointments requiring the ap
proval of the University's academic committees. That phrase was
invoked during the Reagan library debate in 1984 and dismissed
by Hoover fellows by chants of "nag, nag, nag."
Such a reconsideration is not in the University administra
tion's plans.
"The University is a place of free expression of ideas, and
there are some ideas that generate controversy, but that's not a
reason not to have those ideas expressed," said Jeff Wachtel, spe
cial assistant to President John Hennessy. Appointments and fel
lowships such as Rumsfeld's are the prerogative of individual in
