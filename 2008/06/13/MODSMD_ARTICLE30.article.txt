# Failure
## 
### 
It's the time of year for speeches.
For proclamations, for pro
nouncements and. above all, for
predictions.
Nothing causes outbursts of lyrical
waxing quite like commencement.
Everyone has something profound to
say â€” usually on the subject of your
sparkling future.
(As a brief aside, what precisely is
supposed to be commencing at com
mencement? Your degree is ending,
not beginning. Maybe it's because
ceasement, endment and finishment
all sound a little ridiculous.)
I suppose in some ways the gradu-

Navin Sivanandam

ation ceremony is the final step in the
university branding process.They put
the stamp of approval on you and
send you out in the world to do what
you will; with the aforementioned
bevy of speeches making sure that
you're stuffed full of Very Important
Life Facts before you leave.

A great deal of the nonsense
you're going to hear revolves around
success. I low it's yours for the taking.
How it is your duty/responsibility/
god-given right to serve your fellow

men and women by doing fabulously
well.
Much is also made of the fact that
despite the aura of divinity that Stan
ford has wrapped you in, you must
work hard to achieve your dreams.
Failure is around every corner, wait
ing to ensnare you and rob you of all
you are entitled to.
However, contrary to what one
might be told, it's easy to succeed in
life. Moreover, it's not very impor
tant. You can he of far greater value
to humanity by embracing failure.
