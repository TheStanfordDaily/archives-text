# Failure
## 
### 
It's the time of year for speeches.
For proclamations, for pro
nouncements and. above all, for
predictions.
Nothing causes outbursts of lyrical
waxing quite like commencement.
Everyone has something profound to
say â€” usually on the subject of your
sparkling future.
(As a brief aside, what precisely is
supposed to be commencing at com
mencement? Your degree is ending,
not beginning. Maybe it's because
ceasement, endment and finishment
all sound a little ridiculous.)
I suppose in some ways the gradu-

ation ceremony is the final step in the
university branding process.They put
the stamp of approval on you and
send you out in the world to do what
you will; with the aforementioned
bevy of speeches making sure that
you're stuffed full of Very Important
Life Facts before you leave.

A great deal of the nonsense
you're going to hear revolves around
success. I low it's yours for the taking.
How it is your duty/responsibility/
god-given right to serve your fellow

men and women by doing fabulously
well.
Much is also made of the fact that
despite the aura of divinity that Stan
ford has wrapped you in, you must
work hard to achieve your dreams.
Failure is around every corner, wait
ing to ensnare you and rob you of all
you are entitled to.
However, contrary to what one
might be told, it's easy to succeed in
life. Moreover, it's not very impor
tant. You can he of far greater value
to humanity by embracing failure.
After all, before we get anything
right we invariably have to get it
wrong first (and second, and third,
and fourth...). Do you really think
the in-car cup-holder could have
been created without its innovative
(but somewhat unsuccessful) wheel
mounted predecessor?
The biggest problem with success
is that it is art end. If you achieve
what you set out to, the game is over.
Failure on the other hand, failure is a
gift that keeps on giving. If you can
pick yourself and try again, you'll
never lack for the excitement of en
deavor.

To some degree, to succeed is to
settle. No matter how mundane your
ambitions, it will always be the case
that to declare yourself satisfied
with the fruits of your labors will in
volve some modicum of compro
mise.
Now settling isn't perhaps always
a bad thing. After all if you can't
have what you want perhaps it's bet
ter to want what you have.
A better philosophy, though,
would be one that understood that
the goal is the pursuit of happiness,
not the end result. Embracing a life
time of continual setbacks amounts
to becoming enamored of the
process (or if one prefers the cliche;
it's the journey, not the destination,
that matters).
I generally frown on the giving of
advice and the spouting of sage wis

dom (though after a couple of pints
1 often fail to live up to my ideals),
but for my parting column 1 couldn't
resist.
There's a lot that I'll take away
from Stanford. A PhD. Friends. In
tellectual stimulation. But above all,
an appreciation that life really is at
its best when you appreciate that
trying has a great deal more value
than achieving.
So, amidst the urges to win and
the calls to succeed, let me be a voice
of dissent. Embrace a lifetime of
failure. Of setbacks. Of shattered
dreams. Of desperate, unfulfilled
hopes. And never settle and never
stop and never sit back and rest.

I'll he in Austin from September, in
Africa until then or at navin.sivanan
dam@gmail.com if you want me.
