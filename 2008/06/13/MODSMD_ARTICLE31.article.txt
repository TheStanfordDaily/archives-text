# My education is a rose
## 
### 
After four years as a Stanford English major, 1
have learned many things and have much wis
dom to pass on.The profundity of my reflection
could hardly be contained in the weak vessel of a retro
spective op-ed. Given this, and the high premium we
English majors place on specificity and economy, 1 de
vote this space to a brief plea: Stanford, it is time to re
vamp the metaphors we live by.
First, an introduction. If you are moved to write a
treatise of love, or find yourself struggling to articulate
an abstraction, or wish to impress upon people that you
are well educated, you may find yourself desirous of a
metaphor. Metaphors, you see, are rhetorical tools that
allow us to do all these things and more. Wikipedia ex
plains that metaphors are "an indirect comparison be
tween two or more seemingly unrelated subjects" in
order to suggest a similarity Instead of "1 feel ill" you
can say, "My bowels are an inferno of noxious gasses."
In fact,you should.
What you may not realize is that everyday lingo of
fers us the opportunity to make metaphorical connec
tions. The joy of the metaphor is the way it enriches our
ability to express ourselves. The danger is that
metaphors are rife with the potential for misunder
standing. At Stanford,the metaphors we live by are ter
ribly ambiguous.
Let's begin with nicknames. NSO touts our double
syllable mania,and indoctrinates the new students with
the painfully uncreative nicknames like"BigGame"or
"The Band." Though a bit predictable, these names
save us time so that we can conserve valuable syllables.
The problems arise elsewhere. For instance, why is
Stanford called "The Farm"? Ilie land used to be a
horse farm. Yet Stanford is actually not a farm, despite
our "Alphabet Soup" website that claims "Once a farm,
always a farm." I'm no linguist, but I'm pretty sure the
expression is "Once a farmer, always a farmer." If our
version was generalized, imagine the proportion of the
country that would qualify: Manhattan started being
developed from farmland not too long before Stanford
was founded. And why "The Dish?" "The Dish" is a
walk through the hills near a radio telescope. Howev
er, "dish" can also be a meal or a cute girl. If I say,"Do
you want to do the dish?" what do I mean? These am
biguities could be dangerously misleading.

Or the campus bubble. Let's be honest, bubbles
have been done — Yale, Cal, and UCLA all have bub
bles. Worse, there are economic bubbles, stock market
bubbles, and Michael Jackson's chimpanzee. Why a
bubble? Bubbles are round, they have a soapy sheen,
they are popular at weddings, and they pop when you
touch them. One passage of "Words of Wisdom" on the
UAL website claims: "The Stanford campus bubble
adds a nice cushion of safety." To be clear: bubbles
don't cushion, cushions cushion. A bubble would make
a very ineffectual cushion. We need a better word: a
protective layer with cushioning, isolating properties.
I've done a bit of research, and 1 think "cellulose insu
lation" might work (sustainable, sound proof), but I
haven't figured out how to idiom-ize it yet. Will keep
posted.
Finally, a legitimate non-nickname metaphor we are
wont to use on campus: ducks. 1 appreciate the urge to
raise awareness with mental health problems by using
the "Duck Syndrome" metaphor. 1 think the sentiment
is worthwhile, but ducks? Ducks are seriously abused
in the world of idioms:"a lame duck,""a dead duck,"or
"a sitting duck" (which doesn't sound violent except
that it means easy to physically or verbally attack).
Plus, there are already a number of other duck syn
dromes: baby duck syndrome has to do with beginner's
use of operating systems, toy duck syndrome is about
corporate strategy, and New Duck Syndrome, which is
a bacterial disease that can cause listlessness and eye
discharge in ducks. Sad.
I criticize because 1 love. Stanford's already the ra
diant Olympus of Silicon Valley, but the icing on the
cake of perfection would be harnessing the power of
metaphor to truly do it justice.
