# Senior Farewell
## 
### 
Iflew over Stanford the other day. I had
visited a friend, my freshman year room
mate. who is currently training in South
ern California with the U.S. National
Women's Water Polo Team for the 'OH Bei
jing Olympics. On my flight hack, lo and be
hold. Stanford's sprawling, green campus
lay directly below my tiny oval window.
'ITiere was the Dish, pointing directly up
wards and nestled like a robotic llower in
those rolling, russet foothills where I had
gone for an afternoon jog on so many dif
ferent afternoons. There was Roble, my
freshman dorm, where 1 met my water polo
superstar along with so many other kindred
spirits with whom I shared the trials and
tribulations of higher education. It was
where I got my heart broken and my eyes
opened, where I actually learned to appre
ciate my parents.
There was the bright, pearly, new Stadi
um. where I watched this year's Big Game,

and where, in the older, ricketier stadium 1
had watched two others. Last June, it was
where 1 Wacky Walked, a wonder of won
derful traditions where creativity, costumes
and joy beautifully collided for just over an
hour during one beautiful, Palo Alto day.
There were glittering rectangles of blue,
where 1 had gotten both sunburned and
rained on while watching my roommate
play so many of her water polo games.
There was the diving well, where 1 had
watched, with utter stupefaction, a bestie of
mine throw himself off a high-in-thc air
bendy metal board with unreal corporeal
precision.
The Quad was perhaps the easiest build
ing to spot, with its dominating centrality. It
is to where I repeatedly and recklessly
hiked in order to listen to so many intelli
gent men and women share things they
knew. It was where, under a full moon, I
kissed my fair share of senior boys. And

then my fair share of freshman ones. There,
on the northeast side, was the History Cor
ner. where I took my first Freshman Semi
nar. where I was tricked by the Chappie
into showing up for, I soon learned, a fake
Napoleon Dynamite II screening. (They
showed turtles having sex until I, and all the
other three hundred or so hapless and cred
ulous moon-boot loving students, stormed
out angrily.) It is where the doors are al
ways unlocked for a 2 a.m. frisbee initiation
or an isolated study. It's where I watched
movies at all hours of the night on the big.
classroom pull-down screens with room
mates. friends from home, and boys I liked.
Scattered around the southern half of
campus are the glittering, oh-so-immacu
late emerald jewels of the golf course,
where, after completing Beginning Golf, a
friend and 1 played the back nine during the
Student Twilight tec time. We never got
close to par, lost four balls each, had to walk

two holes because we were backing up the
course, and took so long the sprinklers
doused us at Hole 17 (we valiantly played
though, nonetheless.)
Presiding over the green grass and red
roofs is Hoover Tower, in all of its phallic
magnificence. I sometimes still call the
tower "Banana Pancake," which, after
completing a re-naming, escape-those-lin
guistic-limitations exercise in Mechanical
Engineering 101, our teacher revealed had
been her long-time alternate name for the
building.
And there was Mirrielees, looking like a
flattened tripod, where 1 live now, as I finish
my. yes, fifth and final year of undergrad. It
is where I tried to do everything I hadn't in
the first four, where every day I get more
nostalgic and sad about what I have here
and what I am leaving behind. It is where
my voice. I think, has become the most
strong and clear. And it is where, in two

short weeks. I will drive away from half a
decade of the great times, long nights, and
tremendous people.
But as I landed down in SFO, Ill admit a
little misty-eyed. I realized that my time
here at this marvel of resort, where I have
been pathetically spoiled and allowed
every opportunity, has provided nie with
my own all-too-high, bendy board from
which I am ready to dive headlong into all
the rest that is to come.

After traveling to China to see her freshman
roommate play in the Olympics, Katie will he
living in Tahoe next year working as a ski pa
troller. Fell her when you are coming to visit at
