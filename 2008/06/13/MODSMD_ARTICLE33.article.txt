## Lament of the hairless

Women, I have been told, do not
like beards. Their coarse hairs,
women say, grate against soft femi
nine features.Their dense but shape
less growth obscures the clean angle
of the jawline. They remind the fair
er sex of the Civil War era, when men
in blue and gray rags and oddly
squashed hats proudly sported mut
tonchops along with their necrosis
and chose to kill each other in horri
ble. unsanitary ways rather than stay
at home and discuss agriculture.
Women themselves tell me this, and
yet 1 see women hanging on the arms
of scruffy indie chaff tossed from the
Great American Music Hall mill,
running their fingers through
Shenandoahs straight off a Thomas
Nast Democrat.
When 1 confront them, they deny
it. It was not a beard they were touch
ing. they tell me, but rather a mere
five o'clock shadow, some forgivable
evidence of hurriedness or apathy
earlier in the day. Ha ha ha. they say,
hoping to perhaps defuse my sense of
despair. Ha ha, I reply, necessarily.
These women mean well. But the oc
casional subtle twitch of their eyes to
ward the fine, translucent down that
dots my upper lip betrays their true
mot i ve. Th ey a re, I ha ve fo u nd. si m ply
consoling me over my personal in
ability to grow a beard.
In the beautiful rnichoacana town
of La Quemada, a child once in
formed me that I would look good in

a mustache. She was a young, ab
surdly cute and vaguely murine girl
who found my name impossible to
pronounce and ceaselessly carried
with her a handbag whose sole con
tent was another handbag shaped
like a rat. 1 stated that, yes, I was in
agreement with her assessment.
Irene's father had a mustache - a glo
riously black Franz Joseph that
swept easily across his jowls - as did
a substantial portion of the men in
the town, and my response was par
tially an effort not to alienate this
demographic. I did, however, feel
strongly that 1 really would look
good in a mustache. I hoped that it
would come as part of a larger
beard-and-sideburns combination
platter, but at that point in my devel
opment 1 would have happily settled
for a simple Nietzschean brush.
Then I should grow one, she in
sisted. Yes, I repeated, but I was very
busy at the moment with work, too
busy to devote time and energy to
hair growth. She was not convinced.
Why don't I just go ahead and do it?
What was I doing right now? 1 was
writing an educational song about
diarrhea, but 1 didn't want to just
come right out and say so.
Look. I told her. bending slowly
to her dwarfish altitude like an enor
mous gringo heron. 1 cannot grow a
mustache. 1 would like to, but heav
en continues to ignore my petitions.
It is like a Greek tragedy. 1 said. A
Greek tragedy about a beard.
She took the news in the noncha
lant way that children sometimes do,
where it is unclear that they even
grasp the enormity of the confession

made to them. Irene bobbed her
head and ran away to draw flowers
on sheets of graph paper loaned her
by the older children. But her re
spect for me was clearly diminished.
Though she still shared candy with
me and offered timid gifts of col
ored-pencil self-portraits, in her gen
erosity was the spirit of charity. Pity
for my incompleteness informed her
later interactions with me, and the
last I would see of her was as the
brief flutter of a summer dress the
night before 1 left the country, danc
ing in her peripatetic way with three
older brothers whose faces already
advertised a swell of testosterone.
See,facial hair ideally inspires re
spect and fear, beards being signs of
virility. My eternal pubescence, how
ever. has never done more than pro
duce a slight prismatic sheen when
exposed to direct light, light that
both bends and emasculates as it
passes through the pale blond folli
cles. This has been spun as a good

thing. It means 1 shave about as
often as I do laundry. Nevertheless,
there remains that solid substrate of
shame that the callow or naive occa
sionally expose in me.
Maybe extrapolation from the
unconscious attitude shift of a six
year-old is not the most reasonable
foundation for a lifetime of insecuri
ty. There are some females who, at
their very core, prefer the embar
rassing baby-faced nakedness I ex
hibit. But it seems to me that these
women are misinformed.Those hip
sters with iron filings on their
cheeks, the ancient Norwegians
soaked in the smell of cod and two
strokes, Ulysses S. Grant, they are
the advantaged here, with their faces
warmed and their sexual prowess on
display. I must stay in the shadows, a
resentful eunuch waiting for the day
his hormones will finally toggle on
and transform him into the hirsute
beast nature must have intended.
Necessarily.
