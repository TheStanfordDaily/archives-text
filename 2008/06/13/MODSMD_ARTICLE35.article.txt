INTERMISSION: How did your
idea for Post Secret originally come
about?
FRANK WARREN: I always felt
like people had these rich, imagina
tive lives that they did not get to
share. Everyone has some extraordi
nary stories. 1 wanted to create a
safe, non-judgmental place to ex
press and share these desires and
feelings and hopes and fears so that
it could be something special. When
1 started Post Secret, 1 was thrilled
with the results. It seemed to have
resonated with a lot of people. We
now have 100 million hits on the
blog. It's gratifying for me to see that
other people in addition to me ap
preciate the humor, poetry and hu
manity revealed in this project.
It's very inspirational that new
kinds of technology can create the
potential for new kinds of conversa
tion. Virtual communities are form
ing — the birth of Facebook, for ex
ample. Artists and entrepreneurs
will have the potential to create
wonderful projects that can unite us
and explore humanity. Post Secret is
just the first of many projects that
will be exciting for all of us to see.
INT: How has Post Secret changed
since it first started?
FW: When I started, I was inspired by
Davy Rothbart. Readers would mail
him stuff they find. He has a lot of
comments and editorials on his finds. I
tried doing that at first but understood
the power and poignancy of Post S
ecret, the voices speaking through the
postcards. I decided to eliminate
everything except for the postcards. 1
contribute very little to the site, and
there are no advertisements. I develop
a relationship with strangers, but I am
not going to judge it.
INT: What effect do you think the
Post Secret project has had on col
lege students specifically? How
have college students responded to
Post Secret?
FW: One might find a secret that hits
close to home. When people make
that connection, it can have a deep
emotional affect on someone. One
realizes on an emotional level that
everyone has his own burden. Al
lows you to feel less alone,more con
nected.
INT Is there a single one secret that
has specifically affected you?
FW: One I posted last week:"l go to
spinning class..." Just kidding. I like
the secrets that are funny and hope
ful.There was one written on a Star
bucks cup — "I give decaf to cus
tomers who are rude to me." Along
with the humorous, I like the haunt
ing. One about the 7Win Towers —
"Everyone who knew me before 9-
11 believes 1 am dead." It opens up a
whole world — imagine the story
behind it. Perhaps we bumped into
that person today.
INT How often do people contact
you asking if a certain secret was
sent in by someone they know? And

how often do you tell them?
FW: I always protect everybody's
identities. Sometimes I am bom
barded with 20-30 emails — they all
think they know who mailed it in. It
makes our lives more interesting to
imagine it could have been someone
we knew.
INT: What do you think is the direc
tion of Post Secret? Do you think it is
going to grow into something larg
er?
FW: I don't know. 1 don't try and
lead the project, but be sensitive to
it. 1 have been trusting the journey so
far. It's been leading me on an amaz
ing adventure, [and I] continue to
trust it to lead me.
It would be interesting to explore
other ways of storytelling. Film,
movies — there's been some discus
sion about that. We're still in discus
sion about a documentary.
INT: If everyone were to send in
their secrets, how would society be
different?
FW: In two or three more weeks —
we will have exchausted all the se
crets in the world. [Laughs] All of us
have too many secrets. Some secrets
are best not to tell other people
about.
INT: The larger media has certainly
picked up on this Post Secret phe
nomenon. What is the attitude of
mainsteam outlets to Post Secret?
FW: You understand what it is,so it's
hard to think about what it was like
when new. The idea is pretty novel,
and there's many ways to approach
it. Some may think it's about
pornography, crimes, self-indul
gence, narcissism. You need to see
the postcards to understand the
project. Then, they have a connec
tion to it. It's human-affirming,
poignant. It's art, as well as humor,
poetry, drama.
INT You have a lot of holiday-spe
cific weeks, for days like Valentine's
and Christmas. How are those dif
ferent?
FW: Depending on the cards I show
on the website, they will act as model
for the cards submitted in the next
week. Holiday-themed postings will
lead to more holiday secrets. Secrets
are more than individual voices, but
a conversation. Like with the new
book, I tried to arrange the secrets in
loose age order. It shows the fasci
nating way our secrets change as we
move through our lives. But also,
surprisingly, how they stay the same.
INT What is the selection criteria
for choosing the cards to publish?
FW: Cards that really speak to me,or
are surprising. One that everyone
can relate to in a new way. Relate to
every part of our emotions — funny,
shocking, hopeful, sexual. I try to
arrange them in a way that is con
nected. I am trying to be a storyteller
by telling a story about our secrets.
There are two kinds of secrets —
qnes that we keep from others, ones
that we hide from ourselves. We can
find the opportunity to find secrets
we are hiding from ourselves.
