Thank you, Jim Harbaugh.
Thank you, Tavita Pritchard,
Mark Bradford and Richard
Sherman. Thank you, Clinton Snyder,
Nick Sanchez and everyone else in a
Cardinal uniform who played hurt.
Thank you to every last individual
who set foot on that Trojan field at the
Coliseum to snap Southern Cal's 35-
game home win streak.
Thank you, because that was more
than just a win to restore some hope in
a moribund program. It was so much
more than Stanford football rising up
in perhaps the biggest upset in college
football history to defeat USC, 24-23.
It was more than a 41-point underdog
toppling the No. 2 team in the nation.
Because Saturday's win didn't just sig
nal the rebirth of a football program.
It signaled the rebirth of an entire
community. The rebirth of a college
sports scene that has been near-dead
for the last three years.
And the really encouraging part?
It didn't seem to take anyone that long
to figure out just how amazing it real
ly was.
From my personal experience of
the night that will be forever remem
bered by thousands of Stanford
coaches, players, fans, administrators,
students and alumni, the reaction all
had a strangely natural feel to it. Al
though this year's seniors had never
had anything quite like this to respond
to, and the seniors who graduated four
years ago wouldn't have either,every
one seemed to know exactly what to
do.
For myself and a handful of friends,
that meant circling campus in a '90s
model Subaru, honking like mad and
screaming to anyone who would listen
that USC's perfect season was toast.
We took it upon ourselves to be her
alds of a victory hardly anyone saw,
thanks to its appearance on a televi
sion network many didn't even know
existed.
I'm told it meant a bonfire in the
center of the Quad. As the event was
n't University-sanctioned, I. of course,
can't personally speak to the veracity
of those accounts. Apparently, howev
er, there were plenty of "R.I. P. U-S-C"
chants, as well as some more colorful
comments that will have to be omitted
from this column. I have it from a good
source, though, that when officials
asked who had started the fire, the
overwhelming student response was
"Pete Carroll."
Song ensued.
From the moment the game was
won on Bradford's sensational touch
down grab to the surreal arrival of the
team at Maples Pavilion, it truly did
seem as if Stanford's campus was
transformed from its traditional, quiet
self to a real honest-to-goodness Pac
-10 university.
And — surprise — it turns out
that's exactly what this place really is.
One current senior summed up the
emotions of the night following the al
leged bonfire event in the alleged
Quad.
"It was awesome," said Mike
Krieger '08. "You know they say we
don't have school spirit, but you know,
we might be fair weather fans, but
right now the weather is good and
we're partying it up."
While it may be a bit selfish, I'd also
like to thank Harbaugh and his play
ers and coaches for giving your faith
ful Daily staffers something positive
to write about for a change. Hopefully,
that change lasts for more than one
week.
Because while this was just one win
on the stat sheet, it was so much more
for the Stanford community. And in
the Cardinal locker room, it has to
have been even more.
This is the kind of win that pro
grams can build on.
From Harbaugh's discovery of "an
other warrior" in quarterback Tavita
Pritchard — who will get the start Sat
urday against TCU —to the emer
gence of a tenacious defense, Stanford
football regained its soul on Saturday.
Let's all hope energy like that is
exactly what the doctor ordered for
the Cardinal, and for the campus in
general. I,at least, have a good feeling
that it is.
