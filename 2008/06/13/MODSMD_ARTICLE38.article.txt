## No. 11 Cardinal sweeps No. 6 Cal State Fukjlllerton in Super Regional 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After battling through a tense Re
gional two weeks ago, the Cardinal
dominated Cal State Fullerton in the
Super Regional round of the NCAA
Championships last weekend. Stan
ford never trailed in its two-game
sweep over the Titans, punching its
ticket to its first College World Series
since 2003 at the annual site of
Omaha. Neb.
The series showcased the con
trasting styles of a pair of the West
Coast's top teams.The Cardinal took
to the road to take on the Titans in
their home park in Fullerton, and
had to contend with the speed of
their lineup which seemed to put
plenty of pressure on Stanford's de
fense. But the big bats of the Cardi
nal ultimately prevailed in both con
tests.
"I have a lot of respect for Fuller
ton," Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said following the series win. "We
like to play them every year. If you
don't know how to play the game,
they will embarrass you."
The Cardinal, though, proved that
it did know how to play the game in
toppling the Titans to advance to
Omaha; Stanford was the second
lowest ranked team of the eight
which earned a bid to the College
World Series.
Game 1: Stanford 4, Fullerton 3
Friday's win featured the next
step in the return of Stanford's pre
season and early season staff ace. Je
remy Bleich, as the junior lefty's
nabbed his first win since Feb. 29
(which also came over the Titans).
Bleich showed excellent control in
allowing just three hits and two walks
through six innings while striking out
five.
The Cardinal collected its runs
early, scoring all four runs through
the first six innings. Junior first base
man Brent Milleville collected an
RBI single in the first, driving home
junior leftfielder Joey August who
walked and advanced to second on a
groundout. When August doubled in
the fifth inning, he was again driven
in, this time by junior Jason Castro's
two-run shot to left center. Stanford
rounded out its scoring for the day in
the sixth when junior centerfielder
Sean Ratliff led off the inning with a
solo shot to center.
