## No. 11 Cardinal sweeps No. 6 Cal State Fukjlllerton in Super Regional 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
After battling through a tense Re
gional two weeks ago, the Cardinal
dominated Cal State Fullerton in the
Super Regional round of the NCAA
Championships last weekend. Stan
ford never trailed in its two-game
sweep over the Titans, punching its
ticket to its first College World Series
since 2003 at the annual site of
Omaha. Neb.
The series showcased the con
trasting styles of a pair of the West
Coast's top teams.The Cardinal took
to the road to take on the Titans in
their home park in Fullerton, and
had to contend with the speed of
their lineup which seemed to put
plenty of pressure on Stanford's de
fense. But the big bats of the Cardi
nal ultimately prevailed in both con
tests.
"I have a lot of respect for Fuller
ton," Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said following the series win. "We
like to play them every year. If you
don't know how to play the game,
they will embarrass you."
The Cardinal, though, proved that
it did know how to play the game in
toppling the Titans to advance to
Omaha; Stanford was the second
lowest ranked team of the eight
which earned a bid to the College
World Series.
Game 1: Stanford 4, Fullerton 3
Friday's win featured the next
step in the return of Stanford's pre
season and early season staff ace. Je
remy Bleich, as the junior lefty's
nabbed his first win since Feb. 29
(which also came over the Titans).
Bleich showed excellent control in
allowing just three hits and two walks
through six innings while striking out
five.
The Cardinal collected its runs
early, scoring all four runs through
the first six innings. Junior first base
man Brent Milleville collected an
RBI single in the first, driving home
junior leftfielder Joey August who
walked and advanced to second on a
groundout. When August doubled in
the fifth inning, he was again driven
in, this time by junior Jason Castro's
two-run shot to left center. Stanford
rounded out its scoring for the day in
the sixth when junior centerfielder
Sean Ratliff led off the inning with a
solo shot to center.

fifth with a bunt single, advanced to
second on a throwing error and
scored on Joel Weeks' single for an
unearned run — the only offense the
Titans were able to muster with Ble

Sophomore Jeff lnman came on

a two-run shot from its biggest threat

the game in the ninth with one out
and a runner on second to close out
the game for the Cardinal, setting up
an elimination game for Fullerton in
Saturday's second game of the Super
Regional.
Game 2: Stanford 8, Fullerton 5
Senior Erik Davis got the start for
the Cardinal, but lasted just two and
a third innings before being pulled in
favor of junior Austin Yount, who
pitched five and a third innings in re
lief of Davis for the win. But it was a
clutch three-run hit in the sixth that
won the game for the Cardinal, as
Castro went the opposite way with
two outs, smacking a double off the
left field wall.

State
Stanford's first opponent in Omaha will be
a team that on the surface would seem to have
plenty in common with the Cardinal. The
Seminoles are batting an impressive .354 as a
team and have scored 653 runs in 66 games,
compared to Stanford's 469 in 63.
Moreover, both squads are led offensively
by probably the best college catchers in the
country. Florida State's Buster Posey is batting

.460 with an impressive 26 homeruns on the
year. Posey was selected fifth overall in the re
cent MLB First Year Player Draft by the San
Francisco Giants, while Castro was the second
college catcher selected when he went tenth to
the Houston Astros.
Stanford was the lone Tac-lO squad to
make it to Omaha, after Arizona and Arizona
State fell in the Super Regionals to Miami and
Fresno State, respectively. Only Fresno State
of the remaining eight-team field was ranked
lower than the Cardinal in the most recent
major national polls, as the Cardinal is behind
the Seminoles, North Carolina, LSU, Miami,
Rice and Georgia in the each of the Baseball
America, Collegiate Baseball and ESPN/USA
Today rankings. The former two had Stanford
ranked at No. 16 while the latter ranked the
Cardinal 18th in the nation.
Still. Stanford is no stranger to long odds, as
Fullerton was ranked sixth, 11 th, and eighth in
the respective polls.
The action in Omaha heats up for the Car
dinal starting at 11 a.m. PT on Saturday. De
pending upon the outcome of the opening
round matchups,Stanford will then face either
Miami or Georgia on Monday.

Stanford's first opponent in Omaha will be
a team that on the surface would seem to have
plenty in common with the Cardinal. The
Seminoles are batting an impressive .354 as a
team and have scored 653 runs in 66 games,
compared to Stanford's 469 in 63.
Moreover, both squads are led offensively
by probably the best college catchers in the
country. Florida State's Buster Posey is batting

.460 with an impressive 26 homeruns on the
year. Posey was selected fifth overall in the re
cent MLB First Year Player Draft by the San
Francisco Giants, while Castro was the second
college catcher selected when he went tenth to
the Houston Astros.
Stanford was the lone Tac-lO squad to
make it to Omaha, after Arizona and Arizona
State fell in the Super Regionals to Miami and
Fresno State, respectively. Only Fresno State
of the remaining eight-team field was ranked
lower than the Cardinal in the most recent
major national polls, as the Cardinal is behind
the Seminoles, North Carolina, LSU, Miami,
Rice and Georgia in the each of the Baseball
America, Collegiate Baseball and ESPN/USA
Today rankings. The former two had Stanford
ranked at No. 16 while the latter ranked the
Cardinal 18th in the nation.
Still. Stanford is no stranger to long odds, as
Fullerton was ranked sixth, 11 th, and eighth in
the respective polls.
The action in Omaha heats up for the Car
dinal starting at 11 a.m. PT on Saturday. De
pending upon the outcome of the opening
round matchups,Stanford will then face either
Miami or Georgia on Monday.

After battling through a tense Re
gional two weeks ago, the Cardinal
dominated Cal State Fullerton in the
Super Regional round of the NCAA
Championships last weekend. Stan
ford never trailed in its two-game
sweep over the Titans, punching its
ticket to its first College World Series
since 2003 at the annual site of
Omaha. Neb.
The series showcased the con
trasting styles of a pair of the West
Coast's top teams.The Cardinal took
to the road to take on the Titans in
their home park in Fullerton, and
had to contend with the speed of
their lineup which seemed to put
plenty of pressure on Stanford's de
fense. But the big bats of the Cardi
nal ultimately prevailed in both con
tests.
"I have a lot of respect for Fuller
ton," Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said following the series win. "We
like to play them every year. If you
don't know how to play the game,
they will embarrass you."
The Cardinal, though, proved that
it did know how to play the game in
toppling the Titans to advance to
Omaha; Stanford was the second
lowest ranked team of the eight
which earned a bid to the College
World Series.
Game 1: Stanford 4, Fullerton 3
Friday's win featured the next
step in the return of Stanford's pre
season and early season staff ace. Je
remy Bleich, as the junior lefty's
nabbed his first win since Feb. 29
(which also came over the Titans).
Bleich showed excellent control in
allowing just three hits and two walks
through six innings while striking out
five.
The Cardinal collected its runs
early, scoring all four runs through
the first six innings. Junior first base
man Brent Milleville collected an
RBI single in the first, driving home
junior leftfielder Joey August who
walked and advanced to second on a
groundout. When August doubled in
the fifth inning, he was again driven
in, this time by junior Jason Castro's
two-run shot to left center. Stanford
rounded out its scoring for the day in
the sixth when junior centerfielder
Sean Ratliff led off the inning with a
solo shot to center.
