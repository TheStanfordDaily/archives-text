No one could have seen this coming.
In what some are calling the biggest
upset in the history of college football, 41-
point underdog Stanford toppled second
ranked Southern California on Saturday
night, going into the hostile Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum to shock one of the na
tion's most storied programs, 24-23.
Redshirt sophomore Tavita Pritchard,
making his first career start, lofted a 10-
yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on
fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds remaining
to give the Cardinal its first lead of the
game. Bo McNally's fourth-down intercep
tion of USC quarterback John David
Booty on the ensuing possession sealed
one of the biggest wins in Stanford football
history and gave head coach Jim Harbaugh
his first Pac-10 victory.
The win was Stanford's first against the
Trojans since Sept. 29,2001, which was also
the last time USC lost at home to any oppo
nent. The Cardinal victory snapped the
Trojans' 35-game home winning streak —
the nation's longest — and gave USC head
coach Pete Carroll only his third home loss
since he arrived in L.A. six years ago.
The Cardinal (2-3,1-3 Pac-10) defeated
the TVojans (4-1,2-1 Pac-10) despite being
outgained 459-235. Booty threw four inter
ceptions — including one that was re

turned for a touchdown and another that
set up the winning score — and junior de
fensive end Pannel Eghoh blocked what
turned out to be a decisive extra point.
Stanford forced five USC turnovers while
committing only one, and executed master
fully down the stretch, including two
fourth-and-long conversions on the final
drive.
"I give all the credit to the Stanford
football players," Harbaugh said after the
win. "They played like their lives depended
on it. They played smart; they played
sound. They just won it."
Harbaugh began hyping this game in
the spring, when he openly speculated that
Carroll might leave SC for the NFL after
this season. When Carroll called out the
outspoken Stanford coach, Harbaugh re
fused to back down.
"We bow to no man," Harbaugh said de
fiantly to the media at the time."We bow to
no program at Stanford University."
Southern California, winner of 24
straight home Pac-10 contests, wilted
under the emotional fire of a Stanford de
fense missing its starting nose tackle and
playing two of its best defenders with
chronic injuries.
USC — which came into the game
ranked second in the Associated Press poll
and first in the coaches' poll — had played
tentatively all season, lacking explosive
playmaking and playing mistake-prone

Senior Mark Bradford's fourth-and-goal touchdown catch will go down as one of the greatest plays in
Stanford football history. The Cardinal, a 41-point underdog, shocked the world of college football
after its 24-23 victory over the Trojans on Oct. 6.
