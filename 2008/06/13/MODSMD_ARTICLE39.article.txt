In what some are calling the biggest
upset in the history of college football, 41-
point underdog Stanford toppled second
ranked Southern California on Saturday
night, going into the hostile Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum to shock one of the na
tion's most storied programs, 24-23.
Redshirt sophomore Tavita Pritchard,
making his first career start, lofted a 10-
yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on
fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds remaining
to give the Cardinal its first lead of the
game. Bo McNally's fourth-down intercep
tion of USC quarterback John David
Booty on the ensuing possession sealed
one of the biggest wins in Stanford football
history and gave head coach Jim Harbaugh
his first Pac-10 victory.
The win was Stanford's first against the
Trojans since Sept. 29,2001, which was also
the last time USC lost at home to any oppo
nent. The Cardinal victory snapped the
Trojans' 35-game home winning streak —
the nation's longest — and gave USC head
coach Pete Carroll only his third home loss
since he arrived in L.A. six years ago.
The Cardinal (2-3,1-3 Pac-10) defeated
the TVojans (4-1,2-1 Pac-10) despite being
outgained 459-235. Booty threw four inter
ceptions — including one that was re

turned for a touchdown and another that
set up the winning score — and junior de
fensive end Pannel Eghoh blocked what
turned out to be a decisive extra point.
Stanford forced five USC turnovers while
committing only one, and executed master
fully down the stretch, including two
fourth-and-long conversions on the final
drive.
"I give all the credit to the Stanford
football players," Harbaugh said after the
win. "They played like their lives depended
on it. They played smart; they played
sound. They just won it."
Harbaugh began hyping this game in
the spring, when he openly speculated that
Carroll might leave SC for the NFL after
this season. When Carroll called out the
outspoken Stanford coach, Harbaugh re
fused to back down.
"We bow to no man," Harbaugh said de
fiantly to the media at the time."We bow to
no program at Stanford University."
Southern California, winner of 24
straight home Pac-10 contests, wilted
under the emotional fire of a Stanford de
fense missing its starting nose tackle and
playing two of its best defenders with
chronic injuries.
USC — which came into the game
ranked second in the Associated Press poll
and first in the coaches' poll — had played
tentatively all season, lacking explosive
playmaking and playing mistake-prone

Senior Mark Bradford's fourth-and-goal touchdown catch will go down as one of the greatest plays in
Stanford football history. The Cardinal, a 41-point underdog, shocked the world of college football
after its 24-23 victory over the Trojans on Oct. 6.
football in last week's 27-24 escape
at Washington.
A slew of injuries thinned theTro
jan roster, including several on the
offensive line and in the secondary.
Booty suffered a broken middle fin
ger on his throwing hand in the first
half, which may have contributed to
his costly bout with inaccuracy down
the stretch.
USC's running game, featuring a
stable of talented tailbacks, was held
to only 124 yards (not counting sack
yardage). The Trojans had averaged
over 240 rushing yards per game
coming in.
The Cardinal made USC pay for
every one of its second-half mis
takes, scoring 10 points on its final
two drives, both set up by intercep
tions.
After senior Derek Belch kicked
a 26-yard field goal with 5:43 on the
clock to cut the USC lead to 23-17,

the Cardinal defensive unit respond
ed with one of its best series of the
contest. A second-down sack by red
shirt sophomore Clinton Snyder was
followed by junior cornerback
Wopamo Osaisai's interception on
third-and-19, giving Stanford's of
fense the ball on the USC 45.
Pritchard led the Cardinal to the
USC 29-yard line, where Stanford
was faced with a do-or-die fourth
and-20 with under two minutes left
in the game.
The young quarterback, starting
in place of injured senior T.C. Os
trander, couldn't hear Harbaugh call
the play in over the noise of the
85,125-strong crowd and was forced
to make the call himself. The result
was a 20-yard completion to sopho
more wide receiver Richard Sher
man — who absorbed a huge hit as
he caught the pass — just inches be
yond the first down marker at the
USC 9-yard line.
"Coach [Harbaugh] called a play,
and 1 couldn't really hear him be
cause that place gets really loud, so I
called my own play," Pritchard said.
"I got the coverage I wanted and

found Sherm. Sherm did a great job
getting open on that, and I just hit
him."
After gaining five more yards on
a bootleg keeper, Pritchard threw
two incompletions intended for sen
ior wideout Evan Moore. On fourth
and-goal from the 5, Stanford was
penalized five yards for illegal substi
tution, a call that gave Pritchard
more space to toss the deciding fade
route to Bradford.
"It's one of those things, where I
knew the play was coming to me,"
said Bradford, a senior wideout who
is a Los Angeles native and missed
significant practice time the past two
weeks due to the death of his father.
"I see the ball in the air, and I'm just
thinking, 'I've got to make this
catch.'"
With USC fans screaming in his
ear, Pritchard calmly dropped back
into the pocket and lofted a perfect
fade pass into the left corner of the
end zone on fourth-and-goal from
the 10-yard line. Split out to the left,
Bradford gained outside position on
his defender, leapt into the air and
made an acrobatic catch, dragging

In what some are calling the biggest
upset in the history of college football, 41-
point underdog Stanford toppled second
ranked Southern California on Saturday
night, going into the hostile Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum to shock one of the na
tion's most storied programs, 24-23.
Redshirt sophomore Tavita Pritchard,
making his first career start, lofted a 10-
yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on
fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds remaining
to give the Cardinal its first lead of the
game. Bo McNally's fourth-down intercep
tion of USC quarterback John David
Booty on the ensuing possession sealed
one of the biggest wins in Stanford football
history and gave head coach Jim Harbaugh
his first Pac-10 victory.
The win was Stanford's first against the
Trojans since Sept. 29,2001, which was also
the last time USC lost at home to any oppo
nent. The Cardinal victory snapped the
Trojans' 35-game home winning streak —
the nation's longest — and gave USC head
coach Pete Carroll only his third home loss
since he arrived in L.A. six years ago.
The Cardinal (2-3,1-3 Pac-10) defeated
the TVojans (4-1,2-1 Pac-10) despite being
outgained 459-235. Booty threw four inter
ceptions — including one that was re

turned for a touchdown and another that
set up the winning score — and junior de
fensive end Pannel Eghoh blocked what
turned out to be a decisive extra point.
Stanford forced five USC turnovers while
committing only one, and executed master
fully down the stretch, including two
fourth-and-long conversions on the final
drive.
"I give all the credit to the Stanford
football players," Harbaugh said after the
win. "They played like their lives depended
on it. They played smart; they played
sound. They just won it."
Harbaugh began hyping this game in
the spring, when he openly speculated that
Carroll might leave SC for the NFL after
this season. When Carroll called out the
outspoken Stanford coach, Harbaugh re
fused to back down.
"We bow to no man," Harbaugh said de
fiantly to the media at the time."We bow to
no program at Stanford University."
Southern California, winner of 24
straight home Pac-10 contests, wilted
under the emotional fire of a Stanford de
fense missing its starting nose tackle and
playing two of its best defenders with

Senior Mark Bradford's fourth-and-goal touchdown catch will go down as one of the greatest plays in

A slew of injuries thinned theTro

offensive line and in the secondary.
Booty suffered a broken middle fin
ger on his throwing hand in the first
half, which may have contributed to
his costly bout with inaccuracy down
the stretch.
USC's running game, featuring a
stable of talented tailbacks, was held
to only 124 yards (not counting sack
yardage). The Trojans had averaged
over 240 rushing yards per game
coming in.
The Cardinal made USC pay for
every one of its second-half mis
takes, scoring 10 points on its final
two drives, both set up by intercep
tions.
After senior Derek Belch kicked
a 26-yard field goal with 5:43 on the
clock to cut the USC lead to 23-17,

the Cardinal defensive unit respond
ed with one of its best series of the
contest. A second-down sack by red
shirt sophomore Clinton Snyder was
followed by junior cornerback
Wopamo Osaisai's interception on
third-and-19, giving Stanford's of
fense the ball on the USC 45.
Pritchard led the Cardinal to the
USC 29-yard line, where Stanford
was faced with a do-or-die fourth
and-20 with under two minutes left
in the game.
The young quarterback, starting
in place of injured senior T.C. Os
trander, couldn't hear Harbaugh call
the play in over the noise of the
85,125-strong crowd and was forced
to make the call himself. The result
was a 20-yard completion to sopho

he caught the pass — just inches be

USC 9-yard line.
