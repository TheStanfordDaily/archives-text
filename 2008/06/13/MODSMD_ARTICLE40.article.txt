Thank you. Jim Harbaugh. Thank
you, Tavita Pritchard. Mark Brad
ford and Richard Sherman. Thank
you, Clinton Snyder, Nick Sanchez
and everyone else in a Cardinal uni
form who played hurt. Thank you to
every last individual who set foot on
that Trojan field at the Coliseum to
snap Southern Cal's 35-game home
win streak.
Thank you. because that was
more than just a win to restore some
hope in a moribund program. It was
so much more than Stanford football
rising up in perhaps the biggest upset
in college football history to defeat
USC, 24-23. It was more than a 41-
point underdog toppling the No. 2
team in the nation. Because Satur
day's win didn't just signal the re
birth of a football program.
It signaled the rebirth of an entire
community. The rebirth of a college
sports scene that has been near-dead
for the last three years.
And the really encouraging part?
It didn't seem to take anyone that
long to figure out just how amazing it
really was.
From my personal experience of
the night that will be forever remem
bered by thousands of Stanford
coaches, players, fans, administrators,
students and alumni, the reaction all
had a strangely natural feel to it. Al
though this year's seniors had never
had anything quite like this to re
spond to. and the seniors who gradu
ated four years ago wouldn't have ei
ther, everyone seemed to know ex
actly what to do.
For myself and a handful of
friends, that meant circling campus in
a '90s model Subaru, honking like
mad and screaming to anyone who
would listen that USC's perfect sea
son was toast. We took it upon our
selves to be heralds of a victory hard
ly anyone saw, thanks to its appear-


ALVIN CHOW/The Stanford Daily
Students and players celebrate with the Stanford Axe on the football field after the Cardinal's thrilling 20-13 victory over Cal in the Big Game on Dec. 1. The win in the 1 10th edition of the rivalry game
was Stanford's first since 2001 and improved Stanford's record this year to 4-8 overall and 3-6 in the Pac-10.
ance on a television network many
didn't even know existed.
I'm told it meant a bonfire in the
center of the Quad. As the event was
n't University-sanctioned, I, of
course, can't personally speak to the
veracity of those accounts. Appar
ently. however, there were plenty of
"R.I.P. U-S-C" chants, as well as
some more colorful comments that
will have to be omitted from this col
umn. I have it from a good source,
though, that when officials asked
who had started the fire, the over
whelming student response was
"Pete Carroll."
Song ensued.
From the moment the game was
won on Bradford's sensational
touchdown grab to the surreal arrival
of the team at Maples Pavilion, it
truly did seem as if Stanford's cam

pus was transformed from its tradi
tional. quiet self to a real honest-to
goodness Pac-10 university.
And — surprise —it turns out
that's exactly what this place really is.
One current senior summed up
the emotions of the night following
the alleged bonfire event in the al
leged Quad.
"It was awesome," said Mike
Krieger '08. "You know they say we
don't have school spirit, but you
know, we might be fair weather fans,
but right now the weather is good
and we're partying it up."
While it may be a bit selfish, I'd
also like to thank Harbaugh and his
players and coaches for giving your
faithful Daily staffers something pos
itive to write about for a change.
Hopefully, that change lasts for more
than one week.

Because while this was just one
win on the stat sheet, it was so much
more for the Stanford community.
And in the Cardinal locker room, it
has to have been even more.
This is the kind of win that pro
grams can build on.
From Harbaugh's discovery of
"another warrior" in quarterback
Tavita Pritchard — who will get the
start Saturday against TCU — to the
emergence of a tenacious defense.
Stanford football regained its soul on
Saturday.
Let's all hope energy like that is
exactly what the doctor ordered for
the Cardinal, and for the campus in
general. I, at least, have a good feel
ing that it is.
