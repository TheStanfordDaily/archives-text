Thank you. Jim Harbaugh. Thank
you, Tavita Pritchard. Mark Brad
ford and Richard Sherman. Thank
you, Clinton Snyder, Nick Sanchez
and everyone else in a Cardinal uni
form who played hurt. Thank you to
every last individual who set foot on
that Trojan field at the Coliseum to
snap Southern Cal's 35-game home
win streak.
Thank you. because that was
more than just a win to restore some

It signaled the rebirth of an entire
community. The rebirth of a college
sports scene that has been near-dead
for the last three years.
And the really encouraging part?
It didn't seem to take anyone that
long to figure out just how amazing it
really was.
From my personal experience of
the night that will be forever remem
bered by thousands of Stanford
coaches, players, fans, administrators,
students and alumni, the reaction all
had a strangely natural feel to it. Al
though this year's seniors had never
had anything quite like this to re
spond to. and the seniors who gradu
ated four years ago wouldn't have ei
ther, everyone seemed to know ex
actly what to do.
For myself and a handful of
friends, that meant circling campus in
a '90s model Subaru, honking like
mad and screaming to anyone who
would listen that USC's perfect sea
son was toast. We took it upon our
selves to be heralds of a victory hard
ly anyone saw, thanks to its appear-
