In four of the past five years, the Stan
ford women's basketball team got to the
national quarterfinals, only to fall short of
the promised land, the Final Four. Two
years ago, LSU crushed the Cardinal's
hopes in the final minute. The year before
that, Michigan State eked out a nail-biter
over Stanford.
In 2008.Candice Wiggins and the Cardi
nal left no doubt, pulling away from one
seed Maryland in the middle of the game
and coasting through to the final buzzer to
a 98-87 victory. It marked the Cardinal's
first Final Four appearance since 19 C >7.
"What can I say about Candice," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said
after the game. "She is a great player, steps
up in big games, and she really stepped up
for our team."
Wiggins, the Spokane Regional MVP.
scored 41 points in the game to lead all
players. Sophomore guard JJ Hones and
freshman forward Kayla Pedersen put in
superb performances for Stanford, as well.
Hones hit four three-pointers en route to
scoring 23 points, a career-high: Pedersen
chipped in 15 points and 7 assists while
playing all 40 minutes alongside Wiggins
and Hones.
The Cardinal (34-3) and the Terrapins
(33-4) both opened up hot, hitting virtually
everything on the way to making it a 10-9
Maryland game by the first TV timeout
four minutes in. Stanford threatened to
pull away several times in the first half, but
in each instance was reined in by the Ter
rapins, who shot 54.1 percent on the game.
Stanford offset Maryland's hot shooting
with some pinpoint accuracy of its own. hit
ting an eye-popping 14-for-28 from three
point range. After the Terrapins caught up
with a Stanford run yet again, closing to
within three at 41-38 with just over two
minutes to go in the first half, the Cardinal
used two of those three-pointers — a rare
bomb from Pedersen, who was 3-for-3 from
long distance, and a trey from Hones — to
put Maryland in the rear-view mirror, 51-
41, at the half.
"I know that they shot well," Van-
Derveer said, "but we were shooting really
well from three. We were getting some
good shots, and they were really working
hard for their shots."
The Terps closed the gap to just 6 points
early in the second period, as Kristy Tolliv
er — who hit Maryland's famous game
tying three-pointer in the national champi
onship two years ago — had a layup and a
three within the first five minutes. But even
Tolliver, who led Maryland with 35 points,
was powerless to stop the three-headed
monster that has driven the Cardinal's of
fense all year long.
Stanford scored on five of its next seven
possessions, including a layup and a three
point play from Pedersen. a three from
Wiggins and two baskets from sophomore
center Jayne Appel, who finished with 11
points and 9 rebounds.
This put Stanford ahead 69-56, as Mary

land missed a flurry of layups and short
jump shots under pressure from Appel and
Pedersen. Wiggins tacked four more points
on with 11 minutes to go. and the Cardinal
led by as much as 17 with the half winding
down.
"Tara looked at me [during a timeout]
and said, whenever you get a shot, just take
it." a bubbling Wiggins said in the post
game press conference.
Maryland may have made a few Stan
ford fans nervous with a run that brought
the Terps within 7 points with six minutes

left, but Wiggins answered Polliver's three
with a three of her own to give Stanford a
double-digit cushion, and Hones hit a
three-pointer and a layup to preserve the
margin and send Maryland into fouling
mode,
The Cardinal will play the winner of
today's Tennessee-Texas A&M game. The
Cardinal has already played Tennessee this
season, defeating the Volunteers 73-69 in
overtime at Maples Pavilion in December.
