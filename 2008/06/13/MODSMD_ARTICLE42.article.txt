At long last things are beginning to
get interesting again. With the
Final Four ahead, baseball season
underway, and the NFL Draft and NBA
Playoffs just around the corner, the sports
world seems to have finally escaped from
its late winter doldrums.

But newfound excitement and anticipa
tion is only a recent development, and has
arrived only at the expense of plenty of
twists, turns and turbulent upheavals that
certainly left me confused. Just one exam
ple: When 1 left for a ten-day trip with some
friends for spring break, the Houston
Rockets held the best record in the NBAs
Western Conference. Now? Hello, sixth
place.
And the amazing thing? That's about
the least surprising thing I've noticed in re
cent days. Suffice to say, it's been a crazy
couple of weeks. So without further ado, let
me present the First Annual (Belated)
April Fool's sports list — and if you could
n't guess, I'm definitely the fool here. But
I'm guessing I'm not alone.
Stanford hoops — So the men made the
Sweet 16. Fantastic. In any given year, that's
the kind of achievement Cardinal fans
everywhere can be proud of. The problem
is, as I see it, this wasn't any given year. It
was a minor miracle that Brook Lopez de
cided to return to the Farm for his sopho

more season, and a major miracle (and
proof that a divine being is a Stanford fan)
that a set of seven-foot twins qualified for
and wanted to attend Stanford.
Honestly, take a look around — oppor
tunities like that don't come up very often.
How many twin seven-footers has Duke
had? Kansas? North Carolina? UCLA?
Kentucky? You name the traditional bas
ketball powerhouse and they've probably
never been so lucky to essentially set up
their front-court with that kind of talent in
one fell swoop.
So the problem, as I see it, isn't that the
Cardinal was eliminated by Texas last
weekend, because being one of the top six
teen teams in the nation is quite an accom
plishment in itself. It's that if Stanford ever
had a chance to be truly dominant, this was
it. Anyone who watched the team all sea
son, though, could see that there was a fatal
flaw — there was no outside presence to
take pressure off the big men down low.
And now we'll always wonder what
could have been, as Brook and Robin get
set to earn their millions in the NBA. Put
UCLA's Darren Collison on the Cardinal
and it's in the National Championship
game, but Collison's so good you could
probably say that about a lot of teams.
April Fool's — It happens every year. I
wake up,forget what day it is, and am fooled
by one of literally dozens of fake news sto
ries about one of my favorite teams. This
year my befuddlemcnt came courtesy of a
phone call from my dad, who had heard on
