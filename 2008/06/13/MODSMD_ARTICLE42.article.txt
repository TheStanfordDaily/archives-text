At long last things are beginning to
get interesting again. With the
Final Four ahead, baseball season
underway, and the NFL Draft and NBA
Playoffs just around the corner, the sports
world seems to have finally escaped from
its late winter doldrums.

But newfound excitement and anticipa
tion is only a recent development, and has
arrived only at the expense of plenty of
twists, turns and turbulent upheavals that
certainly left me confused. Just one exam
ple: When 1 left for a ten-day trip with some
friends for spring break, the Houston
Rockets held the best record in the NBAs
Western Conference. Now? Hello, sixth
place.
And the amazing thing? That's about
the least surprising thing I've noticed in re
cent days. Suffice to say, it's been a crazy
couple of weeks. So without further ado, let
me present the First Annual (Belated)
April Fool's sports list — and if you could
n't guess, I'm definitely the fool here. But
I'm guessing I'm not alone.
Stanford hoops — So the men made the
Sweet 16. Fantastic. In any given year, that's
the kind of achievement Cardinal fans
everywhere can be proud of. The problem
is, as I see it, this wasn't any given year. It
was a minor miracle that Brook Lopez de
cided to return to the Farm for his sopho

more season, and a major miracle (and
proof that a divine being is a Stanford fan)
that a set of seven-foot twins qualified for
and wanted to attend Stanford.
Honestly, take a look around — oppor
tunities like that don't come up very often.
How many twin seven-footers has Duke
had? Kansas? North Carolina? UCLA?
Kentucky? You name the traditional bas
ketball powerhouse and they've probably
never been so lucky to essentially set up
their front-court with that kind of talent in
one fell swoop.
So the problem, as I see it, isn't that the
Cardinal was eliminated by Texas last
weekend, because being one of the top six
teen teams in the nation is quite an accom
plishment in itself. It's that if Stanford ever
had a chance to be truly dominant, this was
it. Anyone who watched the team all sea
son, though, could see that there was a fatal
flaw — there was no outside presence to
take pressure off the big men down low.
And now we'll always wonder what
could have been, as Brook and Robin get
set to earn their millions in the NBA. Put
UCLA's Darren Collison on the Cardinal
and it's in the National Championship
game, but Collison's so good you could
probably say that about a lot of teams.
April Fool's — It happens every year. I
wake up,forget what day it is, and am fooled
by one of literally dozens of fake news sto
ries about one of my favorite teams. This
year my befuddlemcnt came courtesy of a
phone call from my dad, who had heard on
Bay Area sports talk radio station
KNBR that the Giants had made a
trade with the Indians to acquire left
fielder Franklin Gutierrez.
Initially, the name sounded famil
iar. hut I didn't know much else. So I
looked up the stats and started to get
excited. ITien I read newspaper sto
ries about his spring training outings
and heroics in Cleveland's opening
day game against the White Sox. By
the time I figured out that the deal
was way too good to be true I'd al
ready cemented the idea of an excit
ing young hitter in San Francisco's
lineup (which would be a first this
decade) in my niind.'lTie gradual re

alization that the Giants' offense
would be just as horrifically un
watchable as ever probably made
this the most painful bamboozle
ment of all time, at least in the post-
Benedict Arnold era.
Matt Leinart, Party Animal —
Okay, not gonna lie, 1 don't actually
think anyone was fooled by this. But
how can 1 let a column slide by with
out mentioning the latest hot-tub
heroics of the former Throwin' Tro
jan? Frankly, the only things that sur
prised me were A) that this was con
sidered news-worthy and B) Leinart
is still considered a celebrity after
two entirely unremarkable seasons
with the down-and-out Arizona Car
dinals.
Jerry Jones wants "Pacman"
Jones for "America's Team" —
Again, not the biggest surprise in the
world. But at this point I'm just won

dering if Jerry has looked into the
availability of Lawrence Phillips yet.
The former Nebraska star, who faces
multiple charges of assault and basi
cally ended Steve Young's career in
1999 might make a fine addition to
the Cowboys backfield if Jerry could
only get him out of jail. Sure, he's get
ting a little long in the tooth, but
Phillips' off the field antics have
done enough to keep him off the
field that he's still got plenty of tread
on the tires. 1 know that I,for one, am
eagerly awaiting the day when Ter
rell Owens is considered the fran
chise's model citizen.

Would you like to petition Jerry Jones
to pursue as many convicts, malcon
tents, and all around good-guys as lie
possibly can find? Email Denis Grif
fin at djgriff@stanford.edu to join the
movement.
