Junior middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo shattered the Stanford
single-season hitting percentage
record and was named the 2007
AVCA Player of the Year the night

before Stanford's 3-2 loss in the
NCAA Final. She is currently train
ing with the USA National Team as
the Beijing Olympics approach.
Penn State (34-2) earned its sec
ond title in school history with the 30-
25,30-26,23-30,19-30,15-8 marathon
victory. Stanford ended its season at
32-3.
"Obviously Penn State is a great
team," head coach John Dunning
said in a postgame press conference.
"I'd really like to congratulate them.
1 thought they started the match ag
gressively. They got the advantage on
us early - I'm not exactly clear at this
point what happened. I'm proud of
our team after game two to come
back with the effort [that we did]."
Megan Hodge, the Nittany Lions'
star sophomore outside hitter, was
named Most Outstanding Player of
the tournament for her 26-kill per
formance in leading Penn State to its
first championship since a victory
over Stanford in the 1999 final.
For the Card, junior middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo - a First
Team All-American and the 2(X)7
AVCA National Player of the Year -
made only one hitting error and tied
freshman phenom Alix Klineman - a
Second Team All-American outside

hitter - with 18 kills in the final match.
Two Stanford seniors - setter
Bryn Kehoe and middle blocker
Franci Ciirard - saw their collegiate
careers come to an end in their third
championship match in four years on
the Farm.They leave Stanford with a
four-year record of 119-19.
"They're leaders on our team ,"
Dunning said of his seniors. "They're
captains on our team,they've been to
three Finals matches in their careers,
and they're just great people. They
have meant a lot to our program and
always will,and 1 am sure they will go
on to great things after this."
Kehoe leaves as the top setter in
Stanford history, with s,9s6career as
sists. She broke her own single-sea
son record as a senior with 1.742 and
is also in the all-time top 10 in aces
and digs.
Girard had her best offensive sea
son as a senior, with 261 kills and a
.317 hitting percentage. She came up
with key blocks in both the Cardi
nal's Regional Final win over No. 7
UCLA and an NCAA semifinal vic
tory over No. 3 USC.
Penn State, which had not lost
since a five-game thriller against
Stanford in September, had swept
every opponent coming into the final,
including No. 4 California in the semifi
nal.
The first game of the championship
was a close one, but Penn State scored
four of the last five points in the game
to win. 30-25.
The Nittany Lions built a small lead
part way through the second game and,
though the Cardinal came within two
points several times, the advantage
held. Penn State sealed the 30-26 win
with a block.
Facing a must-win situation in the
third game, Stanford came out firing
and stunned Penn State, which had
played near flawless volleyball the first
two games. Up 15-13 at the midpoint,
Kehoe served three aces in a row as
part of a five-point run that put the
game out of Penn State's reach. The
lead never dropped below four points,
as a Penn State service error gave the
Cardinal a 30-23 win.
With an opportunity to tie the
match in the fourth game, the Cardinal
powered through the frame, putting

down 23 kills without making a single
error. Akinradewo and junior outside
hitter Cynthia Barboza both notched
six kills on 10 swings in the game and
Girard put each of her live attempts on
the floor.Two straight ball-handling er
rors called on Penn State and an Akin
radewo kill ended the game 30-19 and
pushed the match to the decisive fifth
game.The final marked the first time a
championship match went the distance
since rally scoring was introduced in
2001.
In the last game, however, it was
Penn State with all the firepower and
Stanford struggled to get a kill.The Nit
tany Lions strung together six points in
a row to turn a 4-4 tie into a 10-4 lead
and junior right side hitter Erin Waller
got Stanford's only kill of the game at
13-8. Hodge finished out the match
with a kill to end the Cardinal's title
hopes.
"You know, it is such a momentum
oriented game," Dunning said. "1 think
we knocked them on their heels in
game three and they thought they
could recover and didn't in game four.
They just put their heart out on the
floor, they were ready to start in game
five.
"We all know that is what makes
volleyball amazing to watch and play,
because you get to that fifth game and
who knows what is going to happen.
It's just so exciting, they just did a great
job, they grabbed all the momentum
and it's hard to catch up when you get
down three or four points."
Behind Akinradewo and Kline
man's KS kills apiece, Barboza finished
with 16 and Girard had 10. Klineman
also anchored Stanford in the back row
with her 15 digs. Barboza chipped in 12
and freshman defensive specialists
Cassidy Lichtman and Gabi Ailes
added 10 each.
Along with her 62 assists. Kehoe
tied a career high with five aces and led

the Cardinal with seven total blocks.
Though the Nittany Lions were the
second-best blocking team in the na
tion coming in, Stanford won the
blocking battle 11-8.
Stanford and Penn State are the
only two teams to have participated in
all 27 NCAA Tournaments. Stanford
also holds the record for most Final
Four appearances (17). title match ap
pearances (13) and national champi
onships (6).
TTiis was the second straight year
the Cardinal lost in the title game. Stan
ford fell to Nebraska 3-1 in last year's
championship.
"1 think the goal going into next sea
son is to win the national champi
onship. as opposed to losing for the
third straight year," Barboza said after
the final. "That would be ideal. It is just
kind of a double whammv. to lose two
back-to-back. [It will give us] just that
much more drive for next season."
Akinradewo finished the season
with a .499 hitting percentage, a Stan
ford and Pac-10 single-season record,
just .005 off the NCAA record. In De
cember, she was named one of four fi
nalists for the Honda Sports Award for
Volleyball - the winner will compete
for the title of Collegiate Woman Ath
lete of the Year in the spring.
Also this year, freshman libero
Gabi Ailes broke the single-season
digs record with 533.
Though the 2007 season is over,sev
eral Stanford players are keeping busy.
Akinradewo has already begun train
ing with the USA National Team, try
ing to earn a spot on the 2(X)8 Olympic
team. Barboza will join her in Col
orado Springs in March. Both Kline
man and Kehoe were among 14 play
ers invited to a National Team tryout

and junior right side hitter Erin Waller
got Stanford's only kill of the game at
13-8. Hodge finished out the match
with a kill to end the Cardinal's title
hopes.
"You know, it is such a momentum
oriented game," Dunning said. "1 think
we knocked them on their heels in
game three and they thought they
could recover and didn't in game four.
They just put their heart out on the
floor, they were ready to start in game
five.
"We all know that is what makes
volleyball amazing to watch and play,
because you get to that fifth game and
who knows what is going to happen.
It's just so exciting, they just did a great
job, they grabbed all the momentum
and it's hard to catch up when you get
down three or four points."
Behind Akinradewo and Kline
man's KS kills apiece, Barboza finished
with 16 and Girard had 10. Klineman
also anchored Stanford in the back row
with her 15 digs. Barboza chipped in 12
and freshman defensive specialists
Cassidy Lichtman and Gabi Ailes
added 10 each.
Along with her 62 assists. Kehoe
tied a career high with five aces and led

pearances (13) and national champi

TTiis was the second straight year
the Cardinal lost in the title game. Stan
ford fell to Nebraska 3-1 in last year's
championship.
"1 think the goal going into next sea
son is to win the national champi
onship. as opposed to losing for the
third straight year," Barboza said after
the final. "That would be ideal. It is just
kind of a double whammv. to lose two
back-to-back. [It will give us] just that
much more drive for next season."
Akinradewo finished the season
with a .499 hitting percentage, a Stan
ford and Pac-10 single-season record,

25,30-26,23-30,19-30,15-8 marathon
victory. Stanford ended its season at
32-3.
"Obviously Penn State is a great
team," head coach John Dunning
said in a postgame press conference.
"I'd really like to congratulate them.
1 thought they started the match ag
gressively. They got the advantage on
us early - I'm not exactly clear at this
point what happened. I'm proud of
our team after game two to come
back with the effort [that we did]."
Megan Hodge, the Nittany Lions'
star sophomore outside hitter, was
named Most Outstanding Player of
the tournament for her 26-kill per
formance in leading Penn State to its
first championship since a victory
over Stanford in the 1999 final.

careers come to an end in their third
championship match in four years on
the Farm.They leave Stanford with a
four-year record of 119-19.
"They're leaders on our team ,"
Dunning said of his seniors. "They're
captains on our team,they've been to
three Finals matches in their careers,
and they're just great people. They
have meant a lot to our program and
always will,and 1 am sure they will go
on to great things after this."
Kehoe leaves as the top setter in
Stanford history, with s,9s6career as
sists. She broke her own single-sea
son record as a senior with 1.742 and
is also in the all-time top 10 in aces
and digs.
Girard had her best offensive sea
son as a senior, with 261 kills and a
.317 hitting percentage. She came up
with key blocks in both the Cardi
nal's Regional Final win over No. 7
UCLA and an NCAA semifinal vic

since a five-game thriller against
Stanford in September, had swept
every opponent coming into the final,
including No. 4 California in the semifi
nal.

was a close one, but Penn State scored
four of the last five points in the game
to win. 30-25.
The Nittany Lions built a small lead
part way through the second game and,
though the Cardinal came within two
points several times, the advantage
held. Penn State sealed the 30-26 win
with a block.
Facing a must-win situation in the
third game, Stanford came out firing
and stunned Penn State, which had
played near flawless volleyball the first
two games. Up 15-13 at the midpoint,
Kehoe served three aces in a row as
part of a five-point run that put the
game out of Penn State's reach. The
lead never dropped below four points,
as a Penn State service error gave the
Cardinal a 30-23 win.
With an opportunity to tie the
match in the fourth game, the Cardinal
powered through the frame, putting

down 23 kills without making a single
error. Akinradewo and junior outside
hitter Cynthia Barboza both notched
six kills on 10 swings in the game and
Girard put each of her live attempts on
the floor.Two straight ball-handling er
rors called on Penn State and an Akin
radewo kill ended the game 30-19 and
pushed the match to the decisive fifth
game.The final marked the first time a
championship match went the distance
since rally scoring was introduced in
2001.
In the last game, however, it was
Penn State with all the firepower and
Stanford struggled to get a kill.The Nit
tany Lions strung together six points in
a row to turn a 4-4 tie into a 10-4 lead
and junior right side hitter Erin Waller
got Stanford's only kill of the game at
13-8. Hodge finished out the match
