When it mattered the most, Stanford couldn't conquer
the Rocky Top.
The Cardinal fell to Tennessee, 64-48. in the national
championship game Tuesday night as Stanford's run
through the NCAA Tournament came to a sudden halt.
The Lady Vols dominated in all aspects of the game as
they wrapped up their second straight title and eighth
overall.
Stanford's performance was arguably their worst of
the year: their points, made and attempted baskets, as
sists, blocks and — most notably — turnover totals were
all season lows. Stanford turned the ball over 25 times,
with 14 coming in the first half.
"The turnovers absolutely killed us. We did not handle
the pressure well." said coach Tara VanDerveer. "1
thought we made a lot of uncharacteristic turnovers and
some very bad decisions."
Tennessee employed a tenacious full court press for
the entire game, and constantly switched their defense
between zone and man to keep the Cardinal from finding
any rhythm on offense. Stanford was hounded in the
backcourt all night, and was forced to make tough passes,
many of which were picked off by the Lady Vols. When
they were able to successfully bring the ball up court, they
had less time to establish their offense.
"We knew that our full court press really would both
er them and take some time off the clock, so they had to
rush their sets," said Tennessee's Candace Parker, who
was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
"We took them out of everything they wanted to do
and they just didn't know what to do against our de
fense," said Nicky Anosike.
On Sunday, Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma ac
knowledged that the Huskies did not use the full court
press enough against Stanford — but when they did. it

worked.Tennessee coach Pat Sumniitt found that lesson
to be particularly telling.
"I thought that as soon as Connecticut went to the
press, it really bothered them." she said. "I felt that our
size and being able to extend our defense would be a
good option for us."
Stanford senior guard Candice Wiggins, who was
named to the All Tournament team, agreed. "They rely a
lot on their defense to get them going. And they're big.
They're in passing lanes. So you can't have any sloppy
passes," she said.
Tennessee was also effective on the glass, particularly
on the offensive end.The fundamentally sound rebound
ing that helped propel the Cardinal against Connecticut
was absent against Tennessee The Lady Vols did not have
a great night shooting the ball — their percentage was
only 39.3 percent for the game, including 33.3 percent in
the second half. But they had a number of second chance
opportunities, pulling down 14 offensive rebounds.
Anosike, who joined Parker and Wiggins along with
teammate Shannon Bobbitt and LSI J's Sylvia Fowles on
the All-Tournament team, was particularly effective,
grabbing three balls off the offensive glass and chipping
in 13 points.
Tennessee's second — and third — chances negated
what was otherwise a nice defensive performance by
Stanford.They held Parker in check for most of the game,
and successfully shut down Alexis llornbuckle. But
Anosike and Bobbitt — who had been inconsistent
throughout the tournament — were both on their game.
Bobbitt hit two crucial three-pointers at the beginning of
the game that helped Tennessee create some separation
early. Vicki Baugh contributed a clutch eight points off
the bench for the Lady Vols, helping them extinguish Car
dinal runs before they even got started.
Still, Stanford was not out of the game until the mid
way point of the second half. They trailed only by eight
heading into halftime, and despite a period of t heir worst

basketball of the season, they were
still close. If they could have turned
it around just a bit, they would have
been in good shape. Stanford quick
ly cut the lead to four, but Tennessee
was equally fast in extending the
margin to 11. The Cardinal never se
riously challenged the Lady Vols
again. Their shots wouldn't fall —
countless attempts rimmed out —
and Tennessee's persistent defense
made their ten point lead seem
much wider.
"Defensively, 1 thought we actu
ally did a decent job," said Van-
Derveer. "But we were not able to
run anything offensively."
It was a disappointing end to an
otherwise brilliant season for the
Cardinal, one in which it beat every
opponent it played (including Ten
nessee, who they knocked off earlier
in the season, 73-69 in overtime).
"The game itself was not indica
tive of the great season we've had,"
said VanDerveer.
The championship match was the
final contest for Wiggins, the Cardi
nal's star, who leaves Stanford as the
school and Pac-10 career-scoring
leader. Her post-game press confer
ence was an emotional affair — she
ultimately broke down in tears over
the prospect of leaving her squad
behind.
"This team is a special team. And
just beautiful people. And I've been
so honored just to be on this team,"
she said.
Indeed, Stanford was a stellar
unit that became more and more
complete as the season progressed
— not only was its star playing well,
but every starter and many reserves
contributed, too.
Stanford had won 23 straight
games before yesterday, and had
cruised through the Pac-10 Tourna
ment and dispensed opponents at
will up in the NCAA Tournament
until the championship game. That,
combined with Tennessee's incon
sistency, led many experts to pick
Stanford to win the championship.
But. just as the Cardinal felt they
had been overlooked against Con
necticut in the semifinals, Tennessee
felt that they weren't getting enough
credit themselves.
"I'm telling you. it was a personal
thing for them," said Summitt. "The
fact that all of the ESPN talent did
n't give us a chance. I mean, that just
really fired them up. And it was
probably the best thing that could
have happened to us."
The frustration manifested itself
on the court, and in the end. it was
the Cardinal who was left behind.
