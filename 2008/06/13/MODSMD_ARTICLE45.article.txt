One national title is impressive.
Two is remarkable. Three? Now
that's a dynasty.
The Stanford women's cross
country team made history last
Monday, winning its third straight
national title at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Terre Haute, Ind. The
team was led by senior Arianna
Lambie, who finished in ninth place
overall with a time of 20:18.2 in the
6K (6.000-meter) race. The Cardi
nal finished in first place with 145
points ahead of Oregon (177) and
Florida State (236), which came in
second and third, respectively.
"I was proud of what I did,"
Lambie said.'i was going into it try
ing to score as low as I could, and I
was happy I could do that.
"It's hard to put into words," she
added. "I'm absolutely thrilled."
The title was Lambie's fourth at
Stanford — the Cardinal also won
in 2003, 2005 and 2006 — and the
fifth-year senior was not alone in
her efforts. Senior team captain
Lauren Centrowitz finished second
for Stanford with a time of 20:59.3
while junior Katie Harrington was
n't far behind in third at 21:06.5.
Freshman Alex Gits (21:12.4) was
the fourth Cardinal finisher and
senior Teresa McWalters (21:16.0),
who collapsed just before the finish
line, lounded out the scoring efforts
for Stanford.
"I think the team's performance
was really spectacular," assistant

coach David Vidal said. "Winning
two years before makes you a
marked team; you're a target when
you've already won twice.That adds
a lot of pressure and puts a lot of ac
countability on the athletes to come
through. They put it all together so
well. It's just so amazing how these
girls can come together when it
counts, on the day of the national
championship."
In particular, Vidal praised the
efforts of the true freshman Gits,
who came up big for the Cardinal
during the season's stretch run.
"It's hard to expect a freshman
to race at the national titles," he
said. "She did more than race, she
finished in fourth. Everyone came
through...it was more than we could
have expected, even."
In a startling conclusion to the
championship race, McWalters —
who won the NCAA West Regional
on Nov. 10 and was named West Re
gional Runner of the Year — col
lapsed about 10 meters before fin
ish line.
"I don't recall any of it actually,"
said McWalters, who said she was
exhausted by the end of the race. "I
just started unraveling. I basically
had nothing left. All I knew is that 1
just had to finish."
Despite falling before the finish
line, the senior was able to pick her
self up and finish the race,coming in
fifth place for Stanford and 62nd
overall.
The Cardinal men also compet
ed in Indiana last Monday but did
not have as much success as the
women. Led by seniors Neftalem
