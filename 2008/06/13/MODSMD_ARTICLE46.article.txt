HOUSTON — Stanford gave it its all. But
in the end. that wasn't enough.
Texas' 20-3 run late in the second half broke
Stanford's will and ended its season, 82-62. in
Saturday's Sweet 16 match-up at Houston's
Reliant Stadium.
The Longhorns' star trio of All-American
point guard D.J. Augustin (23 points, 7 assists),
forward Damion James (18 points) and shoot
ing guard A.J. Abrams (12 points) scored 53,
while Stanford's starting backcourt managed
just 7 points on 2-of-17 shooting. Sophomore
center Brook Lopez kept Stanford (28-7)
close with 26 points (10-of-22, 10 rebounds),
but 299-pound Texas center Dexter Pittman
helped hold Lopez scoreless in the last 13:55.
They would be the sophomore's last 14 min
utes in a Cardinal uniform.
At every other position, the Longhorns
(30-6) were quicker off the dribble, more accu
rate with their shot and more tenacious with
their defense. So while Stanford's backcourt
— senior forward Fred Washington and junior
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony Goods —
wished they had some of those open looks
back, coach Trent Johnson knew that his team
deserved to lose to the 'Horns.
"As hard as it is for me to say. they are bet
ter." he said postgame. "They are better.
"It would be easy for me to sit up here and
say, well, we ran out of gas or didn't do this or
didn't do that. We did what we've done all year
long. We competed and came up short, be
cause they were better at crucial times."
While Stanford never led after 2-0, the
team fought mightily to delay the inevitable.
Johnson made consecutive threes, one right
before the halftime horn and one just after.
Texas's edge was just 43-37, its smallest since a
23-18 lead with 6:19 to go in the first.
The Longhorns responded with two James
free throws and an Augustin layup. But then
Brook Lopez and sophomore reserve Landry
Fields (11 points) got hot, scoring all of Stan
ford's points during a 14-5 run.
Fields, spelling the cold Goods (0 points, 0-
of-7 shooting), capped the spurt with a three
from the top of the arc. It pulled Stanford with
in 52-51 with 12:54 to go.
But that was as close as Stanford would
come as Texas switched to a man defense,
began pressuring the ball more aggressively
and checked Pittman in three minutes later.
Blame fatigue, blame panic, or just credit
Texas, but Stanford didn't score from the field
until a Fields jumper with 3:36 left.
"When [Pittman) started guarding me, I
started throwing up poor percentage shots
that 1 don't normally make," said Lopez, who
missed all four of his shots during Texas's run,
the first on an eight-foot hook that would have
given Stanford a 53-52 lead, but never hit the

rim. "They just came out and 1 think
they just wanted it more."
Augustin, Abrams and James com
bined for 17 points over the 20-3 spurt,
andTexas led 72-54, with just 3:44 sep
arating them from the Elite Eight.
"I think we just ran out of gas, and
they kept throwing bodies at us," said
senior forwardTaj Finger (7 rebounds,
4 points). "They kept beating us up
and just taking it to us."
Both teams started off cold, with
their depth perception perhaps affect
ed by the dozens of feet behind either
backboard in the arena. Texas led just
12-8 after nine minutes, with the teams
a combined 0-of-8 deep.
Then Texas' guards and Lopez
started getting uncorked. In the face
of a consistent Texas double team,
Brook posted a 15-point. 10-rebound
half, helping Stanford stay within 40-
34 at halftime.
"It's almost like what I remember
as a kid growing up with the Green

Bay Packers and that sweep they ran,"
Texas coach Rick Barnes said of fac
ing Brook Lopez. "You knew it was
coming, but there is just not a whole
lot you can do about it."
Lope/ needed to start strong, be
cause Stanford's first points outside
the paint came on junior forward
Lawrence Hill's three — with 2:31 left
in the first half.
The rest of the teams' struggles on
offense are all the more concerning
for next year,given that Brook Lopez
is a likely top-five pick in the NBA
Draft.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out this is probably his last
game in a Stanford uniform," coach
Johnson said postgame.
Both players declined to discuss
their plans for next year after the
game.
The Cardinal, picked fifth in the
Pac-10 and No. 23 nationally presea
son, exceeded expectations with its
highest win total and first Sweet 16
berth of the Trent Johnson era. So
while there was anger after the Texas
loss, there was also a sense of pride.
"When they take a long step back
and take a look at this, thev will feel

good about what they accomplished."
coach Johnson said.
"Yes, we had goals to be Pac-10
Champions during the season; yes, we
had a goal to be conference champi
ons; and yes they had a goal to get to
the Final Four. And the thing about it
is they believed and worked their tails
off to put themselves in a position
where they just came up just a step
short in all three of them."
For seniors Washington, junior
guard Kenny Brown and senior cen
ter Peter Prowitt, the game was likely
their last in not just a Stanford jersey,
but any uniform at all.
Finger, the one senior with a realis
tic shot and desire to play overseas
next year, was just as proud of his last
year at Stanford.
"We didn't play in the past three
years to Stanford, to what people ex
pected Stanford to be," he said of the
three-year spurt with no wins in the
NCAA Tournament. "This year, we
had a great season: second in the Pac
-10, making it to the Sweet 16. 1 defi
nitely think that we left our mark."

HOUSTON — Stanford gave it its all. But
in the end. that wasn't enough.
Texas' 20-3 run late in the second half broke
Stanford's will and ended its season, 82-62. in
Saturday's Sweet 16 match-up at Houston's
Reliant Stadium.
The Longhorns' star trio of All-American
point guard D.J. Augustin (23 points, 7 assists),
forward Damion James (18 points) and shoot
ing guard A.J. Abrams (12 points) scored 53,
while Stanford's starting backcourt managed
just 7 points on 2-of-17 shooting. Sophomore
center Brook Lopez kept Stanford (28-7)
close with 26 points (10-of-22, 10 rebounds),
but 299-pound Texas center Dexter Pittman
helped hold Lopez scoreless in the last 13:55.
They would be the sophomore's last 14 min
utes in a Cardinal uniform.
At every other position, the Longhorns
(30-6) were quicker off the dribble, more accu
rate with their shot and more tenacious with
their defense. So while Stanford's backcourt
— senior forward Fred Washington and junior
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony Goods —
wished they had some of those open looks
back, coach Trent Johnson knew that his team
deserved to lose to the 'Horns.
"As hard as it is for me to say. they are bet
ter." he said postgame. "They are better.
"It would be easy for me to sit up here and
say, well, we ran out of gas or didn't do this or
didn't do that. We did what we've done all year
long. We competed and came up short, be
cause they were better at crucial times."
While Stanford never led after 2-0, the
team fought mightily to delay the inevitable.
Johnson made consecutive threes, one right
before the halftime horn and one just after.
Texas's edge was just 43-37, its smallest since a
23-18 lead with 6:19 to go in the first.
The Longhorns responded with two James
free throws and an Augustin layup. But then
Brook Lopez and sophomore reserve Landry
Fields (11 points) got hot, scoring all of Stan
ford's points during a 14-5 run.
Fields, spelling the cold Goods (0 points, 0-
of-7 shooting), capped the spurt with a three
from the top of the arc. It pulled Stanford with
in 52-51 with 12:54 to go.
But that was as close as Stanford would
come as Texas switched to a man defense,
began pressuring the ball more aggressively
and checked Pittman in three minutes later.
Blame fatigue, blame panic, or just credit
Texas, but Stanford didn't score from the field
until a Fields jumper with 3:36 left.
"When [Pittman) started guarding me, I
started throwing up poor percentage shots
that 1 don't normally make," said Lopez, who
missed all four of his shots during Texas's run,
the first on an eight-foot hook that would have
given Stanford a 53-52 lead, but never hit the
