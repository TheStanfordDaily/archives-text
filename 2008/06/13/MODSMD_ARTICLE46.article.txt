HOUSTON — Stanford gave it its all. But
in the end. that wasn't enough.
Texas' 20-3 run late in the second half broke
Stanford's will and ended its season, 82-62. in
Saturday's Sweet 16 match-up at Houston's
Reliant Stadium.
The Longhorns' star trio of All-American
point guard D.J. Augustin (23 points, 7 assists),
forward Damion James (18 points) and shoot
ing guard A.J. Abrams (12 points) scored 53,
while Stanford's starting backcourt managed
just 7 points on 2-of-17 shooting. Sophomore
center Brook Lopez kept Stanford (28-7)
close with 26 points (10-of-22, 10 rebounds),
but 299-pound Texas center Dexter Pittman
helped hold Lopez scoreless in the last 13:55.
They would be the sophomore's last 14 min
utes in a Cardinal uniform.
At every other position, the Longhorns
(30-6) were quicker off the dribble, more accu
rate with their shot and more tenacious with
their defense. So while Stanford's backcourt
— senior forward Fred Washington and junior
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony Goods —
wished they had some of those open looks
back, coach Trent Johnson knew that his team
deserved to lose to the 'Horns.
"As hard as it is for me to say. they are bet
ter." he said postgame. "They are better.
"It would be easy for me to sit up here and
say, well, we ran out of gas or didn't do this or
didn't do that. We did what we've done all year
long. We competed and came up short, be
cause they were better at crucial times."
While Stanford never led after 2-0, the
team fought mightily to delay the inevitable.
Johnson made consecutive threes, one right
before the halftime horn and one just after.
Texas's edge was just 43-37, its smallest since a
23-18 lead with 6:19 to go in the first.
The Longhorns responded with two James
free throws and an Augustin layup. But then
Brook Lopez and sophomore reserve Landry
Fields (11 points) got hot, scoring all of Stan
ford's points during a 14-5 run.
Fields, spelling the cold Goods (0 points, 0-
of-7 shooting), capped the spurt with a three
from the top of the arc. It pulled Stanford with
in 52-51 with 12:54 to go.
But that was as close as Stanford would
come as Texas switched to a man defense,
began pressuring the ball more aggressively
and checked Pittman in three minutes later.
Blame fatigue, blame panic, or just credit
Texas, but Stanford didn't score from the field
until a Fields jumper with 3:36 left.
"When [Pittman) started guarding me, I
started throwing up poor percentage shots
that 1 don't normally make," said Lopez, who
missed all four of his shots during Texas's run,
the first on an eight-foot hook that would have
given Stanford a 53-52 lead, but never hit the

Texas guard D.J. Augustin had little trouble breaking down Brook Lopez and the Cardinal defense during a game in late March, scoring 23 points while
dishing out seven assists.
