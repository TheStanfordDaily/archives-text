Seven-foot twins Brook and Robin Lopez came to
the Farm together, and they will leave together.
Just three days removed from Stanford's season
ending loss to Texas and a day before their 20th birth
days, the Lopez twins announced their decision on
Sunday to enter the NBA draft through a release sent
by their mother, Deborah Ledford, to The Associated
Press.
"After a great deal of thought and discussion with
my family, I feel it is the appropriate time to enter the
NBA draft," Brook Lopez said. "It is the dream of
every basketball player to play and succeed in the
NBA, and I feel I am ready to take on this new chal
lenge."
Brook Lopez is considered to be a top-five pick in
the 2008 NBA Draft by a number of sources, including
ESPN.com. which currently has the sophomore listed
as the third pick in its mock draft. CBS analyst C'lark
Kellogg also deemed him the most dominant player
left in the NCAA Tournament when there were 32
teams remaining.
While the announcement of Brook Lopez's inten
tion to declare for the draft came as no surprise to
many — the sophomore big man averaged 19.3 points
and 8.2 rebounds while showing himself to be one of
the best post players in all of college basketball — the
announcement of Robin Lopez was less predictable.
"This has been a very difficult decision for me be
cause 1 really enjoyed my two years at Stanford,"
Robin Lopez told the AP. "1 have always hoped I
would have an opportunity to play in the NBA. and I
feel now is the right time to make that dream a reali
ty."
Although Robin's numbers were less stellar
10.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game — he showed
flashes of great potential throughout his two years at
the Farm and is considered by many to be a possible
first round pick in this June's NBA Draft.
Out of town. Stanford head coach Trent Johnson
was unavailable for comment regarding the twins' de
cision. However, the announcement — especially
Brook's — probably wasn't the greatest surprise to

the fourth-year Cardinal coach.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to fig
ure out this is probably his [Brook Lopez's]
last game in a Stanford uniform." coach
Johnson said after the team's 82-62 loss to
Texas on Friday.
The decision to go pro will soon be set in
stone for the twins, as Ledford announced
that they plan to sign with an agent, thereby
waiving any NCAA eligibility.
"That's something we're still working on
and finalizing," she said. "It's a definite deci
sion. We'll be hiring agents."
'ITie announcement was certainly not an
easy one to make for the twins, whose seven
foot frames have been hallmarks both on
campus and on the court. Both said that they
eventually plan to return to the Farm in
order to complete their degree require
ments.
"I have really enjoyed my time at Stan
ford." Brook Lopez said. "The university has
afforded me a great opportunity to gain an
education from one of the finest schools in
the country, while also allowing me to devel
op as a basketball player."
The departure of the Lopez twins raises
many questions about the future of coach
Trent Johnson's program, which experi
enced a revival of sorts this season after fin
ishing second place in the Pac-10 and reach
ing the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament
for the first time in seven years.
The brothers were the Cardinal's two
leading scorers this season while juniors An
thony Goods and Lawrence Hill were mired
in season-long shooting slumps. In particu
lar. Brook Lopez carried the team through
most of the season, whether it was his game
winning shot over Marquette in the second
round or his numerous 20-point perform
ances.
That said, it may be more beneficial for
fans of Stanford and those surrounding the
program to appreciate the Lopez's two sea
sons instead of lamenting their departure.
"Nobody's surprised. We wish they were
staying, but they made their decisions," Ath
letic Director Bob Bowlsby said in Spokane,
Wash., where the women's team was playing
in the NCAA Regional Final.
"They're terrific players, no question
about that. They've done a great job for us."
