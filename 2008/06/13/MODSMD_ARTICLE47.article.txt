Seven-foot twins Brook and Robin Lopez came to
the Farm together, and they will leave together.
Just three days removed from Stanford's season
ending loss to Texas and a day before their 20th birth
days, the Lopez twins announced their decision on
Sunday to enter the NBA draft through a release sent
by their mother, Deborah Ledford, to The Associated
Press.
"After a great deal of thought and discussion with
my family, I feel it is the appropriate time to enter the
NBA draft," Brook Lopez said. "It is the dream of
every basketball player to play and succeed in the
NBA, and I feel I am ready to take on this new chal
lenge."
Brook Lopez is considered to be a top-five pick in
the 2008 NBA Draft by a number of sources, including
ESPN.com. which currently has the sophomore listed
as the third pick in its mock draft. CBS analyst C'lark
Kellogg also deemed him the most dominant player
left in the NCAA Tournament when there were 32
teams remaining.
While the announcement of Brook Lopez's inten
tion to declare for the draft came as no surprise to
many — the sophomore big man averaged 19.3 points
and 8.2 rebounds while showing himself to be one of
the best post players in all of college basketball — the
announcement of Robin Lopez was less predictable.
"This has been a very difficult decision for me be
cause 1 really enjoyed my two years at Stanford,"
Robin Lopez told the AP. "1 have always hoped I
would have an opportunity to play in the NBA. and I
feel now is the right time to make that dream a reali
ty."
Although Robin's numbers were less stellar
10.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game — he showed
flashes of great potential throughout his two years at
the Farm and is considered by many to be a possible
first round pick in this June's NBA Draft.
Out of town. Stanford head coach Trent Johnson
was unavailable for comment regarding the twins' de
cision. However, the announcement — especially
Brook's — probably wasn't the greatest surprise to
