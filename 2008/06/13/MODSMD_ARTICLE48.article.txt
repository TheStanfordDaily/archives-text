I If the office is any indication, the
transition is still incomplete. The
walls of Mike Montgomery's new of
fice in the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center are still mostly bare, adorned
only with a photo of Pebble Beach and a
blown-up shot of former Stanford star
Mark Madsen celebrating after the Cardi
nal clinched a berth to the 1998 Final Four.
The Madsen shot, however, has not been
mounted yet; it rests against the wall.
Montgomery, the former Stanford coach
who reached his only Final Four that year,
said his new position as assistant to Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby was "a work in
progress."
The Daily sat down with Montgomery
for an hour-long interview earlier this
month to talk about his new role at Stan
ford. his stint coaching in the NBA and his
fondest memories from The Farm. Mont
gomery also discussed his relationship
with current Stanford men's basketball
coach Trent Johnson, and whether he will
ever return to the sidelines — a possibility,
he said, because "there's still a lot of bas
ketball in my blood."
Montgomery began his part-time posi
tion in September, a role that has included
fundraising, public relations and serving as
a resource for coaches.The coach, who will
turn 61 later this month.said he had always
considered a move to the front office after
he was done coaching.
The thing is, he's not so sure he's done.
"I'm not as old as I thought," Mont
gomery said. "I think things have changed.
I enjoy being around here; I just have a lot
of respect for Stanford and the athletes
that perform here because I know how
hard they all work.
"But you know there's still a lot of bas
ketball in my blood, just because you do
something for that long." he added. "We'll
have to wait and see if anything develops
there ... You've done something for 37
years, and it's just what you do."
Montgomery, who amassed a 393-167
record in his 18 years at the helm of Stan
ford basketball, gets his basketball fix
these days doing part-time broadcast work
for FOX Sports Net, Comcast and CBS
Radio. "It keeps me in the basketball

loop," he said, "which is good for me."
Every now and then, Montgomery will
drop by Maples Pavilion as the mens bas
ketball team is practicing. He's known
Johnson, his successor, for years. He re
cruited Johnson while working as an assis
tant coach at Boise State in 1974, and later
hired Johnson for an assistant coaching
position at Stanford in 1996.
He tries not to be around too much,
however.
"I'm sensitive to Trent," Montgomery
said. "I don't want to be around all the time
where it feels like I'm hovering. He de
serves the right to be his own man — and
he's doing a great job."
Johnson, for his part, said he was happy
to have his former coach and mentor
around again.
"1 think he likes to see somebody else
sweat," Johnson said with a smile. "He'll
come by and say 'God, you've had a lot of
close games' or 'You've done a good job
controlling your temper, but you need to
enjoy it more."'
"Still, I would like a little more help."
Johnson deadpanned.
For Montgomery, having his former
player and assistant follow his footsteps is
the perfect fit. "The knowledge that he
has of Stanford, of what it takes, the type of
issues that you deal with is extremely ben
eficial," Montgomery said. "I thought it
was a pretty seamless transition."
Transitioning to the NBA, however,
was not seamless for Montgomery. He had
a 68-96 record in two seasons as head
coach of the Golden State Warriors before
being released in August 2006. Running a
college basketball program and coaching
professionals in the NBA, he learned, are
two different beasts.
"In college, you're top dog, you're in
charge of everything, you're the guy," he
said. "The kids will listen, they'll look up to
you, you're making the decisions, top to
bottom, pretty much unilaterally. In the
pros, it's pretty much a players' league.
And your job is to manage those players
and make sure you can try to get them to
do what you need them to do. It's a little
more difficult than it is in college. You
don't have the power."
Montgomery said he had "no regrets"
about taking the job, however.
"It was what it was." he said."You went
in. a lot of things different [than] you
maybe thought they were. 1 probably
wasn't as prepared as I needed to be,
obviously."
Montgomery, who led Stanford to 12
NCAA Tournament berths, four regu
lar season Pac-10 championships and a
2004 Pac-10 Tournament title, said
1998's Final Four appearance was not
the best moment in his coaching career.
"I think obviously going [to the]
Pinl Four, in terms of our program and

the thrill of the Final Four, was spectac
ular. but that wasn't our best team, 1
don't think." he said." But things just re
ally fell into place, which really was an
indication of how the NCAA tourna
ment is, things have to fall into place for
you.
"I thought winning our first Pac-10
appearance was huge," he continued.
"We ended up doing it four times, but
that first one — it was like 'Stanford
could win the Pac-10.' UCLA dominat
ed for so long, then Arizona came
along. As good as we were, winning that
championship was the best."
For now, Montgomery remains a
spectator. Coaching may come calling

again, but in the meantime he can sit
back and watch while his former pro
tege has guided his team to a 20-3 sea
son and a top-10 national ranking.
"I always knew this: when you're
done, you're done, and people don't re
ally care," Montgomery said of moving
on. "You're out and the next guy's in;
I've always said that. You're old news
pretty quickly. You have to be able to
deal with that.
"It's somebody else's gig now. and
everyone's excited about the new guy,"
he added. "And they should be.Trent's
done a great job."
