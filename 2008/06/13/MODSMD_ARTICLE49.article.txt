Stanford has hired former Duke player and assistant
coach Johnny Dawkins as head coach of the men's basket
ball team, the University announced Saturday.
'The 44-year-old Dawkins comes to the Farm after 11
years at Duke, the past nine as associate head coach to
Mike Krzyzewski. Hie former All-American lacks head
coaching experience but won out over two other finalists
with Stanford ties â€” current Cardinal assistant and for
mer Idaho State head coach Doug Oliver and Portland
head coach Hric Reveno. a former Stanford player and as
sistant.
Dawkins replaces Pac-1() Coach of the Year Trent John
son, who took the head coaching position at Louisiana
State on April 10. Dawkins will be formally introduced at
a press conference Monday.
"We are thrilled to welcome Johnny and his family to
Stanford." Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby said. "His cre
dentials as a player, combined with his coaching experi
ence gained mentoring under a Hall of Fame coach at a
university such as Duke, made him a perfect fit for Stan
ford."
Many speculated that the soft-spoken Dawkins would
be the eventual replacement for Krzyzewski. Moth at Duke
and the U.S. Olympic team under Krzyzewski, Dawkins
was primarily responsible for player development, an im
portant trait for a Stanford program faced with rigorous
recruiting standards.
"The philosophies of the two programs both on the
court and in the classroom are very similar." Bowlsby said.
"I am confident Johnny's leadership skills, coaching abili
ty and commitment to attract top-flight student-athletes
will be a driving force in continuing Stanford's tradition of
basketball excellence."
During his 11 years on the sidelines at Duke, the Blue
Devils were 330-60, winning seven ACC Tournament titles,
six ACC regular season championships and the national
championship in 2001. Nine Duke players were drafted in
the NBA lottery, and four were national players of the
year.
Dawkins inherits a Stanford team that reached the
Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2001. But the Cardi
nal's top scorers from last season, seven-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, both declared for the NBA draft. Stan
ford's strength next season will likely be on the perimeter,

around seniors-to-be Mitch Johnson, Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Mill.
Such a style would not mark a major departure for
Dawkins, whose Duke teams in recent years have played
primarily around the perimeter.
The terms of Hawkins's deal were not announced, but
his contract will likely be for four or five years, worth
around $600,000 a year. Johnson, who was seeking a five to
six year contract extension at Stanford, will make at least
$1.2 million a year for five seasons at LSU, with additional
bonuses available if the team meets certain performance
and academic standards.
Dawkins is the second high profile hiring in as many
