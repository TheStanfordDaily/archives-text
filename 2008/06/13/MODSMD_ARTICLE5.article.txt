In what the University called its largest financial
aid increase in history, Stanford announced that it
will significantly reduce the expected contributions
of lower- and middle-income families to tuition and
other educational expenses for students enrolled in
the 2008-2009 academic year.
Parents with incomes of less than $ 100,000 will no
longer he expected to pay tuition under the new plan,
while those with incomes of less than $60,000 will not
be expected to contribute to tuition or the costs of
room, board and other educational expenses.
University officials expect the average parent
contribution for students receiving financial aid to
decrease by 16 percent.
In addition to lowering expectations for parents,
the changes will also lessen the burden of expected
contributions from students who are on financial
aid. Students will no longer be required to apply for
loans as part of their financial aid packages.
"This is a significant change in the way we do
business in the Financial Aid Office," said Director
of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
According to a press release issued by the Uni
versity, the changes will bring Stanford's undergrad
uate financial aid program to more than $114 million
— from $76 million in 2007-2008 — which makes it
one of the largest programs of its kind in the nation.

According to a University Web site describing en
hancements to the financial aid policy, the need
based scholarship budget has increased by $20.7 mil
lion to a total budget of $97.2 million.
Cooper said part of the motivation for the
changes was to send a clear message to low- and mid
dle-income families that Stanford is affordable, es
pecially to those students who do not consider apply
ing to Stanford for financial reasons.
"By devoting more resources to financial aid. we
seek to underscore what has long been the case —
that no high-school senior should rule out applying
to Stanford because of cost." President John Hen
nessy said in a written statement. "We understand
how families face serious financial pressures, and we
are doing all we can to assist them."
The University also announced total undergradu
ate tuition and fees would increase by 3.5 percent to
$47,212, compared to $45,608 for the current aca
demic year.
"Although Stanford's tuition has gone up over
the past five years, thanks to our increasingly gener
ous financial aid program, families with incomes less
than $150,000 will find a Stanford education much
more affordable than it was five years ago." Univer
sity Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 said in a
statement. "For most of these students, attending
Stanford will cost less than most private and many
public universities."
Cooper said families who are on financial aid are
generally protected from tuition increases because
the expected parent contribution remains relatively
the same from year to year for most students. Any in
crease in tuition is usually matched by an increase in
scholarship funds made available to students on fi
nancial aid. Cooper added.
The University's announcement comes more
than two months after Harvard University declared
it would significantly increase financial aid granted
to middle-class and upper-middle-class students.

Several schools, including Yale and Dartmouth,
made similar announcements amid growing con
cerns that tuition at some of the nation's top univer
sities is becoming too expensive for families to af
ford.
Hennessy noted that the changes mark the third
consecutive year Stanford has allocated more
money to financial aid for lower- and middle-income
families.
"This is a track we have been on," Cooper said.
"Certainly we were aware of other announcements
happening and cognizant of the fact that we need to
compete for these students. But a big driver for the
decisions that were made was really what's right for
Stanford families."
The changes have been made possible partly
through the success of the University's fundraising
campaigns and its decision last year to increase its
endowment payout from 5.0 to 5.5 percent, accord
ing to Cooper.The University plans to double the fi
nancial aid goal of its current fundraising campaign,
the Stanford Challenge, to $200 million.
Cooper said the new changes make it possible for
some students to receive aid even if they had not pre
viously qualified. She anticipates seeing more appli
cations come in from students who are on the margin
of qualifying for aid.
"We want to reach out to those families who feel
like it's difficult," Cooper said. "If we said 'no' in the
past, this might be the year to try again."
Three out of every four Stanford undergraduates
currently receive some form of financial aid. accord
ing to the University.
Cooper said she has high hopes for the changes to
Stanford's aid program.
"I think we're going to have one of the most gen
erous financial aid programs in the country," Cooper
said.
