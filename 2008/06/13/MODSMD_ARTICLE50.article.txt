## Trent Johnson reportedly leaving Stanford for LSU

After four years on the Farm, Trent Johnson
has agreed in principle to an offer to become the
next head basketball coach at LSU, according to
multiple sources close to the situation. An official
announcement could come as early as Thursday.
Johnson, the Pac-10 Conference Coach of the
Year, attended the annual men's basketball team
banquet Wednesday evening and was expected to
take a redeye flight to Louisiana afterward. He
has not yet signed a contract, but is expected to
sign a five-year deal Thursday reportedly worth
$1 million to $1.2 million annually.
In doing so, he will finally accept an offer he
had turned down multiple times in recent days, ac
cording to a source close to Johnson and the pro
gram. A contract extension from Stanford Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby, rumored to be in the
works for months, was finally offered earlier this
week, for about half the length of the five-year
deal Johnson wanted.
"1 think it came down to he was not wanted,"
the source said. "When you get a feeling of not
being wanted, no matter how much you love your
company or your job, if your boss doesn't love
you, that's not a good place to be in."
By all accounts, Johnson had no desire to leave
Stanford. Players said the banquet was mostly
normal, but Johnson choked up after receiving a
standing ovation while thanking his team for let
ting him be a part of their lives.
Reached by email Wednesday afternoon while
returning from the women's national champi
onship basketball game, Bowlsby said he was not
aware that Johnson had accepted another posi
tion.
"LSU notified me this morning while we were
on the way to the airport in Tampa that they want
ed to talk to Trent," the athletic director said. "The
position probably pays twice what he makes at
Stanford, so 1 guess he feels he has to listen."
Bowlsby could not be reached for further com
ment Wednesday evening. According to the
source, he wanted to meet with Johnson Wednes
day night, though the source cautioned, "it would
take someone else than Bob Bowlsby getting in
volved" to work out a 23rd-hour deal.
Johnson's logical replacement would have
been former Stanford coach Mike Montgomery,
who returned last fall in a part-time position in the
athletic department as an assistant to Bowlsby.
Montgomery, however, was hired just last Friday
as head coach at Cal, and issued a statement yes
terday to the Oakland Tribune reaffirming his de
sire to fulfill his new role.
"1 am the head basketball coach at the Univer
sity of California," Montgomery said. "1 am excit
ed about the challenges that lie ahead and look
forward to competing for a Pac-10 champi
onship."
Johnson first came to the Farm in 19% and
served three seasons as an assistant to Mont
gomery before taking a head coaching position at

Nevada. After five seasons, he returned to Stan
ford in 2004 when Montgomery left to coach the
NBA's Golden State Warriors.
On the sidelines, Johnson developed a reputa
tion for hard-nosed intensity that rubbed some
players the wrong way but delivered results. He
led the Cardinal to three NCAA Tournament ap
pearances and an 80-4N record in four seasons, in
cluding a 45-27 record in Pac-10 play. This season
he led Stanford to 28 wins and its first Sweet Six
teen appearance since 2001.
Still, a contract extension never came. I lis orig
inal five-year deal was set to expire after next sea
son. leading some to speculate that the coach and
athletic director did not exactly see eye-to-eye.
"[Johnson leaving] is not that surprising to
someone who knows what their relationship has
been like since day one." the source said. "From
what I understand, every conversation is fine, but
