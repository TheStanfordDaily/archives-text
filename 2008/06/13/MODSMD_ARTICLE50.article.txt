## Trent Johnson reportedly leaving Stanford for LSU

After four years on the Farm, Trent Johnson
has agreed in principle to an offer to become the
next head basketball coach at LSU, according to
multiple sources close to the situation. An official
announcement could come as early as Thursday.
Johnson, the Pac-10 Conference Coach of the
Year, attended the annual men's basketball team
banquet Wednesday evening and was expected to
take a redeye flight to Louisiana afterward. He
has not yet signed a contract, but is expected to
sign a five-year deal Thursday reportedly worth
$1 million to $1.2 million annually.
In doing so, he will finally accept an offer he
had turned down multiple times in recent days, ac
cording to a source close to Johnson and the pro
gram. A contract extension from Stanford Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby, rumored to be in the
works for months, was finally offered earlier this
week, for about half the length of the five-year
deal Johnson wanted.
"1 think it came down to he was not wanted,"
the source said. "When you get a feeling of not
being wanted, no matter how much you love your
company or your job, if your boss doesn't love
you, that's not a good place to be in."
By all accounts, Johnson had no desire to leave
Stanford. Players said the banquet was mostly
normal, but Johnson choked up after receiving a
standing ovation while thanking his team for let
ting him be a part of their lives.
Reached by email Wednesday afternoon while
returning from the women's national champi
onship basketball game, Bowlsby said he was not
aware that Johnson had accepted another posi
tion.
"LSU notified me this morning while we were
on the way to the airport in Tampa that they want
ed to talk to Trent," the athletic director said. "The
position probably pays twice what he makes at
Stanford, so 1 guess he feels he has to listen."
Bowlsby could not be reached for further com
ment Wednesday evening. According to the
source, he wanted to meet with Johnson Wednes
day night, though the source cautioned, "it would
take someone else than Bob Bowlsby getting in
volved" to work out a 23rd-hour deal.
Johnson's logical replacement would have
been former Stanford coach Mike Montgomery,
who returned last fall in a part-time position in the
athletic department as an assistant to Bowlsby.
Montgomery, however, was hired just last Friday
as head coach at Cal, and issued a statement yes
terday to the Oakland Tribune reaffirming his de
sire to fulfill his new role.
"1 am the head basketball coach at the Univer
sity of California," Montgomery said. "1 am excit
ed about the challenges that lie ahead and look
forward to competing for a Pac-10 champi
onship."
Johnson first came to the Farm in 19% and
served three seasons as an assistant to Mont
gomery before taking a head coaching position at

Nevada. After five seasons, he returned to Stan
ford in 2004 when Montgomery left to coach the
NBA's Golden State Warriors.
On the sidelines, Johnson developed a reputa
tion for hard-nosed intensity that rubbed some
players the wrong way but delivered results. He
led the Cardinal to three NCAA Tournament ap
pearances and an 80-4N record in four seasons, in
cluding a 45-27 record in Pac-10 play. This season
he led Stanford to 28 wins and its first Sweet Six
teen appearance since 2001.
Still, a contract extension never came. I lis orig
inal five-year deal was set to expire after next sea
son. leading some to speculate that the coach and
athletic director did not exactly see eye-to-eye.
"[Johnson leaving] is not that surprising to
someone who knows what their relationship has
been like since day one." the source said. "From
what I understand, every conversation is fine, but

contract extension and leave Stanford to fill the va

they're just infrequent. For whatev
er reason, [ Bowlsby] will go months,
lmonths. months, without meeting
coach Johnson. Of course meetings
were canceled and rescheduled,
blah, blah, blah, they're both busy.
But some of us, we assumed, he's
coached here two times and won
twice, it seems like a pretty easy de
cision."
Stanford's players had not heard
of Johnson's potential move to
Louisiana State until reading online
media reports Wednesday morning.
Johnson informed the team in per
son in a hastily scheduled meeting
Wednesday afternoon.
"I really enjoyed playing for
coach Johnson," said senior forward
and team co-captain Taj Finger,
whose defensive energy matched
Johnson's coaching style. "I thought
he was a great coach and am defi
nitely sad to see he is leaving Stan
ford University."
On his blog, former Stanford Star
Mark Madsen expressed surprise at
Johnson's departure but wished his
former assistant coach well.
"1 can attest to the fact that all of
us who played under Trent (when
he was a Stanford assistant coach)
are mourning if he's really gone, but
at the same time we are happy for
him," Madsen wrote. "I am happy
for Trent and his family. This man
deserves the very best because he is
a first-class individual and one of
the best basketball minds in the

business."
"In the same way that there is a
business side to the NBA. there is a
business side to being a college
coach," he added. "I wish somehow
we could have kept Trent at Stan
ford. but it looks like he's taken an
other great opportunity."
News of Johnson's impending de
parture has already put some re
cruiting efforts on hold. Ryan Kelly,
a 6-foot-9 power forward from
North Carolina, canceled a poten
tial campus visit on Wednesday
after hearing about the potential
coaching change.
Doreen Kelly, however, said her
son was still interested in Stanford.
"Stanford is Stanford," she told
Scout.com. "That's the point. Now
this isn't the appropriate time to
visit them but we'll look anyway.
The point is [the staff's] personal
lives are in turmoil. They have no
idea what job they'll have in 48
hours. Why put them through that?
We'll back off and see what the sce
nario is. The only thing that is per
sonally disappointing is trying to
figure out if distance will be a fac
tor" in Ryan's decision.
It has been a tumultuous off-sea
son thus far for Stanford. Johnson's
departure comes in the wake of
Montgomery's decision to move
across the Bay and the announce
ment by sophomore seven-footers
Brook and Robin Lopez on March
31 that they would forgo their final
two seasons at Stanford to enter the
2008 NBA Draft.
