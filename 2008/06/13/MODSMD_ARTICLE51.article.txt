In just his second full year as Stanford's
Athletic Director. Bob Bowlsby has already
made waves. After last year's horrendous 1-
11 football campaign, he pulled the plug on
second-year coach Walt Harris and hired up
start Jim Harbaugh, a move which already
appears to have paid dividends. Bowslby, 55,
seems to have a knack for big-time football
hires: while at lowa, he was responsible for
hiring Kirk Ferentz.
Bowlsby sat down recently with The Daily
for a question-and-answer session, discussing
various topics ranging from life on ITie Farm
to Mike Montgomery to Jim Harbaugh.
Stanford Daily: Try to describe- the pressures
of working as the Athletic Director at the
big-time. Division I level.
Bob Bowlsby: 1 don't know. I've been man
aging a Division l-A athletics program for
most of the last 20 years. The things that go
with it are the things that go with it. h has its
pressures like any other thing on campus, or
any other job. I don't spend much /time/
thinking about it to tell you the truth.
SD: What was the change like coming from
lowa to here? What motivated you to come
out West?
BB:There's some things that are a little dif
ferent about living in California. We live on
campus — we really enjoy being close to
campus and close to the activities.
More than anything else, what attracted
me to Stanford was the merger of world-class
academics and world-class athletics. Qui pro
grams are comprised of outstanding students
and it's a new set of challenges. Some of the
things that were easy at lowa are difficult
here and some of the things that were diffi
cult at lowa are relatively easy here.
SI): What major changes, if any. have you en
acted since taking over for Ted Leland in
April 2006? What is the biggest difference
about Stanford now that you're around?
BB: 1 wouldn't say it's radically different.
What I found here was a culture of high
achievement, a culture of doing things the
right way.Those are both difficult to create if

they're not already there.That's a great foun
dation for a program, and it probably existed
before Ted got here, but he certainly en
hanced it and nurtured it. We've made some
changes to fundraising and the business as
pects of the program, but fundamentally,
there haven't been radical changes required.
SD: What changes would you still like to see
made?
BB: There are lots of things we're working
on. I don't believe we're as good technologi
cally as we need to be. I don't think our Web
sites are as good as they need to be. I think
how we interface with various publics needs
to be improved. I think some of the services
we provide to our various publics could be
more efficient.
It doesn't matter how good the organization
is: there are always ways it can be made bet
ter...Even as successful as we've been, there
are ways we can get better.
SD:Talk about Jim Harbaugh. What was it
about him that made him the right guy for the
job?
BB: lie made the considered decision to
move from professional football to learning
how the college game worked with his move
from the Raiders to the University of San
Diego.
What I heard repeatedly about Jim was
that he was a person who made everyone
around him better. I think that's about as
good a trait one could ask for in a coach. 1
liked his energy and the success he had. More
than anything else. I kept hearing he was a
guy that made everyone around him better,
and I think we found that to be true.
SD: Where were you during the USC victo
ry? What was your initial reaction and how
do you view the win now?
BB: I was at the game. Part of the time I was
in the press box, the second half I was [watch
ing] from the sideline. I was about 30 feet
from Bradford's catch in the end zone. It was
a huge win. Some have called it the biggest
upset in the history of college football, so it's
significant from that standpoint. It was fun to
be a part of that — I think it gives us hope for
the future with what Stanford football can
be. but it still leaves us with a lot of work to be
done.

I was happy for our players, particularly,
and obviously for our coaches. The players
have been through a lot the last two to three
years, and some of them longer than that. It
was nice for them to have a chance to get
some positive feedback.
SI): Comment on former Stanford basketball
coach Mike Montgomery's role in the Ath
letic Department.
BB: Mike's a big part of Stanford athletics
history. We're very glad to have him back and
he'll be working with our staff on fundraising
activities and working on a public relations
standpoint. I expect he'll be serving on some
NCAA committees and providing them with
the benefit of his years of experience — his
years of experience will serve well as a re
source to draw upon.
SI): The recent Brook Lopez suspension
raised the ever-present issue of college ath
letes and their place as students. At a school
like Stanford, how do you balance between
promoting big-time athletics while keeping
intact the fundamental motives of the Uni
versity?
BB: I think that's what makes Stanford spe
cial; we don't compromise in any area. We de
mand that every one of our student athletes
is competitive in the classroom. It's one of the
things that appeals to me about Stanford,
[and| it appeals to our coaches and our stu
dent athletes. I think our standard doesn't
change much from sport to sport or season to
season or person to person. We expect high
achievement in both areas: when that doesn't
happen we have to take the necessary steps.
SI) Is your position at Stanford the pinnacle
for you in terms of your career? Do you have
loftier career aspirations?
BB 1 certainly don't expect to be going any
place. I'm 55 and I don't know how much
longer I'll work, but I expect that it'll be at
Stanford. I hope that it will.
SI) C omment on your thoughts about life at
Stanford as a whole.
BB: Ibis university is an extraordinary place.
I think that anybody who comes here —
whether you're the AD or a faculty member
or a student or somebody affiliated in some
other way — it's important that you embrace

what Stanford is.
You can't come in and resist what Stan
ford is, you have to embrace it. It's an ex
traordinary place populated with amazing
people doing some remarkable things. From
the athletics perspective, it's very unique in
the way we go about what we do. Our stu
dent athletes graduate at the same rate as

the rest of the student population, our stu
dent athletes take on lots of extra time in the
pursuit of excellence of their sport but they
are expected to do the same thing in their
classes.

made?
BB: There are lots of things we're working
on. I don't believe we're as good technologi
cally as we need to be. I don't think our Web
sites are as good as they need to be. I think
how we interface with various publics needs
to be improved. I think some of the services
we provide to our various publics could be
more efficient.
It doesn't matter how good the organization
is: there are always ways it can be made bet
ter...Even as successful as we've been, there
are ways we can get better.
SD:Talk about Jim Harbaugh. What was it
about him that made him the right guy for the
job?
BB: lie made the considered decision to
move from professional football to learning
how the college game worked with his move
from the Raiders to the University of San
Diego.
What I heard repeatedly about Jim was
that he was a person who made everyone
around him better. I think that's about as
good a trait one could ask for in a coach. 1
liked his energy and the success he had. More
than anything else. I kept hearing he was a
guy that made everyone around him better,
and I think we found that to be true.
SD: Where were you during the USC victo
ry? What was your initial reaction and how
do you view the win now?
BB: I was at the game. Part of the time I was
in the press box, the second half I was [watch
ing] from the sideline. I was about 30 feet
from Bradford's catch in the end zone. It was
a huge win. Some have called it the biggest
upset in the history of college football, so it's
significant from that standpoint. It was fun to
be a part of that — I think it gives us hope for
the future with what Stanford football can
be. but it still leaves us with a lot of work to be
done.

I was happy for our players, particularly,
and obviously for our coaches. The players
have been through a lot the last two to three
years, and some of them longer than that. It
was nice for them to have a chance to get
some positive feedback.
SI): Comment on former Stanford basketball
coach Mike Montgomery's role in the Ath
letic Department.
BB: Mike's a big part of Stanford athletics
history. We're very glad to have him back and
he'll be working with our staff on fundraising
activities and working on a public relations
standpoint. I expect he'll be serving on some
NCAA committees and providing them with
the benefit of his years of experience — his
years of experience will serve well as a re
source to draw upon.
SI): The recent Brook Lopez suspension
raised the ever-present issue of college ath
letes and their place as students. At a school
like Stanford, how do you balance between
promoting big-time athletics while keeping
intact the fundamental motives of the Uni
versity?
BB: I think that's what makes Stanford spe
cial; we don't compromise in any area. We de
mand that every one of our student athletes
is competitive in the classroom. It's one of the
things that appeals to me about Stanford,
[and| it appeals to our coaches and our stu
dent athletes. I think our standard doesn't
change much from sport to sport or season to
season or person to person. We expect high
achievement in both areas: when that doesn't
happen we have to take the necessary steps.
SI) Is your position at Stanford the pinnacle
for you in terms of your career? Do you have
loftier career aspirations?
BB 1 certainly don't expect to be going any
place. I'm 55 and I don't know how much
longer I'll work, but I expect that it'll be at
Stanford. I hope that it will.
SI) C omment on your thoughts about life at
Stanford as a whole.
BB: Ibis university is an extraordinary place.
I think that anybody who comes here —
whether you're the AD or a faculty member
or a student or somebody affiliated in some
other way — it's important that you embrace

what Stanford is.
You can't come in and resist what Stan
ford is, you have to embrace it. It's an ex
traordinary place populated with amazing
people doing some remarkable things. From
the athletics perspective, it's very unique in
the way we go about what we do. Our stu
dent athletes graduate at the same rate as

the rest of the student population, our stu
dent athletes take on lots of extra time in the
pursuit of excellence of their sport but they
are expected to do the same thing in their
classes.

Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby accepts the NCAA Sports Academy Director's Cup dur
ing halftime of Stanford's football game against Arizona State in September.
Originally published on November 7,2007
In just his second full year as Stanford's
Athletic Director. Bob Bowlsby has already
made waves. After last year's horrendous 1-
11 football campaign, he pulled the plug on
second-year coach Walt Harris and hired up
start Jim Harbaugh, a move which already
appears to have paid dividends. Bowslby, 55,
seems to have a knack for big-time football
hires: while at lowa, he was responsible for
hiring Kirk Ferentz.
Bowlsby sat down recently with The Daily
for a question-and-answer session, discussing
various topics ranging from life on ITie Farm
to Mike Montgomery to Jim Harbaugh.
Stanford Daily: Try to describe- the pressures
of working as the Athletic Director at the
big-time. Division I level.
Bob Bowlsby: 1 don't know. I've been man
aging a Division l-A athletics program for
most of the last 20 years. The things that go
with it are the things that go with it. h has its
pressures like any other thing on campus, or
any other job. I don't spend much /time/
thinking about it to tell you the truth.
SD: What was the change like coming from
lowa to here? What motivated you to come
out West?
BB:There's some things that are a little dif
ferent about living in California. We live on
campus — we really enjoy being close to
campus and close to the activities.
More than anything else, what attracted
me to Stanford was the merger of world-class
academics and world-class athletics. Qui pro
grams are comprised of outstanding students
and it's a new set of challenges. Some of the
things that were easy at lowa are difficult
here and some of the things that were diffi
cult at lowa are relatively easy here.
SI): What major changes, if any. have you en
acted since taking over for Ted Leland in
April 2006? What is the biggest difference
about Stanford now that you're around?
BB: 1 wouldn't say it's radically different.
What I found here was a culture of high
achievement, a culture of doing things the
right way.Those are both difficult to create if

they're not already there.That's a great foun
dation for a program, and it probably existed
before Ted got here, but he certainly en
hanced it and nurtured it. We've made some
changes to fundraising and the business as
pects of the program, but fundamentally,
there haven't been radical changes required.
SD: What changes would you still like to see
made?
BB: There are lots of things we're working
on. I don't believe we're as good technologi
cally as we need to be. I don't think our Web
sites are as good as they need to be. I think
