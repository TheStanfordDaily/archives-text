# Senior Impact

In terms of Stanford basketball, Fred
Washington has seen it all. I le's seen
the highs. A fifth-year forward.
Washington was recruited by and
played a year under legendary Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. Washing
ton saw limited minutes but played on a
team that won 30 games and was ranked
No.l in the nation.
He's also seen the lows. During the
2005-06 campaign he played only six
games before undergoing knee surgery,
watching on the sidelines as the team
sputtered into the NIT with a 16-14
record.
Washington's fellow seniors, Taj Fin
ger, Peter Prowitt and Kenny Brown,
never played under Montgomery. But all
four entered the program during an era of
great success and high expectations, only
to struggle under a transition period with
Trent Johnson.
Yet as each takes the floor for the final
time at Maples this weekend. Stanford is
once again a top-ten team. With the pro
gram again a contender in the Pac-10, and
perhaps beyond, the team in many re
spects reflects the influence and impact of
its senior leaders.
Taj Finger
Showing up on the Farm as a skinny 6-
8 forward from Mt. Kisko, N.Y., Finger
carved out a niche as an energy-providing
spark off the bench. While he averaged
gaudy numbers (18 points, 12 rebounds, 8
blocks, 5 steals and 4.5 assists) in high
school. Finger soon found and embraced
his role as the hustle player, the type of
guy every coach wants on his team.
Finger often looked to the senior lead
ers of those Cardinal squads, players like
Rob Little and now-assistant coach Nick
Robinson. Over the years, as he began to
assume the mantle of leadership himself,
he emulated the style of Chris Hernan
dez, the demanding point guard who
would often lead by example.
"Everyone thinks the world of Chris,"
Finger said. "If I could be thought of like
Chris Hernandez, that would be pretty
cool."
Like Hernandez, Finger's intensity is
one of his defining traits. His propensity
to dive for rebounds and loose balls
quickly endeared him to the Maples
Pavilion faithful.
A team co-captain. Finger has enjoyed
a good relationship with head coach Trent
Johnson since the two first came to the
Farm in 2004. Perhaps more than any
other player. Finger has epitomized John
son's hard-nosed, defensive style of play.
"He kind of gets me, and I get him,"
Finger said of his coach. "We get along
real well."

Johnson, for his part, described Finger
as "passionate" and"the ultimate team
guy."
Much as his coach repeats the mantra
to take the season "one game at a time,"
Finger is not dwelling much on his final
home stand in a Stanford jersey. He plans
to play overseas somewhere after gradua
tion. but for now. Finger has his sights set
squarely on winning against Washington.
"If you get caught up in all that stuff
you probably won't play as well." he said
of the pre-game Senior Night festivities."l
probably won't really think about it until
the game's over."
Fred Washington
Along with the ups and downs in the
win and loss columns, Washington has
seen just about every injury there is. He's
had three surgeries, one on his wrist, one
on one knee and two on another. Just this
season, the Los Angeles native has strug
gled with bronchitis, pulled a groin and
jammed a thumb several times.
Dealing with the injuries, as well as the
sometimes-difficult transition from
Montgomery to Johnson, has served
Washington well. "I'm better suited to no
tice the good stuff more, and kind of block
out the bad stuff," he said.
One thing he blocks out is the 2005-
2006 campaign. Recovering from knee in
jury. he kept his distance while the team
struggled with injuries and a lack of cohe
siveness.
"I say I wasn't there," is his reply when
someone brings up the season. "That year
is blank for me."
Since then, both Washington and the
team have recovered. The growth of
Mitch Johnson. Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Hill, as well as the arrival of
Brook and Robin Lopez, helped the team
rebound from the disappointing NIT sea
son in 2006. Washington, meanwhile,
started all 31 games while developing a
reputation as one of the team's best ball
handlers, most valuable perimeter de
fenders and hardest workers.
"What he goes through to get himself
prepared to play, prepared to practice, it's
special," Johnson said. "He's stubborn in a
very very good way. He speaks his mind in
a very very good way."
For Washington, shifting expectations
has also taken work.
"I thought we were going to win the
Pac-10 title every year," he said. "I got
greedy ... It's been weird to start off at
the very very top. then go pretty far down,
then come back up."
While he's not sure what exactly lies in
his future plans — he may play overseas,
and says he'll likely eventually attend law
school — Washington will check in on his
former teammates next season to make
sure the progress continues.

Fred Washington highlights a senior class that includes Taj Finger, Peter Prowitt and Kenny
Brown. The foursome has provided valuable depth off the bench for the Cardinal for years.
Stanford will be good after the
twins," he said of the team's
prospects if Brook and Robin
Lopez declare for the NBA Draft.
"They'll find a way."
Kenny Brown
A self-described "late bloomer"
in high school. Brown was not re
cruited by any colleges. The South
lake,Tex., native took the initiative,
however, and sent materials to sev
eral Division-I coaches.
Mike Montgomery was one who
took notice. Even after Mont
gomery's departure to the NBA,
Brown talked with Johnson and
earned an invitation to Stanford's
morning workout in the fall of his
freshman year. Soon after, he had
worked his way onto the team as a
walk-on.
Brown played sparingly his first
two seasons at Stanford, but the
sweet-shooting guard broke out last
year with a 22-point performance
against Arizona on March 3. With
several of his teammates battling
food poisoning, he seized the mo
ment and hit four three-pointers, in
cluding a game-tying shot with 6.1
seconds left in regulation, although
the team eventually fell 85-80 in
overtime.
"I was joking around before the
game, seeing if I could administer
I Vs," the human biology major said.
"I had no idea what was to come."
Brown emerged as a viable op
tion off the bench, however, and
soon became a fan favorite for his

penchant for hitting the longball.
The 6th Man honored him with calls
for "Downtown Kenny Brown."
While Johnson was finally able
to offer him a scholarship for next
season. Brown will attend dental
school at Baylor University.
"I've gotten a lot of stuff from
Stanford, the exposure to great
players ... academically, you can't
put into words how much I've bene
fited from that," he said. "A school
of this caliber will get you a lot of
places."
Peter Prowitt
What can Brown do for Prowitt?
A little dental work wouldn't hurt.
Served with the unenviable duty
of guarding the Lopez twins in prac
tice, Prowitt lost his two front teeth
courtesy of a Brook Lopez elbow
for his troubles during a scrimmage
last spring.
"I looked like I was from Vir
ginia at that point," the Arlington,
Va., native said.
After a promising first two sea
sons on the Farm, Prowitt suffered a
broken bone in his right knee his
last fall. By the time he recovered,
the Lopez twins had assumed most
of the big man minutes in the rota
tion — leaving Prowitt the role of
guarding them in practice, which is
"a full time job," he said.
"College basketball is kind of a
baptism by fire," the political sci
ence major, currently interviewing
for Teach For America, said. "I'm
grateful for my experience."
Said Washington: "It's just a mir
acle he's still alive."

Brown talked with Johnson and
earned an invitation to Stanford's
morning workout in the fall of his
freshman year. Soon after, he had
worked his way onto the team as a

Brown played sparingly his first
two seasons at Stanford, but the
sweet-shooting guard broke out last
year with a 22-point performance
against Arizona on March 3. With
several of his teammates battling
food poisoning, he seized the mo

for "Downtown Kenny Brown."
While Johnson was finally able
to offer him a scholarship for next
season. Brown will attend dental
school at Baylor University.
"I've gotten a lot of stuff from
Stanford, the exposure to great
players ... academically, you can't
put into words how much I've bene
fited from that," he said. "A school
of this caliber will get you a lot of
places."
Peter Prowitt
What can Brown do for Prowitt?
A little dental work wouldn't hurt.
Served with the unenviable duty
of guarding the Lopez twins in prac

courtesy of a Brook Lopez elbow
for his troubles during a scrimmage
last spring.
"I looked like I was from Vir
ginia at that point," the Arlington,
Va., native said.
After a promising first two sea
sons on the Farm, Prowitt suffered a
broken bone in his right knee his
last fall. By the time he recovered,
the Lopez twins had assumed most
of the big man minutes in the rota
tion — leaving Prowitt the role of
guarding them in practice, which is
"a full time job," he said.
"College basketball is kind of a
baptism by fire," the political sci

In terms of Stanford basketball, Fred
Washington has seen it all. I le's seen
the highs. A fifth-year forward.
Washington was recruited by and
played a year under legendary Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. Washing
ton saw limited minutes but played on a
team that won 30 games and was ranked
No.l in the nation.
He's also seen the lows. During the
2005-06 campaign he played only six
games before undergoing knee surgery,
watching on the sidelines as the team
sputtered into the NIT with a 16-14
record.
Washington's fellow seniors, Taj Fin
ger, Peter Prowitt and Kenny Brown,
never played under Montgomery. But all
four entered the program during an era of
great success and high expectations, only
to struggle under a transition period with
Trent Johnson.
Yet as each takes the floor for the final
time at Maples this weekend. Stanford is
once again a top-ten team. With the pro
gram again a contender in the Pac-10, and
perhaps beyond, the team in many re
spects reflects the influence and impact of
its senior leaders.
Taj Finger
Showing up on the Farm as a skinny 6-
8 forward from Mt. Kisko, N.Y., Finger
carved out a niche as an energy-providing
spark off the bench. While he averaged
gaudy numbers (18 points, 12 rebounds, 8
blocks, 5 steals and 4.5 assists) in high
school. Finger soon found and embraced
his role as the hustle player, the type of
guy every coach wants on his team.
Finger often looked to the senior lead
ers of those Cardinal squads, players like
Rob Little and now-assistant coach Nick
Robinson. Over the years, as he began to
assume the mantle of leadership himself,
he emulated the style of Chris Hernan
dez, the demanding point guard who
would often lead by example.
"Everyone thinks the world of Chris,"
Finger said. "If I could be thought of like
Chris Hernandez, that would be pretty
cool."
Like Hernandez, Finger's intensity is
one of his defining traits. His propensity
to dive for rebounds and loose balls
quickly endeared him to the Maples
Pavilion faithful.
A team co-captain. Finger has enjoyed
a good relationship with head coach Trent
Johnson since the two first came to the
Farm in 2004. Perhaps more than any
other player. Finger has epitomized John
son's hard-nosed, defensive style of play.
"He kind of gets me, and I get him,"
Finger said of his coach. "We get along
real well."

Johnson, for his part, described Finger
as "passionate" and"the ultimate team
guy."
Much as his coach repeats the mantra
to take the season "one game at a time,"
Finger is not dwelling much on his final
home stand in a Stanford jersey. He plans
to play overseas somewhere after gradua
tion. but for now. Finger has his sights set
squarely on winning against Washington.
"If you get caught up in all that stuff
you probably won't play as well." he said
of the pre-game Senior Night festivities."l
probably won't really think about it until
the game's over."
Fred Washington
Along with the ups and downs in the
win and loss columns, Washington has
seen just about every injury there is. He's
had three surgeries, one on his wrist, one
on one knee and two on another. Just this
season, the Los Angeles native has strug
gled with bronchitis, pulled a groin and
jammed a thumb several times.
Dealing with the injuries, as well as the
sometimes-difficult transition from
Montgomery to Johnson, has served
Washington well. "I'm better suited to no
tice the good stuff more, and kind of block
out the bad stuff," he said.
One thing he blocks out is the 2005-
2006 campaign. Recovering from knee in
jury. he kept his distance while the team
struggled with injuries and a lack of cohe
siveness.
"I say I wasn't there," is his reply when
someone brings up the season. "That year
is blank for me."
Since then, both Washington and the
team have recovered. The growth of
Mitch Johnson. Anthony Goods and
Lawrence Hill, as well as the arrival of
Brook and Robin Lopez, helped the team
rebound from the disappointing NIT sea
son in 2006. Washington, meanwhile,
started all 31 games while developing a
reputation as one of the team's best ball
handlers, most valuable perimeter de
fenders and hardest workers.
"What he goes through to get himself
prepared to play, prepared to practice, it's
special," Johnson said. "He's stubborn in a
very very good way. He speaks his mind in
a very very good way."
For Washington, shifting expectations
has also taken work.
"I thought we were going to win the
Pac-10 title every year," he said. "I got
greedy ... It's been weird to start off at
the very very top. then go pretty far down,
then come back up."
While he's not sure what exactly lies in
his future plans — he may play overseas,
and says he'll likely eventually attend law
school — Washington will check in on his
former teammates next season to make
sure the progress continues.

Brown. The foursome has provided valuable depth off the bench for the Cardinal for years.
Stanford will be good after the
twins," he said of the team's
prospects if Brook and Robin
Lopez declare for the NBA Draft.
"They'll find a way."
Kenny Brown
A self-described "late bloomer"
in high school. Brown was not re
cruited by any colleges. The South
lake,Tex., native took the initiative,
however, and sent materials to sev
eral Division-I coaches.
Mike Montgomery was one who
