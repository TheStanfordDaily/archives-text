One stroke was the deciding factor as the
sixth-ranked men's Stanford golf team narrowly
missed national glory this past weekend at the
NCAA Championships, held at Purdue Universi
ty's Kampen Course. Stanford was only a putt
away from becoming the first team in nearly
twenty years to repeat as national champions,
falling to the new national champion, UCLA.The
Cardinal fired a strong 43-over 1195 hut it just
wasn't enough to overcome Kevin Chappell and
the rest of the Bruin competitors.
Stanford, Clemson, UCLA and USC provided
an exciting finish to four days of grueling compe
tition between the top collegiate golf teams in the
nation. Going into the final holes of the tourna
ment. the four teams were all in the running to
take the national crown and it was anybody's
game. Stanford would have to deal with a strong
wind from the west but finished its final round
tirst posting a 14-over 302, the lowest scoring
round of all three teams on the day.
The next few hours of the tournament would
decide the team's season. Clemson finished next
with a 24-over 310 that solidified a fourth place
finish which left the cross-town rivals to compete
for bragging rights and the title of the best team in
the nation. With Stanford eagerly waiting in the
wings, the IVojans bent to pressure and finished
just one stroke behind the Cardinal, leaving the
title decision to the final team on the green.
UCLA's Chappell almost mis-stepped by dou

got serious and became the hero of the day for the
Bruins, taking an even par score on the final hole
to dash Stanford's hopes and seize the NCAA
team and individual titles.
"1 was thinking about four or five guys playing
those last three holes,' head coach Conrad Ray
told GoStanford.com directly following the tour
nament." If you can play those holes a couple over
... based on what the scores were it seemed like
40 or 41 [over-par] was going to have a really good
chance. We needed a little help there at the end
and didn't get it. but hats off to UCLA. They
played solid all week and really did it when they
needed to."
Freshman Sihwan Kim led the Cardinal to its
top national finish, tabbing an eagle on the ninth
hole and firing a one-under 71 for the final round
to conclude his first NCAA Tournament in a tie
for fourth place. Kim began the final round of the
tournament in a tie for 17th with a seven-over 223
but stepped up when he needed to.
