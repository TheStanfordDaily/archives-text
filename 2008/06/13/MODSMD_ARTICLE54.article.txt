On paper, the Burdette sisters,
sophomore Lindsay and Erin
'05, are as close as you can get.
Both highly-touted recruits for the Stan
ford women's tennis program, Lindsay and
Erin come from a tennis-strong family from
their parents down to their siblings.
In her four years at Stanford, Erin
proved herself on the collegiate stage, be
coming a four-time All-American with a
118-30 career overall record. She is also No.
15 in Stanford history with 77 career dual
victories.
Last season, younger sister Lindsay was
just entering Stanford as an unproven fresh
man. already with high expectations for her
game.
On top of the pressure, Lindsay was the
only freshman on an experienced squad and
had been home-schooled for her last three
years of high school.
"It was definitely hard at times, and I felt
that it took me until the end of fall quarter
to really feel connected and part of the
team," Lindsay said.
"But if it was going to happen to anyone
on the team, the best person would be me
because of Erin and the history that I
learned about from her," she added. "I felt
that I knew a lot about what the team ex
pected and what it would require as far as
effort and time."
Responding to the challenges around
her, Burdette began her collegiate career
with four consecutive wins and a runner-up
finish at the Saint Mary's Invitational last
October.
A year later. Lindsay has certainly lived
up to her sister's standards; the numbers
don't lie.
Both sisters were honored as Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) Singles All-
Americans after their respective freshman
campaigns. Both also finished their seasons
ranked No. 13 in the final ITA doubles rank
ings. losing in the quarterfinals of their re
spective NCAA Doubles Championships
(2002 and 2007).
Erin had a 43-7 overall record including
a 25-1 mark in dual match competition,
while Lindsay was 31-6 overall with an 18-2
dual match record.
Erin was 4-0 in NCAA Tournament
play, and made the semifinals of the NCAA
Singles Championships; Lindsay was 2-0
(most likely 3-0 had her final match not been
cut short) and made the quarterfinals


Sophomore Lindsay Burdette is carrying on the Stanford tradition in her family as the Cardinal women's tennis
team looks for its fourth title in five years this season.
