On paper, the Burdette sisters,
sophomore Lindsay and Erin
'05, are as close as you can get.
Both highly-touted recruits for the Stan
ford women's tennis program, Lindsay and
Erin come from a tennis-strong family from
their parents down to their siblings.
In her four years at Stanford, Erin
proved herself on the collegiate stage, be
coming a four-time All-American with a
118-30 career overall record. She is also No.
15 in Stanford history with 77 career dual
victories.
Last season, younger sister Lindsay was
just entering Stanford as an unproven fresh
man. already with high expectations for her
game.
On top of the pressure, Lindsay was the
only freshman on an experienced squad and
had been home-schooled for her last three
years of high school.
"It was definitely hard at times, and I felt
that it took me until the end of fall quarter
to really feel connected and part of the
team," Lindsay said.
"But if it was going to happen to anyone
on the team, the best person would be me
because of Erin and the history that I
learned about from her," she added. "I felt
that I knew a lot about what the team ex
pected and what it would require as far as
effort and time."
Responding to the challenges around
her, Burdette began her collegiate career
with four consecutive wins and a runner-up
finish at the Saint Mary's Invitational last
October.
A year later. Lindsay has certainly lived
up to her sister's standards; the numbers
don't lie.
Both sisters were honored as Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) Singles All-
Americans after their respective freshman
campaigns. Both also finished their seasons
ranked No. 13 in the final ITA doubles rank
ings. losing in the quarterfinals of their re
spective NCAA Doubles Championships
(2002 and 2007).
Erin had a 43-7 overall record including
a 25-1 mark in dual match competition,
while Lindsay was 31-6 overall with an 18-2
dual match record.
Erin was 4-0 in NCAA Tournament
play, and made the semifinals of the NCAA
Singles Championships; Lindsay was 2-0
(most likely 3-0 had her final match not been
cut short) and made the quarterfinals


Sophomore Lindsay Burdette is carrying on the Stanford tradition in her family as the Cardinal women's tennis
team looks for its fourth title in five years this season.
of the Championships before losing
to Miami's No. 1 Audra Cohen.
Though it is safe to say that both
Lindsay and Erin are pretty much
identical on paper, Lindsay dis
agrees.
"The numbers are similar," Lind
say said, "but everything else isn't."
In fact, their personalities and
playing styles could not be any more
different.
"Erin is very shy, very reserved
and very quiet," Burdette said.
"Everybody loves her because she's
genuine and an extremely hard
worker."

"That also translated into her
game," Lindsay continued. "Erin
would fight and scrap it out to the
very end for as long as it took. She
had great volleys, great serves, but in
singles she was more at the baseline."
Lindsay, on the other hand, is
quite the opposite.
"I'm much more outgoing and
aggressive and that comes out in my
game." Lindsay said. "1 really get to
the net a lot in singles, and I play a
much more attacking game style."
Moreover. Lindsay hopes to sur
pass the feats of her sister by the
time her career is over.
In her junior year, Erin was
poised to garner a number of indi
vidual honors, cementing her name
into the Stanford record books.
But, after an unfortunate back
hand. Erin required wrist surgery

and sat out the ITA Indoor Champi
onships and the Northwest Regional
Championships. Erin would also sit
out most of her senior year with
shoulder problems, often playing
through pain when necessary.
Lindsay, who has faced similar in
juries, hopes that she is past them for
good. Months before entering Stan
ford. Lindsay opted for wrist sur
gery, which has left her painless
since.
"Everything's been good since
I've had the wrist surgery," l.indsay
said. "I didn't realize it but I had
been suffering from it my whole ten

nis career. And it wasn't until after
I got it fixed that I realized what it
was like to be without pain."
And, while the elder Erin studied
biology during her stay on the Farm,
Lindsay's interests fall into less aca
demically stressful fields, allowing
her to concentrate more on her ten
nis game.
"Erin went through the whole
premed track and it made her tennis
so much tougher with the tons of
work she had." Lindsay said. "Her
labs were always during practice and
usually all of the toughest classes
were offered during spring, right in

the middle of NCA As."
Despite all of the comparisons
and predictions, the Burdette sisters
remain as tightly knit as ever.
"Our relationship has only grown
stronger since she went off to school
and especially since I've been here,"
Lindsay said.
Furthermore, Lindsay welcomes
the friendly competition between
the two.
"We're competitive but it's never
direct," Lindsay said. "It's challeng
ing each other to do better versus
comparing what we've done to each
other. I hope to do the same things as

good or better than she did, but we
don't necessarily dwell on results."
In the end, no matter who sets the
most school records. Lindsay and
Erin will always have a special bond
beyond the courts.
"I feel like Erin's such a huge part
of why I'm here," Lindsay said.
"Erin's always had the unbelievable
work ethic, and she definitely blazed
the trail for me. Whatever I may dif
fer from Erin, I make up for in talent
and Erin's guiding experience."
