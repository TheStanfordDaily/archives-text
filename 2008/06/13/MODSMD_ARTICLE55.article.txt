Missy Penna de
livers. She did it
again last weekend, coming
through in the biggest way when
the team needed her most.
Instead of panicking with
Stanford facing elimination at
the Amherst Regional — and the
end of her junior season — the
star pitcher went out and threw a
no-hitter against a team that had
beaten her just hours earlier to
lead the Cardinal into the Super
Regionals.
Penna struck out nine in the
complete game, but more impor
tantly, she absolutely demoral
ized the University of Massachu
setts Minutewomen. Her per
formance left no doubt that, as
long as she is pitching, Stanford
can beat anyone.
"She is definitely a clutch
player," said sophomore catcher
Rosey Neill. "She knew what she
had to do and the adjustments
she had to make and did a good
job of going out there and getting
them."
Head coach John Rittman
raved about the performance of
his ace.
"Missy was outstanding," he
said. "She pitched to win. She
showed a lot of heart in keeping
her composure after a tough
loss."
This composure is part of
Penna's effectiveness. She retires
her opponents with a cool, calm
demeanor in the circle. You won't
see her pumping her fist or
screaming at teammates — she
lets her pitching do the talking.
Possessing excellent command
on a variety of pitches, she makes
it near impossible for opponents
to get comfortable in the batter's
box.
It is because of this levelhead
ed approach that Penna was able
to stay calm going into the deci
sive game of the Regional.
"I knew if I did my job and
kept them off the bases, my team
would score runs and we would
win," said Penna.
Rittman sees Penna's stoic ap
proach as her form of leadership.
"Missy leads by example," he

said. "She works extremely hard
and everything she says to her
teammates, she means, and she
truly believes we will win every
time out."
Pitching games like that is
nothing new to Penna — who
threw her second no-hitter of the
year — and has put up absolutely
phenomenal numbers all season.
So far this season she has a
school-record 37 wins and 411
strikeouts while boasting an
ERA of just 1.00.
Penna has also become a
workhorse for the Cardinal, hav
ing pitched all four games in the
Regional and 327.2 innings on
the year.
Despite the mileage, Penna
still feels strong.
When asked if she can feel an
effect on her stamina, Penna
smiled and simply said,"not yet."
'ITiat's a good thing, because
with the team heading to College
Station, Texas to take on Texas
A&M in a three-game Super Re
gional. Penna will likely be asked
to pitch every inning against the
No. 5 overall-seeded Aggies.
"1 don't foresee any problem
[with her pitching that much]."
said Rittman."She is used to the
workload from the Pac-10 sea
son, plus she is used to the heat
from growing up in Miami."
Penna corroborated her
coach's claims, and added that
she is extremely excited to be
pitching in the hot weather she
got used to growing up in South
Florida, instead of the rain she
was subjected to in Massachu
setts last weekend.
Penna knows the challenge
will not necessarily be pitching so
much, but being able to adjust as
the opponents become more fa
miliar with each other.
"In the first game I have to go
at them and learn their strengths
and weaknesses so I can make
adjustments as the series contin
ues," said Penna.
On a team in which the hitting
has sometimes looked unstop
pable, and at other times has dis
appeared, Penna has been the
one consistent cog.
The Cardinal will ride her into
the weekend, and if she continues
to pitch the way she has been,
Stanford could soon be punching
its ticket to Oklahoma City and
the College World Series.
