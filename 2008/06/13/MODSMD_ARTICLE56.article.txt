The search for a tasty brew has consumed the
nightlife of college students for eons. Sean Arenson
'OS and Carolyn Mansfield '08, residents in the En
chanted Broccoli Forest (EBF). have an unusually
direct approach to acquiring good beer.They make
it themselves.
ITie EBF brewing adventure began when Mans
field. whose father is a homebrewer, gave her
boyfriend. Johnny DuPont "09, a homebrewing kit
for Christmas. Five brews later, it's a regular part of
their lives and something Arenson says is "easier to
do than someone who's never done it before might
think."
Both students find the activity a perfect fit for
the EBF ethos. "Co-ops are a culture of beer appre
ciation." says Mansfield, citing brewing activity in
other co-op houses, as well. Arenson adds that the
co-op culture of "go smaller" and consumption of
fresh and non-commercial products dovetails nice
ly with EBF's earthy reputation.
I lomebrewing, the private production of beer
for personal enjoyment as opposed to commercial
gain, has taken off in the United States in the last 30
years, reviving a tradition that waned as beer went
from a farmhouse craft to a factor)' operation. It
draws devotees from all walks of life — college stu
dents. blue-collar laborers, urban professionals, en
vironmental stewards and those with a do-it-your
self attitude.
THE WORLD S FIRST REFRESHER
ITiought to be the oldest manufactured bever
age in human history', beer is. by definition, a fer
mented alcoholic substance made by mixing malted
grain, hops, water and yeast. Barley is the most pop
ular grain and the easiest to work with, although
wheat and rye can also be use.
"Brewing" technically refers to the boiling of in
gredients before fermentation, but the art of home
brewing is understood to include choosing a recipe,
managing the boil, pitching the yeast and bottling
and carbonating the beer.
Most agricultural peoples have produced a beer
like beverage, using many types of plants to balance
the sweet malt flavor.The use of the hop flower as a
flavoring and bittering agent became standardized
in beer in the Kith and 17th centuries and was codi
fied in the German Beer Purity Law of 1516.
I lomebrewing in the United States was fully le
galized by Congress in 1978, eliminating a holdover
from Prohibition-era laws. Some states, such as
Utah and Alabama, still prohibit brewing without a
license.

THE START OF SOMETHING BIG
ITie first EBF beer was brewed in January — a
porter, an English dark ale. that consumed not just the
standard ingredients but also a cell phone. After
Arenson insisted on compulsive sanitation at every
step. duPont mistakenly dropped his phone into the
brew just prior to bottling. duPont further threatened
to contaminate the brew by sticking his ami in the
bucket to retrieve the phone.
The brew turned out unharmed, and thus was
born the distinctive name "Cingular Porter." Mans

field said the cell phone store had never before heard
such an explanation for a broken phone.
Arenson was impressed with their first product,
and with duPont studying abroad in Berlin this quar
ter. Arenson has been promoted to unofficial EBF
brewmaster. He promises to do his mentor proud.
"This quarter is going to be a very prolific one."
HOW BREWING IS DONE

The unofficial EBF brew crew advances through various stages of brewing beer from scratch.

The most basic brewing kit, de
signed for a five-gallon batch, includes
a large stove pot, an airlocked fermen
tation bucket and a bottle capper.
Homebrew ingredients can be bought
from several sources. Arenson and
Mansfield buy their stock from a
homebrew store in Los Altos, but sev
eral Bay Area shops and multiple on
line vendors are available for ingredi

ents and equipment, as well as valuable
advice from those with experience.
The basic process of homebrewing
begins with bringing a pot of water to
boil. Water is a critical element in a beer
style; the famously hard water of Eng
lish rivers contributes to British ale
styles, while Pilsner Urquell uses soft
water from world-renowned Czech
wells.
Most homebrewers cannot control
their local water sources, but chemical
supplements are available to approxi
mate some desired mineral profiles.
Malt extract, either powered or
syrup, is added to the boiling water.The

extract provides the sugars that will, in
turn.be fermented into alcohol.
An advanced technique called all
grain brewing involves mashing the
malted grain itself into a porridge, acti
vating the malting enzymes that break
down the starch into fermentable sug
ars. This process duplicates the one
used by commercial breweries, but it
isn't necessary for producing great
tasting beer. Many homebrewers, in
cluding the F:BF crew, get tasty results
from extract brewing.
Hops are added at the beginning
and end of the approximately hour
long boil.

The hop oils are chemically
changed by the boiling process, caus
ing the first batch of hops to add a bit
ter flavor. Hops added at the end of the
boil provide flavor and aroma.
After the liquid, called wort, is
cooled, it is placed in an airlocked
bucket or glass carboy; the yeast is
added (or "pitched"), and the fermen
tation process begins. In an anaerobic
(oxygen-free) process, the yeast con
sumes sugars and produces carbon
dioxide, ethyl alcohol and a slew of fla
vor products. The temperature at
which fermentation occurs, and
whether the yeast strain ferments on
top of the brew or at the bottom, has a
strong effect on the beer flavor.
Primary fermentation completes
after about two days. Hie beer is nor
mally then transferred to another ves
sel and left to settle and clarify for up to
a month. Hops and spice flavorings are
sometimes added in this phase ("dry
hopped") for an extra kick. In addition
to taste and smell, hops provide an
anti-bacterial effect, favoring yeast
growth and acting as a preservative in
the final product.
Finally, the beer is bottled. Carbon
ation is accomplished by adding sugar
to the brew before bottling, which re
activates the yeast. With the bottles
capped, carbon dioxide goes into solu
tion, giving the brew its distinctive fizz.
The beer is drinkable within two
weeks, although aging for up to a year
depending on style can improve its fla
vor.
Meticulous sanitation is required at
every step to ensure the yeast does not
compete with other microbes in the
fermenter — the sort of attention to
detail that Arenson followed until
duPont dropped his phone in the beer.
An infected batch is not usually dan
gerous to the drinker, it just tastes bad;
in almost all cases, multiplying yeast
"crowd out" other species, and con
tamination is rare.
As used glass bottles from store
bought beers can be reused, home

brewers tend to become inveterate
scroungers; according to Arenson.
"you find yourself asking someone
drinking a beer,' Can I have that bottle
when you're finished?"'
DONT CRAMP YOUR STYLE
Ilie explosion in American home
brewing in the 1980s was a factor in the
rise of microbrewing and craft brewing
(similar terms for the commercial pro
duction of moderate quantities of
quality-focused beer),exposing Amer
icans to a slew of styles then unavail
able in mass-produced products. Cali
fornia and Portland have become par
ticularly remarkable in the microbrew
industry.
A variant of craft brewing is the
brewpub. where beer is made on the
premises and served in conjunction
with a restaurant. Gordon Biersch
Brewery Restaurant, originating in
Palo Alto, is an example of a brewpub.
"California is such a fertile ground
for homebrewing and craftbrewing."
Arenson said. "There's such a varia
tion of styles...beer blows wine out of
the water with regard to diversity of
styles." With all of this high-quality
beer around, Sean has not missed the
opportunity to evangelize. He often
purchases a collection of beers and
holds tasting events for fellow stu
dents.
College kids who have swilled
down Natural Light for years are usu
ally in for a pleasant surprise. Arenson
says that after presenting a range of
styles, even his beer-averse subjects
normally find one or two beers they
enjoy.
While the exact ingredients used in
commercial beers are trade secrets,
"clone brew" recipes allow brewers to
emulate popular products. But homer
brewing also provides the freedom to
tinker with classic styles and recipes,
adjusting the grain, hops and yeast to
the brewer's taste and creating entire
ly new flavors with the addition of fruit
or spices.

MO'MONEY
An ingredient kit for a five-gallon
batch — about 40 twelve-ounce bot
tles — typically costs between $30 and
$50, making homebrew costs competi
tive with store prices for microbrewed
six-packs.
The prices, however, are on the rise.
The brewing industry has been rocked
by a massive world hop shortage stem
ming from a destructive European
winter, a decline in farmland used for
hops, and a selling out of hop reserves.
Some varieties are simply not avail
able, and others have seen fivefold
price increases.
Microbreweries and homebrewers.
masters of highly hopped styles and
lacking guaranteed contracts with hop
distributors, have been hit the hardest.
The cost has been passed on to con
sumers. who have already seen price
increases and will likely feel the
squeeze for at least another year.
MORE THAN A HOBBY
Even as a biology major. Arenson
sees his hobby as a fuzzy enterprise."!
view brewing as more of an art than a
science, which is interesting because,"
despite being a jazz musician,"l have
no artistic talent."
He did compare it to his alternate
life:"There are parallels between jazz
and brewing — there's a lot of im
provisation, in each batch you do
something different, and the mood
you are in is reflected in the brew."
The hobby can also have health
benefits. Homebrewed beer is made
with a handful of ingredients without
the preservatives of mass-produced
beer. Age, handling and freshness can
be controlled by the brewers them
selves, something not possible with
mass-produced beers shipped across
the country. Because of the presence
of yeast normally filtered out by com
mercial breweries, which provide B
vitamins, homebrewed beer is one of
the most beneficial alcoholic bever
ages one can drink — particularly
when it comes to keeping away a
hangover.
Between brewing and tastings,
Arenson and Mansfield are driven by
the appreciation of fine beer that mo
tivates many homebrewers. Arenson
encourages the curious to give it a try.
"People assume it requires smoke
stacks and everything. It's just like any
food product: you can do it in your own
kitchen...they should really dive in in
stead of being intimidated."
