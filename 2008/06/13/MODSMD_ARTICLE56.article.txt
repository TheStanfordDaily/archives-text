The search for a tasty brew has consumed the
nightlife of college students for eons. Sean Arenson
'OS and Carolyn Mansfield '08, residents in the En
chanted Broccoli Forest (EBF). have an unusually
direct approach to acquiring good beer.They make
it themselves.
ITie EBF brewing adventure began when Mans
field. whose father is a homebrewer, gave her
boyfriend. Johnny DuPont "09, a homebrewing kit
for Christmas. Five brews later, it's a regular part of
their lives and something Arenson says is "easier to
do than someone who's never done it before might
think."
Both students find the activity a perfect fit for
the EBF ethos. "Co-ops are a culture of beer appre
ciation." says Mansfield, citing brewing activity in
other co-op houses, as well. Arenson adds that the
co-op culture of "go smaller" and consumption of
fresh and non-commercial products dovetails nice
ly with EBF's earthy reputation.
I lomebrewing, the private production of beer
for personal enjoyment as opposed to commercial
gain, has taken off in the United States in the last 30
years, reviving a tradition that waned as beer went
from a farmhouse craft to a factor)' operation. It
draws devotees from all walks of life — college stu
dents. blue-collar laborers, urban professionals, en
vironmental stewards and those with a do-it-your
self attitude.
THE WORLD S FIRST REFRESHER
ITiought to be the oldest manufactured bever
age in human history', beer is. by definition, a fer
mented alcoholic substance made by mixing malted
grain, hops, water and yeast. Barley is the most pop
ular grain and the easiest to work with, although
wheat and rye can also be use.
"Brewing" technically refers to the boiling of in
gredients before fermentation, but the art of home
brewing is understood to include choosing a recipe,
managing the boil, pitching the yeast and bottling
and carbonating the beer.
Most agricultural peoples have produced a beer
like beverage, using many types of plants to balance
the sweet malt flavor.The use of the hop flower as a
flavoring and bittering agent became standardized
in beer in the Kith and 17th centuries and was codi
fied in the German Beer Purity Law of 1516.
I lomebrewing in the United States was fully le
galized by Congress in 1978, eliminating a holdover
from Prohibition-era laws. Some states, such as
Utah and Alabama, still prohibit brewing without a
license.

THE START OF SOMETHING BIG
ITie first EBF beer was brewed in January — a
porter, an English dark ale. that consumed not just the
standard ingredients but also a cell phone. After
Arenson insisted on compulsive sanitation at every
step. duPont mistakenly dropped his phone into the
brew just prior to bottling. duPont further threatened
to contaminate the brew by sticking his ami in the
bucket to retrieve the phone.
The brew turned out unharmed, and thus was
born the distinctive name "Cingular Porter." Mans

field said the cell phone store had never before heard
such an explanation for a broken phone.
Arenson was impressed with their first product,
and with duPont studying abroad in Berlin this quar
ter. Arenson has been promoted to unofficial EBF
brewmaster. He promises to do his mentor proud.
"This quarter is going to be a very prolific one."
