# The 						new business of golf

—4 his is an unusual Wednesday Usually,
despite the cold, the rain and the early
hour, you'd find students gearing up to
play. Those braving the conditions on a
day like this would be the core golfers.
Kelly Sortino GSB '08 would be here, brushing
curly hair out of her eyes, and Alex Robertson GSB
'08. adjusting his red cap.These are the golfers who
are on the course no matter what.
But today, they're instead three miles away on
the concrete campus of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB). A holiday has shifted
GSB classes from Monday to Wednesday, the stu
dents' usual day off. On a typical Wednesday, when
the weather is good, there are 15 to 20 foursomes of
GSB students out on the course. Some of the stu
dents, like Robertson and Sortino, will go out be
cause they started when they were eight years old.
they love it, and it's part of who they are. But many
GSB students who have little prior experience with
golf will also make their way out to learn how to
Play-
Sarah Garrett GSB '08 is one of them. She never
even thought about playing golf until she got to the
GSB. "Everybody said, 'You have to play golf. You
have to try out the golf course because it's so beau
tiful, and as a student you have incredible access
and it's affordable.'" She worked the for-profit sec
tor over the summer and regretted not being able
to participate in the golf activities organized by her
company. She decided to make lessons a priority. In
the fall she took a beginner golf class filled with
mostly GSB students who, like her, wanted to get in
the game.
The affinity that GSB students have for golf is
not purely recreational, although their motivations
are less self-serving than those outside of golf and
business might believe. For many, the fact that GSB
students have Wednesdays off from classes seems
to be an implicit encouragement to pursue golf.
This creates a discomfiting picture of young stu
dents eager to conform to the rich golfing business
man stereotype, eager to break into those elitist
networks.
Robertson, co-president of the GSB Student
Golf Club, finds new students coming to the club to
forward their careers. "It's because they're here,
they know — they think two things: that business
revolves around golf or golf revolves around busi

ness."
The reality is less straightforward. Rukaiyah
Adams GSH '08. who also took her first golf class in
the fall, says that she's just trying to eliminate as
many barriers as possible. The students at the GSB
from more privileged backgrounds have all sorts of
connections and skills that help them in the busi
ness world. Golf is just one of these, and access to it
can help. "It's just another tool," Adams says."I
thought/Why not?"'
There are some practical reasons why golf goes
well with business. It is a sport that lends itself to so
cializing. Sortino says,"l hit the ball 10 percent of the
time, and the other 90 percent I'm talking to the peo
ple around me, and I'm getting to know them bet
ter." Spending time with someone on the green gives
you a sense of their character — how they react
when things go wrong, and how they respond under
pressure.
Despite these advantages, the caricature associ
ated with the sport can be uncomfortable to new
players. "Close your eyes," Robertson says. "You're
walking down the street and you see a golfer. He's
got khakis on, a vibrantly colored polo, a slight
golfer's gut, short hair, a nice polo cap and pink
socks." What person could fit in that outfit but an
older white man?
There is a historical basis for this image. Until
1961, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA)
had a clause stating that "Membership in the PGA
shall be limited to members of the Caucasian race."
Even after that codified barrier was lifted, logistical
barriers continued to hinder diversification of the
sport. A survey of professional courses by USA
Today found that the average initiation fee for golf
course membership was nearly $50,000, limiting
those who have access to relatively few very rich
people.
Yet the worlds of golf and business are begin
ning to diversify. At Stanford's GSB, there is also a
move towards diversity. In the MBA class of 2009.
women make up 38 percent of the class, six percent
age points more than in 2008. There is also an in
crease in minority students — in the class of 2008,
one in six students was a member of a minority
group; in 2009, it's close to one in every four. These
numbers illustrate a larger trend across the country
in which women and minorities are becoming more
and more of a presence in the business world.
Ibese changes at the GSB can be seen on the
green. For Jim Miller, who has been a Stanford golf
instructor for 14 years, the diversity of his students
is a big reason he loves being at Stanford. "We're
teaching students from all over the world, many of

whom have had little or no access previously."
Garrett found that to be true when she took her
beginning golf class. "We're all coming from com
pletely different backgrounds and want to learn it
for similar reasons and so there's that sense of
shared experience."'
One reason why the Stanford course attracts
such a diverse group is its accessibility. The course
is right on campus and costs only $20 a round, re
moving the usual access barriers. The course's en
couragement of beginners and large selection of
classes can also be an important entry point. Either
you learn as a kid, or you learn in graduate school.
Beyond that, opportunities to learn golf are hard to
find.
The Stanford course also has a history of diver
sity. It has been played by some of the best minori
ty players in the country, including Tom Watson,
Tiger Woods and now Michelle Wie '11.
Woods certainly made golf visible to minority
athletes. According to Adams, Woods' major im
pact was highlighting how much fun the sport was.
She sees higher minority participation in golf as
part of a shift in what people consider to be fun, one
occurring among white students and minority stu
dents alike. "The Black Business Students Associa
tion must have 25 or more non-black students in it,"
she says. "Everyone's really exploring and trying to
do things that help us understand each other bet
ter."
Despite these positive trends, national efforts to
make golf instruction and membership more acces
sible have been slow. Although the old guard is not
actively resisting, it is slow to recognize the need for
changes in the sport to allow for new people. Golf
ing with a group of beginners at Stanford, Garrett
has occasionally felt the annoyance of a group of
older men stuck behind them. "There's a sense of
'What are these kids who don't know what they're
doing playing out here?"'
Yet even some of the more experienced golfers
are breaking the demographic stereotype. "People
don't look at me and see a typical golfer," Sortino
says, wearing a red vest and carrying a bag full of
binders and fortune cookies. She grew up in Illinois,
where her family played on the local course. They
didn't have country club memberships, and Sortino
didn't have private lessons. Instead, she learned by
reading books and watching television. Sortino is
quite a golfer — she played all through high school
and then on Princeton's varsity team for two years
before ending up at the GSB.

Kelly Sortino GSB '08 competed in last year's Challenge for Charity with
nine west coast business schools, including Stanford's Graduate School
of Business.
Her background in golf has been
advantageous for her business ca
reer, especially in the job search.
"Twenty minutes of our interview
will be spent talking about golf. For
women who don't have any kind of
background or interest in it, there's
just not that conversation." When
she turned down one job, the com
pany actually asked her to recon
sider because they really needed
her for its golf team.
Although Garrett has just
begun, she expects in the next few
years to continue the sport as she
enters into the work world. "I'm
very much a beginner, but 1 really
enjoy the sport in all aspects," she
says."I hope that I'm good enough
when I leave here to able to use it in
business in the next few years."
On the course, the sun is starting
to rise, the morning frost is melting,
and the old-timers head out to start
their Wednesday games. Next year,
with the intensity of their first year
of business school behind them, the
uncommonly diverse MBA stu
dents of 200 1 ) might head out to the
green. Among them, people who
have never had a chance to see a
course might find out why the core
players keep coming back. They
might get a sense of the fun of the
sport.
They will soon come onto the
ninth hole, Sortino's favorite. "You
can see San Francisco, you can al
most see Oakland, you see Portola
Valley, and the hills, it's just — it's
stunning. That image will be im
planted in my brain forever."
