## Hoover photo error found

A collection of photographs
housed at the Hoover Institution has
recently become a source of a minor
international controversy.
Ten photographs housed at the
Hoover Archives purported to show
the aftermath of the 1945 atomic
bomb attack on Hiroshima. The
photographs showed scenes of dev
astation and destruction, including
human bodies — a relative rarity in
Hiroshima photography. Sean Mal
loy Ph.D. '02, an assistant professor
of history at UC- Merced, obtained
the photographs from the Hoover
Archives for illustrative use in his
book, entitled "Atomic Tragedy:
Henry L. Stimson and the Decision
to Use the Bomb against Japan."The
photographs drew attention after
Malloy put them on the Internet in
late April, and received coverage in
the French newspaper Le Monde on
May 10.
Only one problem — the photo
graphs actually depicted devastation
following the 1923 Kanto Earth
quake.
Malloy received information
from the Hiroshima Peace Memori

al Museum on May 12 that con
vinced him the photographs were
actually of the earthquake after
math. Malloy pulled the photo
graphs from his Web site and con
tacted his publisher. Hoover and Le
Monde to inform them of the error.
On May 14 both Hoover and Le
Monde printed statements regard
ing the error.
Malloy explained that the photo
graphs' human dimension initially
drew him to the photographs.
"They were, in many ways, quite
unique," Malloy said. "The vast ma
jority of photographs taken are
months after and do not contain
people."
"Certainly they were striking," he
added, "though obviously in retro
spect it was too good to be true."
The context in which he encoun
tered the photographs also gave him
confidence in their authenticity. The
photographs themselves are in the
Archives' Robert Capp collection.
Capp — an American soldier — de
scribed the photographs in an ac
companying oral history as photo
graphs from after the Hiroshima
bombing. Prior to the controversy,
the collection's catalog summary
read: "Sound recording of interview,
photographs and miscellany, relat
ing to the aftermath of the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. In

eludes photographs of devastation
and of bodies of victims after the
bombing."
Since the information has come
to light. Hoover has substantively
changed the last sentence in its entry
on Socrates, which now reads: "Also
includes photographs of victims of
the Tokyo earthquake of 1923."
While Socrates is considered the pri
mary search tool for Hoover, both
the main entry cards and subject re
ports within the archives themselves
continue to list the catalog with its
prior, inaccurate description, as of
yesterday afternoon.
The collection is relatively small,
and besides the photographs of the
human bodies there are only photo
graphs of rubble, Capp and his
brother, along with some of his in
signia.
"With a little collection we tend
to believe the donor," said Hoover
Assistant Archivist Carol l.eaden
ham.
Hoover contains over 5.600 col
lections with hundreds of thousands
of individual items.The Institution's
Assistant Director Richard Sousa
indicated that the size of the hold
ings prevented a thorough authen
ticity check of all archived material.
"Our goal is not to authenticate
every piece of information we get,"
Sousa said."But we do document, in

each case, where it came from. We do
not go through and cross-reference
every single piece of material."
"I'd be surprised if the Library of
Congress did that, or any big
archive," he added.
Sousa also said Hoover will not
be changing its policies for examin
ing its material, and Leadenham said
that the scholarly community is ex
pected to help verify materials
themselves.
"The basic principle of archival
work is 'caveat emptor' — buyer be
ware," Leadenham said.
Le Monde correspondent Sylvain
Cepel. who wrote both the newspa
per's initial report on the photo
graphs and subsequent pieces in the
wake of the correction, said that a
catalog description from an institu
tion like 1 loover implied the materi
als had been checked for accuracy.
"If you go to the Library of Con
gress," Cypel said, "and you find
some letter by Eisenhower, and it's
written on the box,'this is a letter of
Eisenhower's,' you would not think
this is not by Eisenhower but by
Adlai Stevenson!"
"When I have the proof that
Hoover has written, 'these are pho
tos from there,' 1 believe them." he
added.
In the case of Malloy's book, the
photographs were incidental to his
argument and were included after
he had completed his manuscript.
"'Hie argument of my hook isn't
based on a photograph," Malloy
said.
Malloy added that the experi
ence has provided lessons for his fu
ture scholarship.
"This experience has really high
lighted the difference of working on

documents without words," Malloy
said. "With a document with words,
you can interrogate those words."
History Professor Barton Bern
stein, who was Malloy s Ph.D. advi
sor. emphasized that mistakes are a
fact of life for scholarship.
"While getting the picture wrong
is a mistake, the argument is not af
fected." Berstein said. "The funda
mental fact is one of destruction and
death."
"In mistakes that get caught in
scholarship, this is comparatively in
significant," he added.
