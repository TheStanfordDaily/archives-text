terviewed Barry via email on Friday.
Emma Trotter (ET): At what age did you realize you were
funny? How did it happen?
Dave Barry (DB): 1 was eight years old, and it was caused by
atomic testing.
ET: 1 las your sense of humor changed since college? How?
I)B: It h as changed a great deal. When 1 was in college. 1 made
jokes about farting, boogers, etc. Whereas now, as a mature
adult. I make jokes about... Okay.it actually hasn't changed.
Andrea Fuller (AF): How did you get hired as a humor colum
nist? It's not exactly a treadmill career.
DB: 1 was an English major, which meant 1 had no marketable

skills. So I
got a job as a reporter at a small Pennsylvania newspaper called
— this is the actual name — The Daily Local News. Whenever
they let me, I wrote humor columns. I kept writing them on the
side while 1 held various other jobs, and finally enough newspa
pers were printing them that I could stop doing anything else. 1
still worry that some day the Seriousness Police will knock on
my door and arrest me on charges of making a living in a total
ly frivolous manner.
AF: What is your favorite column or book?
DB: "Catch-22." Oh, wait, you mean book by ME. I don't real
ly have a
favorite. They're all pretty ridiculous.
ET: Outside of your career as an author and humor columnist,
is it difficult to be taken seriously?
DB: It is difficult even INSIDE my career.
AF: I understand that the life of a humor columnist can be very
strenuous, with all that heavy lifting of beer cans and those ar
duous treks to the bathroom. Is that why you retired?
I)B: Yes. Now I spend pretty much the entire day in the bath
room, thereby eliminating the need to trek there.
ET: I've been reading your column since I learned how to read.
In fact, I distinctly recall learning how to read specifically so
that I could read your column. 1 also read your book about
turning 40 before I turned ten. Do you think the youth of Amer
ica are growing up too fast today? As a parent, would you pre
vent your child from reading your work (or others') until a par
ticular age?
DB: I don't think anybody should read my books. BUY them,
yes. READ them, no.
AF: How do you react to eager fans, like people who send you
articles and ask you to try their catapults? Also, would you con
sider signing your name on my arm so I can have it tattooed?
DB: I don't remember being asked to try anybody's catapult,
which is fine with me because that's how diseases get transmit
ted. I have signed numerous body parts, including foreheads.
ET: You've been known to make fun of politicians in the past.
What's your take on the current political climate in Washing-


WENDY KALKUS/The Stanford Daily
ton and in the states yet to hold pri
maries? Is it true that you're run
ning for office this year?
I)B: I am running for president, and
[1| plan to bring my surging jugger
naut campaign to Stanford. Every
body who comes to my talk can be in
my cabinet.
AF: The Dave Barry for president t
shirt that I own only came in a size
XL. How do you recommend your
female supporters show the Barry
pride while remaining stylish?

1>B: I don't think it's possible to do
both of those things at the same time.
AF: Do you still have an auxiliary
dog?
I)B: 1 am currently dog-less.The only
pets in our house, aside from giant
South Florida insects, are tropical fish,
which really aren't the same as dogs.
For one thing, they're much smarter.
FT: My dorm uses low-flow toilets.
What's the big deal? What are your
thoughts on low-flow showerheads?
I)B: I favor the death penalty.
