An Escondido Village couple out for a late after
noon stroll found themselves staring down the barrel of
a gun in what proved to he a case of false suspicion of
vandalism by campus police.
Around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 24, a first-year
Stanford graduate student, his three-month pregnant
wife and their two-and-a-half year-old son were finish
ing a walk around the Dish, accompanied by a friend
visiting from out of town.
Ihe Daily agreed to withhold the individuals'
names since they were accused of no crime and wished
to retain their privacy as a condition of being inter
viewed.
Ihe couple said that their son wanted to walk down
the last hill of the trail, so the student and his friend
placed their bags in the child's stroller. As the four
crossed Junipero Serra onto Stanford Ave., where their
car was parked, the men walked ahead while the moth
er lagged behind with her child.
Ihe adults walking a stroller loaded down with bags
along a busy road during rush hour aroused the suspi
cion of police. Stanford University Department of Pub
lic Safety (SUDPS) Public Information Officer Bill
Larson said in a written statement that deputies re
sponded to"a report of three individuals who appeared
to be looking into parked vehicles."
Ihe Department of Public Safety is otherwise stay
ing relatively mum about the incident, declining re
peated requests for them to confirm, deny or comment
on any of a series of claims made by the family. Police
instead provided a statement with general Department
policies on detaining suspected criminals.
Larson noted that vehicle burglaries have been on
the rise.

"Before and after this incident occurred, we have
continued to focus our efforts on those areas of the
campus that have experienced a recent rash of vehicle
burglaries and vandalisms, including that portion of
Stanford Ave. where this incident originated," Larson
said. "These efforts include canvassing the area with
alert fliers, increased patrols and responding to reports
of suspicious persons and circumstances."
Shortly after the family and friend began to drive
down Stanford Avenue, they were signaled by a police
man to pull over. As they did so, more police cars came
from the opposite direction and blockaded the party on
Stanford Avenue, according to the parents.
"When I stepped out of the passenger door, I came
face to face with a pistol," the friend said in a police re
port, which he submitted to the Santa Clara County In
ternal Affairs Unit and was obtained by Ihe Daily.
"The man holding the gun ... looked nervous. When I
saw he had the gun pointed at me with both hands. I
said to him, 'What's going on?' We really had no idea
whether we were in danger or were being accused of
being dangerous. He screamed, 'Shut up' [and] 'Get
over there.' Other officers were ordering us with total
ly unnecessary profanities even though we totally com
plied with their demands."
Larson would not comment on the status of any in
ternal investigation and did not respond to questions
about the use of guns or profanity, saying only that de
tention of suspects may require a variety of procedures
in order to protect police officers.
"Detentions may include the use of verbal com
mands, drawn weapons, handcuffing and restriction of
movement in order to control individuals who are
being detained and assure the safety of the sworn offi
cers," Larson said. "According to the Uniform Crime
Reports, which [are] compiled each year by the FBI,
law enforcement officers are injured or killed during
routine traffic stops more often than virtually any other
type of call."

Once the adults were out of the car, they said, the of
ficers instructed them to lie face down on the road with
their hands behind their hacks, still at gunpoint. The
three adults were then handcuffed, according to the
adults' police reports.
"Deputies arrived within moments and detained
the individuals until it could he determined if a burgla
ry or vandalism had been committed, or was in the
process of being committed," Larson said.
"The manner in which deputies stop and detain in
dividuals is based on training, past experiences. Depart
ment policies and procedures, the type of crime and
other information that may have been relayed to
them." Larson continued. "Given the information that
a felony burglary may have been committed, deputies
would have had a heightened concern about the possi
bility of people fleeing from the scene either on foot or
in a vehicle, as well as the potential for violence."
TTic officer-in-charge soon arrived at the scene, the
mother said, and he released her so she could comfort
her child. I ler husband and the friend were released
from handcuffs and asked if they would allow their car
to be searched.
Larson said those detained had not been involved
with thefts or any other criminal activity.
Still, the family remains shaken up.
"The offensive language and threats with deadly
force were excessive," the mother said. "These officers
thought they were arresting thieves. Theft is not a vio
lent crime and 1 do not understand why so much force
was used. It would have been a far lesser offense to our
family to have returned from our hike to find that the
car had been broken into and the radio stolen."
Regardless of the shock, the family is not taking
legal action, though all three adults submitted reports
to the county for investigation.
"We're not pressing charges against them," the wife
said. "We're just saying this isn't OK,
and we want it to be acknowledged.
There are people that, when things
like this happen to them, just feel to
tally disempowered and don 't do any
thing because they're afraid. I think
it's important for people to acknowl
edge what goes on with the police."
Larson said that SUDPS has a for
mal complaint process to deal with
such concerns.
"If a member of the community
would like to complain about a nega
tive experience that resulted from a
contact with any member of the De
partment of Public Safety," he said,
"or a service that was provided or not,
he/she is welcome to file a formal
complaint by completing the proper
form m person at the Department of
Public Safety."
