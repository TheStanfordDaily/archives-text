Large differences in campaign
spending between this year's execu
tive slates are largely the result of a
decision by two of the slates to hire
sweat-free T-shirt companies, ac
cording to the candidates.
David Gobaud '08 and Greg
Goldgof '08 spent $3,768.55 and
Jonny Dorsey '09 and Pagan Harris
09 spent $3,597.31. while Sagar
Doshi '09 and Philip Hon '10 spent
$1834.14 and Priyanka Sharma '09
and Jack Cackler'o9 spent $1,265.33.
Both slates spending over $3,500
pointed to the high cost of sweat-free
T-shirts as the reason for the discrep
ancy. and said that the difference in
spending would not affect the cam
peign
"Over half of the money went to
Ashbury Images, who is rebuilding
lives one T-shirt at a time," said
David Gobaud 08. "They provide
employment for youth committed to

breaking out of the cycle of poverty,
addiction and homelessness."
Dorsey and Harris, who also spent
extra money to secure sweat-free
shirts, argued that the added expense
of the shirts was entirely responsible
for the difference in executive cam
paign spending.
"If our shirts had not been sweat
free. our financing would be close to
the pack." Dorsey said.
Sharma and Cackler. the lowest
spending slate in the executive cam
paign, told The Daily that their low
spending did not reflect on the seri
ousness of their campaign.
"I don't think us spending less
money is an indicator of our commit
ment," said Priyanka Sharma '09.
"That was just a limitation we had
that we had to work with."
Sharma was hopeful that in the
future, University-funded campaigns
or some kind of spending equalizer
would keep the playing field level.
"If Jack and I are elected, that is
something wc are going to brain
storm [for next year]," Sharma said.
Sophomore slates McLeven and

Soph Touch spent $605.01 and
$667.32 respectively, while Oh-
Lovin' spent $331. Junior slate
Ocean's Oh-Ten spent $272. with the
incumbent slate The Giving Tree de
clining to report spending to the
Elections Commission.
Mock Trial spent the most of any
special fees group, printing $213.48
worth of fliers.
Senate spending ranged from $0
for Joseph Lester '11 to $329.34 for
Max Sosna-Spear *11. Numerous
senate candidates did not report fig
ures to the Elections Commission.
Incumbent Senator Luukas lives
'09, who is running for re-election,
blew away all other candidates by re
porting a spending total of $192,025
to the Elections Commission. Ac
cording to his filing, lives partook in
a $100,000 "hooker and blow."
shelled out $50,000 for "Rove and
Libby" and is planning a $2,000 post
election defeat party for "the other
losers."
