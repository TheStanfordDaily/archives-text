## Exit poll shows Obaama favored on campus after California primary

So much for Stanford being a politically apathetic campus.
While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) were the clear winners in the Califor
nia primaries on SuperTUesday, Democratic voters on campus
overwhelmingly chose Sen. Barack Obama (D-III.) as their
choice for the party's nominee, while Stanford Republicans
threw the majority of their support behind Rep. Ron Paul (R-
Tex.).
In exit polls conducted by The Daily throughout the day on
Feb. 5, Obama was the clear winner among Stanford voters
who participated in the Democratic primary.
The Illinois senator received support from nearly 75 per
cent of the 159 Democratic voters polled at the only on-cam
pus polling location, the Graduate Community Center. Clin
ton, Obama's sole challenger, placed a distant second with
about 23 percent support among Stanford voters.
The results were no surprise to Debashish Bakshi '08, the
Stanford chapter coordinator of Students for Barack Obama,
who said turnout was so high at the on-campus polling place
yesterday that election monitors ran out of official Democra
tic ballots and had to resort to giving voters photocopies of
sample ballots.
"The real difference (between Clinton and Obama] is
something about where we want to go as a country," Bakshi
said. "Young people don't want to be locked for the rest of

their lives into a stale and outdated political system. Young
people want something new, they want something better."
"If Clinton is president, things will be better than they are
now, but we will have no direction," he added. "If Obama is
president, we will have a clear and well-articulated direction."
The Republican race was largely overshadowed by the
hotly contested Democratic battle, as Republicans made up
only 22 percent of voters in The Daily's exit polls. On the Re
publican side, Paul led his rivals with 46 percent of the 44 Stan
ford CiOP voters polled. McCain was second with 21 percent,
while Mitt Romney placed third with 18 percent and Mike
1 luckabee finished fourth with 16 percent.
Plough Obama received a majority of support among both
genders and every age and ethnic group (except Latinos) in
The Daily's exit polls, he scored particularly well among men,
who supported him by a nearly nine-to-one margin, and
among African- and Asian-Americans, who both threw more
than 90 percent of their support behind the Illinois senator.
While women nationwide tended to support Clinton, the
story was different at Stanford on Super TUesday, where 60
percent of women voters cast their ballots for Obama; Clinton
was the choice of 36 percent of women, according to The
Daily's exit polls. In addition, the Illinois senator drew the sup
port of 59 percent of white voters, while Clinton won 27 per
cent. In fact. Latinos were the only group that Clinton won in
The Daily's exit polls; she drew 57 percent of Latino voters in
comparison to Obama's 43 percent.
The Clinton Camp
Despite the tremendous support for Obama on campus, it
was Clinton who won the Golden State — the biggest prize of
Super TUesday — by a comfortable margin.


Statistics were tabulated based on
203 interviews (159 Democrats and
44 Republicans) conducted by Daily
staffers Nick Parker and Pat Fitzgerald
at the Graduate Community Center.


MAE RYAN/The Stanford Daily
University community members voted at the Graduate Community
Center on Tuesday, February 5. Clinton and McCain won decisive
victories in the Golden State.
Mishan Araujo '08. the Northern
California chair of Women for
Hillary — a branch of Clinton's na
tional presidential campaign — dis
missed Obama's big win on campus
as a predictable outcome and point
ed to policy differences, rather than
character distinctions, as the impor
tant talking points between the two
candidates.
"[Obama's win on campus] does
n't worry me because it's expected,"
Araujo said. "It's easy to cling to
Obama's messages and the slogans
he uses, but I think when you look
beyond all that, when you look to
[Hillary's] policies and his policies,
particularly on the economy and
healthcare, you realize that it takes
more than hope to make change."
Araujo cited Clinton's wins in key
Northeastern states like New Jersey
as evidence of her nationwide ap

peal. Clinton also won Feb. 5 primar
ies in Arizona, Arkansas, Massachu
setts. Oklahoma, Tennessee and New
York, her home state.
The Olkiiiui Camp
While Obama may have earned
the support of nearly three-quarters
of Stanford Democratic voters in
The Daily survey, he failed to win
California despite recent polls indi
cating that he had closed the gap in
the Golden State.
Bakshi offered a positive outlook
on the California returns, which at
presstime indicated about a 14-point
lead for Clinton.
"Winning California would've
been more symbolic for Obama," he
said, "but given the delegate break
down, we're most likely going to
earn a split."
Every Democratic primary or
caucus yesterday afforded the candi
dates proportional delegates, mak
ing it hard for either Clinton or
Obama to pull significantly ahead.
Such a system means that the Demo
cratic candidates will likely earn sim
ilar numbers of delegates in all the

states that were close on Super Tues
day. The Republicans, by contrast,
competed in both proportional con
tests and winner-take-all races.
Bakshi downplayed Clinton's
wins in California and the populous
Northeastern states as victories that
were expected for months but ended
up being much closer than expected.
"For us to be in a situation where
it's an achievement for Hillary to win
New York. New Jersey and Califor
nia is unbelievable," he said. "Today
was supposed to be the end. That's
completely changed. Ibis race has
become incredibly competitive."
Obama actually claimed more
states than his rival last night. The
Illinois senator won his home state,
as well as Alabama, Alaska. Col
orado. Connecticut. Delaware,
Georgia, Idaho. Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri. North Dakota and Utah,
giving him a total of 13 states won to
Clinton's eight victories on Super
Tuesday. The winner in New Mexico
was still unclear late into the night.
The Road Ahead
While the candidates' supporters

may disagree on the importance of
the California returns and on the im
plications of Super Tuesday as a
whole,they all agree that the fight for
the nomination will be a protracted
one that could last well into April
anil even until the Democratic Na
tional Convention in Denver in Au
gust.
"I think it's going to be a hard
race and a longer race than tonight
definitely." Araujo said. "It is excit
ing that we have two candidates that
are so appealing to so many Democ
rats, but I think the kinds of states
that I lillary won tonight, the kinds of
core Democratic states like New
York and California, mean a lot
going forward."
Meanwhile, Bakshi said the
Obama campaign is in a great posi
tion to capture the nomination after
coming out of Super Tuesday with a
majority of states won.
"1 feel that we're in a position to
go into the post-Super Tuesday
phases with an advantage," he said.
"[Obama's] campaign has always
been better when there've been
fewer states to deal with at a time

because that's where Obama
shines."
"Our fundraising advantage is
massive," Bakshi added. "We're well
funded and we have a fantastic oper
ation on the ground in the remaining
states. We're ready to move into the
stage where we have a comparative
advantage over the Clinton cam
paign."
Stanford Democrats Co-Presi
dent Beth D'Aunno 1)0 offered her
perspective on the tightening race,
noting that she saw both positives
and negatives.
"It is good that every state will
have a voice in this election." D'Aun
no said. "Each candidate in the race
will have been given a fair shot at
this."
"I do think [the protracted elec
tion] will make it harder for us to
unite behind a candidate to project a
strong front toward whomever we go
up against on the Republican side,"
she added."l think we will fully sup
port either candidate in the end."
