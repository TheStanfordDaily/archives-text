So much for Stanford being a politically apathetic campus.
While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) were the clear winners in the Califor
nia primaries on SuperTUesday, Democratic voters on campus
overwhelmingly chose Sen. Barack Obama (D-III.) as their
choice for the party's nominee, while Stanford Republicans
threw the majority of their support behind Rep. Ron Paul (R-
Tex.).
In exit polls conducted by The Daily throughout the day on
Feb. 5, Obama was the clear winner among Stanford voters
who participated in the Democratic primary.
The Illinois senator received support from nearly 75 per
cent of the 159 Democratic voters polled at the only on-cam
pus polling location, the Graduate Community Center. Clin
ton, Obama's sole challenger, placed a distant second with
about 23 percent support among Stanford voters.
The results were no surprise to Debashish Bakshi '08, the
Stanford chapter coordinator of Students for Barack Obama,
who said turnout was so high at the on-campus polling place
yesterday that election monitors ran out of official Democra
tic ballots and had to resort to giving voters photocopies of
sample ballots.
"The real difference (between Clinton and Obama] is
something about where we want to go as a country," Bakshi
said. "Young people don't want to be locked for the rest of

their lives into a stale and outdated political system. Young
people want something new, they want something better."
"If Clinton is president, things will be better than they are
now, but we will have no direction," he added. "If Obama is
president, we will have a clear and well-articulated direction."
The Republican race was largely overshadowed by the
hotly contested Democratic battle, as Republicans made up
only 22 percent of voters in The Daily's exit polls. On the Re
publican side, Paul led his rivals with 46 percent of the 44 Stan
ford CiOP voters polled. McCain was second with 21 percent,
while Mitt Romney placed third with 18 percent and Mike
1 luckabee finished fourth with 16 percent.
Plough Obama received a majority of support among both
genders and every age and ethnic group (except Latinos) in
The Daily's exit polls, he scored particularly well among men,
who supported him by a nearly nine-to-one margin, and
among African- and Asian-Americans, who both threw more
than 90 percent of their support behind the Illinois senator.
While women nationwide tended to support Clinton, the
story was different at Stanford on Super TUesday, where 60
percent of women voters cast their ballots for Obama; Clinton
was the choice of 36 percent of women, according to The
Daily's exit polls. In addition, the Illinois senator drew the sup
port of 59 percent of white voters, while Clinton won 27 per
cent. In fact. Latinos were the only group that Clinton won in
The Daily's exit polls; she drew 57 percent of Latino voters in
comparison to Obama's 43 percent.
The Clinton Camp
Despite the tremendous support for Obama on campus, it
was Clinton who won the Golden State — the biggest prize of
Super TUesday — by a comfortable margin.


Statistics were tabulated based on
203 interviews (159 Democrats and
44 Republicans) conducted by Daily
staffers Nick Parker and Pat Fitzgerald
at the Graduate Community Center.
