When the president of the Basque
Government speaks at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center on Feb. 14. he shouldn't
expect Valentines from everyone in the
audience.
Spain's regional politics have indi
rectly led to a ruckus on campus. A con
troversial seminar with Juan Jose Ibar
retxe, sponsored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, has
caused a firestorm in Spain and prompt
ed a Stanford student to initiate a peti
tion that has garnered 3,500 online signa
tures.

On Wednesday. Jan. 23, a spokesman
for the neighboring regional govern
ment of Navarra that has opposed Ibar
retxe sent a letter to President John I len
nessy protesting the event. That letter,
which called for other perspectives to be
heard on campus instead, is detailed in
the Friday, Jan. 25 edition of Diario de
Navarra, a Spanish newspaper.
Ibarretxe, the visitor, is seen by oppo
nents in neighboring communities as a
nationalist who sympathizes with the the
Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA), which the U.S. State
Department classifies as a terrorist or
ganization.
University officials say they will not
rescind the invitation and frame the visit
as being about academic freedom. They

say that the timing of the long-planned
event has nothing to do with influencing
the Spanish general elections, set for only
three weeks after the scheduled visit.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 82,
who is of Basque heritage himself, ar
gued that the political climate in Spain
has made it easy for certain parties to
condemn all Basque politicians for the
crimes committed by the ETA. This is
analogous, he said, to condemning all
Muslims for the crimes committed by
terrorists on Sept. 11.2(X) 1.
"The question of whether the Forum
on Contemporary Europe should be al
lowed to invite Mr. Ibarretxe to speak at
Stanford is not even a hard question."
Etchemendy said. "Should they be al
lowed to invite Muslim politicians, even

Basque President Juan Jose Ibarretxe
spoke to students and faculty about
Basque independence, calling for
Spain to recognize the region's self
government.
though there are some who would con
demn all Muslims for 9/11 ?Of course."
