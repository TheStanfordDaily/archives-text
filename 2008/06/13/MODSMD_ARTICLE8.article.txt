When the president of the Basque
Government speaks at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center on Feb. 14. he shouldn't
expect Valentines from everyone in the
audience.
Spain's regional politics have indi
rectly led to a ruckus on campus. A con
troversial seminar with Juan Jose Ibar
retxe, sponsored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, has
caused a firestorm in Spain and prompt
ed a Stanford student to initiate a peti
tion that has garnered 3,500 online signa
tures.

On Wednesday. Jan. 23, a spokesman
for the neighboring regional govern
ment of Navarra that has opposed Ibar
retxe sent a letter to President John I len
nessy protesting the event. That letter,
which called for other perspectives to be
heard on campus instead, is detailed in
the Friday, Jan. 25 edition of Diario de
Navarra, a Spanish newspaper.
Ibarretxe, the visitor, is seen by oppo
nents in neighboring communities as a
nationalist who sympathizes with the the
Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA), which the U.S. State
Department classifies as a terrorist or
ganization.
University officials say they will not
rescind the invitation and frame the visit
as being about academic freedom. They

say that the timing of the long-planned
event has nothing to do with influencing
the Spanish general elections, set for only
three weeks after the scheduled visit.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 82,
who is of Basque heritage himself, ar
gued that the political climate in Spain
has made it easy for certain parties to
condemn all Basque politicians for the
crimes committed by the ETA. This is
analogous, he said, to condemning all
Muslims for the crimes committed by
terrorists on Sept. 11.2(X) 1.
"The question of whether the Forum
on Contemporary Europe should be al
lowed to invite Mr. Ibarretxe to speak at
Stanford is not even a hard question."
Etchemendy said. "Should they be al
lowed to invite Muslim politicians, even

Basque President Juan Jose Ibarretxe
spoke to students and faculty about
Basque independence, calling for
Spain to recognize the region's self
government.
though there are some who would con
demn all Muslims for 9/11 ?Of course."

A group of demonstrators gathered outside Arrillaga Alumni Center Thursday, Feb. 14 to protest the arrival of Juan Jose Ibarretxe, president of Spain's regional
Basque government. The protesters included Stanford students, other college students and local workers.

visit was organized by a student at
Stanford, along with Jose Manuel
Camporro, a Silicon Valley worker
who grew up in the Basque city of Vi
toria, and another working profession
al from the Bay Area. Organizers said
to expect large protests during the
visit.
Prof. Joan Ramon Resina, the chair
of the Spanish and Portuguese De
partments, said the majority of those
who have signed the petition come
from Spain.
"If our events were subject to can
cellation by those who, here and
abroad, do not approve of the speak
ers, we would soon not hold any events
but the most anodyne," he said.
"|Those] people do not understand
that academic freedom is the basis on
which our [U.S.] universities,and Stan
ford in particular, stand."
Critics, including prominent
Spaniards and a member of the Euro
pean Parliament, say University offi
cials are providing a platform for a
fringe politician to advocate a referen
dum on independence for the Basque
region of northern Spain — the most
controversial issue in the country for
more than a quarter century.
These opponents say the proposal,
which they perceive as a land grab by a
territory-hungry politician, has been
rejected by the central government in
Madrid.
Juan Maria Atutxa, a politician in
the Basque country and member of
the Basque Nationalist Party, was
found guilty this January of disobeying
a Supreme Court ruling for refusing to
dissolve Batasuna, an illegal national
ist, political wing of ETA.The U.S. con
siders Batasuna, which Atutxa pro
tected, to be a terrorist organization.
According to Basque News and In
formation Channel eitb24. Ibarretxe
defends Atutxa for his protection of
Batasuna, saying he did nothing
wrong. Etchemendy said that Ibar
retxe is a popular politician in the
Basque region because he has consis

tently condemned the violent tactics of
ETA and supports a peaceful resolu
tion to the turmoil, which has included
bombings, murders and kidnappings.
Resina extended the invitation to
Ibarretxe in conjunction with the
Forum on Contemporary Europe
(FCE) — a section of the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI) that houses the
Iberian Studies Program, which
Resina created and directs.
He said that the FSI routinely in
vites European political leaders from
across the political spectrum and that
the FCE is particularly interested in
anyone who can address issues of
pressing interest. Resina argued that
Basque Country' is one of the historical
nationalities within the Spanish state
and a crucial component of Iberian
culture and society.
"President Ibarretxe's talk has par
ticular interest in the European con
text, where similar processes of popu
lar consultation have taken place."
Resina said, pointing to Scotland as an
example. "Furthermore, Ibarretxe's
proposal, under certain conditions,
could prove to be the elusive tool to
negotiate a definitive ceasefire by
ETA, which in the last decade has de
clared 10 long-term truces only to
break them later for lack of political
progress in the negotiations."
Those upset with the University
program say that if better understand
ing the issue is the goal, then a panel of
speakers with diverse viewpoints
should be invited.
"Since Ibarretxe has the same posi
tion as a state governor in the U.S., why
not invite another president from one
of the other 16 autonomous provinces
in Spain governed by liberals or con
servatives?" Camporro asked. "Why
not somebody who can speak for the
victims of their manipulation, extor
tion?"
Resina argues that this would limit
the Basque president's ability to
make a formal address by downgrad
ing his lecture to a sparring match
with little or no guarantee of propri
ety. It would also provide the protest
ers with a symbolic victory' by forcing
an unintended speaker on Stanford.
Additionally. Resina pointed out that
a challenger would make people for

get that there is no institutional peer
of Ibarretxe's level on Basque mat
ters.
Resina said he did not ask the
Basque president to speak on any spe
cific topic.
"1 assume that his plan for a demo
cratic consultation of the people in
[Basque Country] will feature in his
lecture." he said."But again, I have not
defined or otherwise preconditioned
the content of the lecture in any way."
The lecture, which will include a
question-and-answer session,is touted
on the University Web site as an op
portunity for Ibarretxe to discuss his
"Road Map to bring an end to the
Basque Conflict."
Since Spain will have a general
election approximately three weeks
after Ibarretxe comes to Stanford, it
has been suggested by the organizers
of the petition that the lecture could
potentially impact the results by giving
the force of Stanford's name to the
ideas that the Basque leader is expect
ed to advocate.
Debra Zumwalt, the University's
general counsel,said that it does not vi
olate University policy on political ac
tivities to have speakers on campus
talk about their policies and beliefs,
even if the speakers are politicians and
even if they have controversial views.
"We have had many world leaders
and candidates for political office
speak at Stanford," she said, "some of
them with very controversial posi
tions."
Just as Columbia University went
ahead with plans to host Iranian presi
dent Mahmud Ahmadinejad in Sep
tember, even after top administrators
came under fire, it seems highly un
likely that Stanford organizers will
step down.
"The intensity and scope of the un
supported accusations against Presi
dent Ibarretxe are among the ugliest
things 1 have seen in my long academ
ic life." Resina said. "The organizers of
the protest have chosen the path of
confrontation rather than the demo
cratic one of discussion with the speak
er. according to academic protocol."
