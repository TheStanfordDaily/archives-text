Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's highly
competitive physics doctoral program was only the first step in an
arduous journey from Iran to California. After a multitude of em
bassy visits, visa interviews and background checks, the Iranian
citizen arrived at Stanford in 2(X)6 — almost a year alter he was
originally set to begin his graduate studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound Iranian
student has been delayed by ramped-up security measures put in
place following the attacks on September 11,2001, and President
Bush's declaration that Iran is a member of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa de
lays have hindered the academic pursuits of Iranian students at
the University. Students have also reported visits from the FBI in
which agents supposedly verified immigration statuses. Accord
ing to Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani, these circumstances have
created a climate of fear and intimidation among Stanford's Iran
ian population.
The Visa Process and its Effects
Security-threat safeguards consisting of name-based and bio
metric checks are the same for prospective students and scholars
as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7.2(X)8 Con
gressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the intera
gency database of qualified travelers, suspected terrorists, inter
national criminals and immigration violators, and then screened
through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition data
base of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each appli
cant's name and biodata are checked against a name-based data
base of over 32 million interagency entries, according to Edson.
For certain travelers, including "students and scholars with ex
pertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation concern," an inter
agency analysis of their application data — known as a Visas
Mantis clearance — is required.
'Fhis process can be particularly long for students from Iran,
one reason being the lack of a U.S. embassy in
their home country since the 1979 Iranian
Revolution. Students and scholars wishing to
travel to the U.S. must first travel to a neigh
boring country to begin the visa application
process.
"You have to go twice for an interview,
and. if you're lucky, you go a second time to
pick the visa up."said Amin Firoozshahian. an
Iranian doctoral student in Electrical Engi
neering. "Every time,it'sjust expensive. Every
time, you go through this burden of going to
consulates, going to a third country, reserva
tions of flights, hotels, visas. It's a project. It's a
full-time project."
Firoozshahian, whose first visa application
was rejected in 2001 in Ilirkey, later traveled
to Dubai to reapply. Noorbala's first attempt
in 2005 was also denied, allegedly because he
did not show enough intent to return to his
home country following his stated length of
stay — known as non-immigrant intent.
"They told me,' You don't have enough so
cial ties to your home country.' or something
like that," Noorbala said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center, said Stanford steps in to
assist when a University-bound student is de
nied a visa request.

"In these cases, we have been able to re
quest a consideration," Pearson said in an
email to The Daily, " line denial is usually
based on insufficient evidence that the stu
dent intends to return to their home country
after they have finished their studies. Bechtel
works with departments and consulates to ask
for reconsideration of the visa denial."
But students who have undergone the
process say Stanford can only do so much to
help.
"The University helps you, provides you
with paperwork." Firoozshahian said.
"Maybe sometimes they send faxes to the
consulate or provide you with letters to the
consulate. But this is all the University can
do. In the end, it is the sole discretion of the
consulate officer to decide if you're going or
you're not going."
Iranian students also emphasized the
hardships that visa rejections and delays inr
pose on families. Because the vast majority of
Iranian students are only granted single
entry visas, many do not go home for fear
that reapplying for a U.S. visa will result in
delay or denial.
"I've had friends who haven't seen their
families for six to seven years because they
couldn't afford the travel or the delays,"

Firoozshahian said. "My parents were trying
to come to my [June] graduation, and they got
turned down. [The consulate] said that only
one of them could come. It was kind of tough
— how could I make that decision?"
Under "Watchful Eyes"
Abbas Milani — director of Stanford's
Iranian Studies Program, fellow at the
Hoover Institution and Iranian exile since
1986— said he believes Iranian students are
not only scrutinized more when applying for
visas, but are also "watched more" once in the
I J.S.
"I think they are under considerably more
watchful eyes," said Milani. who spent a year
in an Iranian prison in 1977 for his Marxist
teachings. "The FBI keeps a much closer tab
on them."
One Iranian student, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because he feared
drawing attention from the government, said
that while the FBI usually contacts students
by phone first, one agent simply showed up at
his door.
"I le just knocked at the door and said,'l'm
from the FBI. Let's make an appointment,'"
the student told The Daily. "Our conversation
was long — like one hour. He asked me about

my family in Iran and about my research
here."
This student said he was expecting the visit
because many of his friends had received sim
ilar ones.
Firoozshahian, who received an FBI visit
two to three years ago, said the agents who vis
ited him in his department office claimed to be
helping the Immigration and Naturalization
Service by verifying student visa statuses.
"According to what they said, a couple of
the attackers of 9/11 were on student visas,
and they wanted to make sure that the stu
dents here were maintaining their legal sta
tus," Firoozshahian said.
"They were very nice," he added. "It wasn't
anything bad."
The Daily left repeated messages for the
FBl's San Francisco division inquiring about
the agency's stated purpose for visits to cam
pus, but the messages were not returned.
Milani said the pre-9/11 U.S. was "the most
lax country for those who overstayed their
visas." but he believes current FBI visits repre
sent "over-vigilance" on the part of the post
-9/1 1 government.
"The pendulum has to swing back to the
middle where the immigration office knows
who is here on visa status and when their

visa status has lapsed," he said. "Making
them feel like these interviews are a form of
checking up on them or frightening them is,
I think, counter-productive. It leaves a bad
taste."
Milani underscored the importance of relax
ing visa processes, highlighting the negative
consequences of continued US. policy.
"I understand the security aspect of it,"he
said, "although sooner or later, if American
universities and European universities are
closed to Iranian students wanting to study
physics or chemistry, they'll go to India, they'll
go to China, they'll go to Russia or Japan."
Milani also called American-educated Ira
nians "Trojan horses of democracy" because
they experience democracy and return to Iran
with its values.
"The path [from America to Iran] allows
them to become willy-nilly agents of change,"
he said. "To close that path is so short-sided
that it's hard to imagine any other cause than
sheer ignorance or malice. I tend to think it's
more ignorance than malice."

Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's highly
competitive physics doctoral program was only the first step in an
arduous journey from Iran to California. After a multitude of em
bassy visits, visa interviews and background checks, the Iranian
citizen arrived at Stanford in 2(X)6 — almost a year alter he was
originally set to begin his graduate studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound Iranian
student has been delayed by ramped-up security measures put in
place following the attacks on September 11,2001, and President
Bush's declaration that Iran is a member of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa de
lays have hindered the academic pursuits of Iranian students at
the University. Students have also reported visits from the FBI in
which agents supposedly verified immigration statuses. Accord
ing to Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani, these circumstances have
created a climate of fear and intimidation among Stanford's Iran
ian population.
The Visa Process and its Effects
Security-threat safeguards consisting of name-based and bio
metric checks are the same for prospective students and scholars
as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7.2(X)8 Con
gressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the intera
gency database of qualified travelers, suspected terrorists, inter
national criminals and immigration violators, and then screened
through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition data
base of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each appli
cant's name and biodata are checked against a name-based data
base of over 32 million interagency entries, according to Edson.
For certain travelers, including "students and scholars with ex
pertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation concern," an inter
agency analysis of their application data — known as a Visas
Mantis clearance — is required.
'Fhis process can be particularly long for students from Iran,
one reason being the lack of a U.S. embassy in
their home country since the 1979 Iranian
Revolution. Students and scholars wishing to
travel to the U.S. must first travel to a neigh
boring country to begin the visa application
process.
"You have to go twice for an interview,
and. if you're lucky, you go a second time to
pick the visa up."said Amin Firoozshahian. an
Iranian doctoral student in Electrical Engi
neering. "Every time,it'sjust expensive. Every
time, you go through this burden of going to
consulates, going to a third country, reserva
tions of flights, hotels, visas. It's a project. It's a
full-time project."
Firoozshahian, whose first visa application
was rejected in 2001 in Ilirkey, later traveled
to Dubai to reapply. Noorbala's first attempt
in 2005 was also denied, allegedly because he
did not show enough intent to return to his
home country following his stated length of
stay — known as non-immigrant intent.
"They told me,' You don't have enough so
cial ties to your home country.' or something
like that," Noorbala said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center, said Stanford steps in to
assist when a University-bound student is de
nied a visa request.

"In these cases, we have been able to re
quest a consideration," Pearson said in an
email to The Daily, " line denial is usually
based on insufficient evidence that the stu
dent intends to return to their home country
after they have finished their studies. Bechtel
works with departments and consulates to ask
for reconsideration of the visa denial."
But students who have undergone the
process say Stanford can only do so much to
help.
"The University helps you, provides you
with paperwork." Firoozshahian said.
"Maybe sometimes they send faxes to the
consulate or provide you with letters to the
consulate. But this is all the University can
do. In the end, it is the sole discretion of the
consulate officer to decide if you're going or
you're not going."
Iranian students also emphasized the
hardships that visa rejections and delays inr
pose on families. Because the vast majority of
Iranian students are only granted single
entry visas, many do not go home for fear
that reapplying for a U.S. visa will result in
delay or denial.
"I've had friends who haven't seen their
families for six to seven years because they
couldn't afford the travel or the delays,"

Firoozshahian said. "My parents were trying
to come to my [June] graduation, and they got
turned down. [The consulate] said that only
one of them could come. It was kind of tough
— how could I make that decision?"
Under "Watchful Eyes"
Abbas Milani — director of Stanford's
Iranian Studies Program, fellow at the
Hoover Institution and Iranian exile since
1986— said he believes Iranian students are
not only scrutinized more when applying for
visas, but are also "watched more" once in the
I J.S.
"I think they are under considerably more
watchful eyes," said Milani. who spent a year
in an Iranian prison in 1977 for his Marxist
teachings. "The FBI keeps a much closer tab
on them."
One Iranian student, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because he feared
drawing attention from the government, said
that while the FBI usually contacts students
by phone first, one agent simply showed up at
his door.
"I le just knocked at the door and said,'l'm
from the FBI. Let's make an appointment,'"
the student told The Daily. "Our conversation
was long — like one hour. He asked me about

my family in Iran and about my research
here."
This student said he was expecting the visit
because many of his friends had received sim
ilar ones.
Firoozshahian, who received an FBI visit
two to three years ago, said the agents who vis
ited him in his department office claimed to be
helping the Immigration and Naturalization
Service by verifying student visa statuses.
"According to what they said, a couple of
the attackers of 9/11 were on student visas,
and they wanted to make sure that the stu
dents here were maintaining their legal sta
tus," Firoozshahian said.
"They were very nice," he added. "It wasn't
anything bad."
The Daily left repeated messages for the
FBl's San Francisco division inquiring about
the agency's stated purpose for visits to cam
pus, but the messages were not returned.
Milani said the pre-9/11 U.S. was "the most
lax country for those who overstayed their
visas." but he believes current FBI visits repre
sent "over-vigilance" on the part of the post
-9/1 1 government.
"The pendulum has to swing back to the
middle where the immigration office knows
who is here on visa status and when their

visa status has lapsed," he said. "Making
them feel like these interviews are a form of
checking up on them or frightening them is,
I think, counter-productive. It leaves a bad
taste."
Milani underscored the importance of relax
ing visa processes, highlighting the negative
consequences of continued US. policy.
"I understand the security aspect of it,"he
said, "although sooner or later, if American
universities and European universities are
closed to Iranian students wanting to study
physics or chemistry, they'll go to India, they'll
go to China, they'll go to Russia or Japan."
Milani also called American-educated Ira
nians "Trojan horses of democracy" because
they experience democracy and return to Iran
with its values.
"The path [from America to Iran] allows
them to become willy-nilly agents of change,"
he said. "To close that path is so short-sided
that it's hard to imagine any other cause than
sheer ignorance or malice. I tend to think it's
more ignorance than malice."
