Mahdiyar Noorbala's acceptance letter to Stanford's highly
competitive physics doctoral program was only the first step in an
arduous journey from Iran to California. After a multitude of em
bassy visits, visa interviews and background checks, the Iranian
citizen arrived at Stanford in 2(X)6 — almost a year alter he was
originally set to begin his graduate studies.
Noorbala's is one of many cases in which a U.S.-bound Iranian
student has been delayed by ramped-up security measures put in
place following the attacks on September 11,2001, and President
Bush's declaration that Iran is a member of an "axis of evil."
Stanford students, professors and administrators say visa de

created a climate of fear and intimidation among Stanford's Iran
ian population.
The Visa Process and its Effects

metric checks are the same for prospective students and scholars
as for all other visa applicants, according to a Feb. 7.2(X)8 Con
gressional testimony by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Visa Service Stephen Edson.
Each applicant's fingerprints are checked against the intera
gency database of qualified travelers, suspected terrorists, inter
national criminals and immigration violators, and then screened
through the FBl's criminal database.
Applicant photos are screened against a facial recognition data
base of suspected terrorists and visa violators, and each appli
cant's name and biodata are checked against a name-based data
base of over 32 million interagency entries, according to Edson.
For certain travelers, including "students and scholars with ex
pertise in fields of [nuclear] non-proliferation concern," an inter
agency analysis of their application data — known as a Visas
Mantis clearance — is required.
