## Employee embezzles LPCH money Machalowski charged with stealing over $350,000 
### DEVIN BANERJEE NEWS EDITOR 
A former employee of the Lucile Packard
Foundation for Children's Health has been
arrested for allegations that she embezzled more
than $350,000 from the children's health founda
tion during an eight-year period, according to a
Wednesday press release from the office of Santa
Clara County's District Attorney.
The foundation is the primary fundraiser for
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at
Stanford and for the pediatric programs at the
Stanford School of Medicine.
Marilyn Machalowski, 68, worked as an
accounting manager and payroll/benefit manager
during the embezzlement period of 1999 to 2007.
She was charged Wednesday with one count of
grand theft, along with an allegation of embezzle
ment in excess of $200,000.
"Machalowski often wrote company checks to
her daughter, and then deposited them in their
joint account," the press release noted. "She also
wired money from the Foundation's account into
her own account, as well as putting additional
money towards her 401 (k). To conceal the
embezzlement, Machalowski recorded much
lower dollar amounts in the check register than
what she had actually written."
In a phone interview with The Weekly, the
foundation's president and CEO, David
Alexander, said routine accounting processes
unearthed Machalowski's scheme about two
months after the long-time employee resigned.
"Following a routine check of our finances, it
immediately became apparent that something
was amiss," Alexander said.
The foundation then hired an independent
forensic accounting firm — Deloitte FAS —to
investigate their financial system and processes.
As soon as investigators confirmed a single
employee had diverted $350,000, the foundation
contacted the authorities.
"Once we figured out what had happened on
our own, we turned everything over to the Palo
Alto | Police Department]," Alexander said.
The President and CEO also noted that
changes to the foundation's financial system have
been implemented to prevent future embezzle
ment.
"1 think the biggest learned from all
this for us is that we had 100 much responsibil
ity invested in one person who abused that
trust," Alexander said. "We have changed the
financial system so that no one person can do
what she was able to do. It would be virtually
impossible."
According to Wednesday's press release,
Machalowski faces a maximum sentence of five
years in state prison. She is scheduled for arraign
ment on Aug. 7 at 9 a.m.
