# Winfrey offers life lessons
## Global media leader gives books, guidance to Class of 2008 
### KELLEY FONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Philanthropist Oprah Winfrey
traded in a talk show audience of
millions for a Commencement audi
ence of 25,000 June 15 at Stanford
Stadium.
Winfrey centered her speech
around the theme of learning —
learning from one's gut, learning
from life's setbacks and learning the
importance of giving back.
Though Winfrey is known for
bestowing free cars on her audi
ences, her gift for the Class of 2008
was somewhat more cerebral. She
left Stanford graduates with two of
her favorite books, Eckhart Tolle's
"A New Earth" and Daniel Pink's
"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-
Brainers Will Rule the Future."
"I really wanted to give you cars,
but 1 just couldn't pull that off," she
said, drawing laughter from the audi
ence.
In a growing tradition, students
made a grand entrance into the 117 th
Commencement with the Wacky
Walk. Roaming the stadium field,
they toted balloons, beach balls and
bubbles. Many carried hand-painted
signs reading "Thanks, Mom and
Dad" and Marry Me, Oprah," while
others donned creative costumes that
included everything from the Magic
School Bus to Magic 8 Balls.
President John Hennessy intro
duced Winfrey to loud applause and
cheers.
"At Stanford, we encourage our
graduates to think about the impact
they can have on the world and to
make good use of their skills,"
Hennessy said. "Few people have
done so better than Oprah Winfrey."
Winfrey's speech took a conversa
tional and at times humorous tone as
she offered the graduates inspiration
and advice from her own experi
ences. Excited to be at Stanford —
she finally got to see graduating god
daughter Kirby Bumpus' dorm room
— Winfrey implored graduates to be
open to life's lessons.
"Walk through life eager and
open to self-improvement," she told
the audience. "I believe that there's a
lesson in almost everything that you
do and every experience, and getting
the lesson is how you move forward."
She advised graduates to follow
their "emotional guidance systems"
and to trust their hearts. At 22,
Winfrey endured a news anchor job
that left her feeling miserable. A
forced move to talk show hosting,
she recalled, was like coming home.
"The moment I sat down, doing
that talk show, it felt like breathing,"
she said. "It felt right...When you're
doing the work you're meant to do,
it feels right and every day is a
bonus, regardless of what you're get
ting paid."
Winfrey, however, did not deny
the power of money.
"I like money," she acknowl
edged. "It's good for buying things."

But success, Winfrey argued,
came from having both money and
meaning.
"You want your work to be
meaningful," she said. "Because
meaning is what brings the real rich
ness to your life."
Winfrey's second lesson to gradu
ates emphasized learning from fail
ures. She described her founding of a
school for girls in South Africa last
year. Heralded by the media upon the
school's opening, Winfrey's hopes
were dampened when one of the
dorm matrons was charged for sexual
abuse last fall. Winfrey said she was
devastated, but took the setback as a
lesson to reassess her priorities.
"I understand now the mistakes
I made, because I had been paying
attention to all of the wrong things,"
she said, citing her focus on the
school's physical appearance. "I'd
built that school from the outside in,
when what really mattered was the
inside out."
Finally, Winfrey implored gradu
ates to stand for something larger
than their individual selves in order
to find happiness.
"To move forward, you have to
give back. And to me, that is the
greatest lesson of all," she
remarked, adding that the
University's founding was only pos
sible because Jane and Leland
Stanford profoundly understood this
lesson.
Whatever the graduates' callings,
Winfrey emphasized, operating
from the paradigm of service would

bring more value to their lives.
"If you choose to offer your
skills and talents in service," she
said, "it turns everything you do
from a job into a gift. And I know

you haven't spent all this time at
Stanford just to go out and get a
job."
Winfrey's speech was well
received by graduating students.

"I thought the spccch was a good
balance of lightness and humor, as
well as inspirational advice," said
Philip Williams, who received a mas
ter's degree in electrical engineering.
"It really spoke to a lot of people."
David Cohen, who graduated
with bachelor's and master's degrees
in computer science, said he was sur
prised that Winfrey made no refer
ences to the upcoming election.
"1 was like, 'What is she going to
say about Obama?' — but no, she
did a very professional job," he said.
Matthew Czinger, who received
bachelor's degrees in mathematics
and music, appreciated Winfrey's
emphasis on graduates having their
entire lives ahead of them to make a
positive impact.
"I think there's too much of a
focus on, 'Immediately after
Stanford, you automatically have to
be tremendous,'" he said. "So I felt
very inspired by the fact that I have
good things to look forward to in
my near future, but also many
things to look forward to later on.
Following the conferral of 1,702
bachelor's degrees to 1,665 under
graduates - as well as 2,017 master's
degrees and 947 doctoral degrees -
students received their individual
diplomas at departmental cere
monies. But not before they
snapped pictures, hugged loved
ones and enjoyed a final perfor
mance from the Stanford Band.

Philanthropist Oprah Winfrey
traded in a talk show audience of
millions for a Commencement audi
ence of 25,000 June 15 at Stanford
Stadium.
Winfrey centered her speech
around the theme of learning —
learning from one's gut, learning
from life's setbacks and learning the
importance of giving back.
Though Winfrey is known for
bestowing free cars on her audi
ences, her gift for the Class of 2008
was somewhat more cerebral. She
left Stanford graduates with two of
her favorite books, Eckhart Tolle's
"A New Earth" and Daniel Pink's
"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-
Brainers Will Rule the Future."
"I really wanted to give you cars,
but 1 just couldn't pull that off," she
said, drawing laughter from the audi
ence.
In a growing tradition, students
made a grand entrance into the 117 th
Commencement with the Wacky
Walk. Roaming the stadium field,
they toted balloons, beach balls and
bubbles. Many carried hand-painted
signs reading "Thanks, Mom and
Dad" and Marry Me, Oprah," while
others donned creative costumes that
included everything from the Magic
School Bus to Magic 8 Balls.
President John Hennessy intro
duced Winfrey to loud applause and
cheers.
"At Stanford, we encourage our
graduates to think about the impact
they can have on the world and to
make good use of their skills,"
Hennessy said. "Few people have
done so better than Oprah Winfrey."
Winfrey's speech took a conversa
tional and at times humorous tone as
she offered the graduates inspiration
and advice from her own experi
ences. Excited to be at Stanford —
she finally got to see graduating god
daughter Kirby Bumpus' dorm room
— Winfrey implored graduates to be
open to life's lessons.
"Walk through life eager and
open to self-improvement," she told
the audience. "I believe that there's a
lesson in almost everything that you
do and every experience, and getting
the lesson is how you move forward."
She advised graduates to follow
their "emotional guidance systems"
and to trust their hearts. At 22,
Winfrey endured a news anchor job
that left her feeling miserable. A
forced move to talk show hosting,
she recalled, was like coming home.
"The moment I sat down, doing
that talk show, it felt like breathing,"
she said. "It felt right...When you're
doing the work you're meant to do,
it feels right and every day is a
bonus, regardless of what you're get
ting paid."
Winfrey, however, did not deny
the power of money.
"I like money," she acknowl
edged. "It's good for buying things."

But success, Winfrey argued,
came from having both money and
meaning.
"You want your work to be
meaningful," she said. "Because
meaning is what brings the real rich
ness to your life."
Winfrey's second lesson to gradu
ates emphasized learning from fail
ures. She described her founding of a
school for girls in South Africa last
year. Heralded by the media upon the
school's opening, Winfrey's hopes
were dampened when one of the
dorm matrons was charged for sexual
abuse last fall. Winfrey said she was
devastated, but took the setback as a
lesson to reassess her priorities.
"I understand now the mistakes
I made, because I had been paying
attention to all of the wrong things,"
she said, citing her focus on the
school's physical appearance. "I'd
built that school from the outside in,
when what really mattered was the
inside out."
Finally, Winfrey implored gradu
ates to stand for something larger
than their individual selves in order
to find happiness.
"To move forward, you have to
give back. And to me, that is the
greatest lesson of all," she
remarked, adding that the
University's founding was only pos
sible because Jane and Leland
Stanford profoundly understood this
lesson.
Whatever the graduates' callings,
Winfrey emphasized, operating
from the paradigm of service would

bring more value to their lives.
"If you choose to offer your
skills and talents in service," she
said, "it turns everything you do
from a job into a gift. And I know

you haven't spent all this time at
Stanford just to go out and get a
job."
Winfrey's speech was well
received by graduating students.

"I thought the spccch was a good
balance of lightness and humor, as
well as inspirational advice," said
Philip Williams, who received a mas
ter's degree in electrical engineering.
"It really spoke to a lot of people."
David Cohen, who graduated
with bachelor's and master's degrees
in computer science, said he was sur
prised that Winfrey made no refer
ences to the upcoming election.
"1 was like, 'What is she going to
say about Obama?' — but no, she
did a very professional job," he said.
Matthew Czinger, who received
bachelor's degrees in mathematics
and music, appreciated Winfrey's
emphasis on graduates having their
entire lives ahead of them to make a
positive impact.
"I think there's too much of a
focus on, 'Immediately after
Stanford, you automatically have to
be tremendous,'" he said. "So I felt
very inspired by the fact that I have
good things to look forward to in
my near future, but also many
things to look forward to later on.
Following the conferral of 1,702
bachelor's degrees to 1,665 under
graduates - as well as 2,017 master's
degrees and 947 doctoral degrees -
students received their individual
diplomas at departmental cere
monies. But not before they
snapped pictures, hugged loved
ones and enjoyed a final perfor
mance from the Stanford Band.
