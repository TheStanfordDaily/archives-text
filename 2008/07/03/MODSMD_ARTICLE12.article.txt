# CAMPUS BRIEFS
## Holiday fireworks cancelled due to construction 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
University officials announced
earlier this week that the annual
July 3 fireworks display over
campus has been cancelled due to
conflicts with local construction.
The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra
will still perform at the event,
coordinators told The San Jose
Mercury News.
The three-inch firework
shells normally used in the dis
play require a launch location
that is at least 210 feet from spec
tators, vehicles and buildings.
However, because the new
Stanford Institute for Economic
Policy Research is under con
struction near the event site,
coordinators axed the popular
fireworks finale that has fol
lowed each annual July 3 concert
for over a decade.
According to The San Jose
Mercury News, the closest alter
native for those seeking a fire
works display is an 8 p.m. ticket
ed event on July 4 at Mountain
View's Shoreline Amphitheatre.
Coordinators for the event said
the display of 500 to 600 shells
will be the largest in the
amphitheatre's history and will
feature new patterns and colors
in a more rapid succession of
launches.
