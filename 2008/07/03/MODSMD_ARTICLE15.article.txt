# County hires prof. for jail retrofitting
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Martin
Fischer is working with
researchers from the
University's Precourt Institute
for Energy Efficiency on a $1
million project that will retrofit
Santa Clara County's Main Jail
North to be more environmen
tally friendly.
Fischer's work, which will be
guided by a detailed computer
simulation of the jail, is expected
to lower the jail's operational
costs and reduce its greenhouse
gas emissions. Stanford has
offered to fund up to $1 million
for the project and retrofit the
20-year-old, eight-story building,
according to The Stanford
Report.
The researchers will first
install sensors throughout the
building to take such measure
ments such as temperature, air
flow patterns and effectiveness of
air conditioning and heating sys
tems. The measurements will aid
in creating the computer simula
tion, which will then guide the
jail's new design.
Under its agreement with the
county, Stanford has two years to
present its retrofit design.
