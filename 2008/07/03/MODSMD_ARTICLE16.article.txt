## Stanford Web channel debuts on You Tube Site has already garnered over 25,000 views of lectures, speeches and more

Stanford expanded its Web outreach two weeks ago
with the launch of its first channel on the widely popular
video-sharing site You Tube. Managed by the Office of
University Communications, the site represents a shift of
Stanford academics into the more accessible, modern
domain of the Web, said the office's director Scott Stocker.
You Tube has allowed Stanford to showcase the acade
mic rigor and wide span of courses available at the
University. With more than 25,000 views to date,
Stanford's channel is quickly becoming a means for the
University to provide provocative, educational material to
the public.
"Stanford has been investigating several strategies to
make academic and other University content available on
the Internet," Stocker wrote in an email to The Weekly.
"We were the first university to make content available
in the iTunes Store," he added, referring to the October
2005 launch of Stanford's Apple iTunes U site.
For those who missed Oprah Winfrey's 2008
Commencement address, it can be found on the new chan
nel alongside videos ranging from African American histo
ry to modern physics.
"We are posting a broad range of Stanford-related con
tent, including full courses, faculty lectures and special
events," Stocker said. "Many departments [have) con
tributed content to the site.
"We launched with approximately 200 videos and
expect the site to grow significantly over the coming
years," the communications director added.
Self-proclaimed Web entrepreneur Rob Balian '11 saw
obvious advantages with the University's move toward
online media.

"Stanford is advertising its prestige with the content in
the videos, while also sending the message that it is up-to
date with trends in technology," Balian said. "Obviously
Stanford can benefit from becoming a popular content
source for the teenage population. This can possibly entice
more applicants and highlight some of the University's
more interesting content."
Other students had a slightly different take.
Symbolic Systems major Kevin Leung il said online
academic integration would have a greater impact on other
college campuses that do not have the advantages Stanford
does.
"The advantage is likely to be less for Stanford students
than for students at less prestigious universities or those
who don't have access to higher education at all," Leung
said. "I can easily walk over to a lecture five minutes away
and get the same material, while others may never get that
opportunity."
"The ability for educators and students to have access to
a faculty like Stanford's and their materials if properly
integrated can be a huge boon," he added.
Stocker remains convinced there is no bound to the
advantages of freely distributed content.
"While the You Tube channel is primarily a means to
communicate to the rest of the world about academic life
and research at Stanford, there is great potential for these
technologies to benefit Stanford students and faculty," he
said. "Academic Computing and other groups at Stanford
are investigating ways that these technologies can improve
teaching and learning."
Other top universities — including UC-Berkeley, MIT
and USC — have also employed online video channels.
