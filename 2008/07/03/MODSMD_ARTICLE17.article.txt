## Stu's Views A
						Disappointing Campaign 
### 
The media has hyped this election's set
of nominees as heralding a new era of
postpartisan politics. John McCain is
supposed to be the "maverick" favoring prin
ciple over politics. And Barack Obama is
supposed to be the "postracial," "postparti
san" visionary that will bring America
together.
This was supposed to be the first "posi
tive" campaign in memory with opponents
who actually respect each other. Imagine
that! After the intense bitterness of Bush-
Gore and Bush-Kerry, we could look forward
to an election season of serious debate over
the direction of the United States, instead of
dreading an endless series of attack adver
tisements come late October.
What we have seen emerging from the
candidates, as the campaign heats up, has
been nothing like what the media wants them
to be. Both candidates have been markedly
conventional in their policy positions and
attacks on each other. John McCain talks
almost exclusively about national security
and the "experience" card, knowing that's
the only area where he has a big advantage
over Obama. The Democratic nominee, for
his part, has become markedly less positive in

the weeks since wrapping up the nomination
(and in what seems like his worst fundraising
month).
It is true that Election Day is still four
months away. The campaigns have time to
move to the center and engage in real debate
as the American people start paying more
attention. In a sense though, voters in the pri
maries have been deceived. No Republican
voted for McCain thinking he was truly "con
servative" in the Christian-fundamentalist
sense it has come to mean today. He won
most early states, despite losing self
described "conservatives" in pretty much all
of them. McCain won because of his "maver
ick" credentials, which have eroded precipi
tously in the eight years since his last presi
dential campaign.
For all of John McCain's supposedly
"maverick" principles, he's established him
self well within the Republican mainstream.
The quixotic primary campaign of 2000 has
been replaced by a conventional campaign no
different than the two Bush campaigns â€”
negative and pandering. McCain once
opposed Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy when
they were passed in Congress, but now sup
ports making them permanent. To his credit,

he ii> relatively pro-environment, but his plan
to reduce carbon emissions is so watered
down that it cannot be taken seriously.
McCain has been in a long series of photo
ops with the fundamentalist Christian leaders
he once condemned, while allowing
Republican leaders to attack Obama's wife,
his patriotism and his religion without signif
icant public or private condemnations.
Obama is no better than McCain. He does
not have a single major policy position that
differs significantly from the left wing of
Democratic politics. He is somehow attempt
ing to "unite from the left" and for all of his
supposed bipartisanship, that has not been
shown in the substance of his campaign. It's
unclear how Republicans are supposed to
agree with such huge spending increases.
Obama's rhetoric on trade and the war has put
off many moderates who don't see the easy
solutions (protectionism and a quick with
drawal) that he seems to see. Senator Hillary
Clinton, in the latter stages of the primary,
seemed far more likely to challenge
Democratic orthodoxy than Obama, who was
really running as the outsider/reformer candi
date.
The Obama-McCain contest so far has

been vacuous and conventional. The battle
was supposed to be for the independents and
the moderates in the center, but instead, both
candidates are spending their time mobilizing
their bases and placating the partisan powers
that-be on their respective sides. Maybe that
will change as Election Day draws nearer and
the "undecideds" become more important.
More likely not.
The election season so far raises important
question about how each candidate will gov
ern as president. Both promise to work with
both sides in Congress to reach agreeable
solutions, but we certainly have not seen that
in the rhetoric from both campaigns so far.
For all of the hand-wringing over the biparti
sanship in Congress, neither candidate
seemed inclined to do much about it. That's
disappointing, considering why millions
voted for these candidates and what they
once offered, symbolically and substantively.

Stuart Baimel's summer is insane. Make it
even more so at sbaimel@stanford.edu.
