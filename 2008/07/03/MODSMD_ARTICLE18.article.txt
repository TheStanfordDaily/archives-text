# This Stanford Life
## Worshipping the Stanford Idle Craft 
### 
It is all too common a sight anywhere on
campus: students hunched over their lap
tops, completely absorbed, staring straight
ahead at an Internet browser. In the thick of
finals or on a typical Saturday night, Internet
surfing has become a way of life. In fact, it's
our default method for passing the time.
The Internet is now an element of nature
like the wind or the sun — it's just there.
Wireless on campus is always with us.
Granted, the academic benefits are hugely
positive, and technological developments
always brings skeptics (just ask Gutenberg),
but constant, instant Internet gratification
certainly has its social downsides.
An unlimited pass to the information
superhighway (docs anybody call it that any
more?) brings both isolation and hyper con
nectivity, a disorienting combination. On the
one hand, unlimited access to the Internet
feeds into many Stanford students' favorite
activities: being alone and absorbing new
information. I know I've spent countless
hours reading articles, doing research and
learning on the web. But browsing the
Internet, even in the noise and bustle of the
CoHo, can become a solitary pursuit.
On the other hand, Stanford students are
now aware of a huge amount of up-to-the
minute information, however obscure and
random. Students can now browse the photos
of their friend's friend's Maui vacation, but
have no idea what is going on at the table next
to them
Of course, it wasn't always this way. In
fact, it wasn't this way about five years ago.
The Stanford Daily ran an article on May 28,
2003 touting the emergence of wireless
Internet, but, the article noted,"Stanford's

current network (only) extends to the Main
Quad, Tresidder, Meyer and Green Libraries,
the grad schools, as well as several other
buildings." That's right — in the dark ages of
2003, student residences didn't even have
wireless. Connecting to the Internet was a sta
tionary, and apparently less frequent, pas
time.
Also, according to The Daily, widespread
residential access was still being hammered
out in 2005. A Residential Computing official
at the time said, "With most students bringing
laptops [to school], wireless coverage has
become a factor for ProFros picking which
school to attend that may seem silly, since
data jacks are everywhere, but people arc
coming to expect wireless coverage." How
times have changed.
These recent developments make me won
der what college was like before instant
Internet gratification, in 2001, 1971 or even
1931? What did people do when they were
alone in their rooms? Life back then, as far as
I can tell, was a lot like Internet-free life now,
except all of the time . Being bored back then,
according to a few old timers I asked, meant
seeking out friends, going outside, reading
and more. At worst, people watched televi
sion or listened to radio. Now, being bored
often means perusing some blogs, watching
funny videos or instant messaging. I've gone
whole days without accomplishing anything
that exists tangibly outside of my laptop
screen.

This is not to say that the net result of
Internet's popularity is negative — that would
be absurd. The research and study benefits alone
make wireless access a positive influence in our
lives. Also, a great part of campus and Silicon
Valley would be justifiably angry at me if I said
wireless is a negative influence on our lives.
Rather, this is just a reminder that browsing the
Internet, however tempting, is not a substitute

for more traditional parts of life, like talking in
person or reading a book; that the world on the
screen is not, ultimately, real.
