On the average day in Calcutta,
rickshaw drivers will earn 200
rupees, 70 percent of the milk
consumed by its population
will come from a water buffalo
and all of the women will tie their saris
over their left shoulders. Every year the
city hosts over 500 festivals, hears 64 lan
guages spoken on the streets and juggles
22 political parties, a select few of which
often demonstrate outside the zoo.
A wild infestation of banyan trees
drape themselves over a brick cityscape
reminiscent of nineteenth-century
England, and a mystical air emanates
from the clamoring jumble of chai shops,
mosques, bejeweled Jain temples,
shrines and samosa stands, bedazzling
city visitors.
Three years ago 1 promised Vinod (an
alias for a friend of the reporter who
wishes to remain anonymous for privacy
reasons) that someday 1 would visit his
home in Calcutta, India. I made the
promise my first year in college while our
friendship formed over pre-packaged,
microwavable Indian food shared at
three in the morning.
At the time, 1 assumed I wouldn't be
packing my bags anytime soon — that
Vinod would follow the typical "hooked
on the system," apres-graduation track
and stay in the States to start out. Instead,
after shedding his cap and gown he
jumped on a flight back to South Asia to
start a business bringing affordable
renewable energy to poor communities in
India.
Vinod joined the increasing number of
graduates planning to start their lives out
side of stars and stripes territory and
inside the social sector. "Boston" and
"banking" are no longer the only popular
responses to the question, "So where are
you headed after graduation?" First
world metropolises have fallen onto lists
of have-been graduate destinations, while
nontraditional "do-good" careers — and
the booming nightlife in Bangkok, Beijing
and Bangalore — have begun to lure
young professionals in sizeable flocks.
After deciding last summer to take a
year off from university life to live in
China, I got a chance to make good on my
promise to visit Vinod. India was just a
hop over the border, and I was itching to
compare these two rising world powers.
Calcutta would be my first stop on the
subcontinent.
Seasoned older travelers balked at my
plan. "Calcutta is the cesspool of India,"
they warned. "Why don't you go some
where nice?"
Calcutta was the first in-post of the
British in India, located at the mouth of
the holy Ganges River in East India in the

avidly communist state of West Bengal.
Calcuttans will say they would rather
teach their sons poetry than business, and
people worldwide know the city as
Mother Teresa's home base for her works
of charity. By and large, though, the world
remembers Calcutta as the site of India's
first and most violent partition riots,
which broke out in 1946 between Hindus
and Muslims, leaving over 4,000 dead, as
well as prompting one of Gandhi's longest

hunger strikes and preceding the eventual
partition of India and Pakistan.
Today, perceptions have changed.
When most young adults think of India, it
is Bangalore, Bombay, Bollywood and a
great place to identify and address unmet
social needs at the bottom of the pyramid
that come to mind.
I arrived in Calcutta one night at the
end of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights,
ready to investigate at least one destina-

doing good, now more than ever."

tion chosen by this migratory population
of young professionals. What attractions
lay behind their flight from traditional
corporate careers into the growing field of
social enterprise, where you can make
money but "do good" at the same time?
Tropical evening air settled invitingly
around my shoulders as I stepped under a
talisman of green chilis and lemons
tacked onto the doorframe to ward off the
evil eye. Inside the hallway, flickering

candles and soft white lights illuminated
small stone idols of the goddess Lakshmi
surrounded by fresh flowers, and on the
wall to my left hung a painting of Ganesh,
the popular Hindu god distinguished by a
wise elephant head. As I paused to stare
quizzically at a Buddha figure, Vinod's
aunt offered me a glass of panna, a thick,
forest-green juice made with raw mangos
and a walloping dose of spices.
"Hinduism is all-inclusive," she

remarked, motioning at the figure. "We
celebrate all gods and goddesses. Buddha
is the ninth incarnation of Vishnu."
Vinod wanted me to wade deeper into
Calcutta's religious communities so that I
could begin to understand the myriad cul
tural complexities of the communities he
works with. Vinod thus introduced me to
Santimoy Bhattacharya, or Santi for
short. A family friend and ex-history-pro
fessor-turned-professional-Calcutta-tour-
guide, his business card bore the Delphic
promise of "enlightenment experiences."
His eyes glimmered behind thick glass
es and his mouth was already open, rat
tling off facts when he greeted me.
"Calcutta has 82 hospitals, five million
Bangladeshi immigrants, and did you
know that the rickshaw was introduced by
the Chinese after the British brought
them here to work on the sugar cane
crops?" Without missing a beat he
lurched forward on a weathered wooden
cane, and hurriedly ushered us like his
children into his car. "There is no time to
waste, I must show you Calcutta."
To many people it may still seem odd
that Vinod would trade in California for
Calcutta. After all, he gave up paved
roads traversed by purring Prii for chron
ically congested streets stuffed with old,
puttering, yellow and white Ambassadors
(British-style taxis you'll only find in
Calcutta) and clogged by imperious cattle
with drooping bellies and jutting ribs.
What they must recognize is that com
ing to understanding and working to solve
social and environmental problems —
such as climate change, homelessness,
unemployment or lack of access to educa
tion— demands highly complex and cre
ative thinking. This is a huge part of the
appeal to talented undergraduates choos
ing to pursue nontraditional careers in
social entrepreneurship and public ser
vice: Difficult problems without formula
ic solutions attract bright minds looking
to make a living while doing good, now
more than ever.
Santi's tour makes its first stop on
Rabindra Street. Hordes of bleating white
goats obscure every patch of sidewalk
that isn't already occupied by men frying
chapatis, twisting hot golden sugar into
candies, or selling a multihued rainbow of
hand-woven scarves. We pull over and
step out into the baking hot tumult. This
is a Muslim quarter of the city, and our
visit coincides with the lead-up to the
Muslim festival Eid, a religious celebra
tion of the end of the fasting month of
Ramadan, and a time to gather family for
meals and to offer prayers to Allah.
Although Muslims represent a minority
13 percent in India, the country's popula
tion of approximately 1.1 billion makes it
the third largest Muslim nation in the

The city holds the potential for many intellectual challenges when it comes to resource
management and other ventures.
