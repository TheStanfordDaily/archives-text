# Editor's Welcome
## The 						most "Stanford" time of year As strange as it is, summer at Stanford is alive with stories 
### 
Summer at Stanford is strange. Compared
to the regular school year, not much has
changed: Many of us are in dorms, fre
quenting certain buildings, hanging out with the
same friends and facing up to some form of
work — research, an internship, camp counsel
ing or something entirely different.
But at the same time, summer at Stanford is
probably the most beautiful and most uniquely
"Stanford" time of the year. Many of us are
finally taking advantage of the campus hotspots
we couldn't always make it to, laying on the
grass to get a California tan, playing ultimate
Frisbee and, dare 1 say it, also getting some rest.
It's the epitome of the Stanford experience
— or at least the one we were sold on and have
since tried living up to — yet it's lacking the
classes, the hustle and bustle (of people, not
construction) around White Plaza and the gen-

eral campus spirit that truly comes alive at the
start of fall quarter.
It's at this strange time then, that I get to
welcome you to another volume of The
Stanford Daily (or The Weekly, to be more cor
rect). This isn't the ideal situation, I have to say,
for introducing myself as Vol. 234 Editor-in-
Chief, my goals for the coming months and my
thoughts on The Stanford Daily and its place in
the community. Rather, this seems like an early
hello — a slight preview of what's to come,
when everything isn't truly ready and the cam
pus doesn't seem to be firing on all cylinders.
But I can't deny it: The campus is still thriv

ing, there's still news popping up from unex
pected places and there are still people with sto
ries to tell and ideas to share. People wonder
why The Daily continues publishing over the
summer when most students aren't even here,
but looking at these pages, 1 think you'll see
why.
We may seem to be living in a strange kind
of limbo, with the quintessential Stanford social
life, but not exactly the academic life; the many
opportunities available, but not that jam
packed schedule; and the same places and faces,
but not the same atmosphere; but for me, it's
just another night at The Daily — albeit in my
own office now — and this issue is just another
showcase of Stanford, its people, events, con
troversies, accomplishments and more.
This is The Stanford Weekly, and welcome
to what continues to be Stanford — even if it
does seem a little different.
