## STANFORD BASEBALL Bulldogs spoil Cardinal run Stanford one of last four teams standing in Omaha, but falls to Georgia twice in CWS 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SPORTS EDITOR 
It wasn't quite what the Cardinal had hoped
for, but considering that preseason predictions
had pegged Stanford baseball as just the sixth
best team in the Pac-10, finishing among the four
best teams at the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb. has to be seen as a tremendous
accomplishment.
After advancing through the double-elimina
tion regional the squad hosted at Sunken
Diamond and sweeping the Titans in a best-of
three series in Fullerton, Calif., the Cardinal was
one of eight teams to earn a trip to the Mecca of
collegiate baseball, Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium.
There, the Cardinal faced another double-elimi
nation bracket in which it was paired with No. 4
Florida State, No. 1 Miami and No. 8 Georgia.
Stanford got off to a rollicking start, demol
ishing the fourth-ranked Seminoles and their
potent offense 16-5, thanks to an 11-run rally in
the ninth.
"This was one of those games, you talk about
a roller coaster..." longtime FSU coach Mike
Martin said in a postgame press conference. "We
were excited as can be when we tied it up in the
home run, but then the wheels came off. But you
have to give credit to Stanford — they hit the ball
around and got it done in that last inning."
Stanford starter, rising senior Jeremy Bleich,

drafted in the First Supplemental Round by the
New York Yankees just a week earlier, largely
shut down perhaps the nation's most effective
offense, allowing only one earned run on six hits
through five innings of work. But the Cardinal
bullpen allowed three runs in the bottom of the
eighth to tie the game at 5-5 heading into the
ninth.
The Stanford offense came alive, however,
thanks to a flurry of six hits and a pair of Florida
State errors. Capping the Cardinal rally was ris
ing senior Brent Milleville's three-run home run,
which put an exclamation mark at the close of the
top half of the inning. Rising sophomore Michael
Marshall closed out the game for the Cardinal
with a scoreless ninth, and Stanford moved on to
face Georgia in the second round of College
World Series play.
The Bulldogs proved to be a tougher oppo
nent for the Cardinal, and the 4-3 defeat they
handed the Stanford squad on June 16 proved to
be a devastating blow to the team's champi
onship hopes.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead with a
three-run third inning, making the most of three
big hits. Rising sophomore Zach Jones led off the
inning with a triple and was driven in by fellow
rising sophomore Jack Schlander's groundout to
short. Rising senior Joey August's two-out dou
ble was followed by rising senior Jason Castro's
homer to right, putting the Cardinal on top, 3-0.
But the Dawgs would chip away at Stanford's
lead, scoring one run in the fourth and another in
the sixth when Georgia's Robbie O'Bryan drew a
walk with the bases loaded. The deciding blow,
however, came in the seventh, as the Bulldogs

mustered all of their offense with two outs, riding
a single, a walk, a hit batsman and another single
to a pair of runs and a one-run lead. The Georgia
bullpen, meanwhile, held solid, allowing just one
hit and no runs following the Cardinal s third
inning offensive outburst.
The loss meant that the Cardinal was bounced
into the loser's bracket, and would have to defeat
Miami once and Georgia twice in a row in order
to advance to the Finals. Georgia, meanwhile,
got an opportunity to rest for a few days and
would only need to defeat the winner of the
Stanford-Miami contest once. It was an advan
tage the Cardinal ultimately proved unable to
overcome.
"It's a huge advantage to win this winner's
game because you sit for three days," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said in a postgame press
conference. "You just take it game-by-game. If
you look at how difficult it is to come back, it
becomes impossible. Especially after this season,
the number of games isn't going to bother us."
Stanford took a solid first step towards
redemption on June 18 against the Hurricanes,
pounding out an 8-3 win on the strength of eleven
hits, four of them for extra bases. Among the
offensive leaders for the Cardinal were rising
senior and second baseman Cord Phelps, who
went 3-for-5, scored a run and collected a pair of
RBI, as well as fellow rising senior Sean Ratliff
who swatted a two-run home run — his 22nd
blast of the season.
On the mound, meanwhile, rising sophomore
Danny Sandbrink was solid yet again, allowing
just one earned run through four innings. Davis
in relief was somewhat of a high-wire act, as the
Cardinal senior allowed seven hits and walked a
pair in his four innings of work, but he limited
Miami to just a pair of runs over that span before
Storen came on for a scoreless ninth.
Stanford's success against Miami meant a sec
ond shot at Georgia, but this time the Cardinal
would have to win two in a row to advance. The
Dawgs jumped out to an early 9-4 lead through
the first five innings and added another run in the
top of the eighth, putting a six-run cushion
between themselves and Stanford.
But the Cardinal offense would put forth one
last gasp before the end of its season, rallying for
four runs in the bottom of the ninth against
vaunted Georgia closer Josh Fields before
Stanford's 2008 season would come to a close.
Rising sophomore Ben Clowe hit a two-out,
three-run homer to put the Cardinal just two
back before Phelps flied out to center to end the
game. The Bulldogs would go on to the College
World Series Finals, where they fell to Fresno
State, two games to one.
"[Georgia is] a great team," Marquess told
GoStanford.com following the game. "They were
too much for us today. We couldn't stop them.
We played them twice here, and they're a better
team than we are.
"As far as our team is concerned, I'm very
proud of this team," he continued. "We surprised
a lot of people, including me. This (College
World Series) is a great experience for all of us,
not only the coaches, but most importantly the
student-athletes. I'm proud of how we competed.
This game belongs to a stronger team in
Georgia."
The Cardinal finished its season at 41-24-2,
and was one of the last four teams left standing in
postseason play, along with Georgia, North
Carolina and eventual champion Fresno State.

Rising senior Jeremy Bleich led the Cardinal pitching staff deep into the postseason after returning from
an injury that kept him sidelined for well over a month in late May. But Bleich and his teammates ran
into a wall against Georgia. The Bulldogs defeated Stanford twice in Omaha, Neb., 4-3 and 10-8.

On the mound, meanwhile, rising sophomore
Danny Sandbrink was solid yet again, allowing
just one earned run through four innings. Davis
in relief was somewhat of a high-wire act, as the
Cardinal senior allowed seven hits and walked a
pair in his four innings of work, but he limited
Miami to just a pair of runs over that span before
Storen came on for a scoreless ninth.
Stanford's success against Miami meant a sec
ond shot at Georgia, but this time the Cardinal
would have to win two in a row to advance. The
Dawgs jumped out to an early 9-4 lead through
the first five innings and added another run in the
top of the eighth, putting a six-run cushion
between themselves and Stanford.
But the Cardinal offense would put forth one
last gasp before the end of its season, rallying for
four runs in the bottom of the ninth against
vaunted Georgia closer Josh Fields before
Stanford's 2008 season would come to a close.
Rising sophomore Ben Clowe hit a two-out,
three-run homer to put the Cardinal just two
back before Phelps flied out to center to end the
game. The Bulldogs would go on to the College
World Series Finals, where they fell to Fresno
State, two games to one.
"[Georgia is] a great team," Marquess told
GoStanford.com following the game. "They were
too much for us today. We couldn't stop them.
We played them twice here, and they're a better
team than we are.
"As far as our team is concerned, I'm very
proud of this team," he continued. "We surprised
a lot of people, including me. This (College
World Series) is a great experience for all of us,
not only the coaches, but most importantly the
student-athletes. I'm proud of how we competed.
This game belongs to a stronger team in
Georgia."
The Cardinal finished its season at 41-24-2,
and was one of the last four teams left standing in
postseason play, along with Georgia, North
Carolina and eventual champion Fresno State.

Rising senior Jeremy Bleich led the Cardinal pitching staff deep into the postseason after returning from
an injury that kept him sidelined for well over a month in late May. But Bleich and his teammates ran
into a wall against Georgia. The Bulldogs defeated Stanford twice in Omaha, Neb., 4-3 and 10-8.
It wasn't quite what the Cardinal had hoped
for, but considering that preseason predictions
had pegged Stanford baseball as just the sixth
best team in the Pac-10, finishing among the four
best teams at the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb. has to be seen as a tremendous
accomplishment.
After advancing through the double-elimina
tion regional the squad hosted at Sunken
Diamond and sweeping the Titans in a best-of
three series in Fullerton, Calif., the Cardinal was
one of eight teams to earn a trip to the Mecca of
collegiate baseball, Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium.
There, the Cardinal faced another double-elimi
nation bracket in which it was paired with No. 4
Florida State, No. 1 Miami and No. 8 Georgia.
Stanford got off to a rollicking start, demol
ishing the fourth-ranked Seminoles and their
potent offense 16-5, thanks to an 11-run rally in
the ninth.
"This was one of those games, you talk about
a roller coaster..." longtime FSU coach Mike
Martin said in a postgame press conference. "We
were excited as can be when we tied it up in the
home run, but then the wheels came off. But you
have to give credit to Stanford — they hit the ball
around and got it done in that last inning."
Stanford starter, rising senior Jeremy Bleich,

drafted in the First Supplemental Round by the
New York Yankees just a week earlier, largely
shut down perhaps the nation's most effective
offense, allowing only one earned run on six hits
through five innings of work. But the Cardinal
bullpen allowed three runs in the bottom of the
eighth to tie the game at 5-5 heading into the
ninth.
The Stanford offense came alive, however,
thanks to a flurry of six hits and a pair of Florida
State errors. Capping the Cardinal rally was ris
ing senior Brent Milleville's three-run home run,
which put an exclamation mark at the close of the
top half of the inning. Rising sophomore Michael
Marshall closed out the game for the Cardinal
with a scoreless ninth, and Stanford moved on to
face Georgia in the second round of College
World Series play.
The Bulldogs proved to be a tougher oppo
nent for the Cardinal, and the 4-3 defeat they
handed the Stanford squad on June 16 proved to
be a devastating blow to the team's champi
onship hopes.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead with a
three-run third inning, making the most of three
big hits. Rising sophomore Zach Jones led off the
inning with a triple and was driven in by fellow
rising sophomore Jack Schlander's groundout to
short. Rising senior Joey August's two-out dou
ble was followed by rising senior Jason Castro's
homer to right, putting the Cardinal on top, 3-0.
But the Dawgs would chip away at Stanford's
lead, scoring one run in the fourth and another in
the sixth when Georgia's Robbie O'Bryan drew a
walk with the bases loaded. The deciding blow,
however, came in the seventh, as the Bulldogs

mustered all of their offense with two outs, riding
a single, a walk, a hit batsman and another single
to a pair of runs and a one-run lead. The Georgia
bullpen, meanwhile, held solid, allowing just one
hit and no runs following the Cardinal s third
inning offensive outburst.
The loss meant that the Cardinal was bounced
into the loser's bracket, and would have to defeat
Miami once and Georgia twice in a row in order
to advance to the Finals. Georgia, meanwhile,
got an opportunity to rest for a few days and
would only need to defeat the winner of the
Stanford-Miami contest once. It was an advan
tage the Cardinal ultimately proved unable to
overcome.
"It's a huge advantage to win this winner's
game because you sit for three days," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said in a postgame press
conference. "You just take it game-by-game. If
you look at how difficult it is to come back, it
becomes impossible. Especially after this season,
the number of games isn't going to bother us."
Stanford took a solid first step towards
redemption on June 18 against the Hurricanes,
pounding out an 8-3 win on the strength of eleven
hits, four of them for extra bases. Among the
offensive leaders for the Cardinal were rising
senior and second baseman Cord Phelps, who
went 3-for-5, scored a run and collected a pair of
RBI, as well as fellow rising senior Sean Ratliff
who swatted a two-run home run — his 22nd
blast of the season.
