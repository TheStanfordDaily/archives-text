# Bay waves bye-bye to Baron
## 
### 
It's risky to write a column on a
deadline about a story that's clearly
still developing. As I've discovered
a few too many times, it can be easy to
look really foolish in retrospect after
your predictions are totally contradict
ed by reality or else rendered com
pletely irrelevant by unforeseen
events.
So please understand that when 1
write this column about the absolutely
devastating nature of Baron Davis'
departure from the Bay Area sports
scene, I do so assuming a few things:
that Gilbert Arenas will resign from
the Wizards and not rejoin the Golden
State Warriors, that Elton Brand will
decide to follow through on his end of
the Davis defection and re-up with the
Clippers to play alongside Baron and
that no other true superstar suddenly
emerges onto the free agency and/or
trade scene who wants to take the
Warriors' money.
But if you take those factors as a
given (and I for one think you pretty
much should at this point), then you
have to understand that independent
of how much Baron actually has left in
the proverbial tank, his departure is
yet another blow to a sports market
that is practically hemorrhaging star
power.
There was a time, once, when the
Bay Area was the home to plenty of
sports megastars, and why not? As one
of the biggest markets in the country,
it's only natural that some of the
nation's biggest athletic stars would be
willing to play in front of a huge audi
ence, but lately that dynamic seems to
be shifting.
The 49ers have fallen from being a
perennial contender to a league door
mat. The Raiders? Maybe worse. The
Giants have fallen completely off the
map since the departure of Bonds
while the A's continue to compete
with a roster devoid of any big names
and the Sharks play in a sport no one
watches (unless they have a cable net
work most have never heard of). Even
the occasional competitive blip from
Stanford or Cal on the college scene
rarely seems to make a dent on the
national attention span.
But the Warriors? For a brief
moment, they were different. They
were a collection of misfits, castaways
and unprovens — the injury-prone
veterans and untested youth. And they
just played different. Don Nelson's
helter-skelter, chaotic approach went


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
even a step beyond the dynamic
offensive scheme of the Phoenix Suns.
The motto was run, score and run
some more.
And then there were the 2007 play
offs. Never has there been a more
impressive run to just the second
round of the NBA postseason, as the
Warriors captured the attention of the
nation with their upset of the top
seeded Dallas Mavericks — the first
upset of a top seed in the first round in
a seven-game series in NBA history.
In part, it was the personalities
involved. Dirk Nowitzki having just
been named the NBA MVP before
suddenly looking positively soft
against Golden State gave the
Warriors a measure of pluck. So too
did the less-than-friendly relationship
between Warriors coach Don Nelson
and his old boss, Mark Cuban. So too
did Stephen Jackson's reemergence as
a basketball player, rather than a
brawler. The sea of yellow "We
Believe" t-shirts and the rollicking
atmosphere at Oracle Arena didn't
hurt either.
But it was, perhaps, Baron's emer
gence as a bonafide superstar that
gave the Warriors' postseason run its
true panache. There was no doubt
that he was the face of the franchise,
and no doubt about how much fun he
was having, proving to the world that
yes, he really is that good. Hie kind of
good that is purely unstoppable when
it wants to be.
That momentum carried forward
into the next series, as Davis' dunk
over Utah's Andrei Kirilenko was one
of the most memorable dunks in
recent years. And the image that will
forever slick in the minds of NBA fans
who watched that postseason is of an
upstart, rebellious group of slashing,
exciting scorers, led by their dynamic,
bearded captain, who finally became
the star he was meant to be as all the
stars aligned for Golden State to top
ple a Dallas giant.
Flash forward to now —to a
Bay Area sports scene that has lost
the Lopez twins, lost Bonds a year
ago, lost any football relevance half
a decade ago and now has lost
Baron.
If things don't, gtart looking up
soon, there could be„an awful lot of
local fans who could find themselves
glued to their computers and televi
sions. looking for a glimpse back to
the spring of 2007, when for a brief
moment, Bay Area sports mattered.
So perhaps, in reality, Davis hasn't
gone too far after all. Geographically
he may have flown to SoCal, but the
memories of local diehards can't and
won't let the Baron era fade away.
