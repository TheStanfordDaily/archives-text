# Bay waves bye-bye to Baron
## 
### 
It's risky to write a column on a
deadline about a story that's clearly
still developing. As I've discovered
a few too many times, it can be easy to
look really foolish in retrospect after
your predictions are totally contradict
ed by reality or else rendered com
pletely irrelevant by unforeseen
events.
So please understand that when 1
write this column about the absolutely
devastating nature of Baron Davis'
departure from the Bay Area sports
scene, I do so assuming a few things:
that Gilbert Arenas will resign from
the Wizards and not rejoin the Golden
State Warriors, that Elton Brand will
decide to follow through on his end of
the Davis defection and re-up with the
Clippers to play alongside Baron and
that no other true superstar suddenly
emerges onto the free agency and/or
trade scene who wants to take the
Warriors' money.
But if you take those factors as a
given (and I for one think you pretty

have to understand that independent
of how much Baron actually has left in
the proverbial tank, his departure is
yet another blow to a sports market
that is practically hemorrhaging star
power.
There was a time, once, when the
Bay Area was the home to plenty of
sports megastars, and why not? As one
of the biggest markets in the country,
it's only natural that some of the
nation's biggest athletic stars would be
willing to play in front of a huge audi
ence, but lately that dynamic seems to
be shifting.
The 49ers have fallen from being a
perennial contender to a league door
mat. The Raiders? Maybe worse. The
Giants have fallen completely off the
map since the departure of Bonds
while the A's continue to compete
with a roster devoid of any big names
and the Sharks play in a sport no one
watches (unless they have a cable net
work most have never heard of). Even
the occasional competitive blip from
Stanford or Cal on the college scene
rarely seems to make a dent on the
national attention span.
But the Warriors? For a brief
moment, they were different. They
were a collection of misfits, castaways
and unprovens â€” the injury-prone
veterans and untested youth. And they
just played different. Don Nelson's
helter-skelter, chaotic approach went
