## Twins stand tall in NBA Draft 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
The 2008 NBA draft took place a week ago, but
as past drafts have shown, its ramifications are
sure to last for years, even decades.
Just ask the Portland Trail Blazers, who took
Sam Bowie before Michael Jordan during the 1984
draft in what is still considered to be the biggest
draft-day folly ever. Or take a look at the
Charlotte Hornets, who deftly drafted a guy
named Kobe Bryant with the thirteenth pick in the
19% draft, only to send him off to the Lakers for
aging center Vlade Divac.

Brook Lopez was selected tenth overall in the NBA
Draft and will play professional ball with the New
Jersey Nets. The former Cardinal big man slipped
a bit, as it was expected that he might be selected
as highly as third overall by Minnesota.

In any case, whether your team is among the
winners or the losers, draft night is a big deal. And
this year it was as big as it's been in a long while for
Stanford as Brook and Robin Lopez, mainstays on
campus for the past two years, were taken 10th
ana 15th, respectively. But more than just a big
night for a pair of former Cardinal difference
makers, the 2008 NBA Draft was a sign of just
how highly the Pac-10's talent level is regarded on
a national level. Twelve players from the confer
ence were selected in the draft, with seven of those
going in the first round and four in the top-10
picks.
With so much attention clearly being paid to
college basketball out west by NBA general man
agers, it's time to take a look at the conference's
picks and how their futures are shaping up in the
association. Here's a rundown of what went down
for the twins and for the rest of the Pac-10's talent:
Brook Lopez: 10th to the New Jersey Nets
This wasn't the best scenario possible for
Brook, considering some people thought he
could go as high as third to the Minnesota
Timberwolves. Many GMs overlooked his num
bers and performance this year, instead focusing
on his workout numbers, where he did not
impress as much. That said, with his sweet shot
and seven-foot frame, there's no reason Brook
can't be an effective center, or even a force, in the
NBA.
As Brook's brother, Robin, told the Associated
Press: "They really picked up a steal at No. 10."
Ironically, Brook will be teaming with Cal for
ward Ryan Anderson, whom the Nets selected
with the twenty-first pick. The two will apparently
get along, according to Anderson.
"Everyone hypes up the rivalry between the
schools," Anderson said to the Philadelphia
Inquirer. "I think we have a lot of respect for each
other. It was a privilege to play against him and
now it will be a privilege to play with him."
Robin Lopez: 15th to the Phoenix Suns
Many people (myself included) questioned
Robin's decision to leave following his sopho
more season, but it ultimately paid dividends on
draft night. This was the best-case scenario for
Robin, as most thought he would go in the late
first round or even possibly slip into the second.
He'll also get to learn from two of the best big
men in the business: Shaquille O'Neal and
Amare Stoudemire. What center wouldn't kill for
a chance like that?
USC's O.J. Mayo: 3rd to the Minnesota
Timberwolves, traded to the Memphis Grizzlies
O.J. Mayo has had a cult-like fan following
since his sophomore year in high school, so it was
no surprise when he was selected with the third
overall pick in the draft. Some even thought that
Miami's Pat Riley would take him second over
Michael Beasley. As things turned out, he was
traded to Memphis a few hours after the draft con
cluded in exchange for Kevin Love, formerly of
UCLA.
Mayo has the size and scoring ability to be a big
contributor in the NBA, but I'm not sold on his
ability to lead a team after watching USC this sea
son. That said, he's well-spoken and mature
beyond his years, by all accounts, so I think he'll
do just fine in the League.

Former Stanford standout Robin Lopez surprised
many by declaring for the draft following his
sophomore season, but the decision paid off as he
was selected 15th by the Suns. Lopez finds himself
joining a high-profile frontcourt in Phoenix, featur
ing Shaquille O'Neal and Amare Stoudemire.
UCLA's Russell Westbrook: 4th to the Seattle
Supersonics
This may have been the biggest surprise of the
draft. Named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Year, Westbrook was viewed as a lottery pick, but
no one thought he'd go this high.
For what it's worth, I thought this pick was jus
tified, as Westbrook is an elite athlete, has an
incredible work ethic (he went from barely playing
his freshman year to being one of the Bruins' best
players this past year) and is still improving. Most
of all, he's no fear and all swagger. Just check out
You Tube and you'll see that he has no reserva
tions in going for a dunk on anyone.
If Westbrook polishes his offensive game, he
has the potential to join the likes of Chris Paul,
Deron Williams and Derrick Rose as one of the
exciting up-and-coming point guards in the NBA.


Maybe I'm being too hasty in mak
ing a prediction like this, but his per
formance (aside from free-throw
shooting) was just that good down
the stretch of the college season and
in the tournament. I could rave
about this guy for ages, but I'll stop
since our articles can only carry on
so long.
UCLA's Kevin Love: sth to
Memphis, traded to Minnesota
What else is there to say about
Love? He was the media darling of
college basketball this past year and
it was well-deserved. Love is skilled
like no other, but his size and ath
leticism are question marks as he
takes on the next level. He'll defi
nitely be a solid player, but I person
ally would have gone against the
conventional wisdom and taken a
more dominant big man (i.e. Brook
Lopez) if it were my decision.
Arizona's Jerryd Bayless: 11th to
the Portland Trail Blazers
I only got to see Bayless play a
few times this year, but I've never
been in love with him the way every
one else was. He's a great scorer and
quick, but many thought he was a
shoo-in top-10 or even top-five pick.
I think the Trail Blazers taking him
at No. 11 was justified.
Cal's Ryan Anderson: 21st to New
Jersey
As mentioned before, it'll be
interesting to see Anderson and
Brook Lopez suiting up together
(assuming that they both get a fair
share of minutes). Anderson
reminds me of a poor man's Dirk
Nowitzki with his size and outside
shooting. But of course, a poor
man's Dirk Nowitzki isn't poor in
the grand scheme of things â€” espe
cially given the amount of money
guaranteed by a first-round contract.

UCLA's Luc Richard Mbah a
Moute: 37th to the Milwaukee
Bucks
If Mbah a Moute is going to
make it in the NBA, it'll be because
of two things: defense and rebound
ing. He's big for a small forward, he
can move and he can defend after
three years under UCLA coach Ben
Howland, so I'd give him the benefit
of the doubt when it comes to mak
ing a team.
Washington State's Kyle Weaver.
38th to the Charlotte Bobcats
Kyle Weaver has been over
looked during his time as a Cougar,
but he certainly has a good chance of
making it in the pros. He's long and
athletic, and can definitely find a
niche coming off the bench as a two
guard. Like Westbrook, he just has
to work on his shooting and on pol
ishing his offensive game, but the
talent is there.
Oregon's Malik Hairston: 48th to
the Phoenix Suns, traded to the San
Antonio Spurs
Hairston came to Oregon with
the hopes of "Carmelo-izing" the
Ducks, but hs was nothing more
than a solid player in college. If I was
a gambling man (which I am), I'd
bet that he won't make it in the pros
in the long run.
Cal's DeVon Hardin: 50th to Seattle
For years, people have raved
about Hardin's size and athleticism.
Unfortunately, in part due to
injuries, he hasn't realized his poten
tial that everyone speaks of. We'll
see if he can turn it around in the
NBA.
Oregon's Maarty Leunen: 54th to
Houston
He was decent in college. But
decent probably won't cut it in the
NBA.
