## Twins stand tall in NBA Draft 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
The 2008 NBA draft took place a week ago, but
as past drafts have shown, its ramifications are
sure to last for years, even decades.
Just ask the Portland Trail Blazers, who took
Sam Bowie before Michael Jordan during the 1984
draft in what is still considered to be the biggest
draft-day folly ever. Or take a look at the
Charlotte Hornets, who deftly drafted a guy
named Kobe Bryant with the thirteenth pick in the
19% draft, only to send him off to the Lakers for
aging center Vlade Divac.

Brook Lopez was selected tenth overall in the NBA
Draft and will play professional ball with the New
Jersey Nets. The former Cardinal big man slipped
a bit, as it was expected that he might be selected
as highly as third overall by Minnesota.

In any case, whether your team is among the
winners or the losers, draft night is a big deal. And
this year it was as big as it's been in a long while for
Stanford as Brook and Robin Lopez, mainstays on
campus for the past two years, were taken 10th
ana 15th, respectively. But more than just a big
night for a pair of former Cardinal difference
makers, the 2008 NBA Draft was a sign of just
how highly the Pac-10's talent level is regarded on
a national level. Twelve players from the confer
ence were selected in the draft, with seven of those
going in the first round and four in the top-10
picks.
With so much attention clearly being paid to
college basketball out west by NBA general man
agers, it's time to take a look at the conference's
picks and how their futures are shaping up in the
association. Here's a rundown of what went down
for the twins and for the rest of the Pac-10's talent:
Brook Lopez: 10th to the New Jersey Nets
This wasn't the best scenario possible for
Brook, considering some people thought he
could go as high as third to the Minnesota
Timberwolves. Many GMs overlooked his num
bers and performance this year, instead focusing
on his workout numbers, where he did not
impress as much. That said, with his sweet shot
and seven-foot frame, there's no reason Brook
can't be an effective center, or even a force, in the
NBA.
As Brook's brother, Robin, told the Associated
Press: "They really picked up a steal at No. 10."
Ironically, Brook will be teaming with Cal for
ward Ryan Anderson, whom the Nets selected
with the twenty-first pick. The two will apparently
get along, according to Anderson.
"Everyone hypes up the rivalry between the
schools," Anderson said to the Philadelphia
Inquirer. "I think we have a lot of respect for each
other. It was a privilege to play against him and
now it will be a privilege to play with him."
Robin Lopez: 15th to the Phoenix Suns
Many people (myself included) questioned
Robin's decision to leave following his sopho
more season, but it ultimately paid dividends on
draft night. This was the best-case scenario for
Robin, as most thought he would go in the late
first round or even possibly slip into the second.
He'll also get to learn from two of the best big
men in the business: Shaquille O'Neal and
Amare Stoudemire. What center wouldn't kill for
a chance like that?
USC's O.J. Mayo: 3rd to the Minnesota
Timberwolves, traded to the Memphis Grizzlies
O.J. Mayo has had a cult-like fan following
since his sophomore year in high school, so it was
no surprise when he was selected with the third
overall pick in the draft. Some even thought that
Miami's Pat Riley would take him second over
Michael Beasley. As things turned out, he was
traded to Memphis a few hours after the draft con
cluded in exchange for Kevin Love, formerly of
UCLA.
Mayo has the size and scoring ability to be a big
contributor in the NBA, but I'm not sold on his
ability to lead a team after watching USC this sea
son. That said, he's well-spoken and mature
beyond his years, by all accounts, so I think he'll
do just fine in the League.

Former Stanford standout Robin Lopez surprised
many by declaring for the draft following his
sophomore season, but the decision paid off as he
was selected 15th by the Suns. Lopez finds himself
joining a high-profile frontcourt in Phoenix, featur
ing Shaquille O'Neal and Amare Stoudemire.
UCLA's Russell Westbrook: 4th to the Seattle
Supersonics
This may have been the biggest surprise of the
draft. Named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Year, Westbrook was viewed as a lottery pick, but
no one thought he'd go this high.
For what it's worth, I thought this pick was jus
tified, as Westbrook is an elite athlete, has an
incredible work ethic (he went from barely playing
his freshman year to being one of the Bruins' best
players this past year) and is still improving. Most
of all, he's no fear and all swagger. Just check out
You Tube and you'll see that he has no reserva
tions in going for a dunk on anyone.
If Westbrook polishes his offensive game, he
has the potential to join the likes of Chris Paul,
Deron Williams and Derrick Rose as one of the
exciting up-and-coming point guards in the NBA.
