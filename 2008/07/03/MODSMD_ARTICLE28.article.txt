Stanford wins 14th consecutive U.S. Sports
Academy Directors' Cup

The Cardinal came out on top yet again in the
annual quest for the Directors' Cup, awarded by
the National Association of Collegiate Athletic
Directors of America, the United States Sports
Academy and USA Today to the best overall
intercollegiate athletic program in the country.
Stanford earned 1,461.00 total points in the
final rankings, nearly 300 points better than its

nearest competition, UCLA. Stanford boasted
an impressive 12 top-five finishes in various
sports, including a national championship in
women's cross country and second place finishes
in women's volleyball, women's basketball,
men's gymnastics and men's golf.
Stanford teams tallied 315 points for the fall,
767 points for the winter and 468 points for the
spring.
Points are earned based upon how well indi
vidual teams finish, but only 20 scores in total can

be added together for the final point total —10
each for men's and women's athletics.
The Cardinal finished second behind North
Carolina in the first-ever presentation of the
Directors' Cup for the 1993-94 school year, but
has been unbeatable since, winning the award
for 14 consecutive years. UCLA has finished sec
ond six times since the award's inception, includ
ing each of the past three years as well as the
1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years.

Dawkins puts finishing touches
on coaching staff

New men's basketball coach Johnny Dawkins
announced the hiring of a trio of new assistant
coaches as Dick Davey, Rodney Tention and
Mike Schrage will join Stanford for the 2008-09
season. Schrage follows Dawkins from Duke to
the Farm, while Davey, the most notable of the
three additions, was a four-time West
Coast Conference Coach of the Year
at Santa Clara, where he served as
head coach of the Broncos for 15 sea
sons prior to his retirement at the end
of the 2006-07 season.
Davey's Broncos racked up a 251-
190 record on his watch and earned
three trips to the NCAA
Tournament. The new Cardinal assis
tant will be key in helping the rest of
the new coaching staff navigate the
unfamiliar waters of college basket
ball on the West Coast.
"Dick obviously brings a wealth of
knowledge to our program and I feel
he will be a tremendous addition to
our staff," Dawkins told
GoStanford.com. "In addition to
leading successful teams at Santa
Clara, he is a true teacher of the game
and his experience will be an invalu
able asset to our program."
Tention brings 20 years of collegiate
coaching experience, including stints as
the head coach of Loyola Marymount
(2006-08) and College of Notre Dame
(1995-97). He has also amassed a great
deal of familiarity with the Pac-10, serv
ing as an assistant under Lute Olson at
Arizona from 1998 to 2(X)5
Schrage, meanwhile, worked
under the legendary Bob Knight at
Indiana from 1994 to 1998 before
joining the Duke staff.
"I am excited to have our coaching
staff on board," Dawkins said in the
same press release. "During the
search process, our objective was to
try and find the right fit and chemistry
for our program and I believe we have
done that successfully."
Stanford rowers headed to Beijing
Five current and former Stanford
rowers were named to the U.S. and
Canadian Olympic teams, marking
the most rowers Stanford has ever
sent to the Olympics. Rising junior
Elle Logan and rising sophomore

Lindsay Meyer will both compete
for the U.S. women as members of
the women's eight boat and
women's quadruple sculls boat,
respectively.
On the men's side, three Stanford
alumni will look to earn medals in
Beijing. Jamie Schroeder '05 will com

second Olympics as a member of the
Canadian men's eight.
Women's rowing coach Yasmin
Farooq will also make the trip to
Beijing this August, where she will
serve as NBC's rowing analyst. This
will be the two-time Olympian and
world champion's third stint in the
booth for NBC.
Meanwhile Stanford's freshman
eight boat raced into the second
round of the Henley Royal Regatta
yesterday, at Henley-on-Thames,
England. After defeating South
Africa's University of Stellenbbosch
by four lengths, the Stanford frosh will
now have to face the Fitzwilliam
College team of Cambridge today.
More Olympic qualifiers for
Stanford ready to make their
marks in Beijing
Several more Stanford athletes
recently punched their tickets to
Beijing to compete in the 2008
Summer Olympics beginning this
August.
Erica McLain '08 qualified for the
U.S. Women's Track and Field squad
last week with a mark of 45 feet, 9 3/4
inches in the triple jump at the U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Trials in
Eugene, Ore., good for third place in
the event.
Lan Dobson '05 will also compete
in Beijing, having qualified in the
S,(XX) meters. Dobson qualified with a
time of 13:29.76.
Another trio of Cardinal athletes
— Lauren Fleshman '03, Arianna
Lambie '08 and Teresa McWalters '08
— is still alive in the competition, and

will compete today for Olympic
berths.
Stanford alums and current ath
letes will also be well-represented in
the water polo competitions, as four
Cardinal men — Tony Azevedo '05,
I.ayne Beaubien '99, Peter Hudnut
'03 and Peter Varellas '06 — and
three Cardinal women — rising junior
Jessica Steffens, Brenda Villa '03 and
Alison Gregorka '07 — will compete
for the U.S. in Beijing. Azevedo, a
three-time National Player of the
Year and four-time All-American,
will captain the U.S. men's squad.
Women's lacrosse tabs Amy
Bokker as new head coach
Stanford Athletics Director Bob
Bowlsby announced on June 16 the
hiring of Amy Bokker, former head
coach at George Mason for the past 11
seasons, as the new head coach of the
Stanford women's lacrosse program.
Bokker guided the Patriots to their
first-ever winning record in her first
year on the job at George Mason in
1998, earning an 8-7 record on the
season. She also led the Patriots to a
No. 14 national ranking to close the
1999 season. Despite a cumulative
record of 86-94 as the head coach at
George Mason, Bokker's last season
with the Patriots was a very positive
sign, as she led the program to its win
ningest season ever at 12-5.
Bokker's own athletic career took
place at William & Mary, where she
graduated in 1995 after playing on
four lacrosse teams ranked in the top
10 nationally.
"I am certainly grateful for this
opportunity and would like to thank
Bob Bowlsby and Scott Schuhmann
for being so welcoming to me and my
family throughout the entire process,"
Bokker told GoStanford.com. "1 look
forward to becoming a part of the
Stanford community and family. I
look forward to building a nationally
competitive program, continue to
establish tradition and bring Stanford
lacrosse to the same level of success as
other sports in the department."
