## LIVE MUSIC JAZZ FEST LINEUP TO DELIVER FOR '08 
### ALEX COLEY INTERMISSION JAZZ CAT 
It's summertime, and for Stanford
students, the living ain't always easy.
But forget the workweek woes and
get ready to swing — the Stanford
Jazz Festival is back on campus. The
Festival, by now a mainstay of cam
pus life from June to August, will
continue its 37-year run as one of the
Bay Area's finest cultural traditions
and a source of vitality on campus
during the subdued summer months.
The Festival kicked off in style
last Friday with a stunning perfor
mance by trumpeter Terrence
Blanchard and his quintet before a
riveted Dinkelspiel audience.
Blanchard and company set the bar
mighty high on opening night, but
the stellar lineup is sure to keep pace.
The Festival runs through August 9.
and features a total of 31 shows.
Previewed here are a few of the
standout events on tap this summer.
Mulgrew Miller
Friday, July 11 18 p.m. I Campbell
Recital Mall
Tickets: $40 general I $20 students
A solo piano concert is never one
to miss, especially when the pianist
cites Oscar Peterson as his formative
influence. Mulgrew Miller goes it
alone July 11, and will surely conjure
up some of the late Oscar's magic in
weaving a spellbinding performance.
Over the years, Miller, lauded for his
technical prowess, has established a
superior reputation as a multifaceted
player, not limited to any one style or
tradition. Both versatility and virtu
osity are crucial to the success of a
nuanced solo jazz performance, and
Miller's got them covered.
Kenny llurrcll Quartet
Saturday, July 12 I 8 p.m. I Campbell
Recital Hall
Tickets: $40 general I $20 students
A household name among gui
tarists, Kenny Burrell has been a
towering presence in jazz for the last
six decades, making his debut with
Dizzy Gillespie's sextet back in 1951.
Burrell, at 76, has earned a promi
nent spot in the pantheon of jazz
greats — we can shed the qualifica
tion "guitarist." With a signature
sound firmly grounded in bebop and
the blues, Burrell's playing possesses
an admirable coolness and a tone to
die for. Even if you can't score a tick
et to this in-demand concert (at the
intimate Campbell Recital Hall),
check out Burrell's classic album
"Midnight Blue" and drench your
self in jazz at its bluesiest best.

Taylor Kigsti/Julian (.age duo
Sunday, July 27 I 7:3(1 p.m. I
Dinkclspicl Auditorium
Tickets: $28 general I $14 students
Virtuoso pianist Taylor Eigsti and
six-string phenom Julian Lage pre
sent an intriguing pairing of two for
mer child prodigies, who both began
performing at eight years old. Both
are Northern California natives.
Both graduated from Stanford's Jazz
Workshop. The parallels are extraor
dinary, and thankfully, .familiar hor
ror stories of burnt-out kid-geniuses
don't apply. Eigsti and Lage, at 20-
something each, are practically veter
ans of the business already. Catch the
prolific duo at Dink for what's cer
tain to be a raucous showcase of the
best post-bop has and will continue
to offer for decades to come.
Fly +1 with special guest Joshua
Redman
Saturday, Aug. 9 I 8 p.m. I Campbell
Recital Hall
Tickets: $40 general I $20 students
Dissecting the esoteric name of
the Festival's closing act — Fly+l —
is a simple task. "Fly" is a trio, com
prised of tenor Mark Turner, bassist
Larry Grenadier and drummer Jeff
Ballard. The "plus one" equals
Joshua Redman — the Berkeley
raised saxophone giant even your
parents would recognize. On Aug. 9,
Fly+l will attempt to realize what Fly
has already achieved — musical
expression whose entire strength
derives from the collective synergy of
its members. Jazz, in contrast to clas
sical and even popular music, openly
emphasizes individual genius. But in
aspiring to loftier sonic territory, Fly
shifts the focus to the collective, an
ethos expressed even in the naming
of the trio, which again eschews the
tradition in jazz of highlighting the
individual. Be prepared — this one
should be a real treat.
And after all that, if you're still in
need of a jazz fix, head over to the
swanky new/old CoHo to hear
Stanford Jazz Workshop faculty
members jamming out on weekday
nights. These sessions run late into
the night and draw enthusiastic
crowds.
Check the full concert listings at
www.stanfordjazz.org, and do not
hesitate to purchase tickets well in
advance, especially for events at
Campbell. Stanford grooves this
summer — don't miss out.
