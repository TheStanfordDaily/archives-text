# CAM PUS HAPPENINGS
## New CoHo better than average cup o'joe 
### KAT LEWIN INTERMISSION COFFEE CONNOISSEUR 
The much-mourned loss of the CoHo last year was
the final syringe-ful of embalming fluid in Stanford's
zombified main-campus social and dining options. But
the CoHo is back and under new management. And
seriously, it's better than ever.
Stepping through the doors since the June 24
reopening is like zipping through a time warp: the
CoHo hasn't lost its grungy, slightly unpolished vibe (or
superior taste in music). But under the comfortably
unslick veneer are updated touches remarkably well
suited to students' needs.
The CoHo hasn't replaced its trademark rough
hewn log tables and benches, for example, but seating
has been laid out to comfortably accommodate many
more diners. There's table seating for over 100 students.
The low counter that used to house those not-quite
thawed microwavable pizzas is gone too, replaced with
swanky counter seating. And the raised computer-nerd
seating by the main entrance has been fitted with a
huge, buttery leather couch that puts the Bender Room
to shame for paper-procrastination purposes.
For those who come here to pretend to work, finding
an available electrical outlet used to be a major prob
lem. But worry no more: Strips of outlets line the
longest wall of the establishment so you can take advan
tage of Stanford's lovely free wireless way past your bat
tery capacity.
The rest of the decor isn't so shabby either — or bet
ter to say, it's intentionally and endearingly on the shab
by side. The battered and beautiful photography that
used to adorn the walls has been taken down and things
look a little barren, but management is obviously mak

ing decoration a priority.
There are a few self-consciously quirky touches: the
huge bullfighting mural, a gorilla in a witch's hat. The
most notable art are the caricatures of famous(ish)
Stanford alumni clustered on the walls: the Lopez twins,
Condi and Sally Ride. The effect is a little cheesy look
ing on the fresh-painted walls, but after a few years and
a couple coats of grimy handprints, it's exactly the sort
of tradition you can imagine the class of '15 saying has
been around forever.
The improved coffee shop has also been graced with
two big-screen televisions which, according to the
CoHo's Web site, will be dedicated to popular pro
gramming. (Something about the "Olympics"? 1 think
it's a new Greek opera.) Additionally, the CoHo staff
has planned live music events to entertain diners. Jazz
Jam night, featuring the Stanford Jazz Workshop, is
scheduled for several Mondays throughout the summer.
If the blaring brass doesn't keep you up, the coffee
will. The CoHo, true to its name, features a variety of
coffee and espresso drinks made to order. Are they
good? They're not made with Peet's Coffee. Of course
they're good.
Finally, and probably least importantly, considering
the CoHo's indispensable value as a catch-all hangout
and destination for ambiguous not-a-dates, there's the
food. Crepes aren't on the menu yet, but this aside, the
CoHo has stepped things up from its last incarnation.
Over the summer, the kitchen is open from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. for lunch, and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. for dinner. The
menu features a selection of sandwiches and paninis
that arc assembled from fresh ingredients and pressed
in front of your eyes. There are also some appetizing-

looking fresh salads (pears and goat
cheese looks like the clear winner)
and pre-made breakfast sandwiches,
yogurts, overpriced yuppie teas, etc.
All entrees weigh in around $6 —
economical, especially considering
the quality.
If you're more peckish, there's a
tempting array of pastries from
Satura Cakes in Palo Alto, big cook
ies, croissants, brioches, slices of
cake and a really devilish fresh-fruit
danish. A word to the wise on the
muffins, though: My blueberry was
softball-sized and flavorful, but drier
than the inside of Kelsey Grammer's
mouth during The Cocaine Years.
Still, it was less dry than his trade
mark Frasier-ian wit, so maybe
there's some hope.
All ye coffee-swillers, jazz fans,
p-set procrastinators and people
who are just sick of hanging out in
the Castano lounge, set aside the
heartbreak of your formerly CoHo
lree existence. Truly, the reopened
CoHo is cause to rejoice.
