## Funny and full of twists, 'Hancock' worth the trip

Movie trailers are spectacular.
Short and punchy, they are meant to
give the viewer an idea of the film
and display some of its finest
moments: terrific explosions, hearty
laughs or a beautiful romance. A
well-made trailer can make any
movie, regardless of its premise or
star power, seem like the next big
hit. The trouble with trailers, howev
er, is that sometimes they give away
too much of the movie.
Usually, trailer excess is a prob
lem of humor â€” how many limes
has a comedy's trailer used up all its
good jokes? It's really no fun to see
a movie and find you've already
laughed at the funniest parts. Other
times, however, trailers can give
away too much of other aspects of a
movie: character development, for
instance, or narrative.
Such was my worry with
"Hancock," the most recent in this
summer's long line of superhero
movies. "Hancock" stars Will Smith
as a superhero with a bad attitude,
who works with idealistic PR man
Ray F.mbrey (Jason Bateman) to
revamp his image. I was hesitant

about "Hancock" because this was
all readily apparent from the pre
view. It seemed to me the trailer
showed Hancock's entire metamor
phosis, from messy drunk to clean
shaven hunk (yes, i meant for that to
rhyme).
Fortunately, for me and for
"Hancock," there's more. I won't get
into details about what happens
after the image change, but 1 will say
it involves Hancock's past, and a
mysterious superwoman. It's almost
as if "Hancock" were two movies
rolled into one, the first about a
super-strong bad boy gone good,
and the second about a lonely demi
god searching for his place in the
world. This split in the film's narra

DAMAGED: Will Smith plays a dead-beat superhero looking to change his image in the film 'Hancock.' After a slew
of summer movies about superheroes, it's the only one not based on a comic book or graphic novel.
