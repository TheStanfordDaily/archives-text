## Funny and full of twists, 'Hancock' worth the trip 
### JEFF GILLILAND INTERMISSION SUPER HERO 
Movie trailers are spectacular.
Short and punchy, they are meant to
give the viewer an idea of the film
and display some of its finest
moments: terrific explosions, hearty
laughs or a beautiful romance. A
well-made trailer can make any
movie, regardless of its premise or
star power, seem like the next big
hit. The trouble with trailers, howev
er, is that sometimes they give away
too much of the movie.
Usually, trailer excess is a prob
lem of humor — how many limes
has a comedy's trailer used up all its
good jokes? It's really no fun to see
a movie and find you've already
laughed at the funniest parts. Other
times, however, trailers can give
away too much of other aspects of a
movie: character development, for
instance, or narrative.
Such was my worry with
"Hancock," the most recent in this
summer's long line of superhero
movies. "Hancock" stars Will Smith
as a superhero with a bad attitude,
who works with idealistic PR man
Ray F.mbrey (Jason Bateman) to
revamp his image. I was hesitant

about "Hancock" because this was
all readily apparent from the pre
view. It seemed to me the trailer
showed Hancock's entire metamor
phosis, from messy drunk to clean
shaven hunk (yes, i meant for that to
rhyme).
Fortunately, for me and for
"Hancock," there's more. I won't get
into details about what happens
after the image change, but 1 will say
it involves Hancock's past, and a
mysterious superwoman. It's almost
as if "Hancock" were two movies
rolled into one, the first about a
super-strong bad boy gone good,
and the second about a lonely demi
god searching for his place in the
world. This split in the film's narra

DAMAGED: Will Smith plays a dead-beat superhero looking to change his image in the film 'Hancock.' After a slew
of summer movies about superheroes, it's the only one not based on a comic book or graphic novel.
tive leads to a lot of lost nuance and
undeveloped sub-plot; there is an
eagle motif that runs throughout the
movie but is never explained, and a
fair amount of mythology surround
ing the second half of the storyline
that just doesn't make a whole lot of
sense. Screenwriters Vincent Ngo
and Vince Gilligan have essentially
crafted two rather compelling
scripts, but seemed to haphazardly
put them next to each other rather
than integrate them as well as they
could have.

"'Hancock'
brings an
exciting sense
of originality
and freshness
to the table."

That being said, "Hancock" is in
all other ways a terrific film. Will
Smith plays the sneering, whiskey
guzzling superhero as effortlessly as
he always does, combining hilarious
and foulmouthed off-the-cuff come
backs with a more than convincing
depth of emotion. Say what you will
about Will Smith, but the guy can
act. Jason Bateman is as hilarious as
always, though he can't quite pull off
the innocent idealism that his char
acter requires, and the hand of
director Peter Berg is smooth and
steady.
What surprised me the most
about "Hancock" was how funny it
is. The laughs come fast and loud in
the first 20 minutes, setting the tone
of the movie the way a first act
should. Even when several of the
jokes are recycled later on — let's
just say I've heard more than
enough about sticking one guy's
head up another guy's ass, thank you
very much — the movie has enough
momentum that they don't fall flat.
The transition between the comedic
focus of the film's early parts and the
more dramatic second half is smooth
as well, though that transition is
overshadowed by the glaring lack of
transition in the plot.
Ultimately, "Hancock" is defi
nitely a movie worth seeing. In a
summer schedule filled to overflow
ing with superhero movies,
"Hancock" brings an exciting sense
of originality and freshness to the
table. Unlike "Iron Man" or "The
Incredible Hulk," "Hancock" does
not rely on a comic book mythology
that has to be explained to anyone
who isn't a Marvel nerd, and its edgy
sneer might be just the satirical jolt
the superhero-movie genre needs.
"Hancock" may be two movies
rolled into one, but it's two really
fun movies.
