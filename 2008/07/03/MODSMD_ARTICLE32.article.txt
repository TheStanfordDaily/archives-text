# 'Viva la Vida' brings end to Cold play's cold streak
## 
### PAUL CRAFT INTERMISSION MUSIC MAN 
It's amazing how far Coldplay
has come in the past decade: At
this time in 1998, they were a col
lege-based hand in London. By
2000, with the release of
"Parachutes" and their hit
"Yellow," they got big. "A Rush of
Blood to the Head" then made
Coldplay both a critic and fan
favorite, winning the Grammy for
Best Alternative Album and sell
ing over 12 million copies world
wide.
By 2005's "X&Y," the band
was huge: It had released the
world's second best-selling album
of 2005 and was the first British
rock band to debut in the U.S.
Top 10 since The Beatles.
Nowadays, the band is so huge
that even their shy bassist, Guy
Berryman — worth over $25 mil
lion — is one of England's richest
people under 30.
But discontent has been grow
ing among the Coldplay ranks for
the past few years. The band's
popularity began to outpace their
artistic growth, and after winning
nearly universal praise for their
earlier releases, "X&Y" fell flat
with most critics. A New York
Times reviewer famously labeled
Coldplay "the most insufferable
band of the decade."
Cue the redemption album —

the one designed to demonstrate
that a band can be both hugely
popular and artistically good.
Coldplay's result is "Viva La
Vida," released on June 17 in the
U.S.
And for the most part, it's a
success. Swirling strings, exotic
soundscapes and shifting song
structures abound on the album,
produced by living legend Brian
Eno.
The first track, "Life in
Technicolor," is a shimmering,
ambient instrumental, featuring
the catchiest guitar line of the
album. At the same time, however,
the band's decision to make an
instrumental exemplifies Coldplay's
Hawed new approach of avoiding
their old ways at all costs.
The old Coldplay had devel
oped a pretty strong formula:
instrumental introduction; rela
tively sparse, even-keeled verse;
and huge, catchy, stadium-rocking
chorus. Of course, repeated for
good measure. It worked on
everything from "Yellow" to "In
My Place" to "Clocks" to "Speed
of Sound." But now they deliber
ately avoid this easy route. Chris
Martin and company break up sin
gle tracks into multiple parts on
"Viva La Vida," and at times, this
works. But other times, Coldplay
fails to develop the parts that actu
ally work best.
For example, the third track,
"42," has three unrelated parts that
stand up well individually: a piano
melody, a "Paranoid Android"-like
guitar breakdown and finally a rous
ing refrain. Although each part is
good on its own, they don't neces
sarily work to make each other bet
ter.
"Yes" is another example. The song
starts off with swirling Middle
Eastern strings, pauses and then
launches into a shoe-gaze song. The
individual parts are well done, but
squashing them together doesn't
add much.
The songs that the band does
keep fully intact stand up best.
"Viva La Vida" is a string-drenched
anthem that recently topped the
American music charts. Sung from
the perspective of a king deposed by
revolution, it features Chris Martin's
most interesting lyrics to date.
"Violet Hill," the first single from
the album, sports a distorted riff and
political lyrics. "Lost!" is driven
along by a processed drum beat and
handclaps layered with wide-screen
church organ.
In the end, "Viva La Vida" man
ages to expand Coldplay's musical
repertoire by small measures, but
doesn't fundamentally alter the
band's sound (a win-win situation
for fans): The hooks are still catchy.
The beautiful textures are still there.
Martin's emotions are still on his
sleeve. But now the old formula is
pretty much gone, and Coldplay is
out of its rut — their brand bigger
and better than ever.
