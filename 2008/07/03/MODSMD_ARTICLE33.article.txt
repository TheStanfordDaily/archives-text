## PEARL CAFE: BOBA TEA AND MORE 
### TOMMY TOBIN INTERMISSION BOBATASTER 
From PB&J to pork buns to pasta primavera, Pearl
Cafe's menu oilers its clientele a veritable cornucopia of
options. The menu runs the gamut from traditional fare,
such as sesame balls (best served warm); to coffeehouse
staples, such as cheesecake; to the purely miscellaneous,
such as pizza bagels.
What truly makes the place stand out, though, is its
ability to offer so many choices, while retaining its
charm as a wonderful spot for cozy conversation or even
(gasp!) serious studying.
While Pearl Cafe's exterior is nothing to brag about,
the eatery's interior boasts inviting, cozy decor. The
hangout spot attempts to cater simultaneously to fami
lies and larger parties by offering comfortable seating,
a big screen TV and assorted board games — while
working types flock to the free WiFi, soothing ambient
music and relaxing atmosphere.
A literal illustration of its charm, Pearl Cafe show
cases art by local children, while intricate track lighting
and ceiling designs soothe the eye. One note of caution:
Avoid the large windows when the sun is setting, as the
sunlight streams harshly into the quaint cafe. For those
looking to study, 1 recommend the end tables — they
offer more space and are closer to the all-important
electrical outlets.
Though its menu is incredibly extensive, Pearl Cafe's
food is a mixed bag. Some of the offerings are delicious,
while others aren't terribly tasty. Put simply, this isn't
place to go for a full meal, even though there are enough
options for one. Rather, if you're looking for a delicious
snack, this is a wonderful option.
Highly recommended are the waffles, the warm
sesame balls and the masubi, whether it be chicken
katsu (fried chicken cutlet with rice wrapped in sea
weed) or masubi combo (chicken katsu and spam). Stay
away from the more hearty options on the menu, name

ly the pastas; though decent, the meal options pale in
comparison with the lighter fare.
Pearl Cafe's menu is varied, but the main draw for
many is its Boha. Also known as pearl milk tea, Boba
consists of tapioca balls and a milk-based tea mixed
with a variety of flavors, typically fruit, and served hot,
cold or iced. Pearl Cafe serves some of the best Boba in
the area, with rich fruit flavors and very quick service.
For those trying Boba for the first time, sample the
peach or strawberry milk teas — the fruity flavors could
get you hooked! For bubble tea..veterans, try the
almond or jasmine milk teas. These more basic flavors
could suit your fancy. For those seeking a wonderful sip
while attempting to study, I highly recommend the hot
taro milk tea.
Pearl Cafe also offers a great deal of non-Boba bev
erages, effectively doubling as a Boba place and coffee
house. It offers the usual coffee options, such as espres
so and cappuccino, as well as lemonade and hot cocoa,
all of which serve as a great study aid.
Stanford students, including Andy Hiller '11, gave
Pearl Cafe two thumbs up, raving about the delicious
Boba, the relaxing atmosphere and the calming music.
High School Summer College students Strand Sylvester,
Taylor Winfield and Peter Lee agreed that the place was
refreshing and, upon sipping their iced drinks, knew that
they could study here. Hiller remarked that the cafe was
also a great place for discussion among friends.
Pearl Cafe is a real gem, allowing for both comfort
able discussion and serious work within a clean, cozy
environment — complete with warm drinks and deli
cious snacks.
Pearl Cafe is a short drive from campus, located near
Target in the San Antonio Shopping Center at 506 A
Showers Drive. While the place is open all day, take
note of the abbreviated late-night hours — even on
weekends, Pearl Cafe closes at 9 p.m. sharp!
