## CoHo returns with "soft opening" New owner, programmers plan to rebuild atmosphere 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Fliers announced it, students knew it and
the crowds gathering once again on the first
floor of Tresidder Union showed it: After
less than a year's absence, "The CoHo is
back."

Rather than the grand affair many might
have expected, though — especially for a
Stanford hotspot that closed to a wave of
student protest — it's almost as if it never
closed, coffee lovers gather around wood
tables, jazz bands play on the CoHo stage
and laptops line the countertops. The only
thing missing is the crepes — and those are
expected on the menu within a couple
weeks.

It's a "soft opening," as owner Ray Klein,
who took over the CoHo tradition from
Stanford Dining, described, "where we do

our thing and get better at it. At this rate,
we'll be very well prepared for the school
year."
While most students who remember the
old CoHo are away from campus, the new
one has already attracted a healthy summer
audience, including Stanford faculty, staff,
community members and high-school stu
dents from the various programs on campus.
Around 100 people came within the first few
hours of the June 24 opening, according to
Klein, and many more in the days
since.
"The reception has been excep
tional," Klein said, "but we're doing
some exceptional things."
In particular, Klein cites the
improved menu of sandwiches, sal
ads, soups and, of course, coffee.
Klein is proud of the healthier
options available, as well as the bak
ery selection of pastries and more.
With four bakes each day, he said,
"you can always expect a fresh crois
sant."
And thus far, despite the some
what limited options of the menu —
Klein plans to greatly expand it over
the coming weeks and months —
customers are satisfied.
"I'm excited for the paninis," said
Erin Sadler, a High School Summer
College student. "We're coming for

lunch."
Competing with The Axe and
Palm, which is open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
this summer, for the lunchtime
crowd, the CoHo is already holding
its own.
"They take the time to actually
make the food, as opposed to The
Axe and Palm," said Jamie Morgan
TO. "The food is good and the
drinks are among the better ones
I've had on campus."
Klein expects to add more drink
ing options in the coming weeks, as
the CoHo is currently applying for
an alcohol license. Once approved,
Klein plans to offer beer and a
chance to "listen to some music and
have a glass of wine."
"It's not going to be a beer gar
den, though," he added.
It's all just part of the atmos
phere, Klein emphasized. Among
the reasons for students' dismay at
the previous CoHo's closing was the
loss of a casual, coffeehouse atmos
phere, and Klein has worked to
bring that back as well as improve it,

with authentic bar tops, comfortable
chairs and walls of original artwork,
mostly a developing collection of
caricatures of famous Stanford
faces.
"My goal is to make it comfort
able and a part of the University
community — that students don't
just see it as another restaurant,"
Klein said.
Much of making the CoHo the
place to be again will involve pro
gramming, in particular the music
that made the previous CoHo an
artsy hotspot. As of now, the eatery
features a Monday night Jazz Jam
with the Stanford Jazz Workshop,
which attracts a healthy crowd of
around 70 people. Movies and
sports are also featured on big
screen televisions many days, but
there is much more to come, accord
ing to SSE officer and CoHo
Programming Coordinator Kyle
Wulff '08.
"We want this to be a place
where people will know there's
always something interesting hap

pening, where you can be sure you'll
have a good time," Wulff said.
While the summer is a testing
ground for many events, Wulff
hopes to sec at least three official
programs each week during the aca
demic year. Among these could be a
weekly concert series hosted by
Stanford Concert Network, trivia
nights, spoken word and even a
monthly wine tasting class, if the
alcohol license is approved.
Many of these programs and the
revitalization of the CoHo atmos
phere will involve student input and
feedback. Besides talking with visi
tors and soliciting the input of the
ASSU and various student groups,
Wulff cited the feedback form avail
able on the CoHo Web site
(coho.stanford.edu) as a great way
of reconnecting with the old CoHo
crowd as well as new visitors.
As SSE CEO Matt McLaughlin
'08 noted, "The opening is a much
longer battle [than the first day],"
and the new CoHo will develop with
time and the feedback received.

"It's all part of a change in eating
habits, bringing people back to the
CoHo, changing people's social lives
so they come back to the CoHo
again," McLaughlin said. "There are
a lot of things that need to change to
make it successful, to make it a stu
dent hub again."
For now, the CoHo serves as a
hub for summer nightlife, open from
7 a.m. to 11 p.m., or whenever pro
gramming ends. After the outcry
this past academic year over the pre
vious CoHo's closing, it's likely
enough for all those who missed it.
"I can't predict what the future
will bring," said Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Greg Boardman,
"but I'm sure that in the fall students
will be delighted to find that the
CoHo is once again ready to wel
come students back."
