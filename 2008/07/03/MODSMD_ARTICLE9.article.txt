## Univ. offers protection after theft 
### DEVIN BANERJEE NEWS EDITOR 
Stanford has hired Kroll, a New York
based risk consulting company, to provide
identity theft protection free of charge for
thousands of current and former employees
affected by the theft of a University laptop,
according to a letter to employees from
Randy Livingston, Stanford's CFO and vice
president of business affairs.

For one year, Kroll will provide Stanford
employees with access to its ID Theft Smart
Enhanced Identity Theft Restoration,
Continuous Credit Monitoring and
Trimerged Credit Reports. Livingston called
the company's ID Theft Smart program "one
of the most comprehensive programs avail
able to help protect against identity theft."
"All at no cost to you," the CFO added.
University administrators were not imme
diately available to comment on the cost of

engaging Kroll,

whose parent compa
ny Marsh &

McLennan CRISTINA BAUTISTA/
Companies earns The Stan ' orc ' Dai 'v
over $11 billion in annual revenue.
The letter — passed on to The Weekly by
a current employee — also admits a "clear
violation" of Stanford's information security

policy and procedures.
"Stanford has well-established poli
cies and guidelines in place that should
have prevented this type of incident
from occurring," Livingston wrote.
Under Stanford policy, restricted
data such as that in the stolen laptop's
data file may not be stored on a laptop
or any other unprotected system or
device. In the light of the University's
policy violation, Livingston will lead a
task force to review policies and proce
dures regarding sensitive data, accord
ing to Stanford's privacy Web page.
Although Director of Media
Relations Jonathan Rabinovitz declined
to comment on any details of the ongo
ing police investigation, Livingston told
employees there has been no evidence
that the information on the laptop has
been "improperly accessed."
Rabinovitz also declined to comment
on the format of the data file, including
whether or not it was encrypted.
The personal information — includ
ing name, birth date, social security
number, salary, employee identification
information and contact information —
of nearly 62,000 employees was con
tained in the laptop. Driver's license

numbers, credit card numbers, bank
account numbers and other financial
information were not on the machine's
hard drive.

Rabinovitz declined to comment on
how far back before September 2007
the personal information spanned, as
well as on the time and place of the
theft, the employee originally in posses
sion of the laptop and the status of the
ongoing police investigation.
"We are not disclosing details of the
incident as it could compromise the
investigation under way," the media
relations director said in an email to
The Daily.
Some employees expressed disap
pointment at what they said was the
administration's lack of updated infor
mation.
"I am hoping more information will
be made available very soon," said
Romeo Durscher, financial manage
ment analyst for the HEPL Solar
Physics laboratory.
"I haven't heard a whisper since [the
original email], even to say, 'We still
haven't recovered it,"' said Kevin
Leung '11, a section leader for the
Computer Science department whose
information was not contained on the
laptop because he was hired post-
September 2007. "A follow-up would
have reassured me that they are actual
ly doing something about this."
Computer Science section leader RJ

Walsh '11, whose information was not
on the laptop, called the incident a
"flat-out failure."
"With modern computer security
technologies and known vulnerabilities,
this was a flat-out failure on the
University's part," Walsh said. "All sen
sitive data should be stored on remote
servers in a protected location."
"Data should never be copied to pri
vate computers for any reason, because
not only is it impractical, it's unsafe," he
added.
Walsh was optimistic, however, that
the University will revise its policies.
"It's good to know that the
University wants to be transparent, and
there will definitely be changes to the
in-place policies," he said.
Durscher remained disappointed
that protection will only be in place for
one year.
"Protection should be set up and
stay in place for not just on. or two
years, but rather 10 years at least," the
employee said. "It won't be cheap, but
that's what happens when something
like this happens."
