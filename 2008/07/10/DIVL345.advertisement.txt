Earthquakes can be extreme catastrophes. Rapid urbanization of earthquake
prone regions means that a future earthquake with a million fatalities is a
distinct possibility. The consequences of earthquakes might be mitigated if they
could be predicted; however, to date, earthquake prediction has proven elusive.
Join us as Gregory Beroza, Professor of Geophysics, covers what it is that
makes earthquake prediction an intrinsically difficult problem. He will also cover
aspects of the earthquake process that we can predict, and what the prospects
are for future progress.
