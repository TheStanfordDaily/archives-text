# IT Services readies Zimbra to replace Webmail
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
University IT Services has begun replacing
Webmail and Sundial Oracle Calendar with a new
email and calendar service powered by a technology
product called Zimbra. The process, which will last
nine months, will be staged to incorporate students,
faculty, staff and other University web users in phas
es, according to The Stanford Report.
IT Services chose Zimbra because it allows access
to email, calendar and contact lists from a single, uni

fied Web interface. Once implemented, the new sys
tem will be available to anyone with a full-service
SUNet ID, and users will be able to continue using
current desktop email programs. According to The
Report, Zimbra works equally well across Windows,
Macintosh and Linux operating systems.
The implementation will be staggered so that IT
Services can test tools, provide documentation and
prepare training materials. IT Services has already
moved to the new email system and will convert its
calendar system on July 21, according to The Report.
Students will be moved over in August, Sundial users
in October and remaining faculty and staff between
November and next March.
