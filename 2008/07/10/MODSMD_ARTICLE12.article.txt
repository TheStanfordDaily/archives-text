# Oldest oak tree on campus bites the sawdust

### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The University's oldest oak tree — a 220-year
old California coast live oak that stood at the edge
of the Oval near the Graduate
School of Business — was cut
down after it split and broke late
last month.
The oak — Stanford's last cer
tified "historic tree" — had been
suffering from interior decay and
was badly affected by strong winds
last month. It later split and was
cut down and chipped by
University groundskeepers.
According to The San Jose
Mercury News, the oak was esti
mated to have germinated some
time around the signing of the
U.S. Constitution and was much
later nicknamed "The Pioneer
Tree" by Stanford's first class in
1895.
Sections of the oak's branches
were saved and given to admirers;
the remainder was chipped.
