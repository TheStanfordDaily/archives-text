## Stu's Views The 						Dark Knight Will be the Greatest Film of All Time 
### 
It is now July and we arc fully bogged down
in the doldrums of summer. The only sport
on TV is baseball, and we aren't even
approaching the wild-card race. Both the
Obama and McCain campaigns are doing
nothing, unless you count McCain's 103 rd staff
shakeup and Obama's inevitable repositioning
on Iraq. Neither is really interesting or surpris
ing. The days of humidity, at least here in
Washington, D.C., stretch on forever. It's too
hot to go outside, and everyone is too busy
interning and being important in pantsuits
and/or "business casual."
But on July 18, we have the film event of
our young century to lighten our load and cool
our brows. "The Dark Knight." Batman. Yes.
This is the most important film of the year,
at the very least. At last, we can finally reclaim
the superhero genre from the campy "Hulk"
iterations, the tongue-in-cheek "Spiderman,"
and the endless, cheap moralization of "X-
Men." Ironman? Hancock? Puh-leese. "The
Dark Knight" will storm over them with the
force of the Batmobile. At long last, we have
the first superhero movie that we can take seri
ously, unless you count "Batman Begins"
(which 1 do). It will also be the first superhero
movie to break free of the genre and just
become...a movie.
1 am 100 percent confident this film will live
up to my outrageously high expectations. The
reviews so far have been heaping on the praise
like I syrup my waffles. Variety says, "An
ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying
scope and moral complexity, this is seriously
brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every
expectation raised by its hit predecessor and
then some." Rolling Stone says it is an
"absolute stunner." Another reviewer wrote,
"The Dark Knight is not only the best film I
have seen this year, but quite possibly the best
superhero movie ever made." It had better be!
The importance of this film extends far
beyond it merely being enthralling cinema.
"The Dark Knight" has deep political reso
nance for our time. As I argued six months
ago. Batman is the perfect symbc 1 for
America's position in the world today. He is
Gotham's "reluctant policeman," both hated
and loved for what he does. America is much
the same — doing the world's dirty work

(fighting dictators, preventing proliferation)
that no one else has the ability or the will to do.
Only Batman — representing a sort of
Machiavellian order — can challenge the
chaos represented by the Joker. Batman is a
hero —or antihero — for our time, and by
studying and appreciating "The Dark Knight,"
we will come to understand ourselves.
Alone among the big superheroes, Bruce
Wayne does not have superpowers. His inher
ent humanity reminds Americans that we too
arc not infallible. We too can commit errors in
moral judgment (the Iraq War, Guantanamo
Bay), and must at the end of the day atone for
them. How far he goes to fight crime and
restore the liberal order is instructive in how
far we should go to defend democracy and lib
eralism against threats to peace and stability.
If the film's political importance is not
enough to compel you, we also have the last
completed role of Heath Ledger before his
suicide. You get to see what Christopher
Nolan, director of "Memento," can do with an
enormous $200 million budget. Christian Bale
is a solid Batman, far better than nipple-suited
George Clooney, and Michael Caine is his
usual badass self. For the cooler kids, Maggie
Gyllenhaal has considerable hipster cred.
Nolan's movie is sure to be the treatment that
Batman deserves.
1 know 1 will be there at midnight, most
likely dressed as Darth Vader or Harry Potter
to confuse people. 1 want this film to have the
biggest opening ever, which it will obviously
get as a result of millions of people reading this
column. I'm excited.

Stuart Baimel hopes you're with him.
Otherwise, you're against him. He realizes
that only the Sith speak in absolutes, hut this is
Batman, not "Star Wars," so he can say that.
