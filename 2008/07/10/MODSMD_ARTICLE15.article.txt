## America, the Strange Dan Hirsch 
### 
When I agreed to come to Jackson,
Miss, for a summer internship at the
Institute lor Southern Jewish Life, I
did not know that my first night in Jackson
would entail going to its only synagogue, after
driving for 11 hours on little sleep and less cof
fee, to watch a performance of a group called
the Tzosim Israeli Scouts (read: Zionist
Mickey Mouse Club). I did not expect that dur

able in a synagogue, then, but the truth is: I'm
not a very good Jew either. 1 have not been to
services in years. I neither keep kosher nor the
Sabbath. I found out about the position at the
Institute more or less randomly and applied for
it more or less impulsively. As an American
studies major, I thought it would be a good
opportunity to sec new parts of the country
and learn about a particular facet of its history.
And only two weeks in, I've got a whole heap
of bagels and grits, cotton and chutzpah.
The majority of my day as a history intern at
the Institute for Southern Jewish Life is spent
researching Jewish communities in the South
and writing short histories about them. I have
