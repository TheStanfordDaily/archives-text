## America, the Strange Dan Hirsch 
### 
When I agreed to come to Jackson,
Miss, for a summer internship at the
Institute lor Southern Jewish Life, I
did not know that my first night in Jackson
would entail going to its only synagogue, after
driving for 11 hours on little sleep and less cof
fee, to watch a performance of a group called
the Tzosim Israeli Scouts (read: Zionist
Mickey Mouse Club). I did not expect that dur
ing my first night in my new home, I would be
seated next to second- and third-generation
Jacksonian Jews grooving out to Hebrew pop
songs and "Summer Lovin" — one of many
songs from a "Grease" medley — in the thick
humidity of a June Mississippi evening.
Earlier that day, I was eating a Slim Jim at a
gas station in rural Alabama having recently
passed a roadside attraction of a gigantic peach
and the Billy Graham Parkway before that.
Upon seeing the Israeli Scouts wave Hebrew
Hags and jazz hands in the heart of the Bible
Belt, I knew then that this would be a summer
of jarring incongruities, dissonant moments
and clashing cultures — a summer in which I
could see America right up close, in all her
abundant strangeness.
I am blue-state born and raised. I hail from

one of Massachusetts' most socially liberal and
politically progressive regions and have only
lived outside of that organic food-eating, les
bian-marrying bubble upon coming to
Northern California. So for me, the South is
basically a different country.
You may think 1 might be more comfort
able in a synagogue, then, but the truth is: I'm
not a very good Jew either. 1 have not been to
services in years. I neither keep kosher nor the
Sabbath. I found out about the position at the
Institute more or less randomly and applied for
it more or less impulsively. As an American
studies major, I thought it would be a good
opportunity to sec new parts of the country
and learn about a particular facet of its history.
And only two weeks in, I've got a whole heap
of bagels and grits, cotton and chutzpah.
The majority of my day as a history intern at
the Institute for Southern Jewish Life is spent
researching Jewish communities in the South
and writing short histories about them. I have

earned a few singular factoids in
only a few short weeks. The seer
sucker suit, infamously worn by
true Southern gentlemen, was
popularized by a Jewish merchant
in New Orleans. I have learned
that besides being merchants and
peddlers in urban centers, Jewish
immigrants formed agricultural,
quasi-socialist communes in the
hinterlands of Alabama,
Louisiana and Arkansas.
At a conference in Memphis, a
wild-haired, amateur historian
pulled me aside to inform me that
before he got big, Elvis (the
Elvis!) lived in the upstairs apart
ment of a Jewish couple and was
their shabbas goyim, meaning he
performed tasks for them during
the Sabbath that they could not do
themselves due to religious law.
Can you imagine the King himself
turning off lights for Mr. and Mrs.
Abramowitz!
I've been trying to experience
the South as best 1 can as well. So
far, I've been to two Civil War
battlefields and one civil rights

museum, seen various blues per
formances and eaten my fair share
of fried things. Moments have
been quintessential; on one
notable night, I walked through a
ghost town abandoned in the
19305, complete with overgrown
Spanish moss and turned-over
grave stones. Experiences have
also been shockingly alien. When
a fellow intern (and bi
coastal/Northern Jew) and I
decided to go to a performance of
Gospel music advertised in the
paper, little did we know that we'd
find ourselves ensconced in an all
African-American Baptist Church
service.
In some ways, being here feels
so familiar and so unfamiliar. Last
week for lunch, I went to a place
called Mama Hamil's Feed Barn,
an all you can eat buffet for $8.50.
Kitsch and Americana lined the
walls; a framed portrait of Elvis
hung above an American flag,
which hung above a vintage Coke
machine. Fried chicken and barbe
cue pork were on the lineup, and
they tasted good, like some imag
ined version of Mama's kitchen
table, salty and juicy and down
homey. But it was a shock to my
system, having eaten tofu and
couscous for all of that previous
week.

So in this post-Fourth of July
column, the fireworks have died
down and the barbecue indiges
tion has subsided. Without the flag
waving or the empty ritual, 1
would like to take one moment to
appreciate the strangeness of this
country, a place where immigrants
can travel for thousands of miles
to find home in a place completely
unfamiliar and foreign. Along
with Mama Hamil's, I went to
Jackson's only Indian restaurant,
run by what might be its only
Indian family, and as I dug into a
surprisingly good plate of Saag
Paneer, I thought: How did they
get here? But for most Americans,
that question is entirely pertinent
— How did any of us get here?
I think about the Jewish com
mune that settled in the southern
edges of the Appalachian
Mountains. I think about the Elvis
freaks, the Jesus freaks and the
Tzosim Israeli Scouts all melting
together in one outlandish pot.
Did not the great American poet
Walt Whitman once say: "I taste
America, and it tastes funny?"

so familiar and so unfamiliar. Last
week for lunch, I went to a place
called Mama Hamil's Feed Barn,
an all you can eat buffet for $8.50.
Kitsch and Americana lined the
walls; a framed portrait of Elvis
hung above an American flag,
which hung above a vintage Coke
machine. Fried chicken and barbe
cue pork were on the lineup, and
they tasted good, like some imag
ined version of Mama's kitchen
table, salty and juicy and down
homey. But it was a shock to my
system, having eaten tofu and
couscous for all of that previous
week.

So in this post-Fourth of July
column, the fireworks have died
down and the barbecue indiges
tion has subsided. Without the flag
waving or the empty ritual, 1
would like to take one moment to
appreciate the strangeness of this
country, a place where immigrants
can travel for thousands of miles
to find home in a place completely
unfamiliar and foreign. Along
with Mama Hamil's, I went to
Jackson's only Indian restaurant,
run by what might be its only
Indian family, and as I dug into a
surprisingly good plate of Saag
Paneer, I thought: How did they
get here? But for most Americans,
that question is entirely pertinent
— How did any of us get here?
I think about the Jewish com
mune that settled in the southern
edges of the Appalachian
Mountains. I think about the Elvis
freaks, the Jesus freaks and the
Tzosim Israeli Scouts all melting
together in one outlandish pot.
Did not the great American poet
Walt Whitman once say: "I taste
America, and it tastes funny?"

Believe it or not, they have Internet
in the South. You can contact Dan
Hirsch, who is an American studies
major, at djhirsch@stanford.edu.
