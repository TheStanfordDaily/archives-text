## Car-Free Roads and Reterritorialization 
### 
map with the new names of "The
City Formerly Known as
Cambridge." It makes you think
about how names are chosen, how
they affect us, and how cool it is to
give people more say in how we
name and use spaces.
• The Institute also reterritorializcs
corporate advertisements by per
forming the literal meaning of their
messages, such as "Arrive in Style,"
"Taste the Rainbow," and "Just Do
It."
• The Surveillance Camera Players
reterritorialize (and protest) security
cameras by performing silent plays in
front of them.
• In Water in the Lake: Real Events
for the Imagination, Kenneth Maue
describes human "performances" by
which one can reterritorialize spaces,
social situations and even one's idea

of personhood. I recommend the
book — it's very interesting.
• In Pronoia Is the Antidote for
Paranoia: How the Whole World is
Conspiring to Shower You with
Blessings, Rob Brezsny reterritorial
izes our view of the universe by sug
gesting that the universe is not harsh
but instead "conspires" to give us
everything we need ... including this
creative, transgressively positive book.
I think that deterritorializing the
ad and reterritorializing with good
ness can work well, perhaps better
than trying to "fix" things by working
against them. It's not enough to work
against problems; we need to fill the
space with something free and good,
the way summer displaces winter.
Here's to more transgressive free
dom and many happy reterritorial
izations.
