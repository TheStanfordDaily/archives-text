## Car-Free Roads and Reterritorialization 
### 
map with the new names of "The
City Formerly Known as
Cambridge." It makes you think
about how names are chosen, how
they affect us, and how cool it is to
give people more say in how we
name and use spaces.
• The Institute also reterritorializcs
corporate advertisements by per
forming the literal meaning of their
messages, such as "Arrive in Style,"
"Taste the Rainbow," and "Just Do
It."
• The Surveillance Camera Players
reterritorialize (and protest) security
cameras by performing silent plays in
front of them.
• In Water in the Lake: Real Events
for the Imagination, Kenneth Maue
describes human "performances" by
which one can reterritorialize spaces,
social situations and even one's idea

of personhood. I recommend the
book — it's very interesting.
• In Pronoia Is the Antidote for
Paranoia: How the Whole World is
Conspiring to Shower You with
Blessings, Rob Brezsny reterritorial
izes our view of the universe by sug
gesting that the universe is not harsh
but instead "conspires" to give us
everything we need ... including this
creative, transgressively positive book.
I think that deterritorializing the
ad and reterritorializing with good
ness can work well, perhaps better
than trying to "fix" things by working
against them. It's not enough to work
against problems; we need to fill the
space with something free and good,
the way summer displaces winter.
Here's to more transgressive free
dom and many happy reterritorial
izations.

I'll be writing this summer from the
Stanford of the Hast Coast, Harvard
University and Cambridge, Mass. I had
planned to return to Stanford this summer to
take the last four credits 1 need to graduate,
but when I realized I could take the class from
a distance, I decided to stay here, since my
friends advised me that Boston is wonderful in
the summer.
Something I've noticed here this summer is
how frequently the roads get closed. Multiple
major roads have been closed for everything
from marathons to fireworks to city festivals
to (and I'm not kidding) letting people enjoy
the roads for recreation. On Sundays in sum
mer, the state closes a long stretch of road next

to the Charles River so that people can enjoy
the space without cars.
I happen to live right next to this
"Rivcrbend Park," and it always amazes me to
see people rollerblading, biking and playing
on the same stretch of ground that's usually a
death zone. I make a point to walk in the road,
when 1 could just as well stay on the sidewalk,
because there's something thrilling about
walking in a normally prohibited space.
It's so liberating to have carefree, open
experiences in the very situations that were
formerly harsh or restrictive. French philoso
pher Giles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Felix
Guattari have terms for the process: deterrito
rialization and reterritorialization, which

broadly refer to freeing up a hierarchical,
"striated" space so that it becomes more "rhi
zomatic" and (lowing with multiple possibili
ties.
1 don't know whether Deleuze and
Guattari would approve of these examples,
but here are some things 1 consider (de/re)ter
ritorializations:
• At the Federal Reserve Bank Museum in
downtown Lima, you can walk in and out of
the high-security vault with impunity, because
the bank has been converted into a free muse
um.
• Car-free cities. I saw a piece on Cambridge
Community Television in which someone had
pasted together footage from the many street

closures described above, giving the tantaliz
ing impression that Cambridge was a car-free
city. There have been proposals to make the
North Point neighborhood car-free, and other
cities including New York, Portland and El
Paso are experimenting with temporary car
free corridors. To me, letting people use the
roads for recreation is the quintessential
(de/re)territorialization.
• The Institute for Infinitely Small Things
solicited "renames" for the streets of
Cambridge and published a "reterritorializcd"
