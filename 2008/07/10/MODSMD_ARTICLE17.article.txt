Q
prah wasn't the only star at graduation this year.
At the 2008 Commencement, Nisa Ari '08 and
Jonathan Jourdane '08 both received the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for Distinctive Contributions to
Undergraduate Education. Each year, a selection commit
tee nominates two graduating seniors who "have made dis
tinctive contributions to undergraduate education or the
quality of student life." Essentially, the two seniors both
have made an incredible impact on Stanford during their
four years here.
In a speech given at an honorary dinner for the pair,
Ari. an Art and Art History major, was honored "for her
commitment to the cultural life of Stanford students,
working to make the arts accessible and exciting."
To everyone who knew her, Ari's enthusiasm as a
leader of the student guides at the Cantor Center for
Visual Arts was contagious. She demonstrated her vision
of Stanford in her exhibition "Make Yourself at Home:
Stanford Dorm Rooms 2006," which gave a new perspec
tive to the concept of the period room. It attracted stu

dents and faculty alike and was the only instance in which
a project created by a sophomore was offered gallery
space at Cantor.
The committee thanked Ari for her "exuberant leader
ship and countless contributions to the Cantor Center, the
Department of Art and Art History, the Stanford
Shakespeare Society, the Department of Music and a host
of theatrical events — in short, for being a one-woman
Arts Initiative."
"I was so surprised because you have no idea you've
been nominated for the award," Ari said. "They don't
even tell you."
Jourdane received the award because of his "generosi
ty of spirit, strong social conscience and exceptional abili
ty to connect with people who have fostered community
and improved the quality of life at Stanford," according to
the committee.
The committee also recognized "his joy and contagious
optimism with which he approaches everything he does."
This long list of activities includes working tirelessly regis
tering students to vote, recruiting students for Stanford
Dance Marathon and Relay for Life, and his involvement
in New Student Orientation and Residential Education.
He was honored for "his distinguished academic career
focused on issues of equality and for the many and pro
found gifts he has given the Stanford community, including
his personal credo, adopted by orientation volunteers last
year — i don't have to, I get to."'
So what docs life after Stanford hold for these two?
Currently at home in Colorado, Ari is keeping busy
with singing gigs and will be performing in a musical in
August. In September, she will be moving to New York
with the "no-plan" plan, she said with a laugh.
"New York is perfect because 1 don't have to be tied
down to anything," Ari said. "But I'm really interested in
working for a small theater company in New York, just
like the companies I was in at Stanford."
Eager to effuse her gratitude towards others, Ari
added, "I've been really privileged to have had incredible
professors and opportunities not offered in other areas.
They were so understanding about my interest in all areas
of art and didn't try to tie me down to just one discipline.
They didn't try to push me one way."
Ever humble, Ari found it "weird" when a committee
member read off her many accolades in her citation during
the honorary dinner, the night before Commencement.
"It sounded like they were talking about my voice
teacher!" Ari laughed. "When I called her about the
award, I told her, i thought they were describing you!' I've
become my voice teacher!"
She was also quick to praise Jourdane.
"He's incredible, one of the most inspiring students at
Stanford," she said. "He can talk to anyone — students,
professors — and he's very much himself. He always tries
his best to communicate and understand everyone he
encounters."
Modesty and generosity seem to be recurring traits
amongst Dinkelspiel Award winners, as Jourdane said he
felt undeserving.
"But |Ari's| quite an all-star when it comes to the arts
and when it comes to being a person," he said. "She's just
one of the sweetest human beings I've ever met."
While Jourdane may think he is undeserving, the selec
tion committee for the J.E.W. Sterling Award will have to
disagree. The Board recognized Jourdane for his "strong
potential for continued service to the University and the
alumni community."
"I do not recall a single student in the history of the
University that received both these awards," said Dean of

Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims of
Jourdane's accomplishment.
With accolades in tow, Jourdane is currently stationed
in New Mexico, working with the Obama campaign. And
after November, Jourdane is considering union organizing
and possibly writing a book, but said that "these are just
ideas. Right now, I'm just working my ass off to make sure
Obama is elected."
Though he hasn't solidified any long-term concrete
plans, Jourdane has graduated from the Farm with strong
ideals.
"Being at Stanford was an honor," Jourdane said.
"With that comes a responsibility. Now 1 get to go into the
real world with the opportunity to show the gifts I've
gained from being at Stanford."
Armed with his personal motto, "1 don't have to, I get
to," Jourdane explains, "It is such a huge privilege to be a
Stanford student that 1 could never complain about any
thing. Everything 1 do, 1 get to do it. Without Stanford, I
wouldn't have been able to come to realize this message."
While Jourdane's and Ari's interests and paths don't
quite intersect, the similarity of their passion and zeal in
everything they do is impossible to miss. It's students like
them who continue to make Stanford an incredible uni
versity because of their endless contributions.

HE DIDN'T HAVE TO: Jonathan Jourdane '08 got to
do many things in his time at Stanford - from Dance
Marathon to New Student Orientation to campaigning for

that oftentimes in life you don't have to, you get to.
