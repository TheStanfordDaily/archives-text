## STANFORD SWIMMING Card shines at Olympic qualifiers 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SPORTS EDITOR 
With all the attention that the Olympic trials for
the U.S. swimming team has garnered in recent days,
the Cardinal swimming program has, perhaps, seen
its own profile rise yet again, as Stanford athletes and
alums have made their mark in the pool.
On the women's side, the Cardinal was led by
tremendous performances from rising juniors Julia
Smit and Elaine Breeden, who both qualified for the
Olympics this August in Beijing. It made Stanford
the only program in the nation with two current
undergraduates representing the U.S. on the
women's swim team. This is in keeping with a strong
recent tradition of sending current student-athletes
to the Olympics, as the women's team has seen six
Cardinal student-athletes earn medals since 1988, as
compared to just three for current undergrads in all
other programs combined.
For their Stanford coach. Lea Maurer — herself
an Olympic medalist in two events at the Barcelona
Games in 1992 — the duo is merely living up to the
potential she and the Cardinal program saw when
they were recruited three years ago. And Maurer
knows the pressure they face, as she too faced the
challenges of an Olympic field when she was a rising
junior on the Farm.
"We recruited Elaine and Julia with the belief
that they had the potential of making this team and
they were clear about their goals and their willing
ness to work hard to reach them," Maurer told
GoStanford.com. "All of the hard work and experi
ence they have gained over the past two years at
Stanford helped them reach their goals. We are so
proud of what they have accomplished and how pos
itively it reflects on Stanford swimming.
"Stanford's tradition of swimming excellence is
something that we talk about with the team all of the

time," she continued. "Each of these ladies takes the
responsibility of carrying on that tradition very seri
ously."
Breeden, a native of Lexington, Kent., qualified
in the 1(X)- and 200-meter butterfly events, finishing
first overall in the 200-meter race with a time of
2:06.75 and second in the 100-meter race with a time

of 58.21, missing first by just a tenth of a second.
Smit, meanwhile, was chosen for the 4x200-meter
freestyle relay team, thanks to a third-place time of
1:56.73 in the 200-meter qualifier.
Aside from Breeden and Smit, 14 other women
who either currently are or formerly were members
of the Cardinal swim team competed in Omaha,
Neb. Among the other performances of note for
Stanford were 2008 graduate Brooke Bishop's
fourth-place finish in the 100-meter fly and sixth
place finish in the 50-meter freestyle, 2004 graduate
Tara Kirk's third-place finish in the 100-meter

breaststroke, and rising sophomore Kate Dwelley's
ninth-place finish in the 200-meter freestyle.
"I was so proud of our team at the trials,"
Maurer said to GoStanford.com. "They were the
best "team' on the deck in my opinion — really sup
porting one another and working hard to make
every swim count for every person on the roster.
There is no doubt in my mind that our team ethos
and positive attitude helped Julia and Elaine onto
the Olympic team. The ladies were their very best
selves all week."
On the men's side, Ben Wildman-Tobriner '07
led the way for the Cardinal, finishing second in the
50-meter freestyle finals with a time of 21.67,
behind Garrett Gale-Weber's new American
record of 21.47. Wildman-Tobriner had already
punched his ticket to Beijing as a member of the
relay pool with a sixth-place finish in the 100-meter
freestyle. He will be the only Cardinal swimmer on
the men's side to compete in the 2008 Olympics, as
narrow defeats highlighted what was otherwise a
strong showing from Stanford athletes.
Rising senior Chris Ash missed qualifying for
Beijing in the 100-meter breaststroke by just three
tenths of a second with a time of 1:01.12 on the sec
ond day in Omaha, and just .11 seconds shy of qual
ifying for the finals of the 200-meter breaststroke on
the fourth day of competition in Omaha. Daniel Beal
'08 was another swimmer with Cardinal ties who nar
rowly missed the cut in Omaha, finishing seventh
with a time of 1:47.56 in the 200-meter freestyle.
Those who have qualified from the Farm will get
to train on familiar territory for the Beijing
Olympics, as the U.S. Olympic swimming team
began practices at Stanford's own Avery Aquatic
Center on Monday. The swimming events in Beijing
are scheduled to run from August 9 to 21.
