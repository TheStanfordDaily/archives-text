# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Five compete for Olympic spots 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SPORTS EDITOR 
With all the hubbub over the
more highly publicized summer
Olympic sports — from basketball to
track to swimming — it can be easy
to forget that Olympic medals carry
the same weight of prestige and
national pride no matter the event.
Another Cardinal powerhouse,
the women's volleyball program, will
be looking to turn some heads in the
direction of its sport at the Beijing
Olympics, as five current and former
Cardinal athletes are currently in the
running to compete for the U.S.
squad. Rising seniors Foluke
Akinradewo and Cynthia Barboza,
along with former Stanford stars
Kristin Richards '07, Oganna
Nnamani '05 and Logan Tom '07
have all been competing with the
preliminary U.S. Olympic team in
hopes of earning a trip to the
Olympics this August and the chance
to compete for a medal on the
national stage.
In pursuit of roster spots for the
Olympic squad, the Cardinal players
have been competing with the rest of
the U.S. national team in the FIVB

World Grand Prix since late June.
U.S. coaches planned to use the
event as a talent evaluation tool to
aid their shaping of the final national
roster that will compete in Beijing.
Sound performances from the cur
rent and former Cardinal stars could
earn them the right to compete on
the international scene.
The squad got off to an inauspi
cious start, dropping a 3-1 loss
against Turkey, 28-26, 25-16, 21-25,
25-19. Barboza and Richards both
put forth solid showings in the loss,
however, as each chipped in a pair of
kills, with Richards also recording an
ace and Barboza notching a team
high three blocks.
After dropping their opener in
the World Grand Prix, the U.S. rock
eted back with seven straight victo
ries, notching a sweep of Kazakhstan
and a 3-2 win over host team Japan
to kick off their winning streak.
Barboza notched four kills late in the
action as a substitute to help the U.S.
down the Japanese team.
In the U.S.'s subsequent wins,
Tom came alive to lead her team
mates, with 17 points, 13 kills and
three blocks against Thailand, nine
kills and 13 kills against the

Dominican Republic, two aces and a
block against Poland. The U.S. won
all three contests, with the wins over
Poland and the Dominican Republic
coming via 3-0 sweeps.
The wins qualified the U.S. for
the final round of play, and the
squad continued to dominate early,
topping Poland and Turkey each a
second time, both 3-1. Tom made
her mark on the stat sheet again ver
sus Turkey, notching seven kills,
three blocks and an ace, while
Akinradewo chipped in a pair of kills
late in the decisive fourth set.
Italy, though, derailed the
American winning streak, as the
Italians triumphed in a sweep, 25-22,
25-21, and 25-16. Starting for the first
time, though, was Akinradewo, who
recorded a team leading nine kills
along with one block and an ace.
Tom added four kills to the U.S.
effort, while Barboza and Richards
chipped in two each.
Tlie U.S. fell again on Tuesday in
Yokohama, Japan, in its opening
competition of the final round
against Brazil. The Brazilian team
won 25-19, 25-19, 25-23, as the
Cardinal's Tom put forth 11 kills in
the losing effort for the U.S.

Nnumani also saw some of her first
action of the tournament, adding six
kills off the bench, while
Akinradewo added a kill and an ace
to her tournament totals.
Rising seniors Akinradewo and
Barboza are the only players remain
ing on the U.S. Olympic preliminary
roster with college eligibility left.
Next up for the U.S. is a match
against host Japan today.
