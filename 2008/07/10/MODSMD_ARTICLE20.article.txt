# Baseball's classic All-Star chaos
## 
### 
It rolls around every year, as
inevitable as the change in sea
sons and as welcome as the end
of a too-long winter.
Well, sort of. Because, while we
all love the All-Star Game — base
ball's annual midsummer classic
between the National and
American Leagues — it seems
there's always something to com
plain about. From the"tie" fiasco a
few years back to the "this time it
counts" nonsense that followed,
there's been plenty to talk about in
recent years especially. And that
doesn't even include the always
stunning final roster announce
ments— year after year there are
always at least a few who don't
belong in the game. And this year is
no different.
Long story short: There's plenty
to like about the All-Star Game.
There always has been. But there's
also plenty to complain about.
Heck, griping about the All-Star
Game may have even become a
yearly pastime as significant to
baseball's hardcore fans as the actu
al game itself. With that out of the
way, here's to the cheers, and here's
to the jeers, too.
Cheers to Bud Selig's decision prior
to the 2003 season to award home
field advantage to the league that
wins the All-Star game, insuring
that at least some people (those
with good teams to root for) will be
paying attention. As unpopular as
the move was at the time, I can't
deny that it does lead me to hate
the talk of American League supe
riority a bit more, and hate the fact
that I can't disprove it still further.
Jeers to the unfairness of it count
ing. Clever marketing or not, why
should the quality of a league on
the whole determine which individ
ual team gets home-field advantage
for the World Series? Ideally, that
advantage should go to the better of
the two pennant winners, but since
there's no real way to measure that
in baseball, where teams in differ
ent leagues only rarely face one
another, it's best to keep it a nice,
random kind of flip-flop, as it was
before.
Cheers to sending Yankee Stadium
out in style. One of the most historic


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
ballparks in baseball is going the
way of the dinosaurs who once
played there (surely baseball has
been around since at least the
Jurassic?), and will be bulldozed in
favor of a new home for its storied
New York franchise following the
2008 season. And given the rise of
the Tampa Bay Devil Kays and con
tinued post-curse awesomeness of
the Boston Red Sox, it's unlikely the
old girl will see any games in the
playoffs. One more game in the
national spotlight is just what the
doctor ordered for all those Yankee
lovers to say goodbye, and the
Yankee-haters to say good riddance.
Jeers to the fact that Yankee
Stadium is going away at all. Off
topic? Yes. But some things are
just too sacred to be axed. The
truly legendary ballparks —
Fenway, Wrigley and Yankee
Stadium — should be preserved for
future generations to admire, not
torn down to appease the wave of
the future and earn a few more
bucks. I've been to the former two
parks, but never to Yankee
Stadium, and now 1 apparently
never will get to go. A shame, if
you ask me.
Cheers to the voters getting it
mostly right in the National League
this year. Pretty much everywhere
you look around the diamond, the
deserving were favored over the
famous. Hanley Ramirez at short
stop over Miguel Tejada. Lance
Berkman at first base over Albert
Pujols (who was injured for a good
stretch to start the season). Yes,
you could make the case that some
of those Cubs starters deserve to be
backups, but then again you can't
argue too much with the best
record in the league getting maybe
a bit more than its fair share of
midsummer publicity. Add young
Phillies ace Cole Hamels to this
roster in place of one of the reliev
ers and it's just about perfect.
Jeers to the American League's
sham of a lineup. How is Dustin
Pedroia starting over lan Kinsler?
How is David Ortiz the "starting"
DH (who won't even play) after
missing so much time with a wrist
injury? How are Jason Varitek and
his .220 batting average even on the
roster? The answer? Style over sub
stance. Yankees and Red Sox get
the pub, so they get the votes, so
they get to start, fair or not. Let's
just thank our lucky stars that fans
only get to pick the starters, or this
would be much, much worse. It
should be pointed out that the real
head-scratcher here, Varitek, was
voted in by his peers within the
game, though. If they call Sean
Casey "The Mayor" for his pleasant
demeanor at first base, they'd bet
ter start calling Varitek "The
President" after pulling a coup like
this.
Love it or hate it, the All-Star
Game is back.

Denis Griffin likes neither the Red Sox
nor the Yankees. Pat him on the hack
or call him a loser at djgriff@stan
