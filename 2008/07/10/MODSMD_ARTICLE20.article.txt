# Baseball's classic All-Star chaos
## 
### 
It rolls around every year, as
inevitable as the change in sea
sons and as welcome as the end
of a too-long winter.
Well, sort of. Because, while we
all love the All-Star Game — base
ball's annual midsummer classic
between the National and
American Leagues — it seems
there's always something to com
plain about. From the"tie" fiasco a
few years back to the "this time it
counts" nonsense that followed,
there's been plenty to talk about in
recent years especially. And that
doesn't even include the always
stunning final roster announce
ments— year after year there are
always at least a few who don't
belong in the game. And this year is
no different.
Long story short: There's plenty
to like about the All-Star Game.
There always has been. But there's
also plenty to complain about.
Heck, griping about the All-Star
Game may have even become a
yearly pastime as significant to
baseball's hardcore fans as the actu
al game itself. With that out of the
way, here's to the cheers, and here's
to the jeers, too.
Cheers to Bud Selig's decision prior
to the 2003 season to award home
field advantage to the league that
wins the All-Star game, insuring
that at least some people (those
with good teams to root for) will be
paying attention. As unpopular as
the move was at the time, I can't
deny that it does lead me to hate
the talk of American League supe
riority a bit more, and hate the fact
that I can't disprove it still further.
Jeers to the unfairness of it count
ing. Clever marketing or not, why
should the quality of a league on
the whole determine which individ
ual team gets home-field advantage
for the World Series? Ideally, that
advantage should go to the better of
the two pennant winners, but since
there's no real way to measure that
in baseball, where teams in differ
ent leagues only rarely face one
another, it's best to keep it a nice,
random kind of flip-flop, as it was
before.
Cheers to sending Yankee Stadium
out in style. One of the most historic
