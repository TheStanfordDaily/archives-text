Brook Lopez gets his
first taste of NBA action

Just over two weeks into his NBA
career, former Stanford sophomore
Brook Lopez has already suited up for
three summer-league games with the
New Jersey Nets, who selected Lopez
with the 10th overall pick of the draft.
Lopez got just under 20 minutes of
playing time in his first professional
game (albeit in the preseason) against
the Orlando Magic and scored 10
points. In his second game, Lopez
scored 18 against the Miami Heat (and
second overall draft choice Michael
Beasley). also in just under 20 minutes.
And in his third outing of the summer,
Lopez scored 22 points in over 30 min
utes and added three blocked shots.
All told, it's been a productive start for
the former Stanford big man.
"1 think Brook keeps getting bet
ter," Nets coach Lawrence Frank told
NBA.com following Lopez's third
game. "Each game he keeps making
strides. He has shown a comfort level
with his post moves. He has a nice
touch. You would say that yesterday
his second half was better than his pre
vious one, and I think today was a
more complete game than the one that
he played prior. You like to see that
improvement."
And it's not only his coach who is
noticing the true seven-looter's
immense potential.
"Brook Lopez was excellent out
there," Nets forward Sean Williams
told NBA.com after Lopez's second
game. "He gave a great effort on the
boards today. He was a presence on
the offensive end in the paint."
Brook's twin brother Robin, mean
while, has yet to see any action with
the Phoenix Suns, who picked him
15th overall. The Suns start their sum
mer-league play on July 14 in Las
Vegas. But already, the other former
Cardinal post presence has established
his unique personality to the Phoenix
media, claiming to be a "perfectionist

at the tilings that are important" and
talking about his artistic talents in a
June 28 article in the East Valley
Tribune. Robin, who wore number 42
with the Cardinal, will wear 15 with the
Suns as a tribute to his older brother,
Alex. The number 42 is retired within
the Suns organization.

Harmon, Bodensteiner
ready to represent New
Zealand roots

Stanford women's basketball play
ers Jillian Harmon '09 and Clare
Bodensteiner '06 were named to the
New Zealand women's basketball
Olympic team on Tuesday. The duo
had previously competed for the Tall
Ferns in April at the Good Luck
Beijing Tournament.
Harmon was born in the United
States, but she holds dual citizenship
because her mother, Julie, was born in
New Zealand. Harmon, a 6'l" for
ward, averaged 6.2 points and 4.8
rebounds last season and played in her
first Final Four. Harmon will return to
the Farm next season as a senior.
Bodensteiner, a 5'9" guard, was
born in Christchurch, New Zealand
but grew up in Rupert, Idaho. At
Stanford, Bodensteiner was a consis
tent bench contributor. She appeared
in 96 games over her five-year career.
The New Zealand national team
has found a use for Bodensteiner as a
three-point specialist. She started all
six games at the Good Luck Beijing
Tournament and shot 50 percent on
three-point attempts.
New Zealand will compete in
Group B, playing Mali, China, the
United States, Spain and the Czech
Republic. The Tall Ferns were riding a
high after beating the world champion
Australians in April, but struggled on a
June tour of Europe. Group B is con
sidered the toughest group at the
Olympics and the Tall Ferns' chances
of reaching the quarterfinals seem slim.
Harmon and Bodensteiner are the

first Stanford women's basketball
players to play in the Olympics since
Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding won
gold medals under Tara VanDerveer
at the 19% Olympics.

Women's soccer set to
send three to Beijing

Joining the long list of current and
former Cardinal athletes slated to
compete at the Beijing Olympics this
August are former Stanford goalkeep
er and current volunteer assistant
coach Nicole Barnhart '04 and
defender Rachel Buehler '06.
Rising senior Ali Riley has also
punched her ticket to Beijing as a
member of the New Zealand national
team. The U.S. national soccer team
opens its Olympic play with a match
against Norway on Aug. 6, while New
Zealand is scheduled to face Japan on
Aug. 6. The squads are scheduled to
face one another on Aug. 12.

Former Stanford throw
ers qualify for U.S.
Olympic squad

Two Stanford graduates qualified
for the U.S. Olympic team as throwers
in Eugene, Ore. last weekend at the
track and field trials.
Jilllian Camarena '04 earned a trip
to Beijing with a throw of 59 feet, 5 1/2
inches in the shot put. Camarena
could not improve upon her first
throw, but that was enough for a third
place finish. The third-place finisher at
the NCAA Championships in 2003,
Camarena broke the school's long
standing shot put record, 57-1, while
on campus.
On Sunday, Michael Robertson '07
also made the U.S. Olympic track and
field team and will compete in the dis
cus at Beijing this August. Robertson
placed second with a toss of 209-01.
The former NCAA champion has
shown that he is capable of better
attempts. His career best is 212-11.

rowers set to compete

Meanwhile, the Stanford freshman
eight lost in their semifinal race
against Trinity College on Saturday.
The frosh eight had an impressive run
at the Henley Royal Regatta in
Henley-On-Thames, England, where
they were competing in the regatta for
the first time and in front of crowds of
over 20,000.
Stanford came in two lengths
behind Trinity's squad, which posted a
time of 7:25. Times were slow all day
as a result of a strong headwind.
Stanford reached the final four of
the draw, emerging from a field of 75
boats. The Cardinal defeated boats
from South Africa and England in the
first two rounds and defeated Cornell,
the defending varsity lightweight
national champion, on July 4 by a full
length.
