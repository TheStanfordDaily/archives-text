# Wildly wonderful Wimbledon
## 
### 
For the past two weeks, 1 have
been waking up earlier than nor
mal. Not because I am still recov
ering from the jet lag incurred by a trip
to the Hast Coast, and not for a sum
mer job. It was to watch Wimbledon.
I thoroughly enjoy watching tennis,
especially on the grass courts at the All
England Club. I love the aura, the
purity of the all-white players' outfits
and the rich tradition. I always enjoy
the two weeks of championships at
Wimbledon, from the first round to
the final. But the 2008 version of the
classic competition might have been
the best two weeks of tennis 1 have
ever seen.
To start, there were plenty of
upsets. Of the 10 top-seeded players
on both the men's and the women's
sides, only half of them made it to the
third round. That, itself, is unprece
dented, and it made for exciting tennis
because you never were sure that the
favorite was going to win.

The unpredictable early rounds set
up the ladies' singles final, which fea
tured the long overdue Williams sisters
duel.
Venus and Serena were the most
consistent players over the two weeks,
with neither one of them dropping a
set the entire tournament. The final
matchup was a return to the women's
tennis game of the early decade, when
it seemed like the sisters were always
playing each other in the semifinals or
finals of every Grand Slam.
This year's version was hotly con
tested, with Serena firing out of the
gates, only to have her older sister
come charging back. Screams issued
from both of the sisters with every
swing of the racket, and you could tell
that each wanted to claim sibling dom
inance for that day. Ultimately, Venus
was better for those couple of hours,
good enough to claim her fifth career
Wimbledon Championship.
And who could ultimately be sur
prised at that? The woman seems to
enter into some other dimension when
she plays on grass. Venus admits that
she absolutely loves everything about
Wimbledon, and it shows. Her size,
her serve (a women's tour record 129
miles per hour in the final), and her
ground stroke always shine at The All
England Club, and this year was no
exception.
What might have been even better
