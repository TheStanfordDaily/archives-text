than the battle of the Williams sisters,
though, were the post-match quota
tions from Serena, which clearly
showed her frustration and disappoint
ment at not playing better. Though she
gave deserved credit to her sister for
playing well, she also gave short, quick
and sometimes snappy answers. It was
a fitting interview after such an intense
match.
In any case, it was great to see the
Williams sisters back and dominating
the opposition. As much as many peo
ple say they cannot stand them, I, for
one, enjoy watching their game and
success. Their emotion and passion for
the sport couldn't be clearer, and they
both bring a fantastic intensity to the
court as they clearly want to win every
single point they play. Is it any wonder

look away when the Williams sisters
are playing the game they love?
And let's face it, love them or hate
them, we will probably remember this
clash between Venus and Serena more

We were blessed last year to have
seen such a great final when Federer
won his fifth straight Wimbledon in a

linger and lie would give way to a new
Wimbledon champion.
Others countered that Federer
hadn't won 65 straight on grass lor
nothing, and he would continue his
dominance in the Finals this year. And
after seven hours of everything good
there is about sports, Nadal dethroned
Federer in a match for the ages.
1 was watching with my family and
some friends and none of us missed a
point. We were simply glued to the
TV. We cheered for shots by both
players and were amazed at the quali
ty of play as well as the finesse that the
two displayed during the match.
Federer's and Nadal's respective tal
ents had emerged in full force, and
both players were near brilliant the
entire time.
It had all the makings of an instant
classic â€” the underdog surging ahead
in the beginning and the favorite and
dominant player slowly coming back
with beautiful shots, all while his oppo-
