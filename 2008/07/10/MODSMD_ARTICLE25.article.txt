## LANGUAGE, LOVE & IRELAND SST tackles works of playwright Brian Friel 
### MONICA MIKLAS 
Stanford's annual summer drama
festival, the aptly named Stanford
Summer Theater (SST), opens its
10th anniversary season with Irish
playwright Brian Friel's
"Translations," a play about lan
guage, love and barriers to communi
cation. This year, as always, SST
boasts a talented cast and crew com
prised of current Stanford students,
alumni, drama department members
and other non-Stanford company
members from the area.
"Translations" opens in 1833
Ireland at a rural "hedge school," a
small, private, traditionally Irish insti
tution. The threat of famine looms in
the air and the Irish people are chaf
ing under British occupation.
Language is an immediate theme, as
characters banter in Irish, Latin and
Greek â€” mocking the British sol
diers surveying their land who only
speak English. A sub-theme centers
on the tension between the hedge
school tradition and the imminent
shift to the British-run National
School system, where English will be
the language of instruction.
Contrasting against the dense his

torical backdrop is a relatively simple
love story of Maire, an Irish woman
energetically portrayed by Maggie
Mason '06. Maire falls in love with a
British soldier, though the barrier of
language, denoted for the audience
by Irish and English accents, sepa
rates the characters.
The SST production of
"Translations" is fairly stylistic, with
a minimalist set and staging. Director
Ed Iskandar '05 says that though
"Translations" is usually staged as a
naturalistic play with "lots of barns,
lots of hay," the abstraction will
"allow the production to be seen and
heard in a more universal context."
Given the complex historical setting,
any effort to reduce distractions from
the text seems a wise directorial
choice.
The cast of "Translations"
includes seasoned Bay Area theater
veterans and SST alumni, as well as
undergraduates sponsored by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education grants. In the mix is Geoff
Hoyle, a popular Bay Area actor who
tackles the role of a Latin-spouting
hedge-school master with obvious
delight. Of the professional actors in
SST, cast member Will Lindemann
'10 says, "It's nice to work with expe
rienced actors and learn from them."
The supporting cast is solid, and often
wickedly lunny in spite of the heavy
subject matter.
The 10th anniversary season of
SST is homage not only to the works
of Brian Friel, hut to the history of
SST. The selection of Friel, widely
regarded as "the Irish Chekov,"
harkens back to the inaugural season
of SST, which featured the writing of
Chekov himself. Artistic Director
Rush Rehm, also a professor of
drama and classics, notes that those
who caught the 2007 season of SST
may find surprising parallels
between last summer's focus on
African and African-American
issues and the current season of Irish
material. Themes of colonialism and
the struggle to maintain cultural
identity bridge the gap between
seemingly unrelated theatrical works
like Lorraine Hansberry's "Les
Blancs" and Friel's "Translations,"
and both seasons are testament to
the personal effects of widespread
social change.
I found "Translations" to be a
moving theater experience, though
I'll admit that my enjoyment may
have been due, at least in part, to my
own fascination with language and
my Irish blood. I highly encourage
the show to anyone with an ear for
language or who is willing to invest
the effort in learning a bit about Irish
history. "Translations," rich with fre
quent allusions to literature, lan
guage and history, is not for the the
atrically faint of heart, but the show
promises not to disappoint curious
and attentive theater-goers.
After "Translations," the SST
players will present "Faith Healer,"
another Friel work. Complementing
the two plays will be a community
symposium, "Friel in Context" and a
free seven-week film series featuring
other Irish artists. The films are
accompanied by discussions led by
Bay Area film scholars.
