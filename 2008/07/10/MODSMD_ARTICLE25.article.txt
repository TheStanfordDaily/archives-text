## LANGUAGE, LOVE & IRELAND SST tackles works of playwright Brian Friel 
### MONICA MIKLAS 
Stanford's annual summer drama
festival, the aptly named Stanford
Summer Theater (SST), opens its
10th anniversary season with Irish
playwright Brian Friel's
"Translations," a play about lan
guage, love and barriers to communi
cation. This year, as always, SST
boasts a talented cast and crew com
prised of current Stanford students,
alumni, drama department members
and other non-Stanford company
members from the area.
"Translations" opens in 1833
Ireland at a rural "hedge school," a
small, private, traditionally Irish insti
tution. The threat of famine looms in
the air and the Irish people are chaf
ing under British occupation.
Language is an immediate theme, as
characters banter in Irish, Latin and
Greek â€” mocking the British sol
diers surveying their land who only
speak English. A sub-theme centers
on the tension between the hedge
school tradition and the imminent
shift to the British-run National
School system, where English will be
the language of instruction.
Contrasting against the dense his

torical backdrop is a relatively simple
love story of Maire, an Irish woman
energetically portrayed by Maggie
Mason '06. Maire falls in love with a
British soldier, though the barrier of
language, denoted for the audience
by Irish and English accents, sepa
rates the characters.
The SST production of
"Translations" is fairly stylistic, with
a minimalist set and staging. Director
Ed Iskandar '05 says that though
"Translations" is usually staged as a
naturalistic play with "lots of barns,
lots of hay," the abstraction will
"allow the production to be seen and
heard in a more universal context."
Given the complex historical setting,
any effort to reduce distractions from
the text seems a wise directorial
choice.
The cast of "Translations"
includes seasoned Bay Area theater
veterans and SST alumni, as well as
undergraduates sponsored by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education grants. In the mix is Geoff
Hoyle, a popular Bay Area actor who
tackles the role of a Latin-spouting
hedge-school master with obvious
delight. Of the professional actors in
SST, cast member Will Lindemann
'10 says, "It's nice to work with expe
rienced actors and learn from them."
The supporting cast is solid, and often
