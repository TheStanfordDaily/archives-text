## Ming's serves up taste, plenty of variety 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
Ming's is truly a treat. This charming Chinese
restaurant, complete with private dining rooms and
an event-friendly environment, definitely merits a
visit. The service is quite prompt, the staff very
responsive and the prices reasonable for the high
quality food presented. The cloth napkins, candlelit
tables and intricate condiment dispensers only add
to the experience. And after just one bite, diners
will realize that Ming's is a place they'll frequent for
culinary exploration.
Service at Ming's is quick and professional, and
its offerings are plentiful: Ming's menu features
over 200 individual dishes, ranging from quail to
Peking duck to dim sum. The wait staff can help you
comb through the extensive menu, if it's too over
whelming. Some diners may not be very familiar
with some of the dishes, especially the dim sum. If
you fall in this category, Ming's is there to introduce
you to this wonderful tradition and have you enjoy
every bite.
To make the menu a little less daunting, Ming's
provides several combination dishes, suitable for
the single diner, a romantic couple or even groups
of 10 or more. Combination platters tend to start
with a subtle salad, full of fresh lettuce and a lightly
dressing. At first, a diner might cry foul about the
scantily dressed salad, but the light starter is meant
to whet your palate and get you ready to find every
flavor in the meal to come.
Next on the docket of this culinary expedition is
a soup. Each combo platter has a recommended
soup listed on the menu, but the wait staff can be
accommodating if diners want to sample another.
An important item to note is the difference
between the Wonton and Wor Wonton soups: Wor
Wonton has imitation crab, shrimp, scallop and
wonton, while the Wonton soup has solely won
tons.
The main dish of any combination plate is the
highlight of the meal. I recommend the dim sum
combo, which includes a pork bun, egg roll, pot
sticker, shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp, sticky rice
and ginger chicken. While these items are classic
dim sum favorites, what sets Ming's apart is the high
quality and flavor of each dish. The crab ragoon —
Ming's signature dim sum dish — has a flavor
unlike any other.
The expedition ends with dessert, which is
included with the combo plate. For the dim sum
platter, sesame balls serve as a wonderful dessert.
Eat them while sipping the house tea and enjoy a
savory end to a wonderful — and filling — meal.
Ming's offers its diners a lot of choice, including
a hefty vegetarian menu, but rest assured that each
dish will be prepared with high quality ingredients,
will be served relatively quickly by a responsive wait
staff and will taste great! Even more, the prices are
very fair for the amount of fcxxl the combos pro
vide, although for those on a budget, I'd recom
mend staying away from the lobster and steak
combo.
Ming's is located at 1700 Embarcadero Rd. in
Palo Alto, off Highway 101. Ming's is also available
for delivery through the Waiters on Wheels service.
The restaurant opeas every day in the late morning
— right in time for lunch — and closes at 9 p.m.
