## Sigur Ros: elevator music with a kick 
### WEIQI SAMANTHA TOH 
For years, I have resisted Sigur Ros
for reasons I feel are justified. Sigur
Ros is an Icelandic band that has been
described as a "more ambient
Coldplay," a comparison that doesn't
merit many points in my book.
Ambient music, after all, has often
been brushed off into the category of
elevator music — nameless, faceless,
each track the Siamese twin of anoth
er. Coldplay imitations, on the other
hand, seem to have sprung up every
where, to the point of a head-mashing
need to retreat to the original masters.
Yet, within a few days of Sigur Ros'
newest release, "Med Sud I Eyrum
Vid Spilum Endalaust" ("With a buzz
in our ears we play endlessly"), there
were already rave opinions from the
music grapevine. Thus, with some
assuaged trepidation, I decided to buy
the record for a listen. If anything, I
thought, at least I would finally have a
CD cover with naked people leaping
fences on my shelf.
At the very onset, Sigur Ros steam
rolled my prejudices flat. Although
ambient, the first track,
"Gobbledigook," deviates from what I
expected to be typical experimental
dream-pop and instead sounds more
upbeat, utilizing a heavier drumbeat
and creative, syncopated overlays.
Sigur Ros manages to maintain their
distinctive sound: Androgynous vocals
have major presence, and their instru
mental arrangements constantly take
center stage.
The second track, "Inni Mer
Svugur Vitleysingur" is another instant
hit, particularly with the introduction
of brass and strings toward the middle
of the song. This addition works well
and enhances the band's sound
beyond that of a traditional four-piece
band. Despite some similarities to the
first track, such as the tendency toward
a rock-pop sound, the second track
had its own defining characteristics. It
had, for example, a softer, more
atmospheric quality, artfully bridging
the harsher first track with the quiet
ambient music of the third.
Perhaps what struck me most is the
trajectory of the track list. Sigur Ros
slides effortlessly into a range of gen
res, each song escaping classification.
Nine-minute "Festival," for example,
juxtaposes Enya-esque, operatic
singing with a livelier remix of the orig
inal tune.
Though unique, Sigur Ros' sound is
comparable to several better-known
artists. The integration of brass resem
bles the music of Andrew Bird, though
the progression of their instrumentals
and heavier rhythms is more reminis
cent of Coldplay. The overall sound
can be compared to Explosions in the
Sky, while their vocalist, Jonsi
Birgisson, sounds like Kings of
Convenience, another Northern
European music group. Suffice to say
that they are creative and diverse,
which should grant them at least a
chance of being loved.
Like all records, there are some
down moments. I lost patience with
some of the excessively slow instru
mentals, such as the beginning of both
"Festival" and "Straumnes." I was
also frustrated with my inability to
comprehend the lyrics, a problem that
should be remedied in time: English
translations will soon be uploaded
onto the Sigur Ros Web site
(http://sigur-ros.co.uk/band/
lyrics.php).
Those appreciative of an overall
lyrical style will enjoy this album most.
It's a record that grows on you, and it's
a buzz in my ear that I'm more than
glad to play endlessly.
