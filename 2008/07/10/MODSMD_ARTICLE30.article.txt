# Del Toro cranks up heat for monstrous sequel

### JEFF GILLILAND 
Sitting in the Metreon theater,
waiting for "Hellboy II: The
Golden Army" to start, the
woman next to me turned and
said, "You know, sometimes they
get lucky."
"That's what keeps me coming
back to these things," I said, "the
hope that they'll get lucky."
But "Hellboy II" didn't get
lucky â€” it got better. Nearly
everything about "Hellboy II" is
better than it was in the original
"Hellboy": The script is funnier,
the characters are more nuanced
and the action sequences are a
hell of a lot more thrilling this
time around.
This tremendous improvement
is due in part to the growth of
Guillermo del Toro. The
writer/director of "Hellboy II" got
his start in American cinema with
"Hellboy," which, while it did well
enough to earn a sequel, was not
exactly a critical darling. Then
came "Pan's Labyrinth," the
movie that earned del Toro an
Oscar nomination and will proba
bly go down as his masterpiece.
It is clear from the first
moments of "Hellboy II" that del

Toro brought what he learned in
"Pan's Labyrinth" to bear in his
newest film. Not only do the mon
sters look much more like "Pan's
Labyrinth" monsters than
"Hellboy" monsters, but "Hellboy
II" is suffused with the same sense
of ancient, desolate magic that set
"Pan's Labyrinth" apart in 2006.
The elves and other mythical crea

tures that inhabit the world of
"Hellboy II" live under the sub
way and in crowded markets hid
den just beyond where humans
choose to look. The movie's
antagonist, the elf-prince Nuada
(Luke Goss), bristles with proud,
