# Del Toro cranks up heat for monstrous sequel

### JEFF GILLILAND 
Sitting in the Metreon theater,
waiting for "Hellboy II: The
Golden Army" to start, the
woman next to me turned and
said, "You know, sometimes they
get lucky."
"That's what keeps me coming
back to these things," I said, "the
hope that they'll get lucky."
But "Hellboy II" didn't get
lucky — it got better. Nearly
everything about "Hellboy II" is
better than it was in the original
"Hellboy": The script is funnier,
the characters are more nuanced
and the action sequences are a
hell of a lot more thrilling this
time around.
This tremendous improvement
is due in part to the growth of
Guillermo del Toro. The
writer/director of "Hellboy II" got
his start in American cinema with
"Hellboy," which, while it did well
enough to earn a sequel, was not
exactly a critical darling. Then
came "Pan's Labyrinth," the
movie that earned del Toro an
Oscar nomination and will proba
bly go down as his masterpiece.
It is clear from the first
moments of "Hellboy II" that del

Toro brought what he learned in
"Pan's Labyrinth" to bear in his
newest film. Not only do the mon
sters look much more like "Pan's
Labyrinth" monsters than
"Hellboy" monsters, but "Hellboy
II" is suffused with the same sense
of ancient, desolate magic that set
"Pan's Labyrinth" apart in 2006.
The elves and other mythical crea

tures that inhabit the world of
"Hellboy II" live under the sub
way and in crowded markets hid
den just beyond where humans
choose to look. The movie's
antagonist, the elf-prince Nuada
(Luke Goss), bristles with proud,

HELLBOY II: Selma Blair and Ron Perlman (Hellboy) bring Guillermo del Toro's vision to life in the sequel to "Hellboy." The director, who was nom
inated for an Oscar for the acclaimed film "Pan's Labyrinth," has brought "Pan's" magic and myscticism to "Hellboy II."

regal anger at the humans. He's also
incredibly proficient with his magi
cal spear, and any fight scene
involving him is beyond awesome.
The point is, a post-"Pan's
Labyrinth" del Toro gives this
movie just the amount of gravitas it
needs to succeed as even a semi
serious action film.
But the improvement of
"Hellboy II" over "Hellboy" is not
all due to del Toro's improvement
as a filmmaker; part of its success
comes by virtue of being a sequel.
Most of the time, sequels suffer
from lack of direction — the first
movie told the story of our hero, so
what is the second movie supposed
to do? "Hellboy II" thrives from the

opposite effect: The first movie did
a horrible job telling our hero's
story, and the second movie gets to
largely ignore that story and focus
on something else entirely..
The first "Hellboy" opens with a
young Hellboy falling through a
portal the Nazis open between
Earth and Hell. Or is it the Earth
and space? It's not quite clear.
What's also not clear is if Hellboy is
indeed a demon or if he's supposed
to be associated with the so-called
"Seven Gods of Chaos," and if his
coming to Earth was an accident or
if he was sent to bring about the
destruction of humanity. These
questions are all raised, though
none are answered.
While "Hellboy II" spends much
of its time following its eponymous
hero (played by Ron Pcrlman), his
fish-man partner Abe Sapien (Doug
Jones) and Hellboy's "fiery" girl
friend Liz (Selma Blair), where the
movie shines is in its focus on

Nuada. Sure, the tale of Nuada
sounds a lot like the lost story of
Middle-Earth — humans fight
elves; elves build indestructible
robot army to destroy humans;
humans and elves make a truce; elf
prince wants to break that truce,
resurrect the army and kill all of
humanity — but at least it has depth
and the ability to compel a two-hour
movie.
Unfortunately, Guillermo del
Toro can't fully ignore the story of
his hero and it bogs the middle of
"Hellboy 11" with a return to the
prophecies of the first movie.
Thankfully, the film quickly recov
ers and ends with a satisfying final
battle, a minor revelation and space
for a three-quel if "Hellboy II" is an
earner. Compared to its predeces
sor, this movie certainly deserves to
be.
