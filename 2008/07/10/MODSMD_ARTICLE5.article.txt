## HOSPITAL & CLINICS Senator targets Schatzberg for conflict of interest Psychiatry prof. questioned for ties to drug companies 
### RYAN MAC 
Psychiatry Prof. Allan Schatzberg, a
renowned and well-respected member of
Stanford's School of Medicine, has become the
center of a Senate investigation into
researchers who work on university campuses,
while also cooperating with drug companies
and other outside corporations.
Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) and the
Senate Finance Committee pursued an investi
gation of whether it is necessary to regulate
and restrict the relationships between
researchers, universities and private compa
nies.

Schatzberg, the Kenneth T. Norris
Professor and Chairman of the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, as well as
elected president of the American Psychiatric
Association, became a focus of the inquiry
when Grassley looked into his financial
records. The senator concluded in an address
to committee that "the lack of consistency
between what Dr. Schatzberg reported to
Stanford and what several drug companies
reported to me seems to follow a pattern of
behavior."
Among discrepancies noted was a $22,000
payment made from Johnson and Johnson, as
well as the professor's failure to report hold
ings in the drug company Corcept.
The latter situation has provided the source
of much debate for Sen. Grassley and the
Senate Finance Committee. Corcept
Theraputics, founded in 1998, is a leader in
depression treatment, especially with the

recently developed Mifepristone (RU-486).
With over $6 million in stock in Corcept,
Schatzberg, who is also a cofounder of the
company, is being investigated for an alleged
failure to report stock and the sales of stock in
excess of $100,000 (the threshold for reporting
holdings) to Stanford.
The University denies, however, that
Schatzberg sidestepped any University policy.
Stanford defended Schatzberg's adherence in a
recent press release.
"We believe it important to emphasize that
the University was fully aware of the extent of
Dr. Schatzberg's stake in Corccpt Therapeutics
and managed the conflict of interest to ensure
that it did not influence the research he was
conducting," the release stated. "Dr.
Schatzberg has consistently disclosed on his
annual conflict-of-interest forms his ownership
of equity in Corcept Therapeutics in excess of
$100,000."

Furthermore, regarding Dr. Schatzberg's
activities with Johnson and Johnson, the
University said that errors in financial records,
mislabeling and differences in fiscal-year time
periods were behind the Senate's claimed dis
crepancies.
In an email to The Weekly, Schatzberg said
that he has done everything possible to follow
University and government policy.
"I have fully complied with all disclosures
required by Stanford and the National Institute
of Health," he said. "1 am committed to the
pursuit of knowledge that will lead to the alle
viation of the pain and suffering of those with
severe psychiatric illnesses. No one likes to be
under scrutiny of a Congressional investiga
tion; however, I know my work has been con
ducted with the utmost integrity, meeting the
