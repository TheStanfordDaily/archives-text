## Hands-free law goes into effect Students bothered by possible infraction 
### LAURA RUMPF STAFF WRITER 
California's new law prohibiting dri
vers from talking on a handheld wireless
device while driving has not stopped
some Stanford drivers from taking their
chances. According to Stanford Police
Department Public Information Officer
Bill Larson, deputies have issued sever
al warnings and citations for the viola
tion since the law went into effect July 1.
If caught talking on a handheld cellu
lar phone and driving, a driver can be
pulled over and issued a fine, which
starts at $20 and can escalate with each
subsequent infraction.
"The concern is for the safety of all
who operate a motor vehicle, cart or
bicycle, and for those around them,"
Larson said.
Instead of handheld devices, drivers
who wish to make or receive calls on the
road must now purchase a hands-free
device, such as an earpiece or a
Bluetooth headset, which range in cost
from about $15 to over $100.
Some students on campus for the
summer say that while compliance with
the ban is not a serious inconvenience,
they aren't convinced that the ban
improves driver nor pedestrian safety.
"I think the law is definitely well
intentioned, but I don't think that talk-
ing on a cell phone is any more dis
tracting for me than talking on a
hands-free device, adjusting the
radio or holding a conversation
with someone in the car," Gwen
Lawson '09 said. "I'm not sure how
much the law will actually make

driving on campus and in
California much safer."
James Ren '09 agreed.
"Personally, 1 don't think it will
make much of a difference," she
said. "I think the problem is more
with not being able to pay atten
tion while having a conversation.
Using a hands-free device isn't
really going to address that prob
lem."
Ren recently purchased a
Bluetooth headset to comply with

the new law, but said she was
already planning to do so before
hearing about the ban.
Lawson noted that she does not
intend to purchase any sort of
hands-free device."
Instead, I'll just make my pas
sengers take the phone or call peo
ple back later," she said.
The ban does not apply to non
driving car passengers' use of cell
phones, nor does it apply to text
messaging or dialing numbers

while driving.
California traffic safety officials
have expressed optimism over the
efficacy of the new law. They esti
mate that with the ban on hand
held devices in effect, there will he
around 300 fewer traffic deaths
each year in a state where 4,000
people are killed annually in traffic
accidents.
