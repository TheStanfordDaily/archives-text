## Incoming frosh unite for League Not yet on campus, 2012 already protecting Stanford from Cal 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ben Jensen '12 is president of the Stanford Justice
League, a student group of over 100 incoming freshmen
that is committed to community service, school spirit
and, most importantly, rooting against Cal.
But Jensen and his three fellow co-founders — Karyn
Haitz '12, Ashley Titan '12, and Ben Laufer '12 — have
yet to move into their freshman dorms.
In yet another sign that Facebook is revolutionizing
the way incoming freshmen approach Stanford, the
Class of 2012 has moved beyond just forming a large
class group and has created a student group that hopes
to stay active throughout the school year.
The four founders of the Justice League have not met
in person since Admit Weekend, hut already have high
hopes for their group.
"Our mission is to protect Stanford from all things
Cal as we are [a] band of superheroes," states the
group's constitution. "In addition to offering protection
to the Cardinal Community, we also work with the com
munity and do volunteer work."
A group t-shirt, featuring the "Super Tree," has
already been designed and sold, and co-founder Titan is
already hard at work contacting bicycle companies for
the group's bike helmet initiative.
But perhaps most importantly, the group is allowing
frosh to connect with each other in advance of
September's New Student Orientation, easing the transi
tion into life at Stanford.

"It's such a fun way to connect with fellow classmates
— to have inside names, group t-shirts and a sense of
unique belonging," said group member Estela Go '12.
"Facebook has been an awesome and easy form of com
munication between incoming freshmen. Everyone has
an interesting story to tell, and one wall post can unleash
great relationships, extraordinary people, future men
tors and lasting friends."
The image of frosh riding through campus in match
ing Cardinal-colored bike helmets surely sounds appeal
ing, but the group's members haven't been on campus
long enough to find just how rare it is to see an under
grad sporting a bike helmet.
The group has already learned from the mistakes of
past classes, however, and is planning to avoid them.
"We stay away from Kryptonite and will avoid cap
ture the flag as well." Jensen said, referring to the Class
of 201 l's failed pre-NSO capture the Hag event, which
was shut down by the Freshman Dean's Office. Instead,
the Justice League is planning Ultimate Frisbee in the
Oval and will be inviting Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims to join the
game.
The Stanford Justice League may already have fea
tures of an official student organization, including a
board of directors and applications for officer positions,
but at its heart the group is a representation of the
excitement incoming freshmen experience just prior to
joining the Stanford community.
"We think the Justice League is a great way to trans
form the Clark Kents and Bruce Waynes of Stanford
into full-fledged Supermen and Batmen (and women),"
Jensen said. "We are united by a desire to root for
Stanford."
