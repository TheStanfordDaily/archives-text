## Education profs, required to make papers public 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford's School of Education has become the
first education school in the nation to require faculty
members to make their scholarly articles publicly
available for free, according to The Stanford Report.
The policy — proposed by Education Prof. John
Willinsky and approved unanimously by the school's
faculty in June — is based on a similar open-access
policy implemented by Harvard Law School earlier
this year. Although faculty members may request
waivers from the policy, those under the policy will
give the University "a worldwide, nonexclusive
license to post their articles online at no cost to read
ers," The Report stated.
Willinsky told The Report that the new policy will
be most beneficial to those without acccss to
University libraries and noted that although 80 per
cent of scholarly journals arc available online, many
are limited to subscribers.
The School of Education will also revamp its Web
site to include a search page, and articles will be avail
able through online search engines such as Google
Scholar.
