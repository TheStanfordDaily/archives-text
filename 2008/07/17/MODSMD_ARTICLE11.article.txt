# STUDENT LIFE
## Parties go green for sustainability 
### EMMA MARTIN DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Compared to the average all-campus bash,
Sigma Nu's Sunsplash was remarkably environ
mentally friendly last spring, thanks to efforts
by Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).
As part of the group's ongoing efforts to make
Stanford parties more sustainable, SSS is writ
ing reports evaluating their eco-friendliness.
Sunsplash organizer John Mulrow '09 was
largely responsible for making the Sigma Nu
bash a success as the first party to attempt sus
tainable practices.
"[Mulrow] will literally cringe upon finding a
red cup crushed in the corner of a room," said
fellow organizer Wes Mateo '07. "If anyone
deserves credit for the gradual strides toward
sustainability this campus has made, it is him."
Sigma Nu's efforts to make Sunsplash envi
ronmentally friendly spanned from advertising
to waste management. Organizers printed 300
black-and-white posters on recycled paper sal
vaged from Sigma Nu's computer cluster.
"The way we looked at it, there really wasn't
any reason to waste a pack of new paper for a
bunch of flyers that people would probably only
be taking passing glances at," Mateo said.
Organizers also bought recyclable plastic
cups, as opposed to the typical red ones used at
parties. While the new cups cost five cents more
than the red cups (10 cents as compared to five
cents), the Sunsplash coordinators thought they

were a good
investment in

light of the
1,500 to 2,000
cups typically

used at large
campus par
ties, according
to the SSS
report.

"The morning
after Sunsplash, all
glass, aluminum and

plastic were cleaned
up into big recycling
bins," the sustainability

report stated. "There was
hardly any landfill-bound
trash generated at the party."

While the Sunsplash organizers
spent more money on cups, they
made up for the cost by spending less

money on lumber. Wood for
party decorations and structures
was bought at Palo Alto's
Warehouse Building Supply,

which reclaims lumber from demolished homes.
The coordinators also cut back on lighting,
as Sigma Nu relied solely on power supplied to
the house. Resulting technical difficulties lead
ing up to the party, however, may lead organiz
ers to revert to using generators in the future.
Mateo described the reaction to the party as

overwhelmingly positive. He and his
fellow organizers

said that they
hope the
1 example set

by Sunsplash
will serve as an
inspiration to
future party
planners.

r
"Sunsplash
demonstrated for
everyone to see that

you can incorporate sus
tainability into your party
objectives and still execute

an overwhelmingly successful
and enjoyable event for the com
munity," Mateo said.

ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey '09 and Vice President Pagan Harris
'09 are enthusiastic about the blossoming

eco-friendly practices around campus.
"We want to make sustainability more
student-driven." Dorsey said.
In the fall, the ASSU will pursue subsi-

dies to make it easier for students to buy the
recyclable cups. They also plan to work with the
Office of Student Affairs to implement a green
label that will "advertise green-friendly par
ties," according to Harris.
