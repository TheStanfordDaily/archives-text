## UC service workers strike for wages 
### GALE HOLLAND LOS ANGELES TIMES 
LOS ANGELES — Service workers at the
University of California's 10 campuses and hos
pitals went on strike Monday over a salary dis
pute.
More than 250 custodians, groundskeepers
and their supporters lined up outside the new
University of California, Los Angeles Ronald
Reagan Medical Center, carrying sings that read
"Taking back UC for patients, Students and Our
Families."
"We're standing in front of this new medical
center so people can see that they have enough
money to build this multi-billion dollar medical
center but we can't get a raise," said Tyrone
Shoelaces, 40, a food service worker who said he
is forced to work a second job at Target to make
ends meet.
Monica Martinez, 35, a nursing assistant, was
among many patient-care workers who honored
the picket line. A single parent with four chil
dren, Martinez said she also has to work two
jobs, including another shift at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center.

She said patient care workers are underpaid
compared with other area hospitals.
"We should make equal pay for equal work,"
Martinez said.
Tom Rosenthal, chief medical officer for
UCLA hospitals, said that the hospitals' emer
gency rooms remained open and that 110 surg
eries had been canceled. He estimated less than
10 percent of patient-care technical staff did not
show up.
But he cautioned that the longer the strike
goes on, the greater the threat to patient care
would be.
"What makes this strike so dangerous is we
don't know from day to day who might show
up," he said. "If we have to close the emergency
department, we'd be putting the people of
California at risk."
The workers, members of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, say they are paid 25 percent less
than workers who hold similar jobs at commu
nity colleges and private hospitals. UC and
the union have been negotiating a new con
tract since last year without success, and the
union had voted to strike if its demands were

not met.
The contract dispute is taking place as the
UC system faces severe funding shortages.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed a
budget for next year that would leave the uni
versity $240 million short of covering its costs.
Union President Lakesha Harrison has
claimed that the university has the funds to
pay the food service, custodial, medical and
other workers a decent wage but that it is not
a priority for the university. Some top UC
officials, she noted, have received large pay
increases.
"No one's trying to get rich here," she said
earlier this month. "It makes no sense that the
world-renowned University of California can
not pay its workers at least what community
colleges in their areas are paying."
She defended the union's strategy of asking
prominent supporters such as former
President Clinton and former state Assembly
Speaker Fabian Nunez to cancel their UC
commencement addresses, charging that the
university has had many months to negotiate a
new contract. One contract expired last fall;
the other early this year.
