## Stu's Views The
						Other Flip-Flop Drops 
### 
We're still in the
campa i g n' s
"silly season,"
and the silly talk has
focused on Sen. Barack
Obama's supposed
"flip-flopping."
Political cartoonists
have had a field day,
with cartoon after car-

toon using easy metaphors to unleash a scathing critique of Obama's
so-called "pandering" and "flip-flopping."
Obama predictably looks bad, but somehow John McCain looks
like a principled saint in all of this. Remembering the damaged
charges against John Kerry in 2004, the Obama camp has tried their
best to clamp down on the accusations before they get out of hand.
Charges of flip-flopping emerge mostly from Obama's very public
"reversal" on campaign finance and his "repositioning" on the Iraq
question. He previously pledged to accept public funding for the gen
eral election (which limits his spending), but later backed out of the
pledge. Fair enough. John McCain charged that he was a hypocrite,
and pledged to remain within spending limits. Nevermind that
McCain is funneling most of his campaign funds through the
Republican National Committee (RNC), which has no limits on
donations, meaning he can raise much more per donor than Obama
and spend unlimited amounts of money. McCain is violating the spir
it of the campaign-finance law that bears his name, if not the letter.
Obama, somehow, is the one who bears the vast majority of the criti
cism.
The Iraq issue is Obama's other big problem. His mistake was to
commit to an ironclad 16-month withdrawal plan during the pri
maries, which thrilled the party's left-wing activists. But even Obama
has to face the fact that the war is going much better than it was a year
ago, and a complete withdrawal less than two years from now is
unfeasible. A commander-in-chief willing to change his mind is a rare
and precious thing; witness the obstinacy of LB.I and George W.
Bush, and how unsuccessful they were in leading a war effort. John
McCain, for his part, has said recently that most troops will be out of
Iraq by 2013. McCain's recent policy changes on the Iraq War have
not been less significant than Obama's.
How John McCain has managed to escape charges of flip-flopping
is astounding, which suggests a double standard for Democrats and
Republicans. Since his previous presidential run in 2000. he has com
pletely reversed positions at least 61 times according to the political
Web site The Carpetbagger Report. He once opposed Bush's tax cuts;
now he supports them. He once argued that waterboarding was tor
ture; now he doesn't. McCain once opposed Jim Webb's G1 Bill
expansion; he later took credit for its passage. Once a deficit hawk, he
proposes to cut domestic spending by $690 million without raising
taxes (which will triple the deficit). Not only has McCain reversed his
positions, but he's been dishonest and disingenuous in doing so, as
well as indignant and sell-righteous whenever reporters discuss his
reversals.
We see this double standard for Democrats and Republicans over
and over again. George W. Bush ran as an evangelical in the 2000 pri
maries, reversed course and ran as a "compassionate conservative" in
the general election. McCain's very public pandering to conservatives
is regarded as a good thing, necessary to win. On the other hand, John
Kerry's move to the center, which was borne more out of a failure to
communicate effectively, rather than policy changes, deeply damaged
his presidential campaign. As soon as Obama makes some minor pol
icy changes, commentators jump on him and exaggerate the reversals,
while McCain skates by. Republicans are allowed to pander and
Democrats are not.
To be honest, I like this new Obama more than the old one. The
version of Obama we saw in the primaries was resolutely liberal, even
daring to challenge NAFTA, which has been a boon for the American
economy. This new, more thoughtful Obama is far more suited to be
president than the markedly non-innovative one during the primaries.
