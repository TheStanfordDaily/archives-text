# This Stanford Life
## Stanford Arts Deficiency 
### 
We all remember from back in
high school reading those
glossy college brochures filled
with photos of suspiciously happy stu
dents. There was the guy throwing the
Frisbee on a lawn, the diverse group of
friends chatting in the union and, like
clockwork, the artistic-looking student
painting outside.
Stanford's 2007 brochure is not too
different. On page 15, it features a small
photo of a girl working on her own art
piece. The message is that art is an
important part of the Stanford experi
ence. Certainly this is true for a small
but enthusiastic group of students here.
In general, though, Stanford suffers
from an arts deficiency — on both the
participation and the resource ends.
The good news is that the students and
administration are trying to fix this. It
seems, however, to be puzzlingly persis
tent.
First, it is important to note that
Stanford actually has many arts
resources that, despite their quality,
lack undergraduate participation.
Stanford Lively Arts, for instance, is a
very professional community resource.
But not once can I remember a student
going to one of their shows. Cantor
Arts Center, while well known, exists
more in students' imaginations than on
their list of places to visit. Even their
"First Thursdays" parties, designed for
undergraduates, are usually attended

Craft

by a small group of students. Finally,
KZSU, the campus radio station, has an
enormous collection of blues, jazz, rock
and world music available to students
affiliated with the station. But, faced
with relatively low undergraduate par
ticipation, the station is mostly run by
alumni and community members.
Low student participation in the
arts is an important piece of the puz
zle, but sometimes the resources don't
meet the demand. The studio art
department is a case in point. The
number of spaces for arts classes is
usually limited. Often, non-studio art
majors — like freshmen and undecid
ed sophomores — do not even get a
chance to take an introductory class. 1
was twice denied a spot in Painting I,
for example. Also, the Cummings Art
Building, home to the studio art and
art history departments, is so cramped
that many faculty have had to move to
other buildings. Departments always
compete for more space — scarcity is
a fact of life. But if allotted space is at
all a measure of priorities, then art is
not currently a very high priority.
This, however, is changing.
The administration has launched
the Stanford Arts Initiative as part of
the almighty Stanford Challenge. The
Initiative's goals are to admit more

arts-oriented students, fund more arts
related practices, fund art programs in
residences and, in the long-term, cre
ate better facilities. This plan entails
building an "arts district" adjacent to
Cantor. This area would house a huge
new concert hall courtesy of the Bings
and new facilities for the art depart
ment. It will take shape over the next
decade.
So, Stanford has a lot of great
resources, lacks others, and is generally
trying to improve. But will this ulti
mately make a difference? The prob
lem is puzzlingly persistent. A Daily
article about low arts participation ran
back in 1999, for instance. Maybe, in
the end, Stanford is too pre-profession
al and too tech-heavy to ever be partic
ularly artistic, even with gradual
improvements. 1 am tempted to trace
the situation back to the admissions
office and the type of students that it
accepts — a lot of doers, but few
thinkers. A lot of engineers, but few
poets.
The answer, though, is not one
sided. Most of my friends agree that the
arts at Stanford are weak, and knee
jerk blame a lack of money. The prob
lem, however, is more complex than
that, and certainly some blame has to
go the undergraduates themselves.
