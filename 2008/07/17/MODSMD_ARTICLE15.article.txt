## Jack Duane NFL owes Favre a do-over 
### 
Brett Favre wants to play foot
hall. This simple fact lies
behind Green Bay Packers
GM Ted Thompson's cryptic press
release and Aaron Rodgers' politi
cally correct statements. People
have labeled him selfish and imma
ture and suggested that he is hurting
the future of the Packers. But what
is truly unfortunate in all of this is
that people have overlooked Brett
Favre's admirable qualities as
revealed during this ordeal.
Packers fans fell in love with
Favre for his boyish spirit. His
unique love of the game, which
seems rare in this day and age,
fueled the conception of Favre
mania. Green Bay residents, analyst
and former Super Bowl-winning
coach John Madden and fans across
the nation idolized a flawed man
because he played the game the
right way. Indeed, the Favre-fervor
went so far that maybe you even
hated him, just because your neigh
bor supported him so obnoxiously.
Favre's latest move, his request
to be released by the Green Bay
Packers, is not a scar on the face of
his prolific career but rather a testa
ment to his undying affection for the
game of football.
He tried to leave. He did. On
March 6 at a tear-filled press confer
ence, Favre told the world that he
was done. But the boy in him, the
kid who once declared, "Every
touchdown 1 threw for the Green
Bay Packers was really fun," had the
itch to play. Like a little kid stretch
ing a game of pickup until the last
strand of light has faded into the
night sky, Favre wants to play some
more football. So he called up Ted
Thompson and revealed his boyish
spirit once more and all that comes
with it, good and bad.
Are you still opposed to Favre's
comeback? Consider the things that
he has to play for. He's not coming
back to break a legendary record
like Barry Bonds did in 2007. Favre
already broke Dan Marino's career
I'D record and has no numbers to
chase. And it's not as if Favre is out
to milk the system for every dollar
he can get like Roger Clemens did
with the MLB for four years after his
"retirement."
Favre already has a Super Bowl
ring and he doesn't need to pad his
stats to ensure a Hall of Fame bid.
Thompson suggested that he was
trying to protect Favre's legacy
throughout this process, but Favre
responded by telling Fox News that
Thompson's supposed advocacy of
his legend was "a bunch of bull."
We, as modern sports fans, aren't
used to this kind of thing. In the era
of holdouts, endorsements and
showboating, Favre wants to play
because he enjoys it. Maybe he isn't
the only one. He probably isn't. But
his is the most famous recent case of
enjoyment being the motivation to
extend a career.
The Packers want to move on.
Rodgers is their quarterback and
the entire organization is standing
behind the decision to give him a
chance. Favre isn't stupid, and he
isn't selfish cither. He understands
coach Mike McCarthy's desire to
plan for the future. Favre even
agrees with reporters who suggest
that a comeback to the Packers
would be unfair to Rodgers. The
Green Bay legend requested his
release so that he can play football
without hurting the team and the
fans that he loves so much. He reit
erated in his interview with Fox
News, "I've always been a Packer,
always will be a Packer. Will I play
somewhere else? Remains to be
seen."
You can criticize NFL players all
you want for their lack of loyalty,
but it is becoming apparent that
teams don't value their players as
much as they'd like for you to think.
Former Patriots cornerback Asante
Samuel was burned by the media
for taking top dollar and running to
Philadelphia. Chad Johnson has
been vigorously criticized for
demanding a trade out of
Cincinnati. But, in a reversal of
roles, the. Packers, in their hesita
tion to welcome Favre back with
open arms, have shown a lack of
loyalty to one of the players who
has given the organization the most
over its long history.
If Favre does play in the NFL
this fall, for the Packers or Vikings
or whomever, turn on your TV
because the guy who's still a kid at
heart might just give us one more
chance to cheer.

Madden's poetic praise of Brett Favre
one more time. Let Jack know what
