# OLYMPIC WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## US topples Australia in 7-5 thriller 
### SUSAN LOU 
As far as showdowns go, they usually don't
get much bigger than this.
A record 3,000 fans filled Avery Aquatic
Center for the face-off between the No. 1 U.S.
Olympic Team and No. 2 Australia, making it
the largest turn-out for any U.S. women's water
polo event in history. Hundreds of disappointed
fans waited in lines for hours to get a ticket,
only to be turned away when the stadium was
filled to capacity.
Dubbed the "Blastoff to Beijing," last
Thursday's exhibition was the last in a series of
four games between the U.S. and Australia in
preparation for the Olympic Games in Beijing.
Although Australia put up a good fight the
entire way, the U.S. team took home a 7-5 win,
finishing 3-1 in its series with Australia.
It was a clear sunny day, perfect weather for
water polo, with people packed shoulder to
shoulder on the bleachers. On the sidelines, the
U.S. men's swimming team watched the players
warm up, and a crowd of girls shrieked with
delight as they stampeded down the stairs in a
comical attempt to catch a glimpse of the
famous Michael Phelps.
But at the sound of the gun, the U.S. team
got right down to business. Brenda Villa '03, a
former member of the Cardinal team and three
time U.S. Olympic water polo team player,
scored the first goal of the match with 3:54
remaining in the first quarter to put the U.S.
Team into the lead, 1-0. This would be the only
goal of the first period, however, despite sever
al incredible shots and close calls on both sides.
Australia scored within the first 30 seconds
of the second quarter, tying the game at 1-1, but
roughly 90 seconds later Villa knocked them
back down, lobbing in a shot from the middle.
But when Villa was whistled out for a live
meter penalty, the Australians surged ahead
with two goals, as they took their first lead of
the game at 3-2. The lead didn't last for long,
though, as Allison Gregorka '07 sent a mon
strous lob shot into the net to tie the score back
up again at 3-3.
The teams tussled back and forth during the
third quarter, with both showing incredible

energy and spunk. There were plenty of fouls
called, and on multiple occasions skirmishes
broke out between opposing players away from
the action.
Rough play was a theme of the game. Jane
Larkins and Skylar Dorosin, high-school club
water polo players who had the opportunity to
sit with the U.S. team during the game, report-

Ed seeing huge red marks on (lie players' backs
and even some blood from vicious grabs and
scratches.
Although the game was intense throughout,
it was not until the fourth quarter that every
thing was turned up a few notches.

Rising senior Jessica Steffens and the top-ranked U.S. women's water polo squad pulled out a win
over No. 2 Australia last Thursday, thanks largely to the efforts of team leader Brenda Villa '03.
