## Cardinal primed for explosive follow-up Key underclassmen ready to step into the limelight in '09 
### ERIK ADAMS STAFF WRITER 
Although the Cardinal's unexpected postsea
son run came to an end at the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. less than a month ago, it's
not too soon to start thinking about what the
club will look like next year. With the likely
departure of plenty of big contributors, there can
be little doubt that, for better or worse, big
changes will be afoot for Stanford baseball.
It is a fact in collegiate sports, where players
have at most four full years of eligibility, that

teams arc constantly in need of new talent to
move to the forefront when the established lead
ers graduate or move on to professional athletics.
And this need is especially great after a success
ful season fueled by a talented group of upper
classmen — as was the case with the Cardinal's
2008 season.
It is too early to know if every player drafted
last month will sign a professional contract
rather than return to the Farm, but if they all do,
the Cardinal will be without rising seniors Jason
Castro (C), Cord Phelps (2B), Sean Ratliff (CF),
Jeremy Bleich (LHP) and Austin Yount
(RHP/DH), in addition to graduated seniors
Brendan Doinaracki (OF), Randy Molina
(18/DH), Erik Davis (RHP), Rex Petrill (RHP)
and David Stringer (RHP). Castro, Yount and
Phelps have all already signed their first profes
sional contracts with the Houston Astros, Los

Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians, respec
tively.
To put the possible departure of these 10
players in perspective, they accounted for 56 per
cent of the team's hits (401 of 715), 51 percent of
the at bats (1220 of 2392), 68 percent of the home
runs (55 of 81), 59 percent of the total bases (673
of 1141), 55 percent of the runs (278 of 504) and
59 percent of the RBIs (278 of 470). From the
mound they represented 44.3 percent of the
innings pitched (267.1 of 603.1), 49.1 percent of
the strikeouts (216 of 440) and 53.7 percent of
the wins (22 of 41).
Of course, whoever Stanford turns to would
make up some of this production, and the
bumper crop of young players growing on the
Farm looks fully capable of keeping the Cardinal
competitive next season. And the
experienced players remaining on
the team just add more reasons for
optimism.
The infield looks to be in good
shape despite losing Phelps, Molina
and Castro. Rising sophomores
Zach Jones and Jake Schlander
played nearly every inning on the

left side of the infield and should
only improve both in the field and at
the plate with experience.
Schlander's defense at short drew
especially rave reviews as the season
went on. Other rising sophomores
who did not have as much experi
ence last season but look to be fix
tures in the infield include Ben
Clowe, who hit a monstrous home
run in the Cardinal's last-gasp effort
against Georgia in Omaha, Colin
Walsh and Jonathon Kaskow. Also
returning will be rising senior J.J.
Jelmini and rising junior Adam

Gaylord, who should provide lead
ership.
The outfield will be full of experi
ence with rising seniors Joey August
and Jeff Whitlow and rising junior
Toby Gerhart, all of whom are solid
fielders and capable of chipping in
quality at-bats. Junior Wande
Olabisi, who was primarily used as a
pinch-runner last season, can also
play in the outfield. Also emerging
to help out will be rising sopho
mores Dave Giuliani, Kellen
Kiilsgaard and Kellen McColl.
But perhaps most significant for

the continued health of the Cardinal
lineup is the return of rising senior
Brent Milleville. Milleville was a key
contributor down the stretch for
Stanford — as the team's most dan
gerous right-handed bat, he often hit
fourth in the lineup, protecting the
left-handed batting Castro. After
surprisingly going undrafted in June,
Milleville, and his .593 slugging per
centage, should give the Cardinal at
least one key cog for the heart of the
order next season, and could even
be called upon to catch more often
for the team in 2009.
The bullpen looks to be in good
shape, especially considering true
freshman Drew Storen's emergence
last season as the closer. If he stays
in a bullpen role as a sophomore, he
will be joined by rising senior Blake
Hancock, as well as several sopho
mores who played key roles as
freshmen last season: Michael
Marshall, Alex Pracher and Danny
Sandbrink.
Given Sandbrink's success in
the rotation in the postseason,
however, he could be lifted into the
starting rotation, where he would
join rising senior Jeffery Inman
(the only veteran starter on the
2009 roster). Max Feamow, also a
rising senior, struggled as a starter
last season but is one of most expe
rienced starling pitchers on the
team and should get a chance to
play a key role. Another candidate
for the rotation is rising sophomore
Cory Bannister (the younger
brother of Kansas City Royals
pitcher Brian Bannister).
Of course, there will be plenty
more opportunities for pitchers
both in the bullpen and in the rota
tion, especially with the condensed
schedule instituted last year that
gives more opportunities lor mid
week starters. Just like last season,
there should be a range of incoming
freshmen and sophomores with lim
ited experience emerging in relief
roles and getting opportunities to
start.
With this mix of upcoming play
ers and experienced upperclassmen,
Stanford should be able to stay com
petitive and avoid too much of a let
down after last season's great run.
And, because of the overall youth of
this team, the Cardinal has a real
chance to field an excellent squad in
2010.

As a true-freshman in 2008, Jake Schlander was lauded for his tremendous glove-work at shortstop all year long.
But as the postseason rolled around, Schlander's bat started to come alive as well. Schlander's emergence into a
dominant all-around player could play a key role in a Cardinal run back to Omaha in 2009.

As a true-freshman in 2008, Jake Schlander was lauded for his tremendous glove-work at shortstop all year long.
But as the postseason rolled around, Schlander's bat started to come alive as well. Schlander's emergence into a
dominant all-around player could play a key role in a Cardinal run back to Omaha in 2009.
Although the Cardinal's unexpected postsea
son run came to an end at the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. less than a month ago, it's
not too soon to start thinking about what the
club will look like next year. With the likely
departure of plenty of big contributors, there can
be little doubt that, for better or worse, big
changes will be afoot for Stanford baseball.
It is a fact in collegiate sports, where players
have at most four full years of eligibility, that

teams arc constantly in need of new talent to
move to the forefront when the established lead
ers graduate or move on to professional athletics.
And this need is especially great after a success
ful season fueled by a talented group of upper
classmen — as was the case with the Cardinal's
2008 season.
It is too early to know if every player drafted
last month will sign a professional contract
rather than return to the Farm, but if they all do,
the Cardinal will be without rising seniors Jason
Castro (C), Cord Phelps (2B), Sean Ratliff (CF),
Jeremy Bleich (LHP) and Austin Yount
(RHP/DH), in addition to graduated seniors
Brendan Doinaracki (OF), Randy Molina
(18/DH), Erik Davis (RHP), Rex Petrill (RHP)
and David Stringer (RHP). Castro, Yount and
Phelps have all already signed their first profes
sional contracts with the Houston Astros, Los

Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians, respec
tively.
To put the possible departure of these 10
players in perspective, they accounted for 56 per
cent of the team's hits (401 of 715), 51 percent of
the at bats (1220 of 2392), 68 percent of the home
runs (55 of 81), 59 percent of the total bases (673
of 1141), 55 percent of the runs (278 of 504) and
59 percent of the RBIs (278 of 470). From the
mound they represented 44.3 percent of the
innings pitched (267.1 of 603.1), 49.1 percent of
the strikeouts (216 of 440) and 53.7 percent of
the wins (22 of 41).
Of course, whoever Stanford turns to would
make up some of this production, and the
bumper crop of young players growing on the
Farm looks fully capable of keeping the Cardinal
competitive next season. And the
experienced players remaining on
the team just add more reasons for
optimism.
The infield looks to be in good
shape despite losing Phelps, Molina
and Castro. Rising sophomores
Zach Jones and Jake Schlander
played nearly every inning on the

left side of the infield and should
only improve both in the field and at
the plate with experience.
Schlander's defense at short drew
especially rave reviews as the season
went on. Other rising sophomores
who did not have as much experi
ence last season but look to be fix
tures in the infield include Ben
Clowe, who hit a monstrous home
run in the Cardinal's last-gasp effort
against Georgia in Omaha, Colin
Walsh and Jonathon Kaskow. Also
returning will be rising senior J.J.
Jelmini and rising junior Adam

Gaylord, who should provide lead
ership.
The outfield will be full of experi
ence with rising seniors Joey August
and Jeff Whitlow and rising junior
Toby Gerhart, all of whom are solid
fielders and capable of chipping in
quality at-bats. Junior Wande
Olabisi, who was primarily used as a
pinch-runner last season, can also
play in the outfield. Also emerging
to help out will be rising sopho
mores Dave Giuliani, Kellen
Kiilsgaard and Kellen McColl.
But perhaps most significant for

the continued health of the Cardinal
lineup is the return of rising senior
Brent Milleville. Milleville was a key
contributor down the stretch for
Stanford — as the team's most dan
gerous right-handed bat, he often hit
fourth in the lineup, protecting the
left-handed batting Castro. After
surprisingly going undrafted in June,
Milleville, and his .593 slugging per
centage, should give the Cardinal at
least one key cog for the heart of the
order next season, and could even
be called upon to catch more often
for the team in 2009.
The bullpen looks to be in good
shape, especially considering true
freshman Drew Storen's emergence
last season as the closer. If he stays
in a bullpen role as a sophomore, he
will be joined by rising senior Blake
Hancock, as well as several sopho
mores who played key roles as
freshmen last season: Michael
Marshall, Alex Pracher and Danny
Sandbrink.
Given Sandbrink's success in
the rotation in the postseason,
however, he could be lifted into the
starting rotation, where he would
join rising senior Jeffery Inman
(the only veteran starter on the
2009 roster). Max Feamow, also a
rising senior, struggled as a starter
last season but is one of most expe
rienced starling pitchers on the
team and should get a chance to
play a key role. Another candidate
for the rotation is rising sophomore
Cory Bannister (the younger
brother of Kansas City Royals
pitcher Brian Bannister).
Of course, there will be plenty
more opportunities for pitchers
both in the bullpen and in the rota
tion, especially with the condensed
schedule instituted last year that
gives more opportunities lor mid
week starters. Just like last season,
there should be a range of incoming
freshmen and sophomores with lim
ited experience emerging in relief
roles and getting opportunities to
start.
With this mix of upcoming play
ers and experienced upperclassmen,
Stanford should be able to stay com
petitive and avoid too much of a let
down after last season's great run.
And, because of the overall youth of
this team, the Cardinal has a real
chance to field an excellent squad in
2010.
