## Cardinal primed for explosive follow-up Key underclassmen ready to step into the limelight in '09 
### ERIK ADAMS STAFF WRITER 
Although the Cardinal's unexpected postsea
son run came to an end at the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. less than a month ago, it's
not too soon to start thinking about what the
club will look like next year. With the likely
departure of plenty of big contributors, there can
be little doubt that, for better or worse, big
changes will be afoot for Stanford baseball.
It is a fact in collegiate sports, where players
have at most four full years of eligibility, that

teams arc constantly in need of new talent to
move to the forefront when the established lead
ers graduate or move on to professional athletics.
And this need is especially great after a success
ful season fueled by a talented group of upper
classmen â€” as was the case with the Cardinal's
2008 season.
It is too early to know if every player drafted
last month will sign a professional contract
rather than return to the Farm, but if they all do,
the Cardinal will be without rising seniors Jason
Castro (C), Cord Phelps (2B), Sean Ratliff (CF),
Jeremy Bleich (LHP) and Austin Yount
(RHP/DH), in addition to graduated seniors
Brendan Doinaracki (OF), Randy Molina
(18/DH), Erik Davis (RHP), Rex Petrill (RHP)
and David Stringer (RHP). Castro, Yount and
Phelps have all already signed their first profes
sional contracts with the Houston Astros, Los

Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians, respec
tively.
To put the possible departure of these 10
players in perspective, they accounted for 56 per
cent of the team's hits (401 of 715), 51 percent of
the at bats (1220 of 2392), 68 percent of the home
runs (55 of 81), 59 percent of the total bases (673
of 1141), 55 percent of the runs (278 of 504) and
59 percent of the RBIs (278 of 470). From the
mound they represented 44.3 percent of the
innings pitched (267.1 of 603.1), 49.1 percent of
the strikeouts (216 of 440) and 53.7 percent of
the wins (22 of 41).
Of course, whoever Stanford turns to would
make up some of this production, and the
bumper crop of young players growing on the
Farm looks fully capable of keeping the Cardinal
