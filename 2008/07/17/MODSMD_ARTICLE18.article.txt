ITA Bank of the West Classic
makes big splash on Farm

The ITA Bank of the West Classic, now in
its 28th year, is the longest-running women's
professional tennis tournament in the world
and is the first stop of the U.S. Open Series.
And it all happens right here on the Farm.
Consisting of a 16-team doubles draw with
total prize money of $700,000, the Bank of the
West Classic is a well-established Bay Area
event. Taking place at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, Stanford will be serving up the best
in women's tennis with 33,000 expected to be
in attendance throughout the week, in addi
tion to extensive television coverage.
Competition began on Monday and is slated to
run through Sunday.
To cut to the chase, Serena Williams is here
— finally. The star who has withdrawn from
the Bank of the West Classic three times since
2003 pulled up a chair in a hospitality tent near
Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium on
Monday, appearing, frankly, exhausted.
Last night, Williams needed every ounce of
talent she had to avoid a near monumental
upset at the hands of a previously unknown
15-year-old challenger, Michelle Larcher de
Brito of Portugal, in the second round of the
Classic.
Larcher de Brito launched out to an early
lead against the fifth-ranked woman in the
world, as Williams committed eight unforced
errors in the initial 12 points, en route to an
eventual 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 match victory.
The past few weeks have not been free of
preoccupations and troubling thoughts for the
world's No. 5 player. Since losing to her sister,
Venus, in a dramatic Wimbledon final July 5,
Serena has barely had time to relax, let alone
reflect on her loss.
"Team tennis, no sleep and just working —
lots of tennis since Wimbledon," Williams said
in a press conference earlier this week.
Williams' hectic schedule won't end soon.
She will play next week's WTA tournament in
Carson before heading to Beijing for the
Olympics.
Williams will next take on the winner of
today's second round match between Russia's
Alisa Kleybanova and tournament fifth-seed
Patty Schnyder of Switzerland.

Gall named to baseball's Team
USA

Former Cardinal corner infielder John Gall
'00 was selected to represent the United States
at the Olympic Games in Beijing yesterday.
Gall will become the seventh Olympian asso
ciated with Stanford baseball, a list that also
includes current Cardinal head coach Mark
Marquess, who managed the 1988 Olympic
team on its way to a gold medal in Seoul,
South Korea.
Gall will make the trip to Beijing as an out
fielder. Currently with the Florida Marlins
organization, playing for Triple-A
Albuquerque, Gall is batting .321 this season
with 11 home runs. The former Stanford
standout is still eligible for the Olympic squad,
despite seeing limited action in the big leagues
with St. Louis in 2005 and 2006 and with
Florida in 2007. In 53 career major-league at
bats. Gall has hit .245 with a pair of homers.
On the Farm from 1997 to 2000, Gall
earned First-Team All Pac-10 Honors tiiree
times and earned high rankings on several
Stanford career leaderboards, statistically.
Gall ranks first overall in Stanford history for
career hits with 356, doubles with 80 and RBI
with 263. He also holds the third-best career
batting average (.358) and is tied for third all
time with 46 homers.
This will not be Gall's first time on the
international stage, either, as the former
Cardinal slugger played for the U.S. in the
summers of 1998 and 1999. He performed
admirably at that level as well, racking up
averages of .371 and .352 in those stints with

the national team, respectively.
Team USA missed the cut for the 2004
Olympics, having last competed in 2000 in
Sydney, where the squad took home the gold.
The Olympic baseball action this year in
Beijing is scheduled to run Aug. 13-23. The
competition in Beijing may be baseball's last
appearance on the Olympic stage, as the event
is currently slated to be dropped from the
games beginning in 2012.

Card helps U.S. to fourth
place finish at World Grand
Prix

Four current and former Stanford players
competed in the Federation Internationale de
Volleyball (FIVB) World Grand Prix final
round for the U.S. Women's National Team
last week, concluding the event with a fourth
place finish on Sunday. The team won two of
five finals matches to finish fourth, as one
might expect of the No. 4 team on the planet.
Stanford participants included rising
seniors Foluke Akinradewo and Cynthia
Barboza and alumnae Ogonna Nnamani '04
and Logan Tom '02. Playing in the final round,
the four were among the 12 players in action
for the U.S.
Tom led the U.S. with 11 kills and an ace in
a 25-19,25-19,25-23 loss to eventual champion
Brazil in the opening match. Additionally,
Nnamani totaled six kills off the bench and
Akinradewo chipped in a kill and an ace.
Team USA won its second match of the
finals, a suspenseful 26-28, 25-20, 22-25, 25-20,
15-11 victory over host Japan. Tom was again
a key contributor, tallying 14 kills, four blocks

and an ace. Nnamani, who played in the final
two sets, totaled seven kills with a single error
on 15 attacks, three blocks and three aces.
Team USA dropped a five-set match in dis
appointing fashion to Cuba in the next match,
22-25,17-25, 25-18, 25-21, 15-11. Akinradewo,
Tom and Nnamani started the match and Tom
tallied 15 points with 12 kills, two aces and a
block. Nnamani contributed 12 points (all on
kills) and 21 attacks with one error, while
Akinradewo added seven kills, two blocks and
an ace in her first start of the final round.
In the squad's penultimate match of the
finals, the U.S. lost to Italy, 25-17,26-28,25-19,
25-19. All four Stanford players started, and
Akinradewo and Nnamani tied for the U.S.
point lead with 18 each. Tom contributed 12
points with 11 kills and an ace and Barboza
added 13 kills of her own.
Entering the final match, the team rallied to
topple China 25-24, 25-19, 22-25, 21-25,17-15.
Tom delivered 17 kills on 39 swings and three
blocks for a total of 20 points. Akinradewo
contributed 10 kills on 20 attacks, while
Nnamani, who played in just the fifth set after
subbing in the first hour, produced six points
with five kills on eight errorless swings and an
ace.
Following the World Grand Prix, which
was used to evaluate potential members of the
Olympic squad, Team USA announced its ros
ter for Beijing yesterday. While neither of the
two current members of the Cardinal team,
Barboza and Akinradewo, made the cut,
Stanford will nevertheless be well represented
by Tom, Nnamani and Kerri Walsh '00.
The Stanford women's volleyball program
has now produced nine Olympians, making a
total of 14 appearances at the Summer Games.

Tom headlines the list of former Stanford
players on this year's squad, as she is set to
make her third straight Olympic appearance
as one of the team's most highly touted mem
bers.

Azzi inducted into Women's
Basketball Hall of Fame

Former Stanford star Jennifer Azzi '90 was
announced as one of six inductees to the
Women's Basketball Hall of Fame on
Monday. As the second former Stanford play
er to receive this honor, Azzi, a two-time Ail-
American and the catalyst of Stanford's first
national championship team in 1990, will offi
cially join the hall's ranks on June 19, 2009 in
Knoxville, Tenn.
Azzi, who was a senior on Stanford's first
national title winning team in 1990, remains
among the Cardinal's most revered women's
basketball players and is still highly regarded a
full 18 years following the conclusion of her
collegiate career. Azzi finished her four-year
career with the Cardinal with 1,634 points,
averaging 13.4 points per game. Additionally,
she racked up 191 three-pointers, and, most
significantly, left the Farm as the Cardinal's
all-time leader in career assists (751) and steals
ai\y
Azzi's achievements, however, do not stop
there. Azzi was also the first-ever Stanford
player to be named Wade Trophy National
Player of the Year, James Naismith National
Player of the Year, Honda-Broderick National
Player of the Year and Stanford's first Kodak
