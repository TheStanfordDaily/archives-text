## ART SCENE BIG EASY'S ART COMES TO CANTOR "Spared" artwork from Katrina brings return ted work & memories from 2005 
### PAUL CRAFT 
Cantor Art Center's spectacular summer exhibit,
"Spared from the Storm: Masterworks from the New
Orleans Museum of Art" is a welcome break from
work, the heat or Green Library. The campus art muse
um is always worth a trip, but this exhibit in particular
is worth your time.
The exhibition is, refreshingly, about breadth and
not depth. "Spared from the Storm" features a wide
range of artistic styles, nations and time periods. And it
is all killer and no filler: Nearly every painting will have
significance to even the most casual art fan. The roster
of artists is like a painting All-Star team: Claude
Monet, Auguste Renoir, Jackson Pollock, Pablo
Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe and more.
The exhibit features quite a few French painters
among its European collection, which is fitting given
New Orleans' strong French influence. A luxurious
portrait of King Louis XIV by Claude Lefevbre stares
you down upon arrival. There are several paintings by
impressionist painter Claude Monet, including his stun
ning 1893 painting "Snow at Giverny," in which he por
trays a snow-covered town using only white and neutral
colors. It's like playing a game of "Magic Eye" — the
harder you stare, the more you see. Another stand out
is Maurice de Vlaminck's fauvist landscape featuring a
bridge, river and trees painted in bright shocks of red
and white. Another eye-catcher: Pablo Picasso's piece,

"Combat between a Faun and a Centaur," a spare line
drawing that captures a fantasy scene.
The exhibition includes American influence as well,
featuring the unmistakable style of Jackson Pollock
and a typically pleasant desert landscape from Georgia
O'Keeffe. The collection also presents two paintings
with cross-cultural connections. The only American
Impressionist, Mary Cassatt painted glimpses into the
private lives of 19th-century women. Also, Edgar
Degas, the famous Frenchman, spent a short time in

New Orleans and painted a lovely
portrait of his blind cousin arrang
ing flowers.
Aside from the art itself,
"Spared from the Storm" is a cele
bration of New Orleans and its his
toric arts scene. This fact lends an
extra level of excitement and sor
row to the exhibit. The artwork is
historically housed in the New
Orleans Museum of Art, a former
cornerstone of the New Orleans
arts scene. Founded in 1910, the
impressive, classical-style museum

sustained serious damage from
Hurricane Katrina. As a result, a
portion of the museum's treasure
trove has landed here on campus.
The richness of the exhibit, then, is
not only a tribute to the history of
art, but also to the history of New
Orleans.
The collection boasts a total of
80 paintings, drawings and sculp
tures by influential artists dating
from the 17th to mid-20th cen
turies. The exhibition was orga
nized by the New Orleans Museum
of Art to benefit its Katrina
Recovery Fund and will be on dis
play at Cantor Arts Center through
Oct. 5.
