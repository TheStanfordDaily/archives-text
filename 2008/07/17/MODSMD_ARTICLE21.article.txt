# AT HIE MOVIES
## Streep delivers punch, sparkle to "Mamma Mia!" 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
If you're looking for a delightful romp through
girlhood, a fancifully fun summer film or a hit for
your ABBA addiction, "Mamma Mia" is the
movie for you.
Set in Greece and to the melodic tones of the
Swedish super-group ABBA, this cheerful chick
Hick is a charming piece for all ages. The film,
based on the hit Broadway musical, tells the
familiar story of a girl with three (possible)
fathers. She's getting married and needs someone
to give her away at the wedding, so she does the
only logical thing and invites all the possible
fathers. Who will she pick? The hilarity (and plot)
ensues.
Meryl Streep and the spontaneous Colin Firth
(cue the swooning) both give outstanding perfor
mances, paving the way in the all-around well
acted Hick. The male groom-to-be, played by
Dominic Cooper, has a tough time holding his
own against such seasoned actors, but his main
song sequence is pretty splendid.

The production values are top-notch, with gor
geous views of the Greek land and seascapes.
While there are no flashy explosions or sex
scenes, the film has a few well cut sequences, such

the movie is very
much ABBA. But it's
not a 'euv' movie."

as when Streep dreams for more "Money, Money,
Money." Fellas can pick up some advice on how
to (not) pick up a girl from "Does Your Mother
Know."
Since the film is adapted from a musical, the
songs take center stage. Luckily, the singing is
generally good, with the exception of Pierce

Brosnan, who
was likely picked
for the role more
for looks than
singing ability.
As for plot,

desire to put most of ABBA's music into one
piecc, it's pretty good. The film won't win any
awards for its scrcenplay, but the scenes, especial
ly those involving the Dynamos, Strecp's backup
singers and the Greek chorus (a group of inhabi
tants of the island), are very enjoyable. Some of
the flashbacks, especially how the "fathers"
looked and acted back in the day, are well
thought-out and especially funny.
The film is female-driven and empowering.
Streep's character illustrates that a woman can
operate a business herself, without a man's help.
