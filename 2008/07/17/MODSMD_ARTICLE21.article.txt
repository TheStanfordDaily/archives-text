# AT HIE MOVIES
## Streep delivers punch, sparkle to "Mamma Mia!" 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
If you're looking for a delightful romp through
girlhood, a fancifully fun summer film or a hit for
your ABBA addiction, "Mamma Mia" is the
movie for you.
Set in Greece and to the melodic tones of the
Swedish super-group ABBA, this cheerful chick
Hick is a charming piece for all ages. The film,
based on the hit Broadway musical, tells the
familiar story of a girl with three (possible)
fathers. She's getting married and needs someone
to give her away at the wedding, so she does the
only logical thing and invites all the possible
fathers. Who will she pick? The hilarity (and plot)
ensues.
Meryl Streep and the spontaneous Colin Firth
(cue the swooning) both give outstanding perfor
mances, paving the way in the all-around well
acted Hick. The male groom-to-be, played by
Dominic Cooper, has a tough time holding his
own against such seasoned actors, but his main
song sequence is pretty splendid.

The production values are top-notch, with gor
geous views of the Greek land and seascapes.
While there are no flashy explosions or sex
scenes, the film has a few well cut sequences, such

" I love ABBA — and
the movie is very
much ABBA. But it's
not a 'euv' movie."
o /

as when Streep dreams for more "Money, Money,
Money." Fellas can pick up some advice on how
to (not) pick up a girl from "Does Your Mother
Know."
Since the film is adapted from a musical, the
songs take center stage. Luckily, the singing is
generally good, with the exception of Pierce

Brosnan, who
was likely picked
for the role more
for looks than
singing ability.
As for plot,
for a storyline
conceived pri
marily from a

'Mamma Mia!'
Dir. Phyllida Lloyd

desire to put most of ABBA's music into one
piecc, it's pretty good. The film won't win any
awards for its scrcenplay, but the scenes, especial
ly those involving the Dynamos, Strecp's backup
singers and the Greek chorus (a group of inhabi
tants of the island), are very enjoyable. Some of
the flashbacks, especially how the "fathers"
looked and acted back in the day, are well
thought-out and especially funny.
The film is female-driven and empowering.
Streep's character illustrates that a woman can
operate a business herself, without a man's help.

ABBALICIOUS: Donna, played by Meryl Streep, jumps on her bed while rocking out with her backup singers and best friends the Dynamos in the new
movie musical "Mamma Mia." The film, adapted from the popular Broadway hit, features music from ABBA and is expected to draw crowds of girlfriends.
Her backup singers, the Dynamos,
are a little boy-crazy, but demon
strate that they very much care about
Streep and her family. Still, men,
don't despair — the movie doesn't
bash male-hood, but rather empha
sizes women and provides for some
innocent, decent fun that is a refresh
ing departure from many other por
trayals of women in the media mar
ketplace today.
The film is true to its word about
being "Greek." No, there isn't much
Greek spoken (although if you're not
familiar with ABBA, then this movie
might be Greek to you), but the film
tips its hat to Ancient Greek drama.
One might imagine that a film featur
ing the work of a '70s-era disco
superpower might shy away from
dramatic tradition, but oddly enough
there a few aspects that stay true to
its theatrical roots. The action, much
like in the ancient works, takes place
in less than 24 hours. There arc inces
tuous overtones in one dialog with
the daughter and a possible father

which are gross enough to make one
conjure up images of Oedipus.
Perhaps most importantly, the
film makes use of a chorus consisting
of residents of the island on which
the action occurs. The chorus in
Greek theater was made up of citi
zens of the polis who were essential
ly observers and commentators of
the action being preformed on stage.
Sophocles even utilized the chorus to
express moral and social attitudes,
especially those from the gods. The
fact that the chorus is used in
"Mamma Mia" to not only sing back
up, but also to comment, observe and
provide some cues to the actors'
emotions is highly reminiscent of the
Greek traditions. The fact that the
chorus is seen late in the film as gods
in the sky, with one even holding
Poseidon's Trident, cements this con
nection.
Mamma Mia is an excellent movie
to see with a date, and especially
great for a girls' night out. I love
ABBA —and the film is very much
about ABBA. But it is not a "guy"
movie. Be sure to stay till the end of
the film to see some flashy end-credit
gems sure to get you up and dancing.
