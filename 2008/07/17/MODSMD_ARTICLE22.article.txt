## Beck strays far from home with "Modern Guilt" 
### NEIL LAKIN 
II you don't like Beck, then "Modern Guilt"
may be the Beck album for you. Even for an artist
who's built a career out of reinventing himself,
this represents a significant departure. Gone (for
the most part) are the endearingly improvised
beats, the goofy lyrics and the odd white-bread
rap tracks; Beck has gotten serious since his last
outing, and so has his production quality.
Dropping The Dust Brothers, the production
duo that gave us Odelay and Guero, Beck picked
up DJ/producer Danger Mouse for "Guilt." This
should have been a perfect match. Beck defies

genre categorization; an album will run from
blues and rock to Brazilian tropicalia to syrupy,
slide-guitar country ballad. Danger Mouse is just
as hard to classify; the common thread connecting
his work with Jemini, Gorillaz and Gnarls
Barkley is that it's uniformly excellent. As you'd
expect from such collaboration, no two songs on
"Guilt" sound the same. U-fortunately, the pro
ject misfires; the result is an album that doesn't
sound like Beck.
Beck's trademark sense of humor seems to
have been lost in the shuffle. It's hard to believe
that this is the same guy whose first hit featured
the refrain: "Soy un perdador/I'm a loser, baby/So

why don't you kill me." His songwriting has
moved onto more serious topics, like modern
alienation, environmental devastation and ciga
rettes. Sometimes, it doesn't work. A few tracks
sound like Beck raided Radiohead's cutting room
floor.
On "Replica," you could easily swap Beck's
voice with something by Thom Yorke, without
anything sounding out of place. The same goes for
"Chemtrails" and, to a lesser extent, "Youthless."
Still, his lyrics aren't any more coherent or even
syntactically correct than his other
albums; even with some heavy sub
ject matter, trying to make sense of
the words can still be like looking for
philosophy in a fortune cookie. If
you're looking for something to put
on your Facebook profile, pick up
another album (or try reading).
At the same time, there are a few
gems. The opening track, "Orphans,"
shows off the Danger Mouse touch,

with oh-so-subtle backing vocals and
judiciously placcd electronic noise
anchored by a loping acoustic guitar
line. This slides into "Gamma Ray,"
which features stripped-down drums
and bass, a four-chord surf-rock gui
tar line and just enough electronic
embellishments to remind you that
Danger Mouse is in the production
booth. Danger Mouse gets his fea
ture on "Walls"; a smooth slide-gui
tar-and-string-section sample is
matched to a snare-heavy drum beat
for a contrasting effect so nice you
almost wish he'd saved it for his next
Jemini collaboration, instead of wast
ing it on Beck. The album wraps up
with a few nods to his old work; the

grungy guitar line on "Soul of a
Man" wouldn't be out of place on
"Mellow Gold," and the closer,
"Volcano," with choral and string
backings, sounds like a lost track
from "Mutations."
If you're a Beck fan, you're prob
ably going to buy or steal this regard
less of how it's reviewed. If you've
never listened to Beck before, or you
have and you didn't like it, pick up
this album. It doesn't sound like his
other work, but even a mediocre
Beck album is better than most stuff
out there.
