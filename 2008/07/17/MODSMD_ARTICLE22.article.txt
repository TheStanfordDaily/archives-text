## Beck strays far from home with "Modern Guilt" 
### NEIL LAKIN 
II you don't like Beck, then "Modern Guilt"
may be the Beck album for you. Even for an artist
who's built a career out of reinventing himself,
this represents a significant departure. Gone (for
the most part) are the endearingly improvised
beats, the goofy lyrics and the odd white-bread
rap tracks; Beck has gotten serious since his last
outing, and so has his production quality.
Dropping The Dust Brothers, the production
duo that gave us Odelay and Guero, Beck picked
up DJ/producer Danger Mouse for "Guilt." This
should have been a perfect match. Beck defies

genre categorization; an album will run from
blues and rock to Brazilian tropicalia to syrupy,
slide-guitar country ballad. Danger Mouse is just
as hard to classify; the common thread connecting
his work with Jemini, Gorillaz and Gnarls
Barkley is that it's uniformly excellent. As you'd
expect from such collaboration, no two songs on
"Guilt" sound the same. U-fortunately, the pro
ject misfires; the result is an album that doesn't
sound like Beck.
Beck's trademark sense of humor seems to
have been lost in the shuffle. It's hard to believe
that this is the same guy whose first hit featured
the refrain: "Soy un perdador/I'm a loser, baby/So

why don't you kill me." His songwriting has
moved onto more serious topics, like modern
alienation, environmental devastation and ciga
rettes. Sometimes, it doesn't work. A few tracks
sound like Beck raided Radiohead's cutting room
floor.
On "Replica," you could easily swap Beck's
voice with something by Thom Yorke, without
anything sounding out of place. The same goes for
"Chemtrails" and, to a lesser extent, "Youthless."
Still, his lyrics aren't any more coherent or even
