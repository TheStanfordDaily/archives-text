# CAMPUS HAPPENINGS
## Midsummer Dance a look ahead to ball in February 
### LISA WALLACE DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Stanford community members
have come to associate many activi
ties with breezy, laid-back midsum
mer evenings on The Farm: running
campus drive, Frisbee in the Oval, a
warm cup of coffee at the newly
reopened CoHo. But as the sun set
gracefully over campus last Saturday,
students, staff and friends alike
joined in on a new scene: social
dance.
The Viennese Ball Opening
Committee, which organizes the
opening dances of the Viennese Ball,
held its first-ever summer event last
weekend, the Midsummer's Dance.
Featuring an evening of social dance,
the event kicked off with an introduc
tory lesson in the committee's spe
cialty, the Viennese Waltz.
"There isn't a lot of dance in the
summer," said Brendon Wells '08,
Viennese Ball treasurer and one of
the event organizers. "We wanted to
have a dance ... have some fun.
There is a huge social dance commu
nity at Stanford."
Aspiring dancers of all experience
levels flocked to the Havana Room
of the Graduate Community Center
for an evening of good dancing and
good fun. Dancers donned every
thing from heels and cocktail dresses
to casual cargo shirts and goofy socks.
The cool music and energetic dance
steps kept everyone happy — the
committee managed to keep even the
shiest laughing and the most experi
enced occupied throughout the entire
night.
Aside from hosting a unique social
event, though, organizers saw the
Midsummer's Dance as an opportu
nity to spread the word about their
main event — the annual ball.
"We wanted to let people know
early that [the ball] is coming, and it's
big and a lot of fun," said Elyse Hope
'10, an Opening Committee member
and one of the choreographers of this
year's performance.
"This lesson was a way to get peo
ple excited about dance," said Jessie
Humphreys '08, who has previously
performed at the ball.
The Viennese Ball Opening
Committee performs only one event
during the academic year, but they
keep busy throughout. Auditions are
usually held during the second week
of school, and from then until
February dancers can expect to be
practicing about four to five hours a
week.
"What's great about the opening
group is that to be chosen, you don't
have to be the best dancer,"
Humphreys added. "You can have a
great performance style, learn quick
ly and just really love to waltz."
Though the Midsummer's Dance
is new to the Stanford social scene,
the annual ball is not. The ball was
started in 1977 by Stanford students
who studied abroad in Austria.
During their travels, they were
exposed to the Viennese tradition of
a Mardi Gras-esque celebration pre
ceding Lent.
At the Stanford version of the
Viennese Ball, live social dance per
formance is the main entertainment,
kicked off by a group of dancers
from the Viennese Ball Opening
Committee. Every year they per
form both a waltz as well as a polka
number to start off the festivities.
Nowadays, the event is a well-loved
Stanford tradition; the Viennese Ball
usually attracts from 800 to 10(X) stu
dents and members of the general
public. This coming year's 32nd
annual ball will be held in February.
After last weekend's successful
turnout, the choreographers and
organizers are looking into planning
more opportunities for social dance
during the summer. Come fall,
dancers of all experience levels are
encouraged to consider auditioning
for the Opening Committee.
