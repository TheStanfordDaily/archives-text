## BUSINESS SCHOOL Shao released after decade of imprisonment Jude Shao '93 on parole after Chinese legal battle 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a decade-long imprisonment in
China, Graduate School of Business alumnus
Jude Shao MBA '93 was freed on parole
early this month, ending of efforts by
his business school classmates to reverse his
wrongful conviction.
Shao's release came after repeated denials
of parole, which he became eligible for in
2006. Those involved in petitioning on Shao's
behalf were taken aback at the abruptness of
his release.

"First it was disbelief, just because the
notification came in an email from Jude say
ing he was at his sister's," said Chuck
Hoover MBA '93, who was heavily involved
in petitioning for the release of his former
classmate. "There was no warning that this
was going to happen. Obviously, we are real
ly excited for Jude. It took way too long for
him to be released."
Shao's release came a day after Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice ended a visit to
Beijing. Rice, along with President Bush and
dozens of members of Congress, has inter
vened with the Chinese government on
Shao's behalf.
A U.S. citizen who founded an American
medical equipment exporting company in
China, Shao was arrested in Shanghai in 1998
on allegations of tax evasion. During a visit

from tax auditors, Shao refused to offer a
bribe in order to halt a government investi
gation of his company, according to his sup
porters. He was tried and convicted the fol
lowing year, but was not allowed to meet
with his attorney or review the evidence
against him.
Following his conviction, Shao's former
business school classmates reviewed the
accounting records of his company, China
Business Ventures, and found that he was
innocent. In April 2003, six legal scholars
from China's People's University found that
Shao deserved a retrial, but despite repeated
appeals, Chinese courts refused to review the
evidence in the case.
Shao's classmates and friends never gave
up, though.
At their 15-year reunion this past May,

Shao's classmates wrote letters on his behalf,
urging Rice to make his case a priority during
her visit to Beijing.
Still, those who helped Shao will not have
the chance to reunite with him anytime soon.
Under the conditions of his parole, Shao can
not talk with foreigners without police con
sent and will not be allowed to leave
Shanghai until May 2013.
But those who worked to free their friend
and former classmate are pleased that he will
be able to move on. During his decade-long
incarceration, Shao learned that his father
passed away and that his wife divorced him.
"1 would tell him how happy we are for
him, that he got out, and that we really can't
wait to see him," Hoover said.
