## Univ. gains access to collection of Iraqi documents 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Records from Saddam
Hussein's Iraqi government have
made their way to Stanford's
Hoover Institution for safekeep
ing.
The documents are from the
Baath party in Iraq, which ruled
the country prior to its overthrow
in 2003. The agreement to store the
documents at Hoover was reached
with the Iraq Memory Foundation,
an American-based organization
that collected the documents after
the American invasion.
At Hoover, cataloguing efforts
are set to begin shortly, and the
first documents should become

available to scholars
in upcoming
months.
The records —
from the Baath
Regional Command,
the headquarters of
the Baath Arab
Socialist Party and
the Special Security
Agency — number
in the millions.
"It will take
some time to cata
logue them," said
Hoover's Senior
Associate Director
Richard Sousa. "We
are going to open
them sequentially."
As part of the
terms of the agree-

merit to store the
documents, the Hoover archives
have been provided digitized
copies of all of the papers. These
copies will remain on campus after
the original documents are
returned to Iraq, making the
papers a permanent fixture of the
collections. According to Sousa,
scholars will not be able to access
the original documents, which will
be held at an undisclosed location.
Sousa said he expects interna
tional attention for the papers
because of their historic value, and
Stanford faculty have already
noted the papers' importance.
"They would be the most
important window into the work
ings of the Saddam regime," said

great benefit for the study of
Saddam's form of despotism. It's a
truly incredibly treasure trove of
information."

OF IRANIAN STUDIES

Scholars in the field will also
benefit from the detail of the
records, including those related to
ethnic cleansing.
"The regime was remarkably
bureaucratic," Political Science
Prof. James Fearon said. "(They
kept] a huge amount of records on
who they were torturing and
putting in jail."
Still, many records were not
saved, according to Williamson
Evers, a research fellow on leave
from Hoover and a senior official

in the Bush administration who
spent time doing reconstruction
work in Iraq following the
American invasion.
"The whole central records of
the Ministry of Education were
destroyed, 100 percent," Evers
said.
The papers still provide, howev
er, information about a historically
shrouded regime.
"It's a secretive party," Evers
added. "We don't know much
about their inner workings."
The records have been the
source of some controversy
because of the decision to move
them outside of Iraq, and the Iraq
National Library and Archive as
well as domestic critics have urged
for their return. Hoover has agreed
to house the documents for five
years, and, as Sousa emphasized,
has not taken ownership of the
papers.
"The originals are on loan and
we're planning to return them,"
Sousa said. "That's what archivists
do."
While the originals will be
returned, scholars at Stanford will
have continued access to a crucial
look inside Iraqi history.
"For anyone who wants to study
how Saddam Hussein's regime
worked, this will be a necessary
stop," Fearson said. "It will form
the basis of our future understand
ing."
