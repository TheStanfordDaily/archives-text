## Dish flagged for high fire hazard Second red-flag warning sign of early start to fire season 
### MILES OSGOOD 
Extreme fire danger sparked the summer's
second red-Hag warning last Wednesday, closing
the Dish area and surrounding foothills for the
day. Drought conditions and scorching heat
in the area have started the fire season
remarkably early this year, leaving city and
University officials sweating.
"In my 35 years in the fire service, I can't
recall the fire conditions being this severe
this early in the season," said Palo Alto Fire
Chief Nick Marinaro.
In a given year, the Dish area gets about
five red flags, but this year's two warnings
before August have put the hills on pace to
soon surpass that benchmark. The National

Weather Bureau administers the red flag
based on temperature, wind speed, fuel mois
ture, relative humidity and burn index — a
qualitative measure of burn severity.
According to Marinaro, Palo Alto is see
ing September and October conditions in
May and June, one reason being the lack of
spring rain that normally keeps the live grass,
or "fuel" as many refer to it, wetter for
longer.
The Stanford Department of Public Safety
has responded to the danger by limiting the
fire potential of grass in the hills surrounding
the Dish.
"We have the foothills manned during
daylight hours," Dish Ranger Doug Williams
said. "[The staff] is busy mowing, dicing and
grazing to reduce fuel."
Officials are hoping to avoid a situation
similar to that of last year's blaze, in which a
fire started by two juveniles destroyed almost
200 acres in the Stanford foothills. Although
Santa Clara County — which holds jurisdic

tion over fires on Stanford properly — con
tained the fire, large sections of the hills were
charred and smoke descended onto campus.
Marinaro said there are several online
resources for conccrned students and local
residents to learn more about fire threats.
The National Weather Service Web site sup
plies fire-threat updates and the Palo Alto
Fire Department site boasts a live webcam
that continually scans the foothills from Fire
Station 8.
For now, the foothills remain free of fire
and the Dish trail is again open from 6 a.m.
to 8 p.m. But while the fires that have raged
throughout much of northern California have
yet to converge on the San Francisco
Peninsula, the summer will only get hotter,
and Palo Alto's fire chief remains unsure
about what August and September will bring.
"We're keeping our fingers crossed,"
Marinaro said.
