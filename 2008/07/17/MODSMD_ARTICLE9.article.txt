Staff at Stanford's Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve — normally a
refuge for native plants and animals
— were surprised to find a certain
plant growing on the land last month:
marijuana. The San Mateo County
Narcotics Task Force was soon called
in to destroy the 2,900 baby pot
plants, part of one of Stanford's most
unexpected pot busts.

The plants [...]
could have
been worth
between $1.5
and 2 million
on the street.

The 1,189-acre Biological
Preserve, located southwest of
Stanford's campus, allows visitors in
the park hut is fenced to keep out
unwanted company. Employees
became suspicious after noticing sev
eral cuts in the fencing and, upon fur
ther investigation, discovered on
June 12 what appeared to be a field
of marijuana. They immediately con
tacted the police.
The police received a search war
rant for the preserve and raided the
suspected crops on June 25, confirm
ing that the suspicious plants were,
indeed, pot.
They "went in and eradicated the
plants," said Lieutenant Mark Wyss,
commander of the task force. "[They]
seized the plants as well as the equip
ment."
Members of the California
Highway Patrol, assisted by a heli
copter, accompanied the task force as
they removed both plants and their
caretakers' supplies.
Although all of the plants were
small and easy to pull by hand, they
could have been worth between $1.5
and 2 million on the street if they had
reached maturity.
Police are hoping that some of the
equipment they discovered will yield
evidence and provide information on
potential suspects, although currently
there are no suspects. The county
crime lab is currently in the process of
examining the evidence.
"It's an open investigation at this
point," Wyss noted.
According to Philippe Cohen,
administrative director of Jasper
Ridge, the preserve has only had
"small and limited" incidences in the
past. In recent years, there have been
no official reports of marijuana grow
ing on campus, though there have
been arrests for marijuana possession.
San Mateo County, however, is
an entirely different breeding
ground.
"We are in the height of marijua
na season," Wyss said. "We average
between six and a dozen farms [in
San Mateo County each year]."
The discovery of marijuana grow
ing in one of Stanford's outdoor
classrooms has introduced a need for
increased security.
"We'll be upgrading our fencing
along a substantial part of the pre
serve," Cohen said. "We'll be
extending our trails [to allow greater
surveillance by employees]."
