SLAC to get a new
name

The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) will be getting a new name due to a
trademark disagreement between the
University and the U.S. Department of Energy,
according to the Stanford Report.
When the Energy Department tried to file a
trademark and copyright application for the
center's name last year, Stanford officials
objected, saying that the University owns the
rights to the name "Stanford."
Energy Department officials maintain that
the name change is occurring because of the
center's new emphasis on photon science and
particle astrophysics.
Now, the Energy Department is scrambling to
come up with a new name for the center. A SLAC
committee is working on names to suggest to the
Energy Department. Some advocate simply
renaming the center SLAC, with the initials no
longer standing for anything, a solution reached
with names like SRI International and the SAT.
Other suggestions include naming the center
after its founder and first director Wolfgang
"Pief Panofsky, calling it the Jasper Ridge or

Silicon Valley National Laboratory, or coming
up with a different name that could still be
abbreviated as SLAC.
While the new name will most likely not
include the name "Stanford," the University
will continue to run the center.

Alum nominated for
$100,000 award

Kjerstin Erickson '05, founder of the non
profit African teaching organization FORGE,
has been named a finalist for the "Do
Something Award," a $100,000 prize given to a
young person who has done something to
change the world. The winner will be
announced at Fox's Teen Choice Awards in
Hollywood on Aug. 4.
Erickson told The San Jose Mercury News
that she was shocked by the awards show invite,
comparing it to something in a gossip magazine.
Rubbing shoulders with celebrities like
Miley Cyrus and walking down the red carpet is
not a regular part of Erickson's life.
As Executive Director of FORGE, which
teaches African refugees skills so that they can
rebuild their countries, Erickson has been living
and working in refugee camps in places like
Botswana and Zambia. She even got married at
a refugee camp in Africa to FORGE board
president Nick Talarico.
Erickson applied for the award to help
fundraise for FORGE, which she turned over to
refugees to run last year.
