## Program protects leatherback turtles 
### EMMA MARTIN DAILY VISITING INTERN 
The fight to save the endangered
leatherback turtle is on, and biology
Ph.D. candidate George Shillinger
M.S. '97 has made the first move. By
leading the first major tracking of the
turtles, he has shed light on their
migration patterns, which could aid
conservation efforts.

Shillinger and his team marked 46
female leatherbacks from 2004 to
2007, coordinating with the Tagging of
Pacific Predators (TOPP) program.
"The idea with TOPP is to conduct
a massive deployment of electronic
tags of marine predators in the North
Pacific over a course of three to four
years," said Daniel Palacios of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. "We want to see how
each of the species integrates the envi
ronment with their life histories and
reacts to seasonal changes, like El
Nino."
The turtles are tracked by satellite
with what is "perhaps the most sophis
ticated device put on an animal in the
sea," said Marine Sciences Prof.
Barbara Block, chief scientist for the
TOPP project.
The results showed that the giant
turtles swam a distance of around
B,(XX) kilometers to reach the South
Pacific Gyre from their nesting
grounds at Playa Grande beach in
Costa Rica, according to Palacios. It is
unclear why the turtles swam so deter
minedly to this desolate area.
Shillinger called the Gyre an "oceanic
desert."
To encourage protection of the
leatherbacks, Shillinger helped found
the Great Turtle Race, an educational
program that works in conjunction
with TOPP to raise awareness of the
plight of the turtles. Based on the tag
ging information found by the TOPP
team, the migrating turtles of the sea
son "race" to reach their final destina
tion. The public can follow the turtles'
progress on the interactive Great
Turtle Race Web site.
Shillinger described the Great
Turtle Race as an opportunity to get
people engaged and excited using

social networking.
"It's a charity organization with a
conservation underpinning," he said.
Dangers along beaches and in the
deep sea have affected the
leatherback population in the Pacific.
"Leatherbacks can easily mistake a
plastic bag for a jellyfish," Shillinger
added.
Palacios pointed out that another
danger to the turtles is egg harvesting
by humans. However, egg harvesting
has diminished in the last few years,
thanks to the work of Leatherback
Trust, a conservation group founded
by James Spotlia that works to raise
awareness among the human popula
tion to not eat the eggs.
Yet another threat to the turtles is
found in the high seas — longline fish
ing hooks can accidentally snag the
giant turtles while the fisherman try to
catch other species of fish. To avoid
losing a hook, fishermen typically cut
off the turtle flipper where the hook
has caught. The leatherback has little
chance of survival after losing a flip
per.
"Longline fishery has been partic
ularly bad for leatherback turtles in
the eastern Pacific," Palacios said.
The largest remaining colony of
leatherbacks in the world has now
come to Playa Grande to nest.
"If you can't protect them right out
of the gate — Playa Grande is the last
stand for the species — that is a con
cern," Shillinger said.
He hopes that citizens will pressure
their governments to produce political
will to help protect the leatherbacks.
According to Shillinger, scientific data
needs to be coupled with economic
resources and political determination
to see the revival of the Pacific preda
tor.
"I'm an optimist," Shillinger said.
"People really want to see data put
into change."
Palacios agreed.
"Turtles are in a critical position,"
he said. "But if something is done
quickly, they can be saved. We need to
act soon."
