# Q & A
## In discussion with the "Iran expert" Visiting Prof. of Political Science Abbas Milani 
### DEVIN BANERJEE NEWS EDITOR 
President Bush recently authorized William Burns, the under
secretary of state for political affairs, to attend a meeting in
Geneva on Iran's nuclear program. The meeting, which was
held Saturday, produced no developments after Iran
responded with a written document failing to address inter
national demands.

In Geneva, officials from six negotiating
partners — the U.S., France, Britain.
Germany, Russia and China — pressed Iran
to accept a "freeze-for-freeze" proposal,
under which Iran would cease enriching ura
nium, and the U.S. and other powers would
not demand additional international sanc
tions against Iran. After Iranian officials
failed to address the nuclear concerns at the
meeting, the six nations gave Iran two weeks
to formally respond to the proposal before it
would be withdrawn.
To discuss the Geneva meeting, foreign
policies and the future of Iran, The Stanford
Weekly spoke with Visiting Prof, of Political
Science Abbas Milani, frequently referred
to by The New York Times as an "Iran
expert." Professor Milani currently serves as
director of Stanford's Iranian Studies pro
gram and as a research fellow and co-direc
tor of the Iran Democracy Project at the
Hoover Institution.
The Stanford Weekly: In the past, Bush
administration officials have said they will
not negotiate with Iran until Iran suspends its
uranium enrichment program. Why, then,
was William Burns sent to Geneva?
Abbas Milani: Well, first of all, they tried
to pretend like they haven't changed their
position by insisting that Burns was there
not to negotiate, but to participate, and that
he did not actually engage directly with the
Iranians, but sat there silently, watching.
But I think it is a change, in fact, and the
reality is that the demand was not that rea
sonable a demand to begin with. Suspension
of the enrichment is what the fight is about,
and you can't demand the other side to give
you what you want to negotiate about. It's a
very unusual demand to make, because the
ultimate goal of the negotiations, by every
account, would be suspension and some
thing else, so to demand that Iran should do
the only thing that it has up its sleeve as a
precondition of negotiation doesn't leave
much for them to negotiate with.
SW.- Would you say, as John Bolton told
The New York Times on Tuesday, that the
Bush administration is "desperate to sign

deals" in its final year?
AM: Not at all. 1 think John Bolton is
desperate to attack the Bush administration
for any sign of reason that they show in their
foreign policy. His diatribes against the
Bush administration on both the North
Korean and Iranian issues, 1 think, are more
the result of his ideology than of any clear
observance of reality as reality is. In his
world of neoconservative ideology, he can
do and he can surmise and he can order
what he wants, but in the world of diploma
cy, you have to work with reality, not with
the mandates of ideology. Work with reality,
and the world looks different.
SW: Iran presented a nonpaper in Geneva
that ignored the uranium enrichment con
cerns of the six countries sitting at the other
side of the table, and was subsequently given
two weeks to accept the freeze-for-freeze pro
posal. To your knowledge and opinion, what
is Iran's play here? What do you see happen
ing at the end of the two weeks?
AM: I think Iran's strategy is two-fold.
One is to look like they are conciliatory, to
look like they are open to a diplomatic solu
tion. This way, their allies — that is, China
and Russia — can then argue for a continu
ation of the diplomatic path. China and
Russia can continue to argue that harsher
methods and harsher embargos — harsher
punishments — are unnecessary, and that
the current, promising diplomatic path is the
one to continue. That's one goal they have.
The other goal is to prolong the negotia
tions in order to create reality on the
ground. The more they prolong the negotia
tions, the more centrifuges will be running,
the more they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it will be to
turn back the clock. Their strategy is very, I
think, clear, and they have been doing this
for a long, long time, and they have become
very good at it — at pursuing this concur
rent strategy and using creative ambiguity to
delay and obfuscate and confuse and, ulti
mately, buy time.

SW: Two ideas were tossed about in the
L.A. Times earlier this week. One says that

Iran may now have a strong incentive to con
tinue delaying negotiations due to an appar
ent pattern of recent U.S. concessions. The
other says that Iran may bite at the freeze-for
freeze proposal because it believes it can
squeeze more out of Bush in his final months
than out of a new U.S. president. Is either of
these valid?
AM: I don't think so. In terms of the elec
tion, what I think did play a role might well
have been Obama's speech at AIPAC. It
was clear, in my view, that they were hoping
that maybe an Obama presidency would be
more lenient toward them. That speech
made it very clear that, on the nuclear issue,
Obama is as tough as anybody else is going
to be. In some ways, his talk at AIPAC was
every bit as tough as anything Bush has ever
said on Iran. So I think the idea of delaying
this until the election and finding out who is
in power so they might get a better deal is
much less of a concern to them, because
they now have realized that either Obama
or McCain, both of them, will be rather
tough on this.
The thing that one also has to realize is,
for them, I think the most important recent
turn of events has been the change in the
tone of the British. The British have become
much tougher, and the British have openly
suggested that they will put oil and gas on
the list of embargoed commodities. And the
regime knows that if oil and gas are part of
the embargo, then if they can't sell oil and
gas — if there's a big if — then they are in
deep trouble. In Britain now, talks are as
tough on these things as in the Bush admin
istration.
SW: Why has Britain's policy changed?
AM: I think it has to do with the fact that
the British have realized the regime in Iran
is going to be a threat for the region. This
precedes this regime — if you go back to the
'60s and '70s when Iran was run by the Shah,
the British had a tendency to side with the
Arab stales of the Persian Gulf: Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Yemen. The British have a long
history of close relations with these coun
tries, and they have protected these coun
tries essentially from Iran's bullying in the
past, and now they have realized that the
Arabs in the Persian Gulf are very con
cerned about Iran's rise as a predominant
force in the region. And if that [rise] is
accompanied by nuclear power, then the
Arab states of the Persian Gulf, which are
all Arab and predominantly Sunni, have
serious concerns.

SW: A third idea from the LA. Times
says that Iran is simply looking for a promise

that the U.S. will not topple Iran's govern
ment.
AM: This talk has been around for a long
time — this idea that the U.S. has to some
how say it is not going to engage in a regime
change, and the regime, in turn, will budge.
First of all, 1 think that game was at one time
the regime's game, but I think they now
think they are in a better position.
That's no longer just what they want.
They think the U.S. is in deep trouble in Iraq
and Afghanistan. They think the U.S.
doesn't have the military capacity to take on
another war. They think the U.S. economy is
in trouble. They think they are in a much
better position than they were four years
ago, when that offer would have been a very
appealing offer to them. Now I think they
want more. Whether they will budge is an
open question. If I were to guess today, 1
would say they are not going to budge.
Recent news coming out of Iran is not very
promising.
SW: Two weeks ago, Iran test-fired a mis
sile with the range to strike Israel.
Condoleezza Rice immediately said the U.S.
is committed to Israel's defense. What do the
missile tests mean for Israel, America and the
Middle East?
AM: One approach that is supported by
Ahmadinejad and a considerable portion of
the Revolutionary Guard commanders is
that the only way to get anything from the
West is if you go tit for tat, if you don't back
down. They have a very sort of street-fight
er mentality. If you throw a punch, they
throw a bigger punch. If you give an inch,
they will want three inches.
When the Israeli Air Force had an exer
cise over the seas near Greece — a distance
almost exactly equal to the distance from
Israel to Iran — the Israeli papers made it
very clear that this was a test-run for a pos
sible attack on Iran. Iran wanted to throw
back a punch. And there are elements, [for
whom] Ahmadinejad is sort of a spokesper
son, who want to be provocative. They want
to be provocative partly for the reason I just
said — they think that's the way you get the
West to back down. You don't conciliate,
you confront.
But there's also another reason why the
Ahmadinejads in Iran propose a confronta
tional attitude, and that is, lor them, the con
frontational attitude is a win-win situation.
If the West backs down, they have won. If
the West doesn't back down and the nega
tive confrontation does happen, they still
have won, because this faction in Iran does
not mind a military attack on Iran. They
know that if such an attack comes, they will
be in constant power and have a con
solidated hold on power.
SW: So am I correct to say that
you believe Iran's nuclear program is
not for civilian electricity needs — as
Iranian officials claim — hut for
building weapons?
AM: I think, for sure, that they
want to be a kind of de-facto nuclear
power, like Japan, where they have
the capacity, and the world knows
they have the capacity, but they
don't take the next step and develop
the bomb. That's the minimum.
They might take the next step and
develop the bomb itself.
If they get attacked, 1 can guaran
tee you that they will openly declare
that they will pursue the bomb. If
they don't, then they might, within a
couple of years, be there, where they
have the capacity to enrich uranium
in a form sufficient for weapons. You
know, the idea that they are pursuing

this just for the notion that this is
modern scicnce, that they should be
allowed to pursue modern science, is
just too, 1 think, absurd.
SW: The Bush administration is
reportedly considering an American
diplomatic presence in Iran, in the
form of so-called "interests sections"
where American diplomats could
issue visas to Iranians wishing to trav
el to the States. Of course, the U.S. has
not had any diplomatic presence in
the country since the Revolution in
'79. What impact would a renewed
presence have on U.S.-Iran relations?
AM: 1, with Mike McFaul and
Larry Diamond, suggested some
thing along these lines four years
ago. We wrote at the time that there
should be such a diplomatic pres
ence, and we also wrote what we
thought would be the consequence.
One consequence would be that
there would be enormous conver
gence on the embassy for visas. That
would be a very potent metaphor
and symbol of the people's dis
gruntlement with the regime. There
would be lines along the block,
because right now people travel to

"The more they [Iran] prolong
the negotiations... the more
they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it
will be to turn back the clock."

Dubai, to Turkey, to Pakistan, to
Europe, to get these visas.
The other consequence is that, if
the U.S. has diplomats on the ground
there, the U.S. government can have
a better sense of what's happening in
the country. Right now they're
shooting in the dark. Right now
they're at the mercy of some expatri
ates who have a political axe to
grind, or they're at the mercy of jour
nalists who often have very little

experience with Iran, or at the mercy
of, what had been until a few years
ago, a dwindling number of pro
grams for the study of Iran. Stanford
lias changed that with its Iranian
Studies program, and a couple of
other universities have done the
same, but if you look at academic
institutions a year before September
11, the incredible thing is that there
are a smaller number of centers
teaching Persian or Iranian studies.

SW: What caused this pre-9/11
shortage of centers teaching Iranian
studies?
AM: The shortage was, I think,
partly the result of the hostage crisis.
People were just fed up with the
Iranians. But for a country like the
U.S., with as much political, eco
nomic and global interest, you can't
get peeved at a country and stop
studying it because you're mad at it.
And right now, that country is Iran
— a central player in the Persian
Gulf and a central player in the
Muslim world. You can't just,
because you're mad at it, stop study
ing it. The reverse should have hap
pened. There should have been dou
ble the number of centers teaching
Iranian studies as there were before
September 11.
September 11 finally convinced
the powers-that-be here that you
need to study Islam, you need to
study Iran, you need to study the
Persian language, the culture, if you
are to understand who these people
are and what makes them tick.

and Russia — can then argue for a continu
ation of the diplomatic path. China and
Russia can continue to argue that harsher
methods and harsher embargos — harsher
punishments — are unnecessary, and that
the current, promising diplomatic path is the
one to continue. That's one goal they have.
The other goal is to prolong the negotia
tions in order to create reality on the
ground. The more they prolong the negotia
tions, the more centrifuges will be running,
the more they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it will be to
turn back the clock. Their strategy is very, I
think, clear, and they have been doing this
for a long, long time, and they have become
very good at it — at pursuing this concur
rent strategy and using creative ambiguity to
delay and obfuscate and confuse and, ulti
mately, buy time.

SW: Two ideas were tossed about in the
L.A. Times earlier this week. One says that

Iran may now have a strong incentive to con
tinue delaying negotiations due to an appar
ent pattern of recent U.S. concessions. The
other says that Iran may bite at the freeze-for
freeze proposal because it believes it can
squeeze more out of Bush in his final months
than out of a new U.S. president. Is either of
these valid?
AM: I don't think so. In terms of the elec
tion, what I think did play a role might well
have been Obama's speech at AIPAC. It
was clear, in my view, that they were hoping
that maybe an Obama presidency would be
more lenient toward them. That speech
made it very clear that, on the nuclear issue,
Obama is as tough as anybody else is going
to be. In some ways, his talk at AIPAC was
every bit as tough as anything Bush has ever
said on Iran. So I think the idea of delaying
this until the election and finding out who is
in power so they might get a better deal is
much less of a concern to them, because
they now have realized that either Obama
or McCain, both of them, will be rather
tough on this.
The thing that one also has to realize is,
for them, I think the most important recent
turn of events has been the change in the
tone of the British. The British have become
much tougher, and the British have openly
suggested that they will put oil and gas on
the list of embargoed commodities. And the
regime knows that if oil and gas are part of
the embargo, then if they can't sell oil and
gas — if there's a big if — then they are in
deep trouble. In Britain now, talks are as
tough on these things as in the Bush admin
istration.
SW: Why has Britain's policy changed?
AM: I think it has to do with the fact that
the British have realized the regime in Iran
is going to be a threat for the region. This
precedes this regime — if you go back to the
'60s and '70s when Iran was run by the Shah,
the British had a tendency to side with the
Arab stales of the Persian Gulf: Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Yemen. The British have a long
history of close relations with these coun
tries, and they have protected these coun
tries essentially from Iran's bullying in the
past, and now they have realized that the
Arabs in the Persian Gulf are very con
cerned about Iran's rise as a predominant
force in the region. And if that [rise] is
accompanied by nuclear power, then the
Arab states of the Persian Gulf, which are
all Arab and predominantly Sunni, have
serious concerns.

SW: A third idea from the LA. Times
says that Iran is simply looking for a promise

that the U.S. will not topple Iran's govern
ment.
AM: This talk has been around for a long
time — this idea that the U.S. has to some
how say it is not going to engage in a regime
change, and the regime, in turn, will budge.
First of all, 1 think that game was at one time
the regime's game, but I think they now
think they are in a better position.
That's no longer just what they want.
They think the U.S. is in deep trouble in Iraq
and Afghanistan. They think the U.S.
doesn't have the military capacity to take on
another war. They think the U.S. economy is
in trouble. They think they are in a much
better position than they were four years
ago, when that offer would have been a very
appealing offer to them. Now I think they
want more. Whether they will budge is an
open question. If I were to guess today, 1
would say they are not going to budge.
Recent news coming out of Iran is not very
promising.
SW: Two weeks ago, Iran test-fired a mis
sile with the range to strike Israel.
Condoleezza Rice immediately said the U.S.
is committed to Israel's defense. What do the
missile tests mean for Israel, America and the
Middle East?
AM: One approach that is supported by
Ahmadinejad and a considerable portion of
the Revolutionary Guard commanders is
that the only way to get anything from the
West is if you go tit for tat, if you don't back
down. They have a very sort of street-fight
er mentality. If you throw a punch, they
throw a bigger punch. If you give an inch,
they will want three inches.
When the Israeli Air Force had an exer
cise over the seas near Greece — a distance
almost exactly equal to the distance from
Israel to Iran — the Israeli papers made it
very clear that this was a test-run for a pos
sible attack on Iran. Iran wanted to throw
back a punch. And there are elements, [for
whom] Ahmadinejad is sort of a spokesper
son, who want to be provocative. They want
to be provocative partly for the reason I just
said — they think that's the way you get the
West to back down. You don't conciliate,
you confront.
But there's also another reason why the
Ahmadinejads in Iran propose a confronta
tional attitude, and that is, lor them, the con
frontational attitude is a win-win situation.
If the West backs down, they have won. If
the West doesn't back down and the nega
tive confrontation does happen, they still
have won, because this faction in Iran does
not mind a military attack on Iran. They
know that if such an attack comes, they will
be in constant power and have a con
solidated hold on power.
SW: So am I correct to say that
you believe Iran's nuclear program is
not for civilian electricity needs — as
Iranian officials claim — hut for
building weapons?
AM: I think, for sure, that they
want to be a kind of de-facto nuclear
power, like Japan, where they have
the capacity, and the world knows
they have the capacity, but they
don't take the next step and develop
the bomb. That's the minimum.
They might take the next step and
develop the bomb itself.
If they get attacked, 1 can guaran
tee you that they will openly declare
that they will pursue the bomb. If
they don't, then they might, within a
couple of years, be there, where they
have the capacity to enrich uranium
in a form sufficient for weapons. You
know, the idea that they are pursuing

this just for the notion that this is
modern scicnce, that they should be
allowed to pursue modern science, is
just too, 1 think, absurd.
SW: The Bush administration is
reportedly considering an American
diplomatic presence in Iran, in the
form of so-called "interests sections"
where American diplomats could
issue visas to Iranians wishing to trav
el to the States. Of course, the U.S. has
not had any diplomatic presence in
the country since the Revolution in
'79. What impact would a renewed
presence have on U.S.-Iran relations?
AM: 1, with Mike McFaul and
Larry Diamond, suggested some
thing along these lines four years
ago. We wrote at the time that there
should be such a diplomatic pres
ence, and we also wrote what we
thought would be the consequence.
One consequence would be that
there would be enormous conver
gence on the embassy for visas. That
would be a very potent metaphor
and symbol of the people's dis
gruntlement with the regime. There
would be lines along the block,
because right now people travel to

"The more they [Iran] prolong
the negotiations... the more
they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it
will be to turn back the clock."

Dubai, to Turkey, to Pakistan, to
Europe, to get these visas.
The other consequence is that, if
the U.S. has diplomats on the ground
there, the U.S. government can have
a better sense of what's happening in
the country. Right now they're
shooting in the dark. Right now
they're at the mercy of some expatri
ates who have a political axe to
grind, or they're at the mercy of jour
nalists who often have very little

experience with Iran, or at the mercy
of, what had been until a few years
ago, a dwindling number of pro
grams for the study of Iran. Stanford
lias changed that with its Iranian
Studies program, and a couple of
other universities have done the
same, but if you look at academic
institutions a year before September
11, the incredible thing is that there
are a smaller number of centers
teaching Persian or Iranian studies.

SW: What caused this pre-9/11
shortage of centers teaching Iranian
studies?
AM: The shortage was, I think,
partly the result of the hostage crisis.
People were just fed up with the
Iranians. But for a country like the
U.S., with as much political, eco
nomic and global interest, you can't
get peeved at a country and stop
studying it because you're mad at it.
And right now, that country is Iran
— a central player in the Persian
Gulf and a central player in the
Muslim world. You can't just,
because you're mad at it, stop study
ing it. The reverse should have hap
pened. There should have been dou
ble the number of centers teaching
Iranian studies as there were before
September 11.
September 11 finally convinced
the powers-that-be here that you
need to study Islam, you need to
study Iran, you need to study the
Persian language, the culture, if you
are to understand who these people
are and what makes them tick.

President Bush recently authorized William Burns, the under
secretary of state for political affairs, to attend a meeting in
Geneva on Iran's nuclear program. The meeting, which was
held Saturday, produced no developments after Iran
responded with a written document failing to address inter
national demands.

In Geneva, officials from six negotiating
partners — the U.S., France, Britain.
Germany, Russia and China — pressed Iran
to accept a "freeze-for-freeze" proposal,
under which Iran would cease enriching ura
nium, and the U.S. and other powers would
not demand additional international sanc
tions against Iran. After Iranian officials
failed to address the nuclear concerns at the
meeting, the six nations gave Iran two weeks
to formally respond to the proposal before it
would be withdrawn.
To discuss the Geneva meeting, foreign
policies and the future of Iran, The Stanford
Weekly spoke with Visiting Prof, of Political
Science Abbas Milani, frequently referred
to by The New York Times as an "Iran
expert." Professor Milani currently serves as
director of Stanford's Iranian Studies pro
gram and as a research fellow and co-direc
tor of the Iran Democracy Project at the
Hoover Institution.
The Stanford Weekly: In the past, Bush
administration officials have said they will
not negotiate with Iran until Iran suspends its
uranium enrichment program. Why, then,
was William Burns sent to Geneva?
Abbas Milani: Well, first of all, they tried
to pretend like they haven't changed their
position by insisting that Burns was there
not to negotiate, but to participate, and that
he did not actually engage directly with the
Iranians, but sat there silently, watching.
But I think it is a change, in fact, and the
reality is that the demand was not that rea
sonable a demand to begin with. Suspension
of the enrichment is what the fight is about,
and you can't demand the other side to give
you what you want to negotiate about. It's a
very unusual demand to make, because the
ultimate goal of the negotiations, by every
account, would be suspension and some
thing else, so to demand that Iran should do
the only thing that it has up its sleeve as a
precondition of negotiation doesn't leave
much for them to negotiate with.
SW.- Would you say, as John Bolton told
The New York Times on Tuesday, that the
Bush administration is "desperate to sign

deals" in its final year?
AM: Not at all. 1 think John Bolton is
desperate to attack the Bush administration
for any sign of reason that they show in their
foreign policy. His diatribes against the
Bush administration on both the North
Korean and Iranian issues, 1 think, are more
the result of his ideology than of any clear
observance of reality as reality is. In his
world of neoconservative ideology, he can
do and he can surmise and he can order
what he wants, but in the world of diploma
cy, you have to work with reality, not with
the mandates of ideology. Work with reality,
and the world looks different.
SW: Iran presented a nonpaper in Geneva
that ignored the uranium enrichment con
cerns of the six countries sitting at the other
side of the table, and was subsequently given
two weeks to accept the freeze-for-freeze pro
posal. To your knowledge and opinion, what
is Iran's play here? What do you see happen
ing at the end of the two weeks?
AM: I think Iran's strategy is two-fold.
One is to look like they are conciliatory, to
look like they are open to a diplomatic solu
tion. This way, their allies — that is, China
and Russia — can then argue for a continu
ation of the diplomatic path. China and
Russia can continue to argue that harsher
methods and harsher embargos — harsher
punishments — are unnecessary, and that
the current, promising diplomatic path is the
one to continue. That's one goal they have.
The other goal is to prolong the negotia
tions in order to create reality on the
ground. The more they prolong the negotia
tions, the more centrifuges will be running,
the more they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it will be to
turn back the clock. Their strategy is very, I
think, clear, and they have been doing this

the British had a tendency to side with the

history of close relations with these coun
tries, and they have protected these coun

Arabs in the Persian Gulf are very con
cerned about Iran's rise as a predominant

Arab states of the Persian Gulf, which are
all Arab and predominantly Sunni, have
serious concerns.

SW: A third idea from the LA. Times
says that Iran is simply looking for a promise

that the U.S. will not topple Iran's govern
ment.
AM: This talk has been around for a long
time — this idea that the U.S. has to some
how say it is not going to engage in a regime
change, and the regime, in turn, will budge.
First of all, 1 think that game was at one time
the regime's game, but I think they now
think they are in a better position.
That's no longer just what they want.
They think the U.S. is in deep trouble in Iraq
and Afghanistan. They think the U.S.
doesn't have the military capacity to take on
another war. They think the U.S. economy is
in trouble. They think they are in a much
better position than they were four years
ago, when that offer would have been a very
appealing offer to them. Now I think they
want more. Whether they will budge is an
open question. If I were to guess today, 1
would say they are not going to budge.
Recent news coming out of Iran is not very
promising.
SW: Two weeks ago, Iran test-fired a mis
sile with the range to strike Israel.
Condoleezza Rice immediately said the U.S.
is committed to Israel's defense. What do the
missile tests mean for Israel, America and the
Middle East?
AM: One approach that is supported by
Ahmadinejad and a considerable portion of
the Revolutionary Guard commanders is
that the only way to get anything from the
West is if you go tit for tat, if you don't back
down. They have a very sort of street-fight
er mentality. If you throw a punch, they
throw a bigger punch. If you give an inch,
they will want three inches.
When the Israeli Air Force had an exer
cise over the seas near Greece — a distance
almost exactly equal to the distance from
Israel to Iran — the Israeli papers made it
very clear that this was a test-run for a pos
sible attack on Iran. Iran wanted to throw
back a punch. And there are elements, [for
whom] Ahmadinejad is sort of a spokesper
son, who want to be provocative. They want
to be provocative partly for the reason I just
said — they think that's the way you get the
West to back down. You don't conciliate,
you confront.
But there's also another reason why the
Ahmadinejads in Iran propose a confronta
tional attitude, and that is, lor them, the con
frontational attitude is a win-win situation.
If the West backs down, they have won. If
the West doesn't back down and the nega
tive confrontation does happen, they still
have won, because this faction in Iran does
not mind a military attack on Iran. They
know that if such an attack comes, they will
be in constant power and have a con
solidated hold on power.
SW: So am I correct to say that
you believe Iran's nuclear program is
not for civilian electricity needs — as
Iranian officials claim — hut for
building weapons?
AM: I think, for sure, that they
want to be a kind of de-facto nuclear
power, like Japan, where they have
the capacity, and the world knows
they have the capacity, but they
don't take the next step and develop
the bomb. That's the minimum.
They might take the next step and
develop the bomb itself.
If they get attacked, 1 can guaran
tee you that they will openly declare
that they will pursue the bomb. If
they don't, then they might, within a
couple of years, be there, where they
have the capacity to enrich uranium
in a form sufficient for weapons. You
know, the idea that they are pursuing

this just for the notion that this is
modern scicnce, that they should be
allowed to pursue modern science, is
just too, 1 think, absurd.
SW: The Bush administration is
reportedly considering an American
diplomatic presence in Iran, in the
form of so-called "interests sections"
where American diplomats could
issue visas to Iranians wishing to trav
el to the States. Of course, the U.S. has
not had any diplomatic presence in
the country since the Revolution in
'79. What impact would a renewed
presence have on U.S.-Iran relations?
AM: 1, with Mike McFaul and
Larry Diamond, suggested some
thing along these lines four years
ago. We wrote at the time that there
should be such a diplomatic pres
ence, and we also wrote what we
thought would be the consequence.
One consequence would be that
there would be enormous conver
gence on the embassy for visas. That
would be a very potent metaphor
and symbol of the people's dis
gruntlement with the regime. There
would be lines along the block,
because right now people travel to

"The more they [Iran] prolong
the negotiations... the more
they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it
will be to turn back the clock."

Dubai, to Turkey, to Pakistan, to
Europe, to get these visas.
The other consequence is that, if
the U.S. has diplomats on the ground
there, the U.S. government can have
a better sense of what's happening in
the country. Right now they're
shooting in the dark. Right now
they're at the mercy of some expatri
ates who have a political axe to
grind, or they're at the mercy of jour
nalists who often have very little

experience with Iran, or at the mercy
of, what had been until a few years
ago, a dwindling number of pro
grams for the study of Iran. Stanford
lias changed that with its Iranian
Studies program, and a couple of
other universities have done the
same, but if you look at academic
institutions a year before September
11, the incredible thing is that there
are a smaller number of centers
teaching Persian or Iranian studies.

SW: What caused this pre-9/11
shortage of centers teaching Iranian
studies?
AM: The shortage was, I think,
partly the result of the hostage crisis.
People were just fed up with the
Iranians. But for a country like the
U.S., with as much political, eco
nomic and global interest, you can't
get peeved at a country and stop
studying it because you're mad at it.
And right now, that country is Iran
— a central player in the Persian
Gulf and a central player in the
Muslim world. You can't just,
because you're mad at it, stop study
ing it. The reverse should have hap
pened. There should have been dou
ble the number of centers teaching
Iranian studies as there were before
September 11.
September 11 finally convinced
the powers-that-be here that you
need to study Islam, you need to
study Iran, you need to study the
Persian language, the culture, if you
are to understand who these people
are and what makes them tick.

President Bush recently authorized William Burns, the under
secretary of state for political affairs, to attend a meeting in
Geneva on Iran's nuclear program. The meeting, which was
held Saturday, produced no developments after Iran
responded with a written document failing to address inter
national demands.

In Geneva, officials from six negotiating
partners — the U.S., France, Britain.
Germany, Russia and China — pressed Iran
to accept a "freeze-for-freeze" proposal,
under which Iran would cease enriching ura
nium, and the U.S. and other powers would
not demand additional international sanc
tions against Iran. After Iranian officials
failed to address the nuclear concerns at the
meeting, the six nations gave Iran two weeks
to formally respond to the proposal before it
would be withdrawn.
To discuss the Geneva meeting, foreign
policies and the future of Iran, The Stanford
Weekly spoke with Visiting Prof, of Political
Science Abbas Milani, frequently referred
to by The New York Times as an "Iran
expert." Professor Milani currently serves as
director of Stanford's Iranian Studies pro
gram and as a research fellow and co-direc
tor of the Iran Democracy Project at the
Hoover Institution.
The Stanford Weekly: In the past, Bush
administration officials have said they will
not negotiate with Iran until Iran suspends its
uranium enrichment program. Why, then,
was William Burns sent to Geneva?
Abbas Milani: Well, first of all, they tried
to pretend like they haven't changed their
position by insisting that Burns was there
not to negotiate, but to participate, and that
he did not actually engage directly with the
Iranians, but sat there silently, watching.
But I think it is a change, in fact, and the
reality is that the demand was not that rea
sonable a demand to begin with. Suspension
of the enrichment is what the fight is about,
and you can't demand the other side to give
you what you want to negotiate about. It's a
very unusual demand to make, because the
ultimate goal of the negotiations, by every
account, would be suspension and some
thing else, so to demand that Iran should do
the only thing that it has up its sleeve as a
precondition of negotiation doesn't leave
much for them to negotiate with.
SW.- Would you say, as John Bolton told
The New York Times on Tuesday, that the
Bush administration is "desperate to sign

deals" in its final year?
AM: Not at all. 1 think John Bolton is
desperate to attack the Bush administration
for any sign of reason that they show in their
foreign policy. His diatribes against the
Bush administration on both the North
Korean and Iranian issues, 1 think, are more
the result of his ideology than of any clear
observance of reality as reality is. In his
world of neoconservative ideology, he can
do and he can surmise and he can order
what he wants, but in the world of diploma
cy, you have to work with reality, not with
the mandates of ideology. Work with reality,
and the world looks different.
SW: Iran presented a nonpaper in Geneva
that ignored the uranium enrichment con
cerns of the six countries sitting at the other
side of the table, and was subsequently given
two weeks to accept the freeze-for-freeze pro
posal. To your knowledge and opinion, what
is Iran's play here? What do you see happen
ing at the end of the two weeks?
AM: I think Iran's strategy is two-fold.
One is to look like they are conciliatory, to
look like they are open to a diplomatic solu
tion. This way, their allies — that is, China
and Russia — can then argue for a continu
ation of the diplomatic path. China and
Russia can continue to argue that harsher
methods and harsher embargos — harsher
punishments — are unnecessary, and that
the current, promising diplomatic path is the
one to continue. That's one goal they have.
The other goal is to prolong the negotia
tions in order to create reality on the
ground. The more they prolong the negotia
tions, the more centrifuges will be running,
the more they will have learned about the
process and the more difficult it will be to
turn back the clock. Their strategy is very, I
think, clear, and they have been doing this
for a long, long time, and they have become
very good at it — at pursuing this concur
rent strategy and using creative ambiguity to
delay and obfuscate and confuse and, ulti
mately, buy time.

SW: Two ideas were tossed about in the
L.A. Times earlier this week. One says that

Iran may now have a strong incentive to con
tinue delaying negotiations due to an appar
ent pattern of recent U.S. concessions. The
other says that Iran may bite at the freeze-for
freeze proposal because it believes it can
squeeze more out of Bush in his final months
than out of a new U.S. president. Is either of
these valid?
AM: I don't think so. In terms of the elec
tion, what I think did play a role might well
have been Obama's speech at AIPAC. It
was clear, in my view, that they were hoping
that maybe an Obama presidency would be
more lenient toward them. That speech
made it very clear that, on the nuclear issue,
Obama is as tough as anybody else is going
to be. In some ways, his talk at AIPAC was
every bit as tough as anything Bush has ever
said on Iran. So I think the idea of delaying
this until the election and finding out who is
in power so they might get a better deal is
much less of a concern to them, because
they now have realized that either Obama
or McCain, both of them, will be rather
tough on this.
The thing that one also has to realize is,
for them, I think the most important recent
turn of events has been the change in the
tone of the British. The British have become
much tougher, and the British have openly
suggested that they will put oil and gas on
the list of embargoed commodities. And the
regime knows that if oil and gas are part of
the embargo, then if they can't sell oil and
gas — if there's a big if — then they are in
deep trouble. In Britain now, talks are as
tough on these things as in the Bush admin
istration.
SW: Why has Britain's policy changed?
AM: I think it has to do with the fact that
the British have realized the regime in Iran
is going to be a threat for the region. This
precedes this regime — if you go back to the
'60s and '70s when Iran was run by the Shah,
the British had a tendency to side with the
Arab stales of the Persian Gulf: Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Yemen. The British have a long
history of close relations with these coun
tries, and they have protected these coun
tries essentially from Iran's bullying in the
past, and now they have realized that the
Arabs in the Persian Gulf are very con
cerned about Iran's rise as a predominant
force in the region. And if that [rise] is
accompanied by nuclear power, then the
Arab states of the Persian Gulf, which are
all Arab and predominantly Sunni, have
serious concerns.

SW: A third idea from the LA. Times
says that Iran is simply looking for a promise

that the U.S. will not topple Iran's govern
ment.
AM: This talk has been around for a long
