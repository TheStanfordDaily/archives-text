## Stu's Views Assessing the Veepstakes 
### 
The media's favorite pastime
this summer, besides pretend
ing that the parties' conven
tions actually matter, is covering
what has become known as "the
Veepstakes." Both presidential can
didates will pick their vice-presiden
tial nominee before the convention,
and they usually make their
announcement at a time when they
can maximize media coverage. The
process is typically carried out in
great secrecy by the presidential
campaigns, but leaks — most of
them wrong — inevitably appear.
To wit: It was rumored this week
that John McCain would make his
announcement very soon, to draw
some attention away from Barack
Obama's trip abroad. Now that
appears unlikely.
Because the media has usually
very little idea who will actually be
picked, or who is even a contender,
they have license to discuss any rea
sonably well-known politician under
the sun. For Obama, at least 30
names have been discussed in the
media, few of which have any real
chance of being picked. The average
American has heard of maybe three
of these people. The list seems
smaller for John McCain, if only
because he more clearly has to pan
der to conservative elements of the
Republican Party. For both, the
picks are likely to be unexciting and
mildly predictable, and they will
change nothing about the dynamics
of the race. No one even watches the
vice-presidential debate anyway.
The conventional wisdom spout
ed by most commentators is that
candidates should pick someone to
"balance" the ticket. Obama, by this
logic, should pick someone with for
eign-policy experience, and McCain
should pick someone younger and
more charismatic. Former or cur
rent senators Sam Nunn, Joe Biden
and Tom Daschle are all rumored to
be undergoing "vetting" by
Obama's team; the charismatic Mitt
Romney and Bobby Jindal are
rumored to be at the top of
McCain's list. It's not entirely clear
how Joe Biden would make Obama
seem more experienced — every
one knows that it would be Obama
with the finger on the red button,
not Biden. If the vice presidency had
real formal power, then perhaps the
conventional wisdom would make
sense. But being Veep does not
mean much in the end.
What few people seem to realize
is that choosing a vice-presidential
running mate rarely has any effect at
all on the presidential race, and the
selection process hardly justifies such
hullabaloo. George W. Bush led in
the polls before picking Dick

Cheney, and Boh Dole trailed before
and after picking Jack Kemp. John
Kerry's choice of John Edwards had
little impact. Only one choice in
recent memory has had a real effect
— JFK's choice of LBJ meant that he
won Texas, and so the presidency.
This is one strategy that might have
real traction. One journalist follow
ing Obama's Veepstakes has an
entire category, "Virginia is for
Lovers," for Virginian Democrats
who might help him win the state —
Mark Warner, Jim Webb and Tim
Kaine. Perhaps aware that they
would be selected solely to win their
state, Warner and Webb have both
declared their disinterest in the
office.
The conventional wisdom —
choosing someone for "balance" —
is an idea that will likely have no
positive effect on the ticket's
chances. Take Bill Clinton in 1992.
Being a young Southern governor,
he should have chosen an older,
Northern type. Instead, he chose a
young Southern senator, which
reinforced his message of centrist
change. If Obama were to select
someone who also represented
change, instead of experience, it
would add to his credibility as an
"agent of change" and reinforce his
campaign's central narrative.
McCain is on trickier ground. His
age is not perceived as a good
thing, and picking someone too old
will increase negative perceptions
of his campaign. Picking Bobby
Jindal, who is 37, would only accen
tuate the public's perceptions of
him as "old." But if McCain wants
to make the case that age is not a
bad thing, he would be better
served by picking someone with a
few grey hairs.
The selections will be announced
probably a couple of weeks before
the convention to great fanfare and
discussion. The pick will be evaluat
ed, everyone will talk about it and
there will be 110 discernible "bump"
in the polls for either candidates.
And we'll wonder — or at least I will
— why the media took us through
the entire process in the first place.

Stuart Baimel was right: The Dark
Knight is indeed the greatest film of all
time. Do you agree, or is it just a mas
terpiece for our time? Send him your
