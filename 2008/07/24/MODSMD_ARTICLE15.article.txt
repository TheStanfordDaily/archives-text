## Ecstatic Contra Dancing and Ego Death 
### 
Life is good out here at the little
known Stanford-in-Boston pro
gram. I'm taking full advantage
of the opportunities here this summer:
attending outdoor classical music con
certs at the Hatch Shell, swimming in
Walden Pond, getting caught in flash
thunderstorms and doing bikram yoga
in my own home (no air conditioning,
and it gets steamy!).
But my favorite activity I've dis
covered up here is contra dancing,
which is a big deal in the Northeast.
Indeed, it is also called traditional
New England folk dance.
It's been said that contra dancing
is the most fun you can have with
your clothes on. I can agree with that.
The best way to describe it is "ecstat-

pattern of moves in two lines could be
so fun? I have a few theories.
First off, the music is so happy. It's
usually Anglo-Celtic music, with jigs
and reels, and Irish, Scottish, French,
Canadian and Old-Time tunes per
formed by live musicians, tunes like
"Rose in the Heather" and "Music
for a Found Harmonium." Track
those down (I like the Patrick Street
version of the latter) and see if they
don't make you happy. Then imagine
listening to music like this for hours
and having it in your head for a long
time afterwards â€” it's very mood

enhancing.
The dance moves are fun.
Remember how as a kid you swung
around with people holding hands,
leaning back and feeling the (appar
ent) centrifugal force? Well, you do
something like that almost every
other move in contra dance, because
many of the moves involve "giving
weight" or leaning back to create a
pull. Decades after childhood, it's still
fun to be pulled around by people.
It's acceptable (and hard not) to
smile continuously. Sometimes I feel
like smiling continuously for long
periods, and it's hard to be brave
enough to do this in public (try it), but
