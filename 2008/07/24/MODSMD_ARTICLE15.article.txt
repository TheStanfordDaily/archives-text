## Ecstatic Contra Dancing and Ego Death 
### 
Life is good out here at the little
known Stanford-in-Boston pro
gram. I'm taking full advantage
of the opportunities here this summer:
attending outdoor classical music con
certs at the Hatch Shell, swimming in
Walden Pond, getting caught in flash
thunderstorms and doing bikram yoga
in my own home (no air conditioning,
and it gets steamy!).
But my favorite activity I've dis
covered up here is contra dancing,
which is a big deal in the Northeast.
Indeed, it is also called traditional
New England folk dance.
It's been said that contra dancing
is the most fun you can have with
your clothes on. I can agree with that.
The best way to describe it is "ecstat-

Runyan

ic." Who would think that doing a
pattern of moves in two lines could be
so fun? I have a few theories.
First off, the music is so happy. It's
usually Anglo-Celtic music, with jigs
and reels, and Irish, Scottish, French,
Canadian and Old-Time tunes per
formed by live musicians, tunes like
"Rose in the Heather" and "Music
for a Found Harmonium." Track
those down (I like the Patrick Street
version of the latter) and see if they
don't make you happy. Then imagine
listening to music like this for hours
and having it in your head for a long
time afterwards — it's very mood

enhancing.
The dance moves are fun.
Remember how as a kid you swung
around with people holding hands,
leaning back and feeling the (appar
ent) centrifugal force? Well, you do
something like that almost every
other move in contra dance, because
many of the moves involve "giving
weight" or leaning back to create a
pull. Decades after childhood, it's still
fun to be pulled around by people.
It's acceptable (and hard not) to
smile continuously. Sometimes I feel
like smiling continuously for long
periods, and it's hard to be brave
enough to do this in public (try it), but

you can smile all you want at contra
dancc. It's been "shown" that smiling
can make you happy, so maybe this is
just one of many ways that contra
dance gives you a good vibe.
Contra dance has many elements
that can induce a flow state, as
defined by unspellable psychologist
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Such ele
ments include clear goals (doing the
dance right), concentration (remem
bering the moves and listening to the
caller name the moves), a loss of self
consciousness (100 busy dancing to
think about how you're dancing), a
distorted sense of lime, an appropri
ate level of challenge, a sense of per
sonal control (you're dancing, not
watching), absorption in the activity
and intrinsic rewards (it's a blast).
In particular, contra dancing
requires you to concentrate and be
"in the moment" — not just for 20
minutes of meditation, but for several
hours of dancing. If the dance is com
plicated or if the caller stops naming
the moves, you have to stay focused
on what you're doing. If you start

thinking about the cute guy you're
about to dance with or what you're
doing after the dance, you'll probably
mess up the figure for yourself and
the people around you (speaking
from experience here).
If you mess up, you mess up the set
for the people around you. It might
seem counterintuitive, but I think this
makes contra dance more fun, as it
creates a situation similar to the
"keep the ball/balloon up" game,
where people make a group effort to
keep something going. Games and
dances like this build teamwork by
creating a situation in which we win
together and lose together.
Indeed, when contra dancing,
you're literally part of something big
ger than yourself. Not only are you
involved in a group effort to execute a
complicated dance, but individuals
are the moving parts of bigger pat
terns. Your own moves are secondary
to the pattern created by lines of peo
ple doing these moves in relation to
one another. Watching a contra
dance, you'll sec a bunch of people
dancing past each other in symmetric
patterns, somehow knowing where to
go in the crowd, in what looks like a
very organized morning at Grand
Central. It's like marching band, with
people acting not as individuals but as

part of a larger, mesmerizing pattern.
Come to think of it, maybe contra
dancers are like rhizomes: seemingly
individual shoots that are all part of
the same plant. 1 don't understand the
Deleuze and Guattari idea of multi
plicity, but someone suggested it
might apply.

Another analogy for people being
parts of a whole is the Sufi idea that
we're all like waves on the ocean —
that we're all God and individuality is
an illusion (ha, then the humanists
and theists could agree).
If that's the case, then dying means
losing that individuality but becoming

(at least temporarily) part of some big
amazing thing. I'm not sure whether
that happens, but maybe it's not so
bad if it's anything like contra danc
ing!
