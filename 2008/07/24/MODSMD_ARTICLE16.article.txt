## Red Mississippi Blues 
### 
Last Friday, Howard Dean, chair
man of the Democratic
National Committee, came to
speak in Jackson, Miss, at Tougaloo
College. I'm in Jackson for the sum
mer for an internship. Feeling slightly
displaced and very much in the politi
cal minority, I excitedly went to go see
him speak with some co-workers.
Tougaloo College is a small liberal
arts school located in the northeast
outskirts of Jackson. It is a historically
African-American college, and its
campus was a hotbed of activity dur
ing the 19605. The house of Medgar
Evers' assassination is located on cam
pus, and Tougaloo maintains it as a
museum and memorial library.
Driving up Jackson's State Street, I
thought about these things and once
again felt the incredible historical sig
nificance of Barack Obama's presi-

Dan Hirsch

dential candidacy.
As my co-workers and I turned
onto the street of Tougaloo's campus,
traffic slowed and we saw police offi
cers along the road and a small group
of people clustered on the road's dirt
shoulder. Then, we saw the signs they
were holding. Under slogans like
"Victims of our nation's Holocaust"
were blown up images of aborted
fetuses. I certainly wasn't in Western
Massachusetts anymore, nor Palo
Alto for that matter. The Jackson
Women's Health Organization is the
only medical abortion facility in the
entire state of Mississippi. I'm told
that the group we saw stands outside
of the center every week, holding the
same incredibly graphic placards. We

passed under the white arch of
Tougaloo's main entrance and the
protesters simultaneously waved and
glared.
Running a little late, we assumed
we would have to struggle to find seats
together, but when we entered the
gym we saw that there were plenty of
empty ones. In fact, organizers were
hurriedly taking seats away to make
the space look more occupied for the
local television crews. After an intro
duction by Obama's Jackson cam
paign manager, and a short speech by
Jamie Franks, Chairman of the
Mississippi Democratic Party,
Howard Dean stepped onto the stage.
Dean explained that his visit to
Jackson is part of a 50-state bus tour
that he started off in Crawford,
Texas. The departure point — our
lame duck president's assumed
hometown — works fairly obviously
as a symbol. The idea here is that the
Democratic Party and its presump
tive presidential nominee are a party
and candidate for the whole country.
They will represent "deep red" west
Texas just as they will represent
Westchester County. And they will
win in all those places; or at the very
least, try in a way they have not
before.
In a folksy, locally tailored
metaphor Dean used throughout the
night, he explained that when
Auburn and Ole Miss get on the field
to play football, he doesn't know who

will win, but there's a clear winner if
one of the teams fails to arrive. He
said that he didn't know who would
win in November, but that it was time
for the Democratic Party to at least
show up in the South. This got a big
cheer. Who knows? Might Mississippi
go blue?
Dean told us that the South has
changed, that the Democratic Party
has changed, that Obama will be a
president of the entire country and
that "it's time for us to stop arguing
about what we can't agree on, and
start talking about what we can
agree on." He said that the Obama
campaign is reaching out to evangel
ical Christians because they share
some of the same priorities: halting
genocide, saving the environment
and ending poverty. I was with him
then, thinking that yes, there are so
many things this country can come
together on, so many broken things

that our generation knows have to
be fixed. And then suddenly, 1
remembered the churning feeling in
my guts as we drove by the protest
ers and saw their unsettling plac
ards. 1 thought of the wide array of
things on which we will never agree.
Then again, who knows what to
expect this fall? Both McCain and
Obama are unusual candidates at an
unusual time in an unusual country
(see previous edition of this col
umn). And who knows what to
expect from a state like Mississippi,
with record-high voter turnout in the
primaries, a recently elected
Democratic congressman and such
diverse and illustrious natives as
Faulkner, Oprah and Elvis.

When he's not busy helping register
Mississippians to vote, Dan Hirsch
readily responds to emails sent to
djhirsch@stanford.edu.
