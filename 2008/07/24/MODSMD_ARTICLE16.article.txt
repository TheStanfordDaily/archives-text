Last Friday, Howard Dean, chair
man of the Democratic
National Committee, came to
speak in Jackson, Miss, at Tougaloo
College. I'm in Jackson for the sum
mer for an internship. Feeling slightly
displaced and very much in the politi
cal minority, I excitedly went to go see
him speak with some co-workers.
Tougaloo College is a small liberal
arts school located in the northeast
outskirts of Jackson. It is a historically
African-American college, and its
campus was a hotbed of activity dur
ing the 19605. The house of Medgar

museum and memorial library.

onto the street of Tougaloo's campus,

were holding. Under slogans like
"Victims of our nation's Holocaust"
were blown up images of aborted
fetuses. I certainly wasn't in Western
Massachusetts anymore, nor Palo
Alto for that matter. The Jackson
Women's Health Organization is the
only medical abortion facility in the
entire state of Mississippi. I'm told

of the center every week, holding the
same incredibly graphic placards. We

passed under the white arch of
Tougaloo's main entrance and the
protesters simultaneously waved and
glared.
Running a little late, we assumed
we would have to struggle to find seats
together, but when we entered the
gym we saw that there were plenty of
empty ones. In fact, organizers were
hurriedly taking seats away to make
the space look more occupied for the
local television crews. After an intro
duction by Obama's Jackson cam
paign manager, and a short speech by
Jamie Franks, Chairman of the
Mississippi Democratic Party,
Howard Dean stepped onto the stage.
Dean explained that his visit to
Jackson is part of a 50-state bus tour
that he started off in Crawford,
