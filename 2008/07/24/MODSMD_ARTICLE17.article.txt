## Cat Network helps Stanford strays 
### NATHANIEL EISEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As wc turn our backs on the bowls of water and
cat food, glowing eyes watch us from the
undergrowth. I'm feeding stray cats near Stock
Farm Road with Carole Miller, the co-founder
and feeding and trapping coordinator of the
Stanford Cat Network (SCN), and the cats — who would
normally trust her — are a bit wary of me.
SCN is a non-profit organization dedicated to spaying,
neutering, feeding and arranging for the adoption of stray
cats living on the Stanford campus. The network came into
existence in 1989 in response to a cat crisis. At the time,
there were at least 500 stray cats iiving around campus,
and University administration was considering trapping
and removing them, which would probably have ended in
euthanasia for the cats.
The network persuaded the University to let them deal
with the problem by humanely trapping the cats, then
spaying or neutering and vaccinating them.
"If you remove all the cats, the vacuum is filled by new
comers," Miller said. The best way to manage the popula
tion is to spay and neuter the cats you have."
After the spaying and neutering, which takes place at
the Stanford Pet Clinic, workers decide whether the cats
are socialized, and so can be adopted, or if they are feral,
in which case they are re-released into their territory on
campus.
The differences are small, and may take months to dis
cern, but there are definite clues that Miller looks for.
"If they are kittens, they can definitely be adopted,"
Miller said. "If they are homeless long enough, they
become wary for their own survival. But a cat who has had
people contact will usually make eye contact with you and
talk to you."

About 25 volunteers put out food and water daily for
the animals at feeding stations around campus. Lindsey
Boos '05 feeds three cats by the fire station and an
unknown number in Rains Graduate Housing.
"It feels good to know that [the cats] have got food to
eat," Boos said, "and I love to see them every day."
Sometimes, Boos recalled, a cat's behavior toward her
will change over time.
"The first cat 1 fed was named Flo, because she lived at
FloMo," she said. "At first, I didn't see her. By the end of
the year, she came within a couple of feet of me."
Boos has had many interesting encounters over the
years, including with animals other than cats.
"I went to set food down once and a raccoon paw took
hold of the bowl," Boos recalled. "1 had a tug of war with
him."
Many of the cats fed by SCN are former pets whose
owners abandoned them on campus. According to Miller,
there is evidence that students abandon many of the cats at
quarter breaks.
"They probably rationalize that the cat will be fine,"
Miller said.
According to Miller, however, the cats cannot hunt well
enough to survive. That's where the network steps in.
Miller feels that the network's efforts have been a suc
cess, citing the reduction in the number of cats on campus
from 500 to a few dozen. Yet she also feels thai there will
always be stray cats on campus, and so SCN's continued
existence is vital.
"These animals would not survive without us," she said.
"We're a solution as long as we keep [our work] up."
To further reduce the number of strays, SCN conducts
a "don't-adopt" campaign in the fall, and a "don't aban
don" campaign in the spring of every year, to warn stu
dents not to adopt cats they will not be able to keep, and
not to abandon the ones they can no longer care for.
Miller herself replenishes 17 feeding stations daily. As

we walk away from the feeding station on Stock Farm
Road, Miller turns to the watchful cats and says tenderly,
as she says to all the cats she feeds, "Good night. God
bless." The eyes blink back.
