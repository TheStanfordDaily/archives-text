## BANK OF THE WEST CLASSIC Wozniak wins Classic in upset 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Defying all odds and overcoming a
crowded field of top-ranked players, a new
champion was crowned at the 38th annual
Bank of the West Classic held at Stanford's
Taube Family Tennis Stadium this past
week. And it wasn't Serena Williams,
defending champion Anna Chakvetadze or
crowd-favorite Sania Mirza.
Instead, 20-year-old qualifier
Aleksandra Wozniak took home the title as
the first Canadian to win a WTA Tour title
in 20 years.
Wozniak defeated a worn-down Marion
Bartoli 7-5,6-3 on a clear Sunday afternoon
for her first career title.
"It feels great," Wozniak said. "It's my
first title on the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour
and I'm really excited and proud of what I
have accomplished here, advancing through
the qualifying round."
As a qualifier, Wozniak won three
matches to play in the main draw. Once in
the bracket, she would need four consecu
tive wins to reach the finals.
"You know, I believe in myself, but I
never thought I could win this tournament,"
Wozniak said after her first career victory.
Playing in her eighth and final match of
the tournament, Wozniak showed no signs
of fatigue in the finals, blasting 33 winners to
Bartoli's 12.
Former Wimbledon finalist Bartoli, on
the other hand, began to falter during the
second set and was clearly ailing.
"I just tried to forget about the pain and
stay focused," Bartoli said. "But my legs
were moving so slowly and I wasn't able to
hit the ball as I was able to do in my last
match ... I was going through a lot of pain,

but I just wanted to finish the match."
Despite her injury, Bartoli continued to
battle in the final frame, only losing serve
once.
"She kept fighting," Wozniak said. "She
kept hitting the ball through even though
she called a medical timeout â€” so I was sur
prised. So. I kept hitting aggressive and try
ing not to get distracted by her injury."
Though Bartoli, in her first finals since
her 2007 Wimbledon showing, would even
tually yield to Wozniak's dominant play, she
certainly gave the fans what they had came
for.
Factoring into the finals upset may have
been that most of Bartoli's previous match
es took place in the night session, while
Wozniak was able to acclimate to daytime
on the courts.
A day earlier, Wozniak finished her
semifinal match against Williams in the
early afternoon, while Bartoli would have to
overcome Sugiyama in yet another night
match.
Still, Bartoli fought Wozniak until the
last point.
"It's hard to retire during the final of the
tournament," Bartoli said. "1 just wanted to
give the fans a complete match and even if I
knew I was unable to win it, it was just bet
ter for everyone to try and keep going to the
end."
Despite Bartoli's effort, many big names
were quickly eliminated from the bracket
since day one.
Before even the first match, former
champion Lindsey Davenport and No. 6
Elena Dementieva withdrew from the
Classic due to injury.
In the first round, three qualifiers

West Classic. Liu was eliminated in the first round of the main draw by the hard-hitting Patty Schnyder.
