## BANK OF THE WEST CLASSIC Wozniak wins Classic in upset 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Defying all odds and overcoming a
crowded field of top-ranked players, a new
champion was crowned at the 38th annual
Bank of the West Classic held at Stanford's
Taube Family Tennis Stadium this past
week. And it wasn't Serena Williams,
defending champion Anna Chakvetadze or
crowd-favorite Sania Mirza.
Instead, 20-year-old qualifier
Aleksandra Wozniak took home the title as
the first Canadian to win a WTA Tour title
in 20 years.
Wozniak defeated a worn-down Marion
Bartoli 7-5,6-3 on a clear Sunday afternoon
for her first career title.
"It feels great," Wozniak said. "It's my
first title on the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour
and I'm really excited and proud of what I
have accomplished here, advancing through
the qualifying round."
As a qualifier, Wozniak won three
matches to play in the main draw. Once in
the bracket, she would need four consecu
tive wins to reach the finals.
"You know, I believe in myself, but I
never thought I could win this tournament,"
Wozniak said after her first career victory.
Playing in her eighth and final match of
the tournament, Wozniak showed no signs
of fatigue in the finals, blasting 33 winners to
Bartoli's 12.
Former Wimbledon finalist Bartoli, on
the other hand, began to falter during the
second set and was clearly ailing.
"I just tried to forget about the pain and
stay focused," Bartoli said. "But my legs
were moving so slowly and I wasn't able to
hit the ball as I was able to do in my last
match ... I was going through a lot of pain,

but I just wanted to finish the match."
Despite her injury, Bartoli continued to
battle in the final frame, only losing serve
once.
"She kept fighting," Wozniak said. "She
kept hitting the ball through even though
she called a medical timeout — so I was sur
prised. So. I kept hitting aggressive and try
ing not to get distracted by her injury."
Though Bartoli, in her first finals since
her 2007 Wimbledon showing, would even
tually yield to Wozniak's dominant play, she
certainly gave the fans what they had came
for.
Factoring into the finals upset may have
been that most of Bartoli's previous match
es took place in the night session, while
Wozniak was able to acclimate to daytime
on the courts.
A day earlier, Wozniak finished her
semifinal match against Williams in the
early afternoon, while Bartoli would have to
overcome Sugiyama in yet another night
match.
Still, Bartoli fought Wozniak until the
last point.
"It's hard to retire during the final of the
tournament," Bartoli said. "1 just wanted to
give the fans a complete match and even if I
knew I was unable to win it, it was just bet
ter for everyone to try and keep going to the
end."
Despite Bartoli's effort, many big names
were quickly eliminated from the bracket
since day one.
Before even the first match, former
champion Lindsey Davenport and No. 6
Elena Dementieva withdrew from the
Classic due to injury.
In the first round, three qualifiers

advanced, including Anne
Keothavong, who upset last year's
finalist Sania Mirza. Backed by the
crowd's audible support, Mirza could
not repeat her 2007 run to the finals.
More shockingly, one of the
biggest names in women's tennis,
Serena Williams, was almost upset by
15 year-old Michelle Larcher de Brito
of Portugal in the first round.
Making her first appearance on
the Farm since the 1999 Fed Cup,
Williams drew a packed crowd on a
cool Tuesday evening.
"I've never been able to make it
here, so I'm happy that I'm here and
playing here," Williams said. "It's a
different atmosphere — it's nice."
Larcher de Brito burst out of the
gates, taking the first set 6-4. Finally
adjusting to her game, Williams came
back for the three-set victory.
After the match, Williams lauded
her young opponent.
"I think if she plays the way she
plays against me, she'll be a great
player," Williams said.
Williams would fall in the semifi
nals to Wozniak, retiring after injur
ing a heavily wrapped left knee.
The last quarterfinalist, 33 year

old Ai Sugiyama, also drew a large
crowd after defeating fourth seed
Daniela Hantuchova in the first
round. Sugiyama would eventually
fall to Bartoli in the semifinals.
On a side note, the Stanford
women's tennis program also made a
splash on the tennis scene.
Former Cardinal Amber Liu '06
competed in the main draw against
Patty Schnyder in the first round.
"I played four years on that court
and it's nice to have the home
crowd," Liu said. "So I was actually
pretty comfortable, but just a little bit
out of match practice. The crowd has
always been behind me here.
"I feel like this is my second
home," she added.
Though backed by the crowd and
fiance Michael Chang in the stands,
Liu fell 6-1, 6-1 to the hard-hitting
Schnyder.
Similarly, rising sophomore phe
nom Hilary Barte represented the
Card in the qualifiers, but suffered an
inopportune injury and lost.
Ultimately, the Classic brought
big names and storylines to Stanford,
injecting life into the otherwise calm
campus summertime sports scene.
After a long week of match-play, ten
nis fans will have to wait a year for the
Classic's return to the Farm in 2009.
