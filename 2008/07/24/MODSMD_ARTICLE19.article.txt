# BANK OF THE WEST CLASSIC
## Bartoli's warrior spirit captures hearts at Farm's Classic Marion Bartoli finishes strong, falls just short of title 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Marion Bartoli is a fighter.
The 2008 Bank of the West Classic finalist
may not have been the most famous (Serena
Williams), the oldest (Ai Sugiyama, 33), the
youngest (Michelle Larcher de Brito, 15), the
tallest (Akgul Amanmuradova, 6'3") nor the
slimmest (Daniela Hantuchova) competitor at
the event.
But, boy, is she a fighter.

Like her idol, Monica Seles, Bartoli plays
two-handed on both sides, a strategic relic of
a prior age, uncommon in an era of hard hit
ters and crowd-pleasers.
In the quarterfinals against Anna
Chakvetadze, the crowd openly cheered on
Anna as the defending champion of the
Classic.
Bartoli easily defeated her 6-3, 6-4.
In the semifinals against Ai Sugiyama, the
crowd backed her opponent with rallying calls
for Sugiyama.
Bartoli handled her 6-3, 6-4 on national
television.
Finally, in the finals against Aleksandra
Wozniak, where Bartoli was supposed to be
the favorite, the crowd cheered on "Wozi,"

looking for a feel-good upset.
And finally, Bartoli's suit of armor
cracked.
To look at her on the court, Bartoli had run
out of steam at the finish line in her first finals
appearance since her Cinderella run to the
2007 Wimbledon finals. And who could blame
her?
Against Chakvetadze, everyone knew
Anna, but few knew to call out Marion's name
in support.
By the end of the tournament, cheers for
Marion could finally be heard, scattered
across the stadium.
Ever since her appearance at the
Wimbledon finals, Bartoli has struggled
mightily to reclaim her place in the spotlight.

After Sunday's loss to Wozniak, Bartoli con
tided that she had been suffering symptoms of
mononucleosis in the earlier part of the year.
She had essentially been "Federer-ed."
We all saw how the disease impacted
Federer's game, supposed to be one of the
best of our time. Imagine what it could do to
a rising star such as Bartoli.
"Beginning of the year. I got some illness
so I was really, really tired every single day,"
Bartoli said. "It really takes all of your ener
gy. I was feeling really, really tired."
Instead of hiding behind excuses, Bartoli
played through the fatigue and has shown
glimpses of reclaiming her
Wimbledon form.
"It just makes me a stronger
player because when you're out of
energy and have to struggle all the
time, you know your limit and
you're pushing your limit further,"
Bartoli said. "I'm waking up now on
certain days, fit and ready to play."
Sure, Bartoli isn't the flashy type,
but her showing at this year's
Classic has earned her the respect
and recognition of many fans.
Her best showings prior to this
year were a quartet of second-round
finishes — marks unbefitting of a
Top-20 player.
This year was different for the
24-year-old warrior.
With her two-handed shots,
Bartoli ground down her opponents
with surprising power at times.
Even her slightly odd form proved
effective in holding serve — some
thing she has struggled with in the
past.
And finally, in an event ravaged
by numerous injuries, Bartoli would
not let her injury disappoint her fans.
Even after calling a medical
timeout, Bartoli continued and
played out her match instead of giv
ing up.
"I just wanted to give the fans a
complete match and, even if I knew
I was unable to win it, it was just
better for everyone to try and keep
-,oing to the end," Bartoli said.
The fans got what they paid for
in the end.
But over the week, perhaps it
was more than her match-play that
won over the crowd. After defeat
ing Chakvetadze, Bartoli stayed
back to sign autographs for almost
every person waiting for her,
despite just finishing her upset of

the defending champ.
After punching her ticket to the
finals on Saturday evening, instead
of rushing back to her hotel to recu
perate for the finals in less than 12
hours, Bartoli took time to play ten
nis with the Bank of the West mas
cot armed with an oversized racket.
Bartoli played along and "lost"
in a rally to the bear as part of a pro

motional giveaway for a lucky fan.
And, amidst her busy schedule,
Bartoli took time off to visit
patients at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital on campus.
During her visit, Bartoli did arts
and crafts with patients, posed for
pictures, signed autographs and
gave out Bank of the West teddy
bears. It made sense that someone

who had fought through an exhaust
ing illness might be able to inspire
others to overcome theirs as well.
"It's really disappointing for
me," she said following her finals
loss. "I was able to play some really
great tennis to be able to be in the
final. 1 thought 1 really had a shot to
win this Tier II event. But you know
it happens; each day is different.

And some days you can suffer,
which was the case for me today,
and some days are going to be bet
ter. But overall 1 think I just had a
great week.''
And by anyone's estimation, it
certainly was.

time, you know your limit and
you're pushing your limit further,"
Bartoli said. "I'm waking up now on
certain days, fit and ready to play."
Sure, Bartoli isn't the flashy type,
but her showing at this year's
Classic has earned her the respect
and recognition of many fans.
Her best showings prior to this
year were a quartet of second-round
finishes — marks unbefitting of a
Top-20 player.
This year was different for the
24-year-old warrior.
With her two-handed shots,
Bartoli ground down her opponents
with surprising power at times.
Even her slightly odd form proved
effective in holding serve — some
thing she has struggled with in the
past.
And finally, in an event ravaged
by numerous injuries, Bartoli would
not let her injury disappoint her fans.
Even after calling a medical
timeout, Bartoli continued and
played out her match instead of giv
ing up.
"I just wanted to give the fans a
complete match and, even if I knew
I was unable to win it, it was just
better for everyone to try and keep
-,oing to the end," Bartoli said.
The fans got what they paid for
in the end.
But over the week, perhaps it
was more than her match-play that
won over the crowd. After defeat
ing Chakvetadze, Bartoli stayed
back to sign autographs for almost
every person waiting for her,
despite just finishing her upset of

the defending champ.
After punching her ticket to the
finals on Saturday evening, instead
of rushing back to her hotel to recu
perate for the finals in less than 12
hours, Bartoli took time to play ten
nis with the Bank of the West mas
cot armed with an oversized racket.
Bartoli played along and "lost"
in a rally to the bear as part of a pro

motional giveaway for a lucky fan.
And, amidst her busy schedule,
Bartoli took time off to visit
patients at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital on campus.
During her visit, Bartoli did arts
and crafts with patients, posed for
pictures, signed autographs and
gave out Bank of the West teddy
bears. It made sense that someone

who had fought through an exhaust
ing illness might be able to inspire
others to overcome theirs as well.
"It's really disappointing for
me," she said following her finals
loss. "I was able to play some really
great tennis to be able to be in the
final. 1 thought 1 really had a shot to
win this Tier II event. But you know
it happens; each day is different.

And some days you can suffer,
which was the case for me today,
and some days are going to be bet
ter. But overall 1 think I just had a
great week.''
And by anyone's estimation, it
certainly was.

Marion Bartoli of France took on Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada in the final match of the Bank of the West Classic at Taube Family Tennis Stadium on
Sunday. While Bartoli fell short of taking first at the event, she showed plenty of courage in pushing through a difficult injury en route to second place.
