# BANK OF THE WEST CLASSIC
## Bartoli's warrior spirit captures hearts at Farm's Classic Marion Bartoli finishes strong, falls just short of title 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Marion Bartoli is a fighter.
The 2008 Bank of the West Classic finalist
may not have been the most famous (Serena
Williams), the oldest (Ai Sugiyama, 33), the
youngest (Michelle Larcher de Brito, 15), the
tallest (Akgul Amanmuradova, 6'3") nor the
slimmest (Daniela Hantuchova) competitor at
the event.
But, boy, is she a fighter.

Like her idol, Monica Seles, Bartoli plays

By the end of the tournament, cheers for
Marion could finally be heard, scattered
across the stadium.
Ever since her appearance at the
Wimbledon finals, Bartoli has struggled
mightily to reclaim her place in the spotlight.

After Sunday's loss to Wozniak, Bartoli con
tided that she had been suffering symptoms of
mononucleosis in the earlier part of the year.
She had essentially been "Federer-ed."
We all saw how the disease impacted
Federer's game, supposed to be one of the
best of our time. Imagine what it could do to
a rising star such as Bartoli.
"Beginning of the year. I got some illness
so I was really, really tired every single day,"
Bartoli said. "It really takes all of your ener
gy. I was feeling really, really tired."
Instead of hiding behind excuses, Bartoli
played through the fatigue and has shown
