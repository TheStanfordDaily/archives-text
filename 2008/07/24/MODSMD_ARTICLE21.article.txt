Childress makes a
splash by signing across
the pond

Former Stanford star Josh Childress, who left
the Farm after a stellar junior campaign in 2003-
04 to pursue a career in the NBA, is heading
overseas for the surprisingly greener pastures of
European basketball.
Childress, drafted sixth overall, landed with
the Hawks, where he eventually developed into
a solid sixth man for Atlanta, averaging double
digit points per game in each of his first four sea
sons in the Association. As a restricted free
agent, Childress was expected to receive plenty
of offers but eventually remain with the Hawks,
who had the right under the NBA's collective
bargaining agreement to match any contract
offered to him by another team.
We 11... by another NBA team at least.
Childress's signing with the Greek club
Olympiacos for a cool, three-year, $20 million
deal, as reported by ESPN.com yesterday, neat
ly circumvented the Hawks' rights under the
NBA salary cap, freeing him to earn more
money overseas than he could have as a pro in
America. The signing is noteworthy for going
against the grain of the traditional flow of talent,
as Europe's best players have been poached for
years by the NBA.
Now, perhaps, a trickling flow of talent could
begin heading the other way across the Atlantic.
The contract is reported to be the biggest in
Euroleague history by the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution and shortly follows top prep
recruit Brandon Jennings's decision to sign with
an Italian team rather than play for a year at
Arizona to earn his NBA draft eligibility.
Childress keyed the Cardinal's magical 30-2
2003-04 season that saw the team nearly go
undefeated for the regular season, scoring 360
points and averaging a team-best 15.7 points per
game.

Frosh Eight finish strong at
Temple Challenge Cup

The Freshmen Eight's suspenseful run
through the Henley Royal Regatta's Temple
Challenge Cup came to a halt on Saturday, as
the Cardinal was defeated by two lengths in its
semifinal race against Trinity College. Although
its successes were brought to a stop, the Frosh
Eight completed an intensive debut run at the
Henley Royal Regatta, getting a genuine taste
of competing internationally and rowing in front
of crowds of over 20,000 in the process.
"It was a tough way to end the regatta, but
the guys showed tremendous growth here in
England," frosh coach Pete Giese told
GoStanford.com. "To make it to the semifinals
of such a great international race is really an
honor and a testament to the hard work these
young men put in all year [...]. Trinity was
strong, composed and extremely well coached.
Coach Gluckman had his crew primed to race
today and they looked very strong. Our hats go
off to them."
Seventy-five boats entered the Temple
Challenge Cup this year and Stanford made it to
the final four of the draw. On its journey there,
the team defeated boats from South Africa and
England in the first two rounds, and then scored
a memorable quarterfinal victory over Cornell,
the defending varsity lightweight national cham
pion, on the Fourth of July.

Football announces preseason
schedule

The Cardinal, under second-year head coach
Jim Harbaugh, will open its 2008 preseason
football practice on Friday, Aug. 1 with a hel
met-only workout at Elliot Field beginning at
6:30 p.m. Stanford's first practice in full pads

will take place on Tuesday, Aug. 5, while the
first of four two-a-day workouts will begin on
Aug. 7.
Included in the agenda of the 29-practice
schedule leading up to the season-opener
against Oregon State on Aug. 28 are two scrim
mages, one on Aug. 14 at 3 p.m. and the other
on Aug. 19 at 6 p.m.
Returning to Stanford's team this season are
20 starters (nine on offense and 11 on defense)
and 43 letter winners (24 on offense, 18 on
defense and a specialist). The Cardinal will be
looking to improve on its four-win campaign of
'07.
Although the 2007 season was not full of suc
cesses, the squad did make notable progress
from the previous season's 1-11 finish.
Harbaugh's first year at the helm of the
Cardinal program included signature victories
over then-top-ranked Southern California —
touted on Stanford t-shirts everywhere as the

"Biggest Upset Ever" — and defending Pac-10
Conference co-champion California.
Stanford opens the 2008 regular season on
Aug. 28 against Oregon State at Stanford
Stadium. Other home dates are scheduled
against San Jose State (Sept. 20), Arizona (Oct.
11 — Homecoming), UCLA (Oct. 18), Oregon
(Nov. 8) and Cal (Nov. 22).
