# Norman steals the show again
## 
### 
The clouds loomed and the
wind blew. The rain fell down
and the scores shot up. The
grass wasn't a beautiful shade of
green and the TV telecast seldom
could follow the ball. And on top of
it all, golf's biggest name was miss
ing. What were we to expect? It was
supposed to be lackluster and un
exciting, like a French Open without
Rafael Nadal, the NBA Finals with
KG and Kobe riding the bench, like
a Major without Tiger Woods.
Oh, wait. It was a Major without
Tiger Woods.
The inevitable happened. We had
to experience this year's British
Open without Tiger. A Major with
out the game's single most dominat
ing force, most recognizable face
and fiercest competitor. Every ana
lyst from one coast to the next was
saying that the third Major of the
year just wouldn't be the same with
out Woods in the field.
But you know what? It didn't
stink. It actually turned out great. In
fact, I enjoyed the Open just as
much as a Major with Tiger because
of one player and one storyline that
made the weekend exciting and
memorable: Greg Norman.
The 53-year-old shark plays more
tennis these days than golf. He was
all but done with full-time competi
tion nearly 10 years ago. Yet he
showed up to Royal Birkdale with a
lifetime exemption to play and noth
ing to lose but a lew golf balls.
And he almost won the whole
darn thing.
It was great to sec Norman in the
hunt the whole tournament. The
opening two rounds brought reac
tions ranging from shock ("Really?
Greg Norman on the first page of
the leaderboard?") to pleasantly
surprised ("All right! Greg Norman
is winning!") to outright skepticism
("That won't last; that's just one of
those guys who plays well one day
and will be out of it tomorrow").
We had to wait until after the
first-round hullabaloo to see who
started separating themselves from
the pack. We thought Adam Scott,
ranked No. 3 in the world, would
continue to play well into the week
end. We thought Rocco Mediate
would pick up where he left off at
the U.S. Open. We thought Greg
Norman might fall off the leader
board. We thought this tournament
was going to get lower ratings than
Sunday morning cartoons.
Boy, did we think wrong.
Norman had a smile on his face
throughout the whole weekend and
was relaxed and jovial. He chatted
with his playing partners. He even
helped up a cameraman who fell
down a hill trying to film him. While
the big names and likely contenders
were folding, Norman played steady
and was at the top the entire time.
And I don't even feel sorry for
him that he lost the two-shot lead he
