# Norman steals the show again
## 
### 
The clouds loomed and the
wind blew. The rain fell down
and the scores shot up. The
grass wasn't a beautiful shade of
green and the TV telecast seldom
could follow the ball. And on top of
it all, golf's biggest name was miss
ing. What were we to expect? It was
supposed to be lackluster and un
exciting, like a French Open without
Rafael Nadal, the NBA Finals with
KG and Kobe riding the bench, like
a Major without Tiger Woods.
Oh, wait. It was a Major without
Tiger Woods.
The inevitable happened. We had
to experience this year's British
Open without Tiger. A Major with
out the game's single most dominat
ing force, most recognizable face
and fiercest competitor. Every ana
lyst from one coast to the next was
saying that the third Major of the
year just wouldn't be the same with
out Woods in the field.
But you know what? It didn't
stink. It actually turned out great. In
fact, I enjoyed the Open just as
much as a Major with Tiger because
of one player and one storyline that
made the weekend exciting and
memorable: Greg Norman.
The 53-year-old shark plays more
tennis these days than golf. He was
all but done with full-time competi
tion nearly 10 years ago. Yet he
showed up to Royal Birkdale with a
lifetime exemption to play and noth
ing to lose but a lew golf balls.
And he almost won the whole
darn thing.
It was great to sec Norman in the
hunt the whole tournament. The
opening two rounds brought reac
tions ranging from shock ("Really?
Greg Norman on the first page of
the leaderboard?") to pleasantly
surprised ("All right! Greg Norman
is winning!") to outright skepticism
("That won't last; that's just one of
those guys who plays well one day
and will be out of it tomorrow").
We had to wait until after the
first-round hullabaloo to see who
started separating themselves from
the pack. We thought Adam Scott,
ranked No. 3 in the world, would
continue to play well into the week
end. We thought Rocco Mediate
would pick up where he left off at
the U.S. Open. We thought Greg
Norman might fall off the leader
board. We thought this tournament
was going to get lower ratings than
Sunday morning cartoons.
Boy, did we think wrong.
Norman had a smile on his face
throughout the whole weekend and
was relaxed and jovial. He chatted
with his playing partners. He even
helped up a cameraman who fell
down a hill trying to film him. While
the big names and likely contenders
were folding, Norman played steady
and was at the top the entire time.
And I don't even feel sorry for
him that he lost the two-shot lead he
had going into Sunday. I honestly
didn't expect him to hold on. Four
days of golf in treacherous condi
tions, walking 72 holes and bearing
Britain's brutal winds, is not easy for
a 53-year-old. Though I was disap
pointed he didn't shoot a little better
on Sunday, he gave an honest effort
and it was enjoyable to watch.
So sure, he didn't win it all. But I
don't like reading that people are
putting this blown lead right up
there with his other blown leads in
Majors. Those are a thing of the past
and this time is different.
Norman was on no one's radar
before the tournament and I'm sure
few saw him even making the cut.
I'm absolutely positive if you asked
him on the first tee on Thursday
where he thought he'd finish, the
answer would not have been third
place. He played above expectations

and held his form for nearly the
entire tournament. We can't say the
same about Phil Mickleson, Ernie
Els or Sergio Garcia, can we?
It was fun to wake up at 6 a.m.
Pacific Standard lime on Saturday
and Sunday and see Norman near
the lead. I was rooting for his shots
to hit the fairway, for his putts to go
in. I was rooting for golfers close to
him to blow up, fold, choke, make
triple-bogey — whatever it took to
leave Norman on top.
But Padraig Harrington played
great the whole weekend and like a
true champion on the final day. I
won't discredit his championship
because it was very well deserved
and hard-earned. But when people
think back to this Open or see it on
the highlight reel, I can guarantee
the first thing that will pop into their
heads will be Norman and his
incredible run.
True, he didn't have quite
enough to finish on Sunday. But
hey, that's okay. He showed the
world that he can still play and
injected a bit of uncertainty back

into golf. He followed Rocco
Mediate's old-guy-going-for-the
championship-against-young-guns
script and made it his own. He had
golf fans all over the world watching
and believing that he could really
pull it off.
In short, Greg Norman made this
year's Biitish Open. I will forever
remember watching him give the
tournament some life and some "No
way!" moments. 1 will also remem
ber forgetting about Tiger Woods
for four days, while watching
Norman come so close to becoming
golf's oldest Major Championship
winner.
Speaking of Tiger, do you think
his knee will be ready for the PGA?
But wait — here might be an
even bigger question out there.
With a third place finish, Norman
earned a spot in next year's Masters.
Do you think he'll show up?

without Tiger can be exciting, too.

him that he lost the two-shot lead he
had going into Sunday. I honestly
didn't expect him to hold on. Four
days of golf in treacherous condi
tions, walking 72 holes and bearing
Britain's brutal winds, is not easy for
a 53-year-old. Though I was disap
pointed he didn't shoot a little better
on Sunday, he gave an honest effort
and it was enjoyable to watch.
So sure, he didn't win it all. But I
don't like reading that people are
putting this blown lead right up
there with his other blown leads in
Majors. Those are a thing of the past
and this time is different.
Norman was on no one's radar
before the tournament and I'm sure
few saw him even making the cut.
I'm absolutely positive if you asked
him on the first tee on Thursday
where he thought he'd finish, the
answer would not have been third
place. He played above expectations

and held his form for nearly the
entire tournament. We can't say the
same about Phil Mickleson, Ernie
Els or Sergio Garcia, can we?
It was fun to wake up at 6 a.m.
Pacific Standard lime on Saturday
and Sunday and see Norman near
the lead. I was rooting for his shots
to hit the fairway, for his putts to go
in. I was rooting for golfers close to
him to blow up, fold, choke, make
triple-bogey — whatever it took to
leave Norman on top.
But Padraig Harrington played
great the whole weekend and like a
true champion on the final day. I
won't discredit his championship
because it was very well deserved
and hard-earned. But when people
think back to this Open or see it on
the highlight reel, I can guarantee
the first thing that will pop into their
heads will be Norman and his
incredible run.
True, he didn't have quite
enough to finish on Sunday. But
hey, that's okay. He showed the
world that he can still play and
injected a bit of uncertainty back

into golf. He followed Rocco
Mediate's old-guy-going-for-the
championship-against-young-guns
script and made it his own. He had
golf fans all over the world watching
and believing that he could really
pull it off.
In short, Greg Norman made this
year's Biitish Open. I will forever
remember watching him give the
tournament some life and some "No
way!" moments. 1 will also remem
ber forgetting about Tiger Woods
for four days, while watching
Norman come so close to becoming
golf's oldest Major Championship
winner.
Speaking of Tiger, do you think
his knee will be ready for the PGA?
But wait — here might be an
even bigger question out there.
With a third place finish, Norman
earned a spot in next year's Masters.
Do you think he'll show up?

Danny Bclcli is realizing that golf
without Tiger can be exciting, too.
