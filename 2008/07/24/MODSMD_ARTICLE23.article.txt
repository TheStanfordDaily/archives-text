# Goodell keeping tabs on the Pack
## Urges Green Bay to deal with Favre now 
### CHRIS JENKINS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MILWAUKEE (AP) — NFL
commissioner Roger Goodell is
monitoring the ongoing rift
between the Green Bay Packers
and Brett Favre.
A person with direct knowledge
of Goodell's interest said the com
missioner has spoken with Packers
management several times recent
ly as tensions mounted between
the three-time MVP and his team.
The person spoke on condition
of anonymity because of the sensi
tivity of the talks.
ESPN.com first reported
Goodell's interest in the Favre
predicament, indicating that
Goodell encouraged Packers gen
eral manager Ted Thompson to
survey teams around the league to
try to find a trade partner in hopes
of resolving it quickly.
With the Packers committed to
moving forward with Aaron
Rodgers as their starter and Favre
apparently still intent on reversing
his decision to retire in March -
although there have been no
reports that Favre has formally
petitioned Goodell for reinstate
ment - the best outcome for both
parties could be a trade.
And Tampa Bay is emerging as
perhaps the most likely destination
for Favre, although it is unclear
whether Favre would be willing to
play for the Buccaneers.
NFL.com reported Tuesday
that the Packers had spoken to
several teams to gauge their inter
est in a trade for Favre. Tampa
Bay officials have publicly down
played interest in trading for
Favre, but Buccaneers quarter

back Chris Simms told the St.
Petersburg Times that Bucs gener
al manager Bruce Allen asked him
about Favre last week.
"He asked if I felt Brett would
be able to come back and be good
here if he didn't have a lot of reps
in training camp," Simms said,
according to the paper. "I said I
thought he would but there would
have to be some compromise with
coach (Jon) Gruden. He'll just
want the play called and to drop
back and throw it in there. But it's
something we talked about."
Gruden was a Packers assistant
coach from 1992-94 and runs a ver
sion of the West Coast offense
Favre would be familiar with.
The Packers play the
Buccaneers Sept. 28 in Tampa.
Chicago Bears linebacker Brian
Urlacher said he "can't imagine"
seeing Favre anywhere other than
Green Bay, but isn't surprised that
he wants to play again.
"He loves football, and 1 think
he kind of made the decision when
the season was over," Urlacher
said. "He was tired, he probably
was worn down, like he said and he
made a decision that he didn't
want to stick with. But he's Brett
Favre, he can do whatever he
wants. 1 don't know what's going
to happen, but I would like to see
him playing somewhere next
year."
But Urlacher said Chicago
wasn't a likely destination for
Favre.
"For us? I don't think that's a
possibility," Urlacher said. "II they
do trade him, I don't think it's
going to be in our division, No. 1.
Maybe not even in our confer
ence."
Favre made an appearance at
Lambeau Field on Saturday to
present former teammate Frank
Winters for induction to the
Packers' Hall of Fame, but

declined to discuss his rift with the
team. Favre accepted a team MVP
award that night, calling himself
"an old, gray-haired quarterback
showing 1 can still do it."
Favre retired in early March,
but recently has been having sec
ond thoughts about playing in
2008. But the latest, and most
intense, episode in several offsea
sons' worth of Favre's flip-flopping
on his future in football was met
with lukewarm enthusiasm by the
Packers, who spent the offseason
planning to move forward with
Rodgers.
Favre asked to be released from
his contract, a request the team has
no plans to grant. The next step for
Favre could be to petition Goodell
for reinstatement, a move that
would force the Packers to release
him or place him on their active
roster. He also could be traded.
The Packers also have filed
tampering charges against the
Minnesota Vikings, suspecting
that interest from the Vikings is
the main reason Favre has
changed his mind about playing in
2008.
Favre's rights belong to the
Packers until his current contract
expires after the 2010 season.
In an interview with Fox News
last week, Favre criticized
Thompson for being untruthful
with him. Packers officials have
gone out of their way not to criti
cize Favre, instead laying out a
specific timeline of their dealings
with him in the offseason in hopes
that fans will understand why the
team decided to move forward
without No. 4.
The most significant episode in
their timeline came in late March,
when Favre led the Packers to
believe he was going to unretire
and they were prepared to wel
come him back - only to change his
mind once again and stay retired.
