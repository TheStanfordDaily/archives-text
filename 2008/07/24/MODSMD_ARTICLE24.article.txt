## Forecasting the future of a wild MLB second half 
### 
With baseball just a few days
past the All-Star break,
now is the perfect time to
look back at some of the interesting
games and performances of the first
half. It's also the perfect time for us
armchair experts to throw away our
hideously inaccurate preseason pre
dictions (Tigers? Rays? Indians?),
and make what we hope are educat
ed guesses about the 2008 postsea
son.
But first, a look back at the first
half that was.
Two very different no-no's: It's
hard to forget about Jon Lester's
recovery from cancer and his no-hit
ter for the Red Sox against Kansas
City on May 19, and it is certainly
the most inspiring single-game
achievement from the season to
date.
The other no-hitter, coming just a
month ago on June 28, was a bit
more unconventional. Not only was
it a tandem effort for the Angels
(Jered Weaver and Jose
Arredondo), but the Angels also lost
that game 1-0 when the Dodgers
produced an unearned run on an
error, a stolen base, another error
and a sacrifice fly. In fact, some
won't even admit it was a no-hitter
since the Angels never pitched in the
ninth inning.
Catch — and throw?: On July 6,
Seattle's back-up catcher, Jamie
Burke, became the first catcher since
1901 to receive a decision in a game.
The M's were out of pitchers in the
15th inning and sent Burke out to
the hill. He allowed a single run, and
Seattle lost 2-1 to Detroit, but other
wise pitched fairly well, allowing just
one hit and one walk while getting
three outs.
And now, on to the postseason
predictions:
NL East: New York Mets. Sure it
took winning 10 in a row to climb
back into the division, and Pedro's
return hasn't helped at all, but the
Mets have a lot going for them. The
offense seems to be waking up and
Johan Santana, who has been solid
everywhere but in wins, has usually
been more of a second-half pitcher.
The Phillies should give the Mets a
good run right to the end, but I like
New York because they have been
fantastic at Shea and have mostly
home games down the stretch.
NL Central: Chicago Cubs. The
Cardinals are the feistiest team in
the NL and the Brewers landed a big
arm in CC Sabathia, but the Cubs
are just too balanced to drop the ball
in this division. Even before adding
Harden, the Cubs were the clear
favorite. They have scored the most
and allowed the third fewest runs in
the NL. Indeed, at the break the
Cubs had outscored their opponents
by 106 runs, the best margin in base
ball. That kind of offensive produc
tion paired with quality pitching is
hard to beat.
NL West: LA Dodgers. Based on
the first half, not a single team in
this division deserves a playoff spot,
and at the break no team in the

West was above .500. Still, someone
has to make it and I'll take the
Dodgers because of their pitching.
Whoever takes this division may
very well do it with a losing record.
AL East: Boston Red Sox. I
know, I know. Everyone wants the
Rays in the postseason, and 1 do
too. But Boston can match rota
tions with the Rays, has a much
better situation at closer and can
put up runs seemingly without
limit. I don't see the defending
champs losing the division, but
Tampa Bay is still my favorite for
the wild card. Watch out for some
September magic from the
Yankees, though, in the final weeks
of their stadium.
AL Central: Chicago White Sox.
Barely. 1 give the Twins a 49 per-

cent chance here and the Sox a 51
percent shot. This division is going
to come down to which team's hit
ters hold it together longer. The
Sox depend on aging sluggers
Thome and Konerko, and if either
falters for long, the South Siders
are in trouble. The Twins have All-
Stars Morneau and Mauer in the
middle of the order, but depend on
production from a platoon of
young, fast, overachieving hitters.
If the little guys in Minnesota come
back to Earth, the Twinkies have
little hope for this year.
AL West: LA Angels. If Oakland
didn't trade away half its rotation,
they might have a real shot, but
apparently embracing "Moneyball"
is more important than chasing
October to Billy Beane. The Angels
have solid pitching, a closer
approaching the single-season saves
record and a solid, if not overpower
ing, offense. The division is weak
this year and the Angels should take
it without much excitement down
the stretch.

Erik Adams had better watch out or
Billy Beane might trade him, too.
