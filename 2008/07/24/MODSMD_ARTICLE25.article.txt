GRIM SMILE: The late Heath Ledger delivers a chillingly good performance in the latest installment of the Batman franchise. "The Dark Knight" smashed box office records by bringing in over
$158 million last weekend, the largest opening weekend of any film ever. "Knight" is the sixth, well technically seventh, film in the popular series that has featured four different actors as the Bat.
