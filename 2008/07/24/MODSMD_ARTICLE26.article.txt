# AT THE MOVIES
## THE 						BATMAN LEGACY CONTINUES "Knight" breathes life into a franchise that has seen worse days 
### KYLE EVALDEZ 
After a monstrous opening this past week
end, it is clear that one caped crusader reigns
supreme. We're talking about none other
than Batman here, whose "Dark Knight"
opened with a jaw-dropping $158 million,
karate chopping Spider-Man from his lofty
perch (sorry, Toby) for the title of largest
opening weekend ("Spider-Man 3" made only
$151 million on its first run). Of course, the
road to the top wasn't all that easy for our
dark crusader, and it's an interesting topic of
discussion — not only to marvel at his evolu
tion, but to also see if wc can learn a bit about
where he is heading.
The first true graphic novel adaptation of
the series came in the form of "Batman,"
released in 1989 (we'll forgo the 1966 Batman
film since it was based off of the Adam West
television show). The film's director was none
other than the imaginative Tim Burton.
Michael Keaton donned the legendary role as
he squared off with the maniacal Joker,
played by Jack Nicholson. The film did well
on the whole, grossing over $200 million
domestically, and was hailed for its amazing
visuals, as well as Nicholson's portrayal of the
sinister clown.
Three short years later, in 1992, "Batman
Returns" was released. Both Burton and
Keaton reprised their respective roles and
were highly augmented by Danny DeVito as
the Penguin and the sexy Michelle Pfieffer as

Catwoman. Burton spent a great deal more
focus on developing all of the characters and
their psyches, adding to the story's overall
mood and making the film an honorable
sequel. Unfortunately, despite this film's vast
improvements, it only earned approximately
$162 million domestically — a financial suc
cess, but the first sign that the franchise could
already be waning.
Pushing the Batman franchise forward.
"Batman Forever" was released in
1995, making it the third install-

ment to the series. Hoping to
take this "threequel" in a

different direction, Joel
Schumacher was on
board as director,
while Val Kilmer
took on the dua
identity of Bruc
Wayne/Batman
Even though the,
were supported by ai.

all-star cast — Jim
Carrey, Nicole Kidman,
Chris O'Donnell, and

Tommy Lee Jones — the film was
panned critically. The movie

failed to achieve the same dark mood that
Burton had mastered, and grossed approxi
mately $184 million domestically.
Similar to Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher
got his chance at round two when he helmed
the series' fourth installment, "Batman and
Robin," in 1997. Chris O'Donnell reprised his
role as the sidekick Robin, while suave actor
George Clooney tried his hand as the bat.
Unlike Burton, however, Schumacher failed to
improve upon the many flaws of his predeces

sor film, and "Batman and Robin" was torn to
shreds by critics and fans alike. The film was
plagued by campy, over-the-top sequences,
bad acting and a questionable focus on the bat
costumes' nipples (see the film if you don't
know what I'm talking about). With all of
these factors in place, this film only made
about $107 million domestically, and earned
itself the title of the worst Batman film to date,

both on a financial and critical scale.
Much to the dismay of fans and
admirers alike, the Batman

franchise seemed
exhausted and worn

out. However, with
'he series ending on
\ barely audible

vhisper, fans and
Jollywood offi
ials prayed for
mother film out
ng that would
nally do the char-

jter and franchise
astice. These prayers

vvere finally answered
eight years later in 2005 when
the masked hero made his way

back to the screen in "Batman Begins," writ
ten and directed by Christopher Nolan. The
hiatus proved to be invaluable in that it
allowed the entire franchise to be re-concep
tualized and revamped. The city of Gotham
finally had a life of its own, along with its citi
zens and villains. Christian Bale was finally
able to add depth to Batman by paying more
focus on his alter ego ... Bruce Wayne. These
added layers not only made his character
more well-rounded, but it also made his tran

sition into the Bat that much more believable
and scary. The 2005 version brought new
vision and talent into the franchise and man
aged to garner about $205 million from the
domestic box office, a heroic feat indeed.
With all of the success of Nolan's Batman,
a sequel was inevitable and barely one week
ago, the much-anticipated "Dark Knight" hit
the masses. Without going into a full review of
the film, one can easily say that Nolan's latest
film is a Batman masterpiece, fully deserving
its massive $158 million take on its first week
end. At this rate, it wouldn't be too presump
tuous to say that this is going to be the most
successful Batman film yet.
There are several traceable threads through
the Batman series. If you paid close attention
to the details, you might have noticed that the
series has changed directors three times, with
each director only making two films. This con
stant change-off broke up the series' continu
ity, in that the movies play off of each other in
pairs. Tim Burton's two Batman films go
together but are separate from Joel
Schumacher's versions, and the cycle goes on.
If Chris Nolan chooses to do a third film, he
will be breaking precedence, but the real issue
is whether or not a third should even be made.
"Dark Knight" is truly a wondrous spectacle,
and it makes one wonder if a third film could
ever outdo it. Logistically, a third film would
already be at a disadvantage since the late
Heath Ledger will not be able to reprise his
character of the Joker, a role that many are
hailing as a masterpiece performance. Besides
for this factor, threequels are always a huge
challenge — just look at the third "Spider-

The Stanford Daily
Man," "X-Men" and "Pirates of the
Caribbean" films, and you will see a
trend here. Third films often fail to
live up to the standards of their pre

deccssors. Even with Chris Nolan at
the helm, would it really be wise to
tempt history?
Looking at the series as a whole,
"Dark Knight" rounds out the col
lection of Batman films, and acts as
an amazing capstone to a franchise
that has spanned across almost two
decades. Regardless of what hap
pens from here on out, the series
can easily end on the fantastic note

that "Dark Knight" has set, or it can
continue to make Batman the
longest running superhero franchise
on the market. Quoting the charac
ter Harvey Dent, "The night is
always darkest before the dawn."
Has this series finally seen the light?
I think so.

eight years later in 2005 when
the masked hero made his way

back to the screen in "Batman Begins," writ
ten and directed by Christopher Nolan. The
hiatus proved to be invaluable in that it
allowed the entire franchise to be re-concep
tualized and revamped. The city of Gotham
finally had a life of its own, along with its citi
zens and villains. Christian Bale was finally
able to add depth to Batman by paying more
focus on his alter ego ... Bruce Wayne. These
added layers not only made his character
more well-rounded, but it also made his tran

sition into the Bat that much more believable
and scary. The 2005 version brought new
vision and talent into the franchise and man
aged to garner about $205 million from the
domestic box office, a heroic feat indeed.
With all of the success of Nolan's Batman,
a sequel was inevitable and barely one week
ago, the much-anticipated "Dark Knight" hit
the masses. Without going into a full review of
the film, one can easily say that Nolan's latest
film is a Batman masterpiece, fully deserving
its massive $158 million take on its first week
end. At this rate, it wouldn't be too presump
tuous to say that this is going to be the most
successful Batman film yet.
There are several traceable threads through
the Batman series. If you paid close attention
to the details, you might have noticed that the
series has changed directors three times, with
each director only making two films. This con
stant change-off broke up the series' continu
ity, in that the movies play off of each other in
pairs. Tim Burton's two Batman films go
together but are separate from Joel
Schumacher's versions, and the cycle goes on.
If Chris Nolan chooses to do a third film, he
will be breaking precedence, but the real issue
is whether or not a third should even be made.
"Dark Knight" is truly a wondrous spectacle,
and it makes one wonder if a third film could
ever outdo it. Logistically, a third film would
already be at a disadvantage since the late
Heath Ledger will not be able to reprise his
character of the Joker, a role that many are
hailing as a masterpiece performance. Besides
for this factor, threequels are always a huge
challenge — just look at the third "Spider-

Man," "X-Men" and "Pirates of the
Caribbean" films, and you will see a
trend here. Third films often fail to
live up to the standards of their pre

deccssors. Even with Chris Nolan at
the helm, would it really be wise to
tempt history?
Looking at the series as a whole,
"Dark Knight" rounds out the col
lection of Batman films, and acts as
an amazing capstone to a franchise
that has spanned across almost two
decades. Regardless of what hap
pens from here on out, the series
can easily end on the fantastic note

that "Dark Knight" has set, or it can
continue to make Batman the
longest running superhero franchise
on the market. Quoting the charac
ter Harvey Dent, "The night is
always darkest before the dawn."
Has this series finally seen the light?
I think so.

After a monstrous opening this past week
end, it is clear that one caped crusader reigns
supreme. We're talking about none other
than Batman here, whose "Dark Knight"
opened with a jaw-dropping $158 million,
karate chopping Spider-Man from his lofty
perch (sorry, Toby) for the title of largest
opening weekend ("Spider-Man 3" made only
$151 million on its first run). Of course, the
road to the top wasn't all that easy for our
dark crusader, and it's an interesting topic of
discussion — not only to marvel at his evolu
tion, but to also see if wc can learn a bit about
where he is heading.
The first true graphic novel adaptation of
the series came in the form of "Batman,"
released in 1989 (we'll forgo the 1966 Batman
film since it was based off of the Adam West
television show). The film's director was none
other than the imaginative Tim Burton.
Michael Keaton donned the legendary role as
he squared off with the maniacal Joker,
played by Jack Nicholson. The film did well
on the whole, grossing over $200 million
domestically, and was hailed for its amazing
visuals, as well as Nicholson's portrayal of the
sinister clown.
Three short years later, in 1992, "Batman
Returns" was released. Both Burton and
Keaton reprised their respective roles and
were highly augmented by Danny DeVito as
the Penguin and the sexy Michelle Pfieffer as

Catwoman. Burton spent a great deal more
focus on developing all of the characters and
their psyches, adding to the story's overall
mood and making the film an honorable
sequel. Unfortunately, despite this film's vast
improvements, it only earned approximately
$162 million domestically — a financial suc
cess, but the first sign that the franchise could
already be waning.
Pushing the Batman franchise forward.
"Batman Forever" was released in
1995, making it the third install-

ment to the series. Hoping to
take this "threequel" in a

different direction, Joel
Schumacher was on
board as director,
while Val Kilmer
took on the dua
identity of Bruc
Wayne/Batman
Even though the,
were supported by ai.

all-star cast — Jim
Carrey, Nicole Kidman,
Chris O'Donnell, and

Tommy Lee Jones — the film was
panned critically. The movie

failed to achieve the same dark mood that
Burton had mastered, and grossed approxi
mately $184 million domestically.
Similar to Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher
got his chance at round two when he helmed
the series' fourth installment, "Batman and
Robin," in 1997. Chris O'Donnell reprised his
role as the sidekick Robin, while suave actor
George Clooney tried his hand as the bat.
Unlike Burton, however, Schumacher failed to
improve upon the many flaws of his predeces

sor film, and "Batman and Robin" was torn to
shreds by critics and fans alike. The film was
plagued by campy, over-the-top sequences,
bad acting and a questionable focus on the bat
costumes' nipples (see the film if you don't
know what I'm talking about). With all of
these factors in place, this film only made
about $107 million domestically, and earned
itself the title of the worst Batman film to date,

both on a financial and critical scale.
Much to the dismay of fans and
admirers alike, the Batman

franchise seemed
exhausted and worn

out. However, with
'he series ending on

vhisper, fans and
Jollywood offi
ials prayed for
