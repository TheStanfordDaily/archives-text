# AT THE MOVIES
## "Step Brothers" a classic Ferrell flick: dumb, but fun 
### MARY LIZ MCCURDY 
What do you get when you combine "40-
Year-Old Virgin" and "Dumb & Dumber"
with the dynamic duo from the summer hit
"Talladega Nights"? This summer, Will
Ferrell and John C. Reilly star together again
in "Step Brothers," another crude comedy.
In the likely plotline, a successful older
doctor falls for an attractive woman. In the
midst of their passionate "hook-up" they each
manage to unload their dirty laundry: They
both have 40-year-old sons living at home.
Once they discover their bizarre commonali
ty, the movie jumps quickly to the couple's
seemingly fated marriage and they move in
together with their free-loading sons.
Like any normal siblings, these 40-year-olds
act no different than 10-year-old brothers, with
stunted maturity levels. At first they have a
rocky start, but soon enough they become insep
arable after recognizing their similar hatred

for Brennan's
(Ferrell) younger
brother, Derrick
(played by Adam
Scott). In spite of
this, the cama
raderie these two
build over nranks

'Step Brothers'
Dir. Adam McKay

and their gluttonous lifestyles tests the strength
of their parents' marriage. Eventually the
"boys" arc faced with the ultimate challenge:
learning to grow up.
Ultimately the story poses a serious exis
tential question: Why are we in such a rush to
grow up? These two pranksters, when turned
into conservative men, prove wearing a suit is
not the answer to happiness.
This gruff 90-ininute comedy is generally
filled with basic slapstick, sexual references,
sophomoric humor and a few hysterical one-
liners. The beginning and end are
loaded with accessible humor, while
the middle falls flat, Huffed up with
cussing, less witty jokes and weaker
writing. The story was cute and easy
to follow, even though the over
whelming crudeness took away from
the overall storyline.
Want a sneak preview of what

the actors were like? Well, you can
bet Ferrell and Reilly show limited
character development, similar to
their roles in "Talladega Nights." In
what little change there is, it's very
predictable and within the foreseen
boundaries of their characters. The
stepbrothers were consistently silly
throughout the movie, acting like
immature boys. Though not much
of a surprise from the Talladega
duo, "Step Brothers" delivers
exactly what an audience would
expect from a summer comedy: stu
pid humor from their favorite
comedians.

If you thoroughly enjoyed Ferrcll
and Reilly in "Talladega Nights," or
liked Ferrell from "Old School" and
"Blades of Glory," see this movie in
the theaters ASAP. Conversely, if
those movies aren't your favorites,
wait to see this on DVD at home.
Until then, save the $20 for you and
your date and think about what it
would be like to see Will Ferrell and
John C. Reilly act as perverted
teenage boys. It's not that hard to
imagine.
