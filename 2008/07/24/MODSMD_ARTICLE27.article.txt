## "Step Brothers" a classic Ferrell flick: dumb, but fun

What do you get when you combine "40-
Year-Old Virgin" and "Dumb & Dumber"
with the dynamic duo from the summer hit
"Talladega Nights"? This summer, Will
Ferrell and John C. Reilly star together again
in "Step Brothers," another crude comedy.
In the likely plotline, a successful older
doctor falls for an attractive woman. In the
midst of their passionate "hook-up" they each
manage to unload their dirty laundry: They
both have 40-year-old sons living at home.
Once they discover their bizarre commonali

seemingly fated marriage and they move in
together with their free-loading sons.
Like any normal siblings, these 40-year-olds
act no different than 10-year-old brothers, with
stunted maturity levels. At first they have a
rocky start, but soon enough they become insep
arable after recognizing their similar hatred

for Brennan's
(Ferrell) younger
brother, Derrick
(played by Adam
Scott). In spite of
this, the cama

and their gluttonous lifestyles tests the strength

into conservative men, prove wearing a suit is
not the answer to happiness.
This gruff 90-ininute comedy is generally
filled with basic slapstick, sexual references,
sophomoric humor and a few hysterical one-
