## Cyrus struggles to "Breakout" of mold 
### PAUL CRAFT 
As a 21-year old male, I expected to
thoroughly dislike Miley's Cyrus's latest
album, "Breakout." Well, in some respects,
Miley met my expectations: It's a bland and
silly album. In other ways, though, the pre
teen idol pleasantly surprised me, namely
with her sheer star presence.
I, admittedly, am not her natural demo
graphic. Her tales of girl-bonding, crushes
and text-message drama don't resonate
with me. Her songs are designed to express
the huge, mixed-up emotions of a teenage
girl. For instance, her anguished ballad,
"Simple Song" never even bothers to pin
point the source of her emotional turmoil.
Instead, the whole wide world confuses her,
and sends her looking for salvation in a
"simple song." I can imagine, however, that
angst that vague will strike a chord with a
15-year-old girl.
Her hit. "7 Things," meanwhile, is a frus
trated rant about the seven things — or
eight or 11, depending on how you keep
count — she hates about her beau. The song
is oddly both empowered and reactionary.
Cyrus is strong enough to tell off somebody
who hurt her, but not really strong enough
to let him go. At the end of the song, she
begins listing the seven things that she likes
about the guy. Isn't love confusing?
And then there's Cyrus's powerful polit
ical message. "Wake Up America" is a plea
to save America's environment. To begin
her case, Cyrus concedes that she doesn't
know what she's talking about: "Everything
I read/Is Global Warming/Going Green/I
don't knowAVhat it all means." Then, with
that out of the way, she goes on to demand
immediate action: "Wake up
America/Tomorrow becomes a new
day/Everything you do matters/In some
way." If this song doesn't get our nation's
act together, I don't know what will.
In the end, when listening to a pop artist
like Miley Cyrus, it's difficult to distinguish her
art from her commerce. The songs are well
crafted and catchy to a fault; the album comes
off as a generic chords and plastic vocals des

tined to be a travel montage in her TV show.
But Cyrus delivers them with enough skill and
pep that you almost forgive her.
