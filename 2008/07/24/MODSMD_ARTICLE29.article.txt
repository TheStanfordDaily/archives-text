# Trippy Sic Alps borrow from 60's
## 
### 
For the past two years, the San Francisco
band Sic Alps has been periodically releas
ing HP's and singles. Now they have conve
niently presented all these tracks together in
an excellent compilation, "A Long Way
Around a Shortcut." The band is a noisy
combination of the modern indie rock sound
and 1960's psychedelic rock.
For music fans with some tolerance for
dissonance and experimentation, Sic Alps
is a great band to check out. Their new disc
consists of over two dozen short songs, with
the newest material placed earliest. The
new song, "Description of the Harbor
(Strapping Field Hands)" begins as a ram
shackle piano ballad and then slowly
descends into noise: creaks, groans and
howls. Similar interludes of pure noise
punctuate, but don't dominate, the album.
Instead, the Sic Alps deliver mostly
woozy, old-fashioned garage rock songs
that manage to straddle the line between
classic pop structures and complete chaos.
"Dr. Bag and the Pomade Nature Giants"
is driven by a lurching, high-wire drum
beat and reverb-drenched vocals. Another
track, "Latin," is mostly distortion and
drums, but still manages to include a
catchy lead vocal hook before disappear
ing into a haze of feedback.
Two of the most accessible songs are
"Strawberry Guillotine" —no doubt an
ode to the hippie classic, "Strawberry
Alarm Clock" — and "Message from the
Law." The former track weaves some anti
war imagery over a marshal beat: "Into the
future with you/Down in a watery
graveAVith a commanding view." "Message
From the Law" sports a Beatles-like guitar
line and some nice vocal harmonies.
Sic Alps is certainly in debt to the 1960's
San Francisco values of trippy sounds, jan
gly guitars and political consciousness. But
they are talented enough to take these clas
sic features and make them their own noisy
creation.
