# OUT OF THE BUBBLE
## Farmers markets ripe for summer 
### LISA WALLACE DAILY VISITING INTERN 
It is Sunday at noon, and the California sun
shine warms shoppers as they peruse the fruit
and vegetable stalls at the farmers market off
El Camino. Green, crisp lettuce, plump toma
toes and juicy peaches are just a few of the
fresh organic products available at the market,
one of several located in the area.
"Eating local" is a trend with momentum.
Local farmers markets support California agri
culture and ensure customers the freshest
selection of produce. The markets create a
space for real farmers to interact with urban
consumers, cutting out middlemen and making
for cheaper products. Selling locally is benefi
cial to farmers, too: It allows them to sell the
ripest fruits and vegetables (too fragile to ship
off in bulk) and to sell in smaller quantities, in
a venue other than one for large, corporate
distributors.
There are many farmers markets close to
Stanford, but the closest one is on the corner of
El Camino and California Avenue. Easily with
in biking distance (extra green points!), it's only
about a mile from the end of Palm Drive — a
perfect location for hungry Stanford students to
grab some yummy produce.
Every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., the
farmers' market on California Ave. is a lively
and colorful crossroads of people and produce
from all over Palo Alto and the surrounding

areas. Part of the fun of shopping locally is
shopping seasonally. Ripe and ready, now and
through August, are all different types of
strawberries, peaches and tomatoes.
But don't worry about a lack of selection;
also available are several other varieties of
veggies and fruits, all "fresh from the farm" —
literally. In addition to the vast selection of
produce are stands serving fresh baked goods
and eclectic ethnic food. I recommend the
Indian cuisine or the crepe stand both are
appetizing treats served ready to eat. By shop
ping at the farmers' market, customers are
buying their produce straight from the grow
ers, ensuring that they not only are getting the
freshest produce available to them, but they
also know where it is coming from. Vendors
are always happy to talk about what's new
each week.
Try shopping at a farmers market this sum
mer. It's a win-win: You'll find some fresh and
organic treats to take home, and you'll do it on
good principle.

"BLUEBERRY CRUSH"

Who isn't in love with blueberries? They
are the sexiest superfruit because they keep
you healthy and, with that scintillating violet
color and plump bell shape, look good. A ripe
blueberry is mouthwatering and pumps you
with nutrients and antioxidants.
True wild blueberries are native only to
North America, and 25 percent of the United
States' blueberry market is grown in Maine.
Take advantage of blueberry season, which
peaks in July. Get your berries at a local
farmer's market or grocery — but be sure to
freeze them! The trick to this recipe is to start
with frozen berries.
Ingredients:
• 1 cup frozen blueberries, unsweetened
• Soy milk
• Goji berries, chopped nuts to taste
Directions:
• Fill a small cup or bowl with frozen blueberries.
• Splash generously with soy milk.
• Let stand while the soy milk hardens around the berries.
• Mash mixture with a spoon and add nuts and Goji berries as
desired.
• Prepare for a purple tongue.
• Enjoy! It's so sweet!
Especially savory when served hot!
