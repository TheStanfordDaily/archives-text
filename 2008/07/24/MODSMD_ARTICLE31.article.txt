## Zibibbo's Mediterranean is pricey, worth every cent 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
Though it has been 10 years
since Gourmet Magazine named
Zibibbo among the nation's top
restaurants, the Palo Alto eatery
maintains its reputation with great
ambience, civility and delicious
food. Despite its humble exterior,
Zibbibo boasts a roomy interior —
spanning an entire block — with a
multitude of seating arrangements
to suit your dining needs: two
indoor patios, two bars, a mezza
nine and several private rooms.
Before the size scares you, know
that even with the gargantuan
space, Zibibbo staff make sure
your dining experience is private,
intimate and tasteful.
Formerly a Barbie Museum, the
restaurant's Kingsley Street loca
tion is convenient for students and
staff looking for an elegant night
off campus. Zibibbo is a part of
Restaurant LuLu, a local string of
fine dining establishments located
in East Palo Alto, Mammoth and
San Francisco started by LuLu, a
former seamstress who worked her
way up to be a restaurateur and
fabricated and designed much of
the furniture used in her eateries.
The menu at Zibibbo has class
written all over it. In addition to
the food options, Zibibbo has an
entire cheese menu, wine book and
cocktail book. It even offers some
foods that you may not have tried,
such as rabbit or the "Devils of the
Deep," a dish with spicy octopus
and calamari. Whatever you order,
you'll be pleasantly surprised at the
speed and presentation of each of
the plates. Nearly everything on
the menu, including the bread, is
made from scratch in house.
The food at Zibibbo is delicious,
period. Your meal starts with an
appetizer plate: Order the three
item sampler with prosciutto with
melon, cod croquette and a third

dish to your taste. Next comes a
small Mediterranean plate. As a
pan-Mediterranean restaurant,
these dishes are key. The
Moroccan prawns do not disap
point and rate among the best
shellfish I've ever tasted. The
entree menu offers many enticing
options: the special of the day, a
rotating selection of fine dishes, a
pasta, pizza, risotto or something
from the grill. Know that you can't
really go wrong, but note that some
dishes, as indicated in the menu,
can take as long as 45 minutes to
prepare. Highly recommended is
the succulent pork loin with pome
granate-molasses sauce, served
with olive oil mashed potatoes.
The wait staff is excellent.
Though diners may be familiar
with run-of-the mill Italian or
Mediterranean fare, the maitre d'
will willingly helping customers
navigate through their specific culi
nary options. One of the managers,
Anthony Phillips, is particularly
attentive and helpful in resolving
any questions you might have. The
waiters are prompt, happy and
courteous — and you'll be amazed
at the alacrity of the food.
Zibibbo is a fine dining experi
ence and as such can be a little out
side both the atmosphere and
pocketbook of the average college
student. However, if your parents
arc in town, you're throwing a lav
ish event or you need a great place
to take that special someone, con
sider Zibibbo with its multitude of
private spaces, large alcohol selec
tion and delicious cuisine.
Zibibbo is located at 430
Kipling Street in downtown Palo
Alto. Reservations are recom
mended, call (650) 328-6722 or go
