Stanford Medical Center's plans for
expansion and redevelopment — over a mil
lion added square feet at a cost of $2 billion

— are on course, according to recent reports.
In spite of concerns surrounding certain
project developments, the University's early
proposals to rebuild Stanford Hospital and
modernize Lucile Packard Children's Center
and the School of Medicine have all gone
according to plan, the University said. An
environmental impact report by the city of
Palo Alto is the next hurdle planners must
clear.
The hospital is satisfied with the way
expansion plans are progressing,, according

to Executive Director of Public Affairs
Shelley Hebert.
"The project is currently going through
the approval process with the city of Palo
Alto, including the reviews by the Planning
and Transportation Commission and the
Architectural Review Board, as well as
updates and discussions with the City
Council," Hebert wrote in an email to The
Weekly. "Our current projection for com
pleting the new Stanford Hospital is 2015-
2016, so we are comfortable with the timing

at this point but would be very concerned if
delayed beyond 2009 for approvals."
Aspects of the project currently under
review and seeking city approval range from
transportation designs to basic architectural
schemes. Furthermore, the city of Palo Alto
is currently developing its Environmental
Impact Report (EIR). Mandated by the
State of California's Environmental Quality
Act, the FIR could significantly influence
