## HOSPITAL & CLINICS Hospital pursues $2 billion expansion plan Hurdles remain from city of Palo Alto regarding impact 
### RYAN MAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Medical Center's plans for
expansion and redevelopment — over a mil
lion added square feet at a cost of $2 billion

— are on course, according to recent reports.
In spite of concerns surrounding certain
project developments, the University's early
proposals to rebuild Stanford Hospital and
modernize Lucile Packard Children's Center
and the School of Medicine have all gone
according to plan, the University said. An
environmental impact report by the city of
Palo Alto is the next hurdle planners must
clear.
The hospital is satisfied with the way
expansion plans are progressing,, according

to Executive Director of Public Affairs
Shelley Hebert.
"The project is currently going through
the approval process with the city of Palo
Alto, including the reviews by the Planning
and Transportation Commission and the
Architectural Review Board, as well as
updates and discussions with the City
Council," Hebert wrote in an email to The
Weekly. "Our current projection for com
pleting the new Stanford Hospital is 2015-
2016, so we are comfortable with the timing

at this point but would be very concerned if
delayed beyond 2009 for approvals."
Aspects of the project currently under
review and seeking city approval range from
transportation designs to basic architectural
schemes. Furthermore, the city of Palo Alto
is currently developing its Environmental
Impact Report (EIR). Mandated by the
State of California's Environmental Quality
Act, the FIR could significantly influence
how expansion and construction will
proceed.
A statement from the city of Palo
Alto explained that the purpose of
an EIR is to provide the public with
detailed information about the envi
ronmental effects of a proposed pro
ject. The report will also lists ways to
minimize the effects of the project
and discuss alternatives to building.
Palo Alto City Project Leader
Steven Turner explained that the
city's main attention is now focused
on completing a draft of the EIR
and finishing a suitable analysis of
Stanford's plans.
"As of now, we are completing
the Environmental Impact Report
process and some preliminary archi
tectural review analysis of the appli
cation," he explained. "We are still
in analysis mode and have not yet
completed the EIR nor the design
review. The EIR is expected to be
released in November and we will
be continuing on the design review
this year."
Recent concerns, however, have
arisen regarding the possible reper
cussions of the Environmental
Impact Report.
"Issues that have been raised in
the community include traffic and
mitigations for that traffic," Turner
said. "The expansion could poten
tially bring additional employees,
and employees typically need hous
ing. The question is, is there going to
be a need for housing as a result of
expanding with this project?"
The completion of the
Environmental Impact Report is
crucial to the smooth continuation
of the project.
"The current projected schedule

for issuing the draft report at the
end of 2009 is very important for
keeping the project on track and
meeting the legal requirements of
the seismic safety issues," said
Hebert, pointing out that the hospi
tal must meet state seismic require
ments by 2013.
The New Hospital
Seismic concerns are a large part
of the rationale for rebuilding the
Medical Center. The new facilities,
which will be built on the existing
footprint of the current Medical
Center, are to be funded at around
$2 billion — a combination of bor
rowed funds, funds from current
operations and donations, Hebert
said.
Citing a need for more space,
better facilities and seismically
sound buildings, the hospital's move
toward improvement will place it at
the cutting-edge of health practice.
The Stanford Hospital is to be com
pletely rebuilt, leading to a net
increase of 724,000 square feet and
an additional 144 patient beds, while
the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital is to expanded by 401,500
square feet for an added 104 patient
beds.
The University's. School of
Medicine will have its lab facilities
replaced with newer, integrated lab
oratories for education and
research. In .all, there is a projected
increase of 1,991 more employees
throughout the Hospital Center for
improved care and patient attention.
Perhaps the most important
aspect of the project is its ability to
allow the Hospital Center to remain
in operation during construction.
"The existing Stanford Hospital
will remain fully open and serving
the patients during the five-year
construction period of the new facil
ity," Hebert said. "When the new
facility is completed, redevelopment

of the older portions of the existing
hospital building will proceed."
"There will be no disruption in
patient care during the construc
tion," he added, "which is one of the
significant advantages and benefits
of the proposed plans."
