## Tobacco proves unlikely hero Plant found useful for antibody preparation 
### JOANNA XU 
Tobacco is well-known as a lead
ing cause of cancer, but according to
a study by Stanford researchers, it
may one day become widely used to
cure it.
The study, published Monday in
a National Academy of Science jour
nal, concludes that tobacco plants
may be engineered cheaply and
quickly to grow safe antibodies,
which can potentially be used to bat
tle cancer.
"This study, in some forms, has
been going on for about 20 years,"
said Stanford Medical School Prof.
Ronald Levy, senior author of the
study.
The research began when Large
Scale Biology Corp., a biomanufac
turing company, approached Levy
with a new technology in which
tobacco plants are infected with a
virus to spur the plants to produce
proteins.
"1 gave them [Large Scale
Biology Corp.] genes from mouth
tumors, and a month later they came
back with the protein they had
grown from tobacco plants," Levy
said. "We tested the proteins in
mice, and the proteins worked effec
tively as vaccines to spur the
immune system.
"We then moved the study into
clinical trial, which is what this paper
is all about," he added.
Unlike current vaccines such as
