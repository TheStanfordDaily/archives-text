## Tobacco proves unlikely hero Plant found useful for antibody preparation 
### JOANNA XU 
Tobacco is well-known as a lead
ing cause of cancer, but according to
a study by Stanford researchers, it
may one day become widely used to
cure it.
The study, published Monday in
a National Academy of Science jour
nal, concludes that tobacco plants
may be engineered cheaply and
quickly to grow safe antibodies,
which can potentially be used to bat
tle cancer.
"This study, in some forms, has
been going on for about 20 years,"
said Stanford Medical School Prof.
Ronald Levy, senior author of the
study.
The research began when Large
Scale Biology Corp., a biomanufac
turing company, approached Levy
with a new technology in which
tobacco plants are infected with a
virus to spur the plants to produce
proteins.
"1 gave them [Large Scale
Biology Corp.] genes from mouth
tumors, and a month later they came
back with the protein they had
grown from tobacco plants," Levy
said. "We tested the proteins in
mice, and the proteins worked effec
tively as vaccines to spur the
immune system.
"We then moved the study into
clinical trial, which is what this paper
is all about," he added.
Unlike current vaccines such as
Gardasil, which protects against the
virus that causes cervical cancer, the
vaccines in the study are therapeutic
— they could actually cure existing
cases.
A total of 16 B-cell lymphoma
patients participated in the study.
Since each patient has a unique can
cer antibody, 16 personalized vac
cines were produced and repro
duced from tobacco plants.
These experimental vaccines
indeed triggered safe immune
responses, without side effects, in a
majority of the patients tested in the
clinical trial.
"If successful and effective, this
process can be developed into a vac
cine to treat patients with lym
phoma," Levy said.
Approximately 18,000
Americans are diagnosed annualh
with B-cell lymphoma, which is a
slow-growing, incurable type of can
cer that is usually left untreated in
its early stages. These plant-grown
vaccines could provide a more
aggressive treatment for this cancer.
Cancer patients are not the only
ones that stand to benefit from the
study.
"There are lots of diseases for
which proteins are needed," Levy
said. "This vaccine production tech
nology, if proven effective, can also
be used for hormone injections, ■
enzyme replacement and to pro
duce monoclonal antibodies."
Levy, however, cautioned that
this study only concluded that plant
produced vaccines could incite
immune responses and that such
vaccines were safe. The study did
not test to see if the vaccines did the
patients any good in the long term.
Testing the effectiveness and bene
fit of the personalized, plant-pro
duced vaccines will be the next step
of the study, which will be a second
phase clinical trial.
Levy and his team of researchers
would like to produce more person
alized plant-vaccine products for a
larger number of patients in the
next trial.
The study has already generated
significant interest, both because ot •
its promise as a new form of cancer
therapy, and because of the plant
that it uses.
"I find it ironic that tobacco is (
now part of an instrument that
could potentially make treatments j
for cancer," Levy said, "because
people usually think of tobacco as a :
cause of cancer."
Just don't expect a tobacco-aided :
cancer cure to come in smoke-able
form.
