## Survey shows ethics important 
### MILES OSGOOD 
A Graduate School of Business
survey revealed that an employer's
ethical reputation is now nearly as
important as salary level to graduat
ing MB As. This year's graduates,
who watched Enron and Worldcom
collapse as they finished their
undergraduate studies and wit
nessed Bear Stearns vanish as they
earned their graduate degrees, are
willing to give up $15,000 a year to
work at a socially responsible firm,
according to researchers.
David Montgomery, professor
emeritus at the GSB, and Catherine
Ramus, associate professor at the
University of California, Santa
Barbara, conducted the web poll,
which asked 759 MB As graduating
this year from 11 top American and
European business schools to rank
corporate qualities according to
importance in comparing job offers.
Intellectual challenge was first, fol
lowed by salary and geographic loca
tion.
"It turns out however that ethics
and caring about people are about
95 percent as important as money
and geographic area," Montgomery
said. "That's surprising."
While Montgomery said that the
$15,000 figure might be slightly
inflated, he agreed that it indicates
that business ethics has become a
significant factor in career consider
ations for top young businesspeople.
The survey tested four character

istics of social responsibility to
encompass issues relating to the com
munity, the environment and stock
holders. Ethical conduct and care lor
employees ranked 75 percent as high
as the top consideration, intellectual
challenge, while responsibilities
towards the community and investors
were slightly less important.
"1 have showed historically that
these hypothetical choices will actu
ally predict pretty well,"
Montgomery said, citing studies
from the late 70s and early 80s.
To test old versions of the sur
vey, he used students' rankings and
job offers in January to anticipate
which firms they would choose in
May. Chance alone yields 30 per
cent accuracy; Montgomery's pre
dictions were correct 63 to 83 per
cent of the time.
Unfortunately, it's impossible to
tell, even from these past surveys,
whether the high ranking of corpo
rate responsibility is a new trend â€”
the 2(X)8 survey was the first of its
kind to include ethical concerns.
Without telling respondents,
Montgomery and Ramus specifically
designed the survey to determine the
weight of new factors.
"Times have changed,"
Montgomery said. "What are the 21st
century aspects of job search?"
Apparently, a social conscience
ranks high among them.
