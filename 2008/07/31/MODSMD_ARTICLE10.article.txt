## Fisher charms Court three times Prof. defends in capital punishment case 
### BEN ASHER DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Law School Prof. Jeff Fisher, who
appeared before the Supreme Court
three times this year, is batting above
.300 in front of the highest court in the
land. Although he didn't fare as well
representing plaintiffs in the Exxon

Valdez oil spill case and a defendant
in a smaller drug distribution case,
Fisher scored a historic victory in the
Kennedy v. Louisiana capital punish
ment case.
Prior to the Court's June 25 ruling,
Louisiana state law allowed for the
death penalty for the rape of children
under 12 years old. The law was
passed in 1995, and since then,
Georgia, South Carolina, Texas,
Oklahoma and Montana have adopt
ed similar laws. Fisher represented
Patrick Kennedy, who was convicted
of raping his eight-year-old step

daughter and was facing the death
penalty.
"It was what we were hoping for,"
Fisher said of the Supreme Court's
decision to not allow the death penal
ty for Kennedy.
According to Fisher, the conserva
tive-leaning Supreme Court could
have used Kennedy's case to expand
the death penalty beyond homicide
cases. A convicted rapist has not
received the death penalty in the
United States since the 19605.
