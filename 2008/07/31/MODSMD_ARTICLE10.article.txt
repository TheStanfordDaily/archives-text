## Fisher charms Court three times Prof. defends in capital punishment case 
### BEN ASHER DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Law School Prof. Jeff Fisher, who
appeared before the Supreme Court
three times this year, is batting above
.300 in front of the highest court in the
land. Although he didn't fare as well
representing plaintiffs in the Exxon

Valdez oil spill case and a defendant
in a smaller drug distribution case,
Fisher scored a historic victory in the
Kennedy v. Louisiana capital punish
ment case.
Prior to the Court's June 25 ruling,
Louisiana state law allowed for the
death penalty for the rape of children
under 12 years old. The law was
passed in 1995, and since then,
Georgia, South Carolina, Texas,
Oklahoma and Montana have adopt
ed similar laws. Fisher represented
Patrick Kennedy, who was convicted
of raping his eight-year-old step

daughter and was facing the death
penalty.
"It was what we were hoping for,"
Fisher said of the Supreme Court's
decision to not allow the death penal
ty for Kennedy.
According to Fisher, the conserva
tive-leaning Supreme Court could
have used Kennedy's case to expand
the death penalty beyond homicide
cases. A convicted rapist has not
received the death penalty in the
United States since the 19605.
Although it was not mentioned
in the courtroom, a factual Haw in
the decision garnered recent atten
tion: In 2006, President Bush passed
a law that amended the sex crimes
segment of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, making child rape
worthy of the death penalty. The
military law's recent passing and
federal jurisdiction make it relevant
to the case. In a rare admission of
error then, Justice Department offi
cials acknowledged last week that
they should have brought up the
2006 law.
Fisher also took part in the
Exxon-Valdez case and saw dam
ages for his clients reduced from
$2.5 billion to $500 million.
Litigation has been ongoing
since the Exxon-Valdez oil spill in
1989, but the decades-long case was
finally brought to rest by the Court

on the same day as the Kennedy vs.
Louisiana decision was announced.
In a 5-3 decision, (Samuel Alito did
not take part in the decision
because he owns Exxon stock),
Exxon saw the amount of damages
it has to pay reduced bv more than
half.
In Fisher's other Supreme Court
case this year, Burgess vs. United
States, his client's appeal for a
reduced sentence (stemming from a
conviction over drug distribution)
was rejected unanimously by the
Court.
Looking back at his three
Supreme Court appearances this
year, Fisher described it as "a thrill
and a privilege" to step before the
Court. Despite the compromise
and loss he faced in the latter two
decisions, Fisher was pleased by the
Kennedy decision and his part in
such an important ruling.
"It's an amazing institution,"
Fisher said of the Court.
