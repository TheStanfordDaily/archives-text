## Study finds possible secret of aging Transcription genes prove important among worms 
### LISA WALLACE DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Genetics, not wear and tear, may be the true
cause of aging, according to a study by School
of Medicine researchers.
Led by Developmental Biology and
Genetics Prof. Stuart Kim, the study looked at
20,000 genes in C. elegans, a millimeter-long
worm. Researchers monitored discrepancies
in gene function over the course of the worms'
lives. They found that 1,254 genes had differ
ent levels of function depending on the
worm's age.
This suggests that certain genes, especially
transcription factors — the "on-and-off
switch" genes that regulate the function of
other genes — play important roles in regulat
ing the process of aging cells. Transcription

factors in worms were found to gradually dis
rupt the balance in cell regulation, over time
turning more genes "off," than were being

turned "on."
But the new theory doesn't explain every
thing. A gene-based explanation of aging
doesn't account for vast differences in the life
spans of species — this is better explained by
the old molecular damage theory.
"The [old theory] is that there is damage to
the proteins," Kim said. "The differences in
life spans must be how well you tolerate or
repair the damage to your cells. There is a
huge variation in life spans, all dependent on
the same chemical reactions."
In the molecular damage theory, oxygen
free radicals gradually break down the mole
cules within the cells of species, and this wear
and tear contributes to a gradual breakdown
in their ability to function.
Kim and his colleagues sought to gauge just
how much genetics can affect life span when
they conducted the study — the researchers
took steps to find how much deterioration and
genetics contributed to aging, respectively.

"We rebalanced the system [stopping alto
gether the function of the transcription fac
tors]," Kim explained. "Worms lived 50 per
cent longer [as a result], I don't have the tools
yet to really balance it — all I can do is knock
it out."
With the power to alter transcription fac
tors might come the power to extend life.
[KHlJScientists could inhibit genes' ability to
control the function of cell regulation and thus
control the amount of time a individual pos
sesses a balance in cell regulation. The longer
amount of time balance is achieved, the longer
life is sustainable.
"Here is the next experiment," Kim said.
"Let a worm grow old so the pathways are
unbalanced, and then balance the pathways
[by controlling changes in transcription factors
over time] and see what happens. Ask yourself
the question that perhaps you not only slowed
down the process of aging but you reversed it.
It's a really fascinating process, and 1 think we
can understand it."
