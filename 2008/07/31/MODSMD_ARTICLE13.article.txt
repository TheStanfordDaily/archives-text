## This Stanford Life The
						Internet Age meets the Gilded Age 
### 
Only a year ago, Law School
Prof. Lawrence Lessig was
the world famous guru of
intellectual property reform. But
now he is exclusively a crusader
against government corruption.
Earlier this year, Lessig launched
a grassroots effort named Change
Congress. (He also contemplated a
run for Congress, but ultimately
decided not to run.) Change
Congress has been charged with the
enormous goal of helping to "end
corruption in America's Congress"
by ending the power of special inter
ests like PACs, ending earmarks,
holding more open hearings and
supporting public financing.
Given such broad goals, it is easy
to be skeptical of Lessig's new direc
tion: People have been grappling
with the power of money in politics
for over two centuries. But Prof.
Lessig's new campaign is the most
exciting attempt in a long time, and
Stanford is lucky to play a key part.
Indeed, the campaign is a long-term
attempt by a brilliant and tech-savvy
thinker to tackle a traditional prob
lem. In Change Congress, the
Internet Age meets the Gilded Age;
Silicon Valley meets Washington
D.C. As Stanford students, faculty
and community-members, we
should take notice and even help
out.
If you haven't heard of Lessig
yet, you probably haven't been pay
ing attention to the intersection of
law and technology. The Law
School faculty member has been at
the heart of tech issues for a decade.
In a nutshell, as the Internet and
software industries boomed, owner
ship questions arose. Lessig con
fronted these questions by advocat
ing free software, open spectrums
and an end to copyright extensions.
He became a Silicon Valley hero,
standing up for the innovation and
free How of information. In 2002,
The Economist called him the "rock
star of the information age."
Now he is applying Silicon Valley
values to take on federal corruption.
Lessig wants to use the Internet's
free-How of information to increase
transparency and social networking
to mobilize interest in the issue.
Change Congress serves as a central
point for several tactics to meet. He
has a slew of ideas: a wiki that will
document cases of government cor
ruption, a web resource that tracks
donations, meetings and votes so
that citizens can see special interest
influence and more. Most impor
tantly, he wants to enhance the pro
file of the work that has already
been put into the issue of political

Craft

corruption, like that done by the
Sunshine Foundation and
Opensecrets.org.
Lessig's efforts are basically non
partisan. Conservatives shouldn't
fear Lessig, nor should they fear
Change Congress. The movement
certainly uses classic progressive
language, but its core principles
span the political spectrum.
Republican candidate John McCain,
for example, is the Senate's loudest
proponent of ending earmarks.
Moreover, Lessig openly declares
himself to be "a liberal Democrat,"
but his personal history and views
are more complex than just that. For
instance, Lessing has a sparkling
free trade record, economics and
management degrees from the
Wharton School and a law degree
from the right-leaning University of
Chicago Law School. He even
clerked for conservative judges
Justice Antonin Scalia and Richard
Posner. The net effect is an align
ment of liberal and libertarian ideas
— a less invasive, smaller and more
efficient federal government less
beholden to a few rich individuals.
Admittedly, Lessig's new direc
tion can seem opportunistic. After
years of boldly focusing on patents
and copyrights, he took the less bold
move of creating a vaguely progres
sive movement in the midst of a
vaguely progressive Zeitgeist. It's
like Obama's calls for change, but
even more vague — if that's human
ly possible. While he was a truly
original leader in the field of intel
lectual property, he can seem like a
lowly follower in the field of politi
cal reform.
I am typically skeptical of hyper
bolic declarations for change. Can
we really change the incentives of
elected officials? More power
means more corruption, right? But I
have faith in the creativity of Lessig
and so should you. He has launched
a 10-year mission of intense focus to
accomplish some of these huge
goals. Getting involved with Change
Congress is an opportunity to be on
the cutting edge of an issue that has
always haunted our nation. For, as
Lessig himself has said, money in
American politics is "not a problem
on the margins, but right at the
core."

Paul Craft dreams daydreams about a
leaner, meaner Federal government.
