## Obama's World 
### 
Obama's trip to the Middle
East and Europe last week
was one of the most impres
sive displays of political skill,
orchestrated symbolism and
rhetoric in recent memory. While
showing his rapport with European
leaders, he more importantly but
tressed his foreign-policy creden
tials. The media ate up the trip like I
eat up red curry — voraciously. The
press coverage was so extensive and
positive that John McCain's cam
paign, desperate for attention, was
forced to "leak" false rumors to
reporters that his Veep choice
would be announced soon.
The trip was brilliantly planned
from start to finish. Obama got him
self photographed wearing a
yarmulke at the Wailing Wall, which
is certain to reassure Jewish voters.
The visit to Iraq coincided nicely
with his repositioning on his strategy
for the country. And,Obama's big
public speech, to an enormous
200,000 people, was in Berlin. As a
friend pointed out, Germany is a
noncontroversial (and popular)
country to Americans. Had the
speech been in France, it would
have been much easier for
Republicans to attack him.
Considering how well the trip
went, John McCain got desperate.
The McCain camp's main criticism
of Obama's trip was that it distract
ed from the economic problems
Americans are facing domestically.
McCain insists on pretending that
the economic problems in the US
can somehow be solved by cutting
taxes. They clearly cannot, and will
require international cooperation,
which McCain seems less able to

offer than Obama. And in the minds
of voters, it is Obama that has the
edge on economic issues, not
McCain.
Clearly, the foreign-policy
dynamic substantially changed since
2004. When John Kerry mentioned
that some foreign leaders supported
him, the Bush campaign was quick
to make that a bad thing. Kerry's
ability to speak French was roundly
pilloried by the Republican press.
The candidates competed to say
how little they would listen to any
one outside of the United States.
The chest-thumping anti-
Europeanism of four years ago has
now disappeared as the limits of
American power have become clear
to pretty much everyone not cur
rently employed by the Bush admin
istration. Now, thankfully, McCain
and Obama are competing to show
their ability to work multilaterally.
But it's clear that Obama has this
battle won, far and away. French
President Nicholas Sarkozy all but
endorsed Obama; remember, this is
the man whom Republicans loved to
talk about during their primary
debates. British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown, realizing that his
predecessor's close relationship with
George Bush contributed to his
downfall, has to realize that an
Obama presidency will help his own
struggle to stay in power. Iraqi

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki —
the man with 140,000 American
troops in his country — endorsed
Obama's 16-month withdrawal plan,
which left the Bush White House
scrambling to control the damage.
What is most striking about
Obama's campaign in this phase is
its intense, consistent seriousness.
This is not a campaign that takes
itself lightly at all. McCain is known
for shooting the off-the-record
breeze with reporters at the back of
the Straight Talk Express; Obama's
campaign not only severely limits
press access and clamps down on
any leaks, but attacks reporters, as
Adam Nagourney described in a
recent article in The New Republic.
This seriousness might be what we
need to legitimize the presidency
again. Seriousness resurrected the
Batman franchise; maybe it will
work for America, too.
I've been skeptical about
Obama's foreign-policy chops
before, and 1 still am. He's still too
likely to cave to the left on free
trade and Iraq-related issues. But
what he has shown with this trip to
Europe and the Middle East is his
rapport with the international lead
ers with whom he will be working if
he is president in six months.
Personal relationships — which led
President Bush down the wrong
path with Vladimir Putin — will
prove to be far more important than
most people think as we try to resus
citate our image abroad.

Stiuirt Bamxel wishes he could go to Europe
and charm the socks off of 200,000
Berliners. Someday. Commiserate at sh
